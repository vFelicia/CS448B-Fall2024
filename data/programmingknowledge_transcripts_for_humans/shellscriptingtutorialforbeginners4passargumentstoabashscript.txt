00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:01 - shell scripting tutorial for beginners
00:04 - in the last video we have seen how we
00:05 - can read parameters in our script now in
00:10 - this video I'm going to show you how we
00:12 - can pass argument to A bash script so
00:15 - whenever you start the script you can
00:18 - pass some argument with it so let's get
00:21 - started so let's discuss the first way
00:24 - of passing the argument and how we can
00:27 - pass those argument so we will just
00:30 - write Echo and uh whenever you pass an
00:34 - argument from bash script they are uh
00:37 - you know stored into a default uh
00:41 - argument which are like this so the
00:44 - first uh you know argument which you
00:47 - pass in an array will be stored in
00:50 - dollar one variable then the second
00:55 - argument which you pass into uh you know
00:59 - a b script will be saved in dollar two
01:02 - and so on right so for example if you
01:04 - want to pass three arguments then it it
01:08 - will be stored uh in dollar one variable
01:11 - then dollar two variable and dollar
01:13 - three variable uh
01:15 - consecutively right so uh let's pass
01:19 - some arguments and uh let's print those
01:22 - arguments also so what I'm going to do
01:24 - is I'm going to take single code and I
01:28 - will just write uh
01:31 - Echo dollar one dollar two and dollar
01:35 - three okay so let's start our script and
01:38 - let's see how they are passed okay so
01:42 - I'm going to start my script which is
01:46 - hello.sh and here with the script I can
01:50 - pass some arguments so for example you
01:54 - want to uh send some name to a script
01:58 - whenever you start a script so for
01:59 - example I want to send three names for
02:02 - example Mark Tom and John for example
02:08 - and I will just press enter and you can
02:11 - see they are printed so the first uh you
02:15 - know name goes into this variable second
02:19 - name goes into the second uh variable
02:22 - and third name goes into third variable
02:25 - by default right now uh where does this
02:29 - uh name goes so the zeroth variable
02:34 - whenever for example you write something
02:36 - like this dollar Z then you will be able
02:40 - to see uh this script name also okay so
02:45 - let's run the script once again and
02:47 - let's see what happens so the same
02:49 - script and then with the same argument
02:52 - press enter and you can see uh the name
02:56 - of your shell script also comes so this
02:59 - is is the
03:01 - zero variable you can say and then the
03:05 - actual variables which you actually pass
03:08 - in your script as an argument starts
03:11 - from variable one and then so on
03:14 - variable two and variable three okay so
03:18 - this is how you can pass the argument to
03:21 - a b script now there is a second way of
03:25 - passing the arguments whatever you pass
03:29 - into your script RP as an array okay so
03:32 - how we can pass those argument into an
03:35 - array and then use them so what we can
03:38 - do is we can declare any variable name
03:40 - for example ARS or arguments whatever
03:44 - name you want to give here and then
03:46 - there is a default uh variable in which
03:50 - these uh uh you know these argument goes
03:54 - as an array and to pass this array you
03:57 - just need to write bracket and in the
04:00 - quotes dollar at the rate so this dollar
04:03 - at the rate uh you know stores your
04:07 - argument as an array and to pass them
04:10 - you just need to uh declare a variable
04:13 - and then you know assign those uh uh
04:17 - argument which are stored in this dollar
04:20 - at the rate into this argument right and
04:23 - now we can Echo those arguments so I'm
04:26 - just going to copy this Echo Comm
04:29 - command and then this ARG at index uh
04:33 - for example one let's print out the
04:37 - argument at index one and in the last
04:39 - video I've shown you how to uh you know
04:42 - print an array Index right so you write
04:46 - dollar symbol and then the name of your
04:50 - uh array inside the curly bracket so
04:53 - inside the curly bracket name of the
04:55 - array and then whatever index you want
04:57 - to see so for example I want to see
04:59 - index one here right and then same way
05:02 - you can uh do with the second and the
05:06 - third argument at index two and the
05:11 - third argument and let's say we also
05:13 - want to pass the argument which is at
05:17 - index0 so I'm going to just write a
05:21 - index0 okay and let's run the script
05:25 - once again and let's see what happens
05:28 - okay so I'm going to just uh you know
05:31 - run the same script with the same
05:33 - arguments and press enter and you can
05:36 - see those uh argument which we have
05:39 - passed first of first of all they are
05:41 - printed using this Echo command and then
05:45 - in the second line they are printed
05:47 - using this Echo command so the important
05:51 - uh thing to notice here is whenever you
05:55 - pass the argument as an array the first
05:59 - argument which you pass uh here will be
06:03 - uh assigned to the array at index zero
06:06 - right so these default variabl starts
06:09 - from 0 1 to 3 and 0o uh is the variable
06:13 - for the script name right but if you
06:17 - assign them as an array the zeroth index
06:20 - will be for the first argument right and
06:24 - then first index will be for the second
06:27 - argument and the third uh index uh
06:29 - second index will be for the third
06:32 - argument so if you delete this also then
06:36 - the result will be the same so let's run
06:39 - the script once again with the same
06:40 - argument and the result will be the same
06:43 - right now uh for example if you want to
06:46 - P print all the argument at once you can
06:50 - uh do that also so you can just write
06:52 - Echo and then use uh this default
06:55 - variable at the rate which we have used
06:58 - to uh convert convert uh this argument
07:00 - to an array right so if you use Echo and
07:04 - then this dollar symbol and uh then this
07:07 - uh default variable at the rate then all
07:10 - the arguments will be printed using this
07:14 - variable so let me comment this code and
07:18 - now let me print those argument with
07:21 - this default uh variable so let's uh run
07:24 - the script once again and the result
07:27 - will be same so all those argument will
07:29 - be saved inside this default variable
07:33 - okay now sometimes you want to know the
07:35 - number of argument which you have passed
07:39 - into uh the script so to print the
07:42 - number of argument which are passed into
07:45 - the script you can just write Echo and
07:48 - there is a default variable once again
07:51 - which is hash then it's going to uh you
07:55 - know print the number of argument which
07:58 - are passed so in our case we are passing
08:01 - three arguments so it's going to print
08:04 - three here so let's run the script once
08:06 - again and let's see what's the result so
08:09 - you can see the result is three here
08:12 - okay so this dollar and this default
08:15 - variable hash is going to print the
08:18 - number of argument passed to the bash
08:22 - script okay so these are some of the
08:25 - ways you can uh you know pass the
08:28 - arguments to your script I hope you have
08:31 - enjoyed this video please write comment
08:32 - and subscribe and bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome to the next video on shell scripting tutorial for beginners in the last video we have seen how we can read parameters in our script now in this video I'm going to show you how we can pass argument to A bash script so whenever you start the script you can pass some argument with it so let's get started so let's discuss the first way of passing the argument and how we can pass those argument so we will just write Echo and uh whenever you pass an argument from bash script they are uh you know stored into a default uh argument which are like this so the first uh you know argument which you pass in an array will be stored in dollar one variable then the second argument which you pass into uh you know a b script will be saved in dollar two and so on right so for example if you want to pass three arguments then it it will be stored uh in dollar one variable then dollar two variable and dollar three variable uh consecutively right so uh let's pass some arguments and uh let's print those arguments also so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take single code and I will just write uh Echo dollar one dollar two and dollar three okay so let's start our script and let's see how they are passed okay so I'm going to start my script which is hello.sh and here with the script I can pass some arguments so for example you want to uh send some name to a script whenever you start a script so for example I want to send three names for example Mark Tom and John for example and I will just press enter and you can see they are printed so the first uh you know name goes into this variable second name goes into the second uh variable and third name goes into third variable by default right now uh where does this uh name goes so the zeroth variable whenever for example you write something like this dollar Z then you will be able to see uh this script name also okay so let's run the script once again and let's see what happens so the same script and then with the same argument press enter and you can see uh the name of your shell script also comes so this is is the zero variable you can say and then the actual variables which you actually pass in your script as an argument starts from variable one and then so on variable two and variable three okay so this is how you can pass the argument to a b script now there is a second way of passing the arguments whatever you pass into your script RP as an array okay so how we can pass those argument into an array and then use them so what we can do is we can declare any variable name for example ARS or arguments whatever name you want to give here and then there is a default uh variable in which these uh uh you know these argument goes as an array and to pass this array you just need to write bracket and in the quotes dollar at the rate so this dollar at the rate uh you know stores your argument as an array and to pass them you just need to uh declare a variable and then you know assign those uh uh argument which are stored in this dollar at the rate into this argument right and now we can Echo those arguments so I'm just going to copy this Echo Comm command and then this ARG at index uh for example one let's print out the argument at index one and in the last video I've shown you how to uh you know print an array Index right so you write dollar symbol and then the name of your uh array inside the curly bracket so inside the curly bracket name of the array and then whatever index you want to see so for example I want to see index one here right and then same way you can uh do with the second and the third argument at index two and the third argument and let's say we also want to pass the argument which is at index0 so I'm going to just write a index0 okay and let's run the script once again and let's see what happens okay so I'm going to just uh you know run the same script with the same arguments and press enter and you can see those uh argument which we have passed first of first of all they are printed using this Echo command and then in the second line they are printed using this Echo command so the important uh thing to notice here is whenever you pass the argument as an array the first argument which you pass uh here will be uh assigned to the array at index zero right so these default variabl starts from 0 1 to 3 and 0o uh is the variable for the script name right but if you assign them as an array the zeroth index will be for the first argument right and then first index will be for the second argument and the third uh index uh second index will be for the third argument so if you delete this also then the result will be the same so let's run the script once again with the same argument and the result will be the same right now uh for example if you want to P print all the argument at once you can uh do that also so you can just write Echo and then use uh this default variable at the rate which we have used to uh convert convert uh this argument to an array right so if you use Echo and then this dollar symbol and uh then this uh default variable at the rate then all the arguments will be printed using this variable so let me comment this code and now let me print those argument with this default uh variable so let's uh run the script once again and the result will be same so all those argument will be saved inside this default variable okay now sometimes you want to know the number of argument which you have passed into uh the script so to print the number of argument which are passed into the script you can just write Echo and there is a default variable once again which is hash then it's going to uh you know print the number of argument which are passed so in our case we are passing three arguments so it's going to print three here so let's run the script once again and let's see what's the result so you can see the result is three here okay so this dollar and this default variable hash is going to print the number of argument passed to the bash script okay so these are some of the ways you can uh you know pass the arguments to your script I hope you have enjoyed this video please write comment
