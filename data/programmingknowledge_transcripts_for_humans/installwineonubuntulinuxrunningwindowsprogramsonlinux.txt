00:03 - wine on your open to operating system
00:06 - using wine you can run Windows
00:11 - applications on your Linux operating
00:13 - system so to download the wine on your
00:17 - window operating system you can just
00:19 - open your browser and search for wine
00:22 - Linux and the first result which will
00:25 - appear here will be from wine HQ dot or
00:28 - RG so let's click on this link and if
00:31 - you want to learn more about wine what
00:34 - it can do you can read these
00:37 - documentation here which are given on
00:40 - the website and also you can see this
00:43 - downloads button here so I'm going to
00:46 - just click on the Downloads button and
00:48 - once you are on the downloads page when
00:52 - you scroll down you will be able to see
00:54 - the downloads for different
00:57 - distributions so for Android ubuntu
01:01 - debian fedora mac OS so we want to
01:04 - download wine on our Ubuntu operating
01:06 - system so that's why I'm going to just
01:08 - click on the Ubuntu option and then the
01:12 - installation process is straightforward
01:14 - so just follow all these steps which are
01:17 - given here so first of all open your
01:20 - terminal to open the terminal you can
01:22 - either press ctrl alt T or you can
01:28 - search for the terminal by just clicking
01:30 - on the show applications option and then
01:32 - just search for the terminal here which
01:35 - is going to open the terminal for you so
01:38 - let's just give these commands one by
01:42 - one first is this command sudo dpkg
01:45 - space - - add architecture i386 so let's
01:52 - give this command here you just need to
01:54 - press ctrl shift V in order to paste
01:57 - your command and then press ENTER and
02:00 - then give your Ubuntu password here
02:02 - which is going to
02:04 - add this thing into Obon to now the
02:07 - second command is for the adding of the
02:10 - repository key so we are going to add
02:12 - the repository key just go to the
02:14 - terminal paste this command and then
02:16 - press Enter which is going to add the
02:18 - repository key so the third step is to
02:21 - add the repository so depending upon the
02:24 - version of Ubuntu you have you can
02:27 - choose from these options I have open to
02:30 - 20 point zero four so I'm going to
02:32 - choose the first command which is given
02:35 - here so let's just copy this command and
02:37 - then go to the terminal and paste this
02:40 - command on the terminal and then press
02:43 - Enter so once the adding of the
02:45 - repository is done we are going to go to
02:47 - the next step which is to update the
02:50 - packages so sudo apt update is the
02:53 - command for that so just copy this
02:55 - command and paste it into the terminal
02:56 - and once you do that it will update your
03:00 - packages and then we have the last
03:03 - command and that command is to install
03:07 - the vine on our Ubuntu operating system
03:11 - so we have stable branch development
03:14 - branch and staging branch three
03:16 - different options to install we are
03:19 - going to choose the stable branch
03:20 - because it's most likely to be stable so
03:23 - I'm going to choose this option which is
03:25 - the first option and then just clear my
03:29 - terminal so let's clear the terminal
03:31 - paste this command and then press ENTER
03:33 - and then press Y and then press ENTER
03:37 - once again which is going to start the
03:39 - installation of wine on your open to
03:42 - operating system so just wait for this
03:45 - process to complete so once this process
03:47 - is complete wine is installed on our
03:49 - Ubuntu operating system so I'm going to
03:52 - clear the terminal and then I'm going to
03:55 - just write wine here and then - -
03:59 - version so it's going to show which
04:02 - version of wine we have installed and
04:04 - then we can write wine here in order to
04:09 - know more about wine how to use wine
04:11 - okay so you can just see that to get
04:15 - help you can give wine -
04:18 - - help so I'm going to just do that I'm
04:21 - going to just write wine - - help now in
04:24 - order to configure wine or do wine
04:27 - related settings what you can do is you
04:30 - can give this command which is wine CFG
04:33 - okay
04:34 - it stands for wine configuration and
04:37 - then press enter which is going to open
04:39 - an application like this okay so once
04:44 - this wine configuration window opens you

04:48 - using this window so by default I have
04:52 - selected applications here you can add
04:55 - applications by clicking on the add
04:57 - application button and then you always
05:01 - have virtual 3dr mounted on your window
05:05 - operating system which is going to look
05:08 - like a Windows CE Drive right so I'm
05:11 - going to cancel this option for now here
05:14 - you have the option to choose different
05:16 - windows operating system I'm going to
05:19 - choose Windows 10 here and then click on
