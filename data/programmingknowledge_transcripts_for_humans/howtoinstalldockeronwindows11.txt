00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:01 - you how you can download and install and
00:04 - use Docker on your windows 11 operating
00:06 - system so let's get started and let's
00:08 - see how we can do it so first of all we
00:10 - are going to look into the system
00:12 - requirements for installing docker
00:15 - so I'm going to put this link in the
00:18 - description of this video and you can
00:20 - just click on this link and come to this
00:23 - system requirements page for docker
00:26 - and here
00:27 - in the system requirements page you can
00:31 - see there are two options one is wsl2
00:34 - and other is hyper-v and windows
00:37 - containers for wsl2 backend you should
00:41 - have Windows 1164-bit and the version of
00:45 - Windows 11 you require is home pro
00:48 - version 21 H2 or higher Enterprise or
00:53 - education version 21 H2 or higher
00:56 - you should also have enabled wsl2
00:59 - feature on your windows 11 operating
01:01 - system and then you have these system
01:04 - requirements so you should have 64-bit
01:06 - processor you should have minimum 4GB
01:09 - system RAM and other requirements here
01:13 - WSL stands for Windows subsystem for
01:16 - Linux and I'm going to show you how you
01:18 - can check if it's enabled or not
01:20 - you should also have this hyper-v
01:22 - backend and you can also see the system
01:24 - requirements for that
01:27 - so once you are sure that you all met
01:30 - all the system requirements you can just
01:34 - go to the official Docker page just
01:37 - search for Docker on your favorite
01:38 - browser and the first link which will
01:40 - appear here will be from docker.com so
01:42 - I'm going to click on this link and
01:45 - first of all before even downloading the
01:48 - docker desktop on your windows 11 you
01:52 - need to sign up in this docker.com
01:55 - website so you should have an account in
01:59 - order to start working with Docker on
02:02 - your windows 11 operating system so you
02:04 - can just click on get started if you
02:07 - don't have any account if you already
02:09 - have account you can just sign in with
02:11 - your existing account
02:13 - if you don't have any account you can
02:15 - just click on get started and then
02:19 - here you can click on sign up
02:22 - and
02:24 - you should just provide the basic
02:26 - information for such signing up into the
02:30 - docker account
02:31 - which is a username email ID password
02:34 - and other things right
02:36 - so it's very simple just create a Docker
02:39 - account and once you have the docker
02:41 - account just go to the main page and you
02:45 - can directly see this download button
02:47 - here so I'm going to click on this
02:49 - download Docker desktop I already have a
02:53 - Docker account this file is around 625
02:57 - megabyte at the time of making this
02:59 - video so just wait for the download to
03:01 - complete in a meanwhile I'm going to
03:04 - show you how you can check for WSL 2 or
03:09 - hyper-v if if they are enabled on your
03:12 - windows 11 operating system so you don't
03:15 - need to do much for that so just click
03:19 - on the search bar and then just search
03:21 - for
03:22 - turn Windows feature on or off and here
03:27 - you will be able to see this option turn
03:28 - Windows feature on or off so just click
03:30 - on this uh link and it's going to show
03:34 - you this kind of window
03:36 - and here you will be able to see uh all
03:39 - the features which are available or
03:42 - enabled on your windows 11 operating
03:45 - system so once you see this kind of
03:47 - window and you will see this kind of
03:50 - list in this window
03:52 - first of all you can see this hyper V
03:54 - option so you can just enable this and
03:58 - then when you scroll down a little you
04:00 - will also see a Windows subsystem for
04:03 - Linux so you can just enable that also
04:05 - so just check both these check boxes and
04:09 - then click on OK and it's going to
04:11 - search for required files and once
04:13 - that's done you might need to reboot
04:16 - your Windows operating system so I will
04:19 - suggest to just reboot your windows 11
04:22 - operating system and then you can just
04:26 - continue with the installation
04:29 - so let me just restart my windows 11
04:31 - operating system now once your Windows
04:35 - operating system restarts you can open a
04:38 - command prompt so just search for CMD
04:40 - and then open the command prompt and
04:43 - once command prompt opens you can write
04:46 - this command to check if WSL is
04:49 - installed on your system or not just
04:52 - write WSL and then you can either write
04:55 - for example hyphen hyphen
04:57 - status here and then press enter it's
05:00 - going to show you the status which is
05:03 - the default version for WSL which is
05:07 - enabled on your system and the other
05:10 - information if you want to update the
05:14 - WSL you can just write WSL update which
05:17 - is going to update the WSL on your
05:20 - Windows operating system when you give
05:23 - this status command
05:25 - and if it shows the version 1 instead of
05:30 - version 2 so default version is right
05:32 - now 2 in my case but if it shows version
05:35 - 1 that means WSL one is enabled and you
05:40 - need to set the version 2 as a default
05:43 - version in order to use wsl2 on your
05:47 - Windows operating system so for that the
05:50 - command is this one which is WSL hyphen
05:54 - hyphen set hyphen default hyphen version
05:58 - and
05:59 - if you want to set it to 1 which is the
06:02 - wsl1 version then write 1 here otherwise
06:06 - if you want to set it to 2 just write 2
06:08 - here so let me just set it to 1 and we
06:11 - will check the status again and you can
06:14 - see it's version one and if you want to
06:17 - set it to 2 which in our case we require
06:20 - in order to set the WSL to version as
06:25 - the default then you need this command
06:28 - once again which is WSL hyphen hyphen
06:32 - set hyphen default hyphen version
06:35 - 2 and this is going to set the default
06:39 - version as wsl2 on your windows so let
06:43 - me go to the location where I have
06:45 - installed this executable file which is
06:47 - dot desktop installer I'm going to just
06:51 - click on this
06:52 - and let me minimize this window so here
06:55 - you will see this kind of window which
06:57 - says do you want to allow this app to
06:59 - make changes on your device I'm going to
07:01 - click on yes here and now you can see it
07:04 - says installing Docker desktop and it's
07:07 - initializing some packages and here you
07:10 - can see the configuration you see a used
07:14 - wsl2 instead of hyper-v recommended and
07:18 - it also says add shortcut to desktop I'm
07:21 - going to leave both check boxes as
07:24 - checked and then click on OK and now we
07:27 - just need to wait for some time until
07:29 - this process is complete so now the
07:32 - installation of Docker desktop is
07:34 - finished and you can see this message
07:36 - installation succeeded and here you must
07:39 - restart your windows to complete the
07:42 - installation I can click on close and
07:45 - restart which is going to restart my
07:47 - Windows operating system so now my
07:50 - windows 11 operating system has been
07:52 - restarted and now after few seconds of
07:55 - waiting it's going to show you this kind
07:57 - of window automatically you don't need
07:59 - to do anything
08:00 - you can just click on accept here and
08:03 - it's going to start the docker here
08:06 - right so you can see Docker is starting
08:09 - on my windows 11 operating system and
08:12 - after some time you will be able to see
08:14 - this kind of Docker desktop tool so now
08:18 - I can see Docker desktop is starting on
08:21 - my windows 11 operating system
08:23 - so it might take some time to start but
08:26 - we can already test some commands for
08:28 - Docker so you can just search for CMD
08:33 - and we can check the version or some
08:36 - images of Docker which are there so I'm
08:41 - going to write this first command docker
08:45 - version and then press enter
08:49 - and you can see it shows me the docker
08:52 - desktop version and also it shows me the
08:56 - docker client version here
08:58 - also I can list the docker images right
09:02 - now there are none because it's a new
09:04 - installation but let's check docker
09:08 - images
09:10 - and then press enter and you can see it
09:13 - shows nothing let me clear the screen
09:16 - and then let's search for some image so
09:19 - I'm going to just write
09:21 - docker
09:23 - search and then for example I want to
09:26 - search for MySQL images I can just write
09:29 - my SQL here and then press enter
09:34 - it's going to search all the related
09:36 - images related to mySQL and you can see
09:41 - it's showing me the most popular image
09:44 - so you can see the stars which the image
09:47 - gets and it's also showing if the image
09:52 - is official or not right so the top one
09:55 - here is the MySQL image it has 13
10:01 - 920 stars and it's an official
10:05 - MySQL Docker image which you can install
10:08 - so now you can
10:11 - even install these images and run these
10:15 - images on your windows 11 operating
10:17 - system let's see if Docker is already
10:20 - started you can see now Docker is
10:22 - already started on my windows 11
10:24 - operating system and uh
10:27 - you can always check these guides you
10:31 - can install various images on your
10:34 - windows 11 operating system and you will
10:37 - be able to see all the running
10:39 - containers also in this Docker desktop
10:42 - without even writing some commands on
10:45 - the command prompts if you are the fan
10:47 - of this kind of GUI interface right now
10:52 - if Docker doesn't start for some reason
10:55 - it might be that your WSL 2 is not yet
11:00 - enabled so Docker desktop is going to
11:02 - give you this warning that WSL is not
11:05 - enabled and it's going to also show you
11:07 - some kind of link where you can go and
11:10 - install and enable wsl2 I'm also going
11:14 - to put this link in the description
11:16 - where you can see how you can install
11:20 - and enable wsl2 there are four steps you
11:25 - just need to follow these four steps
11:28 - first one is you just need to open the
11:30 - Powershell as an administrator so you
11:33 - can always open the Powershell
11:36 - as an administrator right click and then
11:40 - click on run as administrator here and
11:44 - then click on yes
11:45 - and then just give all these commands
11:48 - here so first command is this one copy
11:52 - this and paste it on your Powershell
11:56 - and run this Command right
11:58 - and then follow the next step check the
12:03 - requirements then once again just copy
12:06 - this command and paste it on your
12:08 - Powershell terminal and at the end you
12:11 - need to download this package so just
12:14 - click on this WSL Linux kernel update
12:18 - package and it's going to download this
12:21 - package on your Windows operating system
12:24 - it's a MSI file so you can click on it
12:27 - and just run this automatically and it's
12:31 - going to install this WSL package and at
12:34 - last you just need to set your WSL to as
12:38 - the to as your default version right and
12:42 - the command for that is so once you
12:45 - follow the procedure until the fifth
12:46 - step you're good to go right so if it
12:49 - doesn't give you any error until fifth
12:51 - step your Docker will start okay so if
12:55 - Docker doesn't start and if it says W
12:58 - SL2 is not set follow
13:01 - step one to five of this webpage which
13:04 - I'm going to put the link in the
13:06 - description and then your Docker will
13:09 - definitely start okay
13:12 - so I hope you've enjoyed this video and
13:14 - I will see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can download and install and use Docker on your windows 11 operating system so let's get started and let's see how we can do it so first of all we are going to look into the system requirements for installing docker so I'm going to put this link in the description of this video and you can just click on this link and come to this system requirements page for docker and here in the system requirements page you can see there are two options one is wsl2 and other is hyperv and windows containers for wsl2 backend you should have Windows 1164bit and the version of Windows 11 you require is home pro version 21 H2 or higher Enterprise or education version 21 H2 or higher you should also have enabled wsl2 feature on your windows 11 operating system and then you have these system requirements so you should have 64bit processor you should have minimum 4GB system RAM and other requirements here WSL stands for Windows subsystem for Linux and I'm going to show you how you can check if it's enabled or not you should also have this hyperv backend and you can also see the system requirements for that so once you are sure that you all met all the system requirements you can just go to the official Docker page just search for Docker on your favorite browser and the first link which will appear here will be from docker.com so I'm going to click on this link and first of all before even downloading the docker desktop on your windows 11 you need to sign up in this docker.com website so you should have an account in order to

give this status command and if it shows the version 1 instead of version 2 so default version is right now 2 in my case but if it shows version 1 that means WSL one is enabled and you need to set the version 2 as a default version in order to use wsl2 on your Windows operating system so for that the command is this one which is WSL hyphen hyphen set hyphen default hyphen version and if you want to set it to 1 which is the wsl1 version then write 1 here otherwise if you want to set it to 2 just write 2 here so let me just set it to 1 and we will check the status again and you can see it's version one and if you want to set it to 2 which in our case we require in order to set the WSL to version as the default then you need this command once again which is WSL hyphen hyphen set hyphen default hyphen version 2 and this is going to set the default version as wsl2 on your windows so let me go to the location where I have installed this executable file which is dot desktop installer I'm going to just click on this and let me minimize this window so here you will see this kind of window which says do you want to allow this app to make changes on your device I'm going to click on
