00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux command line tutorial for
00:04 - beginners in this video I'm going to
00:05 - show you how you can use WC command in
00:08 - Linux WC command or word count prints a
00:13 - count of new lines words and bytes for
00:18 - each input file so generally you can use
00:21 - WC command with a file and it's going to
00:25 - uh you know give you the number of uh
00:27 - lines in the file or number of words in
00:31 - the file or number of characters in the
00:33 - file so let's see how we can use it so
00:36 - you can see on my desktop I have the
00:39 - this test.txt file so I will just uh
00:42 - change the directory to the desktop and
00:46 - then I'm going to give the WC command
00:48 - here and then the name of the file which
00:51 - is test.txt and I will press enter and
00:55 - you can see it gives this kind of output
00:59 - now the first
01:00 - uh you know output here is one and this
01:04 - is the number of line in this file so
01:07 - I'm going to open this file and you can
01:10 - see there is only one line in this uh
01:13 - text file and this is uh due to this so
01:18 - this is the number of line Second here
01:22 - is six so six is the number of words
01:25 - here so I can count these words 1 2 3 4
01:29 - 5 six so second is the number of words
01:33 - and then the third is the number of
01:36 - characters here so total number of
01:39 - character in this file is uh 42 that's
01:42 - why it's printing this and four fourth
01:45 - is the name of your file okay so this is
01:49 - the simplest use of uh this file you can
01:52 - use now you can also use for example let
01:56 - me uh increase the number of uh lines
01:59 - here so so I'm going to paste for
02:02 - example five lines here right and I'm
02:05 - going to give the same command and you
02:07 - can see it gives right now five lines
02:11 - and then it gives the 30 uh word because
02:14 - uh six
02:16 - into 6 into 5 is uh 30 and then it gives
02:21 - the 210 characters right so this is
02:25 - basically how you can use it now you can
02:28 - use certain FL Flags uh in your WC
02:32 - command which will give you specifically
02:36 - what you want so for example you want to
02:39 - print only the number of by then you can
02:42 - just write a flag called WC minus C and
02:46 - this is going to print only the number
02:49 - of bytes or essentially the number of
02:51 - characters right and just print and just
02:55 - print the number of uh characters which
02:57 - is 210 here right similarly if you want
03:01 - uh to um you know count the number of
03:04 - lines you can just
03:06 - say minus L and then press press enter
03:11 - and it gives you number of lines here
03:13 - right or you can uh use uh the W
03:18 - character or W uh you know flag here
03:22 - it's going to give you the number of
03:24 - words okay and uh you can also use uh uh
03:30 - flag called capital L and this capital L
03:35 - prints the length of the longest line
03:39 - for example I'm going to uh just give uh
03:43 - some more uh words here for
03:46 - example
03:47 - uh
03:49 - words words so this is essentially going
03:53 - to uh give you the length of this line
03:57 - because this is the longest line here
03:59 - right so we can just press enter and you
04:03 - can see it gives the number of uh
04:07 - characters in the longest line which is
04:10 - this one in our case Okay so these are
04:13 - the flag you can use with WC command I
04:15 - hope you enjoyed this video please wait
04:17 - comment subscribe and bye for now

hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video I'm going to show you how you can use WC command in Linux WC command or word count prints a count of new lines words and bytes for each input file so generally you can use WC command with a file and it's going to uh you know give you the number of uh lines in the file or number of words in the file or number of characters in the file so let's see how we can use it so you can see on my desktop I have the this test.txt file so I will just uh change the directory to the desktop and then I'm going to give the WC command here and then the name of the file which is test.txt and I will press enter and you can see it gives this kind of output now the first uh you know output here is one and this is the number of line in this file so I'm going to open this file and you can see there is only one line in this uh text file and this is uh due to this so this is the number of line Second here is six so six is the number of words here so I can count these words 1 2 3 4 5 six so second is the number of words and then the third is the number of characters here so total number of character in this file is uh 42 that's why it's printing this and four fourth is the name of your file okay so this is the simplest use of uh this file you can use now you can also use for example let me uh increase the number of uh lines here so so I'm going to paste for example five lines here right and I'm going to give the same command and you can see it gives right now five lines and then it gives the 30 uh word because uh six into 6 into 5 is uh 30 and then it gives the 210 characters right so this is basically how you can use it now you can use certain FL Flags uh in your WC command which will give you specifically what you want so for example you want to print only the number of by then you can just write a flag called WC minus C and this is going to print only the number of bytes or essentially the number of characters right and just print and just print the number of uh characters which is 210 here right similarly if you want uh to um you know count the number of lines you can just say minus L and then press press enter and it gives you number of lines here right or you can uh use uh the W character or W uh you know flag here it's going to give you the number of words okay and uh you can also use uh uh flag called capital L and this capital L prints the length of the longest line for example I'm going to uh just give uh some more uh words here for example uh words words so this is essentially going to uh give you the length of this line because this is the longest line here right so we can just press enter and you can see it gives the number of uh characters in the longest line which is this one in our case Okay so these are the flag you can use with WC command I hope you enjoyed this video please wait comment subscribe and bye for now
