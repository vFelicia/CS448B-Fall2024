00:00 - Carol welcome to programming knowledge
00:01 - hope you're all doing good so today we
00:04 - are going to see the tutorial for which
00:06 - is called view so let's get started
00:09 - let's crawl you so all of you provide
00:13 - this crawlable view you can scroll
00:15 - through x axis as well as y axis on the
00:17 - screen it's like you have your own
00:20 - application in your mobile phone or
00:22 - Windows where you want to scroll the
00:24 - screen to view the next items which are
00:27 - available on the screen I like to
00:31 - provide an example how it looks like
00:33 - here we go this is a scroll view where
00:36 - you can scroll up or scroll down as you
00:43 - can see you can scroll down and scholar
00:46 - which is an example of it so let's now
00:51 - see how the code is done for the scroll
00:54 - view
00:55 - first of all we'll import a new function
00:58 - called run touch app which is available
01:00 - in classic TV library when we are
01:05 - importing the run touch app it enables
01:07 - the scroll view touch the code for that
01:09 - is from Kiwi torpase import run touch
01:12 - app then we'll import a builder where we
01:17 - define values values such as the text
01:20 - and then its size height and the scroll
01:24 - view x-axis value y axis value all the
01:28 - stuff so we are we are going to define
01:29 - in the builder for using that we are
01:33 - going to import builder from Q dot Lang
01:37 - which is another class library file so
01:44 - let's see the overall code how it works
01:50 - so as I said we are going to first
01:53 - import run touch app which will enable
01:56 - the scroll view on the screen we are
02:00 - going to take that from Cuba dot base
02:02 - and then we are going to import the
02:04 - Builder which is available in Q dot Lang
02:06 - which is again a class library file
02:09 - after that the second step we are going
02:12 - to look out is we are going to create a
02:14 - route variable in which we are going to
02:17 - use the builder and open the scroll new
02:21 - by writing scroll view and then we are
02:24 - going to create a label in which we are
02:26 - going to store the text which is scroll
02:30 - the example it will be displayed on the
02:32 - screen and I have provided in two
02:34 - hundred which means scroll new example
02:37 - of hundred text will be displayed on the
02:40 - screen I am doing this just to make sure
02:43 - that when I am going to scroll the
02:45 - screen all I can see is the text
02:48 - available a scroll view example next we
02:52 - are going to define the font size of the
02:54 - text which is I have given thirty then
02:59 - I'm going to define the size underscore
03:03 - hint underscores equals one point 0
03:05 - which is the x axis of the screen and
03:07 - then size underscore hint underscore I I
03:10 - have mentioned is a it has none next I
03:14 - am going to define the text underscore
03:16 - size value which I am defining self dot
03:19 - length and followed by a pod at the
03:22 - other value as none then I am going to
03:26 - define the height which is self dot
03:28 - texture underscore size of one after
03:31 - defining all the text in the label which
03:34 - is available in the scroll view which I
03:38 - have kept it under the variable rule I
03:41 - am going to close the bracket which I
03:45 - have opened in build third or load
03:48 - underscore string after doing that I am
03:51 - going to run the touch app by defining
03:54 - run touch app and in the parentheses I
03:57 - am going to give the variable Road so
04:01 - this is how the coding is done once I am
04:04 - running the cool what will happen it
04:08 - will come over here the root variable
04:11 - and it will come into the scroll view
04:13 - and it will create a text which is
04:16 - called you example in two hundred and it
04:19 - will have a font size of 30 followed by
04:25 - underscore hint underscore X which is
04:27 - one point zero and take size with
04:29 - yourself don't wait let's now go ahead
04:32 - and run the program it's gonna enable
04:48 - the scroll view as mentioned before TV
04:54 - door clang I'm going to import filter so
05:00 - we have imported the turn touch app and
05:02 - the Builder now we are going to use the
05:05 - Builder inside the variable route where
05:08 - we are going to define the text it's
05:10 - full size font size of X a Y value axis
05:14 - followed by a text size and the height
05:17 - now we have created the route variable
05:19 - and we are going to define we will take
05:24 - the builder followed by note underscore
05:29 - spring and by opening the package I am
05:34 - going to join our and three codes know
05:41 - what I'm going to do I am going to open
05:44 - the scroll view and put the colon
05:48 - followed by I am going to label in which
05:58 - I am going to define the text let's say
06:03 - as scroll example and I'm going to
06:13 - multiply this with hundred as I am going
06:17 - to make sure that scold view example is
06:21 - spilled all over the screen when I am
06:23 - rolling down the screens called the
06:25 - example should be there it is an example
06:27 - program so now they are going to
06:31 - find the font size as burnt underscore
06:35 - size and the value would be 30 and I'm
06:42 - going to write the x axis value
06:44 - providing price underscore hint
06:47 - underscore X that's one point zero
06:51 - similarly for y I'm going to give this
06:57 - as let's say none - I'm taking this as
07:08 - none okay let's make some partitions so
07:25 - here we go we have to find the x value y
07:29 - value
07:30 - what is its remaining the text size
07:33 - which is text underscore size and it
07:37 - should be self underscore self but with
07:43 - some of the other value I'm giving it as
07:46 - none and last but not the least the
07:51 - height for defining the height I'm going
07:53 - to self dot texture underscore size of
08:03 - one here we go
08:09 - so finally we
08:11 - find everything now I'm going to Tendo
08:17 - matter giving the codes here we go
08:23 - we have defined the height deck size
08:26 - x-value and y-value axis then font size
08:30 - and the school you text no let's run the
08:36 - program by calling the run to charity
08:38 - and passing on the route variable which
08:42 - we have defined here we go
08:47 - I have run the program okay here we go
08:51 - we got the output as you can see I have
08:55 - defined scroll textview whole view
08:58 - example into 100 so like the hundred
09:02 - text or visible right now is an example
09:05 - scroll view so as you can see I can
09:11 - scroll down by just moving the mouse
09:14 - scroll and scroll down this is how we
09:20 - have got the output of scroll your
09:22 - example now let's go back and discuss
09:25 - the program how this output came every
09:31 - comb as you can see what we did first we
09:37 - imported the Renta jab and the Builder
09:40 - to run toe tap will enable the scroll
09:43 - view and builder is used to to store all
09:45 - the stuffs you have defined
09:48 - no once I have imported the run touch
09:51 - app and builder we created the route
09:54 - variable and by I have and we have taken
09:57 - the builder and don't load under string
09:59 - and we have created the Skoll view
10:01 - followed by label in the table we have
10:03 - defined the text font size font size
10:06 - underscore hint underscore X and size
10:08 - under storing data score Y which is the
10:10 - X and y axis and then we have defined
10:13 - the text size and the height so we
10:16 - defined all the properties of the text
10:18 - and the screen size and the table which
10:21 - is coming under the scroll view and
10:24 - and he closed the bracket with the three
10:29 - coats and we run the program by calling
10:33 - the Honda chap and in the parenthesis we
10:36 - pass the arguments or route it is a
10:38 - variable then followed by running the
10:42 - program we get the output of this
10:43 - quality example so that's it for today
10:47 - hope decision was clear we'll see in the
10:52 - coming lectures other views and labels
10:55 - all the stars other like the stuffs
10:59 - which are available in library thank you
11:01 - for joining with programming knowledge
11:02 - have a good day guys
