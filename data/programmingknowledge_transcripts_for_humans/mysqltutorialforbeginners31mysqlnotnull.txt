00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:02 - knowledge in this video we will see what
00:04 - is the use of not null constraint by
00:08 - default a column can hold null values
00:11 - but if we assign not null constraint to
00:16 - a particular column that then it
00:19 - enforces a column do not accept null
00:22 - values there can be many Siana juice you
00:26 - can consider our scenario in which there
00:28 - is a table called employee table which
00:31 - holds the information about employee
00:34 - working our particular company or
00:36 - organization in which employee table has
00:40 - three column let's say the first one is
00:42 - employee ID name and third one is last
00:46 - name which is certainly so surname
00:51 - cannot be null employee ID will be have
00:54 - a primary key so remember one thing
00:56 - whenever you declare a primary key or
00:59 - assigned primary key constraint to any
01:02 - of the column then my skill by default
01:06 - assigned not null constraint to that
01:08 - because primary key cannot be null as we
01:12 - have seen earlier in our videos so son
01:16 - and cannot be enough there has to be a
01:19 - surname employ must have a surname so we
01:23 - can add constraint like not null to that
01:26 - particular column as also if there is a
01:29 - column which holds the age of the
01:32 - employee then it cannot be none so let
01:37 - us see one example first of all open my
01:41 - SQL work meant so we create one table
01:50 - create table the name of the table let's
01:56 - say employee
02:01 - first one is the ID which is employee ID
02:05 - the second one is named working at 40
02:13 - the third one is last name where can
02:23 - also total now primary key which is in
02:33 - the cave is EAD okay
02:36 - now we want to assign not null
02:40 - constraint to last minute
02:42 - then after specifying t better I simply
02:46 - write node 9 and X equity spend refresh
02:55 - over here and you can see table is
02:59 - created Yeti name and lastly if we want
03:07 - to see the structure then you've
03:08 - described
03:18 - here you can see null constraint and
03:22 - last name no it means that last and
03:26 - cannot be done let us insert some values
03:29 - insert into table name employee
03:35 - let's say values 1 ID name and scarcer
03:48 - name okay it is successfully inserted
03:58 - because we have provide all the values
04:01 - let me insert on a third account and
04:05 - this time I won't provide surname and
04:11 - play in insert query when we have talked
04:16 - about it in our video earlier videos I
04:19 - told you that if you want to insert
04:23 - values I mean only specific columns not
04:27 - all the columns and you have to
04:29 - explicitly provide the column names so I
04:33 - want to insert only IOD in name values
04:41 - to name let's say mark let us say
04:49 - whatever
04:50 - as you can see insert into employee ID
04:54 - values to mark error code okay a one
05:03 - second GID sorry for that and inserted
05:11 - here you can see fin last name doesn't
05:14 - have a defined value it means and we
05:18 - have provide North null constraint to
05:21 - the last name and so we have to provide
05:25 - some content we cannot left it black
05:30 - so this is how you can use normal
05:33 - constrain thanks for watching
