00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Java programming for
00:04 - beginners in this video we will see what
00:07 - is a method and how to use a method in
00:13 - Java methods are also called functions
00:17 - in other languages so if I use function
00:21 - or method they can be used
00:24 - interchangeably okay but in Java this uh
00:29 - method
00:30 - is preferred or method keyword is
00:33 - preferred so first of all what is a
00:36 - method a method is a piece of code which
00:41 - executes some logic and you can wrap
00:45 - this method with a
00:47 - name and you can call this method again
00:51 - and again whenever you want to use it
00:54 - now how to use a method first of all for
00:58 - your information this main is also a
01:02 - method which uh every Java program has
01:07 - this I have told you in the initial
01:09 - videos right so in this same
01:12 - method this is you know Java is
01:16 - expecting us to
01:18 - provide and our method name should not
01:22 - be main because there should be only one
01:24 - main method in any Java program okay but
01:30 - other than Main and reserved name in
01:34 - Java you can Define any name to a method
01:38 - so first of all let's see what is the
01:40 - basic syntax of a
01:42 - method so we just give first of all the
01:48 - access specifier to our method which is
01:52 - public like this and then
01:56 - static so don't worry about these public
02:00 - and static because we will see these
02:03 - keywords in detail in the later videos
02:06 - whenever we will see how to use classes
02:09 - but then starts this return value which
02:13 - is the part of the method and then comes
02:16 - the name of the method for example
02:20 - my
02:23 - first method okay and then comes these
02:27 - brackets in these brackets we can pass
02:30 - some parameter but for the first time
02:34 - because it's a introduction I just want
02:36 - to leave them empty they can be left
02:40 - empty or you can pass parameters like
02:44 - int a something like this in here but uh
02:47 - for now for Simplicity I will leave them
02:51 - uh you know
02:53 - blank so this is the simplest kind of
02:56 - method so what are these first first of
03:00 - all public static is called the exess
03:04 - specifier and public keyword tells uh
03:08 - your class or Java that it's accessible
03:13 - anywhere inside your class okay and then
03:17 - void is the return type right now we are
03:20 - not returning anything that's why we
03:23 - write here void but I will show you in
03:26 - the further videos how to return value
03:28 - using method
03:30 - and in that we will see more options
03:33 - other than void with this method and
03:37 - then comes the method name and in these
03:42 - uh circular brackets or round brackets
03:46 - comes the argument for now we are not
03:49 - passing any argument and then in these
03:51 - curly Braes comes your statement for
03:55 - example we want to execute or we want to
03:57 - print some uh some message
04:00 - so
04:02 - system do out
04:05 - do print
04:08 - line and we just
04:14 - write
04:15 - hello
04:17 - YouTube okay and this is the basic
04:21 - syntax or code which you want to write
04:24 - or which you want to execute using this
04:28 - method now you can call this method in
04:32 - your main method
04:35 - here and you don't need to execute or
04:39 - print anything you can just call this
04:41 - method as it is uh you just need to copy
04:45 - the name of the method like this and
04:48 - then provide these two round brackets
04:52 - okay and then when you run the
04:55 - program it will print hello YouTube so
04:58 - we are not not if you notice we are not
05:01 - directly printing in our main method
05:04 - hello YouTube but we are calling the
05:07 - function with a function name and then
05:10 - it prints hello YouTube okay and the
05:15 - biggest advantage of using this function
05:18 - or method is it will make your code
05:22 - really readable and really concise and
05:28 - it will make your code look good okay
05:32 - and understandable so for example you
05:35 - want to call this method again and again
05:37 - inside your function you can call it and
05:41 - you don't need to write any further code
05:44 - right it will print hello YouTube five
05:47 - times so you can call a method again and
05:50 - again in inside your main method and
05:54 - without writing rewriting the same code
05:57 - again and again so the basic basic rule
06:00 - of thumb is when you decide to write a
06:04 - method whenever you have the code which
06:08 - is you know which you want to write
06:11 - again and again then you may wrap it
06:16 - inside a method and this will help you
06:20 - to reduce the lines of code which will
06:24 - you write okay for example this code
06:28 - contains five
06:30 - lines okay so and we don't want to write
06:36 - these five lines again and again because
06:38 - for example this code method contains
06:42 - five lines and if we have to do it
06:46 - without the method we have to do it you
06:49 - know just like this and we want to call
06:52 - it if once again these five lines of
06:55 - code again in our main method then we
06:59 - need need to write it something like
07:01 - this and this and this will make your
07:03 - code really lengthy and uh whenever your
07:07 - code becomes really R lengthy it will be
07:10 - hard to read your code okay and what
07:14 - this method is doing it's just making
07:17 - your code with you know execute with
07:21 - just single line of a code okay so this
07:25 - is the real advantage of method and you
07:30 - should give really logical name to your
07:33 - method so that it's understandable and
07:36 - then uh you know any other person if he
07:40 - is reading your code he will be able to
07:43 - understand your code also okay so this
07:47 - is the basic form of method in Java
07:50 - there are other kinds of uh methods for
07:52 - example method which takes arguments
07:55 - method which Returns value which I will
07:57 - show you in the next video please please
07:59 - stay tuned and please wait com subscribe
08:02 - and bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Java programming for beginners in this video we will see what is a method and how to use a method in Java methods are also called functions in other languages so if I use function or method they can be used interchangeably okay but in Java this uh method is preferred or method keyword is preferred so first of all what is a method a method is a piece of code which executes some logic and you can wrap this method with a name and you can call this method again and again whenever you want to use it now how to use a method first of all for your information this main is also a method which uh every Java program has this I have told you in the initial videos right so in this same method this is you know Java is expecting us to provide and our method name should not be main because there should be only one main method in any Java program okay but other than Main and reserved name in Java you can Define any name to a method so first of all let's see what is the basic syntax of a method so we just give first of all the access specifier to our method which is public like this and then static so don't worry about these public and static because we will see these keywords in detail in the later videos whenever we will see how to use classes but then starts this return value which is the part of the method and then comes the name of the method for example my first method okay and then comes these brackets in these brackets we can pass some parameter but for the first time because it's a introduction I just want to leave them empty they can be left empty or you can pass parameters like int a something like this in here but uh for now for Simplicity I will leave them uh you know blank so this is the simplest kind of method so what are these first first of all public static is called the exess specifier and public keyword tells uh your class or Java that it's accessible anywhere inside your class okay and then void is the return type right now we are not returning anything that's why we write here void but I will show you in the further videos how to return value using method and in that we will see more options other than void with this method and then comes the method name and in these uh circular brackets or round brackets comes the argument for now we are not passing any argument and then in these curly Braes comes your statement for example we want to execute or we want to print some uh some message so system do out do print line and we just write hello YouTube okay and this is the basic syntax or code which you want to write or which you want to execute using this method now you can call this method in your main method here and you don't need to execute or print anything you can just call this method as it is uh you just need to copy the name of the method like this and then provide these two round brackets okay and then when you run the program it will print hello YouTube so we are not not if you notice we are not directly printing in our main method hello YouTube but we are calling the function with a function name and then it prints hello YouTube okay and the biggest advantage of using this function or method is it will make your code really readable and really concise and it will make your code look good okay and understandable so for example you want to call this method again and again inside your function you can call it and you don't need to write any further code right it will print hello YouTube five times so you can call a method again and again in inside your main method and without writing rewriting the same code again and again so the basic basic rule of thumb is when you decide to write a method whenever you have the code which is you know which you want to write again and again then you may wrap it inside a method and this will help you to reduce the lines of code which will you write okay for example this code contains five lines okay so and we don't want to write these five lines again and again because for example this code method contains five lines and if we have to do it without the method we have to do it you know just like this and we want to call it if once again these five lines of code again in our main method then we need need to write it something like this and this and this will make your code really lengthy and uh whenever your code becomes really R lengthy it will be hard to read your code okay and what this method is doing it's just making your code with you know execute with just single line of a code okay so this is the real advantage of method and you should give really logical name to your method so that it's understandable and then uh you know any other person if he is reading your code he will be able to understand your code also okay so this is the basic form of method in Java there are other kinds of uh methods for example method which takes arguments method which Returns value which I will show you in the next video please please stay tuned and please wait com subscribe and bye for now
