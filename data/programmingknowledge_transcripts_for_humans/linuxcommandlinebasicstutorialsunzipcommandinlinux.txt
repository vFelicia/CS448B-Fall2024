With timestamps:

00:00 - and now in this video we will start with
00:01 - the
00:02 - most basic command that is unzip command
00:05 - okay
00:06 - so uh first how we will start uh i will
00:09 - create a one directory
00:12 - that is uh sorry mkdir zip
00:17 - and i will move into that particular
00:19 - directory and i will create some files
00:22 - one dot txt
00:24 - uh so sorry two dot txt
00:28 - three dot txt okay now these three files
00:30 - has been created now what i like to do i
00:33 - want to zip
00:34 - all these three files in
00:38 - one particular
00:40 - zip file okay
00:42 - so
00:43 - 1.2 xt 2.txt
00:47 - 3.txt and i want to zip all these in a
00:50 - single file that is
00:53 - file start sip
00:55 - okay
00:56 - all has been added i will do ls here you
00:58 - can see files.zip and uh for your
01:00 - reference i will open up this directory
01:02 - and here you can see all these files and
01:04 - the files are there in the tag in this
01:06 - directory so now in this particular we
01:09 - are going to study about
01:11 - unchip how you can unzip these
01:13 - particular files and particular zip
01:16 - files okay so the most basic and
01:19 - simple uh
01:21 - like
01:22 - command that is unzip we used to like
01:26 - extract files of this particular zip
01:28 - file
01:29 - so how we can do it we will just use
01:31 - unzip and the particular file name
01:34 - sorry
01:36 - and here you can see it is asking me for
01:38 - do you want to replace or not okay so i
01:41 - will just hit ctrl c right now
01:44 - okay
01:45 - uh because i don't want to create any
01:47 - confusion for you guys first what i will
01:50 - do i will just create all uh remove all
01:52 - these one dot txt or dot txt and three
01:55 - dot txt files i have now deleted all
01:58 - these files
01:59 - now what now i will use unzip and the
02:02 - files dot zip and it will simply like
02:05 - extract all the files which are present
02:07 - in this file.chip for your reference let
02:09 - me open it
02:11 - so you can see
02:12 - what are the files is present so here
02:14 - you can see these are the three files
02:15 - which are present in this particular
02:18 - zip file so i will hit this command
02:20 - and done we you have simply extracted
02:23 - all the files of that particular filezip
02:25 - file okay
02:26 - so this is a very simple way to extract
02:29 - files
02:30 - and now moving forward uh suppose like
02:34 - you want to use these files and these
02:37 - 1.2.3.txt in some kind of another
02:39 - locations uh suppose in many cases you
02:41 - want to store these files in some other
02:43 - directories okay
02:44 - so uh how you can do it uh
02:47 - without like
02:49 - extracting all these files in the same
02:51 - directory in which your files are chip
02:53 - so but you can extract this file in some
02:56 - other directories also so how you can do
02:58 - it this is very simple now what i will
03:00 - do uh i will open up a new terminal
03:02 - or okay let me open up a new terminal
03:14 - let me increase a little bit of font
03:16 - size for you and
03:19 - i will create
03:22 - one for that extracted files
03:25 - okay
03:26 - i'll move into this folder and i will
03:29 - copy the whole path that is home i use
03:31 - extracted files
03:33 - okay
03:36 - in
03:37 - this terminal you can copy by ctrl shift
03:40 - c
03:41 - okay i will just move it to here
03:44 - now what uh if you want to like unzip
03:47 - the files in some particular directory
03:49 - so for this we use basically hyphen d
03:52 - option okay in this we will provide the
03:55 - path of that particular
04:01 - particular directory where you want to
04:03 - store that particular uh extracted files
04:06 - so unzip and then the file name which
04:08 - you want that is files.chip and hyphen d
04:11 - and then ctrl shift v and here we want
04:14 - our
04:15 - files in this extracted files directory
04:18 - okay
04:19 - now what we we will do here i will do
04:22 - just a list in this particular terminal
04:23 - and here you can see all of these files
04:26 - has been
04:27 - like uh extracted in this particular
04:30 - directory so in this way also like you
04:32 - can store your
04:34 - instructor files in some kind of another
04:36 - directory okay so this is another simple
04:39 - trick
04:40 - like which
04:43 - you should know about it
04:44 - and also there are many options like uh
04:48 - suppose in case what happens you have
04:51 - extracted your files uh
04:53 - zip file already but sometimes also what
04:55 - happens
04:56 - you accidentally click on it so in this
04:59 - case in linux what happens when you try
05:02 - to like unzip files and in the same
05:05 - directory or you can say in
05:07 - another
05:08 - so here you can see we have already
05:10 - these files one two three dot txt what
05:13 - what where what will happen when i will
05:16 - try to hit the same command again so it
05:18 - will ask me for do you want to override
05:20 - these files or none or nothing or else
05:22 - okay i said uh i will say yes okay
05:26 - and again it is asking for 1.2 xt again
05:29 - i will say yes again for two dot txt and
05:32 - three dot text okay yes
05:34 - so again these all the files has been
05:37 - replaced
05:38 - okay in case if i
05:40 - would made any changes in this well then
05:42 - i will definitely choose no because
05:45 - i don't want to create any kind of
05:47 - problem for myself okay
05:50 - so uh like this is the basic uh options
05:54 - which we can use to unzip files and also
05:56 - uh like you should know about one more
05:58 - option that is uh
06:00 - hyphen queue option what is it okay
06:03 - i will show you by uh first what i will
06:05 - do i will remove the all these one dot
06:08 - and all these files from this directory
06:12 - okay
06:14 - so here you can see there's all the
06:16 - files draw chip what basically in simple
06:18 - case what happens when i do
06:21 - it will show me these messages okay
06:23 - extracting these files extracting to
06:26 - text extracting 0.txt
06:28 - uh in some cases we don't want these
06:31 - kind of information because we know it
06:33 - will simply extract the files so for
06:35 - this what we can use we can do just uh
06:37 - hyphen q option
06:41 - iphone queue and then
06:43 - file store zip it will uh just avoid
06:46 - like it will not print any kind of extra
06:49 - things
06:50 - so uh
06:51 - for
06:52 - before hitting this command
06:54 - i'll try to again remove all those files
06:56 - and now
06:58 - i will use
07:00 - hyphen key option
07:02 - and done
07:03 - so in this case we didn't get any kind
07:05 - of
07:06 - information or any kind of messes like
07:08 - whether this file has been extracted or
07:10 - not okay now again let me remove it and
07:13 - i will again tell you one more option
07:15 - that is hyphen l option basically if you
07:17 - are aware of ls command so you will
07:18 - definitely know about either ls iphone
07:21 - option
07:22 - which basically like list all the
07:25 - uh
07:26 - means list the files in a long format
07:29 - okay you can say like we get many kind
07:31 - of things like date time user guest
07:33 - not guest uh groups user groups
07:36 - access time modify time we get all those
07:39 - kind of information and simply uh you
07:41 - can say permissions also like we will
07:43 - have a separate lecture on permissions
07:44 - okay
07:46 - so now what we can do unzip hyphen l and
07:48 - again i will try to unzip these files
07:50 - uh it is looking so much like
07:54 - so much stuff other let me clear first
07:56 - in screen now again i will write ng by
07:58 - funnel and then file store zip and here
08:01 - you can see the
08:02 - more extra information about the
08:04 - extracted files
08:05 - you can see the length the length is
08:07 - zero
08:08 - and
08:10 - date time name all these things all
08:14 - these things okay
08:15 - so it basically doesn't extract but it
08:17 - simply shows you the whatever the files
08:20 - are present in the particular
08:22 - uh
08:23 - zip file so okay
08:26 - so that's it for today

Cleaned transcript:

and now in this video we will start with the most basic command that is unzip command okay so uh first how we will start uh i will create a one directory that is uh sorry mkdir zip and i will move into that particular directory and i will create some files one dot txt uh so sorry two dot txt three dot txt okay now these three files has been created now what i like to do i want to zip all these three files in one particular zip file okay so 1.2 xt 2.txt 3.txt and i want to zip all these in a single file that is file start sip okay all has been added i will do ls here you can see files.zip and uh for your reference i will open up this directory and here you can see all these files and the files are there in the tag in this directory so now in this particular we are going to study about unchip how you can unzip these particular files and particular zip files okay so the most basic and simple uh like command that is unzip we used to like extract files of this particular zip file so how we can do it we will just use unzip and the particular file name sorry and here you can see it is asking me for do you want to replace or not okay so i will just hit ctrl c right now okay uh because i don't want to create any confusion for you guys first what i will do i will just create all uh remove all these one dot txt or dot txt and three dot txt files i have now deleted all these files now what now i will use unzip and the files dot zip and it will simply like extract all the files which are present in this file.chip for your reference let me open it so you can see what are the files is present so here you can see these are the three files which are present in this particular zip file so i will hit this command and done we you have simply extracted all the files of that particular filezip file okay so this is a very simple way to extract files and now moving forward uh suppose like you want to use these files and these 1.2.3.txt in some kind of another locations uh suppose in many cases you want to store these files in some other directories okay so uh how you can do it uh without like extracting all these files in the same directory in which your files are chip so but you can extract this file in some other directories also so how you can do it this is very simple now what i will do uh i will open up a new terminal or okay let me open up a new terminal let me increase a little bit of font size for you and i will create one for that extracted files okay i'll move into this folder and i will copy the whole path that is home i use extracted files okay in this terminal you can copy by ctrl shift c okay i will just move it to here now what uh if you want to like unzip the files in some particular directory so for this we use basically hyphen d option okay in this we will provide the path of that particular particular directory where you want to store that particular uh extracted files so unzip and then the file name which you want that is files.chip and hyphen d and then ctrl shift v and here we want our files in this extracted files directory okay now what we we will do here i will do just a list in this particular terminal and here you can see all of these files has been like uh extracted in this particular directory so in this way also like you can store your instructor files in some kind of another directory okay so this is another simple trick like which you should know about it and also there are many options like uh suppose in case what happens you have extracted your files uh zip file already but sometimes also what happens you accidentally click on it so in this case in linux what happens when you try to like unzip files and in the same directory or you can say in another so here you can see we have already these files one two three dot txt what what where what will happen when i will try to hit the same command again so it will ask me for do you want to override these files or none or nothing or else okay i said uh i will say yes okay and again it is asking for 1.2 xt again i will say yes again for two dot txt and three dot text okay yes so again these all the files has been replaced okay in case if i would made any changes in this well then i will definitely choose no because i don't want to create any kind of problem for myself okay so uh like this is the basic uh options which we can use to unzip files and also uh like you should know about one more option that is uh hyphen queue option what is it okay i will show you by uh first what i will do i will remove the all these one dot and all

extracting to text extracting 0.txt uh in some cases we don't want these kind of information because we know it will simply extract the files so for this what we can use we can do just uh hyphen q option iphone queue and then file store zip it will uh just avoid like it will not print any kind of extra things so uh for before hitting this command i'll try to again remove all those files and now i will use hyphen key option and done so in this case we didn't get any kind of information or any kind of messes like whether this file has been extracted or not okay now again let me remove it and i will again tell you one more option that is hyphen l option basically if you are aware of ls command so you will definitely know about either ls iphone option which basically like list all the uh means list the files in a long format okay you can say like we get many kind of things like date time user guest not guest uh groups user groups access time modify time we get all those kind of information and simply uh you can say permissions also like we will have a separate lecture on permissions okay so now what we can do unzip hyphen l and again i will try to unzip these files uh it is looking so much like so much stuff other let me clear first in screen now again i will write ng by funnel and then file store zip and here you can see the more extra information about the extracted files you can see the length the length is zero and date time name all these things all these things okay so it basically doesn't extract but it simply shows you the whatever the files are present in the particular uh zip file so okay so that's it for today
