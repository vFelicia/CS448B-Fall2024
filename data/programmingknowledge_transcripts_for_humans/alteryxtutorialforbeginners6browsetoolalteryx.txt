00:00 - in this video we are going to start
00:02 - discussing about the important tools in
00:06 - altrex the tools that would help you
00:08 - carry out the different tasks that are
00:11 - really important throughout your altrex
00:13 - journey
00:14 - so uh without any further ado let us
00:17 - start with this video
00:18 - first of all before jumping into the
00:20 - tools part let us download the data set
00:24 - now this data set that we are going to
00:25 - download is going to be used throughout
00:28 - this course so
00:30 - it is important for you to have a copy
00:33 - of this data set for you as well
00:36 - so how do we download this uh first of
00:38 - all what you need to do is simply google
00:39 - sample superstore data set like i have
00:41 - googled over here
00:43 - now once you do that the first link that
00:45 - would come up would be a tableau
00:46 - community so let's just click on this
00:48 - link
00:51 - and
00:52 - this is actually a data set that has the
00:56 - different types of information like the
00:59 - five data types of alteryx that we have
01:01 - just learned are all supported in this
01:03 - particular data set it has around 10 000
01:06 - records so it is easier for you to
01:09 - understand the concepts and practice it
01:11 - on this kind of a data set it is
01:13 - available for free so you can use it as
01:16 - many times as you want now once this
01:18 - link is open here you can see this is an
01:20 - excel file you can just simply click on
01:22 - download and store it into the location
01:25 - that you want so since i have already
01:27 - downloaded it over here sample
01:28 - superstore.xlx
01:30 - as you can see so i'm not going to
01:32 - re-download it but you can just save it
01:35 - now once you have downloaded the data
01:36 - set let's come back to our ultrix tool
01:39 - here today i am going to discuss about
01:42 - the browse tool in ultrix now the browse
01:45 - tool is a really important tool and here
01:47 - i have actually implemented the browse
01:49 - tool but what i am going to do is just
01:52 - delete all of this functionality and
01:54 - show you once again that how it is
01:55 - working okay
01:58 - so first of all let's understand what is
01:59 - a browse tool as you can see uh we have
02:02 - in this favorites tab the browse tool is
02:03 - available but if you
02:05 - check the in out tab that's where the
02:08 - browse tool would be present okay
02:10 - so the browse tool is used to view the
02:12 - data from a connected tool what do you
02:14 - mean by a connected tool that means the
02:16 - browse tool if you just bring it over
02:18 - here like this then it won't be able to
02:20 - show you some data it needs some kind of
02:22 - a tool
02:23 - so browse tool is actually a connected
02:25 - tool
02:27 - okay so we can see the data profile
02:31 - for multiple columns at once in a single
02:33 - holistic view or for a single column of
02:35 - the data
02:37 - we can
02:38 - see the information on a data type the
02:41 - number of records the quality of the
02:42 - data and a variety of other statistics
02:45 - as well using the browse tool
02:48 - in case of a spatial report or a
02:50 - behavioral data analysis
02:52 - the type is connected an additional tab
02:54 - is available in the browse tool
02:56 - that shows the preview of the actual
02:59 - object on a map or a report okay
03:02 - so browse rule if you just bring it up
03:05 - let's
03:06 - understand this
03:07 - this uh thing that's green over here is
03:10 - known as an anchor it has one anchor
03:13 - that is the input anchor now if you just
03:15 - bring up this input data tool which we
03:17 - have already used you can see it also
03:19 - has one anchor but it has in the shape
03:22 - of the anchor of the browse tool and the
03:24 - input tool is different so the input
03:26 - tool has an output anchor that means the
03:29 - input tool contains the data and it
03:31 - gives its data to some other tool browse
03:34 - tool on the other hand
03:36 - cannot exist independently it needs some
03:38 - other tool to exist that's why it takes
03:40 - the data from some other tool and to
03:43 - take the data from some other tool it
03:44 - needs an anchor that's why to use the
03:47 - browse tool at least the input tool
03:49 - should be present so that it acts as an
03:51 - input anchor and this acts as a
03:53 - receiving anchor for itself okay
03:56 - so
03:57 - let us now see how can we uh use the
03:59 - data or use the browse tool to show the
04:02 - data the data profile okay so first of
04:05 - all uh we have this input tool using
04:07 - this input tool what i'm gonna do is
04:09 - actually import a file into ultrix okay
04:12 - the sample superstore data set file that
04:14 - we have just
04:15 - downloaded that is the file that i'm
04:17 - going to import so let's go to file
04:21 - and select file
04:23 - here is the sample superstore file
04:25 - let us open it
04:27 - now it asks for a sheet so the order
04:29 - sheet is what i'm going to go with let's
04:31 - just click on ok
04:33 - so after a few seconds you can see that
04:36 - here in the configuration panel we have
04:38 - this whole data set right now only a
04:41 - hundred rows are being shown over here
04:42 - if we just run this workflow
04:45 - then we would be able to see it in the
04:49 - output column
04:50 - but the output would not be shown over
04:52 - here right now
04:58 - and these kind of errors would be
05:00 - opening why because of the browse tool
05:03 - we have used the browse tool but not
05:05 - actually provided a connection to it so
05:07 - let's see how do we work with it
05:11 - how do we
05:12 - you know
05:14 - work around it okay so let's just first
05:16 - close this message
05:18 - now what we are going to do is connect
05:20 - these two anchors like
05:21 - this drag from the input anchor and drop
05:24 - it to the browse tool anchor
05:26 - right now it's going to take a few
05:28 - seconds
05:29 - and again if we just run the workflow
05:33 - then it's going to take a few seconds
05:35 - and then the information would be shown
05:37 - you can see the percentage of the work
05:39 - that's been done
05:41 - and once all the work has been done you
05:43 - would get this kind of a message let's
05:45 - click on ok
05:46 - now the information being shown in the
05:48 - configuration panel is with relevant to
05:50 - the input data tool if we just click on
05:52 - the browse tool then right now nothing
05:54 - is being shown because we have not
05:55 - selected any of the records right if you
05:57 - remember i just told you that uh you
06:00 - have to select at least one column or
06:02 - you can select multiple columns as well
06:04 - so that the information is being shown
06:07 - to you okay so let us just select some
06:09 - column or let's say the category column
06:12 - if we just select this category column
06:13 - from here
06:15 - then wait for a few seconds and the
06:17 - information or the report of the
06:19 - category column or the data profile of
06:21 - the category column would be shown in
06:23 - this configuration panel okay
06:26 - so this is the data profile of the
06:28 - category column that has been shown over
06:30 - here
06:33 - just a second
06:37 - yeah
06:37 - so um
06:40 - we just select the category column here
06:42 - it is being shown
06:44 - and as you can see the data type first
06:46 - it has taken is the variable string so
06:49 - that means the
06:50 - uh length is variable to just save the
06:53 - memory space the total number of records
06:55 - the size that has been taken is 255
06:58 - bytes okay
06:59 - now out of the total 909 994 records the
07:04 - total records that are okay is all the
07:07 - records are okay here you can see the
07:08 - number of records that are okay and the
07:10 - percentage so 100 records are okay
07:13 - unique means how many different values
07:15 - are there so as you can see we are
07:16 - getting three over here that means the
07:19 - three possible values for category are
07:21 - furniture office supplies and technology
07:24 - that is being shown over here
07:25 - then we have some of these statistics of
07:27 - the length so the minimum length of the
07:29 - value is 9 as you can see it should be
07:32 - furniture
07:33 - then the maximum is 15 which is for
07:35 - office space supplies
07:37 - then uh we have the shortest value which
07:39 - is furniture of course longest value is
07:41 - office underscore supplies
07:43 - then we have the first alphanumeric
07:45 - value that is the first value that you
07:47 - are getting is furniture and the last
07:48 - record must be having the category as
07:51 - office supplies right
07:54 - as technology uh there are no blanks
07:57 - that means the particular column is
08:00 - clean it has no inconsistent data
08:02 - there is no leading white space and
08:04 - there is no trailing white space now
08:05 - there is another reason of choosing this
08:07 - particular data set because this is a
08:09 - clean data set it does not have any of
08:10 - the inconsistencies so for us as a
08:13 - beginner it's easier to understand and
08:15 - work with these kind of data sets okay
08:19 - then we have the frequent values
08:21 - so it would tell you that how many um
08:25 - instances of the particular category are
08:27 - there if we talk about office supplies
08:29 - so there are six thousand uh 26 records
08:32 - of the office supplies that is the most
08:34 - number of records for this then we have
08:36 - furniture about 2121 records and
08:39 - technology with 1.8 k records
08:43 - so this is the data profile of the
08:45 - particular column that has been shown
08:47 - over here as you can see the column is
08:49 - uh taken over here as category if we
08:51 - just try to employ sub category as well
08:53 - over here
08:58 - so this is the sub category
09:00 - that we have implied
09:02 - over here right now and now the summary
09:03 - has changed as you can see the number of
09:05 - unique values is 17 now uh so there are
09:08 - 17 subcategories and here is the uh
09:11 - introduction of the individual
09:12 - subcategories the frequent values the
09:14 - graph that is being shown over here
09:16 - there are 12 more values you can expand
09:18 - it and see that what is the occurrence
09:20 - of each of these subcategories okay
09:23 - next we have is the country so the
09:25 - country if you just select on this
09:26 - country column it's all united states
09:30 - right now so
09:31 - i don't think it's going to make any
09:32 - difference then we have the cities which
09:35 - has 531 unique values for the cities and
09:39 - how it has been shown so this is the
09:40 - usage of the browse tool through which
09:42 - it is used to show the different records
09:44 - okay
09:46 - now
09:48 - in order to view multiple values uh what
09:50 - we can do is actually use the left right
09:53 - view or the top bottom view
09:55 - right now subcategory has been selected
09:57 - in this profile but in this profile
09:59 - nothing is being selected as you scroll
10:01 - down you can see that the different
10:03 - columns are being shown over here so
10:05 - suppose i want to show the segment i can
10:07 - just click on segment and the values or
10:09 - the data profile or segment would be
10:11 - shown over here
10:13 - so here you can see the segment it has
10:15 - three unique values
10:17 - consumer home office are the two values
10:19 - and the third value as you can see is
10:21 - the corporate segment so the data
10:23 - profile of two
10:25 - columns are being shown over here using
10:27 - the browse tools simultaneously so
10:29 - that's all about the browse tool that
10:31 - you need to know
10:32 - i hope the concept is clear to you
10:34 - that's all for this video thanks for
10:35 - watching

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we are going to start discussing about the important tools in altrex the tools that would help you carry out the different tasks that are really important throughout your altrex journey so uh without any further ado let us start with this video first of all before jumping into the tools part let us download the data set now this data set that we are going to download is going to be used throughout this course so it is important for you to have a copy of this data set for you as well so how do we download this uh first of all what you need to do is simply google sample superstore data set like i have googled over here now once you do that the first link that would come up would be a tableau community so let's just click on this link and this is actually a data set that has the different types of information like the five data types of alteryx that we have just learned are all supported in this particular data set it has around 10 000 records so it is easier for you to understand the concepts and practice it on this kind of a data set it is available for free so you can use it as many times as you want now once this link is open here you can see this is an excel file you can just simply click on download and store it into the location that you want so since i have already downloaded it over here sample superstore.xlx as you can see so i'm not going to redownload it but you can just save it now once you have downloaded the data set let's come back to our ultrix tool here today i am going to discuss about the browse tool in ultrix now the browse tool is a really important tool and here i have actually implemented the browse tool but what i am going to do is just delete all of this functionality and show you once again that how it is working okay so first of all let's understand what is a browse tool as you can see uh we have in this favorites tab the browse tool is available but if you check the in out tab that's where the browse tool would

here in the configuration panel we have this whole data set right now only a hundred rows are being shown over here if we just run this workflow then we would be able to see it in the output column but the output would not be shown over here right now and these kind of errors would be opening why because of the browse tool we have used the browse tool but not actually provided a connection to it
