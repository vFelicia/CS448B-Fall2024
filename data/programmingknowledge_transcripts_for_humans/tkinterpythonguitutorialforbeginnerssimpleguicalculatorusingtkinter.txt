00:00 - hello guys and welcome to programming
00:01 - knowledge in the previous video or we
00:03 - learned about how to create a simple
00:05 - game that is tic-tac-toe in Python
00:07 - kinder module in this video we'll be
00:10 - seeing about how to how we can create a
00:13 - simple calculator within kinder so the
00:17 - procedure of building the application
00:20 - will be similar to that of tic-tac-toe
00:23 - I'll just show you the code and the
00:26 - certain portions of the code and so
00:29 - let's begin with the initials initially
00:32 - and so first of all we have to import
00:36 - kinto for in geometry i'm place it into
00:39 - a variable and so any title based on
00:42 - your preference you can also use
00:44 - different approaches to it and put a
00:48 - background words so i just run this much
00:51 - of code and show you is there any error
00:54 - or not so there is no error until now
00:59 - now going on forward we'll be using text
01:05 - in that is a string variable for the
01:09 - entry whatever we are going to fade
01:12 - within the entry that is for example in
01:15 - number + 2 or 4 + 4 divided by 2 or
01:20 - something like that we will be using
01:22 - that so text in is basically just a text
01:29 - input which we are providing into the
01:32 - entry field and a empty variable that is
01:36 - of operator variable now we'll be
01:39 - creating our first function that is the
01:42 - button flip function so just tell you
01:49 - what actually is happening within this
01:52 - function so click button with a
01:58 - parameter number so when we click a
02:01 - single of working for example 1 + 2 it
02:05 - is not a single button right 1 2 and the
02:07 - plus button is different so for this
02:10 - basically we are using lambda
02:12 - for each individual button when we will
02:15 - create the widget button I will show you
02:17 - in a minute and then if you want to show
02:21 - that in a format for example into the
02:25 - entry field one plus two so you need to
02:29 - show that input into that entry field
02:32 - for that we are using that function by
02:35 - taking the input from the user when the
02:38 - user clicks a button so it is just
02:41 - concatenating to no inputs given from
02:46 - the user that's it
02:48 - and placing and setting that into the
02:53 - operator so the operator here will hold
02:55 - that value so this is the click button
02:59 - function with the parameter number in
03:01 - general for whatever button is been
03:04 - clipped into that calculator or moving
03:07 - on to the next
03:10 - so for each evaluating operators for
03:16 - example button or sorry addition
03:18 - subtraction multiplication etcetera will
03:21 - be using individual functions so equals
03:27 - button here is basically used for
03:29 - evaluating whether determining and also
03:34 - determining what is that function it is
03:43 - so for example if the operator is
03:47 - performing or the user is performing
03:49 - some addition operation operation is
03:55 - being performed such as addition so the
03:58 - evaluation of evaluator that is an
04:00 - inbuild operator or uses in will
04:07 - procedure for determining that it is an
04:09 - addition operation so here operator will
04:13 - hold that addition operation so that is
04:18 - plus I'll just show you plus so you do
04:22 - not seem over here what is actually
04:23 - going on but it
04:25 - this pinko fine so for such individual
04:30 - operations there is an inducer function
04:35 - for example here this function is for
04:38 - addition right so the Evalia
04:40 - operator is in build within five items
04:42 - and you will determine what operation is
04:45 - being performed over there acid now
04:54 - similarly we will be creating it for
04:57 - subtraction division and multiplication
05:06 - and sub just let me check out a so it is
05:16 - fine now for multiplication and division
05:51 - now for division or multiplication or
05:57 - division okay okay so it is almost on
06:19 - and for this function is basically for
06:22 - clearing the entry field and sending it
06:24 - everything to zero so here just is a
06:35 - seee button or clearing then trickle
06:38 - I'll show you in a minute
06:41 - now the next is will be creating entry
06:46 - field and bunch of buttons nothing much
06:50 - just copy this down the procedure for
07:00 - each and every button is similar you
07:02 - just have to change to x and
07:04 - y-coordinates for placing the button
07:06 - based on your preference the division
07:10 - here and me okay so I'll just spin you
07:16 - what is actually going on so this is
07:25 - entry field where every input is been
07:29 - taken and this is the text where for
07:32 - taking the input from the user
07:36 - now each button here is carrying an
07:42 - individual function so for the function
07:44 - which we have created above that is the
07:47 - click button with a parameter number we
07:51 - are using tag or function for each and
07:54 - every button which we are create which
07:55 - we have created here for example we are
07:57 - using
07:57 - just the lambda similarly to that
08:00 - tic-tac-toe in so for each and every
08:03 - individual button that we are using
08:05 - click button with no so for example the
08:07 - user picks one entry field gets one as
08:12 - an input and cases gates on places gave
08:16 - that button over them so the procedure
08:20 - is same for each individual button you
08:22 - have 5 6 etc and 4 similarly for the
08:28 - operators as well addition
08:29 - multiplication subtraction and this
08:33 - button is for I see this function that
08:35 - is a command to you let me clear then
08:38 - click will basically nothing much and
08:40 - this equal button will produce the
08:43 - output so save and just run it and make
08:52 - sure we have done we have Morris yes we
08:56 - have others so this is the interface
08:59 - this is the interview this is the label
09:02 - which we have created at the initial and
09:05 - show you so this is the label calculator
09:14 - and we are packing it at the top so that
09:17 - is why this is the table is and trickly
09:19 - which we have waiting just above the
09:21 - first button and this other each
09:23 - individual numbers with the operators
09:26 - and the clear function that's it and
09:28 - that's here
09:29 - placing the working space on your
09:31 - preference is up to you you can place it
09:34 - anywhere and yeah and this is so some
09:38 - calculations 1 plus oh so this I just
09:43 - want to tell you that 1 plus 4 is
09:45 - basically been carried out within this
09:48 - function so we'll just basically Khon
09:52 - Kaen 1 + 1 + 4 into the entry fill and
09:56 - just show you that this is in written
09:58 - and with the help of equal button will
10:02 - get an output
10:05 - so okay we have some peridot here so
10:08 - what is the error do okay so let's try
10:38 - again
10:40 - okay so you have fire water and then
10:44 - tree filled and let's try clear this out
10:47 - so it is empty now 5-8 let's see some
10:53 - negative outputs yes we have that 2 into
10:58 - 3 9 okay 5 divided by 5 5 by 5 so we
11:11 - have an output here so basically it
11:14 - works so this is the calculator which we
11:18 - have created the approach is almost
11:19 - similar the widgets are almost the same
11:21 - is drawn everywhere when you create a
11:26 - widget the position of the button has
11:32 - been changed that's it and test is all
11:37 - the same so this is it for this video
11:42 - guys i'm swatching

individual numbers with the operators and the clear function that's it and that's here placing the working space on your preference is up to you you can place it anywhere and yeah and this is so some calculations 1 plus oh so this I just want to tell you that 1 plus 4 is basically been carried out within this function so we'll just basically Khon Kaen 1 + 1 + 4 into the entry fill and just show

this is the calculator which we have created the approach is almost similar the widgets are almost the same is drawn everywhere when you create a widget the position of the button has been changed that's it and test is all the same so this is it for this video guys i'm swatching
