00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how to create a PDF file using
00:05 - your Visual Basic Windows Form
00:07 - application for this we are going to use
00:09 - a third party dll which is called itex
00:12 - shop which is widely used to create PDF
00:16 - file using net applications as well as
00:20 - Java applications so let's get started
00:23 - and let's first download the dll called
00:27 - I itex shop dlls so just open your
00:31 - browser and in your search just write
00:34 - itex shop and search for this and the
00:39 - first link you will see here is the site
00:43 - or the link from s sourceforge.net
00:47 - slpro SL itex shop so this is the link
00:52 - you want to open in order to download
00:54 - the dll files for itext shop okay so
00:59 - when you you click this link it will
01:01 - open the site like this and we just need
01:05 - to click this download button in order
01:07 - to download these tll files and it will
01:11 - take hardly 1 minute or 30 second to
01:14 - download these files so once you have
01:17 - downloaded these files I've already
01:19 - downloaded these files so this ZIP file
01:24 - look like this and this ZIP file also
01:27 - contain several zip files so it contains
01:31 - the it sha core projects and it also
01:35 - contains the dll files from I shop and
01:41 - what dll files we are interested in is
01:44 - in this it shop minus dll minus core
01:48 - folder and itch shop minus DL minus PDF
01:52 - fa folder and in this itch shop minus
01:56 - dll minus extra sa fold
02:01 - so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
02:04 - go to my project this is not a necessary
02:07 - step but I prefer to do this and I will
02:11 - just right click my project in my
02:14 - solution Explorer and I will click this
02:18 - open folder in Windows Explorer and this
02:22 - will open a folder in which my project
02:26 - this Visual Basic project is there and
02:29 - in here what I'm going to do is I'm
02:31 - going to just open the zip
02:34 - file which
02:37 - contains the itex shop DL and I will
02:42 - just extract the this dll file in my
02:45 - Visual Basic project folder right so
02:50 - itex shop. dll and IEX shop. XML file
02:55 - now I will open this itex shop minus DL
02:57 - minus PDF a a and I will extract this
03:02 - into my Visual
03:06 - Basic folder so I will just do
03:10 - this and one more zip file which is itex
03:14 - shop minus D minus
03:16 - extra and I will extract this also in
03:21 - my Visual Basic project folder okay now
03:26 - this once this is done we just once
03:30 - again go to our project and in here once
03:35 - again we will go to the solution
03:37 - Explorer and right click our project and
03:41 - in here this time we will open this
03:45 - properties here you can either open
03:49 - Properties or you can say I want to add
03:52 - references so let's open the properties
03:57 - here and this will open
04:00 - this property tab here and what you want
04:04 - to do is you want to add resources so
04:10 - just go to
04:12 - this

04:20 - resources
04:23 - okay and you there are some options so
04:27 - you can say add exis ing
04:32 - resources
04:35 - or and this will
04:37 - open the open file dialogue to select
04:43 - your resources so just open the folder
04:46 - in which you have extracted your dll
04:48 - files and we have extracted our dll file
04:52 - in our project folder itself so I'm
04:54 - going to choose my dll files from here
04:57 - which is itek shop. DL itshop . pdf. DL
05:01 - and I teex shop. XT extra. DL okay I
05:08 - choose all three of them and added as a
05:12 - resource here okay now once again once
05:18 - this is done I will just
05:21 - close the property tab from here and I
05:27 - will reach to my
05:31 - project form here so what I will do now
05:35 - is I will try to generate a PDF file
05:38 - using these dlll so I will take a button
05:41 - and I will change its text
05:46 - as
05:48 - create
05:50 - PDF okay and I will just double click
05:54 - this button and in here we are going to
05:57 - write our code okay
06:00 - so first of all we need to
06:03 - import some resources or some classes of
06:07 - these itex shop so what you need to do
06:11 - is so we are going to import this itex
06:14 - shop file here but first of all we need
06:17 - to add references to these dll files so
06:21 - I will right click my project once again
06:25 - and I will say add
06:26 - references and in here I'm going to go
06:29 - to this browse Tab and in here I have my
06:34 - all dll files itex shop. dll itex
06:38 - shop.pdf A.D and itex shop. extra. DL
06:43 - once again and I will select all these
06:46 - dll files once again and I will press
06:49 - okay and this will add a
06:53 - reference to these dll files in our
06:56 - project okay now we are ready to import
06:59 - these itex shop file so just go at the
07:03 - top of
07:04 - your code file and just add these three
07:09 - Imports here which are Imports itek
07:13 - shop. text.pdf
07:16 - and just import itex shop. text and
07:21 - third import is Imports
07:25 - system.io okay so these two are from the
07:28 - itex shop BL and this is from your
07:31 - Visual Basic core Library okay once you
07:34 - done with that once again go to
07:37 - your button and double click it and in
07:41 - here we are going to write a code to
07:43 - generate a PDF so what I'm going to do
07:47 - is I'm going to first paste the code
07:51 - which is very
07:54 - simple so this is the code to generate a
07:58 - PDF file of two pages okay so what you
08:02 - need to do in your button click event is
08:04 - to declare a variable for the document
08:08 - so just write dim PDF doc as new
08:12 - document and in the second line just
08:15 - declare a second variable called PDF
08:19 - write as a PDF writer instance so just
08:23 - write them PDF WR as PDF writer is equal
08:27 - to PDF writer do get
08:31 - instance and
08:33 - just copy
08:36 - this PDF doc instance from here or PDF
08:40 - doc object from here and paste it inside
08:44 - this bracket as a first argument and the
08:47 - second argument is the new file stream
08:50 - so just write new file stream and in the
08:53 - bracket just give the name of your PDF
08:56 - file whatever you want your file to be
09:00 - so this is the name for your PDF file I
09:02 - have given uh the name to my PDF file as
09:05 - simple.pdf
09:07 - comma fil mode. create okay so write
09:12 - this
09:13 - line and then in the third line we are
09:16 - going to open our document
09:20 - so in the third line just write this PDF
09:24 - doc. open this will open your PDF uh
09:28 - document and now once the document is
09:31 - open we are going to add some paragraph
09:34 - to our document so just write PDF doc.
09:37 - add and in the bracket just write new
09:39 - paragraph and in the bracket just write
09:42 - the text you want
09:44 - to save in your PDF file okay so this
09:49 - will just add a paragraph to your PDF
09:53 - file now suppose you want to add a
09:57 - second page so for for adding the second
10:00 - page what you need to do is you need to
10:03 - write once again your pdf. doc do new
10:07 - page so this line will create a new page
10:10 - for the PDF okay and once again to our
10:14 - new page we are going to add a new
10:16 - paragraph so just write PDF dot. add and
10:19 - in the bracket just write new paragraph
10:21 - and in the bracket just write the text
10:24 - in your second page whatever you want to
10:27 - write and once you are done with writing
10:30 - the text just close your PDF document
10:35 - instance so this is the
10:38 - code to create a simple PDF of two pages
10:43 - okay now let's try and to run the
10:46 - program and let's check whether it
10:48 - creates the PDF file or not so first of
10:51 - all what I'm going to do
10:53 - is if you are wondering where this file
10:57 - is generated so this simple PDF file
11:02 - will be generated in your binary folder
11:04 - wherever your executable file for your
11:08 - project is there because I haven't given
11:10 - any path to the this file or you can
11:14 - give any path for
11:16 - example C do SL slash or whatever path
11:22 - wherever you want to generate your file
11:25 - so I just wanted to generate the file in
11:27 - my project folder
11:29 - itself so I will just go to my solution
11:32 - Explorer once again and I will right
11:34 - click it and once again I will click
11:36 - open folder in Windows Explorer and in
11:39 - here I'm going to open my binary folder
11:42 - which is bin folder and in here I have
11:46 - debug folder because I'm making this
11:48 - project in debug mode and in here you
11:51 - can see all my three dll files are there
11:56 - and I here my new simple.pdf file will
12:01 - be generated when I run the program so
12:04 - just keep on the eye keep your eye on
12:08 - this folder so I'm running this project
12:13 - and I'm opening this folder so you can
12:17 - see the file generated in front of your
12:21 - eyes Okay so I will just click this
12:24 - create PDF button and just see here I
12:27 - click it and you see here there is a new
12:31 - PDF file created here which is
12:33 - simple.pdf now we are going to open this
12:37 - PDF
12:39 - file and when you open this PDF file you
12:43 - can see there are two pages generated
12:46 - one and two if you can see here and
12:50 - first page in first page we have written
12:52 - the simple text hello world and in the
12:55 - second page we have written written
12:59 - hello world again
13:01 - so the itext dll has generated two pages
13:05 - for us for first page we have the text
13:09 - hello world which is this text if you
13:13 - can see here and second page has hello
13:17 - world again okay so in this way you can
13:21 - create a simple PDF file with the help
13:24 - of your itext and your Visual Basic
13:26 - Windows Form application in the future
13:29 - videos I will also show you how to add
13:32 - tables images and some more interesting
13:36 - stuff to your PDF file using itext shop
13:40 - so so stay tuned and please rate
13:43 - commment

hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how to create a PDF file using your Visual Basic Windows Form application for this we are going to use a third party dll which is called itex shop which is widely used to create PDF file using net applications as well as Java applications so let's get started and let's first download the dll called I itex shop dlls so just open your browser and in your search just write itex shop and search for this and the first link you will see here is the site or the link from s sourceforge.net slpro SL itex shop so this is the link you want to open in order to download the dll files for itext shop okay so when you you click this link it will open the site like this and we just need to click this download button in order to download these tll files and it will take hardly 1 minute or 30 second to download these files so once you have downloaded these files I've already downloaded these files so this ZIP file look like this and this ZIP file also contain several zip files so it contains the it sha core projects and it also contains the dll files from I shop and what dll files we are interested in is in this it shop minus dll minus core folder and itch shop minus DL minus PDF fa folder and in this itch shop minus dll minus extra sa fold so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to my project this is not a necessary step but I prefer to do this and I will just right click my project in my solution Explorer and I will click this open folder in Windows Explorer and this will open a folder in which my project this Visual Basic project is there and in here what I'm going to do is I'm going to just open the zip file which contains the itex shop DL and I will just extract the this dll file in my Visual Basic project folder right so itex shop. dll and IEX shop. XML file now I will open this itex shop minus DL minus PDF a a and I will extract this into my Visual Basic folder so I will just do this and one more zip file which is itex shop minus D minus extra and I will extract this also in my Visual Basic project folder okay now this once this is done we just once again go to our project and in here once again we will go to the solution Explorer and right click our project and in here this time we will open this properties here you can either open Properties or you can say I want to add references so let's open the properties here and this will open this property tab here and what you want to do is you want to add resources so just go to this resources tab here and just say add resources okay and you there are some options so you can say add exis ing resources or and this will open the open file dialogue to select your resources so just open the folder in which you have extracted your dll files and we have extracted our dll file in our project folder itself so I'm going to choose my dll files from here which is itek shop. DL itshop . pdf. DL and I teex shop. XT extra. DL okay I choose all three of them and added as a resource here okay now once again once this is done I will just close the property tab from here and I will reach to my project form here so what I will do now is I will try to generate a PDF file using these dlll so I will take a button and I will change its text as create PDF okay and I will just double click this button and in here we are going to write our code okay so first of all we need to import some resources or some classes of these itex shop so what you need to do is so we are going to import this itex shop file here but first of all we need to add references to these dll files so I will right click my project once again and I will say add references and in here I'm going to go to this browse Tab and in here I have my all dll files itex shop. dll itex shop.pdf A.D and itex shop. extra. DL once again and I will select all these dll files once again and I will press okay and this will add a reference to these dll files in our project okay now we are ready to import these itex shop file so just go at the top of your code file and just add these three Imports here which are Imports itek shop. text.pdf and just import itex shop. text and third import is Imports system.io okay so these two are from the itex shop BL and this is from your Visual Basic core Library okay once you done with that once again go to your button and double click it and in here we are going to write a code to generate a PDF so what I'm going to do is I'm going to first paste the code which is very simple so this is the code to generate a PDF file of two pages okay so what you need to do in your button click event is to declare a variable for the document so just write dim PDF doc as new document and in the second line just declare a second variable called PDF write as a PDF writer instance so just write them PDF WR as PDF writer is equal to PDF writer do get instance and just copy this PDF doc instance from here or PDF doc object from here and paste it inside this bracket as a first argument and the second argument is the new file stream so just write new file stream and in the bracket just give the name of your PDF file whatever you want your file to be so this is the name for your PDF file I have given uh the name to my PDF file as simple.pdf comma fil mode. create okay so write this line and then in the third line we are going to open our document so in the third line just write this PDF doc. open this will open your PDF uh document and now once the document is open we are going to add some paragraph to our document so just write PDF doc. add and in the bracket just write new paragraph and in the bracket just write the text you want to save in your PDF file okay so this will just add a paragraph to your PDF file now suppose you want to add a second page so for for adding the second page what you need to do is you need to write once again your pdf. doc do new page so this line will create a new page for the PDF okay and once again to our new page we are going to add a new paragraph so just write PDF dot. add and in the bracket just write new paragraph and in the bracket just write the text in your second page whatever you want to write and once you are done with writing the text just close your PDF document instance so this is the code to create a simple PDF of two pages okay now let's try and to run the program and let's check whether it creates the PDF file or not so first of all what I'm going to do is if you are wondering where this file is generated so this simple PDF file will be generated in your binary folder wherever your executable file for your project is there because I haven't given any path to the this file or you can give any path for example C do SL slash or whatever path wherever you want to generate your file so I just wanted to generate the file in my project folder itself so I will just go to my solution Explorer once again and I will right click it and once again I will click open folder in Windows Explorer and in here I'm going to open my binary folder which is bin folder and in here I have debug folder because I'm making this project in debug mode and in here you can see all my three dll files are there and I here my new simple.pdf file will be generated when I run the program so just keep on the eye keep your eye on this folder so I'm running this project and I'm opening this folder so you can see the file generated in front of your eyes Okay so I will just click this create PDF button and just see here I click it and you see here there is a new PDF file created here which is simple.pdf now we are going to open this PDF file and when you open this PDF file you can see there are two pages generated one and two if you can see here and first page in first page we have written the simple text hello world and in the second page we have written written hello world again so the itext dll has generated two pages for us for first page we have the text hello world which is this text if you can see here and second page has hello world again okay so in this way you can create a simple PDF file with the help of your itext and your Visual Basic Windows Form application in the future videos I will also show you how to add tables images and some more interesting stuff to your PDF file using itext shop so so stay tuned and please rate commment
