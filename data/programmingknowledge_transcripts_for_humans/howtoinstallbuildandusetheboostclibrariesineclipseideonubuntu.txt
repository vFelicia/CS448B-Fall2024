00:00 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:02 - video I will show you how to install
00:05 - poost C++ libraries on your
00:08 - Ubuntu operating system so why we use
00:13 - boost
00:15 - libraries boost libraries are the set of
00:18 - C++ libraries which helps you to
00:23 - write some complicated programs suppose
00:27 - if you are want to write a program which
00:31 - communicate between two serial devices
00:34 - or for example you want to write program
00:38 - which analyzes the file system or
00:43 - regular expression
00:45 - or many things boost libraries have
00:50 - which makes your life simple while you
00:53 - are writing the C++ program so that's
00:57 - why we use C C boost C++ libraries now
01:03 - let's see how we can install these
01:06 - libraries on our open to operating
01:10 - system so just open your terminal and in
01:13 - here
01:16 - just
01:19 - give
01:20 - this command so write pseudo apt minus
01:25 - get install lib boost minus all minus
01:32 - Dave so give this command in order
01:37 - to install boost libraries on your
01:40 - Ubuntu operating system and press
01:45 - enter and because I already have
01:49 - installed these libraries so it says me
01:52 - that uh these libraries are already in
01:55 - the newest version but when you install
02:00 - boost libraries for the first time you
02:02 - will be prompt
02:04 - to uh give some yes command or Y command
02:10 - and then it will take around 3 to 4
02:13 - minutes to install boost libraries on
02:15 - your system and once these libraries are
02:18 - installed in your open to system you can
02:22 - go to your file
02:24 - system here so click file system and in
02:29 - user
02:32 - folder and in include folder you will be
02:36 - able to see this boost libraries or
02:40 - boost folder that
02:42 - means all the Boost
02:44 - libraries are installed in your
02:49 - system okay so let's try and make a
02:54 - simple C++ program which uses these
02:58 - boost Library liaries and we are going
03:02 - to use eclipse for writing our C++
03:07 - program so I open my ID Eclipse ID I
03:12 - make a new C++
03:20 - program and I name my program
03:25 - as
03:27 - boost test for example Le and I will
03:30 - choose this hello
03:32 - world project next
03:37 - next and next and
03:48 - finish and this will
03:51 - create a
03:55 - boost program C++ program for us
04:03 - so now it's here so we have Boost test
04:08 - program and we have the simple hello
04:11 - world program so what I'm going to do is
04:15 - I
04:18 - will remove or I will replace this
04:22 - program with the simple boost
04:28 - program
04:30 - which analyzes the number
04:35 - of folder in
04:38 - your given part so I'm
04:41 - using boost file system libraries for
04:45 - that and right now you can see there are
04:48 - so many errors while I'm use I'm writing
04:53 - my code for Boost file system so what
04:57 - you need to do is you you need to
05:00 - provide the
05:01 - libraries which you are using in this
05:03 - case I'm using boost file system so
05:07 - that's why I need to give the path to
05:09 - the libraries and the libraries which
05:12 - I'm using so just go to your project
05:15 - right click your
05:17 - project C++ project and go to the
05:23 - properties and in the C
05:27 - build menu go to to
05:30 - settings and in the
05:33 - settings you need to go in
05:38 - this cross g++ Linker and in this you
05:43 - need to go here in the library section
05:46 - just click
05:49 - it I make it a little bit bigger so it's
05:53 - w visible properly so go here this
05:58 - libraries in the the cross g++ Linker in
06:02 - the settings right and in the libraries
06:06 - I will add the name of the library which
06:09 - I'm using which is Boost file system so
06:11 - I will write
06:20 - boost file system so these Library
06:23 - depend upon the program or libraries of
06:27 - boost you are using if you're using
06:30 - regular expression library or if you are
06:33 - using poost asio library then you need
06:36 - to change this Library name from here so
06:41 - click
06:42 - okay and once again I will click this
06:46 - Plus or add button and I will include
06:50 - one more
06:51 - libraries called
06:57 - boost system
07:00 - this is the native libraries library of
07:03 - boost so you need to in include this
07:06 - Library also in order to compile your
07:10 - program so this Library you need to
07:13 - install because you are writing
07:16 - the Boost file system program and this
07:21 - is the native Library so you need to in
07:23 - uh write include this to every
07:27 - program and in in this Library search
07:31 - path you need to give the path of the
07:35 - libraries so I already told you that our
07:39 - library are in user include folder
07:43 - right so I will click this add button
07:48 - here and I will go to file
07:52 - system and in here I will go to file
07:55 - system and search for user where my my
07:59 - Boost libraries are so
08:02 - user
08:03 - include and you can see my Boost library
08:07 - is here so you don't need to click this
08:09 - boost just click user and include and
08:13 - press okay and you see
08:17 - users and include just go that far only
08:20 - don't include this slash uh boost it
08:27 - will recognize it automatically
08:30 - click
08:31 - okay and
08:33 - now you
08:35 - have these two things so you have
08:38 - included these two Library names and the
08:41 - library search path and click
08:46 - okay and when you do
08:50 - that and when you save this
08:57 - program and you B build your program
09:00 - once again so you can just right click
09:03 - and build project also uh or you can
09:06 - click this button for
09:09 - build and you will
09:13 - see
09:15 - that our program will compile
09:18 - successfully I
09:27 - hope so the process is going on right
09:51 - now I'm running this on my virtual
09:55 - machine that's why it's giving
09:58 - me
09:59 - such a delayed response but on your
10:02 - native open to operating system it will
10:04 - be faster you still see these error
10:08 - because you can see here it's
10:12 - indexing those libraries so when this
10:15 - will reach to 100% then these error will
10:20 - go but our build is
10:23 - successful there are no error
10:25 - here you can
10:28 - see so there are no error in our
10:36 - program and now now you can see there is
10:39 - no red lines because our program is
10:45 - successful so this simple program just
10:49 - finds the number of files in
10:54 - your given path so I will run my code
10:59 - code or you can see this code like this
11:03 - so if you want you may also write this
11:07 - code so just pause the video and copy
11:11 - the code if you want and when I run
11:17 - this it will give me the
11:20 - response so you can see in the
11:24 - console my program is made and I have 13
11:29 - files in my home open to folder okay so
11:36 - that's the program
11:39 - for using boost file system so I hope
11:43 - you have enjoyed this video and you have
11:46 - liked this video please keep watching
11:48 - these videos and please rate comment and
11:51 - subscribe and bye for now

include just go that far only don't include this slash uh boost it will recognize it automatically click okay and now you have these two things so you have included these two Library names and the
