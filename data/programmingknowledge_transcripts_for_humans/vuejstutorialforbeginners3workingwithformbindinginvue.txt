00:00 - hello everyone welcome to yet another
00:02 - tutorial on VJs so you can refer to this
00:05 - GitHub repository that says github.com
00:08 - slpr software development learn view you
00:11 - will get all the links and the stuff and
00:15 - code related to this video series in
00:18 - this reposty so the title is working
00:20 - with the form Bing in view so
00:23 - description says we will learn how to
00:24 - bind a form component using a view so
00:27 - let's get started with today's tutorial
00:30 - so you can move to your vs code and like
00:34 - in the previous two tutorials we created
00:37 - this uh like index one. HTML and index
00:39 - 2. HTML what you can do you can copy
00:43 - this
00:44 - content and paste it here and what we
00:48 - will do we would change this to learn
00:51 - view
00:52 - 3 and we will remove this body
00:56 - tag okay what I'll do I'll click on view
00:59 - up
01:00 - parents and reset zoom so this should
01:04 - reset my zoom and so that I can show you
01:07 - what's the best uh possible view uh so
01:10 - we have a a template index 3 index 3.
01:15 - HTML so we will continue with the third
01:17 - tutorial today so that is our index 3.
01:19 - HTML and learn view 3 like this is the
01:22 - tutorial number three so you can refer
01:26 - to your browser and refresh the page and
01:29 - you will get the page as desired result
01:32 - and you can right click here inspect
01:34 - element and you will see the development
01:36 - version of the uh
01:38 - VJs is running in the console so let's
01:41 - get started with this so what you can
01:47 - do you can create a div with an
01:51 - ID div
01:54 - ID okay I'll Zoom this
01:58 - yes da ID
02:01 - is equal to uh you can define a d with
02:05 - an IDE such as my app
02:09 - 3 and you can now close the
02:13 - div and now you can create a view
02:17 - component refering to this ID so
02:22 - constant view
02:24 - component so what I'll give a short
02:27 - notation
02:28 - bc3 so this is view component 3 isal to
02:33 - New
02:35 - View okay you can give this an any name
02:38 - so I'll give a decent name
02:42 - view component okay so this is view
02:48 - component so yeah perfectly fine now I I
02:51 - have three things
02:53 - element which refers
02:57 - to Hash my app
03:01 - three then I have a
03:05 - data refers to uh you can have a data
03:10 - plus the
03:12 - methods plus the
03:15 - methods okay so let's uh we keep a
03:20 - simple data that
03:21 - is we should keep a simple data that is
03:26 - uh
03:28 - text is equal to
03:31 - hello world hello and we will render
03:34 - this data inside this
03:37 - dat so when we refresh this page we
03:41 - would see the data here that is hello
03:44 - perfectly fine now what we are going to
03:46 - do what we are going to do we are
03:50 - learning the form binding so what we can
03:53 - insist on
03:55 - that uh we can create a form element the
03:59 - most simp simple being is input type is
04:02 - equal to text so let's do thing this
04:08 - this we will create an input
04:12 - input type isal to text okay and what
04:18 - I'm going to do I'm going to remove this
04:20 - for the confusion to avoid any confusion
04:23 - and let this placeholder
04:28 - says uh like placeholders is
04:32 - enter enter
04:34 - something this this this and I can close
04:38 - this
04:40 - input perfectly fine okay when I refresh
04:43 - this page I'll see I have a input which
04:46 - says enter something and I have my
04:48 - console running at the right hand side
04:51 - now what you can do you can create
04:55 - something a variable known as
04:57 - message okay or my
05:02 - message which is empty okay and you
05:08 - can V model this message V
05:13 - model is equal
05:15 - to my message so when you V model this
05:19 - my message so it now binds this data to
05:24 - this input type is equal to text so what
05:27 - you can
05:28 - do uh what you can do you can do one
05:32 - thing uh you can move to the next
05:35 - line and what you can say yeah and what
05:40 - you can do you can click on my message
05:46 - so I hope what you I'm getting my point
05:49 - that uh in this input type is equal to
05:52 - text we I have binded this data to V
05:55 - model result of my message now I'm
05:57 - usually performing that my message is
06:00 - equal to this okay so what you can do
06:03 - also just for the
06:06 - sake I'll comment this out first I
06:09 - comment this out so that I give you
06:12 - better idea of
06:14 - this okay now I'll change this my
06:17 - message
06:18 - to
06:20 - hello hello view
06:24 - JS hello
06:28 - VJs
06:30 - and it says yeah okay I'm having some
06:34 - issue on this let
06:39 - me yes yeah now it's perfect comment
06:43 - yeah so now it was hello VJs perfectly
06:47 - fine but what if I want to keep this
06:50 - Dynamic how do I keep this Dynamic let
06:53 - this be an empty string okay just just
06:56 - I'll change this to hello
07:00 - JS so this would refresh to hello JS
07:03 - perfectly fine now I'll keep this as
07:07 - Dynamic I'll com uncomment out
07:12 - this and this
07:14 - also
07:16 - now I'll put this under the heading
07:19 - tag to give good
07:23 - view
07:28 - H1
07:35 - now as soon as I 10 uh and also I'll do
07:39 - one thing as soon as I type something
07:41 - you will see this in the
07:43 - heading hello
07:46 - word looks pretty good on the typing now
07:50 - I'll
07:51 - do type some
07:55 - text
07:57 - here Java J s
08:01 - programming and JavaScript programming
08:04 - and yeah here you can see that as soon
08:05 - as I type something and as soon as I
08:07 - type
08:08 - backspace you will remove something so
08:11 - this is one thing now another you can do
08:14 - is for checkbox so what you need to do
08:18 - you need to Define input typeal to
08:22 - checkbox place holder doesn't exist in
08:26 - checkbox and in this now the data types
08:29 - becomes a Boolean value so you type my
08:35 - flag is equal to
08:38 - false and you will remodel this with my
08:42 - flag and
08:44 - I'll say the value of my
08:49 - flag this is by default false now
08:51 - becomes true false true false true false
08:55 - true so this is how you can uh check box
08:59 - you can be model with the
09:01 - checkbox so this is like basic for the
09:05 - uh uh this is like the basic part of The
09:07 - Binding so we will carry on with some
09:10 - more binding in the next tutorial so
09:12 - thank you everyone for watching this
09:14 - tutorial you can try this out on one as
09:18 - well that is text
09:20 - area so I'll quickly show you text
09:24 - area so for that you can do V
09:31 - model is equal to text area
09:36 - message so text area message needs to be
09:39 - defined
09:40 - here inside the
09:47 - heading plus I need to Define this here
09:53 - also yeah so here you can see hello
09:59 - Java programming when I move to New Line
10:03 - hello word so it gives a space so you
10:06 - can uh configure these things in depth
10:09 - also with working with the text area so
10:13 - this is how it works so this is like uh
10:17 - what you can do so this is like pretty
10:19 - good for uh us like you can Define on so
10:23 - hello world JS
10:27 - programming so you can edit those things
10:30 - plus you can increase the size of the
10:32 - text box like this so this is for us so
10:36 - thank you guys thank you for watching
10:37 - this tutorial uh catch you in the next
10:40 - Tut thank you
