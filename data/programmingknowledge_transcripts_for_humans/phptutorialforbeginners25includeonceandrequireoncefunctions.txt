00:00 - hello guys in the last video I've shown
00:02 - you how to use include and require
00:04 - function to include files in your PHP
00:07 - program so I have shown you how to use
00:10 - this include function and this require
00:13 - function and what I was doing I was just
00:16 - including this simple header to it and I
00:19 - was just including this PHP variables to
00:22 - my page one and page two right now for
00:26 - example uh first of all in what I'm
00:29 - going to do in this video or what I'm
00:31 - going to teach in this video is uh
00:33 - include ones and require ones variable
00:38 - and let's see why uh we can use or why
00:42 - we need to use uh these include ones and
00:44 - required ones variable I will give you a
00:47 - small Dem demo so for example I have
00:51 - this include header.php which is this
00:55 - one in my page 1. PHP I included this
00:59 - and and I will just refresh this and it
01:03 - gives me programming knowledge which is
01:05 - a message or which is the header in the
01:08 - header file and whatever message I'm
01:10 - printing here which is this one right
01:13 - now for example somebody or by mistake I
01:16 - included this uh headup file more than
01:19 - once right I will save it and I will
01:22 - refresh my page and what it's done is it
01:27 - has included this header file
01:30 - three times and I will be able to see
01:32 - this header three times right but some
01:37 - sometimes you don't want to uh you know
01:39 - see this so what you can do is you can
01:45 - uh use include ones or require ones
01:48 - function so for example I will
01:52 - write include
01:55 - underscore
01:58 - ones and and this takes this bracket and
02:02 - inside this bracket you can pass the
02:04 - same header file name okay but still I
02:09 - have declared this include ones here
02:12 - which includes this header file but
02:14 - still I'm in I'm also using this include
02:18 - function also and let's see what
02:21 - happens the result is it included this
02:24 - Hider file using include one function
02:27 - once so we can see this message and it
02:30 - also included this uh header file using
02:33 - include functions so you we see this
02:36 - message two times right but for example
02:40 - we just cut this code and paste it below
02:45 - your include program and let's see what
02:47 - happens
02:49 - now and now you will be able to see it
02:53 - is uh just printing once so what this
02:57 - include ones and show sure that that you
03:02 - have only included this header file once
03:07 - okay so whenever you want to include
03:09 - your header file once use this include
03:13 - once function okay same you can do it
03:17 - with require and require ones so you
03:20 - have this require function in page2.php
03:23 - and I can just
03:27 - use require under
03:30 - _ on
03:32 - function and I can use this header name
03:36 - here and whenever I call this page2.php
03:43 - it will only include this uh header file
03:47 - once again only once right so this will
03:52 - work with require also and include
03:54 - also so just remember that if you want
03:57 - to include your header file once just
03:59 - use this include once or require once or
04:03 - if you don't care about including your
04:06 - header file more than once then you use
04:09 - this re wire so I hope you have enjoyed
04:11 - this video please WR comment and
04:12 - subscribe and bye for now

hello guys in the last video I've shown you how to use include and require function to include files in your PHP program so I have shown you how to use this include function and this require function and what I was doing I was just including this simple header to it and I was just including this PHP variables to my page one and page two right now for example uh first of all in what I'm going to do in this video or what I'm going to teach in this video is uh include ones and require ones variable and let's see why uh we can use or why we need to use uh these include ones and required ones variable I will give you a small Dem demo so for example I have this include header.php which is this one in my page 1. PHP I included this and and I will just refresh this and it gives me programming knowledge which is a message or which is the header in the header file and whatever message I'm printing here which is this one right now for example somebody or by mistake I included this uh headup file more than once right I will save it and I will refresh my page and what it's done is it has included this header file three times and I will be able to see this header three times right but some sometimes you don't want to uh you know see this so what you can do is you can uh use include ones or require ones function so for example I will write include underscore ones and and this takes this bracket and inside this bracket you can pass the same header file name okay but still I have declared this include ones here which includes this header file but still I'm in I'm also using this include function also and let's see what happens the result is it included this Hider file using include one function once so we can see this message and it also included this uh header file using include functions so you we see this message two times right but for example we just cut this code and paste it below your include program and let's see what happens now and now you will be able to see it is uh just printing once so what this include ones and show sure that that you have only included this header file once okay so whenever you want to include your header file once use this include once function okay same you can do it with require and require ones so you have this require function in page2.php and I can just use require under _ on function and I can use this header name here and whenever I call this page2.php it will only include this uh header file once again only once right so this will work with require also and include also so just remember that if you want to include your header file once just use this include once or require once or if you don't care about including your header file more than once then you use this re wire so I hope you have enjoyed this video please WR comment and subscribe and bye for now
