00:00 - everyone welcome to programming
00:01 - knowledge so L everyone so this is the
00:04 - 26 tutorial about Django series so I
00:07 - again welcome you all to programming
00:09 - knowledge so let's get started with this
00:11 - tutorial so you can download or clone
00:14 - this upholstery and I have to find below
00:16 - the instruction on how you can run this
00:17 - project on your local machine
00:19 - like in the previous tutorial I also
00:21 - mentioned I give an overview how you can
00:23 - make the changes so you can you can look
00:25 - to my previous tutorial or on
00:27 - instruction so let's get started with
00:29 - this tutorial so I would open my project
00:32 - so till now we had made the search bar
00:36 - with suggestions dynamically then we
00:39 - used to submit the option value and then
00:43 - we store the results in the global
00:46 - global dictionary so this is the global
00:48 - dictionary we have defined it and I can
00:52 - have a have a quick overview or of this
00:55 - so here you can see this is our navbar
00:58 - so what we can do
01:01 - I'll define a global diction in here
01:04 - global count
01:08 - yes so here it is global count so when
01:11 - I'm around my project I'll finish this
01:13 - page and let me check oh my server is in
01:17 - running so I start my server fine
01:20 - 10-minute rpy run server well refresh
01:23 - this page so here you can see my C
01:27 - language has one vote then pearl-like
01:32 - PHP here it has one vote then python one
01:39 - word okay in the same way
01:42 - I'll give SQL one vote then I'll give
01:47 - role to an SQL another word so here it
01:50 - is two words so in the same way we can
01:52 - keep on going with the server so this is
01:55 - Python
01:56 - I'll submit with the so here it is two
01:59 - words so this so this works absolutely
02:03 - fine so the next part we are going to do
02:06 - is add tables with progress bar so
02:09 - basically what we are going to cover in
02:11 - this tutorial I show you here
02:13 - so we are going to add add adding a
02:15 - table with progress bar now we are going
02:18 - to render the backend data to the front
02:20 - end with the table and a progress bar
02:21 - for every language we will add a
02:24 - progress bar as a measure of counter
02:26 - vote so the progress bar is going to
02:28 - show the measure of counter ward so this
02:32 - like the key will have a table so then
02:36 - the key of the dictionary would be the
02:38 - like the name of the language and the
02:41 - value put 2 in terms of the progress bar
02:43 - so let's get started with this so in the
02:47 - nav bar the first thing we are going to
02:49 - do is we are going to put a li class is
02:55 - equal to nap item okay and a anchor
03:03 - class is equal to nav link and what what
03:12 - we are going to define result okay we
03:19 - are going to define href tag refresh tag
03:22 - to the with hash result okay so we will
03:26 - define a result book below so this is
03:30 - the about tank and and here you can see
03:35 - you can also add the HR time here which
03:39 - was missing
03:41 - okay now what we are going to do this is
03:46 - a row okay so we have to define in the
03:50 - same way we have to define and this is a
03:53 - call md6
03:54 - okay so is the same we have to define
03:57 - this so what we can do so we can do in
04:01 - the same way div class is equal to row
04:05 - and then today class is able to call MD
04:13 - this time I would have sense into the
04:15 - table so I would define called MD 12 and
04:19 - now what you can do so we have a tip of
04:23 - draw class for MD 12 so other things
04:27 - can be same so I move to copy this and
04:32 - copy paste it here and I deal with
04:35 - result and name will be result so and
04:42 - this would be result okay and okay so
04:52 - what we can type here we can type here
04:56 - result in terms of progress bar okay
05:00 - so result table so so so so let me check
05:07 - let's first check this if this the so
05:11 - here you can see here we have a result
05:13 - table so okay and we'll give it a
05:15 - different color and this is bad bad
05:19 - success so we'll define match morning
05:24 - okay so yeah no it's absolutely works
05:28 - fine and we would give a style as well -
05:32 - we can give style is equal to margin top
05:39 - of one room so we can give a margin top
05:43 - of wonder so yeah now this looks
05:46 - perfectly fine so basically what I want
05:49 - you to show you that dessert this table
05:51 - is going to be a big one so we will add
05:53 - a responsive table so we can also open
05:56 - this for maybe we can do one thing let
06:00 - this view of six column and we have to
06:06 - define this in the center and you can
06:11 - copy the settings this settings that
06:14 - prove of fine so this would give a
06:18 - margin top frame and this should align
06:20 - in the center as well okay they did a
06:23 - some issue okay
06:29 - style okay this should be in the column
06:32 - okay sorry they should be in the column
06:34 - then I would think now this looks after
06:36 - do a works fine so what we are going to
06:39 - do so first we are going to
06:42 - render the dictionary because of
06:43 - front-end part so I will show you how
06:45 - you can do this so this is a dictionary
06:48 - so what we can do
06:50 - which I would use a for loop for key
06:56 - comma value in global count dot items so
07:04 - basically I am referring to both the
07:06 - items that is key and the value and then
07:09 - I would end this for loop
07:13 - BAM % and again a % and now I would end
07:26 - the for loop and or ok a % then I can do
07:35 - I'll do like suppose this is the key
07:43 - then value value and then I would give a
07:52 - break so here you can see and then this
07:55 - way I can print the dictionary so here
07:58 - you can see this is Mikey and dash value
08:01 - then keep that value then kill dash
08:03 - value so here I've got the key value
08:06 - pairs so we are going to work on this so
08:09 - I will give you a first then this these
08:12 - are the tables these are tables which
08:13 - were in the bootstrap so we have a
08:16 - responsive table so I'll show you
08:24 - response
08:29 - yeah so negative response to tables so
08:33 - these are the responsive tables so we
08:36 - have this class def classes root table
08:38 - table responsive then this is table
08:41 - faceted table so this gives us a
08:43 - responsive table so we'll I'll add a
08:48 - table
08:49 - let me check one we will add the
08:53 - simplest one so this is the simplest
08:55 - table we can have okay so let me check
08:59 - well because we have where we have to
09:01 - add this so this this is the result
09:03 - table okay now what we can do okay we
09:13 - can define okay we can defined if class
09:18 - is all to row then if class is would
09:24 - call em d12 so I am defining another
09:28 - grid for the table to keep it the
09:31 - responsive so I have copy pasted a table
09:34 - now I go to back go back to my page and
09:38 - I'll refresh this so here you can see
09:42 - I've added the table and one class I
09:46 - have to add then the responsive table is
09:49 - this one that is this should be above
09:51 - the table classes will be table so I'll
09:54 - I'll move to the page so this is a table
09:58 - classroom table and I have to add the
10:02 - class Israel to table responsive table
10:12 - responsive okay so this is this one I
10:17 - have to add and I have ant pad this div
10:22 - after the table tags so I have no I what
10:29 - we can do we can do format document yeah
10:32 - this looks absolutely fine so I would
10:34 - refresh this page okay so here you can
10:37 - see the table is responsive when I press
10:39 - control-shift
10:40 - I
10:42 - so here you can see we can scroll the
10:43 - table so if a table gets big so we can
10:48 - scroll the table so again we can see the
10:49 - scrollbar okay
10:51 - so I'll catch up in the next tutorial in
10:55 - the next one we would add the like these
11:01 - are the static rows but the next next
11:03 - time we are going to define them
11:04 - dynamically so I'll catch them in the
11:06 - next tutorial so thank you guys thank
11:07 - you so much
