00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:03 - maven on your Mac operating system so
00:07 - first of all let's see how to check
00:09 - whether maven is installed on our Mac
00:12 - operating system or not so just open
00:14 - your terminal and then give this command
00:17 - mbn - version and then press ENTER and
00:21 - if it gives this kind of result
00:24 - it says MVN command not found that maven
00:28 - is most probably not installed on your
00:31 - Mac operating system so there can be few
00:34 - ways of installing maven on your Mac
00:36 - operating system the easiest way is if
00:39 - you have homebrew installed on your Mac
00:42 - operating system then you can directly
00:44 - give this command blue install maven and
00:49 - then press ENTER and maven will be
00:52 - installed on your system without you
00:55 - doing anything but I don't like to use
00:59 - this brew command because this hides
01:02 - lots of stuff which is important to know
01:06 - to us so I'm going to show you the
01:09 - manual way of installing maven on our
01:11 - Mac operating system so for that you
01:15 - just need to open the terminal and
01:17 - search for download maven and the first
01:20 - link which will appear here will be from
01:22 - maven dot Apache dot o-r-g forward slash
01:25 - download dot cgi so I'm going to just
01:27 - click on this link and then when I
01:29 - scroll down we need to download the
01:31 - binary files of maven so you can either
01:37 - download Apache maven the zip file or
01:40 - Apache maven dot star dot G's add file
01:45 - so in our case I'm going to download the
01:47 - star dot cheese at file so I'm going to
01:49 - just click on this dot g that file and
01:53 - now I'm going to wait for the download
01:55 - to complete so once this dot dot dot G
01:58 - that file is downloaded we are going to
02:01 - just extract it into our downloads
02:03 - folder itself for example and then you
02:07 - can see this Apache - maven - three
02:10 - point five point four is extracted in
02:13 - my downloads folder so what we can do is
02:16 - we can move this Apache maven folder to
02:20 - our applications directory and for that
02:22 - I'm going to just minimize the browser
02:24 - and open the terminal and in this term
02:27 - another what we are going to do is we
02:29 - are going to move this directory to our
02:33 - applications directory so first of all
02:35 - I'm going to just CD to my downloads
02:39 - directory and then I'm going to use the
02:42 - MV command to move this Apache
02:45 - - maven dot 3.5 point 4 directory to the
02:50 - Applications folder so you can find the
02:53 - Applications folder in /a plication x'
02:56 - and then press ENTER and this directory
03:00 - is transferred to our Applications
03:02 - folder so we can now CD to our
03:06 - Applications folder now so I'm going to
03:09 - just go to the Applications folder
03:11 - and then when I do CD Apache you will be
03:16 - inside your Apache maven directory right
03:20 - and when I do PWD command
03:24 - you can see this directory is now inside
03:27 - my Applications folder ok so once you
03:31 - have moved your Apache maven directory
03:34 - into your applications directory the
03:37 - next step is to add the maven home
03:40 - environment variable into your bash
03:43 - profile file so the bash profile file
03:47 - can be found in your home directory
03:50 - which is CD for slash users and then
03:56 - whatever is your username so in my case
03:58 - it's code bind so I'm going to just CD
04:01 - to users and code bind and once you are
04:04 - inside your users and your username
04:08 - directory you will find a file called
04:10 - dot bash profile so I'm going to just do
04:14 - LS - L here and you will see all the
04:18 - directories here and when you do LS - a
04:23 - here and then press Enter
04:25 - you will see all the file
04:27 - which are also hidden into the terminal
04:31 - so what we are looking for is the file
04:34 - called dot bash profile which is this
04:38 - file so we need to add it this dot bash
04:40 - profile file if it doesn't exist you can
04:44 - create this dot bash profile file and
04:47 - then export whatever I'm going to show
04:50 - you so to open this dot bash profile
04:53 - file you can use open command and then -
04:57 - 'flag and then the file name which is
05:01 - dot bash profile and then press Enter
05:04 - which is going to open this file into
05:08 - the text editor so I have made these
05:11 - font bigger so you can see this bash
05:14 - profile file and if this file exists
05:18 - then it's okay if it doesn't exist you
05:21 - can create one and in your case it will
05:24 - look maybe empty or a different
05:26 - environment variable you will be able to
05:28 - see depending upon what you have
05:30 - installed till now on your Mac operating
05:32 - system so what you need to do is you
05:35 - need to go at the last and export few
05:39 - things so what you need to export is you
05:41 - need to export two things one is to
05:45 - export the Maven home environment
05:48 - variable and the second is the location
05:51 - where your maven binary file is there so
05:56 - I'm going to just put these two export
05:59 - in the description of this video so you
06:02 - can directly copy these exports and put
06:06 - it into your bash profile file just keep
06:09 - in mind that this version can be
06:11 - different in your case so depending upon
06:13 - the version of the maven you have
06:16 - installed you need to change this
06:18 - version from here so I'm going to just
06:20 - directly copy these to export and into
06:24 - my dot bash profile file at the end I'm
06:27 - going to just paste these to export and
06:30 - then I'm going to just save my dot bash
06:34 - profile file and I'm going to just close
06:37 - this file okay so once you have added
06:40 - these and
06:41 - varmint variables into your dot bash
06:43 - profile file what you need to do is you
06:46 - can either open the new terminal so let
06:49 - me clear the terminal first of all so
06:52 - you can either open the new terminal or
06:54 - you can just to source and then dot bash
06:59 - profile file okay this command is going
07:03 - to reload this a bash profile file into
07:06 - this terminal so I'm going to just give
07:08 - this command which is going to reload
07:11 - this dot bash profile file otherwise if
07:14 - you don't want to give this command you
07:16 - need to just close this terminal and
07:18 - open the terminal once again and then
07:21 - give the ambien command once again so
07:24 - ambien - version and then press ENTER
07:28 - and this time you will be able to see
07:31 - the version of maven which is installed
07:34 - on your system so this is the version of
07:37 - maven which is installed on our Mac
07:40 - operating system and this is how you can
07:43 - download and install maven on our Mac
07:46 - operating system so I hope you enjoyed
07:49 - this video please rate comment subscribe
07:50 - and bye for now
