With timestamps:

00:00 - hello guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - show you how you can install and
00:04 - configure postr SQL on your Ubuntu
00:07 - operating system post gr SQL or postrace
00:11 - is a relational database management
00:13 - system that provides an implementation
00:16 - of SQL querying language so let's see
00:19 - how we can install post gra so first of
00:22 - all open your terminal and the First
00:25 - Command which we are going to give here
00:28 - is the pseudo
00:30 - apt get update command so just give this
00:34 - pseudo appt get update command and it's
00:37 - going to update all your repositories on
00:40 - your open to operating system and after
00:43 - this once this is done we are going to
00:46 - install postris right so post chis uh
00:50 - installation is really easy the
00:52 - configuration part is little bit uh you
00:54 - know tough so once again to install post
00:58 - gr I'm going to first of all clear the
01:00 - terminal and then I will give this
01:03 - command sudo app get
01:06 - install and then post gr SQL and we are
01:10 - also going to uh add one more package
01:13 - here which is post gr SQL contri which
01:17 - is the package that adds some additional
01:19 - utilities and functionalities okay so
01:22 - this command is going to install post
01:24 - cray SQL and then we are going to give
01:27 - the next command which is is post gql
01:31 - contri so c n t r i b okay and then
01:36 - press enter which is going to install
01:38 - post SQL now it's going to ask you that
01:42 - it's going to take this much amount of
01:44 - uh dis space on your system if you agree
01:48 - just press Y and press enter and then
01:51 - post gr SQL will start installing and
01:55 - once this process is done we will see
01:57 - how we can configure Pro SQL on on our
02:00 - system so now the installation process
02:02 - is complete so I'm going to clear the
02:04 - terminal once again now let's check
02:06 - where the configuration files of post
02:10 - are located so the configuration file of
02:13 - post are located at this location so
02:16 - just LS Etc and then
02:20 - postc and then the version you have
02:23 - installed hopefully it will be the
02:25 - version starting with 9 and in my case
02:29 - the version is 9.3 uh at the time of
02:32 - making this video this version is little
02:35 - bit older because I'm using uh the older
02:38 - version of open 2 but in your case I
02:41 - think at the time of making this video
02:43 - this version is around 9.5 or 9.6 okay
02:48 - so you may see the different version in
02:50 - your case here right and then Main and
02:55 - then just press enter and you will see a
02:58 - bunch of files here the main
03:00 - configuration file is this file which is
03:02 - postre SQL docon file right so now let's
03:07 - check uh whether post gray SQL is
03:11 - running or not and how we can check the
03:14 - status of post gray SQL okay so just
03:19 - give this command service post gray SQL
03:22 - for the command to use with the postare
03:26 - SQL and you can see uh these are the
03:29 - command which you can use with postare
03:32 - SQL so start stop restart load Force
03:37 - reload and status you can use with uh
03:41 - the service post gr SQL command so let's
03:43 - use the service post SQL and let's say
03:47 - we want to know the status right and I'm
03:50 - going to just press enter and it says
03:53 - postc SQL is online and the port for the
03:56 - postc SQL is 543 to by default okay so
04:02 - if you want to know the status or if you
04:04 - want to restart or stop or start the
04:07 - post gray then use this command which is
04:10 - service post SQL status command okay now
04:16 - uh to use post gray the default user for
04:20 - post gray is post okay so to uh for the
04:25 - first time whenever you want to use post
04:27 - gr then you need to use uh this uh user
04:32 - which is post so to use this you just
04:36 - need to write sud sudo ASU and then post
04:39 - press okay and then press enter and now
04:42 - you can see here you are logged in with
04:46 - the post username right so in here you
04:50 - can see I'm highlighting this post gray
04:54 - user from here and that means you are uh
04:57 - you know logged in with the username
05:00 - postris which is created by postc
05:03 - installation for you which is a root
05:06 - user for post right now in order to uh
05:10 - you know use some commands for postc
05:13 - there is a command line tool which is
05:16 - psql so just give this command
05:19 - psql and then press enter and then you
05:23 - will see this kind of uh you know shell
05:26 - and here you can uh you know use all the
05:30 - command which you want to use with post
05:33 - SQL so let's see what are the databases
05:37 - present in the post Grave by default and
05:41 - for that you just need this back slash L
05:44 - and then press enter and you can see
05:46 - these are the default databases which
05:49 - are present by default in post gray now
05:52 - to list out the user you can use uh back
05:56 - SL duu and then press enter and this is
06:00 - going to list out all the users which
06:02 - are present on the postc so by default
06:06 - you can see the user of post is the only
06:10 - user which is by default created by post
06:14 - and you can see uh this user and this
06:17 - user have the super user privileges who
06:20 - can create roles create DBS and
06:24 - replication also okay now let's see how
06:27 - we can change the password of the
06:29 - default user which is
06:32 - postris so to change the password of the
06:35 - default user postris you just use uh
06:38 - this
06:39 - command alter and then the user so user
06:45 - and then the username and default
06:47 - username is postc right so you just need
06:51 - to write post here and then with
06:57 - password and whatever password you want
06:59 - to give here so for example I want to
07:01 - give the password test 1 2 3 and don't
07:05 - forget the semicolon here because it's
07:07 - very important here okay and press enter
07:11 - and once you see alter roll output then
07:15 - you know that the password for the root
07:18 - user is changed now let's uh you know
07:21 - create a new user so it's not a good
07:25 - practice to
07:26 - use you know or create database with the
07:29 - default user you need to you know create
07:32 - a new user and then from that user
07:35 - privileges you can create uh your new
07:38 - databases right so let's create a new
07:40 - user so to create a new user you just
07:43 - give the
07:44 - command create and then user and then
07:49 - the username for example
07:51 - user one I want to create a new user
07:55 - with the username one and then with
08:01 - password and then whatever password you
08:04 - want to provide here for Simplicity I'm
08:06 - going to just provide uh test 1 2 3 uh
08:10 - in your case you may want to uh you know
08:13 - provide the password which you can
08:15 - remember and which is secure for your
08:18 - database okay so the username is user
08:22 - one and password is this one and then
08:24 - press enter and once you see this output
08:27 - create role then the new user is created
08:31 - so you can list out the users once again
08:34 - by using back SL duu and now you can see
08:38 - the user one is also added to your list
08:42 - but you can see there is uh no
08:44 - privileges to this user because we
08:46 - haven't provided any privileges to this
08:49 - user so let's provide some privileges to
08:52 - this user so let's make this user a
08:54 - super user so just write uh alter and
08:59 - then user and then the username which is
09:03 - user one in our case with super user
09:08 - okay so just write super user here and
09:11 - then the semicolon and then press enter
09:15 - and now it says alter Rule now once
09:18 - again when we give back/ du command you
09:21 - can see the attribute for this user is
09:26 - added which is super user right now
09:29 - let's create one more user and then we
09:32 - will see how we can remove the user okay
09:36 - so I'm going to create user two with the
09:39 - same password and then let's list out
09:42 - the users now we have three users right
09:45 - so let's uh say we want to remove the
09:48 - user two now so we will just say
09:53 - drop and then user and then the username
09:57 - which is user two and and then the
09:59 - semicolon and then press enter and it
10:02 - says drop roll and once again list out
10:04 - the users and now we have only two users
10:08 - right so this command can be used to
10:11 - remove the users now there are many
10:13 - commands you can use with this
10:15 - interactive shell which is psql right
10:18 - now in order to know all the possible
10:21 - flags and command you can use with psql
10:25 - I'm going to open the new terminal here
10:27 - and I'm going to just write Ma n
10:30 - psql okay and then press enter and you
10:33 - can see here the short description of
10:35 - this PS psql command how to use this and
10:39 - the long description and then the
10:43 - options you can use with this psql
10:45 - commands so you can see you can uh use
10:48 - so many options with this psql commands
10:52 - and at the bottom you have uh you know
10:55 - you can see so much description here
10:58 - right right so you can uh just go
11:01 - through it whenever you want to and then
11:04 - uh whenever you want to use some command
11:07 - you can uh just refer to this man page
11:10 - for psql and when you press q key it's
11:15 - going to quit okay now the last thing I
11:18 - want to show here is the PG admin client
11:24 - so on Ubuntu if you are on Ubuntu you
11:27 - will be having the access ACC to open to
11:30 - software Center so you can see this icon
11:34 - for the open to software Center just
11:36 - open open to software Center so once
11:40 - it's open just write PG admin here okay
11:45 - and then press enter which is going to
11:47 - search for this software which is which
11:49 - says PG admin 3 at the time of making
11:52 - this video and then you just select this
11:55 - and then click install which is going to
11:58 - install this PG admin on your open to
12:01 - operating system once this PG admin is
12:04 - installed you can see here we are going
12:07 - to see how we can use it so just give
12:10 - your password for your obuntu operating
12:12 - system and then press enter which is
12:14 - going to start installing and once this
12:18 - progress while reaches 100% then we will
12:21 - see how we can use this PG admin so now
12:24 - the PG admin 3 is installed on my open
12:28 - to operating system I'm going to
12:29 - minimize this and then I'm going to
12:32 - scroll down in my left hand uh scroll
12:36 - bar and you can see uh the pg3 icon here
12:39 - just double click on it which is going
12:41 - to open this PG admin and now here you
12:45 - can see uh this kind of graphical user
12:49 - interface to interact with your database
12:52 - right so in order to connect to the
12:54 - database you can just uh click this
12:57 - button this wire plug kind of B button
13:00 - is going to give you this kind of uh
13:03 - interface you remember if you remember
13:07 - that the root user was the post Grace
13:10 - user right so by default the you know
13:15 - post gray listens on Local Host so here
13:18 - you can just give uh
13:21 - 127.0.0.1 which is the Local Host you
13:25 - can give uh for
13:27 - example
13:29 - local host name here and then the port
13:33 - we have already seen is
13:36 - 5432 the username is post for example
13:40 - for now you can use the other username
13:42 - also which you have created for example
13:45 - we have created the user1 so you can
13:48 - give that user and the password of that
13:51 - user also right and then the password of
13:54 - post so if you remember we have changed
13:57 - the password of post post chis right and
14:00 - we have given this password to post chis
14:02 - so just copy this same password and then
14:05 - once again go to PG admin and then give
14:09 - the same password here okay and if you
14:12 - want you can select the color I'm not
14:14 - going to select it and then click okay
14:18 - and this is going to uh give you the
14:21 - save warning just click okay and now uh
14:24 - your PG admin client client will connect
14:28 - to
14:29 - the PG or postr SQL database and now you
14:33 - can see we have the Local Host here and
14:35 - once again when you expend this Local
14:37 - Host we have the post gr user right and
14:41 - right now it doesn't have any uh you
14:44 - know databases so you can create the
14:47 - databases from uh this uh psql terminal
14:51 - client also or you can create the
14:53 - databases and tables and schemas from
14:57 - this PG admin
14:59 - interactive you know graphical user
15:01 - interface also okay and that we will see
15:05 - in some other video but for this video I
15:08 - would just wanted to show you how you
15:09 - can uh install post SQL and configure it
15:13 - on your open to operating system so I
15:15 - hope you've enjoyed this video please
15:17 - Rite comment subscribe and bye for now

Cleaned transcript:

hello guys in this video I'm going to show you how you can install and configure postr SQL on your Ubuntu operating system post gr SQL or postrace is a relational database management system that provides an implementation of SQL querying language so let's see how we can install post gra so first of all open your terminal and the First Command which we are going to give here is the pseudo apt get update command so just give this pseudo appt get update command and it's going to update all your repositories on your open to operating system and after this once this is done we are going to install postris right so post chis uh installation is really easy the configuration part is little bit uh you know tough so once again to install post gr I'm going to first of all clear the terminal and then I will give this command sudo app get install and then post gr SQL and we are also going to uh add one more package here which is post gr SQL contri which is the package that adds some additional utilities and functionalities okay so this command is going to install post cray SQL and then we are going to give the next command which is is post gql contri so c n t r i b okay and then press enter which is going to install post SQL now it's going to ask you that it's going to take this much amount of uh dis space on your system if you agree just press Y and press enter and then post gr SQL will start installing and once this process is done we will see how we can configure Pro SQL on on our system so now the installation process is complete so I'm going to clear the terminal once again now let's check where the configuration files of post are located so the configuration file of post are located at this location so just LS Etc and then postc and then the version you have installed hopefully it will be the version starting with 9 and in my case the version is 9.3 uh at the time of making this video this version is little bit older because I'm using uh the older version of open 2 but in your case I think at the time of making this video this version is around 9.5 or 9.6 okay so you may see the different version in your case here right and then Main and then just press enter and you will see a bunch of files here the main configuration file is this file which is postre SQL docon file right so now let's check uh whether post gray SQL is running or not and how we can check the status of post gray SQL okay so just give this command service post gray SQL for the command to use with the postare SQL and you can see uh these are the command which you can use with postare SQL so start stop restart load Force reload and status you can use with uh the service post gr SQL command so let's use the service post SQL and let's say we want to know the status right and I'm going to just press enter and it says postc SQL is online and the port for the postc SQL is 543 to by default okay so if you want to know the status or if you want to restart or stop or start the post gray then use this command which is service post SQL status command okay now uh to use post gray the default user for post gray is post okay so to uh for the first time whenever you want to use post gr then you need to use uh this uh user which is post so to use this you just need to write sud sudo ASU and then post press okay and then press enter and now you can see here you are logged in with the post username right so in here you can see I'm highlighting this post gray user from here and that means you are uh you know logged in with the username postris which is created by postc installation for you which is a root user for post right now in order to uh you know use some commands for postc there is a command line tool which is psql so just give this command psql and then press enter and then you will see this kind of uh you know shell and here you can uh you know use all the command which you want to use with post SQL so let's see what are the databases present in the post Grave by default and for that you just need this back slash L and then press enter and you can see these are the default databases which are present by default in post gray now to list out the user you can use uh back SL duu and then press enter and this is going to list out all the users which are present on the postc so by default you can see the user of post is the only user which is by default created by post and you can see uh this user and this user have the super user privileges who can create roles create DBS and replication also okay now let's see how we can change the password of the default user which is postris so to change the password of the default user postris you just use uh this command alter and then the user so user and then the username and default username is postc right so you just need to write post here and then with password and whatever password you want to give here so for example I want to give the password test 1 2 3 and don't forget the semicolon here because it's very important here okay and press enter and once you see alter roll output then you know that the password for the root user is changed now let's uh you know create a new user so it's not a good practice to use you know or create database with the default user you need to you know create a new user and then from that user privileges you can create uh your new databases right so let's create a new user so to create a new user you just give the command create and then user and then the username for example user one I want to create a new user with the username one and then with password and then whatever password you want to provide here for Simplicity I'm going to just provide uh test 1 2 3 uh in your case you may want to uh you know provide the password which you can remember and which is secure for your database okay so the username is user one and password is this one and then press enter and once you see this output create role then the new user is created so you can list out the users once again by using back SL duu and now you can see the user one is also added to your list but you can see there is uh no privileges to this user because we haven't provided any privileges to this user so let's provide some privileges to this user so let's make this user a super user so just write uh alter and then user and then the username which is user one in our case with super user okay so just write super user here and then the semicolon and then press enter and now it says alter Rule now once again when we give back/ du command you can see the attribute for this user is added which is super user right now let's create one more user and then we will see how we can remove the user okay so I'm going to create user two with the same password and then let's list out the users now we have three users right so let's uh say we want to remove the user two now so we will just say drop and then user and then the username which is user two and and then the semicolon and then press enter and it says drop roll and once again list out the users and now we have only two users right so this command can be used to remove the users now there are many commands you can use with this interactive shell which is psql right now in order to know all the possible flags and command you can use with psql I'm going to open the new terminal here and I'm going to just write Ma n psql okay and then press enter and you can see here the short description of this PS psql command how to use this and the long description and then the options you can use with this psql commands so you can see you can uh use so many options with this psql commands and at the bottom you have uh you know you can see so much description here right right so you can uh just go through it whenever you want to and then uh whenever you want to use some command you can uh just refer to this man page for psql and when you press q key it's going to quit okay now the last thing I want to show here is the PG admin client so on Ubuntu if you are on Ubuntu you will be having the access ACC to open to software Center so you can see this icon for the open to software Center just

this same password and then once again go to PG admin and then give the same password here okay and if you want you can select the color I'm not going to select it and then click okay and this is going to uh give you the save warning just click okay and now uh your PG admin client client will connect to the PG or postr SQL database and now you can see we have the Local Host here and once again when you expend this Local Host we have the post gr user right and right now it doesn't have any uh you know databases so you can create the databases from uh this uh psql terminal client also or you can create the databases and tables and schemas from this PG admin interactive you know graphical user interface also okay and that we will see in some other video but for this video I would just wanted to show you how you can uh install post SQL and configure it on your open to operating system so I hope you've enjoyed this video please Rite comment subscribe and bye for now
