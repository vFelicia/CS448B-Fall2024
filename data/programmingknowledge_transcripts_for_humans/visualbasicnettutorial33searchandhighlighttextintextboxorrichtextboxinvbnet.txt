00:00 - hello guys in the last video I have
00:03 - shown you how to open a text file inside
00:06 - your Rich text box now in this video I
00:09 - will show you how to search a particular
00:12 - word inside your Rich text box and
00:16 - highlight it for example with a
00:19 - background color so let's get started
00:22 - for this uh I'm going to take a
00:26 - button and I'm going to take a text box
00:31 - okay and the rich text box I have all I
00:35 - already have from the last video okay so
00:39 - if you want to open the text file inside
00:42 - the rich text box just watch the last
00:44 - video because I'm going to uh just open
00:47 - the text file inside this R text box and
00:50 - search for the word inside this Rich
00:54 - text box so this button text I will
00:57 - change it as uh
01:04 - search and I will just change the font
01:07 - size of these button and text
01:11 - box so I will make
01:15 - it
01:17 - 18
01:25 - okay so whatever word I will enter in
01:29 - this text box and when I press the
01:31 - search button it should highlight all
01:34 - the word which I enter in the search box
01:38 - so now I will uh just double click this
01:41 - search button and in here I will
01:45 - write the code so first of all I will
01:48 - declare uh integer variable so I will
01:51 - write
01:54 - dim
01:56 - index
01:58 - as
02:06 - integer is equal to
02:10 - zero and now I will make a while
02:14 - loop
02:17 - while and inside this while
02:20 - loop I will give a condition so I will
02:25 - write while
02:28 - index is
02:30 - less
02:31 - than Rich textbox
02:36 - one
02:39 - dot
02:41 - text
02:44 - Dot last
02:47 - index
02:50 - off and then in the bracket I will pass
02:56 - the text of the rich text box
03:01 - okay a back out part here uh the text in
03:06 - the text box which uh we are searching
03:09 - for so this text box text will come so
03:15 - just write
03:17 - here textbox
03:20 - one dot text okay and I think I'm
03:28 - messing with the code of why
03:33 - because I'm teaching so many languages
03:36 - at the same time so I get confused
03:40 - sometimes so now this is our while loop
03:44 - okay and inside this while loop I will
03:51 - write Rich text box
03:54 - one dot
03:58 - find okay
04:01 - and this will take four arguments first
04:06 - argument would be so just hover over
04:09 - this uh
04:11 - find and let's see it shows any
04:14 - suggestion or not no right now it's not
04:16 - showing any
04:18 - suggestions so uh this fine takes four
04:22 - uh arguments first argument will be the
04:24 - for word we are searching for so the
04:27 - word we are searching for is in our
04:30 - textbox one so write textbox one
04:34 - dot
04:37 - text and the second thing second
04:41 - argument I would say it takes is the
04:44 - index so just write Index this index
04:48 - which we have uh declared as a variable
04:51 - integer third argument would be the
04:54 - length of the rich text box so write
04:57 - Rich text box one
05:01 - dot
05:10 - length text
05:14 - length and the fourth argument would
05:18 - be
05:20 - rich text box
05:22 - finds
05:24 - dot
05:26 - none
05:27 - Okay so
05:30 - this is these are the four argument just
05:33 - write R textbox doine and inside the
05:36 - bracket pass four argument first
05:39 - argument would be the text we are
05:40 - searching for so we are passing the text
05:43 - in the text box second is the index
05:46 - third is the length of the text in the
05:49 - rich text box and fourth is the rich
05:52 - text box finds. none now once we have uh
05:57 - searched our words or letters now we are
06:02 - going to highlight them so just write
06:05 - Rich textbox
06:07 - one
06:11 - dot selected text not selected T bu
06:17 - selection back color is equal
06:21 - to the color of your choice so for
06:24 - example color
06:27 - dot red
06:29 - I'm searching
06:34 - for let's see if you want okay so this
06:38 - is red color and now I will uh
06:45 - write in the third line of code as
06:49 - index which is my variable is equal
06:52 - to bridge text box
06:56 - one
06:58 - dot
07:00 - text
07:02 - Dot index
07:04 - off and in the bracket I will pass two
07:08 - argument first is the text box name
07:13 - textbox one dot
07:15 - text and the second argument is the
07:20 - index
07:22 - okay and I will add + one this + one I'm
07:27 - doing because uh in the while loop it
07:30 - will search for the word one by one
07:33 - right that's why I'm using this plus one
07:39 - here
07:40 - okay so just write this and this is the
07:44 - code for searching the word and
07:47 - highlighting the word inside the rich
07:49 - text box now we are going to check it so
07:53 - if you want you can just pause the video
07:56 - and copy the
07:57 - code and let's try to run
08:01 - the
08:03 - program so first of all I will open our
08:06 - text file with this uh button which I
08:10 - have shown you in the last video so text
08:13 - file is open and for example let's see
08:16 - what word we need to search for example
08:19 - we need to search this word th the so I
08:24 - will write the inside this text box and
08:28 - when I click this search button it
08:31 - highlights all the word which are th
08:36 - even it also Search the word containing
08:40 - this three letters th right or for
08:45 - example let's see what word we want to
08:48 - search mean for example we want to
08:52 - search
08:53 - mean so I will write mean and
08:56 - click search and search for this mean
09:01 - also and you will uh notice that it
09:04 - will
09:06 - not UNH highlight this uh previous
09:09 - search so this we can do it uh like this
09:15 - so the to solve that problem just write
09:22 - here
09:27 - dim temp
09:31 - as
09:33 - string equal
09:36 - to Rich
09:38 - textbox
09:41 - dot
09:42 - text and what we are going to do is we
09:45 - will empty our Rich text box so we will
09:50 - write
09:51 - this
09:53 - and we will just pass empty string
09:56 - inside our Rich text box and and once
09:59 - again what we will do is we will just
10:03 - pass this temporary
10:06 - string which contains the rich textbox
10:09 - text so just write this and then write
10:14 - temp okay now it will just search for
10:19 - the word we are searching for and it
10:21 - will unhighlight the previous search
10:24 - once again I will run the program I will
10:26 - open the text file
10:29 - and I will search for the word the once
10:32 - again and I will click search and it
10:35 - searches for the word the and once again
10:38 - I want to search once again a new
10:42 - word mean for example and this time
10:46 - it unhighlight the previous search and
10:50 - search for the
10:53 - new word which we are searching for so
10:56 - in this way you can search and highlight
10:59 - the text inside your Rich text box I
11:02 - hope you have enjoyed this video

in the text box which uh we are searching for so this text box text will come so just write here textbox one dot text okay and I think I'm messing with the code of why because I'm teaching so many languages at the same time so I get confused sometimes so now this is our while loop okay and inside this while loop I will write Rich text box one dot find okay and this will take four arguments first argument would be so just hover over this uh find and let's see it shows any suggestion or not no right now it's not showing any suggestions so uh this fine takes four uh arguments first

example color dot red I'm searching for let's see if you want okay so this is red color and now I will uh write in the third line of code as index which is my variable is equal to bridge text box one dot text Dot index off and in the bracket I will pass two argument first is the text box name textbox one dot text and the second argument is the index okay and I will add + one this + one I'm doing because uh in the while loop it will search for the word one by one right that's why I'm using this plus one here okay so just write this and this is the code for searching the word and highlighting
