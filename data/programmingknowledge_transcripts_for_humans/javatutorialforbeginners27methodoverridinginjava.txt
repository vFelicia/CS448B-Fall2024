00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Java programming for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:07 - what is Method
00:09 - overriding and how it's different from
00:12 - method
00:14 - overloading so in the last video I have
00:16 - shown you how and what is polymorphism
00:20 - and how we can use it right so we have
00:23 - defined a super class which we call it
00:27 - as bank and it was having one method
00:32 - called get interest rate which Returns
00:35 - the interest rate uh of the bank okay
00:39 - and we have defined a subass which we
00:44 - call it as Bank ABC which extends from
00:48 - Bank class and let's uh say for now it
00:52 - doesn't have anything so it doesn't have
00:54 - any
00:55 - implementation and now whenever we
00:59 - create
01:00 - the instance or the object of class ABC
01:05 - using the reference of Bank ABC or using
01:10 - the reference of Bank class which is our
01:13 - super class then what happens let's see
01:17 - so it returns you zero right because
01:20 - here in the super class it has the
01:25 - method get interest rate and which
01:28 - returns zero and and here there is no
01:31 - implementation of get interest rate
01:33 - right so whenever we Define a reference
01:36 - which points to the object of the subass
01:39 - in our case this is Bank ABC and when we
01:43 - call this get interest rate
01:49 - function it refers to this uh function
01:54 - which is in the super class right now
01:57 - for example we introduce uh function
02:00 - which has the same name and same return
02:04 - type and same number of arguments as in
02:09 - BL base or super class okay so I have
02:13 - the same implementation in my subass
02:17 - also the only difference is it's
02:19 - returning five and our super class was
02:21 - returning zero interest okay and now
02:26 - earlier the the interest rate returns
02:30 - was zero and now when we run the program
02:34 - it returns five and this phenomena is
02:38 - called method
02:40 - overriding and method overriding is
02:43 - nothing but the changing of the
02:47 - implementation of the method okay so
02:52 - earlier the method which we were using
02:56 - for getting the interest was this one
02:59 - get interest rate from the base class
03:02 - but as soon as we
03:04 - introduce a new method in our
03:07 - subass which is same and it's returning
03:11 - different uh you know interest
03:14 - rate and we Define the object of the
03:18 - subass as a reference then you see it's
03:23 - uh returning five right
03:27 - so your base class or your object will
03:33 - always take the latest or the most
03:36 - recent uh method which is defined so
03:40 - this is the most recent method and it
03:42 - happen it's happening at the runtime
03:45 - that's why it's returning five so this
03:47 - is called method overriding now there
03:50 - are some rules for method overriding the
03:54 - rule of method overriding is you must
03:58 - have same number of
04:00 - arguments same name and same return data
04:05 - type for overriding a method so for
04:08 - example this get get interest method was
04:10 - returning integer and it doesn't take
04:13 - any argument in here also we have to
04:17 - whenever we want to overwrite the method
04:21 - which was there in the super class we
04:23 - have to define
04:26 - the integer return type and with no
04:29 - argument if you do it something like
04:32 - this
04:33 - in uh for example this thing this will
04:37 - be called method overlo loading and this
04:41 - will not be called method
04:43 - overwriting so this uh uh takes us to uh
04:48 - what is the difference between method
04:50 - overloading and Method overriding right
04:54 - so generally method over loading we use
04:58 - in a same same class right so in this if
05:03 - we want to do it we can do it something
05:06 - like this and we can return int ABC
05:11 - something like this okay and this two
05:16 - method are called the method overloading
05:19 - so this method is overloading our
05:22 - previous method right so this generally
05:26 - happens in the same class and whenever
05:29 - you do the method overloading this
05:31 - return type can be
05:34 - different the arguments can be different
05:37 - but the only same thing here is the
05:40 - method name so in method overloading
05:42 - only method name uh should be same but
05:46 - you can change the return type or number
05:48 - of argument
05:50 - also but in the method overriding you
05:53 - cannot change the return type or the
05:55 - number of
05:57 - argument okay so this is the the main
06:00 - difference between method overloading
06:03 - and Method overriding so I hope you have
06:05 - understood the basic concept of meth
06:07 - method overriding and what is the
06:10 - difference between method overloading
06:12 - and Method
06:13 - overriding so that's it for this video

hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Java programming for beginners and in this video we will see what is Method overriding and how it's different from method overloading so in the last video I have shown you how and what is polymorphism and how we can use it right so we have defined a super class which we call it as bank and it was having one method called get interest rate which Returns the interest rate uh of the bank okay and we have defined a subass which we call it as Bank ABC which extends from Bank class and let's uh say for now it doesn't have anything so it doesn't have any implementation and now whenever we create the instance or the object of class ABC using the reference of Bank ABC or using the reference of Bank class which is our super class then what happens let's see so it returns you zero right because here in the super class it has the method get interest rate and which returns zero and and here there is no implementation of get interest rate right so whenever we Define a reference which points to the object of the subass in our case this is Bank ABC and when we call this get interest rate function it refers to this uh function which is in the super class right now for example we introduce uh function which has the same name and same return type and same number of arguments as in BL base or super class okay so I have the same implementation in my subass also the only difference is it's returning five and our super class was returning zero interest okay and now earlier the the interest rate returns was zero and now when we run the program it returns five and this phenomena is called method overriding and method overriding is nothing but the changing of the implementation of the method okay so earlier the method which we were using for getting the interest was this one get interest rate from the base class but as soon as we introduce a new method in our subass which is same and it's returning different uh you know interest rate and we Define the object of the subass as a reference then you see it's uh returning five right so your base class or your object will always take the latest or the most recent uh method which is defined so this is the most recent method and it happen it's happening at the runtime that's why it's returning five so this is called method overriding now there are some rules for method overriding the rule of method overriding is you must have same number of arguments same name and same return data type for overriding a method so for example this get get interest method was returning integer and it doesn't take any argument in here also we have to whenever we want to overwrite the method which was there in the super class we have to define the integer return type and with no argument if you do it something like this in uh for example this thing this will be called method overlo loading and this will not be called method overwriting so this uh uh takes us to uh what is the difference between method overloading and Method overriding right so generally method over loading we use in a same same class right so in this if we want to do it we can do it something like this and we can return int ABC something like this okay and this two method are called the method overloading so this method is overloading our previous method right so this generally happens in the same class and whenever you do the method overloading this return type can be different the arguments can be different but the only same thing here is the method name so in method overloading only method name uh should be same but you can change the return type or number of argument also but in the method overriding you cannot change the return type or the number of argument okay so this is the the main difference between method overloading and Method overriding so I hope you have understood the basic concept of meth method overriding and what is the difference between method overloading and Method overriding so that's it for this video please RIT comment and subscribe and bye for
