00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Java programming for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will
00:06 - discuss what is polymorphism in Java and
00:10 - how we can use polymorphism in Java by
00:15 - an
00:16 - example so what is
00:19 - polymorphism polymorphism is the ability
00:23 - of an object to have different
00:27 - form so polymorphism M literally means
00:32 - the word polymorphism means having
00:35 - different forms and whenever you define
00:38 - a object class object I should
00:42 - say and its property or its quality of
00:46 - having many forms is called
00:49 - polymorphism and how we can make our
00:51 - classes polymorphism or how we can
00:54 - define an object which follows
00:57 - polymorphism I'm going to give an
01:00 - example so I
01:02 - have four classes defined one is called
01:08 - the bank class which will be
01:12 - my Base Class okay so there is uh a bank
01:17 - class which is my base class and this
01:21 - contains three or one method and this
01:26 - method just uh gives the rate of
01:29 - interest so I Define this method as get
01:33 - interest rate and because it's a base
01:36 - class I return I'm returning zero as an
01:39 - interest rate okay I also have defined
01:43 - Bank uncore ABC class bankor DF class
01:50 - and bankor XYZ class okay so if you
01:56 - don't know how to make a class just
01:57 - right click new and go to class and in
02:01 - here give the name of the class so this
02:03 - is how I have created these classes okay
02:07 - so one is called Bank class which will
02:09 - be my main class second class is
02:14 - called bankor ABC which extends from
02:17 - Bank class because Bank class is our
02:20 - Base Class and Bank ABC is our uh
02:24 - derived class and this also contains the
02:28 - same method and and but this Returns the
02:32 - rate of interest or this bank has a rate
02:35 - of interest is equal to 5% for example
02:39 - okay Bank
02:41 - DF which also extends from Bank loss
02:45 - have the rate of interest 6% so I have
02:48 - defined a method here uh which returns
02:51 - six simply okay and Bank class XY Z
02:56 - which is also extending from Bank so
03:00 - this is a derive class and this is a
03:02 - base class also have the same
03:05 - method get interest rate and the
03:08 - interest rate in this bank is 10% so I
03:12 - have the same method in all the four
03:14 - classes get interest rate and the only
03:19 - difference between the this function is
03:22 - the rate of interest Banks Bank itself
03:26 - has
03:27 - zero Bank ABC has 5% interest rate Bank
03:31 - DF has 6% interest rate and Bank XY Z
03:36 - has 10% interest
03:39 - rate now there is a property in Java
03:43 - called polymorphism by which you can
03:47 - Define the reference or you can point
03:51 - the
03:52 - reference to a base class to any object
03:57 - of the derived class so what I mean by
04:01 - that is so when a reference object or
04:06 - reference of parent class points to the
04:10 - object of the subass it's called
04:14 - upcasting and this is the basic uh you
04:19 - know extract of polymorphism so our we
04:24 - will Define the reference of our bank
04:26 - class so we will just Define Bank
04:31 - B1 is equal to or
04:34 - Bank
04:37 - ABC is equal to so this is the reference
04:42 - of Bank class which will point
04:45 - to the object of Bank ABC which is a
04:50 - child class right like
04:53 - this and this is what we call polymos
04:58 - phism when
05:00 - a object can have different form so here
05:04 - the object of Bank class is having the
05:08 - form of bank
05:10 - ABC right so the reference of Bank class
05:14 - is pointing to the object of Bank ABC
05:19 - class in the same way we can
05:23 - Define different objects so here we can
05:28 - Define
05:30 - Bank
05:32 - DF and here also Bank
05:36 - DF and Bank XY
05:40 - Z and
05:43 - Bank x y z okay so and let's see if it
05:51 - has the same name or not
05:54 - yeah and Bank XYZ it should be
05:59 - underscore
06:03 - right okay so we have defined three
06:07 - references of Bank class itself which
06:10 - points to the subclasses or object of
06:14 - subclasses reference ABC points to the
06:17 - object of a bank ABC class reference DF
06:21 - points to the reference object of thef
06:24 - class and reference XYZ points to the
06:28 - object of XY Z
06:31 - class and I can call all these method
06:35 - get interest rate from all these
06:37 - references right so I can just write sis
06:41 - o control
06:43 - shift and in the same way I will do it
06:48 - three times and first time I will take
06:52 - ABC as my object and I will just call
06:56 - get interest rate and in in a
07:00 - second statement I will
07:03 - paste DF do get interest rate and third
07:09 - time I will paste XY Z as my instance
07:15 - and I will call get interest rate okay
07:18 - and when I run the
07:20 - program I get five six and 10 so this
07:27 - type of uh r reference defining
07:30 - reference from the object of subclasses
07:33 - is called
07:34 - polymorphism and all the you know member
07:38 - function are available through this
07:42 - reference so this get instant interest
07:45 - rate are available in here in this class
07:48 - also in this class also in this class
07:50 - also and this Bank ABC gives us 5%
07:55 - interest rate so it returns Five bank DF
07:58 - gives us 6% interest rate so it returns
08:01 - 10 and Bank XY Z gives us 10% interest
08:05 - rate so it returns 10 but the
08:09 - interesting thing here here is all are
08:12 - the object of Bank yeah all or all
08:17 - references are pointing to different
08:20 - objects but all objects are from Bank
08:25 - class right so this is how polymorphism
08:29 - works in Java I hope you have enjoyed

hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Java programming for beginners and in this video we will discuss what is polymorphism in Java and how we can use polymorphism in Java by an example so what is polymorphism polymorphism is the ability of an object to have different form so polymorphism M literally means the word polymorphism means having different forms and whenever you define a object class object I should say and its property or its quality of having many forms is called polymorphism and how we can make our classes polymorphism or how we can define an object which follows polymorphism I'm going to give an example so I have four classes defined one is called the bank class which will be my Base Class okay so there is uh a bank class which is my base class and this contains three or one method and this method just uh gives the rate of interest so I Define this method as get interest rate and because it's a base class I return I'm returning zero as an interest rate okay I also have defined Bank uncore ABC class bankor DF class and bankor XYZ class okay so if you don't know how to make a class just right click new and go to class and in here give the name of the class so this is how I have created these classes okay so one is called Bank class which will be my main class second class is called bankor ABC which extends from Bank class because Bank class is our Base Class and Bank ABC is our uh derived class and this also contains the same method and and but this Returns the rate of interest or this bank has a rate of interest is equal to 5% for example okay Bank DF which also extends from Bank loss have the rate of interest 6% so I have defined a method here uh which returns six simply okay and Bank class XY Z which is also extending from Bank so this is a derive class and this is a base class also have the same method get interest rate and the interest rate in this bank is 10% so I have the same method in all the four classes get interest rate and the only difference between the this function is the rate of interest Banks Bank itself has zero Bank ABC has 5% interest rate Bank DF has 6% interest rate and Bank XY Z has 10% interest rate now there is a property in Java called polymorphism by which you can Define the reference or you can point the reference to a base class to any object of the derived class so what I mean by that is so when a reference object or reference of parent class points to the object of the subass it's called upcasting and this is the basic uh you know extract of polymorphism so our we will Define the reference of our bank class so we will just Define Bank B1 is equal to or Bank ABC is equal to so this is the reference of Bank class which will point to the object of Bank ABC which is a child class right like this and this is what we call polymos phism when a object can have different form so here the object of Bank class is having the form of bank ABC right so the reference of Bank class is pointing to the object of Bank ABC class in the same way we can Define different objects so here we can Define Bank DF and here also Bank DF and Bank XY Z and Bank x y z okay so and let's see if it has the same name or not yeah and Bank XYZ it should be underscore right okay so we have defined three references of Bank class itself which points to the subclasses or object of subclasses reference ABC points to the object of a bank ABC class reference DF points to the reference object of thef class and reference XYZ points to the object of XY Z class and I can call all these method get interest rate from all these references right so I can just write sis o control shift and in the same way I will do it three times and first time I will take ABC as my object and I will just call get interest rate and in in a second statement I will paste DF do get interest rate and third time I will paste XY Z as my instance and I will call get interest rate okay and when I run the program I get five six and 10 so this type of uh r reference defining reference from the object of subclasses is called polymorphism and all the you know member function are available through this reference so this get instant interest rate are available in here in this class also in this class also in this class also and this Bank ABC gives us 5% interest rate so it returns Five bank DF gives us 6% interest rate so it returns 10 and Bank XY Z gives us 10% interest rate so it returns 10 but the interesting thing here here is all are the object of Bank yeah all or all references are pointing to different objects but all objects are from Bank class right so this is how polymorphism works in Java I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
