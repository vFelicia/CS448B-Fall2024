00:00 - hello everyone welcome to programming
00:02 - knowledge today we are going to see how
00:04 - to initialize the vagrant box and SSH
00:07 - into the box and mess around with the
00:09 - box so let's get started so I am in the
00:13 - home directory let's create a blank
00:16 - directory named as a vagrant you can
00:21 - name it whatever you want
00:23 - navigate to the folder so as you can see
00:26 - there is nothing in here it is a
00:28 - complete blank folder to initialize the
00:31 - vagrant box you will have to give the
00:33 - command vagrant in it it will initialize
00:37 - the box but you will have to provide the
00:40 - Box name you want to initialize that is
00:43 - Ubuntu just in 64 it is the open to 14
00:50 - so we want the Ubuntu 14 box as our
00:53 - vagrant box so hit enter what it will do
00:56 - it will create a vagrant pile as it says
00:58 - the vagrant file has been placed in your
01:00 - directory and you are ready to start the
01:03 - box before we start let us see what is
01:05 - in the vagrant file I am just opening
01:09 - Bissell studio could end off a vagrant
01:11 - folder ok this is the vagrant file one
01:20 - thing I want to mention the file icon
01:22 - and the syntax highlighting you are
01:24 - seeing probably you won't see in your
01:27 - system if you want the file icon and
01:29 - syntax highlighting you can install two
01:32 - plugins that is vagrant file support and
01:35 - material icon theme this is the icon
01:37 - theme if you install these two plugins
01:39 - you will be able to see the syntax
01:41 - highlighting and the file icon so let's
01:43 - proceed the lines are followed by the
01:45 - hash symbol are the comments you can
01:47 - just remove it and the line it says
01:51 - vagrant config to do config to is the
01:54 - vagrant file EPA version and config VM
01:57 - box
01:58 - Ubuntu trusts 64 so it is mentioning the
02:01 - vagrant box as Ubuntu trusted 64 if you
02:04 - don't know what you are doing please
02:06 - don't change the number or don't mess
02:09 - around with this line after that you can
02:11 - just remove all
02:12 - comments so let's clean up okay these
02:22 - are the networking part and this is the
02:24 - synchronized folder configuration and it
02:27 - is the provider part where you will
02:29 - mention how to start the box and what is
02:32 - your provider and all that stuff and it
02:34 - is the provision part where you want to
02:36 - mention the packages you want in your
02:38 - vagrant box so let's initialize the box
02:41 - just by uncommenting these two lines by
02:45 - the way we will go into this networking
02:47 - stuff and the file sharing in future
02:50 - videos so let's initialize it and SSH
02:52 - into the box for now these two lines
02:55 - will initialize the box however if you
02:58 - don't uncomment this line it will even
03:00 - start the box because virtualbox is the
03:03 - default one it takes
03:04 - VirtualBox as default provider and it
03:07 - will start the vagrant box so let's save
03:09 - it and start the box by vagrant up so
03:19 - before we start the Box let's see
03:21 - VirtualBox
03:22 - I have these three machines so let's see
03:25 - what happens when we give the vagrant up
03:27 - command hit enter when you first give
03:34 - the command very green tour for the
03:36 - first time it will download a minimal
03:38 - image of the operating system you have
03:41 - mentioned in the vagrant box I have
03:43 - already done this before so it is not
03:45 - going to take much time okay as you can
03:50 - see we grant default and this ID is
03:53 - popped up and it is running now it is
03:58 - just creating a search keys and all the
04:00 - settings
04:10 - okay the vagrant up command has finished
04:14 - so our box is now running and ready so
04:18 - let's SSH into the box by vagrant SSH
04:27 - now as you can see we are no longer in
04:30 - our host operating system we are in the
04:33 - vagrant box that is vagrant at the red
04:35 - vagrant Ubuntu Trust is 64
04:39 - you can even verify that by you name - a
04:45 - Linux vagrant Ubuntu trusted 64 and all
04:48 - the architecture and the system
04:50 - information set source you can do pretty
04:54 - much everything what you can do with the
04:56 - Linux box so let's first update
05:08 - okay the update command is also finished
05:12 - you can install gate Apache too and
05:15 - everything you can run all the Linux
05:18 - command in here so it will install the
05:28 - gate even if your host operating system
05:31 - doesn't have get installed but your V
05:34 - green box has the gate program installed
05:37 - now you can work with gate if you want
05:40 - to install Apache you can install Apache
05:46 - it will install the Apache so we will
05:50 - install Apache and access the box in
05:53 - future videos so let's exit out of this
05:56 - so we are now in our host operating
05:59 - system to destroy it you can give
06:03 - vagrant
06:04 - destroy this command will destroy the
06:08 - vagrant box however it will not remove
06:11 - vagrant file and the hidden vagrant
06:13 - folder in the current directory but it
06:16 - will remove the box from VirtualBox so
06:19 - let's give the command and let's see
06:21 - what happens before giving the destroy
06:25 - command let's suspend it what it will do
06:31 - as you can see it is now running if you
06:33 - will give the command let's see what
06:35 - happens it will shut down the vagrant
06:37 - box its EEP the state and shutdown the
06:41 - vagrant box is now down so if you want
06:43 - to again run the Box you can give
06:46 - vagrant up it will just start the box
06:51 - that is just booting the VM
06:57 - okay now as you can see the vagrant box
07:00 - is now running and it has completed the
07:03 - vagrant up command so if you want to
07:07 - destroy the box you can give this
07:13 - command will delete the box from
07:15 - VirtualBox it is just asking for the
07:17 - permission 80s okay now as you can see
07:21 - the vagrant box is removed from the
07:23 - VirtualBox but if you will see we still
07:27 - have the vagrant file and the vagrant
07:30 - hidden folder so in the next video we
07:33 - will see how to configure the network
07:36 - and share files between your host
07:39 - operating system and your vagrant box
07:41 - thank you for watching
07:50 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone welcome to programming knowledge today we are going to see how to initialize the vagrant box and SSH into the box and mess around with the box so let's get started so I am in the home directory let's create a blank directory named as a vagrant you can name it whatever you want navigate to the folder so as you can see there is nothing in here it is a complete blank folder to initialize the vagrant box you will have to give the command vagrant in it it will initialize the box but you will have to provide the Box name you want to initialize that is Ubuntu just in 64 it is the open to 14 so we want the Ubuntu 14 box as our vagrant box so hit enter what it will do it will create a vagrant pile as it says the vagrant file has been placed in your directory and you are ready to start the box before we start let us see what is in the vagrant file I am just opening Bissell studio could end off a vagrant folder ok this is the vagrant file one thing I want to mention the file icon and the syntax highlighting you are seeing probably you won't see in your system if you want the file icon and syntax highlighting you can install two plugins that is vagrant file support and material icon theme this is the icon theme if you install these two plugins you will be able to see the syntax highlighting and the file icon so let's proceed the lines are followed by the hash symbol are the comments you can just remove it and the line it says vagrant config to do config to is the vagrant file EPA version and config VM box Ubuntu trusts 64 so it is mentioning the vagrant box as Ubuntu trusted 64 if you don't know what you are doing please don't change the number or don't mess around with this line after that you can just remove all comments so let's clean up okay these are the networking part and this is the synchronized folder configuration and it is the provider part where you will mention how to start the box and what is your provider and all that stuff and it is the provision part where you want to mention the packages you want in your vagrant box so let's initialize the box just by uncommenting these two lines by the way we will go into this
