00:00 - hello guys now in this particular video
00:02 - we will be covering uh like one of the
00:04 - script that is the user deletion script
00:06 - okay so basically in this particular
00:08 - video we will use the whatever the thing
00:10 - which we have learned till now in our
00:11 - some previous videos that is the
00:12 - functions and the global variable local
00:14 - variable okay these all things which
00:16 - we'll be using inside our this
00:18 - particular video and we will create the
00:20 - one script that is the user deletion
00:21 - script okay so let me create that file
00:24 - that is the uh 22 underscore user
00:28 - deletion dot sh okay and let me just add
00:35 - uh what we can say
00:37 - Ash call exclamation bin bash okay we
00:41 - will add this uh c bank and now let me
00:44 - just discuss with the workflow what will
00:46 - be the workflow because if you want to
00:47 - do the same thing uh separately on your
00:50 - own then you can do it simply because it
00:52 - will give you the more confidence about
00:54 - in this little scripting so let me just
00:56 - tell you what will be what will we are
00:57 - going to do in this particular video so
00:59 - we will basically read the username
01:02 - whatever the user which we want to
01:03 - delete and we will we just need to
01:05 - provide our the system password for
01:08 - deleting the user and the Dell user
01:11 - command okay so this is all things which
01:13 - you are going to do inside this
01:14 - particular video so let me just comment
01:17 - on this thing
01:19 - and now I will just uh
01:24 - use the local variable and the global
01:26 - variable concept and the function
01:28 - function concept inside this video okay
01:31 - so before deleting the user we'll need
01:34 - to some create uh user okay so how you
01:37 - can create the user we will just use
01:39 - sudo user ad and let me just name it the
01:43 - test okay
01:46 - zero nine eight okay user has been added
01:49 - IO let me just check with the password
01:52 - okay so here you can see test user has
01:55 - been added we have not provided password
01:56 - and all those things because we don't
01:58 - want to create a like a normal user we
02:00 - have to just delete this user that's why
02:02 - okay so the name of the user is our test
02:06 - okay so first what I will do I will just
02:08 - Echo enter the username
02:12 - okay
02:13 - and I will just read the username inside
02:16 - the variable read
02:18 - username okay and then what I will do I
02:23 - will just Echo
02:27 - enter your
02:30 - password
02:32 - it means it is asking me for the
02:34 - whenever we use sudo then it asks me for
02:37 - entering my password okay so that's why
02:40 - I have entered enter your password and I
02:42 - will read here read uh system password I
02:46 - can write okay or current user password
02:49 - you can write the variable name okay or
02:52 - the pseudo or the root user password
02:54 - okay
02:56 - and now I will just uh write the
02:59 - function name as the Dell user okay and
03:03 - inside this tell user I will just Echo
03:07 - uh dollar
03:09 - this one system password
03:12 - okay and I'm just passing this password
03:14 - inside the command that is the sudo
03:17 - using a pipe I will use and I will use
03:19 - pseudo hyphen as hyphen capital S is
03:22 - used whenever we take the input of the
03:24 - password from from different sources
03:26 - like we are getting we will write the
03:30 - password using this okay and with the
03:32 - help of hyphen capital S we can uh like
03:36 - write the password
03:37 - and then I will just write the command
03:39 - that is the tell user and the username
03:41 - okay dollar username okay and then we
03:45 - will have to just call the script tell
03:47 - user
03:48 - okay
03:49 - so here you can see
03:52 - these are the what Global variables okay
03:55 - these are the
03:57 - Global variables okay
04:00 - like username and the system password
04:02 - and these Global variables are being
04:05 - used inside this function okay so this
04:09 - is the normal function and here we are
04:10 - just what we are doing here we are just
04:12 - calling the
04:15 - calling the Dell user function okay and
04:20 - now what I will do I will just move into
04:22 - this particular
04:25 - clear the screen and I will just need to
04:29 - give some permission to this file
04:32 - okay the screen dot slash 22 okay now
04:35 - name of the username is the test and I
04:38 - will need to enter my password
04:40 - okay so removing user test so now done
04:43 - so we have finally removed that
04:46 - particular user if you want to go back
04:47 - and check the status ATC password file
04:51 - so there will be no test user so here
04:55 - you can see there is no test user okay
04:58 - so in this way we can delete the user
05:01 - with our script okay so we have just
05:05 - used the global variable concept which
05:07 - we have got in our previous video and
05:09 - the function concept okay and here we
05:13 - are just passing the name of our uh
05:16 - username which we want to delete and
05:17 - hypheness of hyphen capital S options uh
05:21 - to pass the like um
05:25 - password okay
05:27 - so this is the thing uh I hope you got
05:29 - it how everything is working so that's
05:31 - all for this video and I'll meet you in
05:33 - the next video with some another script
05:34 - okay so thank you guys for watching and
05:36 - I'll meet you in the next video thank
05:38 - you

hello guys now in this particular video we will be covering uh like one of the script that is the user deletion script okay so basically in this particular video we will use the whatever the thing which we have learned till now in our some previous videos that is the functions and the global variable local variable okay these all things which we'll be using inside our this particular video and we will create the one script that is the user deletion script okay so let me create that file that is the uh 22 underscore user deletion dot sh okay and let me just add uh what we can say Ash call exclamation bin bash okay we will add this uh c bank and now let me just discuss with the workflow what will be the workflow because if you want to do the same thing uh separately on your own then you can do it simply because it will give you the more confidence about in this little scripting so let me just tell you what will be what will we are going to do in this particular video so we will basically read the username whatever the user which we want to delete and we will we just need to provide our the system password for deleting the user and the Dell user command okay so this is all things which you are going to do inside this particular video so let me just comment on this thing and now I will just uh use the local variable and the global variable concept and the function function concept inside this video okay so before deleting the user we'll need to some create uh user okay so how you can create the user we will just use sudo user ad and let me just name it the test okay zero nine eight okay user has been added IO let me just check with the password okay so here you can see test user has been added we have not provided password and all those things because we don't want to create a like a normal user we have to just delete this user that's why okay so the name of the user is our test okay so first what I will do I will just Echo enter the username okay and I will just read the username inside the variable read username okay and then what I will do I will just Echo enter your password it means it is asking me for the whenever we use sudo then it asks me for entering my password okay so that's why I have entered enter your password and I will read here read uh system password I can write okay or current user password you can write the variable name okay or the pseudo or the root user password okay and now I will just uh write the function name as the Dell user okay and inside this tell user I will just Echo uh dollar this one system password okay and I'm just passing this password inside the command that is the sudo using a pipe I will use and I will use pseudo hyphen as hyphen capital S is used whenever we take the input of the password from from different sources like we are getting we will write the password using this okay and with the help of hyphen capital S we can uh like write the password and then I will just write the command that is the tell user and the username okay dollar username okay and then we will have to just call the script tell user okay so here you can see these are the what Global variables okay these are the Global variables okay like username and the system password and these Global variables are being used inside this function okay so this is the normal function and here we are just what we are doing here we are just calling the calling the Dell user function okay and now what I will do I will just move into this particular clear the screen and I will just need to give some permission to this file okay the screen dot slash 22 okay now name of the username is the test and I will need to enter my password okay so removing user test so now done so we have finally removed that particular user if you want to go back and check the status ATC password file so there will be no test user so here you can see there is no test user okay so in this way we can delete the user with our script okay so we have just used the global variable concept which we have got in our previous video and the function concept okay and here we are just passing the name of our uh username which we want to delete and hypheness of hyphen capital S options uh to pass the like um password okay so this is the thing uh I hope you got it how everything is working so that's all for this video and I'll meet you in the next video with some another script okay so thank you guys for watching and I'll meet you in the next video thank you
