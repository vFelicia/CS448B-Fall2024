00:01 - hello guys welcome once again in this
00:03 - video I will show you how to use list
00:05 - box with your Visual Basic Windows Form
00:08 - application and this is going to be a
00:11 - very beginner level uh uh tutorial so I
00:15 - will you show you how to use list box
00:19 - how to add items in the list box how to
00:22 - select item in the list box and some
00:24 - other things so let's get
00:27 - started uh let's take a list box from
00:33 - our
00:34 - toolbox and place it here and just
00:39 - resize it and second thing I'm going to
00:42 - take is a
00:44 - button and uh text
00:47 - box okay so I have all the things and
00:51 - I'm not going to change the name of the
00:54 - text box I think by now you know how to
00:58 - change the text box of the tools I'm
01:01 - just going to take change
01:03 - the text of this
01:07 - button and I will say this is my ADD
01:11 - button and whatever I enter in the text
01:15 - box it should go into this list box when
01:19 - I press this button so let's double
01:21 - click this and I will
01:27 - write list box
01:31 - one which is the name of my list box and
01:36 - then
01:38 - Dot and I will
01:42 - say
01:45 - items do
01:47 - add and what I need to
01:51 - add the text in the text box right so
01:56 - this is the name of my text box which is
01:58 - text box one dot
02:02 - text right so let's run our program
02:07 - first and I add
02:10 - some name in the text box and I will say
02:14 - add it's added to the list box once
02:18 - again I
02:19 - will add a name to the text box and it's
02:24 - added to the list box when I click add
02:28 - button okay so so like this you could be
02:31 - able to
02:33 - add items to the list box now let me
02:38 - just show you how you
02:40 - can select an item from the list box so
02:45 - when
02:46 - you select this list box and go to the
02:50 - event
02:51 - here there are some event which you can
02:56 - [Music]
02:57 - perform for using this list box so for
03:00 - example I'm going to use very basic uh
03:04 - or
03:05 - inherent um event of this list box just
03:09 - select it and double click it and when
03:12 - you double click it it shows list box
03:14 - selected index change uh event and you
03:19 - will be able to see here in the event in
03:22 - the properties just click
03:25 - this button here for events and you will
03:28 - see here you you will be able to see
03:31 - this list box selected index change
03:34 - event here there is a
03:37 - text present here so by this you know
03:41 - that this index is selected okay so just
03:45 - double click it and here I will
03:49 - say message
03:53 - box
03:55 - dot
03:57 - show and in the bracket I'm going to
04:00 - show whatever is there in the list box
04:02 - so I will copy list
04:05 - box
04:11 - dot selected
04:14 - item okay and Dot two
04:20 - string
04:22 - okay so whatever I select in the list
04:27 - box it should show in the message box so
04:29 - let's try and run the program let's just
04:33 - add
04:35 - some items in the list
04:43 - box okay so I have this three items and
04:46 - when I select some item here you see
04:50 - here it shows it the same name in the
04:53 - message box so in this way you can
04:57 - select items in the list box
05:00 - right and one more thing is called
05:05 - selected
05:06 - index of the list box so index is
05:11 - something like I will just explain you
05:14 - what is it first of all just write list
05:17 - boox one do selected index from here
05:23 - okay and just run your program once
05:26 - again I will add some text here
05:30 - once again some text and some some text
05:33 - and when you now click this list box for
05:38 - example when you click this first uh
05:41 - item in the list it say says this is the
05:45 - zero index okay so index start from zero
05:49 - then this is one and then this is two so
05:53 - index is uh the numbering you can say
05:57 - for uh the list box and numbering start
06:00 - from zero so this also is very helpful
06:04 - when you are going to use list box in
06:07 - your future
06:09 - projects and there are many things you
06:12 - which you can do with your list box like
06:15 - uh adding the database values to the
06:18 - list box and and many things which are
06:22 - little bit more detailed and little bit
06:27 - Advanced this also I will show you and I
06:29 - will show you how to connect uh your
06:32 - visual Basics application with database
06:36 - like MySQL or some other databases but
06:40 - for now I think this is uh it for this
06:44 - video and please rate comment and
06:46 - subscribe and bye for now
