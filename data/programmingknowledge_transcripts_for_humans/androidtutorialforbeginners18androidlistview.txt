00:01 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:06 - how to use list view in our Android
00:10 - activity so list view you we can use
00:13 - whenever we want to display some list uh
00:17 - in our activity so let's get started and
00:20 - let's see how we can use list view with
00:24 - an
00:25 - example so just go to your pallet I have
00:28 - this blank project made
00:30 - and uh in my activity I'm just going to
00:35 - uh drag and drop a container called list
00:38 - view so drag and drop this container
00:41 - called list view in
00:43 - your Android activity okay now what we
00:47 - are going to do is in order to populate
00:50 - this uh list what we are going to do is
00:53 - we are going to create uh an another
00:57 - layout with uh a text boxes and then we
01:02 - will uh populate multiple text boxes in
01:05 - this uh list view so what I'm going to
01:09 - do is I'm going to right click my layout
01:13 - and go to new and in here the last
01:16 - option uh is the XML file so go to XML
01:21 - and then click layout XML value and then
01:26 - uh give a name to your uh layout so I
01:30 - will name it as for example I want to
01:32 - make a list of names so I will uh name
01:36 - it as
01:37 - uh name list for
01:40 - example name
01:43 - underscore
01:45 - list and I will finish and this will
01:48 - create a new XML file in my layout
01:52 - folder of uh inside the resources folder
01:56 - now I will I'm going to click uh this
01:58 - name underscore list XML file and I'm
02:02 - going to go to the design view of this
02:05 - uh list uh and in here this is a linear
02:11 - layout so I'm going to change this uh
02:14 - tag to text view so just change it
02:21 - to
02:23 - text view okay and same we will do here
02:29 - so so we will initialize and end this
02:32 - text view with the keyword text view
02:36 - right now what we are going to do is uh
02:39 - we will go to our main activity here and
02:43 - in here in our Java folder we will go to
02:46 - the main activity. Java and in here
02:50 - first of all we will declare this uh
02:54 - variable called list view so
03:02 - once you have declared this list view we
03:06 - can create a method for this uh list
03:10 - view item click event right so first of
03:14 - all we will uh make an array to populate
03:19 - our list view so for example we can uh
03:23 - uh make an array of string for names
03:51 - so we have declared uh this array of
03:54 - string and I have declared some uh names
03:57 - inside this array and we going to use
04:00 - this array to uh populate our list view
04:05 - now there is something called adopter
04:07 - and this adopter is like uh you know as
04:13 - the name suggest adopter between the
04:16 - data and the view okay so we are going
04:19 - to declare the adopter and then using
04:22 - this adopter we are going to uh you know
04:25 - join this data and the list view so
04:27 - first of all let's declare a method
04:32 - so
04:35 - public
04:39 - void and we will name it as
04:44 - list view for example and now inside
04:49 - this uh list view what we are going to
04:52 - do is we are going to first of all cast
04:55 - our list view variable which is this one
04:58 - and we will find by
05:05 - ID now we are going to create an adopter
05:09 - for our list view
05:11 - so array adopter and this will be a
05:15 - string adopter or so we will pass string
05:20 - data type for this and then we will name
05:23 - our variable
05:24 - as adopter itself is equal
05:28 - to new
05:30 - array adopter
05:32 - and in here this takes three argument
05:37 - one is the context which is uh this
05:40 - itself second is the you know list
05:45 - sample list so we have created this uh
05:49 - name undor list layout here right so
05:53 - what we are going to do is we can call
05:55 - this by R do layout Dot
06:01 - name
06:02 - list right and then it takes the data so
06:06 - for us the data is this strings of name
06:11 - or array of name right so we will just
06:14 - pass uh this array of name as the third
06:17 - argument and now we can use our list
06:21 - view to load this so list view do set
06:26 - adopter and we can pass this adopter
06:30 - inside this uh set adopter function okay
06:35 - and what it's going to do is it's going
06:37 - to uh load all the data into our list
06:41 - view okay now uh let's add some
06:45 - functionality of uh to our list view so
06:48 - whenever we uh click some item of the
06:50 - list it should uh display the content of
06:53 - the list or something like this in the
06:55 - message right so let's uh do this
07:00 - first of all what we are going to do is
07:02 - we are going to take our list View and
07:05 - we will
07:06 - set item click event so we will
07:11 - set item click event okay or set onclick
07:18 - item right so just choose this option
07:22 - called set on item click list now and
07:25 - inside this set on item click list now
07:28 - we will create create
07:30 - new on item click
07:34 - listener and inside uh this uh function
07:38 - on item click we can uh use this uh
07:44 - position of
07:45 - the item or ID of the item to uh you
07:50 - know display something okay so for
07:53 - example uh we can use this position and
07:57 - what we can do is
08:00 - using this position we can uh uh you
08:04 - know get the value of the item so I'm
08:08 - going
08:08 - to create a string variable and I will
08:12 - name it as
08:15 - value is equal to we will cast the value
08:20 - so string and then we will take our list
08:26 - View and Dot get
08:31 - item okay so we will take the item at
08:35 - the position
08:37 - okay and we will pass this
08:40 - item called position here or this
08:44 - position here so it takes the position
08:46 - and now we have uh the you
08:49 - know name of the item at this position
08:53 - whatever we click okay so we will use
08:56 - toast to display the value and the
08:58 - position toast dot make text and it
09:03 - takes uh three argument as we know first
09:06 - is the name of your activity or
09:11 - context dot
09:14 - this second argument it takes is the
09:18 - message itself so we are going to create
09:22 - some message for
09:25 - example and we will take this position
09:28 - from here
09:30 - and then we can display the value
09:38 - right
09:39 - value and this value we can take from
09:45 - this string value
09:48 - right okay now the third argument we
09:52 - will pass here
09:55 - is the
09:57 - toast Dot
10:00 - length Okay and then we will show this
10:03 - toast and now our function is done right
10:08 - so not now what we are going to do is we
10:10 - are just going to call this function in
10:13 - a oncreate method in
10:17 - here and now we are going to run our
10:21 - program so now our program is running
10:24 - and you can see all the names uh are
10:26 - populated inside our list and the these
10:29 - names are uh these names right and once
10:34 - we click on some name for example this
10:37 - name we can see the position of this
10:40 - name is zero because index of the list
10:42 - starts from zero and the name appears
10:46 - the value is Tom right once uh we click
10:49 - this name called Mark the position is
10:52 - one and value is Mark we will click
10:55 - third name position is two value is John
10:59 - okay okay so in this way you can
11:01 - populate uh list View using uh your
11:07 - string or or using this
11:10 - adopter right so I hope you have enjoyed

hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Android app development for beginners and in this video we will see how to use list view in our Android activity so list view you we can use whenever we want to display some list uh in our activity so let's get started and let's see how we can use list view with an example so just go to your pallet I have this blank project made and uh in my activity I'm just going to uh drag and drop a container called list view so drag and drop this container called list view in your Android activity okay now what we are going to do is in order to populate this uh list what we are going to do is we are going to create uh an another layout with uh a text boxes and then we will uh populate multiple text boxes in this uh list view so what I'm going to do is I'm going to right click my layout and go to new and in here the last option uh is the XML file so go to XML and then click layout XML value and then uh give a name to your uh layout so I will name it as for example I want to make a list of names so I will uh name it as uh name list for example name underscore list and I will finish and this will create a new XML file in my layout folder of uh inside the resources folder now I will I'm going to click uh this name underscore list XML file and I'm going to go to the design view of this uh list uh and in here this is a linear layout so I'm going to change this uh tag to text view so just change it to text view okay and same we will do here so so we will initialize and end this text view with the keyword text view right now what we are going to do is uh we will go to our main activity here and in here in our Java folder we will go to the main activity. Java and in here first of all we will declare this uh variable called list view so once you have declared this list view we can create a method for this uh list view item click event right so first of all we will uh make an array to populate our list view so for example we can uh uh make an array of string for names so we have declared uh this array of string and I have declared some uh names inside this array and we going to use this array to uh populate our list view now there is something called adopter and this adopter is like uh you know as the name suggest adopter between the data and the view okay so we are going to declare the adopter and then using this adopter we are going to uh you know join this data and the list view so first of all let's declare a method so public void and we will name it as list view for example and now inside this uh list view what we are going to do is we are going to first of all cast our list view variable which is this one and we will find by ID now we are going to create an adopter for our list view so array adopter and this will be a string adopter or so we will pass string data type for this and then we will name our variable as adopter itself is equal to new array adopter and in here this takes three argument one is the context which is uh this itself second is the you know list sample list so we have created this uh name undor list layout here right so what we are going to do is we can call this by R do layout Dot name list right and then it takes the data so for us the data is this strings of name or array of name right so we will just pass uh this array of name as the third argument and now we can use our list view to load this so list view do set adopter and we can pass this adopter inside this uh set adopter function okay and what it's going to do is it's going to uh load all the data into our list view okay now uh let's add some functionality of uh to our list view so whenever we uh click some item of the list it should uh display the content of the list or something like this in the message right so let's uh do this first of all what we are going to do is we are going to take our list View and we will set item click event so we will set item click event okay or set onclick item right so just choose this option called set on item click list now and inside this set on item click list now we will create create new on item click listener and inside uh this uh function on item click we can uh use this uh position of the item or ID of the item to uh you know display something okay so for example uh we can use this position and what we can do is using this position we can uh uh you know get the value of the item so I'm going to create a string variable and I will name it as value is equal to we will cast the value so string and then we will take our list View and Dot get item okay so we will take the item at the position okay and we will pass this item called position here or this position here so it takes the position and now we have uh the you know name of the item at this position whatever we click okay so we will use toast to display the value and the position toast dot make text and it takes uh three argument as we know first is the name of your activity or context dot this second argument it takes is the message itself so we are going to create some message for example and we will take this position from here and then we can display the value right value and this value we can take from this string value right okay now the third argument we will pass here is the toast Dot length Okay and then we will show this toast and now our function is done right so not now what we are going to do is we are just going to call this function in a oncreate method in here and now we are going to run our program so now our program is running and you can see all the names uh are populated inside our list and the these names are uh these names right and once we click on some name for example this name we can see the position of this name is zero because index of the list starts from zero and the name appears the value is Tom right once uh we click this name called Mark the position is one and value is Mark we will click third name position is two value is John okay okay so in this way you can populate uh list View using uh your string or or using this adopter right so I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and buy from the
