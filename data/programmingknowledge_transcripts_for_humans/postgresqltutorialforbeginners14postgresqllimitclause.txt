00:00 - hello friends welcome to programs
00:02 - knowledge in this video we will see how
00:05 - we can use limit clause in sequel Paris
00:09 - so first word open your terminal at PS
00:14 - given so let us see we charge a rate
00:19 - about this present for our system so we
00:23 - have this many of databases and be able
00:25 - to use this one test so for connecting
00:28 - to the test database right let us see
00:40 - okay so now we are connected to test
00:43 - database and we have two tables employ
00:48 - whatever and story table so what is the
00:52 - use of limit ones actually let me first
00:56 - show you so it has turned rows and it is
01:06 - displaying their 10 rows so one thing
01:09 - that you can notice from here whenever
01:11 - we are using this type or select
01:14 - statement the result will contain all
01:18 - the rows that are present in our table
01:20 - it's showing all the rows but what if we
01:24 - don't want all the data I want only
01:27 - first 5 rows or only 7 rows or only 3
01:31 - rows so how to set a limit for them so
01:35 - in order to settle in it we are going to
01:37 - use that limit keyword right student and
01:46 - second image now how many rows do I want
01:51 - let's say I amount only 3 rows then I
01:54 - write thing and it may show me only
01:58 - zeros if I want 9 rows I don't want the
02:06 - last row then it will show me 9 rows you
02:10 - know so mean
02:11 - last one okay so let me just grate it
02:17 - and open to G at me okay let's employ we
02:31 - have three rows only here and you live
02:34 - on one row yes and one more thing you
02:40 - can also use expression here like
02:44 - computable doesn't have money so let me
02:48 - use to run table limit to that say 2
02:53 - into 3 minus 1 so that will be 5
02:58 - anything whopping it goes to - and still
03:07 - I think the plus and negative marking
03:12 - does not affect in this ok so let me
03:15 - write for rusty anything we get 7 toes
03:26 - so this is how we can use limit clause
03:29 - in encyclicals thanks for watching
