00:00 - hello everyone welcome to altrex
00:02 - tutorials in this video we are going to
00:05 - take a look at some of the tools
00:07 - that are present in the join tab of the
00:10 - alteryx tools
00:12 - in the previous videos we have already
00:14 - seen the in out tab and the preparation
00:16 - tab and their individual tools that are
00:18 - going to be useful for us
00:21 - while preparing the workflows in ultrix
00:24 - in this video we are going to start a
00:26 - new tab that is the join tab so without
00:28 - any further ado let us start with the
00:30 - video in this video we are going to talk
00:33 - about a very special tool known as the
00:35 - append fields tool this append fields
00:37 - tool is present in the join tab as you
00:39 - can see denoted by a purple color
00:42 - now before starting with this tool what
00:44 - i have already done is i have already
00:47 - input
00:48 - my data that is the sample superstore
00:50 - data
00:52 - and from that data set i have taken the
00:54 - orders sheet
00:55 - in case you don't know where to get this
00:57 - data from you can simply google sample
00:59 - super store excel and that data set
01:01 - would be downloaded for you the reason
01:03 - why we are choosing this data set is
01:05 - because it is having a wide variety of
01:07 - data ranging from text to numbers
01:09 - location
01:10 - everything that one could ask for
01:12 - furthermore the data set is completely
01:14 - clean there are no inconsistencies so it
01:16 - would be easier for us to work on it
01:19 - and
01:20 - once you have downloaded the data set
01:22 - using the
01:23 - input tool you can simply just input the
01:25 - data then i have used two data cleansing
01:28 - tools
01:29 - which are in the preparation tab to
01:31 - clean the data
01:33 - now uh in case you're wondering what i
01:35 - have done over here i recommend you to
01:36 - just go through the previous videos
01:38 - where i've explained this process in a
01:40 - step-by-step fashion
01:41 - now once we have done with all this let
01:43 - us just go back to our append fields
01:45 - tool and bring it up over here
01:48 - as you can see the append fields tool
01:49 - has two anchors on the input that is t
01:52 - and s
01:54 - uh t stands for target and s stands for
01:57 - source and there is one output anchor so
01:59 - let us understand first of all what is
02:01 - this tool all about append fields tool
02:04 - is used to append the fields of one
02:06 - small input which is taken as a source
02:08 - denoted by the s over here to every
02:11 - record of another larger input that is
02:13 - the target
02:14 - the result is a cartesian join now in a
02:17 - cartesian join every row from one table
02:19 - is joined to every row of the other
02:21 - table
02:22 - like if there are two tables uh table
02:24 - one has like hundred rows and table two
02:26 - has thousand rows so the cartesian join
02:28 - would be hundred and two thousand that
02:30 - is a hundred thousand rows in total
02:33 - so this is what happens in the cartesian
02:34 - join and in case you want to perform a
02:37 - cartesian join on your tables then you
02:39 - can use this append fields option okay
02:42 - the append field tool accepts two inputs
02:44 - which is again a target and a source the
02:46 - target is a larger data stream and the
02:48 - source is a smaller data stream that
02:50 - provides the records that are added to
02:52 - the target stream okay
02:54 - uh now in order to configure the tool
02:56 - here we can see the configuration panel
02:58 - over here
02:59 - we can use this table to modify the
03:01 - incoming data stream
03:02 - uh here each row is representing an
03:05 - individual column in the table as you
03:08 - can see row id order id order date ship
03:10 - date shipment etc
03:11 - now here what are the options what are
03:13 - the things that we can do is
03:17 - we can modify the type of the column
03:19 - like uh right now it's double but if you
03:21 - want to change it to anything else you
03:22 - can change it like i want int 16 over
03:25 - here so that its size also decreases if
03:27 - in the case of the strings you want to
03:29 - change the size you can do that as well
03:31 - if you want to rename a column that also
03:34 - you can do like instead of the row id i
03:36 - want s number to be present over here
03:38 - serial number okay
03:39 - so sno is what i want to uh rename it
03:43 - in case you want to provide a
03:45 - description for your columns that you
03:46 - can also provide
03:49 - now what would happen is once the
03:51 - correlation join is performed this is
03:53 - how the columns would be treated like
03:54 - with the description with the renamed
03:55 - value and with the modified type over
03:57 - here okay
03:59 - now uh this is a one thing that you can
04:01 - do now in case you want to select
04:03 - multiple fields like this then there is
04:05 - this options button that is present
04:07 - there are a bunch of options that you
04:08 - can use like save or load
04:11 - that means you can save the field
04:12 - configuration as a dot y x f t file
04:16 - which is alterix field type file um that
04:19 - can be used in other workflows
04:22 - as well
04:23 - then we can use the select option to
04:25 - either select all of the columns or
04:27 - deselect them all
04:29 - we can change the field type of the
04:30 - highlighted fields this is only uh
04:32 - available if all the fields that you
04:34 - have highlighted are the same type so
04:36 - you can just change them to
04:39 - a common or a mutual type right
04:41 - next we have is the sort option which is
04:43 - of course used to sort the columns
04:46 - in assigning all the descending orders
04:48 - like uh sort on the original field name
04:50 - on a new field name on the field type or
04:52 - a revert to the incoming field auto next
04:55 - we have is the move option that is used
04:57 - to move the highlighted columns to the
04:58 - top or the bottom of the list if you
05:01 - want to perform this option
05:03 - if you want to add some prefix to the
05:05 - field names if you want to add suffix to
05:06 - the field names if you want to remove
05:08 - any prefix remove any suffix or if you
05:10 - want to uh clear all the renames that
05:13 - you have done so far that you can do
05:16 - using this uh if you want uh the
05:19 - highlighted fields only whose renames
05:21 - you want to clear that also you can do
05:23 - revert all the original type and size
05:24 - that means all of the changes that you
05:26 - have done would be
05:27 - unchanged
05:28 - and
05:30 - so on these are all the options uh that
05:32 - we have available
05:34 - next we have is
05:37 - this option one slash error on too many
05:39 - records being generated so
05:41 - uh in this append fields tool it
05:44 - performs a cartesian join which means
05:45 - the number of the rows of both of these
05:48 - tables are actually multiplied with one
05:50 - another that means a huge number of rows
05:52 - would be generated right
05:54 - so
05:55 - it is a possibility that unintentionally
05:57 - you can produce so many errors
06:00 - so you can configure the warnings or
06:02 - errors to be reported so that not too
06:05 - many records are being produced now for
06:08 - this we have three options allow all
06:10 - appends that means all records should be
06:11 - appended to all the records with no
06:13 - error or warning
06:15 - next is one appends of more than three
06:18 - 16 records
06:19 - like if there are more than 16 records
06:21 - in the source file
06:23 - a warning is reported and the workflow
06:25 - continues processing
06:27 - third option is error on appends of more
06:29 - than 16 records so if there are more
06:31 - than 16 records in the source file then
06:34 - the error is reported and the workflow
06:36 - stops it processing so it is just to
06:38 - save the memory and provide a
06:41 - fail safe in case of the errors right so
06:44 - i am going to go with all allow all
06:46 - appends just for this case to show you
06:48 - how this tool is going to work okay
06:52 - so here i have actually
06:55 - run the append fields tool let me
06:57 - explain to you quickly that what i have
06:59 - done
07:00 - uh the target we have
07:02 - already taken
07:04 - in the case of source what we have done
07:06 - is we have taken a few records around
07:09 - 5000 records for the source now where
07:11 - these records come from
07:14 - from the target itself we created three
07:16 - separate excel sheets on the basis of
07:18 - segment so if you just go to this
07:21 - particular data here you will find that
07:23 - there is this field called segment it
07:25 - has three possible values consumer
07:28 - home office and corporate
07:31 - these are the three segments okay so uh
07:34 - these three excel sheets were created in
07:36 - one excel sheet all the consumer related
07:38 - records were there in another there were
07:40 - all corporate related records and so on
07:43 - so just like that i have taken one more
07:45 - excel sheet which contains all the
07:47 - consumer records now this would act as
07:49 - my source because source is usually
07:52 - smaller in size than the target
07:54 - so a total of 5191 records were in this
07:57 - and a total of 9994 records were in this
08:01 - as you can see over here the number of
08:03 - the records is shown
08:04 - so what i have done is uh i have used
08:08 - these two things in the append tool and
08:10 - run this after running it i applied a
08:13 - browse tool the browse tool is nothing
08:16 - but it helps us to you know
08:19 - see that what is going on inside the
08:21 - tool if you just uh click over this
08:24 - append fields tool then you will see
08:26 - that this is the targets field
08:28 - it is same the changes that we did here
08:30 - that was renaming the serial name number
08:33 - row id to serial number is not been
08:35 - reflected over here and in the source we
08:37 - have the row id again with all the
08:39 - records present over here
08:41 - but as soon as we added the browse tool
08:43 - and click on run then it is going to
08:46 - show me the updated records like how
08:48 - many records were taken from there so a
08:50 - 5191 records from the consumer that
08:53 - means the source and 9994 records from
08:56 - the orders sheet that is the actual data
08:59 - set now it's going to take a few seconds
09:01 - and here you can see the percentage of
09:03 - the process that has been completed
09:06 - uh and
09:07 - along with this you can see the memory
09:09 - that it is being occupied right now it's
09:11 - 4.9 gb so let's just give it a few
09:13 - seconds
09:14 - and uh see what happens when it's fully
09:16 - run so let us make after it's completed
09:20 - fully after it's fully executed
09:23 - now uh the whole
09:25 - process has run
09:27 - and you can see uh due to the browse
09:29 - tool we are able to see
09:31 - that uh the first row that was row id
09:34 - initially has been changed to serial
09:36 - number
09:37 - and now we are getting uh
09:40 - the combination of the records that is
09:43 - um
09:44 - target
09:45 - the number of rows of the target
09:46 - multiplied by the number of rows of the
09:48 - source so this is the total number of
09:50 - records that we are getting and this is
09:52 - the size that is 7.9 gb so this is how
09:54 - the append fields tool or the cartesian
09:56 - join works in ultrix that's all for this
09:59 - video thanks for watching

hello everyone welcome to altrex tutorials in this video we are going to take a look at some of the tools that are present in the join tab of the alteryx tools in the previous videos we have already seen the in out tab and the preparation tab and their individual tools that are going to be useful for us while preparing the workflows in ultrix in this video we are going to start a new tab that is the join tab so without any further ado let us start with the video in this video we are going to talk about a very special tool known as the append fields tool this append fields tool is present in the join tab as you can see denoted by a purple color now before starting with this tool what i have already done is i have already input my data that is the sample superstore data and from that data set i have taken the orders sheet in case you don't know where to get this data from you can simply google sample super store excel and that data set would be downloaded for you the reason why we are choosing this data set is because it is having a wide variety of data ranging from text to numbers location everything that one could ask for furthermore the data set is completely clean there are no inconsistencies so it would be easier for us to work on it and once you have downloaded the data set using the input tool you can simply just input the data then i have used two data cleansing tools which are in the preparation tab to clean the data now uh in case you're wondering what i have done over here i recommend you to just go through the previous videos where i've explained this process in a stepbystep fashion now once we have done with all this let us just go back to our append fields tool and bring it up over here as you can see the append fields tool has two anchors on the input that is t and s uh t stands for target and s stands for source and there is one output anchor so let us understand first of all what is this tool all about append fields tool is used to append the fields of one small input which is taken as a source denoted by the s over here to every record of another larger input that is the target the result is a cartesian join now in a cartesian join every row from one table is joined to every row of the other table like if there are two tables uh table one has like hundred rows and table two has thousand rows so the cartesian join would be hundred and two thousand that is a hundred thousand rows in total so this is what happens in the cartesian join and in case you want to perform a cartesian join on your tables then you can use this append fields option okay the append field tool accepts two inputs which is again a target and a source the target is a larger data stream and the source is a smaller data stream that provides the records that are

sno is what i want to uh rename it in case you want to provide a description for your columns that you can also provide now what would happen is once the correlation join is performed this is how the

this uh if you want uh the highlighted fields only whose renames you want to clear that also you can do revert all the original type and size that means all of the changes that you have done would be unchanged and so on these are all the options uh that we have available next we have is this option one slash error on too many records being generated so uh in this append fields tool it performs a cartesian join which means the number of the rows of both of these tables are actually multiplied with one another that means a huge number of rows would be generated right so it is a possibility that

this video thanks for watching
