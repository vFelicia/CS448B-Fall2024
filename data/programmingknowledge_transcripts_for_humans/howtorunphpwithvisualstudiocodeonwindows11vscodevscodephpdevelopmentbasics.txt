00:00 - hey guys in this video i'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can run your php file on
00:06 - your visual studio code editor
00:08 - on your windows 11 operating system so
00:10 - for this you will need two things first
00:13 - one is the xampp server which will help
00:16 - you to run your php files and then you
00:20 - need the visual studio code editor so if
00:22 - you don't know how to install visual
00:24 - studio code or how to install xampp
00:27 - server
00:28 - i will put the link of those two videos
00:30 - in the description so you can click on
00:33 - those link and see how you can install
00:35 - visual studio code and xampp
00:38 - once you have these two things let's
00:40 - start
00:41 - so first of all we need to start our
00:44 - xampp server so you will find your xampp
00:48 - server under the windows start button so
00:50 - click on the windows start button and
00:52 - then click on all apps and then scroll
00:55 - down until you see a zamp here and then
00:58 - click on zamp control panel which is
01:00 - going to start
01:01 - the zamp control panel so from here you
01:04 - need to start the apache server so i'm
01:07 - going to click on the start button to
01:08 - start the apache server you can also
01:10 - start the mysql server from here so
01:13 - start apache and mysql from here so once
01:16 - that's done and you will see a green
01:19 - around these two uh
01:21 - servers then both of them are running
01:23 - once these two servers are running just
01:26 - minimize this window now we need to go
01:28 - to the location where we have installed
01:30 - the xampp server by default it's
01:33 - installed in the c directory so i'm
01:35 - going to go to my c directory
01:37 - and then i'm going to just go
01:40 - under this xampp or xampp folder so
01:44 - click on this zam folder
01:46 - and then here you need to go inside this
01:49 - htdocs folder
01:51 - so once you are inside this htdocs
01:54 - folder
01:55 - you can create
01:57 - any folder of your choice where you want
01:59 - to save all of your php files
02:03 - so you can right click here and then
02:05 - create a new folder
02:07 - and name it anything
02:10 - so i'm going to name my folder as
02:12 - my
02:13 - app you can give any name to your folder
02:17 - in my case it's my app and then i'm
02:19 - going to press enter
02:21 - and then i'm going to go inside my
02:23 - folder
02:24 - now in here you can create a php file
02:27 - so in order to create a php file on
02:30 - windows you need to create a text file
02:32 - and then change the extension of it
02:34 - otherwise you can open visual studio
02:37 - code here right
02:39 - so right click here and then click on
02:42 - show more options and you will be able
02:44 - to see this option which says open with
02:46 - code so just click on this option
02:49 - which is going to
02:50 - open this folder my app in visual studio
02:54 - code otherwise if you don't want to open
02:57 - it from here you can just open visual
02:59 - studio code first of all
03:01 - and then you can just copy the path of
03:04 - your folder which you have created
03:06 - recently
03:07 - and then click on file and then click on
03:10 - open folder
03:12 - and then just
03:14 - give the path here and then and then
03:16 - click on select folder
03:18 - which is going to open the same folder
03:21 - right
03:22 - so once you have opened this same folder
03:25 - which is
03:26 - essentially this folder which we have
03:28 - created
03:29 - you can see this folder name is my app
03:32 - here we can create our php file so i'm
03:35 - going to name my
03:37 - php file as
03:38 - test
03:39 - dot php here okay and then press enter
03:44 - and at this point visual studio code is
03:46 - going to recognize that you want to
03:49 - write some php code and you can see
03:52 - cannot validate since a php
03:54 - initialization could not be found
03:57 - use the settings php path to configure
04:01 - this php executable right
04:05 - so for now we are going to
04:07 - just close this window otherwise if you
04:10 - want to set
04:11 - the php exe file then you can click on
04:15 - the open settings option but we want to
04:18 - run php using
04:20 - the
04:21 - xampp server right so we are using right
04:24 - now visual studio code as just the
04:27 - editor and everything will be taken care
04:31 - by
04:32 - our
04:33 - xampp server so here you can just write
04:36 - a very simple php hello world program
04:39 - like this which just prints hello world
04:42 - in order to test whether it's running or
04:44 - not and once you are done just save your
04:47 - file and once the file is saved
04:50 - we can go to our browser and then just
04:53 - type localhost and if you have added
04:57 - some port you can also type some
05:00 - port here
05:01 - you can know the port on which your
05:05 - apache server is running by just viewing
05:08 - this port under port
05:10 - you can see it's running on port 80 in
05:13 - my case
05:14 - and
05:15 - by default the local host will run on
05:18 - port 80.
05:19 - if it's running on any other port you
05:22 - need to type colon and then
05:24 - the number of port if it's running on
05:26 - port 8080 then you just need to type the
05:29 - port number here right
05:31 - you can just type
05:32 - localhost colon 80 which essentially
05:34 - mean localhost and then i'm going to
05:37 - press enter here you can see the apache
05:39 - server is running
05:41 - now in order to see your php file
05:44 - what you need to do
05:46 - you need to just open the same
05:49 - folder structure
05:50 - so you need to type the name of your
05:54 - folder which is my app and then
05:56 - test.php right
05:58 - so instead of dashboard just write the
06:01 - name of the folder in which
06:03 - your php file is there and then the name
06:06 - of your file which is test dot php in my
06:10 - case right and then press enter
06:13 - and it's going to show you this result
06:15 - which is hello world
06:17 - and you can see what we have printed
06:19 - hello world right
06:20 - i can also add some more
06:24 - text here and then save this file
06:27 - and then i can just refresh this file
06:30 - and it's going to show me the output
06:32 - right so
06:33 - this is how you can run your php files
06:36 - with visual studio code on your windows
06:39 - 11 operating system now if in case you
06:41 - want to run your php files using command
06:44 - prompt
06:46 - or command line
06:47 - then what you can do
06:50 - so for that you might need to add the
06:53 - php in your environment variables right
06:56 - so if you have installed xampp the path
07:00 - for php executable file is you once
07:03 - again need to go to your c directory and
07:05 - then go under zamp folder
07:08 - and here you will be able to see the php
07:11 - folder right
07:12 - so here you will be able to see all the
07:15 - php related files and you can use
07:18 - php.exe to run your php files right
07:22 - so just copy the path
07:24 - in which your php.exe file is there and
07:27 - if you have installed the zamp and if
07:30 - you have installed the zamp in the c
07:32 - directory just copy this path which i
07:35 - have copied and then
07:37 - just click on the search icon here and
07:39 - then
07:40 - just type environment variables so just
07:43 - type
07:45 - environment
07:47 - and once you type few letters of
07:49 - environment you will be able to see this
07:50 - option which says edit the system
07:52 - environment variables so i'm going to
07:55 - click on this
07:56 - and it's going to open this window so
07:59 - here just click on environment variables
08:02 - and then select the path environment
08:05 - variable under system variables and then
08:08 - click on edit or double click on it
08:11 - here we are going to add a new
08:12 - environment variable and then
08:14 - just paste the path which we have copied
08:18 - uh which is the path of our php
08:21 - directory inside our xampp folder okay
08:25 - i'm going to press enter here and then
08:27 - click on ok ok and ok
08:30 - so once you have set the environment
08:33 - variables
08:34 - you might need to restart your
08:37 - visual studio code so i'm going to just
08:40 - exit
08:41 - visual studio code and i'm going to
08:43 - restart my visual studio code in the
08:45 - same directory in which my php file is
08:48 - there in my case it's my app and in my
08:52 - app i have this
08:54 - test.php file right
08:57 - now once i have restarted my visual
08:59 - studio code i can open the terminal from
09:01 - here so i'm going to click on terminal
09:03 - and then new terminal
09:05 - and here
09:07 - you can see it has started this
09:10 - powershell terminal for me
09:12 - and
09:13 - in the right hand side i can see the
09:15 - list of all the terminals right so once
09:18 - again terminal new terminal
09:20 - and by default because powershell is the
09:22 - default terminal on my windows 11
09:25 - operating system it opens
09:27 - the same folder in
09:29 - the powershell if you are not a fan of
09:32 - powershell you can also open the command
09:34 - prompt from here so click on arrow
09:37 - command prompt
09:38 - and it will open the command prompt
09:41 - now if you know some php commands you
09:45 - might also know that in order to run
09:47 - your php file you can just type php and
09:50 - the name of your file which is test.php
09:53 - in my case and then press enter
09:56 - and you can see it prints the output
09:58 - which is hello world so this was
10:01 - possible because we have set the php
10:04 - environment variable right if php
10:08 - environment variable is not set
10:10 - this command is not going to work right
10:13 - and if it's not working just restart
10:15 - your visual studio code once again
10:18 - and try it so if you want to test small
10:21 - php scripts you can directly test these
10:24 - scripts from here
10:26 - otherwise you can
10:28 - always use
10:30 - this browser where
10:31 - your output will be shown right
10:34 - in addition
10:36 - you can also install some popular
10:39 - extensions related to php right so when
10:42 - you uh just click on this extensions
10:47 - icon here
10:48 - you will be able to see
10:50 - the extensions which are popular you can
10:53 - also search for the extension for php
10:55 - just type php in the search box
10:57 - and it's going to show
10:59 - all the popular php
11:01 - related extensions so you can see
11:04 - this one is most popular here
11:07 - and it's developed by
11:09 - xdebug
11:11 - and the number of downloads here is

11:16 - so you can click on install and then
11:19 - just install this extension
11:21 - and this will help you to debug your php
11:24 - code
11:25 - using visual studio code editor you also
11:28 - have the other popular extensions for
11:31 - let's say php code intelligence for

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys in this video i'm going to show you how you can run your php file on your visual studio code editor on your windows 11 operating system so for this you will need two things first one is the xampp server which will help you to run your php files and then you need the visual studio code editor so if you don't know how to install visual studio code or how to install xampp server i will put the link of those two videos in the description so you can click on those link and see how you can install visual studio code and xampp once you have these two things let's start so first of all we need to start our xampp server so you will find your xampp server under the windows start button so click on the windows start button and then click on all apps and then scroll down until you see a zamp here and then click on zamp control panel which is going to start the zamp control panel so from here you need to start the apache server so i'm going to click on the start button to start the apache server you can also start the mysql server from here so start apache and mysql from here so once that's done and you will see a green around these two uh servers then both of them are running once these two servers are running just minimize this window now we need to go to the location where we have installed the xampp server by default it's installed in the c directory so i'm going to go to my c directory and then i'm going to just go under this xampp or xampp folder so click on this zam folder and then here you need to go inside this htdocs folder so once you are inside this htdocs folder you can create any folder of your choice where you want to save all of your php files so you can right click here and then create a new folder and name it anything so i'm going to name my folder as my app you can give any name to your folder in my case it's my app and then i'm going to press enter and then i'm going to go inside my folder now in here you can create a php file so in order to create a php file on windows you need to create a text file and then change the extension of it otherwise you can open visual studio code here right so right click here and then click on show more options and you will be able to see this option which says open with code so just click on this option which is going to open this folder my app in visual studio code otherwise if you don't want

folder and then just give the path here and then and then click on select folder which is going to open the same folder right so once you have opened this same folder which is essentially this folder which we have created you can see this folder name is my app here we can create our php file so i'm going to name my php file as test dot php here okay and then press enter and at this point visual studio code is going to recognize that you want to write some php code and you can see cannot validate since a php initialization could not be found use the settings php path to configure this php

port 80 in my case and by default the local host will run on port 80. if it's running on any other port you need to type colon and then the number of port if it's running on port 8080 then you just need to type the port number here right you can just type localhost colon 80 which essentially mean localhost and then i'm going to press enter here you can see the apache server is running now in order to see your php file what you need to do you need to just open the same folder structure so you need to type the name of your folder which is my app and then test.php right so instead of

result which is hello world and you can see what we have printed hello world right i can also add some more text here and then save this file and then i can just refresh this file and it's going to show me the output right so this is how you can run your php files with visual studio code on your windows 11 operating system now if in case you want to run your php files using command prompt or
