00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on android app development for
00:04 - beginners in this video we will see what
00:07 - is an explicit intent and what is an
00:12 - implicit intent and we will see how we
00:15 - can use explicit and implicit intents in
00:19 - Android so first of all what is an
00:22 - explicit intent and explicit intent is
00:26 - one that you use to launch a specific
00:30 - app component such as a particular
00:33 - activity or service in your app so
00:36 - whenever you want to invoke some
00:38 - activity or some component within your
00:42 - app then you use explicit intent now
00:47 - what is an implicit intent an implicit
00:50 - intent specify an action that can invoke
00:53 - any app on the device able to perform
00:57 - the action so you use implicit intent
01:00 - whenever you want to invoke some app or
01:03 - some activity from other app in your
01:07 - device from your app so explicit you
01:11 - invoke activity or you are able to
01:13 - invoke activity within your app and
01:16 - implicit intent you can invoke an
01:20 - activity or some component of the
01:22 - activity from the other app which is
01:26 - present in your device so let's get
01:30 - started and see how we can use implicit
01:33 - and explicit intent in Android so first
01:36 - of all I will create an app so create a
01:40 - new app and I will name it as app 1 for
01:45 - example ok and everything will be
01:48 - default for now and this will be blank
01:51 - activity and finish so my project is
01:55 - created now and first of all what I'm
01:57 - going to do is I'm going to take a large
01:59 - text and I'm going to take our button
02:02 - here and I want to change the text of
02:05 - this button and the large text so I will
02:08 - go to the text area and in here I'm
02:11 - going to
02:13 - right main activity app1 okay and for
02:19 - the button I'm going to change the
02:22 - button text as open activity one okay so
02:28 - what I'm going to do now is I want to
02:32 - open a new activity from this button
02:36 - click so first of all I will create a
02:38 - new activity so I will right click on my
02:41 - app new activity blank activity and this
02:47 - activity I will name it as activity one
02:51 - app one okay and I will click finish and
02:56 - this is going to create this activity
02:58 - and instead of this hello world I'm
03:02 - going to take a large text and I'm going
03:05 - to change the text of this large text as
03:08 - activity one app one so this is the
03:13 - activity which is present in our app one
03:16 - now in order to open this activity from
03:20 - your main activity what you can do is
03:22 - you can go to this button component here
03:26 - and in here you can add an attribute
03:29 - called Android on click ok and you name
03:35 - a method for example open one and this
03:39 - method we are going to create in our
03:41 - main activity dot Java file so go to
03:44 - main activity dot Java file and in here
03:46 - create a method which will be public
03:49 - void and open one
03:51 - so this smashed method name should be
03:54 - same as this one
03:57 - okay so open one and it will take one
04:01 - argument which is view name it as view
04:04 - itself and inside this method what we
04:07 - want to do is we want to create an
04:09 - instance of intent so in 10 object name
04:14 - will be intent is equal to new intent
04:18 - and it is going to take two argument
04:21 - first is this context and second is
04:26 - activity class name so our activity
04:29 - class name is activity one app one okay
04:34 - dot plus so what it's going to do is
04:37 - it's going to create an intent object
04:39 - which we can call from a method called
04:42 - start activity so start activity and
04:46 - just pass this intent object here and
04:49 - it's going to open your first activity
04:53 - using your main activity so let's run
04:56 - the program so my app is running now and
05:00 - when I click this open activity one it's
05:03 - going to open this activity 1 in app 1
05:08 - and this is an example of explicit
05:12 - intent and what it says that you can
05:16 - open an activity or any component within
05:20 - your app using explicit intent now in
05:25 - order to see the demo for implicit
05:27 - instant we need to create one more app
05:30 - so first of all we will create one more
05:34 - app so go to file new project and this
05:37 - app we are going to call it as app - ok
05:41 - and click Next and click Next and it's
05:46 - going to be blank activity click finish
05:49 - so my second project is created called
05:53 - app to and from this app I want to open
05:58 - the activity from my first app which is
06:01 - app 1 ok so what I'm going to do is I'm
06:05 - going to drag and drop our button and I
06:09 - will change the text of this button as
06:12 - open activity 1 from app 1 ok so we are
06:18 - going to open activity 1 from app 1 so
06:22 - to open activity 1 from app 1 using your
06:26 - app - what you need to do is first of
06:28 - all go to your last project which you
06:31 - have created which was app 1 and go to
06:34 - the manifest file here and in here
06:37 - whenever you create an activity you
06:40 - see here that extra tag is created for
06:44 - your activity now in order to open this
06:49 - activity from your other app which is
06:53 - app - what you need to do is you need to
06:56 - have a intent filter here so you can see
07:02 - there is already one intent filter in
07:04 - our main activity so you can copy this
07:07 - from here and paste inside your activity
07:12 - and inside this intent filter there are
07:15 - two tags one is action and one is
07:17 - category okay and in action Android name
07:21 - you want to give the name of your
07:25 - activity okay so what we are going to do
07:28 - is we are going to go to our activity 1
07:32 - in our app 1 and we are going to go to
07:36 - the XML file of this activity one of add
07:39 - one and we will copy this package name
07:43 - from here ok and why we are doing this
07:46 - we will see in a bit but just paste it
07:50 - here your activity package name and by
07:53 - doing this this activity is visible to
07:57 - all the app within your device now in
08:01 - order to allow other devices to access
08:04 - this activity you need to have this
08:07 - category and this category should be
08:10 - here default ok so there should be
08:13 - default category so now your activity
08:17 - can be seen by other apps within your
08:21 - device ok and now what you can do is you
08:25 - can just remember this package name from
08:29 - here and now what we are going to do is
08:31 - we are going to go to our second app
08:33 - which is app 2 and for this button which
08:37 - we have created an app to we want to
08:40 - open the activity from app 1 okay so I'm
08:45 - going to go to text here and I'm going
08:47 - to add a new attribute which is Android
08:50 - on click and I am going to OH
08:53 - one activity one from app one and now
08:59 - I'm going to copy this method name and
09:02 - I'm going to go to my main activity dot
09:05 - Java file of my activity too and I will
09:09 - create a new method here public void and
09:13 - this method name and then view and
09:17 - inside this method what we can do is we
09:22 - can once again create an object of
09:24 - intent so intent is equal to new intent
09:28 - and this time instead of giving the
09:32 - context and the exact name of your
09:36 - activity what you can do is you can give
09:39 - the package name which we have given
09:43 - here okay so just copy this package name
09:46 - from app one activity 1 and go to app 2
09:51 - and paste it here ok so now this line
09:56 - can recognize your activity 1 from your
10:00 - app 1 and now you can open this activity
10:04 - so start activity using this intent so
10:09 - just pass this here ok so now I am going
10:12 - to run my second app which is app - so
10:16 - my app - is running now and when I click
10:19 - this open one from app 1 it's going to
10:23 - open the activity 1 from app 1 okay so
10:28 - from app - you can see here when I click
10:31 - this button it opens activity 1 from app
10:34 - 1 so this is an example of implicit
10:38 - intent so always remember whenever you
10:42 - want to open an activity or component
10:44 - within the app you use explicit intent
10:49 - and whenever you want to open or access
10:53 - and activity or component from other app
10:57 - within your device you can use implicit
11:00 - intent so I hope you have enjoyed this

hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on android app development for beginners in this video we will see what is an explicit intent and what is an implicit intent and we will see how we can use explicit and implicit intents in Android so first of all what is an explicit intent and explicit intent is one that you use to launch a specific app component such as a particular activity or service in your app so whenever you want to invoke some activity or some component within your app then you use explicit intent now what is an implicit intent an implicit intent specify an action that can invoke any app on the device able to perform the action so you use implicit intent whenever you want to invoke some app or some activity from other app in your device from your app so explicit you invoke activity or you are able to invoke activity within your app and implicit intent you can invoke an activity or some component of the activity from the other app which is present in your device so let's get started and see how we can use implicit and explicit intent in Android so first of all I will create an app so create a new app and I will name it as app 1 for example ok and everything will be default for now and this will be blank activity and finish so my project is created now and first of all what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a large text and I'm going to take our button here and I want to change the text of this button and the large text so I will go to the text area and in here I'm going to right main activity app1 okay and for the button I'm going to change the button text as open activity one okay so what I'm going to do now is I want to open a new activity from this button click so first of all I will create a new activity so I will right click on my app new activity blank activity and this activity I will name it as activity one app one okay and I will click finish and this is going to create this activity and instead of this hello world I'm going to take a large text and I'm going to change the text of this large text as activity one app one so this is the activity which is present in our app one now in order to open this activity from your main activity what you can do is you can go to this button component here and in here you can add an attribute called Android on click ok and you name a method for example open one and this method we are going to create in our main activity dot Java file so go to main activity dot Java file and in here create a method which will be public void and open one so this smashed method name should be same as this one okay so open one and it will take one argument which is view name it as view itself and inside this method what we want to do is we want to create an instance of intent so in 10 object name will be intent is equal to new intent and it is going to take two argument first is this context and second is activity class name so our activity class name is activity one app one okay dot plus so what it's going to do is it's going to create an intent object which we can call from a method called start activity so start activity and just pass this intent object here and it's going to open your first activity using your main activity so let's run the program so my app is running now and when I click this open activity one it's going to open this activity 1 in app 1 and this is an example of explicit intent and what it says that you can open an activity or any component within your app using explicit intent now in order to see the demo for implicit instant we need to create one more app so first of all we will create one more app so go to file new project and this app we are going to call it as app ok and click Next and click Next and it's going to be blank activity click finish so my second project is created called app to and from this app I want to open the activity from my first app which is app 1 ok so what I'm going to do is I'm going to drag and drop our button and I will change the text of this button as open activity 1 from app 1 ok so we are going to open activity 1 from app 1 so to open activity 1 from app 1 using your app what you need to do is first of all go to your last project which you have created which was app 1 and go to the manifest file here and in here whenever you create an activity you see here that extra tag is created for your activity now in order to open this activity from your other app which is app what you need to do is you need to have a intent filter here so you can see there is already one intent filter in our main activity so you can copy this from here and paste inside your activity and inside this intent filter there are two tags one is action and one is category okay and in action Android name you want to give the name of your activity okay so what we are going to do is we are going to go to our activity 1 in our app 1 and we are going to go to the XML file of this activity one of add one and we will copy this package name from here ok and why we are doing this we will see in a bit but just paste it here your activity package name and by doing this this activity is visible to all the app within your device now in order to allow other devices to access this activity you need to have this category and this category should be here default ok so there should be default category so now your activity can be seen by other apps within your device ok and now what you can do is you can just remember this package name from here and now what we are going to do is we are going to go to our second app which is app 2 and for this button which we have created an app to we want to open the activity from app 1 okay so I'm going to go to text here and I'm going to add a new attribute which is Android on click and I am going to OH one activity one from app one and now I'm going to copy this method name and I'm going to go to my main activity dot Java file of my activity too and I will create a new method here public void and this method name and then view and inside this method what we can do is we can once again create an object of intent so intent is equal to new intent and this time instead of giving the context and the exact name of your activity what you can do is you can give the package name which we have given here okay so just copy this package name from app one activity 1 and go to app 2 and paste it here ok so now this line can recognize your activity 1 from your app 1 and now you can open this activity so start activity using this intent so just pass this here ok so now I am going to run my second app which is app so my app is running now and when I click this open one from app 1 it's going to open the activity 1 from app 1 okay so from app you can see here when I click this button it opens activity 1 from app 1 so this is an example of implicit intent so always remember whenever you want to open an activity or component within the app you use explicit intent and whenever you want to open or access and activity or component from other app within your device you can use implicit intent so I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
