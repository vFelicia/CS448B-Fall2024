00:00 - so guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how we can use five command in Linux
00:05 - now first of all what is fine command
00:08 - fine command is used to search for files
00:12 - in a directory hierarchy so for example
00:15 - I'm in my home folder I can just use PWD
00:19 - command to know this and in this folder
00:22 - I will just use LS to list all the files
00:26 - and other things here right and for
00:30 - example I want to find some file here
00:33 - which I have made few days ago which I
00:37 - don't know in which folder is it right
00:40 - right now I know that this file is here
00:43 - but for example I don't know the file
00:46 - location and I just know that it's in
00:49 - the home folder of my you know operating
00:54 - system so I can use find for this so
00:57 - just use find and then the directory in
01:01 - which you want to find right so it can
01:04 - be a root directory it can be a TC
01:08 - directory or any other directory in
01:11 - which you want to search this file in so
01:14 - right now I want to find this file in my
01:17 - home folder right and then comes the
01:21 - file name so you give the flag name here
01:26 - and then you give the file name which
01:28 - you want to search you can do something
01:31 - like this test dot sh for example I want
01:34 - to find this file name or you can do the
01:39 - wild-card with these fine names so first
01:43 - of all let's you know get the full name
01:46 - of the file and press Enter it's going
01:49 - to search in all the directories and all
01:53 - the files in this home directory and
01:56 - then it's going to search where is this
01:59 - file located and it has searched and I
02:02 - can see the location of this file in a
02:05 - second example you can use for example
02:08 - you just know that this file is called
02:11 - test but you don't know the extension
02:13 - wit so you can use dot Asterix as a
02:17 - wildcard and this means that whatever
02:20 - comes after test dot then it will it is
02:25 - going to search for all those files
02:27 - right so I'm going to press ENTER and it
02:30 - searched this file again right for
02:33 - example you just want to search for dot
02:37 - txt extension the files which have txt
02:40 - extension so you can just give this
02:44 - Astrix dot txt and press ENTER and you
02:49 - see we have seen bunch of you know
02:53 - result which have txt extension right
02:57 - you can see this dot txt list or PSD txt
03:02 - so every is the result which have txt
03:05 - extension is going to be you know listed
03:08 - here now for example I want to search
03:11 - for this particular file file1 dot txt
03:15 - so I can do something like this I just
03:18 - want to you know right here file and one
03:23 - and I just want to you know just write s
03:27 - trick here this means that whatever file
03:30 - name which will start from file one is
03:32 - going to be searched and listed in our
03:34 - result so press ENTER and you can see
03:38 - all these result have the file name file
03:43 - one okay so there is a directory also
03:47 - called file one there are you know files
03:50 - also in different directories with the
03:53 - same name so in this way you can search
03:56 - for the file in your whatever directory
04:00 - in which you want to search so for
04:03 - example I will clear the terminal for
04:05 - now and let's find some more things so
04:09 - for example I want to find in the root
04:13 - directory so this is going to start from
04:16 - the root and it's going to search the
04:18 - file everywhere else and then I'm going
04:22 - to give the name of the file so I will
04:25 - use this flag
04:26 - name and then I will give the name of
04:29 - the file so in the last video we were
04:33 - you know talking about the message files
04:36 - so I can give the name of this file here
04:39 - and then I can just press ENTER and it's
04:43 - going to search for this file but there
04:45 - is a problem here right and you may
04:48 - recognize by this permission denied
04:50 - warning that it cannot search for this
04:54 - file because there are some directory
04:57 - which we don't have access to so we can
05:00 - use this command with the sudo in front
05:05 - of it so I'm going to clear the terminal
05:06 - once again and I'm going to just write
05:09 - sudo in front of this fine come on and
05:12 - then press ENTER and give my password
05:15 - and then it's going to search for this
05:17 - file so you can see this file is in
05:20 - sidebar or slash log and the file name
05:23 - but there are some other directory in
05:27 - which this file is also existing for
05:29 - example in bin folder also and then this
05:33 - folder location also and in this field
05:36 - folder location also okay so this is how
05:39 - you can use this find command but there
05:42 - are more things you can do with this
05:44 - fine command so for example you have
05:47 - created a file and you just know that
05:51 - you have created this file a few days
05:53 - ago but you don't know the name of the
05:56 - file and you don't even know the
05:59 - location of the file so you can use this
06:01 - command called fine
06:03 - and then you can use the location so
06:08 - just give the location in which you want
06:10 - to search in and then give this flag
06:13 - called - M time and then whatever you
06:18 - write after this for example minus 1 is
06:22 - going to look the files which are
06:25 - created one day ago till now ok so this
06:30 - can be minus 2 for 2 days - 3 for 3 days
06:34 - and this can be plus also so you can you
06:39 - know know that
06:41 - from this time this will be created or
06:44 - something like this way it can be a plus
06:46 - or you exactly know that this file is
06:49 - created exactly one day ago so you can
06:52 - give the one here instead of minus one
06:56 - okay so just give minus one and press
07:00 - ENTER and it's showing all these you
07:05 - know result to us so this is how also
07:07 - you can use this fine command so I hope

Cleaned transcript:

so guys in this video I'm going to show you how we can use five command in Linux now first of all what is fine command fine command is used to search for files in a directory hierarchy so for example I'm in my home folder I can just use PWD command to know this and in this folder I will just use LS to list all the files and other things here right and for example I want to find some file here which I have made few days ago which I don't know in which folder is it right right now I know that this file is here but for example I don't know the file location and I just know that it's in the home folder of my you know operating system so I can use find for this so just use find and then the directory in which you want to find right so it can be a root directory it can be a TC directory or any other directory in which you want to search this file in so right now I want to find this file in my home folder right and then comes the file name so you give the flag name here and then you give the file name which you want to search you can do something like this test dot sh for example I want to find this file name or you can do the wildcard with these fine names so first of all let's you know get the full name of the file and press Enter it's going to search in all the directories and all the files in this home directory and then it's going to search where is this file located and it has searched and I can see the location of this file in a second example you can use for example you just know that this file is called test but you don't know the extension wit so you can use dot Asterix as a wildcard and this means that whatever comes after test dot then it will it is going to search for all those files right so I'm going to press ENTER and it searched this file again right for example you just want to search for dot txt extension the files which have txt extension so you can just give this Astrix dot txt and press ENTER and you see we have seen bunch of you know result which have txt extension right you can see this dot txt list or PSD txt so every is the result which have txt extension is going to be you know listed here now for example I want to search for this particular file file1 dot txt so I can do something like this I just want to you know right here file and one and I just want to you know just write s trick here this means that whatever file name which will start from file one is going to be searched and listed in our result so press ENTER and you can see all these result have the file name file one okay so there is a directory also called file one there are you know files also in different directories with the same name so in this way you can search for the file in your whatever directory in which you want to search so for example I will clear the terminal for now and let's find some more things so for example I want to find in the root directory so this is going to start from the root and it's going to search the file everywhere else and then I'm going to give the name of the file so I will use this flag name and then I will give the name of the file so in the last video we were you know talking about the message files so I can give the name of this file here and then I can just press ENTER and it's going to search for this file but there is a problem here right and you may recognize by this permission denied warning that it cannot search for this file because there are some directory which we don't have access to so we can use this command with the sudo in front of it so I'm going to clear the terminal once again and I'm going to just write sudo in front of this fine come on and then press ENTER and give my password and then it's going to search for this file so you can see this file is in sidebar or slash log and the file name but there are some other directory in which this file is also existing for example in bin folder also and then this folder location also and in this field folder location also okay so this is how you can use this find command but there are more things you can do with this fine command so for example you have created a file and you just know that you have created this file a few days ago but you don't know the name of the file and you don't even know the location of the file so you can use this command called fine and then you can use the location so just give the location in which you want to search in and then give this flag called M time and then whatever you write after this for example minus 1 is going to look the files which are created one day ago till now ok so this can be minus 2 for 2 days 3 for 3 days and this can be plus also so you can you know know that from this time this will be created or something like this way it can be a plus or you exactly know that this file is created exactly one day ago so you can give the one here instead of minus one okay so just give minus one and press ENTER and it's showing all these you know result to us so this is how also you can use this fine command so I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
