00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Java programming for
00:04 - beginners in the last video we have seen
00:07 - how to use math operators in Java and
00:12 - how to uh you know do simple arithmetic
00:15 - operations in Java now in this video we
00:18 - will learn about increment
00:22 - operators and we will learn about what
00:24 - is uh post increment and pre-increment
00:29 - operations
00:30 - and we will also learn about assignment
00:33 - operators and how to use this assignment
00:37 - operator
00:38 - effectively so for
00:40 - example I
00:42 - have a variable X for now which is equal
00:47 - to 10 okay now I want to increment the
00:52 - value of x by 1 the simplest way of uh
00:56 - doing this is X is equal to
01:00 - x +
01:03 - 1 and this will increment the value of x
01:06 - by one right so let's uh compile the
01:09 - program and run the program once again
01:12 - and the value of x is incremented by one
01:15 - which is and the answer is 11 here right
01:18 - now the there is other ways of doing
01:23 - this and the other way of doing this is
01:27 - just like this so you can do X X and
01:30 - then two plus signs and this will
01:34 - increment the value of x by
01:37 - one so let's try to run the
01:41 - program and in answer you can see that
01:46 - the answer is still 11 so this operation
01:49 - when you add two plus
01:52 - uh symbols before your variable it will
01:56 - increment the value of the variable y1
02:00 - but there is uh something called
02:04 - pre-increment operators which is um
02:08 - which I'm going to show you this kind of
02:11 - um
02:13 - incrementation of the variable is called
02:15 - post increment operation so for example
02:20 - when I do something like
02:22 - this when I just want to print x++ in
02:27 - print line see what's the answer
02:31 - the answer is
02:32 - 10 this is
02:35 - because in the post increment operation
02:39 - once uh the value of x will be changed
02:44 - only after this plus plus operation okay
02:48 - so this Plus+ operation will increment
02:52 - the value of x in the next usage of X
02:57 - okay so for example I just
03:00 - uh print the value of x here the value
03:04 - of x will be incremented by one now okay
03:08 - so the first value of 10 is 10 which is
03:12 - same as the value but we have added to
03:15 - this plus uh two plus symbols here then
03:19 - the value will be shown here so this is
03:22 - called the pro post increment operation
03:26 - right in which the value of x will will
03:29 - be increment in the after you perform
03:34 - this uh Plus+ operation right but there
03:38 - is something called pre-
03:40 - incrementation and this you can do it
03:43 - like this Plus+ X and what this will do
03:47 - is it will increase the value of x by
03:51 - one first so in this operation itself it
03:54 - will increase the value of x and this
03:57 - will just show the same result so let's
04:01 - compile the program and this time we get
04:04 - 1111 which is uh true because this is
04:09 - called pre-increment operator so first
04:13 - it will increment your value and then
04:16 - give the result and this kind of
04:20 - operation where we have written
04:22 - x++ this will
04:25 - first print your value and then
04:28 - increment uh uh your value after Plus+
04:33 - operation okay so this is called pre-
04:37 - incrementation and this is called post
04:40 - increment operation okay now for
04:45 - example I want to do something like this
04:50 - so I want to add five to this value
04:54 - right so you can do it X is equal to X
05:00 - + 5 but this is kind of lengthy right
05:05 - because you uh need to write X is equal
05:08 - to and you need to use x two times and
05:11 - there is a simple way of doing this by
05:14 - just writing X so just writing x + is
05:20 - equal
05:21 - to 5 okay and what this operation does
05:26 - is basically the same operation what
05:29 - what uh this operation do X is equal to
05:33 - x + 5 okay and let's see the
05:39 - answer so the answer is 15 right but the
05:43 - short form of this operation you can do
05:46 - it like this okay in the similar way if
05:50 - you want to multiply five in to this uh
05:55 - value you just need to do X ASX which is
05:59 - a multiplication operator and this is
06:02 - basically equal to this operation right
06:06 - so run the
06:07 - [Music]
06:08 - program and it's 50 as an answer so
06:13 - equal to in Java is called assignment
06:16 - operator and we have simplified the
06:19 - process of assignment operation uh by
06:23 - you know optimizing our code okay so in
06:28 - a similar way when you're you want to
06:31 - divide 10 by 5 you can do it like this
06:36 - and the answer is two which is true and
06:39 - this is simply means this operation and
06:43 - if you want to subtract these values you
06:45 - just do minus equals and this will
06:50 - perform simply the substraction okay so
06:55 - in this way you can use increment
06:57 - operation in Java
07:00 - and you can effectively use assignment
07:03 - operation in Java so I hope you have

hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Java programming for beginners in the last video we have seen how to use math operators in Java and how to uh you know do simple arithmetic operations in Java now in this video we will learn about increment operators and we will learn about what is uh post increment and preincrement operations and we will also learn about assignment operators and how to use this assignment operator effectively so for example I have a variable X for now which is equal to 10 okay now I want to increment the value of x by 1 the simplest way of uh doing this is X is equal to x + 1 and this will increment the value of x by one right so let's uh compile the program and run the program once again and the value of x is incremented by one which is and the answer is 11 here right now the there is other ways of doing this and the other way of doing this is just like this so you can do X X and then two plus signs and this will increment the value of x by one so let's try to run the program and in answer you can see that the answer is still 11 so this operation when you add two plus uh symbols before your variable it will increment the value of the variable y1 but there is uh something called preincrement operators which is um which I'm going to show you this kind of um incrementation of the variable is called post increment operation so for example when I do something like this when I just want to print x++ in print line see what's the answer the answer is 10 this is because in the post increment operation once uh the value of x will be changed only after this plus plus operation okay so this Plus+ operation will increment the value of x in the next usage of X okay so for example I just uh print the value of x here the value of x will be incremented by one now okay so the first value of 10 is 10 which is same as the value but we have added to this plus uh two plus symbols here then the value will be shown here so this is called the pro post increment operation right in which the value of x will will be increment in the after you perform this uh Plus+ operation right but there is something called pre incrementation and this you can do it like this Plus+ X and what this will do is it will increase the value of x by one first so in this operation itself it will increase the value of x and this will just show the same result so let's compile the program and this time we get 1111 which is uh true because this is called preincrement operator so first it will increment your value and then give the result and this kind of operation where we have written x++ this will first print your value and then increment uh uh your value after Plus+ operation okay so this is called pre incrementation and this is called post increment operation okay now for example I want to do something like this so I want to add five to this value right so you can do it X is equal to X + 5 but this is kind of lengthy right because you uh need to write X is equal to and you need to use x two times and there is a simple way of doing this by just writing X so just writing x + is equal to 5 okay and what this operation does is basically the same operation what what uh this operation do X is equal to x + 5 okay and let's see the answer so the answer is 15 right but the short form of this operation you can do it like this okay in the similar way if you want to multiply five in to this uh value you just need to do X ASX which is a multiplication operator and this is basically equal to this operation right so run the program and it's 50 as an answer so equal to in Java is called assignment operator and we have simplified the process of assignment operation uh by you know optimizing our code okay so in a similar way when you're you want to divide 10 by 5 you can do it like this and the answer is two which is true and this is simply means this operation and if you want to subtract these values you just do minus equals and this will perform simply the substraction okay so in this way you can use increment operation in Java and you can effectively use assignment operation in Java so I hope you have enjoyed this video please wait comment and subscribe and bye for watch
