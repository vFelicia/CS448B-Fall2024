00:00 - some prefer common knowledge in this
00:02 - video we will see how we can delete data
00:05 - from the table in PostgreSQL once you
00:10 - have inserted the data into your table
00:12 - there will be time when you need to
00:15 - believe those data from this table the
00:19 - reason can be you don't need that data
00:22 - anymore or you wanted to make some space
00:25 - on your server etc etc so before going
00:30 - into execution let us first see what is
00:33 - the syntax for that so let me just show
00:41 - you this Intex so the syntax is delete
00:48 - because we want to delete data from the
00:51 - table then we have to specify the name
00:55 - of the table from which we want to
00:57 - delete the data delete from then you can
01:03 - provide table name then we're here
01:10 - after that you can provide your
01:12 - condition column name is equal to value
01:24 - so this is the syntax for deleting rows
01:29 - from the table the Delete key bar then
01:34 - specify the name of the table and after
01:36 - that you can give the condition so all
01:41 - the rows which matches with this
01:43 - condition will be deleted let us see an
01:48 - example open your terminal right psql
01:59 - now let us see the charts a database is
02:02 - present in our system for that right
02:05 - excellent and as you can see we have
02:09 - various databases here
02:12 - among them we are going to use this base
02:15 - database so for connecting to the test
02:20 - database please write backs let's see
02:23 - for connect in the name of the data now
02:28 - we are connected to test details now let
02:32 - us see which are the tables present in
02:34 - test database for that right backslash T
02:39 - as you can see we have employee table
02:43 - and strode on table so let us see this
02:48 - structure of this turntable so
02:52 - excellently and name of the table so
02:57 - just one temple have two columns roll
03:00 - number and name and roll number is the
03:05 - primary key for this product ever let us
03:09 - see the data present in front of us
03:18 - name with a table we have ten rows and
03:24 - these duralumon and the name so let us
03:31 - assume that I want to delete the row
03:36 - where product have the name DJ okay I
03:40 - want to delete these rows from the table
03:50 - then provide the name of the table from
03:53 - which you want to delete the data so in
03:56 - this is the name will be used to run and
04:01 - condition where name is equal to reject
04:10 - okay delete the name of the table and
04:16 - there is a condition which believe this
04:23 - press Enter
04:25 - beneath but this number indicate how
04:28 - many rows was deleted one row has been
04:33 - deleted so we can see still a
04:48 - you can see these row is no longer part
04:52 - of this student table so this is how we
04:56 - can visit data from your table now we
04:59 - can also delete multiple rows from the
05:03 - table if the condition B specifies
05:06 - matches with multiple rows and multiple
05:09 - rows will be deleted this time we are
05:11 - going to use employee table so let us
05:15 - first see the data of the employee so it
05:22 - has only three rows bridge a net and
05:26 - gross and two columns employee ID and
05:28 - I'm pregnant now I want to delete the
05:32 - employee whose employee ID is 1 to 4 and
05:39 - employee name is the well - Bridget okay
05:44 - so the from any we are specifying the
05:52 - name of the table where condition ID is
06:02 - equal to 1 to 4 or if you notice this I
06:10 - am using or here because if I use end
06:12 - operator then there is no row said
06:17 - satisfy the condition because 1 2 4 has
06:21 - the employee named Bruce and my name
06:24 - written has simply ready 1 2 3
06:26 - so I'll specify all operate area and we
06:30 - name is equal to bridge a then Toro will
06:36 - be deleted here you can see so let us
06:40 - first see data and you can see so just
06:48 - close the terminal and open PG 8 me here
06:55 - data policies we have test database
06:58 - public tables okay let us first see the
07:08 - data from the employee it has only one
07:21 - row so what I'm trying to say if you do
07:27 - not specify any condition while deleting
07:31 - rows like this delete from that's it you
07:42 - do not specify any condition here then
07:45 - all the rows will be deleted it means
07:47 - all the data which you are stored in
07:50 - your table will be deleted so be careful
07:53 - while you're writing this way I am
07:55 - showing you
07:58 - since of our table has only one row and
08:01 - row is deleted you can see select
08:10 - employee table is empty now so this is
08:18 - how you can delete single rows multiple
08:21 - rows with the lipstick left thanks for
08:25 - watching
