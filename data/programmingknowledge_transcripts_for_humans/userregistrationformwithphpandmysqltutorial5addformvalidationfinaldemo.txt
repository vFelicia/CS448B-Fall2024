00:00 - what's going on guys welcome back to
00:01 - knowledge and this is the last video on
00:05 - a five-part video series and how to
00:08 - create user registration form in PHP so
00:11 - in the previous tutorial we have already
00:12 - implemented the jQuery and sweet alert
00:15 - to our project so this time we will
00:19 - continue working on with the jQuery so
00:22 - that it will post our data to the
00:24 - database or to a file and then the file
00:28 - will be processing our information
00:31 - processing the form data and insert it
00:33 - to the database so we have here the
00:39 - preventdefault that we have in the
00:42 - previous tutorial so after this line we
00:46 - need to define the Ajax request
00:48 - okay so Ajax requests and curly braces
00:56 - inside and semicolon at the end of this
01:01 - line the next step is to define few
01:04 - things here so the first one is type so
01:10 - the type of this request is post and for
01:17 - the URL we need to define process the
01:20 - PHP so we'll be creating this file later
01:23 - on process the PHP and then data so the
01:29 - data should be all the information or
01:31 - all the variables that we have defined
01:34 - here
01:36 - so or better yet we could change this or
01:48 - import or place this inside the
01:54 - tradition valid and then the data should
01:58 - be this dead as follows first name then
02:02 - supply the first name and let's just
02:05 - copy and paste this line 3 4 and 5 plus
02:10 - comma and
02:12 - name and email email email and phone
02:20 - number phone number and of course the
02:26 - password and let's define another option
02:32 - which is the success so this success is
02:41 - a function that has to eat a parameter
02:46 - okay and let's just copy this one for
02:53 - something if we encounter errors later
03:00 - on in the same thing function in it has
03:05 - theta parameter so we need to copy or
03:13 - sweet alert up to display something here
03:20 - so title should be successful successful
03:28 - and the text here sir register for
03:38 - successfully registered right and we
03:46 - could copy and paste this one or our
03:48 - error function so Ivor's and there were
03:56 - errors while saving the state ID and
04:03 - type should be error of course okay so
04:09 - we have the first name last name email
04:13 - phone number password in the password
04:18 - value okay let's just remove this
04:26 - this line okay so the next step is to
04:30 - create the process that page we find so
04:33 - let's define a new file process that PHP
04:39 - and inside this process that PHP let's
04:43 - just echo something for now hello hello
04:46 - [Music]
04:48 - from process
04:53 - so we'll know if the process that page P
04:56 - is working or the Ajax requests that
05:00 - were working on is working so save your
05:03 - file for processing at PHP file go back
05:06 - to our browser and refresh our page and
05:11 - let's try to input something here okay
05:17 - first name last name email address phone
05:19 - number and then sign up successfully
05:24 - registered it says successfully
05:26 - registered okay let's change the text
05:31 - instead of successfully registered it
05:34 - should be the data coming from the
05:36 - process of HP save your file
05:39 - registration dot PHP and go back to the
05:43 - registration tab page create a page
05:46 - registration that PHP page and refresh
05:51 - input random email a phone number
06:00 - password and then sign up hello hello
06:04 - from process as you can see so we can
06:08 - say that the process that PHP and the
06:11 - jQuery AJAX request is working Chris oh
06:15 - the next step is to fully modify our
06:19 - process that PHP so let's just copy the
06:24 - code that we have here earlier okay and
06:32 - paste that into this process at PHP and
06:38 - instead of checking if the post-trade is
06:44 - set but we need this just to check if
06:52 - the post is set I mean the post variable
06:57 - is set so that is set then we could get
07:02 - all the values coming from the
07:06 - request so first name of course last
07:10 - name email email phone number in
07:12 - password okay
07:14 - and of course if there's no request
07:20 - let's just echo no data and then we have
07:32 - here the insert for our database right
07:37 - but we don't have the connection for our
07:41 - database so let's just copy the config
07:46 - require once line in paste it here in
07:50 - our process that PHP file so we now have
07:53 - the config
07:54 - all the configurations defined in config
07:57 - that PHP will be included here in our
08:00 - process at HP v so we have here all the
08:03 - values first name last name email phone
08:05 - number in the password so for the
08:09 - password let's make it a little secure
08:11 - by using the sha-1 encryption so to
08:20 - encrypt our password instead of a plain
08:24 - text password the password will be save
08:27 - us some random characters so it will be
08:32 - less readable if someone got the access
08:35 - to our database so let's save the
08:39 - process that PHP file and of course also
08:43 - this registration dot PHP and go back to
08:46 - your browser and refresh our page ok
08:50 - let's try our let's try it first to sign
08:55 - up or click design a button without
08:57 - filling in before okay so as you can see
09:02 - the request will not be processed
09:05 - because there's a validation and if you
09:09 - try to type in values here say for
09:12 - example Django channel and
09:16 - email s John Doe at gmail.com number any
09:25 - random number or no and password any
09:29 - random password and click on the sign up
09:32 - button and it says successfully saved
09:36 - then let's check our PHP myadmin
09:40 - if the information that we have
09:44 - submitted
09:44 - s-save into our database
09:47 - so total homes indian page we may have
09:52 - me
09:53 - enter your password or username and
09:55 - password go and then user accounts
10:06 - browse seeing user accounts we can see
10:11 - all the informations that we have
10:13 - submitted so first name last name email
10:16 - and of course the password that is
10:20 - hushed by sha-1 encryption ok so I think
10:27 - that's all there is to rate on how to
10:29 - create user registration form in PHP I
10:32 - hope you learned something in this
10:34 - tutorial thanks
10:44 - you

what's going on guys welcome back to knowledge and this is the last video on a fivepart video series and how to create user registration form in PHP so in the previous tutorial we have already implemented the jQuery and sweet alert to our project so this time we will continue working on with the jQuery so that it will post our data to the database or to a file and then the file will be
