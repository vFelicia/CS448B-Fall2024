00:00 - hello everyone welcome to programming
00:02 - knowledge
00:03 - in today's tutorial we are going to
00:04 - learn about django with
00:06 - so basically in today's tutorial we are
00:08 - going to connect the django
00:10 - with mongodb and i will illustrate all
00:13 - the process how you can
00:15 - create a mongodb database and how you
00:17 - can connect that mongodb database with
00:19 - your django application
00:21 - so let's get started with today's
00:22 - tutorial the first thing we need to do
00:25 - we can open our code editor and then
00:28 - we need to type the command pip install
00:34 - django so this will install the django
00:36 - on our local machine
00:38 - and with this command we can create a
00:40 - django project as well as django app on
00:42 - our machine
00:43 - then then i would like to tell you that
00:46 - till the time this is being installed on
00:48 - my machine what you can do
00:50 - yeah here you can see that it is
00:52 - installed in django on my machine
00:55 - and you can install django with this
00:57 - simple command pip install django
00:59 - and then we have a mongodb plus i will
01:02 - show you how the we can go here you can
01:04 - refer to this website
01:05 - uh first this is the website for django
01:08 - i have already told you how you can
01:09 - install django
01:11 - then this is the website from here you
01:12 - can install the mongodb community
01:14 - edition and this works as a interface
01:17 - with you
01:18 - uh with the mongodb database as a user
01:20 - interface
01:21 - uh very similar to phpmyadmin
01:26 - which is used for sql then this is the
01:28 - package we are going to use
01:30 - this package has a very similar name
01:32 - jungle
01:33 - the word jungle is derived from uh like
01:35 - uh this is used to connect django with
01:37 - mongodb
01:39 - so jungle is the package we are going to
01:41 - use so let's get back to our code editor
01:43 - so first what you can do you can
01:47 - connect you to the uh connect to the
01:50 - local host server
01:51 - using this mongodb compass community
01:53 - edition
01:54 - and you can click on the connect button
01:56 - then this would connect to the local
01:58 - host
01:59 - now here you can see that it has been
02:00 - connected to the local host
02:02 - now what you can do you can create your
02:05 - own database
02:06 - so let's click on here uh so first
02:10 - let's continue with installation part so
02:12 - after installing
02:13 - uh after installing django you can
02:15 - install
02:16 - it install
02:19 - jungle so this is the command we are
02:22 - going to use
02:23 - to connect with the package this is the
02:25 - package we are going to use to connect
02:26 - django with the mongodb database
02:28 - so it's very easy so till the time it's
02:32 - being installed
02:33 - yeah it's a very easy process and next
02:36 - what we can do then we can create a
02:38 - django project
02:40 - and then we would i will show you how
02:42 - you can make a migration in your app
02:44 - then how the how when you can change see
02:47 - the changes detected in the
02:48 - mongodb database so let's what we
02:52 - what we can do uh next uh what i have
02:55 - so then you have to make some changes in
02:57 - your settings dot py file
02:59 - i'll also come to that then you can see
03:02 - the changes on the mongodb com compass
03:04 - so that's very easy so let's create a
03:07 - django project
03:08 - so i'll type django admin
03:11 - start project
03:15 - a demo project
03:18 - so i'll create a project
03:21 - then what you can do you can open a
03:24 - folder
03:26 - and i've created this project on my
03:28 - desktop
03:29 - so here i can open it so
03:32 - now the project is open on my vs code so
03:36 - next thing you can do
03:38 - you will i'll navigate you to the
03:40 - settings dot py file
03:41 - so you can press ctrl dot p and
03:44 - if setting dot ui file so this would
03:47 - simply
03:48 - uh direct you to the settings.py file
03:50 - and here
03:51 - you can see that there is a section for
03:53 - databases
03:55 - so we would be doing this and i will
03:57 - open my terminal as well
03:59 - so we would be connecting this uh so
04:02 - what we can do
04:03 - uh first since we have installed jungle
04:06 - now what we can do first we'll create a
04:09 - database i will show you
04:10 - like from here you can disconnect and
04:13 - connect
04:14 - so i'll show you again very first you
04:16 - disconnect
04:17 - then you can click on connect so this
04:18 - would connect you to the localhost
04:20 - database
04:21 - and now click on create database and
04:24 - type
04:25 - demo database
04:28 - remove database and you can give a
04:30 - collection name
04:32 - a demo collection
04:35 - so i would click on create database
04:39 - so here you can just copy the you can
04:41 - keep this as a referral demo database
04:44 - so and demo collection so i click on
04:47 - create database
04:48 - so here you can see a database has been
04:50 - created and
04:51 - which is having just a demo collection
04:53 - right now
04:54 - but what we can do uh we will
04:58 - connect to our uh our project and then
05:00 - run the app
05:01 - so i'll sorry run the migration so what
05:03 - you can do you can simply copy this
05:06 - and you can paste this code i'll comment
05:09 - this out databases
05:10 - so i'll put triple quotes here so this
05:13 - would basically come in this section
05:16 - double quotes and now i would miss this
05:19 - you can do one thing you can remove this
05:22 - client part because you are
05:23 - right now dealing with the local host
05:25 - and by default it would detect this
05:27 - so now you need to define your database
05:30 - name
05:31 - so i would define my database oh sorry
05:35 - so my database name is this this is my
05:38 - database demo database so i'll
05:41 - move to this here and i'll type demo
05:44 - data base
05:48 - okay so this looks perfect now uh since
05:51 - i'm
05:52 - my connection is on so i'll type
05:55 - a python manage
06:00 - dot ui make
06:04 - migrations
06:07 - and this would make the migrations in my
06:10 - uh
06:10 - database so so it says no change is
06:14 - detected
06:15 - so now i can type python manage dot py
06:19 - migrate so here you can see the all the
06:23 - migrations uh are being applied so here
06:27 - you can see the migrations has been
06:28 - applied
06:29 - now i will move to my database and i'll
06:31 - click on the refresh button
06:33 - and here you can see and i click on the
06:35 - demo database perfect
06:36 - so i have got all the migrations of the
06:38 - django here
06:40 - in my mongodb database so
06:43 - this looks perfectly fine so you can
06:47 - create your models and then run the
06:49 - previous two command that is migrate and
06:51 - migrations
06:52 - and then you are get to go with this
06:54 - project running
06:55 - so thank you guys for watching this
06:58 - video so i'll catch up in the next
06:59 - tutorial
07:00 - so here you can see i have made the
07:02 - project uh you can also do one thing
07:05 - you can type python manage
07:08 - dot ui run
07:12 - server so this would run the app on your
07:16 - local machine
07:17 - so you can simply copy this
07:21 - and you can place this on your browser
07:28 - and here you can see your django project
07:30 - is perfectly running so everything looks
07:31 - perfect
07:32 - so this is how i made the settings in my
07:34 - database uh this is
07:36 - the mongodb collections what i've got
07:38 - and
07:39 - this the project is already running so
