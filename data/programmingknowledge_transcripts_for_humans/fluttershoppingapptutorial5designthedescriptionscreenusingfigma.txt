00:00 - so in this video we are going to
00:02 - continue designing our ecommerce
00:04 - application
00:05 - so i'll open figma
00:32 - okay so once it is fired up we will
00:34 - continue
00:35 - so in this video we are going to make
00:38 - the details
00:39 - screen means if we click on any of the
00:41 - items over here or on
00:43 - these items we should be able to see our
00:46 - description page
00:47 - okay so let's start we know how to copy
00:51 - we click on shift option and then drag
00:53 - and we get a new one okay
00:56 - now i i don't need these things
01:01 - okay so i'll select them all and remove
01:04 - them
01:05 - i will keep the bottom navigation bar
01:08 - because that is how i plan to proceed
01:11 - so let's change its color
01:14 - okay i'm gonna give this color so you
01:17 - will see that in the entire project i'm
01:19 - gonna use
01:20 - only this palette okay because it will
01:23 - provide
01:23 - more uniformity to uh to our application
01:27 - okay so now i need to have a back icon
01:30 - over here so for that i'll open our
01:33 - material outlines
01:35 - okay i'll add a link to this as well in
01:37 - the description
01:40 - okay so once it is opened if you go in
01:42 - the navigation
01:43 - section you can see all the icons so
01:46 - i'll select
01:47 - this one then command c to copy if you
01:50 - are on windows then ctrl c
01:53 - and then simply i'll paste it over here
01:55 - now in
01:57 - that everything is inside a frame means
02:00 - by frame i refer to this purple boundary
02:02 - that it has
02:03 - if you double click on it it will go
02:05 - inside the frame and select the actual
02:07 - item
02:08 - i'll remove it away from the frame okay
02:11 - and then finally i'll delete this frame
02:14 - okay now i want this to be white in
02:18 - color so
02:19 - here it is now i want it over here
02:24 - okay nice
02:27 - so next i want the item that is clipped
02:31 - to be displayed here means the name okay
02:34 - so i'll
02:35 - create a new text view or you can you
02:39 - see how
02:39 - convenient this is to copy from a
02:42 - previous one
02:43 - okay now i'll change its color to white
02:46 - and then this will be broccoli
02:51 - okay now this should be in the
02:54 - center so i'll bring it over here
02:57 - now to make it in the center i'll simply
02:59 - click on this and it will
03:01 - be in the center now i just need to
03:03 - match these two so i'll
03:05 - shift it a little bit upwards and then
03:08 - these two are on the same line now okay
03:11 - so now let's proceed i'll add a square
03:13 - over here
03:15 - now if you don't uh there are two
03:17 - options to create a square
03:19 - i'll click on this and then drag and
03:22 - create a square
03:23 - simple or i can simply click
03:26 - and get the square and then edit it
03:30 - to the desired shape i want okay so i
03:34 - try i did the second one i wanted till
03:38 - here
03:38 - i'm sorry it should it should touch the
03:41 - bottom navigation bar
03:43 - okay and at top it should be
03:46 - till here
03:49 - okay this seems fine now i'll add a
03:51 - border to it only on the top
03:54 - so you know we can add a
03:57 - individual border radius so for this
04:00 - corner i'll again make it 15
04:02 - and for this corner as well i'll make it
04:04 - 15. i want
04:06 - it to have a white color i'll do that
04:10 - okay and with this we are ready now
04:12 - let's see how it looks
04:14 - i'll start the preview
04:29 - okay so this is the first screen only
04:32 - now let's uh navigate from here to
04:36 - this screen from the screen to this
04:38 - screen which in designers term is called
04:40 - prototyping
04:41 - okay so over here this is design and
04:43 - then you have the prototype
04:45 - section okay now what you need to do is
04:48 - you simply need to go and
04:49 - select this the circle not
04:52 - the image but the circle circle would do
04:55 - better
04:56 - the inner circle to be more specific
04:59 - okay
05:00 - now in this uh once this circle is
05:02 - selected you can see
05:04 - a big dot a bold dot over here
05:07 - so all you need to do is click on that
05:09 - and then drag it to the screen where you
05:10 - want it to
05:11 - navigate on clicked okay and then over
05:15 - here you have different
05:16 - options on how to animate the
05:19 - transition from the screen to the screen
05:21 - like move in move out
05:23 - for now i'll let it be in instant you
05:25 - can try
05:27 - the other things on your own okay so
05:30 - with this
05:31 - now i'll go back to design so now
05:34 - over here if i click on broccoli i am
05:37 - taken to the
05:38 - ticket to the next screen okay so the
05:41 - prototyping worked okay now let's add a
05:45 - big image of
05:46 - broccoli so again
05:49 - create a new one put it inside the
05:52 - screen
05:56 - okay so the image size auto is
05:59 - perfect in itself okay this looks decent
06:02 - enough
06:04 - now let's add the price so
06:08 - i'll select this one and again bring it
06:11 - over here
06:14 - over here as you as i dis as we
06:17 - discussed in one of the previous videos
06:19 - that
06:19 - all our things will be beyond this
06:23 - first reddish line okay so now over here
06:27 - i'll add a price
06:30 - let's say 200 rupees per kg
06:33 - okay so this is our price
06:37 - i'll i'll push it little bit downwards
06:40 - okay
06:41 - now you can see that this square is
06:43 - getting
06:44 - selected every time i come here but i
06:46 - don't want that
06:47 - i don't want this square to get selected
06:50 - sorry not a square this rectangle to get
06:52 - selected
06:53 - so what i can do is i'll simply come
06:55 - over here
06:56 - and click on this lock icon so once we
06:59 - have locked this
07:00 - now you see if i hover over here it is
07:03 - not
07:04 - getting selected and if i remove this
07:06 - then
07:07 - if i over hover over here then it will
07:10 - be able to be selected okay so for now
07:13 - we don't need that so i'll lock it
07:16 - okay now let's add a description
07:19 - of the product so again create a new one
07:23 - bring it over here
07:30 - i wanted to be till here
07:33 - okay now let's edit
07:45 - okay so i'll copy it
07:49 - paste it once again so we have a long
07:52 - text
07:53 - now let's change the color
07:56 - color will be green okay and let's see
08:00 - if
08:01 - 10 works maybe i'll increase its size a
08:04 - little bit
08:05 - okay 12 seems fine
08:08 - now i don't need this much of our
08:10 - description
08:11 - so when we make the app we will limit
08:14 - the user to add
08:16 - only a certain number of characters in
08:19 - description
08:20 - okay so this is done so this is
08:23 - how our screen looks until now now we
08:26 - need to
08:27 - add an option to buy now or add it to
08:29 - cart
08:30 - and then order multiple things together
08:32 - so let's do
08:33 - that as well i'm gonna add a square box
08:38 - again
08:42 - now let's say okay this size
08:45 - seems fine
08:49 - okay i'm gonna give it uh our again the
08:52 - primary color
08:54 - and i am gonna add a border radius of
08:56 - five on all the sides
08:57 - okay so that its corners are smoothened
09:02 - okay now i'll again add this text over
09:06 - here
09:08 - i need to bring it to the front okay
09:11 - once done i'll change its color to
09:13 - white and then the text will be saying
09:21 - by now okay now i don't need it to be
09:24 - medium i'll make it light
09:26 - reduce the size to
09:29 - 15 15 seems fine now i'll make it
09:33 - uh align all the things
09:36 - horizontally and vertically okay so now
09:39 - once this is done i'll select
09:43 - select the button and create a new one
09:46 - okay and then again uh to
09:50 - in this one i'll add a stroke the stroke
09:52 - will be of
09:53 - width 1.5 where stroke is nothing but
09:56 - the
09:56 - border i'll give it our primary color
10:00 - okay remove the fill color
10:04 - and then i'll select the text and make
10:06 - it our
10:07 - primary color and this text will say
10:11 - add to cart
10:16 - okay now again these things need to be
10:20 - in the center
10:22 - so i'll align it okay so this is how it
10:25 - looks
10:26 - i think we need a little bit more white
10:28 - space from the
10:29 - bottom navigation bar so i'm gonna push
10:31 - it a little bit upwards
10:34 - so select it and then click on the
10:39 - up arrow okay so now this looks better
10:44 - now over here we are gonna display the
10:46 - sellers information
10:48 - so for that i am gonna select the
10:51 - design of a review over here okay and
10:54 - over here will basically have a seller's
10:59 - description or review something about
11:02 - the seller let's
11:03 - we'll decide that later once we develop
11:06 - we'll see
11:07 - which one is more convenient at that
11:09 - point okay so
11:11 - beside the name there should be seller
11:13 - written on it
11:14 - okay so that the people understand i'll
11:17 - i'll reduce
11:18 - i'm sorry i'll reduce its rating from
11:22 - 4 star to 3 star okay
11:29 - let's see and then i'll add its address
11:32 - over here let's say
11:36 - l road snp area
11:40 - best stupor
11:44 - jamshedpur so this is uh the market
11:47 - and jamshedpur okay so now
11:51 - i'll make it from light i'll change it
11:55 - to medium to make it more significant
11:58 - as compared to the text
12:01 - that we have over here okay which we
12:04 - will decide later is
12:05 - gonna be the is gonna be related
12:09 - to the seller or review about the seller
12:13 - okay so we can decide that later once we
12:16 - reach the point to do so and with this
12:19 - this screen is done as well okay so this
12:22 - screen also looks pretty
12:24 - decent okay this will be the description
12:27 - of
12:27 - our products okay
12:31 - so now for practice i suggest you create
12:33 - for all the other items as well
12:35 - in the next video we will start with the
12:37 - back end make these two screen
12:40 - make the prepare the back end required
12:42 - for these two screens
12:44 - make the front end that is our flutter
12:46 - application for
12:47 - these two screens and then we shall
12:49 - again start with figma
12:51 - so thank you
