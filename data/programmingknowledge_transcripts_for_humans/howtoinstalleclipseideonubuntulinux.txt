00:00 - hey guys in this video I'm going to show
00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:03 - eclipse photon IDE on your bun to
00:07 - operating system so let's get started so
00:10 - in order to install eclipse on Ubuntu
00:12 - operating system you need to have a Java
00:15 - JDK installed on your system and then
00:19 - you will be able to install the Eclipse
00:22 - IDE so I have written here two ways of
00:26 - installing Java JDK on your own to
00:29 - operating system one is if you want to
00:33 - install open JDK version of Java then
00:37 - this is the command for doing so if you
00:41 - are interested in installing the Oracle
00:44 - Java version then these are the commands
00:47 - for installing the Oracle Java JDK and
00:51 - all these commands I'm going to give you
00:53 - in the description of this video so you
00:56 - can directly copy these commands and
00:59 - paste it into your terminal and then you
01:02 - can install java jdk on your ubuntu
01:05 - operating system in this case i'm going
01:08 - to use the open JDK version of Java so
01:11 - I'm going to just copy this command and
01:13 - I'm going to open the terminal
01:15 - to open the terminal you can just press
01:18 - ctrl alt T and the terminal will be open
01:22 - or otherwise you can click on this icon
01:26 - here and then search for the terminal
01:31 - and then you can click on this terminal
01:33 - and the terminal will be open so once
01:37 - your terminal is open I'm going to paste
01:39 - the command which I have copied which is
01:41 - sudo apt-get install open JDK - 8 - JDK
01:47 - and then press ENTER and then I'm going
01:50 - to give the password of my Ubuntu
01:52 - operating system and then press Enter
01:55 - which is going to start installing this
01:58 - open JDK and in here I'm going to just
02:01 - press Y and then press Enter
02:03 - and then I just need to wait for the
02:06 - installation to complete so I'm going to
02:09 - leave this command to run and finish and
02:12 - by the meantime
02:13 - I'm going to just download our Eclipse
02:16 - IDE installer so just search for eclipse
02:21 - on your favorite browser and the first
02:23 - link which will appear here will be from
02:25 - Eclipse or G so I'm going to click on
02:27 - this link and once you are inside this
02:31 - Eclipse dot o-- r-- g-- website you will
02:34 - be directly able to see this download
02:37 - button on the top right hand side or
02:40 - otherwise you can just scroll down and
02:43 - you can see here the newest version
02:45 - available for Eclipse is Eclipse Photon
02:48 - and then if you want to learn more about
02:50 - Eclipse photon then you can just click
02:53 - on this button and there also you will
02:55 - be able to see the download button so
02:58 - I'm going to click on this download
03:00 - button here and then you will be able to
03:02 - see this kind of download page and when
03:05 - you scroll down you will be able to see
03:07 - this option which says get Eclipse
03:09 - photon and then you just need to click
03:12 - on this button which is download 64 bit
03:16 - for the Linux operating system
03:18 - and here you will be able to see the
03:20 - download button once again so I'm going
03:22 - to click on this button and then you can
03:24 - see this Eclipse installer will be
03:26 - downloaded as a dot tar dot GZ file so
03:31 - I'm going to save this tar.gz file on my
03:35 - Ubuntu operating system it's about 45
03:37 - megabyte file so it will take some time
03:40 - to download so once this download is
03:42 - complete we are going to start
03:45 - installing eclipse so now this tar dot t
03:49 - that file is downloaded on my open to
03:51 - operating system so I will go to the
03:53 - directory where I have downloaded this
03:56 - file and I'm going to extract it but
03:59 - before that let's see if our open JDK
04:01 - command is finished or not so you can
04:04 - see my open JDK command is finished
04:07 - that means Java is installed on my
04:10 - system so what I can do here is I'm
04:12 - going to give this command Java -
04:15 - version and then press Enter and it
04:19 - returns me the version of Java which I
04:23 - have installed so if you see this kind
04:25 - of output when you get
04:27 - this command then Java is installed
04:30 - properly on your open to operating
04:32 - system and now you are ready to install
04:34 - Eclipse so I'm going to minimize the
04:37 - browser first of all and you can see we
04:41 - have this tar dot cheesehead file so I'm
04:43 - going to extract this file inside my
04:46 - downloads folder itself so I'm going to
04:49 - just say extract here and now you can
04:52 - see this is the folder which is
04:53 - extracted from this or tar dot cheese at
04:56 - file so I'm going to go inside this
04:58 - folder and once again I'm going to go
05:00 - inside the Eclipse installer folder and
05:02 - here you will be able to see some
05:05 - directories and some files
05:07 - so the important file for us is this one
05:10 - which is Eclipse - inst so this is a
05:14 - binary so we can right click on this
05:17 - binary and then we can just click on
05:21 - this run option which is going to start
05:24 - the installer so you can see the
05:27 - installer has been started and now I can
05:30 - see this kind of window here so here you
05:33 - will be able to see different options
05:36 - for installing Eclipse IDE so if you
05:40 - want to install Eclipse IDE for Java
05:43 - developers this is the one you can
05:45 - choose if you want to develop C and C++
05:48 - programs then you can choose this
05:50 - version if you want to use Eclipse IDE
05:52 - for Java development and web development
05:55 - then you can choose this version and
05:56 - there are many kind of Eclipse IDE which
06:00 - is available so what we are going to do
06:03 - is we are going to choose the first
06:05 - option which is Eclipse IDE for Java
06:07 - developer so I'm going to just click on
06:10 - this option and then you will be able to
06:14 - see at this part this is the default
06:16 - part where your Eclipse IDE will be
06:20 - installed so I'm going to just click on
06:23 - this install button which is going to
06:26 - start installing this Eclipse IDE and
06:29 - now in between you will be able to see
06:31 - this kind of license terms and
06:33 - conditions window so if you agree with
06:36 - those license terms and conditions you
06:39 - can just check this check
06:41 - and then just press on the accept button
06:44 - which is going to continue the
06:46 - installation process so I'm going to
06:48 - wait for the installation to complete
06:49 - and now after some time I can see this
06:52 - message which says do you trust these
06:54 - certificates I'm going to just select
06:57 - all so I'm going to click on this button
06:59 - which says select all and then I'm going
07:02 - to just press on accept selected and
07:04 - then the installation will continue and
07:10 - now I can see that the installation is
07:13 - finished and I can see this launch
07:16 - button so I'm going to click on this
07:18 - launch button which is going to launch
07:20 - the Eclipse IDE for me now for the first
07:23 - time when eclipse starts it'll ask you
07:26 - for selecting the default workspace
07:29 - where all your project will be saved so
07:32 - this is the default workspace which is
07:35 - selected by Eclipse for you so if you
07:38 - have the good reason to change it you
07:40 - can change it by clicking this Browse
07:42 - button and then just browsing to the
07:44 - directory which you want to set it as
07:47 - default so I'm going to leave this path
07:50 - as default and I'm going to check this
07:52 - checkbox which says use this as a
07:54 - default and do not ask again and I'm
07:58 - going to click on the launch button and
07:59 - now you can see Eclipse IDE has been
08:02 - launched so I'm going to maximize it so
08:04 - let's create a Java project in order to
08:07 - verify that everything is working fine
08:09 - with this Eclipse IDE so I'm going to
08:13 - click on this file option and then I'm
08:15 - going to select new and then Java
08:18 - project and in here I'm going to give
08:22 - the name of my Java project for example
08:25 - hello world and you can see this is the
08:28 - default location of your project which
08:31 - is inside the Eclipse workspace and
08:33 - under JRE you can see that Eclipse has
08:36 - chosen this Java SE 1.8 by default for
08:40 - your project which is ok so I'm going to
08:43 - leave it as default and then I'm going
08:46 - to leave also this project layout also
08:49 - as default and I'm going to just say
08:51 - finish which is going to create my
08:53 - project
08:54 - but when your project is created because
08:57 - this welcome window is open you will not
09:00 - be able to see it so we need to minimize
09:02 - this welcome window by clicking on this
09:05 - minimize button and once you click on
09:08 - this minimize button you will be able to
09:10 - see this hello world project which you
09:12 - have created so you can see there is a
09:15 - source folder here so I'm going to right
09:17 - click on this source folder and I'm
09:20 - going to just say new and then we are
09:22 - going to create a class here and in this
09:25 - new Java class window I'm going to just
09:28 - give the name of my class for example
09:31 - demo and then under the section which
09:35 - says which method stubs would you like
09:38 - to create we are going to check this
09:41 - checkbox also which says public static
09:43 - void main which is going to create this
09:47 - method for us and we are going to click
09:50 - finish now which is going to create this
09:53 - demo dot Java file so now I can see this
09:57 - demo dot Java file here and this is the
10:00 - default code which is auto-generated my
10:04 - Eclipse for us so let's print something
10:06 - I'm going to just write system dot out
10:09 - dot print Ln for print line and inside
10:15 - the parentheses and inside the double
10:17 - quotes I'm going to just write hello
10:19 - world so just print hello world and then
10:23 - I'm going to save my program and I'm
10:26 - going to run my program by just clicking
10:28 - on this green icon here which is going
10:33 - to compile the program and run the
10:36 - program and on the console here you can

see if our open JDK command is finished or not so you can see my open JDK command is finished that means Java is installed on my system so what I can do here is I'm going to give this command Java version and then press Enter and it returns me the version of Java which I have installed so if you see this kind of output when you get this command then Java is installed properly on your open to
