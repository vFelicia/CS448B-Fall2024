00:00 - hey what's up guys welcome back to our
00:01 - YouTube channel and welcome to this
00:03 - video so this is part 8 of our HP
00:07 - restful api tutorial and in this video
00:09 - guys we're going to discuss the update
00:13 - so basically we're just going to add the
00:15 - update function or feature into our page
00:18 - be restful api project so we have here d
00:22 - create function as you can see from our
00:25 - post that PHP file and then we're going
00:29 - to copy the whole function because the
00:33 - idea of create and update is almost the
00:36 - same so we're just going to copy all
00:38 - this included in this particular create
00:42 - function and then right below that we
00:46 - can paste the update so we're just going
00:50 - to name our function into update ok
00:55 - so this is the half-day post function ok
01:04 - and of course the query will be a bit
01:06 - different because we're updating a
01:09 - record now so we'll just say update this
01:15 - stable and set all the necessary
01:17 - attributes so for example the title the
01:21 - body the author and of course the
01:23 - category ID and since we're updating a
01:27 - record we need to set the ID or like
01:34 - filter by ID because we don't want to
01:37 - update all the records so for now let's
01:40 - just say we're ID equals we can use the
01:47 - question mark or we can also use the
01:51 - placeholder colon ID and of course we
01:56 - can also do the cleaning of data of the
02:00 - ID so setup category ID and also here
02:07 - we're just going to say ID and then
02:11 - this align with the other attributes
02:14 - okay and then of course we need to bind
02:17 - the param parameter so we're using the
02:25 - IDS placeholder for our ID and the value
02:31 - will be this and then ID and then it
02:35 - should also execute the query and then
02:41 - return true if the query is successful
02:45 - otherwise print the error message and of
02:49 - course return false so in our project we
02:54 - need to create another create another
02:59 - file for our API so we have already
03:02 - create that PHP also the read underscore
03:06 - single dot PHP and then read that PHP so
03:09 - now we need to add another one for our
03:14 - update so that will be update that PHP
03:17 - and of course also sort of basis from
03:21 - for this update dot PHP we can just copy
03:25 - all the lines of codes that we have
03:30 - added in our case that PHP and then
03:33 - paste it in or update at PHP because I
03:36 - as I've said the logic behind or the
03:40 - theory behind the create and update is
03:42 - almost the same okay so but instead of
03:47 - using post it should be good okay and
03:52 - then we also need to have the ID here so
04:00 - post title and then the ID because we're
04:07 - specifying the ID of the post or the
04:11 - record that we want to update and of
04:15 - course instead of using her aid we
04:17 - should call the method update and of
04:22 - course it should be post up
04:25 - dated and post not updated okay so so I
04:32 - think that's all there is to it for this
04:34 - update that PHP file so let's try that
04:38 - in our postman software so we have here
04:42 - the 8 that PHP so we're going to use
04:45 - update that PHP and then specify the ID
04:52 - of the record that we want to update so
04:56 - ID and then colon and then let's try it
04:59 - let's try to see which post or record
05:04 - that we want to update so we have added
05:07 - this sample API post by using our create
05:10 - that PHP file right before or from the
05:14 - previous video so the ID of this is 5 so
05:18 - let's just use that so ID is 5 5 and
05:26 - then let's just say updated updated API
05:34 - post sample body of an API some full
05:41 - body of an updated update API pose from
05:48 - a request so we have the same author
05:53 - category ID and also the ID that we're
06:00 - going to specify or update and of course
06:03 - because in our update dot PHP we specify
06:10 - that it should be a put method so of
06:13 - course we need to use that in our
06:17 - postman in order for us to properly
06:21 - update the data
06:24 - ok so send and let's try that and the
06:28 - record or the response says that the
06:32 - pose has been updated so let's try to
06:34 - read all the data
06:38 - so as you can see here we have updated
06:42 - the title and of course we have updated
06:45 - the body of our post so as you can see
06:50 - the update function or the update
06:52 - feature of our PHP rest or the PHP API
06:57 - that we are developing is working so the
07:01 - next step is to create another one or
07:04 - another feature we will be adding
07:07 - another feature in store page by REST
07:09 - API so basically we all have the reading
07:16 - of all the data reading of a single data
07:19 - or single record and then also we have
07:21 - creating a record and also the updates
07:25 - so the last one will be the delete of a
07:30 - certain record ok so basically the same
07:35 - idea we will be adding the function here
07:41 - for our delete so that will be delete or
07:45 - public function delete it should be an
07:50 - easy function right here so right below
07:52 - the update function we will have to add
07:57 - the delete function so that's public
08:03 - function and then delete okay and we
08:11 - just need to create the query here so
08:16 - that will be query and then of course
08:20 - delete from and then this table and of
08:30 - course where ID we need to specify the
08:35 - ID of the record that we want to delete
08:39 - and then we need to say we are preparing
08:45 - the statement prepare statement so as
08:50 - the empty
08:51 - and using the connection prepare so
09:01 - query and of course we need to clean
09:06 - clean the data so we can just copy the
09:16 - this particular line so clean data and
09:21 - yeah ID and of course we need to buy in
09:25 - the parameter so SD empty and then Vine
09:31 - parameter specify the ID and of course
09:38 - the actual value and we're going to
09:44 - execute the query the same thing here so
09:50 - just like that so basically we're just
09:53 - returning true if the statement has been
09:57 - successful otherwise we need to print
10:00 - the error and return false so I think
10:03 - that's all there is to it for this video
10:05 - and in the next video guys I'm going to
10:08 - continue working on with this delete and
10:11 - we're going to add another file for our
10:13 - API to actually delete the files or
10:15 - actually delete the record from our
10:18 - database so thank you for watching and
10:21 - see you in the next video thanks

Cleaned transcript:

hey what's up guys welcome back to our YouTube channel and welcome to this video so this is part 8 of our HP restful api tutorial and in this video guys we're going to discuss the update so basically we're just going to add the update function or feature into our page be restful api project so we have here d create function as you can see from our post that PHP file and then we're going to copy the whole function because the idea of create and update is almost the same so we're just going to copy all this included in this particular create function and then right below that we can paste the update so we're just going to name our function into update ok so this is the halfday post function ok and of course the query will be a bit different because we're updating a record now so we'll just say update this stable and set all the necessary attributes so for example the title the body the author and of course the category ID and since we're updating a record we need to set the ID or like filter by ID because we don't want to update all the records so for now let's just say we're ID equals we can use the question mark or we can also use the placeholder colon ID and of course we can also do the cleaning of data of the ID so setup category ID and also here we're just going to say ID and then this align with the other attributes okay and then of course we need to bind the param parameter so we're using the IDS placeholder for our ID and the value will be this and then ID and then it should also execute the query and then return true if the query is successful otherwise print the error message and of course return false so in our project we need to create another create another file for our API so we have already create that PHP also the read underscore single dot PHP and then read that PHP so now we need to add another one for our update so that will be update that PHP and of course also sort of basis from for this update dot PHP we can just copy all the lines of codes that we have added in our case that PHP and then paste it in or update at PHP because I as I've said the logic behind or the theory behind the create and update is almost the same okay so but instead of using post it should be good okay and then we also need to have the ID here so post title and then the ID because we're specifying the ID of the post or the record that we want to update and of course instead of using her aid we should call the method update and of course it should be post up dated and post not updated okay so so I think that's all there is to it for this update that PHP file so let's try that in our postman software so we have here the 8 that PHP so we're going to use update that PHP and then specify the ID of the record that we want to update so ID and then colon and then let's try it let's try to see which post or record that we want to update so we have added this sample API post by using our create that PHP file right before or from the previous video so the ID of this is 5 so let's just use that so ID is 5 5 and then let's just say updated updated API post sample body of an API some full body of an updated update API pose from a request so we have the same author category ID and also the ID that we're going to specify or update and of course because in our update dot PHP we specify that it should be a put method so of course we need to use that in our postman in order for us to properly update the data ok so send and let's try that and the record or the response says that the pose has been updated so let's try to read all the data so as you can see here we have updated the title and of course we have updated the body of our post so as you can see the update function or the update feature of our PHP rest or the PHP API that we are developing is working so the next step is to create another one or another feature we will be adding another feature in store page by REST API so basically we all have the reading of all the data reading of a single data or single record and then also we have creating a record and also the updates so the last one will be the delete of a certain record ok so basically the same idea we will be adding the function here for our delete so that will be delete or public function delete it should be an easy function right here so right below the update function we will have to add the delete function so that's public function and then delete okay and we just need to create the query here so that will be query and then of course delete from and then this table and of course where ID we need to specify the ID of the record that we want to delete and then we need to say we are preparing the statement prepare statement so as the empty and using the connection prepare so query and of course we need to clean clean the data so we can just copy the this particular line so clean data and yeah ID and of course we need to buy in the parameter so SD empty and then Vine parameter specify the ID and of course the actual value and we're going to execute the query the same thing here so just like that so basically we're just returning true if the statement has been successful otherwise we need to print the error and return false so I think that's all there is to it for this video and in the next video guys I'm going to continue working on with this delete and we're going to add another file for our API to actually delete the files or actually delete the record from our database so thank you for watching and see you in the next video thanks
