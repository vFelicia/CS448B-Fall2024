00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Jenkins tutorial for beginners in this
00:04 - video I'm going to show you how we can
00:06 - create a multi branch pipeline project
00:09 - in Jenkins so first of all what is a
00:12 - multi branch pipeline project so the
00:15 - multi branch pipeline project type
00:17 - enables you to implement different
00:19 - Jenkins files for the different branches
00:23 - of your project now generally in the
00:28 - software teams which is working on our
00:30 - project different developers can work on
00:34 - different features so let's say our team
00:37 - is working on a project called my app
00:39 - and we have a few developers in this
00:43 - team and master branch is generally the
00:47 - final product right which is going to be
00:51 - run in the production now when the
00:54 - developers work on some features they
00:57 - generally create a branch out of this
01:00 - git repository so for example here when
01:04 - you click on branches option here I have
01:07 - one a branch which is feature one so in
01:09 - a normal software project whenever some
01:12 - developer works on some feature he
01:15 - creates a branch and when this feature
01:18 - is implemented he or she merges this
01:21 - feature into the master branch now at
01:23 - the time when this feature is going on
01:26 - and the developer is working on how can
01:29 - he test this feature using Jenkins as
01:32 - well as the master branch so multi
01:36 - branch pipeline project allows us to
01:39 - test all the branches of your project at
01:43 - the same time using Jenkins
01:45 - so let's create a multi branch pipeline
01:48 - project in Jenkins and then we will see
01:50 - how it works so just click on new item
01:54 - here and then give any name to your
01:59 - Jenkins project for example Multi
02:03 - pipeline project and then scroll down
02:06 - and you will be able to see this option
02:08 - which is multi branch pipeline so select
02:11 - this option and then click OK
02:13 - so my multi-branch pipeline project is
02:15 - created and here you can give some
02:18 - description about your project and in
02:21 - the branch source you can give the URL
02:25 - of your github project so here you can
02:28 - just click on add source and click on
02:30 - git and then just copy the URL of your
02:36 - github repository by just clicking on
02:38 - clone or download and then copy this URL
02:41 - from here and then paste it here where
02:45 - it says project repository I don't need
02:48 - to provide any credentials because this
02:51 - project is publicly available but if you
02:53 - want to add your credentials you can add
02:55 - it from here and then in the next
02:58 - section you will see behaviors and there
03:01 - is this option which is automatically
03:03 - enabled which is discover branches so
03:07 - your Jenkins job is going to
03:09 - automatically discover your branches and
03:12 - then run your test on all the branches
03:16 - now it's important to notice here is I
03:21 - have this Jenkins file here in my
03:23 - project right so make sure that this
03:26 - Jenkins file is there we have already
03:28 - seen how we can add this Jenkins file to
03:31 - our github project in the previous video
03:34 - so I'm not going to tell you how to do
03:36 - this but make sure that your project
03:38 - have this Jenkins file and then when you
03:41 - scroll down you will be able to see this
03:45 - section which says build configuration
03:48 - and in the mode you will be able to see
03:50 - only one option here which is jenkins
03:52 - file and you need to provide the path of
03:54 - your Jenkins file here and because my
03:57 - Jenkins file is on the root directory so
04:01 - I don't need to change the path of this
04:04 - Jenkins file right now when you scroll
04:06 - down more you will be able to see scan
04:09 - multi-branch
04:09 - pipeline trigger and for now we only
04:13 - have one trigger which is periodically
04:15 - if not otherwise run so when you check
04:19 - on this check box you can run the scan
04:22 - on your project every minute or every
04:25 - two minutes or
04:26 - every you know this time period which is
04:30 - given in the list okay
04:32 - so for example I can just set it to
04:34 - every five minute then Jenkins will scan
04:38 - your project every five minutes and it
04:41 - will just look whether your project have
04:44 - any extra branch or not and if you have
04:47 - committed any changes then it will run
04:49 - the test on every branch of your github
04:53 - project now rest of the thing I will
04:55 - leave them as default because we don't
04:58 - need to use them for now
05:00 - so orphan item strategy we will not be
05:03 - using and then health metrics we can
05:06 - just click on this and you can see there
05:08 - is a one health matrix which is child
05:11 - item with worst health pipeline
05:14 - libraries we don't have any pipeline
05:16 - libraries so we are going to leave this
05:18 - as default and then the pipeline model
05:22 - definition we also don't have any model
05:24 - definitions so I'm going to leave it as
05:26 - default so what we have given here in
05:29 - the configuration the URL of our project
05:32 - and make sure that you have the Jenkins
05:35 - file in your github project so just
05:38 - choose or leave it as default which is
05:40 - Jenkins file and then click on Save
05:44 - button and as soon as you press the Save
05:48 - button you will see a scan will start on
05:51 - your multi branch project and this scan
05:54 - is scanning the branches in your github
05:58 - project and you will be able to see two
06:01 - tasks which are parallel running here
06:04 - one on the master branch you can see one
06:07 - on the master branch is running and
06:09 - other scan tasks is running on the
06:12 - feature branch and the same branches are
06:15 - available in my github project also so I
06:18 - have feature one branch and the master
06:21 - branch that's why there are two tasks
06:24 - running to scan them and when I click on
06:26 - my project here you will be able to see
06:29 - two jobs here which are running one is
06:33 - the master branch job and other is the
06:37 - feature branch job and you can
06:39 - individually
06:40 - click on every job so I'm going to click
06:42 - on the master job here and you can see
06:44 - this job is going on and you will be
06:48 - able to see the stages of this job which
06:50 - are currently running so this job is
06:53 - successful you can see and we can also
06:56 - go to the feature branch job also and
06:59 - you can see it's also successfully
07:02 - tested so that's why both of them
07:04 - showing the success now let me show you
07:07 - how you can create a new branch in gate
07:09 - and push it to your github project and
07:12 - how this trigger works so I'm going to
07:16 - open the terminal first of all and then
07:19 - I am going to CD to my project so I'm
07:22 - going to just CD to my project in which
07:26 - I am working on I have already checked
07:29 - out my project here now to view all the
07:33 - branches in your project you can give
07:34 - this command git branch and then press
07:39 - enter and it's going to show you all the
07:40 - branches in your project so I have two
07:43 - branches right now in my project one is
07:45 - master and other is feature one so let's
07:48 - create one new branch so in order to
07:50 - create a new branch you just need to
07:52 - give this command git branch and your
07:54 - branch name so so let's say I'm going to
07:56 - create a feature branch 2 here so I'm
08:01 - going to write feature 2 and then press
08:03 - Enter and now we are going to list all
08:06 - the branches once again and now you can
08:09 - see there are 3 branches in my project
08:11 - so one is master branch and other two
08:14 - are feature branches now in order to
08:16 - push this branch to your github
08:18 - repository you can give this command git
08:21 - push origin and then your branch name so
08:26 - my branch name is feature 2 and then
08:28 - press ENTER and you can see this branch
08:30 - is now pushed to our github repository
08:33 - so we can verify it by going to our
08:36 - github repository and then refreshing
08:39 - this web page and I'm going to once
08:41 - again click on branches and you can see
08:43 - our new branch is visible here which is
08:45 - feature two okay so now once we have the
08:49 - new branch we can trigger them with some
08:52 - web hooks
08:53 - like jeera or get bucket but right now
08:56 - we don't have any webhook so we are
08:59 - going to just press on this button which
09:00 - says scan multi-branch
09:03 - pipeline now so I'm going to just click
09:05 - on this and then I'm going to scroll
09:07 - down a little and you can see there is a
09:10 - new task running here which is for the
09:14 - feature branch to and when i refresh
09:17 - this webpage so I'm going to refresh
09:19 - this Jenkins webpage and now you can see
09:21 - this feature branch to Jenkins task is
09:25 - running right so when I click on this
09:27 - feature branch to this build is running
09:31 - and you can see all the tasks are here
09:35 - running and the build is successful now
09:37 - so now you have three branches and you
09:41 - can see the result of three branches in
09:44 - your champions repository so this is how
09:47 - you can create a multi branch pipeline
09:49 - project in Jenkins I hope you've enjoyed

hey guys welcome to the next video on Jenkins tutorial for beginners in this video I'm going to show you how we can create a multi branch pipeline project in Jenkins so first of all what is a multi branch pipeline project so the multi branch pipeline project type enables you to implement different Jenkins files for the different branches of your project now generally in the software teams which is working on our project different developers can work on different features so let's say our team is working on a project called my app and we have a few developers in this team and master branch is generally the final product right which is going to be run in the production now when the developers work on some features they generally create a branch out of this git repository so for example here when you click on branches option here I have one a branch which is feature one so in a normal software project whenever some developer works on some feature he creates a branch and when this feature is implemented he or she merges this feature into the master branch now at the time when this feature is going on and the developer is working on how can he test this feature using Jenkins as well as the master branch so multi branch pipeline project allows us to test all the branches of your project at the same time using Jenkins so let's create a multi branch pipeline project in Jenkins and then we will see how it works so just click on new item here and then give any name to your Jenkins project for example Multi pipeline project and then scroll down and you will be able to see this option which is multi branch pipeline so select this option and then click OK so my multibranch pipeline project is created and here you can give some description about your project and in the branch source you can give the URL of your github project so here you can just click on add source and click on git and then just copy the URL of your github repository by just clicking on clone or download and then copy this URL from here and then paste it here where it says project repository I don't need to provide any credentials because this project is publicly available but if you want to add your credentials you can add it from here and then in the next section you will see behaviors and there is this option which is automatically enabled which is discover branches so your Jenkins job is going to automatically discover your branches and then run your test on all the branches now it's important to notice here is I have this Jenkins file here in my project right so make sure that this Jenkins file is there we have already seen how we can add this Jenkins file to our github project in the previous video so I'm not going to tell you how to do this but make sure that your project have this Jenkins file and then when you scroll down you will be able to see this section which says build configuration and in the mode you will be able to see only one option here which is jenkins file and you need to provide the path of your Jenkins file here and because my Jenkins file is on the root directory so I don't need to change the path of this Jenkins file right now when you scroll down more you will be able to see scan multibranch pipeline trigger and for now we only have one trigger which is periodically if not otherwise run so when you check on this check box you can run the scan on your project every minute or every two minutes or every you know this time period which is given in the list okay so for example I can just set it to every five minute then Jenkins will scan your project every five minutes and it will just look whether your project have any extra branch or not and if you have committed any changes then it will run the test on every branch of your github project now rest of the thing I will leave them as default because we don't need to use them for now so orphan item strategy we will not be using and then health metrics we can just click on this and you can see there is a one health matrix which is child item with worst health pipeline libraries we don't have any pipeline libraries so we are going to leave this as default and then the pipeline model definition we also don't have any model definitions so I'm going to leave it as default so what we have given here in the configuration the URL of our project and make sure that you have the Jenkins file in your github project so just choose or leave it as default which is Jenkins file and then click on Save button and as soon as you press the Save button you will see a scan will start on your multi branch project and this scan is scanning the branches in your github project and you will be able to see two tasks which are parallel running here one on the master branch you can see one on the master branch is running and other scan tasks is running on the feature branch and the same branches are available in my github project also so I have feature one branch and the master branch that's why there are two tasks running to scan them and when I click on my project here you will be able to see two jobs here which are running one is the master branch job and other is the feature branch job and you can individually click on every job so I'm going to click on the master job here and you can see this job is going on and you will be able to see the stages of this job which are currently running so this job is successful you can see and we can also go to the feature branch job also and you can see it's also successfully tested so that's why both of them showing the success now let me show you how you can create a new branch in gate and push it to your github project and how this trigger works so I'm going to open the terminal first of all and then I am going to CD to my project so I'm going to just CD to my project in which I am working on I have already checked out my project here now to view all the branches in your project you can give this command git branch and then press enter and it's going to show you all the branches in your project so I have two branches right now in my project one is master and other is feature one so let's create one new branch so in

visible here which is feature two okay so now once we have the new branch we can trigger them with some web hooks like jeera or get bucket but right now we don't have any webhook so we are going to just press on this button which says scan multibranch pipeline now so I'm going to just click on this and then I'm going to scroll down a little and you can see there is a new task running here which is for the feature branch to and when i refresh this webpage so I'm going to refresh this Jenkins webpage and now you can see this feature branch to Jenkins task is running right so when I click on this feature branch to this build is running and you can see all the tasks are here running and the build is successful now so now you have three branches and you can see the result of three branches in your champions repository so this is how you can create a multi branch pipeline project in Jenkins I hope you've enjoyed this video please rate comment subscribe and bye for now
