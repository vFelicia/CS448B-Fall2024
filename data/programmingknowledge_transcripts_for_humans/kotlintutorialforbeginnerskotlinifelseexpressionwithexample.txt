00:00 - in this video we are going to cover
00:02 - the if else statements in gotland
00:06 - so
00:07 - if you don't have any particular idea
00:09 - about if else statement what an fl
00:11 - statement does is
00:13 - it checks and it checks in condition
00:17 - that if this condition is true then it
00:19 - goes to the particular
00:21 - body and then performs some operation
00:24 - and if that condition is not true it
00:25 - just skips the whole body and
00:29 - goes to the else statement
00:31 - and then it performs the operation
00:33 - mentioned in the else statement so it
00:35 - basically is
00:37 - like if this is true then this then do
00:39 - this and if else do this okay so uh we
00:44 - will just go through the syntax of the
00:46 - if else statement so it is the block
00:48 - body of an fl statement
00:51 - so uh when i write if some condition
00:55 - and then i'll uh so i'll write if is a
00:58 - keyword
00:59 - and then i'll
01:02 - open a parenthesis and write condition
01:04 - in there and i'll close this parenthesis
01:07 - and
01:07 - i'll open curly braces and i'll write
01:10 - function or we can say the operation we
01:13 - have to perform there and we will write
01:15 - we will close the curly brace and we
01:17 - will write the
01:18 - the keyword else
01:20 - and then we will open the braces and
01:24 - then i'll mention the operation or the
01:28 - function or the
01:29 - code that i have to perform
01:31 - and then i
01:33 - close the
01:34 - braces okay
01:36 - so this is the block body
01:39 - now i will go ahead
01:40 - and
01:41 - create a main function
01:45 - and outside the main function
01:47 - i will create a function named block
01:50 - body
01:51 - because there are three types in which i
01:53 - can
01:54 - determine the effects
01:56 - statements so i'll just go one by one
02:00 - so for block body
02:03 - so
02:04 - we will take an example of finding a
02:06 - maximum from a and b okay
02:09 - so
02:10 - we will have to give
02:12 - the input
02:13 - a integer and
02:16 - b
02:20 - integer and
02:23 - the output the written type of this
02:26 - would also be an end because it returns
02:27 - the maximum
02:31 - so
02:32 - moving forward
02:34 - so i'll write the blog body of fel's
02:38 - statement here so if a is greater than b
02:43 - okay
02:44 - then what happens is so i'll just create
02:46 - a
02:48 - variable also here
02:50 - that is called max value
02:55 - okay
02:57 - so when a is greater than b
03:01 - what happens is
03:07 - when a is greater than b the maximum
03:09 - value is
03:14 - a
03:16 - okay
03:17 - and else
03:20 - when so else b would be greater than a
03:23 - so the maximum value would be
03:26 - b
03:29 - and we would return
03:33 - the maximum value which is max value
03:36 - okay so when i go in the main function
03:39 - and call the
03:42 - a block body function
03:44 - and
03:46 - find try to find the maximum of 23 and
03:49 - 45 and run this function
03:51 - so it should be printing the
03:55 - so it should not print anything because
03:57 - i haven't mentioned the print function
04:00 - so when i mention the print function
04:02 - here also
04:04 - and
04:05 - run the function again
04:08 - so it should mention here 45
04:11 - okay and it is correct
04:12 - so this might have give you this might
04:15 - have given you the basic understanding
04:17 - of the if else
04:19 - working okay so if a is greater than b
04:23 - then the max value should be equals to a
04:25 - and else if a is not greater than b else
04:29 - the max value should be equals to b
04:32 - okay
04:33 - so now i will go ahead and
04:36 - give you the idea of expression body
04:40 - so
04:43 - what is expression body
04:46 - so also in this i'll be printing the
04:49 - maximum of
04:50 - the two
04:52 - so i'll just
04:55 - mention
04:57 - the a and b integer and the return type
04:59 - as end
05:01 - now in the expression body i mentioned
05:04 - the value where the variable
05:07 - max value
05:10 - and
05:11 - give it a
05:13 - value of if
05:14 - so here only i start from f function
05:17 - so if a is greater than b
05:21 - then the max value is
05:22 - a and
05:25 - okay
05:26 - a
05:27 - and else
05:30 - the max value is b
05:33 - now we can see that
05:36 - okay i have to also return the max value
05:42 - so now now we can see that we have
05:44 - assigned we have defined a variable
05:46 - named max value
05:48 - that is equals to if a is greater than b
05:50 - that is equals to a and else that is
05:53 - equals to b
05:54 - so this is called the expression body
05:56 - so now if i replace the block body with
05:59 - the x
06:01 - pression body
06:03 - and run this again
06:06 - so it should be working fine and it
06:08 - should print 45
06:10 - so yeah it is working fine
06:13 - so
06:14 - if if you see this type of code written
06:18 - anywhere it is also an if else statement
06:21 - now there is another type of fl
06:23 - statement that is a also short shorter
06:26 - than this and it is also called short
06:29 - so now i'll just mention a function
06:31 - short
06:32 - it will also be
06:36 - comparing two integers
06:38 - so i'll just
06:41 - initialize the function
06:44 - now
06:45 - it should be equals to no
06:48 - before that okay i should open it and
06:51 - i'll just return already
06:54 - return if
06:56 - a is greater than b
07:00 - if a is greater than b
07:07 - okay
07:09 - if a is greater than b then written a
07:12 - and else
07:15 - written b
07:18 - so now we can see that
07:20 - we have directly mentioned the written
07:22 - function and
07:23 - written a if a is greater than b and
07:26 - written b if a is not written in b so
07:28 - what it it it means that
07:31 - okay
07:32 - so instead of expression body when i
07:34 - mention
07:36 - short
07:38 - and i run this function
07:41 - around this code
07:43 - i can see that
07:45 - the answer is again 45
07:47 - so in this video we have learned about
07:49 - the block body the expression body and
07:51 - the short
07:53 - of if else expression and we have
07:57 - a pretty
07:58 - thorough idea about the fl statement
08:02 - okay thank you

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we are going to cover the if else statements in gotland so if you don't have any particular idea about if else statement what an fl statement does is it checks and it checks in condition that if this condition is true then it goes to the particular body and then performs some operation and if that condition is not true it just skips the whole body and goes to the else statement and then it performs the operation mentioned in the else statement so it basically is like if this is true then this then do this and if else do this okay so uh we will just go through the syntax of the if else statement so it is the block body of an fl statement so uh when i write if some condition and then i'll uh so i'll write if is a keyword and then i'll open a parenthesis and write condition in there and i'll close this parenthesis and i'll open curly braces and i'll write function or we can say the operation we have to perform there and we will write we will close the curly brace and we will write the the keyword else and then we will open the braces and then i'll mention the operation or the function or the code that i have to perform and then i close the braces okay so this is the block body now i will go ahead and create a main function and outside the main function i will create a function named block body because there are three types in which i can determine the effects statements so i'll just go one by one so for block body so we will take an example of finding a maximum from a and b okay so we will have to give the input a integer and b integer and the output the written type of this would also be an end because it returns the maximum so moving forward so i'll write the blog body of fel's statement here so if a is greater than b okay then what happens is so i'll just create a variable also here that is called max value okay so when a is greater than b what happens is when a is greater than b the maximum value is a okay and else when so else b would be greater than a so the maximum value would be b and we would return the maximum value which is max value okay so when i go in the main function and call the a block body function and find try to find the maximum of 23 and 45 and run this function so it should be printing the so it should not print anything because i haven't mentioned the print function so when i mention the print function here also and run the function again so it should mention here 45 okay and it is correct so this might have give you this might have given you the basic understanding of the if else working okay so if a is greater than b then the max value should be equals to a and else if a is not greater than b else the max value should be equals to b okay so now i will go ahead and give you the idea of expression body so what is expression body so also in this i'll be printing the maximum of the two so i'll just mention the a and b integer and the return type as end now in the expression body i mentioned the value where the variable max value and give it a value of if so here only i start from f function so if a is greater than b then the max value is a and okay a and else the max value is b now we can see that okay i have to also return the max value so now now we can see that we have assigned we have defined a variable named max value that is equals to if a is greater than b that is equals to a and else that is equals to b so this is called the expression body so now if i replace the block body with the x pression body and run this again so it should be working fine and it should print 45 so yeah it is working fine so if if you see this type of code written anywhere it is also an if else statement now there is another type of fl statement that is a also short shorter than this and it is also called short so now i'll just mention a function short it will also be comparing two integers so i'll just initialize the function now it should be equals to no before that okay i should open it and i'll just return already return if a is greater than b if a is greater than b okay if a is greater than b then written a and else written b so now we can see that we have directly mentioned the written function and written a if a is greater than b and written b if a is not written in b so what it it it means that okay so instead of expression body when i mention short and i run this function around this code i can see that the answer is again 45 so in this video we have learned about the block body the expression body and the short of if else expression and we have a pretty thorough idea about the fl statement okay thank you
