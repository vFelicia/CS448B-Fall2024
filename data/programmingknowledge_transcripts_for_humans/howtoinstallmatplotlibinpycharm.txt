00:09 - project and I have written a very simple
00:12 - matte plot labor code here but you can
00:16 - see matplotlib package is not recognized
00:19 - on my pycharm IDE and also I am using
00:23 - numpy to help my matplotlib to show some
00:29 - data so this is also not recognized
00:32 - right so
00:35 - when I run this program I will see error
00:38 - and it's going to show no module name
00:41 - matplotlib so to solve this problem you
00:44 - can either hover over the mat plot lip
00:47 - which shows this red squiggly line and
00:50 - then click on install package matplotlib
00:54 - or you can click on more actions here

01:19 - this section which says project and the
01:23 - name of your project my project name is
01:25 - hello world that's why I can see Hello
01:28 - World here just expand this and click on
01:31 - python interpreter just choose the
01:34 - latest python interpreter from here in
01:36 - my case it's 3.10 and then click on this
01:39 - plus sign and then search for matplotlab
01:44 - here so I'm going to search
01:46 - matplotlib library and then press enter
01:49 - and you can see this matplotlib Library
01:52 - option appears here so I'm going to just
01:55 - select it
01:57 - from the right hand side I can see the
01:59 - description of this and it's from the
02:01 - official publisher I can even specify
02:04 - the version of matplotlib if I want to
02:07 - install the previous version of
02:10 - matplotlib but for now I'm going to just
02:13 - leave it as default
02:14 - I just need to click on install package
02:17 - here and then metal plot lib package
02:20 - will be installed on my pie charm
02:23 - project
02:24 - and now I can see this message and this
02:28 - green strip here which is package
02:31 - matplotlib installed successfully
02:33 - now because I am also using numpy so I'm
02:36 - going to just try and numpy here and
02:39 - then press enter and then select numpy
02:42 - from here
02:43 - and then install numpy also so just
02:46 - select numpy and then click on install
02:48 - package and it's going to install numpy
02:51 - also
02:52 - and I can see the message package numpy
02:54 - is installed successfully once you see
02:56 - this message close this window and you
02:59 - will be able to see the matplotlib
03:02 - package here and numpy package here mat
03:06 - plot lib depends on different other
03:09 - packages so you will see some more
03:11 - packages here in this list so don't
03:14 - worry just click on OK here and now you
03:18 - can run your matplot labor program so
03:21 - I'm going to run it and this time it's
03:24 - going to run successfully so you can see
03:27 - that my matplot Live program is running
03:30 - and showing this sine wave here so this
03:34 - is how you can install matplotlib on the
03:38 - pycharm IDE I hope you enjoyed this
03:40 - video and I will see you in the next
