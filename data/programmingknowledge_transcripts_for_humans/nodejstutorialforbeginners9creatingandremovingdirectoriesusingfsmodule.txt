00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - nodejs tutorial for beginners in the
00:04 - last video we have seen how we can use
00:07 - FS module to uh create file read from
00:11 - file and write to a file now in this
00:15 - video we will see uh some more
00:18 - functionality of FS module and we will
00:21 - see how we can delete a file and how we
00:24 - can create and remove directories in uh
00:28 - nodejs use using FS module so the first
00:33 - uh requirement is this one you need to
00:36 - uh you know require this module which is
00:38 - a inbuilt module right now first
00:41 - functionality or first thing we will see
00:43 - here is how we can remove uh file so in
00:48 - the last video I have created this test.
00:51 - txt file right and for example I want to
00:54 - remove this file so I can just write FS
00:58 - DOT UN link and then I can just give the
01:03 - path of the file with its name so my uh
01:07 - file is in the current directory so I
01:09 - don't need to give the path but I just
01:12 - need to give the name of the file which
01:14 - is test.txt
01:16 - right and when I run this uh app let's
01:22 - run it and what happens is this text.txt
01:28 - file is gone right so this uh unlink
01:32 - method you can use to remove a file but
01:35 - be careful here whenever you will uh you
01:39 - know run the code if the file doesn't
01:43 - exist then let's see what happens now
01:46 - this time it throws an error which uh
01:48 - will be uh due to the file not existing
01:53 - okay so in FS module you can also go to
01:57 - the documentation and check how you can
02:00 - first check for the file if it's exist
02:03 - or not and then delete it so this can be
02:06 - your homework just search for uh how to
02:09 - check if the file exist and then try to
02:12 - delete it okay now let's move ahead and
02:16 - let's see how we can uh first of all for
02:20 - example create a directory so to create
02:23 - a directory first we will see how we can
02:25 - create a directory synchronously so if
02:28 - you are a little bit familiar with
02:30 - command line uh uh you know terminal
02:34 - commands then you know how to you know
02:37 - create a directory so in terminal
02:40 - whenever you type
02:43 - mkdir then it's creates a directory
02:47 - right and in node also whenever you uh
02:51 - just call a method called mkd after fs
02:56 - and then give the name of uh the
02:58 - directory for example the name of the
03:01 - directory I want to give here is for
03:03 - example node itself okay so node
03:06 - directory I want to create and here I
03:09 - want to create it synchronously so don't
03:12 - forget to write Sync here right and save
03:16 - your code and I'm going to run my code
03:20 - again and let's see what happens so I
03:22 - just run my code and you can see there
03:25 - is a new uh directory created which is
03:29 - called no mode right now in order to
03:32 - remove a directory you just need to
03:34 - replace MK by RM so
03:39 - rmdir is going to remove uh the
03:42 - directory so synchronously for
03:45 - synchronous uh removal you just need to
03:47 - add this uh suffix like Sy YN C sync
03:53 - right and save the code run it again and
03:58 - just see here the directory will be
04:01 - removed so this directory is removed
04:04 - right now in order to create a file
04:08 - asynchronously what we can do here is uh
04:12 - for example instead of using uh this
04:17 - sync we can just write something like
04:19 - this so fs.
04:22 - mkd and then the name of the directory
04:26 - once again for example node and then you
04:30 - can uh create a call back function here
04:33 - so I'm just going to write function and
04:38 - then inside the Callback function I can
04:42 - do whatever I want to do after the
04:44 - directory is created right so for
04:47 - example I want to create uh a file after
04:53 - I have created a directory something
04:55 - like this okay so inside my call back
04:58 - function what I can do is I can just
05:00 - write FS
05:03 - dot write file right with a capital f
05:09 - and the name of the file so for example
05:12 - I want to create this file inside my new
05:14 - directory which is created which is node
05:17 - now in order to uh you know create this
05:21 - file inside this node directory you just
05:23 - need to write dot slash to indicate that
05:26 - you need to go inside this uh node
05:29 - directory and then the name of the file
05:32 - for example my
05:35 - node. txt okay so this will be the name
05:40 - of the directory and for example you
05:43 - want to write something I'm going to
05:44 - just uh write random text here and this
05:48 - is going to uh you know write this text
05:51 - to this file for example right so just
05:55 - save your code and run it again and
05:59 - let's see what happens
06:01 - so run the code the directory is created
06:05 - inside the directory the file is created
06:08 - and inside the file this random text
06:10 - comes okay so this is uh how you can uh
06:16 - make a directory now let's just say that
06:18 - you want to delete this directory once
06:20 - again which also have some file inside
06:24 - it so I'm going to just remove it and I
06:26 - will just write
06:27 - fs. RM diir and the name of the
06:31 - directory so the name of the directory
06:34 - is node right and if you do this it's
06:38 - not going to uh delete this directory
06:41 - because we already have some file inside
06:44 - it so whenever we run this code what it
06:48 - gives is it gives the error because you
06:50 - cannot remove a directory if it
06:53 - contrains our file inside it so what we
06:56 - will do here is we will first remove
06:59 - remove the file and then remove a
07:01 - directory and this is very simple we
07:04 - have already seen it so just write FS
07:07 - dot
07:10 - unlink and then you just uh need to give
07:14 - the path of the file you want to remove
07:17 - so this is because it's in a node uh
07:20 - folder so you will just write dot SL
07:24 - node and then you just need to give the
07:27 - name of the file so the file name is my
07:31 - node. txt and then we can add a call
07:35 - back function here so just add a call
07:38 - back
07:39 - function and inside a call back function
07:43 - once this file is remove we want to
07:46 - remove the directory right so you inside
07:49 - the call back function you can call a
07:51 - method to uh you know remove the
07:54 - directory right and just save your code
07:57 - and let's run it again and let's see
07:59 - what happens so I'm going to just run my
08:02 - code again and you can see the file is
08:06 - deleted first and once the file is
08:08 - deleted this call back function is
08:11 - called and then the directory is removed
08:14 - okay so in this way you can uh use FS
08:18 - module to create directories and remove
08:21 - directories and remove files also so I
08:24 - hope you have enjoyed this video please

hello guys welcome to the next video on nodejs tutorial for beginners in the last video we have seen how we can use FS module to uh create file read from file and write to a file now in this video we will see uh some more functionality of FS module and we will see how we can delete a file and how we can create and remove directories in uh nodejs use using FS module so the first uh requirement is this one you need to uh you know require this module which is a inbuilt module right now first functionality or first thing we will see here is how we can remove uh file so in the last video I have created this test. txt file right and for example I want to remove this file so I can just write FS DOT UN link and then I can just give the path of the file with its name so my uh file is in the current directory so I don't need to give the path but I just need to give the name of the file which is test.txt right and when I run this uh app let's run it and what happens is this text.txt file is gone right so this uh unlink method you can use to remove a file but be careful here whenever you will uh you know run the code if the file doesn't exist then let's see what happens now this time it throws an error which uh will be uh due to the file not existing okay so in FS module you can also go to the documentation and check how you can first check for the file if it's exist or not and then delete it so this can be your homework just search for uh how to check if the file exist and then try to delete it okay now let's move ahead and let's see how we can uh first of all for example create a directory so to create a directory first we will see how we can create a directory synchronously so if you are a little bit familiar with command line uh uh you know terminal commands then you know how to you know create a directory so in terminal whenever you type mkdir then it's creates a directory right and in node also whenever you uh just call a method called mkd after fs and then give the name of uh the directory for example the name of the directory I want to give here is for example node itself okay so node directory I want to create and here I want to create it synchronously so don't forget to write Sync here right and save your code and I'm going to run my code again and let's see what happens so I just run my code and you can see there is a new uh directory created which is called no mode right now in order to remove a directory you just need to replace MK by RM so rmdir is going to remove uh the directory so synchronously for synchronous uh removal you just need to add this uh suffix like Sy YN C sync right and save the code run it again and just see here the directory will be removed so this directory is removed right now in order to create a file asynchronously what we can do here is uh for example instead of using uh this sync we can just write something like this so fs. mkd and then the name of the directory once again for example node and then you can uh create a call back function here so I'm just going to write function and then inside the Callback function I can do whatever I want to do after the directory is created right so for example I want to create uh a file after I have created a directory something like this okay so inside my call back function what I can do is I can just write FS dot write file right with a capital f and the name of the file so for example I want to create this file inside my new directory which is created which is node now in order to uh you know create this file inside this node directory you just need to write dot slash to indicate that you need to go inside this uh node directory and then the name of the file for example my node. txt okay so this will be the name of the directory and for example you want to write something I'm going to just uh write random text here and this is going to uh you know write this text to this file for example right so just save your code and run it again and let's see what happens so run the code the directory is created inside the directory the file is created and inside the file this random text comes okay so this is uh how you can uh make a directory now let's just say that you want to delete this directory once again which also have some file inside it so I'm going to just remove it and I will just write fs. RM diir and the name of the directory so the name of the directory is node right and if you do this it's not going to uh delete this directory because we already have some file inside it so whenever we run this code what it gives is it gives the error because you cannot remove a directory if it contrains our file inside it so what we will do here is we will first remove remove the file and then remove a directory and this is very simple we have already seen it so just write FS dot unlink and then you just uh need to give the path of the file you want to remove so this is because it's in a node uh folder so you will just write dot SL node and then you just need to give the name of the file so the file name is my node. txt and then we can add a call back function here so just add a call back function and inside a call back function once this file is remove we want to remove the directory right so you inside the call back function you can call a method to uh you know remove the directory right and just save your code and let's run it again and let's see what happens so I'm going to just run my code again and you can see the file is deleted first and once the file is deleted this call back function is called and then the directory is removed okay so in this way you can uh use FS module to create directories and remove directories and remove files also so I hope you have enjoyed this video please RIT comment subscribe and bye for now
