00:00 - hello friends welcome to programming
00:02 - knowledge in this video we will see how
00:05 - to use left left join is basically like
00:12 - inherent but if we want to fetch the
00:16 - data from the left and left in
00:18 - Centreville and we want all the records
00:20 - present in left hand side table then in
00:22 - that case we will use left right so just
00:27 - open terminal password show databases
00:46 - here we have data test data Pantheon we
00:49 - just use that
00:58 - we have department table and a printer
01:03 - let me first show you which are the
01:06 - records present in a Chloe table so it
01:16 - has three columns ID name and department
01:21 - ID now select star from the body it has
01:29 - only two columns Department ID and
01:32 - Department the name Department ID from
01:38 - the department so I write department dot
01:43 - dividing from employees now I want all
01:56 - the records from the employee table as
01:59 - you can see department ID three and four
02:04 - are not present in department table
02:07 - so when B is inner join it will not show
02:10 - these two rows but I want these two rows
02:15 - no matter if whether match or not so I
02:19 - right left because employ table is
02:22 - specified left hand side of the join
02:26 - keyword now the name of the another
02:31 - table departure now let me specify the
02:36 - relationship between two tables in this
02:39 - scenario department ID is common between
02:42 - two dollars so we write employee dot d
02:52 - PI D is equal to Department dot d
02:59 - fighting
03:03 - as you can see we have the matching
03:06 - records which has one and two department
03:09 - ID as well as we have all the records
03:11 - from the electron's a table as you can
03:14 - see IDM name our first from the employee
03:17 - table and wherever it will not find a
03:22 - match it put none
03:29 - you can also specify where or like
03:32 - conditioning that just closed please now
03:37 - open MySQL workbench
03:47 - so here you can see we already have the
03:51 - query and if we execute it then let me
04:00 - just remove this severe condition as you
04:06 - can see whenever we use inner join which
04:17 - are mating from the positive now as we
04:23 - can see it will gives us records which
04:28 - are present in the left table and we
04:30 - have all the records here now I want
04:34 - only Department 2 then we can specify
04:39 - where Department dot d PI D is equal to
04:49 - 2 and it will show us the employees
04:55 - which belongs to department or which is
04:57 - a chart so this is how you can do
05:01 - lecture thanks for watching
