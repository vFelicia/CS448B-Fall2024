00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to the
00:02 - altrex tutorials in this video we are
00:04 - going to discuss about some more
00:07 - uh tools that are present in the data
00:09 - preparation group in excel
00:11 - uh in altrix so the first tool that we
00:13 - are going to look in this is the formula
00:16 - tool
00:16 - so the formula tool is actually used to
00:19 - create new columns uh update the columns
00:22 - or
00:23 - use the expressions to perform a variety
00:26 - of the calculations on the already
00:28 - existing values
00:30 - that are present in the columns okay so
00:35 - we can use it to apply conditional
00:36 - statements convert uh the data type from
00:40 - one to another format the dates extract
00:42 - file paths apply algorithms clean the
00:45 - data apply the
00:47 - validations or
00:49 - perform the tests etc okay so let us see
00:52 - how are we going to use this formula
00:54 - tool
00:56 - so right now i have got the
00:58 - same data set that is the consumer sheet
01:01 - from the sample store data set okay
01:05 - and i have cleansed it
01:07 - that is removed the inconsistencies now
01:09 - let's just bring up our formula tool to
01:12 - here
01:14 - and in this what i'm going to do is in
01:16 - the configuration panel i have two
01:18 - options either i can just select a
01:20 - column and that data would be
01:23 - overwritten or i can add a new column so
01:25 - what i'm going to do is i'm actually i'm
01:27 - going to add a new column so add a
01:29 - column
01:30 - and then you go to specify the name of
01:32 - the column so that's going to be
01:36 - profit
01:37 - slash
01:38 - loss okay
01:40 - and here what i am going to do is apply
01:42 - a conditional statement
01:44 - that
01:46 - uh
01:48 - this conditional statement
01:51 - if the value of the profit so for
01:54 - getting the column names we can simply
01:56 - just use a square bracket
01:58 - so we have the profit value over here
02:02 - if the profit value is greater than
02:05 - equals to 0
02:06 - then the value in this column is going
02:09 - to be profit
02:12 - else it is going to be
02:14 - loss okay
02:16 - like this and whatever the tax for value
02:18 - you want you need to just write it in
02:20 - the single quotes okay
02:22 - so the size we can just specify over
02:25 - here it's going to be the data type you
02:28 - can check is
02:30 - going to be the variable string
02:32 - and click on run
02:36 - now it's going to take a few seconds 1.6
02:39 - seconds to be precise
02:40 - and as you can see
02:42 - uh we should be getting
02:45 - a new column over here
02:50 - and here on the very last uh
02:52 - you can see the column profit and loss
02:55 - if the values are positive then we are
02:57 - getting the value profit if it is
02:59 - negative then we are getting the value
03:01 - loss okay
03:03 - uh so here is a warning in the profit
03:05 - that uh
03:06 - the there was a large value over here
03:08 - but it has been rounded up by alteryx
03:10 - for clarity okay so that's why the
03:13 - red
03:15 - is being shown over here the red mark
03:17 - has been shown over here so this is one
03:19 - way of using the formula tool right
03:21 - um
03:22 - just like this you can actually make
03:25 - changes into the existing data like um
03:30 - right now if you just don't want to add
03:32 - an extra column so we want to apply
03:34 - another formula
03:36 - and the thing is that i want to get
03:40 - the profit and the loss the same thing
03:43 - but in this column only that is the
03:45 - value that is showing me profit in that
03:47 - value only i want this to happen so i
03:50 - can just select the column
03:51 - and here i am just going to select the
03:53 - profit column okay
03:55 - now if i just click on run then what
03:57 - would happen is the values in that
03:59 - particular column would be overwritten
04:03 - okay so there is an error
04:06 - uh the thing is that
04:08 - we wanted string value but the field is
04:10 - numeric so that's why it's not happening
04:12 - so let me just change it a little bit
04:15 - that is
04:17 - over here
04:19 - if there is a profit then i want 100 to
04:22 - be written over there
04:24 - else i want 0 to be written over here
04:27 - okay or i can just actually you know
04:32 - change its data type as well like it's
04:35 - double so 100 and 0 would be okay
04:37 - let's click on run
04:41 - now if you just go to this output panel
04:45 - and here we have only two values hundred
04:47 - and zero hundred and zero so this is how
04:49 - you can actually update the existing
04:51 - values or create a new column
04:53 - now in case you want to remove any
04:55 - formula you can just go to that formula
04:57 - and here is this delete button you can
04:59 - just delete that
05:00 - and now if you again run it then the
05:03 - changes that were made initially would
05:05 - be overwritten and you would be getting
05:07 - the original values of the profit that
05:09 - were present in the column so this is
05:12 - how we work with the formula tool
05:14 - to either add new columns or update the
05:17 - existing columns right
05:19 - next tool that we are going to talk
05:20 - about is the sample tool so let's just
05:23 - go to the sample tool
05:24 - now what is the sample tool it is used
05:27 - to limit the data stream to a specified
05:29 - number percentage or a random set of
05:31 - rows
05:32 - uh also if you want a selected
05:34 - configuration to the columns so
05:38 - to be applied you can group the columns
05:40 - using the sample tool so let's just get
05:42 - the sample tool
05:43 - over here
05:45 - and as soon as we get it this is the
05:46 - configuration panel that we are getting
05:48 - the first option is the first n rows
05:51 - uh it returns every row in the data from
05:54 - the beginning to the data through the
05:55 - value of n
05:56 - like you can specify a value of n here
05:58 - you can see
05:59 - right now if you just run it so it would
06:02 - return the first 100 rows as you can see
06:04 - first 100 is being shown over here
06:05 - because the value of n was 100 but if we
06:08 - just set it to 10
06:10 - and then run it so what will it do is it
06:13 - would just show you the first 10 rows
06:16 - okay so you can set the value of n
06:19 - next option is last and rules which of
06:21 - course is used
06:22 - to show us the last
06:24 - n rows the value of n which you can
06:26 - specify
06:28 - as per your wish
06:29 - next is skip first n rows which returns
06:33 - all the rows in the data that start
06:36 - after the specified number of rows
06:38 - next we have one of every n rows that
06:41 - means return the first row of every
06:43 - group of n rows like if i just select n
06:46 - so the whole record would be
06:49 - uh split into groups of 10 and the first
06:52 - row in each group would be returned to
06:54 - me so if you just run it
06:58 - then we would be able to see the changes
07:00 - like through this row id like 1 then 12
07:04 - then 26 then 48 this is how the rows are
07:07 - being returned to me okay
07:09 - next is one in chan one in n chance to
07:12 - include each row
07:14 - that means it would return randomly it
07:17 - would randomly determine if each row is
07:19 - included in the sample or not so the
07:22 - random values are being
07:24 - uh returned to me as you can see from
07:26 - the row id itself 11 20 then 21 randomly
07:29 - the rows are being
07:31 - returned to me
07:32 - okay
07:34 - so um
07:36 - then we have the first n percent of rows
07:39 - that means it returns the n percent in
07:41 - this case the 10 percent of rows it
07:45 - requires the data to pass through the
07:46 - tool twice like once we calculate the
07:49 - count of rows and then to return the
07:51 - specified percent of rows
07:53 - okay then we can just run it to get the
07:55 - n percent of rows that's the 10 percent
07:57 - of the rows or of the total values okay
08:00 - so there were around 5000 uh
08:03 - 191 records so 519 records that's the 10
08:06 - of the records have been displayed over
08:08 - here okay
08:09 - next we have is the group by option so
08:11 - if you want to group it on the basis of
08:13 - some column that you can do let's just
08:15 - group it by category
08:18 - and
08:20 - just get the first 10 rows to be grouped
08:22 - by category we can click on run
08:25 - so this is what we would be getting
08:27 - in the output
08:30 - okay
08:32 - so furniture categories then the office
08:34 - supplies categories and the technology
08:35 - categories have been used to group by
08:37 - the values
08:38 - so this is how the sample tool works for
08:41 - us
08:44 - next we have is the
08:46 - sort tool
08:48 - so the sort tool is actually
08:51 - very important and as the name suggests
08:53 - it is used to sort the data
08:55 - so um
08:57 - let's see how it works it actually takes
09:00 - two
09:01 - things into consideration let's just get
09:03 - the sort tool over here
09:05 - it takes two things into consideration
09:07 - the name and the order so basically
09:10 - uh any of the
09:12 - name
09:13 - of the field that you want to sort and
09:15 - in which order you want to sort if in
09:17 - the ascending order of in the descending
09:18 - order okay
09:20 - so let's just uh delete this tool once
09:23 - and let's see how we manually apply it
09:24 - like without using this tool okay so now
09:27 - if we just run this
09:29 - we would be getting our hands on the
09:31 - data set
09:34 - okay
09:37 - yeah so if you want to sort the values
09:39 - like i want to sort it on the basis of
09:41 - the sales so let's just go to the sales
09:43 - column
09:44 - or click on these three dots go to sort
09:47 - and i want to sort it on the base of the
09:49 - ascending order then click on apply
09:52 - so once we do that we can click on this
09:54 - red
09:55 - this green tick button
09:57 - and you would see that it has been
09:59 - applied if you just click on the output
10:02 - actually run the workflow
10:06 - so here is what we would be getting the
10:08 - sorted values
10:10 - like you can see the value have been
10:11 - sorted on the basis of the sales the
10:13 - ascending order the sort tool has
10:16 - already been applied and the name is
10:17 - taken as sales and the order is taken as
10:19 - ascending so this is the usage of the
10:21 - soft tool that's all for this video
10:23 - thanks for watching

hello everyone welcome back to the altrex tutorials in this video we are going to discuss about some more uh tools that are present in the data preparation group in excel uh in altrix so the first tool that we are going to look in this is the formula tool so the formula tool is actually used to create new columns uh update the columns or use the expressions to perform a variety of the calculations on the already existing values that are present in the columns okay so we can use it to apply conditional statements convert uh the data type from one to another format the dates extract file paths apply algorithms clean the data apply the validations or perform the tests etc okay so let us see how are we going to use this formula tool so right now i have got the same data set that is the consumer sheet from the sample store data set okay and i have cleansed it that is removed the inconsistencies now let's just bring up our formula tool to here and in this what i'm going to do is in the configuration panel i have two options either i can just select a column and that data would be overwritten or i can add a new column so what i'm going to do is i'm actually i'm going to add a new column so add a column and then you go to specify the name of the column so that's going to be profit slash loss okay and here what i am going to do is apply a conditional statement that uh this conditional statement if the value of the profit so for getting the column names we can simply just use a square bracket so we have the profit value over here if the profit value is greater than equals to 0 then the value in this column is going to be profit else it is going to be loss okay like this and whatever the tax for value you want you need to just write it in the single quotes okay so the size we can just specify over here it's going to be the data type you can check is going to be the variable string and click on run now it's going to take a few seconds 1.6 seconds to be precise and as you can see uh we should be getting a new column over here and here on the very last uh you can see the column profit and loss if the values are positive then we are getting the value profit if it is negative then we are getting the value loss okay uh so here is a warning in the profit that uh the there was a large value over here but it has been rounded up by alteryx for clarity okay so that's why the red is being shown over here the red mark has been shown over here so this is one way of using the formula tool right um just like this you can actually make changes into the existing data like um right now if you just don't want to add an extra column so we want to apply another formula and the thing is that i want to get the profit and the loss the same thing but in this column only that is the value that is showing me profit in that value only i want this to happen so i can just select the column and here i am just going to select the profit column okay now if i just click on run then what would happen is the values in that particular column would be overwritten okay so there is an error uh the thing is that we wanted string value but the field is numeric so that's why it's not happening so let me just change it a little bit that is over here if there is a profit then i want 100 to be written over there else i want 0 to be written over here okay or i can just actually you know change its data type as well like it's double so 100 and 0 would be okay let's click on run now if you just go to this output panel and here we have only two values hundred and zero hundred and zero so this is how you can actually update the existing values or create a new column now in case you want to remove any formula you can just go to that formula and here is this delete button you can just delete that and now if you again run it then the changes that were made initially would be overwritten and you would be getting the original values of the profit that were present in the column so this is how we work with the formula tool to either add new columns or update the existing columns right next tool that we are going to talk about is the sample tool so let's just go to the sample tool now what is the sample tool it is used to limit the data stream to a specified number percentage or a random set of rows uh also if you want a selected configuration to the columns so to be applied you can group the columns using the sample tool so let's just get the sample tool over here and as soon as we get it this is the configuration panel that we are getting the first option is the first n rows uh it returns every row in the data from the beginning to the data through the value of n like you can specify a value of n here you can see right now if you just run it so it would return the first 100 rows as you can see first 100 is being shown over here because the value of n was 100 but if we just set it to 10 and then run it so what will it do is it would just show you the first 10 rows okay so you can set the value of n next option is last and rules which of course is used to show us the last n rows the value of n which you can specify as per your wish next is skip first n rows which returns all the rows in the data that start after the specified number of rows next we have one of every n rows that means return the first row of every group of n rows like if i just select n so the whole record would be uh split into groups of 10 and the first row in each group would be returned to me so if you just run it then we would be able to see the changes like through this row id like 1 then 12 then 26 then 48 this is how the rows are being returned to me okay next is one in chan one in n chance to include each row that means it would return randomly it would randomly determine if each row is included in the sample or not so the random values are being uh returned to me as you can see from the row id itself 11 20 then 21 randomly the rows are being returned to me okay so um then we have the first n percent of rows that means it returns the n percent in this case the 10 percent of rows it requires the data to pass through the tool twice like once we calculate the count of rows and then to return the specified percent of rows okay then we can just run it to get the n percent of rows that's the 10 percent of the rows or of the total values okay so there were around 5000 uh 191 records so 519 records that's the 10 of the records have been displayed over here okay next we have is the group by option so if you want to group it on the basis of some column that you can do let's just group it by category and just get the first 10 rows to be grouped by category we can click on run so this is what we would be getting in the output okay so furniture categories then the office supplies categories and the technology categories have been used to group by the values so this is how the sample tool works for us next we have is the sort tool so the sort tool is actually very important and as the name suggests it is used to sort the data so um let's see how it works it actually takes two things into consideration let's just get the sort tool over here it takes two things into consideration the name and the order so basically uh any of the name of the field that you want to sort and in which order you want to sort if in the ascending order of in the descending order okay so let's just uh delete this tool once and let's see how we manually apply it like without using this tool okay so now if we just run this we would be getting our hands on the data set okay yeah so if you want to sort the values like i want to sort it on the basis of the sales so let's just go to the sales column or click on these three dots go to sort and i want to sort it on the base of the ascending order then click on apply so once we do that we can click on this red this green tick button and you would see that it has been applied if you just click on the output actually run the workflow so here is what we would be getting the sorted values like you can see the value have been sorted on the basis of the sales the ascending order the sort tool has already been applied and the name is taken as sales and the order is taken as ascending so this is the usage of the soft tool that's all for this video thanks for watching
