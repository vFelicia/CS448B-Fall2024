00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video
00:02 - tutorial on Android app development for
00:04 - beginners and in this video we will see
00:06 - how to use time picker dialogue in
00:09 - Android in the last video we have seen
00:12 - how to use time picker in Android and
00:15 - the main issue you can say with time
00:18 - picker is that it occupies uh large
00:22 - space in Android
00:24 - activity and time picker dialogue you
00:26 - can use when you want to utilize your
00:30 - activity space and this time picker
00:33 - dialogue can pop up when some button is
00:37 - pressed so you can uh you know
00:40 - efficiently utilize the space inside the
00:43 - activity so let's see how we can use
00:46 - time picker dialogue in Android so first
00:50 - of all what I'm going to do is I'm going
00:52 - to take a
00:54 - button and I will change the text of
00:56 - this button
00:58 - as show
01:03 - time picker
01:08 - dialogue okay and we just need this uh
01:12 - button in order to uh open the time
01:15 - picker dialogue so we will directly go
01:18 - to the main activity. Java file so just
01:21 - go to your Java folder and open your
01:24 - main activity. Java and in here we will
01:27 - write the code for time picker dialogue
01:29 - so first first of all uh let's create
01:32 - the object for button
01:36 - so
01:39 - button
01:41 - button
01:44 - stpd for show time picker dialogue right
01:48 - and we will also create three
01:52 - variables for minute hour and dialogue
01:57 - ID okay so let's cre create those three
02:01 - variables first will be the dialogue ID
02:05 - which is an integer so let's create
02:10 - it
02:12 - static final
02:18 - int
02:20 - dialogue ID and I can initialize it with
02:25 - zero and now we are going to declare two
02:28 - variable which will be holding the hour
02:32 - and minute for us using time picker
02:36 - right so
02:39 - int
02:41 - hour and
02:46 - int minute for
02:48 - example and let's uh add some other text
02:53 - to minutes for example minute
02:58 - X and and our X so that it can be you
03:04 - know identified as user defined
03:07 - variables okay so once we have created
03:11 - these three
03:12 - variables what we can do is we can
03:15 - create a method in which we can call uh
03:19 - this button click event and inside this
03:22 - button click event we can call our show
03:25 - dialogue method to show this time picker
03:29 - okay so let's create
03:33 - a public method public
03:36 - void
03:38 - show
03:41 - time
03:44 - picker dialogue for example and this is
03:47 - a user defined method which we are
03:49 - creating and in here we are going to uh
03:52 - cast our button okay so
03:56 - button is equal to
04:05 - button find view by ID R do ID
04:12 - dot
04:15 - button now once you have casted your
04:18 - button you can use this button object to
04:21 - call set on click method okay so set on
04:26 - click listener on the button object
04:30 - and inside the Set onclick uh method we
04:33 - can use
04:35 - new onclick listener okay and once you
04:40 - call this new onclick listener inside
04:43 - this onclick method you can call a
04:46 - method called show dialogue and this
04:51 - method you can use to pop up the
04:56 - dialogue okay and the dialogue type we
04:59 - can Define it later but uh what we are
05:02 - going to do is we will pass this
05:04 - dialogue ID in here in show dialog okay
05:10 - now what we are going to do is we are
05:12 - going to call a inbuilt method like on
05:15 - create method there is a method called
05:18 - oncreate dialogue similar to this
05:21 - oncreate method which is a buildin
05:24 - method right so you can even copy this
05:28 - much amount of code from here and what
05:31 - we are going to do is Let's uh create
05:34 - this method Above This Showtime pick a
05:38 - dialogue okay so let's create this
05:41 - method here or you can create uh below
05:45 - your show time picker dialogue method
05:47 - which we have created so just uh create
05:51 - a method which is
05:53 - overriding uh protected void on create
05:58 - dialogue okay okay so create this
06:04 - method and this will take one argument
06:08 - which will be ID okay and now what you
06:14 - can do is uh let's return a dialogue uh
06:18 - using this method so in here just return
06:22 - a dialogue okay because we want to show
06:26 - the dialogue so we will return the
06:29 - dialogue using this method now what we
06:32 - are going to do is we will compare the
06:35 - ID which is passed uh as an argument to
06:39 - the dialogue ID we which we have
06:41 - declared above right so
06:46 - if this
06:48 - ID is equal to the dialogue ID which we
06:52 - have declared which is this one then
06:56 - what we are going to do is we are going
06:57 - to return
07:02 - return
07:04 - new time picker
07:07 - dialogue okay and this
07:10 - takes you can see this takes uh 1 2 3
07:16 - four four or five arguments you can see
07:19 - it here first is the context context can
07:23 - be your class in which you are working
07:26 - so main activity dot this this and
07:31 - second argument is the time dialogue so
07:35 - this uh for example right now we create
07:39 - uh um variable which we are going to
07:42 - Define later okay so
07:48 - time
07:52 - picker listner for example okay third
07:56 - argument you can pass our
08:02 - which we have
08:03 - defined and minute is the fourth
08:07 - argument minute X and hour x these two
08:11 - variables we have defined above right
08:13 - like here right so these uh two
08:16 - variables we will pass as third and
08:20 - fourth arguments and the last argument
08:24 - and the fifth argument it takes
08:26 - is what format of you know dialogue time
08:30 - picker dialogue you want to show is it
08:33 - uh 24hour format or 12h hour format and
08:37 - by default uh it asks for the 24 hours
08:41 - which we don't want so I will set it
08:48 - false okay so once you have uh done now
08:53 - by default if this condition is not fil
08:56 - fulfilled what we are going to do is we
08:58 - are going to
09:00 - return by default null if this condition
09:03 - is not fulfilled okay in any other
09:06 - condition we are going to return false
09:09 - okay now let's create this time picker
09:13 - listener variable okay so what we are
09:17 - going to do
09:19 - is we are going to declare this uh
09:22 - variable so let's uh declare it it will
09:25 - be
09:26 - protected and let's create some space
09:29 - here and it will
09:31 - be time picker
09:35 - dialogue
09:37 - dot on time set
09:40 - listener and the name of the variable is
09:45 - this one which we are going to declare
09:48 - is equal to
09:51 - new time set listener okay so on time
09:55 - set listener okay so what we have done
09:59 - we have declared a protected uh variable
10:03 - which is time picker dialog. ontime set
10:07 - listener and we have declared the same
10:10 - variable which we have passed here is
10:12 - equal to new time picker dialogue. on
10:17 - time set listener and it will be created
10:21 - automatically and don't forget to close
10:24 - this by samiul and in here inside this
10:27 - on time set method first of all what we
10:31 - are going to do is we are going to uh
10:34 - set the values of hour and minute so
10:38 - just copy your our variables which we
10:43 - have declared above in here in on time
10:46 - set method is equal to you can see here
10:51 - it takes two arguments one is hour of
10:54 - day which represents the hour of day as
10:58 - the n name suggest and second
11:02 - variable we can assign to this minute
11:07 - underscore X variable which we have
11:09 - declared is equal to minute here okay
11:14 - which is the third argument here okay
11:18 - now once we have assigned these two
11:20 - variables we can uh call these uh you
11:25 - know variables using for example toast
11:28 - to so we can show what's the value
11:30 - inside these two variables toast dot
11:34 - make text and the context you can take
11:39 - this context once
11:41 - again comma
11:44 - the the text you want to show so for
11:47 - example we want to show first of all our
11:51 - plus and
11:53 - then colon minute
11:56 - value okay plus minute and the third
12:01 - variable is the duration so
12:06 - toast dot length short and then we will
12:12 - show our dialogue okay now don't forget
12:17 - to call this
12:19 - Showtime picker dialogue method which we
12:22 - have created by ourself so just copy
12:26 - this Showtime picker dialogue method
12:28 - which we have created and call it inside
12:32 - your on create method okay so copy and
12:36 - paste it here okay now everything is
12:39 - done so we are going to run our program
12:42 - so now our app is running and you can
12:45 - see this button and whenever we click

hello guys welcome to the next video tutorial on Android app development for beginners and in this video we will see how to use time picker dialogue in Android in the last video we have seen how to use time picker in Android and the main issue you can say with time picker is that it occupies uh large space in Android activity and time picker dialogue you can use when you want to utilize your activity space and this time picker dialogue can pop up when some button is pressed so you can uh you know efficiently utilize the space inside the activity so let's see how we can use time picker dialogue in Android so first of all what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a button and I will change the text of this button as show time picker dialogue okay and we just need this uh button in order to uh open the time picker dialogue so we will directly go to the main activity. Java file so just go to your Java folder and open your main activity. Java and in here we will write the code for time picker dialogue so first first of all uh let's create the object for button so button button stpd for show time picker dialogue right and we will also create three variables for minute hour and dialogue ID okay so let's cre create those three variables first will be the dialogue ID which is an integer so let's create it static final int dialogue ID and I can initialize it with zero and now we are going to declare two variable which will be holding the hour and minute for us using time picker right so int hour and int minute for example and let's uh add some other text to minutes for example minute X and and our X so that it can be you know identified as user defined variables okay so once we have created these three variables what we can do is we can create a method in which we can call uh this button click event and inside this button click event we can call our show dialogue method to show this time picker okay so let's create a public method public void show time picker dialogue for example and this is a user defined method which we are creating and in here we are going to uh cast our button okay so button is equal to button find view by ID R do ID dot button now once you have casted your button you can use this button object to call set on click method okay so set on click listener on the button object and inside the Set onclick uh method we can use new onclick listener okay and once you call this new onclick listener inside this onclick method you can call a method called show dialogue and this method you can use to pop up the dialogue okay and the dialogue type we can Define it later but uh what we are going to do is we will pass this dialogue ID in here in show dialog okay now what we are going to do is we are going to call a inbuilt method like on create method there is a method called oncreate dialogue similar to this oncreate method which is a buildin method right so you can even copy this much amount of code from here and what we are going to do is Let's uh create this method Above This Showtime pick a dialogue okay so let's create this method here or you can create uh below your show time picker dialogue method which we have created so just uh create a method which is overriding uh protected void on create dialogue okay okay so create this method and this will take one argument which will be ID okay and now what you can do is uh let's return a dialogue uh using this method so in here just return a dialogue okay because we want to show the dialogue so we will return the dialogue using this method now what we are going to do is we will compare the ID which is passed uh as an argument to the dialogue ID we which we have declared above right so if this ID is equal to the dialogue ID which we have declared which is this one then what we are going to do is we are going to return return new time picker dialogue okay and this takes you can see this takes uh 1 2 3 four four or five arguments you can see it here first is the context context can be your class in which you are working so main activity dot this this and second argument is the time dialogue so this uh for example right now we create uh um variable which we are going to Define later okay so time picker listner for example okay third argument you can pass our which we have defined and minute is the fourth argument minute X and hour x these two variables we have defined above right like here right so these uh two variables we will pass as third and fourth arguments and the last argument and the fifth argument it takes is what format of you know dialogue time picker dialogue you want to show is it uh 24hour format or 12h hour format and by default uh it asks for the 24 hours which we don't want so I will set it false okay so once you have uh done now by default if this condition is not fil fulfilled what we are going to do is we are going to return by default null if this condition is not fulfilled okay in any other condition we are going to return false okay now let's create this time picker listener variable okay so what we are going to do is we are going to declare this uh variable so let's uh declare it it will be protected and let's create some space here and it will be time picker dialogue dot on time set listener and the name of the variable is this one which we are going to declare is equal to new time set listener okay so on time set listener okay so what we have done we have declared a protected uh variable which is time picker dialog. ontime set listener and we have declared the same variable which we have passed here is equal to new time picker dialogue. on time set listener and it will be created automatically and don't forget to close this by samiul and in here inside this on time set method first of all what we are going to do is we are going to uh set the values of hour and minute so just copy your our variables which we have declared above in here in on time set method is equal to you can see here it takes two arguments one is hour of day which represents the hour of day as the n name suggest and second variable we can assign to this minute underscore X variable which we have declared is equal to minute here okay which is the third argument here okay now once we have assigned these two variables we can uh call these uh you know variables using for example toast to so we can show what's the value inside these two variables toast dot make text and the context you can take this context once again comma the the text you want to show so for example we want to show first of all our plus and then colon minute value okay plus minute and the third variable is the duration so toast dot length short and then we will show our dialogue okay now don't forget to call this Showtime picker dialogue method which we have created by ourself so just copy this Showtime picker dialogue method which we have created and call it inside your on create method okay so copy and paste it here okay now everything is done so we are going to run our program so now our app is running and you can see this button and whenever we click this show time picker dialogue button so I'm going to click this button Showtime picker it's going to uh you know show you this time pick a dialogue okay and you can uh set the time whatever you want so hours and for example 4 hour 30 minute and I'm going to change time time to pm and when I click okay here you can see the time 1630 okay so in this way you can use uh time picker dialogue in an in your Android
