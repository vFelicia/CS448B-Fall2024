00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - MongoDB database tutorial for beginners
00:04 - in this video we will see how we can
00:06 - restore and backup data in MongoDB so
00:11 - what I have done is I have opened a
00:13 - command prompt and I have run this
00:16 - command D in a command prompt
00:19 - right now next what I have done is I
00:22 - have opened the bin folder of MongoDB
00:26 - where my dn exe and other
00:30 - executable files are here so what I'm
00:33 - going to do next is I'm going to open
00:36 - our next command prompt and in here I'm
00:39 - going to run command so just give
00:42 - one go and press ENTER and we have the
00:45 -  shell now the next thing I want to
00:49 - do here is I want to once again open the
00:53 - command prompt but this time I want to
00:55 - open it with the administrative usage so
00:59 - just open command prompt with admin
01:02 - privileges right and press yes
01:06 - and in here what I'm going to do is I'm
01:09 - going to see the change directory to
01:13 - this bin folder of this MongoDB right so
01:18 - right click and paste the path and press
01:21 - enter here and we are in the bin
01:23 - directory of this MongoDB folder right
01:27 - now let's see what are the databases we
01:31 - have using this shell here so I'm
01:35 - going to just give show DB's and press
01:39 - enter and right now I have three
01:41 - databases one is provided by the MongoDB
01:44 - which is local and other two which I
01:48 - have created one is school and one is my
01:50 - DB now for example I want to you know
01:54 - take the backup of these databases what
01:58 - I can do so in here in the bin folder
02:02 - you can find a command called dump
02:07 - and whenever you provide this command
02:09 - it's going to take the backup of your
02:12 - databases
02:13 - and save the dump in this folder itself
02:18 - so let's give this command so just give
02:20 -  dump and press enter and now you
02:25 - will be able to see this dump folder
02:27 - created by this command in your bin
02:30 - directory so let's go into this dump
02:34 - folder and in here you will see one
02:37 - folder for each of your databases one is
02:39 - my DB folder and inside this your
02:42 - collection will reside and the other
02:44 - school database and inside this your
02:48 - other collections will reside right so
02:51 - in this way you can backup your
02:54 - databases now if you want to restore
02:57 - your database what you can do so for
03:00 - example I will delete my database so I
03:03 - will just write use my DB and I'm going
03:07 - to drop this database so I will just
03:10 - write DB dot drop database and I'm going
03:15 - to give this command and this database
03:18 - is dropped I am going to do the same for
03:21 - the school database so I will switch to
03:24 - school and then I'm going to drop this
03:28 - database and let's see now what are the
03:32 - databases we have so I'm going to just
03:34 - say show D B's and now we only have one
03:39 - database which is local right so to
03:42 - restore our database we have this
03:45 - command called restore and what it
03:48 - does is it's restoring the databases
03:51 - from this folder so let's give this
03:55 - command in this other shelf which is
03:58 - with admin privileges so just give
04:04 - restore and press ENTER and our
04:08 - databases are restored so once again
04:11 - when we go here and give the commands
04:15 - ODB's we have all the three databases in
04:18 - here now what if you want to only backup
04:23 - only one database not all the databases
04:27 - you have so first of all what I'm going
04:29 - to do is I'm going to delete this dump
04:30 - folder and then I'm going to open both
04:35 - my command prompt for administrative
04:38 - privileges and the shell here and
04:41 - this time I'm going to give the command
04:43 - to dump the particular database for
04:47 - example I want to only backup my school
04:51 - database or I want to only backup my my
04:54 - DB database let's back up
04:56 - only my DB database so you need to give
04:59 - this command dump and then - - two
05:03 - times and that DB and then the database
05:06 - name you want to backup so for example
05:09 - my DB I want to backup this database and
05:12 - I will press ENTER and in here you can
05:16 - see this dump folder is created and
05:18 - inside this we only have a one database
05:21 - which is my DB now to restore this
05:25 - database what we can do here is first of
05:29 - all let's delete this database so we are
05:32 - going to just say use my DB and we are
05:37 - going to drop it so DB dot drop database
05:40 - and right now we have only two databases
05:45 - which is school and local right now to
05:48 - restore this database what we can do is
05:51 - we can give once again there is no
05:53 - command with - - DB and the database
05:57 - name so restore
05:59 - - - DB and then my DB it's going to
06:03 - restore your particular database so
06:05 - press ENTER and this gives errors to us
06:08 - because we need to also specify the path
06:12 - of your database so you just need to
06:16 - give this restore - - DB then your
06:20 - database name and then the path to your
06:24 - database so just right dump which is
06:27 - this folder here and inside this folder
06:30 - we have my DB ok so just give my DB ok
06:36 - so it's going to give the path of your
06:38 - database and then
06:40 - presenter and now the database is
06:42 - restored so we can just give show DB's
06:46 - here and then press ENTER and in here
06:49 - you can see my DB is restored now okay
06:53 - now let's see how we can backup only one
06:57 - collection from database so for that
07:01 - what we need to do is for example we
07:03 - want to you know backup the collection
07:06 - of school database so let's switch to
07:09 - school first so I think this is the
07:13 - command we'll use school and then press
07:17 - enter here and we are switched to school
07:20 - and in here we can just say show
07:22 - collections and press ENTER and it has
07:25 - the collection called students as we
07:28 - already know right now how we can backup
07:31 - only this collection so we need to give
07:35 - the same command dump - - or - -
07:40 - DB your database name then - -
07:43 - collection and then your collection name
07:47 - so my collection name is students here
07:51 - right so the command is dump - -
07:54 - DB my DB instead of my DB we need to
07:58 - give school because the database name is
08:01 - school here right so just give school
08:04 - and then - - connection and the
08:06 - collection name and then press ENTER and
08:09 - you can see one folder is created here
08:13 - inside this folder you have your student
08:16 - collection right now how to you know
08:20 - restore this once again so what we can
08:23 - do once again go to our shell and
08:26 - let's remove this collection first
08:29 - so let's first drop the student
08:32 - collection from here so just write DB
08:34 - dot students dot drop and is going to
08:43 - drop the collection it says trousseau
08:45 - collection is dropped and to restore it
08:47 - we need to use the same command so just
08:51 - give bongo restore
08:53 - - - DB my DB instead of my DB we will
08:57 - give the name of our database which is
09:01 - school and then - - the collection so
09:07 - just write collection and our collection
09:11 - name is student right so just give
09:16 - students here and that after the
09:20 - students we need to give the part of the
09:23 - student collection from here so the path
09:26 - of the student collection is dump and
09:28 - then our folder name which is cool so
09:32 - just give the name of the folder and
09:36 - inside the school we have this students
09:39 - dot B set file right so we will give
09:44 - this thing so forward slash students dot
09:48 - B so right and press enter and then it
09:54 - says done so let's see if it's restored
09:57 - or not so once again we will see say
10:00 - show collections let's say students so
10:05 - in this way you can backup and restore
10:07 - database collections and your whole
10:11 - databases right so I hope you enjoyed

your databases one is my DB folder and inside this your collection will reside and the other school database and inside this your other collections will reside right so in this way you can backup your databases now if you want to restore your database what you can do so for example I will delete my database so I will just write use my DB and I'm going to drop this database so I will just write DB dot drop database and I'm going to give this command and this database is dropped I am going to do the same for the school database so I will switch to school and then I'm going to drop this database

have so first of all what I'm going to do is I'm going to delete this dump folder and then I'm going to open both my command prompt for administrative privileges and the shell here and this time I'm going to give the command to dump the particular database for example I want to only backup my school database or I want to only backup my my DB database let's back up only my DB database so you need to give this command dump and then two times and that DB and then the database name you want to backup so for example my DB I want to backup this database and I will press ENTER and in here you can see this dump folder is created and inside this we only have a one database which is my DB now to restore this database what we can do here is first of all let's delete this database so we are going to just say use my DB and we are going to drop it so DB dot drop database and right now we have only two databases which is school and local right now to restore this database what we can do is we can give once again there is no command with DB and the database name so restore DB and then my DB it's going to restore your particular database so press ENTER and this gives errors to us because we need to also specify the path of your database so you just need to give this restore DB then your database name and then the path to your database so just right dump which is this folder here and inside this folder we have my DB ok so just give my DB ok so it's going to give the path of your database and then presenter and now the database is restored so we can just give show DB's here and then press ENTER and in here you can see my DB is restored now okay now let's see how we can backup only one collection from database so for that what we need to do is for example we want to you know backup the collection of school database so let's switch to school first so I think this is the command we'll use school and then press enter here and we are switched to school and in here we can just say show collections and press ENTER and it has the collection called students as we already know right now how we can backup only this collection so we need to give the same command dump or DB your database name then collection and then your collection name so my collection name is students here right so the command is dump DB my DB instead of my DB we need to give school because the database name is school here right so just give school and then connection and the collection name and then press ENTER and you can see one folder is created here inside this folder you have your student collection right now how to you know restore this once again so what we can do once again go to our shell and let's remove this collection first so let's first drop the student collection from here so just write DB dot students dot drop and is going to drop the collection it says trousseau collection is dropped and to restore it we need to use the same command so just give bongo restore DB my DB instead of my

students we need to give the part of the student collection from here so the path of the student collection is dump and then our folder name which is cool so just give the name of the folder and inside the school we have this students dot B set file right so we will give this thing so forward slash students dot B so right and press enter and then it says done so let's see if it's restored or not so once again we will see say show collections let's say students so in this way you can backup and restore database collections and your whole databases right so I hope you enjoyed this video
