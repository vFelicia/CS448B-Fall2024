00:00 - hey guys welcome to the next video in
00:02 - Python tutorial for beginners in this
00:04 - video I'm going to show you how to use
00:07 - mathematical operators and how to do
00:10 - basic math in Python so first of all we
00:14 - will open the idle IDE so just search
00:17 - for Python once again I have shown you
00:20 - this method in the last video also so
00:23 - just search for the Python once again
00:26 - and in the last video I have shown you
00:27 - how to install a Python and with the
00:30 - Python installation this ideal is also
00:34 - installed right so we are going to open
00:36 - this idle IDE now some of you who are
00:39 - familiar with Python and have some
00:42 - experience with Python may think that
00:44 - why am I using this Python idle IDE
00:48 - because there are many better IDE s and
00:51 - editors available for the development of
00:55 - Python so don't worry I'm going to show
00:58 - you everything how to install other IDE
01:02 - s which are preferred in the development
01:04 - of Python step by step but for now we
01:07 - will start with this idle IDE so the
01:10 - first thing which I want to do here is I
01:12 - want to increase the font size first of
01:15 - all in the idle IDE because this may be
01:19 - not visible to some of you you can
01:23 - change the font size by just changing
01:25 - this number and I'm going to change it
01:28 - to for example 18 and bold so we will be
01:32 - able to see our fonts in a better way so
01:35 - now everything is set so let's get
01:37 - started with the programming so let's
01:40 - start with the basic math operations so
01:43 - let's say I want to add something so I
01:45 - can just write number plus which is
01:48 - operator and the other number and then
01:52 - press ENTER and you will get the result
01:54 - of this expression now let's try the
01:57 - subtraction so let's say I want to
01:59 - subtract 60 minus 50 and then press
02:03 - ENTER and it gives the result let's do
02:06 - the negative subtraction so I'm going to
02:09 - just write 60 plus 50 and then press
02:12 - ENTER and it's going
02:13 - to return me the negative value now
02:17 - let's do the division so for example I
02:19 - want to divide 50 by 3 I'm going to
02:23 - press ENTER and you can see it gives me
02:25 - a float value or a decimal value and if
02:29 - you are familiar with other languages
02:31 - like Java or C++ this may appear a
02:33 - little bit strange to you because when
02:36 - you do the same operation in Java or C++
02:39 - with this division operator you will get
02:44 - the different answer which is 16 and not
02:47 - these decimal float value so if you want
02:51 - to just get an integer value and not the
02:54 - decimal value out of the division then
02:56 - you can write this expression which is
02:58 - 50 double forward slash 3 okay and then
03:03 - press Enter
03:03 - and now you get 16 which is a whole
03:06 - number or an integer this type of
03:09 - division is also called the flow
03:11 - division in which you get the whole
03:14 - number as the answer and the decimal
03:18 - value is truncated out of your answer so
03:22 - if you want to get the exact value out
03:24 - of the division in decimal values also
03:27 - then you can use this expression which
03:30 - is single forward slash operator and if
03:33 - you want to do the flow division then
03:34 - use these two forward slash symbols now
03:38 - it's also possible to divide two decimal
03:40 - values so decimal values in Python and
03:44 - most of the other languages are called
03:47 - the float values so here instead of 50 I
03:50 - can just write 50 point 0 divided by 3.0
03:56 - which is also valid or I can write 50
03:59 - point 0 divided by 10 and then press
04:04 - Enter which gives me 5.0 and when I
04:07 - write the integer which is 50 divided by
04:10 - 10 it will also give me this value which
04:13 - is 5.0 now let's try some multiplication
04:17 - so if you want to do multiplication in
04:19 - Python you use a number and then this
04:22 - asterisk symbol and then second number
04:26 - and then
04:27 - Center and this is going to multiply
04:30 - these two numbers so this is the
04:33 - multiplication operator which we can use
04:36 - to multiply two numbers now this is what
04:38 - we are doing here is for example
04:41 - multiplying two numbers or dividing two
04:44 - numbers or addition of two numbers or
04:46 - subtraction of two numbers in Python
04:49 - it's called expression okay so 50
04:52 - multiplied by 10 is an expression and I
04:55 - have already told you that these symbols
04:58 - for multiplication or division are
05:01 - called
05:02 - operators now the number on which you
05:05 - are doing these mathematical operations
05:08 - are called operands so 50 here is an
05:11 - operand then here is an operand or 3
05:14 - here is operand and 50 here is operand
05:18 - now here 50 and 10 are also called
05:20 - literals because they are constant
05:22 - values so what we have learned till now
05:25 - this is an expression this is an
05:29 - expression or 50 divided by 3 is an
05:32 - expression the number on which you
05:35 - operate on are called operands and these
05:39 - symbols which you can use to multiply
05:42 - divide add or subtract are called
05:45 - operators and these numbers are also
05:49 - called
05:50 - literals when they are constants now
05:53 - let's try some modulo operations so for
05:56 - example I'm going to just write 10
05:59 - modulus 3 here what it's going to give
06:03 - us is the remainder of the division of
06:06 - these two values so 3 multiplied by 3 is
06:10 - 9 which leaves the remainder 1 and
06:13 - that's the result we are getting ok
06:16 - let's try it once again so for example I
06:19 - will divide 21 divided by 5 it will give
06:23 - me the answer 4.2 but when I do 21 a
06:27 - modulo 5 and then press Enter it's going
06:31 - to give me the remainder of the division
06:35 - of two values now there is an another
06:38 - interesting operator which is called
06:40 - Expo
06:41 - and operator which you can use for the
06:44 - exponent values so for example I want to
06:47 - get the result of 2 to the power 5 how
06:50 - can I do it so I can just write 2 and
06:53 - then SS tricks and then 5 which means 2
06:57 - to the power 5 and then when I press
07:00 - ENTER it's going to give me 32 or I can
07:04 - just write 10 and then I can just write
07:07 - SS tricks and then for example 10 once
07:11 - again and then press Enter it's going to
07:13 - give me the result of 10 to the power 10
07:16 - now it's also possible to do these
07:18 - mathematical operations on more than one
07:21 - number so for example I can write 5 plus
07:24 - 5 plus 6 plus 9 and it will give me the
07:29 - result of the addition of these four
07:31 - numbers and it's also possible to use
07:33 - different type of operator in one
07:36 - expression so I can write 5 plus 9 minus
07:40 - 6 multiplied by 10 for example and it's
07:45 - going to give me the result of this
07:47 - expression now there is one question
07:49 - which may arise here is for example are
07:51 - once again I'm going to do 5 plus 9
07:54 - minus 6 x 10 and divided by 20 and press
08:02 - ENTER here it's going to give me this
08:05 - value but how this value is calculated
08:07 - what operation is executed first is the
08:12 - multiplication is done first or is the
08:16 - division done first or the addition took
08:19 - place first or the subtraction took
08:21 - place first so I have this table and
08:24 - here you can see the precedence of these
08:28 - operators so in this table highest
08:31 - precedence is at top and lowest is at
08:34 - bottom that means parentheses have the
08:38 - highest priority and then the exponents
08:42 - have the priority and then the
08:43 - multiplication and division operators
08:45 - have the same priority here and at last
08:49 - the subtraction and addition have the
08:53 - same price
08:54 - dirty but whenever you use these
08:56 - operators which are in the same box in a
09:00 - same expression then whatever operator
09:03 - you use on the left have the highest
09:06 - priority and whatever operator you use
09:10 - on the right have the lower priority so
09:14 - in this table parentheses have the
09:15 - highest priority and the addition and
09:18 - the subtraction have the lowest priority
09:20 - and for example if you use
09:23 - multiplication and division in the same
09:25 - expression then the priority is decided
09:28 - which operator is appearing on the left
09:31 - so if the operator is appearing on the
09:34 - left it has the highest priority then
09:37 - the operator which are on the right side
09:39 - so let's take an example of that so for
09:43 - example
09:50 - so first the addition of these two
09:52 - number will happen and then the division
09:55 - of these two numbers will happen because
09:57 - parentheses have the highest priority
09:59 - and then the result of these two numbers
10:03 - will be multiplied by six because
10:07 - multiplication have the highest priority
10:09 - out of these two operators which are
10:14 - minus and multiply so multiplication
10:17 - operator have the highest priority and
10:19 - at the end the subtraction of the result
10:22 - will take place so let's press ENTER and
10:26 - let's see what's the result so the
10:28 - result here is 11 and how we get this
10:31 - result here so 5 plus 9 is 14 and the
10:35 - division of these two number is 1 by 2
10:38 - so 6 will be divided by 2 which is 3 and
10:42 - then at last 3 will be subtracted from
10:45 - this result which is 14 which will give
10:49 - you 11 once again for example you use 60
10:53 - multiplied by 20 divided by 30 and then
10:59 - press Enter it will give you 40 but in
11:02 - which order this calculation will happen
11:05 - first of all this multiplication will
11:07 - take place because in the table we have
11:10 - seen that multiplication operator and
11:13 - division operator have the same priority
11:15 - and that's why the priority will be
11:17 - decided from left to right now if you
11:21 - want to learn the order of precedence
11:22 - between the operators then you can use
11:26 - this keyword which is PE m da s P stands
11:31 - for parentheses
11:32 - Easton's for exponents M stands for
11:35 - multiplication d stands for division
11:39 - instance for addition and s stands for
11:42 - subtraction okay so you can either
11:45 - remember this name which is M Dass or
11:50 - you can use this sentence which I have
11:53 - written here so please excuse my dear
11:57 - Aunt Sally and you need to remember the
12:00 - first letter of each word here
12:03 - the first letter of every word for
12:05 - example P here stands for parentheses
12:08 - eise here stands for exponent M and D
12:11 - here stands for multiplication and
12:13 - division a and s here stands for
12:16 - addition and subtraction so for
12:19 - remembering you can either use the
12:21 - sentence or you can remember this
12:23 - keyword so that's it for this video I
12:26 - hope you have learned something new in
12:28 - this video and please keep watching
12:30 - these videos and see you in the next
12:32 - video

hey guys welcome to the next video in Python tutorial for beginners in this video I'm going to show you how to use mathematical operators and how to do basic math in Python so first of all we will open the idle IDE so just search for Python once again I have shown you this method in the last video also so just search for the Python once again and in the last video I have shown you how to install a Python and with the Python installation this ideal is also installed right so we are going to open this idle IDE now some of you who are familiar with Python and have some experience with Python may think that why am I using this Python idle IDE because there are many better IDE s and editors available for the development of Python so don't worry I'm going to show you everything how to install other IDE s which are preferred in the development of Python step by step but for now we will start with this idle IDE so the first thing which I want to do here is I want to increase the font size first of all in the idle IDE because this may be not visible to some of you you can change the font size by just changing this number and I'm going to change it to for example 18 and bold so we will be able to see our fonts in a better way so now everything is set so let's get started with the programming so let's start with the basic math operations so let's say I want to add something so I can just write number plus which is operator and the other number and then press ENTER and you will get the result of this expression now let's try the subtraction so let's say I want to subtract 60 minus 50 and then press ENTER and it gives the result let's do the negative subtraction so I'm going to just write 60 plus 50 and then press ENTER and it's going to return me the negative value now let's do the division so for example I want to divide 50 by 3 I'm going to press ENTER and you can see it gives me a float value or a decimal value and if you are familiar with other languages like Java or C++ this may appear a little bit strange to you because when you do the same operation in Java or C++ with this division operator you will get the different answer which is 16 and not these

example multiplying two numbers or dividing two numbers or addition of two numbers or subtraction of two numbers in Python it's called expression okay so 50 multiplied by 10 is an expression and I have already told you that these symbols for multiplication or division are called operators now the number on which you are doing these mathematical operations are called operands so 50 here is an operand then here is an operand or 3 here is operand and 50 here is operand now here 50 and 10 are also called literals because they are constant values so what we have learned till now this is an expression this is an expression or 50 divided by 3 is an expression the number on which you operate on are called operands and these symbols which you can use to multiply divide add or subtract are called operators and these numbers are also called literals when they are constants now let's try some modulo operations so for example I'm going to just write 10 modulus 3 here what it's going to give us is the remainder of the division of these two values so 3 multiplied by 3 is 9 which leaves the remainder 1 and that's the result we are getting ok let's try it once again so for example I will divide 21 divided by 5 it will give me the answer 4.2 but when I do 21 a modulo 5 and then press Enter it's going to give me the remainder of the division of two values now there is an another interesting operator which is called Expo and operator which you can use for the exponent values so for example I want to get the result of 2 to the power 5 how can I do it so I can just write 2 and then SS tricks and then 5 which means 2 to the power 5 and then when I press ENTER it's going to give me 32 or I can just write 10 and then I can just write SS tricks and then for example 10 once again and then press Enter it's going to give me the result of 10 to the power 10 now it's also possible to do these mathematical operations on more than one number so for example I can write 5 plus 5 plus 6 plus 9 and it will give me the result of the addition of these four numbers and it's also possible to use different type of operator in one expression so I can write 5 plus 9 minus 6 multiplied by 10 for example and it's going to give me the result of this expression now there is one question which may arise here is for example are once again I'm going to do 5 plus 9 minus 6 x 10 and divided by 20 and press ENTER here it's going to give me this value but how this value is calculated what operation is executed first is the multiplication is done first or is the division done first or the addition took place first or the subtraction took place first so I have this table and here you can see the precedence of these operators so in this table highest precedence is at top and lowest is at bottom that means parentheses have the highest priority and then the exponents have the priority and then the multiplication and division operators have the same priority here and at last the subtraction and addition have the same price dirty but whenever you use these operators which are in the same box in a same expression then whatever operator you use on the left have the highest priority and whatever operator you use on the right have the lower priority so in this table parentheses have the highest priority and the addition and the subtraction have the lowest priority and for example if you use multiplication and division in the same expression then the priority is decided which operator is appearing on the left so if the operator is appearing on the left it has the highest priority then the operator which are on the right side so let's take an example of that so for example so first the addition of these two number will happen and then the division of these two numbers will happen because parentheses have the highest priority and then the result of these two numbers will be multiplied by six because multiplication have the highest priority out of these two operators which are minus and multiply so multiplication operator have the highest priority and at the end the subtraction of the result will take place so let's press ENTER and let's see what's the result so the result here is 11 and how we get this result here so 5 plus 9 is 14 and the division of these two number is 1 by 2 so 6 will be divided by 2 which is 3 and then at last 3 will be subtracted from this result which is 14 which will give you 11 once again for example you use 60 multiplied by 20 divided by 30 and then press Enter it will give you 40 but in which order this calculation will happen first of all this multiplication will take place because in the table we have seen that multiplication operator and division operator have the same priority and that's why the priority will be decided from left to right now if you want to learn the order of precedence between the operators then you can use this keyword which is PE m da s P stands for parentheses Easton's for exponents M stands for multiplication d stands for division instance for addition and s stands for subtraction okay so you can either remember this name which is M Dass or you can use this sentence which I have written here so please excuse my dear Aunt Sally and you need to remember the first letter of each word here the first letter of every word for example P here stands for parentheses eise here stands for exponent M and D here stands for multiplication and division a and s here stands for addition and subtraction so for remembering you can either use the sentence or you can remember this keyword so that's it for this video I hope you have learned something new in this video and please keep watching these videos and see you in the next video
