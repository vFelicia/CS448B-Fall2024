00:02 - you how you can download and install
00:04 - Ubuntu 20.04 on your virtualbox in your
00:10 - Windows 10 operating system
00:12 - so those of you who don't know what
00:15 - virtualbox is virtualbox is a tool which
00:18 - will enable you to run different
00:20 - operating systems virtually on your host
00:24 - operating system so in this case my host
00:27 - operating system is Windows 10 and I
00:30 - have installed virtualbox on my Windows
00:33 - 10 and then this virtualbox will enable
00:36 - me to run different operating systems
00:39 - virtually on my Windows 10 operating
00:42 - system now if you don't know how to
00:44 - install virtualbox you just need to
00:47 - search for virtualbox on your favorite
00:49 - browser and the first link which will
00:51 - appear here will be from virtualbox.org
00:55 - so just click on this link and once this
00:58 - link opens you just need to click on the
01:01 - downloads link here and you will be able
01:04 - to see this kind of interface just click
01:07 - on the Windows host option here and you
01:10 - will see that virtualbox EXE will be
01:13 - downloaded and once it's downloaded you
01:16 - just need to install it so the
01:17 - installation process is really easy so
01:20 - I'm not going to go through the
01:22 - installation process of virtualbox you
01:24 - just need to click some next buttons and
01:26 - virtualbox will be installed on your
01:29 - Windows operating system so once you
01:31 - have installed virtualbox on your
01:34 - Windows operating system it's going to
01:36 - look like this and whenever you open
01:39 - virtualbox it's going to open Oracle VM
01:43 - virtualbox manager now we are going to
01:46 - download the ISO file which is required
01:49 - to install Ubuntu on our virtual box so
01:54 - for downloading the ISO file of Ubuntu
01:57 - you can just search for Ubuntu and the
02:00 - first link which will appear here will
02:02 - be from ubuntu.com so I'm going to just
02:04 - click on this link and straight away you
02:08 - will see this option here which is
02:11 - what's new in Ubuntu 2004 because
02:15 - 2004 is the latest version of Ubuntu
02:19 - which is released recently so here you
02:23 - will see uh downloads tab here and when
02:27 - you click on the download tab you will
02:29 - see the Ubuntu desktop so you can just
02:32 - click on the version which is available
02:35 - and most probably you might want to
02:38 - install the LTS version okay so make
02:42 - sure that whenever you install Ubuntu
02:44 - you install the LTS version LTS means
02:48 - the long term support version which will
02:50 - at least run for two years okay so the
02:55 - support will run for two years so I am
02:57 - going to just click on Ubuntu desktop
02:59 - and here you will see the download
03:02 - button so I'm going to just click on the
03:04 - download button and when you click on
03:06 - the download button the ISO file will be
03:09 - downloaded on your Windows operating
03:12 - system so this file is around 2.5 GB
03:15 - file so it will take some time to
03:16 - download but I have already downloaded
03:18 - this file on my Windows operating system
03:21 - so I'm going to just cancel this
03:23 - download and also if you want to support
03:26 - Ubuntu project then you can just give
03:30 - small donation to Ubuntu for now I don't
03:34 - want to do anything so I have just
03:36 - downloaded the ISO file so once you have
03:39 - downloaded the ISO file it's going to
03:40 - look like this in case you have
03:43 - downloaded the 2004 version of Ubuntu so
03:47 - the name is Ubuntu hyphen
03:50 - 2004 hyphen desktop hyphen AMD 64 dot
03:55 - ISO file so once you have downloaded
03:58 - this ISO file we are ready to install
04:01 - Ubuntu on our virtualbox so on your
04:05 - virtualbox you just need to click on the
04:07 - new button here and once you click on
04:10 - the new button here you can Pro provide
04:12 - the name of your new machine so my new
04:16 - machine name is Ubuntu so I'm going to
04:19 - just write Ubuntu here and let's say I
04:21 - will also give the version of Ubuntu
04:24 - let's say
04:25 - 20.04 here and straight away a
04:29 - virtualbox is smart enough to provide
04:31 - you the proper options here okay so here
04:35 - you will see the machine folder where
04:38 - all the virtualbox related files will be
04:42 - downloaded and saved on your Windows
04:45 - operating system and the type here is
04:48 - Linux because Ubuntu is a Linux based
04:50 - operating system and the version here is
04:54 - Ubuntu 264 bit because we have
04:57 - downloaded the 64-bit ISO file okay
05:01 - there is no other option on the website
05:04 - as far as I know if you want to choose
05:09 - any other operating system the procedure
05:11 - is same you just need to select the
05:14 - operating system you want to install and
05:19 - here you can see many choices are given
05:22 - here okay so type is Linux and the
05:25 - version is Ubuntu 64-bit and then click
05:28 - on next and here in the memory size I
05:32 - generally provide the memory up to the
05:35 - green Mark so up to here whatever is
05:39 - allowed on my Windows operating system
05:42 - at this point and then I click on next
05:46 - here just leave everything as default so
05:50 - just leave it as default and then click
05:52 - on the create button now here hard disk
05:56 - file type just leave it as vdi which is
06:00 - virtualbox disk image and then click on
06:03 - next and here also you just need to
06:06 - leave this as dynamically allocated if
06:09 - you want to learn more about what is
06:12 - dynamically allocated and fixed size you
06:15 - can read from here basically dynamically
06:18 - at located option will allow your Ubuntu
06:21 - operating system to expand the disk size
06:24 - if required and fixed size is the fixed
06:27 - size so we want to allocate the space
06:32 - and disk size dynamically that's why we
06:36 - have chosen this option here which is
06:38 - dynamically allocated and now click on
06:40 - next and on the next window you can
06:43 - choose the file location this will be
06:45 - the location
06:46 - where your Ubuntu operating system files
06:50 - will be uh downloaded and installed on
06:54 - your Windows operating system so if you
06:56 - don't have the good reason to change it
06:57 - just leave it as default also you can
07:00 - choose the virtual hard disk size from
07:04 - here by default it's 10 GB selected here
07:07 - but let's say I would just want to
07:09 - increase it to uh 100 GB so I'm going to
07:13 - just move it around 100 GB and then I'm
07:17 - going to just click on create okay so
07:20 - once you create this machine you will be
07:22 - able to see this new machine here which
07:26 - is Ubuntu 20.04
07:29 - so just select this machine don't press
07:32 - on the start button yet you just need to
07:35 - select this Ubuntu machine which you
07:38 - have created and then click on the
07:40 - settings option so on the general
07:43 - settings you will see some options which
07:46 - we have already uh chosen at the time of
07:49 - creating this machine which is Linux and
07:51 - the version is Ubuntu
07:54 - 64-bit now click on advanced settings
07:57 - and then in the shared clipboard option
07:59 - you just need to choose it
08:02 - bi-directional and then drag and drop
08:04 - also bi-directional that will allow you
08:07 - to share your files between your host
08:10 - machine which is Windows in my case and
08:13 - your virtual machine which will be
08:16 - Ubuntu
08:17 - bi-directionally so you will be able to
08:20 - copy and paste into your Ubuntu from
08:23 - your Windows operating system and vice
08:25 - versa okay so in the description you can
08:29 - give any description here and in the
08:31 - disk encryption you just leave it as
08:34 - default now I am going to just go to the
08:37 - system option here and in the
08:41 - motherboard option you can leave
08:43 - everything as default you just need to
08:46 - go to the processors here and by default
08:49 - virtualbox will allocate one CPU to your
08:53 - machine so if you have the option you
08:56 - can increase it to whatever CPU one you
09:00 - want to use so for the safer side I
09:03 - always go up to this green Mark here
09:06 - okay which is for in my case you can
09:09 - increase the CPU size later also okay in
09:13 - the display settings just leave of
09:15 - everything as default and then move to
09:18 - the storage section here
09:21 - here you need to provide the location of

10:23 - click on OK
10:24 - and once you have done all those
10:27 - settings you are ready to start your

11:33 - here so I'm going to just search for the
11:35 - German keyboard which is this one you

12:12 - option checked and also I leave this
12:16 - option also checked which is download
12:18 - updates while installing Ubuntu also I'm
12:21 - going to just check this option also
12:23 - which is install third party software
12:25 - for graphics and Wi-Fi hardware and
12:28 - additional media formats so just check
12:31 - all the options which I have checked and
12:33 - then click on continue and here in the
12:36 - installation type just leave this option
12:39 - as default which is erase disk and
12:42 - install Ubuntu so this is not going to
12:46 - erase anything because you are
12:49 - installing Ubuntu on your virtualbox you
12:53 - are not installing Ubuntu on your
12:56 - Hardware right so don't worry it's not
13:00 - going to erase any disk or or anything
13:03 - from your Windows operating system just
13:06 - leave it as erase disk and install

13:30 - nearer to my physical location and then
13:34 - I'm going to click on the continue
13:35 - button
13:37 - and here you can just give the name to
13:41 - your Ubuntu operating system for example
13:43 - I'm going to just write a code bind here
13:47 - as the name and as the computer name
13:50 - here I can even remove the virtual box
13:53 - from the end because I just want to give
13:57 - the same name as the computer name also
13:59 - and also as the username I will just
14:02 - leave it as code bind if you want to
14:05 - change these names so let's say you want
14:09 - to give the different username here you
14:11 - can do that also and then you can just
14:15 - provide the password I'm going to just
14:17 - provide the password for now it's a weak
14:20 - password but you might want to provide
14:22 - the stronger Parts word than this and
14:25 - then you just need to confirm this
14:28 - password and once you are done with that
14:32 - you just need to click on the continue
14:34 - button
14:36 - and now the installation of Ubuntu will
14:40 - start on your vulture box so now at this
14:44 - step you don't need to do anything until
14:47 - Ubuntu is installed on your virtualbox
14:50 - so you just need to wait for some time
14:53 - until this installation is finished so I
14:56 - will also wait for the installation to
14:58 - be finished
15:02 - and after some time you will see uh this
15:04 - kind of window which says installation
15:06 - is complete you need to restart the
15:08 - computer in order to use the new
15:10 - installation so I'm going to just click

15:17 - and at this point it says please remove
15:20 - the installation medium then press enter
15:23 - so I'm going to just press enter here
15:25 - and now I can see the Ubuntu operating
15:27 - system is starting and now I can see uh
15:30 - this login window here so if you
15:33 - remember this is the username which I
15:35 - have given to my Ubuntu operating system
15:37 - so I will just click on this user and
15:40 - then I will provide the password which I
15:42 - have given at the time of installation
15:44 - and then press enter so first of all you
15:47 - will see this kind of Welcome window
15:48 - here you can click on the skip option
15:51 - here and also you can just click on the
15:55 - next next and next and then click on
15:59 - done and you will be able to see your
16:02 - Ubuntu desktop here right so when you
16:06 - just click on this maximize button now
16:09 - you will see that this desktop is not
16:12 - maximizing so for that we need to
16:15 - install a tool called virtualbox guest
16:19 - additions so for installing the
16:22 - virtualbox guest editions what you need
16:24 - to do is you need to open the terminal
16:27 - so you can just click on this option and
16:30 - then search for terminal here
16:33 - and once the terminal result comes you
16:36 - just need to click on the terminal
16:37 - option now once your terminal opens you
16:40 - just need to give this command I'm going
16:43 - to provide this command in the
16:44 - description of this video also which is
16:47 - to install some essential packages
16:49 - before you install virtualbox guest
16:52 - editions on your Ubuntu operating system
16:54 - so this command is sudo apt install
16:57 - built Essentials space d k m s space
17:01 - Linux minus headers hyphen this you name
17:06 - space r okay so just ah type this
17:10 - command on the Ubuntu terminal and then
17:13 - press enter and give your ubuntu's
17:16 - password I'm going to just provide my
17:17 - ubuntu's password here and then I will
17:20 - just press yes here or Y here and then
17:23 - press enter
17:24 - and after some time you will see that
17:27 - all the installation steps are finished
17:30 - so once it's done you can close your
17:33 - terminal and now what you can do is you
17:36 - can just go to devices on your
17:39 - virtualbox window so just click on
17:40 - devices here and then click on insert
17:43 - guest additions CD image and once you do

18:01 - click on authenticate which is going to
18:03 - open the terminal and it's going to
18:06 - install the virtualbox guest editions on
18:10 - your Ubuntu operating system and after
18:13 - some time you will see this message
18:15 - which says press return to close this
18:18 - window so you just need to press enter
18:20 - here which is going to close this window
18:22 - now at this point you just need to
18:25 - restart your Ubuntu operating system so
18:28 - just go here at the top and then click
18:31 - on power off and then click on power off
18:35 - once again okay so just click on power
18:37 - off and here you don't need to click on
18:40 - restart you just need to click on power
18:42 - off because we just need to shut down
18:45 - our Ubuntu operating system first
18:47 - now once it's shut down as I have told
18:50 - you that in the settings you need to go
18:54 - to the advanced settings in the general
18:56 - Tab and make sure that the shared
18:59 - clipboard and drag and drop option is
19:01 - bi-directional and that will enable you
19:05 - to just copy and paste your files
19:08 - between the virtual box and your host
19:10 - operating system now I'm going to start
19:13 - this Ubuntu once again and now I'm going
19:15 - to provide my ubuntu's password again
19:17 - and now if You observe when I just drag
19:21 - this window and make the size of this
19:24 - window little bit bigger the size of
19:27 - Ubuntu desktop also changes and
19:30 - resolution is also better right so when
19:32 - I just maximize this window my Ubuntu
19:35 - desktop size will also change
19:39 - so this is working now
19:42 - now I just want to test whether the copy
19:45 - and paste feature is working or not so I
19:48 - just opened the Firefox or browser on my
19:52 - Ubuntu operating system and now I'm
19:54 - going to just copy this URL which is on
19:57 - my Windows operating system so this is
20:00 - the Google Chrome browser on my Windows
20:02 - operating system and I will just copy
20:05 - this URL and paste it into my Ubuntu
20:07 - operating system and you can see this
20:09 - copy and paste option is working here
20:12 - right so this is working similarly when
20:15 - you just copy let's say I'm going to
20:17 - just copy this text from here and go to
20:20 - the browser and open the next Tab and
20:22 - paste this thing here you can see you
20:26 - can paste your text from your Ubuntu
20:29 - operating system into your Windows
20:32 - operating system so this is how you can
20:34 - install ubuntu's 20.04 on your
20:38 - virtualbox in Windows 10. I hope you've
20:41 - enjoyed this video and I will see you in
20:42 - in the next video

is Ubuntu 64bit and then click on next and here in the memory size I generally provide the memory up to the green Mark so up to here whatever is allowed on my Windows operating system at this point and then I click on next here just leave everything as default so just leave it as default and then click on the create button now here hard disk file type just leave it as vdi which is virtualbox disk image and then click on next and here also you just need to leave this as dynamically allocated if you want to learn more about what is dynamically allocated and fixed size you can read from here basically dynamically at located option will allow your Ubuntu operating system to expand the disk size if required and fixed size is the fixed size so we want to allocate the space and disk size dynamically that's why we have chosen this option here which is dynamically allocated and now click on next and on the next window you can choose the file location this will be the location where your Ubuntu operating system files will be uh downloaded and installed on your Windows operating system so if you don't have the good reason to change it just leave it as default also you can choose the virtual hard disk size from here by default it's 10 GB selected here but let's say I would just want to increase it to uh 100 GB so I'm going to just move it around 100 GB and then I'm going to just click on create okay so once you create this machine you will be able to see this new machine here which is Ubuntu 20.04 so just select this machine don't press on the start button yet you just need to select this Ubuntu machine which you have created and then click on the settings option so on the general settings you will see some options which we have already uh chosen at the time of creating this machine which is Linux and the version is Ubuntu 64bit now click on advanced settings and then in the shared clipboard option you just need to choose it bidirectional and then drag and drop also bidirectional that will allow you to share your files between your host machine which is Windows in my case and your virtual machine which will be Ubuntu bidirectionally so you will be able to copy and paste into your Ubuntu from your Windows operating system and vice versa okay so in the description you can give any description here and in the disk encryption you just leave it as default now I am going to just go to the system option here and in the motherboard option you can leave everything as default you just need to go to the processors here and by default virtualbox will allocate one CPU to your machine so if you have the option you can increase it to whatever CPU one you want to use so for the safer side I always go up to this green Mark here okay which is for in my case you can increase the CPU size later also okay in the display settings just leave of everything as default and then move to the storage section here here you need to provide the location of your ISO file wherever you have downloaded your Ubuntu ISO file so you just need to click on the empty option here so just click on empty under the controller so just choose the CD icon option here and then click on choose a disk file from here okay so just click on choose a disk file from here and then you just need to browse to the location where you have downloaded your Ubuntu ISO file so I'm going to just copy the location here and then paste it here and then select the ISO file from here and then click on open so once you have selected your ISO file using this CD icon you will see the name of your ISO file here also let me just move it further you can see the exact name of my ISO file here Ubuntu 20 of 0 4 desktop MD 64. so once you have done that you can do other settings from here also but I will leave everything as default and click on OK and once you have done all those settings you are ready to start your Ubuntu installation so here what I'm going to do is I'm going to select Ubuntu 20.04 and click on start button here and you can see the installation of Ubuntu is going to start in a few seconds you can just close these warning signs here and now you will see this kind of window here so on the left hand side you can choose the language in which you want to install Ubuntu you can see many languages are given here but for now I will choose English as my language and then I will click on the install Ubuntu button here now in the next window you will see the keyboard layout so from here you can choose the keyboard layout whatever keyboard layout you are using on your laptop or on your keyboard so in my case I'm using a German keyboard so I can just move to the German keyboard option here so I'm going to just search for the German keyboard which is this one you can choose any other keyboard from here okay so I'm going to choose the German keyboard and then on the right hand side I will just choose German as the language here and then you can also test your keyboard by typing something in this box so just choose your keyboard language here and then click on continue button and here on this window you will see update and other softwares so I normally just leave it as normal installation option checked and also I leave this option also checked which is download updates while installing Ubuntu also I'm going to just check this option also which is install third party software for graphics and WiFi hardware and additional media formats so just check all the options which I have checked and then click on continue and here in the installation type just leave this option as default which is erase disk and install Ubuntu so this is not going to erase anything because you are installing Ubuntu on your virtualbox you are not installing Ubuntu on your Hardware right so don't worry it's not going to erase any disk or or anything from your Windows operating system just leave it as erase disk and install Ubuntu and then click on install now now here you will see this warning which says if you continue the changes listed below will be written I will just click on continue button here now in the next step you can choose the location which is nearer to your physical location so I have chosen this location which is nearer to my physical location and then I'm going to click on the continue button and here you can just give the name to your Ubuntu operating system for example I'm going to just write a code bind here as the name and as the computer name here I can even remove the virtual box from the end because I just want to give the same name as the computer name also and also as the username I will just leave it as code bind if you want to change these names so let's say you want to give the different username here you can do that also and then you can just provide the password I'm going to just provide the password for now it's a weak password but you might want to provide the stronger Parts word than this and then you just need to confirm this password and once you are done with that you just need to click on the continue button and now the installation of Ubuntu will start on your vulture box so now at this step you don't need to do anything until Ubuntu is installed on your virtualbox so you just need to wait for some time until this installation is finished so I will also wait for the installation to be finished and after some time you will see uh this kind of window which says installation is complete you need to restart the computer in order to use the new installation so I'm going to just click on the restart Now button and at this point it says please remove the installation medium then press enter so I'm going to just press enter here and now I can see the Ubuntu operating system is starting and now I can see uh this login window here so if you remember this is the username which I have given to my Ubuntu operating system so I will just click on this user and then I will provide the password which I have given at the time of installation and then press enter so first of all you will see this kind of Welcome window here you can click on the skip option here and also you can just click on the next next and next and then click on done and you will be able to see your Ubuntu desktop here right so when you just click on this maximize button now you will see that this desktop is not maximizing so for that we need to install a tool called virtualbox guest additions so for installing the virtualbox guest editions what you need to do is you need to open the terminal so you can just click on this option and then search for terminal here and once the terminal result comes you just need to click on the terminal option now once your terminal opens you just need to give this command I'm going to provide this command in the description of this video also which is to install some essential packages before you install virtualbox guest editions on your Ubuntu operating system so this command is sudo apt install built Essentials space d k m s space Linux minus headers hyphen this you name space r okay so just ah type this command on the Ubuntu terminal and then press enter and give your ubuntu's password I'm going to just provide my ubuntu's password here and then I will just press yes here or Y here and then press enter and after some time you will see that all the installation steps are finished so once it's done you can close your terminal and now what you can do is you can just go to devices on your virtualbox window so just click on devices here and then click on insert guest additions CD image and once you do that you will be able to see this kind of window so you just need to click on the Run button here so just click on run and then you just need to provide your ubuntu's password so I'm going to just provide my ubuntu's password and then click on authenticate which is going to open the terminal and it's going to install the virtualbox guest editions on your Ubuntu operating system and after some time you will see this message which says press return to close this window so you just need to press enter here which is going to close this window now at this point you just need to restart your Ubuntu operating system so just go here at the top and then click on power off and then click on power off once again okay so just click on power off and here you don't need to click on restart you just need to click on power off because we just need to shut down our Ubuntu operating system first now once it's shut down as I have told you that in the settings you need to go to the advanced settings in the general Tab and make sure that the shared clipboard and drag and drop option is bidirectional and that will enable you to just copy and paste your files between the virtual box and your host operating system now I'm going to start this Ubuntu once again and now I'm going to provide my ubuntu's password again and now if You observe when I just drag this window and make the size of this window little bit bigger the size of Ubuntu desktop also changes and resolution is also better right so when I just maximize this window my Ubuntu desktop size will also change so this is working now now I just want to test whether the copy and paste feature is working or not so I just opened the Firefox or browser on my Ubuntu operating system and now I'm going to just copy this URL which is on my Windows operating system so this is the Google Chrome browser on my Windows operating system and I will just copy this URL and paste it into my Ubuntu operating system and you can see this copy and paste option is working here right so this is working similarly when you just copy let's say I'm going to just copy this text from here and go to the browser and open the next Tab and paste this thing here you can see you can paste your text from your Ubuntu operating system into your Windows operating system so this is how you can install ubuntu's 20.04 on your virtualbox in Windows 10. I hope you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in in the next video
