00:00 - hello guys welcome to the next video on
00:02 - Linux command line tutorial for
00:03 - beginners in this video we will see how
00:06 - we can use file permissions in Linux and
00:10 - especially we are going to talk about
00:12 - symbolic permissions uh in Linux so
00:16 - let's get started first of all what I'm
00:18 - going to do is I will just change the
00:20 - directory to the desktop and you can see
00:25 - here I have a file which uh has a name
00:28 - file itself right so what I want to do
00:31 - is I want to uh list the long listing of
00:36 - this file so I will just do Lis minus L
00:39 - and press enter and maybe in the
00:42 - previous video also I have uh you know
00:45 - just uh touched this topic that these uh
00:49 - thing here is the permission for the
00:52 - file now uh the first Dash on the left
00:56 - hand side you can see Dash or minus
00:58 - whatever you call it is the type of file
01:03 - for example if it's uh normal Dash it
01:07 - means it's a normal file if it would be
01:10 - uh D then it would be a directory or if
01:15 - uh it would be a character special file
01:18 - then it would be a c or it would if it
01:21 - would be um B then it would be a binary
01:25 - uh special file right now the next three
01:30 - uh you know group Next tree dash group
01:33 - or whatever next tree element uh you can
01:36 - say here is for the owner of the file
01:40 - right and then next threee is for the
01:43 - group of uh the file so group uh
01:46 - contains these rights and the last three
01:51 - uh is for the permission is the
01:54 - permission for everybody else
01:57 - right now the next uh you can see here
02:01 - is one and one stands for the symbolic
02:04 - links of the file so right now we have
02:06 - only one link right now uh the next is
02:11 - this name which is for the you know
02:15 - owner of the file so the name of the
02:17 - owner of the file is this one right next
02:21 - is the name of the group of the file so
02:24 - this is for the group now next is this
02:28 - one and uh
02:30 - this is for the size of the file so
02:34 - right now our file size is 22 and then
02:38 - next is the date on which it's created
02:44 - and then the file name right so these
02:47 - are uh the permissions so basically we
02:50 - are interested this area which is uh the
02:53 - user group and other permissions and the
02:57 - name of uh the user and the group right
03:01 - so let's uh try to uh change the
03:04 - permission of this file so there is a
03:07 - utility called CH mod which stands for
03:09 - change mod to change the permission of
03:12 - the file so for example I want to
03:15 - provide the permission to the user also
03:20 - but first of all what kind of permission
03:22 - we have so for this file for example we
03:27 - have three main kind of uh permission
03:29 - one is read other is write and third one
03:34 - is executable right so R stands for read
03:38 - W stands for write and X stands for
03:42 - executable so read write executable
03:45 - permission for a file okay so for
03:48 - example what I want to do is I want to
03:50 - change the permission of uh others to
03:54 - execute this file so I want to allow the
03:57 - other persons to execute this F file for
04:00 - example right so what I can do is I will
04:03 - just use CH mod which is the utility to
04:07 - change the permission of the file and
04:10 - then I can give the first of all uh name
04:15 - of others so for example o stands for
04:18 - others here and then plus or minus plus
04:22 - is for adding the permission and minus
04:25 - is for subtracting the permission and
04:27 - then the permission itself so I want to
04:30 - Grant the executable permission to the
04:32 - other user so o stands for other here
04:36 - plus is for adding the permission and X
04:39 - for example is the permission so
04:42 - executable permission right and then the
04:44 - name of the file itself so file right
04:47 - and I will press enter here so
04:49 - permission is changed and once again
04:52 - when we do LS minus L you can see here
04:56 - earlier the others doesn't have the
04:59 - executable permission but now the others
05:02 - have executable permissions right next
05:07 - what we can do here is once again we can
05:09 - change the permission of others to write
05:13 - also so we can do W here and uh then
05:17 - press enter and once again we will do
05:19 - the long listing and you can see the
05:22 - others can write and execute and uh the
05:26 - read permission they already had so they
05:28 - can now read right and executable now
05:31 - it's not necessary that you want to do
05:34 - this for in the normal circumstances but
05:37 - this is just for the example we want to
05:40 - I want to show you right so for example
05:43 - now I want to change the permission of
05:45 - the group and group already have the
05:48 - permission read and write right so I
05:51 - want to change it to read write
05:53 - executable so for the group once again
05:56 - we will use CH mod and then for group
05:59 - Group G and then plus X so we will
06:04 - change the permission of the group and
06:07 - the name of the file and just press
06:09 - enter and then long listing once again
06:12 - and you can see now the group can also
06:15 - read write and executed now for example
06:19 - once again I want to uh you know reduce
06:22 - the permission of uh the group once
06:25 - again so right now group can read write
06:29 - and execute and I want to make it just
06:33 - to read so just allow the group to only
06:36 - read the file so once again CH mod and
06:40 - as I told you g is for group and minus
06:44 - is for reducing the permission right so
06:47 - we want to remove for example write and
06:50 - executable right and then the name of
06:52 - the file and once again when I press
06:55 - enter and once again when I do long
06:58 - listing now you can see group can only
07:01 - read because we have substracted the you
07:05 - know permission of the group to write
07:07 - and execute using this notation okay now
07:13 - uh for example I want to give the
07:15 - permission to uh every everybody so for
07:20 - example I want to give the user of uh
07:23 - this file or owner of this file to read
07:26 - write and execute and also I want to
07:29 - give uh the give the group of this uh
07:33 - file to read write and execute so what I
07:36 - can do is here one more not notation I
07:39 - can use which is for example CH
07:43 - mod and then the user is for uh the user
07:50 - and for example I want to also change
07:52 - the group so you can change the
07:54 - permission for uh multiple uh you know
07:58 - group or user for example you want to
08:00 - change it for user also and for the
08:02 - group also so you can use uh this
08:05 - combination also right and you can also
08:08 - use equal to so which uh is for granting
08:13 - the permission also so this notation is
08:15 - also used to you know changing the
08:18 - permission and I want to make it uh read
08:22 - write and execute so I will just do read
08:26 - write execute rwx for uh read WR execute
08:30 - okay so this will change the permission
08:32 - of user or owner of this file and the
08:35 - group of this file to read write and
08:37 - execute and the name of the file don't
08:40 - forget right and then press enter and
08:42 - once again we will do the long listing
08:45 - and now we can see everybody have read
08:48 - write and execute permissions
08:51 - right now for example I want to uh
08:55 - remove the permission or change the
08:57 - permission to every buddy right so for
09:01 - example I want to remove uh the
09:03 - permission for the user and the group
09:06 - and uh the others so that they cannot
09:10 - even read write or execute right so once
09:13 - again I will do CH mod and what you can
09:17 - do is you can do user group and uh the
09:21 - other you can do the notation something
09:24 - like this and then you can for example
09:29 - some do something like minus read write
09:33 - and execute something like this okay and
09:36 - this will uh remove the permission or
09:39 - otherwise you can just do use you can
09:42 - just use a for all and then you can do
09:45 - minus and then do read write and execute
09:50 - right so a stands for all so it stands
09:54 - for user or owner group and others so
09:58 - you are basically one to subtract all
10:00 - the permission from all the users and
10:03 - you can press enter before that we need
10:06 - to give the name of the file press enter
10:09 - and then use long listing and now we can
10:12 - see nobody has the permission to you
10:16 - know change or readwrite or execute this
10:18 - file right now for example I want to
10:22 - give everybody their permission back so
10:25 - I want to give the same status I have in
10:29 - in the you know uh starting so I want to
10:32 - give the owner of this file read and
10:34 - write group also read and write and the
10:39 - others just the read permission so what
10:41 - I can do is I can do CH
10:44 - mod and for the user I want to add once
10:48 - again the permission read and write okay
10:52 - and then you can use the comma to give
10:54 - the other others the permission for
10:57 - example group and once again we want to
11:00 - give the permission to the group read
11:02 - and write or you can do this thing
11:05 - something like read and write using
11:08 - equals both are uh the same commands and
11:12 - uh then for the others we want to just
11:17 - give the read permission something like
11:19 - this and the name of the file okay so
11:22 - use comma in order to you know separate
11:25 - the permission or if you want to uh
11:27 - change the multiple
11:29 - uh permission of the multiple users
11:32 - right and press enter and it gives some
11:36 - uh problem let's see what's the problem
11:39 - is yeah so the problem is uh CH mod is
11:42 - not spelled correctly so I must correct
11:45 - it so I will remove this a and now the
11:50 - command is normal right so I will press
11:53 - enter and now once again I will do the
11:55 - long listing and now once again we have
11:59 - have the normal permission of the file
12:01 - so for owner we have read write group we
12:04 - have read write and for other we have
12:06 - read permission so this is how you can
12:10 - change the permission of a file using
12:13 - symbolic notation so this uh RW or X is
12:18 - called a symbolic notation right so this
12:22 - is how you can change the permission I

hello guys welcome to the next video on Linux command line tutorial for beginners in this video we will see how we can use file permissions in Linux and especially we are going to talk about symbolic permissions uh in Linux so let's get started first of all what I'm going to do is I will just change the directory to the desktop and you can see here I have a file which uh has a name file itself right so what I want to do is I want to uh list the long listing of this file so I will just do Lis minus L and press enter and maybe in the previous video also I have uh you know just uh touched this topic that these uh thing here is the permission for the file now uh the first Dash on the left hand side you can see Dash or minus whatever you call it is the type of file for example if it's uh normal Dash it means it's a normal file if it would be uh D then it would be a directory or if uh it would be a character special file then it would be a c or it would if it would be um B then it would be a binary uh special file right now the next three uh you know group Next tree dash group or whatever next tree element uh you can say here is for the owner of the file right and then next threee is for the group of uh the file so group uh contains these rights and the last three uh is for the permission is the permission for everybody else right now the next uh you can see here is one and one stands for the symbolic links of the file so right now we have only one link right now uh the next is this name which is for the you know owner of the file so the name of the owner of the file is this one right next is the name of the group of the file so this is for the group now next is this one and uh this is for the size of the file so right now our file size is 22 and then next is the date on which it's created and then the file name right so these are uh the permissions so basically we are interested this area which is uh the user group and other permissions and the name of uh the user and the group right so let's uh try to uh change the permission of this file so there is a utility called CH mod which stands for change mod to change the permission of the file so for example I want to provide the permission to the user also but first of all what kind of permission we have so for this file for example we have three main kind of uh permission one is read other is write and third one is executable right so R stands for read W stands for write and X stands for executable so read write executable permission for a file okay so for example what I want to do is I want to change the permission of uh others to execute this file so I want to allow the other persons to execute this F file for example right so what I can do is I will just use CH mod which is the utility to change the permission of the file and then I can give the first of all uh name of others so for example o stands for others here and then plus or minus plus is for adding the permission and minus is for subtracting the permission and then the permission itself so I want to Grant the executable permission to the other user so o stands for other here plus is for adding the permission and X for example is the permission so executable permission right and then the name of the file itself so file right and I will press enter here so permission is changed and once again when we do LS minus L you can see here earlier the others doesn't have the executable permission but now the others have executable permissions right next what we can do here is once again we can change the permission of others to write also so we can do W here and uh then press enter and once again we will do the long listing and you can see the others can write and execute and uh the read permission they already had so they can now read right and executable now it's not necessary that you want to do this for in the normal circumstances but this is just for the example we want to I want to show you right so for example now I want to change the permission of the group and group already have the permission read and write right so I want to change it to read write executable so for the group once again we will use CH mod and then for group Group G and then plus X so we will change the permission of the group and the name of the file and just press enter and then long listing once again and you can see now the group can also read write and executed now for example once again I want to uh you know reduce the permission of uh the group once again so right now group can read write and execute and I want to make it just to read so just allow the group to only read the file so once again CH mod and as I told you g is for group and minus is for reducing the permission right so we want to remove for example write and executable right and then the name of the file and once again when I press enter and once again when I do long listing now you can see group can only read because we have substracted the you know permission of the group to write and execute using this notation okay now uh for example I want to give the permission to uh every everybody so for example I want to give the user of uh this file or owner of this file to read write and execute and also I want to give uh the give the group of this uh file to read write and execute so what I can do is here one more not notation I can use which is for example CH mod and then the user is for uh the user and for example I want to also change the group so you can change the permission for uh multiple uh you know group or user for example you want to change it for user also and for the group also so you can use uh this combination also right and you can also use equal to so which uh is for granting the permission also so this notation is also used to you know changing the permission and I want to make it uh read write and execute so I will just do read write execute rwx for uh read WR execute okay so this will change the permission of user or owner of this file and the group of this file to read write and execute and the name of the file don't forget right and then press enter and once again we will do the long listing and now we

other you can do the notation something like this and then you can for example some do something like minus read write and execute something like this okay and this will uh remove the permission or otherwise you can just do use you can just use a for all and then you can do minus and then do read write and execute right so a stands for all so it stands for user or owner group and others so you are basically one to subtract all the permission from all the users and you can press enter before that we need to give the name of the file press enter and then use long listing and now we can see nobody has the permission to you know change or readwrite or execute this file right now for example I want to give everybody their permission back so I want to give the same status I have in in the

like this and the name of the file okay so use comma in order to you know separate the permission or if you want to uh change the multiple uh permission of the multiple users right and press enter and it gives some uh problem let's see what's the problem is yeah so the problem is uh CH mod is not spelled correctly so I must correct it so I will remove this a and now the command is normal right so I will press enter and now once again I will do the long listing and now once again we have have the normal permission of the file so for owner we have read write group we have read write and for other we have read permission so this is how you can change the permission of a file using symbolic notation so this uh RW or X is called a symbolic notation right so this is how you can change the permission I hope you've enjoyed this video please RIT comment subscribe and bye for now
