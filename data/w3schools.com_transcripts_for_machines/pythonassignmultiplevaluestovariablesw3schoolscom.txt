Hey there, coding enthusiasts! Today, we'll learn some cool tricks on how to assign multiple values in Python. Ready? Let's go! First up, let's see how Python lets you assign values to multiple variables in a single line! Here, we have three variables x, y, and z. And we're assigning them 'Orange', 'Banana', and 'Cherry' all in one go! Pretty neat, right? But remember, the number of variables must match the number of values, or you'll get an error. Next, let's see how you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line. Here, x, y, and z are all assigned the value 'Orange'. Simple and efficient! Now, let's move on to something called unpacking a collection. This is where the magic happens. We've got a list of fruits, and we're unpacking it into variables x, y, and z. Voila! Each variable gets a value from the list. And that's it for today! You've learned how to assign multiple values to variables, assign one value to multiple variables, and unpack collections in Python.
