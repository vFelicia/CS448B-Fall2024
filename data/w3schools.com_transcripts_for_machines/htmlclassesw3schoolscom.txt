Hello class! Let's talk about the class attribute In HTML you have the opportunity to group or classify elements together This is helpful if you want to apply the same action for all elements in a specific group Look at this group of people What if we want all the people with red shirts to start jumping Hey! Red shirts! Start jumping! In HTML we can use the class attribute to group elements For example if we want this group of elements to have a red background we add the class attribute with the value "mygroup" Now these two paragraphs belong to the same class We can use CSS to select these elements with the class selector The syntax for the class selector is a dot followed by the class name In our example the class name is "mygroup" As you can see the two paragraphs now have a red background By the way different elements can share the same class See now the heading element also has a red background because it has the same class as the two paragraphs HTML elements can also belong to more than one class Just remember to separate them with a space like this Now the heading element belongs to both the "mygroup" class and the "main" class and we'll get the CSS styles from both classes Now class you know about class Goodbye class
