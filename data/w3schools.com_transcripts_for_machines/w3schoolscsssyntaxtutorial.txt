welcome to the W3 schools CSS syntax tutorial the CSS rule set consists of a selector and the Declaration block the selector points to the HTML element you want to style in this case an H1 element the Declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolon one declaration here one declaration here each declaration includes a property name in this case color and a value blue separated by a column CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon and declaration groups are surrounded by curly braces this selector points to the P element which means all P elements will be affected by this rule like this and this this declaration specifies the text color let's try and change it and this declaration specifies the text alignment in this example we have put one declaration on each line to make it easier to read but you can also have the whole rule set on a single line this works just fine and save space commment in CSS are used to explain your code it can help when you look at the source code at a later date CSS comment starts with Slash Asterix and ends with Asterix slash comments are ignored by browsers so you can put anything you want in them and it will not be displayed in the output comments can also span multiple lines like this one this was a short introduction to CSS syntax you can learn more about CSS syntax from our other chapters or videos thank you for watching
