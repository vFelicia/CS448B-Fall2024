welcome to the w3schools CSS links tutorial links can be styled with any CSS property for example color font family background and so on in addition links can be styled differently depending on which state or situation the link is currently in the for link states are link which is a normal and visit the link visited which is a link the user has already visited Hoover which is a link when the user Mouse's over it and active which is a link the moment it's clicked let's create an additional link here to page I haven't visited yet so I can show the link States a bit more clearly let's try changing the colors for a different link States start with link set that to a blue color so the link I haven't visited yet is shown in a blue color and let's change the color for visit the links to red so the link that I already have visited is red let's change the color for Hoover to orange so when I hover over the links it will change to an orange color let's change active to green so I'm going to click the link and I'm going to keep the mouse button pressed so you can see the color see it turns to green color when setting the style for several link states there are some rules Hoover must come after link and list it an active must come after Hoover let's go through some of the other common ways to style links text decoration is mostly used to remove underlined from links this example we've removed the underline from the link but it will appear when we hover or click it let's change that underline to align true see now there's a line through the link when we hover now let's set the background color for the links here we use the background color property to specify the background color for the different link States it's quite common to group the style rules for visited link and Hoover and active so let's try that I'll visit it a link will have the same style and Hoover enacted will have the same style let's change the background color for a link and missed it to orange and over an active to yellow so now there's an orange background color for the link whether it's visited or not and it will get a yellow background if we hover it or click it on our tutorial page you can find more examples for different ways to style links this concludes our tutorial for CSS links thank you for watching
