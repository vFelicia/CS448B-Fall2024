now let's look at the rules for writing python starting with indentation in Python indentation is crucial in this example we have an if statement with a second line print 5 is greater than two the second line is indented with four spaces this indentation tells python that the second line is part of the if statement block if you skip the indentation python will throw a syntax error or read them as two different statements so always remember to indent your code properly you can use different numbers of spaces but the standard is four just make sure you're consistent within the same block because python will throw an error if you use different numbers of spaces within the same block
