welcome to the W3 schools CSS selector tutorial CSS selectors allow you to select and style HTML elements selectors are used to find elements based on their ID classes types attributes values of attributes and much more let's go through the most common selectors the element selector selects elements based on the element name this is the CSS selector it is set to P that means it will select all P elements on the page like this so it Styles all P elements to be Center aligned and have a red color but if we add another element that is not a p element it will not be a Ed by the style see this Dev element was not affected by the style the ID selector uses the ID attribute of an HTML element to find the specific element an ID should be unique within a page so you should use the ID selector when you want to find a single unique element to find an element with a specific ID use a hash character followed by the ID of the element so this style rule will be applied to the HTML element with ID equals power one if we add an ID to the second element and change the selector to match the new ID the other element will be affected by the style like this the class selector finds element with a specific class set by the HTML class attribute to select elements with a specific class use a period character followed by the name of the class so this style will be applied to HTML elements with class equals Center or you can specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class by including the element name so if we set p period Center only P elements with class equal Center will be affected like this you can also add multiple classes to an element so if if we create a separate style rule for color see now we have a style rule for Center and a style rule for color and remove the element selector and add a second class to the h one element see both elements are affected by the center style rule but only the H1 is affected by the color style rule since it has class equal Center and color in Styles sheets there are often elements using the same style for example here we have the same style for the H1 H2 and P element to minimize the code you can group selectors to group selectors separate each selector with a comma here we have grouped selectors for H1 H2 and P elements so the style is applied to H1 H2 and P elements this works with all kinds of selectors so if we remove the H2 and P element selectors and add an ID to the P element so we can group selectors for H1 and elements with ID para one so this works with any kind of selector element selectors ID selectors class selector or any other selector this concludes our tutorial for CSS selectors thank you for watching
