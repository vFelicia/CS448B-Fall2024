comments in Python start with a hashtag symbol like this they're super handy for explaining your code making it easier to read or even preventing certain lines from running while you test your code here's a basic example see that python ignores everything on that line after the hashtag so this is a comment is just for us humans to read you can also put comments at the end of a line of code again everything on that line after the hashtag is ignored by python it's like adding a note for yourself or others who read your code
