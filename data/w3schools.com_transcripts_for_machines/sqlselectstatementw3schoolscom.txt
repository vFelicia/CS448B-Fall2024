Hey there, future data wizards! Lets look at the SELECT statement. Think of it as your trusty tool for picking data out of a database, like choosing your favorite candies from a jar! So, let's get started. The SELECT statement is used to grab data from a database. Here’s a simple example to warm up. This code tells the database 'Hey, give me the CustomerName and City columns from the Customers table.' But how do we write this in a general form? Here's the syntax 'column1, column2, et cetera' are the columns you want, and 'table_name' is the table you’re getting them from. Now, let’s look at our demo database, the Customers table. Here's a sneak peek Lets do our SELECT statement from earlier 'SELECT CustomerName and City FROM Customers; Pretty cool, right? But what if we want to see everything in the table? We use the * wildcard! Like this This tells the database 'Show me all the columns!' And you get the whole shebang. And that’s the basics of the SQL SELECT statement! Easy peasy, right?
