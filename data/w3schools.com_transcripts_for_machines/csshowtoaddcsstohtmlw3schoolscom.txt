Welcome to W3Schools.com! Today, we're diving into the different ways to add CSS to your HTML pages. Imagine you have a wardrobe. CSS is like deciding what outfit your webpage wears. And guess what? There are three ways to pick out your web page’s outfit External, Internal, and Inline CSS. External CSS is like having a fashion designer tailor an outfit for all your pages. Change one file, and voila! A new look across your site. Here's how you link an external style sheet. Inside the section, add . This simple line tells your webpage to adopt the styles defined in “mystyle.css”. Now, Internal CSS is when a page wants to wear a unique outfit. Just for a special occasion, you know? Inside the , we place a element. Here, we've set the body background to linen and the heading to maroon with a left margin of 40 pixels. Each style change is neatly contained, affecting only this page. And for those tiny tweaks, Inline CSS works wonders. It's like adjusting your look with accessories. Look at this element. By adding style=”colorblue; textaligncenter” , we've directly modified its color and alignment. It's a quick fix for individual elements. But what if styles clash? CSS has a rulebook ... the cascading order. Think of it as deciding which layer of your outfit goes on top. When we have both external and internal styles for the same element, the last one in the code takes precedence. If the internal style comes after the external link, it wins. So, if our internal CSS says ‘orange’ for , and it's loaded after the external ‘navy’ style, our heading turns orange. But if the external link comes after the internal style, the external link wins, and the heading will be “navy”. And inline styles applied to the element itself takes precedence over both.
