You've been handed plenty of forms throughout your life At the doctor's office at school for activities and programs If you want to sign up or join something you're usually going to have to fill out a form In today's age these forms are usually on websites and built with HTML An HTML form is used to collect user input The user input is then sent to a server for processing The HTML form element is used to create a form The form element is a container for different types of elements One of the most used elements inside a form is the input element The input element can be displayed in several different ways depending on its type attribute We have textfields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons , etc. Let's look at a real life example defines a single line input field for text "My name is Bill" displays a radio button It lets a user select one option from a number of choices "This one, the burger" displays a checkbox It lets a user select many options from a number of choices "Check! Check! Check! Check!" "I'll have all of those on my juicy burger!" There are many more input types you can use Here's a quick list In addition to the input element there are several other elements we can use in forms The select element defines a drop down list It's a partially hidden list that drops down with a list of options that you can choose from "I'll pick this up at 500" The text area element defines a multiline input field where the user can input text with more than just a few words Like a comment field "I would like my burger super well done!" Finally let's add a submit button so Bill can send in his order defines a submit button "I'm so hungry!"
