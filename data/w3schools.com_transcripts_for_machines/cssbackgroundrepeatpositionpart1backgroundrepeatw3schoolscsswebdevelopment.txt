first up the CSS background repeat property by default a background image will repeat itself both horizontally and vertically across your web page look at our example if we don't specify anything else our lovely gradient background will tile all over which can get a bit overwhelming but what if we only want it to repeat horizontally easy peasy we use repeat X background repeat repeat X and just like that our gradient looks leak across the width without invading the space above and below quick tip to repeat an image just vertically switch repeat X to repeat Y super handy for those long scrolling pages
