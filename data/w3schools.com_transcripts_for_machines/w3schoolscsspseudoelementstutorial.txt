welcome to the W3 schools CSS pseudo elements tutorial a CSS pseudo element is used to style specified parts of an element for example it can be used to style the first letter or line of an element or insert content before or after the content of an element let's look at an example where we style the first line of an element in this example we us use the first line pseudo element to style the first line of this text see we set it to a red color and it's in small caps the way to add a pseudo element is to added to a selector like this P selector element selector and a studo element always starts with two columns so it's selector colon colon and the pseudo element you want to add the first line pseudo element can only be applied to block elements like this B element and there are some restrictions on what kind of properties that can be used with the first line pseudo element you can use Font properties uh like font size and te most text properties uh like word or letter spacing you can use color and background properties and clear for floating we can also set the first letter Su element uh to apply style to the first letter like this and like first line the first letter pseudo element can only be applied to block elements and there are some restrictions here too you can use the same properties as you can for first line but also margin padding and Border properties and Float but not word and letter spacing since it's just for single character and you can use both first line and first letter at the same time so let's try and style both the first letter and the first line like this and you can use pseudo elements with almost any kind of selector here we set it for uh an element selector with a class selector or we can just remove the class selector and set it for all P elements or we can add an ID and have the pseudo element applied to that like this the before pseudo element can be used to insert content before the content of an element here we've used the before pseudo element to insert an image before each H1 element or that is before the content of each H1 element we can also use it to add text like this and you can use the after pseudo element to insert content after the content of an element like this and the before and after pseudo elements can be used together for example to set quotes using open quote and close quote like this and on the W3 schools tutorial page we list all the CSS pseudo classes and elements and there's a link for each class or element that goes to our CSS reference for that specific class or element this concludes our tutorial for CSS pseudo elements thank you for watching
