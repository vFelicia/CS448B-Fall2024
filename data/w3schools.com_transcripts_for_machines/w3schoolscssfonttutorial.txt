welcome to the W3 schools CSS font tutorial CSS font properties Define the font family boldness size and style of the text in CSS there are two types of font family names generic families which is a group of font families with a similar look these are siif sanserif and monospace and font family names which are specific font families like Times New Roman or Ariel or corer new let's look at how they're grouped Times New Roman and Georgia are a part of the SF family Ariel and Verana are part of the Sans family SF fants have small lines at the end of some characters you see here they are marked in red sansor RI fonts they do not have the lines at the end of the characters actually Sans means without monospace fonts like corer new and Luc consoles are fonts where all characters have the same width you can see the difference especially for the r and I here in corer New and R and I in Arial on computer screens some SF fonts are considered easier to read than SF fonts when uh we speak of fonts it's most often the font family we mean and this is set with the font family property when setting the font family property you should set several font names as a fallback system if the browser doesn't support the first font it tries the next you can specify several fonts using a comma start with the font you want and end with a generic family name so the browser can pick a similar font in a generic family if no other fonts are available if the name of the font is more than one word it must be in quotations marks like this let's change this font to Verana let's see what happens if we deliberately misspell the name of the font see it goes to the next fallback font which which is the generic s SF on our tutor tutorial page we have a link to a page listing web safe font combinations but let's move on to font style the font style property is mostly used to specify italic text the font style property supports three values normal which is how the text is shown normally italic which is italic style and oblique which is leaning text this is quite similar to italic but less supported in browsers so let's remove the oblique font style now the paragraph is shown in the default style which is normal the font size property sets the size of the text the font size value can be an absolute or relative value with absolute value you set the text to the specifi size and you do not allow users to change the text size in their browsers absolute size is useful when the physical size of the output is known like when you know exactly how many pixels of width you have available with relative size you set the size relative to the surrounding elements and you allow users to change the text size in their browsers let's look at an example where we set absolute size here we've set the size in pixels this gives us full control of the text size but it does not allow users to resize the text in their browsers however you can still use the zoom tool to resize the entire page like this to allow users to resize the text many developers use eem instead of pixels the EM size unit is recommended by the worldwide Web Consortium one em is equal to the current font size the default text size in browser is 16 pixels so the default size of 1 em is 16 pixels so we want this H1 element to have a size of 40 pixels but we want to set it with em so in our comment here we've shown how to calculate from pixels to em you divide the pixels by 16 so in this example the text size is the same as the previous example however with the EM size it's possible to adjust the text size in all browsers let show you this in a different browser you see we're not zooming we're changing the text size from medium which is default to largest or to smaller size unfortunately there is still a problem with older versions of Internet Explorer the text becomes larger than it should when made larger and smaller than it should when made smaller the solution to this is to set a default font size for the body element so set the font size to 100% for the body element now with this code the text is the same size in all major browsers and it allows users to resize the text or Zoom the page let's see how we can set the boldness of the text in this example we use the F weight property to set the boldness of the text you can set it to normal bold or Bolder lighter or a number from 100 to 900 where 400 is the same as normal and 700 is the same as bold the difference between the weight settings for this depends on the font you use on the W preschool tutorial page there are more examples and we list all the CSS font properties and there's a link for each property that goes through our CSS reference where we can find more information for any CSS property this concludes our tutorial for CSS font thank you for watching
