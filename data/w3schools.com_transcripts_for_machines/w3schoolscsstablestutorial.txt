welcome to the w3schools CSS tables tutorial the look of an HTML table can be greatly improved with CSS let's start with table borders to specify table borders in CSS use the border property this example specifies a black border for table table header and table data elements notice that this example has double borders that's because both the table and the table header and data elements have separate orders to display a single border for the table use the border collapse property like this with the border collapse property set to collapse the table borders are collapsed into a single border the width and height of the table is specified by the width and height properties here we've set the width property of the table to a hundred percent so it takes 100% of the available space let's try to change it to a pixel value and the height of the table header is 50 pixels you see here it's a bit much so let's change it to 10 pixels the text in a table is aligned using the text align and vertical align properties the text align property sets the horizontal alignment like left right or Center in this example that takes the line property for the table data elements is set to right so the text in the table data elements are right aligned let's try and change it to left now the text is aligned on the left side to set the vertical alignment you can use the vertical align properly it can be set to top like this or middle or bottom to control the space between the border and content of a table you can use the padding property in this example the padding property is set to 15 pixels for the table data element let's try and change it areas with 50 pixels and here it is with zero you can also change the color of the border the text and the background you can change the background color by setting the background color property or you can change the color of the text by setting the color property in this example we used to set the background color and color for the table header element let's set it for the entire table you can also set the color of the border using the border property and if no color is specified for the border it uses the color of the element it's applied to in this example we've set the color text color for the table to maroon so if we remove the color from the border property the border gets a maroon color this concludes our tutorial for CSS tables but on the w3schools tutorial page you can see more examples thank you for watching
