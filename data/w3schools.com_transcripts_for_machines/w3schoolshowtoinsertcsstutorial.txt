welcome to the W3 schools tutorial on how to insert CSS when a browser reads A stylesheet it will display the document according to the information in the stylesheet but there are three ways of inserting style external stylesheet internal stylesheet and inline style an external stylesheet is a stylesheet stored in a file this is ideal when style is used by many pages with an external stylesheet you can change the look of an entire website just by changing one file the correct way to link to a stylesheet is with a link element placed in the head section of the page set the real attribute to stylesheet the type attribute to text CSS and the hre attribute to the URL of the style you want to use you must include the link element in every page you want to use the style in here is an example of an external stylesheet here you can see there are styles for the background color and the color and margin of the H1 elements an external stylesheet file like this can be written in any text editor like notepad and should only include to CSS code and it must be saved with a CSS file extension now an internal stylesheet should be used when setting the style for a single document you define the internal Styles in the head section of the HTML page inside a style tag here you can see styles for background color and the color and margin of the H1 element we can change the background color like this inline styles are set directly on the tag you want to style this loses many of the advantages with the stylesheet since we mixing content and presentation you should use this method sparingly you can see that the style is set directly on relevant element using the style attribute you set the color and margin for this H1 element you can change it like this if a style has been set for the same selector in different stylesheets the values from the most specific style will be used for example our external stylesheet my style.css which we saw earlier has the following properties for the H1 selector color Navy and margin left 20 pixels now assume that an internal sty sheet has set the color to Orange for the H1 selector what will happen if we use both these stylesheets on the same page the external stylesheet had the color of this element set to Navy a dark blue color and a left margin of 20 pixels but the text has inherited the left margin from the external Styles sheet but replaced the color with the one specified in the internal Styles sheet so multiple Styles will Cascade into one you can specify Styles directly in inside an HTML element or inside the head section of an HTML page or in an external CSS file but how do we know which style will be used when there's more than one style specified for an HTML element generally speaking we can say that all the Styles will Cascade into a new virtual style sheet where the browser default has the lowest priority then the external stylesheet then the internal stylesheet and inline style as the highest priority so an inline style will override a style defined inside the head tag or in an external Styles sheet or a browser default value in this page we have set the background color in line directly on the body element and then in in the style tag and in an external Styles sheet let's see how it works the background color showing now is a light Canan specified inline directly on the body element if we remove that the background color specified in the internal Styles sheet will show if we remove that the background color specified in the external stylesheet will show if we remove that the browser default will show let's set some of these styles again earlier I said that internal stylesheet has a higher priority than external stylesheet this isn't always the case if the link to the external stylesheet is placed after the internal stylesheet the external Styles sheet will override the internal stylesheet like this this is useful to know but it's not how CSS is normally used and this concludes our tutorial on how to insert CSS thank you for watching
