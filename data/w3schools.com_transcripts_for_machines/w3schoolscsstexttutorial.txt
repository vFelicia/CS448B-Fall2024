welcome to the w3schools CSS text tutorial you can use CSS to format text in many different ways let's go through the most common ways to format text first how to set text color you can set the color of the text with the color property in CSS a color is usually specified by either a hex value like we said for this header or an RGB value like we set for this paragraph or a color name like we set for the body element by setting the color for the body element we set the default color of the page so if we remove the styles for the other elements all elements will have the default color reset for body let's try changing it now all the elements are blue let's try to set the text alignment you can set the horizontal alignment of a text using the text align property text can be centered like this h1 element with the text aligned properly set to center or left or right aligned like this date let's try changing it from right to left or the text aligned property can be set to justify when text aligned is set to justify each line is stretched so that each line has equal width and the left and right margins are straight like in magazines or newspaper let's try resizing the browser window now the size of the space between words are changing as the browser is trying to keep the same width for all the lines you can set or remove decoration from text using the text decoration property this is mostly used to remove underlines from links for design purposes see this is a normal link and when we set text declaration none the line underneath it disappears but the link still works you can also be used to decorate text let's try to decorate h1 element see see here is a normal h1 element let's try adding line through now the text has a line through or we can add an over line now insert a line over the text or an underline in general it's not a good idea to add underlines text that is not links as it might confuse users the text transform property can be used to transform text you can turn everything into uppercase or lowercase letters or capitalize the first letter of each word these P elements all have the same text in third style differently the first one has text transform uppercase so the text is shown in all uppercase letters the second one has text transform lowercase so the text is shown in all lowercase letters the last one has text transform capitalized so the first letter of each word is capitalized let's remove the style from this paragraph and see what happens see the text is the same as it was originally now text indentation you can use the text indent property to specify the indentation of the first line of a text see the first line in this text has been given more space or been indented you can change the text in that property to change the indentation you see that's just the first line that's indented let's see how we can specify the space between characters we use the letter spacing property to set the space between characters this heading as the letter spacing 3 pixels which means there are three pixels more than usual between the characters let's try to give it some more space now this heading is the letter spacing of minus three pixels which means there are three pixels less than usual between characters if we set it to minus ten the characters will overlap on the w3schools tutorial page there are more examples and we list on the CSS text properties there's a link for each property it goes to our CSS reference where I can find information for any CSS property that this concludes our tutorial for CSS text thank you for watching
