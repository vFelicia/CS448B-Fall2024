but what if we want to play with transparency that's where rgba comes in it adds an alpha value for opacity the alpha value can be anything from 0.0 totally invisible to 1.0 completely solid let's try rgba 255 9971 0.5 for a semitransparent tomato red and that's the magic of RGB and rgba colors in CSS you can now paint your websites in any color and transparency you like experiment and have fun
