Greetings! Today's lesson Images Images can improve the design and the appearance of your web page Especially if they are pictures of majestic things See these? Well they actually look like this Let's take a look at what that means In HTML images are defined with the tag The image tag has no closing tag and is what we call an empty tag But it should contain attributes The src attribute specifies the URL or source of the image Next let's go over the alt attribute It provides an alternative text for an image This is helpful if the user cannot view the image because of slow connection, error in the src attribute , or the user has a screen reader The value of the alt attribute should describe the image. So if a browser cannot show the image it'll display the value of the alt attribute instead And the alt attribute is required for images in HTML A web page will not validate correctly without it Next, image sizes. When you start to deal with the image's width or height use the style attribute to specify it It should look like this Another way to handle this is to use the width and and height attributes Make sure to note that you should always specify the width and height of the image If they aren't specified the page might flicker while the image loads While the width height and style attributes are all valid in HTML5 we suggest using the style attribute Now moving back to the src attribute and finding the specific location of an image If not specified the browser expects to find the image in the same folder as the web page But it's common to store images in a subfolder To do so you must include the folder name in the src attribute Another way to store images is on image servers You can access the images from any web address in the world You can also use animated images No matter how you pronounce them HTML allows animated gifs and gifs like this But what if you want to use an image as a link? Just put the tag inside the tag like this To make an image float to the right or left of a text use the CSS float property. Like this Want to learn more? Float over to the CSS float tutorial Sorry I couldn't help myself But what if you wanted your image to be less functional and more aesthetic? Namely a background image to be precise To do that on an HTML element use the CSS property backgroundimage Which works like this. If you only want the background image on a paragraph specify the backgroundimage property on the P element This is covered in depth in the CSS background tutorial Now we've covered a lot in this chapter but here's one final tip Loading images takes time, and large images can slow down your page so use them carefully But some are worth it
