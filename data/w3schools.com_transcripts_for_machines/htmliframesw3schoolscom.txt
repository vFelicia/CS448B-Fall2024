Hello again Now we'll be learning about HTML iframes No they aren't the latest gadget from Apple Iframes are used to display a web page within a web page So it looks like this But how do you do this? Let's start with the iframe syntax An HTML iframe is defined with the tag which looks just like that See that src? The src attribute specifies the URL, or source, of the inline frame page Next let's tackle the height and width Use these two attributes to specify the size of the frame The attribute values are specified in pixels by default but you can also put them in percentages if you so choose Alternatively you can use CSS to set the height and width of the frame By default an iframe has a border around it To remove the border, add the style attribute and use the CSS border property Which looks like this Also with CSS you can change the size style and color of the iframes border Did you know that an iframe can be used as the target frame for a link? To do so, the target attribute of the link must refer to the name attribute of the iframe. Just like this. Simple right? Right.
