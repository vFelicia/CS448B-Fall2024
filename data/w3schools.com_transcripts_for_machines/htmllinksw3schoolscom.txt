Now today we're discussing something found in nearly all web pages Links They allow users to easily click their way from page to page To start let's discuss what HTML links are All HTML links are hyper links, they are clickable links that jump you to another document When you move the mouse over the link the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand Remember a link doesn't have to be a text it could be anything an image, a button or even me Now let's go into syntax. Now in HTML all links are defined with the tag like this The href attribute is like the road map it specifies the destination address of the link The link text is the visible part Clicking on the visible part then send you to the specified address Next we discuss local links The previous examples were using absolute URL, AKA a full web address A local link, AKA a link to the same website, is specified with a relative URL That means there's no www part like that By default a link will appear in one of three ways An unvisited link is underlined and blue A visited link is underlined and purple An active link is underlined and red But you can change the default colors by using CSS to learn more about that head to the CSS tutorial Next let's cover the target attribute. The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document It can have one of the following values "_blank" opens the linked document in in a new window or tab "_self" opens the linked document in the same window/tab as it was clicked, this is usually the default "_parent" opens the linked document in the parent frame "_top" opens the linked document in the full body of the window Lastly frame name opens the linked document in a named frame But what if you want to use images as links it's actually pretty common and should look like this As you can see we simply wrap the img element inside an a element You can add a title to a link using the title attribute The title attribute specifies extra information about an element The information is most often shown as a tool tip text when the mouse moves over the element Before we end class, let's do a quick chapter summary The a element is used to define a link The hrf attribute is used to define the link address The target attribute is used to define where to open the linked document Using the img element inside an a, will define an image as a link
