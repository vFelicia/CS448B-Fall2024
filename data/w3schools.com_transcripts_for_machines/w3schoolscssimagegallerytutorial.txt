welcome to the W3 schools CSS image gallery tutorial CSS can be used to style a page to show an image gallery let's look at the code here we have a styled image gallery if we click one of these small images we get a new page with a larger image let's remove the style and start over so we can see how it works now we have a bunch of unstyled developments with a link an image and an image description so let's start by setting the WID and height of all the containing divs like this one okay so we set the width property to 130 pixels and the height 250 pixels so let's set uh border margin and padding so we can easier see what we're working with okay now let's Center align the content of the containing divis and Float all the divs next to each other set float left now we're getting closer to what we want um let's set some margin around these images since they're a bit close to the top here let's style the description text as well we'll start by Center aligning it and give it a fixed WID and the same margin as the image now I want to add an effect when we Mouse over the divs so we can see what we are selecting going to change this Hoover effect cuz I want to style the containing div and not the link itself so I set the Hoover effect for the div and I want to change the background color to light blue now we can clearly see which image we're selecting when we Hoover now we have a CSS styled image gallery where the containing elements float nicely when we resize the browser or look at it in different size browser windows this concludes udes our tutorial for CSS image gallery thank you for watching
