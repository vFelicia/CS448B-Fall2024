Hey there, color coders! Today, we're diving into the colorful world of CSS HEX colors! Imagine your computer screen is a giant box of crayons. Hex colors help us tell the computer which crayons to pick to color our websites! Each Hex color starts with a 'hashtag', followed by 6 letters or numbers. These pairs are placeholders for Red, Green and Blue. They tell our computer how much of each color to mix together. Unlike the values for RGB, hexadecimal, or Hex values go from 0 to F. This means that they can represent the same values as 0 to 255 with two digits instead of three. Let's decode these crayon labels, shall we? HEX values range from 00 to FF. That's like going from no color at all to the brightest shade! For example, #FF0000 is a bright red, because it's all red with no green or blue. Black is like turning off all colors with #000000. And white? It's like turning them all the way up with #FFFFFF! Now, let's play mad scientist and mix our own colors! Take #90EE90 for instance. It's a nice light green because it has some red, a lot of green, and some blue. Now, let's play mad scientist and mix our own colors! Take hashtag 90 EE 90 for instance. It's a nice light green because it has some red, a lot of green, and some blue. By changing these values, we can create every color you can think of! From sea green (#3CB371) to violet (#EE82EE). Want to see something cool? Shades of gray are super easy! Just use equal amounts of all three colors. Like #787878; it's a perfect midtone gray! And guess what? When you're feeling a bit lazy, you can use a shortcut! #RGB is the same as repeating each digit. So, #F0C is really #FF00CC! It's like texting 'LOL' instead of 'laugh out loud.' Saves time and works just the same!! Alright, superstars, that's a wrap on CSS HEX colors! Now go out there and paint the digital world with your new knowledge! Thanks for watching!
