welcome to the Doubletree school's CSS navigation bar tutorial having easytouse navigation is important for any website so in this tutorial I will show you how to style a list of links into a navigation bar like this a navigation bar needs standard HTML as a base and since the navigation bar is basically a list of links using the UL and Li elements makes perfect sense so here we have a list of links the regular style so it looks like navigation bar let's start by removing the list markers since the navigation bar will not need them so we set the list style type to none and then we set the margins and padding to zero to remove any browser default and now we have a list of links that we can use as our base for our navigation bar let's start by building a vertical navigation bar so we need to style the links or a elements so let's start by setting this play lock of displaying the links as block elements we'll make the whole area clickable and not just the text it also allows us to specify the width and since block elements take up the full width available by default I want to specify a width a suit sauce now we set the width to 120 pixels and you can see that not just the text is clickable but the whole were 120 pixel area let's add some background color and change the color of the text now let's remove the underline from the links and center align the text now we want to text to be bolder and we wanted to show in all uppercase case letters now let's give the text some space by adding padding now we want to add some interactivity on the background color to change when the user Mouse's over a link so the style rule we created we want to change it to apply to link and visit it that means unvisited and listed links I want to create a new rule for Hoover and active where the background color changes to green or specifically a darker green now we have a fully style vertical menu let's leave this example for now and see how we can create a horizontal navigation bar there are two ways to create a horizontal navigation bar using inline or floating list items let's see how we can use inline list items here we have a horizontal linked list it's been created by setting display inline for the list item elements by default list item elements are block elements by setting it to inline we remove the line breaks before and after each list item and display them on one line however we can't use this method if you want the links to have equal width since an inline element cannot have width so let's go back to our previous example where we created a vertical navigation bar and see if we can change it to horizontal here we have links we would equal width since the a elements have been set to display block and as a specify width now if we float these list item elements they will slide next to each other let's see we started to float left and the items will prepare next to each other on the horizontal line so now we have a fully style horizontal navigation bar this concludes our tutorial for CSS navigation bar thank you for watching
