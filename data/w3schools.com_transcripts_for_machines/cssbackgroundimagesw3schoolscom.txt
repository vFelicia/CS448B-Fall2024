Hey coders! Welcome back to our channel! Today, we're looking at CSS background images! Imagine you're painting a picture. Instead of using just plain paint, you decide to start with a patterned canvas. That's exactly what the backgroundimage property does in CSS. It lets you specify an image to use as the background of an element. Let's start simple.

You can also set background images for specific elements like paragraphs. Background images can transform your website from plain to eyecatching, just be mindful of your content readability!
