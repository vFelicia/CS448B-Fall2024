Welcome back, creative coders! Today we're looking at CSS backgrounds and specifically background colors! Imagine you're making a digital masterpiece. The first thing you need is somewhere to make it. In CSS, that is any HTML element, and background colors are your paint! Let's start with the basics. First up, backgroundcolor. This property colors our HTML elements. Here, we just turned the whole page light blue. Pretty, isn't it? You can specify colors using names like “red”, HEX codes like “#FF0000”, or RGB values like “rgb(255, 0, 0)”. For a full palette, check out our CSS Color chapters! Now, let's color more elements. Easy, right? Each element gets its own splash of color. Sometimes you want to see through your paint, using opacity. Opacity values range from 0, fully transparent, to 1, fully opaque. Notice how this makes everything in the semitransparent, including text! To avoid making the text transparent, we specify that the color is transparent, instead of the element. Here, only the background is semitransparent, not the text. We use RGBA instead of RGB, so we can adjust the Alpha Channel, or opacity. That's your quick tour of CSS backgrounds!
