welcome to the w3schools CSS positioning tutorial the CSS positioning properties allow you to position an element it can also place an element behind another specify what should happen when an elements content is too big elements are positioned using the top bottom left and right properties however these properties will have no effect unless the position property is set first they also work differently depending on the positioning methods there are four different positioning methods let's start static positioning all HTML elements are positioned static by default a static positioned element is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page look at these P elements they appear one after the other this is what we call normal flow elements we position static are not affected by the top bottom left and right properties now let's look at fixed positioning element with a fixed position is position relative to the browser window like this P element the position property is set to fixed and its position 30 pixels from the top of the page 5 pixels from the right of the page it will not move even if the window is scrolled elements with fixed position are removed from the normal flow so the document and the other elements behave like the fixed positioned element does not exist since they are removed from the normal flow elements with fixed position can overlap other elements by this I see that the text overlaps the other elements let's look at relative positioning a relative position element is positioned relative to its normal position this heading is moved right according to its normal position its position property is set to relative and it's left property is set to 20 pixels so it's positioned 20 pixels from the left relative to its normal position let's try moving it now this heading is smooth left according to its normal position smooth by setting the left property to minus 20 pixels so its position minus 20 pixels relative to its normal left position let's try moving that to relative position elements can be moved and overlap other elements but to reserve space for the element still preserved in the normal flow let's see what happens if we overlap two elements here now these two elements overlap but the reserved space for the element is still preserved now let's look at absolute positioning element with an absolute position is positioned relative to the first parent element that has a position other than static this heading has some absolute position but it has no parent elements with a position other than static so it's positioned relative to the page as position absolute and let's position 100 pixels from the left and 150 pixels from top let's try moving it around now it's positioned 200 pixels from the left and 200 pixels from the top of the page absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow so the document and other elements behave like the absolute position element does not exist since they are removed from the normal flow elements with absolute positioning can overlap other elements like this let's look a bit closer at overlapping elements when elements are positioned outside the normal flow they can overlap other elements the set index property specifies stack order of elements this is how you specify which element should be placed in front of or behind other elements an element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with lower stack order an element can have both a positive or negative stack order now we change the stack order for this image from minus 1 to 1 and now it appears in front of the text but what happens if the content of element is too big to fit in the specified place the overflow property specifies what to do if the content of an element is bigger than the elements box here the overflow property is set to scroll so the content that won't fit is still there but you have to scroll to see it air the old flow property is set to hidden so the content that won't fit is hidden from the user the default value is visible if the overflow is set to visible the content that won't fit overflows from its box on the w3schools tutorial page there are more examples and we list all the CSS positioning properties and there's a link for each property that goes to our CSS reference where we can find more information for any CSS property and this concludes our tutorial for CSS positioning thank you for watching
