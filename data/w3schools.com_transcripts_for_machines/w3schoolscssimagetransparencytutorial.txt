welcome to w3schools CSS image opacity or transparency tutorial creating transparent images with CSS is easy just use the opacity property from css3 this is a regular image and this is the same image with transparency let's look at the code all major browsers use the opacity property for transparency the opacity property can take values from zero point zero to one point zero a lower value makes the element more transparent and the higher value makes the element less transparent Internet Explorer 8 and earlier versions use filteralpha opacity this can take a value from 0 to 100 where 0 is full transparency and 100 is no transparency for these images we've used two pseudo class hover to change the transparency when you mouse over the images let's look at the code the first CSS rule is very similar to the code within example 1 in addition we've added what should happen when a user hovers or Mouse's over one of the images in this case we want the image to not be transparent when a user hovers over it CSS for this is opacity equals 1.0 for Internet Explorer 8 and earlier its opacity equals 100 so when we mouse over the image is not transparent but when the mouse pointer moves away from the image the image will be transparent again and changed values set the default do not be transparent and when we hover over the image it's very transparent like this here is some text placed in a transparent box the source code looks like this first we create a development class equals background set this to a fixed width and height set a background image these flowers and a border then we create a smaller div inside the first development set this class to trams box for transparent box as fixed width and height a margin white background color a border and it's transparent inside the transparent div we have a P element with some text in it the text is a bit hard to read so let's make the transparent div a little less transparent how the text is easier to read this concludes our tutorial for CSS image opacity or transparency thank you for watching
