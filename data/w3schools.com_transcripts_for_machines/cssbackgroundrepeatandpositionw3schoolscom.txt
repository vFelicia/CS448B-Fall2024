Hey, tech enthusiasts! Lets take a look at how to control the repeating and positioning of CSS background images! First up, the CSS backgroundrepeat property. By default, a background image will repeat itself both horizontally and vertically across your webpage. Look at our example. If we don’t specify anything else, our lovely gradient background will tile all over, which can get a bit... overwhelming. But what if we only want it to repeat horizontally? Easy peasy! We use repeatx. backgroundrepeat repeatx; And just like that, our gradient looks sleek across the width without invading the space above and below! Quick tip! To repeat an image just vertically, switch repeatx to repeaty. Super handy for those long scrolling pages! Now, let's say you want the background image to appear just once. No problem! Set backgroundrepeat to norepeat. backgroundrepeat norepeat; Perfect for that stunning image you want to show just once! Finally, positioning. Where your image sits can make or break your design. Use backgroundposition to set your stage perfectly. backgroundrepeat norepeat; backgroundposition right top; And voilà! Our tree now peeks from the top right, complementing rather than competing with our text. And there you have it! Repeat and position your background images like a pro! Thanks for watching!
