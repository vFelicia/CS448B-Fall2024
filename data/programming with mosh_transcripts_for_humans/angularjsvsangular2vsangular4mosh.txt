00:01 - one question that often comes up is
00:03 - what's the difference between angularjs
00:06 - angular 2 and angular for and how did we
00:09 - jump from angular 2 to angular 4 well
00:12 - angularjs was introduced in 2010 as a
00:16 - JavaScript framework for building client
00:19 - applications soon it gained popularity
00:21 - an angular team started adding new
00:24 - features to the core but the framework
00:26 - was not designed with the needs of
00:28 - today's applications in mind plus it was
00:31 - overly complex so angular team decided
00:35 - to rewrite the original framework using
00:37 - typescript and as a result angular 2
00:40 - came out in mid 2016 this new version is
00:44 - entirely different from angular 1 to the
00:47 - extent that you can think of it as a
00:49 - completely different framework now this
00:52 - made a lot of developers unhappy because
00:54 - they had a lot of applications built
00:56 - with angular 1 with each application
00:59 - over a few thousand lines of code that
01:01 - had to be rewritten but overall I
01:04 - personally like the direction that
01:06 - angular team took and how they rebuilt
01:08 - angular with typescript this is a much
01:11 - better framework it's a lot cleaner and
01:13 - it's a lot easier to understand and to
01:15 - work with now after a few minor upgrades
01:19 - to angular 2 something strange happened
01:21 - we were up to angular 2.3 and then all
01:24 - of a sudden and your 4 came out so a lot
01:27 - of developers including myself wondered
01:30 - what happened to angular 3 we thought we
01:33 - made something really big here but
01:35 - unlike angular 2 angular 4 was not a new
01:38 - framework with a lot of breaking changes
01:40 - in fact it wasn't even a major upgrade
01:42 - so let me explain what happened
01:45 - angular consists of a few different
01:47 - libraries that are distributed as
01:49 - separate node packages via NPM for
01:53 - example we have the core library that we
01:55 - use in every application we have angular
01:58 - compiler we have angular HTTP for
02:00 - calling HTTP services we have angular
02:04 - router for adding navigation to
02:06 - applications and a few other libraries
02:08 - now all these libraries were version the
02:11 - same except the router library
02:14 - so in order to align these versions and
02:17 - avoid confusion in the future angular
02:19 - team decided to go straight to angular
02:22 - version 4 so in a sense angular 4 is not
02:25 - a major upgrade to angular 2 and you can
02:28 - think of it as angular 2.4 as simple as
02:30 - that
02:31 - now after all this confusion in the
02:33 - community about angular versions the
02:36 - team decided to drop the version suffix
02:38 - and simply call the framework angular so
02:41 - now we have two kinds of angular we have
02:44 - angularjs which is the first generation
02:46 - of angular written in JavaScript and
02:49 - it's going to die sooner or later and we
02:52 - also have angular which refers to
02:54 - angular 2 or later in our discussions in
02:57 - our articles and whenever we want to
03:00 - talk about angular 2 or later we should
03:02 - really use the word angular like I'm
03:04 - gonna angular developer instead of I'm
03:07 - gonna angular 2 developer or I'm an
03:09 - angular 4 developer C it's really weird
03:11 - we should use versions only when we need
03:14 - to talk about a specific release for
03:17 - example when we want to upgrade angular
03:19 - 4 to angular 5 then everybody knows what
03:23 - is the scope of this upgrade and what
03:25 - are the potential breaking changes that
03:27 - can impact an application so this is all
03:30 - about angular version history hi thank

one question that often comes up is what's the difference between angularjs angular 2 and angular for and how did we jump from angular 2 to angular 4 well angularjs was introduced in 2010 as a JavaScript framework for building client applications soon it gained popularity an angular team started adding new features to the core but the framework was not designed with the needs of today's applications in mind plus it was overly complex so angular team decided to rewrite the original framework using typescript and as a result angular 2 came out in mid 2016 this new version is entirely different from angular 1 to the extent that you can think of it as a completely different framework now this made a lot of developers unhappy because they had a lot of applications built with angular 1 with each application over a few thousand lines of code that had to be rewritten but overall I personally like the direction that angular team took and how they rebuilt angular with typescript this is a much better framework it's a lot cleaner and it's a lot easier to understand and to work with now after a few minor upgrades to angular 2 something strange happened we were up to angular 2.3 and then all of a sudden and your 4 came out so a lot of developers including myself wondered what happened to angular 3 we thought we made something really big here but unlike angular 2 angular 4 was not a new framework with a lot of breaking changes in fact it wasn't even a major upgrade so let me explain what happened angular consists of a few different libraries that are distributed as separate node packages via NPM for example we have the core library that we use in every application we have angular compiler we have angular HTTP for calling HTTP services we have angular router for adding navigation to applications and a few other libraries now all these libraries were version the same except the router library so in order to align these versions and avoid confusion in the future angular team decided to go straight to angular version 4 so in a sense angular 4 is not a major upgrade to angular 2 and you can think of it as angular 2.4 as simple as that now after all this confusion in the community about angular versions the team decided to drop the version suffix and simply call the framework angular so now we have two kinds of angular we have angularjs which is the first generation of angular written in JavaScript and it's going to die sooner or later and we also have angular which refers to angular 2 or later in our discussions in our articles and whenever we want to talk about angular 2 or later we should really use the word angular like I'm gonna angular developer instead of I'm gonna angular 2 developer or I'm an angular 4 developer C it's really weird we should use versions only when we need to talk about a specific release for example when we want to upgrade angular 4 to angular 5 then everybody knows what is the scope of this upgrade and what are the potential breaking changes that can impact an application so this is all about angular version history hi thank you for watching my angular tutorial if you enjoyed this video please like it and share it with others also you can subscribe to my channel for free new videos every week this video is part of my complete angular course with almost 30 hours of high quality content where you learn everything about angular from the basic to the advanced topics all in one course so you don't have to jump from one tutorial to another in case you're interested you can get this course with a big discount using the link in the video description and if not that's perfectly fine continue watching as the next section is coming up
