00:00 - hey guys maash here today we're gonna
00:03 - talk about bubble sort bubble sort is
00:05 - one of the many sorting algorithms that
00:07 - come up in coding interviews all the
00:09 - time in fact these days more and more
00:11 - companies ask data structure and
00:13 - algorithm questions in their interviews
00:15 - to see if you can think like a
00:17 - programmer in this video I'm gonna show
00:19 - you how bubble sort works and how you
00:21 - can implement it in Java if you don't
00:23 - know Java that's perfectly fine you can
00:24 - still follow along and implement the
00:26 - bubble sort algorithm in your favorite
00:28 - programming language also if you want to
00:30 - learn Java I have a comprehensive to our
00:33 - tutorial for you here on my channel the
00:35 - link is below this video so let's jump
00:37 - in and get started the first sorting
00:50 - algorithm we're going to talk about is
00:51 - bubble sort which is the simplest of all
00:54 - sorting algorithms let's say we have an
00:56 - area of integers and we want to sort
00:58 - this array in increasing order with
01:00 - bubble sort algorithm we scan the array
01:02 - from left to right and if items are out
01:05 - of order we swap them so we start off by
01:08 - comparing the items at index 0 & 1 if
01:11 - the right item is smaller than the left
01:12 - item we swap them because we want to
01:15 - sort this array in ascending order so
01:17 - here to smaller than 8 and we have to
01:20 - swap them now we compare the items at
01:22 - index 1 and 2 again the right item is
01:25 - smaller so we have to swap these items
01:28 - as well one more time again we have to
01:30 - swap these items and one last time ok
01:34 - this was our first iteration or first
01:36 - pass we need multiple passes to fully
01:39 - sort this array at the end of each pass
01:41 - the next largest item moves to its
01:44 - correct position so here 8 is in the
01:46 - correct position this is why we call
01:48 - this algorithm bubble sort because after
01:51 - each pass the next largest item bubbles
01:53 - up and moves to its correct position so
01:56 - in the next pass the next largest item
01:58 - which is 4 will bubble up let me show
02:00 - you once again we compare the items at
02:02 - index 0 and 1 these items are in the
02:05 - right order because 4 is greater than 2
02:07 - so we don't need to swap them let's look
02:10 - at the next two items 1 is smaller than
02:12 - 4 so we should
02:13 - design ups and one more time again these
02:17 - items are out of order so we need to
02:19 - swap them and the last two items these
02:22 - items are in the right order so we're
02:24 - done with the second pass now for is in
02:26 - the right position as you can see our
02:29 - array is almost sorted we just need one
02:31 - more pass to swap two and one and then
02:34 - our array will be fully sorted so let's
02:36 - do that real quick all right our array
02:39 - is fully sorted now let's talk about
02:42 - time complexity if you're not familiar
02:44 - with this concept you need to go back to
02:46 - part 1 of this series where I talk about
02:48 - Big O notation so what's the time
02:51 - complexity here well in the best-case
02:53 - scenario where our array is already
02:55 - sorted we need a single pass in the
02:58 - worst case scenario the array is sorted
03:00 - in reverse order here we need n passes
03:03 - now in each pass we need n comparisons
03:06 - well more accurately n minus 1
03:09 - comparisons so if you have 4 items we
03:11 - need 3 comparisons right so bubble sort
03:14 - runs in O of N or linear time in the
03:17 - best-case scenario and oo of N squared
03:20 - or quadratic time in the worst-case
03:22 - scenario if you go too big a cheat sheet
03:25 - comm you can see a visual representation
03:28 - of these growth rates as you can see all
03:30 - of N squared is very inefficient because
03:33 - it's in the red area so this algorithm
03:35 - gets real slow as the amount of input
03:37 - data grows later I will show you better
03:40 - sorting algorithms that run in the
03:41 - orange or yellow areas but before we get
03:44 - there let's implement bubble sorting
03:46 - code so pause the video spend 20 minutes
03:49 - and try to implement bubble sort on your
03:51 - own then come back see my implementation
03:55 - you
03:59 - all right here in our project let's add
04:01 - in your class we call it bubble sort in
04:06 - this class we need one method public
04:08 - void sort we give it an integer array
04:11 - and call it array a here we need a loop
04:15 - to iterate over this array multiple
04:17 - times in each iteration the next largest
04:20 - item will bubble up and move to its
04:22 - correct position
04:23 - so a typical for loop for I we set it to
04:27 - 0 as long as it's less than array dot
04:30 - lengths incremented after each iteration
04:34 - now here we did a second loop and we use
04:37 - this loop to compare every two items of
04:39 - this array so let's call this loop
04:42 - variable J we can set it to zero and
04:45 - start from the first item or one and
04:48 - start from the second item so here we'll
04:50 - compare the second item with the
04:52 - previous item okay
04:53 - so we said J 2 1 as long as J is less
04:56 - than a rate that length
04:58 - we're incremented after each iteration
05:00 - now in each iteration and we're going to
05:02 - compare the item at index J with the
05:05 - previous item so if array of J it's
05:10 - smaller than the previous item that
05:14 - means these two items are out of order
05:16 - so we need to swap them how do we do
05:19 - that
05:19 - real easy we've done this before so we
05:22 - use a temporary variable and copy array
05:26 - of J into this variable then we set
05:30 - array of j to array of j minus 1
05:35 - I'll finally whatever we have stored in
05:37 - a tent variable we use that to set array
05:39 - of J minus one so a rate of J minus 1
05:44 - equals temp that's our bubble sort now I
05:48 - prefer to extract these three lines into
05:50 - a separate method called swap this will
05:53 - make our code cleaner and more readable
05:55 - so let's declare a private method here
05:59 - private void swap we need to pass our
06:04 - integer array and two indexes so index 1
06:08 - and index 2
06:13 - now once again use a temporary variable
06:15 - so we set temp to array of index 1 then
06:19 - we set array of index 1 to array of
06:22 - index 2 and finally we said I already
06:25 - have index 2 to temp right now back to
06:32 - our sort method instead of this Reliance
06:34 - we can call swap pass or array and two
06:39 - indexes J and J minus 1 now because we
06:42 - have a single statement here I would
06:44 - prefer to get rid of this ugly curly
06:46 - braces that is better so we're done with
06:50 - this implementation now let's test it
06:52 - back to the main class let's declare an
06:56 - integer array called numbers and set it
07:00 - to 7 3 1 4 6 2 and let's add a duplicate
07:05 - like 3 now we create a sorter object we
07:10 - set it to a new bubble sort and here we
07:13 - call sorter that's sort pass the numbers
07:17 - array here and finally we're gonna print
07:19 - this on the terminal so here we use
07:22 - arrays dot to string to convert this
07:26 - array into a string so we pass the
07:28 - numbers array and run our program so as
07:33 - you can see our array is sorted
07:36 - now let's test the edge cases what if we
07:38 - have let's say only two numbers here our
07:44 - algorithm still works beautiful but if
07:46 - you have a single number still working
07:50 - beautiful what if you have an empty
07:51 - array no problem
07:55 - so we have successfully implemented
07:57 - bubble sort but there are a couple of
07:59 - places where we can optimize our
08:01 - implementation let me show you so back
08:04 - to our bubble sort class here we are
08:07 - assuming that we need n iterations to
08:09 - sort this array but what if our array is
08:11 - already sorted or partially sorted then
08:14 - we're not going to need n iterations we
08:16 - need fewer iterations so here I'm going
08:18 - to declare a boolean variable called is
08:22 - sorted now in every iteration you want
08:26 - to set this to true and assume that the
08:28 - array is sorted if our assumption is
08:30 - correct then we'll return immediately so
08:33 - let's add curly braces here in every
08:37 - iteration first we set is sorted to true
08:41 - we assume that the array is sorted now
08:43 - we start comparing items if we end up
08:46 - swapping two items that means our
08:48 - assumption was wrong so right after
08:51 - swapping we need to set is sorted to
08:55 - false however if we don't do any swaps
08:58 - that means our array is fully sorted so
09:01 - after this for loop we can write an if
09:04 - statement if there is sorted we can
09:08 - return immediately there's no need to
09:10 - iterate over this array one more time
09:12 - that is one optimization we also have
09:15 - another optimization look at this inner
09:17 - loop here we are going through the
09:19 - entire array comparing every two items
09:22 - but as you learned in every iteration in
09:24 - every pass the next largest item bubbles
09:27 - up and moves to its correct position so
09:29 - we don't really need to compare all the
09:32 - items in this array we only need to
09:34 - compare all the items that are not in
09:36 - the correct position so in our first
09:39 - pass no items are in the correct
09:40 - position that means we should iterate
09:42 - over all the items in this array in the
09:45 - second iteration one of the items is in
09:47 - the correct position so we need to look
09:49 - at all the
09:50 - except the last item so here we can
09:54 - change this expression to a rate that
09:56 - length minus PI again in the first
10:00 - iteration I is zero so we're going to
10:02 - look at all the items in this array in
10:04 - the second iteration I is one so we'll
10:07 - look at all the items except the last
10:09 - item so these optimizations make this
10:12 - algorithm run a little bit faster but
10:14 - it's time complexity is still o of N
10:17 - squared
10:20 - hey guys mahir I wanted to let you know

hey guys maash here today we're gonna talk about bubble sort bubble sort is one of the many sorting algorithms that come up in coding interviews all the time in fact these days more and more companies ask data structure and algorithm questions in their interviews to see if you can think like a programmer in this video I'm gonna show you how bubble sort works and how you can implement it in Java if you don't know Java that's perfectly fine you can still follow along and implement the bubble sort algorithm in your favorite programming language also if you want to learn Java I have a comprehensive to our tutorial for you here on my channel the link is below this video so let's jump in and get started the first sorting algorithm we're going to talk about is bubble sort which is the simplest of all sorting algorithms let's say we have an area of integers and we want to sort this array in increasing order with bubble sort algorithm we scan the array from left to right and if items are out of

smaller than 8 and we have to swap them now we compare the items at index 1 and 2 again the right item is smaller so we have to swap these items as well one more time again we have to swap these items and one last time ok this was our first iteration or first pass we need multiple passes to fully sort this array at the end of each pass the next largest item moves to its correct position so here 8 is in the correct position this is why we call this algorithm bubble sort because after each pass the next largest item bubbles up and moves to its correct position so in the next pass the next largest item which is 4 will bubble up let me show you once again we compare the items at index 0 and 1 these items are in the right order because 4 is greater than 2 so we don't need to swap them let's look at the next two items 1 is smaller than 4 so we should design ups and one more time again these items are out of order so we need to swap them and the last two items these items are in the right order so we're done with the second pass now for is in the right position as you can see our array is almost sorted we just need one more pass to swap two and one and then our array will be fully sorted so let's do that real quick all right our array is fully sorted now let's talk about time complexity if you're not familiar with this concept you need to go back to part 1 of this series where I talk about Big O notation so what's the time complexity here well in the bestcase scenario where our array is already sorted we need a single pass in the worst case scenario the array is

in O of N or linear time in the bestcase scenario and oo of N squared or quadratic time in the worstcase scenario if you go too big a cheat sheet comm you can see a visual representation of these growth rates as you can see all of N squared is very inefficient because it's in the red area so this algorithm gets real slow as the amount of input data grows later I will show you better sorting algorithms that run in the orange or yellow areas but before we get there let's implement bubble sorting code so pause the video spend 20 minutes and try to implement bubble sort on your own then come back see my implementation you all right here in our project let's add in your class we call it bubble sort in this class we need one method public void sort we give it an integer array and call it array a here we need a loop to iterate over this array multiple times in each iteration the next largest item will bubble up and move to its correct position so a typical for loop for I we set it to 0 as long as it's less than array dot lengths incremented after each iteration now here we did a second loop and we use this loop to compare every two items of this array so let's call this loop variable J we can set it to zero and start from the first item or one and start from the second item so here we'll compare the second item with the previous item okay so we said J 2 1 as long as J is less than a rate that length we're incremented after each iteration now in each iteration and we're going to compare the item at index J with the previous item so if array of J it's smaller than the previous item that means these two items are out of order so we need to swap them how do we do that real easy we've done this before so we use a temporary variable and copy array of J into this
