00:00 - Are you wondering what JavaScript
framework or library you should learn to
00:03 - land a job in 2019? Let me help you out.
In this five-minute video, I'm gonna
00:08 - quickly compare the top three JavaScript
frameworks, we're gonna look at their
00:12 - history, their job market, their learning
curve and then I'm gonna tell you what
00:16 - framework to learn to get a front-end or
full stack development job in 2019. First
00:21 - let me get the terminology clear what is
the difference between a library and a
00:25 - framework some developers use these
terms interchangeably but they're
00:29 - actually different a library is a
collection of reusable code that is used
00:33 - to solve common problems there are
various libraries out there for solving
00:37 - different types of problems for example
we have libraries for performing
00:41 - mathematical calculations we have
libraries for machine learning and so on
00:45 - react is a library for building
interactive user interfaces if framework
00:51 - on the other hand gives us a lot of
reusable code just like a library but it
00:55 - also provides a structure or a skeleton
for building applications so when using
01:00 - a framework we have to build our
application according to that framework
01:04 - frameworks have opinions in terms of how
we should structure our application how
01:08 - the application should get started how
various components should interact with
01:12 - each other and so on angular and view
are both examples of popular frameworks
01:17 - for building front-end applications now
one of the questions I get a lot is
01:22 - Masch why do we have to use a framework
or a library to build an application can
01:27 - we just use plain old JavaScript the
answer is yes we certainly can it's a
01:32 - waste of time
here is the reason imagine you want to
01:35 - build a desk
would you buy pieces of wood and put
01:38 - them together or would you go to the
forest and cut the trees first there is
01:42 - no reason to cut the trees when there
are already pieces of wood ready for us
01:47 - to reuse we use frameworks and libraries
to increase our productivity and speed
01:51 - up the development process there is a
lot of code that is tested and is ready
01:56 - for us to reuse so this is all about
libraries and frameworks now react
02:01 - angular and view are the top three tools
for building applications these days but
02:06 - which one is better let's find out
look at the results of this deck
02:10 - overflow developer server in 2019 that
just
02:13 - came out here's the list of the most
loved web frameworks and the winner is
02:18 - react it is closely followed by view
this year and angular seems to be losing
02:23 - its popularity compared to previous
years if you look at Google Trends you
02:27 - can see that react is the most popular
library out of the three now let's have
02:32 - a quick look at the history of these
frameworks angular is the oldest of the
02:36 - three it's developed by Google and was
initially released in 2010 until 2016 it
02:42 - used to be called angularjs in 2016
angular team released angular 2 which
02:48 - was a complete rewrite of angularjs in
fact it had nothing in common with the
02:53 - previous version of angular it was a
completely new framework so to reduce
02:57 - confusion angular team decided to drop
the jas from the original name and they
03:03 - called the new framework angular this
made a lot of developers unhappy any
03:08 - applications that were built with
angularjs had to be rebuilt with angular
03:12 - also over the last three years there
have been several releases of angular
03:16 - and we have experienced several breaking
changes as an online instructor this
03:21 - made me very unhappy because my angular
course got outdated pretty quickly and I
03:26 - had to do a lot of patches to the course
and at some point I ended up recreating
03:30 - the entire course from scratch but it
came soon after the course got out beta
03:34 - react is developed and maintained by
Facebook and it's been around since 2013
03:39 - currently it's at version 16 and is
being used by Facebook Twitter Netflix
03:45 - PayPal and uber to name a few
it has a huge community which means
03:49 - somebody out there has already solved
the problems you may encounter so there
03:54 - are tons of third-party libraries
packages tools extensions as well as
03:58 - tutorials and courses view or view Jas
is the youngest kid in town
04:03 - unlike angular and react view isn't
developed by a big corporation it was
04:08 - originally developed by an ex-googler
employee in 2014 and now it's maintained
04:13 - by a group of passionate developers even
though it's a new framework it has
04:17 - gained a lot of popularity over the past
two years now what about the job market
04:21 - well this really depends on where you
are located so wherever you are look at
04:27 - the
number of jobs advertised and the most
04:29 - popular job seeking website here is the
number of jobs advertised on indeed.com
04:33 - in the US right now in April 2019 they
are roughly about fifty nine thousand
04:40 - react jobs followed by fourteen thousand
angular jobs and three thousand view
04:44 - jobs based on the popularity of react I
would say that you would probably see
04:49 - the same pattern in other countries in
the world but that's just my guess so if
04:53 - you're looking for a job in the u.s.
react is definitely the way to go
04:56 - now what about the learning curve well
angular has always been famous for
05:01 - having a steep learning curve
because it's a full-blown framework or a
05:05 - complete solution in contrast because
react is just a library and not a
05:09 - complete solution it has fewer concepts
that you need to learn and understand I
05:14 - would say learning view requires roughly
the same amount of time and effort it's
05:18 - definitely easier to learn than angular
some argue that it's even easier than
05:22 - react but it's very subjective so if
you're starting out I would say start
05:27 - with react because it's definitely
easier to learn than angular and it
05:30 - gives you tons more job opportunities
once you learn react if you want to
05:34 - expand your career options or if you're
just curious you can learn view
05:38 - transitioning from reactive view is
fairly easy and I personally think that
05:43 - going forward we're gonna see more job
opportunities for view in 2019 and 2020
05:48 - another benefit of learning react is
that you can quickly learn react native
05:51 - to build mobile apps react native is the
king of cross-platform development so
05:57 - again you will have plenty more job
opportunities ahead of you so if you're
06:01 - looking for a job as a front-end or a
full-stack developer invest your time
06:05 - and energy in react now how do you learn
react I have a comprehensive - our
06:10 - tutorial on my channel you can see it
over here I've also put the link down
06:14 - below this tutorial walks you through
all the core concepts and react even
06:18 - though I made it last year in 2018 it's
still valid and up to date because react
06:22 - is a stable library and you won't
encounter breaking changes Facebook
06:27 - takes the stability of react seriously
so watch this tutorial first but if you
06:31 - want to master react I had a complete
course for you that is 12 hours long it
06:36 - goes far beyond my youtube tutorial and
touches on concepts such as
06:40 - Bill
complex user interfaces routing and
06:43 - navigation calling back and api's
authentication and authorization
06:47 - handling and login errors and deployment
pretty much all the concepts involved in
06:52 - building real applications in this
course you will learn how to build a
06:56 - real video rental application with a
node back-end this is an online video
07:00 - course just like my youtube tutorial and
you can watch it anytime anywhere as
07:04 - many times as you want you will also
receive a certificate of completion at
07:08 - the end that you can add to your resume
we even offer a 30-day money-back
07:12 - guarantee if you're interested use the
