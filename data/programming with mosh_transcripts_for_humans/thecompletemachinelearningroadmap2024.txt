00:00 - if you want to become a machine learning
00:01 - engineer there are nine essential skills
00:03 - you need to master let's go over them
00:05 - one by
00:08 - one now machine learning involves
00:10 - creating models that learn from data to
00:12 - make predictions or decisions as a
00:15 - machine learning engineer you'll need to
00:16 - master various skills from programming
00:19 - and math to deploying models first up
00:21 - you need to get proficient with python
00:23 - it's the primary language used in
00:24 - machine learning it's pretty simple and
00:26 - you can get a decent grasp of it in
00:28 - about a month or two now some jobs might
00:30 - ask for other languages like Java r or
00:33 - C++ for performance reasons but as a
00:36 - beginner just stick to python don't
00:37 - overwhelm Yourself by trying to learn
00:39 - everything at once focus on mastering
00:41 - python first the next thing you need to
00:43 - learn is a version control system like
00:45 - git git is not a programming language
00:47 - it's a tool we use to track changes to
00:49 - our code and collaborate with others git
00:52 - has a ton of features but you don't need
00:53 - to learn all of them think of it like
00:55 - the 8020 rule 80% of the time you use
00:58 - 20% of GS features so one to two weeks
01:00 - of practice is enough to get up and
01:02 - running next you need to dive into data
01:05 - structures and algorithms I know a lot
01:07 - of self-taught Engineers skip this step
01:09 - but trust me it's super important first
01:11 - off understanding these Concepts will
01:13 - really boost your problem solving skills
01:15 - which is key for tackling complex
01:17 - challenges plus big tech companies like
01:19 - Google Amazon and Facebook love to ask
01:22 - about data structures and algorithms in
01:24 - job interviews also using the right data
01:27 - structures helps you manage large data
01:29 - sets efficiently and keeps your
01:30 - algorithms running smoothly so spend
01:32 - about a month or two on this and you'll
01:35 - be in a great shape next you need to get
01:37 - comfortable with SQL SQL stands for
01:39 - structured query language it's a very
01:41 - simple language we use for working with
01:43 - databases as a machine learning engineer
01:45 - you should know how to use SQL to access
01:48 - and organize the data you need for your
01:50 - models SQL is pretty simple and you can
01:52 - get a decent grasp of it in about a
01:54 - month or two now by the way to help you
01:56 - on this journey I've created a free
01:58 - supplementary PDF that breaks down the
02:01 - specific Concepts you need to learn for
02:02 - each skill it's a great resource to
02:04 - review your progress find gaps in your
02:06 - knowledge and prepare for interviews you
02:08 - can find the link in the description box
02:10 - also I have a bunch of tutorials on this
02:12 - channel and complete courses on my
02:14 - website if you're looking for a
02:15 - structured learning again links are in
02:17 - the description box the next thing you
02:19 - need is a solid foundation in
02:21 - mathematics and statistics this is
02:23 - crucial because machine learning
02:24 - algorithms are built on these principles
02:27 - focus on linear algebra calculus
02:29 - probability and statistics these will
02:32 - help you understand how machine learning
02:34 - algorithms work and how to optimize them
02:36 - spend about 2 to 3 months to master
02:38 - these topics after that you need to get
02:40 - good at preparing and visualizing data
02:43 - for your models this means cleaning up
02:45 - the data and organizing it in a way that
02:47 - makes it easy for your model to
02:49 - understand you'll need to learn how to
02:50 - use tools like pandas and numpy to
02:53 - manipulate and clean the data once your
02:55 - data is clean you need to visualize it
02:57 - to understand patterns and communicate
02:59 - results python libraries like matplot
03:02 - lip and Seaborn will help you create
03:04 - insightful visualizations to identify
03:06 - Trends and anomalies if you have a solid
03:08 - background in Python and SQL you can get
03:10 - a good grasp of data pre-processing and
03:13 - visualization in a month or two now
03:15 - let's talk about machine learning
03:16 - fundamentals machine learning algorithms
03:18 - fall into two categories supervised and
03:21 - unsupervised in supervised learning the
03:23 - model learns from labeled data meaning
03:26 - each input comes with a known output in
03:28 - unsupervised Lear learning the model
03:30 - works with unlabeled data and tries to
03:33 - figure out patterns and relationships on
03:35 - its own it's important to learn about
03:37 - these types of algorithms and how they
03:38 - work you'll also need to get familiar
03:40 - with tools like tensor flow pie torch
03:43 - and pyed learn these are the essential
03:45 - tools used to build and train machine
03:47 - learning models dedicate about 3 to four
03:49 - months to master the core machine
03:51 - learning Concepts and how to use these
03:53 - tools effectively once you have a good
03:55 - understanding of the basics it's time to
03:57 - dive into more advanced machine learning
03:59 - Concepts this includes techniques like
04:01 - Ensemble learning which combines
04:03 - multiple models to improve performance
04:05 - and deep learning which involves neural
04:07 - networks with many layers you'll also
04:09 - need to learn about natural language
04:11 - processing or NLP for working with Text
04:14 - data and computer vision for working
04:16 - with images these Advanced topics will
04:18 - help you tackle more complex problems
04:20 - and build more sophisticated models
04:22 - spend about 2 to 3 months on these
04:24 - advanced concepts to deepen your
04:26 - Knowledge and Skills finally you need to
04:28 - know how to put the models you build
04:30 - into action this means learning how to
04:32 - create simple web services that let
04:34 - other applications use your models you
04:36 - can do this by learning python
04:38 - Frameworks like flask or Jango you
04:40 - should also learn about Docker which is
04:42 - a tool that makes it easy to package
04:44 - your model and all its dependencies so
04:46 - it runs smoothly on any machine think of
04:48 - it like packing everything your model
04:50 - needs into a box so it works anywhere
04:52 - you take it spend one to two months
04:55 - mastering these Basics so you can
04:57 - confidently deploy your models and make
04:59 - them available for real word use so if
05:01 - you dedicate 3 to 5 hours every day you
