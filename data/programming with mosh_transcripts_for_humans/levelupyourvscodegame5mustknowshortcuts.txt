00:00 - are you tired of slow coding in vs code
00:02 - do you want to feel like a coding ninja
00:04 - flying through your projects in this
00:06 - video I'm sharing five most snow
00:08 - shortcuts that will transform your
00:10 - workflow making you faster and more
00:12 - efficient hi I'm M hamadani and I'm here
00:15 - to help you become a better coder I've
00:17 - helped Millions level up their coding
00:19 - skills through this Channel and my
00:21 - website codewithmosh
00:23 - docomo on our list is multic cursor
00:26 - editing let's say we have a bunch of
00:27 - objects and here we want to change name
00:30 - name to username there are a few ways we
00:32 - can do this we can select the name
00:33 - property now to select the next
00:36 - occurrence of name we press command and
00:38 - D on Mac or control and D on Windows now
00:42 - we have two cursors so we repeat and
00:44 - select all occurrences of name with this
00:47 - we can change name to username in wo now
00:50 - to stop multic cursor editing we press
00:52 - the skape button twice that was one way
00:55 - but there's a faster way we can select
00:57 - name now to select all occurrences of
00:59 - name we press
01:00 - shift command and L on Mac or shift
01:03 - control and L on Windows now all
01:06 - instances are selected so once again we
01:09 - change name to username but there is one
01:12 - more way we can put the cursor here now
01:14 - on Mac we press option and command on
01:17 - Windows we press alt and control Now by
01:20 - pressing up and down arrows we can add
01:22 - multiple cursors so these are three ways
01:25 - to enable multic cursor editing now the
01:27 - next shortcut on our list is go to file
01:30 - let's say we're looking for a file
01:31 - called product list one way to find it
01:34 - is to go to our project and dig into
01:36 - various folders to find that file this
01:39 - is time consuming there's a faster way
01:42 - we can press command and P on Mac or
01:44 - control and P on Windows this brings up
01:47 - the search box now here we can type
01:49 - product list and this shows all files
01:52 - matching this pattern but there's a
01:54 - faster way we don't even have to type
01:56 - the full file name we can type
01:58 - abbreviations for example we can type
02:00 - prod list and again we get all files
02:03 - matching this pattern now if you're
02:05 - looking for a file called Product list.
02:07 - test. TSX again we don't have to type
02:09 - the full file name here we can just type
02:11 - test to narrow down the search result
02:14 - all right the next shortcut on our list
02:16 - is go to symbol and with this we can
02:19 - instantly jump to any symbols in our
02:21 - project a symbol can be a function a
02:23 - class a variable a constant anything
02:26 - that has an identifier for example let's
02:28 - imagine we looking for a function called
02:30 - simulate delay and we are not sure where
02:33 - that function is defined so here we can
02:35 - press command and T on Mac or control
02:38 - and on Windows and search for simulate
02:41 - delay there you go this function is
02:44 - defined in this module so we press enter
02:47 - and here's our function the next
02:50 - shortcut on our list is the command
02:52 - pallet and this is the Gateway for
02:54 - almost any vs code commands it's
02:57 - particularly useful when we forget
02:58 - something to bring bring it up we press
03:01 - shift command and P on Mac or shift
03:04 - control and P on Windows now here we can
03:06 - access any vs code commands for example
03:08 - we can type theme to change our color
03:11 - theme we can type install extension to
03:15 - install an extension we can also type
03:17 - reload window pretty much all vs code
03:20 - commands are available here at your
03:22 - fingertips the next shortcut we're going
03:24 - to talk about is the integrated terminal
03:26 - in vs code and this is useful for
03:28 - accessing our Command line without ever
03:31 - leaving vs code to access it we press
03:33 - control and back tick and back tick is
03:36 - the character before number one on your
03:38 - keyboard so here we have an integrated
03:40 - terminal and this is where we can access
03:42 - our command line now tell me what are
03:44 - your favorite vs code shortcuts share
03:46 - your favorites in the comments below I'm
