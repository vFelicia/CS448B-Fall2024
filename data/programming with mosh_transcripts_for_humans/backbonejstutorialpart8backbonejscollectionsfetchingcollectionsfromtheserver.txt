With timestamps:

00:05 - in the lecture about connecting to the
00:07 - server in the model section you learn
00:10 - how backbone models can be retrieved
00:12 - from or saved to the server by a restful
00:14 - API
00:15 - backbone collections similar to models
00:18 - are often retrieved from a persistent
00:20 - store residing on a server
00:22 - to retrieve a collection from the server
00:24 - you need to specify the URL of the API
00:27 - and call the fetch method just like
00:29 - models here in this slide we are using
00:31 - the URL property to tell backbone where
00:34 - our songs collection exists on the
00:36 - server
00:37 - the fetch method behaves very similar to
00:39 - the fetch method that you learn in the
00:41 - model section it makes an HTTP get
00:44 - request reads the result and populist
00:46 - the collection
00:47 - is asynchronous and accepts an options
00:50 - hash with success and error callbacks
00:53 - backbone uses jQuery to make Ajax calls
00:57 - as a result you can pass additional
00:58 - arguments to the API using the data hash
01:01 - as you see in the slide
01:03 - this results in an extra query string
01:05 - parameter sent along with the HTTP get
01:08 - request
01:16 - okay that's pretty much it for the
01:18 - collections before proceeding to the
01:20 - next section make sure to take the mini
01:22 - project included in the section this
01:24 - helps you reinforce what you learned and
01:26 - prepares you for more challenging stuff
01:28 - coming up soon good luck and thank you
01:30 - for watching
