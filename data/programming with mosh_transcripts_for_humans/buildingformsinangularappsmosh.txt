00:00 - [Music]
00:01 - in this section we're going to look at
00:03 - building forums in angular so by the end
00:05 - of this section you'll be able to
00:07 - implement forms with different kinds of
00:09 - input fields such as text boxes
00:11 - checkboxes radio buttons and drop-down
00:14 - lists you'll be able to display
00:16 - validation errors next to input fields
00:18 - and disable the submit button if the
00:20 - form is not in a valid state so now
00:23 - let's get started
00:28 - all right we're gonna start this section
00:30 - by creating a simple bootstrap form and
00:33 - then we're gonna bring that to life and
00:35 - add some validation to it using angular
00:37 - so here let's open up the terminal and
00:39 - generate a new component so ng G C let's
00:44 - call this contact - form okay now let's
00:51 - go to contact the HTML delete all the
00:56 - mark-up here you want to add a form we
00:59 - don't need this action attribute inside
01:02 - this form we need to input fields one is
01:05 - the first name and the other is comment
01:07 - so once again I'm gonna use Zen coding
01:10 - to quickly generate marca so first we
01:13 - need a label next to this we want an
01:15 - input i want the type of this input to
01:19 - read text so note that you can use
01:21 - square brackets to put any attribute
01:24 - here now this input field should have a
01:27 - class called form
01:28 - - control and this is one of the classes
01:32 - defined in bootstrap that gives our
01:34 - input field a nice modern look and feel
01:37 - so tab this is our markup let's break it
01:41 - up
01:41 - so with this input field we can set an
01:44 - ID here let's call this first name and
01:48 - note that I'm using camel notation so
01:50 - the first letter of the first word is
01:52 - lowercase and the first letter of every
01:54 - word after is uppercase now if we use
01:58 - this ID here as the value for the for
02:00 - attribute of the label this improves the
02:03 - accessibility of our form so when the
02:05 - user clicks on this label this input
02:08 - field here will automatically get focus
02:10 - okay now finally we need to wrap these
02:14 - two elements inside a div with the class
02:16 - form
02:17 - - group this is one of the requirements
02:19 - by bootstrap so we want a div with a
02:23 - class form
02:24 - - group now let's move this stuff here
02:30 - okay now this time I'm gonna generate
02:33 - all this markup in one go so we want to
02:36 - start with a div with a class form
02:38 - - group now inside this div
02:42 - we want a label and this label shall
02:45 - have an attribute called for said to us
02:48 - a comment now next to this label we want
02:52 - an input with an ID attribute set to
02:55 - comment actually let's change this to a
02:59 - text area so we can have multiple lines
03:02 - now this text area should also have a
03:05 - class called form
03:06 - - ctrl tab okay here's our markup here's
03:13 - our div we have a label inside that and
03:15 - next to that we have a text area we
03:18 - don't need this name attribute so let's
03:20 - delete this and here's the closing div
03:25 - element now finally we need a bun this
03:28 - button should have two classes one is
03:30 - BTN and the other is BTN - primary and
03:34 - let's call this submit now one more
03:38 - thing is that each of these label
03:40 - elements need a value so the first one
03:43 - should be first name and the second
03:45 - should be comment ok now finally let's
03:50 - use this form on our home page first
03:53 - let's go to contact dot TS I want to
03:58 - change the selector here we don't really
04:00 - need this app - prefix it's extra noise
04:03 - added only if it's clashing with another
04:06 - component defined somewhere else
04:07 - something that you're importing from a
04:09 - third-party library so finally let's go
04:12 - to app that HTML delete all the mark up
04:16 - here and add our contact - form element
04:20 - now let's preview this so back in the
04:23 - browser this is our contact form so
04:26 - first name comment and our submit button
04:34 - so we have built this simple form now we
04:37 - want to add validation to it in angular
04:39 - we have a class called form control for
04:43 - each input field in our form we need to
04:45 - create an instance of the control class
04:47 - and with this control class we can check
04:50 - the current value stored in an input
04:52 - field we can see if the input field has
04:54 - been touched or untouched we can see if
04:57 - it's dirty which means its value is
04:59 - changed or pristine which means its
05:02 - value is not changed whether it's valid
05:04 - or not and if it's not what are the
05:07 - validation errors so for each input
05:09 - field in the form we need a control
05:11 - object now similar to the control class
05:14 - we have another class called form group
05:17 - which represents a group of controls in
05:20 - a form each form is essentially a
05:23 - control group because it contains at
05:25 - least one control but in a complex
05:27 - application you might have a form with
05:29 - multiple control groups for example you
05:32 - might have a control group for the
05:33 - shipping address and another for the
05:36 - billing address now interestingly all
05:39 - the properties of the control class that
05:41 - you saw earlier are also available in
05:43 - the form group class as well so we can
05:45 - ask a form group if it's valid or not
05:48 - and that returns true if all the
05:51 - controls in that group are valid
05:53 - similarly we can get all the validation
05:56 - errors in that group so accessing these
05:58 - properties of a form group is easier
06:00 - than iterating over all the controls in
06:04 - that group and checking their status so
06:06 - to add validation to a form we need to
06:08 - create a form group objects for the form
06:11 - and a form control object for each input
06:13 - field in the form this way we can keep
06:16 - track of the state of each input field
06:18 - and the entire form as a whole now there
06:21 - are two ways to create these control
06:22 - objects one way is by applying some
06:25 - directives in our template an angular
06:28 - will create these control objects for us
06:30 - implicitly under the hood we call forms
06:33 - that are built this way template driven
06:36 - forms so we build them using their
06:38 - template another approach involves
06:41 - explicitly creating these control
06:43 - objects so in our components we should
06:46 - write code to create new in
06:48 - stencils of the control group and
06:49 - control objects we call forms that are
06:52 - built this way as reactive forms
06:54 - previously they used to be called model
06:57 - driven forms now they are called
06:59 - reactive forms now you might ask what is
07:01 - the difference what is the difference
07:02 - between template driven forms and
07:04 - reactive forms the difference is that
07:07 - when we create these control objects
07:08 - explicitly we have more control over
07:11 - their validation logic so if you want to
07:14 - build a complex form with complex
07:16 - validation you need to use reactive
07:18 - forms you need to create these control
07:20 - objects explicitly and also another
07:23 - benefit of this approach is that you can
07:25 - unit test the validation logic of your
07:28 - form otherwise if you want to build a
07:30 - simple form with some basic validation
07:32 - like making some fields required or
07:34 - within a given range then you can use
07:36 - template driven forms so template driven
07:39 - forms are easier to create we write less
07:42 - code but we have also less control over
07:44 - the validation of our form now in this
07:47 - section we're going to look at template
07:48 - driven forms and we'll leave reactive
07:50 - forms in the next section
07:57 - so we are built its basic bootstrap form
08:00 - now we want to add validation to this
08:02 - using template driven approach so as I
08:05 - explained in the last lecture we
08:06 - template driven approach we apply a
08:09 - directive to our input field and angular
08:12 - will create a control object and
08:14 - associated with that input field under
08:16 - the hood that guess what you already
08:19 - know this directive that is ng model so
08:23 - here on this first name input field I'm
08:24 - gonna apply the ng model directive we
08:28 - use this before with the two-way binding
08:30 - syntax or banana in a box remember that
08:33 - so we used it like this here's a box
08:36 - here is a banana and we used engine
08:40 - model like this and bound this to a
08:42 - property or a field in our component
08:44 - like first thing here we don't need to a
08:47 - binding yet perhaps we can add this in
08:49 - the future but all I want to show you is
08:51 - that when you apply the ng model
08:54 - directive on an input field and its
08:57 - simplest form without any binding
08:59 - angular will create an control object
09:02 - and associated with this input field
09:03 - under the hood now let's preview this in
09:07 - the browser so back in chrome we get
09:10 - this error if ng model is used within a
09:13 - form tag either the name attribute must
09:15 - be set or the form control must be
09:18 - defined as standalone
09:19 - so basically the reason we got that
09:22 - error is that we didn't set a name
09:24 - attribute here this is a requirement
09:26 - because every time we apply this ng
09:29 - model on an input field and it needs a
09:32 - way to distinguish these control objects
09:34 - so here we set the name attribute I'm
09:37 - gonna use the same value as the ID so
09:40 - first name save now back in the browser
09:44 - the error is gone now I want to show you
09:47 - that control object under the hood so
09:51 - these two attributes are all you need to
09:53 - set in order to use the template driven
09:55 - approach but in this video I want to
09:57 - show you what is happening under the
09:59 - hood so I want to handle the change
10:02 - event of this input field and here we're
10:05 - gonna call the log method now I need a
10:08 - reference to this ng model directive
10:11 - I want to pass that reference to the log
10:12 - method so we can log in on the console
10:15 - for that we're gonna create a template
10:18 - variable so hashtag let's call that
10:21 - template variable first name because
10:23 - call it anything and as the value I'm
10:26 - gonna use ng model so when angular sees
10:30 - this it's going to set this template
10:32 - variable to the ng model directive that
10:35 - is applied on this input field okay and
10:38 - then we can pass this variable to our
10:41 - log method so here's the log method we
10:44 - pass first name now let's go and
10:48 - implement this method so back in our
10:50 - component I'm gonna delete the stuff
10:53 - that we don't need let's just keep it
10:55 - simple
10:56 - here's the log method let's give it a
10:58 - parameter called X and simply log it on
11:01 - the console this is just for Diagnostics
11:04 - now back in the browser I'm gonna type
11:07 - my name here press tab now let's take a
11:10 - look at the console okay here's our ng
11:13 - model so you can see ng model is an
11:16 - object with these properties now look at
11:20 - this property control this is the
11:22 - control object that I was telling you
11:23 - about now if you click on the value look
11:27 - it's an instance of the form control
11:30 - class in angular let's expand this here
11:34 - we have a bunch of properties and many
11:37 - of these properties come in pairs
11:38 - for example we have this dirty which
11:41 - determines if the value of the input
11:43 - field is changed from the moment the
11:46 - form was initialized in this case
11:48 - because I typed my name here dirty is
11:51 - true now the opposite property is
11:54 - pristine pristine means clean so dirty
11:58 - should be true and pristine is false
12:01 - okay now we have another pair in valid
12:05 - and valid in this case because we
12:08 - haven't implemented validation yet this
12:10 - input field is considered valid
12:12 - so invalid should be false and valid
12:16 - should be true now if you have any
12:19 - validation errors they're available here
12:23 - currently
12:24 - errors is null because we don't have any
12:26 - errors we have another pair which is
12:29 - touched and untouched in this case
12:31 - because I touch the input field or in
12:33 - other words I put the focus there and
12:36 - then moved away touched should be true
12:38 - and untouched should be false we have
12:42 - another important property value which
12:45 - returns the current value in the input
12:47 - film so what I want you to note here is
12:50 - that we use this form control class to
12:52 - track state changes and the validity of
12:55 - input fields when we apply the ng-model
12:59 - directive along with the name attribute
13:01 - at an input field angular automatically
13:04 - creates an instance of the form control
13:07 - class and associates it with this input
13:10 - field now to finish up this lecture I'm
13:12 - gonna apply ng model on our text area as
13:15 - well and set the name attribute to
13:18 - comment in the next lecture we're going
13:21 - to add some validation here
13:27 - all right now let's make this first name
13:30 - field required so in html5 we can use
13:33 - this required attribute on an input
13:36 - field and angular uses this to apply
13:38 - this kind of meditation on this input
13:40 - field so just next to this input field I
13:43 - want to add a div this is where will
13:45 - display the validation error so first
13:48 - name is required now to make this pretty
13:52 - can apply to bootstrap classes one is
13:56 - alert and the other is alert - danger
14:00 - which puts this in a red box now we
14:04 - don't want to display this at all times
14:05 - you want to display this only if the
14:07 - input field is not valid so we use the
14:12 - end if directive that you have seen
14:14 - before
14:14 - now how do we know if the field is valid
14:16 - or not well back here in the console you
14:19 - saw this ng-model directive right and we
14:23 - looked at this control property this
14:26 - control has a property called valid from
14:29 - here we can tell if an input field is
14:31 - valid or not but there is a simpler way
14:34 - so let's collapse this property if you
14:38 - look at the properties of this ngmodel
14:40 - directive we have all those properties
14:43 - you saw earlier as part of this class as
14:45 - well so here we have valid which is a
14:49 - computed property so when we use this
14:51 - property internally the ngmodel
14:54 - directive delegates to the underlying
14:57 - form control object so here has the
15:00 - value of the ng-if directive we can
15:03 - reference our directive so earlier we
15:06 - created this template variable first
15:07 - name we can type first name dot valid
15:11 - now we apply the not operator here so
15:15 - we'll render this Dib only if the first
15:17 - name is not valid let's test the result
15:19 - so back in the browser okay you can see
15:23 - the error is initially displayed here
15:25 - which is a little bit too confronting
15:26 - for the user because they haven't done
15:28 - anything wrong yet so I will show you
15:31 - how to fix this problem in a second
15:32 - let's type something here look as soon
15:35 - as I type one character the error is
15:37 - gone and when I delete this the error is
15:40 - back so
15:41 - the validation is working now let me
15:43 - show you how to show this error only if
15:45 - the user puts focus in this input Ville
15:48 - and moves away without entering a value
15:50 - so back here I'm gonna change this
15:53 - condition I'm gonna add first name that
15:56 - touched and first name not valid with
16:01 - this I'm telling angular to render this
16:03 - div if this input field has been touched
16:05 - which means it received focus but the
16:08 - user left this input field without
16:10 - entering a valid value so let's try it
16:13 - again back in the browser so look
16:17 - initially the error is not here now I'll
16:19 - put the focus if I press tab I get this
16:23 - error so this is how we add the
16:26 - validation errors next to each input
16:28 - field we add a div with the validation
16:30 - error and render it only if that input
16:33 - field has been touched and it's not
16:36 - valid in the next lecture I'm going to
16:38 - show you different kinds of validation
16:40 - errors
16:46 - so in the last lecture you saw the
16:48 - required validation error in angular we
16:51 - have a few built-in validators that are
16:53 - based on html5 validation attributes so
16:57 - let's say we want to set a minimum links
16:59 - for our first name you can set that here
17:01 - it has to be minimum three characters we
17:05 - can also set a maximum links let's say
17:09 - 10 characters now finally we can also
17:12 - apply a pattern now in case of a first
17:16 - name it doesn't quite make sense but if
17:18 - you have something that you want to
17:19 - apply regular expression validation on
17:21 - you can use this pattern attribute so
17:24 - I'm gonna set this to banana and this
17:26 - means only the word banana is a valid
17:29 - value in this input field now when you
17:31 - have multiple validation attributes you
17:33 - cannot show them all with one div like
17:36 - here we want specific validation errors
17:39 - okay so we want to make a small change
17:41 - here first I'm gonna remove this
17:44 - validation error here now inside this
17:47 - div you want to have a separate div for
17:49 - each validation error so div first name
17:54 - is required now we want to render this
17:58 - only if we have the required validation
18:02 - error so here as the value for the ng-if
18:05 - directive we type first name remember
18:07 - here we have a property called errors
18:10 - now from here we can check to see if we
18:14 - have this error required so in this
18:16 - error object we have one or more key
18:19 - value pairs and the keys are the
18:21 - validation errors I'm going to show you
18:23 - the content of this errors object in a
18:25 - second now let us add the second div so
18:29 - another div first name should be minimum
18:35 - three characters okay now once again we
18:40 - want to render this only a first name
18:43 - that errors that min length is true yeah
18:47 - I'm gonna duplicate this and for the
18:50 - last one I'm gonna use pattern so first
18:53 - name
18:55 - doesn't match the pattern okay now let's
19:00 - inspect this in the browser so initially
19:02 - no error
19:03 - I put the focus here move away we get
19:06 - this error message first name is
19:08 - required
19:08 - I type only one character now look we
19:12 - have two errors first name should be
19:14 - minimum three characters and the second
19:16 - error is about a regular expression so
19:19 - if I type two more characters the first
19:21 - error is gone but the value we have here
19:23 - doesn't match the pattern so let me
19:26 - change this to banana and all the errors
19:29 - are gone so this is how we add multiple
19:32 - validation constraints on an input field
19:34 - we simply use these standard html5
19:37 - attributes required min length max
19:41 - length and pattern and for each error
19:43 - will have a separate div now finally
19:46 - before we finish this lecture let me
19:47 - show you the content of this errors
19:49 - object so once again here I'm going to
19:51 - type one two now let's open up the
19:54 - console so here's our ng model we have
19:59 - this error object look we have two key
20:03 - value pairs keys are min lengths and
20:05 - pattern look at the values so this
20:09 - object has two properties actual length
20:11 - which is two and the required lengths
20:13 - which is three we can take advantage of
20:16 - these properties and render a dynamic
20:18 - message to the user so here for the min
20:21 - length validation error instead of
20:24 - hard-coding
20:25 - this value 3 here we can render it
20:28 - dynamically because tomorrow we may
20:30 - decide to change the value of the min
20:32 - length attribute we don't want to change
20:34 - this in two places okay so here we add
20:37 - interpolation and render first name that
20:41 - errors that min length dot now the
20:45 - property we want to add here is required
20:47 - length so dot require head length let's
20:53 - test this so back here I type my two
20:55 - characters tab and first name should be
20:58 - minimum three characters which is
21:00 - rendered dynamically
21:06 - back to our forum I want type an invalid
21:09 - value here now as a best practice we
21:12 - should highlight the invalid input
21:14 - fields this improves the usability of
21:17 - our form so how do we apply a red border
21:19 - to this input field well let's inspect
21:22 - this all right here's our input field
21:27 - now there are so many attributes here
21:29 - don't worry about them
21:30 - just look at this part class so we have
21:33 - the form - control class that we applied
21:35 - in our template but we also have three
21:38 - more classes that are added by angular
21:40 - dynamically one is ng - invalid the
21:44 - other is ng - dirty and ng - touched we
21:48 - can use these classes to apply styles to
21:51 - invalid input fields so let's go to
21:54 - styles that CSS here I'm gonna add a new
21:59 - rule so if you have an element with the
22:01 - class form that's control which should
22:04 - be applied on all input fields and also
22:07 - in the same element we have ng - touched
22:11 - as well as ng - invalid I wanna make the
22:16 - border of that element - pixel solid red
22:20 - straight back in the browser so I put
22:24 - the focus here and tab and here we have
22:26 - a red border
22:31 - as you build forms with angular you will
22:34 - notice that your templates get more
22:36 - complex now in this video I have
22:38 - increased the font size and for that
22:40 - reason you don't see all the markup here
22:42 - so we have to scroll to the right
22:45 - however on your screen chances are you
22:48 - have everything in one view but what I
22:51 - want to point out here is that as a best
22:53 - practice your code should be formatted
22:55 - in such a way that another developer
22:58 - does not have to scroll to the right and
23:01 - to the left to see what's happening so
23:02 - let me show you a cleaner way to write
23:05 - this template we can break up these
23:07 - lines and list one attribute on each
23:09 - line for example consider this input
23:12 - field we can add all these attributes
23:15 - like this one on each line I note that
23:18 - I'm listing all the validation
23:20 - attributes first so another person
23:22 - another developer reading this code they
23:24 - know immediately what are the validation
23:26 - constraints of this input field after
23:29 - these I add ng model and immediately
23:32 - follow that I add the name attribute as
23:34 - well as first name set to ng model now
23:38 - we don't really need this event binding
23:40 - here this is purely for this demo and
23:43 - finally we add ID type and class then
23:48 - similarly we can format our validation
23:52 - errors like this so we have the parent
23:54 - div I add all the classes here and then
23:58 - ng if so here you can easily see this
24:00 - ng-if without having to scroll to the
24:02 - left and right now for each validation
24:05 - error we can break it up like this so I
24:08 - put the error on the next line and this
24:11 - is much easier to the eyes like this
24:16 - so this is the end result which is way
24:19 - cleaner than what we had before hi thank

Cleaned transcript:

in this section we're going to look at building forums in angular so by the end of this section you'll be able to implement forms with different kinds of input fields such as text boxes checkboxes radio buttons and dropdown lists you'll be able to display validation errors next to input fields and disable the submit button if the form is not in a valid state so now let's get started all right we're gonna start this section by creating a simple bootstrap form and then we're gonna bring that to life and add some validation to it using angular so here let's open up the terminal and generate a new component so ng G C let's call this contact form okay now let's go to contact the HTML delete all the markup here you want to add a form we don't need this action attribute inside this form we need to input fields one is the first name and the other is comment so once again I'm gonna use Zen coding to quickly generate marca so first we need a label next to this we want an input i want the type of this input to read text so note that you can use square brackets to put any attribute here now this input field should have a class called form control and this is one of the classes defined in bootstrap that gives our input field a nice modern look and feel so tab this is our markup let's break it up so with this input field we can set an ID here let's call this first name and note that I'm using camel notation so the first letter of the first word is lowercase and the first letter of every word after is uppercase now if we use this ID here as the value for the for attribute of the label this improves the accessibility of our form so when the user clicks on this label this input field here will automatically get focus okay now finally we need to wrap these two elements inside a div with the class form group this is one of the requirements by bootstrap so we want a div with a class form group now let's move this stuff here okay now this time I'm gonna generate all this markup in one go so we want to start with a div with a class form group now inside this div we want a label and this label shall have an attribute called for said to us a comment now next to this label we want an input with an ID attribute set to comment actually let's change this to a text area so we can have multiple lines now this text area should also have a class called form ctrl tab okay here's our markup here's our div we have a label inside that and next to that we have a text area we don't need this name attribute so let's delete this and here's the closing div element now finally we need a bun this button should have two classes one is BTN and the other is BTN primary and let's call this submit now one more thing is that each of these label elements need a value so the first one should be first name and the second should be comment ok now finally let's use this form on our home page first let's go to contact dot TS I want to change the selector here we don't really need this app prefix it's extra noise added only if it's clashing with another component defined somewhere else something that you're importing from a thirdparty library so finally let's go to app that HTML delete all the mark up here and add our contact form element now let's preview this so back in the browser this is our contact form so first name comment and our submit button so we have built this simple form now we want to add validation to it in angular we have a class called form control for each input field in our form we need to create an instance of the control class and with this control class we can check the current value stored in an input field we can see if the input field has been touched or untouched we can see if it's dirty which means its value is changed or pristine which means its value is not changed whether it's valid or not and if it's not what are the validation errors so for each input field in the form we need a control object now similar to the control class we have another class called form group which represents a group of controls in a form each form is essentially a control group because it contains at least one control but in a complex application you might have a form with multiple control groups for example you might have a control group for the shipping address and another for the billing address now interestingly all the properties of the control class that you saw earlier are also available in the form group class as well so we can ask a form group if it's valid or not and that returns true if all the controls in that group are valid similarly we can get all the validation errors in that group so accessing these properties of a form group is easier than iterating over all the controls in that group and checking their status so to add validation to a form we need to create a form group objects for the form and a form control object for each input field in the form this way we can keep track of the state of each input field and the entire form as a whole now there are two ways to create these control objects one way is by applying some directives in our template an angular will create these control objects for us implicitly under the hood we call forms that are built this way template driven forms so we build them using their template another approach involves explicitly creating these control objects so in our components we should write code to create new in stencils of the control group and control objects we call forms that are built this way as reactive forms previously they used to be called model driven forms now they are called reactive forms now you might ask what is the difference what is the difference between template driven forms and reactive forms the difference is that when we create these control objects explicitly we have more control over their validation logic so if you want to build a complex form with complex validation you need to use reactive forms you need to create these control objects explicitly and also another benefit of this approach is that you can unit test the validation logic of your form otherwise if you want to build a simple form with some basic validation like making some fields required or within a given range then you can use template driven forms so template driven forms are easier to create we write less code but we have also less control over the validation of our form now in this section we're going to look at template driven forms and we'll leave reactive forms in the next section so we are built its basic bootstrap form now we want to add validation to this using template driven approach so as I explained in the last lecture we template driven approach we apply a directive to our input field and angular will create a control object and associated with that input field under the hood that guess what you already know this directive that is ng model so here on this first name input field I'm gonna apply the ng model directive we use this before with the twoway binding syntax or banana in a box remember that so we used it like this here's a box here is a banana and we used engine model like this and bound this to a property or a field in our component like first thing here we don't need to a binding yet perhaps we can add this in the future but all I want to show you is that when you apply the ng model directive on an input field and its simplest form without any binding angular will create an control object and associated with this input field under the hood now let's preview this in the browser so back in chrome we get this error if ng model is used within a form tag either the name attribute must be set or the form control must be defined as standalone so basically the reason we got that error is that we didn't set a name attribute here this is a requirement because every time we apply this ng model on an input field and it needs a way to distinguish these control objects so here we set the name attribute I'm gonna use the same value as the ID so first name save now back in the browser the error is gone now I want to show you that control object under the hood so these two attributes are all you need to set in order to use the template driven approach but in this video I want to show you what is happening under the hood so I want to handle the change event of this input field and here we're gonna call the log method now I need a reference to this ng model directive I want to pass that reference to the log method so we can log in on the console for that we're gonna create a template variable so hashtag let's call that template variable first name because call it anything and as the value I'm gonna use ng model so when angular sees this it's going to set this template variable to the ng model directive that is applied on this input field okay and then we can pass this variable to our log method so here's the log method we pass first name now let's go and implement this method so back in our component I'm gonna delete the stuff that we don't need let's just keep it simple here's the log method let's give it a parameter called X and simply log it on the console this is just for Diagnostics now back in the browser I'm gonna type my name here press tab now let's take a look at the console okay here's our ng model so you can see ng model is an object with these properties now look at this property control this is the control object that I was telling you about now if you click on the value look it's an instance of the form control class in angular let's expand this here we have a bunch of properties and many of these properties come in pairs for example we have this dirty which determines if the value of the input field is changed from the moment the form was initialized in this case because I typed my name here dirty is true now the opposite property is pristine pristine means clean so dirty should be true and pristine is false okay now we have another pair in valid and valid in this case because we haven't implemented validation yet this input field is considered valid so invalid should be false and valid should be true now if you have any validation errors they're available here currently errors is null because we don't have any errors we have another pair which is touched and untouched in this case because I touch the input field or in other words I put the focus there and then moved away touched should be true and untouched should be false we have another important property value which returns the current value in the input film so what I want you to note here is that we use this form control class to track state changes and the validity of input fields when we apply the ngmodel directive along with the name attribute at an input field angular automatically creates an instance of the form control class and associates it with this input field now to finish up this lecture I'm gonna apply ng model on our text area as well and set the name attribute to comment in the next lecture we're going to add some validation here all right now let's make this first name field required so in html5 we can use this required attribute on an input field and angular uses this to apply this kind of meditation on this input field so just next to this input field I want to add a div this is where will display the validation error so first name is required now to make this pretty can apply to bootstrap classes one is alert and the other is alert danger which puts this in a red box now we don't want to display this at all times you want to display this only if the input field is not valid so we use the end if directive that you have seen before now how do we know if the field is valid or not well back here in the console you saw this ngmodel directive right and we looked at this control property this control has a property called valid from here we can tell if an input field is valid or not but there is a simpler way so let's collapse this property if you look at the properties of this ngmodel directive we have all those properties you saw earlier as part of this class as well so here we have valid which is a computed property so when we use this property internally the ngmodel directive delegates to the underlying form control object so here has the value of the ngif directive we can reference our directive so earlier we created this template variable first name we can type first name dot valid now we apply the not operator here so we'll render this Dib only if the first name is not valid let's test the result so back in the browser okay you can see the error is initially displayed here which is a little bit too confronting for the user because they haven't done anything wrong yet so I will show you how to fix this problem in a second let's type something here look as soon as I type one character the error is gone and when I delete this the error is back so the validation is working now let me show you how to show this error only if the user puts focus in this input Ville and moves away without entering a value so back here I'm gonna change this condition I'm gonna add first name that touched and first name not valid with this I'm telling angular to render this div if this input field has been touched which means it received focus but the user left this input field without entering a valid value so let's try it again back in the browser so look initially the error is not here now I'll put the focus if I press tab I get this error so this is how we add the validation errors next to each input field we add a div with the validation error and render it only if that input field has been touched and it's not valid in the next lecture I'm going to show you different kinds of validation errors so in the last lecture you saw the required validation error in angular we have a few builtin validators that are based on html5 validation attributes so let's say we want to set a minimum links for our first name you can set that here it has to be minimum three characters we can also set a maximum links let's say 10 characters now finally we can also apply a pattern now in case of a first name it doesn't quite make sense but if you have something that you want to apply regular expression validation on you can use this pattern attribute so I'm gonna set this to banana and this means only the word banana is a valid value in this input field now when you have multiple validation attributes you cannot show them all with one div like here we want specific validation errors okay so we want to make a small change here first I'm gonna remove this validation error here now inside this div you want to have a separate div for each validation error so div first name is required now we want to render this only if we have the required validation error so here as the value for the ngif directive we type first name remember here we have a property called errors now from here we can check to see if we have this error required so in this error object we have one or more key value pairs and the keys are the validation errors I'm going to show you the content of this errors object in a second now let us add the second div so another div first name should be minimum three characters okay now once again we want to render this only a first name that errors that min length is true yeah I'm gonna duplicate this and for the last one I'm gonna use pattern so first name doesn't match the pattern okay now let's inspect this in the browser so initially no error I put the focus here move away we get this error message first name is required I type only one character now look we have two errors first name should be minimum three characters and the second error is about a regular expression so if I type two more characters the first error is gone but the value we have here doesn't match the pattern so let me change this to banana and all the errors are gone so this is how we add multiple validation constraints on an input field we simply use these standard html5 attributes required min length max length and pattern and for each error will have a separate div now finally before we finish this lecture let me show you the content of this errors object so once again here I'm going to type one two now let's open up the console so here's our ng model we have this error object look we have two key value pairs keys are min lengths and pattern look at the values so this object has two properties actual length which is two and the required lengths which is three we can take advantage of these properties and render a dynamic message to the user so here for the min length validation error instead of hardcoding this value 3 here we can render it dynamically because tomorrow we may decide to change the value of the min length attribute we don't want to change this in two places okay so here we add interpolation and render first name that errors that min length dot now the property we want to add here is required length so dot require head length let's test this so back here I type my two characters tab and first name should be minimum three characters which is rendered dynamically back to our forum I want type an invalid value here now as a best practice we should highlight the invalid input fields this improves the usability of our form so how do we apply a red border to this input field well let's inspect this all right here's our input field now there are so many attributes here don't worry about them just look at this part class so we have the form control class that we applied in our template but we also have three more classes that are added by angular dynamically one is ng invalid the other is ng dirty and ng touched we can use these classes to apply styles to invalid input fields so let's go to styles that CSS here I'm gonna add a new rule so if you have an element with the class form that's control which should be applied on all input fields and also in the same element we have ng touched as well as ng invalid I wanna make the border of that element pixel solid red straight back in the browser so I put the focus here and tab and here we have a red border as you build forms with angular you will notice that your templates get more complex now in this video I have increased the font size and for that reason you don't see all the markup here so we have to scroll to the right however on your screen chances are you have everything in one view but what I want to point out here is that as a best practice your code should be formatted in such a way that another developer does not have to scroll to the right and to the left to see what's happening so let me show you a cleaner way to write this template we can break up these lines and list one attribute on each line for example consider this input field we can add all these attributes like this one on each line I note that I'm listing all the validation attributes first so another person another developer reading this code they know immediately what are the validation constraints of this input field after these I add ng model and immediately follow that I add the name attribute as well as first name set to ng model now we don't really need this event binding here this is purely for this demo and finally we add ID type and class then similarly we can format our validation errors like this so we have the parent div I add all the classes here and then ng if so here you can easily see this ngif without having to scroll to the left and right now for each validation error we can break it up like this so I put the error on the next line and this is much easier to the eyes like this so this is the end result which is way
