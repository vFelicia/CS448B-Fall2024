00:02 - In this lecture, I'm gonna show you how
to loop over lists. So here we have a
00:08 - list of three items we can use our four
loops to loop over this list so for
00:14 - letter in letters : and then we print
each letter save the changes and run the
00:22 - code we get ABC now what if you want to
get the index of each item as well well
00:28 - we have a built-in function called
enumerate we call it here and this will
00:35 - return an enumerator object which is
iterable in each iteration this
00:40 - enumerate object will give us a tapa let
me show you so now when we run this code
00:46 - look in each iteration we're getting a
topple so a topple as I told you before
00:51 - is like a list but it's read-only we
cannot add new items to it so in each
00:57 - iteration we're getting a topple of two
items the first item in this couple is
01:01 - the index and the second item is the
item at that index so now to get the
01:08 - index we can use square brackets to
access the first item in this topple so
01:13 - if we print letter of 0 we will get the
indexes and right next to that we can
01:21 - add letter of 1 so we will see the item
had a given index but this syntax is a
01:28 - little bit ugly
in the last lecture you'll learn about
01:31 - list unpacking so if we have a list with
two items 0 and a we can unpack it into
01:41 - two variables like this index comma
letter equals items so here we are
01:48 - unpacking the items list now what if we
change square brackets to parenthesis
01:54 - now we have a topple and we can still
unpack this topple so you saw that this
02:00 - enumerate function returns an enumerate
object which is a durable in each
02:06 - iteration this enumerated object will
return a topple that looks like
02:11 - so we can unpack it right here so we add
another variable index now with this we
02:20 - no longer have to use square brackets
and we can simply print index and letter
02:26 - let's run this code there you go
so now we don't need this anymore so to
02:34 - recap you can use for loops to iterate
over lists if you also need the index
02:39 - you should call the enumerate function
this will return an enumerator object
02:44 - which is iterable in each iteration it
will return a topple and you can unpack
02:50 - that topple right here
