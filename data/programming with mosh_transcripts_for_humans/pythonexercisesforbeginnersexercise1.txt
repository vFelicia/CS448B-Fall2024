00:03 - Alright! Time for an exercise. I want you
to write a program to display the even
00:09 - numbers between 1 to 10. So when you run
this program you should see 2 4 6 and 8
00:15 - and after these I want you to print this
message we have 4 even numbers now here
00:22 - is a quick hint before you get started
you should call the range function with
00:26 - 1 and 10 do not use the third argument
which is called step so basically I want
00:32 - you to iterate over all the numbers we
can want to tab check if each number is
00:37 - an even number and then print it on the
terminal so pause the video spend two
00:42 - minutes on this exercise when you're
done come back continue watching
00:49 - so we started with a four loop for a
number in range one to ten : we check to
00:57 - see if the remainder of division of this
number by two equals zero
01:02 - so if number modulus 2 equals zero then
we print this number
01:11 - now let's run this program so we get two
four six eight beautiful now to count
01:18 - the even numbers we need a separate
variable so let's call that count
01:23 - initially we set it to zero now in this
if block every time we find an even
01:28 - number we need to increment count so we
set count plus equals one and finally
01:36 - after our for loop we can print a
formatted string we have count even
01:44 - numbers let's run the program and here's
the result
01:52 - hi guys thank you for watching this
