00:00 - if you're new to coding and feeling
00:01 - overwhelmed by all those programming
00:03 - languages out there I totally get it
00:06 - it's easy to get stuck jumping from one
00:08 - language to another and feeling like you
00:10 - are getting nowhere in this video I'm
00:12 - going to give you a road map so you can
00:14 - decide which languages are the best fit
00:16 - for your dream Tech job and help you get
00:18 - there faster we'll explore different
00:20 - career paths and the languages that
00:22 - power
00:25 - them now before we get started I need to
00:27 - mention that some folks might be worried
00:29 - about about AI taking over software
00:32 - development jobs that's a whole other
00:34 - topic but let me just say this AI is
00:36 - going to be a powerful tool for
00:37 - developers not a replacement I cover
00:40 - this in detail in two other videos links
00:42 - are down below if you're curious also I
00:44 - need to tell you a fact simply learning
00:46 - a programming language isn't a golden
00:49 - ticket to a job right away so don't be
00:51 - fooled by YouTube videos giving you such
00:53 - promises Landing a tech job usually
00:55 - takes a combination of skills a
00:57 - programming language is one of them and
00:59 - it's the first step in this video our
01:02 - focus is only on languages and nothing
01:04 - else now to decide what language to
01:06 - learn first you have to figure out what
01:08 - kind of Tech Career you want so what
01:10 - makes you excited do you like building
01:12 - amazing websites mobile apps games or
01:15 - software that controls physical objects
01:17 - what do you want to do let's talk about
01:19 - each of these paths and the languages
01:21 - they use let's start with web
01:23 - development if you dream of building
01:25 - beautiful websites or even online games
01:28 - this is the path for you now when web
01:30 - development has two main sites front-end
01:32 - and backend development front-end
01:34 - development is all about what the user
01:36 - sees and interacts with your key tools
01:39 - will be HTML CSS and JavaScript with
01:43 - HTML we can structure our web pages and
01:45 - their content with CSS we can make them
01:48 - pretty and with JavaScript we can make
01:50 - them Dynamic so we can respond to user
01:53 - actions like clicks and drags and do
01:55 - cool things now backend development is
01:58 - the behindth scenes Magic databases
02:00 - servers and the logic that makes
02:02 - everything work now here we have a few
02:05 - options we can use JavaScript python
02:08 - Java PHP C and so on now as we can see
02:12 - if you learn JavaScript you can use it
02:14 - both for the front end and backend
02:16 - development so you don't need to learn
02:17 - one extra language for backend
02:19 - development and guess what if you can
02:21 - build both the front end and backend
02:24 - together you're essentially a full stack
02:26 - developer with a higher salary okay now
02:28 - let's talk about mobile development here
02:30 - we have two main paths native and
02:33 - crossplatform development native
02:35 - development means we build apps
02:37 - specifically for either Android or iOS
02:40 - for Android Java is a classic choice but
02:43 - cotlin is becoming the modern favorite
02:46 - for iOS your go-to language will be
02:48 - swift but Objective C is still used for
02:51 - older projects now crossplatform
02:53 - development lets you use a single code
02:56 - base to create apps for both Android and
02:59 - iOS saving time and resources here we
03:01 - have two popular choices for building
03:03 - mobile apps react native and flutter
03:06 - these are not programming languages they
03:08 - tools or Frameworks they allow you to
03:10 - build user interfaces and access things
03:13 - like the camera GPS or motion sensors
03:16 - now depending on your location there
03:18 - might be slightly more job opportunities
03:21 - for one or the other so jump on popular
03:24 - job searching websites and do a bit of
03:26 - research on the job market now if you
03:28 - want to use flutter you have to learn
03:30 - Dart if you want to use react native you
03:32 - have to learn JavaScript so as you can
03:34 - see if you learn JavaScript you can use
03:37 - it for frontend development backend
03:38 - development and mobile development
03:40 - giving you plenty of opportunities now
03:43 - let's talk about game development to
03:45 - build games we have to use a game engine
03:47 - we have two popular game engines which
03:49 - are unity and Unreal Engine Unity is a
03:52 - bit more beginner friendly and is often
03:54 - used in small to medium-sized game
03:57 - studios onreal engine is a bit more
03:59 - advanced and is used in large scale
04:01 - games that are visually stunning for
04:03 - Unity you have to learn C for Unreal
04:06 - Engine you have to learn C++ all right
04:09 - now let's talk about embedded systems
04:11 - this field is all about building
04:12 - software that can control Real World
04:15 - objects like smart watches self-driving
04:17 - cars medical robots appliances and so on
04:20 - here we have a few choices C and C++
04:23 - which are the tried and true languages
04:25 - for embedded systems they let you talk
04:27 - directly to the hardware for Max maimum
04:30 - control but you can also learn rust
04:32 - which is a newer language that is all
04:34 - about safety and speed it's perfect for
04:37 - making sure your smart devices work
04:39 - perfectly without errors again before
04:41 - deciding which language to learn first
04:43 - do a bit of research and find out which
04:46 - language offers more job opportunities
04:48 - in your location all right the last
04:50 - career path we're going to talk about is
04:52 - AI and machine learning a field that is
04:54 - rapidly shaping how we interact with
04:56 - technology if that's something you're
04:58 - excited about High is the go-to language
05:01 - for data science and machine learning we
05:03 - also have R Which is popular for
05:05 - statistical Computing and creating
05:07 - beautiful data visualizations now I'm
05:10 - super curious which language do you want
05:12 - to learn after this video let me know in
05:14 - the comments below and remember I'm here
05:16 - to help so if I missed anything or if
05:18 - you have any questions don't hesitate to
05:20 - ask let me know in the comments so I can
05:23 - create more helpful content for you and
05:25 - finally if you found this video helpful
