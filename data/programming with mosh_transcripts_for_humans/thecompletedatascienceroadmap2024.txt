00:00 - if you want to become a data scientist
00:02 - there are nine essential skills you need
00:03 - to master let's dive in and check them
00:05 - out one by
00:08 - one data science is all about analyzing
00:11 - and interpreting complex data to provide
00:14 - actionable insights as a data scientist
00:16 - you'll need to get good at a bunch of
00:18 - different skills from programming and
00:20 - math to data handling and visualization
00:22 - let's jump in first up you need to get
00:24 - the hang of python it's the main
00:26 - language in data science and it's pretty
00:28 - easy to pick up you can get a decent
00:30 - grasp of it in about a month or two then
00:32 - there's R it's another popular language
00:35 - in data science start with python
00:37 - because it's super versatile and once
00:39 - you're comfortable with it you can dive
00:41 - into R for its cool statistical and
00:43 - visualization features next you need to
00:45 - learn git git isn't a programming
00:48 - language it's a Version Control System
00:50 - we use to track changes to our code and
00:52 - collaborate with others git has a ton of
00:54 - features but you don't need to learn
00:55 - them all think of it like the 8020 rule
00:58 - 80% of the time you use 20% of GS
01:01 - features 1 to two weeks of practice is
01:03 - enough to get up and running next you
01:05 - need to dive into data structures and
01:08 - algorithms understanding these Concepts
01:10 - will boost your problem solving skills
01:12 - which is key for tackling complex
01:14 - challenges plus speak take companies
01:16 - like Google Amazon and Facebook always
01:19 - ask about them in job interviews spend
01:21 - about a month or two on this and you'll
01:23 - be in great shape next you need to get
01:25 - comfortable with SQL SQL stands for
01:27 - structured query language it's a very
01:29 - very simple language we use for working
01:31 - with databases as a data scientist you
01:34 - should know how to use SQL to access
01:36 - organize and analyze the data you need
01:38 - SQL is pretty simple and you can get a
01:41 - decent grasp of it in about a month or
01:43 - two by the way to help you on this
01:45 - journey I've created a free
01:47 - supplementary PDF that breaks down the
01:49 - specific Concepts you need to learn for
01:51 - each skill it's a great resource to
01:53 - review your progress find gaps your
01:55 - knowledge and prepare for interviews you
01:57 - can find the link in the description box
02:00 - also I have a bunch of tutorials on this
02:01 - channel and complete courses on my
02:03 - website if you're looking for structured
02:05 - learning again links are in the
02:07 - description box next you need a solid
02:09 - foundation in mathematics and statistics
02:12 - this is crucial because data science
02:14 - relies heavily on these principles focus
02:16 - on linear algebra calculus probability
02:19 - and statistics these will help you
02:22 - understand data analysis techniques and
02:24 - how to interpret data correctly spend
02:26 - about 2 to 3 months mastering these
02:29 - topics I'm after that you need to get
02:31 - good at preparing and visualizing data
02:33 - this means cleaning up the data and
02:35 - organizing it in a way that makes it
02:37 - easy to analyze you'll need to Learn
02:39 - Python libraries like pandas and numpy
02:41 - to manipulate and clean the data once
02:44 - your data is clean you need to visualize
02:46 - it to understand patterns and
02:47 - communicate results libraries like matte
02:50 - plot lip and Seaborn help you create
02:52 - insightful visualizations to identify
02:55 - Trends and anomalies also why not
02:58 - strictly necessary getting familiar with
03:00 - business intelligence tools like Tableau
03:02 - or powerbi can give you an edge because
03:05 - these tools are widely used in the
03:06 - industry for creating interactive and
03:09 - sharable dashboards if you already have
03:11 - a solid background in Python and SQL you
03:14 - can get a good grasp of data
03:15 - pre-processing and visualization in a
03:18 - month or two next up you'll need to get
03:20 - a handle on machine learning
03:21 - fundamentals machine learning algorithms
03:24 - fall into two categories supervised and
03:27 - unsupervised in supervised learning the
03:29 - model learns from labeled data meaning
03:32 - each input comes with a known output in
03:35 - unsupervised learning the model works
03:37 - with unlabel data and tries to figure
03:39 - out patterns and relationships on its
03:41 - own it's important to learn about these
03:43 - types of algorithms and how they work
03:46 - you'll also need to get familiar with
03:47 - tools like tensor flow pytorch and psyit
03:50 - learn which are used to build and train
03:53 - machine learning models dedicate about 3
03:55 - to 4 months to master the core machine
03:57 - learning Concepts and how to use the
03:59 - these tools effectively after you've got
04:02 - the basics of machine learning down it's
04:04 - time to explore deep learning deep
04:06 - learning is a subset of machine learning
04:08 - that uses neural networks with many
04:10 - layers that's why we call it deep these
04:12 - networks are great for handling more
04:15 - complex tasks like image and speech
04:17 - recognition start with understanding the
04:19 - basics of neural networks and then move
04:21 - on to more advanced architectures like
04:23 - cnns and rnns tools like tensor flow and
04:26 - Pie torch are also essential here spend
04:29 - about 2 to 3 months getting a good grasp
04:31 - of deep learning Concepts and how to
04:33 - implement them all right at this point
04:35 - youve got a solid foundation in data
04:37 - science it's like you have become a
04:39 - general doctor now doctors often
04:41 - specialize in different areas like the
04:43 - heart or kidneys similarly you should
04:46 - consider specializing in exciting Fields
04:48 - like natural language processing also
04:50 - called NLP or computer vision NLP is all
04:53 - about working with text and language
04:55 - data it's used for things like analyzing
04:58 - sentiments in text translating languages
05:00 - and creating chat pods like chat GPT
05:03 - computer vision on the other hand is
05:05 - about teaching computers to understand
05:07 - and interpret visual data like images
05:09 - and videos it's used in facial
05:11 - recognition detecting objects and even
05:13 - in self-driving cars now you don't need
05:15 - to learn them both unless you're very
05:17 - enthusiastic so pick the one that
05:19 - interests you the most spend two to 3
05:21 - months diving deep into one of these
05:23 - areas now as you move forward in your
05:25 - data science path there might come a
05:26 - time when you need to work with massive
05:29 - data sets that's where Big Data comes in
05:31 - Big Data is all about handling and
05:33 - processing huge amounts of data quickly
05:36 - tools like Hadoop and Spark are super
05:38 - handy for this spend two to 3 months
05:41 - getting the hang of these tools and
05:42 - you'll be able to spot patterns and
05:44 - trends that you wouldn't catch with
05:46 - smaller data sets so if you dedicate 3
05:49 - to 5 hours every day you can follow this
05:52 - road map and pick up all the skills you
05:53 - need to apply for an entrylevel data
