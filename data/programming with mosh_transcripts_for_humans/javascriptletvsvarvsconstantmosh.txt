With timestamps:

00:03 - so far we have been declaring variables
00:04 - using the lead keyword but at the
00:07 - beginning of the course I briefly
00:09 - mentioned that there is another way to
00:11 - declare variables using the VAR keyword
00:14 - and you may see this in a lot of
00:16 - JavaScript code online in this lecture
00:19 - we're going to look at the VAR keyword
00:21 - you're going to learn about the problems
00:23 - with the var and why you should avoid it
00:25 - so let's start by defining a function
00:29 - start here we're gonna have a loop let I
00:34 - equal to zero we're going to run this
00:36 - loop five times and in each iteration
00:40 - we're going to display I on the console
00:43 - now I don't let's call the start
00:45 - function save the changes so we get
00:48 - number zero to four now in the last
00:50 - lecture you learned that I is only
00:52 - accessible inside this block so if we
00:56 - try to log I outside of this block we're
01:00 - going to get an error I is not defined I
01:04 - just want to clarify something we still
01:06 - have the same concept if I remove this
01:10 - curly braces because here we have a
01:12 - single statement so the scope of I is
01:15 - still this block here okay so save the
01:19 - changes we still get the same error
01:22 - however let's see what happens when we
01:25 - replace let with var save the changes
01:28 - what happened to our error so it turns
01:32 - out that I is accessible outside of this
01:36 - four block so in the last iteration I
01:40 - becomes 5 because 5 is not less than 5
01:43 - so the loop terminates and here on line
01:46 - 6 we're displaying the current value of
01:49 - I so this is the issue with the VAR
01:52 - keyword when you declare a variable with
01:54 - var its scope is not limited to the
01:57 - block in which it's defined it's limited
02:00 - to the function in which it's defined
02:03 - and this is not how most or all
02:05 - programming languages out there work
02:07 - it's one of those weird things in
02:09 - JavaScript that we have had for a long
02:11 - time so before es6 var was the only way
02:15 - to declare very
02:16 - and constants starting from es6 also
02:20 - called es2015 now we have two new
02:23 - keywords let and const to define
02:25 - variables and constants these two
02:28 - keywords create block scope variables
02:32 - but var creates function scoped
02:35 - variables let's take a look at another
02:38 - example
02:38 - so in this for loop let's add a code
02:42 - block here now I'm gonna add an if
02:46 - statement now in the if block I'm gonna
02:50 - declare a variable using var Cotter
02:53 - study to read technically in almost all
02:57 - programming languages out there this
02:59 - variable should only be accessible in
03:01 - this block but because we have used var
03:04 - color is accessible anywhere in this
03:08 - function so at the end of this function
03:10 - we can log color save the changes look
03:14 - we get red here but if we replace bar
03:17 - with let we get an error because color
03:22 - is not accessible here and that's how
03:24 - most languages work so this is the first
03:27 - problem with the VAR keyword the second
03:30 - issue is with global variables so let's
03:33 - delete all the code here I'm gonna
03:35 - declare two variables one mid bar color
03:39 - we set it to red and one with let let's
03:43 - say H and set it to 30 save the changes
03:46 - now let me use var outside of a function
03:49 - this creates a global variable and
03:52 - attaches that global variable to the
03:54 - window object in browser so in browsers
03:57 - we have this window object which is a
04:00 - complex object with lots of properties
04:04 - and methods when you want to build
04:06 - front-end applications you're gonna work
04:08 - with this window object a lot now what
04:10 - matters here is this Worr keyword
04:14 - attaches this color variable to the
04:16 - window object so if it's a window dot
04:20 - look our color variable is here in
04:23 - contrast when we use the lead keyword to
04:27 - define a global variable that global
04:29 - variable is not
04:30 - attached to the window object so if we
04:32 - type window dot age you can see it's
04:35 - undefined so why is it bad to attach a
04:38 - variable to the window object
04:40 - well because window object is something
04:42 - central there is only one instance of
04:45 - the window object and let's say you're
04:47 - using a third-party library if that
04:50 - third-party library also has a variable
04:52 - with the same name that variable can
04:54 - overwrite your variable so you should
04:57 - avoid adding stuff to the window object
04:59 - otherwise you're going to create all
05:01 - sorts of issues in your programs now for
05:04 - a curious developer I need to mention
05:06 - that when we define a function let's say
05:09 - say hi this function is technically a
05:13 - global function and is added to the
05:15 - window object so let me save the changes
05:18 - if we type window dot say hi see our
05:22 - function is here so we can call it so
05:24 - technically this is a global function
05:26 - it's attached to the window object and
05:28 - that is bad practice but how can we
05:30 - prevent this well later in the course
05:32 - where I talk about modules you will
05:34 - learn how to encapsulate these functions
05:37 - in separate modules so they are not
05:39 - added to the window object so here's
05:42 - what I want you to take away from this
05:43 - lecture avoid using the VAR keyword
05:45 - because it creates variables that are
05:48 - functional scoped not block scoped
05:54 - hi guys thank you for watching my
05:56 - javascript tutorial this tutorial is

06:01 - learn all the essential JavaScript
06:03 - features that every web and mobile
06:05 - application developer must know if
06:07 - you're an absolute beginner or have some
06:09 - experience in JavaScript and are looking
06:11 - for a fun and in-depth course that

Cleaned transcript:

so far we have been declaring variables using the lead keyword but at the beginning of the course I briefly mentioned that there is another way to declare variables using the VAR keyword and you may see this in a lot of JavaScript code online in this lecture we're going to look at the VAR keyword you're going to learn about the problems with the var and why you should avoid it so let's start by defining a function start here we're gonna have a loop let I equal to zero we're going to run this loop five times and in each iteration we're going to display I on the console now I don't let's call the start function save the changes so we get number zero to four now in the last lecture you learned that I is only accessible inside this block so if we try to log I outside of this block we're going to get an error I is not defined I just want to clarify something we still have the same concept if I remove this curly braces because here we have a single statement so the scope of I is still this block here okay so save the changes we still get the same error however let's see what happens when we replace let with var save the changes what happened to our error so it turns out that I is accessible outside of this four block so in the last iteration I becomes 5 because 5 is not less than 5 so the loop terminates and here on line 6 we're displaying the current value of I so this is the issue with the VAR keyword when you declare a variable with var its scope is not limited to the block in which it's defined it's limited to the function in which it's defined and this is not how most or all programming languages out there work it's one of those weird things in JavaScript that we have had for a long time so before es6 var was the only way to declare very and constants starting from
