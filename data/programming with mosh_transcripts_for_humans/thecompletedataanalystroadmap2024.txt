00:00 - if you want to become a data analyst
00:02 - there are several essential skills you
00:03 - need to master let's type in and check
00:05 - them out one by
00:09 - one being a data analyst is all about
00:12 - analyzing data to help make Better
00:14 - Business decisions you'll need to get
00:16 - good at various skills from math and
00:18 - programming to data handling and
00:20 - visualization let's jump in first up you
00:22 - need a solid foundation in mathematics
00:25 - and statistics this is crucial because
00:27 - data analysis relies heavily on these
00:30 - principles focus on understanding basic
00:32 - concepts like mean median standard
00:35 - deviation probability and hypothesis
00:37 - testing spend about a month or two
00:39 - getting comfortable with these topics
00:42 - next you need to get really good at
00:43 - Excel Excel is a powerful tool for data
00:46 - analysis and many companies still rely
00:49 - on it learn how to use functions pivot
00:51 - tables and charts spend about 2 to 3
00:54 - weeks mastering Excel as it's a
00:56 - fundamental skill for any data analyst
00:58 - after Excel you should get comfortable
01:00 - with SQL SQL stands for structured query
01:03 - language it's a simple language we use
01:05 - for managing and querying databases
01:08 - learn how to write queries to access
01:10 - organize and analyze data SQL is pretty
01:13 - simple and you can get a decent grasp of
01:16 - it in about a month or two next you need
01:18 - to get the hang of python it's a
01:20 - versatile language that's widely used in
01:22 - data analysis focus on learning the
01:24 - basics of python including libraries
01:27 - like pandas and nonp you will also hear
01:29 - about r R that's another language used
01:31 - in data analysis however if you're
01:33 - starting out it's best to stick with
01:35 - python first and think about learning R
01:38 - later spend about a month or two getting
01:40 - the hang of python you should also learn
01:42 - git that's a Version Control System we
01:44 - use to track changes to our code and
01:46 - collaborate with others git has a ton of
01:48 - features but you don't need to learn all
01:50 - of them think of it like the 8020 rule
01:52 - 80% of the time you use 20% of GS
01:55 - features so one to two weeks of practice
01:58 - is enough to get up and running by the
02:00 - way to help you on this journey I've
02:01 - created a free supplementary PDF that

02:14 - the description also I have a bunch of
02:16 - tutorials on this channel and complete
02:18 - courses on my website if you're looking
02:20 - for structured learning again links are
02:22 - in the description next focus on data
02:24 - collection and preparation this means
02:26 - Gathering data from various sources and
02:29 - cleaning it up so it's ready for
02:30 - analysis learn how to use Python
02:32 - libraries like pandas to manipulate and
02:35 - clean data spend about a month or two on
02:37 - this once your data is clean you need to
02:40 - visualize it to spot patterns and
02:42 - communicate results learn how to use
02:44 - Python libraries like ma plot lib and
02:46 - Seaborn also check out business
02:48 - intelligence tools like Tableau or
02:50 - powerbi they are widely used for
02:52 - creating interactive and sharable
02:54 - dashboards powerbi is especially cool
02:56 - because it's getting more popular and
02:58 - since it's a Microsoft product it works
03:01 - great with other Microsoft tools you
03:02 - might be using spend about a month or
03:04 - two on data visualization now while not
03:07 - essential for every data analyst role
03:09 - having a basic understanding of machine
03:11 - learning can be a plus machine learning
03:14 - involves teaching computers to make
03:16 - predictions Based on data if you're
03:18 - interested spend a month or two learning
03:20 - the basics of machine learning including
03:22 - python libraries like tensor flow and
03:24 - psychic learn now as you advance you
03:26 - might encounter situations where you
03:28 - need to work with Ma massive data sets
03:30 - that's where Big Data comes in Big Data
03:33 - is all about handling and processing
03:35 - huge amounts of data quickly tools like
03:38 - Hadoop and Spark are super handy for
03:40 - this spend a month or two getting
03:42 - familiar with these tools so if you
03:44 - dedicate 3 to 5 hours every day you can
03:47 - follow this road map and pick up all the
