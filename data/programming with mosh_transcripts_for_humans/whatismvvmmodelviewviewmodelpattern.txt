00:01 - so what is this mvvm all about mvvm
00:05 - stands for model view viewmodel and it's
00:09 - an architectural pattern for
00:11 - implementing user interfaces it consists
00:14 - of three moving parts model which
00:16 - represents the business objects that
00:18 - encapsulate the data and behavior of
00:21 - application domain so if you're building
00:23 - an application for finding flights your
00:25 - application domain model includes
00:27 - classes like flight location time frame
00:30 - and so on the second moving part is the
00:34 - view which is what the user sees in
00:36 - xamarin world that means a page and the
00:40 - third moving part is the view model
00:42 - which is a model specifically designed
00:44 - for the view so it's a class with
00:47 - properties that represent the state of
00:49 - the view and methods that implement the
00:51 - logic behind the view for example
00:53 - imagine we have a page with a list and a
00:56 - button when the user clicks this button
00:59 - a new item is added in the list if you
01:02 - want to create a view model for this
01:03 - view we need a class with a property
01:06 - like items which is an observable
01:08 - collection so this property represents
01:11 - the state of the view the state of the
01:13 - page this class should also have a
01:16 - method like add and this method is
01:18 - called when we click the Add button so
01:21 - pretty simple it's no magic now you
01:24 - might ask but maash what you're saying
01:26 - sounds like the code behind because in
01:29 - the code behind we have this observable
01:31 - collection and this add method in terms
01:33 - of an event handler that is linked to
01:36 - the bun well not really
01:38 - code behind is not view model as I will
01:41 - show you in the next lecture code behind
01:43 - is tightly coupled to summary and this
01:46 - tight coupling makes it hard to unit
01:48 - test this class so by applying MVVM
01:51 - pattern we basically take all the code
01:53 - in the code behind put it in a view
01:56 - model class and modify it slightly so it
01:59 - has no coupling or minimal coupling to
02:01 - Samri and this way we get what we call a
02:04 - plain old CLR object or poco that's a
02:08 - class that has simple properties and
02:10 - methods and we can easily unit test this
02:13 - class
02:14 - so as you might guess you should use
02:16 - mvvm only if you want to unit test your
02:19 - applications presentation logic if you
02:21 - don't do unit testing you really don't
02:23 - need nvvm and it's actually better to
02:26 - write all the code in the code behind
02:28 - because as you will see in this section
02:30 - mvvm involves some challenges and
02:33 - sometimes you have to write a bit more
02:35 - code but you do this for a reason for
02:38 - decoupling your applications code from
02:40 - xamarin so you can test it if you're not
02:43 - going to write unit tests for your
02:44 - application you would just waste your
02:46 - time implementing mvvm let me tell you
02:49 - something no end-user cares how many
02:52 - design or architectural patterns you
02:54 - have used in your code users want
02:56 - applications that work applications that
02:58 - are user friendly reliable and fast they
03:01 - don't care about nvvm nobody is going to
03:04 - give you a price for using a mvvm so
03:06 - here's my pragmatic suggestion if your
03:09 - building is small or even medium sized
03:11 - an application and you don't plan on
03:13 - writing unit tests for your application
03:15 - it's perfectly fine to write all the
03:17 - code in the code behind you don't need a
03:19 - mvvm but as your application grows
03:22 - larger you would really benefit from
03:24 - unit testing and that's when you start
03:27 - refactoring your code to make it unit
03:29 - testable so don't start with mvvm right
03:32 - from the get-go you would increase
03:34 - complexity without gaining anything now
03:38 - just one thing even if you're not
03:40 - familiar with unit testing I want you to
03:43 - watch this section thoroughly because
03:45 - the concepts I'm going to cover will
03:47 - help you have a better understanding of
03:49 - software design I'm gonna talk about
03:52 - interfaces dependencies loose coupling
03:55 - and so on so watch all the videos and if
03:58 - some of them are challenging and beyond
04:00 - your level that's perfectly fine I don't
04:02 - expect you to walk away and be an mvvm
04:05 - expert but at least I want you to hear
04:08 - the concept I'm going to talk about in
04:10 - this section because it's very likely
04:12 - that you're going to hear these concepts
04:13 - again in the future so if you have a
04:16 - background and you heard it once before
04:18 - it's going to be much easier in the
04:19 - future
04:20 - with all that let's get started
04:24 - hi guys Marsh here I hope you're having
04:27 - a fantastic day or night wherever you
04:30 - are in the world this tutorial you've
04:32 - been watching is actually part of my
04:34 - summer informs course where you will
04:36 - learn everything about building
04:37 - cross-platform mobile apps with sushar
04:40 - in that course we have a more in-depth
04:43 - discussion of the MVVM pattern I'm gonna
04:45 - show you a sample application without
04:47 - the MVVM pattern and then explain why we
04:50 - need the MVVM pattern there and how to
04:53 - implement it in case you're interested
04:55 - to enroll in the full course I've put
04:57 - the link for you in the video
04:59 - description and if not that's perfectly
05:01 - fine have a great day
05:08 - all right to see mvvm in action I have
05:10 - built a very simple application and if
05:13 - you want to code along with me download
05:15 - the zip file I have attached to this
05:16 - lecture so first let's see what this
05:18 - application does here we have an Add
05:21 - button on the toolbar when we click that
05:24 - it creates a playlist object and add it
05:27 - to our list let's try a few times note
05:30 - that the title of the page is
05:31 - dynamically updated and here we have for
05:34 - playlist also below each playlist we
05:37 - have this detail label which determines
05:40 - if we have marked this playlist as
05:42 - favorite or not now if I tap on one of
05:45 - these playlists favorite becomes true
05:48 - and the color of playlist changes to
05:51 - pink if I tap it again it goes back to
05:54 - its previous state so very simple
05:56 - application it exhibits a few patterns
05:59 - here we have a list we have selection of
06:02 - items we have adding an item to a list
06:05 - and we have obtaining the page title and
06:08 - here is the source code for this project
06:10 - so we have models folder where we have
06:14 - our playlist class and we also have
06:17 - views with two pages playlist detail
06:21 - page and playlists page now as we work
06:24 - through this section we'll explore each
06:26 - of these files in detail now let's take
06:28 - a quick look at the code behind for our
06:31 - main page which is playlists page so
06:35 - here we have an observable collection
06:36 - which is used as the item source for our
06:39 - ListView very similar to what you have
06:41 - seen before no magic note that we are
06:44 - setting the item source in on appearing
06:46 - method below that we have to event
06:50 - handlers one is on add playlist and the
06:54 - other is on playlist selector again the
06:57 - code you see here is very very simple
06:59 - and you have seen several examples
07:00 - similar days throughout the course so
07:03 - I'm not going to explain this line by
07:04 - line but I want to point out a few
07:06 - reasons why this class is not unit
07:09 - testable
07:11 - the first problem is this on appearing
07:14 - method so this method as you know is
07:17 - called automatically by the framework
07:19 - when the page appears
07:20 - now in this method we are sending the
07:23 - item source for the ListView the problem
07:26 - with this method is that we cannot call
07:28 - it from our unit tests because it's
07:30 - protected and I cannot change this to
07:34 - public either because here we are
07:36 - overriding on appearing method that is
07:39 - defined in the base class content page
07:42 - so I cannot call this in a unit test and
07:44 - assert that the itemssource property of
07:47 - ListView is initialized now there is a
07:50 - hack around this we can potentially
07:52 - extract this logic into a public method
07:55 - that we can call from our unit tests but
07:58 - that's really a hack it's not the proper
08:00 - way the unit test this code so we have
08:03 - to revert this back to protected
08:06 - another problem is this ListView object
08:09 - itself as you know this is a private
08:12 - field in this class same applies to any
08:15 - other controls that we have in ours MO
08:16 - and we give them an X name we'll get a
08:19 - private field in this class now if
08:22 - you're directly working with these
08:23 - controls and the code-behind we cannot
08:26 - write unit tests to make assertions
08:28 - about the state of these private fields
08:30 - again we have to jump through the hoops
08:32 - we have to expose them as public
08:34 - properties and this is really messy
08:37 - let's look at another example
08:41 - look at these two event handlers again
08:43 - both of these are private methods if you
08:46 - want to call them from the outside we
08:48 - have to make them public no that's not
08:50 - the end of the world but imagine we had
08:52 - a call to display alert here and ask the
08:57 - user to confirm something now what is
08:59 - the problem here the problem is that in
09:01 - our unit tests we don't have a
09:03 - confirmation box
09:05 - so in a nutshell the problem with this
09:08 - code is that it's tightly coupled to
09:10 - xamarin if you want to unit test this
09:12 - the first step is to extract as much
09:15 - code as possible into a separate class
09:17 - that we call a view model and this view
09:19 - model should be decoupled from xamarin
09:21 - or any other presentation frameworks and
09:24 - this way we can easily unit test this
09:26 - because this view model is going to be
09:28 - what we call a plain old CLR object or
09:32 - poco it's a simple class with a few
09:35 - simple properties and methods it doesn't
09:37 - have event handlers like these private
09:39 - methods here it doesn't have any
09:41 - references to objects like select an
09:43 - item changed event args and so on so
09:47 - starting from the next lecture we're
09:49 - going to refactor this code step by step
09:51 - and extract as much logic as possible
09:54 - into a view model ideally this code
09:57 - behind should be empty but that's an
09:58 - ideal point and may not always happen as
10:00 - you will see later in this section so
10:03 - now let's start refactoring this code
