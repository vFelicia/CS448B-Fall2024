With timestamps:

00:03 - In almost every program, there are times
you need to make decisions and that's
00:08 - when you use an if statement here is an
example let's say we have a variable
00:13 - called temperature we set it to 35 now
if temperature is greater than 30
00:19 - perhaps we want to display a message to
the user so we use an if statement if
00:25 - after if we add a condition which is
basically a boolean expression an
00:30 - expression that produces a boolean value
so if temperature is greater than 30
00:36 - here we have a boolean expression if
this expression evaluates to true the
00:42 - following statements will be executed
let me show you now here is the
00:46 - important part that a lot of beginners
miss when you use an if statement
00:50 - you should always terminate your
statement with a colon now let's see
00:56 - what happens when I press ENTER our
cursor is indented so here we have two
01:01 - white spaces this is very important
because using these indentations Python
01:06 - interpreter will know what statements
should be executed if this condition is
01:11 - true here we want to print a message
like it's warm we can print another
01:18 - message as well drink water so we can
have as many statements as we want here
01:24 - as long as they are indented they belong
to this if block now when we finish here
01:31 - we should remove indentation to indicate
the end of this if block so here we can
01:36 - add a print statement with a message
like done this statement will always be
01:41 - executed whether this condition is true
or not now note that when I save the
01:47 - changes this indentation you see here is
going to be doubled up take a look
01:52 - save there you go so when we save the
changes auto kept eight reformat our
01:58 - code and uses four white spaces for
indentation so one two three four it
02:04 - uses four white spaces because that's
what pepp eight recommends alright now
02:09 - let's run this program so because
temperature
02:13 - is greater than 30 we see the first two
messages and we see the dawn message
02:18 - regardless so if I change the
temperature to let's say 15 and run the
02:24 - program one more time
look this dawn message is executed
02:29 - whether our condition is true or not so
pay great attention to these
02:33 - indentations that's one of the issues I
see in beginners code let's say they
02:38 - want both these print statements to be
executed if the condition is true
02:42 - accidentally they remove the indentation
on the fourth line and that's why their
02:47 - program doesn't work as they expect so
be careful about this now what if you
02:53 - want to have multiple conditions we use
an elephant so L if that is short for
03:00 - else/if here we can add another
condition another expression so
03:05 - temperature is greater than 20 once
again :
03:09 - enter a by default here vs code is using
two white spaces so don't worry about
03:15 - this as soon as you save the changes
those two white spaces will be converted
03:20 - to four white spaces so let's print a
different message
03:24 - it's nice save the changes now look all
these lines are indented consistently
03:32 - you can have as many Elif statements as
you want and optionally you can also
03:37 - have an else statement so if none of the
previous conditions are true then what
03:44 - you have in the else block will be
executed once again we add the colon
03:49 - annotation print here we can add a
message like it's called saying the
03:56 - changes in this case temperature is 15
so none of these two conditions will be
04:02 - true and we will see it's called let's
run the program there you go
04:14 - in this lecture I'm going to show you a
technique for writing cleaner code so
04:19 - let's say we're building an application
for university and we want to check to
04:23 - see if the person who's applying for
this university program is eligible or
04:28 - not so we start by defining a variable
called age set it to 22 now if H is
04:36 - greater than or equal to 18 colon print
eligible remove the indentation else
04:46 - colon print not eligible let's run a
program make sure it works beautiful now
04:55 - there is nothing wrong in this piece of
code but I want to show you a cleaner
04:59 - way to achieve the same result instead
of having a print statement here we can
05:05 - define a variable like message and set
it to this string that is the first step
05:12 - so message equals this string and then
we will print this message now when you
05:21 - have an if-else statement with this
structure where you're basically
05:25 - assigning a value to a variable you can
rewrite this in a simpler way so this is
05:32 - how it works all we want to do over
these few lines is to assign a value to
05:37 - this message variable right so we start
with message we set it to eligible if H
05:45 - is greater than or equal to 18 else we
set it to not eligible
05:51 - this statement is almost like plain
English so what we have on line 7 is
05:57 - exactly equivalent to these 4 lines of
code
06:01 - delete save the changes run the program
you can see this person is eligible if I
06:08 - change the age to 12 and run the program
we get not eligible
06:15 - so what we have here is called ternary
operator
06:24 - in Python we have three logical
operators and we use these operators to
06:30 - model more complex conditions so these
operators are and or and not let's see a
06:39 - real-world example of using these
operators so imagine we're building an
06:43 - application for processing loans so we
need two variables high income we can
06:50 - set this to true and good underline
credit we set it to true now here's the
06:57 - condition we want to implement if the
applicant has high income and good
07:03 - credit score then they are eligible for
the loan
07:06 - so if high income and good credit we add
the colon and print eligible now note
07:17 - that here I have not compared the value
of this variable with true that is one
07:22 - of the issues I see in a lot of
beginners code this is redundant and
07:26 - unprofessional because high income is a
boolean so it's either true or false we
07:32 - don't need to compare true with true so
if this condition is true and this
07:38 - second condition is true then we will
print eligible in the terminal so save
07:45 - the changes and run the program
obviously this person is eligible
07:49 - however if one of these conditions is
false we will not see eligible in the
07:56 - terminal so let's add an else statement
here and print not eligible run the
08:05 - program we see not eligible so this is
how the and operator works with an
08:11 - operator if both conditions are true the
result will be true in contrast with the
08:17 - or operator as long as at least one of
the conditions is true the result will
08:23 - be true so if I replace and with or here
we should see eligible and the terminal
08:30 - let's run it one more time there you go
so these are the and an or operator
08:36 - now let's take a look at an example of
the nut operator so I'm gonna define
08:40 - another variable steel and set it to
true temporarily I'm gonna remove this
08:46 - expression and simplify it we'll come
back to this later so let's say if the
08:51 - person is eligible if they are not a
student
08:54 - the nut operator basically inverses the
value of a boolean so in this case
09:00 - student is true when we apply the not
operator the result will be false so in
09:07 - this case our condition will be false
and that's why this print statement will
09:11 - not be executed let me show you so save
run the program they are not eligible if
09:18 - student was false when we apply the nut
operator will get true so our condition
09:24 - will be true and we'll see it eligible
let's run it one more time there you go
09:29 - with this operators we can model even
more complex conditions here is an
09:35 - example a person can be eligible if they
have either high income or good credit
09:41 - and they should not be used to do that
let me show you how to implement this
09:47 - condition so if high income or good
credit we want at least one of these
09:55 - conditions to be true so we put these in
parentheses we want to separate these
10:01 - from the other condition which is not a
student now the result of this should be
10:06 - true which means at least one of these
conditions should be true after that
10:11 - we'll add and not student
and finally caught so we this operators
10:19 - you can model all kinds of real-world
scenarios
10:29 - so here's the example from the last
lecture a person is eligible for a loan
10:34 - if they have high income and good credit
and they are not a student
10:40 - now one thing you need to know about
these boolean operators is that their
10:44 - short circuit what do we mean by that
well when python interpreter
10:49 - wants to evaluate this expression it
starts from the first argument if this
10:55 - is true it continues the evaluation to
see if the second argument is also true
11:00 - so it continues the evaluation all the
way to the end of this expression
11:05 - however as soon as one of these
arguments is false the evaluation stops
11:11 - let me show you what I mean so if I
change high-income to false when Python
11:16 - interpreter sees this expression it
starts here it knows that high-income is
11:22 - false so it doesn't matter what comes
after the result of this entire
11:28 - expression will always be false because
at least one of the arguments or one of
11:33 - the operands is false this is what we
call short-circuiting just like the
11:38 - short-circuit concept we have in
electronics so the evaluation stops as
11:43 - soon as one of these arguments evaluates
to false we have the same concept with
11:49 - the or operator so if I change these and
operators to or let's see what happens
11:56 - with the or operator we know that at
least one of the arguments should be
12:01 - true so the evaluation stops as soon as
we find an argument that evaluates to
12:06 - true in this case when Python
interpreter evaluates this expression it
12:11 - sees that high-income is false so it
continues the evaluation hoping that the
12:16 - next argument will be true here good
credit is true so evaluation stops and
12:22 - the result of this entire expression
will be true
12:26 - so in Python logical operators are
short-circuit
12:36 - in this lecture I'm gonna show you how
to chain comparison operators this is a
12:42 - very powerful technique for writing
clean code here is an example let's say
12:47 - we want to implement a rule that says
age should be between 18 and 65 here's
12:54 - how we can implement it so we define a
variable like age set it to 22 now if
13:00 - age is greater than or equal to 18 and
age is less than 65 then we print
13:08 - eligible now here's a question for you
how do we write this rule in mass we can
13:14 - write it like this
13:17 - well more accurately we should have an
equal sign here so age should be between
13:23 - 18 and 65 this is how we write this rule
in math now I've got some good news for
13:29 - you we can write the exact same
expression in Python
13:33 - so I'm going to move this up put an if
statement here line 4 and line 3 are
13:41 - exactly equivalent but as you can see
line 4 is cleaner and easier to read so
13:46 - let's get rid of line 3
this is what we call chaining comparison
13:53 - operators
14:00 - all right here is a little quiz for you
I want you to pause the video and think
14:06 - about this quiz for 10 to 20 seconds
what do you think we'll see on the
14:10 - terminal when we run this program so
pause the video figure out the answer
14:15 - when you're ready come back continue
watching
14:21 - all right let's see what happens when we
run this program first we get this if
14:25 - statement in this case we're comparing
two different objects for equality and
14:29 - these objects have different types we
have a number compared for this string
14:34 - so number 10 and string 10 are not equal
that is why a will not be printed on the
14:40 - terminal so the control moves to the
Elif part here we have two boolean
14:46 - expressions here's the first one here's
the second one and they are combined
14:52 - using the logical end so if both these
expressions are evaluated to true then
14:58 - this entire expression will be true and
we will see beyond the terminal let's
15:03 - see if both these expressions are
evaluated to true here's the first part
15:07 - bag is greater than Apple that is true
because when we sort this words bag
15:13 - comes after Apple but look at the second
part this expression is evaluated to
15:19 - false because bag is not greater than
cat so when we applied the logical end
15:24 - between true and false the result will
be false that is why this statement will
15:31 - not be executed so to control moves to
the else part and when we run this
15:36 - program the letter C will be printed on
the terminal
