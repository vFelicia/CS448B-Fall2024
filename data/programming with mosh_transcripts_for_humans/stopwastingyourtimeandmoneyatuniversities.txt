00:00 - hi my name is Mohammad Ani and I've
00:02 - taught over three million people how to
00:04 - code or how to become a top professional
00:07 - software engineer and here's my story
00:09 - yep that's me
00:11 - a typical day in college studying for my
00:13 - master's degree in software engineering
00:14 - pretty impressive right
00:16 - I was bored with so much theory and
00:19 - irrelevant subjects when I started
00:20 - working I realized that only 20% of what
00:23 - I learned was actually useful the other
00:26 - 80% was a complete waste of time and
00:28 - money so that's six ten years or twenty
00:31 - three hundred days or eleven thousand
00:33 - hours that I will never get back that's
00:35 - why I started code with mush
00:37 - to help you get your dream coding job
00:39 - and make more money by teaching you what
00:41 - I have learned over the past 18 years
00:43 - forget spending yours in a classroom
00:45 - blowing money on books and learning
00:47 - things are never gonna use you can learn
00:49 - coding right from your own home you ma
00:51 - should I throw out this calculus book
00:52 - please about this physics book that one
00:57 - too
00:58 - and uh biology what does boil is you
01:01 - have to do with programming these are
01:04 - the subjects that colleges make you pay
01:05 - for and you will never use at code
01:07 - mid-march comm we teach you the actual
01:09 - skills you will need to become a top
01:12 - professional software engineer the kind
01:14 - of engineer that companies love to hire
01:16 - you have online courses on web and
01:18 - mobile app development for people at all
01:20 - coding levels if you're tired of
01:22 - instructors that over-explain copy paste
01:25 - code sound like a robot and are boring
01:27 - as hell you're gonna love my courses
01:29 - they're all clear and concise and based
01:31 - on real-world examples no fubar buzz
01:33 - nonsense here all courses come with a
01:36 - 30-day money-back guarantee and a
01:38 - certificate of completion all of that
01:40 - for a fraction of a fraction of a
01:42 - fraction of what you pay for college
01:43 - here are a few reviews from some of my
01:45 - happiest customers here is Vahid he had
01:48 - trouble passing technical interviews but
01:50 - after taking my courses he could answer
01:52 - every single question in these
01:54 - interviews here's Anna after taking my
01:56 - courses she became a certified web
01:58 - developer and now she's working at a
02:00 - fantastic startup here's Daanish he used
02:03 - to be a security guard but after taking
02:05 - my courses he got his first job as a
02:07 - software developer and here is Quran he
02:10 - has been winning code competitions in
02:12 - India
02:13 - and extending his work every single day
02:15 - you can't be one of these people - I
02:17 - strongly believe in you so head over to
02:19 - code with Marsh calm and subscribe now
02:21 - to get unlimited access to all the
02:23 - questions you will need to become a top
02:25 - professional and software engineer hey
