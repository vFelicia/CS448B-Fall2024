00:06 - fluff and fix the mistakes that are
00:08 - sabotaging your
00:10 - [Music]
00:12 - progress I'm MH hamadani and I've spent
00:14 - the last 10 years not just as a software
00:17 - engineer but also teaching people like
00:19 - you how to code I've seen the same
00:21 - mistakes hold even the smartest folks
00:23 - back so in this video I'm taking that
00:25 - experience and giving you the shortcut
00:28 - the five critical mistakes to void so
00:30 - you can land that coding job fast
00:32 - mistake number one learning too many
00:34 - things at once you hear JavaScript is
00:37 - essential but then someone says python
00:39 - is the easiest then you see job postings
00:41 - asking for C++ or Java so before you
00:44 - know it you're down the rabbit hole of
00:46 - languages and feeling totally
00:48 - overwhelmed here's the thing trying to
00:50 - master Everything at Once is a recipe
00:52 - for par out let's simplify want to build
00:55 - awesome websites JavaScript is your Chan
00:57 - dreaming of making games C or C++ is the
01:01 - way to go fascinated by Ai and data
01:04 - python is your starting point now you
01:06 - might hear someone out there saying but
01:08 - you can do all of that with JavaScript
01:10 - yes it's true but JavaScript really
01:12 - shines for web development it's not the
01:14 - best language for game development or
01:16 - machine learning so pick one language
01:18 - and stick to it mistake number two
01:21 - thinking one language is the Magic
01:23 - Bullet so you have picked JavaScript for
01:25 - web development awesome but here is the
01:27 - truth mastering JavaScript alone is is
01:30 - not going to land you a job you have to
01:31 - learn a bunch of other stuff as well for
01:34 - example to become a web developer you
01:36 - also need to master HTML CSS react and a
01:39 - bunch of other tools and that brings us
01:42 - to the next mistake chasing the shiny
01:44 - and unrelated you have all done that
01:46 - you're learning JavaScript then bam
01:48 - blockchain or AI is the future next
01:51 - thing you know you're halfway through a
01:52 - python course your website is unfinished
01:54 - and you're starting to doubt yourself
01:56 - focus is your superpower right now if
01:59 - you want to succeed as a developer you
02:01 - need to have a goal what kind of job are
02:03 - you looking for do you want to be a
02:04 - frontend developer a backend developer a
02:07 - game developer a data scientist what do
02:09 - you want to do these are very different
02:12 - paths requiring different skills if you
02:14 - don't have a Target you will never hit
02:16 - the mark do your research check out job
02:19 - postings in your area see what skills
02:20 - are in demand and what kind of salaries
02:22 - you can expect now mistake number five
02:25 - tutorial hell look tutorials are great
02:28 - and I create them myself but bouncing
02:30 - between YouTube videos leaves you
02:32 - feeling lost when you are starting out
02:34 - you need structure you need a clear path
02:37 - that's designed to get your job ready
02:39 - fast and here's the other side of
02:40 - tutorial hell a lot of people find
02:42 - really long courses on udemy and assume
02:45 - that just because a course is long it's
02:47 - very detailed and teaches them
02:49 - everything they need in reality most
02:51 - people hardly ever finish these courses
02:53 - because they have so much padding and
02:55 - repetition plus as I said to become job
02:58 - ready you have to learn a few different
03:00 - skills not just one programming language
03:02 - you don't have 68 hours to spend on just
03:04 - JavaScript look this other course is 62
03:07 - hours if you spend 50 hours on each of
03:10 - the essential skills you need for a job
03:12 - you need 450 hours just to watch these
03:14 - courses let alone coding and practicing
03:17 - which often takes double the course
03:18 - length that's a Target you're never
03:20 - going to hit instead look for shorter
03:22 - courses that packing the most essential
03:25 - skills in the least amount of time I
03:27 - hope this gets you pumped and back on
