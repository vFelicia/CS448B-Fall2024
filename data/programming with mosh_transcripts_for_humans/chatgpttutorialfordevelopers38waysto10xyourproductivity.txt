00:00 - [Music]
00:00 - in this tutorial you're going to learn
00:03 - all about what chat GPT is how it works
00:06 - and most importantly how you can use it
00:08 - to boost your productivity as a software
00:10 - developer as a seasoned developer and
00:13 - teacher let me tell you chat GPT is a
00:15 - game changer you don't want to miss out
00:17 - on don't take my word for it just watch
00:19 - this video and see for yourself
00:23 - [Music]
00:25 - my name is mosh hamadani and I'm super
00:27 - excited to be bringing you this tutorial
00:29 - on chat GPT I've helped millions of
00:31 - people learn to code and become
00:33 - professional software Engineers through
00:35 - this Channel and my online school
00:37 - codewithmash.com if you are new here
00:39 - make sure to subscribe so you never miss
00:41 - a video
00:42 - so what exactly is chat GPT and how does
00:45 - it work chat jpt is a Cutting Edge AI
00:48 - tool created by open AI it was released
00:51 - in November 2022 and gained 1 million
00:54 - users in just 5 days in comparison it
00:57 - took Netflix three and a half years and
00:59 - Instagram two and a half months to get
01:01 - the same number of users chat gbt is an
01:04 - advanced language model that can
01:06 - understand and generate text you can use
01:08 - it to create content for your website
01:10 - write articles emails tweets cover
01:13 - letters and so on you can also use it to
01:15 - generate code in a number of different
01:17 - programming languages like python
01:18 - JavaScript HTML CSS and much much more
01:22 - you can use it to generate dummy data
01:24 - write unit tests translate text or code
01:27 - from one language to another you can use
01:29 - it to explain code for example if there
01:31 - is a piece of code you don't understand
01:32 - you can ask it and it will explain to
01:34 - you like a patient teacher but I have to
01:37 - be honest sometimes it explains too much
01:39 - chat GPT can also help you learn and
01:42 - remember things faster for example you
01:44 - can give it some text and have it ask
01:46 - you a bunch of questions it can also
01:48 - prepare you for job interviews you can
01:50 - have it improve your resume write a
01:52 - cover letter for you and also interview
01:54 - you like an interviewer now do you think
01:57 - chat GPT is going to take your job let
01:59 - me know in the comments below the
02:00 - reality is whether you like it or not
02:02 - chat GPT is here to stay in this
02:05 - tutorial I'm going to show you how to
02:06 - use it to get more creative and get
02:08 - things done a lot faster I'll be showing
02:11 - you various examples for different
02:12 - programming languages both for beginners
02:15 - and experienced developers but before we
02:17 - dive into that let's take a moment and
02:19 - understand how chat gbt works chat GPT
02:23 - uses a type of artificial intelligence
02:25 - called a language model a language model
02:28 - is a type of software that is designed
02:30 - to understand and generate human
02:32 - language it does this by looking at a
02:35 - large amount of Text data and learning
02:37 - the patterns and rules of a language for
02:40 - example if the language model is trained
02:42 - on a lot of English texts it will learn
02:44 - about the grammar and structure of
02:46 - English as well as the meanings of words
02:48 - and how they are used in different
02:50 - contexts once the language model has
02:52 - learned about a language it can then be
02:54 - used to generate text in that language
02:56 - now chat GPT provides different language
02:59 - models for different purposes gpt3
03:02 - models which are designed to understand
03:04 - and generate natural language like
03:06 - English and codecs which are
03:08 - specifically trained to understand and
03:10 - generate code these models are trained
03:13 - on billions of lines of code publicly
03:15 - available on GitHub they're mostly
03:17 - capable in Python but they're also
03:19 - pretty good in a bunch of other
03:20 - languages like HTML CSS says JavaScript
03:23 - typescript Ruby SQL and more now before
03:27 - we look at specific examples remember
03:29 - shot GPT like any tool has limitations
03:32 - it might sometimes generate incorrect
03:34 - harmful or biased information so don't
03:37 - take whatever it tells you as a silver
03:39 - bullet don't use it to learn to code
03:41 - because the code that is generated is
03:43 - not guaranteed to be right it might be
03:45 - functional but it might not be the best
03:47 - way to code so in a nutshell chatgpt is
03:51 - a powerful tool that can help you be
03:52 - more creative and efficient but it's not
03:55 - a substitute for human expertise and
03:56 - judgment so that's the theory part now
03:59 - let's move on and see chat GPT in action
04:01 - so head over to
04:03 - chat.openai.com if you don't have an
04:05 - account sign up it takes only a minute
04:08 - once you have logged in you're going to
04:10 - see the main screen with an input box to
04:12 - talk to chat GPT there is also a Chrome
04:14 - extension and a desktop application
04:16 - available if you don't want to use the
04:18 - web interface I'll put the links down
04:20 - below this video alright now let's get
04:22 - to the fun part going forward I'll be
04:24 - showing you various use cases for
04:26 - different programming languages we'll
04:28 - start off with some general purpose
04:30 - questions that apply to anyone
04:31 - regardless of the programming languages
04:33 - and tools they use you will see how you
04:36 - can use chat GPT to learn new things
04:38 - write shell scripts get commands start a
04:41 - business write legal documents and so on
04:44 - once we cover the basics then we'll dive
04:46 - into specific examples for front-end
04:48 - back-end and database development I will
04:51 - show you examples using HTML CSS
04:54 - JavaScript typescript python SQL and
04:57 - more
05:00 - now here's my first question what are
05:02 - the top three books for learning Java
05:12 - all right as you can see chat GPT has
05:14 - given us a very comprehensive and
05:16 - detailed answer now here we can ask more
05:18 - detailed questions for example we can
05:21 - ask questions about the first book so we
05:23 - can ask what are the key takeaways from
05:27 - head first Java
05:34 - all right another comprehensive answer
05:36 - you can see that this book teaches you
05:39 - about object-oriented programming Java
05:42 - fundamentals threading and concurrency
05:44 - GUI programming and so on now we can
05:47 - also ask more general questions like how
05:49 - do I become a front-end developer
05:58 - so now chat GPT is saying that to become
06:01 - a front-end developer you need to know
06:03 - the basics of HTML CSS and JavaScript
06:06 - you should practice building websites
06:09 - then you should learn a front-end
06:11 - framework like react angular View and so
06:13 - on you should also know about Version
06:15 - Control Systems like git GitHub and Swap
06:18 - this is pretty much the same answer you
06:20 - will find on every website that gives
06:22 - you a roadmap to become a front-end
06:25 - developer
06:26 - now let's look at more specific examples
06:28 - we can ask chatgpt to write a shell
06:31 - command for us for example we can say
06:33 - write a bash command to find the name of
06:36 - all JPEG files in the directory and
06:40 - write them all to a text file
06:43 - take a look
06:48 - I love this answer so if you're not good
06:51 - with Linux commands you can easily find
06:54 - the final instruction you should use to
06:56 - solve that problem but what is beautiful
06:58 - about chatgpt is that it also explains
07:01 - how this command Works line by line
07:03 - piece by piece we can also have chat GPT
07:07 - red git commands for us for example we
07:09 - can ask how do I know
07:11 - how many lines of code
07:14 - I've committed to a git Repository
07:22 - we can also use chat GPT to get creative
07:25 - for example let's say you want to start
07:27 - a business you can have chat GPT
07:29 - generate app or website names for you
07:31 - for example we can say I want to make a
07:35 - revolutionary online shopping app give
07:39 - me some good app names
07:46 - so chatgpt is suggesting names like shop
07:49 - is Swift cart streamline and so on I
07:52 - think this list is pretty damn good now
07:54 - these are just some example prompt you
07:56 - don't need to use the exact same wording
07:58 - to talk to chat GPT you can ask any
08:00 - questions you want in your own way now
08:03 - if you have used this tool before let us
08:05 - know in the comments below the
08:06 - interesting questions you have asked so
08:08 - we can all learn and Inspire each other
08:10 - we can also ask chat GPT to write
08:13 - contracts for us here's an example I
08:16 - want to hire a graphic designer to
08:18 - design a website
08:20 - we have agreed
08:22 - that they will deliver the first draft
08:25 - in two weeks and offer three iterations
08:29 - free of charge
08:31 - any iteration after will be charged
08:34 - at fifty dollars an hour write a
08:37 - contract for us so the more details we
08:40 - give to chat GPT the better response
08:43 - we'll get
08:48 - all right take a look
08:50 - this is a pretty damn good contract to
08:53 - start with of course you don't want to
08:54 - take this as is and use it in the real
08:56 - world without first passing it by a real
08:58 - lawyer that's why earlier I told you
09:01 - that chat CPT is not a replacement for
09:02 - humans at least none at the moment it's
09:05 - just a way to increase your productivity
09:07 - and get things done in less time
09:09 - now if you're applying for a job there
09:11 - are a number of ways chat GPT can help
09:13 - you for example you can have it write a
09:15 - resume for you hear me can say I have
09:18 - three years of experience coding in HTML
09:22 - CSS and JavaScript
09:24 - write a resume for me of course we can
09:27 - give it more details we can explain our
09:29 - education level our past projects and so
09:32 - on but look at what we get with this
09:34 - simple prompt
09:39 - all right take a look
09:42 - so chat GPT created a basic layout
09:45 - that includes our name address phone
09:48 - number email some objective summary
09:51 - technical skills and it has already
09:53 - listed all the related web Technologies
09:56 - so we have HTML CSS JavaScript jQuery
10:00 - bootstrap we didn't mention any of this
10:02 - but it assumed that we have these skills
10:04 - it also included a section about
10:06 - professional experience including past
10:08 - projects as well as education
10:12 - certifications and so on again it's a
10:15 - great starting point now let's say
10:17 - you're applying for a front-end
10:18 - developer role you can ask chatgpt to
10:21 - write a cover letter for you that you
10:23 - can email to that company so we can say
10:26 - applying for a front and engineer role
10:30 - at some company
10:32 - write a cover letter for me
10:40 - all right take a look
10:41 - we have a comprehensive cover letter
10:43 - beautifully written in perfect English
10:46 - how good is that now let me show you
10:48 - another fun one you can have chat GPT
10:50 - ask you interview questions we can say
10:53 - act as a technical interviewer and ask
10:57 - me five questions about JavaScript
11:00 - take a look
11:07 - all right so here we have five questions
11:09 - that are often asked in technical
11:10 - interviews now let's say you don't know
11:12 - the answer to the first question you can
11:14 - ask a follow-up question so the beauty
11:17 - of chat GPT is that it remembers
11:19 - everything you have told it in this
11:21 - conversation thread so here we can say
11:23 - what is the answer to the first question
11:32 - again we get a very comprehensive
11:34 - detailed answer you can also ask chat
11:37 - GPT to help you write emails for example
11:40 - we can say write an email to my boss
11:43 - asking for a raise
11:45 - I've worked at this company
11:47 - for two years and successfully
11:50 - delivered several projects
11:54 - on time
12:01 - seriously if I wanted to write this
12:03 - myself it would take me 10 to 15 minutes
12:05 - if not longer I got the answer in just
12:08 - two seconds
12:09 - all right now let's look at a few
12:11 - examples involving code we'll start with
12:13 - using python for writing a command line
12:15 - tool we can say write a python function
12:19 - for generating a random password
12:29 - so as you can see we get a piece of code
12:31 - beautifully highlighted with explanation
12:34 - of how it works now if there's a part of
12:36 - this code that you don't understand you
12:38 - can always ask follow-up questions for
12:41 - example we can ask what this expression
12:43 - does in this code so we can ask what
12:46 - does
12:47 - 4 in I range of length 2 in this code
12:53 - take a look
12:58 - really really useful couldn't be better
13:01 - now we can also ask computer science
13:03 - questions like what is the time
13:06 - complexity of this function
13:09 - now if you're not familiar with this
13:11 - concept time complexity is a way to
13:13 - explain how large inputs impact the
13:16 - performance of an algorithm it's really
13:18 - beyond the scope of this tutorial I've
13:20 - covered it in detail in my data
13:22 - structures course in case you're
13:24 - interested so let's see what we get
13:31 - so chat GPT is saying that this
13:33 - function's time complexity is linear now
13:36 - let's take this to the next level we can
13:38 - ask chatgpt to write unit tests for this
13:41 - function so write unit tests for this
13:44 - function
13:51 - seriously how good is this if I wanted
13:53 - to write all this unit tests by hand it
13:55 - would take me probably 20 to 30 minutes
13:57 - if not longer of course we should always
13:59 - use our own judgment to make sure that
14:01 - the tests are correct but I think this
14:03 - code is a great starting point and it
14:05 - really saves us a lot of time
14:07 - we can also ask chat GPT for ideas to
14:10 - improve our code for example here on
14:13 - w3schools.com we have this piece of
14:16 - python code where we use a for Loop to
14:19 - iterate over a list of fruits if the
14:21 - fruit has a in it then we add it to a
14:24 - new list I'm going to copy this code and
14:27 - give it to chat GPT to see how we can
14:29 - improve this code so take a look
14:32 - how can I improve this code now here we
14:36 - should hold shift and then press enter
14:37 - so we go to the next line now we paste
14:40 - our code and then press enter to submit
14:42 - the question
14:48 - all right look a lot of details
14:51 - absolutely amazing one thing I love here
14:53 - is that chat apt is suggesting to use a
14:56 - list comprehension which is a one-liner
14:59 - for implementing the same logic of
15:01 - course there are more ways to improve
15:03 - this code we are not going to get into
15:04 - details here
15:05 - we can also ask chat jpt to convert our
15:08 - code from one language to another for
15:10 - example we can say convert this python
15:13 - code to JavaScript
15:18 - foreign
15:21 - just a few seconds our code was
15:24 - converted to JavaScript and down below
15:26 - we have all the details about how this
15:29 - code works
15:31 - we can also use chat CPT to generate
15:33 - dummy data for example we can say
15:36 - generate dummy data for a table called
15:39 - customers each customer should have an
15:43 - ID
15:44 - first name last name and City
15:52 - now in this case chat GPT gave us a
15:55 - python script for generating dummy data
15:58 - but what if we want the actual data not
16:00 - a python script we can say I don't need
16:03 - a python script just give me the data
16:13 - so now we get a list of 10 people
16:16 - represented using the Json format now we
16:19 - can take this to the next level and say
16:21 - create a python class for storing these
16:25 - objects
16:28 - foreign
16:31 - look we get an example of a python class
16:34 - called customer
16:36 - along with how we can use this class to
16:39 - store a bunch of customer objects inside
16:42 - the list absolutely beautiful
16:44 - now if you're a front-end developer you
16:46 - can ask chat jpt to generate some HTML
16:49 - markup for you and this is where
16:51 - examples get more and more interesting
16:54 - for example we can say write the HTML
16:56 - and CSS code for displaying a card
17:01 - foreign
17:06 - take a look we have the markup here we
17:09 - have a div with the class of card inside
17:12 - the div we have an image then we have
17:14 - the card content inside this div we have
17:17 - the card title and cart description
17:19 - really really good and right below that
17:22 - we have all the CSS we need
17:24 - to display a beautiful card of course we
17:27 - probably need to customize this but
17:29 - again this is a great starting point now
17:32 - we can stop here or we can customize
17:34 - this further for example we can say add
17:37 - a button below the card content
17:41 - foreign
17:46 - look what happened so now we have a new
17:49 - markup right under the card description
17:52 - we have a new div with the class of card
17:54 - action and inside this div we have a
17:57 - button beautiful now we also have more
18:01 - styles for this button we have the plane
18:03 - Styles as well as the styles for the
18:05 - hover effect now let's take this to the
18:08 - next level we can say when I hover my
18:10 - mouse over the card
18:13 - I want the card to slightly slide up
18:22 - so charge if it is suggesting that we
18:24 - should use the hover sudo class and the
18:27 - translate function Translate Y to slide
18:30 - the card up beautiful I love it it's
18:33 - also suggesting an alternative solution
18:35 - using box Shadow so it's pretty up to
18:37 - speed with CSS features now let me show
18:39 - you something really cool we can ask
18:41 - chat GPT to rewrite this code using
18:43 - Tailwind CSS if you're not familiar with
18:46 - Tailwind it's a CSS library that has
18:48 - gained a lot of popularity lately so
18:51 - here we can say can you rewrite this
18:54 - code using Tailwind CSS
18:59 - foreign
19:04 - there you go now we have the same markup
19:07 - but with the utilityclasses that come
19:09 - with Tailwind CSS so we don't have to
19:12 - create CSS classes anymore now here we
19:14 - can get more creative and see what other
19:17 - UI libraries are supported
19:19 - next we can bring some JavaScript to the
19:21 - mix and make this interactive so we can
19:24 - say when I click on the button
19:27 - send an HTTP request to slash API slash
19:30 - products
19:32 - foreign
19:37 - let's look at the generated code so chat
19:40 - GPT is suggesting to use the fetch API
19:43 - that is supported in pretty much most
19:45 - modern browsers but I personally don't
19:47 - like to use the fetch API so I'm going
19:49 - to customize this further and say
19:51 - instead of the fetch API use axis which
19:55 - is a library for sending HTTP requests
19:58 - now take a look
20:04 - all right now we have the instructions
20:06 - for installing axios using npm or yarn
20:10 - as well as a modified example using axis
20:13 - beautiful
20:15 - we can also ask chat GPT to help us with
20:18 - compile time or runtime errors here is
20:20 - an example let's say as part of writing
20:22 - some JavaScript code we got an error
20:24 - saying uncut type error cannot read
20:28 - property let's say bar of undefined
20:31 - anyone who has written a little bit of
20:33 - JavaScript code has probably come across
20:35 - this error so we can copy paste the
20:37 - error message here
20:39 - now chat GPT explains exactly what this
20:42 - error is and how we can potentially
20:44 - solve it
20:49 - so going forward I think a lot of people
20:51 - will start to use chat GPT instead of
20:53 - Google
20:55 - now we can also throw react here and
20:57 - make the example more interesting so we
20:59 - can say create a react component for
21:02 - displaying a card
21:09 - all right let's see what's happening
21:11 - here so up here we have an example of a
21:14 - function component for displaying a card
21:16 - now I personally don't like to have a
21:19 - parameter called props it would be nicer
21:21 - to destructure this parameter and grab
21:24 - individual properties like title
21:26 - description and so on so if you're not
21:28 - familiar with this concept don't worry
21:29 - just continue watching we're not going
21:32 - to do a lot of fancy JavaScript stuff in
21:34 - this video this is just to open your
21:36 - eyes to the possibilities so let's take
21:39 - this to the next level and say this
21:41 - structure the props parameter so the
21:45 - beautiful thing about chat GPT is that
21:47 - it remembers our conversations so let's
21:50 - go ahead
21:53 - foreign
21:57 - we have a new implementation of the card
21:59 - component with the props parameter
22:01 - destructured
22:03 - all right now let's move on and look at
22:05 - a few examples involving back-end
22:07 - development for example we can ask chat
22:09 - jpt to build an API for us with node and
22:12 - express so here we can say I need an API
22:15 - built with
22:17 - express.js to return the list of
22:20 - products
22:21 - each product should have attributes like
22:25 - ID title description price and image URL
22:31 - thank you
22:36 - all right look at this implementation in
22:38 - this implementation we have an area of
22:41 - products stored in memory and we have an
22:43 - API endpoint exposed at this URL I don't
22:47 - want to have an area of products in
22:48 - memory I want this product to be stored
22:51 - in a mongodb database so here we can say
22:54 - modify the code and retrieve the
22:57 - products
22:58 - from a mongodb or a MySQL or a postgres
23:02 - whatever database
23:04 - now we get a new implementation where
23:07 - products are retrieved from a mongodb
23:10 - database using the Mongoose Library
23:13 - here it is
23:17 - now in this implementation the type of
23:19 - these parameters is not clear because
23:21 - this code is just plain JavaScript now
23:24 - we can improve this implementation and
23:25 - use typescript so we can say use
23:28 - typescript in this code
23:37 - now we have a new implementation of the
23:40 - same web server implemented using
23:42 - typescript now let's say you're a python
23:44 - developer you don't want to use
23:46 - JavaScript so here we can say generate
23:49 - this API using Python and fast API which
23:54 - is another library for building apis
23:56 - using python so
24:03 - all right now we have a new
24:04 - implementation but in this
24:05 - implementation our products are stored
24:07 - in memory again we can talk to chat GPT
24:10 - and customize this further
24:13 - all right now let's look at a few
24:14 - examples involving databases this one is
24:16 - pretty interesting so I'm going to say
24:18 - write a SQL query to generate a table
24:22 - called products with four columns note
24:27 - that I'm not specifying the column names
24:29 - and types here I'm just saying I want a
24:31 - product table with four columns see what
24:34 - happens
24:39 - now look chat GPT is smart enough to
24:42 - know that quite often products have
24:44 - attributes like ID title description and
24:47 - price if this is not what you want you
24:50 - can always specify the name and type of
24:52 - each column for example we can say write
24:55 - a SQL query to generate a table called
24:59 - products with these columns now here we
25:03 - press shift and enter so we go to the
25:05 - next line and on each line we can list a
25:07 - column we can say ID of type integer
25:11 - title of type string
25:14 - category of type integer unit price of
25:18 - type float
25:19 - and image URL of type string and you
25:22 - don't necessarily have to put a type in
25:24 - parenthesis you can type a colon and
25:26 - right after that we can specify the type
25:28 - so chat GPT doesn't have a particular
25:30 - syntax you have to follow because it can
25:32 - understand human language
25:39 - all right now in the products table we
25:41 - have columns like ID title category unit
25:44 - price and so on we can also use chat GPT
25:47 - to write queries for retrieving or
25:50 - updating data for example here we can
25:52 - say write a query to retrieve
25:55 - the top five customers in Manhattan note
25:59 - that we don't currently have a table
26:00 - called customers so we're just asking
26:02 - chatgpt to write a query to retrieve the
26:05 - top five customers in Manhattan take a
26:08 - look
26:13 - alright in this example chatgpt has
26:16 - assumed that we have a table called
26:18 - customers with these columns ID name
26:21 - address and City if our customers table
26:23 - has a different schema we need to
26:25 - specify that ahead of time so we specify
26:27 - the name and type of each column then we
26:30 - ask chat GPT to write a query to
26:32 - retrieve the top five customers now look
26:35 - at this query in this query we're simply
26:37 - selecting customers who are located in
26:39 - Manhattan so in this query the customers
26:42 - are sorted by their ID in descending
26:44 - order and the top five are returned this
26:47 - is not what we really want what we want
26:49 - is the top customers who have spent the
26:51 - most so we need to be more specific with
26:53 - our prompt so we need to tell chat CPT
26:56 - to do a join with the orders table to
26:58 - find out how much each customer has
27:00 - spent then it should grab the top 5
27:03 - customers who have spent the most so we
27:06 - can say revise this query and join the
27:10 - customers table
27:12 - with the orders table
27:14 - to find out how much each customer has
27:17 - spent then pick the top five who have
27:22 - spent the most and again here we can
27:25 - specify the schema of the orders table
27:27 - as well
27:28 - so let's go ahead
27:34 - all right look now chat GPT is assuming
27:37 - that we have two tables customers with
27:39 - these columns and orders with these
27:41 - other columns and based on this schema
27:44 - it has revised our query to retrieve the
27:46 - top five customers who have spent the
27:48 - most so that's it guys there are endless
27:51 - ways to get creative and use chat GPT I

Cleaned transcript:

in this tutorial you're going to learn all about what chat GPT is how it works and most importantly how you can use it to boost your productivity as a software developer as a seasoned developer and teacher let me tell you chat GPT is a game changer you don't want to miss out on don't take my word for it just watch this video and see for yourself my name is mosh hamadani and I'm super excited to be bringing you this tutorial on chat GPT I've helped millions of people learn to code and become professional software Engineers through this Channel and my online school codewithmash.com if you are new here make sure to subscribe so you never miss a video so what exactly is chat GPT and how does it work chat jpt is a Cutting Edge AI tool created by open AI it was released in November 2022 and gained 1 million users in just 5 days in comparison it took Netflix three and a half years and Instagram two and a half months to get the same number of users chat gbt is an advanced language model that can understand and generate text you can use it to create content for your website write articles emails tweets cover letters and so on you can also use it to generate code in a number of different programming languages like python JavaScript HTML CSS and much much more you can use it to generate dummy data write unit tests translate text or code from one language to another you can use it to explain code for example if there is a piece of code you don't understand you can ask it and it will explain to you like a patient teacher but I have to be honest sometimes it explains too much chat GPT can also help you learn and remember things faster for example you can give it some text and have it ask you a bunch of questions it can also prepare you for job interviews you can have it improve your resume write a cover letter for you and also interview you like an interviewer now do you think chat GPT is going to take your job let me know in the comments below the reality is whether you like it or not chat GPT is here to stay in this tutorial I'm going to show you how to use it to get more creative and get things done a lot faster I'll be showing you various examples for different programming languages both for beginners and experienced developers but before we dive into that let's take a moment and understand how chat gbt works chat GPT uses a type of artificial intelligence called a language model a language model is a type of software that is designed to understand and generate human language it does this by looking at a large amount of Text data and learning the patterns and rules of a language for example if the language model is trained on a lot of English texts it will learn about the grammar and structure of English as well as the meanings of words and how they are used in different contexts once the language model has learned about a language it can then be used to generate text in that language now chat GPT provides different language models for different purposes gpt3 models which are designed to understand and generate natural language like English and codecs which are specifically trained to understand and generate code these models are trained on billions of lines of code publicly available on GitHub they're mostly capable in Python but they're also pretty good in a bunch of other languages like HTML CSS says JavaScript typescript Ruby SQL and more now before we look at specific examples remember shot GPT like any tool has limitations it might sometimes generate incorrect harmful or biased information so don't take whatever it tells you as a silver bullet don't use it to learn to code because the code that is generated is not guaranteed to be right it might be functional but it might not be the best way to code so in a nutshell chatgpt is a powerful tool that can help you be more creative and efficient but it's not a substitute for human expertise and judgment so that's the theory part now let's move on and see chat GPT in action so head over to chat.openai.com if you don't have an account sign up it takes only a minute once you have logged in you're going to see the main screen with an input box to talk to chat GPT there is also a Chrome extension and a desktop application available if you don't want to use the web interface I'll put the links down below this video alright now let's get to the fun part going forward I'll be showing you various use cases for different programming languages we'll start off with some general purpose questions that apply to anyone regardless of the programming languages and tools they use you will see how you can use chat GPT to learn new things write shell scripts get commands start a business write legal documents and so on once we cover the basics then we'll dive into specific examples for frontend backend and database development I will show you examples using HTML CSS JavaScript typescript python SQL and more now here's my first question what are the top three books for learning Java all right as you can see chat GPT has given us a very comprehensive and detailed answer now here we can ask more detailed questions for example we can ask questions about the first book so we can ask what are the key takeaways from head first Java all right another comprehensive answer you can see that this book teaches you about objectoriented programming Java fundamentals threading and concurrency GUI programming and so on now we can also ask more general questions like how do I become a frontend developer so now chat GPT is saying that to become a frontend developer you need to know the basics of HTML CSS and JavaScript you should practice building websites then you should learn a frontend framework like react angular View and so on you should also know about Version Control Systems like git GitHub and Swap this is pretty much the same answer you will find on every website that gives you a roadmap to become a frontend developer now let's look at more specific examples we can ask chatgpt to write a shell command for us for example we can say write a bash command to find the name of all JPEG files in the directory and write them all to a text file take a look I love this answer so if you're not good with Linux commands you can easily find the final instruction you should use to solve that problem but what is beautiful about chatgpt is that it also explains how this command Works line by line piece by piece we can also have chat GPT red git commands for us for example we can ask how do I know how many lines of code I've committed to a git Repository we can also use chat GPT to get creative for example let's say you want to start a business you can have chat GPT generate app or website names for you for example we can say I want to make a revolutionary online shopping app give me some good app names so chatgpt is suggesting names like shop is Swift cart streamline and so on I think this list is pretty damn good now these are just some example prompt you don't need to use the exact same wording to talk to chat GPT you can ask any questions you want in your own way now if you have used this tool before let us know in the comments below the interesting questions you have asked so we can all learn and Inspire each other we can also ask chat GPT to write contracts for us here's an example I want to hire a graphic designer to design a website we have agreed that they will deliver the first draft in two weeks and offer three iterations free of charge any iteration after will be charged at fifty dollars an hour write a contract for us so the more details we give to chat GPT the better response we'll get all right take a look this is a pretty damn good contract to start with of course you don't want to take this as is and use it in the real world without first passing it by a real lawyer that's why earlier I told you that chat CPT is not a replacement for humans at least none at the moment it's just a way to increase your productivity and get things done in less time now if you're applying for a job there are a number of ways chat GPT can help you for example you can have it write a resume for you hear me can say I have three years of experience coding in HTML CSS and JavaScript write a resume for me of course we can give it more details we can explain our education level our past projects and so on but look at what we get with this simple prompt all right take a look so chat GPT created a basic layout that includes our name address phone number email some objective summary technical skills and it has already listed all the related web Technologies so we have HTML CSS JavaScript jQuery bootstrap we didn't mention any of this but it assumed that we have these skills it also included a section about professional experience including past projects as well as education certifications and so on again it's a great starting point now let's say you're applying for a frontend developer role you can ask chatgpt to write a cover letter for you that you can email to that company so we can say applying for a front and engineer role at some company write a cover letter for me all right take a look we have a comprehensive cover letter beautifully written in perfect English how good is that now let me show you another fun one you can have chat GPT ask you interview questions we can say act as a technical interviewer and ask me five questions about JavaScript take a look all right so here we have five questions that are often asked in technical interviews now let's say you don't know the answer to the first question you can ask a followup question so the beauty of chat GPT is that it remembers everything you have told it in this conversation thread so here we can say what is the answer to the first question again we get a very comprehensive detailed answer you can also ask chat GPT to help you write emails for example we can say write an email to my boss asking for a raise I've worked at this company for two years and successfully delivered several projects on time seriously if I wanted to write this myself it would take me 10 to 15 minutes if not longer I got the answer in just two seconds all right now let's look at a few examples involving code we'll start with using python for writing a command line tool we can say write a python function for generating a random password so as you can see we get a piece of code beautifully highlighted with explanation of how it works now if there's a part of this code that you don't understand you can always ask followup questions for example we can ask what this expression does in this code so we can ask what does 4 in I range of length 2 in this code take a look really really useful couldn't be better now we can also ask computer science questions like what is the time complexity of this function now if you're not familiar with this concept time complexity is a way to explain how large inputs impact the performance of an algorithm it's really beyond the scope of this tutorial I've covered it in detail in my data structures course in case you're interested so let's see what we get so chat GPT is saying that this function's time complexity is linear now let's take this to the next level we can ask chatgpt to write unit tests for this function so write unit tests for this function seriously how good is this if I wanted to write all this unit tests by hand it would take me probably 20 to 30 minutes if not longer of course we should always use our own judgment to make sure that the tests are correct but I think this code is a great starting point and it really saves us a lot of time we can also ask chat GPT for ideas to improve our code for example here on w3schools.com we have this piece of python code where we use a for Loop to iterate over a list of fruits if the fruit has a in it then we add it to a new list I'm going to copy this code and give it to chat GPT to see how we can improve this code so take a look how can I improve this code now here we should hold shift and then press enter so we go to the next line now we paste our code and then press enter to submit the question all right look a lot of details absolutely amazing one thing I love here is that chat apt is suggesting to use a list comprehension which is a oneliner for implementing the same logic of course there are more ways to improve this code we are not going to get into details here we can also ask chat jpt to convert our code from one language to another for example we can say convert this python code to JavaScript foreign just a few seconds our code was converted to JavaScript and down below we have all the details about how this code works we can also use chat CPT to generate dummy data for example we can say generate dummy data for a table called customers each customer should have an ID first name last name and City now in this case chat GPT gave us a python script for generating dummy data but what if we want the actual data not a python script we can say I don't need a python script just give me the data so now we get a list of 10 people represented using the Json format now we can take this to the next level and say create a python class for storing these objects foreign look we get an example of a python class called customer along with how we can use this class to store a bunch of customer objects inside the list absolutely beautiful now if you're a frontend developer you can ask chat jpt to generate some HTML markup for you and this is where examples get more and more interesting for example we can say write the HTML and CSS code for displaying a card foreign take a look we have the markup here we have a div with the class of card inside the div we have an image then we have the card content inside this div we have the card title and cart description really really good and right below that we have all the CSS we need to display a beautiful card of course we probably need to customize this but again this is a great starting point now we can stop here or we can customize this further for example we can say add a button below the card content foreign look what happened so now we have a new markup right under the card description we have a new div with the class of card action and inside this div we have a button beautiful now we also have more styles for this button we have the plane Styles as well as the styles for the hover effect now let's take this to the next level we can say when I hover my mouse over the card I want the card to slightly slide up so charge if it is suggesting that we should use the hover sudo class and the translate function Translate Y to slide the card up beautiful I love it it's also suggesting an alternative solution using box Shadow so it's pretty up to speed with CSS features now let me show you something really cool we can ask chat GPT to rewrite this code using Tailwind CSS if you're not familiar with Tailwind it's a CSS library that has gained a lot of popularity lately so here we can say can you rewrite this code using Tailwind CSS foreign there you go now we have the same markup but with the utilityclasses that come with Tailwind CSS so we don't have to create CSS classes anymore now here we can get more creative and see what other UI libraries are supported next we can bring some JavaScript to the mix and make this interactive so we can say when I click on the button send an HTTP request to slash API slash products foreign let's look at the generated code so chat GPT is suggesting to use the fetch API that is supported in pretty much most modern browsers but I personally don't like to use the fetch API so I'm going to customize this further and say instead of the fetch API use axis which is a library for sending HTTP requests now take a look all right now we have the instructions for installing axios using npm or yarn as well as a modified example using axis beautiful we can also ask chat GPT to help us with compile time or runtime errors here is an example let's say as part of writing some JavaScript code we got an error saying uncut type error cannot read property let's say bar of undefined anyone who has written a little bit of JavaScript code has probably come across this error so we can copy paste the error message here now chat GPT explains exactly what this error is and how we can potentially solve it so going forward I think a lot of people will start to use chat GPT instead of Google now we can also throw react here and make the example more interesting so we can say create a react component for displaying a card all right let's see what's happening here so up here we have an example of a function component for displaying a card now I personally don't like to have a parameter called props it would be nicer to destructure this parameter and grab individual properties like title description and so on so if you're not familiar with this concept don't worry just continue watching we're not going to do a lot of fancy JavaScript stuff in this video this is just to open your eyes to the possibilities so let's take this to the next level and say this structure the props parameter so the beautiful thing about chat GPT is that it remembers our conversations so let's go ahead foreign we have a new implementation of the card component with the props parameter destructured all right now let's move on and look at a few examples involving backend development for example we can ask chat jpt to build an API for us with node and express so here we can say I need an API built with express.js to return the list of products each product should have attributes like ID title description price and image URL thank you all right look at this implementation in this implementation we have an area of products stored in memory and we have an API endpoint exposed at this URL I don't want to have an area of products in memory I want this product to be stored in a mongodb database so here we can say modify the code and retrieve the products from a mongodb or a MySQL or a postgres whatever database now we get a new implementation where products are retrieved from a mongodb database using the Mongoose Library here it is now in this implementation the type of these parameters is not clear because this code is just plain JavaScript now we can improve this implementation and use typescript so we can say use typescript in this code now we have a new implementation of the same web server implemented using typescript now let's say you're a python developer you don't want to use JavaScript so here we can say generate this API using Python and fast API which is another library for building apis using python so all right now we have a new implementation but in this implementation our products are stored in memory again we can talk to chat GPT and customize this further all right now let's look at a few examples involving databases this one is pretty interesting so I'm going to say write a SQL query to generate a table called products with four columns note that I'm not specifying the column names and types here I'm just saying I want a product table with four columns see what happens now look chat GPT is smart enough to know that quite often products have attributes like ID title description and price if this is not what you want you can always specify the name and type of each column for example we can say write a SQL query to generate a table called products with these columns now here we press shift and enter so we go to the next line and on each line we can list a column we can say ID of type integer title of type string category of type integer unit price of type float and image URL of type string and you don't necessarily have to put a type in parenthesis you can type a colon and right after that we can specify the type so chat GPT doesn't have a particular syntax you have to follow because it can understand human language all right now in the products table we have columns like ID title category unit price and so on we can also use chat GPT to write queries for retrieving or updating data for example here we can say write a query to retrieve the top five customers in Manhattan note that we don't currently have a table called customers so we're just asking chatgpt to write a query to retrieve the top five customers in Manhattan take a look alright in this example chatgpt has assumed that we have a table called customers with these columns ID name address and City if our customers table has a different schema we need to specify that ahead of time so we specify the name and type of each column then we ask chat GPT to write a query to retrieve the top five customers now look at this query in this query we're simply selecting customers who are located in Manhattan so in this query the customers are sorted by their ID in descending order and the top five are returned this is not what we really want what we want is the top customers who have spent the most so we need to be more specific with our prompt so we need to tell chat CPT to do a join with the orders table to find out how much each customer has spent then it should grab the top 5 customers who have spent the most so we can say revise this query and join the customers table with the orders table to find out how much each customer has spent then pick the top five who have spent the most and again here we can specify the schema of the orders table as well so let's go ahead all right look now chat GPT is assuming that we have two tables customers with these columns and orders with these other columns and based on this schema it has revised our query to retrieve the top five customers who have spent the most so that's it guys there are endless ways to get creative and use chat GPT I hope you found this video helpful if you enjoyed it please give it a like And subscribe for more videos like this also let me know in the comment section what interesting questions you have asked chat GPT I would love to hear from you so thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video
