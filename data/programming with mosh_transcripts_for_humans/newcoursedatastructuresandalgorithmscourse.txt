00:00 - hey guys wash here I'm super excited to
00:02 - announce that I just launched a new
00:04 - course called data structures and
00:06 - algorithms this is actually the first
00:08 - part of a series of courses on the topic
00:10 - in the first part we talked about all
00:12 - the linear data structures that every
00:14 - software developer must know you talked
00:16 - about arrays link lists stacks queues
00:20 - and hash tables the second part is about
00:22 - nonlinear data structures such as graphs
00:25 - and trees I'm still working on that and
00:27 - we'll send out another announcement when
00:29 - it's ready had tons of requests for this
00:31 - course because data structures is one of
00:33 - the topics that comes up in job
00:35 - interviews quite a lot especially if
00:37 - you're looking for a job at big
00:39 - companies like Microsoft Google and
00:41 - Amazon these companies always ask you
00:44 - questions about data structures and
00:46 - algorithms to see if you can think like
00:48 - a programmer they don't care how many
00:50 - programming languages or frameworks
00:52 - you're familiar with if you can build a
00:54 - website or an app but cannot solve a
00:56 - basic computer science problem you're
00:57 - gonna fail and that's exactly why I
01:00 - created this course for you to help your
01:02 - master is very important topic every
01:05 - single exercise an example you see in
01:06 - this course is a popular interview
01:09 - question I'm super excited about this
01:11 - course and I wish when I was learning
01:12 - this topic back at school we had a
01:15 - course like this because most data
01:16 - structure books and courses out there
01:18 - are super boring and dry plus the code
01:22 - you see in this books look disgusting
01:23 - you see a lot of mysterious variables
01:25 - like n K a and B and you have no idea
01:29 - how these algorithms work in this course
01:32 - not only will you learn everything about
01:33 - data structures on algorithms but you
01:35 - will also learn how to implement these
01:37 - algorithms with beautiful code the kind
01:40 - of code that can be read like your story
01:42 - you will see how I start with a simple
01:44 - solution then refactor my code and make
01:46 - it better and more expressive this
01:49 - course is a must for any computer
01:50 - science students whose lecture failed to
01:53 - explain these topics as well as people
01:55 - who want to get a software development
01:56 - job at a good company or I would say
01:59 - anyone who simply wants to become a
02:01 - better developer because these
02:03 - algorithms we have covered in this
02:04 - course train your programming brain they
02:07 - change how you think about programming
02:09 - so if you're interested in this course
02:11 - you can get it at my coding school code
02:13 - Marche comm this course just got
02:15 - launched and the first 200 students can
02:18 - get it with a discount if you're
02:19 - interested click the link below this
02:21 - video thank you and have a fantastic day
