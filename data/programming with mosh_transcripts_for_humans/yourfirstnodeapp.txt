00:01 - alright then we're ready to build our
00:03 - first node application so I'm gonna
00:05 - create a new folder call it first app
00:10 - let's go to this folder now I'm going to
00:15 - open this folder inside of Visual Studio
00:17 - code which is my preferred code editor
00:20 - so code period so this is Visual Studio
00:26 - code or vs code it's a free powerful
00:29 - editor but you can use any editors that
00:31 - you prefer you can use sublime you can
00:33 - use atom or any other editors so here in
00:37 - this folder I'm gonna add in your file
00:39 - app is in this file we can write regular
00:44 - JavaScript just like the JavaScript that
00:46 - we write for the browsers so I'm gonna
00:49 - define a function say hello
00:52 - that takes a parameter name and simply
00:56 - logs a message on the console so hello
01:00 - + name and then we can call this
01:03 - function like this Marsh now to execute
01:08 - this code we're going to go back to the
01:11 - terminal and run node and pass the name
01:14 - of the file as an argument so app the
01:17 - jas so node as I told you before is a
01:20 - C++ program it includes Chrome's
01:23 - v8 JavaScript engine so this app the J's
01:26 - file that we're gonna pass to node node
01:29 - is gonna give it to v8 for execution so
01:32 - you can see we got hello Marsh on the
01:34 - console now let me show you something so
01:36 - back in vs code
01:39 - I'm going to temporarily comment out
01:40 - this line and do it console that log of
01:44 - window let's see what happens so back in
01:48 - the terminal let's run node app ajs you
01:53 - got an exception window is not defined
01:56 - so as I told you before a node we don't
01:59 - have the window or document objects
02:02 - these are part of the runtime
02:03 - environment that we get with browsers in
02:06 - node we have other objects to work with
02:09 - files with the operating system with the
02:11 - network and so on and that's what you're
02:13 - gonna learn about in the next section I
02:15 - hope you enjoyed this section and thank
02:17 - you for watching hi guys it's mush here
