00:06 - descriptions unit testing is a type of
00:09 - automated testing where we write code to
00:11 - test a small unit of our application
00:14 - that small unit can be a function a
00:16 - module or a component we have other
00:18 - types of automated tests like
00:20 - integration tests where we test multiple
00:22 - units together and end2end tests where
00:25 - we test our entire application like a
00:27 - real user but in an automated fashion
00:30 - so with automated testing our code base
00:33 - consists of two types of code the
00:35 - application code also called the
00:37 - production code as well as the test code
00:39 - or simply tests with these tests in
00:42 - place every time we make changes to our
00:44 - application or before we are ready to
00:46 - deploy it we can run hundreds or
00:48 - thousands of tests in seconds or a few
00:51 - minutes to find out if all the features
00:53 - are working as expected this is much
00:55 - faster than manually testing every
00:57 - feature every time you update our code
00:59 - or or we are ready to ship our software
01:02 - plus it helps us catch bugs early change
01:05 - or refactor our code with confidence and
01:07 - honestly sleep better at night because
01:10 - knowing our application is well tested
01:12 - brings a whole new level of peace of
01:14 - mind that's why big tech companies like
01:16 - Google Amazon meta and many other
01:19 - companies that ship Rock Solid
01:21 - applications rely heavily on automated
01:24 - testing and that's why they pay big
01:26 - bucks for developers who know automated
01:29 - testing so so if you want to stand out
01:30 - from an average developer and land a
01:33 - better job you must learn this critical
