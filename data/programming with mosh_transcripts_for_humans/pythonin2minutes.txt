00:00 - python is the most popular programming
00:02 - language in the world because of its
00:03 - simple and beginner friendly syntax and
00:06 - that's the number one reason it's hated
00:08 - by C++ programmers it's the language of
00:11 - choice for artificial intelligence and
00:13 - machine learning but also heavily used
00:15 - in scripting Automation and backend
00:17 - development it has a huge ecosystem of
00:19 - thirdparty libraries such as numpy for
00:22 - numerical Computing pandas for data
00:24 - analysis psychic learn for machine
00:26 - learning tensor flow for deep learning
00:29 - Jango for build building web
00:30 - applications and kyv for crossplatform
00:32 - desktop and mobile apps in case you care
00:35 - python is 33 years old it was created by
00:38 - Dutch programmer in 1991 and named after
00:41 - the British comedy Monty Python python
00:44 - is an interpreted language meaning you
00:46 - can run your code without the
00:47 - compilation step but you need an
00:49 - interpreter that's written in C for
00:51 - performance unlike other languages
00:53 - python has hidden gems we can import
00:55 - this for the Zen of python or
00:58 - anti-gravity for a fun surprise we can
01:01 - declare a variable with a name and a
01:03 - value that can be a string a Boolean or
01:05 - a number python is a dynamically type
01:08 - language meaning the type of variables
01:10 - is determined at runtime unlike other
01:12 - languages in Python we can add or even
01:15 - multiply strings and numbers python has
01:17 - four types of collections lists topples
01:20 - sets and dictionaries now unlike many
01:23 - languages we can use a negative index to
01:25 - count backwards to define a function we
01:28 - use the def keyword and in the ation to
01:30 - declare a block of code so no curly
01:32 - braces and that's another reason python
01:35 - is hated by C++ programmers python also
01:38 - supports objectoriented programming we
01:40 - can Define classes using the class
01:41 - keyword and have them inherit from each
01:43 - other python comes with batteries
01:45 - included a huge library of built-in
01:47 - modules for tasks like working with CSV
01:50 - Json emails web scraping and so on and
01:54 - that was python in 2 minutes Want To
01:55 - Learn Python check out my tutorials
