00:00 - hi they want to learn how to code then
00:02 - you have come to the right place my name
00:04 - is muhammad ani i have talked over three
00:06 - million people how to code or how to
00:08 - become a professional software engineer
00:10 - in this video I'm gonna go over what you
00:13 - need to get started what programming
00:15 - languages to learn where to learn these
00:17 - languages how long it's going to get job
00:20 - ready along with a few tips for your
00:22 - first interviews now this video is for
00:25 - beginners who want to learn how to code
00:27 - if you're an intermediate programmer
00:28 - this video is probably not for you now
00:31 - before we begin I would like to tell you
00:33 - about a common misconception about
00:35 - programmers that there are all genius
00:37 - level eggheads with superhuman math
00:39 - skills and four-digit IQs that is not
00:42 - true you don't need to be a math genius
00:44 - what you need are focus and
00:46 - determination if you're going to be a
00:48 - coder you should be able to focus
00:50 - programming is all about problem solving
00:52 - and solving problems takes time
00:55 - sometimes you might be working on a
00:57 - single piece of code for hours or even
00:59 - days if you check your Twitter or watch
01:01 - cat videos every 20 minutes you're not
01:03 - gonna be able to focus as a coder you'll
01:06 - be spending hours and hours in front of
01:08 - a computer screen looking at code like
01:10 - this and it's important to ask yourself
01:12 - is this something you like I know it's
01:15 - not for everyone but some people like me
01:17 - love to code if you want to become an
01:19 - awesome coder you need to fall in love
01:21 - with code the second characteristic
01:24 - you'll need is curiosity and passion for
01:27 - learning because software and coding
01:29 - languages are constantly being updated
01:30 - and improved you will have to learn new
01:32 - things all the time
01:34 - it never stops so you should read your
01:36 - articles books or watch online courses
01:38 - every now and then to get up to speed
01:40 - with what's happening in the industry
01:43 - what about education well a decade ago
01:46 - having a degree in computer science was
01:49 - the only way to get into the programming
01:50 - industry but these days the barrier of
01:53 - entry is much lower for many companies
01:55 - is your level of proven technical skill
01:58 - that would get you the job not your
01:59 - degree I personally was never asked
02:02 - about my degree in any of my interviews
02:04 - what mattered is that I could do the
02:06 - work so what if some people like to go
02:08 - to a university I personally think it's
02:11 - a waste of time and money even though I
02:13 - master's degree myself most university
02:15 - programs for software engineering take
02:17 - three to four years cost tens of
02:19 - thousands of dollars and tend to waste a
02:21 - lot of time teaching outdated or
02:23 - irrelevant subjects like physics or
02:25 - biology furthermore in my experience
02:28 - you're more likely to be taught by PhD
02:30 - student looking to make some pocket
02:32 - change as opposed to someone with real
02:34 - industry experience as a result a lot of
02:37 - students spent four years in a
02:38 - university graduate with $30,000 in
02:41 - student loan debt and realized that they
02:43 - can't even build a simple application if
02:46 - you disagree that's perfectly fine
02:48 - universities can be a good place to make
02:50 - connections and become well-rounded but
02:52 - if you want to learn to code well enough
02:54 - to get a job you'll have to learn that
02:56 - skill on your own University is not
02:58 - going to teach you that I promise so how
03:01 - to learn the good news is that there are
03:03 - a ton of books and online courses out
03:05 - there and any number of subjects the
03:07 - coding community is very large and very
03:09 - supportive so if you're looking to get
03:11 - into coding there is a whole world of
03:13 - educational resources at your fingertips
03:15 - so you can decide what do you want to
03:17 - learn and pursue that you won't need to
03:19 - waste time studying irrelevant subjects
03:21 - and paying for them now what programming
03:23 - languages should you start with this is
03:26 - pretty subjective and it depends who you
03:28 - ask
03:28 - and what you want to build a lot of
03:30 - people tell beginners to learn HTML and
03:32 - CSS but these are really not programming
03:34 - languages they're markup languages that
03:36 - we use to describe what a website or
03:39 - mobile app looks like so if you want to
03:41 - become a programmer you really need to
03:43 - learn a programming language that you
03:44 - can use to define how an app works
03:47 - we have several programming languages
03:49 - out there such as JavaScript C++ c-sharp
03:52 - Java Python Ruby PHP and so on each
03:56 - language has its own pros and cons for
03:59 - example if you're gonna build something
04:01 - where performance is a critical factor
04:03 - it would probably want to use C++ but on
04:06 - the flip side that comes with a cost of
04:08 - maintenance because C++ is a complex
04:10 - language if you want to build an iPhone
04:12 - app you will have to learn Swift and you
04:14 - also need a Mac computer for Android
04:16 - you'll have to learn Java or Catlin my
04:19 - recommendation to you is not to get hung
04:21 - up and these differences between
04:22 - programming languages once you learn a
04:24 - language you can always learn in
04:26 - other programming language much faster
04:28 - because all these languages have pretty
04:30 - much the same foundation so out of all
04:32 - these languages I recommend you to learn
04:34 - Python because first of all it's the
04:37 - most beginner for any language so you
04:39 - can easily learn the fundamentals of
04:40 - programming it's versatile so you can
04:43 - use it for a wide range of jobs such as
04:45 - web or mobile development as well as
04:47 - data science or hacking so you will have
04:49 - more job opportunities compared to let's
04:52 - say C++ it's cross-platform so you don't
04:55 - need a Mac computer you can read it on
04:57 - Windows Mac or Linux and on average
05:00 - Python developers earn more according to
05:03 - indeed.com the average salary of a
05:05 - Python developer is hundred and sixteen
05:08 - thousand dollars a year but of course
05:10 - that requires having additional skills
05:12 - so it's not like we read one Python book
05:14 - and done $160,000 a year no it doesn't
05:17 - work like that but learning Python opens
05:19 - up so many opportunities for you so for
05:22 - now I would recommend focusing only on
05:23 - Python one of the common issues I see
05:26 - amongst beginners is that they try to
05:28 - learn so many languages all at once they
05:31 - learn a bit of Python but then they hear
05:33 - that javascript is pretty hot so they
05:35 - leave Python and start learning
05:36 - JavaScript then someone else tells them
05:39 - about PHP so they learn PHP too it's not
05:42 - gonna work
05:43 - it's like trying to learn multiple
05:44 - musical instruments at the same time
05:46 - this way you won't be able to play one
05:48 - song on any of these instruments learn
05:51 - an instrument first make sure you can
05:53 - play a few songs then learn a second
05:55 - instrument by the same token learn
05:57 - Python first make sure you know the
05:59 - fundamentals of programming well build a
06:01 - few applications here and there and then
06:03 - learn a second language so your first
06:06 - step is learning Python
06:07 - once you learn Python well then you can
06:09 - focus on a specific area such as web
06:12 - apps mobile apps data science machine
06:14 - learning and AI which is going to be
06:16 - pretty big the good thing about Python
06:19 - is that it's a general-purpose
06:20 - programming language so you can use it
06:22 - for a wide range of jobs in contrast if
06:25 - you learn Swift
06:25 - all you can do is build iOS apps that's
06:28 - it nothing more Python gives you more
06:30 - job options and by the way you can
06:33 - always learn about other areas for
06:34 - example you may want to spend the first
06:37 - two years on web development and then
06:39 - you've discovered that you would like to
06:40 - or mobile development it's perfectly
06:42 - fine as long as you know the
06:43 - fundamentals well you can easily
06:45 - transition to a different area how to
06:47 - learn Python well I have a number of
06:50 - Python tutorials for you here on my
06:52 - channel my Python tutorial for beginners
06:54 - is a great introduction to Python and
06:56 - teaches you the basics of programming so
06:58 - I highly recommend you to watch that
07:00 - video to the end the fun thing about
07:02 - learning coding is that you're
07:03 - constantly doing you spend 30 percent of
07:06 - your time studying and the rest on
07:08 - practicing so it's not like sitting down
07:10 - for three hours studying and memorizing
07:12 - something boring like history your
07:14 - problem solving you're thinking of
07:16 - different solutions you play with your
07:18 - code and see the result it's not working
07:20 - ok try something different it's very
07:23 - practical how much time do you need to
07:26 - spend on this it really depends but if
07:28 - you can dedicate two hours of coding on
07:30 - average every day after 2 to 3 months
07:33 - you should be fairly comfortable writing
07:35 - basic programs after that you will need
07:37 - another three to six months to
07:39 - specialize in one area such as web
07:41 - development mobile development or data
07:43 - science so in total I would say you need
07:45 - to dedicate 6 to 12 months of your time
07:47 - and studying and practicing programming
07:50 - to become job ready at that point you
07:52 - can land your first job as a junior
07:54 - software developer with an average
07:56 - salary of 60 to 70 thousand dollars then
07:59 - as you gain more experience in the
08:00 - industry your resume will start to get
08:02 - more attractive and you can easily ask
08:04 - for a hundred 120 thousand dollars a
08:07 - year if not more so are you excited to
08:09 - learn programming if you are I would
08:11 - encourage you to start by making a
08:13 - commitment to spend two hours every day
08:15 - studying and practicing coding and use
08:18 - the comment box below to let me and
08:20 - everyone else know why you want to learn
08:22 - programming I would love to hear your
08:23 - story now
08:25 - before you apply for your first job your
08:26 - resume is empty you don't have any work
08:29 - history and that's okay don't panic a
08:31 - lot of people freak out because they
08:32 - don't have any work experience to show
08:34 - and yes it is important to some
08:36 - companies but not every company there
08:38 - are a lot of companies that hire junior
08:40 - programmers and teach them because it
08:42 - costs them less than getting a senior
08:44 - developer so in a job interview they
08:46 - want to know if you're dedicated and a
08:48 - fast learner
08:49 - there is nothing wrong with being asked
08:51 - a question and saying you don't know the
08:53 - answer just say that you're a fast
08:54 - learner and you really want to get this
08:56 - job because you love programming and you
08:58 - want to grow show them that you're
09:00 - passionate about working with them this
09:02 - will help you stand out and hopefully
09:03 - get the job that you want also it's
09:06 - really helpful if you work on some hobby
09:08 - projects as you're learning think of the
09:10 - websites and apps you use often try to
09:13 - build a simpler version of this and put
09:15 - that on your resume you can upload your
09:17 - code to github.com
09:18 - and include the link on your resume so
09:21 - that's it for today
09:22 - I hope this video helped you map out
09:24 - where you are and where you should go
09:26 - next if you enjoyed this video please
09:27 - show some love by liking and sharing it

Cleaned transcript:

hi they want to learn how to code then you have come to the right place my name is muhammad ani i have talked over three million people how to code or how to become a professional software engineer in this video I'm gonna go over what you need to get started what programming languages to learn where to learn these languages how long it's going to get job ready along with a few tips for your first interviews now this video is for beginners who want to learn how to code if you're an intermediate programmer this video is probably not for you now before we begin I would like to tell you about a common misconception about programmers that there are all genius level eggheads with superhuman math skills and fourdigit IQs that is not true you don't need to be a math genius what you need are
