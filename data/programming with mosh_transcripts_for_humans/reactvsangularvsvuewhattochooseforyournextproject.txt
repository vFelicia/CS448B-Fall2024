With timestamps:

00:00 - are you confused whether you should use
00:02 - angular react or view for your next
00:04 - project let me help you out in this
00:06 - short video I'm gonna quickly compare
00:08 - these three tools we're gonna look at
00:10 - their history their learning curve their
00:12 - stability their ecosystem and then I'm
00:15 - gonna tell you which JavaScript
00:16 - framework to use for your next project
00:18 - first let me get the terminology clear
00:21 - what is the difference between a library
00:23 - and a framework some developers use
00:25 - these terms interchangeably but they're
00:27 - actually different a library is a
00:29 - collection of reusable code that is used
00:31 - to solve common problems there are
00:33 - various libraries out there for solving
00:35 - different types of problems for example
00:37 - we have libraries for performing
00:39 - mathematical calculations we have
00:41 - libraries for machine learning and so on
00:43 - react is a library for building
00:45 - interactive user interfaces if framework
00:49 - on the other hand gives us a lot of
00:51 - reusable code just like a library but it
00:53 - also provides a structure or a skeleton
00:55 - for building applications so when using
00:58 - a framework we have to build our
00:59 - application according to that framework
01:01 - frameworks have opinions in terms of how
01:04 - we should structure our application how
01:06 - the application should get started how
01:08 - various components should interact with
01:10 - each other and so on angular and view
01:13 - are both examples of popular frameworks
01:15 - for building front-end applications now
01:18 - one of the questions I get a lot is mush
01:20 - why do we have to use a framework or a
01:23 - library to build an application can we
01:25 - just use plain old JavaScript the answer
01:28 - is yes you certainly can I so waste of
01:30 - time
01:31 - here is the reason imagine you want to
01:33 - build a desk
01:34 - would you buy pieces of wood and put
01:36 - them together or would you go to the
01:38 - forest and cut the trees first there is
01:40 - no reason to cut the trees when there
01:42 - are already pieces of wood ready for us
01:44 - to reuse we use frameworks and libraries
01:47 - to increase our productivity and speed
01:49 - up the development process there is a
01:51 - lot of code that is tested and is ready
01:54 - for us to reuse so this is all about
01:56 - libraries and frameworks now react
01:59 - angular and view are the top three tools
02:01 - for building applications these days but
02:04 - which one is better let's find out look
02:07 - at the results of this deck overflow
02:08 - developer server in 2019 that just came
02:11 - out here's the list of the most
02:13 - web frameworks and the winner is react
02:16 - it is closely followed by view this year
02:19 - and angular seems to be losing its
02:21 - popularity compared to previous years if
02:24 - you look at Google Trends you can see
02:26 - that react is the most popular library
02:28 - out of the three now let's have a quick
02:30 - look at the history of these frameworks
02:32 - angular is the oldest of the three it's
02:35 - developed by Google and was initially
02:37 - released in 2010
02:39 - until 2016 it used to be called
02:41 - angularjs in 2016
02:44 - angular team released angular 2 which
02:46 - was a complete rewrite of angularjs in
02:49 - fact it had nothing in common with the
02:51 - previous version of angular it was a
02:53 - completely new framework so to reduce
02:55 - confusion angular team decided to drop
02:58 - the jas from the original name and they
03:01 - call the new framework angular this made
03:03 - a lot of developers unhappy any
03:05 - applications that were built with
03:07 - angularjs had to be rebuilt with angular
03:10 - also over the last three years there
03:12 - have been several releases of angular
03:14 - and we have experienced several breaking
03:16 - changes as an online instructor this
03:19 - made me very unhappy because my angular
03:21 - course got outdated pretty quickly and I
03:24 - had to do a lot of patches to the course
03:25 - and at some point I ended up recreating
03:27 - the entire course from scratch but it
03:29 - came soon after the course got out data
03:32 - react is developed and maintained by
03:35 - Facebook and it's been around since 2013
03:37 - currently it's at version 16 and it's
03:40 - being used by Facebook Twitter Netflix
03:43 - PayPal and uber to name a few it has a
03:46 - huge community which means somebody out
03:48 - there has already solved the problems
03:50 - you may encounter so there are tons of
03:52 - third-party libraries packages tools
03:55 - extensions as well as tutorials and
03:57 - courses view or view Jas is the youngest
04:01 - kid in town unlike angular and react
04:03 - view isn't developed by a big
04:05 - corporation it was originally developed
04:07 - by an ex-googler employee in 2014 and
04:09 - now it's maintained by a group of
04:11 - passionate developers even though it's a
04:13 - new framework it has gained a lot of
04:15 - popularity over the past two years now
04:18 - what about the learning curve the
04:20 - framework or library you choose should
04:22 - be relatively easy to learn
04:24 - so other members in your team can
04:25 - quickly
04:26 - up-to-speed angular has always been
04:28 - famous for having a steep learning curve
04:30 - because it's a full-blown framework or a
04:33 - complete solution there is so many
04:34 - concepts you need to learn such as
04:36 - directives modules decorators components
04:40 - services dependency injection pipes and
04:42 - templates after that there are more
04:44 - advanced topics such as change detection
04:46 - zones ahead of time compilation and rxjs
04:49 - the entry barrier for angular is clearly
04:52 - higher than for react there are so many
04:55 - things you need to learn in contrast
04:57 - react is just a library and not a
04:59 - complete solution so it has fewer
05:01 - concepts that you need to learn and
05:02 - understand react uses JavaScript XML or
05:05 - JSON HTML within JavaScript code so to
05:10 - get started you need to learn the JSX
05:12 - syntax as well as how to read components
05:15 - manage internal state and use props for
05:18 - configuration you don't need to learn a
05:19 - lot of new concepts since all of this is
05:22 - just plain JavaScript once you have
05:24 - learned the basics then you can learn
05:25 - about a routing and estate management
05:27 - library for building complex enterprise
05:30 - applications so the entry barrier for
05:32 - react is a lot lower than for angular
05:34 - and that's one of the reasons I love
05:36 - react if you know JavaScript well you
05:38 - can get started with react pretty
05:40 - quickly
05:40 - now if you wanna improve your JavaScript
05:42 - skills I have a tutorial here on my
05:44 - channel called JavaScript for react
05:46 - developers it quickly walks you through
05:48 - the essential JavaScript features that
05:50 - you need to know to build react
05:52 - applications I also have a couple of
05:54 - comprehensive courses on my website
05:55 - JavaScript basics for beginners and
05:58 - object-oriented programming in
05:59 - JavaScript so totally you have 12 hours
06:02 - of in-depth JavaScript training in front
06:04 - of you for a very reasonable price if
06:06 - you're interested the link is below this
06:08 - video now let's talk about view I would
06:11 - say learning view requires roughly the
06:13 - same amount of time and effort it's
06:15 - definitely easier to learn than angular
06:16 - some argue that is even easier than
06:18 - react but that's very subjective another
06:21 - thing to consider when choosing a
06:22 - framework or library for your next
06:24 - project is talent availability you want
06:27 - to make sure that you can easily find
06:29 - new resources to join your team with
06:31 - reacting the most popular front and
06:33 - library you'll have a better chance at
06:35 - finding react developers to
06:37 - I would say angular comes next and view
06:40 - comes last since it's still a new
06:42 - framework the other factor you need to
06:44 - consider is the stability of a framework
06:46 - you want to make sure that the framework
06:48 - or library you choose introduces minimal
06:51 - risks your development process the
06:52 - angular team have planned major updates
06:55 - every six months during this major
06:57 - upgrades you will experience breaking
06:59 - changes and you have another six months
07:01 - to make the necessary changes before the
07:04 - old api's are deprecated so that gives
07:06 - you a total of two releases or one year
07:09 - to make the necessary changes we'd react
07:11 - you have to worry less about this
07:13 - because Facebook takes the stability of
07:15 - react seriously big companies like
07:17 - Twitter and Airbnb use react and that's
07:19 - one of the reasons Facebook is reluctant
07:21 - to make any big changes that could
07:23 - impact these companies as per view 90%
07:27 - of the api's are the same if you're
07:28 - migrating from version 1 to 2 they also
07:31 - have a migration helper tool that makes
07:33 - it easier to migrate your applications
07:35 - now let's take a look at the open source
07:37 - community involvement in all these three
07:39 - frameworks something interesting to note
07:41 - here is that view has the most number of
07:43 - stars among the three on github but it
07:46 - also has the least number of
07:47 - contributors what it tells me is that
07:49 - people are interested in view but it
07:51 - hasn't gained the momentum that react
07:53 - and angular have gained in the open
07:55 - source community react has around 126
07:59 - thousand stars which is a lot for an
08:00 - open source library this shows that
08:02 - people love react in contrast angular
08:05 - has only about 40,000 stars
08:07 - react also has a significant number of
08:09 - contributors there are over 1,200
08:11 - developers contributing to react which
08:13 - is way more than view and angular now
08:16 - look at the weekly downloads react has
08:18 - the most number of weekly downloads with
08:20 - a whopping 5.2 million view comes second
08:23 - with 980,000 weekly downloads I was
08:26 - surprised to say that angular downloads
08:28 - have dropped significantly so based on
08:30 - the community and growth of frameworks
08:32 - react is at the very top view is liked
08:35 - by the community and upcoming angular on
08:37 - the other hand seems to be losing its
08:39 - spark and slowing down and the last
08:41 - thing I want to consider when choosing a
08:42 - framework is its size now I personally
08:45 - don't like to debate much on this
08:46 - because all these frameworks and
08:48 - libraries are constantly getting
08:49 - optimized but if
08:51 - curious you can see that angular is
08:52 - fairly large compared to react and view
08:55 - this is because angular is a full-blown
08:57 - framework it has everything you need
08:59 - from routing templates testing utilities
09:01 - and so on and that's the reason the
09:03 - framework size is big and not suitable
09:05 - for light weight applications react on
09:07 - the other hand is a library and not a
09:09 - framework this means you don't get much
09:11 - out of the box and you have to use other
09:12 - libraries for routing and state
09:14 - management
09:15 - this makes react small and lightweight
09:17 - so maybe you're building a small
09:19 - application that doesn't need routing
09:21 - then you don't need to bring in a
09:22 - rafting library or if you really need it
09:25 - you can always choose your preferred
09:26 - routing library you're not locked - what
09:29 - a framework gives you view is even
09:31 - smaller and also suitable for light
09:33 - weight applications if you're looking
09:35 - for an extremely lightweight option then
09:37 - pre-act
09:37 - is smaller than view and it's basically
09:39 - react with some features stripped out
09:42 - sell it to recap based on all these
09:44 - factors that we discussed in this video
09:46 - I would recommend you to use react to
09:48 - your next project because first and
09:50 - foremost it's a stable library and
09:52 - introduces minimal risk to your projects
09:54 - it's easy to learn it has a huge
09:57 - community which means it's easier for
09:58 - you to find developers who know react
10:00 - and there are tons of third-party tools
10:02 - packages and libraries for you to use if
10:05 - you want to learn react from scratch I
10:07 - have a comprehensive to our tutorial
10:09 - here on my channel you can see it over
10:11 - here I've also put the link down below
10:13 - this tutorial walks you through all the
10:16 - core concepts and react even though I
10:18 - made it last year in 2018 it's still
10:20 - valid and up to date because react is a
10:22 - stable library and you won't encounter
10:25 - breaking changes Facebook takes the
10:27 - stability of react seriously so watch
10:30 - this tutorial first but if you want to
10:31 - master react I have a complete course
10:34 - for you that is 12 hours long it goes
10:36 - far beyond my youtube tutorial and
10:38 - touches on concepts such as building
10:40 - complex user interfaces routing and
10:42 - navigation calling back and api's
10:45 - authentication and authorization
10:47 - handling and login errors and deployment
10:50 - pretty much all the concepts involved in
10:52 - building real applications in this
10:54 - course you will learn how to build a
10:56 - real video rental application with a
10:58 - node back-end this is an online video
11:00 - course just like my youtube tutorial and
11:02 - you can watch it anytime any
11:04 - as many times as you want you will also
11:06 - receive a certificate of completion at
11:08 - the end that you can add to your resume
11:10 - we even offer a 30-day money-back
11:12 - guarantee if you're interested use the

Cleaned transcript:

are you confused whether you should use angular react or view for your next project let me help you out in this short video I'm gonna quickly compare these three tools we're gonna look at their history their learning curve their stability their ecosystem and then I'm gonna tell you which JavaScript framework to use for your next project first let me get the terminology clear what is the difference between a library and a framework some developers use these terms interchangeably but they're actually different a library is a collection of reusable code that is used to solve common problems there are various libraries out there for solving different types of problems for example we have libraries for performing mathematical calculations we have libraries for machine learning and so on react is a library for building interactive user interfaces if framework on the other hand gives us a lot of reusable code just like a library but it also provides a structure or a skeleton for building applications so when using a framework we have to build our application according to that framework frameworks have opinions in terms of how we should structure our application how the application should get started how various components should interact with each other and so on angular and view are both examples of popular frameworks for building frontend applications now one of the questions I get a lot is mush why do we have to use a framework or a library to build an application can we just use plain old JavaScript the answer is yes you certainly can I so waste of time here is the reason imagine you want to build a desk would you buy pieces of wood and put them together or would you go to the forest and cut the trees first there is no reason to cut the trees when there are already pieces of wood ready for us to reuse we use frameworks and libraries to increase our productivity and speed up the development process there is a lot of code that is tested and is ready for us to reuse so this is all about libraries and frameworks now react angular and view are the top three tools for building applications these days but which one is better let's find out look at the results of this deck overflow developer server in 2019 that just came out here's the list of the most web frameworks and the winner is react it is closely followed by view this year and angular

1,200 developers contributing to react which is way more than view and angular now look at the weekly downloads react has the most number of weekly downloads with a whopping 5.2 million view comes
