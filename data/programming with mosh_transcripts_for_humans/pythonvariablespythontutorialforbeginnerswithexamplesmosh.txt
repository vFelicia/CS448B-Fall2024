00:03 - let's start this section by a discussion
00:05 - of variables which are one of the core
00:07 - concepts in programming we use variables
00:10 - to store data in computer's memory here
00:13 - are a few examples I'm going to define a
00:15 - variable called students under line
00:18 - count and setting it to a thousand when
00:22 - we run this program python interpreter
00:24 - will allocate some memory and store this
00:27 - number thousand in that memory space
00:29 - then it will have this variable
00:32 - reference that memory location so this
00:36 - variable is just like a label for that
00:38 - memory location we can use this variable
00:40 - or this label anywhere in our program to
00:43 - get access to that memory location and
00:45 - the data is stored there so now if we
00:48 - print students count and run our program
00:53 - we will get the number of thousand so
00:57 - this is the basic of variables now what
01:00 - kind of data can be a store in
01:01 - computer's memory well we have several
01:04 - different kinds of data in this section
01:06 - we're going to look at the built-in
01:08 - primitive types in Python primitive
01:11 - types can be numbers boolean and strings
01:15 - let me show you so here we have a whole
01:18 - number we refer to this as an integer in
01:21 - programming we can also have numbers
01:23 - with a decimal point let's take a look
01:25 - so rating we set this to four point nine
01:29 - nine this is what we call a float or a
01:32 - floating-point number and this
01:34 - terminology is not specific to Python in
01:36 - the future when you learn a new
01:38 - programming language you're going to
01:40 - hear these terms again now let's take a
01:42 - look at an example of a boolean is
01:45 - published we set this to true or false
01:51 - these are examples of boolean values in
01:54 - programming so boolean values can either
01:56 - be true or false and these are exactly
02:00 - like yes and no in English later in the
02:02 - course you will learn that will use
02:04 - these boolean values to make decisions
02:06 - in our programs for example if the user
02:09 - is an admin user perhaps we want to give
02:12 - them extra
02:13 - permissions so these are the boolean
02:15 - values now take into account that Python
02:18 - is a case sensitive language which means
02:21 - lower case and upper case characters
02:23 - have different meanings so boolean
02:25 - values should always start with a
02:28 - capital letter like what you see here if
02:30 - we type false or false these are not
02:34 - accepted boolean values in Python only
02:36 - what you see here is a valid boolean
02:38 - value so false or true and finally let's
02:42 - take a look at an example of a string so
02:45 - course under line name we set this to
02:48 - your string like Python programming so
02:51 - string as I told you before is like text
02:54 - whenever you want to work with text in
02:56 - your programs you need to surround your
02:58 - text with quotes so these are the basics
03:01 - of variables
03:09 - so these are the variables from the last
03:11 - lecture now I've got a question for you
03:14 - there are four things that have
03:15 - consistently used in this program can
03:18 - you spot them if you want you can pause
03:20 - the video think about this for a few
03:22 - seconds and then continue watching
03:25 - so here are those four things the first
03:28 - thing is that all my variable names are
03:30 - descriptive and meaningful so students
03:34 - count represents the number of students
03:36 - for a course or course name clearly
03:39 - explains that this variable holds the
03:41 - name of a course one of the issues that
03:43 - I see a lot amongst beginner programmers
03:46 - is that they use mystical names for
03:49 - their variables something like this see
03:52 - n as in short for course name when
03:54 - someone else reads this code they have
03:56 - no idea what CN stands for or they use
03:59 - variable names like c1 when I look at
04:02 - that code I wonder where you see two and
04:04 - what is the difference between c1 and c2
04:07 - so these variable names are very
04:09 - mystical that's a bad practice
04:11 - make sure your variable names are always
04:13 - descriptive and meaningful because this
04:16 - makes your code more maintainable now
04:19 - there are times that you can use short
04:21 - variable names like X Y Z if you're
04:24 - dealing with things like coordinates so
04:27 - that's an exception now the second thing
04:30 - that I have consistently used in this
04:32 - code is that I have used lowercase
04:34 - letters to name my variables so here we
04:37 - don't have course name all in capital or
04:41 - in title case all letters are lowercase
04:45 - right let's delete this the third thing
04:49 - that I've consistently used here is that
04:52 - I have used an underscore to separate
04:54 - multiple words and I've done this to
04:57 - make my variable names more readable
04:59 - because in Python we cannot have a space
05:02 - in variable names so we cannot have
05:04 - course name and if you put these two
05:06 - words together it's a little bit hard to
05:08 - read that's why we use an underscore and
05:11 - the fourth thing that I have used
05:13 - consistently here is that I have put a
05:15 - space around this equal sign again
05:19 - that's one of the issues I see a lot
05:21 - amongst beginners they write code like
05:24 - this this is a little bit ugly this is
05:27 - what we call dirty code dirty stinky
05:31 - smelly
05:32 - you should write code that is clean and
05:33 - beautiful so other people can read it
05:36 - like a story like a newspaper are
05:39 - you should be formatted properly and
05:41 - that's why we have Pep 8 in Python now
05:45 - the good thing is if you forget these
05:46 - rules when you save the changes auto pay
05:49 - paid kicks in I didn't automatically
05:51 - reformat your code but that aside you
05:53 - should always give yourself the habit of
05:55 - writing clean code without relying too
05:58 - much on the tooling so these are all the
06:01 - best practices about naming your
06:03 - variables next we're going to look at
06:05 - strings in more detail

Cleaned transcript:

let's start this section by a discussion of variables which are one of the core concepts in programming we use variables to store data in computer's memory here are a few examples I'm going to define a variable called students under line count and setting it to a thousand when we run this program python interpreter will allocate some memory and store this number thousand in that memory space then it will have this variable reference that memory location so this variable is just like a label for that memory location we can use this variable or this label anywhere in our program to get access to that memory location and the data is stored there so now if we print students count and run our program we will get the number of thousand so this is the basic of variables now what kind of data can be a store in computer's memory well we have several different kinds of data in this section we're going to look at the builtin primitive types in Python primitive types can be numbers boolean and strings let me show you so here we have a whole number we refer to this as an integer in programming we can also have numbers with a decimal point let's take a look so rating we set this to four point nine nine this is what we call a float or a floatingpoint number and this terminology is not specific to Python in the future when you learn a new programming language you're going to hear these terms
