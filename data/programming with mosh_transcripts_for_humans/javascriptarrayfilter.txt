00:03 - in this lecture I'm gonna show you how
00:05 - to filter an array based on a search
00:07 - criteria so back to our numbers array
00:09 - let's say we want to return only the
00:12 - positive numbers so we can use the
00:15 - filter method like this filter once
00:18 - again we need to pass a callback
00:20 - function this function has three
00:22 - parameters value index and array so out
00:28 - of this we only care about value we
00:30 - don't care about the index because I
00:32 - just want to see if the number or the
00:34 - value is positive so function value now
00:40 - here we can write a simple expression
00:43 - like this if value is greater than or
00:45 - equal to zero so when we call the filter
00:49 - method this method will loop through
00:51 - this array and execute this callback
00:54 - function for each number for each
00:56 - element
00:57 - now if the element matches this criteria
00:59 - it will add this element to a new array
01:02 - and finally we can get the new array
01:05 - here so filtered let's take a look at
01:10 - the result filtered so in our filtered
01:14 - array we have only one two and three
01:16 - now earlier you learn about arrow
01:18 - functions so this is a good case where
01:20 - you would use an arrow function you have
01:22 - a single line of code in this function
01:25 - and we're simply returning a value so we
01:28 - get rid of the function keyword put a
01:31 - fat arrow between the parameter and the
01:33 - body of this function we don't need the
01:36 - parentheses because we have a single
01:38 - parameter and because we're simply
01:39 - returning a value we can also exclude
01:42 - the return keyword as well as the curly
01:46 - braces and then put everything on the
01:48 - same line like this now we can make this
01:52 - code a little bit shorter so in this
01:54 - case we can use an abbreviation like V
01:57 - for value or n for a number because it's
02:01 - obvious that we're working with the
02:03 - numbers array so we filter and we get
02:06 - numbers where number is greater than or
02:10 - equal to zero here we're dealing with an
02:13 - array of numbers in a real world
02:15 - application you would be using
02:16 - an array of objects for example here on
02:20 - the Yelp website we can click this
02:22 - button to find only the restaurants that
02:25 - are open now so this is one kind of
02:29 - filtering so if you want to implement
02:31 - something like this instead of an array
02:34 - of numbers you would have an array of
02:36 - restaurants and each restaurant has
02:39 - opening hours so you could filter
02:41 - restaurants that are currently open and
02:43 - return them
02:48 - hi guys thank you for watching my
02:50 - javascript tutorial this tutorial is
02:52 - part of my JavaScript course where you
02:54 - learn all the essential JavaScript
02:57 - features that every web and mobile
02:59 - application developer must know if
03:01 - you're an absolute beginner or have some
03:03 - experience in JavaScript and are looking
03:05 - for a fun and in-depth course that
03:07 - teaches you the fundamentals of
03:09 - JavaScript this course is for you this
03:11 - course is also packed with tons of
03:13 - exercises that help you master what you
03:15 - learned in the course in fact many of
03:17 - these exercises are questions that come
03:20 - up in technical programming interviews
03:22 - so if you're pursuing a job as a
03:24 - front-end or a back-end developer or if
03:27 - you simply want to have a more in-depth
03:29 - understanding of JavaScript I highly
03:31 - encourage you to enroll in the course
