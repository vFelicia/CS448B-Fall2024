00:00 - [Music]
00:01 - so in the last video you learned that
00:03 - note is a runtime environment for
00:05 - executing JavaScript code but what is it
00:08 - runtime environment really well before
00:11 - node we use JavaScript only to build
00:13 - applications and run inside of a browser
00:16 - so every browser out there has what we
00:19 - call a JavaScript engine that takes our
00:22 - JavaScript code and converts it to code
00:25 - that a computer can understand for
00:27 - example Microsoft ed uses chakra Firefox
00:30 - uses spider monkey and chrome uses v8
00:34 - and is because of these varieties of
00:36 - engines that sometimes JavaScript code
00:39 - can behave differently in one browser or
00:42 - another now a browser provides a runtime
00:45 - environment for JavaScript code for
00:47 - example you probably know that in
00:49 - browsers we have the window or the
00:51 - document object these objects allow us
00:54 - to work with the environment in which
00:56 - our code is running now up to 2009 the
01:00 - only way to execute JavaScript code was
01:03 - inside of a browser in 2009 Brian Dahl
01:07 - the creator of node came up with a
01:09 - brilliant idea he thought it would be
01:11 - great to execute JavaScript outside of a
01:14 - browser so he took Google's v8 engine
01:17 - which is the fastest JavaScript engine
01:20 - out there and embedded it inside a C++
01:23 - program and called that program note so
01:26 - similar to a browser note is a runtime
01:29 - environment for JavaScript code it
01:31 - contains a JavaScript engine that can
01:33 - execute our JavaScript code but it also
01:36 - has certain objects that provide an
01:39 - environment for our JavaScript code but
01:42 - these objects are different from the
01:43 - environment objects we have in browsers
01:45 - for example we don't have the document
01:47 - object instead we have other objects
01:50 - that give us more interesting
01:51 - capabilities for example we can work
01:53 - with the file system listen for requests
01:56 - and a given port and so on we can't do
01:59 - stuff like that inside of a browser
02:00 - right so in essence node is a program
02:04 - that includes the v8 JavaScript engine
02:07 - plus some additional modules that give
02:10 - us capabilities not available inside
02:13 - browsers we can work with the file
02:15 - system or the network and so on both
02:18 - chrome and note share the same
02:20 - JavaScript engine but they provide
02:22 - different runtime environments for
02:24 - JavaScript now I've seen people
02:26 - conferring no to c-sharp or Ruby or some
02:30 - other programming languages but this
02:32 - comparisons are fundamentally wrong
02:34 - because node is not a programming
02:36 - language it's like comparing a car with
02:39 - an apple by the same token note should
02:42 - not be compared with frameworks such as
02:44 - a spool of meth or rails or Django and
02:47 - so on these are frameworks for building
02:50 - web applications note is not a framework
02:52 - it's a runtime environment for executing
02:55 - JavaScript code next we're going to look
02:58 - at how node works
03:01 - hi guys it's mush here thank you for
03:04 - watching my node tutorial I just wanted
03:06 - to let you know that this video you've
03:08 - been watching it's part of my complete
03:10 - node course where you will learn
03:12 - everything about node from the basic to
03:14 - the advanced topics if you're serious
03:16 - about learning node I highly recommend
03:18 - you to enroll in my node course because
03:20 - this is much faster than jumping from
03:22 - one tutorial to another it saves you
03:24 - time plus you're going to get a lot of
03:27 - exercises that will prepare you for the
03:29 - real work and also at the end of the
03:31 - course you'll receive a certificate of
03:33 - completion that you can provide your
03:35 - current or future employer so if you
03:38 - want to enroll click on the link in the
03:40 - video description I hope to see you in
03:42 - the course

Cleaned transcript:

so in the last video you learned that note is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code but what is it runtime environment really well before node we use JavaScript only to build applications and run inside of a browser so every browser out there has what we call a JavaScript engine that takes our JavaScript code and converts it to code that a computer can understand for example Microsoft ed uses chakra Firefox uses spider monkey and chrome uses v8 and is because of these varieties of engines that sometimes JavaScript code can behave differently in one browser or another now a browser provides a runtime environment for JavaScript code for example you probably know that in browsers we have the window or the document object these objects allow us to work with the environment in which our code is running now up to 2009 the only way to execute JavaScript code was inside of a browser in 2009 Brian Dahl the creator of node came up with a brilliant idea he thought it would be great to execute JavaScript outside of a browser so he took Google's v8 engine which is the fastest JavaScript engine out there and embedded it inside a C++ program and called that program note so similar to a browser note is a runtime environment for JavaScript code it contains a JavaScript engine that can execute our JavaScript code but it also has certain objects that provide an environment for our JavaScript code but these objects are different from the environment objects we have in browsers for example we don't have the document object instead we have other objects that give us more interesting capabilities for example we can work with the file system listen for requests and a given port and so on we can't do stuff like that inside of a browser right so in essence node is a program that includes the v8 JavaScript engine plus some additional modules that give us capabilities not available inside browsers we can work with the file system or the network and so on both chrome and note share the same JavaScript engine but they provide different runtime environments for JavaScript now I've seen people conferring no to csharp or Ruby or some other programming languages but this comparisons are fundamentally wrong because node is not a programming language it's like comparing a car with an apple by the same token note should not be compared with frameworks such as a spool of meth or rails or Django and so on these are frameworks for building web applications note is not a framework it's a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code next we're going to look at how node works hi guys it's mush here thank you for watching my node tutorial I just wanted to let you know that this video you've been watching it's part of my complete node course where you will learn everything about node from the basic to the advanced topics if you're serious about learning node I highly recommend you to enroll in my node course because this is much faster than jumping from one tutorial to another it saves you time plus you're going to get a lot of exercises that will prepare you for the real work and also at the end of the course you'll receive a certificate of completion that you can provide your current or future employer so if you want to enroll click on the link in the video description I hope to see you in the course
