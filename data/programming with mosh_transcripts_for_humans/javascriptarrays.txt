With timestamps:

00:02 - sometimes in your applications you might
00:05 - be dealing with a list of objects for
00:08 - example the list of products in a
00:10 - shopping cart or the list of colors the
00:13 - user has selected in situations like
00:15 - that you use an array to store that list
00:18 - let me show you how so here I'm gonna
00:21 - declare another variable called selected
00:24 - colors note that I'm using a meaningful
00:27 - name I don't have SC or some other weird
00:31 - name selected colors now we can
00:34 - initialize this and set it to an empty
00:36 - array so these square brackets or what
00:40 - we call array literal and they indicate
00:43 - an empty array now we can initialize
00:46 - this array and add a couple of items
00:49 - like red and blue let's Lock this on the
00:54 - console so console the long selected
00:58 - colors save the changes so here's our
01:01 - array with two elements we can expand
01:04 - that note that each element has an index
01:07 - and that determines the position of that
01:10 - element in the array so the index of the
01:13 - first element is zero and the index of
01:15 - the second element is one so if you want
01:18 - to access an element in an array we use
01:20 - this index here's how for example let's
01:23 - say you want to display the first
01:25 - element in this array you use the square
01:28 - brackets and then specify the index save
01:32 - the changes and now we have red now
01:35 - earlier I told you that JavaScript is a
01:37 - dynamic language so the type of
01:39 - variables can change at runtime the same
01:42 - principle applies to our arrays so the
01:45 - lengths of arrays as well as the type of
01:48 - objects we have in an array are dynamic
01:50 - they can change so aligned - we
01:54 - initialize this array with two elements
01:56 - right now on line 3 we can add another
02:00 - element to this array so the array will
02:02 - expand so let's say selected colors of 2
02:07 - that means the third item in this array
02:09 - is going to be green
02:12 - now let's display this array on the
02:16 - console
02:17 - so we have an array with three elements
02:20 - so the length is dynamic it can change
02:22 - also the type of objects we have in this
02:25 - array is dynamic so unlike other
02:28 - programming languages where every item
02:31 - or every object in the array should have
02:33 - the same type in JavaScript we can store
02:36 - different types in an array so we can
02:39 - make the last element a number save the
02:42 - changes now we have two strings and a
02:45 - number so the objects in the array as
02:47 - well as the size of the array are
02:49 - dynamic now technically an array is an
02:52 - object so just like the personal object
02:54 - we defined in the last lecture it has a
02:57 - bunch of key value pairs or properties
02:59 - that we can access using the dot
03:01 - notation let me prove that to you so
03:03 - here on the console let's look at the
03:05 - type of selected colors so the type of
03:10 - this array is an object so an array is
03:13 - an object in JavaScript so here on line
03:16 - 4 we can look at the properties of this
03:19 - array or this object using the dot
03:21 - notation look these are all the
03:24 - properties defined in arrays in
03:26 - JavaScript so every time we declare an
03:29 - array using square brackets that array
03:32 - will automatically receive these
03:34 - properties we didn't explicitly define
03:36 - them they're just somehow magically
03:39 - inherited from somewhere else we're
03:41 - going to learn about that later when we
03:43 - talk about prototypes now in this
03:45 - lecture we're going to look at one of
03:47 - these properties that is the length
03:49 - property this property returns the
03:52 - number of items or elements in an array
03:55 - so save the changes you can see we have
03:57 - three elements in this array now later
04:00 - in the course we have a comprehensive
04:01 - section about arrays you'll learn about
04:04 - all kinds of operations we can perform
04:06 - on arrays for now all I want you to take
04:09 - away is that an array is a data
04:11 - structure that we use to represent a
04:14 - list of items
04:19 - hi guys thank you for watching my
04:21 - javascript tutorial this tutorial is
04:23 - part of my JavaScript course where you
04:26 - learn all the essential JavaScript
04:28 - features that every web and mobile
04:30 - application developer must know if
04:32 - you're an absolute beginner or have some
04:34 - experience in JavaScript and are looking
04:36 - for a fun and in-depth course that
04:38 - teaches you the fundamentals of
04:40 - JavaScript this course is for you this
04:42 - course is also packed with tons of
04:44 - exercises that help you master what you
04:46 - learned in the course in fact many of
04:48 - these exercises are questions that come
04:51 - up in technical programming interviews
04:53 - so if you're pursuing a job as a
04:55 - front-end or a back-end developer or if
04:58 - you simply want to have a more in-depth
05:00 - understanding of JavaScript I highly

sometimes in your applications you might be dealing with a list of objects for example the list of products in a shopping cart or the list of colors the user has selected in situations like that you use an array to store that list let me show you how so here I'm gonna declare another variable called selected colors note that I'm using a meaningful name I don't have SC or some other weird name selected colors now we can initialize this and set it to an empty array so these square brackets or what we call array literal and they indicate an empty array now we can initialize this array and add a couple of items like red and blue let's Lock this on the console so console the long selected colors save the changes so here's our array with two elements we can expand that note that each element has an index and that determines the position of that element in the array so the index of the first element is zero and the index of the second element is one so if you want to access an element in an array we use this index here's how for example let's say you want to display the first element in this array you use the square brackets and then specify the index save the changes and now we have red now earlier I told you that JavaScript is a dynamic language so the type of variables can change at runtime the same principle applies to our arrays so the lengths of arrays as well as the type of objects we have in an array are dynamic they can change so aligned we initialize this array with two elements right now on line 3 we can add another element to this array so the array will expand so let's say selected colors of 2 that means the third item in this array is going to be green now let's display this array on the console so we have an array with three elements so the length is dynamic it can change also the type of objects we have in this array is dynamic so unlike other programming languages where every item or every object in the array should have the same type in JavaScript we can store different types in an array so we can make the last element a number save the changes now we have two strings and a number so the objects in the array as well as the size of the array are dynamic now technically an array is an object so just like the personal object we defined in the last lecture it has a bunch of key value pairs or properties that we can access using the dot notation let me prove that to you so here on the console let's look at the type of selected colors so the type of this array is an object so an array is an object in JavaScript so here on line 4 we can look at the properties of this array or this object using the dot notation look these are all the properties defined in arrays in JavaScript so every time we declare an array using square brackets that array will automatically receive these properties we didn't explicitly define them they're just somehow magically inherited from somewhere else we're going to learn about that later when we talk about prototypes now in this lecture we're going to look at one of these properties that is the length property this property returns the number of items or elements in an array so save the changes you can see we have three elements in this array now later in the course we have a comprehensive section about arrays you'll learn about all kinds of operations we can perform on arrays for now all I want you to take away is that an array is a data structure that we use to represent a list of items hi guys thank you for watching my javascript tutorial this tutorial is part of my JavaScript course where you learn all the essential JavaScript features that every web and mobile application developer must know if you're an absolute beginner or have some experience in JavaScript and are looking for a fun and indepth course that teaches you the fundamentals of JavaScript this course is for you this course is also packed with tons of exercises that help you master what you learned in the course in fact many of these exercises are questions that come up in technical programming interviews so if you're pursuing a job as a frontend or a backend developer or if you simply want to have a more indepth understanding of JavaScript I highly encourage you to enroll in the course for a limited time you can get this course with a discount using the link in the video description click the link to find out more about the course and enroll
