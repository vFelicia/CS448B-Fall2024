00:01 - no js' or note is an open source and
00:04 - cross-platform runtime environment for
00:08 - executing JavaScript code outside of a
00:11 - browser quite often we use no to build
00:13 - back-end services also called api's or
00:17 - application programming interfaces these
00:20 - are the services that power our client
00:23 - applications like a web app running
00:25 - inside of a web browser or mobile app
00:28 - running on a mobile device these client
00:31 - apps are simply what the user sees and
00:33 - interacts with they're just the surface
00:36 - they need to talk to some services
00:38 - sitting on the server or in the cloud to
00:41 - store data send emails or push
00:44 - notifications kick off workflows and so
00:46 - on node is ideal for building highly
00:50 - scalable data intensive and real-time
00:53 - back-end services that power our client
00:56 - applications now you might ask but mosh
00:58 - there are other tools and frameworks out
01:01 - there for building back-end services
01:03 - such as a speed a bed rails Django and
01:06 - so on so what's so special about no well
01:09 - note is easy to get started and can be
01:12 - used for prototyping and agile
01:15 - development but it can also be used for
01:17 - building super fast and highly scalable
01:20 - services it's used in production by
01:23 - large companies such as PayPal uber
01:25 - Netflix Walmart and so on
01:28 - in fact at PayPal that rebuilt one of
01:31 - their Java and spring based applications
01:33 - using node and it found that the node
01:36 - application was built twice as fast with
01:39 - fewer people in 33% fewer lines of code
01:43 - and 40% fewer files and more importantly
01:47 - they double the number of requests
01:49 - served per second while decreasing the
01:52 - average response time by 35% so node is
01:56 - an excellent choice for building highly
01:58 - scalable services another reason for
02:01 - using note is that in node applications
02:03 - we use JavaScript so if you're a
02:06 - front-end developer and know JavaScript
02:08 - you can reuse your JavaScript skills and
02:11 - - a full-stack developer and get a
02:14 - better job with better pay you don't
02:16 - have to learn a new programming language
02:17 - also because you can use JavaScript both
02:21 - on the front end and on the back end
02:23 - your source code will be cleaner and
02:25 - more consistent so you will use the same
02:28 - naming conventions the same tools and
02:30 - the same best practices and finally
02:32 - another reason for using node is that it
02:35 - has the largest ecosystem of open source
02:37 - libraries available to you so for pretty
02:40 - much any features or building blocks you
02:42 - want to add your application there is
02:44 - some free open source library out there
02:47 - that you can use so you don't have to
02:49 - build this building blocks from scratch
02:51 - and instead you can focus on the core of
02:54 - your application next we're going to
02:56 - look at the architecture of node hi guys
03:01 - it's maj here thank you for watching my
03:03 - node tutorial I just wanted to let you
03:05 - know that this video you've been
03:06 - watching it's part of my complete node
03:09 - course where you will learn everything
03:10 - about node from the basic to the
03:12 - advanced topics if you're serious about
03:14 - learning node I highly recommend you to
03:16 - enroll in my node course because this is
03:19 - much faster than jumping from one
03:21 - tutorial to another it saves you time
03:23 - plus you're going to get a lot of
03:25 - exercises that will prepare you for the
03:27 - real work and also at the end of the
03:29 - course you'll receive a certificate of
03:31 - completion that you can provide your
03:33 - current or future employer so if you
03:36 - want to enroll click on the link in the
03:38 - video description I hope to see you in
03:40 - the course
