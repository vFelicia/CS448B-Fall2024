00:09 - hello everybody my name is madani I
00:11 - teach mostly c.net courses as.net and
00:15 - the framework and some angular courses I
00:18 - started 3 years ago but I knew about you
00:20 - didn't be long before in fact my
00:22 - inspiration was Mark lass off if I
00:25 - pronounce his last name properly I don't
00:27 - think he's here um one day I came to his
00:29 - page on Facebook and I saw he has he had
00:32 - like 5,000 students and the price of his
00:34 - course was like $100 and I said wow this
00:37 - guy is making million dollars with with
00:39 - just one course and I didn't know all
00:41 - these courses are sold at $10 or
00:43 - $20 so I wanted to do that for a long
00:46 - time but um working full-time as a
00:49 - software engineer it was really hard
00:51 - when I came home it was I had no energy
00:53 - to pruc of course until I decided to
00:56 - quit my job and uh decided not to look
00:59 - for a new new job and created my first
01:01 - un course so I spent about 3 weeks to
01:05 - create one hour of content hardly made
01:08 - $0000 maybe
01:09 - $50 and then I created another course
01:12 - for 6 hours which took me about six
01:14 - weeks of production and that was one of
01:17 - the on demand courses in un Miss Hot
01:20 - Topic list and that course also didn't
01:22 - sell it was like $100 at the best and
01:26 - then I looked for a new job and they
01:28 - said okay you're going to start 3 weeks
01:31 - and I thought okay what am I what am I
01:32 - going to do in those three weeks I don't
01:34 - want to sit at home watch TV so I ended
01:36 - up creating my third course uh that was
01:39 - my C Advanced course and I started to
01:41 - earn about $1,000 a month and I thought
01:44 - okay this is working all I all my
01:47 - expectation was about 500 extra cash a
01:49 - month nothing more I wasn't like I want
01:51 - to become a millionaire on you that no
01:53 - just wanted $500 extra and I order to
01:57 - reach my goal and then I discovered my
01:59 - passion for teaching and I never really
02:01 - looked for making money on this platform
02:03 - was just getting feedback from my
02:05 - students about what they wanted to learn
02:06 - from me and I created lots of courses
02:09 - and then they organically grew in terms
02:11 - of funny story they wanted me to share I
02:14 - used to live in Melbourne Australia and
02:16 - I I just moved to LA about 2 months ago
02:19 - and one night I was out salsa dancing
02:22 - and people in this crowd would do a bit
02:24 - of Latin dancing they know the etiquette
02:26 - so you dance with one person they say
02:27 - thank you and then you move on to the
02:29 - next person
02:30 - so after I finished dancing with a lady
02:33 - a guy tapped me on the shoulder like he
02:34 - wanted to ask me for a
02:36 - dance and he said are you m hamadani and
02:41 - I looked different there because I was
02:43 - wearing a hat different look from what
02:44 - you see in my videos and I said yeah he
02:48 - said I'm one of your students I've taken
02:49 - a lot of your courses so he was the
02:51 - first student that I ever met in person
02:54 - I think the last two that I ever met did
02:56 - you dance with
02:58 - no it
03:06 - l yeah so in in my courses in every
03:08 - section at the end of the section I have
03:10 - a practice which is a coding exercise
03:12 - not a quiz not question and answer it's
03:15 - a coding exercise they have to build
03:16 - something and it's something that they
03:18 - can do in 30 minutes not something that
03:20 - they're going to spend two days three
03:22 - days and then become
03:24 - disappointed sorry and then I also
03:26 - showed the solution myself how I start
03:29 - that project check how I'm thinking
03:31 - throughout this journey how I change my
03:33 - code how I refactor it and make it
03:35 - better give them some tips along the way
03:38 - like some shortcuts to write code faster
03:40 - uh something more than just giving them
03:42 - the solution I I show them the house and
03:45 - wise um and then I also upload the code
03:47 - to GitHub some people love GitHub the
03:49 - others don't like it they like
03:51 - attachments as zip fi so I I try to
03:53 - cater for different kinds of audiences
03:55 - how many of those exercises do you
03:57 - typically include in your horses how how
03:59 - many so each course I have on average
04:02 - has about 10 to 15 sections so one
04:05 - exercise at least a section sometimes
04:07 - two in fact U I've asked my students in
04:10 - my surveys uh what do you think about my
04:12 - teaching what do you think I can improve
04:14 - and I still get a lot of feedback we
04:17 - need more exercises even though
04:19 - sometimes I include two exercise per
04:21 - section they want
04:23 - more how do you stay on top of that
04:25 - sorry how do you stay on top of all of
04:27 - the exercises it's really hard um
04:30 - because
04:32 - um I have limited time just like
04:34 - everyone else throughout the day and
04:36 - part of me wants to create more content
04:38 - for those people who are hungry for
04:39 - learning more but at the same time I
04:42 - have to slow down and um yeah create
04:45 - more exercises for people who need a
04:46 - little more
04:52 - Health yeah YouTube I had zero
04:55 - subscribers I started there just like
04:57 - everyone else and I never thought I
04:59 - could have 70,000 subscribers but I got
05:01 - it pretty quickly um all you have to do
05:04 - is upload really good quality videos
05:06 - don't be greedy thinking oh no I want to
05:09 - keep the good quality ones for my course
05:10 - and just show an introduction for two
05:12 - minutes it's like an advertisement
05:14 - people are not going to get your course
05:16 - share as much content as you want be as
05:19 - you can be generous uh like my YouTube
05:22 - videos are about 1 hour sometimes one
05:24 - and a half hour and they can learn a lot
05:26 - from that they don't have to come and en
05:27 - roll my course but those who are more
05:30 - passionate they're more dedicated to
05:31 - learn I put a link in the video
05:33 - description and I give them a
05:35 - coupon uh in terms of um something I
05:38 - wanted to add for to previous question
05:41 - when I want to publish a course I almost
05:43 - announce on YouTube about two months
05:45 - before say hey in a month or two months
05:48 - uh I'm going to publish this course so I
05:50 - give them heads up and a lot of people
05:52 - start to get excited about that then
05:54 - when it gets closer about the week
05:56 - before I send another announcement
05:58 - sometimes it's a short simp video that I
06:00 - take with my phone and then when the
06:02 - course is released I send the coupons
06:05 - and I say this is valid for 3 4 days uh
06:08 - and then after I take these videos off
06:09 - my YouTube channel because I don't like
06:11 - it to look salesy it's just for a
06:13 - special
06:20 - location this is actually very good
06:22 - question Cu uh both Max and I recreated
06:25 - our course from scratch just because of
06:27 - an update for SC
06:30 - so I feel your pain um sometimes if
06:33 - there are dramatic changes you really
06:35 - have to create a course from scratch
06:37 - because in my case I tried to patch the
06:39 - course and that didn't work I tried to
06:41 - add supplementary videos in between and
06:44 - also some PDFs attach them to specific
06:47 - lectures saying these are the
06:49 - syntactical changes some people loved it
06:52 - they said that's perfect there were a
06:53 - lot of people who complained and that's
06:55 - why I ended up recreating the course
06:57 - from scratch um so honestly I don't have
07:01 - a specific formula that works for
07:02 - everyone but these are the things I
07:04 - played with and you can try them on your
07:05 - own so options are patching the videos
07:08 - or adding supplementary materials but in
07:11 - forms of PDF or video or recreating the
07:13 - course from scratch hopefully that won't
07:21 - happen
