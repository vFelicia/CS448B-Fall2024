00:02 - company behind chat GPD revealed a
00:05 - groundbreaking new technology called
00:07 - voice engine let's break down what it is
00:09 - what it can do and what are some
00:11 - potential
00:14 - dangers so voice engine is a new AI
00:17 - model that can clone anyone's Voice
00:20 - using a 15-second audio sample so you
00:22 - give it a 15-second sample and some text
00:25 - and it will generate Supernatural speech
00:28 - that closely resembles the original
00:30 - speaker let's hear an example here's the
00:32 - original voice force is a push or pull
00:36 - that can make an object move stop or
00:39 - change direction now listen to the
00:41 - version created with a voice engine some
00:43 - of the most amazing habitats on Earth
00:45 - are found in the rainforest a rainforest
00:48 - is a place with a lot of precipitation
00:50 - pretty mind-blowing right but why is
00:52 - this such big news let's break it down
00:54 - well first of all voice engine isn't the
00:57 - only text to speech tool out there many
00:59 - tools EX exist for this purpose some of
01:01 - them use AI While others use more
01:03 - traditional methods but the reason voice
01:05 - engine stands out is that it can
01:07 - generate incredibly realistic speech
01:10 - capturing Nuance language and accents
01:12 - using only a 15sec sample in contrast
01:15 - play. HD requires a 1hour audio sample
01:19 - to do the same job and I don't know if
01:21 - the quality is as good so voice engine
01:23 - is pretty cool and it has many potential
01:26 - uses it could help patients who have
01:28 - lost their voice due to illness or
01:29 - injury for example take this young
01:31 - patient who lost her speech due to a
01:34 - brain
01:35 - tumor hi everyone this is what my voice
01:39 - sounds like losing open now listen to
01:43 - how she sounded in the past when you
01:45 - have all of your ingredients together
01:48 - you are going to put the chopped
01:49 - broccoli and chopped banana peppers
01:51 - inside the bowl so they gave the sample
01:53 - to voice engine and here's what's
01:56 - generated hi everyone this is what my
01:58 - voice sounds like using open ai's new
02:00 - text to speech model called voice engine
02:03 - voice engine can also allow businesses
02:05 - and creators to translate content and
02:08 - reach more people around the world using
02:10 - their own voice for example here's
02:12 - another reference
02:13 - audio friendship is a Universal Treasure
02:16 - it brings joy support and laughter into
02:18 - our lives no matter where we are in the
02:20 - world now with voice engine we can
02:22 - generate the same speech with the same
02:24 - voice but in different languages like
02:26 - Spanish Mandarin German and so on let's
02:29 - listen to a few generated
02:42 - samples it's really really cool now in
02:45 - the future you could potentially have
02:47 - your favorite celebrity read you a
02:49 - bedtime story imagine getting Morgan
02:51 - Freeman to narrate your favorite book it
02:54 - opens up a whole new personalized
02:56 - experience but as with any amazing new
02:59 - technology there's always a downside
03:01 - imagine someone cloning your voice or
03:03 - the voice of a politician and making
03:05 - them say awful things with elections
03:08 - coming up this Tech could be a weapon
03:10 - for spreading fake news and damaging
03:12 - reputations that's why open AI is taking
03:15 - extreme precautions right now voice
03:17 - engine isn't open to the public only a
03:20 - small group of trusted Partners can use
03:22 - it and they absolutely need permission
03:24 - from the original speaker to avoid
03:26 - misuse plus they're adding hidden
03:28 - watermarks to the audio so if someone
03:30 - tries to do something Shady it can be
03:32 - traced back to them so we all have to
03:35 - start thinking about how such
03:36 - Technologies impact Our Lives how do we
03:39 - know what's real and what's fake when
03:41 - voices can be perfectly imitated should
03:43 - there be laws to protect us from people
03:45 - using our voice without our permission
03:48 - these are conversations we need to have
03:49 - and we need to have them now so what's
03:51 - your take is the future of voice
03:53 - technology exciting scary or a little
03:56 - bit of both let's get a discussion going
