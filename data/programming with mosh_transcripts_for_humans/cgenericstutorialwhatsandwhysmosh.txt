00:02 - hi guys my name is mohammad ani and in
00:05 - this video I'm going to talk about
00:06 - c-sharp generics before we start with
00:09 - generics let me explain what problem
00:11 - generics came to solve in Dolphin
00:13 - version 1 we didn't have generics so
00:16 - let's say we wanted to create a list to
00:18 - store a list of numbers this is a simple
00:22 - and basic implementation of a list we
00:24 - could have a method called add to add a
00:27 - number to the list and an indexer that
00:30 - returns their number at the given index
00:33 - now of course there are more methods
00:35 - like remove and find and I'm just
00:37 - leaving that for simplicity here because
00:39 - the intention is to talk about generics
00:41 - and not data structures now if you
00:44 - wanted to store books in a list
00:46 - obviously this class wouldn't work so we
00:49 - had to go and create a class like this
00:51 - call it book list with a method called
00:54 - add a parameter called book and similar
00:57 - indexer now the problem here is for
01:01 - every type we have to create a separate
01:03 - list and this is a lot of code
01:06 - duplication and not productive plus if
01:09 - there is a bug we have to fix it in
01:10 - multiple places so one solution to fix
01:13 - this is to use a list of objects
01:15 - something like this with the object
01:42 - because the
01:44 - parent class for every type in dotnet we
01:46 - can easily pass any types to this method
01:49 - here or get any object from this indexer
01:52 - but there is another problem here the
01:54 - problem is performance if we use this
01:58 - class for storing value types like
02:00 - integers
02:01 - every time we insert a value type inside
02:03 - this list it has to be boxed to be
02:06 - stored as an object and every time we
02:08 - access that value it has to be unboxed
02:10 - and this has a performance penalty or
02:13 - even if you use reference types every
02:16 - time we want to cast an object let's say
02:17 - a book to an object or vice versa
02:20 - it's casting again has performance
02:23 - penalty so generics came as a solution
02:26 - to resolve this problem with generics we
02:29 - create a class once and reuse it
02:31 - multiple times and it doesn't have the
02:33 - performance penalty like with the object
02:35 - list here so let's see how we can create
02:38 - a generic list let me get rid of this
02:40 - code here so I'm going to create my
02:43 - generic list next to this one so you can
02:45 - see the differences let's start with
02:48 - public class I call it generic list now
02:52 - generics have a parameter and the
02:55 - parameters are specified with angle
02:57 - brackets so like this and we usually
02:59 - call them T as in short for template or
03:02 - type now we create our head method now
03:09 - instead of getting a book here you would
03:11 - get a T what is T we don't know yet the
03:14 - consumer of this class will specify that
03:16 - I will show you in a second similarly to
03:22 - get the object at the given index we
03:24 - return
03:25 - T
03:36 - that's all we have to do now let's see
03:38 - how we can use that we go to our program
03:41 - CSS so here your instant sharing a book
03:46 - object your is tensioning a list of
03:49 - numbers as you see and we're
03:52 - instantiating a list of books
03:54 - note that the problem here is that we
03:56 - have two different types of lists we can
03:58 - simply use our generic list instead of
04:00 - these two classes here so I can actually
04:03 - comment out this piece of code now let's
04:09 - create a list of numbers I use the
04:12 - generic list and here I specify the type
04:16 - of tea that we specified earlier so in
04:19 - this case we want the list of integers
04:20 - so I put it in here and now when I
04:25 - access the add method
04:26 - note that the parameter is of type
04:28 - integer we can use the same generic list
04:32 - to store a list of books so I specify
04:39 - book as the template parameter and say
04:42 - books that had now the add method gets
04:46 - an object of type book so new book blah
04:49 - blah blah so see we get code reusability
04:52 - and we don't have that performance
04:54 - penalty why and runtime our generic list
04:57 - is actually a list of books it's not a
05:00 - list of objects so there is no casting
05:02 - or boxing so this is the basics of
05:05 - creating a generic list now in practical
05:09 - terms most often you will be using
05:11 - generics as opposed to creating ones in
05:14 - fact I personally in my professional
05:17 - career as a.net developer have very
05:20 - rarely come across situations that I had
05:23 - to create generic classes or generic
05:24 - methods I would say maybe three or four
05:28 - times over the course of a few years
05:30 - most often you will be using the generic
05:32 - lists that are actually part of dotnet
05:34 - so you're not going to create a generic
05:36 - list in fact let me show you where all
05:39 - the generic collections are in dotnet so
05:42 - you go to system that collections
05:44 - generic and look here we've got a bunch
05:48 - of classes like dictionary
05:50 - at some interfaces like a collection I
05:53 - dictionary I in your Mirabal which is
05:55 - pretty popular i list links list list
06:02 - which is like our generic list queue
06:05 - sorted list stack and so on but in case
06:11 - you need to create a generic for the
06:13 - application you're working on the rest
06:15 - of this video I'm going to cover more
06:17 - details about creating generics so let's
06:20 - get back to our generic here see here T
06:24 - is a parameter we could have multiple
06:27 - parameters for example a use case of
06:29 - that is for dictionaries a dictionary is
06:33 - a data structure that uses a hash table
06:35 - to store and retrieve objects which
06:38 - provides a very fast and efficient way
06:40 - to access objects so with a dictionary
06:43 - we need to specify a key and a value and
06:46 - they can be of any type so let me create
06:49 - a dictionary here public class generic
06:53 - dictionary so I want a key here and a
06:58 - value note that I'm prefixing them with
07:00 - T and giving a proper name here like
07:03 - this is the template parameter for key
07:06 - and this is the template parameter for
07:07 - value I have seen some developers use
07:10 - something like T U or V here which
07:14 - actually makes no sense in terms of code
07:17 - readability
07:17 - so always prefix your generic parameters
07:21 - with T and then give it a proper name so
07:24 - in this case our dictionary has two
07:26 - parameters T key and T value our add
07:30 - method would look something like this
07:32 - T key key T value value now to use that
07:39 - we can go back to our program CS let me
07:47 - create a
07:47 - genera here generic dictionary I want my
07:52 - keys to be off type say string and
07:55 - values can be of type book this way I
07:59 - can call the add method and note that
08:02 - the first parameter is a string and the
08:05 - second is a book so I can say 1 2 3 4
08:10 - and I'm going to store this book here
08:14 - just like that another thing in a tuna
08:19 - generics is constraints look in this
08:22 - case our generic list here or generic
08:25 - dictionary any type can be passed here
08:29 - there is no limitation sometimes this is
08:33 - good like in terms of list we probably
08:35 - want to store a list of anything and
08:37 - everything so there is no need to apply
08:40 - constraint but sometimes you would want
08:42 - to limit what is being sent here let me
08:45 - walk you through some examples so back
08:48 - to our programs yes here and we use
08:56 - resharper to put it in a separate file
09:00 - okay let's say we would like to create a
09:04 - method that gets two parameters let's
09:07 - say two numbers and returns the bigger
09:09 - one so typically this is how we do it so
09:16 - if a is bigger than B we return a
09:19 - otherwise we return P now if you want to
09:22 - create a generic version of that this is
09:24 - how we do it
09:25 - so public instead of returning int
09:28 - return T and the name of the method here
09:33 - we add the template parameter and of
09:36 - course both of our parameters are going
09:38 - to be of type T so T a and T P now see
09:43 - if I write the exact same code it's not
09:48 - going to work why because at this time
09:52 - the compiler doesn't know the type of T
09:55 - so it cannot apply comparison between a
09:58 - and B at this point it thinks a and B
10:01 - are both objects let me show you that so
10:05 - these are the methods that are available
10:06 - in a which come from the object class so
10:10 - what we need to do here is we want to
10:13 - assume that both a and B implement the I
10:16 - comparable interface which provides a
10:19 - method call compare to and with that we
10:21 - can compare these two objects so that's
10:24 - a use case where we need to apply a
10:26 - constraint we apply a constraint by
10:28 - going here at the end of the method and
10:30 - saying where
10:32 - tea use : as in is I comparable with
10:39 - that if I say a dot see we get a new
10:43 - method here compared to which comes from
10:46 - my comparable so with that we can say if
10:49 - a compare to B is greater than zero
10:56 - return a otherwise return B also note
11:02 - that here I created a generic method
11:06 - inside a non-generic class and that's
11:09 - perfectly fine so you don't always have
11:11 - to start with the generic class
11:14 - you could potentially move this template
11:16 - here to the class level so utilities for
11:19 - T where T is I comparable and then we
11:24 - don't have to repeat that here and we
11:26 - can just get rid of that just like that
11:33 - okay now that you have an understanding
11:36 - of constraints and why we need them let
11:39 - me show you the other types of
11:40 - constraints here are five types of
11:43 - constraints you can say where T is I
11:46 - comparable as in applying a constraint
11:49 - to an interface or you can apply
11:51 - constraint to a class this case we are
11:54 - saying if T is a product or any of its
11:58 - children any of its subclasses you can
12:01 - say T should be a value type so we use
12:05 - the keyword struct or you could say
12:08 - where T is a class as in it has to be a
12:11 - reference type or you can say where T is
12:16 - an object that has a default constructor
12:20 - now don't worry I'm going to walk you
12:23 - through these with examples so so far
12:26 - you have seen a constraint to an
12:28 - interface let's take a look at a
12:30 - constraint to a class so I create
12:35 - class here public class a discount
12:42 - calculator T product where T products is
12:49 - a product now I'm going to move this to
12:54 - a separate file so in that case I can
13:01 - create a method here let's call it
13:03 - calculate discount which gets a
13:08 - parameter of type product or any of its
13:11 - subclasses and here look we get the
13:17 - price and title attribute or property
13:19 - earlier I created this product class let
13:23 - me show you so this is my product class
13:27 - we have a title and a price
13:30 - we also have a book class here that
13:34 - derives from the product and adds an
13:36 - extra property here called ispn so with
13:41 - that constraint when we say t product
13:44 - should be a product or any of its
13:47 - subclasses we have access to all of its
13:49 - properties or methods here now we don't
13:53 - really care about the actual calculation
13:56 - of the discount but you got the point
14:00 - let's see an example of a constraint to
14:03 - a value type so a public class nullable
14:09 - t where t is a value type let me move
14:14 - that to a separate file okay what is
14:19 - this use for well in c-sharp as you know
14:22 - value types cannot be null so an integer
14:26 - should have a value like 0 1 2 3 it
14:28 - cannot be not we can use this class to
14:31 - give our value types the ability to be
14:34 - nullable so let's create a constructor
14:36 - here let's say
14:39 - tractor we can get we can get a value
14:44 - and in this class I'm going to store it
14:47 - as an object because I want it to be
14:50 - novel so private object value and here
14:56 - let me initialize it with resharper we
14:58 - can press alt and enter here and enter
15:01 - and it automatically initializes my
15:04 - private field with the value passed in
15:06 - the constructor now I want this class to
15:09 - have a property called has value so if
15:15 - my object has a value it returns true
15:19 - otherwise if it's null it returns false
15:21 - get return so if value is not now return
15:26 - true and we can have a method called
15:30 - public which returns t get value or
15:36 - default so with this method if our
15:40 - object has initialized let's say we have
15:42 - a number that is set to 5 it returns the
15:45 - value which is 5 otherwise it returns
15:48 - the default value or that type so for
15:51 - integers it's 0 so what we need to do is
15:55 - we say if it has value then return value
16:01 - we just have to cast it because this
16:04 - value here is of type object right but
16:08 - this cast is perfectly fine and it's
16:10 - safe because that's what we are passing
16:15 - here in the constructor we're storing it
16:17 - here and it's basically being boxed to
16:19 - be stored in the object but here we are
16:21 - unboxing it and that's perfectly fine
16:23 - now what if it's not set what if it's
16:26 - not we need to find the default value
16:28 - for that type how do we do that we use
16:31 - the default operator so we say return
16:34 - default of T so default is
16:40 - a good keyword that you need to know now
16:44 - with this class what we can do is we can
16:47 - go ahead and actually I forgot to create
16:49 - a default constructor here in case the
16:51 - value is not set now let's go to our
16:54 - program CS and use that I'm going to
16:58 - clear everything here we don't need them
17:00 - anymore so I can say for number equals
17:05 - new nullable of int I can give it a
17:12 - value like five let's look something to
17:16 - consult so CW it's a code snippet press
17:19 - tab out a has value plus number that has
17:29 - value console.writeline and the actual
17:33 - value is plus number that get value or
17:37 - default let's run this code so note that
17:44 - yes it has a value and its value is set
17:47 - to five now we can use this class
17:50 - without setting a value in this case we
17:53 - have an honorable integer so let's run
17:57 - this again so it has a value no what is
18:02 - the default value it's zero now you
18:05 - don't really have to go and create this
18:06 - nullable class is actually part of
18:09 - dotnet framework you can find it in
18:12 - system dot nullable is defined here and
18:14 - in fact it's a structure and look at
18:16 - this icon here it's not a class so let's
18:25 - go here so this not able is using a
18:28 - straight to specify the T has to be a
18:31 - value type let's look at another example
18:35 - let's go to our utilities class here let
18:40 - me create another metal here
18:43 - public void do something with T now
18:50 - let's say in some specific scenarios we
18:52 - want to instantiate and instance of T so
18:58 - if you want to create an object you want
19:00 - to do something like that but that
19:02 - doesn't work because at this time the
19:04 - compiler doesn't know exactly what type
19:07 - T is referring to all it knows is that T
19:10 - should implement a comparable interface
19:13 - if you want to instantiate T here you
19:17 - need a default constructor right so what
19:20 - you can do is to apply a second
19:22 - constraint here you can separate
19:24 - constraints food coma so to have a
19:27 - constraint to a default constructor
19:29 - that's what you use new now this is
19:34 - perfectly fine so with constant
19:39 - and specify that T must implement a
19:41 - given interface or B of a given type or
19:45 - any of its subclasses or be a value type
19:48 - or a reference type or have a default
19:52 - constructor I hope you enjoyed this
19:54 - video and thank you for watching

Cleaned transcript:

hi guys my name is mohammad ani and in this video I'm going to talk about csharp generics before we start with generics let me explain what problem generics came to solve in Dolphin version 1 we didn't have generics so let's say we wanted to create a list to store a list of numbers this is a simple and basic implementation of a list we could have a method called add to add a number to the list and an indexer that returns their number at the given index now of course there are more methods like remove and find and I'm just leaving that for simplicity here because the intention is to talk about generics and not data structures now if you wanted to store books in a list obviously this class wouldn't work so we had to go and create a class like this call it book list with a method called add a parameter called book and similar indexer now the problem here is for every type we have to create a separate list and this is a lot of code duplication and not productive plus if there is a bug we have to fix it in multiple places so one solution to fix this is to use a list of objects something like this with the object because the parent class for every type in dotnet we can easily pass any types to this method here or get any object from this indexer but there is another problem here the problem is performance if we use this class for storing value types like integers every time we insert a value type inside this list it has to be boxed to be stored as an object and every time we access that value it has to be unboxed and this has a performance penalty or even if you use reference types every time we want to cast an object let's say a book to an object or vice versa it's casting again has performance penalty so generics came as a solution to resolve this problem with generics we create a class once and reuse it multiple times and it doesn't have the performance penalty like with the object list here so let's see how we can create a generic list let me

see how we can use that we go to our program CSS so here your instant sharing a book object your is tensioning a list of numbers as you see and we're instantiating a list of books note that the problem here is that we have two different types of lists we can simply use our generic list instead of these two classes here so I can actually comment out this piece of code now let's create a list of numbers I use the generic list and here I specify the type of tea that we specified earlier so in this case we want the list of integers so I put it in here and now when I access the add method note that the parameter is of type integer we can use the same generic list to store a list of books so I specify book as the template parameter and say books that had now the add method gets an

dotnet so you go to system that collections generic and look here we've got a bunch of classes like dictionary at some interfaces like a collection I dictionary I in your Mirabal which is pretty popular i list links list list which is like our generic list queue sorted list stack and so on but in case you need to create a generic for the application you're working on the rest of this video I'm going to cover more details about creating generics so let's get back to our generic here see here T is a parameter we could have multiple parameters for example a use case of that is for dictionaries a dictionary is a data structure that uses a hash table to store and retrieve objects which provides a very fast and efficient way to access objects so with a dictionary we need to specify a key and a value and they can be of any type so let me create a dictionary here public class generic dictionary so I want a key here and a value note that I'm prefixing them with T and giving a proper name here like this is the template parameter for key and this is the template parameter for value I have seen some developers use something like T U or V here which actually makes no sense in terms of code readability so always prefix your generic parameters with T and then give it a proper name so in this case our dictionary has two parameters T key and T value our add method would look something like this T key key T value value now to use that we can go back to our program CS let me create a genera here generic dictionary I want my keys to be off type say string and values can be of type book this way I can call the add method and note that the first parameter is a string and the second is a book so I can say 1 2 3 4 and I'm going to store this book here just like that another thing in a tuna generics is constraints look in this case our generic list here or generic dictionary any type can be passed here there is no limitation sometimes this is good like in terms of list we probably want to store a list of anything and everything so there is no need to apply constraint but sometimes you would want to limit what is being sent here let me walk you through some examples so back to our programs yes here and we use resharper to put it in a separate file okay let's say we would like to create a method that gets two parameters let's say two numbers and returns the bigger one so typically this is how we do it so if a is bigger than B we return a otherwise we return P now if you want to create a generic version of that this is how we do it so public instead of returning int return T and the name of the method here we add the template parameter and of course both of our parameters are going to be of type T so T a and T P now see if I write the exact same code it's not going to work why because at this time the compiler doesn't know the type of T so it cannot apply comparison between a and B at this point it thinks a and B are both objects let me show you that so these are the methods that are available in a which come from the object class so what we need to do here is we want to assume that both a and B implement the I comparable interface which provides a method call compare to and with that we can compare these two objects so that's a use case where we need to apply a constraint we apply a constraint by going here at the end of the method and saying where tea use as in is I comparable with that if I say a dot see we get a new method here compared to which comes from my comparable so with that we can say if a compare to B is greater than zero return a otherwise return B also note that here I created a generic method inside a nongeneric class and that's perfectly fine so you don't always have to start with the generic class you could potentially move this template here to the class level so utilities for T where T is I comparable and then we don't have to repeat that here and we can just get rid of that just like that okay now that you have an understanding of constraints and why we need them let me show you the other types of constraints here are five types of constraints you can say where T is I comparable as in

walk you through these with examples so so far you have seen a constraint to an interface let's take a look at a constraint to a class so I create class here public class a discount calculator T product where T products is a product now I'm going to move this to a separate file so in that case I can create a method here let's call it calculate discount which gets a parameter of type product or any of its subclasses and here look we get the price and title attribute or property earlier I created this product class let me show you so this is my product class we have a title and a price we also have a book class here that derives from the product and adds an extra property here called ispn so with that constraint when we say t product should be a product or any of its subclasses we have access to all of its properties or methods here now we don't really care about the actual calculation of the discount but you got the point let's see an example of a constraint to a value type so a public class nullable t where t is a value type let me move that to a separate file okay what is this use for well in csharp as you know value types cannot be null so an integer should have a value like 0 1 2 3 it cannot be not we can use this class to give our value types the ability to be nullable so let's create a constructor here let's say tractor we can get we can get a value and in this class I'm going to store it as an object because I want it to be novel so private object value and here let me initialize it with resharper we can press alt and enter here and enter and it automatically initializes my private field with the value passed in the constructor now I want this class to have a property called has value so if my object has a value it returns true otherwise if it's null it returns false get return so if value is not now return true and we can have a method called public which returns t get value or default so with this method if our object has initialized let's say we have a number that is set to 5 it returns the value which is 5 otherwise it returns the default value or that type so for integers it's 0 so what we need to do is we say if it has value then return value we just have to cast it because this value here is of type object right but this cast is perfectly fine and it's safe because that's what we are passing here in the constructor we're storing it here and it's basically being boxed to be stored in the object but here we are unboxing it and that's perfectly fine now what if it's not set what if it's not we need to find the default value for that type how do we do that we use the default operator so we say return default of T so default is a good keyword that you need to know now with this class what we can do is we can go ahead and actually I forgot to create a default constructor here in case the value is not set now let's go to our program CS and use that I'm going to clear everything here we don't need them anymore so I can say for number equals new nullable of int I can give it a value like five let's look something to consult so CW it's a code snippet press tab out a has value plus number that has value console.writeline and the actual value is plus number that get value or default let's run this code so note that yes it has a value and its value is set to five now we can use this class without setting a value in this case we have an honorable integer so let's run this again so it has a value no what is the default value it's zero now you don't really have to go and create this nullable class is actually part of dotnet framework you can find it in system dot nullable is defined here and in fact it's a structure and look at this icon here it's not a class so let's go here so this not able is using a straight to specify the T has to be a value type let's look at another example let's go to our utilities class here let me create another metal here public void do something with T now let's say in some specific scenarios we want to instantiate and instance of T so if you want to create an object you want to do something like that but that doesn't work because at this time the compiler doesn't know exactly what type T is referring to all it knows is that T should implement a comparable interface if you want to instantiate T here you need a default constructor right so what you can do is to apply a second constraint here you can separate constraints food coma so to have a constraint to a default constructor that's what you use new now this is perfectly fine so with constant and specify that T must implement a given interface or B of a given type or any of its subclasses or be a value type or a reference type or have a default constructor I hope you enjoyed this
