00:00 - hey guys this is padma from programmies
00:02 - and welcome back to this series on c
00:04 - programming in this video we'll learn
00:05 - about the ternary operator which can be
00:07 - used to replace if else statement in
00:09 - certain situation to make our code look
00:11 - cleaner so let's get started
00:17 - let's start with syntax of turning
00:19 - operator
00:20 - on the screen you can see the basic
00:22 - structure of ternary operator the
00:24 - ternary operator starts with the test
00:26 - condition
00:27 - like x is less than 0 or name equals to
00:30 - podma or any other boolean expression
00:32 - that evaluates to true or false if this
00:35 - test condition results in true this
00:38 - first expression before the column is
00:40 - executed and if the test condition is
00:43 - false then the second expression after
00:45 - the colon is executed
00:47 - here you can see there are three
00:48 - operands hence the name ternary operator
00:54 - now you know the syntax of ternary
00:56 - operator let's see an example here you
00:58 - can see the basic c program now i'll
01:00 - create an in variable is and assign
01:03 - value 15 to this
01:06 - then i'll create a ternary operator with
01:08 - the condition
01:10 - is is greater than or equals to 18 and
01:13 - if this condition is true i'll print you
01:15 - can vote so
01:17 - printf inside quotation i'll put you can
01:20 - vote
01:25 - and if that condition is false i'll
01:28 - print
01:30 - you cannot vote
01:34 - so i'll end this statement with the
01:36 - semicolon
01:37 - now let me run this code as you can see
01:40 - you cannot vote is printed here is is
01:42 - equals to 15 so this condition becomes
01:45 - 15 is greater than or equal to 18 which
01:48 - is false so this print statement after
01:50 - the column is printed on the screen now
01:54 - let me change this value from 15 to 24
01:57 - now this condition becomes 24 is greater
02:00 - than or equals to 18 which is true so
02:02 - this print statement before the column
02:05 - should be executed now let's run this
02:07 - code as expected we get you can vote as
02:10 - output
02:11 - here we have used print statement as
02:14 - expression inside the ternary operator
02:16 - however we can also store value from
02:18 - ternary operator to a variable and use
02:20 - the variable later let's see an example
02:23 - i'll remove this line and create a care
02:25 - variable called operator
02:27 - and i'll i'll assign
02:29 - plus to this
02:32 - then i'll create an integer variable
02:35 - num1 and i'll assign a value a to this
02:38 - and i'll create another invariable
02:41 - end num2
02:42 - and i'll assign value
02:45 - 7 to this
02:47 - now i'll cut this turnit operator and
02:49 - start with a new condition and i'll
02:52 - check if operator
02:53 - is equals to
02:55 - plus
02:58 - and if this condition is true i'll add
03:01 - num1
03:03 - with num2
03:05 - and i'll add colon here
03:07 - and if this condition is false
03:10 - i'll subtract num2 from num1 so num1
03:13 - minus num2
03:18 - this expression are returning some value
03:20 - so i'll assign this ternary operator to
03:23 - a variable so say int result
03:29 - and i'll print this variable using
03:31 - printf statement
03:33 - printf inside quotation i'll use percent
03:37 - d format specifier and the name of the
03:39 - variable that is result
03:42 - i'll run this code and you can see we
03:44 - get 15 as output which is the sum of 8
03:47 - and 7.
03:49 - here the operator is equals to plus so
03:51 - this condition is true and addition is
03:54 - performed between num1 and num2
03:58 - depending upon your requirement you can
03:59 - either print values directly or assign
04:02 - value to a variable from a ternary
04:04 - operator however if you plan to use
04:06 - values later in the program it's a good
04:08 - idea to store value in a variable by the
04:11 - way if you are watching this there is a
04:13 - good chance you want to improve your
04:14 - skills in c programming lucky for you we
04:17 - have a mobile app that provides a
04:18 - well-structured c programming course
04:20 - with certification at the end and you
04:22 - can use the app alongside the video to
04:24 - practice on the built-in compiler our
04:26 - course is free so download now by
04:28 - scanning this qr code or click the link
04:31 - in the video description
04:34 - in some of the cases we can replace the
04:37 - if else statement with a ternary
04:38 - operator this will make our code cleaner
04:41 - and shorter let me show you an example
04:43 - on your screen you can see a program
04:45 - that checks if you can vote or not using
04:47 - the fl statement on the right and turn
04:50 - it operator on the left both the program
04:52 - are doing the same tags and checking if
04:54 - a person can vote or not and you can see
04:57 - the use of ternary operator has made our
04:59 - code cleaner and shorter in such
05:02 - programs where we need to do a single
05:04 - task inside the if else statement we can
05:06 - use the ternary operator in a place of
05:08 - if else however if there are multiple
05:11 - lines of code inside the if else
05:13 - statement we should never replace that
05:15 - with the ternary operator this will make
05:17 - our code more confusing and messy

you know the syntax of ternary operator let's see an example here you can see the basic c program now i'll create an in variable is and assign value 15 to this then i'll create a ternary operator with the condition is is greater than or equals to 18 and if this condition is true i'll print you can vote so printf inside quotation i'll put you can vote and if that condition is false i'll print you cannot vote so i'll end this statement with the semicolon now let me run this code as you can see you cannot vote is printed here is is equals to 15 so this condition becomes 15 is greater than or equal to 18 which is false so this print statement after the column is printed on the screen now let me change this value from 15 to 24 now this condition becomes 24 is greater than or equals to 18 which is true so this print statement before the column should be executed now let's run this code as expected we get you can vote as output here we have used print statement as expression inside the ternary operator however we can also store value from ternary operator to a variable and use the variable later let's see an example i'll remove this line and create a care variable called operator
