00:00 - create your own BMI calculator using
00:02 - python let's start by taking input
00:05 - values for weight in cases and height in
00:07 - meters we'll use this formula to compute
00:09 - the body mass index finally let's check
00:12 - if we have a healthy body weight if BMI
00:15 - is less than 18.5 we'll print under it
00:18 - similarly if it's under 25 we'll print
00:20 - healthy weight otherwise we'll print
00:22 - over weight now let's run this code and
00:26 - here enter the weight in KZ and height
00:29 - in meters and you can see a BMI result
