00:00 - what's up guys i'm puneet from
00:01 - programmers and welcome back to this
00:02 - series on python
00:04 - in this video we will learn about the
00:05 - pass statement it's going to be one of
00:07 - the shortest video in this series
00:09 - so without any delay let's get started
00:17 - suppose you need to create a loop or a
00:19 - decision making statement
00:21 - however we are not sure yet what its
00:23 - body will be
00:24 - in such scenarios we can use the pass
00:26 - statement let me give you an example
00:29 - so i'll say number equals 5.5
00:33 - and then i'll say if number greater than
00:37 - 0.0 and then i'll add
00:40 - pass statement here when i run this
00:42 - program my code will run without any
00:45 - errors
00:46 - now i can write code after the if
00:48 - statement and run it
00:49 - and implement the statement when it's
00:51 - necessary
00:54 - before moving to the next section of the
00:55 - video i'd like to mention that the
00:57 - program is team has created an
00:59 - app that allows you to learn python from
01:00 - your phone the app contains bit size
01:03 - lessons that are easy to understand
01:04 - a built-in interpreter so that you can
01:06 - run python on your phone
01:08 - quizzes and many more features the app
01:10 - is available on both ios and android
01:12 - the links are in the video description
01:14 - below
01:15 - what would happen if we used comments
01:17 - instead of the pass statement in the
01:19 - above program
01:21 - let's find out so i'll see so i'll
01:24 - remove this pass
01:25 - and i'll say to do will figure
01:29 - out later now this time
01:33 - if i press run then python gives me an
01:36 - error it says unexpected uf while
01:38 - parsing
01:40 - this error is basically saying you
01:42 - cannot end the program file like this
01:44 - something is wrong we are getting this
01:46 - error because the body of the if
01:47 - statement is empty
01:49 - and comments don't count because python
01:51 - completely ignores comments
01:53 - so whenever you need to create loops if
01:55 - else statement
01:56 - functions and classes with an empty body
01:58 - you can temporarily use the pass
02:00 - statement
02:02 - before i end this video let me recap the
02:04 - concept that we learned
02:05 - in python pass is a null statement that
02:08 - does nothing
02:09 - the path statement can be used to create
02:11 - loops effects
02:12 - statement functions and classes with an
02:15 - empty body
02:16 - you will learn about classes and
02:17 - functions in the next few videos
02:20 - that's it for this video i hope you
02:21 - learned something if you're just
02:23 - watching the video without writing any
02:24 - code
02:25 - i highly encourage you to try the
02:26 - programs in this video on your own
02:28 - the only way you can be a good
02:30 - programmer is by trying
02:32 - by the way you can find all the programs
02:33 - from this video on github i have
02:35 - provided the link in the description
02:37 - below
02:37 - feel free to copy the programs and edit
02:40 - them as you please
02:41 - and if you have any questions and
02:43 - feedback use the comment section below
02:45 - join me in this video series and let's
02:47 - explore the exciting world of
02:48 - programming together
02:49 - in the next video we will learn about
02:51 - functions in python which is a core
02:53 - concept in
02:54 - all programming languages not just
02:56 - python if you like this video
