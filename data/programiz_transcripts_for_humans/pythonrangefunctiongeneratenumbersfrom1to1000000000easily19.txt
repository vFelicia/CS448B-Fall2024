00:00 - what's up guys i'm puneet from
00:01 - programmers and welcome back to this
00:03 - series on python
00:04 - in this video we will learn about the
00:06 - range function which creates a sequence
00:09 - of numbers
00:10 - it is commonly used in for loops to run
00:13 - the loop
00:13 - a certain number of times let's get
00:15 - started
00:25 - suppose we want a sequence of numbers
00:28 - from 1
00:29 - to 10 to get the sequence we can use the
00:32 - range function like this
00:34 - so i can say result equals range
00:37 - 1 comma 11 here the start of the
00:41 - sequence
00:42 - is inclusive but the end is exclusive
00:46 - that's why it gives us a sequence from 1
00:49 - up to 10
00:49 - and not 1 up to 11 let me print the
00:52 - result
00:53 - so i'll say print result
00:56 - and when i press run instead of
01:00 - getting the result the sequence 1 to 10
01:03 - i get range 1 11 which is basically the
01:06 - same thing i have typed here
01:08 - so what's happening well the range
01:10 - function returns a range object
01:13 - which is a sequence of characters we can
01:15 - see what's inside this object by
01:17 - converting it
01:18 - to a some other type like a list so here
01:21 - i'll convert the result
01:22 - to a list like this by using the list
01:25 - function
01:26 - and now when i press run then i get the
01:28 - sequence i was asking for that is 1
01:31 - to 10. one thing to notice here
01:35 - is that by default the step between the
01:38 - numbers
01:39 - one two three four five and up to ten
01:43 - is one we can change this step as you
01:46 - will see later in this video
01:48 - before moving to the next section of the
01:50 - video i'd like to mention that the
01:52 - program is team has created an app that
01:54 - allows you to learn python from your
01:55 - phone
01:56 - the app contains bit size lessons that
01:58 - are easy to understand
01:59 - a built-in interpreter so that you can
02:01 - run python on your phone
02:02 - quizzes and many more features the app
02:05 - is available on both ios and android the
02:07 - links are in the video description below
02:12 - since range generates a sequence of
02:14 - numbers it is commonly used in for loops
02:17 - to iterate the loop
02:18 - a certain number of times let me give
02:20 - you an example so here
02:22 - i'll remove this old code and i'll say
02:24 - for value
02:25 - in range 1 comma 6
02:29 - and then i'll say print value
02:33 - iteration here this range
02:36 - gives us a sequence from 1 which is
02:39 - included
02:40 - to 5 because 6 is not included now when
02:43 - i press
02:44 - run then it says 1 iteration 2 iteration
02:46 - it goes up to 5
02:49 - as we can see the loop iterates 5 times
02:51 - from value equal to 1 to value equals 5.
02:57 - in our examples up to now we have passed
03:00 - two parameters to the range function
03:02 - start which is the start of the sequence
03:05 - and stop
03:06 - at which the sequence stops it's also
03:09 - possible
03:09 - to use range without passing the start
03:11 - parameter
03:12 - if the start parameter is not passed 0
03:15 - is used as the default value let me give
03:18 - you an example
03:19 - so here i'll say result equals
03:22 - range 11 and then i'll say
03:26 - print list result
03:29 - now when i press run then it gives me a
03:32 - value from 0
03:33 - to 10 because it's the same as saying
03:36 - give me a range
03:37 - from 0 to 11 and when i press run
03:41 - it essentially gives me the same result
03:43 - this makes it even easier to use
03:46 - range function in a for loop suppose i
03:48 - want to iterate a loop five times
03:50 - i can simply pass five to the range
03:52 - function like this
03:53 - so i'll remove this whole code and i'll
03:55 - say for
03:57 - value in range five
04:00 - and print value this
04:04 - loop iterates five times from the value
04:07 - zero to the value equals four when i
04:10 - press run
04:11 - then you can see it says zero to four
04:17 - if you have noticed in our examples the
04:19 - gap between two consecutive numbers
04:21 - is one let me show you again so i'll
04:24 - remove this old code and i'll say result
04:26 - equals list range
04:29 - 1 11 and when i print this
04:34 - as expected it says 1 to 10
04:37 - as we can see the difference between the
04:40 - numbers
04:40 - is one this is because
04:44 - by default step of one is used
04:47 - this code is equivalent to adding one as
04:50 - the third parameter
04:52 - which is the step that we want to use
04:55 - this range function basically means
04:57 - start from this number
04:59 - go up to this number not including it
05:02 - and
05:02 - use 1 as the stepping number
05:06 - let me change the step to 3 and see what
05:09 - happens so here i'll replace this one
05:11 - with 3
05:12 - and when i press run then this time the
05:15 - difference between two consecutive items
05:17 - of this sequence
05:19 - is 3 we can also use negative numbers in
05:23 - the range function like this
05:25 - so i'll remove this old code and i'll
05:28 - say
05:28 - result equals list range
05:34 - 5 to minus 6
05:37 - and the step will be -1
05:40 - now when i print the result and press
05:43 - run
05:44 - then you can see that it started from
05:47 - the number 5
05:48 - it went up to minus 6 but not including
05:51 - -6
05:52 - and the difference between two
05:54 - consecutive
05:55 - list items is -1
05:59 - by the way range only works for integers
06:02 - we cannot use floating point numbers
06:04 - inside the range function
06:06 - at this point we have covered all the
06:08 - basics of python's range function
06:11 - before we end this video here's a task
06:13 - for you can you create a list like this
06:15 - using the range function
06:18 - i'll give you a couple of seconds to
06:19 - pause the video here
06:23 - as always you'll find the answer to this
06:25 - question in our github repository
06:27 - i'll also include this link in the
06:28 - description below
06:30 - now here's a recap of what we learned in
06:32 - this video
06:33 - the range type is used to create a
06:35 - sequence of numbers
06:37 - range is commonly used in for loops to
06:40 - iterate the loop a certain number of
06:41 - times
06:42 - we cannot use floating point numbers
06:44 - inside range
06:46 - that's it for this video i hope you
06:47 - learned something if you're just

what's up guys i'm puneet from programmers and welcome back to this series on python in this video we will learn about the range function which creates a sequence of numbers it is commonly used in for loops to run the loop a certain number of times let's get started suppose we want a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10 to get the sequence we can use the range function like this so i can say result equals range 1 comma 11 here the start of the sequence is inclusive but the end is exclusive that's why it gives us a sequence from 1 up to 10 and not 1 up to 11 let me print the result so i'll say print result and when i press run instead of getting the result the sequence 1 to 10 i get range 1 11 which is basically the same thing i have typed here so what's happening well the range function

range without passing the start parameter if the start parameter is not passed 0 is used as the default value let me give you an example so here i'll say result equals range 11 and then i'll say print list result now when i press run then it gives me a value from 0 to 10 because it's the same as saying give me a range from 0 to 11 and when i press run it essentially gives me the same result this
