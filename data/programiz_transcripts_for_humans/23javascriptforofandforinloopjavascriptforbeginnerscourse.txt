00:00 - what's up guys i'm punishment
00:01 - programmers and welcome back to this
00:02 - series on javascript in this video we
00:05 - will learn about the ways to loop over a
00:07 - list of items and also how to loop over
00:09 - an object we will talk about the for off
00:11 - loop and the for in loop so let's get
00:14 - started
00:18 - the for off loop was introduced in the
00:20 - es6 version of javascript it allows us
00:22 - to iterate over iterable objects such as
00:25 - arrays strings sets etc
00:28 - let's first look at the syntax of the
00:29 - far off loop the for off loop starts
00:32 - with a four and a parenthesis
00:34 - inside the parenthesis iterable is the
00:37 - iterable or array or string or whatever
00:39 - you want to iterate through an element
00:41 - is a variable that will store the
00:43 - current item that we are dealing with in
00:45 - those iterable
00:46 - for example suppose we have an array of
00:49 - numbers
00:50 - so i'll create an array say const
00:54 - numbers
00:55 - equals
00:56 - 1 3 five and seven
00:59 - now in a for off loop the iterable will
01:01 - be numbers
01:04 - and element i can keep it as element but
01:07 - i'll need to add a const here because
01:09 - element has not been declared before
01:11 - now in each iteration of the far-off
01:13 - loop element will contain the current
01:17 - item so it will start from 1 and 3 and 5
01:20 - and so on
01:22 - let's see this in action
01:23 - so i'll remove this and let me print the
01:26 - current value of element to verify that
01:28 - at it indeed contains
01:31 - the item
01:33 - 1 3 5 and 7. so let me press run
01:37 - and you can see that element did contain
01:39 - one in the first iteration three in the
01:41 - second iteration and so on
01:43 - let's see one more example to drive home
01:45 - this point suppose we have an array that
01:48 - contains the names of family members and
01:50 - we want to access those names however
01:53 - while accessing those names we also want
01:55 - to add the surnames to each of those
01:57 - names
01:58 - in this case we can use the for off loop
02:00 - to access each of the names and inside
02:03 - the loop we can join the surname and
02:04 - print the final name let's see a working
02:07 - example let me remove this old code
02:09 - first and let's create an array of names
02:12 - so i can say const
02:15 - members
02:16 - equals
02:20 - john
02:21 - sarah
02:23 - and jack
02:25 - now i'll create a for off loop to
02:27 - iterate over those names
02:29 - so i'll say for
02:31 - const name of
02:33 - members
02:35 - and you can see that this almost reads
02:36 - like english now so inside the loop i'll
02:39 - add the surname smith to each of those
02:41 - names and print the full name i'll also
02:43 - need to add a space between the first
02:45 - name and the last name so i'll say let
02:48 - full name equals
02:50 - name
02:51 - which will contain john sarah and jack
02:53 - respectively and plus
02:55 - and a space
02:58 - and this
03:00 - last name which is smith
03:02 - and let me console log full name to just
03:04 - make sure that this works as intended
03:07 - now when i press run
03:10 - you can see that i was able to add smith
03:13 - to each of these names respectively
03:19 - we can also use the for off loop with
03:21 - strings with strings the for off loop
03:23 - will iterate over each character of the
03:24 - string so let's see an example i'll
03:27 - create a string first let me get rid of
03:29 - this old code let me create a string
03:31 - called name
03:33 - equals
03:34 - program is
03:35 - and now
03:36 - let's see what happens when i use the
03:38 - for off loop on it so let i
03:41 - of
03:42 - name
03:44 - and let's see when i console log i
03:48 - what happens
03:49 - you can see that the value of i was p in
03:51 - the first iteration r in the second
03:53 - iteration o in the third iteration and
03:55 - so on
03:56 - that means the for off loop when used
03:58 - with a string gives me each character
04:00 - one by one

04:03 - also check out programs pro where we
04:05 - provide tutorials along with quizzes and
04:08 - challenges which will help you practice
04:09 - and test your learning in real time also
04:11 - the course includes projects to give you
04:13 - an awesome experience of how programming
04:15 - works in the real world and for our
04:16 - youtube subscribers we are giving 50 off
04:19 - on the yearly plan sign up by scanning
04:20 - this qr code or use the link in the
04:22 - video description to claim your discount
04:26 - the foreign loop is used to iterate
04:28 - through the element of an object before
04:30 - we learn about far in let's first revise
04:32 - the concept of an object in javascript
04:34 - we use objects to store multiple data
04:36 - together for example if you want to
04:38 - store information about a student you
04:40 - can use an object like this so i'll go
04:42 - back to my code editor and say const
04:45 - student equals
04:47 - and you can see i've used curly braces
04:49 - and inside here i can say name
04:51 - colon
04:52 - monica
04:55 - grade
04:57 - 7
04:58 - and
04:59 - age
05:00 - 12.
05:01 - data is stored in an object in key value
05:03 - pairs here
05:04 - name grade and age are the keys and
05:08 - monica 7 and 12 are the corresponding
05:11 - values let me quickly print this object
05:14 - and show you the output so i'll say
05:16 - console.log
05:18 - student
05:20 - and press run and you can see that i got
05:22 - the object as output
05:24 - now that we know about objects again
05:26 - let's start with the syntax of the for
05:28 - in loop
05:29 - the for in loop starts with the four
05:31 - keyword followed by parenthesis
05:33 - inside the parenthesis object represents
05:36 - the javascript object that we want to
05:38 - iterate through or we want to get the
05:39 - keys off and key represents each key of
05:42 - the object one by one let's see an
05:45 - example here we have an object from our
05:47 - earlier code now i'll use the for in
05:50 - loop to iterate over the elements of
05:51 - this object so instead of object i will
05:54 - have student
05:56 - and let me do const because key has not
05:58 - been declared before now in each
06:00 - iteration of the loop the variable key
06:02 - will specify the key of the student
06:04 - object so the first iteration the key
06:06 - will be named for the second it will be
06:08 - grade and for the third it will be age
06:11 - let's verify that
06:13 - i'll say console log key
06:15 - and when i press run
06:17 - you can see that i got name grade and
06:19 - age which were the three keys here
06:22 - now that we've successfully accessed all
06:23 - the keys of the object we can also get
06:25 - the individual values let me modify this
06:28 - code i'll first access each value using
06:30 - the key and then print key and value
06:32 - using the template string
06:34 - so let me remove this and say const
06:37 - value equals
06:39 - student
06:41 - key
06:42 - and i can say console.log for template
06:46 - string i'll use backtick and then dollar
06:50 - key because i want to print the key
06:51 - variable and let me print a fancy sign
06:54 - like this
06:55 - and let me say dollar value inside curly
06:59 - braces
07:01 - now when i press run you must have
07:04 - guessed the output by now
07:05 - i get the keys and the values
07:07 - respectively
07:09 - now the student key is the magic here
07:11 - because key contains
07:13 - name
07:14 - so student
07:16 - name becomes monica in the first
07:18 - iteration similarly in the second
07:20 - iteration key contains grade so student
07:24 - grade becomes 7 and in the last
07:26 - iteration because key is age so student
07:31 - and inside the square brackets we have
07:33 - age so student age gives me 12.
07:37 - okay guys we need your support to keep

07:40 - users youtube really likes engagement on
07:42 - the video so leave a comment below press
07:43 - that like button and hit subscribe if
07:45 - you haven't already let's get the
07:47 - engagement score high up so that more
07:49 - people can discover and enjoy these
07:50 - courses
07:55 - we can also change the values of an
07:57 - object using the for in loop let me give
07:59 - you a quick example
08:00 - suppose we have an object of employees
08:02 - that contains the name of employees as
08:04 - keys and their corresponding salaries as
08:06 - values now let's assume that the
08:08 - employees are doing a great job and the
08:09 - employer wants to provide a bonus of
08:11 - 5000 to each of these employees
08:13 - in this case we can use the for in loop
08:16 - to access the salary of each employee
08:18 - add the bonus to it and print it let's
08:20 - do exactly that so i'll start a for in
08:23 - loop like before
08:26 - like this employee
08:29 - and now let me get the salary first so
08:32 - let salary
08:34 - equals
08:35 - employee i the same pattern we had used
08:38 - last time
08:39 - and let me add 5000 to it
08:42 - now let me test my code so i'll say
08:45 - console.log
08:46 - let me again use template literals like
08:48 - before so dollar i will contain the name
08:52 - similarly the salary will be stored in
08:56 - the salary variable the new one
08:58 - and this should do it here
09:01 - i will represent each of the names which
09:04 - will be jack paul and monica which are
09:06 - the keys of this object and employee i
09:09 - will give me the values which are twenty
09:11 - four thousand thirty four thousand and
09:12 - fifty five thousand in each iteration i
09:14 - will i am adding five thousand to the
09:16 - salary and then printing the new salary
09:20 - let me run this code and see what
09:21 - happens
09:23 - you can see that 24 000 become 29 000
09:26 - and so on
09:29 - now to practice what we've learned
09:30 - here's a programming task for you create
09:32 - an array named names with values jack
09:35 - rosie and mira
09:37 - now use a for off loop to print each
09:39 - name of the array however while printing
09:42 - the name change the first character to
09:44 - uppercase to change the first character
09:46 - to uppercase let me give you a little
09:48 - hint so you can use the carat method
09:50 - with zero as a parameter to get the
09:52 - first character and you can convert it
09:54 - to uppercase using two uppercase method
09:57 - now you can use the slice method of the
09:59 - array to get
10:01 - the rest of the characters except the
10:03 - first character so you can use something
10:05 - like slice one
10:06 - and then you can join the rest of the
10:08 - characters to the first character to get
10:10 - the new name
10:11 - and then obviously you can print it
10:12 - using console.log you'll find the
10:14 - correct answer to this question in a
10:15 - github repository also if you want to
10:18 - revise these concepts you can find all
10:19 - these programs there as well i'll put

what's up guys i'm punishment programmers and welcome back to this series on javascript in this video we will learn about the ways to loop over a list of items and also how to loop over an object we will talk about the for off loop and the for in loop so let's get started the for off loop was introduced in the es6 version of javascript it allows us to iterate over iterable objects such as arrays strings sets etc let's first look at the syntax of the far off loop the for off loop starts with a four and a parenthesis inside the parenthesis iterable is the iterable or array or string or whatever
