00:00 - hey guys this is me pablo from
00:01 - programmies and welcome back to this
00:03 - series on c programming in this video
00:05 - we'll learn about enums in c programming
00:08 - we'll also learn to create variables of
00:10 - enum types and use them in our program
00:12 - so let's get started
00:17 - in c programming an enum is a type that
00:20 - has a fixed set of values let's see an
00:22 - example here we have used the enum
00:25 - keyword to create the enum named size
00:28 - this enum contains four fixed values
00:30 - small medium large and extra large these
00:34 - are called enum constant now let's
00:37 - create enum variables from the above
00:39 - enum so i'll create
00:43 - enum size
00:46 - suit size
00:51 - your suit size is an enum type variable
00:54 - this variable can now store one of the
00:57 - four values present in the enum size
01:00 - so basically the value of suicides can
01:03 - be of either small
01:05 - so i'll assign this here
01:08 - suicides can be
01:10 - small
01:13 - or this can be medium so
01:17 - medium
01:19 - or this can be
01:21 - large
01:23 - or
01:24 - it can be
01:26 - extra large
01:28 - now let's complete this example and run
01:30 - the code but before that let's first
01:33 - quickly learn about integral constant
01:38 - in c all enum constant are internally
01:40 - represented as fixed integer values
01:43 - known as integral constant if we
01:45 - consider our earlier enum
01:47 - the constant small is internally
01:49 - represented as 0 and similarly medium
01:53 - lars and extra layers are represented as
01:55 - 1 2 and 3 respectively
01:58 - let's verify this i'll go back to my
02:00 - code editor here you can see the code
02:02 - from our earlier program now i'll
02:05 - complete this program so i'll add here
02:07 - has include
02:10 - stdio.h
02:13 - and here i'll add
02:16 - int min
02:19 - and inside the curly braces
02:21 - return
02:23 - zero
02:24 - and i'll cut this
02:27 - and i'll put it here
02:31 - so
02:33 - yeah
02:35 - i'll now print this using printf
02:36 - statement
02:38 - and here person d
02:40 - comma
02:42 - su size
02:43 - as we know enum constant are integer
02:46 - values internally so i have used this
02:49 - for person d format specifier
02:52 - now i'll run this
02:53 - as you can see we get three as an output
02:56 - because internally the value of extra
02:58 - large is three
03:00 - now i'll change the value of suicides
03:03 - from extra large to small
03:06 - and
03:07 - and i'll run this again
03:10 - this time we get the output zero
03:13 - by the way do you want to take your
03:15 - programming journey to the next level
03:17 - watching tutorials is fine but it has
03:19 - one limitation it's hard to learn and
03:21 - practice together at the same time lucky
03:23 - for you we recently launched programmies
03:25 - pro that provides tutorials along with
03:27 - quizzes and challenges which will help
03:30 - you practice and test your learning in
03:31 - real time also the course includes
03:34 - projects to give you an experience of
03:36 - how programming works in the real world
03:38 - sign up now visit the link which is also
03:40 - available in the video description below
03:44 - as we saw in our earlier example the
03:46 - default integral values of enum constant
03:49 - starts from 0 so we get value 0 1 2 and
03:53 - 3 for enum constant small medium large
03:56 - and extra large however sometimes it
03:58 - might be necessary to print other values
04:01 - for example the value 0 1 2 and 3 for
04:04 - sizes small medium large and extra large
04:07 - does not make sense instead we might
04:10 - want to print 27 for small 31 for medium
04:14 - 35 for lars and 40 for extra
04:17 - extra lars in such situation we can
04:19 - change the value of integral constant
04:22 - let me show you how i'll go back to my
04:24 - code editor here you can see the
04:26 - code from our earlier example
04:29 - now i'll assign new value
04:31 - to this enum constant so
04:34 - small is equals to 27
04:37 - and medium is equals to
04:40 - 31
04:41 - lars
04:42 - is equals to 35
04:45 - and extra large is equals to 40.
04:49 - now let's create some more variables as
04:51 - well first i'll cut this line of code
04:56 - and
04:57 - now i'll
04:58 - modify this
05:00 - and write here suicides 1
05:03 - is equals to
05:05 - small
05:07 - and similarly i'll write
05:09 - enum
05:11 - size
05:13 - so size
05:15 - 2 is equals to
05:17 - medium
05:20 - and for large and extra layers i'll copy
05:22 - this too
05:24 - and i'll paste it here
05:27 - and i'll change this to size 3
05:30 - and i'll write here
05:33 - large
05:35 - end
05:36 - so size 4
05:40 - is extra large so extra
05:43 - large
05:46 - then i'll print this
05:50 - for that i'll use the same code from our
05:54 - earlier program and i'll copy this and
05:56 - i'll paste it three more times i'll
05:59 - change this
06:02 - from suicides to
06:04 - size 3
06:06 - and this is
06:07 - so size 4.
06:10 - now let me run this code
06:15 - as you can see we get 27 31 35 and 40
06:19 - for the enum constant small medium large
06:22 - and extra large now we are to at the end
06:25 - of this video but before ending the
06:27 - video let me give you a small tip we
06:29 - have been using this format to create
06:32 - enum variable however we can also create
06:35 - enum variables while defining the enum
06:38 - let me show you here suicides is an enum
06:40 - variable and like before it can only
06:43 - store four values
06:45 - now let me run this code
06:47 - now this time we get the expected output
06:51 - okay guys we need your support to keep

07:06 - courses
07:10 - now to revise what you have learned in
07:11 - this program here is a programming task
07:13 - for you create an enum with enum
07:15 - constant sunday monday tuesday wednesday
07:18 - thursday friday and saturday
07:21 - inside the main function create two enum
07:23 - variables named weekend one and weekend
07:25 - two assign values sunday saturday to the
07:28 - variables respectively print the values
07:30 - of the week in one and weekend two
07:32 - you'll find the answer to this question
07:34 - in our github repository and also if you

output because internally the value of extra large is three now i'll change the value of suicides from extra large to small and and i'll run this again this time we get the output zero by the way do
