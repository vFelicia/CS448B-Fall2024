With timestamps:

00:00 - python challenge passing a file in under
00:02 - one minute let's start first import the
00:04 - hash slip module then create a hash file
00:07 - function with parameter filename now
00:09 - create a hash object and open the file
00:11 - for reading in binary mode then run a
00:13 - while loop to read the whole file now
00:15 - read 1024 bytes using read function
00:18 - don't forget to update the hashing
00:20 - function finally return the digest
00:21 - message in hexadecimal format let's find
00:24 - the sh one has of this mp3 file then
00:26 - print the message now run this code you
00:29 - can see this is the sh-1 message digest
00:31 - of the mp35
