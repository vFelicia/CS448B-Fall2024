00:00 - so in this video we are going to talk
00:01 - about the top five programming languages
00:03 - to learn to get a job in 2021. now i've
00:06 - talked about this before
00:07 - and i usually suggest that don't go
00:09 - after programming languages
00:10 - but then there's also this decision of
00:12 - you know why would you
00:13 - start learning a dead-end language or
00:15 - which is not gaining popularity
00:17 - when there's a choice to learn another
00:19 - so it's a difficult
00:21 - question but i can only give you the
00:23 - information that you need to make that
00:25 - decision
00:25 - and here i am with that so the number
00:28 - five programming language to learn in
00:29 - 2021
00:30 - is c-sharp c-sharp was developed by
00:33 - microsoft
00:34 - and it is used for enterprise software
00:35 - development cloud services
00:37 - and game development as well it is very
00:39 - versatile and used
00:41 - but pretty much everywhere where
00:43 - software is built
00:44 - now one metric that helps us choose
00:46 - which programming language is better or
00:47 - popular
00:48 - is the number of job postings on job
00:50 - websites
00:51 - so if you look at indeed then there were
00:53 - 26 000 job openings for c-sharp
00:55 - developers
00:56 - in january 2020 and in the same month
00:59 - there were 19 000
01:00 - openings for c-sharp developers on
01:03 - simply hired that's a staggering 9.3
01:06 - of all software job openings on indeed
01:08 - that's a huge number if you look at the
01:09 - curve of the percentage of job postings
01:11 - that are taken by c-sharp developers in
01:13 - different job websites
01:15 - then you will see that the curve has
01:16 - remained stable and it is going to
01:18 - remain stable for the next few years as
01:20 - well
01:20 - the reason why c-sharp is so popular is
01:23 - because it's stable
01:24 - it's built by microsoft the decisions
01:26 - related to
01:27 - you know the big things about where the
01:29 - programming language is going
01:30 - are done by a single company of course
01:32 - there are other contributors as well
01:34 - but this makes c very stable there are
01:36 - not
01:37 - five frameworks to do the same thing or
01:39 - there are no
01:40 - seven libraries that pretty much do the
01:42 - same thing so
01:44 - there's this coherence of effort and
01:45 - that is why a lot of
01:47 - uh you know there's very much clarity
01:49 - for example if you want to build games
01:50 - in c
01:51 - there's unity if you want to build
01:52 - enterprise softwares there's dotnet so
01:54 - there's a lot of clarity around what
01:56 - needs to be used to build something
01:57 - using c sharp and that's probably one of
01:59 - the reasons why
02:00 - it is considered one of the most stable
02:02 - programming languages out there
02:03 - and it is very popular the next language
02:06 - in the list is c
02:07 - plus c plus plus is an extension of the
02:09 - c programming language
02:10 - with support for object-oriented
02:12 - programming and also support for a lot
02:14 - of
02:15 - control over hardware it is very easy to
02:17 - learn and it is still very popular
02:20 - in fact if you look at the openings on
02:22 - january 2020
02:23 - on indeed there were more than 35 000
02:25 - job openings for c
02:26 - plus plus developers on simply had this
02:28 - number was above 23 000.
02:30 - according to class store the average
02:32 - salary of a c plus developer is 60
02:34 - thousand dollars and according to indeed
02:37 - this number is closer to ninety one
02:39 - thousand dollars
02:40 - ten point seven percentage of all job
02:42 - postings on indeed related to software
02:44 - development
02:45 - where for c plus developers in 2019 and
02:48 - just like c
02:48 - sharp this curve has remained stable for
02:51 - the last five years
02:52 - so c plus plus still is out there now
02:54 - one of the biggest reasons for c plus
02:56 - plus popularity
02:57 - is because you know you can interact
02:59 - with a lot of hardware using it
03:01 - it is very popular with games it is very
03:04 - popular in a lot of uh
03:06 - you know applications that require low
03:08 - level control over memory
03:09 - for instance browsers most of the
03:12 - browsers that you use are made in c
03:13 - plus plus a lot of code that needs to be
03:16 - really performant needs to be written in
03:17 - c
03:18 - plus in fact even so many enterprise
03:21 - applications are written in c
03:22 - plus plus the next language on the list
03:24 - is javascript javascript was
03:26 - initially used for web development on
03:28 - the browser but now it is also used for
03:30 - server side apps
03:31 - and also for mobile app development so
03:33 - it is growing in its use if you look at
03:35 - the number of job postings on glassdoor
03:37 - in january 2020
03:39 - there were 46 000 openings for
03:41 - javascript developers there similarly
03:43 - this number was 51 000 plus for indeed
03:46 - and almost 38 000 for simply hired
03:49 - according to glassdoor
03:50 - a javascript developer makes almost
03:52 - eighty thousand dollars a year
03:54 - and according to indeed that number is
03:56 - closer to hundred thousand dollars
03:58 - so if you look at the numbers 14.5 of
04:01 - all
04:01 - software jobs on indeed way for
04:03 - javascript developers
04:04 - now javascript is popular because of its
04:06 - versatility it was already being used in
04:09 - web development before
04:10 - now with node.js it can also be used to
04:13 - write server-side apps
04:14 - with electron you can also build desktop
04:17 - apps
04:17 - and with technologies like ionic
04:19 - phonegap and
04:20 - react native you can also start building
04:23 - mobile apps using javascript
04:24 - now if you look at the percentage of job
04:26 - postings for javascript in the last five
04:28 - years
04:29 - then you will see that this also has
04:30 - remains stable there is a lot of demand
04:32 - for javascript
04:33 - now this is where i will go a bit away
04:36 - from the curve
04:37 - because uh these curves can be you know
04:40 - these are for uh openings in the us now
04:43 - if you
04:44 - um from my personal experience uh in the
04:47 - developing world
04:48 - javascript is gaining a lot of
04:50 - popularity and
04:51 - i feel that it is one of the programming
04:53 - languages that is growing the fastest
04:54 - today the next language on the list is
04:56 - java
04:57 - java is an object-oriented programming
04:58 - language that has been around for
05:00 - decades
05:01 - it is used for everything from
05:03 - enterprise software development
05:04 - to building large-scale web applications
05:07 - let's look at the number of active job
05:08 - openings for java developers in january
05:11 - 2020.
05:12 - on glassdoor this number was close to 60
05:14 - 000. on indeed
05:15 - this number was 61 000 and on simplified
05:19 - this number was over 40 000. now
05:21 - glassdoor says
05:22 - a typical java developer makes almost 80
05:25 - 000
05:25 - a year in the us similarly this number
05:28 - is more than 107
05:30 - 000 if you ask indeed almost 21
05:34 - of all job openings on indeed in 2019
05:37 - for java developers and this curve of
05:39 - the percentage popularity of java
05:42 - in terms of the number of developers
05:44 - that are required has remained stable
05:46 - for the last five years now the reason
05:47 - why
05:48 - java is so popular is because it is
05:50 - platform independent you
05:52 - any application you write in java can be
05:54 - deployed on linux server on windows
05:56 - server or any other server
05:58 - and this is one of the reasons why big
06:00 - companies especially
06:01 - they like to invest on java they have
06:03 - always done this
06:04 - and they are going to continue to invest
06:06 - in this programming language another
06:07 - reason why java is popular is because of
06:09 - its maturity
06:10 - it's been around for such a long time
06:12 - that the popular
06:14 - frameworks libraries and the ecosystem
06:16 - around java
06:17 - has gotten a lot of in feedback and
06:20 - improvements over time
06:21 - so it is a time tested programming
06:23 - language that has
06:24 - a good ecosystem and that is considered
06:27 - to be reliable by the world's biggest
06:29 - companies
06:30 - now moving on to the last programming
06:31 - language or the number one programming
06:33 - language to learn in 2021
06:34 - you must have guessed it by now it's
06:36 - python python is an interpreted and easy
06:38 - to learn
06:39 - and use programming language that finds
06:41 - use in
06:42 - in almost every field of web development
06:44 - machine learning data science
06:46 - you name it it is also one of the most
06:48 - popular programming language
06:50 - for teaching programming in colleges in
06:52 - the us
06:53 - it is also catching up everywhere else
06:55 - in the world as the first programming
06:56 - language that
06:57 - someone learns if you look at the number
06:58 - of active job openings for python
07:00 - developers on different hiring platforms
07:02 - this number was more than 71 000 on
07:04 - indeed and glassdoor
07:06 - similarly simply had had more than 51
07:08 - 000 job openings for python developers
07:10 - in january of 2020. according to
07:12 - glassdoor
07:13 - the average salary of a python developer
07:15 - in the us is more than 76
07:17 - 000 and this number is approximately 98
07:20 - 000 if you ask india 18 of all job
07:23 - openings on indeed in 2019 were for
07:25 - python developers
07:26 - uh now from 2019 to 2021 i am sure that
07:30 - this number must have increased a lot
07:32 - now why python is so popular uh i'm
07:34 - getting tired of
07:35 - answering this question python is so
07:37 - easy to learn
07:38 - well written python code looks a lot
07:40 - like human readable language
07:41 - and it is very versatile so something
07:44 - that's easy and also versatile
07:46 - and finds its use in so many different
07:48 - fields like machine learning data
07:49 - science web development
07:51 - you name it obviously a lot of
07:53 - programmers are going to be attracted to
07:54 - it
07:54 - and that is the reason why python has
07:56 - become so popular now
07:58 - uh i hope this video did not confuse you
08:00 - because you know all these five
08:02 - programming languages
08:03 - they have i showed you the curves for
08:05 - the demand
08:07 - in terms of job openings in the last
08:08 - five years and they are all very stable
08:11 - it goes on to show that all these five
08:13 - programming languages are very safe in
08:15 - terms of
08:16 - choosing them for your career because
08:18 - they have a lot of demand and consistent
08:20 - demand
08:20 - and there are a lot of open job openings
08:23 - for these programming languages
08:25 - so if you want to be on the safe side
08:27 - then yes it is always better to
08:29 - choose these popular programming
08:30 - languages however also keep
08:32 - an eye on you know domain specific
08:34 - programming languages like
08:36 - rust and go that are really rising they
08:38 - might be in the list pretty much soon
08:40 - all the programming languages i talked
08:42 - about today have a lot of community
08:44 - support
08:45 - great documentation amazing tutorials on
08:47 - the internet and also a rich ecosystem
08:50 - of
08:50 - libraries and frameworks they are very
08:52 - stable and
08:53 - the job openings for these programming
08:55 - languages have remained stable or grown
08:57 - in the last five years
08:58 - and that is why we have included them in
09:00 - this list so if you're choosing any one
09:02 - of these programming languages
09:03 - you can rest assured that there is a job
09:05 - waiting for you
09:06 - but you still need to focus on the
09:08 - basics you need to make your effort
09:10 - to make sure that if you need to learn a
09:12 - new programming language you should not
09:14 - feel that you are starting from scratch
09:15 - focus on the basics focus on the
09:17 - concepts and i'll see you in the next
09:20 - one
09:28 - you

Cleaned transcript:

so in this video we are going to talk about the top five programming languages to learn to get a job in 2021. now i've talked about this before and i usually suggest that don't go after programming languages but then there's also this decision of you know why would you start learning a deadend language or which is not gaining popularity when there's a choice to learn another so it's a difficult question but i can only give you the information that you need to make that decision and here i am with that so the number five programming language to learn in 2021 is csharp csharp was developed by microsoft and it is used for enterprise software development cloud services and game development as well it is very versatile and used but pretty much everywhere where software is built now one metric that helps us choose which programming language is better or popular is the number of job postings on job websites so if you look at indeed then there were 26 000 job openings for csharp developers in january 2020 and in the same month there were 19 000 openings for csharp developers on simply hired that's a staggering 9.3 of all software job openings on indeed that's a huge number if you look at the curve of the percentage of job postings that are taken by csharp developers in different job websites then you will see that the curve has remained stable and it is going to remain stable for the next few years as well the reason why csharp is so popular is because it's stable it's built by microsoft the decisions related to you know the big things about where the programming language is going are done by a single company of course there are other contributors as well but this makes c very stable there are not five frameworks to do the same thing or there are no seven libraries that pretty much do the same thing so there's this coherence of effort and that is why a lot of uh you know there's very much clarity for example if you want to build games in c there's unity if you want to build enterprise softwares there's dotnet so there's a lot of clarity around what needs to be used to build something using c sharp and that's probably one of the reasons why it is considered one of the most stable programming languages out there and it is very popular the next language in the list is c plus c plus plus is an extension of the c programming language with support for objectoriented programming and also support for a lot of control over hardware it is very easy to learn and it is still very popular in fact if you look at the openings on january 2020 on indeed there were more than 35 000 job openings for c plus plus developers on simply had this number was above 23 000. according to class store the average salary of a c plus developer is 60 thousand dollars and according to indeed this number is closer to ninety one thousand dollars ten point seven percentage of all job postings on indeed related to software development where for c plus developers in 2019 and just like c sharp this curve has remained stable for the last five years so c plus plus still is out there now one of the biggest reasons for c plus plus popularity is because you know you can interact with a lot of hardware using it it is very popular with games it is very popular in a lot of uh you know applications that require low level control over memory for instance browsers most of the browsers that you use are made in c plus plus a lot of code that needs to be really performant needs to be written in c plus in fact even so many enterprise applications are written in c plus plus the next language on the list is javascript javascript was initially used for web development on the browser but now it is also used for server side apps and also for mobile app development so it is growing in its use if you look at the number of job postings on glassdoor in january 2020 there were 46 000 openings for javascript developers there similarly this number was 51 000 plus for indeed and almost 38 000 for simply hired according to glassdoor a javascript developer makes almost eighty thousand dollars a year and according to indeed that number is closer to hundred thousand dollars so if you look at the numbers 14.5 of all software jobs on indeed way for javascript developers now javascript is popular because of its versatility it was already being used in web development before now with node.js it can also be used to write serverside apps with electron you can also build desktop apps and with technologies like ionic phonegap and react native you can also start building mobile apps using javascript now if you look at the percentage of job postings for javascript in the last five years then you will see that this also has remains stable there is a lot of demand for javascript now this is where i will go a bit away from the curve because uh these curves can be you know these are for uh openings in the us now if you um from my personal experience uh in the developing world javascript is gaining a lot of popularity and i feel that it is one of the programming languages that is growing the fastest today the next language on the list is java java is an objectoriented programming language that has been around for decades it is used for everything from enterprise software development to building largescale web applications let's look at the number of active job openings for java developers in january 2020. on glassdoor this number was close to 60 000. on indeed this number was 61 000 and on simplified this number was over 40 000. now glassdoor says a typical java developer makes almost 80 000 a year in the us similarly this number is more than 107 000 if you ask indeed almost 21 of all job openings on indeed in 2019 for java developers and this curve of the percentage popularity of java in terms of the number of developers that are required has remained stable for the last five years now the reason why java is so popular is because it is platform independent you any application you write in java can be deployed on linux server on windows server or any other server and this is one of the reasons why big companies especially they like to invest on java they have always done this and they are going to continue to invest in this programming language another reason why java is popular is because of its maturity it's been around for such a long time that the popular frameworks libraries and the ecosystem around java has gotten a lot of in feedback and improvements over time so it is a time tested programming language that has a good ecosystem and that is considered to be reliable by the world's biggest companies now moving on to the last programming language or the number one programming language to learn in 2021 you must have guessed it by now it's python python is an interpreted and easy to learn and use programming language that finds use in in almost every field of web development machine learning data science you name it it is also one of the most popular programming language for teaching programming in colleges in the us it is also catching up everywhere else in the world as the first programming language that someone learns if you look at the number of active job openings for python developers on different hiring platforms this number was more than 71 000 on indeed and glassdoor similarly simply had had more than 51 000 job openings for python developers in january of 2020. according to glassdoor the average salary of a python developer in the us is more than 76 000 and this number is approximately 98 000 if you ask india 18 of all job openings on indeed in 2019 were for python developers uh now from 2019 to 2021 i am sure that this number must have increased a lot now why python is so popular uh i'm getting tired of answering this question python is so easy to learn well written python code looks a lot like human readable language and it is very versatile so something that's easy and also versatile and finds its use in so many different fields like machine learning data science web development you name it obviously a lot of programmers are going to be attracted to it and that is the

a lot of demand and consistent demand and there are a lot of open job openings for these programming languages so if you want to be on the safe side then yes it is always better to choose these popular programming languages however also keep an eye on you know domain specific programming languages like rust and go that are really rising they might be in the list pretty much soon all the programming languages i talked about today have a lot of community support great documentation amazing tutorials on the internet and also a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks they are very stable and the job openings for these programming languages have remained stable or grown in the last five years and that is why we have included them in this list so if you're choosing any one of these programming languages you can rest assured that there is a job waiting for you but you still need to focus on the basics you need to make your effort to make sure that if you need to learn a new programming language you should not feel that you are starting from scratch focus on the basics focus on the concepts and i'll see you in the next one you
