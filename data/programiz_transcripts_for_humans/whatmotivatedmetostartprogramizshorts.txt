00:18 - need with which i struggled with myself
00:19 - i still remember
00:20 - there was this one exam of data
00:23 - structures and algorithms and
00:25 - there was this heap sort algorithm that
00:28 - i was struggling with
00:30 - and then i saw this one youtube video
00:31 - where you know it was explained so
00:33 - beautifully
00:34 - um i i watched that video and i excelled
00:37 - in that exam
00:38 - and and even now you know i'm teaching
00:40 - data structures and algorithms on
00:41 - programming
00:42 - through text content that we write lack
00:43 - of content is something that
00:45 - you know is it's something that troubles
00:46 - me and i i
00:48 - because i've personally gone through the
