00:00 - merry christmas everyone today is a very
00:02 - special day because we are doing the
00:03 - first session of our ask programs qa
00:05 - session
00:06 - there were so many questions that we
00:07 - have had to break this video into two
00:09 - parts
00:10 - this is the first part and the second
00:11 - part will come soon
00:13 - so the first question is from youtube
00:16 - and the question is by govinda
00:20 - he asks you only publish one or two
00:22 - videos a week
00:23 - why is that now we obviously want to
00:26 - publish more and
00:27 - more frequently and faster but again
00:29 - creating this content designing the
00:31 - course and shooting the video and then
00:34 - editing the videos takes a lot of time
00:36 - we are very tiny team of people working
00:38 - hard to make sure that this content is
00:40 - the top-notch content that will
00:42 - be useful years and years down the line
00:44 - so
00:45 - as much as we want to publish more
00:47 - videos it does take time so
00:49 - we are trying to speed it up but i can't
00:51 - promise anything right now so for now
00:53 - we'll stick with two videos a week
00:55 - but feedback taken yes we are trying
00:57 - harder
00:58 - so the next question is two related
01:00 - questions so lord and matal
01:02 - asks is there going to be a java app and
01:04 - video
01:05 - and we also have a similar question on
01:07 - instagram that says
01:08 - will you be making a video series on c
01:12 - plus now we are very happy with the
01:15 - response we've got
01:16 - both from python and c apps and the
01:19 - python video series
01:20 - and obviously we want to create these
01:22 - series on c plus and java and all of the
01:24 - programming languages
01:25 - but again it's a very challenging task
01:27 - to create new apps and new videos
01:30 - but definitely those are in the pipeline
01:33 - we will
01:33 - eventually go to these videos and these
01:36 - apps as well
01:36 - but these might take a little bit of
01:38 - time so the next question is
01:41 - uh love the content as usual are you
01:44 - indian
01:45 - now uh i do look indian but no i'm
01:49 - i'm nepali my so nepal is a country that
01:52 - borders india
01:53 - having said that i have done my
01:55 - bachelor's in engineering from an indian
01:57 - college called
01:58 - national institute of technology or nit
02:00 - kurukshetra
02:01 - i also did my first job in hyderabad in
02:03 - india
02:04 - and i also worked at a company in noida
02:07 - so
02:08 - i have a lot of friends in india and
02:10 - it's a country that i really love and
02:12 - visit from time to time so yes uh you
02:15 - know i have a rich relationship with
02:16 - india but uh i am a nepali and our whole
02:19 - team is in nepal and we are very proud
02:21 - to
02:22 - bring this world-class content from
02:24 - nepal to the world
02:25 - so next question is how to find my area
02:28 - of interest as a first year student
02:31 - now this is a great question because
02:33 - even you know i can completely relate
02:35 - when i was in first year of college i
02:37 - was also very perplexed
02:39 - about because there's such a wide range
02:41 - of subjects that are being taught even
02:43 - you know physics chemistry
02:44 - and organization behavior and economics
02:47 - and all these subjects
02:48 - so it can be really confusing you can
02:49 - feel you know okay
02:51 - i did not sign up for this i signed up
02:53 - for coding and why are they teaching me
02:55 - these subjects
02:56 - and later on i realized that uh you know
02:59 - that there was a purpose to
03:00 - being so broad in first year because uh
03:04 - if you're going to be a computer
03:05 - programmer you are going to be building
03:07 - software for some field you know it can
03:08 - be
03:10 - some economic theory or you could be
03:11 - simulating some economic theory or you
03:13 - could be
03:14 - writing calculus equations discretizing
03:16 - equations
03:18 - for some simulation so whatever it is
03:20 - you know you will be working with some
03:22 - domain
03:22 - and it's always good to have a little
03:24 - bit of domain knowledge
03:26 - on all fields and that is why it can be
03:28 - really confusing in the first year
03:29 - but as you go to second year third year
03:32 - or whatever you know how many years you
03:33 - have in your degree
03:34 - things will become clearer and i hope
03:36 - that if you keep on experimenting
03:38 - if you keep on building projects you
03:40 - will find that one project that really
03:42 - moves you and
03:43 - and that you know sets the tune and that
03:45 - that makes you feel that
03:46 - yes this is what i want to do in my
03:48 - career and
03:50 - you will find that you know it was for
03:51 - me i remember that moment
03:54 - was when we had an assignment on
03:56 - object-oriented programming and i and my
03:58 - friend
03:59 - spent two or three hours continuously on
04:01 - one problem we googled we searched for
04:04 - solutions and then we devised our own
04:06 - solution and that was the moment where i
04:07 - felt that
04:08 - you know okay coding is for me or this
04:10 - is what i want to do
04:11 - so you will definitely have that moment
04:13 - but you will need to keep on putting
04:14 - that effort and building projects
04:17 - another question is i am passing 12th
04:19 - this year what course should i take or
04:21 - which exam do i
04:22 - have to take for becoming a professional
04:24 - software developer
04:25 - now there's plenty of options the most
04:28 - common
04:29 - answer would be a computer science
04:31 - degree in bachelors
04:33 - so you know find out which college
04:36 - offers
04:37 - bachelor's degree in computer science in
04:38 - your field but i would also suggest
04:41 - finding mentors who you know in your
04:43 - family or friends circle who are
04:44 - computer engineers or software
04:46 - developers
04:47 - and asking them you know how they got to
04:49 - the to that point in the career
04:51 - if you are trying to apply for another
04:53 - country then find
04:54 - mentors in in that country as well so
04:57 - why am i focusing on mentors rather than
04:59 - online research is
05:01 - yes you will find a lot of details
05:02 - online you could say you know because
05:04 - the same degree can be called different
05:06 - names in different countries so in
05:08 - india a typical bachelor's degree in
05:11 - computer science is called
05:12 - b tech in computer engineering or
05:14 - bachelor of engineering with computer
05:15 - science
05:16 - so there's so many different names and
05:18 - it can be confusing because there's also
05:20 - these other subjects like bsc
05:21 - csit which means computer science and
05:24 - i.t
05:25 - bachelor of science in computer science
05:27 - so there's all these confusing names and
05:29 - it's always good to find a mentor who
05:31 - will clear it out for your country so
05:32 - the answer would be
05:34 - you know i can't really give you a
05:35 - concrete answer because it really
05:36 - depends on the country in which you are
05:38 - if you're interested you can also start
05:40 - self learning there's a lot of content
05:42 - out there there's youtube videos there's
05:44 - articles there's
05:44 - apps so our learn python app is a good
05:48 - starting point for beginners
05:49 - speaking of which we are offering a 50
05:52 - sale
05:53 - for the holidays on our pro subscription
05:56 - so
05:56 - the sale will last till new year and if
05:58 - you get the pro subscription
06:00 - then you can also get a certificate at
06:02 - the end of the course
06:03 - now if you purchase the course it also
06:05 - helps us
06:06 - create more quality content like this so
06:08 - if you support our work
06:09 - then definitely you can purchase the app
06:11 - uh i've shared the link in the
06:13 - description below
06:14 - so the next question is from instagram
06:17 - someone says i want to learn android i'm
06:18 - good at c
06:19 - plus plus but don't know java so can i
06:21 - start android now
06:23 - definitely if you know c plus plus
06:25 - because java is also an object-oriented
06:26 - programming language
06:28 - a lot of the concepts in java will sound
06:30 - familiar to you
06:31 - also there's a lot of good documentation
06:34 - on how to build
06:35 - android apps using java because that was
06:37 - how initially all pro
06:38 - android apps were built now having said
06:41 - that
06:42 - uh there's also other options like
06:44 - flutter for mobile app development in
06:46 - fact
06:46 - our learn python and learnc apps are
06:48 - also built on flutter
06:50 - so you might also want to explore these
06:51 - more modern platforms as well
06:53 - because they will allow you to build not
06:55 - only android apps but also ios and other
06:57 - platforms
06:58 - now the next question i'm moving on is
07:01 - can you please also start
07:03 - making project based videos that include
07:04 - small and big projects
07:06 - by erno academy on youtube we will
07:08 - definitely take a
07:09 - suggestion into consideration in fact
07:11 - this is something that is already in the
07:13 - pipeline so we are planning to make
07:14 - project based videos in the near future
07:16 - watch out and subscribe to our channel
07:18 - so that you get to know when that
07:19 - starts happening now the next question
07:23 - is related to competitive programming so
07:25 - first question
07:26 - about that is i use rather asked on
07:28 - youtube how to start studying for
07:30 - competitive programming
07:31 - and avantika says is it okay to make
07:34 - mistakes
07:35 - in the beginning when you're starting
07:36 - out with competitive programming
07:38 - now i have similar answers for both
07:40 - these questions
07:42 - how to start competitive programming
07:44 - just jump into it because
07:46 - there's a lot of platforms out there
07:47 - that help you build you know start your
07:49 - competitive programming journey
07:50 - if you feel that uh and and you know you
07:52 - don't have to be an expert to start
07:54 - competitive programming
07:55 - so just apply uh you know sign up on
07:58 - these
07:58 - uh competitive program platforms like
08:00 - code forces hacker rank
08:02 - and uh code chef and you know just
08:05 - start as a beginner start solving
08:07 - beginner level questions and
08:08 - slowly upgrade yourself to the more
08:10 - difficult and more challenging problems
08:12 - you will definitely get there it's not
08:14 - too hard now
08:16 - in terms of making mistakes if you see a
08:18 - baby
08:19 - trying to walk then you will see that
08:20 - they make a lot of mistakes it's very
08:22 - similar when you're starting out with
08:23 - programming or especially with
08:25 - competitive programming
08:26 - you will definitely make a lot of
08:27 - mistakes but always remember that as you
08:29 - learn to work
08:30 - as you learn more and more concepts you
08:33 - will stop making those mistakes again
08:34 - and again
08:35 - and you will be more focused on the
08:37 - algorithm rather than the syntax
08:39 - so that will be a nice jump and
08:41 - definitely don't worry if you're making
08:42 - a lot of mistakes
08:44 - those mistakes will go away once you
08:45 - become more and more
08:47 - comfortable with the syntax and the
08:48 - patterns that come up regularly in
08:50 - competitive programming
08:52 - the next question is also related to
08:53 - competitive programming so
08:55 - uh muhammad tamim sarwar nishoom ask
08:58 - from bangladesh
08:59 - sir i am from bangladesh my age is 12
09:02 - and i'm learning coding from one year
09:03 - wow congratulations
09:05 - so i know a bit of python c c plus plus
09:07 - and html
09:08 - i want to get involved in computer
09:10 - programming but there is no good
09:11 - competitive programming sites for my age
09:13 - coders
09:14 - if there is any sight for me please tell
09:16 - me so
09:18 - uh mohammed tamim you've actually found
09:20 - yourself a gap in the market
09:22 - and who knows you know you could be
09:24 - building that platform that you
09:26 - see that there's not in the market and
09:28 - definitely you
09:29 - you have asked a very valid question you
09:31 - know
09:32 - are we building any competitive
09:33 - programming sites especially for
09:35 - beginners who are starting out and who
09:37 - are of a younger
09:39 - demographic than average coders and this
09:41 - is the direction that the world is going
09:42 - in so
09:43 - definitely i i don't see any competitive
09:46 - platform that is specifically
09:48 - designed for uh kids of your age
09:51 - but again you know you can go to the
09:54 - existing competitive platforms
09:56 - and make sure that you do only the ones
09:59 - that you can handle
10:00 - and i would love to see a competitive
10:02 - programming platform
10:04 - you know customize themselves for your
10:06 - use case
10:08 - now the next questions are a bit related
10:10 - uh
10:11 - so one question somehow guy asks i'm a
10:14 - beginner what programming language
10:15 - should i learn first
10:17 - and ashish asks love the videos would
10:19 - programming help us branch to
10:21 - other i.t related fields now
10:25 - the first question which programming
10:27 - language should i learn
10:28 - is is a tricky one because you know
10:30 - every programming language
10:32 - has some use in some field so it's
10:34 - really hard to
10:35 - see that one programming language is
10:36 - better than the other however
10:38 - the typical answers which are c and
10:41 - python and javascript
10:42 - i would definitely recommend python
10:44 - because it has a very simple
10:46 - and you know fluid syntax for beginners
10:48 - that that is easy to
10:50 - get started with uh programming and then
10:53 - you know i i always suggest don't learn
10:55 - just one programming language
10:57 - start with one master it go to another
10:59 - try another because
11:01 - once you learn two or three programming
11:02 - languages you will be able to better
11:05 - decide
11:05 - which is the better programming language
11:07 - for the project you're going to do
11:08 - so i always encourage experimentation
11:11 - but again if you're starting out
11:13 - i would recommend a programming language
11:14 - like c or python or javascript
11:17 - moving to the second part of the
11:18 - question definitely you know learning
11:20 - programming will
11:21 - help you branch out into uh different id
11:24 - fields
11:24 - so i myself started as a software
11:26 - developer and when i
11:28 - started i did not know which field i
11:29 - would specialize in
11:31 - as i started doing professional and
11:33 - personal projects
11:34 - i realized that i was really interested
11:36 - in web development
11:37 - and that is why i built my expertise
11:39 - around python and javascript
11:40 - but yours could be a different case you
11:43 - know you might start out with a software
11:44 - developer
11:45 - and then realize that artificial
11:47 - intelligence is the field that excites
11:49 - me the most or internet of things i like
11:50 - robotics i like
11:52 - combining hardware and software so maybe
11:54 - internet of things or maybe you could
11:56 - want to go into cloud computing or you
11:58 - might want to
11:59 - do some other field you know you might
12:01 - want to combine
12:02 - an economic theory with some computer
12:04 - simulation and
12:06 - you might want to do all sorts of things
12:08 - so it really
12:09 - it's an exploration that you start and
12:11 - then you will find your calling
12:12 - automatically so don't really
12:14 - need to worry too much about that just
12:16 - start with coding and slowly you will
12:18 - find
12:18 - what interests you more and i suggest
12:20 - that you experiment a bit
12:22 - instead of going for just one field or
12:24 - deciding on one field
12:25 - because when you're just starting out
12:27 - it's things are not very clear
12:29 - and you will find your passion
12:30 - eventually now
12:32 - the next question is sandeep kudupudi
12:36 - asks on youtube is fulltech full stack
12:39 - developer
12:40 - simple to learn for freshers so
12:43 - basically a full stack developer is a
12:44 - developer who knows
12:46 - a lot of things about software
12:48 - development
12:49 - they can do back-end work they can do
12:50 - front-end work they can also deploy
12:52 - code to a server so full-stack
12:56 - development is not for everyone
12:58 - because you know full-stack developer
12:59 - has to be very flexible with what they
13:01 - want
13:01 - now the world there's a lot of demand
13:03 - for full stack developers these days and
13:05 - a lot of people
13:06 - are switching to full stack development
13:08 - however i would suggest not to start
13:10 - with full stack development immediately
13:12 - if you're just beginning first start
13:15 - with either front end or back end or you
13:17 - know start
13:18 - coding competitive programming start
13:20 - just one thing
13:21 - and eventually you if you feel that you
13:24 - know this flexibility of
13:26 - doing back-end work on one day front-end
13:27 - work on another day deploying code to
13:29 - the server or another day
13:31 - if this flexibility is what you want
13:33 - then definitely full stack developer is
13:35 - a good choice
13:35 - but if you're the kind of person who
13:37 - likes specializing and you if you say i
13:39 - want to be a machine learning
13:40 - developer or if i want to be a data
13:43 - scientist
13:44 - then you know you might not want to be a
13:46 - full stack developer so it really
13:47 - depends on what is your calling and what
13:49 - interests you more and what is
13:51 - the demand in the market and that really
13:53 - depends on where you live and what is
13:55 - the demand in the market in that place
13:57 - as well so
13:59 - start exploring if you're just learning
14:01 - to code then again
14:02 - don't you know decide on one field
14:04 - experiment with everything build
14:06 - projects related data science machine
14:07 - learning
14:08 - build a mobile app build a game build a
14:11 - web app try everything and
14:12 - eventually you'll find one field that
14:14 - you really you know that really
14:16 - excites you so let's see what's next
14:20 - so the next question is does your neck
14:22 - hurt
14:23 - toefl sad gmat wants to know on youtube
14:27 - i know i move my neck a lot while making
14:30 - the videos
14:31 - but that's just a habit and no my neck
14:34 - doesn't hurt it's totally fine
14:35 - and i hope you don't make a meme out of
14:38 - this
14:39 - fingers crossed so the last question
14:43 - is your website is beautiful how did you
14:46 - create it
14:47 - now you can go to a website called
14:49 - archive.org and look at the
14:51 - first version of program is when it was
14:52 - launched in you know 2012 or 2011 2012
14:56 - and you will see that it's not as
14:57 - beautiful as it is today in fact
14:59 - look at the initial version of uh
15:02 - any website you know the big websites
15:04 - that you see and you inspire
15:06 - you're inspired by and you will see that
15:08 - they started out as ugly pieces of
15:10 - design and that's that's the process
15:13 - of uh you know building anything
15:15 - innovative you start with something
15:17 - something simple and you keep on
15:19 - improving the design however
15:21 - in in the last few months you must have
15:23 - noticed that
15:24 - program has got a complete design
15:26 - overall that was because we spent
15:28 - many months looking at the design from
15:31 - scratch from usability perspective
15:33 - and really looking at what problems does
15:35 - our website solve for beginners
15:37 - so really putting the beginner
15:38 - programmer in in my at the top of the
15:40 - mind
15:41 - we really invested a lot of
15:45 - energy time and energy into building a
15:46 - beautiful website kudos to siri sikrakar
15:49 - who is
15:49 - our designer he's built i mean he's done
15:51 - amazing work for us
15:53 - and if you see any perfect looking
15:55 - product you know
15:56 - any beautiful project product you always
15:58 - have to remember that there's some
16:00 - people around it some people behind it
16:02 - who have built it
16:03 - so yes the program is product is
16:06 - beautiful i i love it myself the current
16:08 - design
16:09 - is really easy to use and it's because
16:12 - we spend a lot of time building it and
16:14 - if you're looking for more technical
16:15 - details so our website is built on
16:17 - drupal
16:18 - and we love drupal it's it's what
16:21 - program is was
16:22 - built ten eight years ago on so it's the

Cleaned transcript:

merry christmas everyone today is a very special day because we are doing the first session of our ask programs qa session there were so many questions that we have had to break this video into two parts this is the first part and the second part will come soon so the first question is from youtube and the question is by govinda he asks you only publish one or two videos a week why is that now we obviously want to publish more and more frequently and faster but again creating this content designing the course and shooting the video and then editing the videos takes a lot of time we are very tiny team of people working hard to make sure that this content is the topnotch content that will be useful years and years down the line so as much as we want to publish more videos it does take time so we are trying to speed it up but i can't promise anything right now so for now we'll stick with two videos a week but feedback taken yes we are trying harder so the next question is two related questions so lord and matal asks is there going to be a java app and video and we also have a similar question on instagram that says will you be making a video series on c plus now we are very happy with the response we've got both from python and c apps and the python video series and obviously we want to create these series on c plus and java and all of the programming languages but again it's a very challenging task to create new apps and new videos but definitely those are in the pipeline we will eventually go to these videos and these apps as well but these might take a little bit of time so the next question is uh love the content as usual are you indian now uh i do look indian but no i'm i'm nepali my so nepal is a country that borders india having said that i have done my bachelor's in engineering from an indian college called national institute of technology or nit kurukshetra i also did my first job in hyderabad in india and i also worked at a company in noida so i have a lot of friends in india and it's a country that i really love and visit from time to time so yes uh you know i have a rich relationship with india but uh i am a nepali and our whole team is in nepal and we are very proud to bring this worldclass content from nepal to the world so next question is how to find my area of interest as a first year student now this is a great question because even you know i can completely relate when i was in first year of college i was also very perplexed about because there's such a wide range of subjects that are being taught even you know physics chemistry and organization behavior and economics and all these subjects so it can be really confusing you can feel you know okay i did not sign up for this i signed up for coding and why are they teaching me these subjects and later on i realized that uh you know that there was a purpose to being so broad in first year because uh if you're going to be a computer programmer you are going to be building software for some field you know it can be some economic theory or you could be simulating some economic theory or you could be writing calculus equations discretizing equations for some simulation so whatever it is you know you will be working with some domain and it's always good to have a little bit of domain knowledge on all fields and that is why it can be really confusing in the first year but as you go to second year third year or whatever you know how many years you have in your degree things will become clearer and i hope that if you keep on experimenting if you keep on building projects you will find that one project that really moves you and and that you know sets the tune and that that makes you feel that yes this is what i want to do in my career and you will find that you know it was for me i remember that moment was when we had an assignment on objectoriented programming and i and my friend spent two or three hours continuously on one problem we googled we searched for solutions and then we devised our own solution and that was the moment where i felt that you know okay coding is for me or this is what i want to do so you will definitely have that moment but you will need to keep on putting that effort and building projects another question is i am passing 12th this year what course should i take or which exam do i have to take for becoming a professional software developer now there's plenty of options the most common answer would be a computer science degree in bachelors so you know find out which college offers bachelor's degree in computer science in your field but i would also suggest finding mentors who you know in your family or friends circle who are computer engineers or software developers and asking them you know how they got to the to that point in the career if you are trying to apply for another country then find mentors in in that country as well so why am i focusing on mentors rather than online research is yes you will find a lot of details online you could say you know because the same degree can be called different names in different countries so in india a typical bachelor's degree in computer science is called b tech in computer engineering or bachelor of engineering with computer science so there's so many different names and it can be confusing because there's also these other subjects like bsc csit which means computer science and i.t bachelor of science in computer science so there's all these confusing names and it's always good to find a mentor who will clear it out for your country so the answer would be you know i can't really give you a concrete answer because it really depends on the country in which you are if you're interested you can also start self learning there's a lot of content out there there's youtube videos there's articles there's apps so our learn python app is a good starting point for beginners speaking of which we are offering a 50 sale for the holidays on our pro subscription so the sale will last till new year and if you get the pro subscription then you can also get a certificate at the end of the course now if you purchase the course it also helps us create more quality content like this so if you support our work then definitely you can purchase the app uh i've shared the link in the description below so the next question is from instagram someone says i want to learn android i'm good at c plus plus but don't know java so can i start android now definitely if you know c plus plus because java is also an objectoriented programming language a lot of the concepts in java will sound familiar to you also there's a lot of good documentation on how to build android apps using java because that was how initially all pro android apps were built now having said that uh there's also other options like flutter for mobile app development in fact our learn python and learnc apps are also built on flutter so you might also want to explore these more modern platforms as well because they will allow you to build not only android apps but also ios and other platforms now the next question i'm moving on is can you please also start making project based videos that include small and big projects by erno academy on youtube we will definitely take a suggestion into consideration in fact this is something that is already in the pipeline so we are planning to make project based videos in the near future watch out and subscribe to our channel so that you get to know when that starts happening now the next question is related to competitive programming so first question about that is i use rather asked on youtube how to start studying for competitive programming and avantika says is it okay to make mistakes in the beginning when you're starting out with competitive programming now i have similar answers for both these questions how to start competitive programming just jump into it because there's a lot of platforms out there that help you build you know start your competitive programming journey if you feel that uh and and you know you don't have to be an expert to start competitive programming so just apply uh you know sign up on these uh competitive program platforms like code forces hacker rank and uh code chef and you know just start as a beginner start solving beginner level questions and slowly upgrade yourself to the more difficult and more challenging problems you will definitely get there it's not too hard now in terms of making mistakes if you see a baby trying to walk then you will see that they make a lot of mistakes it's very similar when you're starting out with programming or especially with competitive programming you will definitely make a lot of mistakes but always remember that as you learn to work as you learn more and more concepts you will stop making those mistakes again and again and you will be more focused on the algorithm rather than the syntax so that will be a nice jump and definitely don't worry if you're making a lot of mistakes those mistakes will go away once you become more and more comfortable with the syntax and the patterns that come up regularly in competitive programming the next question is also related to competitive programming so uh muhammad tamim sarwar nishoom ask from bangladesh sir i am from bangladesh my age is 12 and i'm learning coding from one year wow congratulations so i know a bit of python c c plus plus and html i want to get involved in computer programming but there is no good competitive programming sites for my age coders if there is any sight for me please tell me so uh mohammed tamim you've actually found yourself a gap in the market and who knows you know you could be building that platform that you see that there's not in the market and definitely you you have asked a very valid question you know are we building any competitive programming sites especially for beginners who are starting out and who are of a younger demographic than average coders and this is the direction that the world is going in so definitely i i don't see any competitive platform that is specifically designed for uh kids of your age but again you know you can go to the existing competitive platforms and make sure that you do only the ones that you can handle and i would love to see a competitive programming platform you know customize themselves for your use case now the next questions are a bit related uh so one question somehow guy asks i'm a beginner what programming language should i learn first and ashish asks love the videos would programming help us branch to other i.t related fields now the first question which programming language should i learn is is a tricky one because you know every programming language has some use in some field so it's really hard to see that one programming language is better than the other however the typical answers which are c and python and javascript i would definitely recommend python because it has a very simple and you know fluid syntax for beginners that that is easy to get started with uh programming and then you know i i always suggest don't learn just one programming language start with one master it go to another try another because once you learn two or three programming languages you will be able to better decide which is the better programming language for the project you're going to do so i always encourage experimentation but again if you're starting out i would recommend a programming language like c or python or javascript moving to the second part of the question definitely you know learning programming will help you branch out into uh different id fields so i myself started as a software developer and when i started i did not know which field i would specialize in as i started doing professional and personal projects i realized that i was really interested in web development and that is why i built my expertise around python and javascript but yours could be a different case you know you might start out with a software developer and then realize that artificial intelligence is the field that excites me the most or internet of things i like robotics i like combining hardware and software so maybe internet of things or maybe you could want to go into cloud computing or you might want to do some other field you know you might want to combine an economic theory with some computer simulation and you might want to do all sorts of things so it really it's an exploration that you start and then you will find your calling automatically so don't really need to worry too much about that just start with coding and slowly you will find what interests you more and i suggest that you experiment a bit instead of going for just one field or deciding on one field because when you're just starting out it's things are not very clear and you will find your passion eventually now the next question is sandeep kudupudi asks on youtube is fulltech full stack developer simple to learn for freshers so basically a full stack developer is a developer who knows a lot of things about software development they can do backend work they can do frontend work they can also deploy code to a server so fullstack development is not for everyone because you know fullstack developer has to be very flexible with what they want now the world there's a lot of demand for full stack developers these days and a lot of people are switching to full stack development however i would suggest not to start with full stack development immediately if you're just beginning first start with either front end or back end or you know start coding competitive programming start just one thing and eventually you if you feel that you know this flexibility of doing backend work on one day frontend work on another day deploying code to the server or another day if this flexibility is what you want then definitely full stack developer is a good choice but if you're the kind of person who likes specializing and you if you say i want to be a machine learning developer or if i want to be a data scientist then you know you might not want to be a full stack developer so it really depends on what is your calling and what interests you more and what is the demand in the market and that really depends on where you live and what is the demand in the market in that place as well so start exploring if you're just learning to code then again don't you know decide on one field experiment with everything build projects related data science machine learning build a mobile app build a game build a web app try everything and eventually you'll find one field that you really you know that really excites you so let's see what's next so the next question is does your neck hurt toefl sad gmat wants to know on youtube i know i move my neck a lot while making the videos but that's just a habit and no my neck doesn't hurt it's totally fine and i hope you don't make a meme out of this fingers crossed so the last question is your website is beautiful how did you create it now you can go to a website called archive.org and look at the first version of program is when it was launched in you know 2012 or 2011 2012 and you will see that it's not as beautiful as it is today in fact look at the initial version of uh any website you know the big websites that you see and you inspire you're inspired by and you will see that they started out as ugly pieces of design and that's that's the process of uh you know building anything innovative you start with something something simple and you keep on improving the design however in in the last few months you must have noticed that program has got a complete design overall that was because we spent many months looking at the design from scratch from usability perspective and really looking at what problems does our website solve for beginners so really putting the beginner programmer in in my at the top of the mind we really invested a lot of energy time and energy into building a beautiful website kudos to siri sikrakar who is our designer he's built i mean he's done amazing work for us and if you see any perfect looking product you know any beautiful project product you always have to remember that there's some people around it some people behind it who have built it so yes the program is product is beautiful i i love it myself the current design is really easy to use and it's because we spend a lot of time building it and if you're looking for more technical details so our website is built on drupal and we love drupal it's it's what program is was built ten eight years ago on so it's the same platform but we've upgraded it a lot that's it for this video i hope you enjoyed it as much as i did now as i mentioned before we could not cover all the questions that you asked so we are definitely going to do part two of this ask programming session again if you want to be notified of when that video gets released hit the subscribe button and hit that bell icon so that you get notified when that video comes out stay curious and i'll see you in the next one you
