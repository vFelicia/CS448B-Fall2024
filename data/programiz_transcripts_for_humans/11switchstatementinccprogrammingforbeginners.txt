00:00 - hey guys this is me padma from
00:01 - programmies and welcome back to this
00:03 - series nc programming in this video
00:05 - we'll learn about the switch statement
00:07 - and how to use it to make decision
00:09 - making programs in c programming here we
00:11 - will also create a calculator using
00:13 - switch statement so let's get started
00:19 - before we learn about switch statement
00:21 - let's consider a scenario we are given a
00:24 - number between 1 to 7 and based on the
00:26 - number we have to print the day of a
00:28 - week for example if the number is 1 then
00:31 - the day is sunday and if the number is 2
00:33 - then the day is monday and so on now we
00:36 - can use the ifall statement for this
00:38 - however for every number there should be
00:40 - a separate condition this will make our
00:42 - program look messy and difficult to
00:44 - understand for such type of problems
00:46 - where we have to choose from multiple
00:48 - options a better approach will be switch
00:50 - statement let's start with the syntax of
00:52 - the switch statement first
00:54 - the switch statement starts with the
00:56 - switch keyword followed by the variable
00:58 - or expression inside the parenthesis
01:01 - inside the switch statement we can
01:03 - create multiple cases
01:05 - and each cases will have its own value
01:08 - now the value of variable or expression
01:10 - is compared with the value of individual
01:13 - cases
01:14 - if the result of the variable or
01:15 - expression is equals to value 1 then the
01:18 - body of case 1 is executed
01:21 - similarly if the result is value 2 then
01:23 - the body of case 2 is executed and so on
01:27 - however if the result does not match any
01:29 - case then the body of default is
01:32 - executed
01:33 - now let's get back to our original
01:35 - problem of finding the days of the week
01:38 - on the screen you can see the basic c
01:39 - program now i'll create a variable
01:42 - number
01:44 - int
01:45 - number
01:47 - then i'll ask the user to enter number
01:49 - between one to seven so i'll use printf
01:52 - statement and i'll print the message
01:54 - like
01:55 - enter
01:56 - the number
01:58 - between
02:00 - 1 to 7
02:04 - and store the value to the number
02:05 - variable so scanf site quotation percent
02:10 - d
02:10 - comma ampersand name of the variable
02:13 - that is number
02:17 - then i'll create the switch statement
02:18 - that will print the day of the week as
02:21 - we have already discussed we'll use
02:23 - switch keyword
02:25 - and then inside parentheses we'll put
02:28 - variable or expression in this case we
02:30 - have variable number so i'll put number
02:32 - here
02:34 - then a curly braces
02:38 - inside this curly braces will add cases
02:42 - so when the case is won
02:45 - i'll print sunday
02:51 - and i'll use break statement after that
02:53 - i'll talk about this break statement
02:55 - later on the video so let's continue
02:57 - when the case is 2
03:00 - i'll print monday
03:04 - so
03:04 - monday
03:09 - and break statement
03:13 - so what i will do is i'll copy this and
03:15 - paste this five more times
03:21 - and at the end i'll put default
03:25 - and i'll print
03:27 - invalid number
03:28 - invalid number
03:33 - so invalid number
03:36 - now the case 1 and case 2 is already
03:38 - done
03:39 - so i'll edit from case 3
03:42 - and case 3 is
03:44 - tuesday
03:47 - similarly case
03:48 - 4
03:49 - is
03:50 - wednesday
03:55 - and case 5
03:57 - is thursday
03:59 - so we'll write
04:01 - thursday here
04:04 - then
04:06 - case 6 is friday
04:11 - and finally case 7
04:14 - is saturday
04:19 - so let's make this as capital
04:22 - so here i have included cases from case
04:25 - 1 to k7 and if the user input 1 then
04:30 - this part of code is executed and sunday
04:34 - will be printed on the screen
04:36 - and if the user input 2 then this part
04:38 - of code will be executed and monday will
04:40 - be printed on the screen however if the
04:43 - user input any number except 1 to 7
04:46 - then the code inside default will be
04:48 - executed and invalid number is printed
04:51 - on the screen now let me run this
04:53 - program
04:54 - i'll enter five
04:58 - now the input value five matched this
05:00 - case case number five and thursday is
05:03 - printed on the screen
05:06 - now let me run this code again this time
05:08 - i'll enter six
05:11 - as expected we get friday as output
05:15 - now once again i'll run this code and
05:17 - this time
05:18 - i'll enter the number that does not lies
05:20 - between one to seven so i'll enter 9
05:24 - and as you can see i got the output
05:27 - invalid number which is present inside
05:30 - the default
05:31 - here the default case is optional we can
05:34 - remove this if we are sure that the
05:35 - input value matches one of the cases go
05:38 - ahead and remove the default value and
05:40 - try the code
05:42 - here if you have noticed i have used
05:44 - break statement inside individual cases
05:47 - here this break statement exit the
05:49 - switch statement once the matching case
05:51 - is executed
05:53 - if we don't use the break statement all
05:55 - the cases after the matching case will
05:57 - be executed now let me show you i'll
05:59 - remove this break statement from the
06:02 - program
06:03 - so let's remove this
06:08 - now i have removed the break statement
06:09 - from each cases now i'll run this code
06:13 - and i'll enter 5
06:15 - and it matches the case number 5 and
06:18 - thursday is printed at first
06:21 - then all the cases after that is also
06:24 - executed
06:25 - so we get the output thursday friday
06:28 - saturday invalid number
06:31 - this is why it is important to use break
06:34 - after every cases
06:36 - by the way if you are watching this
06:37 - there is a good chance you want to
06:39 - improve your skills in c programming
06:41 - lucky for you we have a mobile app that
06:43 - provides a well-structured c programming
06:45 - course with certification at the end and
06:47 - you can use the app alongside the video
06:49 - to practice on the built-in compiler our
06:51 - course is free so download now by
06:53 - scanning this qr code or click the link
06:55 - in the video description
07:00 - we learned that using break after every
07:02 - case is important however sometime there
07:04 - might be situations where we want to
07:06 - execute multiple cases together in such
07:09 - situation we can omit break statement
07:12 - let's see an example as you can see i
07:14 - have pasted some new code on the
07:16 - compiler here we want to check if the
07:18 - day is weekday or a weekend
07:21 - so all the cases from 2 to 6 will print
07:24 - weekday
07:26 - and the case 1 and k7 will print weekend
07:31 - and then the default will be a invalid
07:34 - number
07:35 - now let me run this code
07:38 - i'll enter fourier
07:40 - as expected we get
07:42 - weekday and i'll run this again this
07:45 - time i'll enter one
07:47 - and you can see weekend is printed on
07:49 - the screen
07:50 - as you can see we can omit the break
07:53 - statement as per our need next we will
07:55 - use the switch case statement to create
07:57 - a simple calculator okay guys we need
08:00 - your support to keep this type of
08:01 - content free for all users youtube
08:03 - really likes engagement on the video so
08:05 - leave a comment below press that like
08:07 - button hit subscribe if you haven't
08:09 - already let's get the engagement score
08:11 - high up so that more people can discover
08:13 - and enjoy these courses
08:17 - now that we know the working of the
08:19 - switch statement let's create a simple
08:22 - calculator using it here i have copy
08:24 - pasted the code from our github
08:26 - repository so that you don't have to see
08:28 - me typing the whole thing now let's see
08:31 - what's happening in this code
08:32 - here we have created a character
08:34 - variable we then ask the user to choose
08:37 - an operator
08:38 - and store the input in the operator
08:41 - variable
08:42 - then we ask the user to provide two
08:44 - input values and store them in num1 and
08:47 - nom to variable
08:49 - then the result variable will store the
08:51 - value after calculation
08:54 - you can see we have used operator
08:56 - variable inside the switch statement and
08:58 - each case statement uses an operator as
09:01 - its value
09:03 - and based on this operator the
09:05 - corresponding operation is performed
09:07 - inside the case
09:10 - now let me run this code
09:12 - here i'll enter plus
09:15 - and i'll enter first number
09:17 - 8 and then second number 12
09:20 - you can see i get 20 as output what
09:23 - happens here is i provide plus as
09:26 - operator and this plus operator matches
09:29 - with this case
09:31 - hence the addition operation inside the
09:32 - case is executed and the final result is
09:35 - 8 plus 12 that is 20.
09:38 - the break statement then terminates the
09:40 - switch statement now let me run this
09:42 - code again
09:45 - this time i'll enter asterisk
09:48 - and the first number nine and the second
09:51 - number five
09:52 - since i entered asterix the operator
09:55 - match with this case
09:57 - so the multiplication is performed
09:59 - between number nine and five so we get
10:02 - 45 as our output
10:05 - in this way we can also perform
10:07 - subtraction and division you can try it
10:09 - yourself
10:13 - now to revise what we have learned here
10:15 - is the programming tax for you use the
10:18 - switch statement to create a program
10:20 - that will find the month based on the
10:22 - number input here take the input from 1
10:24 - to 12 and print the corresponding month
10:27 - based on the input value if the number
10:29 - is 1 print january if number is do print
10:32 - february and number is 3 then print
10:34 - marge and so on you can find the answer
10:37 - to this question in our github
10:38 - repository also if you want to revise
10:40 - today's learning all the programs will
10:43 - be present inside the repository the
10:45 - link is in the video description now
10:47 - that we have reached the end of this
10:49 - video it's time for programming squeeze
10:51 - which of the cases is executed in the
10:54 - following code
10:57 - comment your answer below see you in the

the result does not match any case then the body of default is executed now let's get back to our original problem of finding the days of the week on the screen you can see the basic c program now i'll create a variable number int number then i'll ask the user to enter number between one to seven so i'll use printf statement and i'll print the message like enter the number between 1 to 7 and

inside this curly braces will add cases so when the case is won i'll print sunday and i'll use break statement after that i'll talk about this break statement later on the video so let's continue when the case is 2 i'll print monday so monday and break statement so what i will do is i'll copy this and paste this five more times and at the end i'll put default and i'll print invalid number invalid number so invalid number now the case 1 and case 2 is already done so i'll edit from case 3 and case 3 is tuesday similarly case 4 is wednesday and case 5 is thursday so we'll write thursday here then case 6 is friday and finally case 7 is saturday so let's make this as capital so here i have included cases from case 1 to k7 and if the user input 1 then this part of code is executed and sunday will

inside default will be executed and invalid number is printed on the screen now let me run this program i'll enter five now the input value five matched this case case number five and thursday is printed on the screen now let me run this code again this time i'll enter six as expected we get friday as output now once again i'll run this code and this time i'll enter the number that does not lies between one to seven so i'll enter 9 and as you can see i got the output invalid number which is present inside the default here the default case is optional we can remove this if we are sure that the input value matches one of the cases go ahead and remove the default value and try the code here if you have noticed i have used break statement inside individual cases here this break

terminates the switch statement now let me run this code again this time i'll enter asterisk and the first number nine and the second number five since i entered asterix the operator match with this case so the multiplication is performed between number nine and five so we get 45 as our output in this way we can also perform subtraction and division you can try it yourself now to revise what we
