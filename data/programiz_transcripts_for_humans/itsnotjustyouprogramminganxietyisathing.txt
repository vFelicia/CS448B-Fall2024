00:05 - in just a matter of minutes or hours now
00:08 - while these youtube tutorials are
00:09 - impressive
00:10 - for a beginner i know that you must be
00:12 - feeling you know when you watch these
00:14 - videos you might feel
00:15 - overwhelmed and you might feel that i
00:17 - have such a long journey to go
00:19 - and you know will i make it so first of
00:21 - all uh
00:22 - always remember that these feelings are
00:24 - completely natural and expected
00:26 - it's completely natural to feel
00:28 - overwhelmed by these because you know
00:30 - a lot can be happening in these videos
00:32 - it's important not to give in to the
00:33 - fear and confusion
00:35 - don't let these feelings creep in
00:36 - because they will stop you from
00:39 - getting your goals so always remember
00:41 - that your goal of becoming a
00:42 - professional software
00:44 - programmer is always within your grasp
00:47 - these youtube rock stars you know they
00:50 - were beginners and rookies just like you
00:51 - someday
00:52 - they were strangers to the world of
00:55 - computer programming
00:56 - until they decided to dive right in and
00:58 - spend time learning the craft
01:01 - now learning anything and mastering any
01:03 - skill requires
01:04 - lots of effort and dedication and you
01:07 - know
01:08 - these people who you see and look up to
01:11 - have spent years and years improving
01:14 - their programming skills and building
01:16 - projects
01:16 - and to basically to get to where they
01:18 - are right now so
01:20 - uh it's important not to get lost and
01:22 - you know focus on too many things
01:24 - what i suggest is you pick up one
01:28 - programming language it can be python or
01:29 - it can be javascript
01:31 - then you know use that programming
01:32 - language to master the very basics of
01:34 - programming
01:35 - learn the very basics and you can then
01:37 - start to tinker
01:38 - with the more advanced concepts
01:40 - fortunately there's a lot of free
01:42 - content
01:43 - available out there for programming uh
01:45 - even on programmings.com
01:47 - you can find lots of programming
01:48 - tutorials on different programming
01:49 - languages
01:50 - we also have a youtube channel where we
01:52 - teach python and we're coming up with
01:54 - more tutorial videos as well
01:56 - but you know you have to decide what's
01:59 - the learning style for you
02:00 - so some people prefer text some people
02:03 - like to read books
02:04 - some people like blogs and some people
02:07 - like me
02:08 - prefer watching videos but still like to
02:10 - have a book on the side for a quick
02:12 - reference
02:13 - so find your learning style and stick to
02:15 - it so that you don't spend too much time
02:17 - going from one
02:18 - you know video to another blog to
02:20 - another website
02:22 - so try to in the beginning at least in
02:24 - the beginning days try to find a
02:26 - learning style and stick to it
02:27 - now once you master the basics i suggest
02:30 - that you start building
02:31 - little projects and apps by yourself
02:35 - what this will do is this will teach you
02:37 - the art of debugging that is finding you
02:39 - know issues and bugs with your code
02:41 - and it will also you will start writing
02:44 - codes that are bit
02:45 - longer than what you would learn right
02:47 - in a typical university
02:49 - course or you know through a regular
02:51 - python tutorial
02:52 - so it will give you that hint of
02:54 - confidence that
02:55 - yes i can you know write code that is
02:59 - longer and that is more complicated than
03:01 - what i have been learning
03:02 - it's also important that you upload all
03:04 - these projects to
03:06 - github and ask your peers for feedback
03:09 - because
03:09 - when people give you feedback you find
03:11 - more bugs that you probably did not find
03:13 - before
03:15 - and also you know someone might tell you
03:17 - a better way to do something a better
03:18 - algorithm to do something that you have
03:20 - done in your code
03:21 - this is also could be the beginning of
03:23 - your portfolio
03:24 - that will prepare you for a professional
03:26 - career so when you apply for jobs
03:28 - then if you have a github profile with
03:30 - where you have built small projects
03:32 - then you have a better chance of getting
03:35 - you know a better job
03:37 - now once your portfolio of a few
03:40 - projects and you know few apps
03:42 - then you have reached a level of
03:44 - proficiency where
03:46 - you can look at an app like twitter or
03:48 - linkedin and you know start to visualize
03:50 - how those apps might have been
03:51 - made now at this point it's time to
03:54 - learn
03:55 - about how to build software
03:56 - collaboratively it's time to learn about
03:59 - the software development process
04:01 - so coding and software development
04:02 - process aren't the same thing coding is
04:05 - basically you write code and software
04:06 - development processes how do you build
04:08 - software
04:09 - using you know large number of people
04:11 - and working in a team
04:12 - so that's a different process and you
04:14 - you should start
04:16 - reading books and learning about that
04:18 - process now let me circle back to the
04:20 - original question of
04:22 - uh you know are these instagram clone
04:24 - videos any useful
04:26 - and my answer is absolutely yes because
04:29 - these videos
04:30 - give you an insight into the thought
04:32 - process and the you know overall wiring
04:35 - that goes
04:36 - inside making a complete app which you
04:38 - might not learn from just tutorial
04:40 - videos
04:41 - we are planning to come up with such
04:42 - videos as well we are still in the
04:44 - brainstorming phase for that
04:46 - but stay tuned we'll come up with those
04:48 - videos
04:49 - now what is already in the pipeline is a
04:51 - qna session so a lot of you have been
04:53 - asking
04:54 - us on youtube in the comments that you
04:56 - want us to answer your questions
04:58 - so now you can do that go to twitter
05:01 - facebook
05:02 - linkedin or youtube and ask a question
05:05 - with the ask program is
05:06 - hashtag and i will surely answer your
05:08 - questions stay curious and i'll see you
05:10 - in the next one
