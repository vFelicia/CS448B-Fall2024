00:00 - today we are going to talk about how to
00:01 - write the hello world program in 10
00:03 - different languages
00:04 - the purpose of this video is not to
00:08 - learn the syntax of all 10 programming
00:10 - languages
00:11 - but to see the syntactic differences
00:13 - that you know doing the same
00:15 - thing in different programming languages
00:16 - how does it look so
00:18 - that is what we are trying to see so the
00:20 - first language that we are going to be
00:21 - writing hello world is in java
00:23 - now i've already talked about java
00:24 - before java is an object-oriented
00:26 - programming language
00:27 - that is extremely popular in the
00:29 - enterprise software development world
00:31 - now since it is an object-oriented
00:33 - programming language
00:34 - all ports even the simplest hello world
00:37 - code has to be
00:38 - put inside a class and that is what you
00:40 - see in a
00:41 - hello world java code the next
00:43 - programming language is python
00:45 - python because it is an interpreted
00:47 - language
00:48 - so it's the syntax is much simpler and
00:51 - you don't need classes
00:53 - although it does support object-oriented
00:55 - programming but to write the hello world
00:56 - program
00:57 - you just need to write print hello world
01:00 - the next programming language where we
01:01 - see the hello world program is c
01:03 - because c is a procedural programming
01:05 - language you need to define the hello
01:07 - world code or the code that prints hello
01:09 - world
01:10 - inside the main function you also need
01:12 - to include the stdio.h header
01:15 - that contains the libraries for
01:17 - inputting and
01:18 - outputting to the screen the fourth
01:21 - language that we're going to try is
01:22 - javascript
01:23 - now javascript is a scripting language
01:25 - so it obviously has a very simple syntax
01:27 - for beginners
01:28 - and it is also now being popularly used
01:31 - in server side applications
01:33 - in addition to web development as well
01:35 - so in javascript there are three
01:36 - different ways depending on whether you
01:38 - are executing the
01:39 - code on the front end or the back end to
01:41 - output things
01:42 - to the screen next let's look at c sharp
01:46 - if you look at the code it is very
01:47 - similar to java because it was inspired
01:50 - from java
01:51 - so microsoft built c sharp where they
01:53 - looked at java
01:54 - and they looked at what weaknesses it
01:56 - had or how they could build a better
01:58 - version of it
01:59 - that is why it is very similar to java
02:01 - and it is very popular in the enterprise
02:03 - software application world
02:05 - the next programming language we are
02:06 - going to look at is go now go is a
02:08 - procedural language that is built by
02:10 - google
02:11 - and if you look at the hello world
02:14 - program for go
02:15 - then it is very similar to c because
02:17 - again as i mentioned before
02:19 - because both are procedural languages so
02:21 - they'll have very similar syntax
02:24 - the next language we're going to look at
02:26 - is portland kotlin was developed by a
02:28 - company called jetbrains which also
02:30 - builds
02:31 - ides and it is used or it is being built
02:34 - as an alternative to java
02:36 - for building android applications
02:39 - the next programming language we're
02:40 - going to look at is swift swift is built
02:43 - by apple
02:43 - and it is used for building applications
02:45 - for ios mac os
02:47 - and watch os if you look at the syntax
02:50 - it's very simple to write hello world in
02:53 - swift
02:54 - the next language we're going to look at
02:55 - is php php is one of the world's most
02:58 - popular programming languages or
02:59 - scripting languages
03:00 - because it is used so widely for web
03:03 - development
03:04 - now the syntax of php might seem a bit
03:07 - weird
03:08 - compared to other programming languages
03:10 - because
03:11 - it is primarily used as a templating
03:12 - language or it was
03:14 - built as a templating language and later
03:16 - on programming language core programming
03:18 - language features were added to it
03:20 - but this is how hello world is written
03:22 - in php
03:24 - let's move on to c plus plus now since c
03:26 - plus plus was built on top of c
03:28 - the hello world program for c plus looks
03:30 - very similar to c
03:32 - what you see in the print hello world
03:34 - program is the introduction of streams
03:36 - that is a concept in c
03:38 - plus plus and that is very popular so
03:40 - this is
03:41 - a bit different from again other
03:43 - programming languages now i have a
03:45 - little task for you
03:46 - if you remember the first hello world
03:47 - program you wrote in your favorite
03:49 - programming language
03:50 - write it in the comments below and let's
03:52 - see which programming language is more
03:53 - popular for
03:54 - learning the first programming language
03:57 - or the first step in learning
03:58 - programming
03:59 - for all of you i'll see you in the next
04:01 - one happy programming

Cleaned transcript:

today we are going to talk about how to write the hello world program in 10 different languages the purpose of this video is not to learn the syntax of all 10 programming languages but to see the syntactic differences that you know doing the same thing in different programming languages how does it look so that is what we are trying to see so the first language that we are going to be writing hello world is in java now i've already talked about java before java is an objectoriented programming language that is extremely popular in the enterprise software development world now since it is an objectoriented programming language all ports even the simplest hello world code has to be put inside a class and that is what you see in a hello world java code the next programming language is python python because it is an interpreted language so it's the syntax is much simpler and you don't need classes although it does support objectoriented programming but to write the hello world program you just need to write print hello world the next programming language where we see the hello world program is c because c is a procedural programming language you need to define the hello world code or the code that prints hello world inside the main function you also need to include the stdio.h header that contains the libraries for inputting and outputting to the screen the fourth language that we're going to try is javascript now javascript is a scripting language so it obviously has a very simple syntax for beginners and it is also now being popularly used in server side applications in addition to web development as well so in javascript there are three different ways depending on whether you are executing the code on the front end or the back end to output things to the screen next let's look at c sharp if you look at the code it is very similar to java because it was inspired from java so microsoft built c sharp where they looked at java and they looked at what weaknesses it had or how they could build a better version of it that is why it is very similar to java and it is very popular in the enterprise software application world the next programming language we are going to look at is go now go is a procedural language that is built by google and if you look at the hello world program for go then it is very similar to c because again as i mentioned before because both are procedural languages so they'll have very similar syntax the next language we're going to look at is portland kotlin was developed by a company called jetbrains which also builds ides and it is used or it is being built as an alternative to java for building android applications the next programming language we're going to look at is swift swift is built by apple and it is used for building applications for ios mac os and watch os if you look at the syntax it's very simple to write hello world in swift the next language we're going to look at is php php is one of the world's most popular programming languages or scripting languages because it is used so widely for web development now the syntax of php might seem a bit weird compared to other programming languages because it is primarily used as a templating language or it was built as a templating language and later on programming language core programming language features were added to it but this is how hello world is written in php let's move on to c plus plus now since c plus plus was built on top of c the hello world program for c plus looks very similar to c what you see in the print hello world program is the introduction of streams that is a concept in c plus plus and that is very popular so this is a bit different from again other programming languages now i have a little task for you if you remember the first hello world program you wrote in your favorite programming language write it in the comments below and let's see which programming language is more popular for learning the first programming language or the first step in learning programming for all of you i'll see you in the next one happy programming
