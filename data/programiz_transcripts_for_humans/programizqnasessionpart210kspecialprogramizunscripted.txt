With timestamps:

00:00 - first and foremost thank you for
00:01 - showering all the love on our ass
00:03 - programming's part one
00:04 - as i mentioned before during the part
00:06 - one video there were so many questions
00:08 - that we had to break up the video into
00:09 - two parts
00:10 - and this is part two of ask programmers
00:13 - also i'd like to thank all of you for
00:15 - taking us
00:15 - 10 000 subscribers it's a massive number
00:18 - for us and it really motivates us to
00:20 - create more content
00:21 - so if you have not hit that subscribe
00:22 - button hit it and also hit that bell
00:24 - icon so that you get notifications for
00:26 - the next video
00:27 - the first question is from youtube
00:29 - comments so it says i love your python
00:31 - tutorials
00:32 - waiting for other languages to what is
00:34 - your favorite programming language bro
00:36 - the question is from asmitastraster so
00:40 - you must be wondering it must be python
00:42 - but it's not i
00:43 - actually love javascript because uh not
00:46 - because
00:46 - you know there's a preference then i
00:48 - believe that javascript is better than
00:50 - python
00:50 - but because it is the programming
00:52 - language i learned first
00:54 - when i went into professional software
00:55 - development and it's a language that
00:57 - i've always talked with
00:58 - in fact we we are planning some
01:01 - tutorials on javascript or
01:03 - you know we have a series on javascript
01:05 - on the programming website
01:06 - and you could see apps or videos on
01:08 - javascript coming soon so
01:10 - definitely javascript is uh what my
01:13 - favorite programming language and it's a
01:15 - language that i will never give up on
01:18 - uh one is by karthik udainiya
01:21 - udainiya so he says ask program is when
01:24 - will you start making videos on
01:25 - application based or project based
01:27 - coding like
01:28 - for programming games i i understand
01:31 - that you want to start building projects
01:33 - and you know
01:33 - just learning and this is something that
01:35 - i've been saying myself that
01:37 - watching tutorial after tutorial is not
01:39 - going to help unless you
01:40 - get your hands dirty with programming so
01:43 - definitely that is in the
01:44 - pipeline and you know first we want to
01:46 - wrap up the basics of python so that
01:49 - when we build those project-based things
01:51 - if you get stuck
01:52 - then you have high quality resources you
01:54 - can get back to if you go to project
01:56 - based videos directly
01:58 - then you know if you don't have good
02:00 - resources on the basics
02:01 - we don't want you to get stuck and
02:03 - that's why we want to finish all these
02:05 - basics videos first
02:06 - definitely as you mentioned we want to
02:08 - teach you
02:09 - how to build projects and how things
02:11 - work in real life
02:12 - some of them are very different from the
02:14 - tutorials or you know it's not as
02:16 - rosy as the tutorials seem to be but
02:20 - yes that is definitely in the pipeline
02:22 - the next question is by a user called
02:24 - civo hd
02:26 - so they say will you teach machine
02:28 - learning on python
02:30 - now this is a question that we get a lot
02:32 - and you know this is something that we
02:34 - ponder a lot
02:35 - that should we go into more advanced
02:37 - courses like machine learning and data
02:38 - science and
02:39 - web development and all that but what
02:41 - we've decided is program is is always
02:43 - going to be for beginners
02:44 - and at least that is the focus right now
02:46 - so we are
02:48 - not going into teaching machine learning
02:50 - or you know more advanced
02:53 - parts of programming this helps us
02:56 - really focus our attention on beginners
02:58 - who are struggling with basic concepts
03:00 - and this is a conscious decision that we
03:02 - have taken as a brand so
03:04 - maybe in the future yes but for now we
03:06 - are focused on helping beginners
03:08 - uh take their first steps into coding
03:10 - moving on to the next question
03:12 - so it's from youtube riya stressed asks
03:15 - which text editor do you guys use ask
03:17 - program is
03:19 - my favorite is vs code and everyone in
03:21 - our team uses vs code
03:23 - because not only is it very simple it's
03:25 - also open source
03:27 - and it's got this whole ecosystem of
03:29 - extensions
03:30 - and community behind it so whether
03:33 - if you're doing if you're coding in
03:36 - python you can install the extensive
03:38 - for python if you're doing web
03:39 - development there are lots of extensions
03:40 - for web development
03:41 - if you're doing data science then there
03:43 - are lots of extension for data science
03:45 - and so it is so customizable and still
03:47 - so simple
03:48 - i don't know how you know how it's it's
03:52 - kind of
03:53 - i used to always believe that uh
03:55 - microsoft visual studio was one of the
03:57 - best pieces of software ever
03:59 - built and i'm so glad that they've open
04:01 - sourced it and made it made it lighter
04:03 - and
04:04 - made it open for the whole world to use
04:06 - so yes vs code is
04:08 - definitely our first choice of text
04:10 - editor and not just us
04:11 - it's you know all over the world vs code
04:13 - has taken the world by strong
04:15 - and the community that that keeps on
04:18 - adding to it is amazing so i suggest if
04:21 - you're a beginner or even if you're
04:22 - someone
04:23 - intermediate or advanced uh try vs code
04:26 - it's amazing
04:26 - the next question says i am working in
04:29 - an
04:30 - mnc so multinational company they do
04:32 - provide education and courses
04:34 - i joined the programming world and
04:36 - started from there
04:38 - in one of those courses i found your
04:40 - course on python beginner and started
04:42 - and followed your program his website
04:44 - i learned the basics sir and due to
04:46 - being
04:47 - i learned the basic sir and due to being
04:49 - a full-time employee unable to manage
04:51 - the time
04:52 - i am expecting a few exercises in python
04:55 - for beginners
04:56 - now it's a great thing that you want
04:58 - exercises and you know something beyond
05:00 - the tutorials
05:01 - and the little assignments that we give
05:03 - at at the end of some of the tutorials
05:05 - and if you're a beginner then our
05:10 - website has a dedicated section for
05:12 - examples
05:13 - in fact there's a dedicated header menu
05:15 - that says examples and you can look at
05:16 - the examples in different programming
05:18 - languages
05:19 - however i understand that you know many
05:21 - of these examples can be
05:22 - uh like build a fibonacci series or
05:25 - something that
05:26 - does not relate to a real problem but
05:29 - more of a simulation of a mathematical
05:31 - puzzle so that is something that we are
05:33 - definitely looking to change and we are
05:35 - going into more
05:36 - live projects so sir my question is
05:39 - about data structures and algorithms
05:41 - i heard this concept and don't know what
05:42 - this is and what do we learn in this
05:45 - concept and where to start
05:47 - this is a great question by kushal shah
05:49 - so thank you for asking it first
05:52 - yes for beginners you know there's
05:54 - there's so many
05:56 - buzz words that appear on the internet
05:58 - and on even in our content that
06:00 - can be confusing especially data
06:02 - structures and algorithms
06:03 - for someone learning if else and for
06:05 - loops and struggling with these concepts
06:07 - suddenly someone comes you and says
06:09 - learn data structures and algorithms
06:10 - you know go for competitive programming
06:12 - and it can be overwhelming so
06:15 - data structures and algorithms are more
06:17 - of an intermediate or advanced concept
06:18 - in programming basically
06:20 - if if it is about optimizing
06:24 - your code so that it runs faster and
06:26 - does not consume a lot of resources
06:29 - so data structures and algorithms
06:31 - basically
06:32 - trains your mind to pick the right
06:36 - [Music]
06:38 - structure for your data or you know how
06:41 - you can structure your data
06:43 - and algorithms basically focuses on
06:44 - finding more
06:46 - efficient solutions for instance if you
06:48 - wanted to find the sum of
06:50 - the first 10 numbers then you could say
06:52 - you know you could run a for loop
06:54 - from 1 to 10 and then you can add all
06:56 - those numbers up
06:57 - but if someone told you to add the first
07:00 - billion numbers to the first trillion
07:01 - numbers
07:02 - then this algorithm of running a for
07:04 - loop from 1 to
07:05 - a billion or a trillion probably will
07:08 - give you trouble
07:09 - instead there's a mathematical formula n
07:12 - times n plus 1 by 2 that will directly
07:14 - give you
07:14 - the sum of natural numbers from 1 to n
07:17 - so
07:17 - this is an algorithm that will you know
07:19 - that is more efficient
07:21 - and algorithms basically is about
07:23 - building these kinds of efficiencies
07:25 - into your program
07:26 - i hope this made it clear but again data
07:29 - structures and algorithms
07:30 - takes time to learn the next question
07:31 - comes from shreem mishra
07:34 - he says hello respected teachers can you
07:37 - please help us in writing python codes
07:39 - to print patterns
07:40 - it's a bit confusing and also do
07:42 - introduce us with your team
07:44 - and tell us more about your python
07:46 - passion and your work is
07:47 - just i don't see a lot of you guys have
07:51 - been asking us this question that you
07:52 - want to see pattern programs
07:54 - now i understand you know this uh the
07:56 - fun of pattern programming i did it
07:58 - myself when i was in college and
08:00 - uh it can really help you get your head
08:03 - around the basics of
08:05 - code because there's a challenge and you
08:06 - need to solve it so
08:08 - definitely we're coming up with those
08:09 - kinds of videos and also challenges in
08:11 - our app
08:12 - stay tuned now another thing that you
08:15 - asked is uh introduced to our team
08:18 - definitely uh there's you know it's not
08:20 - just me there are people who help me
08:22 - write the script there are people
08:23 - behind this camera who helped me create
08:26 - these videos there are people who design
08:28 - our website there are people who write
08:29 - content
08:30 - so there's this huge team of people that
08:32 - make programs possible
08:34 - obviously and i'm the person that that
08:37 - is in front and
08:38 - that because i am in the videos
08:39 - everybody knows me but
08:41 - uh definitely i would love to introduce
08:44 - some of the team members and
08:45 - maybe we will plan something around that
08:47 - so thank you for asking this question
08:49 - shout out to everyone in the programs
08:50 - team i love you guys and you
08:53 - do such wonderful work i am so proud of
08:55 - this team
08:56 - now about my passion for python um i
08:59 - don't really have a passion for python
09:01 - or javascript
09:02 - i you know and i feel that you
09:05 - as a beginner you should not build or
09:07 - even as someone advanced you should not
09:09 - really build
09:10 - an attachment for one programming
09:12 - language instead
09:14 - have a passion for for problem solving
09:16 - or for
09:17 - one domain of programming so you could
09:18 - say i have a passion for machine
09:20 - learning or i have a passion for web
09:21 - development
09:22 - i have a passion for building enterprise
09:23 - software or mobile apps
09:25 - that is a better way because you know
09:27 - see let's talk about mobile apps
09:30 - when i was uh starting my career people
09:32 - were building mobile apps in java and
09:35 - you know objective c then swift came
09:37 - along
09:38 - and changed the way we built iphone apps
09:40 - now there's uh then
09:41 - react native came so javascript was the
09:43 - way to go now people are building apps
09:45 - in flutter
09:46 - so the programming language will always
09:48 - change and you know if you get
09:50 - stuck if if i was stuck with objective c
09:53 - till now i would probably be out of job
09:55 - so
09:56 - don't really get attached to one
09:58 - programming language something better
09:59 - than python or javascript might come
10:01 - coming tomorrow and you know
10:02 - take the world by storm it doesn't take
10:04 - too long so yeah don't be passionate
10:06 - about programming languages
10:08 - instead try to find the niche that
10:11 - really attracts you and
10:12 - and then do research on which
10:14 - programming languages are popular in
10:16 - that field that's it for this video
10:18 - i hope you enjoyed it i enjoyed it a lot
10:21 - because it's always great to see that
10:23 - people have questions and people expect
10:25 - so much out of us
10:26 - it's also a bit of pressure but that's
10:28 - okay i enjoyed this whole process of
10:29 - making videos and creating content
10:31 - i and the programmers team are thankful
10:33 - for all these questions and all the
10:34 - motivation to build
10:36 - new products definitely all your
10:38 - suggestions are being uh
10:39 - taken and we are building lots of
10:41 - products for you stay tuned and i'll see
10:43 - you in the next one
10:52 - you

Cleaned transcript:

first and foremost thank you for showering all the love on our ass programming's part one as i mentioned before during the part one video there were so many questions that we had to break up the video into two parts and this is part two of ask programmers also i'd like to thank all of you for taking us 10 000 subscribers it's a massive number for us and it really motivates us to create more content so if you have not hit that subscribe button hit it and also hit that bell icon so that you get notifications for the next video the first question is from youtube comments so it says i love your python tutorials waiting for other languages to what is your favorite programming language bro the question is from asmitastraster so you must be wondering it must be python but it's not i actually love javascript because uh not because you know there's a preference then i believe that javascript is better than python but because it is the programming language i learned first when i went into professional software development and it's a language that i've always talked with in fact we we are planning some tutorials on javascript or you know we have a series on javascript on the programming

see you in the next one you
