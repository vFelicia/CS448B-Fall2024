With timestamps:

00:00 - in just 10 lines of code create the
00:02 - countdown timer in python first we will
00:04 - import the time module then create the
00:06 - countdown function run a while loop
00:08 - until the time in seconds is zero then
00:10 - calculate the minute and seconds using
00:12 - div mod method now create a string by
00:15 - formatting minutes and second in two
00:16 - digits then print the time format we'll
00:19 - use timesleep function to delay
00:21 - execution by 1 seconds now the value of
00:24 - time sec is decreased by 1 in each
00:26 - duration when the while loop is
00:28 - terminated it prints stop here we are
00:30 - passing 5 seconds now run the code here
00:33 - you can see countdown timer starts at 5
00:36 - seconds and end when the timer hits 0
00:38 - and finally prints the stock messes
