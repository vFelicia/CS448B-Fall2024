00:00 - what's up guys i'm punish from
00:01 - programmers and welcome back to the
00:02 - series on javascript in this video we
00:05 - will learn about the ternary operator
00:07 - which can be used to replace if else
00:09 - statements in certain situations to make
00:11 - our code look cleaner so let's get
00:13 - started
00:17 - let's start with the syntax of the
00:19 - ternary operator the ternary expression
00:21 - starts with the test condition like x
00:24 - less than zero or name equals to punit
00:27 - or anything that evaluates to true or
00:29 - false
00:30 - if this test condition is true the
00:32 - expression before the column is executed
00:35 - and if the test condition results in
00:36 - false this expression or the one after
00:39 - the column is executed
00:41 - as you can see from the syntax the
00:43 - ternary operator takes three operands
00:45 - hence the name ternary operator
00:49 - now let's see an example of the ternary
00:51 - operator on my code editor i'll create
00:54 - an age variable
00:56 - and assign a value 15 to it
00:58 - i will now create a ternary condition
01:01 - age greater than equals 18
01:04 - let me put that inside parenthesis
01:08 - and then
01:09 - i'll put a question mark
01:11 - if the condition is true i want to put
01:14 - or print
01:15 - can vote
01:16 - similarly if the test condition is false
01:19 - i want to print
01:22 - cannot
01:23 - vote
01:25 - let me run this program
01:28 - as you can see cannot vote is printed
01:31 - this is because here the age is 15 which
01:34 - is not greater than equals to 18 that
01:35 - means this boolean expression is false
01:37 - and that is why the part after the
01:39 - column or console log cannot vote is
01:41 - executed and that's why we got cannot
01:43 - vote as an output
01:45 - if you're enjoying this video please
01:47 - also check out programs pro where we
01:49 - provide tutorials along with quizzes and
01:51 - challenges which will help you practice
01:52 - and test your learning in real time also
01:55 - the course includes projects to give you
01:56 - an awesome experience of how programming
01:58 - works in the real world and for our
02:00 - youtube subscribers we are giving 50 off
02:02 - on the yearly plan sign up by scanning
02:04 - this qr code or use the link in the
02:05 - video description to claim your discount
02:07 - we saw how to use the ternary operator
02:10 - as per our need we can also return a
02:12 - value from the ternary operator and
02:14 - assign it to a variable then we can use
02:16 - the variable after that
02:18 - let's modify this code i'll create a
02:20 - result variable and
02:23 - i'll assign the value or the return
02:25 - value of the ternary operator to the
02:27 - result variable
02:30 - since i'm assigning the value to a
02:32 - variable let me remove this console log
02:34 - so what will happen is
02:37 - first let me remove this other one
02:41 - now what will happen is
02:43 - if h is greater than equals 18 if this
02:46 - is true then the result variable will be
02:48 - assigned the can vote string otherwise
02:51 - it will be assigned the cannot vote
02:52 - string
02:54 - let me console lock the result
02:58 - and run this code
03:00 - and you can see that i got cannot vote
03:02 - this is because 15 greater than 18 was
03:05 - false so the result value variable the
03:08 - result variable had the value cannot
03:09 - vote and that's what i got printed when
03:12 - i said console.log result
03:16 - you can use either one of these
03:17 - approaches that we used for the ternary
03:19 - operator however if you need the value
03:21 - from the ternary operator to be used for
03:23 - other purposes later in the program you
03:25 - should always store the value in a
03:26 - variable
03:30 - in some cases we can also use the
03:32 - ternary operator to replace the e-file
03:34 - statements to make our code a bit
03:36 - cleaner so let's see the comparison
03:38 - between if else and the ternary operator
03:41 - as you can see both the if else and the
03:43 - ternary operator are checking if the
03:45 - value of score is greater than 50 and
03:47 - the code of the ternary operator
03:49 - obviously looks much cleaner and easier
03:50 - to read so simple if else that has a
03:53 - single line of code can be replaced by
03:55 - eternal opera in most cases however if
03:58 - the e-file statement has multiple lines
04:00 - of code you should always you go for the
04:02 - ifl statement
04:03 - okay guys we need your support to keep

04:18 - courses
04:21 - now to practice what you have learned
04:23 - here's a programming task for you can
04:24 - you create a program to check whether a
04:26 - number is positive or negative to create
04:29 - this program create a variable name
04:30 - number and assign a value to it then
04:33 - using a ternary operator check if the
04:35 - number is positive or negative if the
04:37 - number is positive print the number is
04:40 - positive if the number is negative print
04:42 - the number is negative you'll find the
04:44 - answer to this question in our github
04:45 - repository and if you want to revise
04:47 - these concepts you can find all these
04:49 - programs in our github i'll put the link
04:50 - in the video description now that we've
04:52 - reached the end of this video it's time
04:54 - for the programming squares
04:56 - what is the correct ternary equivalent
04:58 - of the following if else statement
