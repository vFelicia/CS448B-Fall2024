00:00 - what's up guys i'm punit from
00:01 - programmers and welcome back to the
00:03 - series on python
00:04 - in the last video we learned about the
00:06 - while loop to repeat a block of code
00:08 - until our test condition is false in
00:11 - this video
00:11 - we will look at the for loop which is
00:14 - used to loop over a sequence so let's
00:16 - get started
00:17 - [Music]
00:22 - before we look at the working of the for
00:24 - loop we need to understand about
00:26 - sequences
00:29 - a sequence is a collection of items in
00:31 - an order
00:32 - we have already used strings numerous
00:35 - times in our programs
00:36 - a string is basically a sequence of
00:39 - characters
00:41 - as you can see in the image the string
00:43 - python is a sequence of seven characters
00:46 - p y t h o
00:49 - and n let's look at another type of
00:52 - sequence
00:54 - this sequence has three items separated
00:56 - by commas and enclosed in square
00:59 - brackets
01:00 - this sequence is called a list we will
01:03 - learn about these sequences in detail
01:05 - in the upcoming videos for now just
01:08 - remember that a sequence in python
01:10 - is a collection of items in an order now
01:13 - that we know what sequences are
01:15 - let's get back to our main topic for
01:17 - loop
01:19 - the for loop in python is used to
01:21 - iterate over a sequence
01:23 - and in each iteration we can access
01:25 - individual items of that sequence
01:28 - for example in my code editor i'll show
01:30 - you
01:32 - suppose we have a string like this
01:37 - using a for loop we can access
01:39 - individual items of the string python
01:41 - one by one now i'll create a for loop
01:46 - here i'll say for character
01:50 - in text
01:53 - then i'll print the character using our
01:55 - handy print function
01:58 - when i press run we can see that each
02:01 - character
02:01 - of the string python is printed one by
02:04 - one
02:04 - let's see how this program works during
02:07 - the first iteration of this for loop
02:09 - the variable character will have the
02:12 - value
02:13 - p which is the first letter in the text
02:15 - python
02:16 - and that will be printed to the screen
02:19 - in the next iteration the value of y
02:22 - will be stored in the variable character
02:24 - and when we print character y is printed
02:27 - to the screen
02:28 - this goes on until we reach n after
02:31 - which
02:32 - the for loop exits by the way we are
02:36 - seeing
02:36 - each character in a new line because the
02:39 - print function
02:40 - adds a new line at the end of each line
02:42 - by default
02:43 - before we move on i'll add the syntax of
02:46 - the for loop here
02:47 - so that it's easier for me to explain it
02:49 - to you
02:50 - for each item in sequence
02:53 - execute the body of the loop
02:57 - before moving to the next section of the
02:59 - video i'd like to mention that the
03:00 - program is team has created an
03:02 - app that allows you to learn python from
03:04 - your phone the app contains bit size
03:06 - lessons that are easy to understand
03:08 - a built-in interpreter so that you can
03:10 - run python on your phone
03:11 - quizzes and many more features the app
03:14 - is available on both ios and android the
03:16 - links are in the video description below
03:19 - now let's talk about looping through a
03:20 - list suppose we have a list of languages
03:23 - like this
03:25 - let's use the for loop to iterate
03:26 - through each item of this list
03:28 - one by one just like we did in the
03:31 - strings example
03:32 - i'll say for language in
03:36 - languages print
03:39 - language now when i press run
03:42 - as you can see all three languages are
03:45 - printed
03:46 - one by one let me read out this code in
03:49 - plain english
03:50 - for each language in the languages list
03:53 - store that language in the language
03:55 - variable and print it
03:58 - now let's move on to python range
04:00 - function if you watch the last video of
04:03 - the while loop
04:04 - we used it to repeat a block of code a
04:06 - certain number of times
04:07 - like 5 times and 10 times let me give
04:10 - you an example
04:11 - i'll create a while loop that iterates
04:13 - five times
04:14 - from count equal to one to count equal
04:17 - to five
04:18 - i'll remove the old code and i'll say
04:21 - count
04:21 - equals one and then i'll say while
04:25 - count less than equals 5
04:29 - print count and then i'll increase the
04:33 - value of count
04:34 - like count equals count plus 1
04:38 - i'll press run and as expected the
04:41 - numbers from
04:42 - 1 to 5 are printed there's an
04:45 - easier way to write the same program
04:47 - using the for loop for that we'll use
04:49 - the range function
04:50 - let me give you an example i'll comment
04:52 - out this old code
04:54 - and then i'll say for count
04:57 - in range 1 to 6
05:02 - print count this range function
05:06 - creates a sequence of numbers from 1 to
05:10 - 5
05:11 - it doesn't include the last value 6
05:14 - let me run this code and as expected it
05:17 - prints 1 to 5.
05:19 - range is a very useful function we will
05:22 - learn more about the range function in
05:23 - detail in a future video
05:25 - so be sure to subscribe and hit the bell
05:27 - icon so that you don't miss that video
05:29 - let's try one more example of the for
05:31 - loop we will print a multiplication
05:33 - table of a number
05:34 - entered by the user from 1 to 10. let's
05:37 - first take input from the user
05:39 - so i'll say number equals integer
05:42 - input enter and integer
05:47 - since we want to print the
05:48 - multiplication table from 1 to 10
05:50 - i will create a loop that iterates 10
05:52 - times from
05:53 - count equal 1 to 10 so here i'll say
05:57 - for count in
06:01 - range 1 comma 11.
06:06 - as we have discussed before 11 will be
06:08 - excluded
06:09 - and this will give me a sequence from 1
06:12 - to 10.
06:14 - now we need to find the product by
06:16 - multiplying number by
06:17 - count inside the body of the loop so
06:20 - here i'll say
06:21 - product equals number
06:24 - times count now let me use the print
06:28 - function with commas to format the
06:30 - output nicely
06:31 - so i'll say print
06:34 - number comma x
06:38 - or times count
06:41 - equals product
06:45 - when i run it it asks me to enter a
06:47 - number
06:49 - and i'll say something like 9 and when i
06:51 - press enter
06:52 - as you can see the multiplication table
06:54 - is printed in this nice format
06:56 - here count is increased from 1 to 10
07:01 - and we have calculated the product by
07:02 - multiplying number
07:04 - and count so in the first iteration
07:07 - product will be 9 times 1 which is 9
07:11 - in the second iteration product will be
07:13 - 9 times
07:14 - 2 and so on
07:17 - before we end this video here's a
07:19 - programming task for you
07:20 - can you create a program to find the sum
07:22 - of numbers from 1 to 100
07:25 - basically the result should be equal to
07:27 - result equals
07:28 - 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus blah blah blah
07:31 - plus 100 if you're a programming
07:33 - beginner you might find this program a
07:35 - touch harder
07:36 - give it a try you can always find the
07:39 - answer to this program in our github
07:40 - repository if you get stuck
07:42 - i will provide the link in the
07:44 - description below before we end this
07:46 - video
07:47 - let me recap the concept that we have
07:48 - learnt loops are used in programming
07:51 - to repeat a block of code a for loop is
07:54 - used to iterate through items of a
07:55 - sequence
07:56 - if you know that a loop needs to run for
07:58 - a certain number of times like 5 times
08:00 - or 10 times
08:01 - it is better to use the for loop instead
08:03 - of the while loop
08:05 - range is a useful function that creates
08:07 - a sequence of numbers
08:09 - it's common to use range in a for loop
08:11 - to iterate the loop
08:12 - a certain number of times that's it for
08:14 - this video i hope you learned something
08:16 - if you're just watching the video
08:18 - without writing any code i highly
08:20 - encourage you to try the programs in
08:21 - this video on your own
08:23 - the only way you can be a good
08:24 - programmer is by trying
08:26 - by the way you can find all the programs
08:28 - from this video on github
08:29 - i provided the link in the description

Cleaned transcript:

what's up guys i'm punit from programmers and welcome back to the series on python in the last video we learned about the while loop to repeat a block of code until our test condition is false in this video we will look at the for loop which is used to loop over a sequence so let's get started before we look at the working of the for loop we need to understand about sequences a sequence is a collection of items in an order we have already used strings numerous times in our programs a string is basically a sequence of characters as you can see in the image the string python is a sequence of seven characters p y t h o and n let's look at another type of sequence this sequence has three items separated by commas and enclosed in square brackets this sequence is called a list we will learn about these sequences in detail in the upcoming videos for now just remember that a sequence in python is a collection of items in an order now that we know what sequences are let's get back to our main topic for loop the for loop in python is used to iterate over a sequence and in each iteration we can access individual items of that sequence for example in my code editor i'll show you suppose we have a string like this using a for loop we can access individual items of the string python one by one now i'll create a for loop here i'll say for character in text then i'll print the character using our handy print function when i press run we can see that each character of the string python is printed one by one let's see how this program works during the first iteration of this for loop the variable character will have the value p which is the first letter in the text python and that will be printed to the screen in the next iteration the value of y will be stored in the variable character and when we print character y is printed to the screen this goes on until we reach n after which the for loop exits by the way we are seeing each character in a new line because the print function adds a new line at the end of each line by default before we move on i'll add the syntax of the for loop here so that it's easier for me to explain it to you for each item in sequence execute the body of the loop before moving to the next section of the video i'd like to mention that the program is team has created an app that allows you to learn python from your phone the app contains bit size lessons that are easy to understand a builtin interpreter so that you can run python on your phone quizzes and many more features the app is available on both ios and android the links are in the video description below now let's talk about looping through a list suppose we have a list of languages like this let's use the for loop to iterate through each item of this list one by one just like we did in the strings example i'll say for language in languages print language now when i press run as you can see all three languages are printed one by one let me read out this code in plain english for each language in the languages list store that language in the language variable and print it now let's move on to python range function if you watch the last video of the while loop we used it to repeat a block of code a certain number of times like 5 times and 10 times let me give you an example i'll create a while loop that iterates five times from count equal to one to count equal to five i'll remove the old code and i'll say count equals one and then i'll say while count less than equals 5 print count and then i'll increase the value of count like count equals count plus 1 i'll press run and as expected the numbers from 1 to 5 are printed there's an easier way to write the same program using the for loop for that we'll use the range function let me give you an example i'll comment out this old code and then i'll say for count in range 1 to 6 print count this range function creates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 5 it doesn't include the last value 6 let me run this code and as expected it prints 1 to 5. range is a very useful function we will learn more about the range function in detail in a future video so be sure to subscribe and hit the bell icon so that you don't miss that video let's try one more example of the for loop we will print a multiplication table of a number entered by the user from 1 to 10. let's first take input from the user so i'll say number equals integer input enter and integer since we want to print the multiplication table from 1 to 10 i will create a loop that iterates 10 times from count equal 1 to 10 so here i'll say for count in range 1 comma 11. as we have discussed before 11 will be excluded and this will give me a sequence from 1 to 10. now we need to find the product by multiplying number by count inside the body of the loop so here i'll say product equals number times count now let me use the print function with commas to format the output nicely so i'll say print number comma x or times count equals product when i run it it asks me to enter a number and i'll say something like 9 and when i press enter as you can see the multiplication table is printed in this nice format here count is increased from 1 to 10 and we have calculated the product by multiplying number and count so in the first iteration product will be 9 times 1 which is 9 in the second iteration product will be 9 times 2 and so on before we end this video here's a programming task for you can you create a program to find the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 basically the result should be equal to result equals 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus blah blah blah plus 100 if you're a programming beginner you might find this program a touch harder give it a try you can always find the answer to this program in our github repository if you
