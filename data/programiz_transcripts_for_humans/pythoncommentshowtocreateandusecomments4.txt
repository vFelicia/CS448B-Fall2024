00:00 - what's up guys i'm puneet from
00:01 - programmers and welcome back to the
00:03 - series on python
00:04 - in this video we will learn to write
00:06 - python comments
00:08 - and see why they are important
00:16 - comments are hints that we can add to
00:18 - our program
00:19 - to make our code easier to understand
00:21 - let's take an example
00:23 - i have this program to print a text
00:25 - entered by the user
00:27 - to make this program a bit more readable
00:30 - i can add a comment like this
00:32 - so i'll say
00:36 - program to take the
00:41 - user's input this line
00:44 - that starts with the hash symbol is a
00:46 - comment
00:47 - we added this line with the sole purpose
00:49 - of making sure
00:50 - that anyone who reads our code
00:52 - understands what's going on
00:54 - however python completely ignores them
00:57 - we can also
00:58 - place comments after the code like this
01:01 - so i can say
01:05 - take input and then i can say
01:09 - print the name variable
01:15 - let me run this program as you can see
01:17 - it says enter a name
01:19 - and i'll enter felix when i press enter
01:22 - then it says your name is felix you must
01:25 - have noticed
01:26 - that only these two statements are
01:27 - executed and even for these two
01:29 - statements
01:30 - these lines are simply ignored
01:34 - now let me remove these two comments
01:35 - from my program
01:38 - i'm removing them because these two
01:40 - statements are self-explanatory
01:42 - and we do not want to make our code ugly
01:45 - by adding a lot of unnecessary comments
01:51 - we can also use comments to debug our
01:53 - code it is a common practice to comment
01:56 - out codes
01:57 - so that it is ignored rather than
01:59 - removing them completely
02:00 - let me give you an example let me write
02:02 - a program to take
02:04 - name and age input from the user so i'll
02:06 - remove this whole code and i'll say name
02:09 - equals input enter name
02:13 - and then i'll say age equals input
02:18 - enter is i want to convert it into an
02:21 - integer
02:23 - and then i will say print name is
02:29 - name and i will say
02:32 - print age is
02:37 - and then age suppose in this program
02:41 - it was not required for us to take age
02:44 - input from the user
02:45 - instead of removing these two lines what
02:48 - i can do
02:48 - is i can add a hash at the beginning of
02:51 - both of these lines
02:52 - so that they become comments and are
02:54 - ignored by the python compiler or
02:56 - interpreter
02:58 - let me run this program and as you can
03:00 - see it says enter a name
03:02 - i'll enter felix when i press enter then
03:04 - it says name equals name is felix
03:07 - but these two lines are completely
03:09 - ignored
03:10 - now later on if i want to use the age
03:13 - variable again or i need to accept that
03:15 - input from the user
03:16 - all i need to do is remove these two
03:18 - hashes and then they'll become
03:20 - statements
03:20 - instead of comments a little pro tip for
03:23 - you remember the keyboard shortcuts to
03:25 - apply comments
03:26 - in most text editors it's ctrl forward
03:28 - slash if you're in a windows
03:30 - and command forward slash if you're on a
03:32 - mac this will be very useful in
03:34 - debugging our code
03:39 - python doesn't have multi-line comments
03:42 - like other programming languages
03:43 - such as c plus plus and java however we
03:46 - can use the hash symbol at the beginning
03:48 - of each line
03:49 - to get the same effect suppose we have
03:51 - this code
03:52 - and we want to add comments to all three
03:55 - lines
03:55 - we can do that by selecting all three
03:58 - lines and pressing command slash since
04:00 - i'm on a mac
04:01 - as you can see all three lines have been
04:03 - converted to comments
04:04 - if i want these lines back then i can
04:06 - again select them
04:08 - and press command slash and they will be
04:11 - converted to regular python
04:12 - print statements before moving to the
04:15 - next section of the video
04:17 - i'd like to mention that the program is
04:18 - team has created an app that allows you
04:20 - to learn python from your phone
04:22 - the app contains bit size lessons that
04:24 - are easy to understand
04:25 - a built-in interpreter so that you can
04:27 - run python on your phone
04:29 - quizzes and many more features the app
04:31 - is available on both ios and android the
04:34 - links are in the video description below
04:37 - you can also use multi-line strings as
04:39 - comments
04:40 - if you do not know we use triple quotes
04:42 - for multi-line strings like this
04:46 - when i press run our string is printed
04:50 - here we are assigning this multi-line
04:52 - string i am a multi-line string
04:54 - to the test variable and we are printing
04:57 - that test variable
04:59 - however if we do not assign strings to
05:02 - any variable
05:03 - it acts as a comment because python
05:05 - completely ignores unassigned strings
05:08 - for example i can say something like
05:11 - this program takes
05:14 - an integer
05:18 - input from the user
05:21 - and print set then i can write out my
05:25 - program like
05:27 - number equals int input
05:31 - enter and integer
05:35 - then as we have been doing a lot in this
05:37 - video series i'll say print
05:39 - you entered
05:43 - number here this string
05:46 - acts as a comment because it's not
05:49 - assigned to any variable
05:51 - let me run this code it says enter an
05:54 - integer i'll enter something like
05:56 - 7070 and it says you entered 70.
06:01 - as you must have noticed these three
06:03 - lines are completely ignored by python
06:09 - now let's take a moment to discuss why
06:11 - comments are important
06:13 - imagine you're working on a year-long
06:15 - machine learning project for a client
06:17 - since you were on a tight schedule you
06:19 - decided to ignore comments
06:21 - anyways you successfully delivered it to
06:23 - the client and the client is happy about
06:25 - your work
06:26 - fast forward a couple of months a new
06:29 - government policy was introduced
06:30 - and the client wants the product to
06:32 - comply with that policy
06:34 - since you are the person who developed
06:36 - the app it's your responsibility to
06:38 - maintain it
06:39 - without comments you'll forget the
06:41 - reasons why you wrote a particular piece
06:43 - of code a certain way
06:44 - and you'll end up spending a lot of time
06:47 - looking at your own code trying to
06:48 - understand it
06:49 - comments are even more important if
06:51 - you're working in a group
06:53 - it makes it easier for other developers
06:55 - to understand
06:56 - and use your code that being said
06:59 - comments are not
07:00 - and should not be used as a substitute
07:02 - to explain poorly written code
07:04 - you should always try to write clean
07:06 - understandable code
07:07 - and then use comments as an addition
07:10 - before we end this video
07:11 - here's a quick recap of what we learned
07:13 - comments
07:14 - are hints that we can add to our program
07:16 - to make our code easier to understand
07:18 - python completely ignores them in python
07:22 - the hash symbol is used to write
07:24 - comments
07:25 - comments are also used for debugging
07:27 - code
07:28 - python doesn't have multi-line comments
07:30 - however
07:31 - you can use multi-line strings having
07:33 - triple quotes
07:34 - that act as multi-line comments that's
07:37 - it for this video
07:38 - i hope you learned something if you're
07:40 - just watching the video without writing
07:41 - any code
07:42 - i highly encourage you to try the
07:44 - programs in this video on your own
07:46 - the only way you can be a good
07:47 - programmer is by trying
07:49 - by the way you can find all the programs
07:51 - from this video on github
07:52 - i posted the link in the description
07:54 - below feel free to copy the programs and
07:57 - edit them as you please
07:58 - and if you have any questions and
08:00 - feedback use the comment section below
