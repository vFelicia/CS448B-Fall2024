00:00 - what's up guys i'm punit from
00:01 - programmers and welcome back to the
00:02 - series on javascript in the last video
00:05 - we learned about javascript arrays and
00:07 - to make working with rs easier
00:09 - javascript has numerous array methods
00:11 - readily available for us to use in this
00:13 - video we will learn about various array
00:15 - methods that are used to perform
00:16 - different operations on arrays so let's
00:18 - get started
00:19 - [Music]
00:25 - the push and unshift methods are used to
00:27 - add elements to an array let's see an
00:29 - example
00:30 - suppose i have an array on my screen so
00:32 - i'll say const
00:34 - fruits
00:35 - equals
00:36 - let me give apple
00:39 - orange
00:40 - and
00:42 - mango
00:43 - now if i want to add another element to
00:45 - the array i can use the push method like
00:47 - this so i can just say fruits
00:51 - dot push
00:52 - and let me add
00:54 - pineapple
00:56 - and now let me verify that
00:59 - the array element has been added by
01:01 - console logging fruits
01:03 - when i press run
01:06 - you can see that pineapple was added to
01:09 - the end of the fruits array
01:12 - but what if you wanted to add the
01:14 - element at the beginning of the array i
01:16 - can use the unshift method for this let
01:18 - me show you how so let me remove this
01:20 - code and instead i'll say fruits dot
01:24 - on shift
01:25 - and instead of pineapple let me add kiwi
01:27 - which is one of my favorite fruits
01:30 - and to verify
01:31 - i'll console log fruits
01:33 - and press run and you can see that
01:36 - instead of in the end this time kiwi was
01:39 - added at the beginning of the array
01:44 - similarly if we want to remove an
01:45 - element from the array we can use the
01:47 - pop and shift methods let's see an
01:49 - example i have the array from our
01:51 - previous example
01:53 - now this time i'll say fruits dot pop
01:57 - and let me see
01:59 - what happened to the fruits array after
02:01 - running pop
02:02 - oops
02:04 - i'll press run
02:05 - and you can see that mango has
02:07 - disappeared from the fruits array the
02:09 - last element is gone because i have
02:12 - popped it
02:13 - if instead you wanted to remove the
02:15 - first element we can use the shift
02:17 - method instead of pop so i'll just
02:20 - remove pop and say fruits dot shift
02:24 - now when i press run
02:26 - instead of mango being removed this time
02:28 - it was the apple that was cut from the
02:30 - fruits area and we only have orange and
02:33 - mango
02:34 - remaining by the way it's fantastic that
02:37 - you're learning javascript if you ever
02:38 - want to broaden your knowledge and
02:40 - explore other programming languages be
02:42 - sure to check out our ever growing list
02:43 - of mobile apps for java python and c
02:45 - they provide well structured courses and
02:47 - certifications which will definitely
02:49 - improve your resume and skills all these
02:51 - courses are free so download now i'll
02:53 - put the link in the video description
02:54 - below
02:57 - we use the concat method to join two or
02:59 - more arrays let's see an example i'll
03:02 - remove the sold core and i'll say const
03:05 - array 1
03:06 - equals
03:08 - hello
03:09 - world
03:11 - and let me put another array array 2
03:14 - equals
03:16 - javascript and
03:19 - programming
03:21 - now i can use the concat method to join
03:23 - these two arrays
03:25 - so i'll say const result equals array1
03:29 - dot
03:30 - concat
03:31 - array2
03:33 - and let me console log the result to see
03:35 - what happened
03:36 - when i press run
03:38 - you can see that the result variable now
03:42 - contains an array containing all the
03:44 - elements of array1
03:46 - followed by all the elements of array2
03:51 - that means the two arrays were
03:53 - concatenated into one array by the
03:55 - concat method
04:00 - the sort method is used to sort elements
04:02 - of an area alphabetically in ascending
04:04 - order let's see an example suppose i
04:06 - have an array of fruits like this so
04:08 - i'll remove the sole code and say fruits
04:12 - equals apple
04:15 - mango
04:17 - papaya
04:19 - and my favorite kiwi
04:23 - now i can use the sort method to sort
04:25 - elements of the array so just say fruits
04:27 - dot sort
04:29 - and as usual
04:31 - we want to see what fruits has
04:34 - when i press run you can see that papaya
04:36 - is now at the end because it starts from
04:38 - p
04:39 - kiwi has moved from the last place to
04:41 - the second place basically this array or
04:44 - the elements in this array are now in
04:46 - alphabetical order
04:50 - the slice method allows us to create a
04:52 - new array from an existing array let me
04:54 - give you an example i'll start with an
04:57 - array so i can say const ir
05:00 - equals
05:01 - hello
05:04 - world
05:06 - javascript
05:08 - and
05:10 - programming
05:11 - four elements
05:14 - now let me create a new array containing
05:16 - the first three items of this array for
05:18 - that i just need to say const new air
05:22 - equals r dot slice
05:26 - now i want to start from the first
05:27 - element so i will write 0
05:30 - which is the index of the first element
05:32 - i want
05:33 - so i want to start from hello which is
05:35 - the 0th element since array indexing in
05:37 - javascript starts from zero
05:39 - and then comma
05:41 - and then the end index
05:43 - but
05:43 - not inclusive so i want elements up to
05:47 - the third index the fourth element the
05:49 - third index because i want the first
05:50 - three elements so i
05:52 - say three however
05:55 - this second value is not included so
05:57 - programming which is the third element
05:59 - third index element is not included
06:02 - i should get the first three elements
06:03 - with this this is confusing at first but
06:06 - you'll get used to it eventually
06:08 - so i'll say console.log new arr
06:12 - and when i press run
06:14 - i got the first three elements again let
06:17 - me revise i start with the first index
06:20 - and go up to the third index but not
06:22 - including the third index that's why i
06:24 - start from hello and go up to the third
06:26 - index but i don't include it so i start
06:29 - from hello and go till javascript and
06:31 - that's why i got the three elements
06:33 - instead if i wanted just javascript and
06:35 - programming then first of all get the
06:38 - first parameter right so i want to start
06:40 - from javascript which is the second
06:43 - index so two
06:45 - and i want to go till
06:47 - programming or the element after that so
06:49 - 0 1 2 3
06:52 - 4
06:53 - i want 4 here
06:55 - and when i press run this time i got
06:58 - javascript and programming
07:00 - it might confuse you because the fourth
07:02 - index element doesn't even exist but we
07:04 - have to remember that the slice
07:06 - does not
07:07 - take the last element of this second
07:10 - parameter
07:11 - now there's a little trick to the slice
07:13 - method we can also use a single index
07:15 - instead of the start and end index if
07:18 - you use the single index the slicing
07:20 - starts from the index and goes till the
07:22 - end of the array that means since in
07:25 - this case when i wanted javascript and
07:27 - programming i actually wanted to go to
07:29 - the end of the array i don't need to
07:31 - provide the second parameter if i press
07:33 - run then the slicing will start from
07:35 - javascript and go until the end which
07:38 - includes only programming in this case
07:41 - okay guys we need your support to keep
07:43 - this kind of content free for all users
07:45 - youtube really likes engagement on the
07:46 - video so leave a comment below press
07:48 - that like button and hit subscribe if
07:50 - you haven't already let's get the
07:51 - engagements go high up so that more
07:53 - people can discover and enjoy these
07:54 - courses
07:58 - we can use the splice method to change
08:00 - the elements of an array let me give you
08:02 - an example so let me remove this code i
08:05 - have an array with four elements hello
08:07 - world javascript and programming now i
08:10 - want to remove the first two elements
08:11 - and add another element instead of it so
08:15 - i want to remove hello and word
08:17 - and let me say
08:19 - arr dot splice
08:22 - so how splice works is first of all i
08:24 - want to start removing hello so that
08:27 - means the zeroth index
08:30 - so i put zero here that means
08:32 - the splicing or the removing of the
08:34 - elements will start from zero
08:36 - now i want to remove hello and world
08:38 - which is two elements so the second
08:41 - parameter will be two
08:43 - and instead of these two elements
08:45 - i want to put
08:47 - language
08:48 - let me say so i want to put the string
08:51 - language
08:52 - so that is what i'll do splice in fact
08:54 - comes from botany so you must have heard
08:57 - of splicing of plants
08:59 - and that's how it works we remove
09:00 - something and put something in its place
09:03 - so i'll say console.log
09:06 - arr
09:07 - and now when i press run
09:09 - you can see that hello and world have
09:12 - been removed because i am starting from
09:15 - the zeroth index removing two elements
09:18 - and language has been added in its place
09:20 - because i have put the third parameter
09:22 - of splice as language which is what do i
09:26 - want to put instead of this
09:31 - we can use the includes method to check
09:33 - if an array contains a specified element
09:35 - let me give you an example
09:37 - suppose i have the array just like
09:39 - before
09:41 - and now let's use the includes method to
09:44 - check if this array contains javascript
09:46 - so i'll say const result equals
09:50 - arr.includes
09:52 - and the string
09:54 - javascript
09:55 - now if i console log the result
09:58 - you must have guessed the output by now
10:00 - but i'll still show you let me press run
10:03 - and you can see as expected i got true
10:05 - because indeed
10:07 - javascript is present in this array
10:10 - now let me change the value to something
10:12 - else let's say python which is obviously
10:14 - not in this array and
10:16 - obviously i'll get false this time
10:22 - we can use the find method to get the
10:24 - array element that satisfies the
10:25 - provided condition let's see an example
10:28 - i'll start with the numbers array so
10:30 - const numbers
10:31 - equals
10:33 - 2 4
10:35 - 7
10:36 - 9
10:37 - and 12.
10:39 - now i want to get the element that is
10:41 - greater than 5 from this array for that
10:44 - i can use the find method like this so i
10:46 - can say const result equals
10:49 - numbers dot find now here's the tricky
10:52 - part we will need to provide a function
10:55 - with the parameter as the element so
10:57 - i'll say element
11:00 - element
11:01 - greater than 5
11:05 - this is an array method which we have
11:07 - learnt in the previous video if you
11:09 - don't understand what this is then let
11:11 - me rename this as function element
11:16 - return
11:19 - element greater than 5
11:21 - this is essentially the same thing so
11:23 - basically put in a function
11:26 - that contains a representation of each
11:29 - element of this array
11:31 - and inside
11:32 - i will put in a true or false value or a
11:36 - true or false boolean expression
11:38 - if you're confused with this don't worry
11:40 - we'll explore this further in the
11:42 - further videos
11:43 - now let me console log the result
11:49 - and press run
11:50 - and you can see that i got 7 which is
11:53 - the first element in this array which
11:55 - satisfies this condition
11:58 - now apart from the ones mentioned in
11:59 - this video the javascript array provides
12:01 - many more methods to perform different
12:03 - operations on arrays if you want to
12:05 - learn about all of them you can visit
12:06 - our website www.programmies.com
12:09 - i'll put the link in the video
12:10 - description below
12:13 - now to practice what we've learned
12:15 - here's a programming task for you create
12:17 - an array with values i love javascript
12:21 - add the new value programming at the end
12:23 - of this array check if the array
12:25 - contains the text javascript using an if
12:27 - condition and if it does print the text
12:30 - you're doing great keep learning you'll
12:32 - find the answer to this question in our
12:34 - github repository also if you want to
12:36 - revise this concept you can find all
12:38 - these programs there i'll put the link
12:40 - to that in the video description below
12:41 - as well
12:42 - now that we have reached the end of this
12:43 - video it's time for the programmers quiz
12:46 - what is output of this program you can
12:48 - see the options on your screen
12:50 - comment the answer below happy
12:52 - programming i'll see you in the next one
12:58 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

what's up guys i'm punit from programmers and welcome back to the series on javascript in the last video we learned about javascript arrays and to make working with rs easier javascript has numerous array methods readily available for us to use in this video we will learn about various array methods that are used to perform different operations on arrays so let's get started the push and unshift methods are used to add elements to an array let's see an example suppose i have an array on my screen so i'll say const fruits equals let me give apple orange and mango now if i want to add another element to the array i can use the push method like this so i can just say fruits dot push and let me add pineapple and now let me verify that the array element has been added by console logging fruits when i press run you can see that pineapple was added to the end of the fruits array but what if you wanted to add the element at the beginning of the array i can use the unshift method for this let me show you how so let me remove this code and instead i'll say fruits dot on shift and instead of pineapple let me add kiwi which is one of my favorite fruits and to verify i'll console log fruits and press run and you can see that instead of in the end this time kiwi was added at the beginning of the array similarly if we want to remove an element from the array we can use the pop and shift methods let's see an example i have the array from our previous example now this time i'll say fruits dot pop and let me see what happened to the fruits array after running pop oops i'll press run and you can see that mango has disappeared from the fruits array the last element is gone because i have popped it if instead you wanted to remove the first element we can use the shift method instead of pop so i'll just remove pop and say fruits dot shift now when i press run instead of mango being removed this time it was the apple that was cut from the fruits area and we only have orange and mango remaining by the way it's fantastic that you're learning javascript if you ever want to broaden your knowledge and explore other programming languages be sure to check out our ever growing list of mobile apps for java python and c they provide well structured courses and certifications which will definitely improve your resume and skills all these courses are free so download now i'll put the link in the video description below we use the concat method to join two or more arrays let's see an example i'll remove the sold core and i'll say const array 1 equals hello world and let me put another array array 2 equals javascript and programming now i can use the concat method to join these two arrays so i'll say const result equals array1 dot concat array2 and let me console log the result to see what happened when i press run you can see that the result variable now contains an array containing all the elements of array1 followed by all the elements of array2 that means the two arrays were concatenated into one array by the concat method the sort method is used to sort elements of an area alphabetically in ascending order let's see an example suppose i have an array of fruits like this so i'll remove the sole code and say fruits equals apple mango papaya and my favorite kiwi now i can use the sort method to sort elements of the array so just say fruits dot sort and as usual we want to see what fruits has when i press run you can see that papaya is now at the end because it starts from p kiwi has moved from the last place to the second place basically this array
