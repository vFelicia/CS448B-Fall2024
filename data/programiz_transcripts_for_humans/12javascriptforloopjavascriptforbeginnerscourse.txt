00:00 - what's up guys i'm punishment
00:01 - programmers and welcome back to this
00:02 - series on javascript in this video we
00:05 - will learn about the for loop and use it
00:06 - to repeat a block of code multiple times
00:09 - we will also learn about two different
00:10 - versions of the for loop for in and for
00:13 - off loop so let's get started
00:19 - in the last video we learned about the
00:21 - while loop similar to the while loop we
00:23 - can also use a for loop to repeat a
00:25 - block of code for a required number of
00:27 - times however the syntax of a for loop
00:30 - is different from the while loop so
00:32 - let's first look at the syntax of the
00:33 - for loop the for loop starts with the
00:35 - keyword for followed by initialization
00:38 - condition and object expression wrapped
00:41 - up in parenthesis
00:43 - the initialization expression declares
00:45 - and initializes a variable that we'll
00:47 - need inside the for loop for example it
00:50 - can be something like let i equals 1.
00:54 - here the variable i is initialized with
00:56 - value 1 the initialization expression is
00:59 - executed only once in a for loop
01:01 - next is the condition expression it's a
01:04 - boolean expression like i
01:06 - less than 5
01:08 - it evaluates to either true or false if
01:12 - the condition is true the code inside
01:14 - the for loop is executed
01:16 - then the update expression is executed
01:19 - as well the update expression updates
01:21 - the value of the variable for example it
01:23 - can be something like i plus plus or i
01:26 - could have also written i equals i plus
01:28 - 1.
01:29 - here the update expression increases the
01:31 - value of i by 1 in each iteration so the
01:35 - value of i becomes 2 in the second
01:37 - iteration
01:38 - now this condition is evaluated again
01:41 - and if it's true the code inside the for
01:43 - loop is executed again and the update
01:46 - expression again is executed at the end
01:48 - so the value of i now becomes three this
01:51 - process continues until the condition is
01:53 - false if the condition is false the for
01:55 - loop is terminated
01:57 - let's see an example to drive home the
01:59 - point further suppose i want to print a
02:01 - message five times then i can use a for
02:04 - loop to run it five times
02:06 - so let me create a for loop and inside
02:08 - the initialization i can say let i
02:11 - equals one
02:12 - since i want to print the message five
02:14 - times i'll write a condition i
02:17 - less than equals five
02:20 - and i'll update the value of i by 1
02:23 - in each iteration so i'll say i plus
02:25 - plus
02:27 - inside the for loop
02:29 - let me print the message
02:31 - so i'll put two messages
02:35 - learning for loop
02:37 - and similarly
02:40 - javascript is
02:42 - fun
02:43 - let me also print the value of i so that
02:46 - we know what's happening inside the loop
02:48 - let me run this code
02:51 - as you can see the messages i've written
02:53 - are printed five times now let's see
02:55 - what's happening here
02:56 - during the for loop initialization the
02:58 - variable i is assigned the value one
03:02 - now the condition i less than or equal
03:05 - to five is tested since this is true
03:08 - the body of the loop is executed and
03:10 - that's what gives us the output learning
03:12 - for loop javascript is fun and the value
03:14 - of i which is one
03:16 - then the update expression i plus plus
03:19 - is executed which increases the value of
03:21 - i by 1 to 2.
03:24 - now this test condition is evaluated
03:25 - again 2 less than or equal to 5 is true
03:29 - and this body is again executed and
03:31 - that's why we get learning forward loop
03:33 - javascript is fun and the value of i
03:35 - which is 2
03:36 - this process continues for the value of
03:38 - i from 1 to 5
03:40 - when the value of i becomes 6 this test
03:42 - condition 6 less than or equal to 5 is
03:45 - false and the loop terminates in this
03:48 - way the messages are printed five times
03:50 - from i equal one to five

03:54 - also check out programs pro where we
03:56 - provide tutorials along with quizzes and
03:59 - challenges which will help you practice
04:00 - and test your learning in real time also
04:02 - the course includes projects to give you
04:04 - an awesome experience of how programming
04:06 - works in the real world and for our
04:08 - youtube subscribers we are giving 50 off
04:10 - on the yearly plan sign up by scanning
04:12 - this qr code or use the link in the
04:13 - video description to claim your discount
04:17 - now that we know the working of a for
04:18 - loop let's create a more practical
04:20 - example i'll use the for loop to create
04:22 - a multiplication table up to 10. so i'll
04:25 - start by asking the user to provide a
04:27 - numeric value and i'll store it in the
04:29 - variable
04:30 - let me remove this or code and i can say
04:32 - const number
04:34 - equals pars in to convert from string to
04:37 - number and prompt to get the input from
04:40 - the user so i'll say enter a number
04:47 - the multiplication starts from 1 so let
04:49 - me create an initialization expression
04:52 - as count equals 1.
04:54 - so for
04:56 - let
04:57 - count equals 1.
05:00 - since i'm printing the multiplication
05:01 - table up to 10 i'll use the for loop to
05:03 - run for 10 times here i'll use the
05:06 - condition count less than or equal to 10
05:08 - so count less than equals 10
05:11 - and my update expression will increase
05:13 - the value of count by one
05:15 - so i'll say count plus plus
05:18 - inside the for loop i'll multiply the
05:20 - number passed by the user with the count
05:22 - variable and store it obviously in a
05:24 - variable so let me create const product
05:28 - equals
05:29 - number which is the number given by the
05:31 - user
05:32 - times
05:33 - count
05:35 - so i'll use template strings to print
05:36 - the result i can say console.log
05:40 - and then the tilde
05:42 - dollar
05:43 - number
05:45 - x or times
05:48 - dollar count
05:50 - equals
05:51 - dollar
05:52 - product
05:56 - as you can see i've used template
05:58 - strings to print the output in a nice
06:01 - format
06:02 - this will make our output look something
06:04 - like 8 multiplied by 1 equals 8 8
06:06 - multiplied by 2 equals 16 and so on let
06:10 - me run this code
06:13 - and i'll enter something like 9 and
06:15 - press enter and as you can see i got the
06:17 - multiplication table of 9.
06:20 - here we're multiplying the number
06:23 - by the value of count inside the for
06:25 - loop
06:26 - we know that the value of count is
06:28 - increased by one in each iteration so
06:30 - the value of count starts with one and
06:32 - number was 9 so product was 9 times 1
06:35 - in the second iteration the value of
06:37 - count was 2 so the product becomes 9
06:40 - times 2 and so on
06:43 - that's how we get the multiplication
06:44 - table of 9 from 1 to 10.
06:51 - in javascript there's another version of
06:53 - for loop called the for in loop which is
06:55 - used to loop over all keys of an object
06:58 - before we go forward let's learn a bit
07:00 - about objects first we use an object to
07:02 - store collections of data for example if
07:05 - you want to store information about a
07:07 - student like name age and grade we can
07:10 - create an object like this so i'll go to
07:12 - my code editor and let me create an
07:14 - object called student
07:17 - and
07:18 - student is
07:19 - a student object can be created by using
07:20 - the curly braces
07:22 - and inside this i can say name
07:24 - colon
07:26 - string like monica
07:27 - similarly i can store a number like
07:29 - grade
07:30 - and another number like age
07:33 - here student is an object that store
07:36 - information in key value pairs
07:38 - name is a key and the string monica is
07:41 - the value similarly grade is a key and 7
07:44 - is the value
07:46 - now while working with objects we can
07:48 - use the for in loop to iterate over the
07:50 - keys of an object let me write a foreign
07:52 - loop to iterate over the keys of this
07:54 - object student so i can say for let
07:58 - data in student
08:01 - and curly braces as usual
08:04 - here data represents the key of the
08:06 - student object and in each iteration i
08:09 - want to print the key and the value so i
08:12 - can say console.log
08:14 - and then again the string template
08:17 - strings so i can say dollar
08:20 - data
08:21 - and let me put an arrow and let me see
08:25 - student
08:27 - data
08:29 - in the first iteration data is assigned
08:32 - the name key in the second iteration
08:35 - data is assigned the grade key and in
08:37 - the third iteration of the loop data is
08:39 - assigned as age and the student data you
08:42 - see here gives me the actual value of
08:45 - the key so in the first iteration this
08:47 - becomes student name which is monica and
08:51 - in the second iteration i get 7 and in
08:53 - this third iteration i get 12. so here
08:56 - i've tried to print both the key and the
08:58 - value together
09:00 - let me press run
09:02 - and you can see that i got the output i
09:04 - was looking for the key and the value
09:07 - together
09:09 - if you do not know about objects and are
09:10 - finding this a bit difficult to
09:12 - understand don't worry just understand
09:14 - the working of for in loop for now we
09:16 - will go deeper into objects in the later
09:18 - videos
09:20 - okay guys we need your support to keep
09:21 - these types of content free for all
09:22 - users youtube really likes engagement on
09:25 - the videos leave a comment below press
09:27 - that like button and hit subscribe if
09:28 - you haven't already let's get the
09:30 - engagement score high up so that more
09:32 - people can discover and enjoy these
09:33 - courses
09:37 - besides for and for in loops javascript
09:39 - also has a for off loop this was
09:42 - introduced in the newer version of
09:43 - javascript known as javascript es6 or
09:45 - ecmascript 2015.
09:47 - the for off loop allows us to iterate
09:49 - over iterable objects such as arrays
09:52 - before we learn more let's learn a bit
09:54 - about arrays first
09:55 - an array contains a list of items of
09:57 - either the same or different data types
10:00 - suppose we want to store names of
10:01 - students this is where we can use an
10:03 - array so i'll go back to my code editor
10:06 - and i'll say const
10:08 - students
10:09 - equals
10:11 - john
10:14 - sarah
10:15 - and c jack
10:18 - here the students array contains three
10:21 - elements john sarah and jack
10:24 - now we can use the for off loop to
10:26 - iterate over the array elements i'll
10:28 - write for and inside the parenthesis
10:32 - let me say let data of students
10:36 - you must have guessed by now
10:38 - if i say console.log data
10:41 - data will first contain john
10:44 - then sarah and then jack
10:48 - in this way we can access all the
10:49 - elements of the array one by one i'll
10:52 - run this code
10:53 - and as you can see john sarah and jack
10:56 - are printed we'll dive deeper into
10:58 - arrays and how the for loop works with
11:00 - ios in later videos so don't worry if
11:02 - you're feeling confused we can also use
11:04 - the for off loop to access other
11:06 - iterable objects like sets maps and
11:08 - strings let's see one example of using
11:11 - for off to iterate over a string
11:13 - so let me remove this old code and i'll
11:15 - start by creating a variable name
11:17 - language so i'll say const
11:19 - language equals
11:22 - javascript
11:24 - now i want to use the for off loop to
11:26 - iterate through each character of the
11:28 - string
11:28 - so i can say for
11:31 - correct let
11:33 - character of
11:34 - language
11:36 - and i'll say console.log character
11:39 - you must have guest output by now when i
11:41 - press run
11:42 - you can see that i got all the
11:44 - characters of the string javascript
11:46 - that's because a string is essentially a
11:48 - collection of characters and that's why
11:50 - we get each character when using the for
11:52 - off loop with a string
11:56 - now to practice what we've learned
11:57 - here's a programming task for you can
11:59 - you use the for loop to print all the
12:01 - even numbers from 1 to 100 the output
12:03 - would be something like this
12:06 - you'll find the answer to this question
12:07 - now github repository also if you want
12:10 - to revise these concepts you can find
12:11 - all these programs there as well i'll
12:13 - put the link in the video description
12:15 - below
12:16 - now that we've reached the end of this
12:17 - video it's time for the programming
12:19 - squeeze which of the following loops is

Cleaned transcript:

what's up guys i'm punishment programmers and welcome back to this series on javascript in this video we will learn about the for loop and use it to repeat a block of code multiple times we will also learn about two different versions of the for loop for in and for off loop so let's get started in the last video we learned about the while loop similar to the while loop we can also use a for loop to repeat a block of code for a required number of times however the syntax of a for loop is different from the while loop so let's first look at the syntax of the for loop the for loop starts with the keyword for followed by initialization condition and object expression wrapped up in parenthesis the initialization expression declares and initializes a variable that we'll need inside the for loop for example it can be something like let i equals 1. here the variable i is initialized with value 1 the initialization expression is executed only once in a for loop next is the condition expression it's a boolean expression like i less than 5 it evaluates to either true or false if the condition is true the code inside the for loop is executed then the update expression is executed as well the update expression updates the value of the variable for example it can be something like i plus plus or i could have also written i equals i plus 1. here the update expression increases the value of i by 1 in each iteration so the value of i becomes 2 in the second iteration now this condition is evaluated again and if it's true the code inside the for loop is executed again and the update expression again is executed at the end so the value of i now becomes three this process continues until the condition is false if the condition is false the for loop is terminated let's see an example to drive home the point further suppose i want to print a message five times then i can use a for loop to run it five times so let me create a for loop and inside the initialization i can say let i equals one since i want to print the message five times i'll write a condition i less than equals five and i'll update the value of i by 1 in each iteration so i'll say i plus plus inside the for loop let me print the message so i'll put two messages learning for loop and similarly javascript is fun let me also print the value of i so that we know what's happening inside the loop let me run this code as you can see the messages i've written are printed five times now let's see what's happening here during the for loop initialization the variable i is assigned the value one now the condition i less than or equal to five is tested since this is true the body of the loop is executed and that's what gives us the output learning for loop javascript is fun and the value of i which is one then the update expression i plus plus is executed which increases the value of i by 1 to 2. now this test condition is evaluated again 2 less than or equal to 5 is true and this body is again executed and that's why we get learning forward loop javascript is fun and the value of i which is 2 this process continues for the value of i from 1 to 5 when the value of i becomes 6 this test condition 6 less than or equal to 5 is false and the loop terminates in this way the messages are printed five times from i equal one to five if you're enjoying this video please also check out programs pro where we provide tutorials along with quizzes and challenges which will help you practice and test your learning in real time also the course includes projects to give you an awesome experience of how programming works in the real world and for our youtube subscribers we are giving 50 off on the yearly plan sign up by scanning this qr code or use the link in the video description to claim your discount now that we know the working of a for loop let's create a more practical example i'll use the for loop to create a multiplication table up to 10. so i'll start by asking the user to provide a numeric value and i'll store it in the variable let me remove this or code and i can say const number equals pars in to convert from string to number and prompt to get the input from the user so i'll say enter a number the multiplication starts from 1 so let me create an initialization expression as count equals 1. so for let count equals 1. since i'm printing the multiplication table up to 10 i'll use the for loop to run for 10 times here i'll use the condition count less than or equal to 10 so count less than equals 10 and my update expression will increase the value of count by one so i'll say count plus plus inside the for loop i'll multiply the number passed by the user with the count variable and store it obviously in a variable so let me create const product equals number which is the number given by the user times count so i'll use template strings to print the result i can say console.log and then the tilde dollar number x or times dollar count equals dollar product as you can see i've used template strings to print the output in a nice format this will make our output look something like 8 multiplied by 1 equals 8 8 multiplied by 2 equals 16 and so on let me run this code and i'll enter something like 9 and press enter and as you can see i got the multiplication table of 9. here we're multiplying the number by the value of count inside the for loop we know that the value of count is increased by one in each iteration so the value of count starts with one and number was 9 so product was 9 times 1 in the second iteration the value of count was 2 so the product becomes 9 times 2 and so on that's how we get the multiplication table of 9 from 1 to 10. in javascript there's another version of for loop called the for in loop which is used to loop over all keys of an object before we go forward let's learn a bit about objects first we use an object to store collections of data for example if you want to store information about a student like name age and grade we can create an object like this so i'll go to my code editor and let me create an object called student and student is a student object can be created by using the curly braces and inside this i can say name colon string like monica similarly i can store a number like grade and another number like age here student is an object that store information in key value pairs name is a key and the string monica is the value similarly grade is a key and 7 is the value now while working with objects we can use the for in loop to iterate over the keys of an object let me write a foreign loop to iterate over the keys of this object student so i can say for let data in student and curly braces as usual here data represents the key of the student object and in each iteration i want to print the key and the value so i can say console.log and then again the string template strings so i can say dollar data and let me put an arrow and let me see student data in the first iteration data is assigned the name key in the second iteration data is assigned the grade key and in the third iteration of the loop data is assigned as age and the student data you see here gives me the actual value of the key so in the first iteration this becomes student name which is monica and in the second iteration i get 7 and in this third iteration i get 12. so here i've tried to print both the key and the value together let me press run and you can see that i got the output i was looking for the key and the value together if you do not know about objects and are finding this a bit difficult to understand don't worry just understand the working of for in loop for now we will go deeper into objects in the later videos okay guys we need your support to keep these types of
