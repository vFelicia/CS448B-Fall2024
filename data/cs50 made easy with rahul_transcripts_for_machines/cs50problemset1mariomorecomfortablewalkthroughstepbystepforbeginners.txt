hey guys so today we're gonna be doing Mario more comfortable now it's very very similar to Mario less comfortable but just with a few extra steps so I highly suggest if you haven't done the my you're less comfortable you watch that video first it's in the link in the description so you do that first and this will be much much easier I promise you that so what we're gonna do in this program what we have to do if we have to print a pyramid whose height depends on the user once again it's the same thing so if the user input side of APE we need to print a pyramid with the height of eight and if the user it puts a height of four we need to print a pyramid with a height of four and so on and so forth we've been through this and Amaya's comfortable now the more comfortable version just actually has an extra permit here so remember in the last comfortable version we printed a permit that was right aligned now we just need to print another permit next to that pyramid that's left aligned right that's the only difference between the last and more comfortable versions so to start us off we're gonna actually just copy and paste the code from our last comfortable version and just make a few modifications because it's exactly the same so if you recall this code which we had earlier from the last comfortable when we compile it and run it this is the output right it's all right it's right aligned pyramid alright so we knew that now all we need to do is print a left aligned pyramid beside it okay so the differences are we need a space right we need spaces and we need hashes okay so now you might be tempted immediately to just start another for loop because you might be thinking like okay we've used for loop for everything so far now he is another for loop for the spaces and other for loop for the hashes but you would be wrong because of this simple thing if you try to see a pattern of the number of spaces on every line you'll notice that there is none because the spaces on every line is actually two so on line one there are two spaces online too there are two spaces on line three there are two spaces and so on and so forth so the number of spaces as actually a constant it doesn't depend on anything for Mme line there are only two spaces which means that we don't need any sort of loop how we did Lu is very simply just printf space space we need two spaces all right and that's it now all we need to do next is print a left align pyramid right that's all this is it's a right line pyramid next to a left line pyramid so we know that the spaces come first because the spaces come in between the two hashes so now all we need to do is print a laugh like Burma that's it and we've done this before it the last comfortable version so what we need to do is for column equals 0 call them less than or equal to row column plus plus all right so we just need a print a hash and it's that simple and that's just because we've already gone through all the logic in the last comfortable version if you remember that so it's exactly the same logic it's the same conditions it's the same everything to print a pyramid next to this pyramid all right and it's all within the same main loop so basically what's happening here is this whole loop is we're printing a new line before we print a new line we want to print the spaces to make the right line pavement actually right aligned we're going to print the hashes for the right line pyramid we want to put the spaces between the left line and the right line pyramid and finally we want to print the hashes for the left line pyramid so it really is that simple now let's just check its compiler code and dot slash Mario to run it I'm sure right here let's save for and that's pretty much it guys it's very very simple if you've completed the last comfortable version everything just makes sense logically and if you want you can go ahead and check 50 and everything should be okay here as we know so type in your github username and password alright and while this is preparing guys I'm gonna be uploading every single problem set for the cs50 course so make sure to subscribe cuz you're gonna get the entire cs50 course solutions on this channel also make sure to leave a like on this video if it helped you I hope it was simple enough to understand it was just literally two extra steps from the last comfortable version and that's pretty much it for this video guys I hope you enjoyed and yeah peace bye David
