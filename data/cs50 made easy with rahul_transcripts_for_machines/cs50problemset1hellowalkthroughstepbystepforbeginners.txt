hello world welcome to cs50 problem set one hello walkthrough now it's a very simple problem set and the main reason i'm making this video is actually so that i can guide you guys through the process of actually using the ide correctly because i know it may be complicated for some people all right so first of all we have a blank terminal right so let's type mkdir psat1 now make a directory called psat1 and then cd p set one which means change directory to pset one now within psi one we wanna make another directory called hello so make dir hello and then change directory to hello so cd hello all right now that we're done with that click on the folder and you guys will not have any of these you guys will just have this psat one right click on this now click on the hello right click it and then click new file and this new file let's call it hello dot c all right i double tap on hello dot c all right um so now we have a blank uh we have a blank slate and what we need to do now is first thing we need to do is include the normal libraries right so let's include standard io.h and also include cs50.h now these are just the libraries so that we can use the functions all right so let's make a comment include libraries all right now to start the program we need to do int main void and this is nothing more than just saying when green flag clicked on scratch all right so into main void open the flurry brackets the flower brackets um so so what do we need to really do in this program well we need to take some user input and then we need to say hello to whatever the user inputs so let's say the user inputs david we need to say hello david right so first thing we need to do is prompt the user for some input so let's first create a variable called name and that variable is a string right because it's letters so string name equals now how do we get some input from the user if you remember from the lecture it's using the get function all right so get underscore and we want to name from the user so that's a string so get underscore string and we prompt the user for some input let's say what is your name question mark and then we want a new line all right so backslash n that's how we do a new line and semicolon semicolon is just like a full stop right so it's like that's the end of the thought now we don't just want to prompt the user for input we want to say hello name whatever whatever name the user inputs right so now we can use the printf function so printf let's say hello comma and now we want to we want to say hello to whoever to whatever name they type in but we don't know what name that's going to be right because that depends on the user so we can use a placeholder so we just write percent s because it's a string so hello percent s and now we just need to tell the computer where do we need to get it from so we need to get it the percent s comes from a variable called name so percent as comma name right and that's outside the quotation marks so now we just need to put a semicolon all right and that's pretty much it let's just go to file save all right i'll change it save now let's try to make hello compile it all right seems to be going well dot slash hello what is your name uh let's say david hello david okay this is correct right technically but uh we have to also print a new line because it doesn't look nice here does it so let's we forgot to put the backslash n that's just to print a new line now let's compile it again make hello all right seems to be doing well dot hello what is your name let's say bob hello bob okay so that's it for this tutorial guys it was very very simple now let's just put some comments to make it very clear so this line if you remember was to get user input right and the next line was to print hello comma user input so this so those are the commands right and the commands are just to make it very clear with us and it gives us points as well so we're actually graded based on two things the correctness of your code and the style of your code all right so now we just need to check whether everything is correct so we copy the thing from here check function from here and we copy it into the terminal right it asks us for a github username let's put that in and our password as well all right it's going to verify should be correct as we've tested it out but it doesn't hurt try again and by the way guys make sure to subscribe because i'm going to be doing walkthroughs for every single problem set uh for mario cash credit every single problem set of cs50 is gonna be posted to this channel so make sure you subscribe and okay so it seems to be correct now let's check for the style style50hello.c right okay it's telling us to put oh okay so we shouldn't have a space in the into main void part let's try that again style50 looks good alright so when we're done with that we can actually just go ahead and copy the submit function and paste it into our terminal again now i'm not going to submit because i've already submitted but you guys get the gist of it now this is very easy problem set guys it does get harder so good luck with that but this is it for this video guys make sure to leave a like if you enjoyed if it helped you at all and make sure to subscribe for all future videos thanks guys bye david
