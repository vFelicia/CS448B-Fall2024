in this video we're going to be going over cs50 practice problem called half and make sure you watch all the way to the end because it's going to be a stepbystep guide for beginners now let's jump straight into it okay so the goal of the program is to calculate your half of the bill including tax and tip and for that we're gonna need three inputs which is the bill amount the sales tax percentage and the tip percentage right let's just go through quick example now as you get what I mean so let's say the bill amount is a hundred dollars and the tax is 10 and we want to tip 20 and it's important to note here that the tip is going to be as a percentage of the bill after tax not just the initial bill amount and you'll get what I mean in a second so first things first we want to calculate the tax amount which will just be the bill amount multiplied by the tax percentage right this logically so tax the tax amount will be a hundred dollars which is the bill amount multiplied by the tax percentages ten percent or 0.1 and so that gives us the tax amount of ten dollars and now we need to know what the total of the bill plus tax is right it's very step by step so the total is the bill amount which is hundred dollars plus the tax amount which is ten dollars right so the first Total which is Bill after tax so this amount is a hundred and ten dollars and now our tip is 20 so it's going to be twenty percent of the bill plus tax right which is 110 so tip amount is a hundred and ten dollars times 0.2 which is twenty percent which is equal to twenty two dollars and now to know the bill after tax and debt which is the total bill is going to be our total one which is the bill plus tax plus the tip amount which is what we just calculated so it's gonna be Bill plus tax it's a total one plus the tip amount which comes out to be a hundred and thirty two dollars but we're not done there because remember we usually calculate half of the bill so this total we just divided by two and we get an amount which is going to be your half of the bill the user is half of the bill so basically when the user inputs a bill amount of hundred a tax percentage of 10 and a tip percentage of 20 our program will output sixty six dollars okay now that we get the logic let's jump straight into the code so we can kind of see how it works in programming first let's go through the code line by line and try to understand it first it includes the standard libraries the function called half which outputs a float and takes in three inputs which is Bill tax and tip okay that makes sense that's what we discussed earlier let's go to the main function float build amount gets get float built before tax and tip okay so here get flow right they're trying to get a float from the user so they're prompting the user for the bill amount and then after that they're prompting the user for the sales tax percentage and finally we're prompting the user for the tip percentage right just as we discussed earlier this is being put into code finally we want to print you will owe this amount each and it's going to be a float right percent F to two decimal points okay that's just what this means and it's going to take the value from a function called half which takes in the bill amount X percentage and tip percentage and our job here is to complete the function called half right so we need to do all the calculations then we need to finally output half so that the program can use it so we've already established that the first step is calculate the tax amount which is going to be your bill amount multiplied by a tax percentage so let's go ahead and put them to code let's make a variable let's call it tax amount right just keeping things simple we can call it anything we want so this tax amount is going to be your bill multiplied by your tax percentage that's going to be tax over 100 don't forget to divide by 100 because remember the user is going to input they're going to write 10 or 20 or 30 right so if they're at 10 we need to convert it to 0.1 as in our example so we need to divide by 100 to make it from percentage to decimal so now we have the tax amount our next step is to calculate the bill after tax which logically is just going to be Bill plus the tax amount so let's go ahead and do that let's call it total one it's just a bill after tax gonna be Bill plus tax amount okay so far so good what's the next step next step is exactly the tip okay and we carefully tip as a percentage of the bill after tax or total one so let's call it tip amount just keeping it simple again uh is going to be told to one multiplied by tip divide by 100 right which is just converting the tip into decimal from Prestige now we have the tip amount which is a percentage of the total bill including tax what's the next step well the next step is simply total everything right which is the build plus tax plus the tip so build plus tax we already know is in total one so let's just make another total let's call it total two which is an arbitrary name which is going to be total one which is build plus tax plus the tip amount right it's going to be a bill after tax and tip and remember we're not done here because as the program is called we need to calculate half of the bill right so all we need to do is take the bill after tax and dip and then divide it by two so that's simple enough so let's call it half right the variable we want float half is going to be total two which is Bill after tax and tip divided by two okay and that seems simple enough and finally oh if they return 0.0 we don't want to return zero we instead want to return half okay that's the variable we want to return now let's try to make this program let's try to compile it see if we made any mistakes half okay luckily we didn't make any mistakes let's try to run it build before tax and dip let's do it as our example earlier 110 and 20 and over here it says you will owe 55 each whereas in our example we calculated as 66 dollars each so what could the mistake be here well if you're a complete beginner this might not jump out at you right away but I made this mistake on purpose so you can let this valuable lesson so over here you can see that tip as an integer right so when we're calculating the tip amount over here it's going to be Total 1 multiplied by tip divided by 100. but if it's an INT let's say they input 20 20 over 100 as we know is 0.2 but since it's an end it's just gonna round off to the nearest whole number so it's actually just going to be zero you know that's why the tip did not get calculated and if you see uh over here 100 plus 10 divided by 2 is 55 dollars right so it did not take into account the tip at all why because tip is actually an INT whereas tip should be a float right so then we can get those precise values we need it to be correct to the decimals we can't just have it rounding off to an end so over here this tip amount will result in zero regardless of the tip we put in so this is a mistake over here that has one simple fix which just we just need to tell the computer hey take this tip as a decimal please and we could simply do that by saying 100.0 right this is the simplest way to do it let's see if that solves it make half dot slash half and again same numbers 110 and 20 and now we or 66 each so that's all for today guys thank you
