00:00 - hello everyone this is Stephanie and I
00:03 - am back with another tutorial on PHP and
00:06 - MySQL I
00:08 - today we are going to be learning about
00:10 - forgot username and for that password so
00:14 - let's say you have an account but you
00:17 - forgot your username or your password or
00:20 - even both so I'm going to show you my
00:23 - way of how undo it and you can go ahead
00:27 - and follow along and if it works for you
00:29 - just put a comment below or you know
00:32 - like my page and subscribe so let's
00:35 - begin um I have I have already set up
00:39 - the main page for you it just have a
00:43 - login form it has a link and you know we
00:47 - have to go by it so let me go ahead and
00:50 - show you how that looks and
00:54 - this is the main page so we have the
00:57 - login form and we have our link for that
01:01 - username or password so if I click on
01:04 - this link
01:06 - it will send me to another page called
01:09 - forgot you dot PHP and it's going to ask
01:13 - for my email address and then we have a
01:16 - recover button
01:19 - now the only two files that we will be
01:23 - working on into the forgot show dot PHP
01:27 - page and the info dot PHP page I have
01:31 - already made the connection page and I
01:34 - have a welcome you dot PHP page whenever
01:37 - you decide to login
01:40 - so let's go to the let's go to the
01:43 - forgot your dot PHP page
01:45 - and
01:47 - the first time we want to do is session
01:50 - we want to start the session the session
01:54 - start
01:56 - and the next thing we want to do is
02:00 - require
02:03 - that connection page we
02:07 - so connection dot php' and that is it
02:13 - for now now what we want to do is
02:16 - whenever the user click the button what
02:19 - we want to happen
02:21 - so we're going to make an if statement
02:25 - and we're going to say if is that
02:31 - what is that
02:33 - so if the button and the name is
02:37 - recovery as you can see this is the name
02:41 - so if that but it is click this mitad
02:45 - happening and I mean spell that right
02:49 - [Music]
02:52 - so if this button is clicked what do we
02:55 - want to do well the first thing we want
02:58 - to do is
02:59 - we want to make a vample to get our
03:03 - table
03:06 - so i'm going to call this the ql equal
03:10 - to
03:14 - select
03:17 - everything from
03:19 - the table qin table
03:24 - [Music]
03:28 - where
03:30 - our e-mail is
03:34 - equal to
03:38 - [Music]
03:39 - the email that they
03:43 - input and
03:45 - I made my email implant email
03:50 - now the next thing you want to do is
03:54 - want to make another variable say ql q
03:57 - equal to the mysql I query
04:02 - and
04:04 - in this case we're going to put connect
04:07 - down this is from the connection page
04:11 - right over here
04:17 - then let me just go ahead and put my
04:19 - bearable EQL so it's going to search the
04:24 - table for the email that they posted
04:28 - now what we want to do is make another
04:30 - if statement inside this if statement
04:33 - and we're going to say if not him
04:39 - what is not empty
04:42 - if but um email input is not empty and
04:48 - [Music]
04:51 - MySQL I
04:53 - fetch
04:56 - Assoc
04:58 - [Music]
05:01 - Lee qlq is
05:05 - greater than zero
05:08 - and
05:10 - we want to check if it's a valid email
05:14 - address so not filter
05:18 - bar
05:23 - I'm going to put the email
05:27 - email
05:28 - [Music]
05:30 - come on
05:32 - filter
05:35 - validate
05:41 - email
05:43 - guys give me a second and I'll go right
05:46 - back I am so sorry guys I have to handle
05:50 - something but anyways let's continue so
05:52 - if not just of our
05:55 - email those to validate email if it's
05:59 - not equal to false
06:03 - okay so if all this is true the input is
06:08 - not empty on the email exists and it's a
06:12 - valid email address then what do we want
06:15 - to do well the first thing we want to do
06:17 - is we're going to make a session bear
06:18 - one
06:20 - and we're going to call this session
06:23 - bearable
06:24 - info
06:26 - equal to not equal but yeah equal
06:31 - so that post
06:36 - email
06:37 - [Music]
06:39 - and then we want to head we want to give
06:44 - it be directed to our
06:48 - other page called info dot PHP
06:54 - [Music]
06:56 - so that is what we that is what we want
06:59 - to do
07:00 - now let's say if there's an error what
07:03 - do we want to do here they're going to
07:05 - make a couple of if and else if
07:07 - statements now I'm going to say if NP
07:11 - [Music]
07:14 - post
07:17 - email if it is empty what I want to do
07:22 - well we're going to make a bearable V
07:24 - and just want to hold our message for us
07:26 - and this is going to say what is
07:31 - your email
07:33 - [Music]
07:35 - else if
07:37 - [Music]
07:40 - and I'm just going to copy this right
07:44 - here
07:45 - I'm kind of like
07:48 - yeah you can say if I'm kind of lazy and
07:51 - I don't want to do this right now
07:54 - I'm just kidding guys
07:56 - okay so my is my my fetch is socially if
08:00 - this one is less than one so what you
08:06 - know what yeah what do we want to do
08:09 - there go ahead and make that verbal be
08:12 - in this time is going to equal to that
08:15 - email does not think this
08:22 - else
08:24 - if I
08:26 - [Music]
08:30 - want to say
08:33 - now let as a run effect I'm going to
08:36 - rearrange this
08:37 - popping and race that
08:40 - go ahead and
08:44 - paste it over here into that okay else
08:47 - if what do we want to do and I'm going
08:50 - to copy this again
08:55 - off the
09:00 - pace and this is going to equal to true
09:04 - it doesn't matter if you um put it in
09:08 - caps or don't take lower case it doesn't
09:11 - matter
09:13 - so if not pills of our host email it's
09:18 - not a valid email address what do we do
09:22 - I'm going to make that same variable and
09:25 - [Music]
09:27 - we're going to say in valid email
09:31 - and
09:33 - that is what we do for that page so let
09:37 - me go over this page one more time so we
09:40 - we first start the session will require
09:43 - our connection page and then we said if
09:46 - the button is clicked if they if they
09:50 - submit the email be passed by it what it
09:54 - wants to do well first we want to select
09:58 - the email from our table
10:00 - we want to get the query and then we
10:05 - said if not empty if the input is not
10:09 - empty if the email does exist and if
10:13 - it's a valid email address and it's not
10:16 - equal to false then start um we're going
10:20 - to make a session variable and it's
10:23 - going to redirect us to infidel PHP and
10:26 - then we said if it is empty so this
10:31 - message if it's an invalid email Doris
10:34 - to message and if the email does not
10:36 - exist throw this message so that is all
10:39 - we did for the forgot
10:42 - PHP page now we can go ahead and save
10:45 - that and
10:46 - we're going to go over to our info PHP
10:51 - page in this page it's not going to be
10:53 - that long so the first thing I'm going
10:56 - to do is start the session also in here
10:58 - so session
11:00 - start
11:03 - and we're also going to require
11:08 - the connection page
11:16 - and then we're going to have a couple of
11:19 - variables so the first of all we're
11:21 - going to have we're going to call this
11:22 - an ql equal to is going to select
11:29 - everything from
11:32 - the table qin table
11:35 - where
11:37 - email is equal to
11:41 - that session variable that we made those
11:45 - session
11:46 - [Music]
11:48 - and we call it info
11:53 - now we want to go ahead and make another
11:55 - variable a qlq equal to MySQL I
12:02 - query
12:04 - [Music]
12:06 - Connect
12:10 - and
12:12 - we're going to have another variable a
12:16 - QL and
12:20 - let's just have another variable you
12:23 - just click all this a ql q q
12:26 - equal to MySQL and I fetch
12:32 - Assoc and in this case we're going to
12:36 - fetch available a ql q so wait we're
12:39 - basically fetching the table
12:42 - now just two more variables and we're
12:47 - we're done okay so I'm going to have a
12:50 - first value it's going to equal to a
12:54 - QL
12:55 - q
12:58 - and we're going to say username here
13:02 - so it's going to get the username from
13:05 - the table and
13:07 - P which is equal to aq l QQ
13:15 - and it's going to get the password and
13:19 - then the last thing we have to do is
13:22 - just echo
13:24 - let's say something like you're in
13:28 - formation is
13:32 - dot
13:34 - [Music]
13:36 - dot
13:41 - great
13:43 - dot
13:46 - hmm we'll say something like okay yeah
13:50 - I'm going to have a variable u
13:52 - dot want to make another complaint
13:57 - [Music]
13:59 - I'm going to say dot
14:02 - and that dog there will P and that is
14:05 - all we have to do so now let's save this
14:08 - baby

14:11 - let's go ahead and
14:13 - type in our email so the first thing I'm
14:18 - gonna do I'm type in

15:31 - know it wasn't much you know it looked
15:34 - at pretty easy so let me go over this
15:37 - page one more time so we start the
15:39 - session

15:43 - page we submit from the table the email
15:48 - and we said get the session and phone
15:51 - well the session nervo we made and then
15:55 - I said yet the query fetch the table and
16:00 - then get the username and password from
16:03 - the table and I say echo your
