00:00 - hi everyone and welcome back to another
00:03 - tutorial with me in today's tutorial we
00:07 - will be going over operators in PHP over
00:12 - here I have listed the different
00:14 - operators using PHP so let's go over
00:18 - them the first one is called
00:20 - concatenation and this is for strength
00:23 - operators it basically joins two
00:26 - variables together so let's say we have
00:33 - a variable a equals to stephanie and
00:41 - then i have a second variable y equals 2
00:45 - is great so what i want to do is join
00:53 - these two variables together so i want
00:57 - to make one sentence guesses stephanie
01:00 - is 3 so all I do is echo the first
01:04 - variable a dot the second variable Y and
01:09 - save that and as you can see it has the
01:16 - census stephanie is great so all the did
01:19 - was join two parables together and then
01:23 - there was another way to join them
01:25 - together all you have to do is make the
01:29 - same variable a dot equal the variable Y
01:34 - and just echo be variable a and it's the
01:44 - same thing when we refresh it so that is
01:49 - concatenation now let's learn about the
01:53 - second operator which is called
01:54 - arithmetic operators and these operators
01:59 - are addition subtraction multiplication
02:02 - division modulus and exponents this
02:08 - example says the variable a plus the
02:12 - variable Y
02:13 - so it's basically fun the sum of a and
02:16 - why so let's say we have the variable na
02:27 - equals 29 and be variable y equals 29
02:33 - awesome and we ever be variable a plus B
02:42 - variable 9 at nine but the variable Y
02:48 - and be fresh and we get our answer which
02:54 - is 18 and also another way to do this is
02:58 - you can just have another variable C
03:03 - equals to the vanpool a plus B variable
03:08 - Y echo you very will see refresh and you
03:20 - get the same thing so that is how the
03:22 - arithmetic operator works let's go ahead
03:27 - and learn about assignment operators
03:31 - assignment operators are used with
03:34 - numeric values let's say we had X plus
03:39 - equal to Y which is the same thing as X
03:42 - equal X plus y so let's have an example
03:53 - we have B equals 29 then we have C
04:01 - equals 2 18 then we have the same
04:07 - variable B plus equals to the variable C
04:13 - and then echo be variable fee and voila
04:22 - 27
04:24 - so that is all the assignment operator
04:27 - does is still add both of these numbers
04:32 - together but just in this way now we
04:40 - have comparison operators comparison
04:43 - operators compare two values so let's
04:47 - say we have the variable a equals to the
04:51 - variable Y so it's trying to find out if
04:54 - these two variables are equal then we
04:57 - have identical not equal not even then
05:02 - not identical greater than less than
05:07 - greater than or equal to and less than
05:10 - or equal to in this case let's just use
05:13 - the identical so I'm times we have two
05:23 - variables are equals 29 and F equals 2
05:33 - hello now I'm going to do an if
05:38 - statement I want to find out if these
05:42 - two variables are identical so therefore
05:46 - R is identical to the barrel f if they
05:53 - are equal true if not else echo boss so
06:11 - save that and brush and get false they
06:19 - are not identical this has a number and
06:23 - this has a string so therefore they are
06:26 - not identical now let's move on to
06:35 - increment and decrement operator the
06:40 - increment basically as one to a number
06:43 - and the increment subtract one from a
06:48 - number head over here and let's make a
06:54 - new variable G equals 278 the same
07:04 - variable G plus plus now this is going
07:08 - to add one to the number 78 so echo the
07:13 - variable-g and save it and you get 79 so
07:23 - all I did was add one to the number 78
07:26 - now let's say we went to subtract one
07:30 - from 78 and with the minus minus which
07:34 - is the D payments operator and you get
07:40 - 77 so that is all the increment and
07:44 - decrement does add one subtract one now
07:51 - we have logical operators logical
07:55 - operators are used to combine
07:57 - conditional statements the first one is
08:00 - and and this one checks if the variable
08:04 - a and the variable Y are both true then
08:09 - we have the or one of them has to be
08:11 - true then we have X 4 then the assemble
08:17 - and the symbol or and not so let's try
08:23 - with end some more fan of two variables
08:31 - F is 12 equal to 9 is less than 2 then
08:42 - we have another verb r is equal to 9 is
08:46 - equal to 9
08:50 - now go to an if statement and I want to
08:54 - see if they are both true so the
08:59 - variable F and the variable are if they
09:09 - are both true echo true if not else info
09:23 - box so save that and you get false
09:31 - because they are not true the first
09:34 - variable is false and the second verbal
09:38 - is true but both of them has to be true
09:42 - if we were using the or operator of our
09:47 - then it will be true because one of them
09:51 - is true and that is how the logical
09:57 - operators work the last operator we want
10:01 - to learn about is the array operators
10:05 - this compare arrays so we have Union
10:10 - which is a plus sign equal even which is
10:14 - equality then we have identity
10:18 - inequality inequality again and non
10:22 - identity so let's use be hmm that seems
10:29 - me identity and we want to see if these
10:39 - are identical so I'll just start a new
10:43 - one and have a verb r equals to nine
10:48 - then have another variable F equals to
10:55 - Stefan
10:59 - and we want to check if they are
11:03 - identical so r equal equal equal to F if
11:11 - it is I physical echo yes if not house
11:22 - echo you know i'll save it and we get no
11:33 - the two variables are not identical this
11:37 - is the number and this is a string so
11:41 - they are not identical in this case so
11:45 - that is it for the rate operators and
11:48 - that is it for this tutorial of all
11:53 - operators thank you guys for watching
11:56 - and I will see you guys on the next
