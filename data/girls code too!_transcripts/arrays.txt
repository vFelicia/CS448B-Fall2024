00:00 - hi everyone it's Stephanie and welcome
00:03 - to another tutorial with me in today's
00:06 - tutorial we are going to be learning
00:09 - about arrays now arrays are a way to
00:12 - store multiple values in one
00:15 - string let's say you had a list of items
00:19 - you don't want to sit here and make a
00:21 - whole bunch of
00:24 - variables holding your items like H you
00:28 - don't want to sit there and do this all
00:30 - day so that is where the array is the
00:36 - solution now over here I have written
00:39 - the three different arrays that are used
00:44 - so the first one is called indexed
00:46 - arrays and index arrays are arrays with
00:50 - numeric
00:52 - index so let's go ahead and show you an
00:55 - example of
00:56 - that so to make an array you have to
01:00 - have a
01:02 - variable equal to the array
01:07 - function and then you will have your
01:10 - different values or strings that you
01:12 - want inside the parentheses so I'm going
01:15 - to
01:16 - have
01:17 - [Music]
01:20 - Sam
01:24 - Anna
01:28 - Isaiah and
01:30 - and
01:33 - that's
01:34 - so and we can
01:36 - store multiple
01:39 - values as many as many values as we
01:43 - want
01:46 - so that is how the index arrays look
01:49 - like now let's say we wanted
01:52 - to print out a
01:55 - specific index from the array now
02:00 - know that index starts with the number
02:03 - zero and so on and so forth 1 2 3 4 5 or
02:09 - whatever so in this case Sam is number
02:13 - zero and is number one and Isaiah is
02:15 - number
02:16 - two that is how it works so let's say I
02:19 - want
02:20 - [Music]
02:21 - to call a specific index so I'm going to
02:25 - call Anna and Anna is number one so save
02:29 - that
02:33 - and let's go over to Local
02:37 - Host
02:39 - fort.
02:41 - [Music]
02:46 - PHP and then we have
02:49 - Anna her index number is
02:54 - one so if we wanted to print out
02:57 - everything in there we can just do it
03:00 - there's two ways to do this the first
03:02 - way is like this dot no you
03:05 - just call the array function I mean the
03:10 - array
03:12 - variable then we have inex one dot it's
03:16 - called the last
03:18 - one which is not one
03:22 - zero
03:24 - and
03:26 - three two so let's save that
03:31 - [Music]
03:33 - and there you go we have Anna Sam and
03:38 - Isaiah and then the second way to do to
03:43 - call all of them is by looping through
03:48 - the array and to do this first you must
03:52 - find the length of the array and to find
03:56 - the length of the array you would do a
03:59 - varable Ray equals to the function
04:05 - count and inside the parentheses you
04:08 - will have your array
04:11 - variable and then you will do a for Loop
04:14 - for
04:17 - this and you will have a variable I'll
04:21 - have a equals
04:24 - to0 and then the variable a is less than
04:28 - the length of the
04:33 - array and last but not least
04:36 - [Music]
04:38 - A++ now all we have to do is just say
04:42 - Echo I'm going to say Echo
04:48 - names
04:51 - dot the array variable
04:55 - name and the variable
04:58 - a
05:00 - now let's save
05:03 - that
05:05 - and there you go so we got name Sam name
05:09 - Anna and name
05:12 - Isaiah so that is how the index array
05:17 - works now let's talk about the
05:20 - associative arrays now this array is is
05:24 - with name
05:28 - keys so let me show show you that
05:31 - one and erase this it's not
05:35 - erasing
05:37 - erase and then this
05:40 - have um
05:45 - fry equals
05:48 - to
05:51 - Ray now here's the
05:53 - difference now we're going to have a
05:55 - name right and we're going to assign it
05:58 - to a Val
06:00 - so to assign it we just have this the
06:03 - equal sign and the greater than sign
06:08 - then the value that's going to be
06:11 - assigned to his name Sally is the number
06:15 - 17 and then we will have another
06:20 - name um
06:23 - the
06:26 - D and that name is going to be assigned
06:29 - to
06:30 - the number
06:31 - [Music]
06:34 - 20 and you can add more if you want to
06:38 - and
06:39 - then let's go ahead and
06:44 - Echo
06:50 - I and instead of calling the index like
06:54 - we did with the um the index arrays you
06:57 - call it by
07:00 - name so I'm going to call
07:05 - Sally and it is going to tell me your
07:08 - age so let me just have a a little text
07:11 - here that says
07:13 - Sally
07:21 - is it's want to say Sally is 17 now
07:25 - Watch What Happens
07:28 - here
07:31 - and then it says onl we have
07:34 - unexpected
07:40 - right okay so we missed the dot
07:44 - here and let's go ahead and refresh so
07:49 - now it says Sally is
07:51 - 17 how does it know Sally is 17
07:56 - because it
07:58 - called
08:00 - it called um the number 17 by her
08:06 - name then we could do the same thing for
08:11 - DD so we have
08:15 - dot
08:18 - d
08:20 - is
08:25 - do
08:27 - D and save that
08:32 - and and it says DD is
08:36 - 20 and that is how the
08:39 - associative array works so it is
08:44 - assigned a
08:46 - key and when we call the
08:50 - name it basically brings out the
08:56 - key so
08:58 - now let's say if we wanted
09:00 - [Music]
09:02 - to to look through this so we will do
09:06 - count function so just call C
09:10 - [Music]
09:12 - count and I'll have my
09:15 - variable and then for this we are not
09:18 - going to use a for Loop we are going to
09:20 - use another loop that's called for each
09:22 - Loop now yeah you're probably thinking
09:26 - why didn't she teach about the for each
09:29 - Loop when she was teaching about the
09:31 - different Loops now the reason for that
09:33 - is because before each Loop is only used
09:36 - for arrays so that is why I wanted to
09:39 - teach it in this tutorial since we are
09:41 - talking about Rel so the four each Loop
09:45 - goes like this for
09:47 - [Music]
09:51 - each and then you will have your array
09:55 - name which is
09:58 - fry
09:59 - [Applause]
10:02 - as and you will have make up a variable
10:06 - I'll call this
10:08 - G and we
10:10 - will have the
10:12 - key and then last part it have G
10:18 - value then we will go ahead and
10:23 - Echo and let me just say something WR
10:26 - your
10:28 - name
10:30 - dot the variable
10:32 - [Music]
10:34 - g
10:36 - [Music]
10:37 - dot
10:41 - h dot the variable G and you'll say
10:46 - [Music]
10:47 - Val so let's go ahead and save
10:54 - this and we have name
10:57 - Sally age 7
11:00 - name
11:01 - DD age
11:07 - 20 so that is how you can
11:12 - loop with the associative
11:16 - array now the last array we want to
11:19 - learn about is called
11:23 - multidimensional
11:25 - arrays and this array contains one or
11:28 - more
11:30 - arrays so let me go ahead and show you
11:32 - what I am talking
11:34 - [Music]
11:35 - about so we have let's call this air
11:41 - equals to
11:44 - array now inside this array is going to
11:48 - be multiple arrays so I'm just going to
11:53 - have two you can make as many arrays as
11:57 - you want to
11:59 - so we have
12:01 - Ray then in here I'm just going to
12:05 - have um
12:06 - [Music]
12:08 - H
12:12 - cheese
12:14 - and cake then just going to copy and
12:19 - paste
12:20 - this and I'm going to have
12:28 - orange
12:33 - Ginger and
12:36 - tea and we're going to have
12:40 - [Music]
12:43 - soda um
12:44 - [Music]
12:49 - coffee
12:51 - [Music]
12:54 - chips and over here we're going to have
12:58 - soap
13:01 - and we're going to have
13:05 - Al and we're going to have
13:09 - great so that is what the
13:12 - multi-dimensional array looks like so
13:16 - it's inside of an array and it has
13:20 - multiple
13:22 - arrays so to Echo these
13:26 - arrays you must
13:29 - [Music]
13:30 - you Echo you call the array name air and
13:35 - you're going to have
13:37 - two index index so it's
13:43 - 0o one so this right here is
13:47 - zero then one then two then three so I'm
13:52 - just going to call the first one for the
13:55 - first array then I'm going just go ahead
13:57 - and call
13:59 - the second one for the second array
14:04 - and that one is going to be one
14:08 - one then going to
14:12 - call the third
14:16 - one um that one is going to
14:21 - be um two
14:25 - one well that's the second one I said
14:27 - the third one my
14:30 - M and then we have so we have zero one
14:34 - two and the third one which is the last
14:36 - one so do
14:40 - air and we're going to have
14:44 - one so let's go ahead and save
14:48 - it
14:50 - and expecting okay this is something I
14:54 - do all the time I don't know why but
14:57 - you're supposed to have a comma in
14:59 - instead and I'm always
15:04 - having I'm always
15:06 - mixing it up
15:12 - with okay
15:14 - so you have the comments so save
15:20 - that
15:21 - and and
15:24 - cheese which is in the first array
15:29 - and that's number
15:32 - one and then we have ginger which is in
15:37 - the
15:38 - second and that's one now excuse me for
15:44 - saying for a second so
15:47 - zero row zero array
15:51 - one and array two it
15:55 - called
15:57 - coffee and then last one which is
16:03 - Apple so that is how the
16:06 - multi-dimensional array
16:08 - works so it's basically a side the array
16:12 - and then we have multiple arrays you can
16:16 - have as many as you want a th 4,000 or
16:22 - you know just exaggerating but just the
16:25 - name of you you can have a lot of arrays
16:27 - inside
16:29 - that one
16:32 - array
16:33 - so that is how the different arrays are
16:41 - in
16:42 - PHP so that's it for this tutorial on
16:46 - the next tutorial I will be teaching you
16:49 - about sorting arrays
