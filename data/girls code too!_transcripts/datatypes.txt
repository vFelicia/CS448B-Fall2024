00:00 - hello everyone and welcome back to
00:02 - another tutorial with me and in today's
00:06 - tutorial we will be learning about data
00:09 - types in PHP as you can see here I have
00:13 - listed the different data types that
00:15 - variables can store the first one you
00:21 - should be familiar with as we have
00:24 - learned it on the last tutorial what we
00:27 - were learning about parables and we such
00:30 - dreams where a sequence of characters or
00:34 - text text in between double or single
00:39 - calls and then we learn about values
00:44 - values are basically numbers so you see
00:51 - integer which is a non decimal number by
00:55 - 5880 four or you can have a float number
01:00 - which is a number with a decimal like
01:03 - five point 89 and then we have something
01:07 - called will leave only represents two
01:11 - possible States either it's true or it's
01:14 - false and then we have something called
01:17 - object which stores data and information
01:22 - we will not want over objects in this
01:25 - tutorial but on the next torial we will
01:28 - go over objects because objects have to
01:33 - be declared and the last data type is
01:37 - called in la an array stores multiple
01:40 - values in one single bearable now let's
01:46 - go over here and lets just make an
01:50 - example of each data type let's say we
01:54 - had a ver phone ha um gee and it's equal
02:02 - to a stream that says hi my name is
02:09 - Sally
02:11 - and this right here is the street and
02:16 - that's that we have another variable r
02:22 - which is equal to a value a number let's
02:30 - just have an integer negative 4 then we
02:36 - can also have another variable that
02:39 - holds a floating number now are the e
02:43 - equal to 70 7.9 and then let's have
02:51 - another variable and this bearable is
02:54 - going to hold on abilene which means
02:58 - true or false less time we want to
03:01 - prepare two numbers we want to see if
03:04 - this number is ready than that number
03:07 - let's say 32 is greater than 45 which is
03:13 - Matt truth is going to raise my boss and
03:16 - that's just still an array with an array
03:20 - you have a verra phone and they're
03:24 - holding t equal it to array and you can
03:33 - hear either have a string inside the
03:35 - array or any type of data type inside
03:39 - the bracket now let's say I want to have
03:44 - a string with a and then I have another
03:49 - string B and then I have another screen
03:53 - see now let's go ahead and label these
04:01 - and this right here is a floats voting
04:06 - member and this right here is an integer
04:13 - and this right here
04:17 - is oops get this after all I'm going to
04:24 - stay lean beer bowling this one is total
04:32 - number and this right here is an integer
04:42 - now instead of echoing all these
04:47 - variables they're going to use something
04:49 - called bar done and this basic be
04:54 - returns the data type and the value of
04:59 - the variable so we have multiple
05:03 - variables so we're going to start right
05:08 - there one common second variable I'm but
05:14 - then go on point one and fickle and
05:24 - let's change this to it a and we will
05:31 - save this and only test it out we will
05:34 - see that it returns the data type and
05:40 - the value of Matt um bearable so let's
05:47 - go ahead and head over to our lil Phobos
05:54 - /t UT PHP into it and as you can see it
06:01 - tells us that this right here is a
06:07 - string and it has 16 letters basically
06:12 - this right here is an integer negative
06:16 - form this right here is a floating
06:18 - govern seventy seven point nine this
06:22 - right here it's a believe such as equals
06:24 - four false and this right here is in an
06:28 - array
06:30 - which has the streams a B and C so that
06:37 - is what that those aren't the different
06:39 - data types in PA tree that's just one
06:46 - more example you could just use one
06:48 - their phone and this variable can be u u
06:53 - equals 2 s try believe I must say 1.9 is
07:02 - equal to 29 bar huh and our terrible
07:12 - name which is you do and we stayed this
07:17 - hop over that to our logos very French
07:21 - and it says bullying us the ool box
07:28 - because it's not true 129 is not equal
07:34 - to 20 min so that right there is two
07:40 - different data types that variables can
07:44 - store so that is it for this tutorial
07:48 - thank you guys for watching and I will
07:51 - see you on the next torial
