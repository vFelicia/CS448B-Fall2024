00:00 - hey guys this is Stephanie and welcome
00:03 - back to another tutorial with me in
00:05 - today's tutorial we will be learning how
00:07 - to select update and delete from our
00:11 - table so let's begin
00:13 - so in order to select from our tempo the
00:18 - first thing we'll do is I'm going to
00:20 - make a bear phone I'm listening this SQL
00:25 - and we're going to select email run the
00:36 - table me so I said select the email from
00:41 - disable me now we're going to say SQL
00:45 - cue another variable and I'm going to
00:49 - say my SQL I query connect and SQL now I
01:06 - am going to make another variable and
01:09 - I'm going to call this bearable row
01:13 - equal to MySQL I num rows so it's going
01:25 - to get the number of rows in the table
01:28 - so in parentheses SQL queue burnable
01:33 - goes in there now we will make an if
01:36 - statement and we will say if row what do
01:43 - we want to do well we're going to make a
01:45 - while loop and we're going to say well I
01:52 - want to make a variable call the gene
01:56 - equal to MySQL I fetch Assoc and in the
02:06 - parenthesis we're going to put the
02:08 - bearable SQL cue
02:13 - now while this is true we want to go
02:17 - ahead and echo
02:20 - email on file dot Eugene and you know
02:36 - since we want to get the email
02:38 - information so that's why I had to save
02:42 - that and now I'm just going to refresh
02:48 - and it says email on file
02:52 - Sammy afv.com and if we go to our local
02:56 - host PHP myadmin
02:58 - we will see that the email that's on
03:00 - file to Sammy
03:01 - al hakam and that is the email that is
03:05 - being displayed how easy was that
03:09 - so let's go back over here and let me
03:12 - explain to you what I did so I select
03:16 - the email from the table me and then I
03:21 - got the query I connected to the query
03:25 - and then I main arm of the arm bone that
03:29 - has that hold the number of rows from
03:33 - the table and then we said if row while
03:40 - this is true while the variable G is
03:43 - equal to MySQL I fetch Assoc equal the
03:50 - email that's on file simple as that so
03:56 - that's it for the Select now let's go
04:00 - ahead and learn about updates so let's
04:05 - say that we want to change our email
04:07 - address to sally yahoo.com instead of
04:12 - sammy at yahoo.com how would we do that
04:15 - well that's easy all you have to do is
04:18 - make a bearable and I'm going to need
04:21 - this SQL I'm just trying to stay
04:24 - consistent
04:25 - and I will do update update once update
04:33 - the table me where the email well
04:41 - actually not ready you know bar update
04:45 - the table me and set the email equal to
04:51 - Sally at yahoo.com and now we would do
05:01 - another bedroom is still q equal to
05:05 - MySQL I Larry and we'll have a connect
05:16 - bearable and we will have SQL vo now we
05:23 - will say if SQL Q if the table has been
05:31 - updated what do we want to say once and
05:34 - say echo updated else if it's not
05:42 - updated the bear well the function died
05:46 - and just want to say not updated not my
05:54 - SQL I connect error and the connect
06:04 - miracle so save that and now we can go
06:10 - ahead and refresh and it says updated so
06:17 - let's we'll see if it has been updated
06:18 - now for now we have Sammy and Yahoo calm
06:24 - but if we go ahead and refresh this page
06:29 - we will now get Sally at yahoo.com so
06:35 - hope you guys see how that happened and
06:38 - that was so cool that was really really
06:41 - cool so that is how update the
06:45 - information in the table now the last
06:49 - thing we want to learn about is how to
06:51 - delete from the table
06:54 - and we can just go ahead and erase this
06:59 - and this time we're just going to type
07:01 - in to meet an order to delete it's the
07:05 - same thing as an update but different so
07:08 - I'm just going to put delete we wanted
07:15 - to delete from let me everything from
07:22 - from where the table mean winner the ID
07:32 - in this case this is the only
07:35 - information we have and in this case the
07:37 - idea is equal to one so lets going to
07:40 - delete where the ID is equal to one
07:42 - right so now there's just four semicolon
07:47 - and apparently we do not need that so
07:52 - I'm just erase that and now let's just
07:55 - make a second variable SQL Q equal to
07:58 - MySQL I queried Connect bearable and SQL
08:11 - so if that's your cue so if the
08:19 - information has been deleted from the
08:20 - table what do we want to do he wants to
08:25 - go ahead and echo they need it else
08:38 - nice they need it not MySQL I connect
08:50 - error okay I don't know what just
08:54 - happened there
08:56 - connect error and the connect bearable
09:05 - okay so now let's just go ahead and save
09:09 - this and now you can go ahead and
09:13 - refresh this page right here sorry fresh
09:18 - and hopefully no errors think that so
09:21 - it's not deleted now let's go check out
09:25 - to see if it's ready to need it so let's
09:29 - just click the arm table one more time
09:33 - mmm any what so the information has been
09:38 - permanently permanently deleted from the
09:42 - table how cool was that guys how cool
09:46 - was that
09:47 - so the table so the information in the
09:50 - table has been and needed and that is
09:54 - how you delete information from the
09:56 - table so in this tutorial we learn how
09:59 - to select from the table insert into
10:02 - well not insert but select on the table
10:05 - update from the table and the meats from
10:08 - the table so thank you guys for watching
10:12 - that was such a good video and I will
10:15 - see you guys on the next tutorial bye
