00:13 - with cookies cookies identify our user
00:17 - let's show you an example of a cookie
00:20 - lets everyone to see if cooking it in

00:31 - for the if statement is set cookie and
00:40 - put a primary type of test and so I'm
00:46 - going to stay if count cooking is
00:55 - greater than zero echo cookie is in a
01:10 - house I'm gonna say trigger Aaron
01:22 - cooking is not

01:49 - is enable on the computer now you can
01:55 - also be travel cookie semester day I
02:01 - have a barebone you user equals to
02:09 - Amanda then we have another variable age
02:16 - equals 2 23 and then set cookie to the
02:30 - verbal user into the variable age then
02:40 - i'm going to write an if statement and
02:43 - we're going to say if cookie snow if the
02:55 - confuse that just just go ahead an echo
03:00 - cookie the variable user and also the
03:17 - variable age else if there's a problem
03:24 - this go ahead and use the function died
03:28 - and we're going to say hmm i'm able well

06:11 - these semicolons excuse me for that and
06:17 - cookie is now this table so i hope you
06:23 - seeing how we did that so first thing we
06:26 - did was we try Kentucky with an able and
06:30 - then we need on retrying the cookie and
06:34 - then I now we dis abled the cookie now
06:41 - the next thing we want to learn about is
06:43 - sessions the session stored information
06:47 - in variables to be used across multiple
06:50 - pages and unlike a cookie it does not
06:54 - store on the user's group here so let's
06:58 - go ahead and show you an example of
07:00 - sessions so you must always start the
07:03 - session before you do any other HTML
07:08 - tags or anything else so start the
07:11 - session so and i'm going to have a
07:19 - session variable session and this is
07:27 - going to equal to my me stephanie and
07:34 - the session is me and I'm going to write
07:41 - an if statement and I'm going to say if
07:48 - if session
07:52 - HYFR okay else nah I'm just going to say
08:07 - fat vessel and refresh and we got ok so
08:15 - the session is on it's good now what we
08:23 - want to do is basically get my session
08:27 - name from another page on another page
08:30 - I'm going to make a new file new file
08:36 - save as and B dot p 90 save with a B dot
08:46 - PHP and basically we're going to call my
08:53 - name um from this page to that page so
09:00 - okay PHP ty start the session also in
09:07 - this page and i'm just going to echo
09:17 - your thing is don't forget the semicolon
09:24 - your name is session name now we save
09:41 - that ms goes to B dot PHP this time
09:47 - holnok goals / / b dot PHP
09:57 - and it says your name is Stephanie how
10:01 - hole is up so that is how the session
10:05 - words so what I did was I basically it
10:10 - basically knows that there is a session
10:12 - um started and I just said call the
10:17 - session name and call my mate Stephanie
10:23 - and you can also destroy a session using
10:31 - a session destroy function you can use
10:38 - that one and the session on set function
10:46 - so leave some function destroy the
10:49 - function I mean destroy the sessions so
10:53 - let's say you logged out of the website
10:56 - or something then it will go ahead and
10:58 - destroy that that session so that is it
