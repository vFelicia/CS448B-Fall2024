00:00 - hi everyone is Stephanie and welcome to
00:03 - another tutorial with me in today's
00:06 - tutorial we will be going over date and
00:10 - time in PHP so let's begin so in order
00:16 - to display the date or the time you will
00:19 - need the date function so I'm just going
00:23 - to echo I'm going to use the date
00:26 - function and inside the parameters you
00:31 - gotta put the double or single quotes in
00:33 - between the double or single hold you
00:36 - will format the date so um you can
00:41 - format the date anyway you want to i'm
00:43 - going to start with the letter L which
00:45 - is form the day of the week m which is
00:49 - for the month d which is for the day of
00:53 - the month and y which is for a year and
00:57 - i'm going to save that go over to
01:04 - localhost / / touch dot PHP it says
01:16 - wednesday 830 116 so the day is wrong in
01:26 - this case because today is not one play
01:30 - and today is that the 31st so today is
01:35 - tuesday the 30th so the reason why is
01:39 - giving us the wrong date because arm the
01:46 - current date comes from the server
01:50 - whatever your server is from whatever
01:54 - country is from that's the current date
01:57 - is going to get so to change that and to
02:04 - change it to your default timezone you
02:09 - will do something in my
02:12 - underscored default underscored times on
02:21 - on the score set so in this case you
02:25 - will set your time zone and i'm going to
02:29 - set my time them to America forward
02:35 - slash New York or this is my time zone
02:42 - and I'm going to save that refresh and
02:56 - then we'll get an invalid okay okay
02:58 - because America has to be capitalized
03:01 - and also no York has to be spaced so
03:08 - we're going to put it under score here
03:10 - and say that in french and we get
03:18 - tuesday 830 16 which is the correct date
03:22 - for today now that is for the date let's
03:28 - say we want to get the time so I'm just
03:32 - want to keep this or can have my default
03:36 - timezone and I am just going to erase
03:40 - this to get the time you will have h
03:44 - which is for the hour I which is for the
03:48 - minute s which toured a second and a
03:52 - rich is for a.m. or p.m. and you save
03:56 - that refresh and you get 939 48 p.m. now
04:13 - we can also change the time zone if we
04:15 - want to so I will say something my Los
04:20 - Angeles
04:24 - save your fresh and we get 6 40 15
04:34 - remember Los Angeles is three hours
04:37 - behind so that is the time zone and you
04:45 - can also mix this up so we can say
04:48 - something like we have a year we can
04:52 - have the month if you have a day and we
04:56 - can have the day of the week you can go
05:04 - ahead and refresh so we have the best of
05:10 - both worlds we have the date and we have
05:14 - the time and you also can't format this
05:20 - in any way you can use for / but each
05:24 - one you can use the dot you can use the
05:28 - ash thread or whatever is best for you
05:32 - now let's say we want it to create the
05:37 - date or the time so in order to do that
05:43 - I'll erase this I'm going to make a
05:46 - bearable oo m and n is going to equal to
05:54 - MKE time function and this allows you to
05:59 - create the date and it returns the unix
06:03 - time stamp so i could create my date and
06:09 - my time so i'll go ahead and i'll go
06:16 - ahead and have different numbers you
06:19 - want to have six numbers want to have 11
06:25 - 2254 won 20-17
06:35 - and I will have 30 so i have 1 2 3 4 5 6
06:44 - 6 numbers so now i will go ahead and
06:48 - echo date and the former i want to i
06:56 - want this to be n is l and the y comma
07:05 - the variable in so control save and we
07:13 - will refresh this and basically this is
07:19 - the date that we created sunday august
07:23 - 1731 so there you have it so that is how
07:30 - we create our date now let's say we want
07:37 - it to create a date from the string now
07:42 - this will be a little bit different so
07:46 - I'm going to have a bearable all s SS
07:50 - going to equal to a function str2 time
07:56 - and so what this function does it takes
08:01 - the string and convert it to you next
08:05 - time so i'm going to write the word
08:09 - tomorrow and what I want is for it to
08:21 - give me the date or tomorrow so echo
08:24 - date meet the year the month the day and
08:36 - the day of the week so control save well
08:42 - actually call me and you will add your
08:46 - bearable
08:48 - so save that and refresh and tomorrow
08:55 - will be wednesday the 31st and i can
09:00 - also say give me the date for a hundred
09:05 - days from that 100 days so 100 days from
09:12 - now will be 16 1208 on the third day and
09:21 - we can do 500 days 500 days from now and
09:32 - we will get 1801 12 friday and that is
09:40 - how that works that's how you create a
09:44 - date from spring so that is it for this
09:48 - tutorial we learn about the beads and a
09:52 - time of PHP so I hope you guys learned a
09:55 - lot and I will see you guys on the next
09:59 - tutorial bye
