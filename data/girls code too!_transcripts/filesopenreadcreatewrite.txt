00:00 - hi everyone is Stephanie and welcome to
00:03 - another tutorial with me it's a day so
00:07 - real we are going to be learning how to
00:09 - open create and write two files so let's
00:15 - begin so let's say I have a file in this
00:20 - case I have a text file you can have a
00:23 - PHP HTML CSS whatever file you have so i
00:29 - have a my 9 dot txt file and so what i
00:35 - want to do is open that file and read it
00:40 - so to do that I will have a variable R
00:44 - equal to the function f open and this
00:49 - function basically opens the file so it
00:55 - takes two parameters and for the first
00:57 - parameter is going to see your file name
01:01 - the second parameter is going to take
01:05 - the mold that you want your files to be
01:09 - opening and I'm wear shoes are and if
01:13 - you don't know when the moves are these
01:16 - are the different the different modes
01:18 - that you can open your file in so you
01:23 - can over your file for read-only if you
01:25 - just want to read your file you go over
01:28 - your file for right only if you're going
01:30 - to write your file create a new file or
01:34 - whatever you are you're going to use so
01:37 - these are the different modes now what
01:41 - I'm going to do is just echo free1 shin
01:51 - afraid basically reads my file it's
01:55 - going to take two parameters so the
01:58 - first parameter is going to take the
02:00 - function are not function but the
02:03 - variable are sorry and then it's going
02:06 - to take file size
02:11 - and my file name and basically it it
02:20 - finds how many bytes the file has and
02:27 - then the last thing I'm going to do is
02:29 - close your file after you have opened it
02:34 - because it's good practice that you do
02:37 - close your file you don't want to sit
02:39 - there and have it open so it's going to
02:44 - take the are variable and so we're going
02:48 - to save that and let's head over to
02:54 - local homes type dot PHP and as you can
03:00 - see it opened a file and it allowed me
03:05 - to read the file read what's in that
03:09 - file so that is how you open the file
03:16 - you open and read the file now let's say
03:20 - I want to go ahead and create a file to
03:25 - do this I will have my bamboo just i
03:29 - have t equals to F open and this is the
03:35 - same function that creates a file and
03:39 - this one's to take two parameters i'm
03:42 - going to call this file um I Rock dot
03:50 - PHP and we're going to use W create that
03:57 - file and then we're going to have an if
04:01 - statement as I want to test this out so
04:05 - I'm going to say if F right and i forgot
04:14 - my teeth f right and this is just going
04:19 - to take some parameters Oh
04:22 - so it's going to take the variable-g
04:25 - file size and the file name which is I
04:34 - rock dot PHP so if that's true if the
04:41 - file has been created echo file created
04:50 - else echo file not created save that and
05:09 - let's go ahead and refresh this and it
05:14 - says file creative is to find out if
05:18 - your file is really created just go to
05:21 - file open and just search for the file I
05:32 - just created which was I rock dot PHP
05:35 - and the file has been created now you
05:39 - see that as zero because we have nothing
05:42 - on the screen now here comes the writing
05:49 - to that file so let's say I went to
05:52 - write to that file so I'm just going to
05:55 - make another variable and I'm going to
05:58 - name this T equal to the text i want it
06:02 - i want to be there what cookies i want
06:12 - cookies and then another thing we're
06:17 - going to do is just erase the file size
06:20 - and we're just going to add any variable
06:24 - T and mmm sentence
06:32 - added sessoms added then i'm going to
06:46 - put for this one sentence not added and
07:03 - let's go ahead and refresh and its asset
07:10 - is added now if we go here and we get
07:14 - this this message this file has been
07:18 - modified by another program do you want
07:21 - to reload it and click yes and as you
07:25 - can see we wrote to that file so that is
07:32 - how you write to the file so first thing
07:37 - is you open the file then you write the
07:40 - text that you want and then we did an if
07:44 - statement if the film we have written to
07:48 - the file if this is true uncle sentence
07:52 - that is added and then else acquisitions
07:55 - not added so that is it for this
07:59 - tutorial thank you guys for watching and
08:01 - I will see you guys on the next tutorial
