00:00 - hello everyone this is stephanie and
00:02 - welcome back to another tutorial with me
00:05 - in today's tutorial we will be learning
00:08 - how to register our users on the last
00:11 - tutorial I showed you how to logon are
00:14 - using now this time let's learn how to
00:17 - register our user so um everything looks
00:21 - quite the same I just change the name to
00:24 - register a value to register and what
00:28 - else tightly and that's about it so
00:32 - let's go ahead and begin right side of
00:35 - my car the first thing I'm going to do
00:37 - is require our we find our connection
00:44 - page view and then dot PHP now let's
00:51 - begin our if statement if is that again
01:00 - what is set if our form is submitted so
01:06 - if they can make the register button
01:10 - what do we want to happen but first we
01:14 - want to go ahead and select from our
01:18 - table so so let everything from the
01:23 - table mean where the email is equal to
01:33 - the email that they input
01:42 - now let's go make our slq member mysql i
01:49 - query and arthur night now go and ask
01:58 - you out there now we will go ahead and
02:03 - make our and we'll make another if thing
02:07 - and we will say if not empty so remember
02:14 - all of this is supposed to be true so if
02:17 - not give the hose email and mysql I
02:28 - fetch assoc ask you if it's less than 1
02:39 - so this has to be less than 1 whatever
02:44 - the email that they register with must
02:46 - not be existed and the last one is to
02:52 - check for valid email Elton bar post
03:00 - email common filter validate email and
03:10 - this should not eat little false ok now
03:18 - we have that part so if that is true
03:21 - what do we want to do the first thing we
03:23 - wants to do is make a ver room and i'm
03:25 - going to call it I q equal to we want to
03:30 - insert into the table me set the email
03:40 - equal to the email that they are trying
03:44 - to register with house hmmm
03:52 - and now we will do our theory I to you
03:57 - is iOS 4i now fetch the query and
04:10 - connect them more and IQ come that is
04:17 - what we learn and then we're just going
04:19 - to do something like I hope you are now
04:26 - register simple as that so if everything
04:33 - is on equal to true over here we're
04:37 - going to go ahead and insert the email
04:40 - that me posted to the table and we're
04:44 - going to get the query and we're going
04:47 - to equal you are not registered so
04:51 - that's it for that part now someone to
04:55 - make an if statement and want to say if
04:58 - it is empty um the email input what I
05:08 - want to do we want to make a variable r
05:11 - equal to provide email if that's not a
05:20 - problem else if mysql I what actually no
05:27 - we'll just do you know what I'll just
05:30 - copy this right here coffee and pace and
05:41 - change this to true so if it's not even
05:48 - true mmm 11 go the r is equal to not a
05:55 - valid human
05:59 - and if you put that a right there and if
06:04 - that's not the problem let's say that
06:07 - the email already exists so MySQL I
06:13 - fetch assoc and we're going to have the
06:21 - barrel as he look you if it's greater
06:26 - than zero then we're going to say email
06:33 - already like this in that it will not
06:42 - now the last thing on this page who
06:45 - wants to do is the same thing we did for
06:48 - login is our PHP syntax and echo the
06:55 - variable are so if there is any error
06:59 - message then our message will pop up
07:02 - right next to the aschburgh and now we
07:05 - can go ahead and save this and that's
07:09 - also why new connect page and tell it
07:13 - that we will have a bamboo are that is
07:17 - going to hold our a message now they can
07:20 - go ahead and save this and let's go to
07:24 - our new me PHP page and i'm just going
07:30 - to refresh and now we can go ahead and
07:36 - try to register so for the first example
07:40 - i am not going to put anything and i'm
07:43 - just going to submit the form and if
07:48 - that's provide email now let me type in
07:51 - a in them email register not a valid
07:58 - email next let's try to let's try some
08:07 - on register with this evil remember we
08:10 - saw this email this is the one that is
08:12 - red
08:13 - sister now let's see what happened and
08:19 - it still goes in oops we did something
08:23 - wrong let's go back here okay here's the
08:31 - thing guys instead of doing greater than
08:35 - zero let's just do not equal to 1 so now
08:40 - I'm going to save this and because just
08:44 - refresh this page and now says email
08:48 - already exists so let's just make sure
08:51 - it did not register again I go to PHP my
08:56 - admin and let's go to the database big
09:06 - one let's just go to me and it did not
09:13 - thank God okay so now what we are going
09:16 - to do is try to register with an email
09:20 - that is not on file like this one right
09:23 - here and let's go ahead and register and
09:27 - it says you are now register so let's
09:31 - listen for registered crossing fingers
