00:00 - hi everyone this is stephanie and
00:03 - welcome back to another tutorial with me
00:05 - in today's tutorial we will be going
00:08 - over form validation and BHP in order
00:13 - for us to begin form validation we must
00:16 - use something called PHP filters and
00:19 - PHP filters are used to validate or
00:23 - sanitize your data
00:27 - now there are two things there's
00:30 - validating data and they're sanitized
00:32 - and data these are two different things
00:35 - the validating data determines if the
00:38 - data is in proper form while the
00:41 - sanitizing data removes any illegal
00:45 - character from the data so i am going to
00:49 - show you an example of validating and
00:51 - sanitizing your data so let's begin guys
00:56 - first thing is first i made a little
00:59 - form and all the required for you to
01:01 - have an email
01:03 - and that is it
01:06 - so this is how it looks just like that
01:10 - simple as that in um email input and a
01:14 - submit button
01:16 - along with the ashford
01:19 - so now let's go over here and begin so i
01:24 - have started the session and
01:26 - i have made a bearable see that is going
01:31 - to hold on my error message if i have
01:35 - one so the first thing is first i'm
01:37 - going to show you what the validate the
01:39 - validating that I looks like but I want
01:42 - to make an if statement and say if
01:46 - the form have been
01:50 - submitted
01:53 - [Music]
01:54 - so if the one has been submitted what I
01:58 - wanted to do if we're going to make
02:01 - another if statement and I just want to
02:04 - make sure that it's not empty
02:08 - the input itself is not in
02:13 - and
02:14 - i also want to validate the email to
02:20 - make sure that it's a valid email so I'm
02:23 - a right not
02:25 - filter
02:28 - bar
02:30 - and the function will take pose
02:36 - [Music]
02:38 - email
02:39 - the email input get then it will take
02:43 - filter
02:46 - validate
02:48 - [Music]
02:51 - email
02:53 - this and if this is not equal to false
02:58 - okay so now if everything is true is the
03:02 - Pope if the input is not empty and if um
03:07 - whatever they cite is a valid email that
03:11 - what do we want to do you want to go
03:13 - ahead and start and make a session
03:17 - variable and i'm going to call this um
03:21 - in
03:23 - input
03:25 - equal to
03:27 - pose
03:31 - email
03:33 - if then we're just going to go ahead and
03:36 - echo
03:38 - your
03:40 - email is
03:43 - [Music]
03:45 - dot
03:47 - and a session variable name
03:52 - which is input and that is all for that
03:58 - far now if they aren't if there are any
04:02 - errors let's say if
04:06 - if the input is empty then what do we
04:10 - want to do
04:11 - suppose
04:14 - email
04:16 - that bear foe that we made see
04:20 - is going to say
04:25 - email is a choir
04:32 - else if if that's not the problem
04:36 - let's say that the email is not a valid
04:41 - email so not filter bar
04:46 - house
04:49 - email
04:52 - omer filter
04:55 - validate email got it for me and if this
04:59 - is not equal to true meaning it's not a
05:02 - valid email
05:06 - then what do we want to do
05:10 - that same bar will see is going to equal
05:13 - to
05:15 - invalid email
05:18 - and that is all and let's just put a lid
05:24 - too ! and we on this who go
05:28 - so we check if the input is not empty
05:32 - and if it's a valid email address
05:36 - so let's go ahead and save this
05:39 - and now i'm going to refresh this page
05:45 - and we have an error on line 35 oh my
05:50 - business
05:51 - how can a v-line 35
05:55 - if of there i
05:58 - see why
06:03 - ok so now it looks like it works so i'm
06:06 - going to submit the form without putting
06:08 - any email and
06:10 - we get email is reported now i'm going
06:14 - to insert a invalid email and
06:17 - I'm ways to submit
06:21 - and it says invalid email now i'll enter
06:26 - a valid email and this time
06:31 - it says your email is whatever i enter
06:36 - and that is how you validate the email
06:40 - you can also validate in Earl let's say
06:45 - I want it on
06:47 - the user to enter a valid girl so I'm
06:51 - not going to change the name of this i'm
06:54 - just going to change placeholder name to
06:57 - URL okay and this time instead of say
07:03 - validate email we're going to say
07:06 - validate URL and
07:10 - same thing goes for here you are
07:15 - URL
07:17 - and valid
07:21 - URL
07:22 - and
07:24 - let's just say the URL is required so in
07:30 - this case you must insert a valid or so
07:33 - let's go ahead to save this and now
07:37 - let's go ahead and refresh
07:41 - and
07:43 - now we ask for invalid Earl now if I
07:46 - insert something like this
07:49 - then it will tell me that if the invalid
07:53 - Earl now I have to enter a valid girl so
07:57 - I'm just going to enter something like
07:59 - um facebook
08:03 - copy
08:05 - and paste it here
08:10 - so submit submit
08:20 - and it says where you know is WWE
08:23 - facebook com well i'm going to say
08:25 - you're all is
08:28 - www.facebook.com
08:29 - and that is how you
08:33 - validate me the arm put input data now
08:39 - let's go ahead and erase all of this and
08:42 - this time we will sanitize a data and
08:46 - i'm going to change this fact to email
08:50 - and
08:53 - now Alice Alice hides data is different
08:57 - all it does it removes any emil
08:59 - character so i'm going to make an if
09:02 - statement again well I probably should
09:05 - raced everything but hello to me post
09:12 - email and
09:15 - we're going to make a pamphlet a equal
09:18 - to
09:21 - filter
09:22 - barn
09:26 - hose
09:30 - hmmm
09:33 - omer
09:35 - filter
09:37 - validate
09:38 - not badly but sanitize
09:42 - [Music]
09:44 - email
09:46 - okay and now we're just going to go
09:49 - ahead and echo
09:51 - that variable a and that is all we have
09:56 - to do for it to sanitize now let's save
09:59 - this and let me show you what happens
10:03 - from now just going to go refresh this
10:07 - page and now i'm going to go ahead and
10:10 - attempt to
10:13 - write a
10:15 - invalid email so i'm just going to write
10:18 - something like 20 g or flash more / um
10:26 - what else should I add semicolon
10:29 - semicolon
10:32 - yahoo.com
10:34 - so I'm just going to copy this and
10:36 - because i want to show you exactly what
10:40 - happens so now i'm going to submit this
10:43 - form and watch what happens
10:47 - submit and
10:49 - as you can see now the email is GG
10:53 - aol.com
10:55 - notice that it took away before a slash
10:58 - the two semicolons remember we have
11:02 - something like this and it removes all
11:06 - of this right here and
11:10 - it corrected the email for us so that is
11:15 - what the sanitized not interest remove
11:18 - the illegal characters that are not
11:21 - supposed to be a part of the email
11:24 - em
11:26 - that is it for this tutorial vised so i
11:30 - hope to see how everything
11:31 - baba validating works and how the
11:34 - sanitizing worms so thank you guys for
11:37 - watching and i will see you guys on the
11:40 - next tutorial bye
