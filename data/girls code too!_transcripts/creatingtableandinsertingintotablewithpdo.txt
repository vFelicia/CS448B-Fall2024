00:00 - hey guys what is up I hope you guys are
00:02 - going great today we are going to be
00:05 - learning how to create table and how to
00:08 - insert into table using PDF so let's go
00:12 - how to get started in order to do this
00:16 - to be on table that's what had to make
00:19 - the same bear broke off the neck and
00:22 - we're gonna have query parentheses and
00:27 - in here we're going to have our double
00:29 - quotes double or single doesn't matter
00:31 - and now let's go ahead and write create
00:34 - [Music]
00:36 - create table and we have to give the
00:40 - table a name so I'm just going to put
00:43 - user and we're going to have another
00:48 - parentheses and inside there is where
00:51 - we're gonna have the list of things we
00:53 - want for our table so the first thing is
00:55 - we want to ID and this is going to be an
00:58 - integer we're gonna have it number six
01:01 - this is going to be auto increment
01:05 - [Music]
01:07 - primary key so we must have a primary
01:12 - key in our table so it's going to be the
01:15 - ID and we're just gonna have one last
01:18 - thing you're just gonna have a name and
01:22 - we can add many more things to our table
01:25 - but for the sake of this tutorial we're
01:28 - going to just have the name and this is
01:31 - going to be our car and this is going to
01:35 - be 255 and not not and that's it so now
01:43 - all we have to do is make our if
01:46 - statement we want to see if our table
01:49 - has been created
01:50 - so if connect if our table has been
01:55 - created
01:56 - echo table created
02:05 - else table not created and I have seen I
02:18 - made a little mistake and then we add
02:21 - the hell and you can go ahead and save
02:24 - so that is all we have to do to create
02:27 - our table now let's go ahead to our
02:29 - browser ms refresh and it says table
02:35 - created now to see if our table has been
02:38 - created let's just go ahead and refresh
02:40 - our PHP myadmin and here is our table
02:49 - user and it has the ID Anthony now we
02:56 - want to go ahead and insert into our
02:58 - table how do we do that that is very
03:02 - easy to do so let's just go ahead and
03:05 - erase all of this and we can have our
03:08 - variable connect let's have our query
03:13 - that's how our double quotes ever going
03:16 - to say insert into our table user where
03:23 - it has the name so for the ID you don't
03:26 - have to do anything it will do that for
03:29 - you and then we're going to write values
03:31 - and the name we're gonna have is we're
03:36 - gonna have this with single quotes and
03:38 - I'm just gonna have my name Stephanie
03:41 - and that is all we have to do now let's
03:45 - just just let's just make our if
03:47 - statement if connect yeah we have
03:55 - inserted into our table echo info and
04:03 - snouted else let's just say echo
04:12 - something went wrong and that's it so
04:20 - now let's just save that and refresh and
04:23 - now says info and story now if we go
04:29 - ahead and refresh our page we should see
04:40 - that we have a user named Stephanie and
04:43 - with the ID one and we can go ahead and
04:46 - add more users if we want it to let's
04:50 - just add one more I want to change to
04:52 - this and to John and now refresh and it
05:03 - still says info inserted refresh this
05:07 - page and then we have it so Johnny ID
05:15 - number two so that is all for this
05:19 - tutorial so we learn how to create our
05:21 - table and insert into our table so I
05:25 - hope you learn from this and I will see
