00:00 - hi everybody this is Stephanie and
00:02 - welcome to another tutorial is seen in a
00:06 - today's tutorial we are going to be
00:08 - learning about PPO so the first thing is
00:12 - I'm going to give you a little
00:13 - introduction about PBL is danced for PhD
00:17 - data objects um it's another way to
00:21 - connect to your database it's very
00:23 - consistent
00:24 - it has a nice interface I can assure you
00:29 - that you will write cleaner and safer
00:31 - cold and it also has many drivers for
00:37 - different drivers like I should say so
00:40 - now let's go ahead and dive into it the
00:45 - first time I showed you how to connect I
00:47 - was using um PHP - an ally so I did
00:53 - something like connect equal to MySQL
00:58 - connect and then I did the parentheses
01:02 - and then I had different variables that
01:08 - hold and you know my host name my
01:12 - username then also my password and then
01:16 - I had for my database but what they do
01:23 - it will be a bit different so let me go
01:27 - ahead anyway since and in order to
01:30 - connect using PDO you will write connect
01:34 - equals to new TVO
01:38 - parenthesis double quote if then we will
01:45 - go ahead and write my sequel : um like
01:53 - that house equals to my host name which
01:58 - is local home if then after the locals
02:03 - you have a semicolon in an F of
02:08 - semicolon you like B be equal to
02:11 - whatever your database is
02:13 - but as right now I do not have a
02:16 - database name so I will skip over and I
02:21 - will have my comma and then I'll have my
02:25 - username Isha's road and then I'll have
02:30 - my password which is equal to nothing
02:33 - and in order to see if we are connected
02:36 - let's make an if statement if connect if
02:43 - we are connected fo you are connected Oh
02:55 - [Music]
02:58 - F oh sorry you are not connected and I
03:09 - was in going to say that and fresh and
03:19 - we have an a message on line two oh my
03:25 - gosh
03:25 - I keep forgetting this L okay so save
03:29 - that and now let's go back and we are
03:35 - connected how easy was that very clean
03:39 - and we don't have to do all that stuff
03:43 - we do with - karai so that is how you
03:47 - basically connect using PBO now on the
03:51 - next tutorial we will learn how to
03:53 - create our database using PDO so I will
04:00 - see you guys on the next tutorial and
04:03 - that's it for today bye
