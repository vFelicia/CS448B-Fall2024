00:02 - tutorial with me in this tutorial this
00:06 - is the continuation for the last story
00:09 - Oh aren't protecting ourselves from SQL
00:13 - injection so last time we lived a login
00:16 - and now this time we're going to do the
00:19 - registration
00:20 - so the registration hopefully it's not
00:23 - too long for you guys so let's go ahead
00:26 - and get started okay so um likely the
00:31 - last time we went to tonight remember -
00:33 - you thing is equal to
00:36 - the link that's right here and this is
00:39 - going to be
00:40 - question mark and for password also
00:45 - don't need anything and question mark
00:48 - okay and we were changing my ass for
00:52 - like kwibi so three pair
00:57 - and you will also go ahead and make the
01:01 - same travel SS and we're going to bind
01:04 - the parameters
01:09 - and in this case we are
01:13 - expecting while MySQL will be expecting
01:16 - two strings so SS and comma and I'll be
01:21 - making this bearable I'll call this a
01:23 - you you and I will call this P e a
01:31 - ok and now let's go ahead and make those
01:34 - barrels and uu equal to
01:38 - pose
01:42 - username with the art
01:45 - and
01:47 - PE a
01:50 - equal to
01:52 - post

01:58 - with an are
02:00 - correct okay everything looks good and
02:03 - this just go ahead and execute
02:06 - execute
02:10 - and now we're good to go
02:13 - and all we have to do is replace the
02:15 - post username our
02:17 - with
02:19 - the available au yo
02:24 - and same thing for password
02:29 - P a and
02:33 - the MySQL I will be changed to the
02:37 - bamboo SF s and we will have
02:43 - betch
02:45 - thank
02:47 - and beneath that
02:50 - and you have to add one more s here
02:54 - so what I'm getting a message saying
02:57 - that we missed something and now um once
03:01 - an insert into members
03:03 - for the values they're going to be
03:06 - substituted for question works so go
03:10 - ahead and delete that that the question
03:13 - one and the comma and the same thing for
03:16 - the password part
03:17 - question mark okay and now we can go
03:22 - over here and do the - without me
03:26 - pair
03:29 - and um
03:32 - now
03:34 - let's see this if we missed any anything
03:37 - okay so not me wants to also bind
03:40 - parameters here so I kill Q
03:44 - by
03:45 - her hand
03:51 - and it expects two strings and will do
03:55 - very well I knew you and
04:00 - another family
04:02 - I don't know
04:04 - Pingu I something like that and then
04:09 - we will go ahead and make those
04:12 - samples I knew u equal to

04:35 - password within part
04:39 - and then let's just go ahead and execute
04:42 - um
04:43 - the i q-- here I'm going to execute
04:50 - make sure you spell everything right or
04:53 - you would get or you will get an error
04:55 - message
04:56 - and so now we are done with that part
04:58 - and all we have to do is just replace
05:02 - thingies and
05:04 - then place it with a new you
05:09 - and this went awesome
05:14 - once when you place it with PE a
05:18 - and
05:20 - my estimate I fetch
05:23 - Assoc now becomes less SS
05:29 - and we're going to fetch
05:34 - and that's all we need to do so let me
