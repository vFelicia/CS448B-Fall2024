00:00 - hi everyone and stephanie and welcome to
00:03 - another tutorial with me in today's
00:06 - tutorial we are going to be learning
00:08 - about include and requires statement in
00:12 - PHP now in food and requirement takes
00:15 - all the texts in code that exist in a
00:18 - file and coffees that ensued the file
00:22 - that includes or requirement now let's
00:26 - go ahead and begin so I'm going to head
00:29 - over to a stop PHP and i'm just going to
00:33 - echo arm hello and let's say that and
00:46 - now we are going to go to our techmount
00:49 - PHP page and what i want to do is
00:53 - include PHP into this page someone have
00:58 - all headed include single quotes or
01:02 - double doesn't matter us dot PHP and i'm
01:07 - going to say that and let's test this
01:11 - out so locals power / type dot PHP and
01:20 - as you can see hello is a suede on the
01:23 - screen and it is from the US dot PHP
01:28 - page that's where the echo hello so all
01:33 - it did was should add the page of stop
01:37 - you PHP page on to touch up PHP and as
01:42 - you can see we are still on localhost
01:44 - dot PHP so that's all it does and the
01:50 - require does the same exact thing so say
01:56 - that refresh and you get the same answer
02:02 - so that is all the influence and require
02:05 - does the only little difference is when
02:09 - they have an error message so when there
02:12 - is the error message in
02:13 - include say if the file does not exist
02:17 - it will tell you that it will give you a
02:20 - warning but it will continue the script
02:23 - with required it will tell you the error
02:26 - message and it will stop the script so
02:31 - that is all for include and inquire so
02:35 - thank you guys for watching and I will
02:37 - see you guys on the next tutorial
