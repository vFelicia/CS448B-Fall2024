00:00 - hi everyone this is stephanie and
00:03 - welcome back to another tutorial with me
00:06 - in today's tutorial we will be learning
00:09 - about loops than PHP loops and PHP
00:14 - there's only three different moves in
00:15 - PHP we have the Wallow rather wallow and
00:19 - the for loop so the 10 basically execute
00:25 - the code while the condition is true and
00:27 - this repeats the cold over and over
00:32 - while the condition is true so let's go
00:35 - ahead and show you an example of what I
00:37 - mean so the wall goal basically starts
00:40 - with Wow parentheses honey buckets and
00:47 - enter oh and turn right here and then
00:51 - your conditions will go inside here so
00:55 - let's say my condition is 44 is equal to
00:58 - 24 and then while that's true echo I
01:07 - love peanut butter and every space
01:17 - peanut butter and save that and if we go
01:28 - to our local host /c you see dot PHP and
01:41 - look what happened so the condition was
01:46 - true so it printed out I love peanut
01:51 - butter a millions of times you can try
01:57 - to scroll you can't really scroll yet
02:01 - because it's still looking for ever and
02:04 - ever and that is what the one who does
02:11 - so
02:12 - let's go to our next loop so we have the
02:17 - dual waddle which executes the code once
02:21 - check the condition and then repeat the
02:24 - loop while the condition is true so
02:28 - let's go ahead and show you an example
02:30 - of that one and with that one you have
02:35 - do then you have credit like Express in
02:39 - turn a phone this is awesome awesome and
02:55 - then you will have a log right here then
03:01 - the condition will be 50 is equal to 50
03:07 - save then let's refresh and look what
03:17 - happens so the condition was true and it
03:24 - echoed this is awesome so that is what
03:30 - the do-while loop does now the last one
03:36 - is called the for loop and the for loop
03:39 - executes a block of code a specified
03:44 - number of times so let's go ahead and
03:50 - show you an example of a for loop so for
04:00 - then you click enter now one thing I
04:05 - should tell you about the for loop now
04:07 - inside parentheses it takes three
04:11 - parameters the first parameter is in it
04:14 - counter which initializes the loop
04:18 - counter value so I'm going to have a fan
04:22 - for e
04:26 - their goal e equals 20 how's that and
04:32 - then the second parameter it takes is
04:35 - called test encounter and this one
04:39 - evaluates the loop iteration if it
04:43 - baggage true the loop will continue if
04:46 - not the loop will end so that same
04:51 - bearable e is going to be messy mmm
05:01 - that's like valen bin or equal to 20
05:06 - close that and then the last one is
05:09 - called increment counter so this one
05:15 - just adds Amina as the increases the
05:19 - loop so there will be plus plus and
05:25 - close that now we are just going to echo
05:29 - the variable which is e and pull that
05:36 - off save it and watch what happens and
05:42 - unexpected I'm 92 bus I guess we don't
05:49 - need this and yeah so that was the
05:56 - problem so I guess we don't need that
05:58 - and now the number is laid out from zero
06:02 - to number 20 so that's what the for this
06:06 - does based on my decision I said loop
06:10 - through all the way through 20 I kind of
06:13 - sim and through all the way little 500
06:16 - and it will and it will do that so
06:23 - that's what the for loop does now that
06:29 - is all for that tutorial so we learn
06:33 - about the different loops the wild moon
06:36 - that do well enough for zoo these are
06:39 - very helpful you are going to use them
06:42 - when you are coding and I hope you have
06:48 - learned so much and I hope to teach you
06:54 - some more about PHP so thank you guys
06:59 - for watching and I will see you guys on
07:03 - the next that's for you
