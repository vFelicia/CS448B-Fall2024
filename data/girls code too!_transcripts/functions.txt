00:00 - hello everyone and welcome to another
00:03 - tutorial with me and in today's tutorial
00:06 - we will be learning about functions
00:09 - what are functions functions are
00:12 - basically a block of statements that can
00:14 - be used repeatedly in a program
00:19 - a function will be only executed by a
00:23 - call to the function you must call the
00:27 - function in order for it to be executed
00:31 - one thing about a function is that it
00:33 - would not be it would not execute
00:35 - immediately when the page has load
00:40 - or when a page is loading
00:44 - so let's get right into it and
00:50 - what is the function so you start with
00:53 - the word function
00:56 - then you name the function anything you
00:59 - like you can start with the letter or a
01:02 - underscore you cannot start with the
01:05 - number
01:06 - and also the names can be case sensitive
01:09 - or capitalized doesn't matter
01:14 - now I'm going to name mine my function
01:17 - [Music]
01:19 - and then I'm going to have my
01:21 - parentheses and then my curly brackets
01:25 - then I'm going to click enter
01:28 - now over here is where you write your
01:31 - codes
01:34 - [Music]
01:38 - then for my code I'm going to write
01:42 - Echo
01:47 - Theresa
01:52 - is
01:54 - pretty
01:55 - [Music]
01:59 - now if I go ahead and save this
02:03 - and
02:04 - I go to my file
02:07 - localhost
02:09 - [Music]
02:10 - forward slash
02:12 - t-u-t dot PHP
02:19 - and let me fix that little error
02:22 - on line four
02:25 - Echo
02:27 - princess
02:30 - okay
02:31 - so I'm Gonna Save that and
02:34 - refresh nothing is displayed on the
02:37 - screen
02:38 - now why is that text not displayed on
02:41 - the screen
02:42 - that is because we did not call the
02:44 - function
02:45 - and to call a function
02:48 - [Music]
02:52 - so call the function and write the
02:55 - function's name my function name is my
02:58 - function
02:58 - [Music]
03:00 - and then I have my parentheses
03:03 - and in that let's save it
03:09 - now
03:11 - when I refresh this Teresa is pretty
03:14 - it's printed out on the screen and that
03:17 - is because we called the function
03:23 - so now another thing to learn about to
03:25 - know about function is
03:28 - that information can be passed to
03:30 - functions using something called
03:33 - arguments
03:35 - and arguments are just like variables
03:40 - [Music]
03:43 - so once we have an argument or a
03:46 - function I mean not a function but a
03:48 - variable
03:49 - called
03:51 - here
03:54 - now I'm going to Echo
04:01 - the function here
04:04 - and I'm gonna have another text
04:09 - um
04:10 - pick boxing
04:12 - [Music]
04:20 - so now I'm going to call my function
04:22 - [Music]
04:27 - and I'm just going to have one simple
04:31 - text in there
04:32 - I love
04:35 - now what's going to happen is that
04:39 - is going to add kickboxing to
04:44 - this text right here so let's go ahead
04:47 - and
04:48 - test that out
04:50 - and save now it says I love kickboxing
04:55 - only thing that happened was it added
04:58 - the arguments
05:00 - here which has kickboxing
05:05 - right over here that's all it did hit
05:09 - add the function
05:11 - not a function but it adds a variable
05:16 - now let's say if we wanted to add more
05:19 - arguments
05:21 - you can do that you can add as many
05:24 - arguments as you want I'm just going to
05:26 - add one more
05:28 - this is going to be apple
05:32 - then I'm going to Echo
05:35 - [Music]
05:37 - the variable here
05:57 - [Music]
05:59 - tennis
06:02 - and also the other variables Apple
06:07 - and I'm just going to name this Apple
06:12 - so now I'm going to
06:15 - um
06:16 - call my function
06:17 - [Music]
06:20 - and
06:22 - I'm going to say I love
06:28 - comma
06:30 - and I love
06:34 - and watch what's going to happen
06:39 - I love tennis and I love Apple
06:43 - all it did was add the arguments
06:47 - that's all it did and the arguments
06:52 - so that it and add the argument
06:55 - um here which has tennis and it add the
06:59 - um arguments Apple which has Apple
07:02 - and that's all it did
07:04 - now
07:05 - let's learn about how the function can
07:10 - have a permanent argument
07:13 - let's learn about that
07:15 - so let's say I have a function
07:18 - not a function but variable
07:21 - or argument
07:22 - name G and G is equal to the number
07:28 - 20
07:30 - .1
07:32 - now I'm going to
07:34 - um
07:35 - Echo
07:36 - just the variable by itself
07:40 - now what I'm going to do is
07:45 - um
07:46 - Echo no actually call the function
07:51 - and
07:55 - don't put nothing inside of parentheses
07:59 - and then I'm going to call the function
08:01 - again
08:03 - and I'm going to have
08:06 - the number
08:08 - 40 inside there
08:11 - so let's save this
08:15 - and refresh
08:17 - and you have 21 and 40.
08:20 - by default
08:22 - the number is 21.
08:25 - and then
08:27 - we added the number 40. instead of
08:32 - displaying the default we said display
08:35 - the number 40.
08:40 - and that is
08:44 - permanent arguments
08:46 - with the function
08:49 - now the last thing we should learn about
08:51 - is
08:54 - returning our function
08:57 - so let's say I have a variable a and a
09:01 - variable B
09:03 - and then I have a variable C which oh
09:06 - which holds sorry which holds a
09:10 - [Music]
09:12 - Plus
09:14 - B
09:16 - then I'm going to return
09:19 - the variable C so what's going to happen
09:21 - is I'm going to add two numbers together
09:25 - and it's going to give me the answer
09:28 - PSI
09:30 - I'm going to Echo
09:33 - [Music]
09:36 - um I'm going to add a number 18.
09:39 - [Music]
09:40 - plus 9 equal to
09:43 - now Dot column function
09:47 - [Music]
09:48 - now in the parentheses we're going to
09:51 - have the numbers 18
09:54 - and 9. so once will happen is is going
09:57 - to add the numbers 18 and 9 18 is
10:02 - variable a
10:04 - 9 is variable B it's yeah variable B
10:09 - so most let's go ahead and save this
10:14 - and refresh
10:16 - and 18 plus 9 equals 27.
10:23 - so basically it returns
10:26 - C and C equals two variable a plus
10:30 - variable B
10:32 - and that is how you return
10:38 - the function
10:39 - so that is it for this tutorial
10:43 - we went over functions and the different
10:46 - things it can do
10:48 - so on the next tutorial
10:50 - hmm I don't know what I'm going to teach
10:53 - but
10:54 - I will see you guys on the next tutorial
10:57 - so thank you guys for watching and I
11:00 - will see you later bye
