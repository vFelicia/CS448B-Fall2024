00:00 - hi everyone my name is Stephanie and
00:03 - today I would like to show you how to
00:06 - connect the database create table and
00:10 - insert into table using PHP and MySQL on
00:16 - so let's begin first we are going to do
00:21 - Larson text as always but since I'm
00:27 - lacking word and then we will have our
00:30 - variable three barrels one pair of oil
00:35 - is going to hold our host name my host
00:38 - name happens to be localhost and then
00:43 - for the username my username is root and
00:49 - pour the password my password is empty
00:57 - then we will have another variable which
01:02 - holds which basically connects
01:06 - everything
01:06 - it connects for your whole scheme
01:09 - username and password this ways people
01:13 - of my school I connect connect the house
01:21 - they usually and the password and then
01:30 - we will say if not Anna
01:42 - let's go to die and have an end message
01:49 - unable to kind of dot - - I connect air
02:03 - else
02:07 - HECO nectar so you basically said if
02:16 - it's not connected meaning something
02:19 - went wrong
02:20 - probably the hostname is wrong or they
02:23 - use the name is wrong or the password is
02:24 - wrong or something is wrong then it will
02:30 - tell us an LMS and goal and the error
02:34 - message will basically be unable to
02:36 - connect if everything else is fine
02:40 - everything ok then it's going to and out
02:45 - this message we are connected so let's
02:48 - stay back and let's go to our local host
02:56 - site my fire name is Lee today that's
03:03 - already there and we are connected
03:15 - so that is how you connect now I'm going
03:21 - to learn how to create database so let's
03:24 - just erase this part right here we don't
03:26 - need it anymore since we already here
03:31 - and you're connected now let's create
03:37 - database and apparel and inside the
03:49 - inside in between the double fault it's
03:53 - about my a database and you can even
03:58 - database anything from the life I am
04:01 - going to name mine bull and we do
04:10 - another Vanhorn
04:14 - so I ask you I hear e available to make
04:23 - that we made right here and that's you
04:28 - out this variable right here and then
04:33 - we're I'm going to stay in database
04:51 - creating house I say database
05:20 - connecter didn't get here from in
05:24 - parentheses this point the very opening
05:29 - and now we save that and we look back
05:33 - here and database has been created and
05:41 - so double check to see if the database
05:44 - is created for real then just go to pH
05:47 - from my admin
05:57 - you
06:01 - downloading
06:15 - and as you can see baseball has been
06:19 - created I'm star born and they created
06:27 - one have been created now let's add a
06:33 - table inside this database so to create
06:41 - a table
06:46 - your first are going to have the Android
06:52 - database and add inside here and yes we
07:16 - get people's who ate painful and you can
07:27 - even take with anything as well I'm
07:29 - missing me my table members and if she
07:43 - was going to have a ID and it's this is
07:50 - going to keep one side auto and it's
08:05 - just gonna have it you know
08:18 - and I'm gonna have something
08:20 - all right date/time stop this basically
08:24 - tells let to know when you signed up and
08:30 - at what time you sign up yeah is this
09:10 - here table reading else if there's an
09:24 - one sample that is wait to die
09:32 - no don't - you know I connect here and
09:52 - you save that
09:58 - and let's refresh this sample for you
10:03 - and to double-check to see it and say
10:06 - well they've created click on the
10:09 - database and you should find your table
10:13 - members and you will see that we have an
10:26 - ID email on the right thing ok so now
10:30 - the last thing we should learn is how to
10:33 - insert and to that's at the table and
10:37 - it's hurting the information in the
10:41 - table so it's the same thing as creating
11:01 - in the table but we're not forgetting in
11:04 - the table we are inserting information
11:07 - into the table so I'm just going to use
11:11 - the same variable I use that last time
11:14 - and turns into the table name which is
11:22 - members well it has email values and
11:37 - they even need to use is Borini I'm just
11:44 - going to use like a thing Mina Stephanie
11:53 - yeah
12:00 - and have another phone my sqli corny
12:30 - information has else nothing start it
13:01 - dodged my SQL I connect their connect
13:15 - and that should be all and now we should
13:22 - go back to our site and refresh
13:28 - information has been inserted into table
13:30 - and now you can go through our database
13:37 - go to our table and as you can see our
13:45 - information has been inserted and the
13:48 - email Stephanie a yahoo.com have been
13:51 - inserted on August 8 2016 16 all 756
13:59 - seconds so that's it that is how you
14:06 - connect create database create table and
14:09 - insert into table using PHP and MySQL
