00:00 - hey guys what is up I love learning here
00:01 - teaching you how to write better faster
00:02 - and safer code today we're talking about
00:04 - a weird thing that I think a lot of new
00:05 - programmers struggle with header files
00:07 - are this thing that we kind of learn on
00:09 - day one we have to pound include
00:10 - standardio.h but we don't really
00:12 - understand why header files exist and
00:15 - then when we go to make multi-module
00:16 - programs that use multiple C files we
00:19 - struggle to include header files in our
00:21 - process and don't really know where
00:22 - they're appropriate and not appropriate
00:24 - today we're going to break down the
00:25 - process of how the Linker Works under
00:27 - the hood what the compiler expects when
00:29 - you're using external functions and why
00:31 - the header file ties all of this
00:33 - together let's get right into it here we
00:35 - have some C code that's doing some basic
00:37 - C stuff we have our int main which is
00:39 - our entry point to our program and it's
00:40 - taking the standard main prototype we
00:42 - have the number of arguments for our
00:43 - program and the vector to those
00:45 - arguments we print F hello world just
00:47 - like we're used to but then we do
00:48 - something funky we say that an INT x a
00:51 - variable is equal to low level add which
00:53 - is a function that we have not defined
00:55 - yet it turns out the low level ad is
00:57 - actually a function that is exposed in a
00:59 - library that someone else me has written
01:02 - called lib low level math.so and we
01:05 - could go into and Cat this library.c and
01:08 - figure out what that function does and
01:10 - we also could in theory compile in
01:12 - liblibrary.c into our program statically
01:15 - by just including it into our build
01:17 - process including this code in our code
01:19 - and going from there but maybe this
01:22 - library is closed Source maybe we have
01:24 - to because of other dependencies in our
01:26 - build process have to just depend on the
01:28 - dot so file the problem with the code AS
01:30 - written is if we try to compile this
01:32 - we'll get a bunch of really nasty errors
01:34 - now the interesting part about these
01:35 - errors is that one is actually a compile
01:37 - time error and the other is a link time
01:40 - error the two of them being one an
01:42 - implicit Declaration of a function
01:43 - called the level add because again in
01:45 - our code we have not defined this
01:47 - function yet but we are calling it and
01:49 - then two we try to link in this function
01:52 - at link time after it compiles and the
01:55 - Linker says hey you tried to run a
01:57 - function called low-level ad I trusted
01:59 - you knew what you were talking about
02:00 - because I only called the implicit
02:02 - declaration a warning but I got to the
02:04 - Linker phase and I couldn't find the
02:07 - symbol low level ad before we go any
02:09 - further in this video I want to break
02:10 - down what the two words compile time and
02:13 - Link time mean I think they're kind of
02:14 - tossed around a lot and go over the
02:16 - heads of new programmers so let's kind
02:18 - of break down what the compile process
02:19 - looks like at compile time and Link time
02:21 - and Define those two so we can
02:23 - understand these two errors and how it
02:25 - relates to the header file when you run
02:26 - the traditional command to compile the
02:28 - program we'll do GCC Tac o
02:31 - um call my program p and we compile in P
02:34 - dot C right and I'm truncating that
02:36 - because my handwriting is terrible when
02:37 - you actually invoke GCC taco and do the
02:40 - whole command there are two things that
02:42 - happened there's what is called a
02:43 - compile pass where it compiles all of
02:46 - your code into object files so compiler
02:50 - produces objects objs and then the
02:54 - Linker pass or the link phase takes all
02:58 - the object files these are like an input
03:00 - to the link phase and it outputs an
03:03 - executable file and in some cases it
03:05 - could also output a library file but the
03:08 - final product of the link phase is one
03:10 - of these two things now it's really
03:13 - important to understand what is
03:15 - happening specifically in each of these
03:17 - phases and what the output is and how
03:19 - the header file plays into that now when
03:21 - you're writing code let's say that this
03:22 - is our piece of code here right it's
03:24 - it's a square and it has some code in it
03:26 - and let's say in that code for example I
03:28 - have a function called Foo right and
03:31 - then inside of that function also I have
03:32 - a function that's called add but add is
03:35 - not defined so during the compile phase
03:39 - right this is not the link phase this is
03:41 - at compile time the compiler will throw
03:43 - that first error that says hey you
03:46 - implicitly Define the function add
03:50 - but it won't throw an error yet what's
03:52 - going to happen is the output of the
03:54 - compile phase is this object file I like
03:56 - to think of them as like a spiky ball
03:58 - right so this ball is my let's say it's
04:01 - my P dot o because if this came from my
04:04 - P dot C file now it's P.O and the ball
04:07 - has this Spike on it that's like an
04:09 - arrow and the arrow is saying
04:11 - essentially hey by the way guys I still
04:13 - depend on the add function so let's say
04:16 - now that the program also has another
04:18 - file called M.C and the compile phase
04:21 - produces an M.O object file and it has
04:23 - no dependencies so our spiky ball
04:25 - analogy is just a ball by itself right
04:27 - so the compile phase will run and it
04:29 - will compile all these programs
04:30 - independently into objects once it's
04:33 - done compiling then the Linker phase
04:35 - comes in now the second phase the Linker
04:37 - phase is to do kind of what the name
04:39 - implies right it's to link all the
04:41 - things together if we have our spiky
04:43 - ball analogy where we have this one
04:45 - object file here that depends on ADD and
04:47 - maybe this other ball here the end
04:50 - product the Linker wants to produce is
04:52 - an executable that is just all of these
04:54 - balls attached together in the proper
04:57 - format so that all the dependencies are
04:59 - met right this thing here is the output
05:02 - of the Linker now the issue we ran into
05:05 - before where it said undefined reference
05:07 - to the thing is because the Linker was
05:10 - unable to find where the dependency to
05:12 - low level add was in all the object
05:15 - files so we have a bunch of problems we
05:17 - have to solve here now with our library
05:19 - lib low level at math.so which again
05:22 - could be a closed Source Library we are
05:24 - given an open source header file the
05:26 - header file acts as two things one for
05:29 - us as a programmer it's kind of an API
05:31 - that tells us how we can use the library
05:33 - it has good documentation like what do
05:36 - the parameters do and what does it
05:37 - return and the internal functionality of
05:39 - that could be a proprietary black box
05:41 - that maybe the manufacturer doesn't want
05:43 - us to know about or the authors want us
05:45 - to know about but they expose to us how
05:47 - do we use the function and then also it
05:49 - exposes a a header guard basically this
05:52 - prevents us from including the header
05:53 - multiple times and having recursive
05:55 - dependencies or circular requirements in
05:56 - our Pro and our programs so don't worry
05:58 - about that one too much but this is the
06:00 - meat and potatoes so the reason we use
06:02 - header files is it creates this symbol
06:05 - in our program so that the compiler
06:07 - doesn't yell at us when we try to
06:09 - implicitly Define things and so by
06:12 - including our libraries header file
06:14 - using lib slash low levelmath.h which is
06:17 - the path to the header file and again
06:18 - these quotes mean it's a local file
06:20 - that's in the current directory and
06:22 - these carrots mean that it's a global
06:23 - header file that exists somewhere else
06:25 - in a library that we installed on the
06:27 - system system lot
06:28 - so by including that we will get rid of
06:31 - one of the compiler errors now you see
06:34 - our implicit declaration went away but
06:36 - we still have this low level add error
06:37 - let's talk about what happened there so
06:39 - by adding this Line to Line one we
06:42 - include a header file into the program
06:43 - and that gives us the line that
06:45 - essentially says low level add the
06:47 - function is declared but we have not
06:50 - defined the function yet and again a
06:52 - definition is we say how the thing works
06:55 - the Declaration is just saying that the
06:57 - thing exists so this is a declaration
06:59 - and not a definition so what we need to
07:01 - do finally is you have to link against
07:03 - the library by giving a link or flag to
07:06 - GCC
07:07 - the Laker flag is we have to do Tac L
07:10 - and say low level math and then giving a
07:13 - library directory of the print working
07:15 - directory slash lib to tell it where to
07:17 - look for this library and then now we
07:19 - have a program by typing ldd that
07:22 - depends on a few things depends on our
07:23 - standard Linux libraries like Linux vdso
07:25 - and libc and then the loader but then
07:28 - also now our program depends on lib low
07:31 - level math and then we can run our
07:32 - program by saying LG Library path
07:36 - equals print working directory print
07:39 - working directory slash lib and then run
07:42 - our program and we eventually run our
07:45 - code and then we also Link in at runtime
07:47 - the shared object and that calls the
07:50 - external function that is defined in our
07:52 - header file and this line of thinking
07:54 - applies not only to using external
07:56 - libraries like we just did before but
07:58 - also using multi-module Code that we
08:00 - write ourselves for example if I have my
08:02 - main function here in a piece of code
08:04 - called code.c but I want to write a
08:06 - separate module that represents a
08:08 - different kind of functionality that
08:09 - shouldn't be in the same code AS main
08:11 - what I can do is I can make another C
08:13 - file and I can write the functionality
08:15 - for that module here here the module
08:17 - being some kind of client right maybe
08:19 - this is a structure that gets allocated
08:21 - when you connect from a server or
08:22 - something so in client.c we are going to
08:25 - also include client.h and that dot h
08:28 - does the exact same thing it exposes the
08:31 - API to the programmer of how the client
08:34 - module is supposed to behave and how
08:36 - they use the function reality so we
08:37 - Define our public structures like what
08:39 - the client even is here it's just some
08:41 - buffer you can put other data in that
08:43 - structure and then we declare what that
08:44 - function does the function called create
08:46 - client returns a client star okay
08:49 - awesome and then when we want to
08:50 - actually use create client in our code
08:52 - all we have to do is pound include
08:54 - client.h right there really simple now
08:57 - there is one tweak we have to do to our
08:58 - compilation process it will prevent
09:00 - things from breaking now in a perfect
09:02 - world maybe using a make file to
09:04 - automate this process but instead of
09:05 - doing the traditional GCC tac-o the
09:08 - thing the thing.c we're going to skip
09:10 - running the Linker step automatically
09:12 - and only do the compilation step by
09:14 - using the tax C Flag by using the tax C
09:17 - flag we're going to say hey turn our
09:18 - code.c into main.o the intermediate
09:22 - object file and again that set that
09:24 - spiky ball that has the arrow that says
09:26 - hey by the way I depend on create client
09:28 - don't forget about that and we do the
09:30 - exact same thing on client.o right we
09:33 - say GCC tax C so compile our client
09:36 - client code into the client object file
09:39 - and then to glue them all together we
09:41 - invoke the Linker which is that third
09:43 - and final stage here but says Hey output
09:46 - the full binary our final program called
09:48 - code and the sources are no longer C
09:51 - code they're the intermediate object
09:53 - files so we compile that and then we run
09:56 - our code and you can't see it happening
09:57 - but underneath the hood client.c is
10:00 - getting ran and it's allocating the
10:01 - client as defined in the C code and the
10:04 - only thing that code.c knows about is is
10:07 - what is exposed in the header file
10:08 - that's how header files work if you
10:10 - didn't know how they work now you do hey
10:12 - guys before you go I am working on some
10:14 - seriously awesome courses on my new
10:16 - website low level dot Academy the
10:18 - courses are going to range from
10:19 - everything from Zero to Hero C
10:20 - programming to threading and C to
10:22 - network code that doesn't suck in seed
10:24 - is how to get good at git if you're
10:26 - interested in any of those go check out
10:28 - sign up the first course Zero to Hero C
10:30 - programmer starts October 1st we'll see
10:33 - you there now another thing new
10:34 - programmers want to learn about is if
10:35 - it's okay to use numbers in their code
10:38 - like our numbers allowed is are this at
10:39 - legal go watch this video here while I
10:41 - talk about how numbers can actually be
10:43 - problematic in your code if you don't
10:45 - use them correctly we'll see you there
10:48 - so
10:49 - go click on the video all right bye

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys what is up I love learning here teaching you how to write better faster and safer code today we're talking about a weird thing that I think a lot of new programmers struggle with header files are this thing that we kind of learn on day one we have to pound include standardio.h but we don't really understand why header files exist and then when we go to make multimodule programs that use multiple C files we struggle to include header files in our process and don't really know where they're appropriate and not appropriate today we're going to break down the process of how the Linker Works under the hood what the compiler expects when you're using external functions and why the header file ties all of this together let's get right into it here we have some C code that's doing some basic C stuff we have our int main which is our entry point to our program and it's taking the standard main prototype we have the number of arguments for our program and the vector to those arguments we print F hello world just like we're used to but then we do something funky we say that an INT x a variable is equal to low level add which is a function that we have not defined yet it turns out the low level ad is actually a function that is exposed in a library that someone else me has written called lib low level math.so and we could go into and Cat this library.c and figure out what that function does and we also could in theory compile in liblibrary.c into our program statically by just including it into our build process including this code in our code and going from there but maybe this library is closed Source maybe we have to because of other dependencies in our build process have to just depend on the dot so file the problem with the code AS written is if we try to compile this we'll get a bunch of really nasty errors now the interesting part about these errors is that one is actually a compile time error and the other is a link time error the two of them being one an implicit Declaration of a function called the level add because again in our code we have not defined this function yet but we are calling it and then two we try to link in this function at link time after it compiles and the Linker says hey you tried to run a function called lowlevel ad I trusted you knew what you were talking about because I only called the implicit declaration a warning but I got to the Linker phase and I couldn't find the symbol low level ad before we go any further in this video I want to break down what the two words compile time and Link time mean I think they're kind of tossed around a lot and go over the heads of new programmers so let's kind of break down what the compile process looks like at compile time and Link time and Define those two so we can understand these two errors and how it relates to the header file when you run the traditional command to compile the program we'll do GCC Tac o um call my program p and we compile in P dot C right and I'm
