00:00 - it's amazing how easy it is to take the
00:03 - process of converting source code to
00:05 - machine code for granted we invoke the
00:07 - compiler and out pops our binary that we
00:10 - can run and not really think about it
00:12 - but if you want to improve our skills as
00:14 - a developer it is crucial that we
00:17 - understand the steps that get our code
00:19 - for Being Human readable to a place
00:21 - where the computer can execute it the
00:23 - topics we're going to discuss today are
00:25 - each extremely complicated in their own
00:28 - right but by spending 10 minutes a day
00:30 - on each one of these topics you can over
00:33 - time become a 10x developer without even
00:36 - thinking about it in this video we're
00:38 - going to discuss the idea of compilers
00:41 - executable file formats and how we get
00:43 - that executable off the disk loaded into
00:46 - RAM and executing on our computer and
00:48 - before we start some of you here may be
00:50 - brand new to computer science maybe
00:51 - you've written zero lines of code what
00:53 - if I told you there's a way that you
00:54 - could learn computer science that was
00:56 - free and easy that didn't break the bank
00:58 - and did not cost thousands of dollars
01:00 - the sponsor of today's video is
01:01 - brilliant.org brilliant is the best way
01:03 - to learn data science math and computer
01:05 - science interactively my favorite part
01:07 - about brilliant is that it's not a
01:09 - boring lecture Series where you sit
01:11 - there for an hour and watch a video and
01:12 - then take a test afterward the content
01:14 - is bite size it allows you to learn as
01:17 - you go if you're not sure where to start
01:18 - with programming if you're new here the
01:19 - new thinking and code course gets you
01:21 - designing real world programs that solve
01:23 - real world problems and after watching
01:25 - this video you can go to my URL
01:27 - www.brilliant.org the level learning for
01:30 - a free 30-day trial and 20 off your
01:32 - first annual subscription thanks again
01:34 - brilliant for sponsoring this video and
01:36 - it all starts by picking a programming
01:39 - language
01:40 - at the end of the day computers can only
01:42 - understand machine code the ones and
01:44 - zeros that correspond to specific
01:46 - transistors in the hardware of the CPU
01:48 - that make the CPU do things now we could
01:51 - crack open the Intel assembly manual and
01:54 - write the binary by hand ourselves this
01:56 - is entirely possible but crazy no one in
02:00 - their right mind would do this except
02:02 - for maybe this guy
02:03 - if we make a simple mistake in our
02:05 - binary and miss a single bit we could
02:07 - accidentally flip the entire logic of
02:10 - our program from a jump if to a jump not
02:12 - it to fix this we have programming
02:14 - languages a code that is more human
02:17 - readable than the machine code that
02:18 - eventually becomes a machine code that
02:20 - our CPU can understand but there's a
02:23 - problem we tried to feed the source code
02:25 - directly into the CPU the CPU would have
02:28 - no idea what we're talking about the CPU
02:30 - does not speak our english-like language
02:32 - and would not be able to run our code so
02:35 - we need a tool that will convert our
02:37 - human code into the machine code for us
02:39 - hence compilers compilers take our
02:43 - human-like code C for example and
02:45 - convert it into the ones and zeros the
02:47 - CPU knows how to run this is done in a
02:49 - roughly three stage process flexing
02:52 - parsing and co-generation in the Lexing
02:55 - stage the compiler takes our strings and
02:57 - turns them into tokens each token
02:59 - representing a different part of the
03:01 - expression
03:02 - also during the lexical analysis the
03:04 - compiler makes sure that our code
03:05 - adheres to the grammar of the language
03:07 - here for example int XX is not valid C
03:11 - code once all of our code has been
03:13 - converted into tokens the compiling
03:15 - moves to the next stage of parsing
03:17 - the tokens are parsed into a structure
03:19 - known as an abstract syntax tree where
03:22 - the tree represents the functional
03:24 - nature of our program in terms of what
03:26 - it is actually meant to execute as a
03:28 - series of tokenized expression now
03:31 - certain compilers like llvm for example
03:33 - May convert our code into what is called
03:34 - an intermediate representation or an IR
03:37 - an IR is a universal Assembly Language
03:40 - that is meant to represent the features
03:43 - of a CPU without adhering to a specific
03:45 - computer architecture once our IR has
03:48 - been generated we move on to code
03:49 - generation where the compiler outputs
03:51 - the specific CPU Target machine code for
03:55 - our processor in this case Intel
03:57 - assembly but the compiler can't just
03:59 - output a binary blob it has to Output a
04:01 - format that the operating system knows
04:03 - how to interpret which brings us to our
04:05 - next topic executable file formats when
04:08 - we run the code that we write a lot goes
04:11 - on under the hood for example we may
04:13 - have to link in external libraries like
04:15 - lib C or we may have to handle
04:17 - uninitialized variables that go into a
04:20 - particular area of memory all of these
04:22 - things have to be stored in a way that
04:24 - the operating system knows how to deal
04:26 - with them otherwise our code will not
04:28 - function
04:29 - to handle this the compiler has to know
04:31 - what format to put our code into so that
04:34 - the operating system and the compiler
04:36 - get along in this video we're talking
04:38 - about the executable linkable format
04:40 - better known as the elf the file format
04:42 - that Linux uses for its executables now
04:45 - the elf has a lot of features but the
04:46 - ones we're going to talk about are the
04:48 - elf header the elf segments and the elf
04:51 - sections the elf header is pretty simple
04:53 - it just specifies that this is a file
04:54 - format of an elf and describes a few
04:57 - things like the number of segments and
04:58 - sections the most important part of the
05:00 - elf are the segments here your text
05:03 - segment where your code lives in your
05:05 - program is readable and executable and
05:07 - here your data segment or predefined
05:10 - data goes is readable and writable but
05:13 - not executable each of these give the
05:15 - kernel specific information about how to
05:17 - load our compiled code into memory
05:21 - this elf format is used by the kernel to
05:24 - load the program correctly into memory
05:26 - it is extremely important that your
05:28 - segments are formatted correctly
05:29 - otherwise the kernel won't load your
05:31 - program into memory all of this is
05:32 - stored in the elf format once the
05:34 - compiler has produced this file we
05:36 - arrive at the final stage of the process
05:38 - and arguably one of the most complicated
05:40 - executing the program now the finale
05:43 - we've all waited for this moment we get
05:44 - to run our program how amazing well
05:47 - let's take a step back it gets pretty
05:49 - complicated pretty fast to start the
05:51 - parent process needs to inform the
05:53 - operating system that it wants to run
05:55 - your program now you may be thinking
05:56 - wait a minute of the parent process what
05:58 - is that I only wrote this piece of code
06:00 - here not the parent when you run a
06:01 - program every program needs to have a
06:04 - parent process the process that told the
06:06 - kernel that it wants to run your program
06:08 - when you run your program on the command
06:09 - line you run it in a shell sh sh is the
06:13 - parent of that process because sh told
06:15 - the kernel that your program needs to be
06:17 - ran the parent program in Linux for
06:19 - example will inform the operating system
06:21 - system that it wants to run your program
06:23 - by invoking what is called a syscall in
06:25 - Linux exec ee the exec vesus call will
06:28 - take as parameters the program path and
06:31 - the arguments to the program that you
06:33 - wrote the system call is a way to alert
06:35 - the kernel hey I want to run this
06:37 - program and the action of running a
06:39 - program is a function that only the
06:40 - kernel can do in its privileged
06:42 - environment a privilege that you don't
06:44 - have as the user when the kernel gets
06:46 - this signal to run your program it does
06:48 - a few really important things first the
06:50 - kernel will take your Elf and try to
06:51 - identify three locations in the elf the
06:53 - text segment again where the code lives
06:55 - the data segment where the data lives
06:58 - it's already been initialized in the BSS
07:00 - segment data that lives in your Elf but
07:02 - has not been initialized yet any
07:03 - variable basically that has the number
07:05 - zero at default will be put into the BSS
07:07 - the kernel allocates all of these
07:09 - segments in memory based off of the
07:10 - metadata in the elf format that your
07:12 - compiler emitted before but there is one
07:15 - more very important segment that we did
07:17 - not talk about PT interp yeah so plot
07:20 - twist when you run a program in Linux
07:22 - you actually end up running two programs
07:24 - your program gets loaded by the kernel
07:26 - but the kernel looks into your Elf and
07:29 - looks for a thing called the loader for
07:31 - your program remember how I said before
07:33 - that your program may depend on external
07:35 - libraries or things like that that
07:36 - needed to be loaded in at runtime for
07:38 - your program to work properly the kernel
07:40 - brings in a program called the dynamic
07:41 - Linker that runs alongside your program
07:44 - when it starts the dynamic Linker then
07:46 - goes through and parses your Elf and
07:48 - tries to find all of the symbols that
07:50 - have not been resolved that need
07:51 - external linkage for example in C in
07:54 - Linux if your code depends on libc the
07:56 - dynamic Linker that comes with your
07:58 - program when it gets executed by the
07:59 - kernel will go around and look for Liv C
08:01 - and try to populate all of your entries
08:03 - in your Global offset table before the
08:05 - program runs once the dynamic Linker has
08:07 - gone through and found all of the
08:09 - resolutions for your program it will
08:11 - eventually pass off code control to your
08:13 - program and your code gets to run by
08:16 - executing your start symbol amazing
08:18 - we've gotten to the end wow what an
08:20 - adventure I am exhausted I'm also
08:21 - sweating my ass off because I'm in a
08:23 - different Studio that's not in my house
08:24 - and I have my lights up too bright the
08:26 - world of programming is amazing many a
08:28 - deep rabbit hole but each one of these
08:30 - topics we talked about is a way that if
08:32 - you just spend 10 minutes a day learning
08:33 - a new little thing about that topic
08:35 - you'll become a Next Level programmer
08:38 - now before you go if you want to figure
08:39 - out how NASA writes space proof code
08:42 - code that doesn't crash in space check
08:44 - this video out
