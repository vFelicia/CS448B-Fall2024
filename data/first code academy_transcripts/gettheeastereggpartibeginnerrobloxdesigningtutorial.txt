00:01 - hello everyone welcome back to our
00:03 - channel
00:04 - here we share beginner friendly
00:05 - tutorials on roblox
00:07 - minecraft web programming and many more
00:10 - so today we are going to make a roblox a
00:13 - sticky
00:15 - so in this project i'll be teaching you
00:17 - on how to make a roblox game called get
00:20 - the ace to a
00:21 - in this game the players would start at
00:24 - one end of the jungle
00:26 - the goal of the game is to get the egg
00:29 - that is
00:30 - inside a bucket which is placed at the
00:32 - other end of the jungle
00:34 - to get the easter egg the player have to
00:36 - run through the jungle
00:38 - but there are some obstacles that are
00:41 - placed inside the jungle
00:42 - such as the green pads these green pads
00:46 - in the jungle would explode when they
00:48 - turn red
00:50 - another feature of this game would be a
00:52 - time which displays
00:53 - how long the player takes to reach the
00:56 - easter egg
00:57 - the first part of the tutorial would be
00:59 - game design scene
01:01 - in which i'll be teaching you on how to
01:03 - design a jungle
01:04 - on roblox studio in the second part of
01:07 - the tutorial i'll be teaching you on how
01:09 - to
01:10 - code the explosive green pads using code
01:14 - kingdoms
01:15 - so let's get started alright so let's go
01:17 - ahead and create our game scene
01:20 - first i'm going to code kingdoms to
01:22 - create a custom game so i'm going to
01:24 - click on the custom game
01:25 - option here and
01:28 - i'm going to rename my file as
01:32 - east egg
01:38 - egg
01:41 - and i'm going to click on an empty base
01:43 - plate and click on
01:45 - start
01:48 - so inside this game i'm going to create
01:51 - a file
01:52 - which is going to be called as platform
01:56 - so i'm going to type platform
01:59 - with a capital p and this is going to be
02:02 - an
02:03 - object and i'm going to click on the
02:06 - local behavior option
02:11 - all right so now once i have made my
02:13 - file next i'm going to download
02:15 - this project so i can open it up on the
02:18 - roblox studio
02:19 - to start designing my game scene i'm
02:22 - going to click on download structure
02:24 - next i'm going to open up roblox studio
02:26 - and open up the downloaded
02:28 - project i'm going to click on file
02:31 - click on open from file then you can go
02:36 - to download and select the
02:39 - project that you have downloaded
02:47 - all right so as you can see it's an
02:50 - empty baseplate
02:52 - where i'm going to design my game scene
02:54 - which is a forest
02:56 - so start off i'm going to create the
02:58 - ground of the forest
03:01 - so i'm going to click on part and click
03:04 - on block
03:08 - next i'm going to change the material of
03:10 - this
03:11 - part to be grass
03:14 - and i'm going to give a green color
03:20 - so that it looks more like a grilled
03:22 - grass
03:24 - next i'm going to use scale
03:29 - and then stretch it so that it's going
03:32 - to cover the whole base plate
03:42 - so you can go up on your wheel the
03:45 - camera view and then
03:46 - stretch it
03:54 - so next i'm going to anchor it and then
03:57 - i'm going to lock it so that
04:00 - this ground or this part doesn't move
04:02 - around
04:04 - so i'm going to click on lock next what
04:07 - i'm going to add is my small location so
04:10 - i'm going to go
04:11 - up in my camera view so
04:14 - i'm going to place my spawn location at
04:19 - one corner here so that my basket would
04:22 - be
04:23 - the basket with the egg would be on this
04:26 - corner
04:28 - it's on the opposite side of the jungle
04:31 - so i'm going to click on toolbox
04:36 - and i'm going to find a spawn location
04:42 - and i'm going to add a spawn location
04:46 - so to find out where my spawn location
04:48 - is
04:49 - i'm going to go up
04:53 - and i'm going to place it at one end of
04:58 - the jungle like this
05:01 - all right so i'm going to add a basket
05:02 - at the opposite end of the jungle
05:05 - so using the same toolbox i can choose a
05:08 - basket
05:10 - or a bucket that i can use so there are
05:13 - different types
05:14 - of baskets or packets you can use to
05:17 - make your game
05:18 - but since it's the project is about
05:22 - easter i'm going to choose a basket that
05:25 - is related to easter team
05:27 - and i'm going to download some baskets
05:30 - with the egg
05:32 - so i'm going to choose a basket without
05:35 - an egg
05:37 - so you can go down scroll down
05:41 - okay i found one that's this one
05:46 - so i'm going to choose that so you can
05:48 - see there's no egg
05:50 - which is great because i'm going to make
05:53 - an egg
05:54 - later on and i'm going to place my egg
05:58 - at the opposite
06:02 - corner so you can place it at anywhere
06:06 - so when i zoom out you can see that the
06:10 - basket is really teeny tiny the spawn
06:13 - location
06:14 - is at this corner
06:17 - and the easter egg is at this corner
06:21 - all right so i'm going to go down to the
06:24 - easter egg
06:27 - there are some slight adjustments that i
06:30 - had to make
06:31 - all right so the next thing i'm going to
06:33 - do is i'm going to
06:35 - make the basket to be a little bit
06:38 - bigger so i'm going to click on scale
06:40 - click on the basket and i'm going to
06:43 - choose the green knob
06:45 - so that i'm going to increase the height
06:47 - of the basket like this
06:51 - so make sure that it's not too big
06:54 - or not too small also so so that it can
06:58 - hold an
06:58 - egg but it's not too big for the player
07:02 - to jump
07:03 - inside it which makes the game to be
07:06 - more difficult
07:07 - so you can always try this out to see if
07:10 - size of the basket
07:12 - is okay or not so all you have to do is
07:16 - you can click on play
07:19 - okay so as you can see the
07:22 - basket is too big so you can just
07:26 - it's really hard for me to jump up
07:30 - oh i can't jump
07:34 - so if it is okay for your height you can
07:36 - just jump up
07:38 - like this make sure that you can jump
07:41 - in so because we're going to place the
07:43 - egg inside the basket
07:46 - all right so there are some adjustments
07:49 - i have to make
07:50 - i'll just make the
07:53 - basket to be anchored also so it doesn't
07:57 - like wobble around on the game scene
08:00 - next
08:00 - i need to add my easter egg
08:04 - so to add your insta egg i'm going to
08:08 - choose part and i'm going to choose a
08:11 - spear
08:14 - next i'm going to change the material of
08:16 - this
08:17 - is the egg to be plastic
08:21 - i'm going to make this egg to be a
08:23 - vibrant colored egg so i'm going to
08:25 - change the color to be
08:26 - a maybe blue color
08:31 - so if you want to make the egg bigger
08:34 - you can click on scale
08:36 - and make it slightly bigger but
08:39 - not too big so that it doesn't fit on
08:42 - the basket
08:43 - so i'm going to click on move and i'm
08:46 - going to
08:47 - move the egg inside the basket
08:53 - and place it inside like that
09:01 - all right all right so next once i have
09:04 - my
09:04 - egg like this i'm going to rename
09:08 - this x so i'm going to click on
09:11 - view explorer
09:14 - and i'm going to rename this part
09:18 - as egg
09:24 - so egg with the capital e
09:29 - all right so next what i'm going to do
09:31 - is
09:32 - i'm going to create my explosive green
09:35 - parts
09:37 - and i'm going to place them at random
09:40 - places
09:40 - in my gain environment so to make this
09:44 - clean pass
09:45 - i'm going to choose a cylinder part
09:48 - i'm going to click on part and i'm going
09:51 - to choose on cylinder
09:53 - all right so now the cylinder i need to
09:55 - make it kind of like a
09:56 - platform green pad
10:00 - so what i'm going to do is i'm going
10:04 - to scale this first
10:08 - make it a little bit like this
10:13 - and then increase the height of it like
10:18 - this
10:22 - all right that is using scale now to
10:25 - make it like into a platform
10:27 - i'm going to rotate it so i'm going to
10:29 - click on rotate
10:31 - and i'm going to rotate it along the
10:34 - blue
10:36 - axis like that
10:41 - now i have a platform the height of this
10:43 - platform is stupid
10:45 - so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
10:47 - flatten
10:48 - this cylinder so i'm going to choose
10:52 - scale again
10:53 - and i'm going to flatten it by using the
10:56 - red knob here
10:59 - so it can be a thin platform
11:03 - with a small height like this
11:07 - so i'm going to make it a little bit
11:09 - more wider
11:16 - like that i can choose
11:21 - so when i go up on the camera view
11:25 - i can see my platform
11:29 - much more better
11:35 - it's better if you have like a wider
11:38 - platform but
11:40 - it should not be to the height of the
11:42 - platform should not be too
11:44 - big so that's why i made the
11:47 - height of the platform to be small while
11:50 - i make the
11:51 - width of it to be longer
11:54 - i'm going to change the color so that
11:57 - it's going to be a little bit different
11:59 - from the egg so i'm going to choose it
12:02 - to be green color
12:03 - now if you're choosing green color we
12:06 - have to make sure that
12:08 - it's in a different shade of green than
12:11 - your graph
12:13 - so that it's it can be identified more
12:16 - easily
12:17 - so next what i'm going to do is i'm
12:19 - going to rename this
12:21 - part as platform
12:24 - i'm going to write flat form
12:28 - like that with a capital p
12:33 - so that is one platform so to make it
12:35 - more interesting i'm going to
12:38 - copy this platform and then place it at
12:41 - random places
12:43 - so i'm going to copy 20 platforms
12:48 - i can click on copy paste and then i can
12:51 - place it
12:52 - at random places so i'm good
12:55 - one two
13:06 - all right so i have 20 explosive green
13:10 - pads so right now they're not explosive
13:12 - but once they turn
13:14 - into red color at random times they
13:16 - would be explosive
13:18 - so right now i have it's almost
13:21 - halfway done so the next thing is to
13:24 - design my
13:26 - forest so what i'm going to do is
13:29 - i'm going to click on toolbox
13:32 - and i'm going to choose some trees
13:36 - to make my little jungle or the forest
13:41 - i'm going to type forest and there are
13:44 - lots of
13:45 - models which you can use to make your
13:48 - own jungle or your forest
13:51 - environment so i'm going to choose
13:55 - on tree forest so
13:59 - i'm going to choose this one
14:04 - i get a bunch of trees at one point
14:07 - so i can place them at random points
14:14 - it's fine if the green pads are covering
14:18 - or if the trees are covering the green
14:21 - pads
14:21 - so that it makes it more fun
14:29 - so i'm going to keep on adding more
14:32 - trees
14:32 - so i'm going to click on tree first
14:34 - again
14:40 - and so you can always rotate and see if
14:43 - it is
14:43 - to your liking the game design if not
14:46 - your
14:47 - always free to change it
14:59 - all right so in a forest we have
15:02 - different kinds of
15:03 - trees so i'm going to choose another
15:05 - tree model
15:10 - so
15:23 - and add more trees yeah it's kind of
15:26 - like
15:26 - on top so i just need to bring them to
15:29 - the ground
15:32 - so zoom in whenever you need and then
15:35 - choose the move button to bring them or
15:38 - place them onto the ground
15:51 - yep that's more like it okay
15:54 - so now what we're going to do is so
15:56 - other than trees we do have
15:58 - some rocks some bushes
16:02 - so i'm going to choose on rocks this
16:06 - time
16:12 - and i'm going to click on the rock model
16:17 - wow it's so small so if it's too small
16:21 - you can make it
16:22 - use on scale make it big so that it
16:26 - makes one big rock and then again choose
16:29 - on move
16:31 - and then move your rock to the place
16:34 - that you need it
16:55 - all right now i have some rocks some
16:57 - trees
16:58 - now that you can see that there are some
17:00 - parts of
17:02 - the environment is a bit empty
17:05 - so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
17:07 - add more trees
17:09 - so let me find some trees
17:23 - so you can add more models like
17:26 - lakes or maybe pushes
17:29 - or maybe other things that you can find
17:31 - in a forest to make it
17:34 - more realistic so
17:37 - again i'm going to add more trees
17:53 - so make sure that it's not too crowded
17:56 - also so that your player can move around
17:58 - in your game scene
18:26 - all right so we have completed the game
18:28 - scene
18:29 - so you can test out if you want to see
18:32 - if
18:33 - if your trees or your rocks or any other
18:36 - models that you have used are
18:38 - in the place that you want and
18:42 - you can try it i'm going to click on
18:43 - play so if there are any adjustments
18:46 - that you need to be
18:47 - done you can always stop the game and
18:50 - then adjust them
18:52 - or if you feel like you have to add more
18:54 - models you can
18:56 - also do that so let's take a look around
19:02 - so i have my crease here
19:06 - yeah so there are some slight
19:07 - adjustments i have to do where my
19:10 - trees are above the ground
19:14 - so we have to take note of that
19:24 - all right so it seems okay so
19:27 - there are some adjustments so i'll just
19:29 - stop the game
19:32 - and yeah so the trees here
19:35 - were slightly above the ground so i can
19:38 - zoom in into the game scene like that
19:44 - and then can click on move
19:48 - and then come down like okay
20:09 - all right yeah that should be
20:15 - okay so be creative and
20:18 - design your own custom forest
20:21 - for this game by choosing any of the
20:24 - models
20:25 - that are related to a forest
20:28 - so that's all for today in the next
20:31 - tutorial we'll be learning how to code
20:34 - the platforms to change colors and also
20:36 - to
20:37 - make them explosive when they turn red
