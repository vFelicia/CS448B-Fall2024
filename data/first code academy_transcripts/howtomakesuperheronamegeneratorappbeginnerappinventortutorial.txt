00:00 - hello everyone welcome to first code
00:01 - academy today we're going to do a
00:03 - project on app inventor
00:05 - called name generator in this project
00:07 - you'll be creating a simple mobile app
00:09 - in which the user will answer a few
00:11 - questions and a superhero name will be
00:13 - generated according to the user's answer
00:16 - so let's have a look at um a demo here
00:19 - of the app
00:20 - so the first question is what is your
00:22 - favorite color we can click here to
00:24 - choose one
00:25 - and as you can see we have quite a few
00:27 - options i'm gonna go with
00:29 - um pink all right and what is your um
00:32 - potato chip flavor i'm gonna go with
00:36 - flaming hot and then what do you like to
00:39 - do in your free time
00:41 - i'm gonna go ahead with watch youtube
00:45 - and then i'm going to click generate now
00:47 - to see what my superhero name is
00:50 - and i get incredible invisible theory
00:52 - all right so to begin
00:54 - let's start with creating the appearance
00:56 - of the app so now i'm in my app inventor
01:00 - project i'm going to go ahead with
01:02 - adding a label
01:04 - all right and then i'm going to go to
01:06 - text and type in the question
01:08 - so my first question is what is your
01:11 - favorite
01:12 - color okay so as you can see now our
01:15 - label is
01:16 - displaying that now the next step would
01:20 - be to add in the
01:21 - options for the user to choose so we're
01:23 - going to use the list picker to do that
01:25 - and we're going to drag it
01:27 - to below our label all right now we
01:31 - don't want it to say text for list
01:32 - picker one so we're gonna go to
01:35 - text delete that and type in
01:38 - choose one all right
01:42 - now what we're going to do next is we're
01:44 - going to go ahead and add in the options
01:46 - we're
01:46 - going to do that in elements from string
01:49 - now since i'm going to add in 12 options
01:51 - i have
01:52 - typed my options somewhere else i'm
01:54 - going to go ahead from
01:55 - that place and paste it onto
01:59 - my elements from string all right
02:03 - so these are my options i added in 12.
02:06 - so as you can see
02:07 - okay i'm going to zoom in you need to
02:09 - make sure that you separate
02:11 - your options with a comma okay so i have
02:14 - red orange yellow green turquoise all
02:16 - the way to white
02:18 - all right so that's my first question
02:20 - and options done
02:22 - i'm going to go ahead and add in my
02:23 - second question
02:25 - okay and go to text
02:28 - my second question will be what is your
02:30 - favorite potato chip flavor
02:33 - favorite potato chip
02:36 - flavor
02:40 - okay and then grab a list picker just
02:43 - like we did
02:45 - go to text make it choose one again
02:51 - all right and then it's time to go to
02:54 - elements from string and add in your
02:56 - options
02:58 - so i have them typed somewhere else as
03:00 - well
03:01 - these are my options i have classic
03:04 - bbq salt and vinegar sour cream all of
03:08 - that
03:08 - in here okay and i separate them with a
03:11 - comma
03:12 - so you can drag the corner of the text
03:16 - box right here so that
03:18 - you can see your options
03:21 - okay now i'm gonna go with my third
03:23 - question
03:25 - and i'm gonna type in what do you like
03:28 - to do in your free time
03:30 - like to do in your free time
03:38 - all right what do you like to do in your
03:39 - free time okay and then grab a list
03:41 - picker
03:43 - change the text to choose one
03:48 - and then add in the options all right
03:51 - i'm gonna have a look
03:55 - okay so these are my options right here
03:58 - now the last thing is we need to go
04:01 - ahead and add in
04:02 - a button so this button is going to be
04:04 - the thing you click
04:05 - which will generate the superhero name
04:08 - for you
04:09 - so we get the button we change the text
04:13 - to
04:15 - generate super hero
04:18 - name
04:23 - all right generate superhero name and
04:25 - then
04:26 - we need a label again to show the users
04:29 - what their superhero name is so this one
04:33 - i'm going to go to text and change it to
04:35 - your super
04:36 - hero name is okay
04:40 - and the label that's actually going to
04:42 - show
04:43 - you the super hearing aid another one
04:46 - right there
04:47 - below the um label okay and for this one
04:51 - we won't know what it is until they have
04:53 - um chose
04:55 - chosen their options so we're gonna make
04:56 - it blank we can go to text
04:58 - delete text for label five all right
05:02 - and what we wanna do is we wanna rename
05:05 - this label because we have quite a bit
05:07 - of labels
05:08 - okay so when we code it's going to be
05:09 - easier if you rename them
05:11 - so that you know which ones you actually
05:13 - want to put the text in
05:16 - so you rename it to result
05:21 - okay all right so we have our three
05:23 - questions
05:24 - we have the um button to generate the
05:27 - superhero name
05:28 - we have the label that shows your
05:30 - superhero name is
05:32 - and then the actual label okay called
05:35 - result
05:35 - that's going to display it and that's it
05:38 - for
05:39 - the app design we're going to go ahead
05:41 - and start coding next
05:42 - all right so now i'm in the blocks mode
05:44 - where we're going to do the coding for
05:46 - the app
05:47 - now to start with we have to prepare
05:49 - list of names that match with the user's
05:52 - selection so i have i'm going to do
05:54 - color list flavorless and hobby list
05:57 - all right so we go to variables we're
06:00 - going to initialize
06:01 - three okay
06:06 - and then the first one since i'm asking
06:08 - about color i'm gonna change it to
06:10 - color list like so
06:14 - right and i'm gonna make a list of all
06:16 - of the
06:17 - choices okay so i'm going to go ahead
06:21 - and add 12 because i gave the users 12
06:23 - choices in the beginning to choose from
06:34 - all right so now i have 12 choices right
06:37 - here
06:38 - i'm gonna go ahead and type in my first
06:40 - one
06:41 - so my first one right here let's say in
06:43 - the beginning for
06:44 - the color the user chose red then i'm
06:48 - going to go ahead
06:49 - and say what their
06:52 - first part of their superhero name is
06:54 - going to be if they chose red
06:56 - so for me i'm going to go with captain
07:01 - all right now the second bit
07:05 - okay if they choose another color i'm
07:07 - going to make the first part
07:08 - doctor okay
07:12 - duplicate it put it here
07:15 - then the other one will be the great
07:23 - all right and then i do turbo
07:33 - okay so you can keep duplicating for
07:36 - each of the
07:37 - options that you provided
07:52 - okay so this is the first part of this
07:54 - super hearing aid
07:56 - which is generated from when the user
07:58 - chooses a color
08:12 - and then my last one will be invincible
08:19 - so the first part of the name is done
08:21 - all right which is generated from the
08:23 - color
08:23 - color list so i'm going to shrink it and
08:27 - keep it here
08:28 - now the second part is going to be from
08:30 - the flavor
08:31 - of the potato chip right so we can name
08:33 - this
08:34 - flavor okay
08:42 - chip flavor maybe
08:46 - okay and we're gonna go ahead and add in
08:48 - the options again
08:49 - so i'm actually gonna copy this one
08:52 - right here okay
08:54 - duplicate and close this
08:57 - put it here and of course i'm going to
08:59 - change in the options in here
09:03 - so for the flavor list the first one i'm
09:07 - going to add is
09:08 - evil and of course you can choose your
09:12 - own
09:12 - um name so i'm going to go with speedy
09:26 - so these are all um superhero powers
09:29 - evil speedy funny flying mind reading
09:58 - so that's from the chip flavor these are
10:01 - the words the second part of the
10:02 - superhero name
10:04 - now for the third part it's going to be
10:06 - from hobby
10:09 - okay and then again i'm going to make a
10:11 - list of
10:12 - words i'm going to put this right here
10:18 - all right now the first word i'm going
10:20 - to do is
10:22 - ninja and maybe agent
10:56 - all right so these are all the words
10:59 - that i'm going to
11:01 - use to generate the superhero name now
11:03 - the next thing that i'm going to do
11:05 - is i'm going to go ahead and update the
11:07 - selection
11:08 - after an answer has been picked all
11:11 - right so we need to update the
11:12 - listpicker.txt
11:14 - in all three list picker components now
11:17 - we're going to do that
11:18 - by going to list picker okay list picker
11:22 - one
11:24 - and we're going to say when
11:26 - listpicker1.afterpicking picking
11:27 - we're gonna do that for all three list
11:28 - pickers okay
11:30 - change this to list picker two and then
11:33 - lastly we have
11:34 - list picker three all right let's pick
11:38 - your one list picker two and list picker
11:40 - three
11:41 - and then after we have that we're gonna
11:43 - say okay we wanna change
11:46 - the text of the list picker to whatever
11:48 - the user has chosen
11:50 - so to do that we're gonna say we wanna
11:53 - set
11:55 - okay list picker dot text
11:58 - to whatever the user has chosen so that
12:02 - would be list picker
12:03 - dot selection
12:07 - okay right here
12:12 - all right so the first one is done we
12:16 - can just
12:17 - duplicate it and then put it into the
12:20 - second one
12:20 - but don't forget make sure you change it
12:22 - to list picker two
12:25 - and then the last one would be list
12:26 - picker three
12:29 - all right okay i'm also going to
12:32 - shrink these blocks so i'm gonna
12:35 - collapse
12:37 - collapse then collapse
12:41 - all right now after i'm done with that
12:44 - the next thing i'm going to do
12:46 - is i want the name to be generated
12:48 - according to the user's choice
12:50 - so if the user's choice is the first
12:52 - selection in the list picker one
12:54 - then the name generated um will be the
12:56 - first name
12:57 - in the first list so it would be
13:01 - this list right here right okay
13:07 - and then i also want to check the
13:09 - selection
13:10 - and we'll create a procedure to select
13:13 - the selection list
13:14 - and obtain the index from the user's
13:16 - choice
13:17 - which we will name check selection right
13:20 - and we want to call
13:21 - check selection when the user presses
13:23 - the generate button
13:24 - and pressing the generate button also
13:27 - resets the list picker text to choose
13:29 - one okay so we're gonna initialize
13:36 - three things some variables
13:42 - okay and the first one like i said we're
13:45 - gonna make it selection one
13:48 - selection one selection
13:52 - two and selection
13:55 - three all right now after we do that
13:59 - we need to go ahead and
14:02 - put in empty text boxes like so
14:07 - okay because we're not sure yet what
14:09 - they will choose
14:10 - i put that here like a placeholder
14:16 - okay and then next we would need to set
14:19 - the three variable to store the selected
14:21 - items from
14:22 - the list okay so to do that we're gonna
14:26 - need to open
14:27 - these three codes right here
14:31 - and then we say all right
14:36 - set okay so we see selection one
14:40 - so it's that selection one
14:45 - to whatever we have chosen
14:50 - so that would be list picker one
14:55 - dot selection index right because we
14:59 - want to match
14:59 - what we chose to what the
15:03 - name will be selection index
15:07 - okay so we can copy this put it right
15:11 - here
15:12 - now make sure it's list thicker too and
15:18 - uh selection two oops this one should
15:20 - have been this figure two
15:22 - okay and then lastly
15:26 - for our list picker 3 change it to
15:29 - selection 3 and
15:31 - let's pick for 3. make sure to change
15:33 - this one right here as well
15:38 - all right so now whenever the user
15:42 - chooses something we're going to match
15:44 - it to one of the
15:46 - options here okay for each of the
15:48 - questions they're going to be matched to
15:50 - one of these words
15:52 - okay now i'm going to shrink them again
16:00 - now that we have the selection index we
16:02 - need to create the procedure block to
16:04 - select the
16:05 - selection list and obtain the index from
16:08 - the user's choice which we will name
16:10 - as check selection
16:13 - so we're going to go to procedure all
16:16 - right it's the
16:17 - purple color block and then we are
16:20 - going to say to procedure
16:23 - result and like i said we're going to
16:27 - name this
16:28 - check selection so check selection
16:34 - all right and then we are going to have
16:37 - two parameters so we can have
16:43 - inputs right two inputs
16:48 - now the first input we are going to call
16:51 - it list
16:53 - okay so list the second input we're
16:55 - going to call it
16:56 - selection index
17:00 - like so so list and selection index
17:03 - and then we're going to go ahead and say
17:07 - it's a list and we're going to say
17:09 - select list item
17:11 - list and index
17:14 - okay for the list it will depend on
17:18 - which list you've got so get list
17:23 - and then index it will be just the
17:26 - parameter we
17:27 - did the input we did which is get
17:30 - selection index
17:32 - all right now that we're done with this
17:34 - part okay we're gonna go ahead and code
17:36 - the generate button
17:39 - so we can go ahead that's button one
17:43 - okay so when button1.click something
17:45 - should happen
17:46 - okay i'm gonna shrink these ones again
17:53 - all of those okay one button one dot
17:56 - click
17:58 - so when button1.click we need to set the
18:00 - name label now so the label that's going
18:02 - to
18:03 - um show the your superhero name
18:07 - so that's results right here
18:11 - and then set dot result.text
18:15 - to something okay we put that right here
18:20 - and we have three components in the
18:23 - super heroes name so we need to use
18:27 - something called join it's right here in
18:29 - text
18:30 - okay bring that and connect it here
18:36 - all right now that we have join we're
18:39 - going to
18:40 - call the procedure that we have created
18:43 - okay so we're going to call check
18:45 - selection
18:51 - then in the call check selection we're
18:53 - going to get
18:55 - first of all the color list okay so we
18:58 - go to
18:58 - variables we get this method
19:03 - okay now selection index so which one
19:06 - they have selected
19:08 - we're gonna go ahead and get selection
19:11 - one
19:12 - okay which is a variable we generate uh
19:14 - we initialized here
19:16 - get selection one
19:20 - all right now the next thing we need to
19:22 - do is we need to add
19:24 - a little bit of space in between each
19:26 - word right we don't want them
19:27 - all stuck together so we're going to add
19:29 - in an empty text box
19:32 - like so all right and then we need more
19:36 - two more words so we need to add some
19:38 - more spaces
19:40 - okay and we also need to think about the
19:43 - space in between the words so i'm going
19:45 - to add in
19:47 - let's say this much right so four more
19:52 - then i'm going to duplicate this call
19:54 - again
19:55 - but this time it's not colorless it's
19:59 - your chip flavor list and global
20:02 - selection
20:02 - too put in the spacer
20:06 - again all right and then
20:09 - lastly we call the selection
20:12 - right here change it to get global
20:16 - hobby and it would be your third
20:19 - selection
20:21 - all right and for this one since it's
20:24 - the last word we don't really need the
20:25 - space i'm going to remove it
20:29 - okay you can just drag it out like that
20:31 - all right
20:33 - then that's it for the coding part of
20:36 - this
20:37 - app okay so you can go ahead and try it
20:39 - using your
20:40 - android phone by clicking on connect
20:44 - and ai companion or you can use
20:47 - bluestacks
20:48 - an app where you can look at android
20:50 - apps so that's all for today i hope you
