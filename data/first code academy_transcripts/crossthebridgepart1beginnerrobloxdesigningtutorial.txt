00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to our
00:02 - channel
00:03 - here we share beginner-friendly coding
00:05 - tutorials on scratch
00:06 - roblox minecraft with programming and
00:09 - many more
00:10 - so today we are going to create a roblox
00:13 - project
00:14 - called cross the bridge
00:19 - this is an interesting adventure game
00:22 - where you have to cross a poisonous
00:24 - river
00:26 - alright you need to cross it
00:30 - through the bridge it is not easy to
00:32 - walk along the bridge as there are
00:34 - obstacles
00:34 - such as holes then you see this laser
00:37 - trap
00:38 - all right oopsies
00:41 - all right how about if i restart this
00:43 - again
00:44 - this project will be in two parts in
00:47 - which
00:48 - first we're going to create the game
00:50 - scene we're going to design it first
00:53 - and then the second part will be the
00:55 - coding part
00:57 - all right let's try to cross this lasers
01:00 - first
01:01 - whoops
01:06 - and then i arrive in a hut yay
01:09 - all right so let's get started
01:13 - so we are going to create a new project
01:16 - on roblox studio
01:17 - after launching the app let's click new
01:20 - and then let's choose baseplate
01:24 - first we're going to make the pool of
01:26 - poison water
01:28 - click on the home button and click on
01:31 - editor
01:32 - then generate you will be given options
01:35 - on the left side of the screen
01:38 - now let's go down a little bit okay now
01:41 - let's unclick everything
01:43 - and click the biomes over here except
01:46 - water so we need
01:47 - water over here and then let's make the
01:50 - bio size into 100 and
01:54 - then let's click generate
02:00 - next click on view and open explorer
02:04 - explorer should be this one all right
02:06 - it's in the right side
02:08 - part and under the workspace
02:11 - do you see base plate all right now
02:14 - let's delete the base plate
02:17 - okay so we have water over here next we
02:20 - want you to change the color of the
02:21 - water of your choice
02:23 - now let's click on properties all right
02:26 - it's over here
02:28 - and let's choose the terran over here in
02:30 - the explorer part choose terran
02:33 - now we can change the watercolor
02:36 - you can always go for purple if you
02:38 - cannot think of anything
02:46 - next let's move the spawn location to
02:49 - the edge of the water
02:51 - all right let's use move
02:55 - and we're going to move it to the edge
02:56 - of the water
03:02 - alright so now it's already in the edge
03:04 - of the water
03:05 - make sure that it's above the water
03:09 - now we'll add a bridge by adding a block
03:11 - from the home
03:12 - top right we're at home right now and
03:15 - let's add a block over here this part
03:20 - all right now let's move it a little bit
03:24 - move it a bit closer to the spawn
03:26 - location
03:30 - nice
03:34 - now let's set the material to boot
03:37 - here material and then let's choose wood
03:41 - all right now let's change the color
03:45 - into brow
03:48 - alright and then set the size
03:51 - okay over here
03:55 - go down and the properties go down in
03:58 - the size
03:59 - let's change it into 6 comma
04:02 - 1 comma 50
04:07 - all right so it will be really long
04:11 - let's adjust it first
04:15 - okay don't forget that you need to
04:18 - anchor the bridge as well
04:20 - don't forget to rename the part name
04:22 - into bridge
04:27 - right now we're going to create a holes
04:30 - and a bridge
04:32 - all right so to create the holes let's
04:34 - add
04:35 - five spheres on the bridge
04:38 - over here home part and choose fear
04:42 - okay
04:45 - and let's adjust it you can just
04:48 - easily duplicate it
04:52 - but before duplicating it how about
04:54 - let's put it
04:56 - put it down here make it intersect
05:00 - with the bridge itself
05:04 - so you have it like this
05:07 - then what you can do is you can
05:09 - duplicate it all the time
05:12 - right click duplicate and then move it
05:18 - and then you can right click duplicate
05:20 - move it again
05:23 - duplicate move it again duplicate
05:28 - then move it again so you have five over
05:30 - here
05:32 - now what we need to do let's use the
05:34 - select tool
05:36 - and in the explorer let's let's press
05:38 - the part
05:39 - and let's hold shift and then press this
05:42 - part so we can select everything that we
05:44 - have
05:46 - then let's go to model
05:49 - do you see solid modeling over here okay
05:52 - this part
05:53 - is the negate let's create the negate
05:56 - over here
05:59 - so it'll be a negative part okay now the
06:02 - last thing that we need to do
06:04 - we need to hold shift again on the
06:06 - negative part
06:07 - and then press bridge so we can select
06:10 - everything including the bridge
06:12 - after that let's let's press the unit
06:15 - over here
06:17 - which will create holes all right see
06:20 - that's creating holes over here
06:23 - so actually the holes are to trick the
06:25 - players into falling through them
06:28 - so if they are not wide enough you can
06:30 - just always adjust the bridge by using
06:33 - the scale tool
06:34 - next we will create a middle ground that
06:37 - acts as a buffer for players
06:40 - now let's go to the edge of the bridge
06:43 - now let's add a block
06:50 - over here let's change the materials
06:54 - and the color that you like anything
06:57 - basically anything but make sure
07:00 - that the size is 15
07:04 - 1 15. all right now let's go to the
07:07 - property
07:08 - select the part select the buffer
07:13 - i'm going to select the buffer then
07:16 - adjust it a little bit
07:17 - and let's look for the size
07:22 - okay the size we're going to change it
07:24 - into 15
07:26 - comma 1 comma 15.
07:34 - okay let's adjust it a little bit more
07:43 - then you can change the materials and
07:46 - also the
07:47 - colors
07:54 - and don't forget that you need to anchor
07:56 - it
07:58 - now we're going to create the next
08:00 - bridge okay so the next bridge
08:02 - will be slightly more challenging as it
08:04 - would include bombs
08:07 - the second bridge will have the same
08:09 - property as the first all right
08:13 - so how about let's create a part
08:20 - yep adjust it
08:29 - and then we're going to change the
08:31 - material into boot
08:33 - and the color into brow
08:37 - and make sure that you have the size of
08:40 - 6 a6
08:44 - 1 and 50.
08:49 - you can always adjust it
08:58 - don't forget that you need to anchor it
09:00 - again and rename it
09:03 - into bridge
09:08 - after creating the bridge how about
09:10 - let's create the bombs now
09:12 - now on the bridge we're going to add a
09:15 - part
09:16 - and then we're going to scale it a bit
09:20 - smaller
09:23 - and then we're going to change this
09:26 - into neon we're going to change the
09:29 - material to neon
09:31 - and then we're going to change the color
09:33 - into red
09:38 - don't forget that we're going to rename
09:40 - it
09:41 - as bob
09:46 - now what we need to do is we can
09:48 - duplicate it
09:50 - in each side we will add three of it
09:54 - duplicate and then move it duplicate
09:57 - again
09:58 - and then move it again let's do it for
10:01 - the
10:02 - right part also duplicate it
10:05 - and then move it
10:11 - duplicate it and then move it again
10:14 - duplicate it and then move it again
10:18 - now for the last part let's design our
10:21 - bowl over here
10:23 - i want to add a hut
10:26 - from the toolbox all right and i'll look
10:30 - something that will
10:31 - suit that is suitable for this case all
10:34 - right i'm going to add
10:36 - a vietnam hut on water
10:40 - all right
10:44 - then i'm going to adjust it
10:53 - or maybe i can just rotate it
10:56 - maybe it'll be better okay you can use
10:59 - the rotate tool
11:01 - yep this will be better okay
11:05 - this is better
11:08 - all right feel free to add signs or
11:11 - messages of your choice you can really
11:12 - add anything that you like
11:15 - all right now i'm going to try to play
11:16 - it first
11:19 - let's see if everything works properly
11:25 - alright so this is how my bridge looks
11:32 - all right okay and it has neons but it
11:37 - it's not working right now and i already
11:39 - have my design go over here
11:42 - all right so this is how the project
11:44 - will work
11:48 - so that's all for the game design of
11:50 - this project hope you
