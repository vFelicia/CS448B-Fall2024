00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to our
00:02 - channel
00:04 - here we share beginner friendly coding
00:05 - tutorials in scratch roblox web
00:07 - programming
00:08 - and many more so today we are going to
00:10 - create a pet video control
00:12 - using things cad and arduino as you can
00:16 - see
00:17 - this is our copy of the pathfinder
00:19 - control
00:20 - so there are like different led lights
00:22 - and then there's like buttons and then
00:24 - there's like a micro
00:25 - like this is like the feeder theme so it
00:27 - will kind of spin
00:28 - so what are we going to do is actually
00:30 - we're going to push the button
00:31 - so it kind of makes uh some light it's
00:33 - going to light up
00:35 - but yeah so the light's going to light
00:37 - up so
00:38 - it depends on how long um for example
00:41 - just going to wait for
00:42 - 1 minute or five minutes or 15 minutes
00:45 - like that
00:46 - afterwards it's just gonna spin so it
00:48 - kind of works like a pet feeder thing
00:50 - so let's get started so we'll start by
00:54 - uh creating our uh board first
00:57 - so there are some few things that we
00:59 - require for example
01:01 - uh we need uh five resistors uh four to
01:04 - seven
01:05 - d ohm resistor and then one tank k
01:08 - on resistor and then there one button
01:11 - and
01:12 - four led lights um a small breadboard
01:16 - um arduino uno r3 and then there's a
01:19 - very special thing it's called
01:20 - microcircle
01:22 - so uh first of all we're just going to
01:25 - drag the arduino uno out three
01:28 - out first and then put it uh slightly at
01:31 - the
01:31 - bottom of the screen and
01:35 - where is the okay i'm going to search
01:37 - for the mini breadboard
01:41 - yep i'm gonna place it on top of
01:45 - our arduino uno a little bit top
01:50 - and now we're going to put the led
01:54 - lights
01:55 - uh on top of the breadboard uh top left
01:58 - corner
01:58 - and we're gonna put four of them so
02:01 - making to horizontal line with all the
02:04 - uh the lights and for the resistor
02:08 - uh we're going to put four of them uh
02:11 - on the middle right uh inside the
02:14 - arduino uno
02:15 - so perform first all right of all of
02:18 - them
02:18 - i make sure to change it to 270
02:21 - ohm for each resistor
02:31 - all right so okay we finished our
02:34 - setup inside a board uh but however we
02:37 - still have the push button and also a
02:39 - 10k
02:39 - ohm resistor uh we're not gonna put it
02:41 - inside a breadboard instead we're just
02:43 - going to put it
02:44 - uh in between the mini breadboard and
02:47 - then us
02:48 - as well as like the arduino so we're
02:51 - just a little bit and then the resistor
02:54 - i'm gonna put it next to the red button
02:57 - uh
02:58 - make sure that it's like 10k
03:02 - right so uh the last thing we're gonna
03:06 - uh get from this components are
03:09 - microservo which is the most important
03:10 - part actually
03:12 - so we're gonna put it next to
03:15 - the arduino uno on its right side
03:18 - so right basically we're done
03:22 - now we can do some wiring so
03:25 - the right leg of each led lights i
03:28 - connect them with
03:29 - each of the resistors so the first
03:33 - i'm gonna then get that
03:42 - the likes of the resistor for the left
03:44 - leg uh we're going to
03:47 - connect them with the dnd which is the
03:50 - ground
03:50 - so find the intersection between the
03:53 - first
03:54 - right led leg and then the resistors
03:58 - and it's the whole like that so we're
04:00 - just going to click on that
04:03 - and then we are going to link it to the
04:08 - gnd so
04:16 - all right so this is the gnd the ground
04:19 - and all we have to do is link our
04:22 - right leg of our resistors
04:26 - to the ground
04:33 - so we created almost create finish the
04:35 - circuit
04:36 - uh all we have to do is actually um
04:39 - blinking our wires
04:43 - back to our
04:47 - pins so connect
04:50 - our four resistors to
04:53 - pin 11 two
04:56 - pin eight
05:03 - right now we finish all of our
05:06 - connections between the breadboard and
05:08 - then the
05:09 - led lights so the next part uh we're
05:12 - going to connect our
05:14 - button with our uh already know unl
05:17 - and then make it into a circuit so first
05:19 - of all link your
05:21 - top left leg of your button
05:24 - to pin 12
05:28 - like that and then
05:32 - for the positive one which
05:35 - is the y which is the power one we are
05:38 - going to get our
05:39 - bottom right leg of our button and then
05:42 - we're going to connect them
05:44 - to our five volts
05:48 - pin here so we connect them awesome so
05:52 - uh the only one left is actually the
05:55 - resistor
05:55 - so uh for your bottom right at bottom
05:59 - left leg
06:00 - okay so extend stand it and then connect
06:02 - with our tanky resistor
06:05 - and then afterwards we're going to
06:08 - connect the bottom part of our resistor
06:13 - to the ground again so
06:20 - that's it okay so this we finish our
06:24 - led lights and then our buttons uh
06:26 - there's nothing uh on the top right
06:28 - corner
06:29 - of our button so don't worry about that
06:31 - all right
06:32 - so for our micro circle uh there are
06:35 - three
06:36 - pen uh on top of that so for the left
06:39 - one
06:40 - uh actually that's the ground so
06:42 - obviously we're going to connect it
06:44 - to the ground inside our uno
06:47 - so it's extended and then connected to
06:51 - the ground together
06:52 - all right so in the middle one that is
06:55 - actually the power
06:56 - wire so we're going to
06:59 - connect it with our five volts again
07:03 - with our button
07:06 - so
07:10 - all right so the last one is actually
07:12 - connected
07:14 - to the pen it kind of works with it
07:17 - so
07:20 - right the last one
07:24 - drag it out connect it to pin three
07:29 - all right so basically we finished uh
07:32 - the
07:32 - setup of our thing so we can actually
07:35 - move on to according
07:37 - so first of all uh inside our coding
07:40 - part
07:40 - uh we are still at the
07:44 - box part but uh and this project
07:47 - uh so it's like that's a little bit more
07:49 - fun so we are not going to use the
07:52 - uh blocks so change it to text
07:55 - so like that now
07:58 - before uh setup and loop and declaring
08:01 - any type of fields
08:03 - we have to do something with the include
08:05 - circle since this is like a
08:07 - extension so we have to get the hashtag
08:10 - include in the circle club h so this one
08:14 - all right afterwards we are going to do
08:17 - some uh declaring some field first
08:21 - uh first of all we are going to change
08:23 - our wait time for scalar
08:24 - so now we're going to get it constant
08:30 - long prescaler
08:35 - and our prescaler is basically
08:40 - one minute so six thousand six hundred
08:44 - sixty dollars sixty thousand
08:46 - milliseconds
08:48 - so this is the perspective and later on
08:51 - we're just going to change
08:52 - uh our time interval between uh for
08:55 - example 1 to 15 minutes or
08:57 - 5 minutes to 70 minutes something or
08:59 - longer time
09:00 - so all we're going to use is this
09:03 - prescaler
09:04 - and now declare our zero
09:08 - type minus variable
09:13 - and uh we're going to set our timestamp
09:15 - pin as
09:16 - 12 like our button so
09:25 - so this is our time set pen and
09:29 - now we're going to uh set that led pen
09:31 - so
09:32 - those are the time work so white
09:36 - one then one
09:41 - equals to pin eight and i'm going to
09:43 - copy and paste for
09:44 - three more times because it's four
09:48 - and nine content
09:59 - and eight
10:05 - [Music]
10:07 - all right so we are also
10:10 - setting our time set input as one uh our
10:13 - pet
10:14 - so fight time that
10:18 - input equals one so okay
10:21 - so in order to avoid our button command
10:23 - execute
10:24 - multiple times uh we have to create a
10:27 - boolean
10:28 - which is button activated
10:34 - equal to false
10:38 - all right so for our next uh thing we're
10:41 - just going to set up our time
10:44 - stamp
10:58 - and now we're going to do the timer
11:00 - counter
11:01 - so long
11:04 - time to row
11:08 - equals 0 correct now we finish
11:11 - all our declaration of our fields so we
11:14 - can actually move on to our site
11:16 - uh first of all we have to set up our
11:17 - leds we have to set up our
11:19 - buttons and our server so three things
11:23 - now we are going to get the pin mode
11:28 - first
11:30 - and our
11:36 - uh first minute so which is our
11:39 - pin eight
11:44 - and i'm going to copy this four three
11:46 - times again since it's like
11:49 - oh
11:53 - four pin nine 10 11 so
11:57 - two minutes four minutes and eight
12:00 - minutes
12:01 - all right so for our next thing uh we
12:04 - are going to digital
12:05 - write our personal markers high so this
12:07 - is like um every time
12:09 - we start our setup we're just going to
12:11 - have like the
12:12 - uh the first minute a one minute
12:15 - countdown as our like default setup
12:22 - so
12:30 - all right so for our next thing we're
12:33 - going to set our time to row
12:35 - as our times that input times our
12:38 - prescaler
12:39 - so time to roll
12:42 - equals to titan's long
12:46 - and time set input
12:49 - and times free scalar
12:54 - like that and well
12:57 - first of all we're going to set our
12:58 - pendulum that's our output 5 13
13:12 - and we're going to set our time step pin
13:16 - as our input
13:26 - with that okay the next thing we're
13:29 - going to do is actually we're going to
13:30 - attach our
13:31 - pin 3 to our circle control so
13:45 - this is like oh the original position
13:47 - right zero equals
13:49 - so row time mark
13:53 - oops tar mark
13:56 - equals two milliseconds
14:00 - and we're going to begin our server
14:09 - all right so for the purpose of
14:11 - debugging
14:12 - we actually want to print out something
14:15 - for testing so zero
14:19 - primes time
14:25 - to roll
14:33 - and zero 45
14:38 - to grow and dinosaur
14:44 - current pre-scaler
14:54 - and serial friends line
14:58 - three let's go
15:01 - all right let's finish our setup
15:05 - for all the buttons led lights and as
15:07 - well as like our server
15:09 - so for the lip part uh we have a couple
15:11 - things to do
15:13 - first of all we are going to see if our
15:15 - button is actually pushed
15:17 - um we also want to see our time input
15:21 - and to do something to wait until it's
15:25 - kind of turned
15:26 - for our feeder so first of all we're
15:29 - going to do our first
15:30 - condition which is if our button is
15:33 - activated which is
15:34 - um true so if
15:38 - button activate it
15:43 - and now
15:47 - 400 oops
15:53 - it's last time equals to
15:59 - and if this happens we want to actually
16:02 - see some changes so button
16:06 - activated equals to
16:10 - the pulse
16:15 - all right so this is our first condition
16:17 - for our second condition
16:19 - we want to check how if but it is not
16:22 - activated and then we want to see
16:24 - our time 10 times that pin so how many
16:26 - minutes we have set it to
16:28 - so f digital read
16:34 - time set pen and
16:39 - not button activate it
16:48 - all right so if our digital read times
16:51 - are premium
16:52 - uh not back back to notified it we want
16:54 - to set something so
16:55 - time set input
16:59 - equals to time set and put
17:04 - plus one and well
17:08 - since we are going to limit our time so
17:10 - input the max maximum value to 15 since
17:12 - we only have four led lights so that's
17:16 - like the maximum value
17:18 - uh for uh the indicator so
17:21 - we're just going to set it if we want to
17:24 - be like larger than 15 we're just going
17:26 - to set it back to one
17:27 - so if all right set and put
17:32 - if larger than 15
17:35 - we are going to set
17:40 - we are going to set our times and put
17:44 - back to one
17:44 - like that different
17:48 - uh more than 15 okay so
17:53 - we're going to set our digital right
17:55 - back to low
17:56 - for all albums
18:06 - okay now i'm going to
18:10 - copy two times
18:14 - [Music]
18:16 - four minutes and eight minutes mark
18:19 - so yeah and then
18:24 - well uh we're going to uh check
18:28 - our pens or after if that's a
18:32 - if that's actually high or low so so we
18:35 - are going to
18:36 - set up some boolean uh some local
18:38 - variables
18:40 - so
18:53 - right so for our
19:02 - which is fit
19:05 - read
19:08 - time set then put zero
19:13 - like that so yeah
19:17 - three more times put one
19:20 - two pick three and we just one
19:24 - two and three like that
19:27 - okay so for all these
19:30 - f fit zero for example
19:37 - uh we are going to digital write our
19:39 - first
19:40 - minute mark as high so
19:52 - and for output one two three as well
20:06 - like that so after that we're going to
20:10 - calculate the wait time for our next row
20:13 - so time to
20:16 - roll equal to 1.
20:20 - time set and third
20:23 - and times pre
20:26 - scalar okay
20:29 - so uh we're going to activate our button
20:32 - again
20:37 - if it's true
20:41 - okay so the next thing uh just for the
20:43 - debugging purposes
20:45 - we're going to do some zero print line
20:54 - time set and good
21:03 - time to roll
21:07 - and
21:10 - zero prince line
21:14 - it's time to
21:18 - uh so these are the debuggings for our
21:20 - first condition
21:22 - so for our second one we are going to
21:25 - roll our circle after we
21:27 - read all of our pens so if
21:31 - uh the our server only row only if the
21:35 - time
21:35 - is actually larger than our counter
21:38 - taxer row time
21:44 - mark that's larger than time to
21:47 - row like that
21:51 - and we're going to do something
21:54 - again okay so my circle
22:01 - right 180 so it's gonna turn
22:05 - 180 degrees and then delay
22:08 - for two seconds then
22:12 - change back to its original position
22:16 - yeah okay so uh we're going to uh
22:20 - save our current row time for our next
22:22 - row so that's why we have to do our row
22:24 - time mark as well
22:25 - row time
22:28 - mark and milliseconds
22:33 - and for our debugging purposes as well
22:37 - we are going to print some 0.9
22:48 - and server
23:02 - so we finish our second
23:05 - condition so for our uh for our third
23:08 - thing we have to do is our
23:10 - the only thing we have to actually
23:12 - update our current times right now
23:14 - equals two milliseconds
23:16 - so yeah okay so uh for our onboard led
23:21 - uh we actually wanted to have
23:22 - like work on something as well but this
23:25 - is not
23:26 - as important as the first to ash
23:28 - condition
23:29 - but we're going to do that too so
23:34 - now
23:39 - and our digital rate is not equal to 13.
23:47 - we're going to digital right
23:57 - uh our 13 is high
24:00 - and also
24:12 - that's 13 and
24:16 - um our time right now
24:22 - that's the last time
24:25 - equals to 140
24:30 - and we're going to digital right
24:36 - our 1013 is low
24:44 - so
24:49 - basically that's it for our
24:54 - project uh for our coding part
24:57 - so we can actually try it out uh
25:00 - it should be great i should be doing
25:02 - something before
25:04 - okay so there are some problems with my
25:06 - code uh
25:07 - we're going to debug that right now
25:21 - yeah so it's working um yeah
25:25 - capitalize agent different capitals and
25:28 - as well as like this spelling really
25:31 - really affects your code
25:33 - okay so it's actually working so you can
25:35 - see that it's like counting out right
25:36 - now
25:37 - so like seven or eight seconds uh we're
25:39 - not going to wait
25:41 - until one minute but yeah so here's the
25:43 - code
25:44 - so that's all for today so in this
25:47 - tutorial uh we create a
25:49 - pet feeder control using arduino and
25:51 - papercad
25:52 - and inside of think yeah we also use my
25:55 - circle like the circle control
25:57 - well i hope you like this video and
25:59 - don't forget to subscribe
26:00 - our other videos um also check out the
26:03 - the two of them
26:04 - um while you're waiting for the next
26:06 - video so thanks
26:07 - bye
