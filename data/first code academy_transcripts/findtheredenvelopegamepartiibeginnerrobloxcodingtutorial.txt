00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to our
00:02 - channel
00:03 - here we share beginner friendly coding
00:05 - tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft
00:08 - web programming and many more
00:10 - and today we're going to take a look at
00:12 - part two of
00:13 - our roblox treasure hunt game for this
00:16 - project i'll be using the code kingdom
00:18 - platform
00:19 - to make the code for the scoring system
00:22 - i will be using a numeric for loop to
00:24 - show the number of red envelopes that
00:26 - the player has found
00:28 - all right so let's get started
00:31 - all right so we want to open up the
00:33 - custom game file that we have created
00:35 - earlier
00:36 - now what we want to do is we want to
00:38 - click this plus sign right here to add a
00:40 - new
00:40 - file right and we want the file name to
00:43 - be called score
00:46 - and the class to be player
00:49 - and add us a local behavior so
00:52 - score player and local behavior
00:55 - and we can go ahead and click add all
00:58 - right
00:59 - and we're going to go ahead and click
01:02 - add
01:02 - method right here all right and we want
01:05 - to choose the one that says
01:06 - oncreate okay so function score on
01:10 - create now from the code library that's
01:12 - to our
01:13 - left we're going to drag out the for
01:16 - loop so we can actually search
01:17 - search it up as well okay we want this
01:20 - one right here the numeric for loop
01:22 - drag that in here okay so we want to
01:26 - start from
01:28 - one thick and then
01:31 - end five
01:34 - all right and the next thing we want to
01:37 - do is we want to drag
01:38 - in broadcast message so i'm going to
01:41 - search it up
01:42 - broad pass message right here
01:46 - okay bring that below the for loop
01:49 - and inside the text we want to type in
01:52 - find
01:53 - all ten red envelopes
01:58 - in five minutes tick mark
02:02 - all right and the time we're gonna put
02:05 - five okay
02:09 - now the next thing we want to do is we
02:11 - want to click add method again
02:14 - okay right down here and we want to
02:17 - choose uh we want to sorry we want to
02:21 - create
02:22 - a method called set score
02:25 - okay set score like that
02:28 - click create so now we have function
02:30 - score set score
02:32 - and we want to go ahead and click on
02:34 - this arrow right here
02:37 - all right and we want to create a
02:39 - variable
02:40 - a variable so we want it to be called
02:42 - new
02:43 - score and it's a number right
02:47 - the new score number and
02:50 - tick mark okay so this is how it should
02:53 - look like
02:54 - the function score set score and then
02:56 - new score right in here
03:00 - okay now the next step is we want to add
03:03 - in an
03:04 - object equals to update okay so i'll
03:07 - search up
03:07 - object this is what i mean object equals
03:10 - to update
03:11 - we want to drag it to this method right
03:13 - here
03:14 - now in the object all right we want to
03:17 - go ahead
03:19 - and create a variable called player
03:23 - score we want to make it a number field
03:26 - okay so switch it's a field and then
03:30 - number click mark
03:33 - all right so become self dot player
03:35 - score
03:36 - okay and in the update part we'll click
03:39 - on
03:40 - the new score variable
03:43 - okay like so all right so now after we
03:46 - do that
03:47 - we want to go ahead and add in a set
03:50 - stat so we can search that up set
03:54 - that right here and we're going to drag
03:56 - that below
03:59 - score right now for name okay
04:02 - we want to say red envelopes found
04:09 - okay now the value okay so we want it to
04:12 - be
04:13 - the new score variable right here
04:16 - okay so itself sets that red envelope
04:18 - sound and
04:19 - new score okay now we're going to go
04:22 - ahead and
04:23 - add in another method so click add
04:25 - method
04:26 - and this one we want to create our own
04:28 - new method called
04:30 - gain points so gain points
04:33 - okay and then from the code library we
04:36 - want to go ahead and drag in
04:38 - set score set score
04:42 - right here and we want to bring it
04:47 - inside this function okay set score
04:51 - and in the new score part we want to
04:54 - click on left plus right
04:57 - okay in the left part it will be player
04:59 - score
05:01 - okay right here and then in the right
05:04 - part
05:04 - plus one so every time we find a new
05:06 - envelope we get one point
05:08 - enter a number and then one right there
05:12 - okay so now we want to go back to the
05:16 - oncreate
05:16 - method which is the one right here
05:20 - and outside of the for loop we want to
05:22 - set score to zero
05:25 - okay so we can find that again set score
05:29 - we'll put it right outside so here
05:32 - okay and set it to zero enter the number
05:35 - zero
05:36 - okay so basically here is when the time
05:39 - is up we want to
05:40 - destroy the player all right and then
05:43 - we're going to go ahead and add in a
05:45 - wait block
05:46 - below our set score to 0 and we'll put
05:49 - 125 seconds all right
05:53 - and then after that's done we're gonna
05:55 - broadcast a message
05:57 - so broadcast message
06:00 - all right and we type in the text game
06:04 - over okay and it will be shown
06:07 - oops game over
06:11 - all right and it will be shown for three
06:13 - seconds so we put in three
06:15 - okay then after that we go ahead and
06:18 - choose
06:19 - destroy all right bring that here
06:22 - and it will become self destroy okay
06:26 - now what we want to do next is we want
06:28 - to go to the red envelope file right
06:30 - here
06:31 - okay and we want to add an untouched
06:34 - player method okay and what we want is
06:38 - we want the treasure to disappear
06:40 - when the player gets it so we're going
06:43 - to drag a destroy block
06:45 - to the method okay becomes self destroy
06:48 - and not only that the player also gained
06:51 - a point
06:52 - from getting the treasure so we're
06:54 - actually going to click this plus sign
06:55 - right here
06:56 - to add a new block and we're going to
06:59 - choose player
07:01 - okay and then we're gonna get choose
07:03 - this one
07:04 - game point the player gain points and
07:07 - then
