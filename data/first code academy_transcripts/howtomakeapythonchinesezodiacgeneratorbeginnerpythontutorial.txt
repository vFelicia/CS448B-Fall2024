00:00 - hi everyone and welcome back to our
00:01 - channel here we share beginner friendly
00:03 - tutorial videos on scratch roblox
00:05 - minecraft web programming and many more
00:07 - and today we're going to create a
00:09 - chinese zodiac generator in python
00:11 - so let's get coding the first thing that
00:14 - we
00:15 - will need to do is to import every
00:17 - important library that we will use
00:19 - and different libraries in python
00:23 - enable us to do different things there
00:25 - is quite a lot of them
00:26 - and in our case we're going to use
00:30 - a library called pill or pil which
00:33 - stands for
00:34 - python imaging library this python
00:36 - imaging library
00:37 - will enable us to open the chinese
00:39 - zodiac file at the very end
00:41 - so let's write our first line which is
00:44 - from
00:45 - pio capitalized import
00:51 - image and right now we're going to get
00:54 - the input from the user
00:56 - so name
00:59 - equals input we're going to use the
01:01 - function input
01:03 - which enables the user to write
01:04 - something and we will save it
01:07 - and also inside the brackets you can
01:09 - specify what kind of question do you
01:12 - want to ask and so
01:15 - what is your
01:18 - name this will be the first question now
01:22 - we're also going to check what is the
01:24 - year of birth
01:26 - so yeah
01:30 - equals input
01:34 - what is your birth
01:38 - yeah okay now the only problem with that
01:42 - is that in order to calculate the
01:44 - chinese zodiac you need to
01:46 - treat the year as a number because you
01:48 - need to divide it subtract things from
01:50 - it and so on
01:52 - but input returns a string which means
01:56 - it's a string of characters and it's not
01:58 - really recognized as a number
02:00 - and you can't divide it by a number for
02:02 - instance
02:03 - so in order to change it into a number
02:06 - we need to write
02:07 - int open bracket and close the bracket
02:09 - at the very end
02:10 - this stands for integer and integers are
02:13 - numbers like
02:14 - 0 1 2 3 4 5
02:17 - and so on so like normal numbers
02:20 - and we already have all the data
02:24 - so right now we're going to create um
02:27 - we're going to calculate the chinese
02:30 - zodiac
02:30 - so we're going to use something called
02:33 - conditional statements
02:34 - and and we'll start we're going to start
02:37 - for from an if statement so this is a
02:41 - simple condition
02:42 - if something happens then something else
02:43 - happens too
02:46 - and the condition for the chinese zodiac
02:49 - is yeah minus two thousand
02:55 - and it's remainder from division by
02:57 - twelve
02:58 - so if the remainder from division by
03:00 - twelve is equal to zero so if it's um if
03:04 - you can divide it by 12
03:06 - the sign is going to be a dragon
03:12 - okay and we're going to do a similar
03:14 - thing for every kind of chinese zodiac
03:16 - so then we're going to use another
03:19 - conditional statement but this one is
03:20 - going to be slightly different
03:23 - so else l
03:26 - if so else if
03:29 - yeah minus 200 2 000
03:33 - sorry yep 2 000
03:37 - and its remainder from division by 12 is
03:40 - equal to 1
03:41 - then we will have a snake
03:52 - okay and the reason why we use else if
03:55 - is that it enables us not to check it
03:59 - at all if the first condition is true so
04:02 - suppose we find that it is equal to zero
04:05 - that is
04:06 - that it is a dragon and and then
04:09 - we will not change uh we will not check
04:12 - anything that is below anymore
04:14 - so we'll just say okay it's a dragon
04:17 - fine
04:18 - we'll we'll leave it at that um
04:22 - so there will not be too many
04:23 - unnecessary calculations
04:25 - and you can also see a pattern emerging
04:28 - right because we have
04:29 - the division by 12 you have different
04:32 - remainders
04:32 - we have minus 200 every time and
04:36 - actually
04:37 - what you can do is copy and paste this
04:40 - um so that you can have different
04:43 - animals but written in the same way
04:46 - so let's copy and paste it actually
04:50 - and then we're going to only change the
04:54 - different different numbers at the end
04:58 - and also different
04:59 - names of the zodiac because they're
05:01 - different zodiacs so then
05:04 - let's change all the remainders to all
05:07 - the numbers
05:08 - from 0 to
05:13 - 10.
05:22 - and then we're going to write every
05:24 - possible chinese zodiac so after the
05:27 - snake
05:28 - comes the horse so let's
05:32 - make it a horse and
05:35 - then a sheep
05:38 - and then a monkey
05:42 - and after a monkey we have
05:45 - a rooster and after the rooster we have
05:50 - a dog
05:56 - and after the dog we have the pig
05:59 - and the rat
06:03 - and an ox so that's going to be
06:08 - another one and also
06:12 - a tiger now if you if you know all the
06:15 - chinese zodiacs by heart or if you just
06:18 - counted uh what i what i have just done
06:21 - you'll see that there is one missing
06:23 - because here is
06:24 - uh here we have only 11 of them
06:28 - and the reason behind that is that the
06:31 - last done is actually going to be a
06:32 - little bit different
06:34 - because we can of course write l if yeah
06:37 - minus 200
06:39 - percent sign 12 equals 11
06:42 - then do something else but
06:46 - actually the remainders of division by
06:50 - 12
06:50 - are only between 0 and 11. so we already
06:54 - know that we have
06:55 - already checked all the other options so
06:58 - if it's not 0
06:59 - not 1 and nothing between 0 and 10
07:03 - then it must be 11 there is no other
07:05 - option so we don't need to check
07:07 - this additionally we can just write else
07:10 - so in
07:10 - any other case which will be the case
07:13 - when it's 11
07:15 - the sign equals hair
07:28 - okay and this is everything when it
07:30 - comes to the calculation now let's
07:32 - display
07:32 - the results to the user so we're going
07:36 - to
07:38 - print a message so the message will be
07:42 - named
07:47 - and the name will be um and after the
07:50 - name we will call
07:51 - the year in which the user was born so
07:54 - we will display a short message
07:55 - and write that your
07:59 - chinese zodiac
08:03 - is
08:10 - and then we will add the sign so sine is
08:12 - the name of of the zodiac
08:14 - of the animal corresponding to the
08:16 - zodiac
08:17 - and the user will hopefully see the
08:19 - correct chinese zodiac that they belong
08:22 - to
08:23 - okay and now what about pictures
08:26 - so the only thing that's left is showing
08:28 - the picture so
08:29 - let's create the image path
08:34 - so let's call it image name
08:37 - and this will be the place where our
08:40 - picture is
08:41 - located
08:49 - so firstly we will check in the pictures
08:52 - folder and then we're going to look
08:54 - for the right chinese zodiac and then
08:58 - we're going to open the image using pill
09:00 - so let's say we want to
09:06 - open the image like that so we need to
09:09 - use the image.open function
09:13 - and the image.open function can have the
09:16 - name
09:17 - inside the parenthesis so this is
09:20 - because
09:22 - pill needs to know which kind of image
09:25 - do you want to have opened
09:26 - okay so then we just call the method
09:30 - called
09:30 - show so we have an image name
09:34 - and then we search for this image and
09:36 - then we show it to the user
09:38 - and this should be everything so let's
09:42 - check if it works so let's run the
09:44 - program
09:47 - okay so we see the first question what
09:49 - is your name so you write something
09:52 - and what is your birth yeah okay we also
09:55 - write something
09:57 - okay so we see the message your chinese
09:59 - zodiac is right
10:01 - um it's good and then a lot of windows
10:05 - but the most important thing is that we
10:08 - are able to see
10:09 - this beautiful rat at the very end so
10:12 - it's
10:13 - is the same as in the message one is red
10:15 - and the other is right as well
10:17 - so it works so that's it for today
