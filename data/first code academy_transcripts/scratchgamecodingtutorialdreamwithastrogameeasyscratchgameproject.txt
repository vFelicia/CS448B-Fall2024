00:01 - hello everyone welcome to first good
00:03 - academy
00:04 - today we are going to make a simple
00:06 - scratch animation
00:07 - called dream with astro in this project
00:11 - we are going to create an animation
00:13 - on scratch about our future dreams with
00:16 - an character called ashrae my first
00:20 - dream would be to be an astronaut
00:23 - secondly it would be a scientist
00:28 - and lastly my dream is to be a scuba
00:31 - diver
00:34 - so let's go ahead and see how we can
00:36 - make this project
00:37 - on scratch all right
00:40 - in the first step we are going to delete
00:42 - our cat
00:44 - once we delete our cat sprite next we
00:46 - need to add our astro sprite
00:49 - onto the scratch platform so you can
00:51 - find the link to download the pictures
00:54 - for your astro sprites
00:55 - on the description box below so once you
00:59 - have downloaded them
01:00 - next we need to upload them so to
01:03 - upload the image price i'm going to
01:06 - click
01:07 - on the choose a sprite option
01:10 - and i'm going to click on upload sprite
01:13 - option
01:17 - next i'm going to select my three astro
01:20 - images
01:22 - so i'm going to select astro astronaut
01:24 - astro scientist
01:26 - and astro scuba diver
01:29 - then i'm going to click on choose
01:33 - alright since our characters are big
01:37 - in size we need to resize them to be a
01:40 - smaller number
01:41 - so i'm going to click on astro astronaut
01:45 - and i'm going to reduce the size to be
01:48 - 50.
01:50 - same goes for my scientist prime
01:54 - and same goes for my scuba divers
01:59 - let's try
02:02 - all right so next i'm going to rearrange
02:05 - them
02:05 - onto the screen
02:09 - all right next we need to add our three
02:12 - backdrops
02:14 - so i'm going to click on stage and next
02:16 - i'm going to click on backdrops
02:19 - next i'm going to add my three backdrops
02:21 - with a title screen
02:23 - so i'm going to choose a backdrop so for
02:26 - my title screen i would add
02:28 - blue sky so for my astronaut i'm going
02:32 - to click on
02:33 - space and find a space related backdrop
02:39 - so i'm going to click on galaxy
02:43 - next for the side test i'm going to
02:46 - choose my backdrop
02:47 - as bedroom three
02:54 - and lastly for my scuba diver
02:57 - i'm going to click on an underwater
02:59 - backdrop
03:02 - i'm going to click on underwater one
03:06 - next i'm going to delete this plain

03:37 - with sure
03:42 - next i'm going to make it a little bit
03:44 - bigger so that
03:46 - it's going to be shown on my starting
03:49 - screen
03:55 - perfect next i'm going to write a
03:58 - subtitle that is going to tell us
04:00 - how to change our scripts so i'm going
04:03 - to click on the text
04:04 - option again and here
04:07 - i'm going to type
04:16 - and i'm going to make a center
04:21 - awesome now i have done with my starting
04:24 - screen
04:25 - so let's go ahead and code our project
04:28 - so i'm going to click on code while
04:32 - i'm on the stage all right
04:35 - so the first step would be to give the
04:37 - instructions that
04:38 - when i click on the green flag i just
04:41 - start on
04:42 - my starting screen which is the blue sky
04:45 - next i should instruct that while i'm
04:49 - changing backdrops
04:50 - it should play a background sound
04:54 - so i'm going to click on events
04:57 - and i'm going to drag in when the green
05:00 - flag is clicked

05:06 - try again
05:07 - switch backdrop to underwater one and
05:10 - i'm going to change it to the
05:12 - starting screen backdrop which is blue
05:15 - sky
05:16 - 2. next i'm going to control
05:20 - and i'm going to add a foreign block
05:23 - so that my sounds keep on playing
05:26 - forever
05:28 - next i'm going to sounds
05:31 - and i'm going to drag in the block
05:33 - called play sound pop
05:35 - until done
05:39 - next i'm going to choose my own
05:41 - background sound
05:42 - so i'm going to click on the sound tabs
05:45 - on the top here
05:48 - and i'm going to my sound library which
05:50 - you can access from
05:52 - here by clicking on the magnifying glass
05:56 - so i'm going to select a lively
05:58 - background music
06:00 - i'm going to find dance and i'm going to
06:03 - add
06:04 - this music dance matching and i'm going
06:07 - to delete the pop sound
06:09 - next i'm going to go back to the code
06:12 - i'm going to change the
06:13 - pop sound to be dance matching
06:18 - all right next i need to give the
06:20 - instructions that
06:22 - when i press my space key i should
06:24 - change my background
06:27 - so i'm going to events and i'm going to
06:29 - drag in the block card
06:31 - when the space key is express
06:36 - next i'm going to looks
06:39 - and i'm going to try again the block
06:41 - call
06:42 - next background awesome
06:45 - now we have finished coding for stage
06:49 - next let's see how we can call our
06:51 - sprites
06:53 - so i'm going to click on the first price
06:56 - that is astronaut
06:57 - all right in order to give our surprise
07:00 - an animated move we need to use
07:02 - costumes so what i'm going to do next
07:05 - would be i'm going to add some costumes
07:07 - for each
07:08 - sprite so first i'm going to click on
07:12 - costume
07:13 - since the astronaut have one costume in
07:16 - order to make
07:17 - multiple costume i'm going to right
07:20 - click
07:20 - and i'm going to click on duplicate
07:23 - which will create you a copy of the
07:26 - existing costume
07:28 - next i'm going to click on the select
07:30 - tool option
07:32 - and i'm going to select the whole
07:36 - astronaut next i'm going to
07:40 - flip my astronaut horizontally
07:43 - and i'm going to drag it upwards
07:48 - in order to give the moving effect that
07:51 - the astronaut is floating on space
07:54 - so i'm going to the first costume of
07:57 - astronaut
07:58 - and select this tool
08:02 - and then i'm going to select the whole
08:04 - astronaut
08:05 - and i'm going to bring it downwards
08:11 - so it'll be going from this to this
08:18 - next i'm going to add another costume
08:21 - while making my astronaut to be
08:24 - slightly rotated i'm going to duplicate
08:28 - another costume
08:31 - and select on this tool
08:35 - and select the whole astronaut like that
08:39 - make sure you're covering the whole
08:41 - astronaut when you're drawing the select
08:43 - two
08:44 - rectangle and i'm going to click on
08:48 - this rotation parameters
08:52 - and i'm going to rotate it like that
08:58 - next i'm going to repeat the same
09:00 - costume by flipping it horizontally
09:03 - i'm going to duplicate it once more
09:07 - and using the select tool
09:10 - i'm going to select the astronaut and
09:13 - i'm going to click on
09:14 - click horizontal and i'm going to
09:19 - rotate it a little bit slightly towards
09:22 - the left-hand side
09:24 - right now the astronaut have full cost
09:26 - here that is
09:27 - going to show you a floating moment
09:31 - awesome so let's go ahead add change the
09:34 - costumes for our
09:36 - scientist friend i'm going to click on
09:39 - scientists
09:40 - for the scientist i'm going to change
09:42 - the color of my liquid that is present
09:44 - on the test tube so i'm going to
09:49 - create a duplicate of this cost here
09:53 - and i'm going to use my magnifying glass
09:56 - in order to zoom
09:57 - in into the picture so i'm going to
09:59 - click on plus
10:01 - magnifying glass
10:09 - next i'm going to click on the brush
10:11 - tool
10:13 - and to change the color of the portion

10:33 - costume
10:36 - and i'm going to change the color of my
10:44 - portion
10:49 - and lastly i'm going to create another
10:50 - costume for my scientist
10:54 - and again with a different colored
10:58 - portion
11:08 - awesome so once we have created four
11:10 - costumes
11:11 - for our scientist right let's create
11:14 - some costumes for our scuba diver spray
11:17 - i'm going to click on screw by diamond
11:20 - and i'm going to duplicate the scooper
11:23 - diamond
11:26 - and i'm going to click on select two and
11:29 - select
11:30 - the whole section of school but i want
11:33 - like that
11:35 - and i'm going to flip the scuba diver
11:39 - horizontally and slightly
11:44 - or rotate it towards the right hand side
11:49 - a little bit next i'm going to draw a
11:52 - tube around that scuba diver
11:54 - to show that the scuba diver can flow
11:58 - i'm going to click on the paint brush
12:00 - too
12:01 - and i'm going to draw a
12:04 - tube around the scuba diver
12:08 - and i'm going to change the thickness of
12:10 - this to be 50.
12:24 - awesome so now once we have created the
12:26 - costumes for our surprise
12:28 - let's go ahead and code it so i'm going
12:30 - to start with my astronauts fry
12:34 - and i'm going to click on code tab
12:38 - all right so in the astronaut sprite
12:40 - first i need to code
12:42 - that when i click on the green flag it
12:45 - should be
12:45 - showing on my starting screen
12:49 - i'm going to click on events
12:52 - and i'm going to drag in when the green
12:54 - flag is clear
12:56 - so i'm going to click on looks and i'm
12:58 - going to bring the block mod
13:00 - switch costume to astronaut 4 and i'm
13:04 - going to change it to
13:06 - the first costume of my astronaut
13:09 - so in order to make sure that in my
13:11 - starting screen
13:12 - the astronaut is is shown with
13:15 - the first costume
13:20 - next i'm going to looks and i'm going to
13:23 - set up the position
13:24 - of my astronaut and i'm going to try
13:27 - again
13:27 - go to xn1
13:31 - so right now the x and y is going to
13:33 - show you the current location of my
13:36 - astronaut
13:37 - boy so i'm not going to change it
13:40 - next i need to give the instructions
13:43 - that
13:44 - when it is on the star screen i should
13:47 - show
13:48 - while on my other screens i should hide
13:51 - my astronaut spread
13:53 - so i'm going to events and i'm going to
13:55 - drag in
13:56 - when the backdrop switches to and i'm
13:59 - going to change it to be galaxy
14:03 - so i'm going to look and i'm going to
14:04 - drag in the show block
14:06 - and again i'm going to set up the
14:08 - starting position so i'm going to try
14:11 - again
14:11 - go to x and y next i'm going to change
14:14 - in the position to be
14:16 - 0 and 0 so that the astronaut starts on
14:20 - the middle of the screen
14:22 - next i'm going to instruct that it
14:25 - should change
14:26 - onto the first question so i'm going to
14:29 - change onto the
14:31 - first costume of my astronaut next i'm
14:34 - going to
14:35 - instruct my astronaut to say a sentence
14:37 - that
14:38 - is going to say i want to be an
14:40 - astronaut
14:41 - so i'm going to looks and i'm going to
14:44 - drag again
14:45 - say hello block for two seconds and i'm
14:48 - going to change this message to b
14:51 - i want to e
14:57 - let's and
15:04 - all right next i'm going to
15:07 - change my costume by using a repeat
15:10 - block
15:11 - in order to give the animate movement
15:14 - so i'm going to control and i'm going to
15:17 - drag in repeat 10 block
15:19 - next i'm going to looks and
15:22 - inside this repeat i'm going to ensure
15:25 - that
15:26 - astronauts should change its costumes so
15:29 - i'm going to try again
15:31 - the next costume block and put it inside
15:33 - the repeat block
15:35 - in order to give a smooth changing
15:37 - effect of costumes
15:39 - i'm going to add a weight type so i'm
15:42 - going to ctrl
15:44 - and i'm going to drag in wait one second
15:46 - block
15:49 - and i'm going to make it 0.5 seconds
15:54 - all right so i'm going to add another
15:57 - next costume block
15:59 - and finally i'm going to add another big
16:02 - block which is going to be
16:06 - 0.5 okay
16:09 - so we need to ensure that when the
16:12 - backdrop changes to the underground and
16:14 - the room
16:15 - the sprite astronaut should be hidden
16:18 - so i'm going to drag in the event block
16:21 - call when the backdrop is just two
16:24 - i'm going to make it bedroom three next
16:27 - i'm going to
16:28 - hide my sprite so i'm going to repeat
16:32 - the same block
16:34 - but this time i'm going to change the
16:36 - backdrop to be
16:40 - underwater and again i'm going to
16:43 - hide it all right now i need to make
16:47 - sure that
16:48 - once i'm in my underground backdrop and
16:50 - when i click on the space key again
16:53 - let's just start on my starting screen
16:55 - so i'm going to give the event call when
16:58 - the backdrop switches to blue sky
17:01 - i'm going to show the costume again
17:05 - and in this position so i'm going to
17:09 - motion
17:09 - and i'm going to drag again go to xn1
17:14 - so this would be our final chord for our
17:16 - astronaut spread
17:18 - next we are going to create the school
17:20 - blocks for our
17:21 - scientists all right first i need to
17:24 - instruct that when i click on the green
17:27 - flag
17:28 - the scientist should be on my first
17:30 - costume
17:31 - so i'm going to event and i'm going to
17:33 - drag in
17:34 - when the green flag is clear and next
17:37 - i'm going to looks and i'm going to try
17:39 - again switch costume block
17:41 - and i'm going to change it to be astro
17:44 - scientist which is my first costume
17:46 - next i need to instruct that when the
17:48 - backdrop switches to the room backdrop
17:51 - i should change my costume of my spread
17:54 - so i'm going to add the event called
17:56 - when the backdrop switches
17:59 - i'm going to add a repeat so that it
18:02 - keeps on repeating the
18:04 - costumes or changing my costume
18:07 - and i'm going to add a save block that
18:10 - is going to
18:11 - make my sprite to speak a message so i'm
18:14 - going to
18:14 - speak a message like
18:23 - so next i'm going to go to my looks
18:25 - block
18:26 - and i'm going to drag in next costume
18:29 - block
18:30 - so i'm going to add a weight block so
18:31 - that i can see my
18:33 - costumes being changed smoothly i'm
18:36 - going to control
18:37 - and i'm going to try again wait one
18:39 - second left
18:40 - and i'm going to change the time to be
18:43 - 0.5 seconds
18:45 - next i need to instruct that when the
18:47 - backdrop switches to
18:49 - the galaxy and the underwater i should
18:52 - hide my scientist spray
18:54 - i'm going to events and i'm going to try
18:57 - i'm going to drag in the block called
18:59 - when the backdrop switches to
19:02 - and i'm going to change to be galaxy
19:06 - so next i'm going to the looks block
19:09 - and i'm going to try again high block
19:12 - so i'm going to repeat the same codes
19:15 - again
19:16 - so i'm going to drag in another one
19:19 - backdrops it choose to block which is
19:21 - going to be
19:22 - underwater 1 and i'm going to hide my
19:26 - scientist spray
19:31 - so now i need to make sure that once i
19:33 - reach the underwater
19:34 - backdrop and when i click on the space
19:37 - bar
19:38 - it should go back onto my starting
19:41 - screen
19:41 - with my scientist being shown
19:45 - so i'm going to erase and i'm going to
19:48 - drag in when
19:49 - backdrops just do this time
19:52 - scientist should be sure awesome so once
19:55 - we have done our code blogs for our
19:57 - scientists right
19:58 - so let's go ahead and code our scuba
20:01 - diver spray
20:04 - so once again i need to instruct that
20:07 - when i click
20:07 - on the green flag i should be switched
20:11 - to my first costume
20:12 - and onto the exact location
20:15 - on my starting screen so i'm going to
20:19 - events and i'm going to drag you when
20:22 - the green flag is clicked
20:24 - next i'm going to locks and i'm going to
20:27 - drag in
20:28 - switch costume to block and
20:32 - i'm going to change it to be the first
20:34 - costume
20:35 - next i'm going to set up my starting
20:38 - location so i'm going to motion
20:41 - and i'm going to try again go to x and y
20:44 - plot
20:45 - so since i'm going to start with this
20:47 - location on my starting screen
20:50 - for my scuba divers fry i'm going to
20:54 - keep the x and y coding is as it is
20:58 - all right next i need to instruct that
21:01 - once the backdrop switches to the
21:03 - underwater
21:04 - i should move my scuba diver spray to
21:07 - the middle of the screen
21:09 - and then change costume all right so i'm
21:12 - going to
21:13 - events and i'm going to drag in when the
21:16 - backdrops you choose two
21:18 - and i'm going to change it to the
21:19 - underwater backdrop
21:22 - next i'm going to looks and i'm going to
21:26 - drag
21:26 - in the show
21:30 - so next i need to set up the position
21:32 - such that
21:33 - the scuba diver starts moving from the
21:36 - middle of the screen so i'm going to
21:38 - motion
21:39 - and i'm going to bring it go to x and y
21:43 - and this time i'm going to change x to
21:45 - be 0
21:46 - and y to be 0.
21:50 - next i need to make my scuba diver to
21:52 - speak out a message so i'm going to look
21:56 - and i'm going to try again say hello for
21:58 - two seconds
21:59 - block and i'm going to change the
22:02 - message to b
22:07 - all right so next i'm going to drag in
22:11 - a repeat block so i'm going to control
22:13 - and i'm going to drag in
22:16 - repeat 10 block next i'm going to
22:19 - looks and i'm going to drag in
22:22 - next cost here
22:27 - and i'm going to give away time so i'm
22:29 - going to
22:30 - control and i'm going to drag in wait
22:33 - time
22:34 - and change it to be 0.5 seconds
22:40 - next i need to make sure that my scooper
22:43 - driver
22:43 - is hidden when the backdrop switches to
22:46 - the
22:47 - galaxy and the blue backdrops
22:51 - so i'm going to event and i'm going to
22:53 - drag in the image
22:55 - one backdrop switches to galaxy
22:59 - i need to hide it so i'm going to look
23:03 - and hide blur and i'm going to repeat
23:07 - the same with my
23:08 - wrong background so
23:11 - i'm going to drag in when backdrop
23:13 - switches to
23:15 - bedroom 3
23:18 - and i'm going to hide it
23:23 - next i need to make sure that once again
23:27 - when i'm at my underwater backdrop and
23:30 - when i click on this face key
