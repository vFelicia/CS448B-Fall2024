00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back to our
00:01 - channel
00:03 - here we share beginner friendly coding
00:05 - tutorials on scratch
00:07 - roblox minecraft web programming and
00:10 - many more
00:11 - today we're going to create a fun roblox
00:13 - game called easy hobby game
00:16 - this tutorial will be divided into two
00:18 - parts this is the part 1
00:20 - of the tutorial in this tutorial we'll
00:22 - focus on the design of the game
00:25 - we'll learn how to use the part toolbox
00:27 - inside of roblox studio to play some
00:29 - blocks
00:30 - in which our character will jump over
00:32 - here we'll create cylinders and normal
00:34 - blocks
00:35 - while learning how to anchor blocks and
00:37 - duplicate blocks
00:39 - the main goal of the game is to reach
00:40 - the end to the fish pool
00:43 - right so let's get started to start
00:46 - let's create a project
00:47 - in base plate so let's go to new all
00:50 - templates
00:51 - and base plates here i'm gonna double
00:54 - click
00:56 - and wait for the server to load now i
00:59 - can move around by pressing the right
01:01 - mouse button and
01:02 - turning i can also use the wasd to
01:05 - control my movements
01:07 - first we should add our base plate so
01:10 - here
01:10 - we gonna go to home toolbox and we're
01:14 - gonna click
01:15 - to a box here and in the search bar
01:17 - we're gonna look up
01:18 - neutral spawn
01:22 - press enter and we should grab the first
01:25 - neutral spot and put it in our map
01:28 - make sure that we can see the symbol
01:31 - facing up
01:32 - so we know our character respond
01:34 - correctly
01:36 - next let's go to parts
01:39 - and let's click on blocks this will
01:42 - create a new block
01:43 - and we're going to be making three
01:45 - blocks so i can make
01:47 - two more blocks here by just clicking on
01:50 - parts
01:52 - and to edit the size i can go on to
01:55 - model
01:56 - scale and now i can
01:59 - edit the size of this box for the first
02:02 - box i'm going to make it the same size
02:04 - at this
02:06 - spawning um area
02:10 - and i'm gonna bring it high up a little
02:13 - bit higher like so
02:14 - and make sure between the three blocks
02:16 - are four stops in between
02:18 - i'm starting at the neutral spawn so
02:20 - four here
02:22 - and here i have four with this box back
02:27 - stretch the box out like so
02:32 - and i'm just gonna have a staircase
02:33 - pattern where the first one is the
02:35 - highest followed by
02:36 - second and then the third one will have
02:39 - the lowest height
02:41 - so again make sure there's four steps in
02:43 - between so one
02:45 - two three four
02:48 - now i'm going to stretch it the same
02:50 - width
02:52 - and stretch this out
02:55 - and i'll leave the highest exit we can
02:58 - also color these blocks
03:00 - if you want to make them more colorful
03:02 - and to color them we can click on the
03:03 - box we want to color
03:05 - model color and here we can pick
03:09 - whatever color
03:10 - that suits us i'm just going to pick um
03:13 - some random colors for these three
03:15 - blocks but you guys can
03:17 - mess around pick the colors you guys
03:19 - like
03:19 - [Music]
03:21 - now it's also important that we actually
03:24 - anchor these blocks
03:26 - um the point in the game is that after
03:28 - we remove this base plate
03:29 - the blocks will be remaining in the sky
03:32 - so to do this
03:33 - we should anchor so we're going to click
03:35 - on the box
03:36 - model underneath lock in group there's
03:39 - anchor
03:40 - so we press that and there's a gray
03:43 - highlighted anchor box um representing
03:46 - that we have successfully anchored it
03:50 - so we're going to do that with the other
03:51 - checkbox anchor
03:54 - anchor cool
03:58 - so now we shall add one more block so
04:00 - here
04:01 - i'll add another part and for this block
04:05 - we actually want it to be 20
04:07 - length by 4 width to specifically change
04:10 - the width and
04:11 - length we can go down over here to
04:13 - properties
04:15 - we can go down to parts
04:18 - and underneath size we can change the
04:21 - numbers
04:22 - to fit what we want here right now this
04:25 - represents the width of this box
04:28 - and here we shall have 10 so let's put
04:31 - in
04:31 - 10 and i want this box to be 15 length
04:35 - so i'll change the width to 50
04:38 - and this will give us a 10 by 15 block
04:41 - and
04:42 - i'm gonna drag it here and make it four
04:43 - blocks or four steps away from the third
04:46 - block like so
04:49 - and i'm going to change the color
04:52 - something like this and again
04:56 - i'm going to anchor it so press anchor
05:00 - now we're going to have have it so this
05:03 - block
05:04 - is anchored by a top block you have it
05:07 - anchored we should use the hinge
05:09 - but before we do that we should have a
05:10 - little anchor in the middle of this
05:12 - plank
05:13 - so we shall add another part
05:16 - here i'm going to stretch it out a
05:18 - little bit make it a little bit thinner
05:19 - like this
05:20 - and i'm going to place the in the middle
05:22 - of this plank
05:25 - and i'm going to change the color so i
05:26 - can distinct the two different blocks
05:29 - and again i want to anchor this
05:33 - now i'm going to create another block
05:36 - and this block will also
05:38 - be very long and very thin so here
05:42 - here i'll make the length to be 50
05:45 - but the width i'll keep at four and um
05:50 - here i'm actually going to make this
05:51 - higher and to do that we can go up again
05:54 - to properties
05:55 - here i'm going to move up until i get
05:57 - the data position
05:59 - and the second value is the y value
06:02 - which is the height
06:03 - this i'm going to add 10.
06:12 - and then the this block will be
06:14 - increased and raised to
06:16 - 10 whoops
06:21 - like so
06:25 - just wider like this
06:31 - to add a hinge we should go to again
06:33 - model
06:34 - and underneath create we can click on
06:37 - this upside down triangle
06:39 - with unhinge here
06:42 - it's important that we start out from
06:45 - the bottom
06:46 - and so we can start here
06:49 - so we click in the middle and we're
06:51 - going to look up
06:52 - and click on the middle of this box
06:56 - creating a hinge connection so now we
06:58 - can see on the right side
06:59 - we have the hinge constraints and it's
07:02 - important to set this block
07:04 - not to anchor so leave it unchecked on
07:06 - the anchor
07:07 - and now if we actually go to play we can
07:09 - see that this block
07:10 - will be uh kind of hanging off this
07:13 - hedge
07:14 - hedge is also a movable joint um
07:17 - commonly found
07:18 - in doors it is a connecting part that
07:21 - connects the
07:22 - static part of the door to the moving
07:24 - part of the door
07:26 - and is also commonly seen in swings now
07:29 - let's continue with the second part of
07:31 - this obstacles
07:32 - so on the left side of the hinge
07:34 - platforms
07:35 - i want to add a block that is 12 blocks
07:38 - away so i'm gonna go to model
07:40 - parts and blocks and here i'm gonna
07:43 - scale it
07:45 - and i'm actually gonna manually type in
07:47 - the value so i can get exactly what i
07:49 - want
07:50 - here the first value should be 20
07:56 - and the second value here should be 10
08:00 - and i'm going to move it
08:04 - about 10 blocks away from the hinge so
08:07 - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
08:10 - 8 9 10
08:14 - and again it's important to anchor this
08:17 - now let's add a cylinder
08:19 - to add a cylinder i will go to home
08:23 - parts a cylinder
08:26 - but notice that the cylinder is actually
08:28 - upside down where the rounded is um
08:31 - side is on the side so that the
08:33 - character cannot actually jump on this
08:35 - otherwise sort of slip off
08:38 - to actually rotate it back we shall
08:40 - scale it first
08:42 - and the point is to scale it so that
08:46 - the round part is actually almost as
08:49 - well and the trick is to scale this as
08:52 - small as possible like a
08:53 - like a cube almost and that way we can
08:56 - actually rotate this
08:57 - without too much problems and now after
09:00 - we have rotated the right orientations
09:02 - we can scale it back up
09:08 - we can also adjust the height if you
09:09 - wanted to
09:11 - and again i'm gonna make this a tiny bit
09:13 - bigger
09:16 - and a tiny bit higher
09:19 - and once again we want to keep about
09:21 - four stubs between each block
09:25 - now it's time to add another platform
09:28 - here that is almost squares so we add
09:32 - block
09:33 - four steps away
09:36 - and here i want it to be 10 by 10 so i'm
09:39 - gonna go down
09:40 - to size first of all i'm going to change
09:44 - the 10 the third value i'm going to
09:46 - change it to 10
09:48 - and move it four stubs away from this
09:52 - and now we're gonna duplicate these two
09:54 - blocks so we can select two
09:56 - these two blocks by holding the shift
09:58 - button
09:59 - over here we can see that they're
10:01 - selected
10:02 - we can right click duplicate
10:06 - and you'll duplicate these two blocks
10:09 - i'm just going to drag these two blocks
10:10 - to the right
10:14 - and continue dragging them four steps
10:16 - away
10:18 - like that and now we have
10:21 - our first kind of template of the course
10:25 - and again make sure that everything is
10:27 - anchored so i'm gonna anchor this
10:29 - cylinder anchor line this platform
10:33 - the cylinder should be anchored and this
10:36 - platform should be entered so basically
10:38 - the only thing that's not anchored here
10:40 - is this platform everything else it is
10:44 - anchored
10:46 - so this is basically the main part of
10:49 - our project
10:51 - for the remainder of the project what
10:53 - we're going to do
10:54 - is first we can select this base plate
10:57 - over here top right in the side of our
10:59 - explorer
11:00 - and we can simply remove it so we can
11:03 - just right click
11:04 - and press delete
11:08 - and you can see that will be our whole
11:11 - game
11:13 - but before we delete this actually i'm a
11:15 - command z
11:17 - so what we want to do is copy and paste
11:19 - this layer
11:20 - this l-shaped layer into our map so that
11:22 - we can continue
11:23 - use this obstacles so to do that let's
11:28 - select
11:29 - on the explorer
11:33 - underneath uh underneath base plates
11:37 - let's
11:37 - select part and then let's select the
11:40 - last part and holding shift
11:42 - i'm gonna left click here which will
11:44 - select everything in between
11:46 - and now i'm gonna right click and press
11:48 - duplicate
11:50 - and it's important that in our model we
11:52 - have the move selected
11:53 - so now we can move the newly duplicated
11:56 - block any way we want
11:59 - so um i'm actually going to move it
12:01 - trish
12:02 - right next to the end of this block
12:07 - like so
12:10 - and for time purposes i'm going to start
12:12 - doing the fishing pond at the end
12:14 - you guys can mess with this however much
12:16 - you want and
12:17 - add and you know remove blocks as you
12:19 - will
12:20 - so to add the swimming pool in the
12:22 - grassland let's add a final block
12:24 - so i'm gonna go to model part block
12:29 - and here i'm gonna move to scale and
12:32 - make this
12:32 - a little bit bigger than the usual box
12:36 - like this and here instead of color
12:40 - i'm gonna go to materials i'm gonna go
12:43 - down middle
12:44 - to grass and i'm gonna change the color
12:48 - to uh green like this
12:53 - and now let's add in the swimming pool
12:56 - so here i'm gonna go to home i'm gonna
12:59 - go in toolbox
13:01 - and right here right next to where we
13:03 - looked up neutral spawn let's look up
13:04 - fish pond and we'll press enter to look
13:09 - and we're gonna grab the first one the
13:11 - fishpond by
13:13 - jz5245
13:16 - and uh it's gonna be a little bit big so
13:18 - we're gonna click on scale
13:20 - and make this a lot smaller
13:24 - and then use move move to the center
13:27 - of the grassland and again don't forget
13:31 - to anchor this scratch block
13:33 - and yeah that's really it don't forget
13:36 - that the only thing
13:37 - we should not have anchored is these
13:40 - flying
13:41 - parts anything else should be anchored
13:44 - and now the last part of this project is
13:46 - to go back to explore
13:48 - scroll up until we see base plate
13:52 - and we can simply right click and delete
13:57 - and now our map will be completed
14:01 - and we can play um and the respawn is
14:04 - here and then we have to make our way
14:05 - through this parkour map
14:06 - and um the destination is going to be
14:08 - the fishing pole
14:10 - so that's all for today in the next
14:12 - video
14:13 - we'll go over how to use lua to change
14:15 - the cylinders color
14:16 - and directions don't forget to subscribe
14:19 - to our channel to check out next part
14:20 - for this project
14:22 - thank you bye bye
