00:00 - so if you guys remember last few
00:02 - sessions we did this project that is
00:04 - related to the coronavirus situation as
00:08 - well that we want ourselves to eat more
00:11 - vitamin which is orange and dodge away
00:14 - from the virus and each time the monkey
00:18 - eats the orange we gain some points and
00:22 - then each time the virus hit the monkey
00:26 - you see so yeah we lose one score and if
00:32 - you guys like on my project you would be
00:34 - able to see the remix button as well and
00:37 - because this is already my project I
00:40 - don't see the remix button there and
00:45 - what I'll do is to go inside and I want
00:50 - to make some adjustment to this project
00:54 - and so I think the adjustment that I'm
00:59 - gonna make is to simply have an
01:01 - additional source of vitamin such that
01:05 - my monkey could be healthier and let's
01:09 - do that so let's say this additional
01:16 - feature of our game is whenever we press
01:21 - the spacebar an apple would appear on
01:26 - the screen so just so just now what I
01:31 - did perfectly was click on choose the
01:34 - sprites at the bottom right corner and
01:38 - this will pop up and yeah basically I am
01:42 - choosing the Apple it could be a banana
01:46 - or other things as well so so yeah you
01:54 - can see the sprite is here and what we
01:59 - want to do is to simply go back to the
02:03 - orange so remember the orange is already
02:06 - kind of doing what we want the apple to
02:08 - do which is to move from the left
02:11 - side of the screen all the way to the
02:14 - right hand side and after they after it
02:18 - hits the edge of the wall off the screen
02:21 - it will come back to the left side and
02:23 - then go all the way again and every time
02:28 - the orange hit the monkey the score goes
02:33 - up by five so it's pretty much what we
02:37 - want except that this time we're not
02:40 - asking the Apple to change to start
02:45 - moving with space but we want the Apple
02:49 - to start moving closer so we want we
02:53 - don't want the Apple to start moving
02:54 - with a green flag but we want the Apple
02:57 - to start moving with the same Sparky so
03:01 - what we want to do just now I quickly
03:03 - did was to click a duplicate function
03:09 - and I'm going to drop that into Apple
03:17 - okay so the duplicate function is
03:20 - slightly problematic sometimes but just
03:24 - have to do it a few times yeah you can
03:29 - see that here also kind of like has to
03:32 - duplicate it here so now that I have
03:35 - this one you can see that this is a
03:37 - forever block and has the Apple every
03:44 - time it goes to X axes of 206 which is
03:48 - kind of on the left-hand side and and
03:51 - then pick a random Y coordinates between
03:55 - 120 and - 120 - caustic 120 which is
04:00 - basically the whole vertical axis of the
04:07 - screen and you want to repeat this until
04:11 - either you touch the edge of the screen
04:16 - or touch the monkey
04:21 - and so every like until you touch the
04:25 - edge of the monkey you want to keep on
04:27 - changing the x-coordinate of Apple buys
04:32 - to me and that is meaning that okay we
04:36 - want the Apple to move to the right hand
04:39 - side three units of x-coordinate each
04:43 - step and every time we touch the monkey
04:49 - we will change this quarter by five and
04:54 - we could actually change this into maybe
04:58 - the Apple is four powerful than orange
05:01 - then we can just change it okay let's
05:03 - make it like 10 and then maybe because
05:07 - it's more powerful we will make it
05:09 - harder to catch and which means that we
05:13 - want the x-axis to actually change
05:16 - faster so a little bit faster speed so
05:21 - you might wonder okay well now that I
05:24 - have added the Apple there why is it not
05:28 - changing well that's because there's no
05:31 - offense block yet right so we need an
05:34 - event block to update the apples to
05:40 - trigger the Apple to move so this time
05:43 - remember our goal was to trigger our
05:47 - Apple to move whenever we have whenever
05:52 - we have press the spacebar and so I have
05:56 - gone into the events block and chose
05:59 - this block called space key press and
06:06 - that's it so we just need to snap that
06:11 - into the forever block you'll hear a
06:14 - snapping sound normally and let's see
06:18 - how that goes
06:20 - so I'm gonna start the game I'll stop
06:22 - the game first and press
06:30 - this and let me press now the spacebar
06:36 - okay seems like I'm this is working
06:44 - pretty well it's moving faster for sure
06:46 - faster than the orange and also faster
06:52 - than the virus and let's see if my score
06:56 - is going up the way I wanted okay yeah I
06:59 - went from 104 to I won four and looks
07:05 - pretty good and the only thing that I
07:08 - would not like I feel like we could
07:11 - change this is let's go back to here
07:13 - right so do you see this that like the
07:16 - when I stop the game and restart it the
07:19 - Apple is just here and it's kind of like
07:24 - not moving until I press the spacebar
07:27 - but then if I don't press the spacebar
07:32 - ever the Apple is just lingering here
07:35 - and it doesn't make a lot of sense so
07:38 - what we can do is to first make the
07:44 - Apple invisible by pressing here so if
07:48 - you see here I would just choose this
07:52 - the invisible sign and so nicely that
07:57 - the Apple is disappearing whenever we
08:00 - start the game that at least there is no
08:02 - Apple and it's kind of like the secret
08:04 - weapon that we can call out with a space
08:08 - bar key and so now is press a space well
08:15 - now that I press the space key I need
08:17 - some way to ask the Apple to show up so
08:21 - luckily scratch has made it really easy
08:24 - for us and all we need to do is to click
08:27 - into the looks drawer and choose the
08:32 - show block so here is we're programming
08:38 - the Apple sprite that whenever we press
08:42 - the spacebar we
08:43 - wanted to show we want the Apple to show
08:47 - up there we go so I press the spacebar
08:50 - and right away the app will show up yep
08:57 - so this is a much better implementation
09:00 - of the game that we are able to first
09:06 - hide the Apple and then only if we press
09:10 - the spacebar this Apple will show up but
09:16 - the only thing that you can see here is
09:18 - that now that I've played the game once
09:21 - because the Apple has shown up on the
09:25 - screen it's not disappearing even if I
09:29 - remove even if I press the red stop
09:34 - button and if I press the green flag
09:37 - again it again is stuck there so it's
09:40 - not great and what we need to do is to
09:44 - add an additional block to ask the game
09:51 - to every time we start the game the
09:54 - Apple needs to hide itself so how we
09:59 - will do it is to go inside our defense
10:05 - block and again find our green flag
10:08 - block and this time we don't want to use
10:16 - the show block but we want to use the
10:19 - hide block so the hide block is
10:22 - basically the opposite of show and it
10:25 - basically tell scratch that we are going
10:29 - to hide our Apple every time we start
10:32 - the game and only if I press the space
10:36 - key that the Apple would show up and
10:40 - let's see if that works okay so now I
10:42 - have to stop the game I've stopped the
10:45 - game and I am pressing the bread
10:49 - pressing the green flag and there we go
10:53 - so the Apple is nicely hidden
10:57 - now I just have this simple game with
10:58 - our orange and virus just looks really
11:03 - nice and clean and all we need to do is
11:08 - to then now press the spacebar and boom
11:15 - our Apple is now showing up and moving
11:19 - along nicely
11:22 - and I'm gonna pause this video like this
11:26 - stop this game and test it again and see
11:30 - if I press the green flag does the Apple
11:34 - disappear again okay so the answer is
11:39 - yes would have successfully implemented
11:41 - this project level 2 so this game is
11:47 - where we're implementing the version 2
11:49 - of this game so just to recap what we
11:52 - did was starting with this simple
11:57 - project of the orange and the virus and
12:02 - now we wanted to add an apple to our
12:07 - game that only appear if we press the
12:11 - green before I press the spacebar key
12:14 - and the beauty of this is that we have
12:19 - duplicated the blocks from the orange
12:24 - orange sprite and drag that into the
12:28 - apples rights and the only thing that
12:31 - has changed from the orange and the
12:34 - apple sprite is the offense Bob is
12:38 - changed from the green flag to play King
12:43 - to the spacebar pressing so here is the
12:48 - main difference and we quickly also
12:51 - realize that the Apple has been around
12:54 - for the entire time and even if we stop
12:57 - the project if we stop the game and we
13:00 - haven't press the space key yet it's
13:03 - still keep on showing up and that's not
13:05 - great so we decided to first
13:10 - make our Apple disappear here so it's by
13:14 - default invisible and every time we
13:21 - press the space key we will ask the
13:25 - Apple to show up using the looks block
13:29 - here and afterwards we also realized
13:36 - that after the States after the Apple
13:39 - show up it doesn't disappear with our
13:43 - game stopping
13:44 - so we then finally added this final
13:48 - block to ask the Apple to hide itself
13:54 - every time we start the game and we use
13:58 - we did that by the by using the offense
14:01 - block of green black dot click and also
14:06 - using the looks block of hiding the
14:10 - Apple that we did today is a version
14:16 - number two of our eat the vitamins
14:18 - project and we added our Apple and
14:21 - learned how to use the event block to
14:24 - help us control the appearance and
14:28 - disappearance of the Apple
