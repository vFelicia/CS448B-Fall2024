00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to our
00:01 - channel
00:03 - here is your beginning friendly coding
00:04 - tutorials on scratch roblox
00:06 - minecraftware programming and many more
00:08 - so today we are going to create a
00:10 - progress bar
00:15 - so in this project we will be creating
00:17 - an html page with some css and jquery
00:20 - called emoji analytic block
00:22 - the idea of the project is that we want
00:24 - to have a loading bar in progress while
00:26 - showing emoji at the same time different
00:28 - colors as it moves from the start to the
00:30 - end of the bar
00:31 - the webpage uses
00:33 - html for the text and css for your
00:35 - design and scrolling and jquery for the
00:37 - progress bar movement and animation
00:39 - within loading of emojis
00:42 - so let's get started
00:46 - all right so let's get go ahead and
00:48 - create our web page
00:50 - first i'm going to cope and create a
00:52 - custom project i'm going to
00:54 - uh click on the pen
00:56 - and then for our project we're going to
01:00 - name it as emoji loader
01:04 - okay
01:05 - so we're going to start the project by
01:07 - coding the html part first so for our
01:09 - html okay so first of all we're just
01:12 - going to add a div
01:13 - and division
01:16 - class
01:17 - um which is demo in this case
01:24 - and then like that first
01:26 - and then
01:27 - okay so in this
01:33 - okay we are going to create an
01:35 - src link uh this will link to the
01:39 - awesome library which we which we'll be
01:41 - using to add in their emojis
01:43 - above the loading bar of our website so
01:46 - script
01:56 - okay
01:57 - so
01:58 - like this
02:00 - so this will be our script
02:09 - like this
02:10 - okay
02:12 - so
02:13 - and then afterwards i'll create a
02:16 - division called support and inside this
02:19 - division create a data definition called
02:21 - container
02:22 - the container
02:24 - will contain some images of the emojis
02:26 - from the font awesome library
02:28 - while add5i with each class of emoji one
02:31 - two three and four and five you can
02:33 - search for these emojis in the w3 font
02:36 - awesome library if you want to change
02:37 - the emojis make sure that the dev is
02:39 - closed
02:42 - okay so afterwards we're going to create
02:44 - a paragraph tag with the class of
02:46 - support text and have the text say
02:49 - loading this should be placed inside the
02:51 - support class as well so don't close our
02:53 - division yet so
02:56 - p
02:57 - class
02:58 - equals to
03:01 - support
03:05 - text
03:08 - and then
03:10 - loading
03:15 - okay afterwards
03:17 - we can close this
03:21 - now
03:22 - create a division with a class of loader
03:25 - and this we have to create another
03:26 - division with a class of loading
03:28 - progress
03:29 - excited this referred refer to the bar
03:32 - um
03:33 - well first yeah just end it
03:35 - first of
03:37 - class
03:46 - perfect now we're done with our html
03:49 - part
03:50 - so we can move on to our css part
03:54 - okay so is that a css part so first of
03:57 - all we're just going to give what our
03:59 - body a background color
04:01 - of 1b 1b and 1b
04:03 - and a height of
04:06 - 1000 feet each
04:15 - now we are going to make the loader and
04:18 - the loading progress which will be the
04:20 - colorful bar have them use the display
04:23 - of flex and then align the items to the
04:25 - center
04:30 - all right
04:32 - so now create a demo a dot demo for the
04:35 - class of demo
04:38 - then we're going to add in a height of
04:39 - 500 pixels with a margin background
04:42 - color
04:43 - uh webkit box shadow most black shadow
04:46 - box shadow overflow
04:48 - for the radius and position
04:50 - so let's go for the demo first
05:06 - okay
05:07 - so
05:08 - perfect
05:10 - okay so now we're just going to give the
05:12 - loading progress a class and a height of
05:14 - like 40 pixels and then a border radius
05:16 - of 20 pixels
05:18 - well
05:19 - okay first of all let's go for the
05:21 - loading process
05:27 - uh well this part
05:30 - should be adjusted to flex and then we
05:32 - have the transition transition of all
05:36 - four like seven four seconds uh we also
05:39 - need to give this with uh to ten percent
05:42 - so that's why we add three more d's
05:44 - thanks
05:45 - so
05:47 - okay
05:50 - let's flex
05:56 - okay anyways
05:58 - for the loading emotion uh let's code it
06:00 - first
06:09 - now
06:10 - create three classes
06:12 - make one for excited
06:14 - smiling face code sweat
06:16 - open mouth co sweat
06:18 - and give each of these property a
06:21 - background color or you can pick any
06:23 - color you like or fold along the hex
06:25 - codes so you can just
06:27 - search it
06:28 - inside our website so you can choose
06:31 - whatever you like
06:32 - so for example excited
06:40 - so next we are going to create three
06:42 - classes make one of them a grooming
06:44 - phase expression last phase and then
06:46 - finding your face you can add any color
06:49 - you like here for the background color
06:50 - and follow or show a hex code ah this is
06:53 - for the bar color that will move in the
06:55 - progress bar as a mooji loads so
07:12 - after creating all of these we are going
07:14 - to create a class called dot support
07:17 - text
07:18 - uh this with refers to the text that
07:20 - says loading
07:21 - so
07:23 - okay this should be given a position of
07:24 - a relative
07:26 - and then a column point uh given left of
07:28 - 75 pixels and then give it the font of
07:32 - um monster it i don't know i'm going to
07:35 - pronounce that okay make sure that the
07:37 - font size is 25 pixels and the height of
07:39 - the font is 600
07:41 - so
07:51 - okay so at this text uh we should give
07:54 - the line height
07:56 - here for five pixels and make sure we're
07:58 - going to add uh some spacing uh in
08:01 - between the letters this tech will be
08:02 - using animations so we're just going to
08:04 - give it an animation name of color
08:06 - change
08:07 - and then a duration of three seconds and
08:09 - then add in an animation iteration count
08:12 - for the infinite
08:14 - so that it won't stop
08:18 - right
08:19 - so now we're just going to create a css4
08:21 - class of emoji one two three four five
08:24 - uh one two three four so then we're just
08:26 - going to give the position now relative
08:28 - and make sure that there's like a line
08:30 - height of 25 20 pixels and give it a
08:32 - left of negative 20 pixels
08:35 - give this a spacing of 15 pixels and
08:37 - then uh a height and width of 50 pixels
08:40 - 10 animations are given an animation
08:43 - name
08:44 - of color change and then an animation
08:46 - duration of three seconds and then add
08:48 - an animation iteration count of incident
08:51 - so basically it's
08:53 - almost like the same as the one that we
08:56 - did about i just like the larger numbers
08:59 - like what is the margin line height
09:02 - margin height and width like that the
09:04 - line and the position those are the
09:08 - different ones
09:13 - the last part of cfs in this part we're
09:17 - just going to
09:18 - create a keyframe which will help run
09:21 - the animation
09:22 - write in the color change animation type
09:25 - in form and then to add in the color
09:27 - that you would want to add
09:29 - then i'll close it with the semicolon
09:32 - sign
09:33 - so
09:39 - perfect so now with mr css part
09:42 - so most importantly we're just going to
09:44 - the gs
09:46 - now
09:49 - so
09:51 - inside our javascript
09:53 - we're going to add in a function in the
09:55 - javascript script which is called no
09:57 - name function
09:58 - so
10:00 - let's start with that first
10:06 - okay
10:08 - so
10:09 - there's no name function
10:11 - uh we're going to create four variables
10:13 - make one of the
10:15 - one for the loader progress bar loading
10:17 - motion and then sport text
10:19 - adding their location on the web page by
10:21 - referencing the document and then using
10:23 - the data syntax for the curious selector
10:25 - and adding
10:26 - in the class name
10:37 - now next we're just going to create a
10:39 - variable called emotion color and then
10:41 - add an array and then inside and in the
10:44 - class that we have earlier made in the
10:46 - css
10:47 - well as this will help us to bring the
10:49 - background colors that we set for the
10:50 - emojis so
10:54 - all of those
10:56 - complete smelling plays on cold face
10:59 - like open mouth whole square rinsing
11:02 - phase expressionless phrase like these
11:04 - so we're just going to add it
11:06 - okay now next we're just going to create
11:08 - a variable called emotion underscore ctr
11:11 - and then give it to the value of zero
11:13 - and i make a variable of immersion text
11:15 - with the third value of complete
11:17 - whoa
11:19 - and then this complete thank you for
11:20 - waiting emoji ending emoji so
11:24 - exactly just like that
11:28 - shirt half
11:30 - put it right
11:32 - here
11:35 - okay
11:37 - okay
11:38 - now
11:42 - uh we're just going to create a variable
11:45 - called motion
11:47 - nope we're going to cut off a variable
11:50 - called loading and then create a
11:52 - function
11:53 - uh and then inside this function we are
11:55 - going to create a variable called ctr
11:56 - and then give a value of 10.
11:58 - then create another function called and
12:01 - and in
12:02 - set interval
12:03 - then we are going to add a conditional
12:05 - to check if center is equal to 20 30 45
12:08 - to 50 60 70 80 8890
12:11 - and then adding emotion underscore ctrl
12:14 - have the value equal to the chat style
12:16 - change style and then adding this
12:19 - edit and else if ctr is equal to 100
12:23 - then they will want to have it change
12:24 - emojis and have the english phone to be
12:26 - cleaved
12:27 - as emoji changes the support text in the
12:30 - hdmi to the settings motion text and
12:32 - then have the loaders displayed to none
12:35 - and then have the button display the
12:37 - block
12:38 - afterwards we're going to add in
12:40 - progress bar style
12:41 - width and then add in the value of ctrl
12:43 - and then a percentage assigned
12:46 - and add in ctr plus plus we can test
12:48 - timer setup 500
12:50 - so let's do that okay
12:58 - new function
13:07 - [Music]
13:10 - ctrl
13:11 - 10
13:13 - set interval
13:21 - and then f c t r
13:24 - equals to 20
13:30 - or
13:35 - jesus does a lot 19
13:38 - 30
13:41 - 40
13:44 - 50
13:45 - 60
13:47 - 70
13:48 - 80
13:50 - 90.
13:52 - so
13:54 - 30
13:55 - 40
13:57 - 50
13:59 - 60
14:00 - 70
14:02 - 18.
14:26 - and then if there's not any of these
14:28 - between 20 to 90.
14:30 - we are just going to change our c here
14:32 - to 200.
14:38 - well if c carries with 100 basically
14:42 - not
14:43 - change it to 100 we're going to check if
14:45 - ctr is equal to 100
14:46 - then we're just going to change
14:49 - our style
15:04 - and then we're going to clear info
15:11 - support
15:13 - text
15:14 - finger
15:17 - hdml
15:24 - and launcher
15:27 - style
15:30 - display
15:34 - one
15:40 - button
15:42 - style
15:45 - play
15:47 - block
15:50 - and then
15:51 - for our progress bar
16:06 - outlet
16:10 - [Music]
16:19 - ctrl
16:22 - and then afterwards we're just going to
16:25 - say that
16:27 - 500
16:29 - for this
16:30 - whole thing
16:31 - to be at
16:33 - and then next we're just going to create
16:35 - a function change style with a parameter
16:37 - of ind
16:38 - and then add in the variable of target
16:40 - ind and then give it a value of id plus
16:43 - one
16:45 - then add in progress bar dot class list
16:47 - dot remove and then emotion color inside
16:50 - the parameter
16:52 - what this line does is actually to
16:54 - remove the emoji that first display and
16:57 - then moves to the second emoji
16:59 - under this add-in progress
17:03 - dot bar.classlist.ad and then emotion
17:04 - color target id
17:06 - um
17:07 - and then
17:10 - we're going to uh what underneath or
17:12 - we're just going to add in the loading
17:14 - emotion
17:15 - uh the individual and then have it equal
17:18 - to emoji id
17:20 - or this response to the emoji that we
17:22 - have in our array then typing return
17:24 - target ind
17:26 - and after this have the function loading
17:29 - and run and then close this function
17:33 - so this is basically the last thing
17:53 - okay so it's actually working so you can
17:56 - see that
17:57 - that's
17:58 - the cool thing and then you can see that
18:00 - the emoji is changing so basically
18:02 - that's it for our project
18:07 - so that's it for today in this tutorial
18:10 - we create a web page that make use of
18:11 - html css and javascript to create an
18:14 - emoji loader which changed in color as
18:17 - it progressed and then
18:19 - displayed in the emoji at the same time
