00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back to the
00:01 - channel
00:03 - here we share beginner-friendly
00:05 - tutorials on minecraft
00:07 - roblox scratch web programming and many
00:10 - more
00:10 - for today's project i'll be designing a
00:12 - game using minecraft redstone
00:15 - using minecraft redstone will allow us
00:17 - to design circuits
00:18 - and many different contractions that
00:20 - activate automatically
00:23 - this video is the second part of the
00:25 - obstacle course
00:26 - so let's get started in this second half
00:29 - of the project
00:30 - we'll design two more traps the first
00:32 - trap consists
00:34 - of a parkour map with a flying arrow
00:37 - obstacle here this rain of arrows
00:41 - uh when the liver is turned on we'll
00:44 - start firing arrows
00:46 - and the objective of the game is to have
00:48 - the user jump across without getting hit
00:50 - by the arrows
00:50 - the second obstacle uh we provide a
00:53 - ladder for the use to climb up
00:57 - and once the user has climbed up um
01:00 - you can see that there's a slime block
01:01 - six blocks away
01:03 - and the objective is to jump and hit the
01:05 - slab block and
01:06 - land on the uh target square
01:10 - and if you miss you get you know thrown
01:12 - to lava or you just
01:13 - die from fall damage so um let's begin
01:17 - so we're gonna open up the same
01:19 - minecraft world that we made for our
01:20 - first part of the obstacle course
01:23 - so that we can continue to add on our
01:25 - other two obstacles
01:26 - so let's continue
01:32 - let's start by making the reign of
01:34 - arrows obstacle
01:37 - to begin we want to have a concrete
01:39 - blocks
01:40 - for me i'm using stone and what we want
01:43 - to do is place down 12 blocks
01:46 - side by side so 1 2 3
01:50 - 4 5 6 7
01:53 - eight nine ten eleven
01:56 - twelve so we start by placing twelve
01:59 - blocks like this
02:01 - each side we want to place down three
02:04 - blocks um alternating
02:05 - so i'm going to place that one block
02:08 - leave an air
02:09 - another block and another block and um
02:13 - sorry for actually mining this we don't
02:14 - have to do that
02:16 - and we'll do the same thing on the left
02:18 - side
02:20 - so here we're gonna put one block leave
02:22 - for space
02:23 - put down a block leave the space and put
02:25 - down another block like this
02:27 - so now we should have one block one
02:30 - space one block one space one block
02:32 - two spaces one block one space one block
02:34 - one space and one block
02:36 - just like that now we should
02:40 - grab dispensers so here i'm gonna take
02:42 - out my this
02:44 - my pistons type in dispensers
02:51 - and i'm gonna put the dispensers now
02:53 - where the blocks
02:54 - have two blocks long so every one of
02:56 - these six spots i'll put down the
02:58 - dispensers like this
03:04 - this is going to be the wall that we're
03:05 - going to have shooting arrows
03:08 - if you like this video so far don't
03:10 - forget to subscribe and like our videos
03:13 - continuing from what we have started
03:16 - let's have three blocks and the glass
03:18 - are just for
03:18 - reference so i'm gonna put down four
03:20 - blocks like this
03:22 - so that i have four block of space and
03:25 - here i'm gonna put down
03:27 - our obstacle course where our opponent
03:30 - or our
03:32 - and here i'll put down our path where
03:34 - our player will actually trying to
03:35 - parkour
03:37 - here we can have blocks like this
03:40 - and i'm just gonna make them jump
03:41 - through blocks randomly like so
03:48 - and the goal of the game is to have the
03:50 - user jump across without getting hit by
03:51 - the arrow and knocked off
03:53 - now i want to build another five box
03:56 - away so i'm gonna build
03:57 - five glass blocks for reference
04:00 - and here i'm going to start putting down
04:02 - the wall
04:07 - the wall be a 4x2
04:10 - and on top of it i'll put them three
04:12 - more blocks like this
04:15 - now i need to grab a lever so i'm going
04:17 - to grab
04:18 - sorry liver
04:21 - now put it right here
04:26 - and behind this block where the liver
04:28 - lies i want to put down the redstone
04:30 - torch
04:32 - and if i turn off the lever
04:35 - you can see the torch would turn off and
04:37 - i turn it on the torch turn back on
04:40 - next i actually want to build a little
04:42 - platform here
04:44 - so we can actually do our um
04:47 - redstone circuits so similar to what we
04:50 - did here i'm gonna put
04:52 - three blocks like this
04:56 - and here we will be doing the same
04:58 - restaurant contractions so here i'll put
05:00 - down the restroom repeater
05:02 - press some dust across and
05:06 - first stone repeater back
05:09 - and you see this circuit has started
05:12 - and if you turn the liver off the
05:14 - circuits turn off
05:15 - turn it back on and it will turn back on
05:18 - the final step to this project is to
05:20 - connect the circuit to the back
05:22 - of the dispensers so
05:25 - i would do that by digging a hole
05:28 - underneath so the user cannot see
05:30 - um where the restrooms are going so here
05:33 - i'm gonna put down the block bring the
05:36 - restaurant down
05:38 - now start mining
05:46 - and for reference i'm gonna go over here
05:49 - to the
05:51 - other side where i want the rest to come
05:52 - out of and now i take a hole
05:54 - three blocks down and i start digging
05:57 - across until i reach the hole i've made
06:04 - and it is important to note that
06:05 - redstone dust does not carry the
06:07 - signal forever so we should put down a
06:09 - restroom repeater
06:11 - every now and then to refresh the power
06:19 - like so
06:22 - and now we can bring this redstone dust
06:24 - up
06:26 - back here and another
06:29 - redstone repeater and now on the last
06:32 - part is to connect
06:34 - it with our dispensers
06:37 - and we can just do that by placing
06:39 - restaurant dust on top
06:44 - of the blocks that's connected to the
06:46 - dispensaries
06:50 - and now if i just grab arrows from
06:54 - any places and i put some of them here
07:00 - you can see that there arrows are
07:01 - shooting
07:03 - automatically and it will shoot for
07:05 - every one of these
07:07 - and if i turn off the deliver
07:10 - they will stop so we can continue
07:13 - actually putting the arrows in our
07:14 - inventory
07:15 - and i'm just gonna throw the arrows down
07:18 - on the floor
07:19 - so that i can pick them up later and
07:20 - then fill it up
07:22 - so here let me put 60
07:26 - i'm gonna try and put 64 arrows in every
07:28 - one of these
07:36 - okay and to end
07:40 - this obstacle course let's add some lava
07:43 - on the floor so
07:44 - when the users are knocked off they will
07:46 - actually get burned
07:49 - here we can add some spots where
07:53 - every now and then we can have lava
07:56 - blocks
07:58 - like so so now let's start the game
08:02 - by pressing deliver and we can see the
08:05 - arrows are flying up
08:06 - like this and the goal of the game to
08:09 - jump across without getting hit by the
08:10 - arrows
08:13 - next we're going to make our final
08:14 - obstacle called a
08:16 - leap of faith for this project we will
08:19 - need
08:20 - to build up and um the heights
08:24 - can theories but we recommend between 12
08:26 - blocks to 16 so here i have 1
08:29 - 2 3 4 5 6
08:33 - 7 8 9 10
08:36 - 11 12 and you can go higher if you want
08:40 - but 12 bucks is
08:41 - i'm going for now we should use that
08:44 - ladder
08:45 - and make sure we put a ladder on every
08:46 - block so the user can successfully climb
08:52 - up
08:55 - next i'm gonna grab another glass block
08:58 - for reference
08:59 - and i'm also gonna grab a slime ball
09:03 - here we want to have the slime ball
09:07 - uh slime blocks around six to five six
09:10 - to
09:11 - seven blocks away so here we can put six
09:14 - glass blocks
09:17 - for this line and slime blocks if you
09:20 - land on it does not take um
09:22 - any fall damage from the user so the
09:24 - goal of the game is for the user to
09:26 - climb up through the ladder
09:29 - jump on top of the slime blocks and
09:32 - bounce to the destinations
09:34 - so here we can see that if i miss i
09:37 - won't hit anything but if i balance it
09:40 - if i hit it i'll drop bounce back up
09:44 - and we can make the final platform like
09:48 - this
09:54 - and i'm gonna put a red one here
09:57 - signaling that this is the final target
10:03 - like so and again
10:07 - i'm gonna make this game a little bit
10:09 - more interesting by putting lava
10:11 - around our optical targets
10:15 - so here i'm gonna take holes around
10:19 - this landing pad and
10:25 - i'll fill it up with lava
10:41 - and yeah and this is the game of our
10:44 - final obstacle
10:46 - so user can jump and climb up
10:55 - and they can try to jump land on the
10:58 - platform and
11:01 - win our game so that is all for today i
