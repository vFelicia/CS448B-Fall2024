00:00 - hello everybody welcome back to our
00:02 - channel
00:03 - here we share beginner friendly coding
00:05 - tutorials on scratch
00:07 - roblox minecraft web programming and
00:09 - many more
00:10 - today we're going to create a web
00:12 - programming project called 3d
00:14 - picture cube so we all know
00:17 - mother's day usually come on the second
00:19 - sunday in may
00:20 - so in this project i'll teach you how to
00:22 - use html and css to create
00:25 - this 3d picture rotating tube
00:28 - for this special occasion in this
00:30 - project i'll teach you how to use
00:32 - uh keyframes and transform properties to
00:35 - make the pictures rotate and end mate
00:37 - like this
00:38 - so uh yeah let's get started so i have
00:42 - gone ahead
00:42 - in codespan.io and created a new pen
00:46 - so here let's get started with our html
00:50 - so for our html we want to have a big
00:53 - div
00:53 - and this div is going to have a class
00:57 - called wrapper so classical wrapper
01:00 - and let's close out the div for wrapper
01:03 - over here
01:06 - so now we have a div class called
01:07 - wrapper um we want to create
01:09 - another div class in here so we'll
01:12 - create another div class
01:14 - whoops creates another div
01:17 - and this class will be called box dash
01:20 - area like so and again let's close up
01:25 - this div for box slash area
01:28 - and within box dash area we want to have
01:32 - five more divs and each diff is going to
01:35 - have
01:36 - one side of the cube and the reason why
01:39 - we only need five instead of six
01:42 - is because the fifth side of the cube
01:44 - actually overlaps with the six when
01:46 - we're doing the
01:47 - uh animation so um the six side never
01:50 - got shown so that we only need five
01:53 - sides of the tube
01:54 - so here i'm gonna make the first cube um
01:56 - class name of box one
02:00 - and now close the div next i'll make
02:03 - uh four more divs like this so div class
02:06 - of
02:06 - equals box two now close to this
02:10 - and i'm gonna make a bit of class equals
02:13 - box three
02:15 - and then close the div and i'm gonna
02:17 - make two more so here
02:18 - div class will be equals to box four
02:22 - and i'll close the div and then lastly
02:26 - i will have my box five
02:32 - just like so and so in our html we have
02:36 - a main diff uh called wrapper
02:40 - inside the wrapper we have a bigger
02:42 - second bigger div
02:43 - called box arena or box area
02:47 - and inside the box area we have the five
02:49 - sides of our cube
02:51 - that we're gonna be rotating from
02:52 - showing pictures
02:54 - so um yep that is the html setup for
02:57 - this project
02:58 - so going to the css let's begin by
03:01 - constructing the design for the overall
03:04 - website so let's go ahead to css and
03:07 - edit
03:08 - the body here we want to apply a margin
03:11 - and padding serum so we want to go
03:14 - margin enter 0 and padding
03:18 - i have 0 as our input
03:21 - so now our margin and padding on all
03:24 - four sides will be
03:25 - 0. next we want to be
03:29 - changing and aligning the div in the
03:32 - center so here we will have
03:33 - justified content
03:37 - to center this way our main axis of the
03:40 - website will be
03:41 - centralized and now let's do align items
03:45 - and also to center so now the diff of
03:47 - body will be centralized as well
03:50 - now let's make the background color to
03:52 - be pink to
03:54 - follow the spirits of mother's day
03:57 - and lastly we want to change the display
04:00 - type to flex
04:02 - having a display types of flex allows
04:05 - the
04:06 - divs inside to change size correspond to
04:09 - the
04:09 - parents so here um we'll have the div to
04:13 - be
04:14 - the same size as this parent's container
04:17 - so that
04:17 - flips flex really just allows
04:21 - overall adaptability for the website
04:24 - so it will change size depending on your
04:26 - screen size which is very
04:28 - helpful now let's take a look at wrapper
04:32 - here we just want to set the size for
04:34 - the wrapper and set the margin to the
04:36 - around
04:36 - so that nothing will be uh distracting
04:38 - us
04:39 - so here let's go ahead and change the
04:42 - wrapper
04:45 - and here um inside the wrapper let's
04:48 - change the height and width to be 300
04:50 - pixels so here i will write
04:53 - width to be 300 pixels and set heights
04:57 - also to 300 pixels and again we're gonna
05:00 - set a margin
05:01 - around uh the whole side so we're gonna
05:04 - set 15 percent to the right
05:06 - and top side and auto on the left
05:09 - and the bottom side so we'll type margin
05:13 - 15 space auto
05:16 - just like this
05:20 - next let's go ahead and do our css for
05:23 - the box
05:24 - area so let's go down and type box
05:27 - area in box area we want to actually
05:31 - define
05:32 - the animations and here we actually be
05:34 - using
05:35 - webkit animation this is to make sure
05:39 - that this
05:40 - animation will be accessible from any
05:43 - browser we use
05:44 - um so if you just use animation
05:46 - sometimes some browser does not support
05:49 - um just plain animation so if we add in
05:52 - webkit
05:52 - and make sure that um our browser will
05:55 - support the animation
05:57 - so here we write down the name of the
05:59 - animation we're gonna name it animate
06:02 - and the whole animation is gonna have 10
06:05 - seconds of animation
06:06 - so we want each uh kind of la uh
06:10 - the loop of animate to be 10 seconds
06:13 - and we're gonna write ease in and out
06:16 - like this
06:17 - and this will slow down the beginning
06:19 - and the end of the animation providing a
06:21 - smoother
06:22 - transition and we also want this to loop
06:25 - forever so at the fourth parameters
06:28 - let's type in
06:29 - infinite like that so we have
06:33 - webkit animation the name is animate it
06:36 - goes on for 10 seconds the whole
06:37 - animation
06:39 - ease in and out provides uh instructions
06:42 - to
06:43 - the start of the animation and end of
06:44 - the animation and infinite
06:46 - tells that we should loot this forever
06:48 - so we'll keep doing this animation as
06:50 - long as this website is getting loaded
06:53 - next let's set um just a normal
06:56 - animation now
06:58 - and here um we will have the same
07:00 - parameters
07:01 - and the point is that if the computer
07:04 - does not
07:05 - support uh animation it will use webkits
07:08 - but if it does support the normal
07:10 - animation we'll just use that instead
07:13 - so here that's why we have two
07:14 - declarations of animation
07:16 - one being webkit and one being just
07:19 - plain animation
07:21 - now we want to do um some kind of
07:24 - transform property to smooth
07:26 - out the animation and make it more um
07:30 - smooth so here let's add in a webkit
07:33 - uh transform style
07:37 - and now we can set the transform style
07:38 - to preserve 3d
07:43 - preserve 3d like that
07:47 - and again we're gonna do one without the
07:49 - webkit
07:50 - so we're gonna write transform style
07:54 - preserve 3d
07:57 - just like that so this preserved 3d
08:01 - um is a very important css option that
08:04 - allows us to
08:04 - blend in other elements into our main
08:07 - parents
08:08 - object so here um again continuing
08:12 - off with our webkit and just normal
08:14 - style we're gonna apply a webkit
08:17 - of um transform origin
08:22 - like so and here we're gonna put in 100
08:25 - pixels
08:28 - space 100 pixels space 0
08:36 - and again we're going to do one without
08:38 - the webkit so here we can write
08:40 - transform origin
08:43 - and again it will take in the same
08:45 - inputs
08:46 - 100 pixels 100 pixels and zero
08:51 - and lastly um this is the case for
08:53 - internet explorer
08:55 - we can apply ms
08:58 - transform origin and this will make sure
09:00 - it'll work um
09:02 - in internet explorer so here again we're
09:06 - gonna use a 100 pixels by 100 pixels
09:09 - and zero so this would be
09:13 - the css for a box area
09:16 - so now let's set up our keyframes
09:18 - animations so right now our keyframes
09:20 - has been
09:20 - a lot assigned the name of animate
09:24 - so in this animate animation we have
09:28 - um all five sides to show in 10 seconds
09:31 - over here
09:32 - uh the full duration of the animation
09:34 - and the way we're going to show the
09:36 - pictures uh
09:37 - pretty much one by one is by rotating
09:39 - our cube um
09:41 - and setting up our pictures um with an
09:43 - ankle so that
09:44 - whenever we rotate it will show one of
09:46 - the sides but not
09:48 - all five sides so here let's define our
09:50 - keyframes
09:51 - so here we can do add keyframes
09:56 - and we can write enemy this is the same
09:59 - name as we have over here
10:01 - now we're defining this anime um
10:04 - animation
10:05 - and here we want to write from and two
10:08 - and in here um the from is going to be
10:11 - the beginning of the animation
10:12 - while 2 is going to be the end so here
10:15 - we can write
10:16 - webkits transform
10:20 - and we're going to rotate the x-axis
10:24 - to 0 degrees rotate
10:28 - the y-axis to 0 degrees
10:31 - and rotate the z-axis
10:35 - to zero degrees and this would be the
10:38 - first line
10:39 - and this would be the from so in the
10:42 - beginning we want to have
10:43 - no rotations with our um
10:46 - with our box area and
10:50 - at the end we also want it to go back to
10:52 - the uh
10:53 - first uh side of the cube so it will be
10:56 - the exact same line so here we can just
10:58 - kind of retype what we have here so
10:59 - webkit
11:01 - transform rotates x to be
11:04 - zero degrees of rotates y
11:08 - also to be zero degrees and again rotate
11:12 - z will be zero degrees as well
11:18 - and now after we have this from into um
11:21 - we can actually details the very
11:25 - percentage of the animation so we can
11:27 - say at 16
11:28 - or 35 of the animation completion we
11:31 - want to reach the state
11:33 - so using percentage we can actually
11:35 - layer the whole animation
11:37 - um pretty much from zero to 100 so here
11:40 - we're going to have
11:41 - 16 this is 16 of the way to the whole
11:45 - animation
11:46 - um here we want to apply a webkit um
11:49 - transform and here we want to rotate
11:53 - our y axis so here we'll rotate
11:56 - our y to negative 90 degrees
12:00 - and this will change it will rotate our
12:04 - box area by 90 degrees to the y axis
12:07 - and again to make sure that this webkit
12:10 - um
12:11 - is used on all browsers we can just
12:14 - simply type in
12:15 - one without the webkits here we can say
12:17 - webkit y
12:19 - rotate y negative 90 degrees and this
12:22 - will run
12:23 - on browser that supports it and those
12:25 - that does not support the normal css
12:27 - animation
12:28 - will be able to run the webcase all
12:31 - right
12:31 - so now we have the 16 um this is showing
12:35 - from
12:35 - the first side of the cube to the second
12:38 - by just simply rotating on our y
12:40 - axis and you can imagine we have two
12:43 - more sides in the y
12:44 - axis that we can show so we can keep
12:45 - rotating the y
12:47 - but um for a cube you can kind of just
12:49 - mess around the degrees and then
12:52 - between how you layer up each percentage
12:56 - you can see how the cube rotate as an
12:58 - animation
12:59 - so here i'm going to add 33 this is the
13:02 - second part of the animation
13:05 - so here we want to apply a webkit um
13:09 - transform again and now this time we
13:12 - want to rotate the y
13:14 - axis by again negative
13:17 - 90 degrees so we're actually not
13:18 - changing it and now we're going to
13:20 - rotate the z-axis
13:22 - to 90 degrees
13:25 - and again we're going to do a version
13:27 - without the webkit so again i can just
13:30 - copy and paste this
13:31 - like that and you can copy and paste the
13:34 - same code without the webkit part
13:39 - so now that we've done 33 and 16 let's
13:42 - keep going the next step is going to be
13:44 - at 50
13:45 - of the animation here we again want to
13:48 - apply the webcam
13:49 - uh transform uh property
13:52 - here we want to transform it from
13:54 - transforming the rotate y value to
13:56 - negative 180
13:58 - uh degrees or negative 180 degrees
14:02 - and our rotate z will still remain at 90
14:06 - degrees
14:08 - and again we can just copy and paste
14:10 - this transform
14:11 - as it will be the same
14:16 - awesome after 50 let's go to 66
14:21 - here again we'll be applying the webkit
14:22 - transform so webkit
14:25 - transform and now we'll be rotating
14:28 - the y value once again so rotate y and
14:31 - here we'll put in
14:32 - negative 270 degrees
14:36 - and for the rotate z will remain it at
14:40 - 90 degrees
14:42 - and again you can copy the part without
14:44 - the webkit
14:46 - and paste it right underneath it this
14:49 - so that for each step of the animation
14:52 - there are two things we can do
14:53 - um if one of them doesn't work
14:57 - and here actually um this from and two
15:00 - um i actually made a mistake
15:02 - there's no web kit on the second line
15:04 - because that
15:05 - is the pattern we've been going for for
15:07 - every separate animation
15:09 - so remove this dash webkit dash on the
15:12 - second line from
15:13 - from into
15:16 - now the last step of our animation is
15:20 - going to be at 50
15:21 - uh it's going to be at 83 of the
15:23 - animation
15:24 - and this is um as you can imagine
15:27 - for from here we can show the first
15:29 - picture
15:30 - second picture third picture fourth
15:33 - picture
15:35 - fifth picture now we're gonna have to
15:36 - rotate back so here we're gonna have
15:38 - have
15:39 - webkit transform
15:43 - and we're going to have rotate x by
15:46 - negative 270 degrees
15:49 - and that will be our only transform so
15:51 - here we can again rotate
15:53 - x by negative 270 degrees
15:56 - just like so and this would be the whole
15:59 - animation
16:01 - for our animate
16:06 - just like so and something we should do
16:11 - uh to prepare ourselves in case we do
16:13 - have the use of webkit animation
16:15 - is that we should create the webkit
16:17 - keyframes and
16:18 - um all of the code will actually be
16:21 - exactly the same
16:22 - since in here we have considered both
16:24 - cases
16:25 - so here let's just copy and paste from
16:27 - keyframes animate to the end of the
16:29 - decorations
16:30 - copy you can either ctrl c
16:33 - or you can right click and say copy and
16:36 - then go down
16:38 - um tap down a couple of lines and simply
16:40 - paste it
16:42 - so now we have two of these animations
16:44 - and change your second one where you
16:45 - type
16:46 - to be at webkit like that
16:51 - so we'll just add in this dash webkit
16:53 - dash in front of our keyframes
16:56 - and now we have defined this webcam
16:59 - animation as well
17:02 - awesome so now um the final thing is we
17:05 - have to do is
17:06 - define the css for these boxes
17:09 - so here we can actually define all of
17:11 - them at once and just classify them in
17:13 - general and give them a size
17:15 - to do that so we can do box area
17:18 - and we can select all the diff inside
17:20 - the box area so here
17:22 - all of these dips will be affected since
17:24 - it is inside of this diff called box
17:26 - area
17:28 - here we just want to give it a position
17:30 - of absolute
17:33 - uh we want to change the width to be 300
17:35 - pixels
17:36 - and the heights could also be 300 pixels
17:39 - because as you might remember
17:40 - in the very beginning we have turned the
17:42 - wrapper to this size
17:46 - and the final thing we'll do is change
17:48 - the line height
17:50 - to be 300 pixels as well
17:54 - so next um we should finish this project
17:56 - by setting up our
17:57 - div the five side of the box
18:01 - so here let's do the first box so we can
18:03 - do this by box
18:05 - area and selecting dot box one
18:10 - here i will first add a background image
18:14 - so i'll write background image and i'm
18:16 - gonna give it an url
18:18 - source and um the link is gonna be in
18:20 - here
18:22 - so i have picked up um a picture myself
18:25 - uh you guys could pick out any pictures
18:27 - you want as long as you guys have
18:29 - a link to the picture or way for your
18:31 - computer to load the picture
18:33 - you can load it in here and
18:36 - after that let's change some of the
18:40 - properties let's make sure that this
18:42 - picture will be
18:44 - centralized and fill up the whole box to
18:46 - do this let's change the background
18:48 - size to cover and let's change the
18:52 - background
18:54 - position to center and center
18:58 - and this three lines um apart from the
19:01 - url
19:01 - of course will be the would be the three
19:04 - common factors between the
19:06 - five different boxes um and the
19:09 - things that they differ is going to be
19:10 - the transform
19:12 - um underneath here so here let's first
19:14 - define the transform
19:16 - for box one uh again we're gonna have to
19:19 - be sure to include the webkit transform
19:21 - as one of them
19:23 - to support all types of operating
19:25 - systems and
19:26 - browsers so here our web uh kit
19:29 - transform would have a translate of z
19:32 - and then we say 100 pixels this
19:35 - translate z means that we can move
19:38 - on the z axis 100 pixels both ways
19:41 - and this is the maximum animation we can
19:43 - do and again we're going to set up a
19:45 - transform without the webkit
19:47 - here we're going to say again translate
19:49 - z to be 100 pixels
19:56 - so what i've quickly done here is after
19:59 - our box ones which we did together
20:01 - i've inserted four more boxes
20:05 - so box two box three box four and box
20:08 - five
20:09 - and as you can see the background size
20:11 - and position are the same for all four
20:13 - of them
20:13 - which is the same as our box one with
20:17 - cover and center center and the
20:19 - background image just have a different
20:21 - url
20:21 - for different pictures but as you can
20:24 - see the three lines of code are pretty
20:25 - much identical
20:27 - so now let's go over each box and let's
20:29 - change the webkit um
20:31 - transform and the normal transform value
20:33 - for each one of them
20:35 - so for box two we again are going to
20:37 - apply a webkit
20:39 - uh transform for box two we're gonna
20:42 - change to rotate y
20:44 - here we want to put in a value of 90
20:46 - degrees
20:48 - and the second thing we want to change
20:50 - is again the z so let's write
20:52 - translate z and put in 100 pixels
20:57 - and again we can do the same trick
20:58 - without the webkit and just
21:00 - from transform highlight it all the way
21:03 - to the end of this
21:04 - ctrl c go down ctrl v
21:07 - and we'll paste the second line and um
21:11 - yeah so let's do the same thing for box
21:14 - three
21:16 - so for box three if you want to apply a
21:18 - webkit
21:20 - transform um the first thing i'm going
21:22 - to do is rotate y
21:24 - we want to change this to 90 degrees
21:27 - we want rotate x to be also 90 degrees
21:32 - and again we want to have the translate
21:34 - z to be at 100 pixels
21:38 - okay and again we're gonna have to write
21:41 - a transform
21:43 - without the webkit but with the same
21:44 - parameters so we can easily just do this
21:46 - by copying pasting
21:48 - this the second part of this one
21:51 - without the webcam so this is our
21:55 - box three so now now let's take a look
21:59 - at
21:59 - box four again we're gonna apply a
22:02 - webkit
22:02 - transform and here we're gonna have
22:06 - rotate y be
22:09 - a 180 degrees
22:12 - now i'm going to have rotate z to be uh
22:16 - 90 degrees and again translate
22:20 - z to be a hundred pixels
22:24 - and again we can just drag in from
22:26 - starting from transform to the end of
22:27 - the semicolon
22:29 - and just copy and paste this part and
22:31 - still be the same as this webkit without
22:33 - simply without the webkit uh keyword
22:37 - and for our fifth box um let's again add
22:40 - in a webkit
22:41 - transform and here we want to say rotate
22:45 - x
22:46 - to be negative 90 degrees and translate
22:49 - z to be a hundred pixels
22:53 - and again we want the part without the
22:55 - webkit
22:56 - transform so we just select transform
22:59 - to the semicolon go down and copy and
23:02 - paste it
23:03 - awesome and as you can see now our
23:06 - pictures
23:07 - for this 3d picture cube is completed
23:12 - so that is all for today in today's
