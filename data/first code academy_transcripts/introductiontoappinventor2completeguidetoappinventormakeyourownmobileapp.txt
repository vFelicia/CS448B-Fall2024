00:00 - hello everyone today we're going to talk
00:04 - about App Inventor App Inventor
00:07 - is a tool that App Inventor is a web
00:11 - application weapon App Inventor is a
00:17 - web-based integrated development
00:20 - environment originally provided by
00:23 - Google and now maintained by the
00:25 - Massachusetts Institution of Technology
00:28 - and now maintained by the Massachusetts
00:32 - Institute of Technology MIT it uses a
00:37 - graphic user interface very similar to
00:40 - scratch which is another programming
00:43 - language designed for kids or any
00:46 - beginners who want to learn to code also
00:48 - maintained by MIT in creating App
00:54 - Inventor Google uses a lot of previous
00:58 - research in educational computing and
01:02 - work done within Google on online
01:05 - development environments App Inventor
01:09 - was first released in 2010 and it was
01:13 - developed by Google MIT Media Lab and
01:17 - MIT computer science and artificial
01:20 - intelligence lab App Inventor is written
01:26 - in Java
01:27 - Kawa and scheme and the operating system
01:32 - is currently in Android and the iOS
01:35 - version is currently in beta testing a
01:41 - lot of people have been using App
01:43 - Inventor as of February 2020 there are
01:48 - 200 there were 200 86,000 weekly active
01:53 - users and 10 million registered users in
01:58 - 195 countries and in total these users
02:04 - have created over 43 million Android
02:07 - apps so now we're on the App Inventor
02:10 - homepage
02:12 - and let's walk through what the App
02:14 - Inventor homepage is so once you land on
02:18 - the App Inventor homepage you will be
02:21 - able to see a button with create apps
02:25 - which we will be going in to create our
02:28 - first app together and on this home page
02:32 - you will see the active users today
02:34 - active users this week registered users
02:38 - countries and apps builds you can also
02:42 - see other call to action here with the
02:44 - donate button and all that one thing
02:47 - that I want to point out that our great
02:49 - resources for people who are learning to
02:52 - make their first apps is all these
02:55 - resources that App Inventor has built
02:57 - here if you click into get started there
03:02 - are a lot of different there are a lot
03:05 - of different resources already built for
03:10 - you to learn about how to set up the
03:14 - phone or tablet for testing take a tour
03:18 - of the app adventurer environments some
03:21 - of the beginner tutorials and how to
03:23 - share your apps with other people
03:28 - there are also step-by-step tutorials
03:30 - for you to create even more apps so they
03:37 - are developed so they are divided into
03:40 - different and they're divided into
03:44 - different categories of difficulties and
03:47 - using different components which we'll
03:50 - talk about in next video so once you
03:54 - click inside for example if you want to
03:56 - create a chat app then you'll be able to
03:59 - see all the components that you will
04:01 - need to create this app and also all the
04:07 - components and the layouts that you will
04:09 - need to know in order to build this
04:14 - so I highly encourage you all to check
04:17 - out these tutorials they are very
04:20 - detailed step-by-step tutorials and very
04:24 - useful for you to gain an understanding

04:35 - are also the teach page for any
04:39 - educators that want to teach up and
04:41 - enter and they have included curriculum
04:44 - in computational thinking mobile CSP
04:48 - computer science principles mobile
04:52 - computer science principles endorsed by
04:54 - the College Board
04:58 - and there's also new developments in
05:02 - terms of artificial intelligence with
05:03 - App Inventor Internet of Things with App
05:06 - Inventor cetera etc so if you're looking

05:14 - group or after-school program with App
05:16 - Inventor highly recommend to check these

05:49 - sensor with that we're going to jump
05:52 - right in and create an account with App
05:54 - Inventor and let's get started once you
05:58 - click into the create apps function
06:02 - you'll be prompted to key in your key in
06:06 - your once you press on the create apps
06:11 - button a pop-up will appear and it will
06:14 - ask you to sign in using any of your
06:17 - Google address and I'm gonna use my own
06:21 - personal address and feel free to use
06:25 - any sort of any account could be your
06:29 - school account it could be your working
06:32 - out or just your personal account
06:34 - I myself have created many different
06:37 - apps so you will be able to see a lot of
06:39 - apps there and once you jump into App
06:44 - Inventor there will be some sort of
06:46 - pop-ups that let you know some of the
06:50 - latest released and just press continue
06:53 - for now and yeah like you'll be directed
06:56 - to your project area and the project
07:00 - area is where you see the apps that
07:02 - you've created and in order to start a
07:07 - new project you just press start new
07:09 - project so the project that we're
07:13 - creating is called balloon pop which is
07:16 - our first app
07:23 - our App Inventor doesn't like us to have
07:26 - a space on the app name so don't worry
07:31 - about you know how it looks like it's
07:34 - just the name of the project inside App
07:36 - Inventor you can always change how your
07:39 - app look like on the App Store on your
07:42 - home or on your phone's home page so
07:46 - this is merely just for you to name your
07:49 - project of their applicants room so
07:53 - there we go we have jumped into our
07:56 - first project this is the balloon app
07:59 - this is the balloon pop project and I'm
08:03 - going to walk us through the designer
08:05 - interface and the blocks interface
08:08 - before we jump right into the building
08:12 - of the app so there we go we are now
08:19 - inside our App Inventor project of
08:21 - balloon talk our first project and in
08:26 - the next separate video I'm going to
08:27 - familiarize you guys with the App
08:30 - Inventor interface first first with the
08:33 - designer interface which is where we are
08:36 - right now and then the block's interface
08:39 - which is where the coding happens so
08:43 - I'll see you in the next video
