00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to our
00:03 - channel
00:04 - here we share beginner friendly coding
00:06 - tutorials on scratch
00:07 - minecraft roblox web programming and
00:10 - many more
00:11 - today we are going to take a look at
00:13 - part 5 of our advanced rpg
00:18 - in this tutorial you will learn on how
00:20 - to make disappearing platforms
00:22 - and also how to make checkpoints in an
00:24 - easy way
00:27 - so let's get started right so i have
00:30 - opened up my roblox part with all the
00:33 - previous
00:33 - obstacles that we have made so far
00:37 - so the first obstacle i'll be creating
00:39 - in this video would be the disappearing
00:41 - platforms
00:42 - so disappearing platforms is a type of
00:45 - obstacles which you can find
00:47 - in most of games so first we are going
00:49 - to design the obstacle course
00:52 - so in this one not all parts are going
00:55 - to
00:56 - disappear kind of flashing
01:00 - so only few selected platforms would be
01:03 - flashing
01:04 - so that you'll have some time
01:07 - in order to wait till the platform is
01:10 - shown
01:10 - which you can jump on and then pass
01:13 - through it and jump on to the next
01:14 - platform
01:16 - so i'm going to place my platforms in
01:18 - this exact pattern
01:21 - so i'm going to click on pod
01:24 - get a block and
01:28 - use scale
01:36 - and i'm going to make sure that they're
01:38 - anchored
02:04 - alright so now i have designed my
02:06 - platform
02:07 - so next i'm going to select some of
02:09 - these platforms
02:11 - and rename them into be flashing so that
02:14 - i know that these platforms
02:16 - are the flashing all the disappearing
02:19 - platforms
02:20 - so i'm going to click on this one and
02:23 - [Music]
02:25 - go to wave and find explorer
02:30 - so i do have a bunch of parts
02:35 - so i'm going to rename this part is
02:42 - flashing so i'm going to repeat
02:48 - view
02:57 - so next i'm going to write a script to
03:00 - make them flash
03:03 - so i'm going to click on one part
03:06 - or flashing font and i'm going to add a
03:09 - script into it
03:14 - so i need to run or make them flash like
03:17 - show hide show hide while the game is
03:20 - running so i'm going to add a wall
03:24 - so while
03:29 - the condition is going to be true so
03:32 - while the game is running
03:35 - i'm going to make the transparency
03:49 - zero so if the transparency is zero
03:53 - so that means you can actually see your
03:55 - platform
03:56 - or the platform is visible
04:00 - next i'm going to add in a property
04:04 - which is called can't collide so i'm
04:07 - going to set that to be
04:08 - true so that when the platform is
04:10 - visible
04:11 - the player can actually jump onto the
04:13 - platform
04:15 - so script dot
04:18 - parent dot can collide
04:23 - equal to true so then i'm going to add a
04:27 - weight
04:29 - command or weight method
04:33 - so i'll show the platform for around
04:36 - two seconds and then make it disappear
04:40 - so two and then to make it
04:43 - disappear i'm going to write script
04:49 - parent the transparency
04:52 - is equal to be one so that it's totally
04:56 - invisible
04:58 - and i need to make sure that all the is
05:01 - invisible
05:02 - like sometimes the player if i didn't
05:05 - set my can collide
05:07 - property to be fall even if the
05:10 - part is not shown on the screen
05:13 - you can still stand on there so i need
05:16 - to make sure that the player falls
05:18 - through once the
05:21 - platform disappears
05:24 - it would be like oh it's magical
05:27 - although the platform is disappeared
05:28 - you can still stand on on a invisible
05:32 - platform
05:33 - so i'm going to make it karen
05:38 - calculi sorry
05:42 - can't collide to be
05:46 - false and then i'm going to add in
05:50 - a weight block and write
05:53 - two seconds so these platforms
05:57 - or these flashing platforms are going to
06:00 - be
06:00 - shown only for two seconds and they'll
06:03 - be hidden for two seconds so if you need
06:05 - to
06:05 - make them hidden for a longer time you
06:08 - can
06:08 - increase this weight loss
06:11 - so the wait time can be around
06:15 - four seconds so they're being invisible
06:19 - for a longer period but they're visible
06:21 - only for a shorter period
06:24 - so i have given two weight blocks now
06:27 - it's the same script for all flashing
06:29 - platforms so what i'm going to do is i'm
06:32 - going to copy the script
06:36 - and then find all the flashing
06:41 - parts so i'm going to
06:44 - paste into the parts that are renamed as
06:48 - flashing
06:51 - so paste into
06:54 - paste into all right
06:59 - so once i play it
07:08 - so you can always test it out and see if
07:11 - it is
07:11 - recording like the wait time is
07:14 - according to your liking if not you can
07:16 - always change it
07:18 - so here i can see my parts
07:23 - and i don't see them so i just need to
07:27 - quickly run
07:28 - and go get on to a safer platform
07:32 - again i don't have my platforms here
07:36 - i need to wait and then to run quickly
07:40 - and jump
07:44 - then again i need to wait oh
07:48 - see i didn't react quickly
07:52 - so i didn't run past in order to get
07:54 - into the safe
07:55 - or the non-flashing platform i just fell
07:58 - down
07:59 - luckily i had a bass play but in the end
08:02 - we're going to delete this bass play
08:05 - alright so it works now right
08:12 - lastly i'm going to add my final spawn
08:15 - point
08:17 - so i'll just paste it
08:25 - and put it down here
08:28 - all right so the final instructions
08:32 - i'll be giving in this video would be on
08:34 - how to make spawn points
08:36 - for working sponsors so there are two
08:39 - ways
08:39 - one is that you can actually code using
08:42 - lua
08:43 - and make your checkpoints to work
08:46 - but there's another way that we can use
08:48 - which is simple and easy
08:51 - we're just going to be using teams
08:54 - all right so what i'm going to do is i'm
08:56 - going to
09:00 - go to my spawn point starts from here
09:04 - and i'm going to rename all the spawn
09:07 - points in an
09:08 - order so this is going to be spawn point
09:15 - so i'm going to rename it as stage 0.
09:23 - and i'm going to rename this as
09:28 - h1 i'm going to keep
09:31 - renaming them
09:36 - so you can um rename it any way that you
09:40 - like
09:40 - you can write stage 1 s0
09:44 - 0 2.1 2.2
09:53 - all right so i have renamed my stages
09:56 - in an order so starting from stage 0
09:59 - which is at the beginning
10:01 - and the end is going to be stage nine
10:04 - now i'm going to add in the team service
10:07 - so to find teams you can click on moral
10:12 - tab on the roblox studio and you'll see
10:15 - on the right corner you'll see a tab
10:18 - called
10:19 - service if you cannot find this you can
10:21 - just
10:22 - find a tool which has
10:25 - two gears i'm going to click on that
10:30 - and i'm going to add the team service
10:34 - and click on down all right so at the
10:37 - bottom
10:37 - i do have the teams option for the
10:40 - service
10:42 - all right so next i'm going to click on
10:45 - stage 1
10:46 - and i'm going to change some properties
10:50 - so on the stage 0 which is the beginning
10:54 - i'm going to the properties of it and
10:57 - and i'm going to make sure that the
10:59 - neutral is
11:00 - unticked all right and then i'm going to
11:04 - add a team color
11:05 - so each checkpoint would have its own
11:08 - theme color
11:09 - so i'm going to make it to be
11:13 - red so in order
11:16 - for you to not to get confused of like
11:19 - what is
11:20 - which team color which is which so you
11:22 - can always
11:24 - change the color of your platform also
11:27 - so you can change the theme brick color
11:32 - really so changing the brick color to
11:35 - match with your team color would make
11:37 - things easier for you if not you can
11:41 - always just change
11:42 - the team color only all right so next
11:45 - i'm going to stage one which is the next
11:47 - stage here
11:50 - so i'm going to
11:54 - change the properties so i'm going to
11:58 - untick the neutral so make sure that all
12:00 - the checkpoints have the neutral
12:02 - property to be unticked
12:04 - but except stage
12:07 - 0 all other checkpoints should have
12:11 - the unlocking change property to be
12:13 - ticked
12:15 - so in c0 is unticked
12:19 - but in stage one stick so i'm going to
12:21 - give a different
12:23 - theme color so it's going to be lime
12:25 - green
12:27 - so i'm going to change the color also
12:29 - going to be like gray
12:34 - all right so i'm going to repeat the
12:36 - same thing
12:37 - so stage one so
12:40 - i'm gonna just go to the next stage so
12:43 - again change the properties
12:51 - click on allow team change and untick
12:54 - the neutral
12:57 - change the theme color
13:04 - and then match them i'm going to repeat
13:07 - the same thing for all other stages
13:25 - all right now head to the team
13:29 - folder down here and then we're going to
13:32 - add
13:33 - teams inside this so in total i have
13:38 - eight two points of eight
13:42 - points so i'm going to add eight teams
13:46 - so i'm going to click on the plus sign
13:48 - and add one team
14:06 - all right so now i'm going to rename
14:08 - this part exactly the way that i have
14:10 - renamed these
14:12 - spawn points so starting from
14:15 - stage 0 all the way to stage 8.
14:19 - so i'm going to rename so i'll do it one
14:23 - by one so
14:24 - i'm going to do the first checkpoint
14:28 - which is stage
14:29 - 0. so i'll rename this
14:35 - to be stage 0
14:38 - and i'm going to change some properties
14:40 - of this thing so
14:43 - now if i take a look at the properties
14:46 - of
14:49 - stage 0 the team color
14:53 - is really red
14:56 - so i'm going to click on stage 0
15:01 - and change the team color to match with
15:03 - the theme call that i have assigned
15:06 - for my spawn points so stage 0
15:09 - is going to be
15:15 - y so stage 0 is going to be
15:19 - really red ok so the next
15:23 - theme would be
15:28 - stage one so
15:32 - for stage one
15:38 - the team color i have assigned is
15:42 - lime green so
15:47 - for stage one i'm going to make sure the
15:49 - lime green
15:51 - the theme color is lamb green and
15:54 - starting from stage one i'm going to
15:57 - make sure that the auto
15:59 - assignable property is going to be
16:01 - unticked
16:02 - so that when you fall down they don't
16:05 - get
16:06 - randomly assigned to another spawn point
16:11 - but stage one should be utter asana
16:17 - because it's the first spawn point
16:20 - so i'm going to keep on repeating so
16:22 - stage 2.
16:55 - all right and finally i'm going to
16:59 - delete the base plate
17:06 - there you go
17:12 - and now we can see how the checkpoints
17:14 - are being updated
17:16 - so head to play
17:21 - all right so here i can see all the
17:24 - stages
17:24 - shown on my screen so right now i'm on
17:28 - stage one
17:29 - so i'll just jump
17:42 - now i'm stage two
17:47 - and then
17:53 - not if i
17:56 - respawn so let's see if i jump down
18:01 - just for testing
18:04 - right now i'm stage one i have passed h1
18:08 - so let's see okay so
18:11 - i'll get spawn to my last
18:14 - known checkpoint which is stage one
18:20 - so that's all for today i hope you like
