00:00 - hello everyone so today in our tutorial
00:02 - we're going to be making a potion in
00:04 - m creator and this potion will be a
00:06 - chinese new year potion
00:08 - what that means is we will add two
00:10 - portion superpowers
00:12 - to our portion and it will activate when
00:15 - it's applied
00:16 - and the next thing would be that we'd
00:17 - add a picture that is related to chinese
00:20 - new year
00:21 - for the icon of our potion
00:24 - we're going to begin making our potion
00:26 - in minecraft
00:28 - first please make sure you open m
00:30 - creator and to start
00:32 - we can click on this plus over here and
00:35 - then
00:35 - after you click the plus as you move
00:38 - we will see the potion option and you
00:41 - click on that
00:42 - and then here it asks you to enter a
00:44 - name for the portion
00:46 - here we can just call this c and y
00:50 - potion and then click on create new
00:53 - potions
00:54 - so as we've already added the name next
00:57 - we need to pick a color
00:59 - so click on this three dots and choose a
01:02 - color
01:03 - this is chinese new year you can find a
01:05 - color that is
01:06 - sort of reddish so i might pick
01:10 - this one over here little
01:14 - lightest darkest red and then here we
01:17 - have potion icon
01:18 - now with the potion icon this means what
01:21 - will
01:21 - your potions picture look like so you
01:24 - can click on this plus
01:26 - and here if you have an image already
01:28 - saved on your computer
01:29 - you can save it so i have this of a aux
01:34 - so i'll click on open and then here
01:38 - since it's already existing in my
01:39 - computer i can click on cancel and just
01:42 - click on here
01:43 - and click on this if it's not there
01:46 - you can click on plus and then add in
01:49 - the
01:49 - image and then click open so remember
01:52 - your image should be a dot
01:54 - png file something as in jpg
01:58 - or jpeg would not work so make sure that
02:01 - the file extension is dot
02:03 - png after that's done here
02:08 - then all of these options you can leave
02:11 - it alone for now
02:12 - then we can click on triggers once you
02:16 - click on triggers
02:16 - is where you can run a procedure under a
02:19 - certain
02:20 - circumstance so these circumstances over
02:24 - are over here and if
02:27 - we're not going to be using this for now
02:29 - click on save
02:31 - once that's done we can move on to
02:33 - making the procedures
02:35 - so we can click on plus and then we can
02:38 - move all the way here and click on
02:40 - procedure
02:41 - and then you can call this c and y
02:45 - position or you can just call this c n
02:48 - y and click create new procedure
02:52 - so as we're here this is where we do the
02:55 - coding part of our project
02:58 - so click on entity management and as you
03:01 - scroll down
03:03 - you will see this block add potion with
03:05 - level one
03:06 - four sixty ticks to event and type
03:09 - so you can drag this out and then just
03:12 - with your keyboard you can press command
03:13 - or control c
03:15 - and then duplicate it by pressing ctrl
03:18 - or command
03:18 - v once that's done we can look at our
03:22 - code and see how we can modify
03:24 - so here it says apply with level one for
03:27 - 60 ticks
03:28 - to entity so this entity is
03:32 - us as in our character
03:35 - and 60 ticks is a very short while in
03:37 - minecraft
03:39 - so to increase the potion effect for a
03:41 - longer time we'd have to change these
03:43 - sticks
03:44 - so you can change this to
03:47 - this amount and we can change this here
03:50 - to
03:52 - this amount too so what happens
03:55 - is effectively we're trying to make this
03:58 - potion
03:58 - effect lasts almost forever and then
04:01 - here we have type
04:02 - so in type is where you can choose your
04:05 - portion effect
04:06 - so i am going to add in regeneration
04:10 - that would mean it would regenerate my
04:12 - health and the type
04:14 - i would change this to water breathing
04:17 - so this will help me to breathe
04:18 - underwater
04:20 - so once these two things are there we
04:22 - can click on
04:23 - save mod element once that's done
04:26 - we have our potion and we have our
04:29 - procedure
04:30 - we go back to our potion and click back
04:33 - on triggers
04:34 - so here under these situations we can
04:37 - run a procedure
04:38 - so as we made a procedure just now
04:40 - called cny
04:42 - what we can do is when the potion is
04:45 - started slash applied so in this
04:47 - situation
04:48 - we want to apply our effects from our
04:51 - portion
04:52 - so click on cny then click on save mod
04:55 - element
04:56 - so you can click back once again just to
04:59 - check and make sure
05:00 - that it's there then we click on save
05:04 - after that's done we can click on
05:07 - the play option here
05:11 - and we can head to our console and wait
05:14 - for it to load
05:35 - his minecraft is loaded now we can move
05:38 - our mouse
05:39 - click on single player and then
05:42 - here we can delete this
05:45 - then we can create a new world make sure
05:48 - you change it to create it
05:49 - click create
06:12 - now that our world has loaded we can
06:15 - explore
06:16 - and the first thing we can do is we can
06:19 - click on
06:20 - e so once you click on e you can click
06:23 - on
06:23 - search items you can type in cny so
06:26 - notice our portion is over here
06:29 - just drag it here and press escape so we
06:32 - have this potion
06:35 - and as we're in creative our health is
06:37 - full
06:38 - and we're able to survive under the
06:40 - water as long as we want
06:42 - so to test this out properly click on t
06:46 - put a slash type in game mode
06:49 - and then survive
06:52 - [Music]
06:55 - so here what we have is our health bar
06:58 - and we have our hunger bar
07:02 - in order to apply this potion click on
07:04 - right click
07:05 - and then consume this potion so you can
07:08 - now see on the screen there
07:10 - is the aux design from our
07:13 - image that we uploaded and then we have
07:16 - the
07:16 - health and water breathing potion
07:20 - activated so now we can actually test
07:22 - this out by heading to the
07:25 - water so let's do that
07:30 - let's find some area with water and
07:33 - apply it
07:34 - and see how this works so what's
07:36 - supposed to happen
07:37 - is that you should be able to breathe
07:39 - underwater as long as you want
07:41 - you should not reduce in health
07:44 - or ability to breathe so let's test this
07:47 - out
07:49 - let's go and you will see right now that
07:52 - i'm underwater
07:53 - but my health is not decreasing neither
07:56 - is the water bottle
07:58 - so it allows me to effectively go under
08:00 - water
08:02 - and stay for as long as i want and
08:05 - not lose any help with this so
08:08 - if i press on the e you can see that i
08:11 - have my cn1 position
08:13 - i have this water breathing effect and i
08:15 - have regeneration
08:18 - go back and as you there you go
08:21 - we have applied our potion
