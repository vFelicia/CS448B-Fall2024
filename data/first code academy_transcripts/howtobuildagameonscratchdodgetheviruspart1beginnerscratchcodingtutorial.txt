00:00 - all right so you guys should be able to
00:02 - see my screen now and so this project
00:06 - I'm gonna press the green flag and so
00:10 - this project is about this monkey that
00:12 - is basically dodging away from this
00:15 - virus and eating more orange juice as
00:17 - the vitamin C so every time that we are
00:22 - eating the we eat the orange our score
00:27 - goes up and then every time the virus
00:30 - hits us the score goes down so we are
00:35 - going to create this project together
00:38 - and so go ahead and log into your
00:42 - scratch.mit.edu and we can get started
00:51 - cool so without further ado let's get it
00:56 - started I want to name this game first
00:58 - so maybe eat the vitamin huh so I'm
01:06 - gonna call this project eat the vitamin
01:08 - and what I'm gonna do first and foremost
01:12 - is as you remember we have a backdrop of
01:15 - a colorful image so let me just click on
01:19 - here this is the backdrop area and I'm
01:22 - gonna press this button which will
01:27 - directly point me to choose the backdrop
01:34 - I'm gonna choose the blue sky just
01:37 - because you know just makes everything
01:39 - brighter and because we are not using
01:43 - the scratch cat right now for this
01:46 - tutorial I'm going to remove it and
01:49 - press the sprite here and as you recall
01:54 - the game is about this monkey that is
01:57 - dodging the virus and eating more
01:59 - vitamins which is an orange so I am
02:03 - going to look for it can really be
02:11 - anything but I'm going to use the
02:13 - the monkey right now here and probably
02:17 - need to make it a little bit smaller so
02:19 - I'll change it to 660 is pretty good and
02:27 - what else do I need
02:29 - so I actually downloaded two files one
02:32 - is the Ebola virus and one is the orange
02:35 - that I want the monkey to eat so both
02:38 - are incredibly big right now so we don't
02:41 - need such a big brothers on the screen
02:43 - and we're going to make it smaller and
02:48 - also drag the virus to the side of the
02:52 - screen so it starts moving from there
02:54 - and then also change the orange to maybe
02:57 - 30 so also start from here awesome okay
03:06 - so now we have our high P thanks for
03:10 - joining hi picky thanks for joining
03:13 - so any questions so far are you guys
03:15 - following through the video cool cool
03:21 - all right so I am going to move on and
03:27 - start coding all these movements so one
03:33 - of the things that you might remember is
03:35 - that the game actually has a score so
03:38 - whenever we start the game we want to
03:42 - start the score all right so I am gonna
03:47 - start with actually I'm gonna delete
03:52 - this first all right I'm gonna start
03:54 - with the monkey so I want to start the
03:57 - game with basically just a score of zero
04:02 - so what I need to do is to go inside the
04:05 - variable and set the variable calling it
04:14 - score you can start the score in any
04:18 - number as well like some people might
04:20 - want to start with a hundred or you know
04:22 - easier we can start with zero and
04:25 - [Music]
04:27 - so we want to put the score somewhere so
04:31 - we're going to put a motion there so we
04:35 - will ask every time we click the start
04:38 - of green flag we will be asking scratch
04:42 - to place the score onto the top-left
04:46 - corner so the next thing that we're
04:50 - gonna so pay attention here that I am
04:52 - choosing the monkey so because we are
04:56 - essentially coding up the motions for
04:59 - the monkey what we're gonna do is to is
05:02 - to program the monkey such that when we
05:06 - press the up arrow we will have the
05:10 - monkey go up which means we're changing
05:15 - the y-coordinates of the monkey by a
05:19 - certain amount so scratch has already
05:24 - set us up for a default number so we can
05:29 - just keep it like that and let's check
05:31 - it out whether it works so I'm pressing
05:33 - the up caret up arrow key and you can
05:37 - see okay I'm keep moving but the monkey
05:39 - is moving out so it works what I'm gonna
05:48 - do next is to simply right click and
05:50 - duplicate my monkey such that sorry
05:55 - duplicate the code not duplicating the
05:58 - monkey
05:58 - so duplicating these two code such that
06:01 - I am going to just change the up arrow
06:05 - to this drop-down menu and choose down
06:08 - arrow and what I'm gonna do is to
06:14 - instead of adding my y-axis I'm going to
06:18 - reduce my y-axis so basically I am
06:23 - making it a negative and I'm gonna
06:26 - quickly test it out my down arrow great
06:33 - so now we're going we're able to move up
06:36 - and down the monkey which is really what
06:39 - we need in terms
06:41 - of the monkeys movements and one of the
06:48 - things that I one other thing I want to
06:51 - share with you all when coding up these
06:53 - projects is also to test out your code
06:57 - often what I mean here is that we always
07:01 - want to make sure that our code is
07:03 - working so what I did just now was
07:05 - whenever I finished one section of a
07:09 - code I would just press test out my code
07:13 - by pressing the up arrow in this case or
07:15 - the down arrow in this case such that is
07:18 - to confirm to ourselves that our code is
07:22 - working the way we want okay so next as
07:29 - you remember so this code this project
07:33 - basically involves two sprites moving to
07:38 - us the monkey and the monkey needs to
07:40 - dodge the virus and eat the orange how
07:44 - it works here is let's program the virus
07:50 - first all right so when we program the
07:53 - virus what it means is that we need to
07:55 - make the virus keep moving from the left
07:59 - side of the screen to the right side of
08:00 - the screen and after they hit the right
08:04 - side of the border it will go back to
08:07 - the left side and move down or up the
08:11 - screen and do it all over again so it
08:16 - sounds really complicated but trust me
08:18 - we can pretty much handle it very well
08:23 - and pretty much handle it
08:25 - just in a few pieces of code that's the
08:28 - power of scratch so what we can do is to
08:31 - first drag out the offense block and
08:35 - when green flag clicked block so this is
08:39 - an offense block that we use and the
08:44 - next thing that we will use is a forever
08:47 - book so forever block is this crack
08:53 - representation
08:54 - of a while loop if you guys are familiar
08:57 - with computer science but it's not it
09:00 - just means that it will repeat an action
09:02 - forever so it's very intuitive that way
09:06 - and what we will do next is to get the
09:14 - get get the blog for go to so this is
09:21 - asking the virus to start off at a set
09:26 - place so right now scratch already gave
09:29 - us this number so I think we can just
09:31 - keep it that way where we want the virus
09:33 - to start off on the left hand side of
09:36 - the screen so the y-axis is a little bit
09:40 - tricky so the y-axis we want to change
09:45 - it to a random number what it means here
09:53 - is that we every time the virus come
09:58 - back we want the we want the virus to go
10:02 - to a different y-coordinate so we would
10:06 - want to change it to minus 120 to
10:09 - positive 120 so the middle part of the
10:13 - screen is zero and zero coordinates and
10:18 - what it means is that we want our Y
10:21 - coordinates to be either to the top of
10:24 - the screen or the bottom of the screen
10:26 - like anywhere in between next we are
10:29 - going to program the repeat block the
10:35 - repeat until block here essentially
10:37 - means that we want this action to repeat
10:40 - until a certain event happens so what we
10:44 - will do is to have a an operator so we
10:51 - essentially want the virus to keep
10:54 - moving until it either hits an edge
10:57 - which is in this case the right hand
10:59 - side of the border or the monkey right
11:03 - what we will want to do is now go into
11:05 - the sensing
11:07 - first part is when it touched the edge
11:11 - the other sensing off that we need to
11:14 - use is when it touched a monkey cool all
11:21 - right so the next part that we're going
11:24 - to do is that when this happened what do
11:26 - we want scratch to do we actually want
11:31 - we want to keep changing the x-axis
11:35 - until the virus hit the edge of the
11:40 - screen or hit the monkey so what do we
11:42 - want the virus to do we want it to do we
11:47 - want it to keep moving so we probably
11:49 - don't want it to move too fast it's not
11:51 - the game will be really difficult so we
11:54 - can actually change it to move maybe
11:56 - like just three every time all right so
12:00 - they were pretty happy with this code
12:04 - right now and I'm gonna change this and
12:09 - the last bit is that when we hit the
12:12 - monkey we want the score to changed
12:15 - right so okay so what we want to do is
12:20 - to actually make it another if statement
12:26 - so we want an if statement here what do
12:30 - we want to do when the when the virus
12:33 - hits a monkey we want to change to score
12:39 - by minus 1 right
12:48 - okay cool
12:58 - all right so now this is almost halfway
13:01 - there
13:01 - like our our game is already functioning
13:04 - halfway and what we need to do next is
13:07 - to also program the orange to move such
13:10 - that we can reward the monkey whenever
13:13 - we hit the whenever he hit the orange
13:18 - there is actually a very fast way to
13:22 - program this part which is to click
13:26 - right click duplicates and what you can
13:30 - see is that okay now we are duplicated
13:32 - and I'm just going to drag this and drag
13:36 - this block of code onto the orange okay
13:47 - I'm gonna do that again
13:58 - okay all right I am successfully did
14:03 - that but it didn't actually do the whole
14:08 - thing but that is okay because I can
14:11 - just use this it's just missing a few
14:15 - pieces so it's missing the forever block
14:19 - and click flag click green flag block
14:23 - and what I'm gonna do is that well at
14:28 - this time we are moving so okay okay
14:46 - okay all right so it's just not
14:49 - registering for the for a moment and now
14:52 - it's moving and you can see that our
14:55 - score it is declining and the reason is
14:58 - that even if we are eating the orange is
15:01 - still deducting hours for which is not
15:04 - what we want so maybe we can make this
15:06 - game more friendly such that it will
15:09 - increase our score by 5 and every time
15:13 - we eat the orange
15:14 - okay so we're able to regain our health
15:17 - pretty quickly all right so I think this
15:23 - game is actually working pretty well now
15:25 - so what I will do is to further actually
15:28 - slow down my the virus and I'll click
15:34 - here and changing this number 3 to 2 and
15:39 - basically you can see that now the
15:41 - monkey is able to catch the catch the
15:46 - orange pretty effectively and dodge away
15:48 - from the virus and I'm gonna show this
15:51 - in full screen I'll actually refresh the
15:55 - game
16:04 - let's see if our game actually works so
16:07 - our game have to score starting from
16:10 - zero and okay
16:15 - seems like our monkey the orange coat is
16:19 - not updated so I am going to go inside
16:22 - and change this and also change back my
16:31 - virus to two so so that oh okay that's
16:37 - why because if there is actually two
16:39 - code here all right so I am going to
16:42 - change just click into both blocks of
16:46 - code to make sure it's working the way I
16:48 - want to and yes so I am able to see my
16:56 - score go up here by five each time I eat
17:00 - the orange and also see my score go down
17:05 - each time I got hit by the virus by one
17:10 - and I'm gonna stop the game here and one
17:14 - thing that I want to mention just now
17:15 - that I forgot to do that's why the score
17:19 - is not showing up is because I need to
17:22 - always check this box here where
17:25 - whenever I define a variable scratch
17:29 - actually give us the option whether to
17:31 - show it on the screen which in this case
17:34 - we do want to and that's why when I was
17:39 - coding up the game and pressing the
17:41 - green flag it was not showing up in the
17:44 - beginning because I didn't like this
17:46 - score checkbox and so if every time you
17:51 - want the score to show up on the box
17:53 - you always want to you always want to
17:57 - click this box and it will show up on
18:00 - the screen so yeah there we go we have
18:07 - successfully created this game that is a
18:10 - remix
18:11 - eat the banana it is the story of this
18:14 - monkey eating up more vitamins and
18:18 - dodging up the virus and so yeah feel
18:22 - free to follow along this tutorial when
18:25 - you have time and leave a comment down
18:27 - below let me know how it goes
18:29 - for you or any sort of adjustments that
18:33 - you have created with this game and I
18:35 - can't wait to see your products see you
18:37 - next time
