00:00 - everyone so welcome to first code
00:02 - academy my name is sid
00:04 - so today we're going to look at how
00:05 - we're going to make a new year's
00:07 - resolution list for the year of 2020
00:10 - with the use of
00:11 - html css and js and this is all tied
00:14 - into
00:15 - web programming so the three things
00:18 - we'll learn today
00:19 - is a bit of html a bit of css and some
00:22 - js
00:23 - and we'll learn how to make a ordered
00:25 - list in html
00:28 - so we're going to have a look at our
00:30 - project and then
00:31 - we're going to begin with it this is our
00:33 - project
00:34 - and this is what it looks like i've
00:36 - added some javascript
00:38 - and at the start it's asked me what is
00:41 - your name so i'm going to click on this
00:44 - and i'm going to type in my name
00:48 - once i've done that i'm going to click
00:49 - on ok
00:51 - so with the use of javascript once again
00:53 - it says welcome to my new year's
00:55 - resolution website and then it says my
00:57 - name
00:58 - then i click on ok and what i have here
01:02 - is my new year's resolution website for
01:04 - the year of 2021.
01:06 - i've added a header then i've added a
01:09 - smaller header here and what i've done
01:12 - here
01:12 - is i've added a list now there are
01:16 - ordered and
01:16 - unordered lists and for this exercise
01:19 - we're going to use a ordered list
01:21 - and the difference is that there is
01:23 - numberings on the side of each item
01:25 - in this list at the end i've added a
01:28 - image
01:29 - which is technically a gif and on the
01:31 - side i've added
01:33 - a border with some style and to top it
01:36 - off
01:37 - i've given it a background color and
01:39 - i've also added custom font which
01:41 - we will learn how to use from google
01:45 - so now let's begin our project to start
01:47 - please head to codepen
01:49 - and log into your account and to start
01:52 - we're going to click on pen over here
01:56 - so we're gonna type in our project name
01:58 - here we're gonna type in 2021
02:02 - new year's
02:06 - resolutions
02:09 - and here we have the html we have the
02:11 - css and the js
02:13 - now the html is the text part of the web
02:17 - page css is
02:18 - where you want to add some coloring some
02:21 - styling
02:22 - and js is where you bring the web page
02:24 - to life to begin our project
02:26 - we will start by entering the html tags
02:31 - so this and type in our ending tags
02:36 - so remember there's always a starting
02:37 - and ending tag
02:39 - next we want to add in a body tag this
02:42 - is where the chunk of our content is
02:44 - going to be
02:46 - and this is where you want to place
02:48 - everything inside the body
02:50 - part of your page that's in the middle
02:53 - and then we want to add in
02:56 - a header to add in a header we use a
02:59 - h tag so you can use a h1
03:04 - you can type in my new year's
03:08 - resolutions
03:12 - and then you add in your closing h1 tag
03:15 - and then you have a header now on your
03:16 - page
03:17 - next we can add in a paragraph
03:21 - just saying that for the year of
03:25 - 2021 these
03:28 - are the resolutions that i
03:40 - so we've added a starting paragraph tag
03:43 - and an ending paragraph tag and then
03:44 - added the content inside there
03:46 - so we've added so far a header and a
03:49 - paragraph
03:50 - next we want to add in a list now in
03:53 - html there are two ways of adding lists
03:55 - you can use a ol tag that is for a
03:58 - ordered list
03:58 - where each list item will have a number
04:01 - or you can use
04:02 - a ul that's an unordered list where the
04:05 - each item
04:06 - doesn't have a number you'll just see a
04:08 - bullet point but as we're making new
04:10 - year's resolutions for the new year
04:12 - we want to put our resolutions as a
04:15 - priority so we want to list
04:17 - them in the list with a number so to
04:20 - begin
04:21 - we'll start by adding the ol tag
04:26 - so this is the ordered list tag but
04:30 - once you have this tag and you type in
04:32 - something say i type in hello
04:35 - world you'll notice that
04:38 - it's just comes printed out and then if
04:40 - i type in
04:41 - hello mars
04:46 - it just is printed out next to it but if
04:49 - we want to add in
04:50 - items we actually need to add in another
04:53 - tag
04:54 - so i'm going to show you what this tag
04:55 - is this tag is called a li
04:59 - in other words you can call this a list
05:01 - item and this is when we want to enter a
05:03 - item
05:04 - inside our list so for the first one i'm
05:07 - going to say
05:09 - eat more fruits that will be my first
05:12 - item
05:14 - in my list of my resolutions the second
05:17 - thing i want to write is
05:21 - exercise daily
05:28 - all right oops mater
05:34 - spelling mistake
05:38 - next i put another li tag so we've
05:40 - already added two
05:41 - items in our resolution we're gonna add
05:44 - in the third one so the third one will
05:45 - be
05:46 - learn python for me
05:50 - so i hope you guys are writing in your
05:52 - resolutions i'm curious to see what you
05:54 - guys would like to achieve for the year
05:56 - of 2021
05:57 - and then i want to add in a fourth item
05:59 - to my list so
06:01 - i put in another li tag so the html
06:04 - understands that whenever you put an
06:05 - ally tag inside your ordered list
06:07 - it knows that this is the next item
06:09 - that's needed and it will add the
06:10 - appropriate number to this list
06:12 - so now i'm going to write in learn
06:16 - web development and then i can add in
06:21 - another item here and i can say
06:28 - play more basketball
06:34 - there so i've added
06:38 - five items to my list using the li tag
06:41 - and all inside a ordered list
06:45 - to end this i would like to add an image
06:48 - of
06:48 - 2021 and to do that i add in a
06:52 - image source tag so we will do this
06:54 - after the
06:55 - ending tag of ordered list as we don't
06:57 - want it to become
07:00 - we don't want it to be shoved together
07:03 - so image source
07:06 - equal sign this and then just add in
07:09 - this tag
07:10 - so there's no need to put a closing
07:12 - image tag we just close it by using this
07:16 - next we can just head to google images
07:19 - here
07:20 - and we can type in 2021 and then if you
07:23 - want an image you can use an image if
07:25 - you want a gif you can use a gif
07:26 - i will be using hit then i will use
07:30 - this here and then i will right click it
07:33 - and copy the image address head back to
07:36 - here
07:36 - and paste it inside
07:40 - so once i've pasted it an image should
07:43 - load
07:44 - now this is why the css comes in handy
07:47 - now
07:47 - i don't want this image to be so big so
07:50 - what do i do
07:51 - i type in my image tag and then i give
07:54 - it a height
07:55 - of 200 pixels and a width of maybe 300
07:59 - pixels
08:01 - so it makes the image smaller and it
08:04 - changes its height
08:05 - width as i've given the property of it
08:07 - and the value
08:09 - next i'd like to add a border maybe
08:12 - i can use five pixels double
08:16 - and red so double the styling red is the
08:18 - color and you can notice the
08:20 - styling over here if i were to change
08:22 - this to maybe 15
08:24 - the styling will be a bit thicker
08:27 - but i will just leave it at five
08:31 - so that's the html part with a bit of
08:34 - css
08:36 - now on top of this say if we want to
08:38 - make this a little more colorful
08:40 - we can actually start by giving this
08:44 - a background color so to make use of the
08:47 - whole page
08:47 - and we want to select the whole page we
08:49 - can use the body tag in css
08:51 - and here we can give it a background
08:53 - color
08:56 - of say orange for now
08:59 - and you can always change this using rgb
09:03 - or hex code values and then you can give
09:05 - the font a color of
09:06 - white
09:09 - if you like or if you want red
09:12 - either way is up to you you can pick any
09:14 - color you like so i'll just
09:16 - leave it at black here and
09:20 - now say for example you want a different
09:23 - font
09:24 - so we can go here type in google fonts
09:29 - and just click on this so you can find a
09:32 - font that you like so i'm just gonna
09:35 - search
09:35 - quicksand i'll use this
09:39 - and then i will stick to this style so
09:42 - we select this style
09:44 - now to import this we click on import
09:46 - over here
09:47 - and we just copy paste this
09:50 - what this does is it imports the font
09:53 - from
09:54 - google font into our project
09:57 - so just place this here and the next
10:00 - thing is i need to just specify this
10:03 - in the css as i would like to change the
10:06 - font
10:07 - so here and you can see that my font has
10:11 - changed
10:12 - over here if you want to change the
10:15 - background color to something other than
10:16 - orange
10:17 - you can always go to the rgb
10:20 - color picker
10:24 - and here you can just move this over
10:26 - here
10:28 - and pick so say you want something like
10:31 - this you have hex values here and you
10:34 - have rgb
10:35 - values here so say i want to use
10:39 - this sort of green i can just copy
10:42 - this x value over here go back to my
10:46 - project
10:47 - and i can remove this over here just
10:50 - paste that
10:51 - and it turns green
10:54 - and you can change the color to whatever
10:56 - you like
10:58 - and then you can change the font color
11:00 - too
11:01 - that can be just changed by using color
11:05 - and then you can go back over here and
11:08 - say you would like
11:09 - a specific reddish color like this
11:12 - you could copy paste this here
11:16 - and just close it with a semicolon and
11:19 - there you have this
11:20 - reddish font
11:23 - and if you still feel the color is not
11:26 - great you can just play around with the
11:28 - colors
11:28 - say i go for light blue i'll change this
11:32 - here
11:38 - it's a bit more readable and if you
11:41 - don't like it at all you can just remove
11:43 - the color tag
11:44 - yourself here and then it'll just be set
11:47 - to black
11:49 - so we have this so far so we've added
11:53 - html and css
11:55 - now if we want to add some js we can
11:58 - just
11:58 - move this here and on codepen you can
12:02 - click on settings
12:03 - and then click on behavior then you can
12:07 - turn this off and this off for now
12:11 - as when you type in the js code it will
12:14 - automatically run it that's why
12:16 - we turn them off to have a run option to
12:18 - check our code if it works
12:20 - what we can do now is we can create a
12:22 - variable and
12:24 - call it name and then put equal and then
12:27 - we use the
12:28 - prompt keyword so prompt is used in
12:30 - javascript to ask a question
12:32 - so in a bracket and i'll ask you what is
12:35 - your
12:36 - name question mark and then end it with
12:40 - a semicolon
12:42 - the next thing i'd like to do is i'd
12:44 - like to actually greet this person
12:46 - to my new year's resolution website what
12:49 - i can do here is i can type in
12:51 - alert and
12:55 - right welcome to my
12:58 - new year's resolution
13:04 - website and then you can put a plus
13:08 - here and then you can add this
13:13 - another plus and then here you can type
13:17 - in the
13:17 - variable name
13:22 - and then you can save your project so
13:24 - what we have done
13:25 - here is we've created a variable called
13:27 - name and prompt
13:29 - is used to ask a question so it asks
13:31 - what is your name so it asks what's your
13:34 - name
13:36 - and then that information is stored
13:38 - inside name
13:39 - so when alert is used to give you a
13:41 - pop-up it'll say welcome to my new
13:43 - year's resolution website
13:45 - then i've added this here to give it a
13:46 - space and then it'll say our name
13:48 - so let's try it on let's click on run
13:55 - so it says what is your name i'm going
13:57 - to type in slurp
13:59 - so welcome back to my new year's
14:00 - resolution website siddharth
14:04 - so that's how the javascript works
14:07 - so congratulations you've made your new
14:09 - year's resolution website with the use
14:11 - of html css
14:13 - and javascript thank you for watching i
