00:00 - hello everybody welcome back to our
00:02 - channel
00:04 - here we share beginner-friendly coding
00:06 - tutorials on scratch
00:08 - roblox minecraft web programming and
00:11 - many more
00:12 - today we're going to create a web
00:14 - programming project
00:15 - called rotating earth globe so in this
00:18 - project
00:19 - we will use html to design the structure
00:22 - of the website
00:24 - and css to color design shape
00:27 - and do the animations for this website
00:29 - so let's get started
00:31 - so in this project i'll be using codepen
00:34 - to make this project so in a new kind of
00:37 - codepen
00:38 - i'm gonna go to the html section and
00:41 - start writing our html code
00:44 - so let's first declare our html tag so
00:46 - we write html
00:49 - in here we want to define our body of
00:51 - the html
00:52 - so let's open up the body tag
00:55 - first we want to add a header so do that
00:58 - let's add an h1 tag which stands for the
01:01 - header 1 tag
01:03 - in here we can write rotating globe
01:06 - and now we want to close our header 1
01:09 - tag
01:10 - so it will display rotating globe
01:14 - underneath the headers we want to add a
01:16 - div
01:17 - and we also want to give the div and id
01:19 - of
01:20 - earth and we can have nothing in the div
01:24 - so we can just leave it empty like so
01:27 - close up the div and now let's close out
01:30 - body so we close up body
01:32 - and then finally close the html tag
01:36 - and this will conclude the html portion
01:38 - of this project
01:40 - so now let's move on to our css
01:43 - so in the css part what we're trying to
01:46 - do
01:46 - is to change the css of our div called
01:50 - earth
01:50 - and have it have a picture of the globe
01:54 - and have an animation that rotates the
01:56 - globe
01:57 - so here let's change the css of this div
02:00 - so we can refer to this div by calling
02:02 - the id
02:03 - and here we named it earth so we're
02:06 - going to
02:07 - put hash hash birth in here and here
02:10 - let's change the position to relative
02:13 - so let's set the position the relative
02:17 - this would be relevance for our page and
02:19 - let's set the height
02:20 - and width of our div to 300 pixels
02:24 - so let's change the height assign it to
02:28 - 300 pixels
02:30 - and the width which will also set 300
02:33 - pixels
02:35 - now let's add some margins so here i'm
02:38 - going to write margin
02:39 - and the first value i'm going to put is
02:41 - 0.05 em
02:44 - and then the second value i'm gonna
02:45 - write auto
02:47 - so the first value will apply to the top
02:50 - and the right margin of the page and the
02:53 - second value will be applied to the left
02:55 - and bottom margin of the page so here we
02:58 - have 0.05
03:00 - em margin for top and right and an auto
03:03 - margin
03:04 - for left and bottom now let's add our
03:08 - background pictures
03:09 - so let's go to background here i'm gonna
03:12 - write
03:13 - hashtag 888 followed by
03:17 - a url inside of this bracket
03:21 - um i want to put the url
03:24 - of the pictures i'm going to be using so
03:28 - you can go to google and find
03:29 - the image address and paste it into
03:33 - here and as you can see we have found
03:36 - the picture and inserted it into our
03:38 - website
03:39 - now we can have two more parameters for
03:41 - sure zero
03:43 - zero and lastly we're going to write
03:45 - repeat
03:50 - so the statement for background should
03:52 - look something like this
03:54 - hashtag 888 followed by url
03:58 - and link to their picture
04:01 - zero zero and repeat
04:05 - the picture right now is a square
04:07 - however so let's try to make this into a
04:12 - circle
04:26 - um
04:35 - and lastly let's define the animations
04:38 - so here we can either do animation from
04:40 - javascript or animation from
04:43 - css in today's project we'll be using
04:46 - animation of css so here let's type in
04:49 - animation and
04:53 - here we'll write in the animation name
04:55 - here we write rotate
04:57 - and then followed by 4 seconds or
05:00 - 4s and then we write linear
05:05 - and then followed by infinite
05:09 - so this command animation it takes in
05:12 - four inputs so the first input is the
05:15 - name of the animation
05:16 - we haven't yet defined what rotate is
05:19 - but this will be the animation that
05:20 - we'll define later
05:22 - that tells the css what the actual
05:24 - animation is
05:26 - um four seconds the durations which
05:28 - takes four seconds to do the whole and
05:30 - rotate animation is linear so that
05:34 - the animation does not speed up in any
05:36 - way and is linear in speed
05:38 - and it's infinite is the loop so it will
05:41 - loop forever
05:43 - next let's use transition to make our
05:46 - animation smoother
05:48 - typing transition
05:52 - and inside transition let's write
05:54 - transform
05:57 - 200 milliseconds and linear again
06:03 - and here we should define what transform
06:05 - is so we're going to write transform
06:09 - dash style and decide we're going to be
06:11 - using
06:13 - first serve 3d dash 3d like so
06:20 - and we're going to also add a box shadow
06:22 - around our square so
06:24 - um here we're going to write box shadow
06:29 - here we're going to have an inset so
06:30 - it's inside
06:32 - we have a 200 pixel uh 20 pixels
06:36 - so insets 20 pixels
06:39 - followed by zero pixels followed by 80
06:42 - pixels
06:44 - followed by six pixels and then give it
06:48 - a color of black so
06:50 - rgb of zero zero and zero
06:56 - and so so what we have here for the box
06:59 - shadow
07:00 - is that we have gave it the inside of
07:02 - zero
07:03 - followed by an offset of x offset of y
07:08 - the blur radius and the spread radius
07:11 - and then followed by the color so we
07:13 - have just
07:14 - um set all of them up in here
07:18 - and lastly we want to change the color
07:19 - of the background for this diff and
07:21 - let's change the color
07:23 - and just give it a hash zero zero zero
07:29 - now that we've finished the css for our
07:31 - div let's
07:32 - define the animation
07:36 - so as you can see here in the animation
07:38 - we have named
07:40 - our animation to be rotate and to deploy
07:43 - our own
07:44 - animation in css we use the keyword
07:48 - keyframes or at keyframes
07:52 - like this and now we can declare
07:55 - our animation which we have said to be
07:59 - rotate
08:02 - so in keyframes it takes in a couple of
08:06 - um animation so it takes in the
08:08 - beginning stage
08:09 - so the start here we can simply uh
08:12 - denote that at zero percent
08:14 - stands for zero percent of the animation
08:16 - so
08:18 - now before the animation is started this
08:19 - is um what is happening
08:22 - here we're going to change the
08:23 - background
08:25 - dash position to be zero
08:28 - and zero and next we're gonna write a
08:32 - hundred percent
08:33 - this is when the animation is fully
08:35 - completed what we would like to see
08:37 - and here we will like a background with
08:40 - position
08:42 - at 6 30 pixels
08:45 - and zero pictures like this
08:48 - and as you can already see and our
08:50 - template our earth
08:52 - is spinning and basically what this
08:56 - keyframe
08:57 - rotate does is that at zero percent we
09:00 - have
09:00 - our position at one place and then every
09:03 - four seconds it will go for a full
09:05 - rotation like this
09:08 - and um we have also told the animation
09:11 - to go
09:11 - at constant speed and basically forever
09:14 - so this is what we're seeing here and
09:17 - before we get carried away let's keep
09:19 - continue our css and do the h1 tag
09:24 - so to change header tag let's write h1
09:28 - in here we will change to position
09:32 - to relative and we'll give this
09:36 - the height of 100 pixels
09:40 - and a width of 300 pixels
09:45 - let's change the margin all around to
09:47 - auto
09:49 - let's make the top and the left padding
09:53 - and margin to be zero so here right top
09:56 - to be zero
09:57 - and let's left to also be zero
10:00 - and we want this text to be centralized
10:02 - so let's write text
10:05 - align to be centered
10:08 - and we add an animation for this where
10:10 - it changes color so here we can do
10:12 - animation
10:14 - color for one second and we'll have it
10:17 - go for infinite
10:20 - and again um we have defined
10:24 - the animation to use the animation
10:28 - called
10:28 - color which we have not yet told css
10:31 - what it is
10:32 - so here like we did with rotate we have
10:35 - to create a new keyframe
10:37 - so under here let's go and do add
10:40 - keyframes
10:41 - and the name we need the animation to be
10:44 - colored
10:46 - so here before the animation start at
10:49 - zero percent
10:51 - uh we will set the color of our text to
10:54 - red
10:56 - we can change um our color
11:00 - then to be green
11:05 - and then we can set our color to be
11:09 - corn flower blue
11:12 - and lastly we can sell our color
11:16 - to gray
11:21 - and at a hundred percent we'll add
11:25 - continually add color so here we add
11:27 - color
11:29 - pink and each color is separated by a
11:34 - semicolon
11:36 - and um here after this we have color
11:40 - red color
11:45 - purple and lastly we have
11:49 - color orange
11:56 - so doing this now you can as you can see
11:59 - um
12:01 - everything is changing color and um
12:04 - it's actually changing quite fast too so
12:07 - um
12:08 - maybe if you guessed want we can add a
12:11 - better delay
12:13 - um but as you can see it doesn't really
12:16 - matter it will just keep flipping
12:17 - through colors and you can kind of
12:20 - um decide which color you want so if i
12:23 - want color green
12:24 - i can just go here and move to clear
12:26 - green
12:29 - like so
12:32 - one more thing would do is we want to
12:34 - style earth
12:36 - and the globe depending on if he has
12:38 - been selected or not
12:40 - so we should define earth style before
12:44 - it's been selected
12:45 - and after he has been selected so let's
12:48 - do that before first
12:49 - here i'm alright earth
12:52 - and then before
12:56 - this will indicate that this is before
12:58 - he has been selected
13:00 - here i'll change the position to
13:02 - absolute
13:05 - then i will have the top have zero
13:08 - padding and margin so i'll put in zero
13:11 - and the same for the left so i'll put in
13:13 - zero for left so we have no padding or
13:15 - margin
13:16 - on the left and then i will change to
13:19 - width
13:20 - to 100 and
13:24 - change the height to 100
13:27 - now i'm gonna add content and inside
13:30 - content i'll
13:31 - leave it blank um so i'll just have an
13:33 - empty string like this
13:37 - for opacity let's change this to 0.2
13:41 - so it will be slightly less oblique and
13:44 - it'll be harder to see
13:47 - and let's do 40 a border radius
13:52 - of 50
13:56 - and lastly let's do background
14:00 - and add a radian
14:04 - uh gradient and
14:07 - circle
14:11 - at 100 pixels so here radio radians
14:15 - inside here we want to write circles at
14:18 - 100 pixel
14:20 - by 100 pixel so that is the height and
14:23 - width
14:24 - and the color will have hashtag
14:28 - ff
14:33 - and yeah this would be our css for
14:35 - before
14:37 - and now let's take a look at after so
14:41 - let's do earth
14:45 - after basically we have the exact same
14:49 - code
14:50 - so in fact from position to border
14:53 - radius it will be the same exact code so
14:55 - i'm going to copy and paste
14:57 - and it is at the background which it
15:00 - differs
15:01 - so in the background we'll actually
15:03 - start typing in our own values and sets
15:05 - so here we're typing negative 80 pixels
15:08 - followed by 15 pixels
15:12 - followed by 80 pixels followed by
15:15 - 10 pixels and then we write
15:19 - rgba and rgba takes in
15:23 - four numbers inside the first number is
15:25 - zero
15:27 - second number is zero the third number
15:30 - is zero
15:31 - and the fourth number is point nine
15:35 - and the last parameter we will write
15:38 - inset
15:40 - and yep and this would be our earth
15:44 - after it's been selected
15:47 - and yeah this is the whole css of this
15:50 - project
15:51 - including this html this is the whole
15:53 - part of the
15:55 - website so that is all for today
15:58 - in today's project we made a website
16:00 - similar to the rotating earth globe
16:03 - which uses css and html
16:07 - we used css animation background
16:11 - and position to make the globe rotate
