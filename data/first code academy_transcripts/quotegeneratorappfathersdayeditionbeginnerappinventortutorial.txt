00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to our
00:02 - channel
00:03 - here we share beginner friendly coding
00:05 - tutorials on scratch
00:07 - roblox minecraft web programming and
00:10 - many more
00:11 - today we are going to design a quote
00:13 - generator in app inventor
00:18 - in this project i will teach you how to
00:20 - create your own quote generator for
00:22 - father's day celebration
00:24 - on app invented it's basically an app
00:26 - that generates a random quote
00:28 - from the list you provide once you shake
00:30 - the device
00:31 - so let's get started
00:35 - we'll start by creating a new empty
00:36 - project on app inventor
00:38 - from this screen we'll change its title
00:40 - to happy father's day
00:42 - so for us to do that we just have to
00:44 - scroll down through the properties
00:46 - column and over here you'll see the
00:48 - title which is currently screen one
00:50 - that's the default title
00:52 - but since we want to change it to happy
00:55 - father's day you'll notice
00:58 - once we scroll back and look at the
01:00 - screen now we've changed the screen
01:02 - title
01:02 - into happy father's day then we'll add
01:06 - three components to make our project
01:08 - work
01:08 - first we'll add a label which is under
01:11 - the user interface section so once you
01:13 - click user interface
01:15 - you'll notice there's a label we want to
01:17 - click on that and drag it into the
01:18 - screen
01:19 - and there you have it secondly
01:22 - we want to add a accelerometer sensor
01:25 - which could be found
01:26 - in the sensor section down here
01:29 - you'll notice this is an accelerometer
01:31 - sensor same thing we drag it in and drop
01:34 - it
01:34 - and you'll notice it's a non-visible
01:36 - component which means it's something you
01:38 - cannot see
01:40 - okay awesome last we're going to need to
01:43 - add
01:43 - a text to speech object which is found
01:46 - in the media section
01:48 - so we'll click on media and
01:52 - we will find the text to speech over
01:55 - here
01:55 - drop it and there you have it we got
01:58 - another non-visible component
02:00 - and we got three total components
02:04 - so the label will display our father's
02:06 - day message the accelerometer
02:08 - will be used to detect when we shake the
02:10 - phone and the text to speech can be used
02:12 - to say out loud our message
02:15 - now we want to change the design of our
02:17 - screen so there's actually a couple ways
02:19 - to do that
02:20 - you can either add a background picture
02:22 - or make it a plain color
02:24 - let me show you how to do this so i
02:27 - decided to add a background color
02:29 - for me to be able to do that i can just
02:31 - click on upload file over here at the
02:33 - bottom of your screen
02:34 - in the media section and once i click on
02:37 - that i get to choose a file
02:39 - and i'm going to choose a file from my
02:41 - downloads
02:43 - and choose it and click ok
02:47 - and there you'll notice that there's
02:49 - something added now into our media
02:51 - and that's the the picture that i've
02:54 - uploaded
02:56 - so we want to save it then we want to go
02:59 - to the background image in the screen
03:00 - configuration and
03:02 - upload that image so for us to be able
03:04 - to do that
03:05 - we would have to go to screen one and
03:08 - you'll notice here there's a background
03:10 - image and it currently says none
03:12 - and that's why our background color is
03:13 - empty or our background image
03:15 - so we click on it and you'll notice now
03:17 - we have the media that we've uploaded
03:20 - so we just have to click ok and there
03:22 - you have it
03:23 - this is the image i uploaded and now
03:26 - it's
03:26 - showing on my screen so in here you can
03:30 - also change the alignment
03:32 - of your label so for us to do that
03:35 - we can just click on align horizontal
03:38 - which is
03:38 - currently says left and that's why
03:41 - you'll notice that our label
03:42 - is on the left but since we want to put
03:44 - that in the middle
03:46 - for better presentation we just want to
03:49 - click on center
03:50 - and there you have it awesome okay
03:54 - so next thing we want to do is we want
03:57 - to change
03:57 - the labels text into something more
04:00 - meaningful
04:01 - so we can easily do that by clicking on
04:04 - the label
04:05 - and changing the text instead of text
04:08 - for label one
04:09 - we want to put a meaningful message so
04:12 - perhaps something like
04:13 - shake for a father's day message that
04:16 - way
04:16 - it's not just a title but it's an
04:18 - instruction as well
04:20 - so shake for a father's day
04:24 - message awesome
04:28 - and we can even change the font size if
04:30 - it's a little bit too small for you
04:32 - we can change from 14 to 20 and there
04:34 - you go
04:35 - it's much clearer so
04:38 - make sure it reads as any instruction
04:41 - and
04:42 - maybe a meaningful message and you're
04:44 - good with that
04:46 - now we can move on to the coding section
04:49 - so we want to start off by creating a
04:51 - new variable
04:53 - i'll name it quotes so i'm just going to
04:55 - click on the variable section
04:57 - and i'm going to initialize a global
04:59 - name
05:00 - instead of global name however i want to
05:03 - change the name
05:04 - to quotes and then
05:07 - i want to attach a list to that so for
05:09 - us to be able to do that
05:10 - we can go ahead and click on list and we
05:13 - just want to make
05:14 - a list you'll notice
05:17 - we can only add two things onto the list
05:20 - since there's only two
05:21 - connectors over here and since i want to
05:23 - add a list of five
05:25 - quotes i can click on this blue button
05:29 - and add three more items into the list
05:33 - one two
05:35 - [Music]
05:36 - three and click on the button again and
05:39 - now you'll notice i have five connectors
05:42 - and so for me to be able to add um
05:45 - a code for each i can just click on text
05:49 - and get this empty string block
05:52 - and i'm just going to add five of those
05:57 - [Music]
06:04 - awesome here we have it perfect
06:08 - and this is the fun part now we can add
06:11 - five different
06:12 - quotes uh that we'd want so i got
06:16 - five ready uh my first one will be
06:19 - number one dad in the world
06:24 - all right second i want to say
06:28 - i'm so proud to be your kid
06:36 - and another one would be you make
06:38 - growing up
06:39 - fun
06:47 - and next i'm going to say dad you're in
06:50 - all my
06:51 - favorite memories
07:02 - and lastly i want to say you're the best
07:04 - at
07:11 - awesome there you got it so you don't
07:13 - necessarily have to follow my quotes
07:16 - you can find your own quotes create your
07:17 - own quotes feel free to do that
07:20 - the last part is also pretty simple we
07:23 - need to make it
07:23 - so that when we shake the phone we
07:25 - display a random quote
07:27 - remember that randomness is when we
07:29 - don't want
07:30 - we don't know what the next outcome is
07:33 - going to be
07:34 - first of all this event will happen when
07:37 - we shake the phone
07:38 - so we're going to start off by grabbing
07:40 - the when accelerometer sensor 1
07:43 - dot shaking block from the accelerometer
07:45 - sensor 1 section
07:47 - so you'll notice here we got
07:50 - the this event which is exactly what we
07:54 - need
07:56 - and inside of this block we can put all
07:58 - the instructions we want to run
08:00 - when we shake the phone so first we will
08:03 - set the label
08:04 - to the random message so for us to be
08:07 - able to do that
08:08 - we need to go to the label one section
08:11 - and
08:12 - we can use the set label one text to
08:14 - block
08:15 - to change the text of the label so
08:19 - like i said you go to the label one set
08:22 - label one dot text
08:25 - and we want to add that in and
08:28 - we want to set that to a random item in
08:31 - the list
08:32 - so for us to be able to do that there's
08:34 - actually
08:35 - a block that gives us a random item
08:38 - which is found in the list you can go
08:40 - ahead grab that block
08:42 - and plug it in and we want to get
08:45 - that random item from our
08:49 - quotes list or quotes variable so
08:53 - over here in variables uh we can just
08:57 - get this block and assign it the
09:01 - variable name
09:02 - called quotes awesome
09:06 - last thing we need to do is we want to
09:08 - get the text to speech
09:10 - block which will be found over here
09:13 - and we want to get the call text to
09:16 - speech dot speed block
09:18 - so we want to add that in and
09:22 - in terms of the message we want to make
09:24 - it the text of label one
09:27 - so over here in text
09:30 - oh sorry over in label one
09:33 - i'm gonna get e label label1
09:36 - dot text so
09:40 - over here uh the message will simply be
09:43 - the text we set before
09:45 - which we can see as a light green block
09:47 - below
09:48 - which is the set text to label one
09:51 - so there you have it awesome you can now
09:53 - show your dad this project to celebrate
09:55 - father's day
09:58 - and here we have the finished project
