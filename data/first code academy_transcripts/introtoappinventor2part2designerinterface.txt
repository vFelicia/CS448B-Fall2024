00:02 - welcome back
00:04 - so last lesson we have in last video we
00:08 - set up our projects balloon pop and
00:10 - we're now back in our project interphase
00:14 - we're going to have a tour around the
00:17 - designer interface of App Inventor so
00:20 - the App Inventor interface is divided
00:22 - into 4 columns you can see on the screen
00:25 - here the first one is the palace area
00:28 - the second part is the viewer where you
00:34 - can see the screen and how your app look
00:36 - like the third column is your components
00:39 - and media which is really what has been
00:42 - added onto your phone already the fourth
00:45 - column is properties now let's walk
00:49 - through every single column what it does
00:52 - and how we can use that so number one is
00:56 - our palette the palette is where we can
01:00 - find our components and drag them on the
01:04 - viewer and add them to your app this is
01:06 - really just like a palette when you're
01:09 - painting or when you're mixing matching
01:13 - colors where you can find any components
01:17 - you really need to add to your app the
01:21 - palette is divided into several
01:24 - categories themselves as well
01:26 - if you look into the palette the always
01:31 - the default is always user interface
01:35 - which are the buttons checkbox date
01:38 - picker image label etc so these
01:44 - components are organized by alphabetical
01:48 - order and after the user interface
01:52 - category you will be able to see layouts
01:57 - which is horizontal arrangement you can
02:02 - see horizontal scroll arrangement etc
02:06 - don't worry if you don't know what these
02:09 - components are about yet we will be
02:12 - learning
02:13 - all of these components step by step
02:15 - once we start building apps just want to
02:21 - show you a few more categories of
02:23 - pallets
02:25 - here we have media which is all sorts of
02:30 - fun things like the camera the image
02:33 - picker player sound we also have the
02:38 - drawing and animation category which is
02:41 - the ball canvas and image sprites very
02:46 - useful for for anytime you want to build
02:51 - a game also feel free to explore other
02:56 - categories here including the maps the
03:00 - sensors and social etc now after the
03:05 - palette we move on into the grand center
03:08 - of the screen which is always a viewer
03:10 - the viewer is really where you can drag
03:14 - your components from the palette to the
03:18 - app that you're designing so this is
03:22 - where you can see so view right so you
03:25 - can see what your app will look like
03:27 - right next to the viewer there is the
03:31 - components components and media is
03:34 - really where you can see what has been
03:38 - added onto your app so far later on as
03:42 - we're adding more and more components
03:44 - and as we're adding more media maybe
03:47 - it's an image or is a sound file you're
03:51 - gonna start to see this column getting
03:53 - populated with components and several
03:57 - media files next we have our properties
04:00 - the properties is where you can select a
04:04 - specific components and changes
04:07 - properties there so right now we only
04:10 - have one components on our screen which
04:13 - is arm screen one component so the
04:17 - screen itself is component as well with
04:20 - App Inventor and since is already
04:23 - selected you can see that we can
04:26 - changed several properties underneath we
04:30 - can change properties that are related
04:32 - to the screen one thing very
04:36 - straightforward is to change the apni so
04:39 - we talked about how in App Inventor it
04:43 - doesn't allow us to have space when it
04:46 - comes to naming our projects you're free
04:49 - to change however your app is called on
04:52 - the App Store and how you can change
04:55 - that is basically updating the app name
04:58 - property here and the straightforward
05:01 - thing that I would change is to have a
05:03 - space next to my app and there we go so
05:10 - you are able to see the balloon pop app
05:15 - now has a space in between it's easier
05:18 - for people to read so on and so forth we
05:23 - can also change the background color of
05:26 - our app and you can also change this is
05:31 - one of my favorite to change as well you
05:34 - can also change the title of the screen
05:36 - currently the titles cost green one and
05:39 - it's probably not necessary for us to
05:42 - tell out user that this is screen one so
05:46 - I'm gonna just change it to also my app
05:50 - name balloon pop so there we go this is
05:54 - pretty much our designer interface there
05:59 - are a few other components on the
06:00 - designer interface that we can play
06:03 - around with so on the top front here you
06:06 - can see that their screen 1 you can also
06:09 - press at screen and if I want to do that
06:13 - I can say ok and it would jump right
06:17 - into screen 2 for me so for now for the
06:22 - beginner version of the apps we are
06:24 - going to do screen 1 only and yeah let's
06:31 - now jump into the blocks area so for now
06:36 - we're going to focus on so for now we're
06:39 - gonna focus on
06:40 - only one screen apps don't worry we will
06:44 - always add more screens in future more
06:47 - complicated apps and there we go we can
06:52 - talk out between designer interface and
06:55 - blocks interface by pressing these two
06:57 - buttons and now let's jump into the
07:01 - blocks interface
