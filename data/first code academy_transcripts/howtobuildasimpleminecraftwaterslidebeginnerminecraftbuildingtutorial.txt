00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back to our
00:02 - channel
00:04 - here we share beginner-friendly coding
00:06 - tutorials on scratch
00:07 - roblox minecraft web programming and
00:10 - many more
00:11 - today we're gonna make a water slide in
00:13 - minecraft
00:15 - so for today's project we will learn how
00:17 - to make a big water slide in minecraft
00:20 - that looks like this
00:21 - where we have a platform where the user
00:23 - can climb up through the ladder
00:25 - and he can go down to the first slide
00:28 - and uh you can also go to the second
00:30 - slide which will
00:32 - you know bring them in through the water
00:35 - and then
00:35 - bring it into the main pool
00:39 - so yeah let's get started so to start
00:42 - this project
00:43 - i'll create a single player creative
00:45 - world in minecraft
00:47 - so first i'll click on single player and
00:50 - since i don't have a single player
00:52 - um it has told me to make a new world
00:55 - here i can just change the name to water
00:58 - slide
01:01 - i'm going to change the game mode to
01:02 - creative
01:04 - change the difficulty to peaceful so no
01:08 - mobs can distract us
01:10 - and then over here more world options
01:13 - i'm gonna go and change the world type
01:14 - so it says super flat
01:17 - so use super flat as the work type and
01:20 - then i can go and create world
01:25 - so yep as the world loads in we can see
01:27 - that this is some
01:28 - super flat world where everything just
01:31 - flat
01:33 - um here i'm in creative mode so if i
01:34 - press e i can enter my inventory
01:36 - and grab any items and um the game of
01:40 - minecraft
01:40 - so here i'm just gonna grab um
01:42 - [Music]
01:44 - scroll down and then
01:47 - i'm just gonna grab two blocks so i'm
01:48 - gonna go to clay and grab
01:50 - a red play block
01:53 - and maybe yellow
01:56 - okay so for the first part of the
02:01 - water slide we'll want to put
02:04 - a shape that resembles a water slide so
02:07 - let's
02:08 - do that um so the shape we want is going
02:11 - to have the following pattern
02:12 - i'm going to have two blocks side by
02:15 - side
02:16 - and then move up one block like this
02:20 - and this block is gonna have five blocks
02:22 - so one
02:23 - two three four five
02:27 - so two blocks four five five blocks and
02:30 - then followed by three blocks up top so
02:32 - again oops two blocks five
02:36 - blocks three blocks
02:40 - here we're gonna have two blocks
02:46 - this and followed by two one
02:50 - block so one block one block like this
02:54 - so this will be the shape that we will
02:55 - have so two blocks five
02:57 - three two one one and we want to make
03:01 - this platform
03:02 - two blocks thick so let's add a
03:04 - caterpillar on the other side
03:21 - all right and on this side um i'm going
03:23 - to add
03:24 - kind of the border for the slide so we
03:26 - can't fall off so here i'm going to put
03:29 - block like this
03:32 - and so the red blocks should have the
03:36 - same shape as
03:37 - these uh yellow blocks
03:40 - here i'm gonna put down blocks on the
03:42 - side
03:44 - like that and
03:48 - keep the corners um empty or
03:51 - blockless
03:55 - okay so that's my first side
03:58 - look at this
04:04 - okay now i'm gonna do the other side
04:26 - oops
04:35 - so after you have got the slide to look
04:37 - like this we can add the second part to
04:39 - this slide
04:40 - so here let's take out these two red
04:43 - blocks
04:44 - and let's increase the size of our
04:46 - yellow blocks
04:47 - to be one block higher next i'm gonna
04:51 - grab the c
04:52 - lanterns from the inventory so i can go
04:54 - to search items over here
04:56 - and look up c lantern and then i can
04:58 - just drag it to my inventory
05:01 - and what we're going to do here is
05:02 - actually make a platform surrounding
05:04 - this top
05:04 - yellow platform so here i'll add a few
05:07 - blocks to the back extend it
05:10 - wide and here i'm gonna make this block
05:13 - six blocks uh wide so here three four
05:17 - five six and then i'm gonna loop this
05:20 - back
05:20 - to connect with this
05:24 - up here so we'll have a four by six
05:27 - uh rectangle
05:34 - after this we should expand this
05:37 - platform
05:38 - here so i'm going to add yellow blocks
05:40 - all the way around
05:42 - even in the corners
05:58 - okay and what i'm going to do is add
06:02 - um an extra layer on just a corner
06:06 - so that you can have a
06:10 - platform that looks something like this
06:18 - so i extended the sides um by one block
06:21 - but left the center of the corner uh
06:25 - as air so so so now we should get
06:28 - something like this
06:30 - where the water size comes down here
06:33 - and over here there's a platform
06:39 - similar to uh the bottom part of the
06:42 - slide we'll be adding
06:44 - red blocks as the board so here i'm
06:47 - going to have
06:49 - red blocks border like this
06:54 - and i'm just going to surround this
06:55 - border around
06:57 - this platform that we have
07:08 - like so
07:22 - and so we should get something like this
07:28 - and now um let's add some water
07:31 - so um we want to add water
07:35 - to fill up this whole platform and water
07:38 - flows down here so let's just add
07:40 - uh an area for the water pool to kind of
07:43 - form
07:43 - at the bottom of the slide so let's grab
07:46 - another block
07:47 - um go down here
07:53 - and grab some ports
07:57 - and we can just kind of make um a 10 by
08:00 - 10
08:01 - rectangle around um it's fine the size
08:04 - my sauce is kind of
08:06 - symmetrical so here actually i'm just
08:08 - gonna go
08:09 - four blocks this way so one two three
08:12 - four and then place that one block so
08:13 - there's five blocks apart so
08:17 - five so one two three
08:21 - four five
08:26 - something like this so i have five
08:28 - blocks
08:29 - between this yellow block and this white
08:31 - block
08:34 - and um let's make this block
08:40 - uh 12 by 12 square so here are three
08:44 - four five six
08:47 - seven and i'm gonna move it across like
08:52 - this
08:55 - again uh what block you pick is all
08:58 - preference
08:59 - so
09:05 - here i can just go in
09:08 - downward
09:19 - okay great and now let's grab a water
09:23 - bucket
09:26 - and uh let's fill this place up with
09:28 - water so we just have to put the water
09:30 - box
09:31 - um around here so we can actually just
09:35 - put it
09:35 - um on all four corners
09:39 - i like to put it on all the edges so
09:41 - that the water will be flowing to the
09:43 - middle
09:45 - so i'm just going to add water source to
09:47 - the corner blocks
09:56 - as you can see now we have a water slide
09:58 - going down
10:00 - like so so finally we're going to add
10:05 - one more layer it's kind of similar to
10:07 - this bottom layer over here
10:09 - above this swimming pool so
10:12 - we have two layers to our water slide
10:16 - so here i'm gonna add uh
10:19 - from these two blocks i'm gonna quickly
10:22 - change these two blocks to yellow blocks
10:25 - so i can tell and here i'm gonna expand
10:29 - this to
10:30 - two blocks wide
10:33 - followed by five blocks
10:37 - followed by three blocks
10:40 - followed by two blocks followed by one
10:44 - block
10:44 - and one block and again to make this
10:48 - two blocks wide
10:58 - and we'll do the same thing that's the
11:00 - first slide where we add the border
11:03 - like so
11:16 - that we'll do that for
11:19 - a whole slide
11:39 - like that
11:44 - and finally over here i'll add
11:48 - some platforms and i'm gonna grab
11:50 - ladders
11:53 - and what i'm gonna do is have a platform
11:55 - that stands out
12:00 - like this
12:03 - and i'm expanded so
12:09 - and i'm gonna have this wall connect to
12:11 - the bottom
12:13 - or all the way to the floor
12:32 - [Music]
12:34 - almost there
12:42 - perfect and now i'm just going to have
12:44 - one ladder
12:46 - so that the user can climb up
13:24 - and yeah this is going to be our whole
13:26 - water slide for today
13:32 - so that's all for today hope you guys
