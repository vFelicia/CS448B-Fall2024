00:05 - coding tutorials on scratch
00:07 - roblox minecraft um web programming and
00:10 - many more
00:10 - today what we're going to be doing is a
00:13 - scratch
00:14 - tutorial on a project called five things
00:17 - i like about nature
00:19 - in this project we're going to be
00:20 - creating a simple scratch
00:22 - animation about five things i like in
00:25 - nature
00:26 - and when i click on a green flag right
00:28 - here the story would start
00:30 - when i press and space bar the fact
00:32 - number would change so now we're on fact
00:34 - number one
00:35 - two three four and five
00:38 - and in the end we also have the the end
00:41 - page
00:42 - so let's get started so we are going to
00:45 - create a project
00:47 - on scratch and you can find scratch by
00:49 - going to the link called
00:52 - scratch.mit.edu and to start with the
00:54 - project we're going to click
00:56 - on this create button right here
01:02 - all right so once our new project is
01:04 - created we're going to go ahead and
01:06 - delete the scratch cat sprite right here
01:08 - by clicking on the
01:10 - trash bin um icon right here
01:14 - all right now the next thing we need to
01:16 - do is add in the backdrops
01:19 - all right so we're gonna go to backdrops
01:21 - all right so once we're
01:22 - here we're gonna go ahead and click
01:24 - choose a backdrop
01:26 - and choose our backdrop so we're going
01:30 - to go ahead with
01:31 - a backdrop that's more related to nature
01:34 - theme so we can search up nature right
01:38 - there
01:40 - can go ahead so i'm going to go ahead
01:42 - and choose this one
01:44 - all right this is my first one and i'm
01:47 - going to add
01:48 - more until i have six in total
01:53 - okay my second one
01:56 - and i'm gonna go ahead and choose my
01:59 - third one
02:07 - okay and the fourth one
02:12 - go with this one
02:16 - and my fifth one
02:19 - all right okay so i have the first
02:22 - backdrop for my first fact second
02:25 - third fourth and fifth okay
02:29 - now i'm gonna go back to my first
02:30 - backdrop because i'm gonna need to make
02:32 - a
02:33 - title page and in the title page i'm
02:35 - gonna write
02:36 - five things i like about nature
02:39 - so i'm gonna use my paint brush tool
02:41 - right here
02:43 - and choose a color using this fill
02:46 - function
02:48 - and i'm gonna go with blue
02:53 - all right i can also change my pen size
02:55 - right here so right now it's set at the
02:57 - size
02:58 - 10. i'm going to make it 13.
03:05 - so five okay
03:08 - and then i'm going to choose a different
03:10 - color now for the
03:11 - better word five
03:16 - things
03:22 - all right now if you're not very um
03:25 - familiar with using the painting tool
03:27 - you can go ahead and use this text tool
03:29 - as well
03:30 - so when you use the text tool and you
03:32 - click on your backdrop you can actually
03:34 - type out the words so instead of
03:36 - drawing it out just like i did you can
03:38 - go ahead and type
03:39 - five things like so
03:43 - all right but i prefer the painting tool
03:45 - so i'm going to go ahead and delete this
03:52 - all right so five things
04:03 - i like
04:08 - and then again i'm going to change
04:12 - about
04:17 - okay nature
04:27 - all right so now we have five things i
04:29 - like about nature which is our title
04:31 - page okay so now that we have this we're
04:34 - gonna go ahead
04:35 - to our second backdrop here to write the
04:37 - first thing we like
04:40 - okay so for the first fact i'm going to
04:44 - use the text tool right here
04:46 - and type in number one i
04:49 - like the smell of flowers
04:53 - so that's my first fact for my second
04:57 - fact
04:57 - again i'm going to use the text tool
05:00 - choose a different color
05:01 - from my backdrop so i'm going to go with
05:04 - maybe red
05:06 - and type in 2 time
05:09 - feels slower
05:13 - when i'm with nature
05:17 - all right this is number two and then
05:20 - we're gonna do a number three so since
05:23 - the background's
05:26 - more purplish then i'm gonna go with
05:29 - something that has a lot of contrast
05:31 - like yellow
05:32 - and type in number three
05:35 - i get creative ideas when i look at
05:39 - nature
05:41 - okay this is my fact number three again
05:43 - i can move it around
05:45 - like so okay maybe i'll move it to the
05:48 - bottom
05:49 - so here number three i get creative
05:51 - ideas when i look at nature
05:53 - okay so moving on to number four okay
05:59 - i'm going to choose something that's a
06:00 - little bit different so there's yellow
06:02 - here so i'm going to switch to
06:03 - pink and type in
06:07 - four there are
06:10 - [Music]
06:12 - mint the ear
06:15 - is cleaner and
06:19 - more fresh
06:22 - okay this is my fourth fact the area is
06:26 - cleaner and more fresh
06:28 - i'm gonna move it here and make it
06:32 - bigger
06:36 - okay there is cleaner oops
06:40 - made a spilling mistake here the ear
06:44 - okay is cleaner and more fresh
06:48 - and the fifth one okay so it's
06:52 - at the beach i'll go ahead and write
06:55 - number five i like the sound of
06:59 - waves okay so this is my fifth
07:03 - fat all right so let's go ahead and have
07:06 - a look so the first one is five things i
07:08 - like about nature
07:10 - fact number one i like the small flowers
07:12 - number two time feel slower when i'm
07:14 - with nature
07:16 - three i get creative ideas when i look
07:18 - at nature
07:19 - for the areas cleaner and more fresh and
07:22 - five i like the sound of waves okay
07:26 - now the last thing we need to do is just
07:27 - add the end
07:29 - backdrop so i'm going to go ahead and
07:31 - choose a backdrop for that
07:34 - and i'm going to go with something
07:35 - simple like this
07:37 - okay for the uh the end backdrop
07:41 - and for this one i'm going to switch
07:42 - back to my painting tool
07:44 - and choose yellow right
07:48 - the end
07:54 - okay so that's it with our
07:57 - backdrop design now the next step would
07:59 - be to start
08:00 - coding it okay so
08:03 - to start coding we need to go ahead and
08:06 - click on the code
08:06 - tab here to code the project
08:10 - all right and then at the beginning of
08:12 - our
08:13 - uh project we want to start with the
08:15 - title page
08:16 - so let's go to the event and drag in
08:18 - when the green flag is clicked
08:20 - even okay and when green flag is clicked
08:26 - now we also want to make sure that
08:30 - when the story starts we are at the
08:33 - correct backdrop in our case it would be
08:35 - the title page
08:36 - so we're going to go ahead to looks and
08:39 - choose the backdrop
08:40 - choose the block that says switch
08:43 - backdrop to
08:45 - so our first backdrop is actually called
08:47 - backdrop1
08:49 - and we're going to connect it to when
08:51 - green flag is clicked okay
08:54 - next we have to give instructions that
08:56 - whenever we press the space bar
08:58 - the backdrop should change to our fax
09:02 - so i'm going to go drag um the event
09:05 - called when
09:05 - space key is pressed right here from
09:07 - events
09:10 - okay and then i'm going to say all right
09:12 - so when space key is pressed i want to
09:14 - switch to the next
09:16 - backdrop now we have completed the
09:19 - project so let's click on the green flag
09:22 - to start
09:22 - our scratch animation all right so you
09:25 - can see when i click on the green flag
09:27 - it brings me to the title page
09:29 - which is what we want okay so now when i
09:32 - click on space bar
09:34 - it goes to the second backdrop and then
09:37 - fact number two
09:39 - number three four five the end page
