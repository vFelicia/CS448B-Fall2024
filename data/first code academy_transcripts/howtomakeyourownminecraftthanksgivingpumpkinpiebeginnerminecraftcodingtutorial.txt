00:13 - pumpkin pie
00:14 - and a soap that is edible in the
00:16 - minecraft world
00:18 - for this project i'll be using an open
00:20 - source software called m creator to
00:23 - create my food elements
00:25 - using the software you can create
00:27 - minecraft java edition mods
00:30 - such as biomes weapons custom dimensions
00:34 - tools and many more you can find the
00:37 - link to the software down in the
00:39 - description
00:40 - box so let's go ahead and see how we can
00:43 - create
00:44 - our own minecraft food element
00:47 - all right to start off with i'll be
00:50 - creating a workspace
00:51 - in encrypted that will hold all my mod
00:54 - elements
00:55 - so i'm going to go ahead and click on
00:56 - new workspace
00:59 - and then i'm going to give a name for my
01:02 - workspace
01:04 - it's called food elements
01:09 - and then i'm going to go ahead and click
01:11 - on
01:12 - create new workspace option
01:19 - next it will open up the webpage and
01:24 - created.net
01:27 - but if you go back onto the m creator
01:29 - software you can see
01:30 - that it's going to create all the
01:32 - project files the cradle
01:34 - directories and all the elements that
01:37 - would be needed
01:38 - to make your project
01:45 - all right once the workspace has been
01:48 - built successfully let's go ahead and
