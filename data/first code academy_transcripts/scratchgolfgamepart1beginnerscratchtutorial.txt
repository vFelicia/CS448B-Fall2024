00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to our
00:02 - channel
00:03 - here we share beginner friendly coding
00:05 - tutorials on scratch minecraft
00:07 - roblox web programming and many more and
00:10 - today what we're going to do is design a
00:12 - mini golf game using scratch
00:18 - in this part one of the project we will
00:19 - focus on the basic controls of the game
00:21 - and the ball movement and in the second
00:23 - part we'll continue with the development
00:25 - of the game in the other parts
00:27 - so let's get started so before we
00:30 - um start i would also want to show you a
00:32 - little bit of a
00:34 - demo of how the game will work so as you
00:36 - can see here we have
00:37 - sort of a mini golf course and what i'm
00:40 - going to do is i'm going to aim for the
00:42 - ball to
00:42 - go inside the hole right here so what
00:45 - i'd have to do is i had to click
00:47 - on this red dot and then click on my
00:49 - spacebar to make the ball move there
00:52 - so here you go and now i am in level two
00:58 - we'll start by creating a new empty
01:01 - project on scratch
01:02 - and the very first step will be to
01:04 - create an empty field and what we want
01:06 - to do is draw a green square in the
01:07 - background and add a rectangle of a
01:09 - different shade of green
01:11 - and make sure it has a black border all
01:13 - right so
01:15 - here i'm going to make the background
01:18 - okay which is the darker green color
01:22 - i'll do something like that okay and
01:25 - then in the middle
01:26 - i'll have another one so i'll do it
01:30 - i'll do it a different shade of green
01:36 - okay and then my outline i want black so
01:38 - that's
01:39 - good okay then i will make it
01:43 - look something like this now we'll add
01:47 - two sprites one for the ball and one for
01:49 - the whole so for the ball sprite you can
01:51 - just make a white circle and resize it
01:53 - so it's not
01:54 - too big so let's do the ball first
01:58 - okay so first of all i need to delete
01:59 - the scratch cat
02:01 - then i'm gonna go ahead and draw
02:05 - a ball and choose a white color
02:15 - something like that now i'm gonna need
02:17 - to resize it
02:21 - okay so that's the ball right there let
02:23 - me also rename this right to ball
02:26 - then i'll duplicate it right here and
02:29 - then
02:30 - make the other one the whole right
02:33 - now let me fill it with a different
02:35 - color of course i will do
02:36 - a gray color like so
02:40 - and i'm going to put it right opposite
02:42 - the ball i think i'm going to make it a
02:43 - little bigger let's say
02:45 - 80 or a little smaller
02:49 - 70 like so place it right here
02:53 - now we can define the controls of the
02:55 - game so we'll use the distance to the
02:57 - mouse to determine the power of the shot
03:00 - and then the position to determine the
03:02 - angle of the shot
03:03 - so to do that we need to add some blocks
03:05 - into the golf ball
03:07 - okay so now that i'm in the golf ball um
03:10 - sprite i'm going to go ahead and add in
03:12 - the
03:13 - when green flag clicks and what i want
03:16 - to do is i want to make sure that the
03:18 - ball sprite the position is reset in the
03:20 - beginning so i'm going to go to motion
03:23 - choose this block go to x y i'm going to
03:26 - choose to do
03:27 - minus 175 for x and
03:31 - 0 for y okay so it's gonna
03:34 - look pretty much the same thing right
03:36 - here and then what i want to do is i
03:39 - want to go ahead and
03:40 - also set the direction so i'm going to
03:43 - stay
03:44 - point in direction 90 all right
03:47 - and then i'm going to set the speed of
03:49 - it so i'm going to go to control
03:51 - i'm sorry variables and then make a
03:53 - variable called speed
03:57 - and then i'm going to say set speed to
04:00 - zero
04:00 - and another variable is moving so
04:04 - moving okay and then i'm going to also
04:07 - set moving to zero
04:09 - now another thing i want to do is that i
04:12 - want to set up a conditional and
04:14 - this if this conditional is that i want
04:16 - to only point to the mouse pointer
04:19 - if the ball is not moving so here i'm
04:22 - going to set the condition to equal to
04:24 - zero the moving
04:25 - on variable i'm going to set it to equal
04:27 - to zero and we can use
04:29 - moving equals to one whenever we want to
04:31 - stop some actions if the ball is moving
04:34 - such as this point towards the block so
04:36 - i'm going to go ahead
04:38 - and control and get the forever loop and
04:41 - what i'm going to do is set up my
04:42 - condition like i was saying so get the
04:44 - if
04:45 - and here i'm i'm going to say if the
04:48 - moving variable is equal to 0
04:53 - then that is when i make the ball move
04:55 - towards wherever i click just now
04:58 - so i will go to motion and do a point
05:00 - towards
05:01 - mouse pointer now we can start coding
05:04 - the ball movement so when we press the
05:06 - space bar the
05:07 - ball will start to move to the direction
05:09 - um we're facing
05:11 - so i will start by changing the value of
05:13 - moving to one so that the direction that
05:15 - the ball is facing doesn't change
05:17 - anymore
05:18 - so we said before that we wanted to
05:20 - control the speed of the ball
05:22 - so what i'll do right now is i'll set it
05:24 - up so that the max speed of the ball is
05:26 - 20.
05:27 - all right so here what i'm going to do
05:29 - is i'm going to go to control
05:32 - i'll start event and i'm going to say
05:33 - when space key pressed so that's when
05:35 - you press on your spacebar
05:37 - i will set my variable moving to one
05:41 - so set moving to one
05:44 - and then i'm going to get a condition
05:48 - so in control i'll say if
05:52 - all right if the distance is bigger than
05:55 - 200 because i want to make it so that
05:58 - the farther away the mouse pointer is
06:00 - from the ball the faster the ball will
06:02 - travel
06:03 - so there's actually a block in fencing
06:05 - that does just that
06:06 - so um just now i mentioned 200 right so
06:10 - what i want to do is i want to make the
06:12 - number smaller so that the ball doesn't
06:14 - travel
06:15 - way too fast so since i said the max
06:17 - speed is going to be 20
06:18 - i can divide the maximum number of
06:20 - pixels away from another number
06:22 - so that i get 20. so in my case just now
06:26 - i pick 200 as the max distance
06:28 - so i have to divide it by 10 to get 20.
06:31 - so i will add that
06:32 - in a block so that the variable speed
06:34 - gets that value
06:36 - now if the value is above 200 then i'm
06:39 - just going to
06:40 - set it to 20 regardless of the value of
06:42 - the distance
06:44 - here i'm going to go to operators and
06:45 - i'm going to get the bigger than
06:48 - and i want to go to sensing and say
06:51 - distance
06:52 - to mouse pointer okay if distance to
06:56 - mouse pointer like i said is bigger than
06:58 - 200 then i'm going to set the speed to
07:01 - 20.
07:06 - all right and then here what i want to
07:08 - do is i want to add another
07:10 - if okay so i'll say if
07:16 - okay if it's not bigger than 200 then
07:19 - what i want to do
07:20 - so i go back to operators i can get the
07:23 - smaller than sign
07:25 - let me duplicate this okay so if it is
07:29 - smaller than 200
07:33 - actually let me get the smaller than or
07:35 - equal to
07:36 - i'm gonna get the or and i'll say if
07:38 - distance
07:39 - to mouse pointer is smaller than 200 or
07:42 - equal to 200
07:46 - okay let me place that right there
07:53 - equal to 200
07:56 - then what i'm going to do is i'm going
07:58 - to set the speed
08:00 - right let me create some space
08:04 - okay so i'm going to go to my variables
08:06 - and set speed
08:10 - to the
08:13 - okay divide so the distance to the mouse
08:15 - pointer divided by 10.
08:22 - now we can set up a loop to move the
08:24 - ball until it runs out of speed so what
08:27 - we want to do is first we want to start
08:29 - by
08:29 - placing a loop again so go to control
08:33 - and we're going to get
08:34 - repeat until right here
08:37 - that's where we're going to place it and
08:40 - we're going to say repeat
08:41 - until speed is smaller than zero okay
08:45 - we'll go to variables grab speed and
08:48 - smaller than
08:48 - zero and what we want to do next is
08:52 - we're going to say move
08:54 - okay move and then the speed variable
08:58 - okay so move speed step and then we want
09:01 - to change the speed um
09:03 - by minus 0.5 so that we want the ball to
09:06 - slow down while
09:07 - when it's about to reach the hole so we
09:10 - say
09:11 - change
09:14 - feed by minus 0.5
09:18 - okay and then at the end we also want to
09:21 - make sure
09:22 - that moving and speed are both at zero
09:25 - so set moving to zero and then
09:29 - set speed to zero
09:32 - finally we'll handle the bouncing off
09:35 - the walls part
09:36 - so to do that we'll add an instruction
09:38 - inside the loop we have right now
09:40 - for moving the ball so when the ball
09:42 - touches the collar of the edge of the
09:44 - field
09:44 - then what we're going to do is that it's
09:46 - going to change its direction and start
09:48 - moving that way
09:50 - so due to how angles work we need a
09:52 - different instruction for the vertical
09:54 - and horizontal borders of the field so
09:56 - what we can do is we can add two lines
09:58 - of different colors to the background on
10:00 - the sides of the field so that we can
10:02 - perform two different kinds of checks
10:05 - for changing the direction
10:07 - so what we're going to do is we're also
10:09 - going to say for the upper and lower
10:11 - borders we'll set it up to change the
10:13 - direction by
10:14 - 180 minus the current direction so you
10:17 - can get that direction block from the
10:18 - motion section
10:20 - and then for the horizontal borders the
10:22 - change of direction would be
10:23 - 360 minus the current direction so what
10:27 - i'll do now is i'll go to backdrop
10:29 - all right and then add the lines that i
10:30 - was talking about so here we're going to
10:32 - get the line tool
10:34 - okay and then i'm going to make it a
10:36 - gray color
10:43 - okay all right gray color and then i'm
10:46 - going to place it on the upper and lower
10:48 - parts of the
10:49 - edges so okay i think we'll need to make
10:52 - it
10:52 - make the line a little thicker so i
10:54 - think i'll try eight
10:57 - okay let me change it back to gray
11:03 - all right okay so this is the
11:15 - upper border okay so on one side
11:19 - and then i want another one okay let me
11:22 - make the line just a little bit bigger
11:24 - let's say 12. okay that looks a lot
11:26 - better and then we have another one
11:29 - in this direction okay
11:33 - so that is the other part and then i'll
11:35 - also make a thicker black line
11:37 - here so let's say it's
11:41 - nine or let's say 12.
11:44 - okay let me readjust this part
11:48 - okay let's do even thicker 14
11:52 - and another part right here 14.
11:56 - all right so now let's go back to code
11:59 - so we want to come back
12:00 - into the ball sprite and then we're
12:02 - going to add in some conditions
12:04 - so we're going to say if we are
12:07 - touching the color black so that is the
12:10 - upper and lower borders
12:13 - okay touching the color black let me use
12:15 - color dropper for this
12:17 - okay we are going to change the
12:19 - direction so we say point in direction
12:23 - and then we're going to do 180 minus its
12:25 - current direction
12:28 - so 180 minus its current direction
12:35 - okay and then we're going to duplicate
12:37 - this condition and set it up for the
12:39 - left and right borders so if touching
12:42 - color
12:43 - let me grab this color right here if
12:45 - touching gray color then we'll do 360
12:49 - minus the current direction all right so
12:51 - we're done with the first part of this
12:53 - video
12:54 - and let's try to test it out so right
12:57 - now what
12:57 - is going to happen is when i click green
13:00 - flag the ball is going to appear right
13:01 - here it's going to sort of follow my
13:03 - mouse and let's say i move my mouse here
13:06 - and then when i click space the ball is
13:08 - going to follow
13:09 - me to that direction so in the next part
13:12 - we'll adjust the necessary components
13:13 - for the game such as the grass obstacle
13:15 - the water obstacle and hitting the ball
13:17 - into the hole
13:18 - so that's all for today hope you liked
13:20 - the video and don't forget to subscribe
13:23 - and like our other videos also check out
13:25 - the other two videos here while you're
13:27 - waiting for the second part
13:29 - all right thank you bye
