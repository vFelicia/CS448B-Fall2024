00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to our
00:02 - channel
00:03 - here we share beginner friendly coding
00:05 - tutorials on scratch roblox minecraft
00:08 - and many more and today what we're going
00:10 - to do
00:10 - is a scratch junior project about a
00:14 - jungle animation
00:17 - in this project i'm going to teach you
00:18 - how to create your jungle animation
00:20 - using scratch so here's a little
00:22 - demonstration of the project we have
00:24 - some animals
00:25 - when we click on them there will be some
00:27 - animations
00:29 - all right like so and then we also have
00:33 - a zookeeper right here so the zookeeper
00:35 - is sort of the person who does the
00:37 - introduction
00:38 - okay so here he's saying we're going to
00:40 - the jungle today
00:44 - on the characters to see them move then
00:46 - i also have a school bus
00:47 - that brings the zookeeper
00:51 - back so let's get started in making our
00:54 - project
00:56 - we'll start by adding a zookeeper in our
00:58 - project
00:59 - so here i have chosen tech to be my
01:01 - zookeeper
01:02 - now what i'm going to do is i'm going to
01:04 - use my painting tool to give him some
01:06 - hat and some clothes so i'm going to
01:08 - click on my painting tool right now and
01:11 - i'm gonna first start off by giving him
01:13 - a hat
01:14 - so here i have uh tex hat ready now the
01:18 - next thing i'm going to do is also draw
01:20 - a shirt for tick
01:22 - okay and the last thing i want to do is
01:25 - i'm also going to go ahead and add some
01:27 - zookeeper boots for tick
01:30 - okay now that i have added all of the
01:32 - things that we want the zookeeper to
01:34 - have i'm going to click on the tick mark
01:36 - and place him
01:37 - in our project i'm going to place him in
01:39 - the bottom left corner
01:40 - now i'm gonna go ahead and add in the
01:42 - jungle background
01:45 - right here okay and the next thing i'm
01:48 - going to do is i'm going to add in the
01:50 - bus character so that um it can be
01:54 - shown right here above it
01:58 - okay now i have it above tick right here
02:02 - the next thing i'm going to do is add
02:03 - three animals that is going to be
02:05 - displayed in our jungle
02:07 - so i'm gonna start off with adding a
02:09 - monkey
02:10 - right here okay since it's a little bit
02:13 - big i'm also going to use the purple
02:15 - shrinking block
02:16 - to make him a little smaller so that he
02:19 - fits
02:20 - right here on the school bus and then
02:22 - the next thing would be to add
02:24 - second animal i'm going to go ahead and
02:26 - choose a giraffe
02:28 - okay so again the giraffe would need
02:30 - some shrinking so let me go ahead and
02:32 - shrink it
02:33 - and put it right here and then add in my
02:35 - third animal which is going to be a
02:37 - snake
02:42 - okay so now that i have added in all my
02:45 - animals the next thing i'm going to do
02:47 - is i'm going to start coating our
02:48 - zookeeper
02:49 - tick so the first thing i want to do is
02:52 - of course
02:53 - um green flag i want to make sure when i
02:55 - click green flag that
02:57 - whatever tick does uh it's supposed to
02:59 - do is starting to
03:01 - work so i'm going to get my green flag
03:05 - then get my speech bubble right in my
03:08 - speech bubble right here i'm going to
03:11 - put in we're
03:14 - going to the
03:18 - jungle today
03:23 - okay now before he says that i also want
03:25 - him to move to the right 10 steps
03:28 - so i'm going to put that before the
03:29 - speech block and add in 10 steps
03:33 - okay and then after he does that i want
03:35 - him to pause a little bit
03:37 - so i'm just gonna put in two units for
03:39 - the time
03:40 - and then put in another message so in
03:43 - this message
03:44 - i'm going to basically provide the
03:46 - instructions on how to use our animation
03:48 - so i'm going to say tap on the
03:51 - characters
03:53 - to see them move
03:56 - okay and after he says that pause again
03:58 - for two more seconds
04:00 - and then stop
04:04 - all right now we're going to go ahead
04:06 - and coat the bus in our project
04:08 - so that when we click on the bus it
04:10 - moves forward a little bit
04:12 - pause this for a while and then sends a
04:14 - message to tick so that tick can
04:16 - disappear
04:18 - all right so to send a message we would
04:20 - need to send message block
04:22 - so we're gonna first start off by going
04:24 - to our school
04:25 - bus right get our event on character tax
04:29 - and then go ahead and say all right when
04:32 - that happens
04:33 - we want to move to the right two units
04:36 - and then send a message to our zookeeper
04:40 - so that would be again another event and
04:42 - i'm gonna choose the
04:44 - orange envelope after i do that i'm
04:46 - going to wait for
04:48 - four seconds and then
04:51 - i'm going to go ahead and just move to
04:55 - the right
04:56 - for 10 steps and then disappear
04:59 - and then stop so i'm gonna go to my
05:01 - purple blog to get the disappear block
05:04 - right here
05:05 - and then get in my stop block
05:08 - so the reason we want to send our
05:10 - zookeeper a message
05:12 - is that so when he opens it he says
05:14 - goodbye
05:15 - so we're going to get the open message
05:18 - block
05:18 - all right and then i'm going to get my
05:21 - speech bubble right here that we just
05:23 - got earlier
05:24 - and i'm going to say i gotta go have
05:27 - fun okay so when he says that we're
05:30 - going to go ahead and
05:32 - put in some time blocks again so we're
05:34 - going to put in
05:35 - three this time
05:38 - okay so three and then now when we put
05:42 - in that block we're going to get the
05:43 - move up block so he
05:45 - looks like he's moving into move going
05:47 - into the school bus
05:49 - okay making sure he also disappears
05:52 - and then we can finally put in the stop
05:55 - block
05:56 - now that we've coated both the bus and
05:58 - the zookeeper it's time to coat the
06:00 - animal so i'm going to start off with my
06:02 - giraffe
06:03 - again i'm going to get my character
06:05 - tapped event
06:06 - and i'm going to use the repeat block
06:08 - right here
06:09 - so that's repeat four times because i
06:11 - have the number four
06:12 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to use
06:15 - my
06:16 - turn around lock okay so first turn to
06:19 - the right side then the left side for
06:23 - two okay and then back again
06:26 - at one all right so that's for my
06:29 - giraffe
06:29 - now moving on to my monkey i'm going to
06:32 - say when
06:33 - character attacked i'm going to make it
06:35 - go to the
06:36 - right side for three units
06:40 - and then move down for five units
06:44 - okay and then also some turn turning
06:47 - block
06:48 - so i'm gonna use turn right two
06:51 - okay and then some hot block okay again
06:54 - i'm gonna use
06:55 - two so i'm not changing anything and
06:58 - then i'm gonna do
06:59 - move to the right 14 times
07:02 - 14 units and then disappear
07:06 - of course we need our stop block
07:10 - and lastly i'm going to go ahead and
07:12 - code the snake now for the snake
07:14 - again same event one character clicked
07:17 - and i'm going to make it move to the
07:20 - right
07:20 - by eight blocks eight units sorry
07:25 - and then return back
07:28 - and then stop all right
07:32 - so let's have a look at our final
07:33 - project now
07:35 - all right so we're gonna go ahead and of
07:37 - course click on our green flag
07:40 - so we have our zookeeper here we're
07:42 - going to the jungle today
07:45 - okay tap on the characters to see the
07:47 - move then i'm gonna click on my school
07:49 - bus
07:49 - and he says i gotta go have fun goes up
07:52 - and then our school bus
07:54 - leaves okay now we're gonna test our um
07:57 - animals here so first we have the monkey
