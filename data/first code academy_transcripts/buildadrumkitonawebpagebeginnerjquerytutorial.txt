00:02 - hello everyone
00:03 - welcome back to our channel here is your
00:05 - big dinner friendly coding tutorials in
00:07 - scratch
00:08 - roblox minecraft programming and many
00:10 - more
00:11 - so today we are going to create a
00:12 - keyboard drum set with jquery
00:15 - well in this project you can see that
00:17 - we're using
00:19 - the drum set and then there's like a
00:21 - several instructions for how
00:23 - we produce sounds for this drum for
00:26 - example q is for crash
00:27 - so when i press q
00:31 - the sound will produce so before we
00:34 - start i just want to let you know that
00:36 - jquery is the library
00:38 - that's part of the javascript that does
00:40 - everything is reading and drop
00:42 - short form so let's get started
00:45 - so we'll begin by opening up the
00:47 - template of the project
00:48 - as you may notice html and the css
00:53 - so these and these
00:56 - has already been completed for us and
00:58 - some part of the jquery
01:00 - so we don't have to worry about the
01:02 - variables for a different
01:04 - uh sound produce well in this for time
01:08 - we're just going to look at a keyboard
01:09 - event
01:10 - and this will inform us in pressing a
01:12 - button and playing it sound
01:15 - so the first thing we have to do
01:18 - i'm just going to hide my html and css
01:22 - and go back to js so we have the
01:25 - variable
01:26 - and we're going to create some of the
01:29 - constants
01:30 - well we'll be using the contents since
01:32 - the values
01:33 - which is the sound of different keys we
01:35 - remain constant
01:37 - so it would it won't change uh for the
01:40 - sound
01:40 - whenever we press the key button so
01:43 - that's constant
01:44 - so let's do seven of those keys so
01:47 - constant constant
01:52 - q equals to 81 and
01:55 - constant a equals to 65
01:58 - constant s equals 83
02:02 - constant d equals to
02:06 - 68
02:09 - and constant f
02:12 - equals 270
02:16 - and constant t equals to
02:19 - 84 and constant x
02:23 - equals to 88 awesome so now
02:26 - we created all of these constant
02:28 - variables
02:30 - so the way to type it is in javascript
02:32 - where jquery is
02:33 - called constant c-o-n-s-t so this is a
02:37 - way of declaring a constant variable
02:39 - type
02:40 - well type in these seven constants
02:44 - while each constant to have should have
02:46 - a letter corresponding to the front page
02:48 - of the instructions
02:50 - so this number inside of values is the
02:53 - key code we have to add
02:54 - check if you want to find out more of
02:56 - that
02:57 - you can check out on keycode.info to
02:59 - check the corresponding keycode
03:01 - to each letter so all right so moving on
03:05 - we finish our first step and we are
03:08 - going to our second step
03:10 - as you can see that there is like
03:13 - the document.keydown function event so
03:16 - this is the
03:17 - down effect function which will perform
03:20 - some of the
03:21 - functions uh which is produce the sound
03:24 - and some animated effects for our
03:27 - keys so whenever we press the key button
03:29 - it will reduce
03:31 - the sound for the corresponding key and
03:33 - then
03:34 - well there are some other things that we
03:36 - do which is like
03:37 - we will change our title to
03:41 - h3 and we will going to animate
03:44 - the image to reduce the dramatic effect
03:46 - so whenever we press the key button
03:48 - it will pop it will kind of move up and
03:51 - down
03:52 - a little bit or enlarge a little bit
03:55 - so it kind of tells us that this is
03:57 - working
03:58 - like that so we have seven keys
04:01 - um we're going to start by
04:05 - creating the first key which is q
04:08 - so first of all we will
04:13 - start by giving it a condition
04:16 - so if defend which
04:19 - equals to q which means
04:22 - if the key we pressed is actually the
04:26 - key
04:26 - q so the thing we want to do
04:31 - uh we have three things i want to do so
04:33 - the first thing
04:35 - of course playing the sound so crash dot
04:38 - play
04:40 - which is the first function second one
04:43 - is
04:44 - we were going to use jquery so the
04:46 - dollar sign
04:48 - and then we're going to get the element
04:50 - img
04:51 - and dot anyway
04:57 - and we're going to set the width
05:00 - to 3
05:04 - 40 for this one so it kind of changed
05:08 - the width for this
05:15 - all right so we're just going to set the
05:18 - speed of this or the duration of this
05:21 - we're just going to set it to 20 so it's
05:23 - just going to move very quickly
05:25 - and i we are going to animate
05:30 - another width
05:33 - 350
05:43 - [Music]
05:48 - 20 as well so this is the animation for
05:51 - the size
05:52 - of our image the next one we're going to
05:54 - do
05:55 - uh we're just going to set our title to
05:58 - h3
05:59 - as we said before so let's just
06:02 - get the element h3 and then dot html
06:09 - and then crash
06:15 - button pressed
06:19 - so you kind of indicate that oh we
06:22 - press the crush button
06:25 - oh yep
06:28 - all right so this is the keep eq
06:31 - now we can move on to finish the six of
06:35 - them
06:36 - yeah so for
06:41 - the other one
06:46 - which is a
06:51 - we did the condition right now and then
06:53 - we're going to change it to low tom
06:55 - delay and
07:02 - making the elements of the image again
07:04 - we're going to animate it again
07:12 - and then working to 35.
07:16 - oh and then we're going to
07:20 - take it to 20 as well and then animate
07:25 - and factory
07:36 - and 20 again and then the third thing
07:39 - we're going to do is change it to
07:41 - h3 again
07:46 - and then share now
07:54 - low tom
08:03 - as you can see now we finished two of
08:06 - the keys one of
08:07 - them is q and then the second one is
08:09 - eight so as you can see that actually
08:12 - both of them have really really similar
08:14 - codes right
08:15 - so after i will press
08:19 - each of these keys uh it will play some
08:22 - sound
08:23 - and then it will change our image
08:25 - animation
08:26 - and then we're going to change our title
08:30 - h3 title to something pressed
08:33 - so the like which part of the drum
08:37 - is being pressed or being played so
08:41 - okay so the one thing we can actually do
08:44 - uh in this project we can actually
08:47 - copy and paste for
08:54 - three four five six we're going to
08:58 - copy for five more times so
09:01 - so the only thing that is changing
09:02 - actually in this part
09:04 - well i'm just going to underline it with
09:07 - the color
09:08 - pink so the first thing we is
09:11 - different is the queue and then
09:15 - the second thing is play
09:18 - something to something of the elements
09:21 - play
09:22 - and then we're just going to stick with
09:24 - the
09:25 - uh width uh for each of the animation
09:29 - and then the third thing is changing is
09:33 - the low tom and then the crash button
09:36 - which is the
09:37 - h3 of the start of the h2
09:40 - so three of these things only have like
09:43 - only difference from each other so the
09:45 - rest of our
09:46 - key buttons we will just change all of
09:49 - them
09:50 - with their corresponding sound and their
09:53 - corresponding
09:53 - letter so for the third one is actually
09:56 - s
09:57 - so s represents the time
10:00 - so and then i'm just going to change it
10:04 - to mid
10:06 - top okay
10:09 - and then the fourth one is actually d
10:13 - so d represents
10:16 - hi tom
10:19 - and we're going to change the high tom
10:24 - for the next one the f
10:28 - which is
10:31 - snare and then
10:40 - and then the last second last one
10:43 - is t and then which is
10:47 - high hat so changes
10:50 - hi hats
10:56 - and then the last one is x which has
10:59 - the kick
11:07 - and then your shoulders kick drum button
11:09 - first
11:11 - and basically that's it so
11:15 - well after we finish all of these you
11:17 - can actually try it out
11:18 - so we're just going to separate all of
11:21 - this again
11:21 - and then all right
11:24 - so here we go you can see our drum
11:27 - stretch that
11:28 - we're going to try it out again right
11:29 - now
11:31 - okay okay when i press a
11:35 - the low time is pressed and then when i
11:37 - press s
11:39 - the top and then for d high top and then
11:43 - for f
11:44 - snare and then for t i hat
11:48 - and then for x kick drum so that's it
11:51 - so basically that's all the things that
11:53 - we have to do
11:55 - well so that's it for today in this
11:57 - tutorial we created a drum kit with the
11:59 - use of jquery
12:00 - while jquery is a mini library for
12:02 - javascript which allows you to write
12:04 - code but in a more quicker and
12:06 - simplified way
12:07 - so hope you like this video don't forget
