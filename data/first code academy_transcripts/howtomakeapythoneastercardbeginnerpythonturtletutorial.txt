00:00 - hi everyone and welcome back to our
00:01 - channel here we share beginner friendly
00:03 - tutorial videos on scratch roblox
00:05 - minecraft web programming and many more
00:08 - and today we're going to teach you how
00:09 - to draw an easter bunny
00:11 - in python turtle okay so first let's see
00:14 - how the project will look like at the
00:16 - very end this is my code
00:18 - and when you click run the turtle will
00:22 - draw an easter bunny for you so if you
00:25 - enlarge the screen a little bit
00:27 - you'll be able to see the whole
00:30 - bunny all right so let's get coding
00:34 - um you can see that i'm now on the
00:37 - raplet website
00:39 - and this i'm already logged in so if you
00:42 - haven't
00:43 - created an account you can log in with
00:45 - your google account
00:46 - or with your github account or just
00:49 - create a pure
00:50 - replit account and
00:53 - then you'll be taken to a menu like that
00:56 - and
00:57 - in the top left corner you will have an
00:58 - option new new repel
01:00 - which means just a new project
01:03 - so if you click on this there will be
01:06 - different languages to choose
01:08 - and today we're going to use python with
01:10 - turtle
01:12 - so i'm clicking python with turtle and
01:16 - let's give a meaningful name so
01:20 - i'm going to type in it's the bunny
01:25 - and just click create so this will take
01:27 - me to a whole new page
01:31 - with an empty place where i can type
01:34 - code
01:35 - and in the screen of that
01:38 - the result of my code will be visible so
01:40 - whatever i draw with my turtle
01:42 - it will be there first of all i'll
01:45 - import everything from the
01:46 - python turtle library and so that we can
01:49 - use all the custom functions that are
01:51 - there
01:51 - so let's write from
01:55 - turtle import
01:59 - star which means all and this imports
02:01 - all the functions that we
02:03 - need for today's project
02:06 - then let's set up the screen so the
02:08 - initial setup for any project
02:10 - is um creating the screen
02:13 - and for our case let's
02:20 - create the screen and then
02:23 - let's set the color to a certain color
02:26 - that we like
02:27 - and feel free to change any of the
02:29 - colors that i'm using
02:31 - but i'm just going to
02:36 - a background color
02:41 - i'm going to set it to wheat which will
02:44 - be
02:45 - a little bit like beige
02:48 - and then let's create a churchill
02:51 - so my turtle
02:55 - will be a turtle no wonder
02:59 - and secondly my turtle will also have
03:03 - a certain speed for this project because
03:05 - it's quite complicated well we have to
03:08 - draw a lot of shapes we will set the
03:09 - speed to fastest
03:11 - so that
03:16 - it doesn't take too long of time
03:20 - to draw
03:24 - okay so now we have created the screen
03:26 - and now we have also created
03:28 - the turtle
03:32 - the next thing we're going to do is
03:34 - define all the shapes
03:36 - so we're going to use a couple of
03:38 - different shapes we're going to use
03:39 - rectangles
03:40 - circles and arcs and it will be useful
03:43 - to
03:43 - put them all together in a function but
03:46 - before we do that
03:47 - um just a quick reminder if you like
03:49 - this video so far don't forget to
03:51 - subscribe to our channel
03:52 - like this video and check out all the
03:54 - other videos that we have also created
03:59 - all right so shapes
04:03 - let's define a function called
04:06 - my rectangle
04:18 - and it will have a couple of parameters
04:20 - um
04:21 - that we will be able to set each time we
04:25 - call the function later on in the code
04:31 - the t is going to be our turtle so
04:34 - even though it doesn't seem like a
04:36 - turtle yet we will use it like a turtle
04:40 - so first of all
04:43 - let's have an indentation and let's
04:45 - write
04:47 - d dot pin up
04:50 - and t dot
04:53 - color c this means
04:57 - we don't we are not drawing anything and
04:59 - we set the color to the correct one
05:02 - then
05:06 - we set the heading to zero which is the
05:09 - alignment so
05:10 - it will be facing in exactly the same
05:12 - direction at the beginning
05:14 - because sometimes we might we might
05:16 - change the heading later on and then we
05:18 - don't want to end up with a rectangular
05:19 - just like diagonally so
05:25 - we set the heading to zero and then we
05:27 - go to the right position so
05:29 - position x and position y
05:32 - this will be the starting position then
05:35 - we start drawing because we're already
05:38 - set up
05:42 - and to fill in different shapes we use
05:46 - the functions begin
05:47 - fill and enfield so before actually
05:50 - starting to draw
05:51 - let's use the function begin fill
05:57 - and this will start drawing the
06:00 - the shape that we want to have and start
06:03 - filling it in with a with a column
06:06 - then
06:11 - in the loop but a very short look
06:13 - because only twice
06:15 - we will go
06:18 - forward
06:24 - except and then right
06:29 - and then again forward
06:35 - and then again right theoretically i'm
06:38 - left with do as well
06:39 - it's just a matter of naming your
06:41 - variables and selecting which one is
06:43 - drawn first
06:44 - all right and we already have our
06:46 - rectangle we already have all the
06:49 - colors and speeds set up so the only
06:52 - thing we need to do
06:53 - is go out of the loop
06:56 - and end the filling
07:00 - so that was one tablet we're going to
07:03 - use a rectangle now let's do the circle
07:06 - so for the circle let's also
07:10 - define a my circle function
07:16 - this time with a circle position x
07:19 - position
07:20 - y um the radius
07:23 - and the color so circle
07:27 - does not have an x and y side it only
07:30 - has a radius
07:33 - and this is going to be very similar
07:37 - so actually we don't want to
07:40 - type that in again let's select all of
07:43 - this
07:44 - and paste it here
07:48 - remember to adjust the indentation so
07:50 - that
07:52 - um the indentation is correct so we have
07:54 - one indent from
07:55 - the def keyword
07:58 - and then after setting everything up
08:01 - let's do the circle
08:02 - however there is also a method
08:06 - called circle in the python turtle
08:08 - library
08:09 - so we just type in
08:13 - t circle r there is no need to do a loop
08:16 - because a
08:18 - function that draws the circle already
08:20 - exists and we only need to
08:22 - draw the circle once
08:26 - so we draw a circle and then we end
08:29 - fill
08:33 - all right so the last function that
08:35 - we're going to create um
08:37 - is a function called my arc
08:44 - and we will use quite similar arguments
08:47 - for those
08:48 - so my arc will have a turtle up position
08:51 - x
08:51 - position y and then
08:54 - a radius and an additional angle
08:58 - and a heading
09:02 - and then we will have the color so for
09:08 - this
09:10 - we will make it um very similar to the
09:13 - circle because
09:15 - there is a function that enables us to
09:18 - draw an arc based on the angle that we
09:21 - want to have
09:22 - so the angle that we want to cover and
09:24 - the radius of the circle already in
09:26 - python turtle
09:27 - so we can copy the whole my circle
09:29 - method
09:32 - but we need to be mindful because while
09:35 - pinup collar
09:36 - are the same the set heading
09:39 - will be set to a custom heading
09:43 - so this time we will have diff
09:46 - we can change the heading each time we
09:48 - use the function
09:50 - and then we go to the next position we
09:53 - start drawing begin filling it in and
09:58 - there is a way to draw an arc using the
10:00 - circle method
10:01 - the only thing you need to do is inside
10:04 - the
10:05 - the brackets you enter another argument
10:07 - which is
10:09 - r and angle
10:13 - yep and the arc function should already
10:17 - be done
10:18 - all right so these functions have
10:20 - already been created
10:22 - and all the help functions are ready
10:25 - now is the time to start drawing our
10:30 - bunny
10:32 - so let's start from the left ear
10:44 - the ear will be a rectangle
10:53 - and let's pass all the arguments now
10:57 - the turtle that we have created is
10:58 - called my turtle
11:01 - and then there will be a couple of
11:03 - numbers that
11:04 - um correspond to the right positions
11:08 - of every
11:11 - of every element of the bunny
11:21 - okay
11:26 - and then a circle
11:31 - so this will make the bunny ears look
11:34 - like that
11:35 - so there will be a rectangle and then a
11:37 - circle on the top
11:39 - which means um actually we will
11:42 - see it as a long ear with a semicircle
11:47 - so we also pass my turtle then
11:50 - minus 2 to 5 25
11:54 - 25 and silver
11:58 - so because it's the same color you want
12:00 - to see the edges
12:05 - and then we can theoretically also copy
12:08 - and paste those and
12:09 - change a couple of numbers so for this
12:13 - instead of 50 we'll do minus 240
12:18 - and then 50 30.
12:25 - 90 and instead of silver
12:29 - we will do hot thing
12:34 - then here
12:38 - in minus 225 stays the same
12:41 - and then 35 and
12:45 - 15.
12:48 - and we change the color to hot pink as
12:51 - well
12:52 - uh pink
12:55 - all right and this means that the ears
12:58 - will have
12:59 - um another shape inside so the ear will
13:02 - be like that and then there will be
13:04 - additional
13:05 - narrower shape inside so just like in
13:08 - normal bunny ears and
13:10 - they are different so they have a
13:12 - different color on the inside
13:15 - all right so this is the left ear now as
13:17 - you can imagine
13:18 - the right ear will probably be quite
13:20 - similar
13:23 - but with a couple of positions changed
13:27 - so let's actually copy everything and
13:31 - write right here
13:35 - and in the first line change the x
13:37 - position
13:38 - to minus 180 minus
13:42 - 180 that's 280 yeah
13:45 - minus 180 and the rest stays the same
13:49 - then instead of minus 225
13:52 - we will change it by
13:56 - 70 again so everything is shifted by 70
13:59 - as you can see
14:01 - so it will be minus 155
14:05 - 25 and 25 and then
14:08 - we do minus 70
14:11 - and then we do again minus 155
14:17 - all right so this should be
14:20 - it for the ears now we need to
14:24 - create the head and the body so for the
14:27 - head and the body
14:29 - it will be rather circular
14:32 - because the head is quite similar to a
14:35 - circle
14:36 - um and the body will be similar to a
14:38 - circle as well in our case
14:40 - so um let's write comments saying
14:44 - head and body so that we know what we're
14:48 - doing
14:48 - but you don't need to write the comments
14:51 - and then let's create my circle
14:53 - with my turtle and
14:57 - minus 190 minus 220
15:02 - 100 and the color will be silver
15:12 - okay and
15:16 - let's copy it two times so that we can
15:19 - have three different lines here
15:22 - and in the second line
15:25 - change the second number
15:28 - to minus 5 500
15:32 - and the last number to 150
15:37 - and then you have minus 190
15:42 - second number changed to
15:45 - minus 450 and
15:48 - a hundred
15:51 - and hot pink so this will be the inside
15:55 - of the belly
15:56 - kind of the inner side
16:01 - um all right so these three circles will
16:05 - serve as
16:06 - the head and the body and the next thing
16:09 - will be to create the eyes so let's
16:11 - think of how to create the eyes
16:13 - and as you can imagine eyes will not be
16:16 - rectangles ielts will be
16:17 - circles as well so let's write hashtag
16:22 - eyes my circle
16:29 - and the turtle we'll be drawing it
16:33 - and these are the numbers so minus 215
16:38 - minus 110 and 10
16:42 - and the color will be navy but of course
16:44 - you're
16:45 - happy to you're free to
16:48 - paint it and
16:53 - again copy and paste that and
16:56 - you can think for a second whether we
16:58 - should change the x coordinate or the y
17:01 - coordinate
17:02 - so a tip is that if you have an eye
17:07 - you usually have an eye next to it next
17:09 - to the the other eye
17:11 - so the position of the eye is changed
17:15 - horizontally
17:16 - this means again we only need to change
17:18 - the position of
17:19 - x so instead of minus
17:22 - 215 we will have minus 165
17:30 - and this should be it for the eyes
17:35 - so again there is a lot of
17:38 - things on a bunny's face and another
17:41 - thing that we're going to create is the
17:42 - nose
17:43 - the nose actually will be a little bit
17:47 - complicated
17:48 - um not because it's more complicated
17:50 - than that but because we
17:52 - it's going to be um three lines so it's
17:55 - going to consist of three lines
17:57 - uh we don't have a custom function that
17:59 - creates three lines so we need to
18:01 - write everything from scratch again so
18:05 - let's write notes later on you can make
18:09 - that into a function but we will not
18:10 - reuse it we will just use it once here
18:13 - so there is really no point to make that
18:15 - a separate function um and
18:19 - similarly to the beginning in the custom
18:22 - functions we will use
18:23 - a similar technique to create the nodes
18:26 - and to set up
18:26 - the positions for the notes so first of
18:30 - all
18:30 - do my turtle dot pen up
18:36 - second of all my turtle dot go to
18:41 - minus 200 and minus 130
18:46 - and then my turtle
18:50 - dot color hot pink
19:00 - then we put the pen down back again
19:09 - and begin filling
19:22 - and then we drove the three lines that
19:24 - i've talked about earlier so
19:26 - the first one will be this
19:31 - that's minus 130 so minus 180 and minus
19:36 - 130.
19:38 - and then
19:43 - we will do minus 190 and
19:47 - minus 150
19:55 - right churchill dot go to
19:59 - minus 200 and
20:02 - minus 130. so actually
20:05 - these will not be three lines this will
20:07 - be three points
20:08 - uh between which we will draw two
20:11 - different lines
20:12 - so this will be like a typical nose
20:16 - from a cartoon or something so
20:19 - the last thing probably that we have
20:21 - left is the mouth
20:23 - um when it comes to the the bunny's face
20:26 - so the mouth that is going to be very
20:30 - very easy
20:32 - that's right hashtag mouth
20:36 - and you can think of what
20:40 - is a mouth so how does a mouth look like
20:43 - when
20:43 - you're drawing a cartoon or just
20:46 - painting by yourself
20:47 - but a mouth is usually something like
20:49 - this so it's usually an arc
20:51 - um but it's it's upside when it's when
20:54 - somebody's happy
20:56 - it's um the other way around and
20:58 - somebody's sad
20:59 - but it's usually a part of a circle so
21:02 - in this case it's going to be a part of
21:03 - a circle as well
21:05 - so my arc
21:10 - my turtle and minus
21:13 - 190 minus 150
21:17 - 20 150
21:21 - minus 90. and there's a lot of numbers
21:25 - but you can just safely copy them
21:27 - and then also hot
21:31 - pink
21:38 - and let's copy and paste that and change
21:41 - things a little bit so this will be
21:44 - this will be unchanged this will be
21:45 - unchanged let's change the 20
21:48 - to -20 and
21:51 - leave everything else
21:55 - so these two arcs will be for
21:58 - the mouth of the bunny and
22:01 - now let's try to write the easter wishes
22:06 - so let's
22:09 - have a comment that
22:13 - says text and then my turtle
22:17 - dot up because we need to leave the
22:20 - place where we
22:21 - uh while we are drawing and go up
22:25 - so we'll change the position without
22:27 - drawing anything
22:30 - 200 and 200
22:37 - set the color to navy that's at least in
22:40 - my design
22:42 - and then
22:46 - hand down which means start drawing
22:50 - and then there is a special function
22:52 - called write
22:59 - and the first line will just say happy
23:02 - because
23:02 - happy and easier so first we will do
23:05 - happy then align
23:09 - option will be equal to center
23:14 - and the font will be equal to open
23:17 - bracket close bracket
23:19 - um impact that's the name of the font
23:23 - i'll remember to make it capitalize
23:26 - and then in the inner brackets you still
23:29 - write a hundred and bold because these
23:33 - are all information concerning the type
23:35 - of font that we used
23:38 - and then
23:43 - let's copy the go to line
23:57 - and this time let's go to 100 and 100
24:01 - so a little bit lower and
24:05 - my turtle
24:08 - dot pen down
24:16 - and again we can copy the
24:19 - right line this time because we need to
24:21 - write easier this time
24:23 - so this will also use the same font and
24:26 - the same function
24:27 - just we just need to write easter
24:31 - instead of happy and if we want the e
24:35 - string to be a little bit larger we can
24:36 - even make
24:37 - um the 100 into a 110
24:40 - so that it's slightly larger but feel
24:43 - free to change it
24:46 - okay so the last thing is
24:50 - hiding the turtle because we don't want
24:52 - the turtle to stay on our
24:54 - easter card especially if you want to
24:56 - send it to somebody
24:58 - but if you like turtles on easter cards
25:01 - you also have you're also free to
25:03 - um leave it there
25:12 - and there's a method for that called
25:14 - height turtle so if we hide the turtle
25:16 - we just need to write the name of the
25:18 - turtle.height turtle and
25:21 - it will hide itself all right so right
25:24 - now
25:25 - let's see how it actually looks like so
25:27 - if we run it
25:35 - you will see a bunny here and the most
25:38 - the mouth looks a little bit funny um
25:41 - but
25:42 - the body is a circle and it has the
25:44 - right ears
25:46 - and there is also a happy easter
25:49 - sign at the very top and if you make the
25:52 - screen bigger you can see everything
25:54 - at the same time so
25:57 - this is for you to adjust okay
26:00 - that would be it for today thank you
26:02 - very much for staying with us and don't
26:04 - forget to subscribe and like this video
26:07 - you can also check out all the other
26:09 - videos that we have done
26:10 - while you're waiting for the next one to
