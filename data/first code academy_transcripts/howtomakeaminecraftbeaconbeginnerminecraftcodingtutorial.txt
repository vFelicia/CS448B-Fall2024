00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to our
00:02 - channel
00:03 - here we share beginner friendly coding
00:05 - tutorials on scratch
00:07 - roblox minecraft web programming and
00:09 - many more
00:10 - today we are going to create a minecraft
00:12 - beacon
00:14 - in this project we are going to create a
00:16 - minecraft weekend utilizing the learning
00:18 - mode
00:18 - engine which uses blog based coding
00:23 - the concepts covered in this tutorial
00:25 - would be functions
00:26 - drones loops variables and designing
00:30 - so let's get started all right
00:33 - so i have opened up my led to mod
00:35 - account
00:36 - so next i'm going to head to the play
00:39 - option
00:40 - and click on mods to create a custom
00:44 - mod so
00:47 - i'm going to give a name for my mod so
00:50 - since i'm going to make a bacon i'm
00:52 - going to rename my mod
00:54 - as beacon
00:59 - next i'm going to choose on the language
01:02 - as to blocky multiplayer
01:07 - so once it's been created i'm going to
01:09 - click on see inside
01:13 - and click on the option of code
01:18 - so this will open up the code editor
01:21 - so on the left hand side you can find
01:24 - the library of
01:25 - code which you can find all the
01:27 - necessary
01:28 - code blocks that you need to make your
01:30 - mod
01:32 - all right to start with coding i'm going
01:35 - to prepare two functions
01:37 - i'm going to click on functions and drag
01:41 - to function code block
01:45 - so i'm going to rename one function as
01:47 - main
01:50 - and the other function to be call beacon
01:54 - stage
02:00 - all right the function beacon stage is
02:02 - used to store
02:03 - our instructions that would require to
02:06 - build the
02:07 - and the function main is used to call
02:10 - our function
02:11 - beacon stage when the mod is used in a
02:15 - microphone
02:18 - all right so first i'm going to start
02:20 - off with the beacon stage
02:22 - so i'm going to add an input for this
02:24 - beacon which is going to be the side
02:27 - length
02:28 - i'm going to click on this key icon and
02:31 - drag in
02:31 - an input name block
02:36 - and i'm going to rename this to be
02:40 - side
02:43 - left and then i'm going to click
02:47 - on back the gear icon so this input
02:50 - would be
02:50 - specifically used to specify the side
02:54 - of our beacon stage so you
02:57 - later on during the game we can mention
03:00 - what's the size of your amount to create
03:03 - different
03:04 - size speaker so in the micro field we
03:07 - are going to use
03:08 - a drone to build any structures so
03:11 - drones
03:12 - are kind of like our eyes that would
03:14 - help us to place our objects on the
03:18 - minecraft world
03:19 - so on the function main i'm going to set
03:22 - up my drone
03:24 - so i'm going to click on variables
03:28 - and i'm going to make a variable
03:32 - so i'm going to rename this variable as
03:36 - d which stands for draw
03:41 - next i'm going to click on the minecraft
03:44 - tab and click on drone and drag in the
03:48 - block call
03:49 - new drone okay
03:52 - now i'm going to go back to my function
03:55 - beacon stage
03:56 - to build one line of diamond blocks
04:00 - so to build one line of diamond blocks i
04:03 - need to
04:04 - place one block and then move my drone
04:07 - to the
04:08 - right side and then i'm going to keep on
04:11 - repeating
04:13 - according to the number that is given on
04:15 - this input
04:17 - so in order to do that i'm going to use
04:19 - a loop
04:21 - so i'm going to click on the loops
04:23 - option and drag
04:25 - repeat 10 times block
04:28 - so since i do not know what's the value
04:31 - of
04:31 - my length of my beacon is going to be
04:36 - i'm going to remove my number block in
04:39 - the loop
04:42 - and i'm going to drag
04:46 - the variable of sideline or the input
04:50 - i'm going to variables
04:54 - and i'm going to drag side length option
04:58 - all right next i'm going to use a drone
05:00 - to place my blocks
05:02 - so i'm going to the option of drone
05:06 - and drag in the block called drone d
05:09 - place blocks of type
05:12 - so my minecraft would be built from
05:15 - diamond block
05:17 - so i'm going to materials
05:20 - and i'm going to drag the block of
05:23 - diamond so you can choose any materials
05:28 - to
05:28 - you want to build your own custom beacon
05:33 - so once i have placed my diamond block i
05:36 - need to move my
05:39 - drone to the right hand side so what i'm
05:42 - going to do is
05:43 - i'm going to drag the block call
05:46 - move drone in direction up
05:49 - distance 1 and i'm going to change the
05:52 - direction to be
05:54 - right so this means that
05:58 - the diamond block is placed
06:03 - like this and my camera
06:07 - shifts to the right side
06:11 - of a distance of one block and then it's
06:14 - going to keep on repeating adding blocks
06:18 - diamond block specifically and creating
06:21 - one line
06:22 - of diamond blocks according to the value
06:25 - that is given
06:26 - in this variable
06:30 - like that
06:35 - okay next i'm going to move to the next
06:38 - line so let's say i have
06:42 - created a line off
06:49 - five diamond blocks like this
06:53 - so right now my camera or my drone would
06:56 - be
06:56 - on this position
06:59 - so in order to create on more lines or
07:03 - start placing my blocks so i need to
07:07 - make my camera
07:09 - to go back to its original position
07:12 - so that means i need to move my camera
07:14 - towards the left hand side
07:17 - in a distance of the side length
07:23 - i'm going to click on the drone option
07:26 - and i'm going to click on move drone
07:30 - in direction up distance 1.
07:33 - so this block and this block is pretty
07:35 - much the same
07:36 - but here is a fixed number of the
07:39 - distance but
07:41 - here i'm going to use a variable
07:44 - so since i'm going to use a variable i
07:47 - need to use
07:48 - this code block to move my
07:52 - draw so i'm going to drag this flag
07:55 - and put it down
07:58 - this so this is to
08:02 - uh make one line of diamond blocks
08:06 - and this is to make the next line
08:11 - so i need to move back my camera
08:15 - so that is in a distance up the sideline
08:23 - and the direction is black
08:27 - so once i have created my
08:31 - one line of damage blocks and
08:34 - right now my camera is here
08:38 - so next i need to make my camera to go
08:42 - in the forward drive so that it starts
08:45 - to create
08:48 - on the other side of my beacon
08:52 - so next i need to tell my drone to move
08:55 - forward in the direct
08:57 - in the distance of one block
09:01 - so i'm going to drone and drag in the
09:04 - block card
09:05 - move direction and i'm going to change
09:09 - the distance to be forward
09:12 - and the value is going to be one okay so
09:15 - i need to repeat
09:16 - this whole instructions
09:21 - to build a square
09:24 - so once i have created one side
09:28 - like that i
09:31 - made my drone to come this way again
09:36 - and now it's going
09:39 - this side okay
09:43 - now i need to create i need to use this
09:46 - one to create
09:47 - a square so that it's going to cover one
09:51 - stage of my beacon
09:54 - so i'm going to repeat
09:57 - all these instructions again
10:00 - according to the number that is given on
10:03 - my sideline
10:05 - so i'm going to drag a loop block
10:09 - a repeat block again put this code
10:13 - inside
10:16 - and then put it inside the function
10:19 - and i'm going to change the number of
10:23 - the repetition
10:24 - which is going to be the value inside
10:27 - the side variable okay
10:31 - so once it created one square stage it
10:34 - should come back
10:35 - to its original position or to its
10:38 - starting position
10:39 - so i'm going to click on
10:43 - drone and make my drone to come
10:46 - backwards which is going to be out of
10:49 - this repetition block
10:52 - and it should come back
10:58 - in a distance of the side plane
11:06 - okay now this is one layer
11:09 - so i need to go to the next layer
11:13 - so it's like
11:16 - i have one layer like that
11:20 - so i need to move my camera
11:25 - one layer to the top so it's going to
11:27 - create another layer like this
11:33 - so i'm going to move my camera
11:40 - so up one distance
11:44 - right a distance
11:48 - and then make sure that it's in the
11:50 - forward direction
11:51 - also okay
11:55 - now in a beacon so as you go
11:59 - on the layers the size
12:02 - of the layers is going to get reduced
12:05 - which is going to be like a recursion
12:08 - function
12:10 - so i have one
12:13 - layer like this so the next layer would
12:17 - be
12:17 - smaller than the previous layer
12:21 - and it's going to keep on repeating
12:25 - until i have only one block
12:28 - left on the top all right so i'm going
12:31 - to repeat the same function
12:33 - beacon stage with the value of the side
12:37 - line
12:38 - that is going to be reduced by two
12:42 - so that if i have one layer like this
12:47 - two blocks would be removed in the next
12:50 - layer
12:52 - and creating it like this so it's going
12:54 - to keep on repeating so it's going to
12:56 - remove two blocks
12:58 - and then that would be the size of the
13:00 - next layer
13:02 - and keep on repeating like that in every
13:06 - stage i just need to remove
13:09 - um two from the current value in the
13:13 - site none
13:15 - so i'll just go to functions and drag
13:19 - the call function block called beacon
13:22 - stage
13:24 - and i need to subtract 2
13:29 - so math
13:34 - minus
13:40 - side length
13:47 - minus two all right
13:50 - so next i need to use an if statement to
13:53 - check
13:54 - if or when i'm going to end so i need to
13:58 - end
13:58 - building each layer once the side length
14:02 - is equal to one so
14:06 - i'm going to drag
14:09 - i'm going to logic and drag it to block
14:13 - and put it on top
14:16 - and next i'm going to drag an else block
14:20 - and put it inside here so
14:23 - my condition is
14:27 - if the side length is greater than one
14:30 - it's going to repeat this
14:34 - instructions and if the side length
14:37 - becomes less than one or equals to one
14:40 - so it's going to place a beacon on top
14:43 - of all
14:44 - those diamond layers
14:47 - so i'm going to set up my condition
14:52 - so if
15:00 - the side length is greater than
15:07 - 1 then i'm going to run all this
15:10 - function creating layers
15:15 - if it is if the side length is equal is
15:18 - less than one
15:20 - i'm going to place a beacon with the
15:22 - help of
15:23 - a drone
15:26 - so i'm going to materials and drag
15:29 - in a beaker
15:36 - okay and also now we have to make sure
15:39 - that
15:40 - the size the value that the person
15:44 - enters on the side is not going to be
15:48 - an even number so we
15:51 - need to give another if statement to run
15:54 - this
15:55 - code for this instructions only when the
15:58 - valid
15:59 - that a person enters into the cycle is
16:02 - going to be an
16:03 - odd number so i'm going to drag
16:07 - in an f2 block put it on top
16:13 - and my condition is
16:16 - if the side length value is hot
16:20 - so i'm going to math and drag in
16:25 - blank is even make it
16:28 - odd and
16:30 - [Music]
16:32 - what's going to be odd is the value of
16:34 - the sideline
16:36 - and if it is yes then it's going to run
16:41 - this instructions
16:45 - all right so we have done the function
16:48 - for the beacon stage now
16:50 - i need to run this function when i
16:53 - use my mod so i'm going to call the
16:56 - beacon function
16:57 - when the function main is run
17:01 - so i'm going to function and drag in the
17:03 - beacon stage
17:06 - so here i can input the value of
17:10 - my sideline so i'm going to keep it nine
17:14 - so if you want a bigger beacon
17:17 - make sure you enter a bigger number
17:20 - but it should be an odd number not an
17:23 - even number
17:26 - so i'm going to start with nine all
17:29 - right so this is the finished chord
17:30 - blocks for my beacon
17:32 - so to try out my code on my micro fold
17:36 - i'm going to click on
17:38 - mod
17:42 - and it will say that it's done
17:46 - so next i have to open up my minecraft
17:48 - file
17:49 - and then make sure that you have
17:51 - connected the server
17:53 - and then run it on your microphone
17:57 - right so i have opened up my minecraft
18:00 - launcher so
18:04 - once i clicked on the mod on my editor
18:08 - as you can see i have my church box so
18:11 - when i click it
18:12 - my beacon is loaded here so i'm going to
18:15 - drag this
18:16 - book and place it down on my inventory
18:22 - next i'm going to find a flat brown like
18:26 - this
18:30 - and make sure the game mode is on
18:33 - the rifle
18:41 - and i'm going to make sure that my
18:44 - mod is on my hand and i'm going to click
18:47 - on
18:49 - as you can see here it's starting to
18:51 - build my beaker
18:56 - so the first side is nine blocks
19:00 - long so it's going to keep on building
19:07 - now i have my frequency up
19:14 - so that's all for today i hope you
19:16 - enjoyed this project
