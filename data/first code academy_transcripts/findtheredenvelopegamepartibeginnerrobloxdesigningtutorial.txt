00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to our
00:02 - channel here we share beginner friendly
00:04 - tutorial videos on scratch roblox
00:07 - minecraft web programming and many more
00:09 - and today we're going to create a roblox
00:12 - treasure hunt game
00:14 - so in this project we will be creating a
00:16 - roblox treasure hunt game called red
00:18 - envelope hunt quest
00:20 - and the idea of the project is that the
00:22 - players have to find 10 rep
00:24 - envelopes within 5 minutes and these red
00:27 - envelopes are hidden inside the
00:28 - buildings that we're going to
00:30 - add to our game and this tutorial is in
00:33 - two parts the first part of the tutorial
00:35 - would be game scene design
00:37 - in which i will teach you how to create
00:38 - the game using roblox studio
00:41 - and in the second part i'll be teaching
00:43 - you how to code the project using code
00:45 - kingdoms
00:45 - so let's get started
00:49 - all right so let's go ahead and create
00:51 - our game scene so first i'm going to
00:53 - code
00:54 - kingdoms to create a custom project and
00:57 - i'm going to rename the project
00:59 - as red envelope
01:04 - quest and i am also going to select it
01:07 - as a base plate
01:08 - all right and we can go ahead and click
01:10 - start
01:12 - okay then i'm going to go ahead
01:15 - and add a new file called red envelope
01:18 - which is an
01:19 - object and i'm going to add it as a
01:21 - local behavior
01:22 - all right so add red envelope
01:27 - okay object and local behavior
01:30 - and go ahead and add it
01:33 - then all right after we have created our
01:36 - project we want to
01:37 - download it and open it in roblox studio
01:43 - all right okay now that we have the
01:45 - project downloaded into roblox studio
01:48 - the next thing we want to do is we want
01:49 - to create a ground so we want to choose
01:52 - part right here okay and we want
01:56 - to change the material to be concrete
02:00 - all right concrete and we want to change
02:03 - the color to either black or gray
02:05 - to give sort of the natural effect of a
02:08 - road
02:09 - and then we're going to stretch it using
02:10 - the scale tool right here
02:12 - okay to make it cover the base plate and
02:15 - then we also want to anchor it
02:17 - okay so i'm going to scale it right now
02:56 - all right now the next thing i'm going
02:58 - to do is i'm going to use the toolbox
03:00 - function right here
03:01 - all right to add buildings into my city
03:04 - now you can choose any buildings that
03:06 - you like but make sure that you can open
03:08 - them and go inside as some
03:10 - model buildings are you can find in the
03:13 - toolbox do not allow your characters to
03:15 - go inside
03:16 - all right
03:21 - so i'm gonna go ahead and add in a
03:23 - coffee shop
03:30 - okay and then i'm gonna go ahead and add
03:33 - it right here
03:35 - okay and i also want to rotate it
03:39 - like so okay and then i'm gonna go ahead
03:42 - and add in a domino's pizza okay so
03:46 - domino's pizza
04:00 - all right so i have my domino's pizza
04:02 - right here i will put it
04:04 - in front of the coffee shop
04:08 - all right and then i want to go ahead
04:11 - and add a bakery as well
04:14 - so i'm gonna switch that up right here
04:22 - okay all right let me place it
04:26 - right next to the coffee shop
04:29 - okay
04:33 - and then i'm going to add in a library
04:43 - okay let's place that
04:49 - okay right next to the bakery
04:52 - let's go ahead and also rotate it
05:00 - alright then i want to go and add a shop
05:14 - all right and the last thing i'm going
05:15 - to add after the shop
05:17 - is a shopping center i'm going to go
05:20 - ahead and add this one right here
05:24 - okay and we'll place it in the space we
05:27 - have
05:28 - around there okay
05:31 - now the next thing we want to do is we
05:33 - want to add a spawn location in the
05:35 - middle of the city so that we can
05:37 - easily access or move around okay so
05:40 - we'll get a spawning point
05:48 - okay and we want to place it in the
05:50 - middle
05:52 - of the city sits right around there
05:56 - okay all right now that we have the
05:59 - spawn place
06:00 - okay we will be making the red envelopes
06:02 - or your treasures
06:04 - so what we want to do is we want to
06:06 - choose part okay so let's close up the
06:08 - toolbox
06:09 - we want to choose part a right there
06:19 - and we want to go ahead and change the
06:21 - material to the plastic
06:24 - all right and the color to red
06:28 - okay right here and we're going to read
06:31 - rename this part as red
06:33 - envelope okay and in this part we also
06:36 - want to add some sparkles
06:38 - so first of all let's go ahead and
06:40 - rename them
06:42 - okay rename them
06:47 - to red envelope
06:54 - all right then let's add some sparkle
06:58 - all right so let's sparkle
07:01 - okay and just click on that and then we
07:03 - have it
07:04 - okay so now we're going to create 10 of
07:07 - these envelopes so we need to
07:08 - duplicate them and we can use this
07:11 - component right here to duplicate it
07:14 - all right so we'll go ahead duplicate
07:19 - duplicate until we have 10 of them
07:23 - all right so i'm at my 10th one so right
07:25 - click duplicate
07:26 - now we have 10 of them right so if we
07:29 - move them out we have
07:30 - three four
07:32 - [Music]
07:34 - five six seven
07:37 - eight nine and ten
07:40 - okay all right now the next thing we
07:43 - want to do is
07:44 - by using the move tool okay in our home
07:47 - we can place the red envelopes inside
07:49 - the buildings now we can make them
07:50 - difficult to find by placing them
07:52 - in places which are hard to find like
07:54 - under a chair
07:55 - or in a faraway room okay and some
07:59 - buildings can also have one envelope or
08:01 - two envelopes and some will have even
08:03 - more
08:03 - all right let's go ahead and do that
08:53 - all right i've hidden all my 10
08:54 - envelopes for example
08:56 - i have hidden one here in the library in
08:58 - the second floor
09:00 - so the players would have to climb up
09:02 - this stair right here to be able to
09:03 - reach it
09:05 - okay so now we are going to create the
09:08 - time
09:09 - so to do that we need to create a
09:10 - countdown timer
09:12 - and we're going to add a screen gui gui
09:14 - stands for
09:15 - graphical user interface and it's used
09:17 - to display information
09:19 - about the game such as time in this case
09:21 - to the player
09:22 - okay so the way to do that is we go to
09:24 - view click on explorer
09:27 - all right and we want to scroll down and
09:29 - find screen gui
09:31 - i have one right here let me delete it
09:32 - first yeah we want to find
09:35 - our starter gui sorry and we want to
09:38 - click on this plus sign
09:39 - and insert screen gui all right
09:43 - now we want to click on screen gui and
09:45 - then
09:46 - click this plus sign and add in a text
09:49 - label
09:50 - all right so it's right here now to make
09:53 - this text label
09:54 - bigger we can click right and then it's
09:57 - going to highlight
09:58 - the text label component all right and
10:01 - we can go to view
10:03 - and open properties and in the
10:05 - properties we're going to scroll down to
10:07 - the text
10:09 - section okay right here
10:12 - and in the text part okay so first of
10:14 - all let's change the text inside
10:17 - we'll make it count down
10:20 - timer okay and this part
10:24 - next part is we're going to increase the
10:25 - text size so we can put in 30 for
10:30 - example
10:32 - right so after we put in 30 now you can
10:33 - see our countdown timer
10:35 - the text is much bigger now the next
10:38 - thing we want to do is we want to go
10:39 - back to our text label so i'm just going
10:41 - to
10:41 - close that all right and we want to
10:43 - insert a script so we can click
10:46 - right and then we can go ahead and click
10:49 - on script
10:50 - okay so let's delete print hello world
10:53 - for now
10:54 - okay and what we want to do is we want
10:57 - to
10:58 - code the timer and the timer is going to
11:00 - start at
11:01 - 300 so five minutes in seconds all right
11:05 - and then it ends at minus one negative
11:08 - one
11:08 - and since the loop will minus one each
11:10 - time it will create the effect that
11:12 - there is a countdown
11:14 - okay so the way you do that is start
11:16 - with the loop while true
11:17 - do or i equals 300
11:21 - beginning right 300 seconds
11:30 - okay wait one it's just a buffer time
11:35 - and then script dot
11:38 - script dot parent dot text
11:42 - okay we'll make it equal to countdown
11:51 - i and it will say if script dot
11:54 - parent dot text equals to
11:59 - count down
12:02 - negative one then
12:06 - script dot
12:12 - parent destroy
12:20 - like so
12:23 - all right so after we have added the
12:25 - script right here then we have completed
12:28 - our
12:28 - game scene and you can now test the game
12:31 - to see if you can move
12:32 - around and inside and out of the
12:34 - building to find the envelopes
12:36 - and you would notice that the time's
12:38 - also running on the screen
12:42 - all right so now i'm gonna test if our
12:44 - countdown timer is working
12:45 - i'm gonna go ahead and click play
12:53 - all right so as you can see now the
12:55 - timer is
12:56 - counting down and let's try
13:00 - to go inside the library
13:04 - okay which is right here
13:13 - all right
13:16 - all right so here i can go ahead and
13:18 - grab
13:20 - our red envelope right here
13:24 - so that's all for today in the next
13:26 - tutorial we'll learn how to code the
13:28 - game by adding a score system to the
13:30 - game to count how many red envelopes
13:32 - have been found
13:33 - and make sure to subscribe to our
