00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back to our
00:01 - channel here we share beginner friendly
00:03 - coding tutorials on scratch
00:05 - roblox minecraft web programming and
00:08 - many more
00:09 - today we're going to create a movie
00:11 - slider webpage
00:12 - here's a preview to the project we'll be
00:14 - making today
00:16 - at the top left we have the name of our
00:18 - website
00:20 - on the right we have our navigation bar
00:22 - as you can see we have
00:23 - list categories series anime and search
00:27 - and here we have the main project where
00:30 - we have a slider
00:32 - that shifts our movie pictures and
00:34 - whenever we hover over one of the
00:36 - pictures it tells us a title
00:38 - um some description and a watch button
00:42 - so let's get started so for this project
00:44 - we have provided a template for you to
00:46 - follow along
00:47 - here in templates we have our basic logo
00:51 - where you can insert a picture for your
00:54 - movie slider if you want
00:56 - and the name of our project followed
00:59 - by a navigation bar containing start
01:03 - categories list
01:07 - series anime and the search
01:10 - and you can see it over here these are
01:13 - the items
01:14 - in our list and this will make up our
01:16 - navigation bar
01:18 - so to start out with let's insert some
01:20 - links inside of our categories
01:23 - so we can add any categories as long as
01:26 - they're inside of this
01:28 - link so we can just insert anything in
01:31 - here
01:31 - and we can also include the link when we
01:34 - do have it
01:36 - so here i've gone ahead and installed
01:39 - and inserted all the categories for this
01:41 - project
01:42 - so here as you can see i've added
01:44 - animations
01:45 - actions and all of these categories
01:48 - inside of our links and you can see it
01:51 - under here as well in our project
01:53 - preview
01:54 - so now let's go down to our list and add
01:57 - our list
01:59 - here we want to add movie list
02:06 - series list
02:10 - and animate list and that will be all
02:12 - the list
02:13 - inside of our list and as you can see
02:15 - again we have everything here
02:19 - and now we can kind of ignore this part
02:22 - as it is
02:23 - the code for our search bar and as you
02:26 - can see here it ends
02:28 - our navigation bar and a header and
02:31 - we move on to our slider which is the
02:33 - main part of the project
02:36 - so in our slider we have a couple things
02:39 - so each movie is inside of slider
02:43 - popular movies and movie container
02:46 - and with each movie we have three
02:48 - different things we have to add
02:50 - so the first thing is the movie image
02:53 - and here we have left
02:54 - the image source for us to add our image
02:59 - and here we have a movie title which we
03:01 - should insert a movie title in and the
03:04 - descriptions
03:05 - also we can provide the link for the
03:07 - user to click on
03:08 - and we have added the word watch so that
03:11 - you can click on the word
03:12 - watch and it will bring you to the sites
03:14 - where you can watch the movie
03:16 - so once again i've added the movies i
03:19 - wanted to add
03:20 - so over here if you look at the html we
03:23 - can see
03:24 - that i've added a picture the title
03:29 - and description for each movie
03:32 - and there are total of ten so i've added
03:35 - guardians of the galaxy one and two
03:38 - added spider-man and many more
03:42 - and again you can follow the structure
03:44 - and add any movies you want
03:46 - so you want to add the picture of the
03:48 - movie inside the source
03:50 - of image source change the name of the
03:54 - title
03:55 - in the h2 tag and under the paragraph
03:59 - you want to add the description
04:02 - and finally when we look down we have
04:05 - our footer
04:08 - here we don't have to change anything as
04:11 - this
04:12 - kind of just explains everything for us
04:15 - and um that will conclude our html
04:17 - section
04:19 - so now as you can see in our preview we
04:22 - have our pictures
04:23 - but when we cover the picture the name
04:26 - of the movie
04:27 - description and the button is not
04:29 - visible
04:30 - so let's program my css to do that as
04:33 - well as lining these up
04:34 - and making a slider
04:37 - so the first thing we want to do is
04:39 - actually change the whole website
04:41 - and add some css to this so to do this
04:44 - we simply plus star and anything inside
04:48 - the star will be applied to the whole
04:49 - web page
04:50 - so here we want to allow some
04:54 - kind of border around our pictures and
04:57 - overall web page so we do box sizing
05:00 - and we set it to border box next we want
05:04 - to do the fonts
05:05 - so we can change the font by writing
05:07 - font family and we're just going to use
05:12 - um her vitica
05:16 - as our fonts and now we just want to set
05:20 - the default values for padding
05:22 - and margin to zero just like so
05:27 - now let's do a css on our body
05:30 - so let's type body and inside of our
05:33 - body what we want to do is set the
05:35 - background
05:35 - to black so here we can do
05:38 - background and we can simply use
05:43 - zero zero zero and that will be black
05:48 - and now we want to set the margin to
05:50 - automatic
05:52 - set the max width to 110
05:55 - [Music]
05:57 - and then change the width to 90
06:02 - following that let's do our length
06:05 - paragraphs and
06:06 - list options so that we can
06:09 - change the css for these um
06:12 - links so to do that we can include links
06:18 - paragraphs and our list inside of the
06:21 - same css
06:24 - so in here we want to change the color
06:26 - and we're going to change it to
06:28 - hash fff
06:32 - which will return it white
06:35 - next we want to change the style of the
06:37 - list i'm going to change it to inside
06:41 - that way we can't see the list until we
06:43 - hover over it
06:48 - and then text declaration we want to
06:50 - change it to 0 to remove the underlines
06:53 - [Music]
06:55 - we want to change the z index to 1
06:59 - so that it is never behind the screen
07:02 - and you know behind some kind of
07:03 - pictures and it will be the first thing
07:07 - that is popped up
07:09 - [Music]
07:10 - and finally is increase the font size to
07:13 - 10 pixels
07:16 - so here we can add individual properties
07:19 - to our length
07:20 - paragraph and our list um but we only
07:23 - going to do that to the links
07:25 - so that we can actually um
07:28 - personalized it so the first thing we're
07:31 - going to do is do display
07:32 - to block and then we're going to add
07:36 - some padding of 10 pixels
07:39 - and 15 pixels
07:40 - [Music]
07:43 - so now you can see this is uh
07:46 - more spaced out
07:51 - next let's go to our header and program
07:53 - our header
07:54 - inside of a header we want to set the
07:56 - margin to auto
07:59 - and set the width to 100
08:03 - now let's style our border and our
08:06 - navigation bar
08:08 - so let's do nav and inside of our
08:11 - navigation bar we want to type border
08:13 - bottom we're going to type one pixel
08:17 - solid and add a color and here we have
08:20 - picked out
08:22 - 2 1 b7 e5
08:29 - let's change the display to flux
08:33 - and let's set the display to flux
08:36 - and turn the justify content
08:41 - to space
08:44 - between
08:48 - just like so and so you can see you'll
08:51 - push everything to the right side
08:53 - and add a line a blue line at the bottom
08:57 - of our navigation bar
09:02 - and now we want to do
09:06 - some kind of styling on the title of our
09:08 - screen
09:09 - so let's do that so we can access it by
09:12 - accessing the
09:14 - class in which we put it in which is
09:16 - local
09:18 - instead of local you can do the display
09:21 - change it to table
09:24 - and we can change the background
09:27 - and we say corn flower blue
09:32 - just like so next let's style our
09:36 - navigation bar links so that they're not
09:38 - all
09:39 - you know just scrolling down and you
09:42 - know
09:42 - have a whole list of things
09:45 - so to begin with we shall do nav
09:50 - and we're going to point to the
09:53 - unordered list
09:55 - here we want to set the display to
09:58 - inline flex
10:01 - and then change the position into a
10:04 - reflective
10:05 - or relative
10:09 - and change and change the position
10:12 - to relative and remember
10:15 - this navigation is consistent an order
10:18 - list but inside of each one our list
10:20 - so let's style that individually
10:24 - so we can do that by tapping into the
10:26 - unordered list to the list
10:28 - [Music]
10:29 - here we want a transition
10:31 - [Music]
10:33 - for all at 200 milliseconds
10:38 - and we're going to add a webkit
10:41 - [Music]
10:43 - of transition
10:48 - and again we're going to do all at 200
10:50 - milliseconds
10:52 - [Music]
10:54 - and here our cursor should be the
10:58 - pointer
11:00 - and the display should be in the form of
11:02 - a table
11:05 - so now we have side of this let's uh
11:08 - make it so when we hover it
11:10 - it will actually show some colors so
11:12 - here we can do nav
11:14 - under the list list
11:17 - hover and here we can change the
11:20 - background
11:21 - once again the corn flower blue
11:25 - awesome so now we want to change
11:30 - the class inside of genre which is
11:32 - everything underneath our categories
11:35 - to do that we do now
11:38 - under the list list and inside we want
11:42 - to select
11:42 - genres and here we want to set the
11:46 - overflow to auto
11:49 - and the height to be 500 pixels
11:54 - so now we have a cap and at 500 pixels
11:58 - but um when it overflows it will
12:00 - automatically add scroll bar for us so
12:02 - we can scroll down
12:05 - so now let's dial the stuff in here so
12:07 - to do that we do nav
12:10 - unorder list list
12:14 - and unorder list
12:17 - here we want to set the display to none
12:21 - and the position to absolute
12:27 - just like so and now you can see that
12:30 - things are hidden from us
12:32 - so now we need a way to show it back and
12:34 - to do that we can
12:36 - do math under the list
12:39 - list hover
12:42 - and this is specifically for the
12:44 - unordered list and then form
12:46 - as well as form because we want the
12:48 - search bar to appear as well
12:50 - here we're going to set display to block
12:55 - we can set the background to black
13:02 - and we can set the position to absolute
13:07 - so now as you can see when we hover over
13:08 - the text of categories
13:10 - the list of categories appears same with
13:13 - list
13:14 - and our search bar so now let's
13:18 - actually do some css
13:21 - on the hover so here we have a nav
13:26 - under the list list an order list
13:30 - and these are links so we can say a
13:32 - slash hover
13:35 - and we can change the background color
13:37 - by doing background
13:39 - and let's do the same colors before as 2
13:41 - 1
13:42 - b7 e5
13:47 - so as you can see when we hover over
13:49 - these uh links
13:51 - the blue background will show
13:55 - finally let's change our search bar
13:58 - so that it will be relative and won't
14:00 - get pushed to the corner like
14:02 - it is right now to do that we do dot
14:05 - search
14:07 - and we're just gonna set the position to
14:09 - relative
14:14 - now let's do our forms
14:18 - which is where we are going to put in
14:20 - the text box let's do form
14:23 - we're going to add a border at the top
14:26 - that's one
14:27 - pixel thick solid
14:30 - and once again we want to add the same
14:32 - blue color so 2
14:33 - 1 b7 e5
14:37 - we want to set the position to absolute
14:42 - and add some padding so we're going to
14:44 - add 10 pixels and 15 pixels
14:47 - and now we're going to change the
14:48 - display to flux
14:51 - and add more padding to the right by 100
14:54 - pixels
14:56 - or negative 100 pixels and we're going
14:59 - to add padding
15:00 - to the right with a negative 100 pixels
15:05 - now let's program our slider so we can
15:08 - do this by dot slather
15:11 - and in here we just want to add a margin
15:13 - of 10 pixels all around
15:18 - and the width of 95
15:24 - after that we can edit the stuff
15:28 - inside of our slider the first stiff we
15:30 - should
15:32 - um style is movie container
15:36 - so dot movie container inside here we
15:40 - want to change the display
15:41 - your flux change to justify content
15:47 - the space between and add the width
15:52 - to 1200 pixels
15:55 - and as you can see our website is coming
15:58 - along nicely
16:00 - when we hover over our pictures we now
16:02 - show the
16:03 - title the paragraphs and the button
16:09 - so here we want the movie slider to
16:13 - slide whenever
16:15 - our mouse is not hovered over any
16:17 - pictures and stop the animation as soon
16:19 - as it is
16:21 - so when we hover the picture we want to
16:22 - stop the animation
16:24 - so we need to add dot movie
16:28 - slash container
16:32 - and hover and dot image
16:37 - dash effect
16:40 - just like so and here we want to do
16:43 - animation play state
16:46 - be pulsed that way we can stop the
16:49 - animation
16:52 - and now to add the actual animation for
16:54 - the slide
16:55 - we can use um an animation provided by
16:59 - css
17:00 - and we'll be adding this to the image
17:02 - effect so you can go to image effect
17:07 - animation dash play
17:10 - and now we want to add the animation for
17:12 - the actual slider so that it will
17:14 - actually move
17:15 - and slide our pictures and we'll do this
17:19 - in the image dash effect
17:22 - so inside of our image slash effect we
17:24 - can add an animation
17:26 - and this animation will be called the
17:28 - movie slider
17:29 - we want to add 10 second duration
17:33 - and we want to loop forever
17:36 - and add alternate linear
17:41 - and now we want to have overflow to be
17:44 - hidden
17:46 - so we won't you know the pictures won't
17:48 - go over our screens
17:52 - and now here you can see our movie
17:53 - slider is actually a function that we
17:56 - need to add because we haven't declared
17:58 - um an animation for that yet and to do
18:01 - that we use the keyword
18:02 - at keyframes
18:05 - movie slider and inside here
18:09 - we want to add our animations
18:13 - so at the start of the animation at zero
18:15 - percent
18:16 - we can add a margin of left of zero
18:24 - and a hundred percent we want to add the
18:27 - margin
18:28 - of left to be negative 100
18:34 - and again at the zero percent we want to
18:37 - add the margin
18:38 - to the right to be negative a hundred
18:42 - percent and then a hundred percent
18:47 - when the animation is done
18:51 - we want to add the margin to the right
18:55 - to zero percent
19:01 - just like that so now you can see our
19:04 - movies are getting sliding
19:08 - the final part of the project involves
19:11 - editing
19:12 - and styling more of our image effect
19:15 - and movie image so here let's go to
19:18 - image
19:22 - effect and we're going to be targeting
19:25 - the image
19:26 - inside of image effect here we want to
19:29 - add a transition
19:32 - and we want to apply to all of them for
19:34 - 300 milliseconds
19:36 - and we're going to add a webkit of
19:39 - transition
19:41 - as all with 300 milliseconds
19:47 - so now as you can see we have our slider
19:50 - that shift the movies and as soon as we
19:54 - hover over
19:55 - any one of these the animations stop
19:58 - and it continues when we stop hovering
20:00 - over it
20:03 - so that's all for today today we learned
20:04 - how to make a webpage using html and css
20:08 - to shift
20:09 - our poster pictures across the screen as
20:12 - well as using hover
20:13 - to show the details of the movie hope
