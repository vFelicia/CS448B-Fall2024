00:00 - hello everyone so today we're gonna look
00:02 - at how do we connect - to tickle we're
00:06 - gonna learn to unlock the wonderful
00:08 - world of coding through programming -
00:10 - using a great tool called tickle so
00:14 - let's begin before conducting - to
00:17 - tickle we need a few things first we
00:19 - need an iPad second we need the tickle
00:22 - app on the iPad and then third which is
00:26 - one of the most important things is we
00:28 - need - so make sure you don't forget -
00:30 - because if you start programming with no
00:33 - robot then that's gonna be a bit weird
00:36 - you may be wondering where do I download
00:38 - the it to collab it's that's very very
00:40 - simple there are two ways to do it you
00:42 - can head to the app store and type in
00:44 - tickle school edition and the app will
00:46 - look like what's in the picture then you
00:49 - can just download it or you can always
00:51 - open your iPad camera scan the QR code
00:53 - in this picture and once you scan the QR
00:56 - code it's going to have a little box
00:59 - pop-up which says view an app store you
01:01 - can click on that and that will take you
01:03 - to the tickle school Edition link in the
01:05 - app store then you can begin downloading
01:07 - it so hope everything works out well and
01:11 - then you should have the tickle app on
01:13 - your iPad in no time - turn on - we just
01:18 - click on this button here and once it's
01:23 - on should start moving and reacting then
01:30 - we can begin with connecting first to
01:33 - tickle so we're going to look at how we
01:36 - can connect - to tickle and then once
01:40 - that's done we can begin the wonderful
01:43 - world of programming with - so let's
01:46 - begin
01:48 - so we're gonna look at how to connect -
01:52 - to tickle first we need to click on the
01:55 - Settings icon and then we're gonna click
01:57 - on bluetooth and then turn on our
01:59 - glutens after that is done we can click
02:02 - back on the home button and then we can
02:05 - open tickle right over here
02:15 - so once tickle is open we can click on
02:18 - new project and then scroll down and as
02:23 - you scroll down you'll see - and dot
02:25 - then we'd like you to click on that so
02:32 - here you see a piece of code you can
02:34 - leave it as it is for now and then we
02:37 - want you to click on dash here so it
02:41 - says right now disconnected and you can
02:43 - see your radar just searching so make
02:46 - sure that your dash is on so I'm gonna
02:50 - put mine on and once it's on it will
02:56 - detect the connection and it will tell
02:59 - you what is the - his name and we'll
03:03 - show you dashes icon once that's there
03:07 - you click on it then it's going to show
03:11 - dashes battery icon which makes it known
03:14 - that it's connected once you've
03:17 - connected - to tickle you may now start
03:20 - programming hope you have fun in this
03:24 - clip we're gonna look at how we can
03:26 - disconnect - from tickle in case you
03:30 - wanna charge - or you want to stop
03:32 - programming with - so let's begin it
03:34 - let's look at that so suppose now you
03:37 - want to disconnect your dash all you
03:39 - have to do is click on it here
03:41 - and then it says connected you can just
03:44 - click on this icon here and it'll say it
03:49 - is connected it's on your bottom right
03:55 - so that's how you disconnect -
