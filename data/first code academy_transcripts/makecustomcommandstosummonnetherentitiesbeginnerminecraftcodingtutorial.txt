00:00 - hello everyone today we'll be making
00:03 - a nether portal and in this nether
00:06 - portal we're going to use command blocks
00:08 - and summon a wither and blaze
00:11 - so what we're going to use is learn to
00:14 - mod and that will be the tool that we're
00:16 - using to code today
00:18 - before we begin we're first going to
00:20 - look at the project and then we're going
00:21 - to start coding
00:24 - so here we're going to look at our mod
00:26 - that we've made so first i would suggest
00:28 - you to click on
00:29 - mod and then head back to your minecraft
00:33 - then we move into our another
00:37 - land here so we have quite a few
00:40 - weathers already so so first
00:43 - open your mod here and then click on it
00:46 - bring it here press on one click on this
00:50 - then you press on p type in place
00:54 - press on t type in summon
00:55 - [Music]
00:57 - and you have all over the place
01:02 - and for wither you just type in t
01:05 - wither t again
01:08 - summon and you get withers
01:12 - over here so if you want more blaze t
01:15 - again
01:15 - blaze t
01:22 - so now we're gonna make our project
01:23 - let's head into learn to mod
01:25 - log in click on play click on the arrow
01:28 - and then click on mods
01:30 - once we're here we're gonna type in
01:33 - nether
01:34 - entities since i already have this
01:36 - project i'm gonna have to put a number
01:38 - two
01:38 - and click on block lead multiplayer
01:41 - once it loads up click on c inside
01:46 - and then click on code
01:52 - once it's loaded we can head to function
01:54 - take out function do something and
01:56 - change this to main
01:59 - so the next thing we want to do is click
02:00 - on events and take out
02:02 - a do function when blank happens
02:06 - so in here we're going to click back on
02:08 - events we're going to take take out this
02:09 - block break event
02:11 - put it inside and change this to player
02:14 - chat
02:15 - so this will run when the player uses
02:17 - the chat function in
02:19 - minecraft and it's asking here do
02:22 - function blank
02:23 - so we're going to be making another
02:24 - function head to functions
02:26 - take out function do something change
02:29 - this
02:30 - to another entities
02:35 - then click on the gear drag out the
02:37 - input name as this is what our parameter
02:40 - is
02:40 - and we're going to call it info
02:45 - so before we begin we need to think of
02:47 - what we're going to spawn so we're going
02:48 - to spawn a wither
02:50 - and a blaze so the first thing we'd like
02:53 - to do
02:54 - is head over to logic now in logic we
02:57 - take out this block here
02:59 - and we duplicate it and add in
03:02 - a equal sign by clicking logic and then
03:04 - putting this
03:05 - here next what we want to add here
03:10 - is we want to take out something called
03:13 - a variable
03:14 - so we're going to take out this set item
03:17 - we're gonna make a new variable
03:19 - and call it spawn type
03:24 - so we can duplicate this and bring one
03:26 - here
03:28 - so for example if the spawn type
03:31 - is equal to this then we're going to
03:34 - have a base
03:35 - so for it to equal something we want to
03:38 - now check
03:39 - what the user types so in that case
03:41 - we'll click on the misc
03:43 - take out js code add one here and add
03:46 - another one here so this is gonna be
03:48 - info
03:49 - dot message this one
03:53 - also will be info dot message
03:56 - and then here what we're gonna add is if
03:59 - the message
04:00 - is a wither so in order to do that click
04:02 - on text take out a blank text box
04:05 - add one here and then add another here
04:08 - so here you type in weather
04:10 - here you type in blaze
04:14 - then we just copy this and add this here
04:20 - so what happens with this is if the user
04:22 - types in weather we're setting the spawn
04:24 - type together
04:25 - if the user types in place we're setting
04:27 - the spawn type to blaze
04:29 - so next we want to use a drone to place
04:32 - in this
04:33 - object so we head into logic
04:37 - and take out an influence add that here
04:39 - and then
04:40 - just copy paste this but instead we're
04:44 - not going to use info message here
04:47 - we are going to use the variable spawn
04:49 - type because that's the information that
04:50 - we need
04:51 - so head to variables take out spawn type
04:54 - put one here
04:56 - and then you can just duplicate this
04:59 - and add this here so one is blaze and
05:03 - one is
05:04 - wither so
05:08 - what happens is we now want them
05:11 - to place this so we click on drone
05:14 - take out drone place block
05:17 - or mob we're going to use mob because
05:19 - these are mobs we're referring to
05:22 - so we take out mob add this here
05:25 - and then we click on entities and take
05:26 - out this so we can just duplicate this
05:29 - add one here and add another here
05:32 - so this one is going to be called blaze
05:35 - this one is our wither
05:39 - so as that's done we also need to add in
05:42 - one more
05:42 - logic block so here we're going to add a
05:45 - logic block here
05:47 - and we're going to take these two
05:48 - statements and actually place them
05:50 - inside
05:51 - the reason being is when we want to
05:54 - spawn in any type of entity
05:57 - we'll be using something called a drone
05:59 - a drone is a device that flies around
06:01 - and it's used in places to deliver food
06:04 - chocolate and other items but in
06:07 - minecraft we can use it to place
06:09 - in our entities so to do that
06:13 - first we're gonna click on variables
06:15 - take out set
06:17 - you can put this here and change set
06:19 - item you can re
06:21 - make a new variable call it d and then
06:25 - you can put in a drawer so you click on
06:27 - drawn take out new drone and add this
06:29 - here so in order to have that work we
06:33 - click on this
06:34 - and just duplicate it and add it here
06:36 - but instead the text that we're going to
06:37 - add here
06:38 - is summon
06:41 - and then here to run our function we
06:44 - have to find this
06:45 - so this block is in misc function main
06:50 - we're going to change this as it's not
06:51 - going to call itself we're going to
06:53 - change this to another entities
06:56 - so let's look at this code and break it
06:58 - down so
06:59 - first we've made a function called main
07:01 - and this is the main function that
07:03 - minecraft is going to call
07:04 - so it understands that to run a function
07:06 - called netherentities
07:08 - under the event that the player chants
07:11 - and when that happens this function is
07:12 - going to run
07:13 - now let's dive into what nether entities
07:16 - function with info
07:17 - is so we've given it a parameter of info
07:20 - this is known as some information that
07:22 - the function would need
07:24 - then we have said if info dot message is
07:27 - equal to wither
07:28 - we set the spawn type together then in
07:31 - the next conditional it checks to see
07:33 - if the message that the user has sent is
07:35 - equal to blaze and if that happens we're
07:38 - setting the spawn type to blaze
07:41 - so here we have now specified either
07:44 - wither or blaze then we have a third
07:47 - conditional saying that
07:48 - if the user has typed in summon in the
07:51 - chat bar
07:52 - then it will make use of the drone and
07:54 - place this item
07:56 - and inside of this conditional we have
07:58 - this nested conditional
08:00 - which says that if the spawn type is
08:02 - blaze
08:03 - and that is what the user typed
08:05 - previously then it will spawn in place
08:07 - on the other hand if it's if the user is
08:11 - typed in wither
08:12 - it will then spawn in a wither so to
08:15 - test this out
08:16 - let's click on mod over here
08:19 - and on another window i have my server
08:22 - open so all you have to do is click on
08:23 - your server
08:24 - start click on join server it will start
08:26 - loading up which takes around five to
08:28 - seven minutes
08:29 - and then you can just copy paste your
08:31 - server code as for me i'm already in my
08:34 - server
08:35 - so we're gonna look at how it looks
08:39 - so over here i have minecraft and i'm
08:41 - already on the server
08:42 - so first i'm gonna
08:45 - change the weather to clear and we're
08:47 - gonna set the time today
08:51 - so once that's done we're gonna head to
08:53 - a nether portal
08:54 - and before we head there we should make
08:56 - sure that our game mode is set to
08:57 - creative
08:59 - so now that we're in creative mode
09:04 - we can head to our portal over here
09:08 - so this is a portal made with the
09:10 - obsidian blocks
09:11 - and here we have the portal so we have
09:14 - to just jump inside
09:16 - and just wait until we're teleported so
09:19 - over here we have some
09:20 - withers that are already spawned
09:24 - previously
09:25 - so let's move along here
09:31 - so for example
09:34 - we can open our mod here select this
09:40 - and then right click so first what we
09:42 - can do is press t
09:44 - type wither and then d type in
09:48 - summing and then another wither appears
09:52 - here and we can type in t type in blaze
09:58 - d and type in summon
10:02 - and it plays once over here
