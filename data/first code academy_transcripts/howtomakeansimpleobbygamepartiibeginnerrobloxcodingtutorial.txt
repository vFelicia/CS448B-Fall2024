00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back to our
00:02 - channel
00:04 - here we share beginner friendly coding
00:06 - tutorials on scratch
00:08 - roblox minecraft web programming and
00:10 - many more
00:11 - today we're gonna take a look at the
00:13 - part two of the roblox game called
00:15 - easy hobby game for this project
00:19 - i'll code the project in roblox studio
00:21 - using
00:22 - lua lua is a popular scripting and
00:25 - programming language
00:27 - its lightweight and easy to use nature
00:29 - means that it's embedded into very
00:31 - popular games
00:32 - games like world of warcraft and roblox
00:35 - is coated inside of lua
00:37 - so now in this tutorial i'll teach you
00:39 - how to use lua
00:40 - to program so that the cylinders will
00:43 - move and change color
00:44 - in a special two second delay yep let's
00:47 - get started
00:52 - in the first part of this project we
00:54 - finished the design of the game
00:56 - here for the part two we'll be coding
00:59 - our game
01:00 - so that our cylinder will move randomly
01:02 - and change color
01:04 - to do this we first renamed all the
01:07 - cylinders to moving cylinder
01:09 - so as you can see we have six cylinders
01:11 - here
01:12 - and we have six cylinders here each one
01:14 - corresponds
01:15 - to um one cylinder
01:18 - and i have also renamed them to
01:22 - cylinder zero or just cylinder cylinder
01:25 - 2
01:26 - cylinder 3 cylinder 4 cylinder 5 and
01:28 - cylinder 6.
01:30 - so that we can distinguish them from
01:31 - each other
01:33 - so now the first step we can actually
01:36 - move to our first
01:37 - moving cylinder and what we're going to
01:39 - do is under explore
01:41 - once we selected um workplace
01:46 - move down to our moving cylinder i can
01:48 - go over here to this plus sign
01:50 - press it and then add a script and this
01:53 - will open up a script file for us
01:55 - and this script will be a run against
01:58 - our moving cylinder
01:59 - so let's remove the first message they
02:01 - have
02:02 - and here i'm going to start by writing a
02:05 - while loop
02:08 - and i'm going to say while true do
02:12 - and um yep the end has automatically
02:14 - been filled up for us
02:16 - so while true so this is always going to
02:18 - be true we're going to be work
02:20 - uh moving the cylinder inside of this
02:22 - while loop
02:24 - and since this while loop is forever the
02:26 - cylinders will keep moving forever
02:29 - next let's do the script for us to move
02:32 - the cylinder
02:33 - so here i'm going to write script dot
02:36 - parent dot position
02:40 - and this is the position that our
02:42 - cylinder will be
02:43 - and now we're gonna set it to a new
02:45 - position and um
02:47 - the position we're gonna set it to is
02:49 - the current location it is
02:50 - at plus five or you know
02:53 - however more blocks you want to the left
02:56 - or to the right um so here we're going
02:57 - to use
02:59 - script dot parent dot position so
03:02 - grabbing the current position
03:04 - that it is currently x and i'm going to
03:07 - add
03:07 - a new factor and a factor 3 is how
03:11 - we can program a coordinate in lua
03:15 - so here i'm going to have a vector 3.
03:18 - and i'm gonna make a new vector and to
03:20 - do that we do dot new
03:22 - this will create a new vector for us and
03:24 - here
03:25 - the first value will be the x followed
03:27 - by y followed by
03:28 - z so we want to change the x value so we
03:31 - should change the first value
03:33 - and i'm going to add 10 to the x so now
03:35 - we will shift
03:37 - plus 10 in the x position and for the y
03:40 - i'll have it zero and z i'll have it
03:42 - zero so the only place that's changing
03:45 - is the x position and that will be off
03:47 - for the first line
03:48 - so essentially what we did in this line
03:50 - is that we have set
03:52 - the position of the cylinder to its own
03:55 - position
03:56 - plus 10 on the x axis so it will be the
04:00 - same position that it
04:01 - originally was but the x value would
04:05 - have
04:05 - plus 10 so um whatever
04:08 - location it has it will shift 10
04:12 - uh points to the x-axis
04:15 - and now we want to reset this and um
04:19 - between resets we want to wait two
04:21 - seconds so that you know the user can
04:23 - have
04:23 - a chance between um you know when this
04:26 - block is moving and when it's stationary
04:28 - so we can say wait two this will wait
04:31 - two seconds
04:32 - and now let's set it back to where it
04:34 - originally was
04:35 - and to do that once again we are
04:37 - changing the location of
04:39 - the cylinder so we can do
04:41 - script.parents.o
04:43 - dot position
04:47 - and now we can set it again using the
04:49 - similar syntax
04:50 - we will be setting it to the current
04:52 - location
04:54 - so script.parents.
04:57 - plus a new vector um again we're going
05:00 - to be using a factor three
05:01 - so that we can have um x y and z
05:04 - coordinates and we're gonna have a new
05:05 - one and this time we're gonna do minus
05:08 - ten
05:09 - zero and zero so now um
05:12 - after we have changed the location so
05:14 - that the x value is plus ten
05:17 - we wait two seconds and change it back
05:19 - to originally
05:20 - uh where it was by subtracting ten from
05:22 - the x-axis
05:24 - and now we're going to say weight 2
05:28 - again and now if this is all we have in
05:31 - our wire loop
05:32 - what will happen is that our cylinder
05:35 - will move
05:36 - 10 units to the x value
05:39 - wait two seconds and then go back to
05:41 - where it originally was
05:43 - wait two seconds and repeat um this step
05:47 - now let's learn how to color the
05:49 - cylinder to a random color
05:50 - at each time and to do this we first
05:53 - have to make sure that
05:54 - we have the naming convention correct so
05:57 - here
05:57 - as you can see my moving cylinder has
06:00 - six unique
06:01 - numbers so the first one has no number
06:04 - second one is associated with moving
06:06 - cylinder two
06:08 - three four five six and the point is to
06:10 - make it so that none of the cylinders
06:12 - have the same name
06:14 - so that we can refer to each one
06:15 - individually
06:17 - so now what we want to do is above this
06:19 - while loop
06:21 - i'm going to add one line of code and
06:24 - we're going to
06:24 - basically have a variable that stores
06:28 - our moving cylinder so we can change its
06:30 - color so we can save this as a local
06:32 - variable since we're only using
06:34 - this in this file we can set local and
06:36 - we can name this
06:37 - variable moving cylinder
06:42 - now i want to set it to the actual
06:44 - object of this moving cylinder
06:46 - so i'm going to set it equals to gain
06:50 - dot workspace dot moving
06:53 - cylinder and you can see there's six
06:55 - moving cylinders corresponding to
06:57 - these six moving cylinders and for this
07:00 - file i'll be using
07:01 - the moving cylinder as my um
07:04 - object that i'm changing
07:08 - now before we change the position let's
07:10 - change the color
07:12 - to that we can use brick color dot
07:14 - random brick color
07:17 - represents the property for the block
07:20 - color
07:21 - so to change the block color we can
07:23 - first access
07:24 - our moving cylinder and we can access
07:26 - the dot brick
07:27 - color so here we can say move cylinder
07:32 - dot brick color and this is the property
07:36 - that contains what color this moving
07:38 - cylinder is going to be
07:40 - so now we can set it to brick color
07:44 - dot random like this
07:48 - and now just return a random color from
07:51 - the possible brick colors we can pick
07:53 - from
07:53 - and set it to our moving cylinders color
07:57 - and we can copy and paste this and
08:00 - right before our second move back so
08:02 - that it will change color
08:04 - at each step like so so now with that we
08:07 - have the base coat finish we can
08:09 - actually expand
08:09 - on what is inside of our wire loop so
08:12 - let's copy and paste what we already
08:13 - have with the six lines of code
08:15 - and let's paste this two times
08:18 - and what i'm going to do is i'm going to
08:21 - keep um the weight
08:22 - and the move cylinder dot break color
08:25 - the same
08:26 - but at each position i'm going to change
08:28 - the position
08:29 - for the x-axis and it's important that
08:31 - we don't touch the y and z
08:33 - so here we can make this negative five
08:37 - and five here i can make it 15
08:41 - and negative 15 and so you can really
08:44 - just make it any number
08:46 - it's good to keep it around 5 10 15 to
08:49 - 20.
08:50 - um but what's important is that we
08:52 - should have
08:53 - two um script position
08:56 - where one is going to be a positive and
08:59 - one is going to be negative so that it
09:01 - cancels out
09:02 - so here it moves 10 and the gum is back
09:05 - negative 10
09:06 - it goes from negative five and it comes
09:08 - back to five
09:09 - so whatever we do we move it back to the
09:12 - original position
09:14 - and um yeah so this is the um
09:18 - whole code for our moving cylinder so to
09:21 - make something similar for moving
09:22 - cylinder two three four and five
09:24 - and six we can simply copy and paste
09:28 - this code and modify it slightly so that
09:30 - it will work for all
09:32 - different ones so here i can copy and
09:34 - paste this
09:37 - and now i'm going to do the same thing
09:39 - go to moving
09:40 - cylinder 2 go to plus and add a script
09:45 - and here i'm going to delete this line
09:47 - and paste what we have in our script
09:50 - for moving cylinder and the only thing
09:52 - we have to change here
09:53 - is up here in the local variable we're
09:56 - going to change
09:58 - game.workshop.movingcylinder to
10:02 - game.workshop.commovingcylinder2
10:04 - so we're gonna correspond it with the
10:05 - name we have uh gave it
10:07 - up here and um that'll be the only
10:10 - change we have to do
10:11 - so now we can copy and paste this again
10:14 - go to moving cylinder three add a script
10:20 - paste this in change the local variable
10:22 - name
10:23 - to moving cylinder 3 save this
10:27 - and then moving cylinder 4 that would be
10:29 - the same thing
10:32 - change this to moving cylinder four
10:37 - and again from moving cylinder five i'll
10:39 - do the same thing
10:41 - copying paste and change name to moving
10:43 - cylinder five
10:45 - and last but not least we do the same
10:47 - thing for our
10:48 - moving cylinder 6 copy and paste and
10:52 - change it to 6.
10:55 - and yeah so now we have the code for
10:58 - changing colors and changing the
11:00 - position
11:02 - and we can actually run our game and see
11:04 - it in action
11:05 - so let's go to our game let's go to file
11:08 - and save our project
11:09 - so save file so now we can play the game
11:12 - and uh
11:13 - do that by clicking play
11:16 - and now if you look at the cylinders not
11:18 - only are they changing
11:19 - position they're shifting and it's
11:21 - changing color as well
11:23 - so you can see that there's six
11:24 - cylinders and they're all moving
11:27 - um after a delay of two seconds and
11:29 - changing color
11:31 - so that's all for today i hope you guys
