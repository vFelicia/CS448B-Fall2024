00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to our
00:02 - channel
00:03 - here we share between the friendly
00:04 - coding tutorials on scratch roblox
00:07 - minecraft
00:07 - web programming and many more today we
00:10 - are going to make a fireworks animation
00:12 - using python turtle
00:15 - so in this project we will use
00:17 - randomness and drawing patterns
00:18 - to do some of how works and a message
00:21 - for the fourth of july
00:23 - so it just going to pops up some of the
00:26 - fireworks
00:27 - from random places and then after
00:30 - generating a certain fireworks out it
00:33 - would
00:34 - perform it would like shows up happy 4th
00:37 - of july
00:39 - so yeah just like that so let's get
00:42 - started
00:44 - so first of all we will start by
00:46 - creating a new project
00:47 - and importing the turtle and random
00:49 - libraries
00:50 - okay so we will use these two libraries
00:52 - for drawing and putting the fireworks in
00:54 - the random position
00:56 - so first of all we can do import
01:00 - turntable and import
01:04 - random okay after writing these two
01:07 - codes
01:08 - uh we can begin with the general setup
01:10 - of our program in this case
01:12 - we'll set up our screen to any size that
01:14 - we prefer
01:15 - and we'll make one turtle called my
01:17 - turtle head and then with speed zero
01:19 - so uh it's actually up to you with the
01:22 - setup of the size and
01:23 - the width of nsis in this case we're
01:26 - just going to use
01:27 - wn as a variable equals to turtle
01:32 - screen
01:38 - and set up
01:44 - 500 by 500 in this case
01:47 - and then background color
01:50 - to black
01:55 - all right and then my trello
02:23 - all right so to select a random
02:27 - color for the fireworks we can actually
02:30 - make a list of colors so we can
02:32 - we can then take a random element from
02:34 - blenders and i use that for the color of
02:36 - the fireworks
02:37 - well we're going to start by while
02:40 - making a list called colors and then
02:43 - writing down as many colors as you want
02:46 - well if you want to detail detailed
02:48 - lists of colors so you can use
02:50 - uh we can actually go to the website uh
02:52 - it's called
02:54 - trinket.io there's a bunch of colors
02:58 - that you can actually use and then you
02:59 - can take
03:00 - you can see the name of that and in this
03:02 - case we're just going to
03:04 - add a couple of like uh colors
03:07 - so i'm just going to copy and paste
03:24 - so i have blue red yellow orange purple
03:27 - magna
03:28 - pink lime green gold silver and violet
03:30 - so you can add as many more as you like
03:32 - if you want to
03:33 - okay so now we can actually make some
03:37 - functions
03:38 - so actually draw the fireworks we have
03:39 - to create a function that will be called
03:42 - for each firework that we want to draw
03:44 - the parameter of this function would be
03:46 - the turtle we are going to use to draw
03:48 - the firework
03:49 - we can actually call that t so
04:12 - so we're going to use two random numbers
04:14 - x and y to move the
04:15 - turtle to that position so uh what i'm
04:19 - typing
04:20 - just now is actually creating two random
04:22 - position which is the x
04:24 - and then the y
04:33 - afterwards we're going to generate
04:35 - random numbers using the random integers
04:38 - and while we're going to specify the
04:40 - lower in the files
04:42 - while we already done that so we are
04:44 - going to move the turtle without
04:46 - leaving a trace using pen up before
04:48 - moving the turtle
04:49 - or using go to xy so um we have to
04:52 - pen up first before all or else we're
04:56 - just going to make the
04:57 - whole mess and then we're going to
05:01 - type t go to
05:04 - x and y like that
05:08 - so next we're going to put the pen down
05:10 - and select a
05:11 - random color from the list we already
05:14 - have
05:15 - so t go to
05:19 - x well actually we've done that turn
05:22 - down
05:27 - and then after we did the pen down
05:30 - function
05:31 - we're going to use the well the
05:33 - instruction random dot choice
05:35 - so select the random element from the
05:37 - list colors
05:39 - so
05:47 - like that perfect finally we will create
05:50 - a variable to store the size of the
05:52 - prime work by selecting a random value
05:54 - between
05:55 - well um let's say about 20-100
05:58 - so that it doesn't interfere with the
06:00 - text where we're going to put it on top
06:02 - of the screen
06:04 - so
06:15 - okay so now we can actually create a
06:18 - fireworks
06:19 - the fireworks consist of 36 equal lines
06:22 - that rotate around the same point
06:24 - to create this firework tutorial has to
06:26 - draw a line
06:27 - then rotate we can move the turtle
06:30 - forward backward and then
06:32 - use a for loop to do this for
06:36 - i in range
06:40 - 36 we're going to
06:44 - first forward our pen
06:48 - and then backward
06:57 - then right
07:01 - like that so we finish our base so we're
07:05 - done with the function
07:06 - uh we can now proceed to call the
07:08 - function
07:09 - so cut as many times as you want and
07:13 - i'm going to use well 10 formatted
07:15 - firework number
07:16 - so we're going to use a for loop to call
07:18 - this function repeatedly
07:20 - for the parameter we're going to use the
07:23 - terminal we defined at the beginning of
07:25 - the program
07:28 - so
07:30 - in range
07:34 - 10.
07:42 - and then my turtle like that
07:47 - okay so finally let's code our message
07:50 - at the top of the screen
07:52 - so we're going to use the pen knob and
07:54 - go to so you can move to the top and the
07:56 - center of the screen
07:57 - adjust the numbers depending on the size
07:59 - of the screen
08:00 - change the color to white since the
08:02 - background color is black
08:04 - all right so i will write the messages
08:06 - and write
08:07 - and then the message happy 4th of july
08:10 - type the pen up first
08:41 - and then now while you can specify other
08:43 - options
08:44 - such as the font and then the position
08:46 - of text and then what
08:48 - was the text as as what you want to type
08:52 - change those using align and center in
08:55 - front of equals the type size
08:57 - and wait so after i type happy
09:02 - 4th of july
09:06 - and then
09:37 - this is the final code and well we
09:40 - actually finished everything
09:42 - uh we have the function for drawing
09:45 - and also the pen up and the pen down and
09:47 - then we
09:48 - um create 10 fireworks
09:52 - and then afterwards we're going to
09:54 - generate happy 4th of july
09:56 - after all the fireworks so let's run it
10:15 - so all the artworks are actually showing
10:17 - up
10:18 - and it's in a different position each
10:21 - one has 36
10:22 - strokes and then at the end there's like
10:25 - the happy fourth of july
10:27 - text so that's it for the project
10:31 - so that's for today well hope you liked
