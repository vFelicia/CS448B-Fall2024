00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back to our
00:01 - channel here we share
00:03 - beginner friendly coding tutorials on
00:05 - roblox scratch
00:06 - minecraft web programming and many more
00:09 - today we will be making a fun and
00:11 - exciting project
00:12 - in scratch junior here's a preview to
00:15 - our project
00:16 - in the first scene we have our title for
00:19 - the uh
00:19 - game space invaders and then when we
00:22 - click on the start
00:24 - we enter the actual game where you see
00:26 - aliens appear and disappear at their own
00:28 - rates
00:29 - here we can control the rockets by
00:31 - clicking on the two arrow keys
00:34 - left arrow key to move to the left right
00:36 - to the right
00:37 - and we shoot by pressing the red button
00:41 - yeah let's get started so we're going to
00:44 - start by creating a new project on
00:46 - scratch
00:46 - jr so let's go to home and let's click
00:50 - on new project
00:51 - and the first thing we're going to do in
00:52 - a new project is delete our
00:54 - character click we do that by holding
00:57 - left click
00:58 - over here and we can delete it and now
01:01 - we can change our background
01:03 - to do that we click this picture up here
01:08 - and we can pick the bottom right picture
01:11 - of the moon
01:12 - and the earth press
01:16 - okay next let's make the second slide
01:19 - of our game so here we can click
01:24 - on this button which will make a new
01:25 - screen for us and again we'll be doing
01:28 - tech
01:28 - so hold left click delete
01:32 - and we're going to change the background
01:34 - picture to this space picture
01:36 - the one next to the moon and now let's
01:40 - go back to our first scene
01:41 - with the moon in the earth and we're
01:43 - going to click on this abc button
01:45 - and we're going to write space invaders
01:49 - and this will be the title of our game
01:51 - and over here
01:52 - we can change the color so let's change
01:54 - it to white
01:56 - and press enter and here we have it we
01:59 - have space invaders
02:00 - um circado so now let's add a button
02:05 - for our user to go to the actual game
02:08 - so here you can add a sprite
02:11 - by pressing a plus key
02:15 - and here we scroll down
02:18 - until we find the star which is right
02:21 - here
02:23 - and we can make the start a little bit
02:25 - bigger by going over here to the purple
02:28 - uh person button click
02:31 - on the first one and just double click
02:35 - it
02:35 - a couple of times and that will actually
02:37 - help
02:38 - activate this function which is
02:40 - increasing the size of the star
02:42 - after we're done we can drag this
02:43 - function out and our star will remain
02:46 - the same size
02:48 - now we should add the code for the star
02:49 - so when we click on it it goes to the
02:51 - next screen
02:52 - um so the first thing we want to do
02:56 - is take the wing click on events
02:59 - controller
03:01 - and now we want to go over here to the
03:04 - red blocks
03:05 - and drag in this block over here
03:08 - and now when we click on double star it
03:10 - will bring us to the next screen
03:12 - just like that so for this game we will
03:15 - need
03:15 - eight characters a rocket a bullet
03:19 - three aliens and three user buttons and
03:22 - the three user buttons will have
03:24 - a left arrow key a right arrow key and a
03:27 - shoot button
03:28 - so let's get started so the first thing
03:30 - we'll do is
03:31 - make the rockets so i already have to
03:34 - save up but the rockets is all the way
03:35 - at the bottom
03:37 - so you can go all over the bottom
03:39 - rockets correct
03:42 - and we don't have to focus on resizing
03:43 - this rockets for now
03:45 - and now let's do the controls so
03:48 - to do the controls we actually draw them
03:50 - by hand so to do that
03:52 - we add a new sprite and over here at the
03:55 - top
03:55 - left we have an empty picture and it
03:58 - says character
03:59 - and we'll actually use this paintbrush
04:01 - key to edit this character
04:04 - so first thing first we can just write
04:06 - left arrow and change
04:07 - the title and over here we want to click
04:12 - on the weft and the method strokes
04:15 - so here we want it to be freestyle and
04:18 - let's make
04:20 - the color yellow and let's draw
04:24 - our arrow just like this
04:28 - and when we're done we can press the uh
04:31 - done button at the top right
04:33 - now we have our left arrow
04:36 - and we're going to do the same thing for
04:38 - the right arrow so once again adding
04:40 - sprite character edit character
04:43 - let's change the name to right arrow
04:47 - and the settings are saved for us so
04:49 - let's use draw on it
04:56 - just like that and once again it's fine
04:59 - that it's looking a little bit big
05:01 - um and then finally we want to shoot
05:03 - button and then here i just want a big
05:05 - red circle so add sprites
05:10 - on this character edit character
05:13 - and over here i'm going to change from
05:15 - freestyle to drawing circles
05:17 - and i'm going to change from yellow to
05:18 - red i can just drag over
05:22 - like that and draw a circle when you
05:25 - fill out the circle
05:26 - i can use this paint brush tool click in
05:29 - the middle and you'll fill up the whole
05:31 - character don't forget to uh
05:34 - change this to make this i'm gonna need
05:36 - this button
05:40 - click okay flip between our arrow keys
05:44 - and this would be all for now so now
05:46 - we're gonna create
05:47 - our bullets and three aliens so to make
05:50 - the bullets
05:51 - we can draw on this so create a new
05:53 - sprite
05:55 - new character and then paint brush
05:59 - here we change this title to bullets
06:02 - and instead of using freestyle or circle
06:05 - we're going to use
06:06 - a triangle or a rectangle option
06:10 - make the bullets green and drag it like
06:14 - this
06:15 - and again to fill it we can use this
06:17 - fill tool
06:20 - press okay now for our bullets
06:24 - and before we make our aliens let's just
06:26 - resize everything
06:27 - so using the same method as before we
06:30 - can actually go on each one
06:32 - no one this size down buttons click
06:36 - each one twice drag it up
06:43 - click twice drag it up
06:47 - put in here click it twice
06:53 - and we'll just very quickly resize
06:56 - everything down
06:58 - okay and let's do the rocket as well
07:05 - lens awesome and now let's just
07:08 - reposition everything
07:10 - you want the boats to be inside of
07:11 - rockets
07:13 - to arrow key speed exclusion like this
07:17 - i think my left arrow key isn't too big
07:19 - so i'm just gonna resize it one more
07:20 - time
07:24 - just like so and now we should make our
07:27 - aliens
07:28 - so again we're gonna draw on this so
07:29 - let's click on the create sprite
07:33 - new sprite and uh let's edit our
07:36 - character
07:37 - let's change the name to alien
07:43 - and we can use the furry style and uh
07:46 - they could work and use brown and just
07:48 - draw any shape here you can uh
07:51 - draw any shape use the filler tool fill
07:54 - the whole thing up
07:56 - use the circle option and use red eyes
08:00 - and just form the eyes for the
08:04 - alien again we're going to use fill tool
08:06 - to fill up the middle
08:08 - and this would be our alien
08:12 - and now let's just duplicate this we can
08:15 - do this by clicking plus
08:17 - and the alien we just made will be saved
08:20 - over here
08:20 - as you can see um i've made this once
08:23 - already so all of my
08:25 - previous tries have been saved here so
08:27 - we're going to use the most recent
08:29 - alien that i made and we're going to add
08:32 - two more we're at two of them in total
08:40 - just like so so now let's program
08:44 - the application so we can actually shoot
08:46 - and control with the rockets
08:48 - so here we want the arrow keys
08:52 - to move our rockets while the red button
08:54 - to shoot
08:56 - so let's go on the left arrow button
08:59 - and we're gonna click right click on
09:04 - and we're gonna use this option which
09:05 - will send a signal
09:07 - and if you press on the down arrow key
09:10 - it will drop down to six different
09:11 - colors
09:12 - and basically you will associate the
09:14 - type of signals with the color so here
09:16 - let's assign our left arrow key to this
09:19 - orange signal
09:22 - then we have to close off our block you
09:23 - say the end of
09:26 - block on the right
09:29 - and let's do the same thing for the
09:30 - right here
09:32 - we grab the one click on events
09:37 - signal and this time let's change the
09:40 - right arrow signal
09:41 - to yellow so we have the orange for left
09:44 - and yellow for right
09:48 - now we'll end it with this over here
09:52 - and final step we add the button so
09:55 - again you can select the
09:57 - button by either clicking in game or on
09:59 - the left
10:01 - now grab one click done
10:04 - send to signal and here i'm going to use
10:07 - the same color slip button
10:08 - red make it a little bit easier for
10:10 - myself to remember
10:13 - once again close it up and that will be
10:16 - our whole
10:18 - uh controls for the rockets
10:21 - so now let's program the bullet so for
10:24 - the bullets
10:26 - we want a couple of things first we
10:28 - wanted to move
10:29 - where the rockets is moving so we should
10:31 - give the same commands
10:33 - as uh the rockets in terms of movements
10:37 - secondly when the red button is clicked
10:40 - on we want to set the bullets
10:42 - up and then come back
10:45 - so that it will be the same place the
10:47 - rocket ready to fire it again
10:49 - so to do this we can first hide the
10:51 - rockets
10:52 - at the beginning of the game that way
10:54 - the user can't see it
10:56 - and when the red button is clicked we
10:58 - show the bullets
10:59 - it goes up it hides again and then comes
11:03 - back down
11:04 - from just being invisible so that the
11:06 - user can't see it coming back
11:08 - i can only see it going up so let's do
11:11 - that
11:13 - so first we want the green button or the
11:15 - green flag to be clicked on
11:17 - and make it invisible so to make it
11:19 - invisible go to the purple side
11:22 - this invisible character
11:26 - and now while we add it we want to set
11:28 - the speed
11:29 - of the bullet so we can do that by
11:31 - clicking on the
11:32 - orange blocks select the sky
11:36 - running click on the down drop and click
11:39 - on the fastest option
11:41 - which is would be the one with the most
11:42 - horizontal lines
11:45 - combine it close up close it off
11:49 - next we want to do the movement of the
11:51 - bullets and once again this will be the
11:53 - same as the rockets
11:54 - so here once we receive a signal either
11:59 - from
11:59 - orange or yellow remember orange is left
12:03 - and yellow is right here let's do the
12:05 - left so
12:06 - upon receiving orange signal we want to
12:09 - move
12:10 - and use this blue controls to move and
12:13 - we can use the left dash
12:16 - move it once and that's it
12:20 - close it and now let's do the right
12:23 - arrow
12:24 - upon receiving signal and this
12:27 - should be the yellow signal we want to
12:31 - use
12:32 - the right dash one to the right
12:38 - like that and for the shoot
12:41 - we know we want to receive the red
12:44 - signal
12:46 - and here we wanted the show itself
12:50 - so let's show itself show the bullets
12:54 - fly forward and let's apply for it
12:57 - and let's change this number to seven
13:01 - and then this will reach the top of the
13:03 - screen and after it does you want to
13:05 - make that
13:06 - visible and drop back seven so that it
13:08 - will be at the same
13:09 - location as the rocket
13:13 - changes to seven
13:17 - awesome bend closed
13:22 - and we're done with bullets let's
13:27 - continue with our rockets so here our
13:30 - rocket says two things
13:32 - it moves based on the arrow keys and at
13:34 - the start of the game when the green
13:36 - flag is clicked on
13:37 - we'll start the movement of our alien so
13:40 - it will go invisible
13:41 - and invisible within the timer making us
13:44 - have to hit them when it's visible so
13:47 - here
13:48 - for the movement it will be the same
13:50 - thing as the bullet
13:52 - so upon receiving an orange signal
13:56 - and we know that's a left turn we'll
13:58 - move it
13:59 - one to the left closing
14:03 - and now upon receiving a yellow signal
14:06 - which we know is a right arrow key
14:08 - we'll move it one to the right
14:12 - and close it up and finally
14:15 - when the green flag is clicked on we
14:18 - want
14:19 - to set the speed of our kit of our
14:23 - uh rocket and set it to the fastest
14:26 - and now we also want to send a signal to
14:30 - the aliens so here we'll have
14:33 - send signal and here we can send
14:37 - a green signal a new one that the alien
14:41 - will be checking for
14:43 - again close it that will be
14:47 - for aliens or that will be for all
14:50 - for our rockets and let's move to the
14:53 - aliens
14:55 - so for the aliens we want them to
14:59 - start being invisible and visible
15:03 - within the timer after the green flag is
15:05 - clicked on
15:07 - and we already know that our bullets
15:09 - over here
15:11 - follows our as follows our rockets
15:14 - which are rockets would then send a
15:17 - signal upon
15:18 - having the green flag to our aliens
15:23 - so here we want to check for the green
15:24 - flag
15:26 - so upon receiving the green flag
15:29 - we can start the process of invisibility
15:33 - and turning invisible and visible within
15:36 - the timer
15:38 - so to do a timer we can first add 10
15:42 - seconds and change the set to 5
15:46 - and you're going to say for after 5
15:48 - seconds be invisible
15:51 - and have another timer this time we can
15:54 - keep it as 10
15:56 - and uh here we want to turn it to
15:58 - visible
16:01 - and we want this to repeat so we're
16:03 - going to use the repeat end
16:04 - over here just like that
16:08 - and finally when it hits or gets hit by
16:10 - the bullets
16:12 - we want the alien to turn invisible
16:15 - so here we go back to the events when
16:18 - this sprite is touched
16:20 - we want to set sprite 3 into symbols
16:24 - that would be all
16:27 - and this is the last part of the project
16:30 - um
16:31 - this is a whole game we should copy the
16:33 - same exact code over here to the other
16:36 - two aliens
16:38 - so let's do that really quickly
16:41 - events check green flag
16:45 - and here we can actually change the
16:47 - timer settings a little bit
16:48 - you can have 10 seconds to be invisible
16:53 - and then wait five seconds
16:58 - and you'll turn physical so this
17:00 - basically will turn
17:01 - visible for 10 seconds and then turn it
17:05 - invisible
17:06 - and then after 5 seconds turn back
17:07 - visible
17:09 - and again when it's touched on i want it
17:12 - to be invisible
17:15 - that'll be all yes let's move on to our
17:19 - last alien
17:21 - when we see it's free signal
17:27 - let's wait five seconds
17:30 - turn invisible and again wait five
17:33 - seconds
17:38 - turn invisible again these numbers you
17:40 - guys can
17:41 - change around to your likings finally we
17:44 - have the collision
17:47 - in which we turn it invisible
17:51 - at the end
17:56 - that's all for today hope you enjoyed it
