00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to our
00:01 - channel here with your beginner friendly
00:03 - coding tutorials on scratch roblox
00:05 - minecraft web programming and many more
00:08 - today we are going to finish our mini
00:10 - golf game we started
00:11 - to code in scratch in the last video for
00:15 - the second part of the project we'll
00:16 - divide the functions we're adding by how
00:18 - essential they are to the game
00:20 - so we'll start by defining what to do
00:22 - when the ball enters the hole
00:24 - but first we'll add another circle
00:26 - inside of the hole we had from last time
00:28 - so that it's more precise when entering
00:31 - it then when the ball touches the color
00:33 - of the little circle
00:34 - will will code to handle scoring on one
00:37 - hole
00:38 - so let's get started so right now i have
00:41 - my scratch project
00:42 - open i'm gonna go to the whole sprite
00:44 - and then in costumes i'm gonna add
00:46 - another hole inside
00:48 - so here i'm going to make the little one
00:50 - the little hole here
00:51 - red okay i'll adjust it a little
00:55 - so here we have it okay and then next
00:59 - what we want to do is we need to add the
01:01 - detection block just below where we
01:03 - detect if it touches one of the borders
01:05 - of the field
01:06 - then if the speed is low enough the ball
01:08 - can go into the hole so we set the speed
01:10 - to a negative value so it gets
01:12 - out of the loop all right so i'm going
01:15 - to go back to my ball sprite
01:17 - and then right in this
01:20 - detection block i'm going to duplicate
01:23 - it and add another if
01:27 - oh sorry i mean we need to move it right
01:30 - here
01:31 - all right so if touching the color red
01:34 - now i need to use the color dropper
01:35 - again
01:36 - and grab the color red okay so it's
01:39 - touching the color red
01:40 - and we also want to see if the speed is
01:44 - low enough so get another um condition
01:47 - if okay so we need to go to operators
01:51 - get the smaller then sine so if
01:54 - the speed look at speed is smaller than
01:58 - 5 then we are going to set the speed to
02:01 - negative so it gets out of the loop
02:04 - okay so variables set
02:09 - speed to negative 0.1
02:13 - all right now in addition to what we
02:16 - just did
02:17 - so we want to also broadcast a message
02:19 - so we level up to the next level so
02:22 - we're going to go to event
02:23 - and we're going to choose broadcast
02:25 - message we'll put it right here
02:28 - and in message i'm going to say um next
02:31 - level
02:33 - and then ok all right
02:36 - so this message will be received by
02:38 - everyone so we'll add code in the stage
02:40 - so it changes
02:41 - to the next backdrop so that's the
02:42 - second level and after that code we'll
02:45 - need to design the actual next backdrop
02:47 - so the actual level two
02:49 - so let me go ahead to the backdrop and
02:52 - say
02:53 - when i receive next level
02:56 - i'm going to switch to the next backdrop
02:58 - and then we're going to go ahead and
03:00 - design it
03:01 - okay i'm in the backdrops part now what
03:04 - i'm going to do is i'm going to
03:05 - duplicate my first backdrop green and
03:08 - have it as backdrop 2.
03:09 - of course i want to delete this
03:11 - rectangle i have earlier and set up a
03:13 - complete new one
03:15 - since this is level 2 we're going to
03:17 - make it a little bit harder so i'm going
03:19 - to add a water trap
03:21 - and also a grass trap so when the ball
03:24 - hits either one of these
03:25 - items it's going to have to go back to
03:27 - the starting point
03:29 - all right so i'm going to go ahead and
03:30 - do that right now
03:32 - my um second background stage
03:35 - all right a level two stage now what i'm
03:38 - going to do is going to add the traps
03:39 - that i talked about earlier so the water
03:41 - trap
03:42 - and the grass trap i'm going to start
03:45 - with the water traps i'm going to change
03:47 - the color to blue
03:51 - okay all right let's do this blue
03:55 - then add a circle and i think i'm going
03:57 - to add it right
03:58 - here okay let me say no outline as well
04:02 - so this is the water trap and then
04:04 - another thing i want to do is also the
04:06 - grass trap
04:07 - so for the grass trap i'm going to
04:09 - change the color to
04:10 - a slightly different shade of green
04:12 - let's say this neon
04:14 - green and i'm going to place it right
04:16 - here so that's the grass trap
04:18 - either if the ball touches either the
04:20 - water trap or the grass trap
04:22 - then it's going to have to reset its
04:23 - position back to the beginning
04:25 - okay now in the same stage section we'll
04:27 - set up a level variable so that the game
04:30 - knows in which
04:30 - map level you're in right now so we'll
04:33 - add a block to set the level to the
04:34 - initial one
04:35 - and then we can put the switch backdrop
04:38 - to the level variable so it changes
04:39 - automatically
04:41 - we can also add a condition so that if
04:42 - you reach the end of the levels you stop
04:44 - the program
04:46 - all right so let's go to code and to do
04:49 - this we're going to say when i
04:50 - receive the next level we already have
04:52 - it right here when i receive
04:54 - next level we're going to change the
04:56 - level by one because we're in level two
04:58 - so to do that let's make a variable
05:02 - first called level
05:03 - and then we'll say change level by one
05:07 - now i don't want it to show up in the
05:08 - game so i'm going to uncheck it right
05:10 - here
05:12 - so change level by one and then i'm
05:14 - going to say
05:15 - all right if we have reached the end of
05:17 - the levels
05:18 - so right now we have level one and two
05:20 - so i'm going to say the n would be level
05:21 - three
05:22 - right so we'll say if level equals to
05:25 - three
05:30 - okay then we are going to get the stop
05:32 - all block
05:35 - and then we're gonna switch backdrop
05:37 - back to the initial one
05:39 - so we're going to go to looks and switch
05:42 - backdraw
05:45 - to level all right and then we're also
05:49 - going to say when green flag
05:50 - is clicked we want to start from the
05:52 - beginning which is level one
05:54 - so we go to operators and we do set
05:57 - level
05:58 - to one and then also switch the backdrop
06:01 - to one
06:02 - so next thing we're going to do is set
06:05 - up the ball and the hole so that when
06:06 - you end a level
06:07 - they move to their next position so
06:10 - we're going to use the when i receive
06:12 - and a go-to block to do this inside of a
06:15 - condition
06:16 - depending on which level level they are
06:18 - so you can tie it up to another message
06:21 - so that the level the value of the level
06:23 - is already changed
06:24 - all right so we'll say when backdrop
06:25 - switches to backdrop
06:27 - two then we are going to set the
06:30 - position
06:31 - of the um hole okay we need to put it in
06:34 - the whole sprite
06:35 - all right so we'll say when backdrop
06:37 - switches to backdrop two
06:40 - then we are going to use the go to block
06:43 - and say go to x
06:46 - 120 and then y minus 90.
06:50 - all right let's try it okay so now we're
06:54 - in
06:54 - our second backdrop so let's go ahead
06:56 - and actually adjust it a little bit
06:59 - let's say i want it right here
07:03 - okay so that is 199
07:06 - and minus 123 for y
07:11 - okay and then for backdrop one let's
07:13 - have a look as well
07:17 - okay so for backdrop one we want it to
07:19 - be somewhere around here
07:21 - so in code we're going to say when
07:25 - backdrop switches to backdrop one we
07:28 - want to
07:29 - say x is 223 oh sorry that's 233
07:34 - and y is minus 23.
07:37 - all right let's try that so here i'm
07:39 - going to say
07:41 - okay so the hole holes in the correct
07:43 - position now we need to do the same
07:45 - thing for the ball
07:47 - so for the ball we're going to make sure
07:49 - they start in the beginning right here
07:51 - so for backdrop two let's have a look so
07:55 - say when backdrop switches to backdrop
07:57 - two
07:59 - we'll do go to x is
08:03 - minus 224 y is 111
08:06 - then let's do backdrop one again
08:09 - so for backdrop one we can make it
08:12 - somewhere around there
08:13 - so i believe we already have this code
08:16 - all right so when green flag click go to
08:18 - minus 175 and zero
08:21 - okay finally we can code the terrain so
08:24 - here we'll change change a little bit so
08:26 - we'll say if you touch the water
08:28 - trap it restarts the level so it goes
08:30 - back to the original position
08:32 - and if you touch the grass then we'll
08:34 - make it um to be
08:35 - you'll move slowly instead so the speed
08:37 - decreases
08:38 - so we're going to add those conditions
08:40 - before we move a certain amount of steps
08:42 - and change the speed so that they handle
08:44 - this before moving the ball
08:46 - and the most important one is when you
08:48 - touch the water you reset the position
08:51 - thus we'll use an if something something
08:53 - else something something blocks the code
08:55 - this sort of behavior
08:56 - all right so now we want to go back to
08:58 - the ball sprite and then add in the
09:00 - condition if something then something
09:03 - else
09:04 - and we grab that out here and then we're
09:07 - going to add in the condition
09:08 - so i can duplicate and then i'll say if
09:10 - touching the
09:12 - color water watercolor then
09:15 - we are going to set the speed so
09:19 - set speed to be
09:23 - negative 0.1
09:27 - and then we're also going to say all
09:29 - right if you are in level one
09:32 - so another if and then we'll say if
09:35 - level
09:36 - equals to one
09:43 - then what we're going to do is we're
09:44 - going to reset your position
09:47 - so we want to look at our position so
09:50 - that's 175
09:51 - and zero through this
09:57 - okay minus 17 75 and zero
10:00 - okay so if level equals to one then
10:02 - reset goes
10:04 - there but then if level equals to 2 so
10:07 - then we need to go to control and get
10:09 - another condition
10:13 - okay and then we'll duplicate this and
10:16 - say if level equals to two then we're
10:18 - going to a different
10:19 - part so duplicate this and put this one
10:22 - right here
10:24 - all right now for our else part what
10:26 - we're actually going to do is we're
10:28 - going to move the code we have
10:30 - right here so move speed steps change
10:33 - speed by minus 0.5 all of that
10:36 - we're gonna move it into our else now in
10:40 - the else part of this block we'll add an
10:42 - extra slow down if the ball is touching
10:44 - the grass trap and
10:46 - we're gonna do the color dropping then
10:48 - change the speed by an extra
10:50 - 0.2 so we're going to go
10:53 - first of all move our code back in into
10:56 - our repeat until and then in the else
11:00 - part we're going to add
11:02 - um another one let's say we put it right
11:05 - above here
11:07 - okay so we'll say if touching let's use
11:10 - our color dropper
11:12 - move it back into here okay if touching
11:14 - the color green
11:15 - then we are going to change the speed
11:19 - so change
11:23 - speed by minus 0.2
11:30 - all right so that's it for the coding of
11:32 - our mini golf
11:33 - scratch tutorial and that's all for
