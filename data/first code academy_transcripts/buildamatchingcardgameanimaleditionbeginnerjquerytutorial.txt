00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to our
00:01 - channel
00:03 - here you share between your friendly
00:04 - coding tutorials on scratch
00:06 - roblox minecraft web programming and
00:08 - many more
00:09 - so today we are going to create a card
00:11 - matching game with jquery
00:14 - so for this project we're just going to
00:16 - match the cards
00:17 - with the same animals inside
00:20 - if not it would just become incorrect so
00:23 - before i start
00:25 - just to let you know that jquery is a
00:27 - library that is part of the javascript
00:29 - for this everything is written in
00:31 - shortboard to follow along
00:33 - there is a starter code available for
00:35 - this project
00:36 - in which you can find in the description
00:38 - box below so let's get started
00:43 - okay so moving on to our coding part
00:46 - we can see that inside html css and gs
00:50 - there is already some built-in functions
00:52 - and there's a like um some of them
00:54 - already planned out
00:56 - all we have to do is actually fill in
00:57 - the blanks and inside css
01:00 - we're just going to create two new
01:01 - classes so moving on to our
01:03 - html first uh there are three classes um
01:08 - three of the classes actually represent
01:11 - the right result the wrong result and
01:13 - after we won the game
01:15 - so let's get started right first out
01:19 - wrong result for the class
01:22 - and one result
01:28 - that so
01:32 - all right next thing we're going to do
01:33 - is actually put the headings inside
01:36 - so what's the words inside so correct
01:40 - represents the right result incorrect
01:45 - represents the wrong result okay
01:48 - you won
01:52 - okay we finished our html class
01:55 - uh we can move on to our css so inside
01:57 - css we'll start with the part
01:59 - first uh we set our position to relative
02:04 - border is just going to be 10 pixels
02:07 - sorry double black
02:12 - width and height is going to be 300
02:15 - by 200
02:21 - and background color is just going to be
02:23 - gray so bb
02:25 - color is just going to be white so fff
02:28 - does play which is going to be flex
02:31 - justify content center
02:36 - as well as the align items so center
02:41 - all right so for the font size which is
02:43 - going to be
02:44 - 100 pixels for how
02:48 - vertical
02:52 - and margin is going to be five pixels
02:56 - float left cursor pointer
03:00 - okay we finished our cart class now
03:02 - we're going back we're going to our
03:04 - result
03:04 - able class our coordinate events screen
03:07 - is just going to be none and then cursor
03:09 - is just going to be
03:10 - um this we're going to just all out and
03:13 - not allowed
03:16 - so not allow
03:22 - for a cursor okay when our when we open
03:25 - our card we want to set our background
03:27 - color to white
03:31 - and our color just going to be red and
03:33 - box shadow which is going to be zero
03:35 - zero
03:36 - five pixels with the color
03:40 - grey like that and
03:46 - yeah so inside our result
03:51 - uh we want uh the z index is going to be
03:55 - two
03:55 - and then right color just going to be
03:58 - green ash color i'm just going to decide
04:00 - it's a line
04:01 - since it's like correct so and then for
04:04 - the wrong
04:05 - uh we're just going to do red and then
04:06 - the one color we're just going to set it
04:08 - to
04:09 - green okay so we finished
04:13 - all the blanks uh all we have to do now
04:15 - is actually create two more classes
04:17 - um one class is called cart dot
04:21 - dot car img which is the image of the
04:24 - car
04:25 - so we're just going to set position to
04:28 - relative
04:31 - and with
04:34 - a hundred percent height
04:38 - hundred percent and object
04:42 - fit
04:45 - oh contain
04:50 - says play block
04:54 - that all right so we finished our card
04:57 - img
04:58 - the last class we're going to create
05:00 - which is the headings class
05:02 - uh we're just going to set it something
05:04 - with these
05:05 - so h1
05:12 - right so for our h1 what we want to do
05:16 - is to set up the display
05:21 - to none and margin
05:25 - zero margin
05:29 - okay this is position
05:33 - absolute
05:36 - margin top
05:40 - 10 left
05:44 - us 30
05:48 - font size that's
05:51 - 100 pixels
05:54 - nope
05:59 - and font family
06:04 - ariel
06:08 - text shadow
06:12 - two pixels and then two pixels
06:16 - and then black like that
06:19 - so we finished uh our css part
06:23 - okay so after all these
06:27 - uh we can move on to our javascript
06:29 - which is the jquery part
06:31 - so inside javascript um
06:35 - we have um some of the functions
06:37 - generate cards card
06:38 - controls like that we're just going to
06:41 - uh
06:41 - play with these two functions so to
06:44 - begin
06:45 - um inside our generic cards um there's
06:48 - already a condition
06:49 - which is um well for
06:53 - i equal to zero i smaller than live
06:56 - cards.length
06:57 - um are i just going to add by one
07:01 - so which is like the card's number uh
07:03 - for the course number it's just going to
07:05 - be 12
07:05 - so as long as it's smaller than 12 and
07:08 - we're just going to add
07:10 - our card so we're just going to display
07:11 - the cards inside our
07:13 - game so the first line uh for our new
07:16 - card
07:16 - um this one is just going to be
07:19 - definitive
07:21 - so oops
07:33 - okay so for the text since uh
07:36 - every card is like a mystery for uh the
07:39 - players we're just going to
07:41 - set it to the question mark before it's
07:42 - flipped over
07:44 - and then the class is just going to be
07:46 - card
07:47 - and we're gonna add a new class for that
07:51 - and then the second one the attributes
07:53 - the cards i
07:54 - like that so this one is just going to
07:57 - be data animal so we can actually put
07:59 - our animals inside the card
08:04 - and then for the next thing uh which is
08:06 - like the elements
08:07 - id of the cards all right so we're just
08:09 - going to name it
08:10 - name it as id and then for the new card
08:14 - append to
08:15 - uh we're just going to set it as body
08:18 - right
08:18 - so we've finished our generate cards
08:20 - already so moving on we can actually go
08:23 - to
08:23 - our crotch control
08:27 - so first of all uh inside our cards
08:29 - control
08:30 - uh we have a variable card one and card
08:33 - two
08:34 - um inside our also which is like
08:36 - cartwheel cartridge
08:38 - actually the cards that we wanted to
08:40 - flip over with
08:41 - so yeah so quite wounding card too so
08:44 - uh inside this uh we have a con on click
08:47 - function
08:48 - so this function is like actually when
08:50 - you click on the card something which is
08:52 - gonna happen
08:53 - uh well we have two conditions uh we
08:55 - have to meet these
08:56 - two conditions before we click and then
08:58 - the car flip over
09:00 - so the first condition is uh if there's
09:03 - any car
09:04 - if there's any class in that inside this
09:06 - cloud is that inside the card so which
09:08 - means
09:09 - if there's like um well if there's a
09:12 - card already opened
09:14 - with that so we're just going to get the
09:17 - open
09:18 - class like that if there's a open class
09:21 - so
09:22 - and then the second one uh as a length
09:25 - so
09:25 - if the link okay so if there's no
09:28 - class open uh
09:32 - for the card we're just going to
09:34 - determine the second thing
09:35 - if uh the card length is just like
09:38 - smaller or equal
09:39 - smaller or equal to one so if there's
09:40 - only one card open
09:42 - like that uh if these two conditions met
09:45 - we're just going to add a new class
09:47 - better class and then
09:50 - open and then of course we have to
09:54 - oh whatever okay of course we have to do
09:56 - that this
09:58 - okay this class
10:01 - open like that so
10:05 - and then the second thing uh we're going
10:07 - to do is actually
10:08 - uh we're going to push our
10:12 - part to be like open it right like that
10:14 - so that's why we
10:15 - can do this again
10:18 - and then attribute
10:22 - oh and then we can get the
10:26 - data animal
10:31 - okay so for our card image we're going
10:34 - to create a new variable for saving the
10:36 - datas so we're just going to get the
10:39 - animals
10:45 - and then
10:48 - this attribute
10:53 - data
10:56 - and like that
11:01 - so this is the chronology so the next
11:03 - thing we're going to do is to if there's
11:05 - like two cards open we're just going to
11:07 - check if they are having the same value
11:09 - so this is for checking if that's the
11:13 - same value
11:14 - so which is checking to image
11:18 - so which is that's why image
11:21 - src oh no not yet
11:25 - equals and then
11:28 - [Music]
11:35 - okay so fine
11:40 - mg
11:43 - so which is the variable we created
11:46 - earlier so
11:49 - and then oh
11:53 - and then
11:58 - and then i'm just going to get the
12:01 - closing bracket
12:03 - and that's it
12:08 - all right so that's it i have to double
12:11 - check for the
12:12 - brackets sorry about that okay moving on
12:17 - to the um next condition
12:20 - if the open length is equal to uh which
12:23 - is
12:24 - when there's two cards open we have to
12:27 - check
12:27 - if they have the same card or they're
12:30 - not having the same card so
12:31 - now um we're just going to
12:36 - make the open well to get too variable
12:39 - the cartridge is going to get the
12:40 - uh array of opened uh we're just going
12:44 - to get a server index
12:45 - and uh the second one just going to
12:48 - differ
12:49 - they're going to be the first index so
12:51 - like that so if part one is circle
12:53 - part two we just write so we're just
12:56 - going to get the right
12:58 - um class from css and then we're
13:02 - just going to show something and then
13:04 - theta which is going to be slow
13:06 - so instead of popping up of nowhere
13:09 - okay so the next thing we're going to do
13:13 - uh we're just going to after it sounds
13:15 - like it's correct
13:16 - we wanted to remove the card inside our
13:19 - arraylist
13:20 - and move on to our next steps so car
13:23 - so card again plus again we're going to
13:27 - remove the class disable that
13:33 - like that okay so well
13:36 - uh the next thing we're going to check
13:38 - is to uh check if the length is equal to
13:40 - 12 which is actually
13:42 - um the like one
13:45 - one function so if actually uh 12 of the
13:47 - cards is already opened
13:49 - um so card
13:52 - dot open like that
13:56 - so if card.open oh
14:02 - so car dot open
14:05 - length is equal to 12. uh we're just
14:08 - going to get the one
14:10 - class from css and we're just going to
14:13 - make it into slow
14:14 - for fade out again else
14:18 - so if that's the wrong thing so which
14:21 - which is like either of these uh
14:24 - condition is wrong
14:25 - as false we're just going to set it to
14:28 - wrong
14:32 - and fade out is also slow oh
14:35 - i'm using the full stop slot
14:39 - like that okay so
14:42 - uh okay so inside the set timer function
14:46 - uh we're just going to set our timer to
14:48 - after one second
14:50 - uh we're just going to flip our wrong
14:52 - parts
14:53 - and we're just going to remove our open
14:56 - and
14:56 - we're just going to set back our cards
14:59 - to
15:00 - question mark if we put the wrong
15:03 - cards so remove our class
15:08 - and set back to question mark same for
15:12 - the second
15:13 - card and that
15:16 - all right so uh we of course we have to
15:19 - remove our class too
15:22 - so far a move
15:25 - class disable
15:29 - so yeah that's it so for our shuffle uh
15:32 - actually we finish everything for the
15:34 - actual
15:35 - shuffle uh function and yeah
15:38 - that's it uh we can now try it out for
15:41 - our
15:42 - game let's drag this up
15:46 - okay we can see all the cards here
15:49 - showing up everything
15:55 - all right there are some buggy things
15:58 - happening
15:59 - so it's great now i can see it up
16:02 - see what happens inside my gs so
16:07 - well in some ideas uh definitely
16:09 - something's wrong
16:10 - so let's check
16:15 - open push this oh yeah
16:20 - spell a mistake that's
16:24 - always the bug that i come through
16:27 - okay so now we can try okay that works
16:30 - right now
16:31 - okay so
16:35 - yeah that's correct and then now i can
16:37 - move on to
16:38 - links up okay it's incorrect
16:41 - let's see okay
16:45 - ah okay all right so probably this one
16:48 - oh know
16:50 - so frog and then lastly mouse
16:54 - so that's it that's actually the game uh
16:56 - we finished our game
16:57 - and this is the result so that's a
17:00 - pretty
17:00 - great in this general room we created a
17:03 - card matching game with the use of
17:04 - jquery
17:05 - jquery is a mini library of javascript
17:08 - which allows you to write code
17:10 - but in a more quicker and simple fly way
