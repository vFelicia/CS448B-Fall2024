00:00 - hello everybody welcome to first code
00:02 - academy and today we're going to do a
00:04 - tutorial on thunkable
00:06 - called gingerbread cookie clicker so in
00:09 - this project i will be using thunkable
00:11 - to create an app that will allow me to
00:14 - play
00:15 - a christmas version of the game cookie
00:18 - clicker
00:18 - in the game cookie clicker the objective
00:20 - is to bake as many cookies as you can
00:22 - by tapping the little cookie men
00:27 - so i'm tapping here and i'm getting
00:28 - every one cookie every time i tap it
00:31 - you'll see that there's two extra
00:32 - buttons the upgrade button which allows
00:35 - me
00:36 - to purchase and upgrade to get more
00:38 - cookies per click
00:40 - and the save button which allows me to
00:44 - save my progress so if i close the app
00:46 - and i open it again
00:48 - i will retrieve the same values you can
00:51 - find the link to the thunkable page
00:53 - in the description down below now let's
00:55 - go into coding it
00:56 - so today we're gonna divide the process
01:00 - of making the app into two steps
01:02 - the first step we're gonna design how
01:04 - the app looks and in the second step
01:06 - we're gonna
01:07 - build the blocks for the app to work
01:10 - so let's go straight into the first step
01:12 - we open a new thunkable project
01:15 - i already named it cookie clicker i'm
01:18 - gonna
01:18 - [Music]
01:20 - do is make it resemble what i just
01:22 - showed you before
01:23 - so the first thing is we want it to be
01:25 - christmas themed
01:27 - so i'm gonna change the colors to some
01:29 - red and some green
01:31 - so i'm gonna use red for the background
01:34 - and i'm gonna use green for the letters
01:37 - and the buttons
01:39 - now the most important part well besides
01:41 - the christmas message i'm gonna put a
01:43 - label over here
01:45 - i'm also gonna need an image to
01:48 - put the cookie inside so i scroll down
01:52 - here
01:53 - all the way to image and i can add it
01:55 - down here
01:57 - you'll see that in this case the image
02:00 - shows
02:00 - above the label you can actually change
02:04 - the order here
02:05 - by dragging them and whichever is at the
02:08 - bottom is the one that's going to show
02:09 - at the bottom of the screen
02:12 - i'm going to proceed by adding another
02:14 - label down here which is the one that is
02:16 - going to tell me how many cookies i have
02:18 - all the same i want it down here so i'm
02:21 - gonna put it here
02:23 - and two buttons one next to the other
02:28 - now if i try to put the buttons just
02:31 - like this
02:32 - bottom one and bottom two for example
02:35 - and
02:36 - i'm gonna drag it down for example
02:39 - well i have a button here i have a label
02:42 - that i don't need so
02:44 - i'm just gonna delete this one but
02:47 - yes i want to delete that one i want
02:50 - another button
02:52 - here you see that the buttons are one on
02:55 - top of the other
02:56 - and there's a really a simple way to
02:58 - just tell
03:00 - thunkable hey i want you to be one next
03:02 - to the other one because
03:04 - they try to keep things simple and just
03:06 - put objects
03:08 - in a straight line down there but they
03:12 - to fix this in layouts they have
03:15 - something called rows and columns
03:17 - just like a table so if you put objects
03:19 - in a row it will put them
03:21 - one next to your horizontally if you put
03:24 - objects in a column it will group them
03:26 - vertically so i want just to group them
03:29 - horizontally i'll just
03:31 - just add a rover here i'm gonna put it
03:33 - down here
03:35 - and to make them belong to the row
03:38 - i can just drag them in a way that is
03:40 - inside you'll see that there's a red
03:42 - little border next to where it says row
03:45 - here
03:46 - that means that i'm putting the button
03:47 - inside the row i'm going to do the same
03:49 - but i put it below here so you put it
03:52 - one next to the other
03:53 - now you see that my row is way too big
03:56 - it occupies almost
03:58 - all of the screen i'm going to change
04:00 - the height
04:01 - here and put an absolute size of
04:05 - 150 of course you can change that
04:08 - depending on what you want you can put
04:10 - 100 and you will
04:12 - adjust it differently now for the labels
04:16 - well i'm going to change the texts of
04:18 - course
04:19 - here merry christmas
04:22 - and here remember we sent the message
04:26 - you have baked
04:29 - zero cookies because of course you
04:32 - haven't played yet
04:33 - so there's no cookies baked
04:36 - for the image down here i looked for a
04:39 - gingerbread
04:40 - man image png download the one you like
04:44 - the most i use png because they have
04:46 - no background so when i put it down here
04:49 - let's see i already have it in my
04:51 - computer
04:53 - so when i put the cookie here see
04:57 - what usually would look white it still
05:01 - looks red
05:01 - because i have no background so it just
05:04 - copies the same color as my background
05:06 - now for the merry christmas message i
05:09 - can go to advanced
05:11 - and change the text style i can change
05:14 - here the color
05:14 - i'm gonna put a dark green i'm gonna
05:17 - make sure to remember
05:18 - this color maybe here it's gonna copy
05:22 - this code
05:25 - and use that code to change the color of
05:28 - this one as well
05:29 - so i can put here and paste that color
05:31 - in the hex file
05:34 - the same as with the button i can go
05:36 - back to simple i think this one is
05:38 - easier here
05:40 - oh wait sorry not the test color the
05:44 - background color
05:48 - i can put here and this one as well
05:53 - and i want let's say a different
05:57 - style for the merry christmas message i
05:58 - want to make it more
06:00 - more good looking i can
06:03 - put in the fun family here in advanced i
06:06 - can choose different fonts
06:08 - which fonts can i choose well you can go
06:10 - to the documentation for
06:13 - thunkable and you'll see a list of all
06:15 - the fonts available
06:16 - unfortunate unfortunately for android
06:18 - there's not many fonts
06:20 - for ios there's a huge list of phones
06:22 - and since i'm testing my app in ios i
06:25 - thought that i
06:25 - could use this font over here the last
06:28 - one
06:29 - sapphino i like how it looks it gives
06:31 - like a very
06:32 - holiday by and i can
06:35 - make it bigger with font size and
06:38 - i'm gonna put it bold
06:41 - i can even put something more old like
06:43 - 300
06:45 - or maybe 500 okay
06:48 - and yeah that's it i'm gonna put this
06:51 - one as well
06:52 - bold i can just do it in simple
06:55 - here font weight bold
06:59 - all right oh of course i i still need to
07:02 - change the text of my buttons
07:04 - so here i'll put upgrade
07:07 - and then the cost of my first upgrade
07:11 - 25 and in here i'm gonna make a bottom
07:14 - to save the game so if i close the app
07:16 - and i open it again
07:18 - well i can keep making the cookies i
07:20 - already had before
07:22 - and that's pretty much it for the design
07:26 - so right now we're gonna move into the
07:29 - blocks
07:31 - so right now i already set up some
07:34 - initial
07:35 - values to work with blocks and to
07:39 - add these values right i grab the blocks
07:42 - from the variables blocks
07:44 - okay i initialize three variables
07:48 - of type app these variables when i close
07:51 - the program they will disappear forever
07:54 - and they will when i open the app again
07:57 - they will set up to these initial values
07:58 - i have over here
08:00 - cookies well it's how many cookies i
08:02 - have i think i better just set it up to
08:04 - zero
08:06 - cookies per click sorry i think i i put
08:09 - it backwards
08:10 - sorry for cookies per click is how many
08:12 - cookies i get
08:13 - for each click for each top of the
08:15 - bottom i do
08:16 - into the cookie and the upgrade cost is
08:19 - how much is it gonna cost for me
08:21 - to get more cookies per click i do i
08:26 - also have the same
08:27 - variables but of the store type
08:31 - so stored to for me to recognize that
08:34 - they're different i put them stored
08:36 - under dash cookies
08:37 - start under dash cpz and stored under
08:40 - the upgrade cost so
08:43 - stored variables are the variables that
08:46 - are saved in the memory of the
08:47 - cell phone so when you close the app
08:51 - and you open it again you can find these
08:54 - values
08:55 - all right the reason i did two of them
08:58 - is because usually
09:00 - for a phone it's slower to get the
09:02 - values
09:03 - from the sort space than it is from the
09:06 - app space
09:08 - however you can uh
09:11 - change these values accordingly if you
09:13 - don't really like one or the other or if
09:14 - you
09:15 - think you made an upgrade that you
09:17 - didn't want like if the game gets too
09:19 - complicated
09:20 - and somebody wants to save or
09:22 - [Music]
09:23 - not save it's good for us to learn
09:26 - that there's two different types of
09:28 - variables that can be used for different
09:29 - situations so for example the app
09:31 - variable
09:32 - can be used if you want the value to be
09:36 - used rapidly and disappear maybe some
09:39 - time
09:40 - whereas the stored variable is a
09:42 - variable that you may want to use
09:44 - repeatedly later okay
09:47 - so the first thing and the most basic
09:50 - thing we need to do in this app
09:52 - is when i click the image of the
09:53 - gingerbread man
09:55 - i'm gonna get a new cookie so
09:58 - let's go here into image and grab this
10:00 - block when image one click
10:02 - so whenever i click the gingerbread man
10:04 - i will get a new cookie
10:07 - and how do i get well
10:11 - if i have cpc value of one means how
10:14 - many cookies i get per click to one
10:16 - i'll get one more cookie but if i bought
10:18 - an upgrade
10:20 - and now i get two cookies every time i
10:22 - click i should
10:24 - still get the two cookies not just one
10:26 - every time i click this button
10:28 - to do that well we're gonna change the
10:30 - value of this variable
10:32 - of the cookies i have by how many
10:34 - cookies i get
10:35 - every time i click the image
10:38 - so in variables we have the initialize
10:42 - variable which means the initial value
10:45 - of the variable
10:46 - which i already put down there set
10:49 - the value to something specific or
10:52 - change it by a certain number
10:54 - i'm gonna grab this one and put it down
10:58 - here
10:59 - so i'm gonna change the app variable
11:00 - cookies by how much
11:03 - well is this block over here cpc
11:06 - so i can go to variables and grab this
11:09 - app variable cpc block and put it down
11:11 - here
11:13 - that i have a new cookie i want to
11:15 - update
11:17 - the label the remember the label down
11:19 - here that says
11:20 - you have baked zero cookies
11:23 - this one in this case is label two
11:26 - so i can go back here in blocks
11:29 - click on label two from label to set
11:33 - text to now the text will read
11:36 - you have number baked
11:40 - and cookies baked so far okay
11:43 - so you have or you have baked number
11:46 - cookies
11:47 - the message is of course up to you you
11:50 - can make it a little bit different
11:52 - that's still fine what we're gonna do is
11:54 - we're gonna join
11:55 - three messages right you have baked
11:58 - the number and cookies
12:02 - so i'm gonna use this block join in the
12:04 - text category
12:08 - if i click on the gear i can join more
12:10 - than one two texts
12:12 - so i'm gonna make it so i joined three
12:14 - so remember the first one
12:15 - is gonna be you have baked
12:20 - the second one i'm gonna leave it empty
12:21 - for the number and the third one i'm
12:23 - gonna put cookies
12:26 - now in the middle one how many cookies
12:27 - have i baked
12:29 - that one is the variable i get from here
12:32 - cookies
12:32 - so you have baked up variable cookies
12:36 - quiz and that's how we display the value
12:42 - next thing we need we're gonna do is
12:45 - we're gonna set the upgrade button
12:48 - this button over here when i click it
12:50 - will allow me to
12:52 - if i have the enough cookies get more
12:55 - cookies for every click i make
12:58 - so let's start this one is button one
13:02 - so when i click button one something
13:03 - else is bound to happen
13:06 - what's it well what needs to happen well
13:09 - first i need to ask
13:10 - do i have enough cookies to get the
13:13 - better
13:13 - cooking machine so i can get two cookies
13:16 - every time i click it
13:18 - or are my cookies not enough
13:21 - to ask questions like this in
13:22 - programming remember
13:24 - we use if statements we're going to grab
13:28 - this if statement over here
13:29 - and indeed in that if statement in this
13:31 - section
13:33 - ways where the question will be do i
13:35 - have enough cookies
13:36 - or i don't have enough cookies so the
13:39 - answer for this one is for example
13:41 - if my cost is 25 for me to have enough
13:45 - cookies would be if i have 25 cookies 26
13:47 - cookies 27 cookies
13:50 - or more so you have if i have more
13:52 - cookies than what the opera
13:54 - costs i can make the upgrade
13:57 - to do this you'll notice that thunkable
14:00 - has this
14:02 - greater than less than equal then
14:05 - but it doesn't have any credit equal
14:09 - unless you click on it so you have to
14:12 - grab
14:13 - any of those and search for it directly
14:16 - you don't just get it from here
14:17 - okay so we're gonna have if a value
14:20 - is greater equal than another value if
14:23 - my cookies i have
14:24 - are bigger than what the cost of the
14:27 - upgrade is
14:29 - then i will do the upgrade
14:33 - here i have how many cookies i have and
14:35 - if that value is bigger than
14:38 - a variable upgrade cost how much an
14:40 - upgrade costs
14:42 - then okay first of all
14:46 - if i have 30 cookies and the upgrade is
14:49 - 25
14:51 - if i purchase the upgrade i should have
14:53 - only five cookies
14:55 - after that the purchase is done so i
14:58 - will first
14:59 - set this new variable cookies and take
15:03 - away
15:04 - from the number of cookies the cost of
15:06 - the upgrade
15:07 - so to do any type of these operations we
15:12 - go to math here
15:13 - and we're subtracting right we're
15:16 - subtracting
15:18 - the number of cookies we have
15:22 - and taking away from that the cost of
15:25 - the upgrade
15:26 - if you see that because we have this
15:28 - check in place
15:30 - the cookies will never go negative you
15:32 - will always have enough cookies
15:34 - if you want to do this operation after
15:37 - that
15:38 - well we have an upgrade right so what
15:40 - are what are we upgrading
15:43 - well sorry not this one we're upgrading
15:46 - the value
15:47 - of the cookies per click so we're
15:50 - changing the value of the cookies per
15:52 - click
15:53 - on the app by one so if i did
15:56 - two cookies per click now i'll do three
15:58 - coopies per click
16:00 - and so on now
16:03 - the upgrades will make it so that they
16:05 - become more expensive the more of them i
16:08 - buy
16:09 - so i'm gonna change the variable
16:13 - of this upgrade cost by
16:16 - if i do change by some number
16:20 - then in a way i'm i'm basing it
16:24 - off a certain like solid number what i
16:26 - can do is if i want to make it
16:28 - harder and harder to get more upgrades
16:30 - so people get more interested in keeping
16:32 - in playing more and more i can change it
16:35 - by my own number
16:36 - so if i cost 25 i'm the upgrade i cost
16:40 - 25
16:41 - for the next upgrade i'm going to cost
16:42 - 50. so add 25 to myself
16:45 - 25 plus 25 50. for the next upgrade
16:48 - cycle
16:49 - i cost 50 then i myself 50 now i cost a
16:52 - hundred
16:53 - and then i keep going like this until it
16:55 - gets very expensive and people are more
16:57 - invested into playing
16:59 - so this is just one example of course
17:02 - you can
17:03 - do it in a different way but i think in
17:06 - this way
17:06 - you will get double double double the
17:08 - upgrade cost so it's becoming harder and
17:10 - harder more of a challenge to get the
17:12 - number higher and higher
17:15 - the last thing we're gonna do is
17:18 - i'm going to change the text of the
17:20 - button right
17:22 - and change the text of the label
17:26 - so first that label over here remember
17:28 - is label 2.
17:31 - it's the same value we have here so i
17:32 - can just duplicate this
17:34 - block right click duplicate
17:37 - and put it down here so i do the same
17:41 - thing
17:42 - where i show the message of how many
17:43 - cookies i have left
17:45 - and i will change the text of the bottom
17:48 - one
17:49 - too remember the text of this one is
17:53 - upgrade and how many cookies
17:56 - it costs to do the upgrade so i'll keep
17:59 - it that way
18:00 - i have two values upgrade and how much
18:02 - it costs
18:03 - so i'll use a join block i'll put it
18:06 - down here
18:08 - i'll replace this hello with upgrade
18:12 - and the second one i'll just throw it
18:14 - here because i need the cost
18:15 - of the cookies upgrade so
18:19 - the cost perfect so this one will
18:23 - resolve the upgrade button now we have
18:25 - one more button left
18:26 - to code the bottom we have left is
18:30 - to store the variable right to store
18:32 - these variables
18:34 - these app variables into the stored part
18:37 - of the program
18:38 - so that when we open the program again
18:40 - we can access those values
18:42 - so when i click that button which is
18:46 - button number two
18:49 - i'm gonna save these variables these
18:51 - local app variables
18:53 - into the stored variables so we'll
18:57 - set the value of the stored variable
19:00 - for example stored cookies to
19:03 - the variable cookies
19:07 - i can duplicate this so i can save more
19:09 - work
19:12 - and change store variable cookies start
19:14 - cpc
19:15 - will get the value of cpc and stored
19:19 - upgrade cost will get the very
19:20 - the value of app of recast
19:24 - this way i saved it into the storage of
19:26 - the cell phone
19:28 - and i can access it later
19:31 - so to finish the program of course we
19:33 - want to access it
19:34 - if i close the app and i open it again i
19:37 - want to read those values again
19:40 - i'll go over here to screen
19:44 - one and when the screen opens
19:47 - or when the screen starts until when the
19:50 - screen starts
19:52 - if the values of the star variables are
19:54 - not
19:56 - zero right or are not empty if i have
19:59 - something inside of them
20:01 - then i want to actually use those values
20:04 - because what will happen if those values
20:07 - are not
20:08 - like uh are not the initial ones then
20:12 - there's a problem you know if you have
20:15 - zero cookies per click and you start
20:17 - clicking
20:18 - on the cookie you'll just see zero zero
20:20 - zero zero zero like if you're not doing
20:22 - anything
20:23 - you need to make sure that when you load
20:24 - those values there's actually a value
20:26 - that makes sense there
20:29 - to do that well the value we curve
20:32 - the most about would be how many cookies
20:35 - you get per click
20:38 - so if
20:41 - and we'll do a comparison
20:44 - if the cookies i do per click is bigger
20:46 - than zero
20:47 - so if store variable
20:51 - cookies per click is bigger than zero
20:56 - [Music]
20:59 - or bigger than zero bigger than one
21:02 - basically it's up to you i think bigger
21:06 - than zero
21:06 - makes it so that there's at least
21:09 - something maybe they did like three
21:11 - cookies and they want to save
21:13 - so so it doesn't make much sense that
21:15 - you punish them for not cooking enough
21:17 - baking enough cookies or maybe they
21:19 - upgraded all the way to 11
21:21 - the level 10 then they did them last
21:23 - purchase and now they have zero cookies
21:25 - if you try to compare with the cookies
21:27 - and they will lose all their progress
21:29 - so i think cpc is a better measurement
21:32 - because when you first create these
21:35 - stored variables they have no value so
21:37 - if at least if their value is bigger
21:38 - than zero you know they have played and
21:40 - saved once
21:42 - so if that value is okay then we'll do
21:44 - the reverse of this operation
21:46 - so instead of getting from the app
21:48 - variable to the start variable
21:49 - we'll get the value from the start
21:51 - variable and save it into the app
21:53 - variable so i can just duplicate this
21:58 - i'll just put this down here i don't
22:00 - need this button too anymore
22:02 - and change the order so app variable
22:05 - cookies will get the value from store
22:07 - cookies
22:08 - app variable cpc will get the value from
22:11 - stored cpc
22:12 - and app variable upgrade cost will get
22:15 - the
22:15 - value from start upgrade cost
22:19 - and that's pretty much it for this app
22:26 - okay so i have the project open up down
22:28 - here
22:29 - and this is the finished product
22:33 - so you see i can get more cookies
22:36 - here the cookies and i'm getting one per
22:38 - click i'm going to upgrade
22:42 - and i will get super click
22:47 - keep operating
22:50 - i have 40 then i have 80.
22:54 - next is 160 but now i'm getting
22:57 - more cookies per click
23:02 - hmm keep going keep going keep going and
23:04 - now i get 5x5
23:07 - okay i really hope you enjoyed this
23:09 - project like this little
23:11 - christmas project you can show to your
23:12 - family and friends
