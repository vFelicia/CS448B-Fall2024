00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to our
00:01 - channel here we share beginner friendly
00:04 - coding tutorials on scratch roblox
00:07 - minecraft
00:08 - web programming and many more today
00:10 - we're going to build
00:11 - a cabin in minecraft
00:15 - so in this project we'll be creating a
00:16 - cabin in minecraft
00:18 - the cabin is going to contain some beds
00:21 - some furnaces
00:22 - and maybe a chest to make it very cozy
00:25 - and
00:26 - it's a place that we can call home here
00:28 - we'll have um
00:30 - different blocks to make it look like a
00:32 - real cabin
00:34 - and that will make use of different
00:35 - materials and make sure the cabin looks
00:37 - nice
00:38 - so yeah let's get started
00:44 - so let's begin this project by going to
00:47 - our minecraft
00:48 - and go to single player here we're gonna
00:52 - create a new world
00:54 - and we're gonna name this world to be
00:56 - minecraft
00:57 - cabin next
01:00 - let's change the game mode to creative
01:03 - so we can use items for free as well as
01:06 - free flying
01:08 - and we're going to change the difficulty
01:09 - to peaceful so no mobs can
01:12 - attack us while we're building um
01:15 - additionally i'm gonna change
01:17 - um the world types and more world
01:19 - options
01:20 - and i'm gonna change the world type to
01:22 - super flats so it makes it a lot easier
01:24 - for us to build
01:26 - and we're going to click on create world
01:32 - so after our world has been generated
01:34 - let's click
01:35 - e to open our inventory and i'm going to
01:37 - grab the strip log
01:39 - from our uh inventory
01:42 - so there are two ways to put down this
01:45 - log
01:46 - and depending on how you put it down the
01:48 - texture might be different
01:49 - so the one way you can do it is placing
01:51 - it face up
01:52 - as you can see these um the face of the
01:55 - lock is facing upward
01:57 - or you can also place it to the side
01:58 - where this
02:00 - top of the log is facing to the side and
02:02 - as you can see on the side it looks a
02:03 - little bit different
02:04 - because the textures are placed uh
02:07 - differently
02:09 - so what we're gonna do is actually put
02:11 - down
02:12 - an eight by eight square using the logs
02:15 - and um what i'm gonna do is on the four
02:17 - corners of that
02:18 - uh square i'm gonna have to lock face up
02:21 - while the edges
02:22 - and the walls on the sides is going to
02:23 - be facing the side
02:25 - so here i'm going to put down one block
02:28 - and since we're going to be an eight by
02:30 - eight we should have six block in the
02:31 - middle that are sideways followed by two
02:33 - blocks on each side
02:34 - facing up so here one and then i need
02:37 - six blocks so one two
02:38 - three four five six and then one more
02:42 - block facing up
02:43 - with a total of eight blocks like that
02:46 - and i'm gonna do um the rest of the side
02:49 - so here i have
02:50 - one two three four five six followed by
02:54 - one block up
02:56 - and again one two three four five
02:59 - six followed by one block facing up
03:02 - and then just connect the points here
03:07 - so now we have an 8x8 square
03:11 - next let's go over to the corner blocks
03:14 - and add
03:15 - a four block pillars so here i'm gonna
03:17 - add four more blocks on each corner so
03:20 - one two three four
03:24 - go over to the other corner and put down
03:27 - four blocks
03:31 - and uh to make sure that the blocks are
03:34 - facing up i'm going to be placing it
03:36 - as i'm jumping up so that the blocks are
03:38 - going to be facing upward
03:41 - just like so now let's connect the top
03:45 - of the pillars together
03:47 - using the similar techniques as we did
03:49 - here
03:50 - so here we're gonna have six blocks
03:51 - going across facing the side
03:55 - and we're gonna do that to uh all four
03:58 - sides
03:59 - at the top of the pillars here
04:05 - awesome
04:10 - just like that and uh
04:15 - here we're gonna go over again to the
04:16 - four corners um
04:18 - top and bottom and at the corner blocks
04:20 - there are two sides we're gonna put a
04:22 - block on each side like that
04:24 - and we're gonna do the same thing at the
04:25 - top so each corner should have two
04:28 - blocks sticking out um on the side
04:30 - at the corner blocks like that and we
04:33 - will do this for all four corners
04:37 - so just put down two blocks at each side
04:39 - of um
04:40 - the corner blocks
04:46 - and uh this should be the basic um
04:48 - structure
04:50 - and foundation of our cabin
04:53 - next let's go over to the corner blocks
04:55 - and add
04:57 - a four block pillars so here i'm gonna
04:59 - add four more blocks on each corner so
05:01 - one two three four
05:05 - over to the other corner and put down
05:08 - four blocks
05:12 - and uh to make sure that the blocks are
05:16 - facing up i'm gonna be placing it
05:18 - as i'm jumping up so that the blocks are
05:20 - going to be facing upward
05:23 - just like so now let's connect the top
05:27 - of the pillars together
05:28 - using the similar techniques as we did
05:30 - here
05:31 - so here we're gonna have six blocks
05:33 - going across facing the side
05:36 - and we're gonna do that to uh all four
05:40 - sides
05:40 - at the top of the pillars here
05:50 - awesome
05:52 - just like that and uh
05:56 - here we're gonna go over again to the
05:58 - four corners um
05:59 - top and bottom and next let's go back to
06:03 - our inventory and grab our scratch log
06:06 - here i'm gonna go inside of our
06:09 - foundation
06:10 - and i'm gonna put um five blocks like
06:13 - this on the corner
06:15 - of each side so here one two
06:18 - three four five and they should be the
06:20 - same height
06:22 - as our foundation we made here so
06:25 - in all four corners i'm gonna start by
06:27 - placing five blocks high
06:32 - and then similar to what we did um on
06:35 - the edge we're gonna have
06:37 - uh blocks connecting it to the bottom
06:39 - like this
06:41 - and if we do this for all four sides as
06:46 - well
06:49 - and make sure the logs are facing the
06:50 - direct same direction so um
06:53 - here i'm gonna change that awesome and
06:56 - i'm gonna do the same thing at the top
07:06 - oops
07:11 - and finally i'm going to do the same
07:12 - thing to all four sides in the middle so
07:14 - here we see that there's three blocks
07:16 - and we're gonna get to the middle block
07:19 - and we're gonna go across like this
07:24 - and we'll do this again for all four
07:28 - sides
07:34 - our foundation now should look something
07:35 - like this
07:37 - next let's go over to our inventory
07:40 - again
07:41 - and i'm gonna go to search items and
07:42 - gonna look up glass
07:44 - here we're gonna look for the stained
07:46 - glass panes
07:47 - and here we can grab any color we want
07:49 - um since we're four sides i'm just gonna
07:51 - grab um
07:52 - two different colors and i'm gonna have
07:56 - blue at the top and
08:00 - line for the bottom so here i'm gonna go
08:02 - across
08:04 - this
08:07 - so put down the glass panes at the gaps
08:10 - that we see between the logs
08:12 - and i'll do the same thing on the bottom
08:16 - and again you can choose any colors that
08:17 - you see fit
08:23 - okay and now let's pick a side
08:26 - um any side could be the front door so
08:30 - i'm gonna pick this side right here
08:32 - so we'll begin by skipping a block
08:35 - and mining um this out
08:38 - and since there's a glass here i'm gonna
08:40 - remove this glass as well and just
08:41 - replace it with
08:43 - another log like so and let's go back to
08:46 - our inventory and i'm gonna look up
08:48 - door here i'm gonna grab the oak door
08:53 - and placed it in front of here just like
08:56 - so
08:58 - so now let's focus and do the roof of
09:01 - our cabin
09:02 - we'll begin by adding some ports so here
09:06 - let's go to our inventory we're going to
09:08 - look upstairs
09:09 - and get the quartz stairs and we're now
09:12 - going to look up
09:13 - chords so we can just have q u
09:16 - and that should be the smooth quartz
09:18 - block that we're looking for here
09:21 - now as you can see we have this outer
09:23 - layer of um
09:25 - stripped oak log uh we're gonna place
09:28 - our cord blocks around this border
09:32 - without putting it on the two blocks
09:34 - that we added to the side so here
09:37 - we'll just add of course this
09:43 - and now fill in the middle this will be
09:45 - our roof off our cabin
09:55 - okay and let's look at the sides of our
09:59 - door before you fill this
10:00 - end and um as you can see that there are
10:04 - if you mind that these three blocks um
10:06 - with
10:07 - the spread logs we have um
10:10 - four blocks across from each side we're
10:13 - gonna
10:13 - pick the two sides that are one of them
10:17 - with the uh including the door and the
10:20 - wall
10:20 - across from it and we're gonna mined up
10:23 - the two blocks
10:24 - like this as shown and we're gonna
10:27 - replace it we're gonna go into inventory
10:30 - and look up oak plank and i already have
10:32 - in my inventory
10:33 - and i'm gonna place it down like so
10:37 - and the rest of the area we can feel
10:39 - back
10:40 - with uh quartz so again to repeat that
10:43 - um
10:44 - the side that we have a door and the
10:45 - opposite to it we're gonna mined out
10:47 - two blocks uh right above the sprout
10:50 - logs
10:51 - like so and now we're gonna put five
10:54 - more blocks
10:55 - um on top of these so one two
10:58 - three four five
11:02 - do the same thing here one
11:05 - two three four
11:08 - five and now i'm gonna link them
11:10 - together
11:11 - at the very top and as well
11:15 - on the sides i'm gonna add two more
11:17 - blocks so it goes over
11:18 - by one block like so
11:23 - now we're gonna use our court stairs
11:26 - and uh we're gonna start at the front of
11:29 - the base
11:30 - so here on the sides where we have
11:34 - uh the extra blocks i'm gonna go
11:37 - down and try to put it upside down like
11:39 - that so it's key that we aim at the high
11:42 - upper half of this lock to make this go
11:45 - upside down
11:46 - and on top we're going to put down the
11:47 - stairs like this so we have this
11:50 - upside down stairs like that and this
11:53 - would be the pattern for our roof
11:55 - so here i'm gonna do the same thing but
11:57 - the opposite side
11:58 - and we're gonna bend it in um so only
12:01 - this block will be facing outward all
12:03 - the other ones will be facing inward
12:05 - on the bottom like this
12:08 - like so and i'm gonna keep doing
12:13 - it on this side until i reach the middle
12:18 - which is right here and now i'm gonna go
12:21 - on this side and do the same thing so
12:23 - again i'm gonna look
12:24 - at the upper half of this log to make
12:26 - sure it places
12:28 - um the stairs upside down places there
12:31 - on top of that and then follow the same
12:35 - pattern as we did on the other side
12:38 - we're gonna have the bottom with upside
12:40 - down blocks facing inside
12:44 - that on top of that we have stairs
12:47 - facing upward
12:50 - and um i keep going until we connect
12:53 - um to the middle where we have
12:58 - done on the other side like this and at
13:01 - the very top
13:02 - we have two upwards showing so here i'm
13:04 - gonna put um
13:06 - upside down stairs like so
13:11 - and here you can actually come up with
13:13 - uh whatever design you want you can
13:15 - do something like this or you can even
13:17 - do something like um
13:19 - just two stairs
13:23 - like so um
13:26 - actually this i think looks a little bit
13:28 - cleaner so let's do this
13:31 - and um as you can see we haven't done
13:33 - anything in here so here we can actually
13:35 - do a little bit of um
13:37 - artwork with our stairs as well so if
13:39 - you want you can actually just add a
13:42 - bunch of stairs like this
13:43 - so i'm gonna do inward stairs like that
13:47 - followed by
13:50 - just normal not upside down stairs like
13:52 - this and then maybe stairs like here
13:56 - and then i'll put some stairs here
14:01 - and uh some upside down stairs maybe
14:04 - like this
14:09 - maybe one more search like that
14:13 - okay and do the same thing here
14:28 - awesome
14:30 - and this will be the front and let's
14:33 - also add
14:34 - some stairs at the very front like here
14:40 - just like so
14:43 - and um i'm going to follow this pattern
14:46 - and do the same thing
14:47 - on the back side of this uh the base
14:51 - so here i once again put down upside
14:54 - down
14:54 - stairs followed by stairs facing up
15:05 - again we're going to be following the
15:06 - same pattern on the uh
15:08 - that's this side over there
15:25 - and here again um you don't have to use
15:28 - the same design
15:29 - um in fact i'm just gonna try some other
15:32 - design by placing
15:33 - three blocks like this and then maybe
15:36 - blocks above it like that again
15:41 - you can play around with the stairs and
15:43 - see what kind of shapes you guys can
15:45 - make
15:46 - um so i'm gonna go with this shape over
15:49 - here and then i'm gonna add
15:52 - stairs on the edge just like that
15:56 - so this is the back side of our base
15:59 - this will be the side of our base
16:02 - and this would be the front of our base
16:07 - all right so this is basically the whole
16:09 - structure of our base so let's
16:10 - go inside and uh let's do some interior
16:13 - work so let's open the door and go in
16:15 - here
16:16 - um the first thing i'm gonna do is
16:18 - actually remove the items that i have
16:19 - here
16:20 - and i'm gonna grab a torch
16:24 - and then i'm gonna also grab a bed uh
16:27 - here i'm gonna grab a
16:29 - light blue bed and
16:32 - i'm gonna have torches on the
16:35 - corners
16:38 - and then i'm gonna have a bed and then
16:41 - you know to make it cozy i can also have
16:43 - a crafting bench
16:46 - uh maybe a furnace as well so we can
16:48 - cook so
16:49 - fairness and maybe a bookshelf you know
16:53 - um anything to make it a little bit more
16:57 - cozy
16:57 - i'm gonna put the crafting bench here
17:00 - and
17:01 - the furnace here and let's add a chest
17:05 - as well
17:07 - so that we have a place to store stuff
17:10 - just like this
17:12 - and yeah this looks very cozy and nice
17:18 - so this is the overall structure of the
17:20 - base
17:21 - and our cabin
17:33 - so that's all for today in today's
17:36 - project we learned how to make a cabin
17:38 - in minecraft
17:39 - we learned how to add walls add a roof
17:42 - add a door as well as our framework to
17:44 - our cabinet
