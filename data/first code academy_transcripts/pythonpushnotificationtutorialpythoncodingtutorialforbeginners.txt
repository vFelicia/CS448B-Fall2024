00:00 - hi everybody welcome to first code
00:02 - academy this week
00:03 - we'll be doing a project on python
00:05 - called 100 years old
00:08 - in this project we'll be learning how to
00:11 - do the basic
00:12 - operations in python to get information
00:15 - process it and send it back to the user
00:18 - by asking how
00:19 - old is it and calculating how
00:22 - which year will it be 100 years old
00:26 - for this we'll be using the idle tool to
00:29 - code in python
00:30 - to begin this program the premise of it
00:32 - is very simple
00:34 - we'll have a some code that will ask
00:37 - what's your name what's your age
00:41 - like how old are you in what year
00:44 - were you born so with these three
00:48 - data we'll display at the end when
00:51 - are you going to turn 100 years old
00:54 - okay the first step in every program we
00:57 - have to do
00:58 - is collect all the information we need
01:00 - in order for the program to work
01:03 - so we'll start by collecting the name
01:04 - because that's the polite thing to do
01:06 - you ask the name first
01:07 - so we'll ask input what's your name
01:13 - i'll leave a space here the input
01:16 - command
01:16 - allows us to save any information into a
01:19 - variable
01:21 - in this case the variable is the
01:22 - responsible to
01:24 - save the name so we can use it later in
01:26 - the program
01:28 - uh the variable i called it name with a
01:31 - capital n
01:34 - input is a command for getting the name
01:36 - and here is the message that will
01:37 - display
01:38 - so we can ask the name uh
01:41 - remember we use the print command in
01:44 - python to display the information we
01:46 - have so if we try it out right now
01:49 - input name print name and i run the
01:52 - program
01:55 - i'll show you here what's your name
01:58 - my name is fernando and i just print it
02:02 - again
02:02 - okay so far so good we just asked for
02:05 - the name and we get the name back
02:08 - we'll continue coding okay
02:12 - of course we don't want just the name we
02:14 - also want to know how old our user is
02:17 - if we say create a variable called age
02:20 - and we ask
02:22 - how old are you
02:28 - okay we can leave it like this
02:32 - the problem is h is not
02:36 - a letter or i mean it's not a word it's
02:39 - not a string as we call it in python
02:42 - it is a number numbers in python
02:45 - especially the numbers that don't have
02:47 - any decimal point
02:48 - are called integers
02:51 - to convert this input into an integer we
02:54 - need to add the special word
02:56 - and and surround this command between
02:59 - brackets
03:00 - what this will do is ask for the h when
03:03 - we type in the number
03:05 - it will convert the number from letters
03:08 - like from the string
03:09 - into an integer so python can recognize
03:12 - that this
03:12 - is an actual number and not some word
03:16 - the same way we'll ask for what the year
03:22 - is the user born okay or what year is it
03:25 - today
03:26 - sorry not the year that it was born
03:29 - the same way because the year is a
03:31 - number we'll add the
03:32 - end and the input commands and what
03:36 - year is it today
03:40 - we'll close it both
03:43 - and then we'll do some operation what
03:45 - operation do we need to do
03:47 - okay this is the year that the user will
03:50 - be born
03:51 - like will be 100 years old okay
03:54 - if we grab this year subtracted
03:58 - the age of the user you will get
04:01 - what year the user was born so for
04:04 - example
04:05 - let's say the user is 40
04:08 - and this year is the year 2000
04:12 - if you grab 2 000 and take 40 away from
04:14 - it you get
04:16 - 1960 1960
04:19 - so that means that the year the user was
04:22 - born
04:24 - if i grab this number and i add a
04:27 - hundred to it
04:28 - then i'll know when the user will turn a
04:31 - hundred years old
04:32 - one 1 960 plus 100
04:36 - is 2060 so i can know for sure that the
04:39 - user will turn
04:40 - 100 in the year 1900 2060.
04:45 - of course this is the number and when i
04:48 - print it i don't want it to be a number
04:50 - i want it to be a string just like name
04:53 - to turn this into a string
04:54 - i add the special word at str
04:58 - and surround this entire operation with
05:01 - those brackets
05:03 - that means that i will grab that number
05:04 - that result and turn it into a string
05:08 - now that i have everything in strings
05:10 - the name and the year
05:12 - i can print it in a message
05:15 - okay if i want to do something like this
05:20 - this won't work python doesn't recognize
05:23 - this
05:24 - as we want to put it together to put
05:26 - them together
05:27 - i will have to use the concatenation
05:30 - operator
05:31 - or the plus sign this will put these
05:34 - strings together
05:35 - now if i just pin it print it like this
05:38 - i'll show you
05:44 - i just try to print it like this let's
05:46 - say fernando
05:48 - already let's make up an a an h let's
05:52 - make up 70
05:54 - and let's say make up like one two three
05:55 - four
05:58 - it'll print it all together you see
06:01 - there's no space there's no formatting
06:02 - there's nothing like
06:04 - really special about this one we'll make
06:06 - it more pretty
06:08 - okay we'll make it look better
06:12 - instead of just printing them all
06:14 - together without any space without
06:16 - nothing
06:17 - i'll add another string in between these
06:19 - two
06:21 - i to use two concatenation operators
06:25 - and here's where i'll put the message
06:27 - output
06:28 - name let's say fernando will be
06:31 - 100 years old in the
06:35 - year and then the year they will turn
06:37 - 100.
06:39 - let's try again
06:45 - here fernando again let's put
06:49 - 50 and let's put 1 000
06:54 - okay fernando will be 100 years old in
06:57 - the year 1050.
06:59 - okay effectively if you make the math
07:02 - yourself
07:03 - i was born in 950 and then i will turn
07:06 - 1050 in the year 100 in the year 1050.
07:12 - as you can see this is a pretty simple
07:13 - program but we have just learned how to
07:16 - use the basic commands of input and
07:18 - print
07:19 - how to turn numbers into strings and
07:21 - strings into numbers
07:22 - and how to display this information in
07:24 - the end and that's it for today
07:26 - thanks for watching and i hope you
07:27 - enjoyed this tutorial please like and
07:29 - subscribe and we'll see you in the next
07:31 - one
07:32 - bye
