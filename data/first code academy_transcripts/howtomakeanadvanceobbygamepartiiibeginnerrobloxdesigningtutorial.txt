00:00 - hello everyone welcome back to our
00:02 - channel
00:03 - here we sharp beginner friendly coding
00:05 - tutorials on scratch
00:06 - roblox minecraft programming and minimal
00:10 - today we are going to take a look at
00:12 - part 3 of our advanced ob game tutorial
00:16 - in this video i will teach you on how to
00:18 - design three obstacles
00:20 - the first one would be a spinning of the
00:22 - obstacle
00:24 - followed by a laser maze obstacle and
00:26 - finally an obstacle called
00:28 - choose the correct platform so let's get
00:31 - started
00:35 - all right so here i have opened up my
00:38 - previous roblox file
00:40 - in the roblox studio which contains all
00:42 - the
00:44 - obstacles which i have designed
00:46 - previously so i do
00:47 - have my leap of faith
00:50 - [Music]
00:52 - and then the lace of platforms
00:56 - and then
01:00 - i have my conveyor belt here
01:03 - and then i have some mini jumping
01:06 - platforms
01:07 - up here all right
01:10 - all right so i'm going to continue from
01:12 - here so the first
01:14 - obstacle i would be creating is called
01:17 - choose the correct platform
01:19 - all right so in this obstacle the player
01:21 - have to create the correct
01:23 - platform or the correct lane out of the
01:26 - three options that is given
01:28 - because two of these lanes are going to
01:31 - be invisible trap
01:32 - in which when the player steps onto them
01:35 - they will fall through
01:37 - so the platforms the individual
01:40 - platforms would be changed
01:42 - um alternatively so they have to be
01:45 - extra careful on choosing the current
01:47 - platform
01:49 - so let's get started with that
01:52 - so once i have created my jumping
01:54 - platforms here
01:57 - i'm going to add a checkpoint
02:00 - so i'm going to toolbox and i'll
02:03 - be adding a spawn location we should
02:08 - also
02:08 - act as a checkpoint so i'm adding a
02:12 - neutral spawn
02:17 - all right and i'm going to anchor it so
02:20 - make sure that it's anchor
02:23 - all right so i'm going to make my three
02:25 - lengths across
02:26 - this base plate so first i'm going to
02:30 - create
02:30 - a tiny base plate that is going to be
02:33 - our base
02:35 - so i'll just add another pawn
02:40 - and stretch it too long using scale
02:54 - like that
02:57 - and make sure that you anchor them
03:00 - all right so now i'm going to draw long
03:04 - lanes so the links would be changed
03:07 - in three session so i'll just
03:10 - add another block so this one is going
03:14 - to be
03:16 - low
03:20 - so i'm going to add one
03:24 - two and then
03:30 - three
03:32 - so i'm going to make it a little bit
03:34 - longer so that it's
03:36 - it's kind of like a folk
03:39 - shape as you can see here so you can
03:43 - make it shorter
03:44 - and have more of the
03:47 - choosing platform obstacles like
03:49 - sessions
03:50 - i'll just make it a little bit longer
03:57 - make a copy of this platform
04:00 - and paste it here so this means that i
04:03 - have finished
04:04 - one session
04:11 - so for now i'm going to change
04:14 - i'm going to select the middle plane as
04:17 - my correct lane oh
04:22 - the line that is not an invisible trap
04:25 - so i'll just
04:27 - change the color a little bit to be
04:29 - green so
04:30 - green is for go all right and then i'm
04:34 - going to
04:35 - rename this part
04:38 - as invisible
04:45 - so renaming helps us to identify
04:49 - parts more easily so i do know that
04:52 - on the workspace if i need if i change
04:55 - my colors
04:56 - back onto the colors i want and then
04:58 - later on i need to check
05:00 - um which one is my invisible part if i
05:03 - have renamed it
05:05 - i can identify them easily okay so i'm
05:08 - going on to the next
05:10 - part and i'm going to rename it
05:14 - to be invisible
05:19 - okay so i'm going to rename this as
05:28 - correct blame
05:31 - you can write this correct part or
05:33 - correct link
05:35 - all right and then i'm going to to make
05:38 - things
05:38 - easier i'm going to copy this
05:42 - name
05:46 - and then so i'm going to switch my
05:50 - correct lane and then
05:53 - add my invisible traps
06:01 - if you do one part and if you copy it it
06:04 - would be
06:05 - easy so that the parts are also getting
06:08 - renamed automatically
06:17 - all right and then i do have some gaps
06:20 - so i'll be
06:22 - fixing that
06:28 - now i'm going to color them so it would
06:31 - be easy if i have
06:32 - three colors that is going to keep on
06:35 - repeating on every session
06:43 - all right so you can see that the
06:46 - platforms are being changed and then
06:49 - i'll just
06:50 - color the bases
06:57 - okay so now i'm going to
07:00 - write the code in lua that
07:03 - makes the invisible
07:06 - platform to not to collide with the
07:11 - player when they
07:12 - step onto them so it's a really easy
07:15 - code
07:16 - so i'm going to the workspace
07:19 - and i'll find an invisible path
07:24 - so i'm going to add a script into it
07:31 - all right so the first thing is i'm
07:33 - going to make it
07:35 - a little bit transparent so not too much
07:39 - because if you make it more transparent
07:43 - it's
07:43 - easy for the player to identify
07:46 - so i'm going to write script dot
07:50 - payron dot transparency
07:53 - is equal to 0.1
07:57 - and then i had to make sure that
07:58 - anything that is being collided on this
08:01 - platform is going to be false which
08:03 - makes my player to go through
08:07 - or falls down through the platforms
08:10 - when it steps onto these invisible lines
08:14 - so i'm going to make script dot
08:20 - parent dot
08:24 - can't collide is equal to false
08:29 - all right so it's the same script for
08:33 - the other invisible part so let's
08:36 - do something easy so i'm going to
08:40 - copy this script
08:43 - and then i'm going to select all my
08:45 - invisible parts so you can select
08:48 - click on one in invisible palm and hold
08:51 - your shift key
08:52 - and click on the other invisible paths
08:55 - like this
08:56 - and right click on your mouse or your
08:59 - keypad
09:01 - or your trackpad and then click on
09:04 - paste into selected and the script would
09:07 - be
09:08 - automatically pasted so i do have few
09:11 - more invisible files here
09:17 - all right so that's the script for your
09:20 - invisible pawn and we have done with our
09:25 - first
09:26 - obstacle so now let's go on to the
09:30 - second obstacle
09:32 - which is going to be a laser mix alright
09:34 - so i'm going to start here
09:36 - and i'm going to add another neutral
09:39 - point
09:40 - or a spawn location
09:42 - [Music]
09:46 - so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
09:48 - make it a little bit bigger
09:50 - and add in the small location here
09:57 - so i'm going to make my maze here
10:01 - that's filled with laser walls
10:04 - so first i'm going to add my
10:09 - base so i'll just make it black color
10:13 - because the laces i will be coloring
10:16 - in red color so i need a
10:19 - platform or a base that's going to be
10:22 - sticking out
10:23 - or show my laces to be a little bit more
10:30 - sharper
10:34 - and then i'm going to make some parts
10:37 - again so this time i'm going to choose
10:41 - my
10:42 - lace color so i'll just make it red
10:44 - color
10:45 - and the material should be neon
10:50 - and then i'll just make it bigger like
10:54 - this
10:56 - use scale function and create a part
11:01 - like this or maybe even bigger so that
11:06 - it's actually designs in two walls of a
11:10 - base
11:12 - so i'll just make one here like that and
11:15 - once i have made one i'll just rename it
11:18 - as
11:20 - laser because we do have to write a code
11:23 - for this
11:26 - all right so next i'll just keep on
11:29 - creating some walls
11:43 - make sure the walls are not too near
11:46 - each other because you have to have some
11:49 - space
11:49 - in order for your player to move around
12:03 - okay so i have created a mini laser maze
12:08 - so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
12:10 - make
12:11 - one of these walls to be a little bit
12:15 - more transparent so the player would not
12:18 - actually
12:18 - see it so it's kind of like
12:22 - being a little bit tricky amazed
12:25 - all right so what i'm going to do is i'm
12:28 - going to click
12:29 - on this
12:32 - part the one in the middle and i'm going
12:35 - to click on the property tab
12:38 - of this particular laser part so if you
12:41 - can't find this property tab
12:43 - on my right corner so you can always go
12:46 - to
12:47 - view click on properties
12:51 - so i have clicked on this one so on the
12:54 - property tab
12:56 - go down a little bit
12:59 - and you see
13:03 - transparency option okay so right now
13:06 - it's
13:07 - zero so i'm going to increase it so i'm
13:10 - going to use the slider
13:12 - okay so i'm going to make it like nine
13:15 - five
13:16 - so it's a little bit visible
13:20 - like this okay so i have made my laser
13:23 - wall
13:25 - for the laser maze so next
13:28 - i'm going to create my spinning
13:30 - platforms
13:31 - again which is also going to be with
13:34 - lasers
13:36 - all right so i'm going to keep on
13:37 - continuing this
13:39 - platform so i'll just click on
13:42 - this copy it
13:46 - and then to rotate it i'll just
13:49 - click on model and
13:52 - click on the rotate function so i'm
13:55 - going to
13:55 - rotate it along the y-axis so i'll just
14:01 - turn it along the green circle
14:05 - and then i'm going to fix it like this
14:12 - so i'm going to choose like add some
14:17 - like gaps jumping platform like this
14:33 - okay so this platform i'm going to lift
14:36 - it a little bit up
14:40 - okay so it's can be easily identified
14:43 - from the other platforms
14:45 - so kind of like giving a little heart to
14:47 - it
14:48 - okay so to make my spinning platforms i
14:52 - need two parts
14:53 - one is for the base that's going to
14:56 - hold my spinning part and the other one
15:00 - is going to be the actual spinning part
15:02 - and to make them combine
15:05 - i'm going to use unhinge so let's see
15:08 - how we can make it
15:10 - so first i'm going to make one platform
15:13 - here
15:15 - so i'm going to add my base
15:18 - i'll just choose the material to be
15:22 - plastic and a different color
15:30 - okay so i'm going to rename this little
15:33 - part so
15:33 - um stretch it a little bit
15:37 - and make sure that it matches with the
15:40 - height of the platform
15:42 - the base platform that's here
15:46 - right now it's mesh you can click on the
15:49 - scale and lift it
15:51 - and i'm going to rename this part as
15:55 - base
16:00 - next i'm going to add my spinning part
16:02 - so again i'm going to use
16:06 - part and then this time i'm going to
16:11 - select a different colors
16:16 - and now i'm going to stretch it
16:21 - so that it's going to the length of this
16:25 - is going to be
16:26 - the addition of this base part and this
16:29 - platform's width
16:32 - so the length i'm going to stretch it
16:34 - like that
16:37 - all right now let's see how we can add
16:39 - our constraint
16:41 - so first i'm going to oh
16:45 - before that make sure that you spin
16:48 - or rename this part as
16:52 - spin
17:00 - okay so now i'm going to click on move
17:03 - and lift it up a little bit
17:08 - this is to make sure that you correctly
17:10 - hinge your
17:12 - parts later on we are going to bring it
17:15 - down i'm going to um
17:19 - i'm changing my camera wave
17:24 - so that i can see the top of
17:27 - this base and the bottom side of
17:30 - the spinning platform
17:34 - yeah this would be better so i can see
17:37 - the top and the bottom of this so i'm
17:40 - going to click on
17:41 - hinge so you can find
17:46 - hinge on this tool
17:50 - and then i'm going to click on
17:54 - this and click on hinge so i'm going to
17:57 - start from
17:59 - the base so as you can see here i'm
18:02 - adding
18:03 - a attachment and i'm going to lift it
18:07 - and then connect it so that
18:10 - it's connecting from the bottom side of
18:14 - the spinning platform not to a side or
18:17 - to the top is to the bottom side of the
18:20 - spinning platform
18:22 - like that all right so the hinge
18:26 - constraint is
18:27 - attached to the base right now but
18:30 - there's also another attachment on the
18:32 - spin so if i click on here
18:34 - i do have an attachment
18:37 - now i'm going to bring this down so
18:41 - again i'm going to click on move
18:48 - and bring it down
18:51 - okay so right now the
18:54 - hinge would not make your platform to
18:57 - move
18:58 - because it's going to be
19:01 - a stationary hinge so in order to make
19:05 - it move
19:05 - i'm going to click on the hinge
19:07 - constraint
19:09 - and then it will open up the property
19:11 - tab again
19:13 - next i'm going to go down
19:16 - and there's a type or property
19:19 - called accutated type so this is telling
19:23 - us what kind of hinge would it or should
19:26 - it be
19:27 - so i'm going to click on that and click
19:31 - on
19:31 - motor so that it's turning
19:35 - next on the motor i so if you go down on
19:39 - the property tab
19:41 - i do have another property called
19:43 - angular velocity
19:45 - so this means the speed at which
19:48 - the hinge should be turning
19:52 - so i'm going to give a smaller number to
19:55 - be
19:56 - around three so you can go up to
20:00 - 10 or 20. so if you go to a higher
20:03 - number
20:04 - the speed of spinning would be
20:07 - really really fast so i'm going to keep
20:10 - it a little bit simple
20:12 - not too fast spinning so i'll just make
20:14 - it three
20:17 - next i need to update the value of the
20:20 - moto
20:20 - max torque property so this means
20:23 - the strength of the spinning
20:27 - so for this you have to give a really
20:29 - big number
20:31 - so i'm going to give a number of
20:34 - 100 000
20:39 - okay so that it pushes with the big foes
20:42 - and then keeps on turning with a big
20:44 - force
20:47 - all right so you can always try this out
20:51 - so let's take a look at how this
20:53 - spin works so i'm going to click on play
21:12 - here i have my as you can see here
21:16 - my platform is spinning
21:22 - okay so right now it doesn't do anything
21:24 - because i have not given a code
21:26 - right so but later on we are going to
21:28 - fix the code so that whenever you touch
21:31 - this spinning platform
21:33 - you would be your health would be radius
21:37 - all right so one important thing is that
21:40 - on the
21:41 - spinning platform so i'm going to create
21:44 - a couple of
21:45 - these spinning platforms
21:57 - so now when you move it you have to make
21:59 - sure that there
22:00 - is a space between
22:04 - this two platforms
22:07 - because if you keep on if you don't have
22:11 - enough space they would actually get
22:13 - stuck into each other
22:15 - and then your spinning platform could
22:18 - not longer spin
22:19 - because they're touching each other so
22:22 - it's better if you give like
22:26 - like consider the length of this
22:29 - spinning platform and then
23:06 - foreign
23:08 - all right so there's a little bit of
23:11 - spacing
23:13 - i have to do
23:28 - all right so i have made the spacing and
23:31 - then
23:32 - made my spinning platform to be equally
23:36 - space so now i'm going to make the
23:39 - kill sprite which is going to make my
23:43 - laser holes and the spinning platforms
23:46 - to
23:47 - kill my player when they touch each
23:50 - other
23:52 - so i'm going to click on this laser part
23:55 - and make a script
24:01 - okay so i'm going to make a function
24:10 - that is called kale
24:26 - in lower language the player is known as
24:29 - the object called humana so
24:32 - here i have given i have made my
24:34 - humanoid or the player to be
24:36 - a local player
24:40 - then i'm going to give the condition so
24:44 - if the player touches them they're going
24:48 - to
24:48 - reduce the hell
25:02 - next i need to write my email so
25:05 - when the parent
25:18 - i'm going to run the function call here
25:24 - so i'm going to make sure that this
25:26 - script
25:27 - is going to be in all the laces and also
25:31 - on the spinning part of my platforms
27:38 - so that's all for today make sure to

27:42 - the next section of this project
