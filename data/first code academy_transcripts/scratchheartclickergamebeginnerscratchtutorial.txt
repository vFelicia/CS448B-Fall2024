00:00 - hello everyone so today we're going to
00:02 - be making a scratch game
00:04 - and this game is called heart clicker so
00:06 - let's begin
00:07 - by making that game on scratch see you
00:09 - in a bit
00:11 - so this is the project that we're going
00:12 - to create it's called heart clicker
00:14 - so right here we have a title and then
00:16 - we have a button
00:18 - so when i click on the start button a
00:20 - bunch of hearts start falling from the
00:22 - top to the bottom
00:23 - and as i click them i start to gain
00:26 - points
00:27 - as you see here so
00:30 - the tapping is done by my mouse once my
00:33 - mouse is over the art
00:34 - i gain a point whenever i click on them
00:38 - that's a game and what it's using is a
00:41 - clone
00:41 - to create copies of these hearts and
00:43 - then it's randomly moving from left to
00:45 - right
00:46 - and dropping them from all the way from
00:48 - the top to the bottom
00:49 - and we're going to begin our tutorial
00:51 - first head to the scratch webpage
00:53 - and log in with your account the next
00:55 - procedure we need to do
00:56 - is click on create once you click on
01:00 - create
01:01 - it will open up to the page where you
01:03 - can start creating your project
01:05 - so once we're here the first thing we'd
01:07 - like to do
01:08 - is change the project name so we're
01:11 - going to call this heart
01:12 - clicker next we want to
01:16 - remove this cat as we won't be using it
01:20 - now in every game there's usually a
01:23 - background
01:24 - so the same thing is going to apply to
01:26 - our game we're going to add in two
01:27 - backgrounds
01:28 - so we're going to click on this and over
01:32 - here in the scratch library
01:33 - you can pick any color or any background
01:36 - that you like
01:36 - i am going to stick with a simple blue
01:39 - sky too
01:41 - and then to edit it i'm going to click
01:42 - on backdrops
01:44 - so i have a backdrop one which is blank
01:48 - but we're not going to use it so we
01:50 - click on it and press on the
01:52 - x so we have one over here
01:55 - so i'm going to rename this with start
01:59 - gain so that is my first backdrop
02:03 - then i'm going to duplicate this so
02:05 - right click and duplicate
02:07 - and i'm going to call this the game
02:10 - screen so start game is just
02:13 - what happens when we start our game game
02:15 - screen is where the main game is
02:18 - so as we began on this we would like now
02:22 - to add in text so you can click on this
02:24 - t
02:25 - and you can pick on any color that you
02:28 - like so i'll just stick with green
02:30 - and you can change your font styling to
02:32 - whatever you like
02:34 - i use marker here we're going to click
02:36 - on this page
02:38 - over here then we'll type in a heart
02:44 - now you may notice that the words are
02:45 - quite small not to worry you can click
02:47 - over here
02:48 - and just drag this like that
02:51 - and it makes the words much bigger and
02:54 - you can even drag it and position it so
02:56 - i'm just going to
02:56 - leave it in the middle next
03:00 - what we'd like to do is we'd like to add
03:02 - a button so
03:04 - most games have a start button we'd like
03:06 - to do the same here
03:08 - so we can head here click on choose a
03:10 - sprite
03:11 - and in this sprite library they actually
03:13 - have a button
03:15 - over here so click on this and then we
03:18 - can place this
03:19 - down over here you can click on costumes
03:24 - and you can delete the second button and
03:27 - here
03:27 - we're going to click on t again as we
03:30 - want to add in text
03:31 - and you can change the color over here
03:34 - so i'm just going to stick to blue
03:36 - and inside here i'll just type in all
03:38 - caps start
03:40 - if you're unhappy with the color you
03:42 - click on fill again make sure you
03:44 - highlight the word
03:45 - and then you can just change it so
03:49 - you can choose any color that you like
03:51 - say you want this
03:53 - you can leave it at that and just click
03:56 - over here
03:58 - once that's done you're good to go with
04:01 - this page
04:02 - if you want to change the size you can
04:03 - always go here and change it to maybe
04:06 - 200 you can make the button bigger and
04:09 - then place it over
04:10 - here so as we have our button
04:15 - we'd like to add some actions and to do
04:17 - that we need to add some
04:18 - coding blocks first we click on events
04:21 - and then we take out when sprite clicked
04:25 - so i'll make this a bit bigger
04:30 - so this block when spread clicked what
04:32 - this means is it's an event
04:33 - and in this event it only runs when we
04:36 - the user
04:37 - click on this button with our mouse so
04:40 - the next thing we do is we click on
04:42 - looks
04:42 - and we take out the hide block here
04:46 - because when we click on this block we
04:48 - want it to hide
04:50 - and then we wanted to change the
04:52 - backdrop to the game screen
04:56 - next is we click on the events
04:59 - and take out a green flag so
05:02 - this is when we click on the green flag
05:04 - that means when we start our game
05:06 - so when we start our game we want it to
05:08 - be seen and click on
05:10 - show scroll down here take out show
05:14 - next when we click on this
05:18 - here we want to show this background
05:21 - so we take out switch backdrop and we
05:24 - click
05:25 - on the start game which is here
05:28 - so click on this or here and then
05:32 - the next thing we want to do is make a
05:34 - variable so the variable we call this
05:36 - score s-c-o-r-e
05:40 - but when we start the game we don't want
05:42 - to see this score on top
05:43 - over here we want it to be hidden in
05:46 - order to hide that we have an
05:48 - option in variables you will see a
05:51 - height
05:52 - over here height variable
05:55 - and then you change this to score
05:59 - so when you click on this score variable
06:02 - is hidden
06:03 - the button is here the text is here in
06:05 - this background here once you click this
06:07 - you go to the next page so
06:10 - back to the backdrops here
06:13 - this is blue in color for this you can
06:16 - pick in any color you like
06:19 - i'm gonna click on the paint and you can
06:21 - select whichever color you want
06:24 - if you want yellow you can do yellow
06:27 - since
06:27 - it's a valentine sort of game
06:30 - i will go with a color of red
06:34 - here so after you've selected that color
06:37 - the
06:37 - next thing is we want to start our game
06:39 - and we want to add in our main character
06:42 - so the main sprite we're using is a
06:44 - heart you can click on choose a sprite
06:47 - here we can pick
06:48 - heart so
06:52 - with this heart here you can move this
06:54 - over here
06:56 - and click on costume and you have two
06:59 - options you can either click whichever
07:02 - one you want
07:03 - if say you want the purple heart you can
07:05 - keep that
07:06 - if you don't want the red heart you just
07:09 - delete it and you can keep the purple
07:10 - heart
07:12 - next we'd like to maybe decrease the
07:14 - size
07:15 - as the heart is quite big you can change
07:18 - this to 50
07:19 - and if you still want it a bit smaller
07:22 - you can change it maybe to 45.
07:24 - so as we have our heart what we want to
07:28 - do here
07:28 - is that when we are on this background
07:32 - we want to show the score variable as
07:35 - our game is starting
07:37 - we click on events we take out the
07:40 - when backdrop switch to just
07:43 - increase this so as we know this is
07:46 - called game screen
07:49 - and then we click on variables and we
07:51 - take out the
07:52 - show variable so this is where we can
07:55 - see our variable
07:56 - score next we want to actually
08:00 - hide this heart so we click on looks
08:04 - and we use hide
08:07 - place this here next
08:10 - the thing is when we start a game with
08:12 - score
08:13 - as you know anytime you play any game
08:16 - our score starts with zero
08:17 - so the same thing has to be applied to
08:19 - this game too
08:21 - click on variables and we take out set
08:23 - my variable to zero
08:25 - and you can change this to set score to
08:27 - zero
08:29 - so now when we click this
08:33 - we notice there's a little issue when i
08:35 - start my game
08:38 - the heart has disappeared but when i
08:41 - click that the heart was just not there
08:43 - so in order to have the game start
08:46 - properly
08:46 - we can click on control
08:50 - and take out a wait until
08:53 - so now the heart is gone but since i had
08:55 - the height
08:56 - but then again my heart is hitting
08:59 - but i want to show a bunch of other
09:01 - hearts so what i can do
09:03 - is i click on this wait until
09:06 - and i keep it here and then i go to
09:10 - operator so an operator we have a
09:13 - equal sign here we can place this here
09:16 - and we can change this to number two
09:19 - so the reason why we're changing this to
09:20 - the number two is if we go back to our
09:23 - backdrops
09:24 - you'll see that number one is start game
09:26 - number two is our game screen
09:28 - so what we're telling this heart is that
09:31 - we'll wait
09:32 - until it's the second backdrop and to
09:34 - choose that you go to looks
09:37 - you scroll down you'll see background
09:39 - number
09:40 - and then you just add that here
09:44 - next we're going to take out a forever
09:46 - block
09:47 - as we want an action to be repeated
09:50 - continuously
09:51 - so we take out forever and what we'd
09:54 - like to happen
09:54 - is we wanted to create a clone so clone
09:57 - and scratch is where it makes a
09:58 - duplicate
09:59 - or in other words a copy of this heart
10:02 - so we scroll down and you shall see this
10:05 - block it's called create a clone of
10:07 - myself
10:08 - so when i click this
10:12 - we have said that we'll create a clone
10:15 - but now
10:16 - what we need to do is give it
10:18 - instructions as to what will it do when
10:21 - it becomes a clone
10:22 - so that is in the next part over here so
10:25 - you can bring this back up
10:29 - and then here we can take out when i
10:31 - start as a clone
10:34 - so this here is when
10:37 - our clones start to appear on our screen
10:41 - then we click on the forever block
10:44 - as we'll be using that we want all the
10:46 - actions inside here to
10:48 - continuously happen so first
10:51 - when we begin we want to see the clone
10:54 - so we scroll down here
10:56 - and take out show next what we'd like to
11:00 - do
11:00 - is we want the heart to go in a random
11:03 - position on our screen
11:05 - to do that we click on motion and we
11:07 - take out the go to
11:08 - x y block here then we click on
11:12 - operators and take out pick random now
11:15 - pick random is a block where it will
11:17 - randomly go
11:18 - anywhere if you give it a range so this
11:21 - is the smallest value this is the
11:22 - biggest value
11:24 - so we need two of these blocks so please
11:26 - make sure you take out two of them
11:28 - you can also duplicate them and paste
11:30 - them inside so for the x-axis
11:32 - it goes from negative 240 to 240. so
11:36 - we're gonna put that here negative two
11:37 - four zero two two four
11:41 - zero now for the y axis
11:44 - here we have a different value so
11:48 - that's going to be minus 180
11:51 - to 180
11:56 - so now that we've added this
12:00 - the heart will randomly move around
12:03 - the next action we'd like to take is
12:05 - that we want these hearts
12:07 - to go from the top and come all the way
12:09 - down and to do that
12:12 - instead of using a forever loop or a
12:15 - repeat loop we're going to use something
12:17 - called a repeat until
12:19 - so this block is used
12:22 - when we want an action to be repeated
12:24 - until a certain condition is met
12:27 - so we click on control
12:30 - take out this repeat until and
12:34 - what we're going to place here is we're
12:36 - going to repeat whatever action we put
12:38 - inside this block
12:38 - until this heart these hearts
12:41 - reach the edge so we're going to take
12:44 - out the
12:44 - touching here and we can change this to
12:48 - touching edge next
12:52 - what we'd like to do is click on motion
12:55 - and take out the change y
12:57 - as we want it to fall down and when
12:59 - anything goes from up to down on the
13:01 - axis that's on the y
13:02 - axis so here we have put change y but
13:06 - with a positive number it would go up so
13:09 - here's where we can make the game a
13:11 - little interesting we can take our pick
13:13 - random
13:14 - and we want the computer to pick a
13:16 - random number between negative 5
13:19 - over here to negative 10.
13:26 - so the computer will pick a random
13:28 - number and the heart will move down slow
13:31 - or a bit more quicker and it will
13:32 - randomly happen with each and every
13:34 - clone
13:36 - next what we'd like to add is that if
13:39 - this heart is touching the edge we want
13:41 - it to disappear
13:43 - because we want more hearts to follow
13:45 - from the top
13:46 - so we want it to be a continuous process
13:48 - of hearts falling from the top
13:50 - coming down disappearing and then having
13:52 - more come from the top
13:54 - so we click on control and then we take
13:58 - out a
13:58 - if touching and we put this inside here
14:02 - so once again we're going to be using
14:03 - the same block if touching edge
14:05 - so we click on sensing take out if
14:08 - touching edge and place this here
14:12 - and then what we can do here is click
14:14 - back on control
14:17 - and then you will see a delete clone so
14:20 - your clone will be deleted so this is
14:23 - how our coding process
14:25 - has gone so far
14:29 - so the next thing we'd like to add is
14:31 - that in this game
14:33 - we want to make a score and how do we do
14:36 - that by clicking on these hearts
14:38 - so we can click on events take out the
14:41 - when this sprite click and then very
14:45 - simply you can head to
14:46 - variables take out your change my
14:49 - variable
14:50 - and change this to chain score by one
14:55 - so when we begin at this background we
14:58 - start at zero
14:59 - and then our main heart is hidden
15:02 - and then we wait until it changes to
15:05 - this backdrop
15:06 - and then we start creating clones of
15:09 - myself which is referring to the heart
15:12 - next when a clone is created it's shown
15:15 - it randomly goes
15:17 - according to the x and y axis range that
15:19 - we've added
15:21 - and then constantly until it reaches the
15:24 - edge it will keep on going from the top
15:25 - of the screen
15:26 - to the bottom and then whenever they
15:28 - touch the bottom
15:30 - they will be deleted and
15:33 - whenever our mouse is clicking on these
15:36 - hearts
15:37 - our scores change by one so let's check
15:40 - it out
15:41 - let's see if everything works well so we
15:44 - have hard clicker we have the background
15:45 - we have the button
15:47 - so we've added the button code here i'm
15:49 - saying that when we click on the sprite
15:51 - we want this to be hidden and we wanted
15:53 - to change the game screen
15:55 - and we've also said that when the game
15:57 - when we've clicked on the grid
15:59 - we've also said that when green flag
16:01 - clicked you want this button to be shown
16:03 - show the start game background and hide
16:06 - the variable so let's do that
16:08 - so there you have a bunch of hearts
16:10 - falling
16:11 - and they're cloning and they're falling
16:13 - from the top to the bottom
16:14 - and whenever you click them you get a
16:17 - score
16:18 - so i'm not the best at this game
16:20 - hopefully you guys are much
16:22 - better but this is the hard clicker game
16:25 - that we have created
16:27 - and if you want to restart the game no
16:28 - problem just click on the green flag
16:30 - we're back at the start point and this
16:32 - is the end of our tutorial
16:34 - so that's the end of the tutorial i hope
16:36 - you guys had fun
