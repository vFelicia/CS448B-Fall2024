00:02 - what inspired you to pursue computer
00:04 - science
00:05 - i've always been pretty decent at math
00:07 - so like both my parents
00:09 - are computer like are software engineers
00:11 - so
00:12 - i've been like math has always come
00:14 - pretty naturally to me so
00:15 - once i decide like i didn't want to
00:17 - continue with my nursing major
00:19 - um cs has always been my backup but like
00:22 - so at first i i can't say like i was
00:25 - really passionate about cs when i first
00:27 - went like went into the major but like
00:29 - as i've learned more and more about it
00:31 - i think something that really inspires
00:33 - me about cs is just like
00:35 - it's such a big field there's so there's
00:37 - so much things to learn
00:38 - and you can never really like know all
00:40 - of cs
00:42 - and for me like i just really like
00:43 - learning things in general so it's
00:45 - really nice to
00:46 - always be like learning about something
00:48 - new
00:49 - and like being in such a young industry
00:51 - too what is college life like and a
00:53 - follow-up question for that is
00:55 - um how is it different during covid
00:59 - so college life is i would say like it's
01:02 - what you make it to be um for me
01:05 - it's been a lot of just like studying
01:08 - and
01:08 - like being a nerd basically so like
01:11 - going to hackathons
01:12 - doing like side projects doing like
01:15 - grinding
01:16 - the um my classes and stuff like that
01:19 - but i also know like some of my friends
01:21 - through the whole like college party
01:22 - life um so
01:24 - and like the thing with i i think like
01:27 - the thing the difference between um
01:28 - high school and college is like for high
01:31 - school you don't really have a choice in
01:33 - like how your schedule is or what your
01:35 - daily schedule looks like
01:37 - but for college you do so like you
01:40 - choose your classes you get to like
01:42 - choose how you spend your time and what
01:44 - clubs you go to
01:45 - um you don't really have that urgency to
01:48 - like i have to take these classes if i
01:50 - want to get into like
01:52 - a good job or something it's just like
01:54 - you can choose whatever classes you're
01:55 - interested in
01:56 - so like it's just like what you make it
01:59 - out to be
02:00 - so you can either like be studying all
02:02 - the time or like you can
02:04 - be a party person and take easy classes
02:07 - but for like
02:08 - during coven um it's just not like
02:11 - online classes
02:12 - so it's just like just homework and then
02:15 - staying at home
02:16 - have you ever thought about giving up in
02:18 - computer science and if so
02:20 - how did you overcome these difficulties
02:22 - yeah a lot of times
02:24 - it's basically like for me like each
02:26 - semester is like
02:28 - oh no can i actually like pass the
02:30 - semester i'm taking like so many classes
02:32 - and like
02:33 - i don't know if i can actually like if i
02:35 - can actually finish all my projects on
02:37 - time
02:38 - um but i think like
02:41 - just dealing with that it's like you you
02:44 - can't really avoid the classes you have
02:45 - to take
02:46 - and if you want to like learn more then
02:48 - you just have to do more
02:50 - so for me it's like i
02:53 - i find like all my every semester very
02:56 - daunting
02:57 - and it's like it gets very scary
02:59 - thinking like
03:00 - oh i have to do i have like four
03:02 - projects due in one week can i actually
03:04 - do it
03:05 - but um i always think like there's no
03:08 - other there's no other choice
03:11 - um so i just i usually like take things
03:14 - little by little so like breaking it
03:15 - down day by day
03:16 - and being like oh i can i can spend 10
03:20 - minutes on this project we're like
03:21 - one hour on this project and even if
03:23 - like it's
03:24 - a little bit of time it's still progress
03:27 - in general
03:28 - so it's just like overcoming things step
03:30 - by step
03:31 - and then once like the semester like
03:34 - before you know it the semester's over
03:35 - or like
03:36 - you're graduating college and then you
03:38 - realize like oh it's actually doable
03:40 - yeah um did you have any like
03:44 - trouble with any computer science
03:46 - teachers that you've had that
03:47 - kind of made you want to give up the
03:49 - major
03:51 - um for professors
03:56 - i wouldn't say like it was i've had
03:58 - really bad professors
04:00 - or professors who made me want to drop
04:03 - out of
04:05 - out of the major but i've had very
04:08 - like very hard classes like for example
04:11 - this semester i'm taking
04:13 - intro like operating systems which is
04:16 - the hardest classes in the department
04:18 - and like there have been a lot of times
04:20 - where i'm like i can't finish this
04:21 - project or like no matter what i do
04:23 - i don't know how to actually like solve
04:25 - this or um
04:27 - or i i don't think i'm like actually
04:30 - learning this properly
04:32 - but i think like for that i
04:35 - after like i have like my little like
04:38 - panic moment but then like
04:39 - afterwards i think like this is just one
04:42 - project this is just one grade
04:43 - as long as like even if i can't like
04:47 - if i can't do it and like get a hundred
04:49 - percent or like get an a plus
04:51 - like i can still pass the class
04:54 - so like in the bigger picture like even
04:57 - if i don't
04:59 - do this like well i can still like do my
05:02 - as long as i do my best
05:04 - and i try my best like everything will
05:06 - kind of work out
05:07 - i recently learned a coding language
05:09 - where do you think i should go from
05:11 - there
05:12 - when you learn a coding language i think
05:15 - like the best way
05:17 - to like or the next step would just be
05:20 - to apply it to a project
05:22 - um usually like because
05:26 - that way like i think like personally
05:28 - for me i learn best when
05:29 - i'm applying a language it's very hard
05:31 - for me to actually
05:32 - like sit down and learn java or like sit
05:36 - down and learn python usually
05:38 - that's like i just um
05:42 - i guess like i learn while i'm doing
05:45 - something
05:45 - so so like you can
05:49 - you can like build a little personal
05:51 - project
05:52 - that like uses the code you've learned
05:54 - so like for example if you
05:55 - just learn python or something i think
05:58 - like the best way to um
06:00 - to like go from there is just to like
06:03 - just to go ahead and apply what you've
06:04 - learned
06:05 - so like building an app out of python or
06:08 - like
06:08 - building um building whatever project
06:11 - you want
06:12 - and then that way like sometimes you can
06:14 - encounter
06:15 - like problems that you've never like
06:18 - faced before
06:19 - and then once you encounter those
06:20 - problems and you work your way through
06:22 - to debugging them
06:24 - then like you can learn a lot like a lot
06:27 - about the nuances of the language
06:29 - so i guess like just working on a
06:31 - project that's like applying that
06:33 - language
06:34 - to like something practical do you have
06:36 - any like
06:38 - examples of when you learned a language
06:40 - and you tried to make your own projects
06:43 - um yeah like i think oh basically all my
06:47 - projects honestly
06:48 - are like me learning a language on the
06:49 - fly or for example like how i got my
06:52 - internship as
06:53 - qualcomm was actually like during at a
06:55 - hackathon
06:56 - and that was like the first time i used
06:58 - python um
07:00 - and for that like i didn't know any like
07:03 - python before that
07:04 - but during like those two days i was
07:06 - just like
07:07 - making a small like um game of snake
07:10 - and then i was learning python while i
07:13 - was trying to build that app
07:14 - and that's how i learned about like how
07:16 - do you make python classes how you like
07:18 - make python
07:19 - functions and stuff like that um and
07:21 - that was
07:22 - that's how i basically learned all of my
07:24 - online languages
07:25 - so if you look at um a lot of the
07:27 - projects i have on github
07:30 - are like are using languages that i
07:34 - haven't like used before
07:38 - right um
07:41 - definitely you should keep that in mind
07:43 - for everyone who's trying to learn new
07:45 - coding languages
07:46 - what motivated you to switch your major
07:48 - from nursing to computer science i know
07:50 - you already talked about like
07:51 - um you know being more affluent in
07:55 - math but um was there any other
07:58 - things that motivated you to switch i
08:01 - think for me like
08:03 - so the reason i switched sophomore year
08:06 - was because sophomore year was the first
08:08 - time like
08:09 - for at least like the mystery school of
08:11 - nursing where you had to go in the
08:13 - hospital
08:13 - and like do an eight-hour shift every
08:15 - week so for me like that was when i
08:18 - realized like
08:19 - i'm not social enough to actually like
08:21 - to actually like be enough be in a
08:23 - hospital and like interact with patients
08:25 - for like
08:26 - eight plus hours every single day um
08:29 - it was honestly very tiring like i was
08:31 - i'm still
08:32 - interested in like medicine and
08:33 - healthcare and stuff
08:35 - but it was very emotionally tiring to
08:38 - like
08:38 - be in a hospital and like have to deal
08:41 - with like
08:42 - have to like talk to patients um
08:44 - interact with people constantly but also
08:46 - have to deal with like really
08:47 - emotionally stressful things like my the
08:50 - um
08:51 - the floor i was working at wasn't really
08:54 - that like
08:55 - wasn't that um it wasn't like an
08:58 - icu or like a trauma floor it was sort
09:00 - of like a general
09:02 - floor where people were recovering from
09:03 - surgery but there was still like a lot
09:05 - of things that went on in there because
09:08 - like you have patients who are in like
09:10 - very
09:11 - they're in very emotional stages of
09:12 - their life because like
09:14 - it's they're like coming out of an
09:16 - important operation or something
09:18 - and it's very emotionally like
09:21 - emotionally
09:22 - draining for me so like i didn't really
09:24 - have the personality or like
09:26 - the i guess like the um
09:30 - the emotional intelligence i would say
09:31 - to like be a nurse
09:33 - and find it like not tiring
09:37 - so i think like the switchy computer
09:39 - science which is like
09:40 - not as social was was natural
09:45 - yeah are there any times that um you
09:47 - regret
09:48 - switching um honestly not really
09:52 - like i guess i kind of regret switching
09:56 - schools because i left a lot of like my
09:58 - friend group
09:59 - back at university of michigan and it
10:02 - was um
10:04 - it was a little i guess it was a little
10:07 - strange
10:08 - being um
10:13 - served one or two years older than to
10:16 - like be
10:16 - felt
10:20 - because i wasn't a traditional college
10:23 - student
10:24 - or i didn't see myself as like the
10:25 - traditional college student because i
10:26 - felt a little behind
10:28 - but um besides like besides like having
10:31 - to rebuild
10:32 - my social circle in college i don't
10:34 - think like
10:35 - i really miss the um
10:38 - the nursing major itself
10:41 - yeah i think i regret like not being in
10:44 - cs first
10:46 - i'm losing those first two years yeah
10:49 - um i guess another question would be to
10:52 - like anyone who's about to go into
10:54 - college or who's in college right now
10:56 - and they're not interested in their
10:57 - major
10:58 - would you um like on a scale of one to
11:00 - ten how much would you suggest for them
11:02 - to
11:02 - switch to a different major
11:05 - um i think like
11:09 - you have like for in my opinion like the
11:12 - first two years of college
11:15 - you don't have to worry too much about
11:17 - like do i have to commit to a major or
11:19 - do i have to like force myself
11:21 - to like this major that i'm not too sure
11:22 - about you
11:24 - have like the ability to switch your
11:25 - first two years of college
11:27 - and then like by junior and senior year
11:29 - um then you have to really commit to
11:31 - whatever major
11:33 - um your you've selected at that point
11:36 - um to be honest for like a lot of people
11:39 - who aren't sure
11:40 - if they're gonna um if they like which
11:43 - major they're gonna do
11:45 - i would honestly recommend something
11:46 - like community college
11:48 - because that way you can save money and
11:51 - you can like save
11:52 - you can like explore around without like
11:55 - without it being too high risk
11:58 - for me like like university of michigan
12:01 - was like the
12:02 - one-year tuition cost more than like my
12:04 - four years at university of maryland
12:06 - because i was paying out of state at
12:07 - that point
12:08 - so it like while while like i did like
12:12 - i did enjoy my time there it was it
12:15 - still cost me a lot
12:16 - and i think like if you if you're not
12:20 - sure about your major
12:21 - or like if you aren't sure if you commit
12:24 - to whatever major you've chosen
12:26 - um feel like you're senior um
12:29 - don't force yourself to like do
12:31 - something
12:32 - if you don't like it because because
12:34 - like getting a degree in something
12:36 - requires
12:37 - requires passion to be honest
12:40 - yeah especially for like once you take
12:42 - those hard classes
12:44 - um you really have to rely on like how
12:47 - much you want
12:48 - this like once you work in that specific
12:50 - industry
12:51 - feel like push you through those harder
12:52 - classes yeah
12:55 - um okay our next question
12:59 - is um for someone with no experience in
13:02 - coding
13:03 - is majoring in computer science feasible
13:07 - definitely like when i when i um started
13:11 - my cs major i had no experience in
13:13 - coding
13:14 - and it's definitely like doable the
13:17 - when colleges look at potential um
13:20 - applicants for like a cs degree
13:22 - they aren't exactly looking for like
13:23 - prior experience in coding
13:25 - because it's not you don't really
13:28 - really need to know like have coded for
13:30 - it to be
13:31 - like to have good good potential for
13:34 - coding
13:35 - it's more about your strength um how
13:38 - like
13:38 - well you are in like how good at you are
13:42 - in reasoning and like how good you are
13:44 - in math
13:46 - and honestly like even for internships
13:49 - and stuff
13:50 - the what they are looking for isn't
13:53 - really like
13:54 - oh how many languages do you know or
13:56 - like
13:57 - are you a linux master or anything
13:59 - they're looking for
14:00 - how quickly can you learn and how well
14:02 - you can communicate
14:08 - um for these people with no experience
14:11 - do you think they should do like outside
14:14 - of class
14:14 - kind of coding work by themselves
14:18 - i would recommend like even if you have
14:20 - experience
14:21 - like start working on personal projects
14:24 - and start exploring what you like
14:26 - about cs and which like which fields you
14:28 - like and what interests you in cs
14:30 - um a cs like just taking cs classes
14:34 - in college isn't enough to actually like
14:37 - to actually
14:39 - learn about what cs is like in industry
14:42 - um to be honest like a a lot of college
14:45 - classes don't teach you
14:46 - very important like industry relevant
14:48 - skills such as
14:49 - get or um or things like that
14:52 - so i would recommend like experience or
14:54 - no experience
14:56 - always like always be willing to learn
15:00 - outside of class
15:01 - and always be curious about like what
15:03 - classes don't teach you
15:04 - but what was your experience like
15:06 - transferring universities like
15:08 - did you have to travel a lot and um did
15:11 - you have to
15:12 - like go apartment hunting or were you
15:14 - living in the dorms and stuff
15:16 - before transferring universities it was
15:18 - like
15:19 - so when i was at michigan like my my
15:22 - family's in maryland so
15:23 - that was like a lot of traveling a lot
15:25 - of um
15:26 - a lot of apartment hunting um
15:30 - i would basically be away from home for
15:33 - like half a year
15:34 - um each year and then but like once i
15:37 - came back
15:38 - like i i kind of got lazy it was like
15:41 - i don't really want to apartment hunt
15:43 - and like apartments are too expensive
15:46 - in like a college town so i decided to
15:48 - just live at home and commute
15:50 - um besides that like
15:53 - i like i said like there was a big
15:56 - social change i had to like really get
15:58 - used to
16:00 - how um i had to adjust my expectations i
16:02 - guess because like university of
16:04 - maryland is
16:04 - a very large university um sometimes
16:07 - like
16:08 - like both physically and like
16:10 - people-wise so like it had a lot of
16:12 - money
16:12 - it could like afford a lot of like fancy
16:14 - stuff but also like
16:16 - my classes would sometimes be like a
16:18 - 45-minute walk away or something like
16:20 - that
16:21 - while like college park um or university
16:24 - of maryland
16:25 - was um it was very small like the
16:28 - longest i had to walk was 20 minutes and
16:30 - there were very few people
16:31 - and it didn't have like the budget
16:34 - behind
16:35 - like university of michigan so i had to
16:37 - really adjust
16:38 - my um expectations because like i
16:41 - couldn't
16:42 - expect like i can't expect um university
16:44 - of maryland to really
16:45 - match up like financially or like with
16:48 - like fancy buildings and stuff like that
16:50 - when as compared to university of
16:52 - michigan
16:53 - so it was just like getting used to a
16:56 - new place getting used to um
16:58 - getting used to a new department because
16:59 - i was transferring majors too
17:01 - and also like um having to
17:04 - adjust my credits and stuff so
17:08 - um i actually like lost half of my
17:10 - credits when i transferred to
17:12 - university of maryland i had like 90
17:14 - credits from my nursing school
17:16 - and then i um only 45 of them
17:18 - transferred because
17:19 - there's my nursing classes were too
17:21 - specific do you like match up to any of
17:23 - like university of maryland's
17:25 - requirements so it was sort of like it
17:28 - was sort of like going through all of
17:29 - that and like
17:30 - a little bit of um a little bit of
17:32 - paperwork trying to
17:34 - um count my crap as many of the of the
17:37 - credits that i could
17:40 - yeah um how like
17:43 - how important do you think the credits
17:45 - are to keep in mind for people who want
17:47 - to transfer majors like
17:48 - let's say that they want to drastically
17:50 - change their major from something
17:52 - um and they're going to lose a lot of
17:55 - credits
17:55 - at that point do you think it's worth
17:57 - the switch
18:01 - um i think like for that it depends on
18:05 - your priorities like for me the
18:09 - reason i made the switch was like i knew
18:12 - i couldn't last as like a nursing major
18:15 - i knew that like
18:16 - if i continued the nursing major and if
18:18 - i continue like taking more out
18:20 - picking up more hours at hospital i
18:21 - would get um burnt out eventually
18:24 - so um for me like the like sacrificing
18:28 - half of my credits
18:29 - was worth it because i knew i would i
18:31 - would be better off being a cs major
18:34 - and like at least be doing something
18:36 - where i wouldn't be like
18:37 - social like emotionally and mentally
18:39 - burnt out um
18:40 - but like if you're transferring and you
18:43 - um
18:44 - i would say like first like shop around
18:48 - so like make make sure you have a bunch
18:51 - of different
18:52 - alternatives so like if one school
18:53 - doesn't accept most of your credits
18:55 - maybe like another program does
18:58 - um i think the major thing is also um
19:02 - your gen ed so like a lot of um
19:05 - colleges will require some sort of like
19:07 - you have to have x amount of humanities
19:09 - x amount of stem credits
19:11 - no matter what major you are so um
19:15 - also keep that in mind and try like
19:17 - seeing how you can fit like
19:19 - your current majors classes into those
19:22 - gen eds um
19:24 - like to be honest like my situation was
19:26 - a little it was a little weird because
19:28 - for the nursing school they didn't have
19:30 - like these gen ed classes
19:32 - and that's like where i got hit the most
19:35 - when it came to like transferring
19:37 - transferring um colleges so
19:41 - um just like i would say like just try
19:44 - to keep your
19:46 - alternatives open we have a
19:49 - few questions i'll be asking them to
19:51 - jessica and so the first one
19:53 - um this person actually asked two
19:55 - questions and i'm going to start off
19:56 - with the first part
19:58 - the question was could you please speak
20:01 - more about
20:02 - the qualcomm internships jessica um sure
20:07 - so for my qualcomm internships i was
20:10 - for both my internships i was under
20:13 - their um
20:14 - their general android graphics like gpu
20:17 - unit
20:18 - or gpu department my first internship
20:21 - was during it was during my first
20:25 - semester
20:26 - or it was it was during the summer
20:29 - after my first year as a cs major
20:33 - um and that was sort of like working on
20:36 - internal tools
20:37 - um they wanted like uh they had like
20:40 - their an internal tool that was written
20:42 - in pearl
20:43 - which is a pretty cursed language and
20:46 - it forced them to like to um if force
20:50 - people on the team to like download
20:52 - large packages and stuff and go
20:53 - jump through a lot of hoops basically
20:55 - just to get that tool running
20:57 - so my job was just to translate that
21:01 - tool into python
21:02 - and then add like a graphic user
21:05 - interface on top
21:06 - plus like a command line interface on
21:09 - the side
21:10 - um and my second one was
21:14 - for their um their display um
21:17 - display processing unit team so like
21:20 - it was it was similar where i had to
21:23 - like i also had to work on their
21:25 - internal toys and that was
21:27 - but that was more um working more
21:29 - closely with
21:30 - their um their hardware so my second
21:33 - internship was
21:34 - involving like reading registers that
21:37 - were on like
21:38 - that were on the um on the
21:42 - dpu chip so it was
21:46 - they were about the same my first like
21:49 - my first one was in python my second
21:50 - one was um in c plus plus and then
21:54 - that was like when i learned c flows
21:57 - um do you know any internships for high
22:00 - school students
22:01 - um so
22:04 - i do know like google does have their
22:07 - step program
22:08 - and i think micros i want to say
22:10 - microsoft
22:12 - also has um
22:15 - also has a program geared towards high
22:18 - school students
22:19 - to be honest like most internships are
22:22 - um
22:24 - are focused on juniors and seniors
22:27 - in college because a lot of companies
22:29 - want to be able to hire you like
22:31 - within one or two years of you being an
22:34 - intern
22:35 - um but i think like if you look around
22:39 - or if you like ask local companies um
22:42 - they might be accepting high school
22:44 - students for internships
22:49 - okay sounds good our third question was
22:52 - um actually what do you hope to do after
22:55 - college
22:58 - um honestly like i'm not too sure
23:01 - um i like i guess like short term
23:04 - i want to like get like
23:08 - um work at qualcomm for a few more years
23:11 - hopefully
23:12 - like um
23:15 - depending like maybe transfer to um a
23:18 - different company hopefully apple or
23:19 - something
23:20 - um to be honest like i kind
23:24 - i kind of like i kind of got my qualcomm
23:27 - internship by chance and that's when i
23:29 - realized like
23:30 - like sort of you really don't know where
23:32 - like
23:34 - where um where life really takes you so
23:37 - like
23:38 - just like i don't know i don't know what
23:41 - i want to do after college probably just
23:43 - like
23:43 - work a few years hopefully like work my
23:45 - way up to like become a
23:47 - team manager maybe i don't know
23:50 - oh but what i do know is like i do want
23:53 - to get
23:54 - a graduate's degree um like for me
23:57 - personally like
23:59 - i don't think my undergrad education
24:02 - was a lot like i
24:05 - i feel like there's just so much to
24:06 - learn in cs and like i don't know
24:08 - i don't even know like a quarter of it
24:10 - to be honest
24:12 - even as a senior so definitely like get
24:14 - a graduate degree and actually like
24:17 - find out which which like subfield of cs
24:21 - really inspires me
24:25 - that makes sense our um next question
24:29 - is do you know of any scholarships for
24:33 - high school students
24:35 - scholarships for high school students um
24:43 - i would like firm from my experience
24:47 - a lot of the scholarships were from the
24:50 - universities department itself
24:52 - so like for example when i went to
24:55 - nursing school
24:57 - their department had a scholarship that
25:00 - they gave to me and then
25:01 - um i know for university of maryland
25:04 - specifically they have like
25:05 - that they have scholarships that will
25:09 - like like you can like get
25:12 - free
25:21 - um that like college board offers
25:25 - um but besides that like i personally
25:28 - didn't apply to a lot of scholarships
25:31 - like that were given by either
25:33 - foundations or private companies
25:36 - but like if you do once you go into ccs
25:38 - or stem um
25:39 - and you are like a woman you could there
25:42 - are definitely like scholarships out
25:43 - there for you
25:44 - that you can apply to
25:49 - okay sounds good um our next question
25:52 - was um actually about what
25:56 - is like the transition like from a more
25:58 - female dominated major to
26:00 - a more male-dominated one
26:03 - it was very jarring yeah like my
26:06 - my nursing school had like literally
26:08 - seven guys out of
26:10 - 170 175 students
26:13 - in the freshman class seven guys and
26:16 - then
26:16 - once i like went to ccs i was like oh my
26:19 - god there's so many guys around
26:21 - it was yeah it was very strange at first
26:24 - like
26:24 - i honestly didn't notice in in like the
26:27 - lower
26:28 - the um like the beginner classes so like
26:31 - intro to cs classes
26:33 - i got the impression that like it was
26:36 - relatively equal
26:38 - um male and female but like once you get
26:40 - into like
26:41 - the upper level classes where they're
26:44 - only like 30 some people
26:45 - then you realize like oh wow i'm like
26:47 - the only girl in class or something
26:49 - and it's i think like
26:53 - it was it was it was just very strange
27:03 - yeah that's understandable um our next
27:06 - question
27:07 - is um someone is asking
27:10 - um your advice like when is it the best
27:12 - time to do a college transfer in your
27:14 - opinion like freshman or sophomore
27:16 - year um what's
27:20 - the best time to college transfer
27:26 - that's tough like it really depends on
27:28 - where you are at the moment like
27:31 - i would say it's if you're transferring
27:33 - colleges like
27:36 - probably freshmen to be honest because
27:38 - like if you
27:39 - if you know like this major or this
27:41 - college isn't right for you
27:43 - it's best to get out as early as
27:45 - possible so you haven't like
27:47 - you haven't spent too much time too much
27:49 - too many resources or credits
27:51 - in this specific major and you haven't
27:53 - like committed too much to it
27:54 - that way like you can you can sort of
27:57 - like
27:58 - switch colleges like by the time you're
28:00 - a sophomore
28:01 - you've honestly made like you've already
28:04 - had like
28:05 - settled down in that college you've like
28:07 - you've made your group of friends
28:08 - hopefully and um you've you've already
28:12 - like built a life in that college
28:13 - because like you've already spent a year
28:15 - there
28:15 - so it's pretty hard to like to just like
28:19 - up and like leave that college so i
28:21 - would say like
28:22 - freshmen but like also i would say
28:27 - if you if you like aren't
28:31 - if you aren't sure but like you really
28:32 - like this major but like you aren't
28:34 - doing too hot in there or something like
28:36 - that
28:36 - um don't don't give up too easy i would
28:39 - say like
28:40 - there's find that like balance find like
28:43 - the there's like a fine line between
28:45 - between those two
28:48 - yeah it's it's honestly like hard to say
28:49 - to be honest
28:53 - yeah no that's definitely understandable
28:55 - um
28:56 - but our um next question is
28:59 - if you had any like specific personal
29:02 - experiences with the gender
29:03 - discrimination
29:05 - like with gender discrimination in
29:07 - general that we talked about earlier
29:10 - um personally no like university of
29:12 - maryland has been really good about like
29:14 - supporting women and stem
29:16 - um i've personally found like a lot of
29:19 - female friends who also do stem so it's
29:22 - like
29:23 - i haven't i haven't really felt isolated
29:26 - as
29:27 - like a woman in cs and i've been able to
29:30 - find like
29:30 - find friends and peers who are like also
29:35 - who are also in like a similar situation
29:36 - as i
29:38 - so personally i haven't like really
29:40 - experienced any discrimination
29:45 - that's really good um our next question
29:47 - actually goes back to the
29:49 - college transferring um and
29:52 - the person was asking if you're going to
29:54 - transfer colleges and you don't make the
29:56 - transfer if you don't like
29:58 - if they don't accept you does that
29:59 - damage anything from your current
30:01 - college
30:03 - that would really depend on your
30:05 - situation
30:06 - um
30:09 - so i think like
30:13 - because like in my situation i was
30:15 - transferring i was transferring from the
30:17 - nursing school
30:18 - um and at that point i had already like
30:21 - transferred
30:22 - i've had i had already um confirmed the
30:25 - transfer
30:26 - to like a separate department in like
30:29 - the university of michigan
30:31 - um it would really depend on
30:36 - on like the specific situation
30:39 - so if you
30:42 - i i would say like usually probably not
30:45 - because
30:48 - because when you're transferring
30:49 - colleges it's not like you've officially
30:51 - dropped out of like the current college
30:54 - you're um you're attending unless like
30:58 - you've
30:59 - actually confirmed like that you no
31:02 - longer attend
31:03 - with that college but if like say you
31:06 - apply
31:06 - to transfer to harvard or something and
31:08 - harvard doesn't accept you
31:10 - um it's as long as like you're still
31:13 - confirmed a student
31:14 - at like your current college i think
31:16 - like you'll be fine
31:18 - it's not like it's not like your your
31:20 - school will be like oh how dare you like
31:22 - try to transfer out and not be able to
31:24 - and then we'll attract like colleges
31:27 - aren't won't like
31:28 - be mad if you try to transfer out and it
31:31 - for one reason or another doesn't work
31:33 - out
31:36 - so you haven't had any experiences with
31:38 - like professors looking
31:40 - you well not you but like you wouldn't
31:41 - have any experiences with like
31:42 - professors looking down on you or like
31:44 - the other
31:45 - people just talking about about you type
31:48 - thing
31:50 - um
31:54 - not really like so when you're
31:58 - transferring like colleges and stuff
32:00 - that's between you and and maybe your
32:02 - advisor like
32:03 - i honestly didn't even tell my advisor
32:05 - that i was transferring colleges
32:07 - like it's like it could be between you
32:10 - and your advisor
32:11 - it doesn't have to be it's like that is
32:14 - like your own private business that like
32:16 - you're it's up to you to disclose to
32:18 - whoever
32:20 - whoever you want about like transferring
32:22 - and stuff like that
32:23 - um professors and stuff like if they
32:26 - look down on you for transferring i feel
32:27 - like that's on
32:28 - that's on them like i don't know
32:32 - i yeah i don't think like professors
32:35 - i haven't had professors like them
32:37 - because like i dealt with my
32:39 - transferring like
32:40 - very privately
32:45 - it's nice that you could do it privately
32:47 - i think that that's important
32:48 - um our next question was actually about
32:51 - like
32:52 - what websites or resources would you
32:55 - recommend for beginners trying to learn
32:56 - to code
32:58 - do you have any ideas um websites and
33:01 - resources
33:02 - um so for
33:06 - for um general like language and stuff
33:09 - languages and stuff
33:11 - um i know geeks for geeks
33:14 - and w3schools are pretty good if you're
33:17 - like looking up a quick reference
33:19 - or like you want to know like oh how do
33:21 - i make a class in java or something like
33:22 - that or
33:23 - what are the list functions of python
33:25 - those are two very helpful resources
33:28 - um i personally haven't used like i know
33:31 - a lot of people recommend
33:32 - sites like udemy or like sites that will
33:35 - like
33:36 - actually give you a crash course to a
33:39 - language but i personally
33:40 - don't use those a lot um this might
33:44 - i i haven't seen people recommend this
33:46 - but i would highly recommend
33:47 - you like read through any official
33:49 - documentation for that language
33:51 - that way like those are the most helpful
33:53 - sometimes like they might be hard to
33:55 - read
33:56 - and you might have to like sometimes the
33:58 - terminology is a little
33:59 - strange but i think like those are
34:02 - often the best resources otherwise it's
34:06 - just like looking through stack overflow
34:07 - questions or like
34:09 - looking through obscure email chains and
34:11 - stuff like that if your bug is really
34:13 - bad
34:18 - um our next question is
34:22 - um what is the most common language like
34:25 - of code that you have used most of the
34:27 - time that you have worked
34:28 - in yes um
34:36 - this is this one's really hard because
34:38 - like i've
34:40 - i've basically been learning like new
34:42 - languages every class
34:44 - for like each each different class i
34:46 - take but um
34:47 - i think like the most common one for me
34:49 - is probably c and c
34:50 - plus plus um because like oh
34:53 - my i'm learning a lot more like lower
34:56 - level stuff
34:57 - now so like i'm i've taken os i've taken
35:00 - an android systems classes
35:02 - class and those were like two c classes
35:05 - over the summer um
35:07 - i had to work with c plus plus and c
35:09 - plus plus is very similar to c
35:11 - um yeah aside from that i guess like
35:15 - java job was also pretty common
35:19 - yeah sounds good
35:22 - our next question was actually going
35:24 - back to your qualcomm internship
35:27 - could you describe i know you said that
35:28 - they reached out to you but could you
35:30 - describe like
35:31 - was there anything more specific about
35:33 - how they like how you found it or got
35:35 - your internship how they reached out to
35:36 - you
35:37 - that you could share um sure so like
35:41 - my like how i got my internship was
35:43 - basically like
35:44 - i don't know if you you you are familiar
35:47 - with um
35:48 - with the all women hackathon technica
35:52 - i basically like attended that my first
35:54 - semester that's
35:55 - it's like a i want to say it's like a
35:59 - 16 hour hack 16 or 48 hours i forgot
36:03 - but like it was uh it was over two days
36:06 - and then
36:07 - during that time like i um i basically
36:11 - did a project with my
36:12 - with my friend where like we wanted to
36:15 - learn python so
36:16 - i basically made like a like the game of
36:18 - snake in python
36:20 - with like using the pi game module and
36:22 - then added like
36:23 - some graphics and sound and then my
36:26 - friend was like a um
36:27 - she was an electrical engineering major
36:29 - so she knew a lot more about lower level
36:30 - stuff
36:31 - and she basically ported that onto
36:33 - dragon like qualcomm's dragon board 410c
36:36 - um they're like it's kind of like a
36:39 - raspberry pi
36:40 - but like basically that board and then
36:43 - like
36:44 - um she also like worked really closely
36:47 - with
36:47 - a few qualcomm engineers and recruiters
36:50 - who are like
36:51 - they're like sponsoring that challenge
36:55 - at the tech like at the hackathon
36:59 - um oh just give me your emails and like
37:04 - send you an invite to one of our special
37:07 - interview
37:08 - events during winter break and then i
37:10 - was like sure why not like
37:12 - i'm looking for like internships anyways
37:14 - um and i i don't even know like
37:16 - like at that point i i honestly didn't
37:18 - know what like qualcomm was as a company
37:20 - so i was like sure why not like i have
37:22 - nothing to lose
37:23 - um they sent me like an email a few
37:25 - weeks after the hackathon
37:28 - and then like throughout the entire
37:30 - process my parents were like this has to
37:32 - be a scam because like there's no way
37:34 - like
37:35 - there's no way like you got you got like
37:37 - an interview offered that
37:39 - like that easily um but during like
37:42 - winter break they just flew me out to
37:43 - california and we did like
37:45 - a two-day event where i did two
37:47 - technical interviews
37:48 - and then after that like they just gave
37:51 - me a
37:52 - gave me an offer
37:55 - so yeah i guess like the general just
37:57 - was i
37:58 - i got really lucky yeah
38:03 - that sounds awesome um our last question
38:06 - is actually i think a really good way to
38:07 - end
38:08 - offer panel um someone asked
38:11 - if you could comment or like the current
38:13 - job market for
38:14 - cs graduates like is it harder like how
38:17 - hard it is to get a job because of
38:19 - the cover 19 situation
38:22 - um yeah definitely like
38:26 - it's definitely way harder to get jobs
38:30 - in like in this current market because
38:32 - of covert um
38:33 - i know a lot of people have had their
38:35 - internships canceled
38:36 - and a lot of like full-time offers
38:38 - rescinded um
38:41 - yeah i know like some some companies are
38:44 - like still hiring
38:45 - or looking to hire i know like qualcomm
38:48 - is still
38:48 - interviewing and hiring people um but
38:52 - definitely like it's definitely a lot
38:53 - harder than usual
38:55 - to like to get a job for cs grads
38:58 - um hopefully like by the time you guys
39:01 - like graduate college and get a degree
39:02 - like it's
39:03 - it won't be like in this situation um
39:06 - but usually like the job market
39:08 - is really good for cs i know like a lot
39:10 - of people online sort of fake it out to
39:12 - be super competitive
39:13 - and like super super draining just to
39:15 - like do interviews and apply online
39:18 - but like to be honest that's if you're
39:20 - trying to like get the
39:21 - really fancy like google tech jobs
39:24 - but um yeah like in general
39:28 - it's not like if you if you have a cs
39:31 - degree you will find a job one way or
39:32 - another
39:33 - um it's just that like for because of
39:36 - covid like
39:37 - a lot of companies have been really
39:39 - cautious about
39:40 - actually hiring people due to like
39:42 - stocks dropping and stuff like that

40:04 - information
40:05 - on us girls code it as an organization
40:09 - um
40:10 - so what we do is uh we connect beginner
40:13 - coders with mentors so we're very
40:16 - a very beginner friendly organization
40:18 - where
40:19 - we're um you know taking in people who
40:21 - have no experience in coding
40:23 - mostly and then connecting them with
40:26 - people who do have experience
40:28 - and then for those who do have
40:29 - experience we do also have
40:31 - volunteer and leadership opportunities
40:33 - like for board positions um

40:37 - over here volunteers also do
40:40 - get volunteer hours um
40:43 - we welcome everyone all genders ages and
40:45 - backgrounds to the organization
40:47 - i know the name is girls code it but we
40:50 - we do strive to include everyone
40:53 - in our mission with an emphasis on
40:56 - closing the gender gap
40:58 - um we have a discord server where we can
41:01 - foster community among girls in computer
41:04 - science because
41:05 - we know it's very important to have that
41:07 - safe environment for
41:08 - women who want to do computer science
41:11 - once again
41:12 - all genders ages and backgrounds are
41:15 - welcomed in the server as well we
41:18 - promote coding education
41:20 - we provide classes and tutoring sessions

41:27 - up to get more information on when we
41:29 - are holding these classes and you can
41:31 - also sign up for tutoring sessions
41:33 - based on what you need help with
41:37 - so as of right now we added something on
41:40 - the tutoring site to

41:43 - help you with and what we cannot
41:45 - so before you do sign up for tutoring
