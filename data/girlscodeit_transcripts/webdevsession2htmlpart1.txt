00:00 - html is basically everything that is
00:02 - going to be in a web page
00:04 - so if we look at the inspect element and
00:07 - if we go into
00:08 - inspecting a web page if we click that
00:10 - inspect element it's going to be all of
00:12 - the code that we see
00:13 - in a web page so basically there's a
00:16 - couple elements of html that we're going
00:18 - to go through
00:19 - so an element is part of one html
00:22 - document and the document is basically
00:24 - that code that we see so it could be a
00:26 - piece of text
00:27 - like a paragraph or a header it could be
00:29 - an image a video
00:31 - or a link that takes us to a different
00:33 - website to declare where an element
00:35 - starts and ends you must enclose them in
00:37 - these tags and each
00:39 - feature is unique to each kind of tag oh
00:42 - i'm trying to
00:43 - make it okay i'm just gonna put that
00:45 - there for now um
00:46 - if there's a lot of questions and i
00:49 - can't see them please just feel free to
00:50 - yell at me
00:51 - um so most elements need an opening tag
00:55 - and a closing tag and i'm gonna change
00:56 - that most
00:57 - to all so everything we're going to be
00:59 - using today requires an opening and a
01:01 - closing element and that tells the
01:02 - computer
01:03 - that what's inside that these closing
01:05 - and opening salmon
01:07 - co opening and closing elements is our
01:10 - content
01:10 - so it's like a sandwich you have the two
01:12 - pieces of bread and whatever is in the
01:14 - middle is your contents of your sandwich
01:16 - um that's basically the same thing one
01:18 - of the examples that we're gonna go over
01:19 - today is a paragraph
01:21 - very very simple paragraph p
01:24 - p that denotes your paragraph one of the
01:26 - big things you want to note with html
01:28 - though is
01:29 - that you have an opening tag as shown
01:31 - here and a closing tag
01:33 - your opening tag is always going to be
01:37 - carrot bracket element that you're
01:39 - talking about so like a letter
01:40 - a series of characters closing carrot
01:44 - all of the things that are in that
01:47 - and then you're gonna have your carrot
01:50 - your closing bracket
01:52 - think of this as like the door that
01:53 - closes your element tag
01:55 - you always need this to close the
01:57 - element tag and you only need in the
01:58 - closing tag
01:59 - and then that same set of characters and
02:01 - then your closing carrot tag
02:03 - does that make sense to everyone perfect
02:06 - um i'm gonna move on here um okay so an
02:10 - attribute um an attribute gives
02:12 - additional information about an element
02:14 - just like an
02:14 - attribute of an object in the real world
02:18 - gives us more information about that
02:19 - object in the real world so
02:21 - attributes add style links image sizes
02:24 - classes
02:24 - ids etc this is mostly going to be
02:28 - when you think of style stuff most of
02:31 - this
02:32 - is going to be under css which is
02:34 - cascading style sheets which is going to
02:36 - be
02:36 - all of your pretty things about a web
02:38 - page
02:39 - but we can use it in html for things
02:43 - like images
02:44 - which is an example here any html
02:47 - element can have attributes
02:48 - attributes are always declared in the
02:50 - opening tag and they're usually in the
02:51 - format
02:52 - attribute equals a given value
02:55 - so in this one i should have
02:59 - thought about this before i said all
03:01 - they are right it is most
03:03 - um so this is your example your example
03:06 - of your image tag and we're going to go
03:07 - through this because this is one of the
03:08 - most unique
03:09 - tags we see in html so first we're going
03:12 - to have our opening caret
03:14 - same thing we always have our tag which
03:16 - is our series of characters
03:18 - or characters just like the p from the
03:19 - paragraph tag this is img
03:22 - so image so when you think about it src
03:26 - i know that can sound like really weird
03:28 - but if you think about it as source
03:30 - we have image the source of the image
03:33 - the source of the image equals this link
03:37 - and this is how you insert every single
03:39 - image into html files because
03:41 - what you do is you say okay carrot
03:45 - i have an image that image's source
03:48 - is this link and it's just a
03:51 - url or a jpeg link or
03:55 - other image file link name insert here
03:58 - and it's just within those two brackets
04:01 - so
04:01 - that's a this is my source this is how
04:03 - to call it and then you just close it
04:05 - off
04:05 - with your carrot bracket and your your
04:08 - slash and that's
04:09 - basically it it's just as simple as that
04:10 - you can really just take a link off of
04:12 - google images put it in between those
04:15 - two
04:16 - brackets and call it your image and that
04:19 - will insert it into your html file
04:21 - um so the structure of html documents
04:24 - we're not going to get into this too
04:25 - much right now
04:26 - but document root your html so your html
04:31 - file
04:32 - and then head title um
04:35 - href stuff which is you'll see that when
04:37 - we get into the replica file but it's
04:39 - basically just like your standard stuff
04:41 - body elements um and then
04:44 - text header all that stuff so structure
04:47 - of an html example you're going to see
04:49 - this in the example we're going to use
04:50 - today
04:51 - doctype.html what does this mean this
04:54 - means
04:55 - that our file is an html file it's not a
04:58 - java file it's not a python file it's
05:00 - not a javascript file
05:01 - it's an html file so doctype is html
05:06 - one this line is talking to html
05:10 - so first of all we're going to note that
05:12 - we have html opening tags and html
05:14 - closing tags
05:16 - just like we have everything else
05:17 - there's an opening and a closing this
05:19 - denotes that anything inside of those
05:21 - two tags
05:21 - is html code it will be read by the
05:24 - compiler in the html code
05:26 - it will be read by the browser's html
05:28 - code so these are really really
05:30 - important to have
05:32 - second head the head tag includes
05:36 - metadata about the webpage or other
05:39 - introductory information
05:41 - um you're going to notice that like
05:44 - i don't know the head is kind of a weird
05:47 - one
05:48 - we're not going to touch on it too much
05:49 - for now because you're not going to
05:50 - really need it
05:51 - but know that it doesn't really give you
05:53 - content so the the head
05:54 - is not really showing up on the screen
05:56 - as anything it's not like a header
05:59 - so this h1 is a header
06:02 - and this is the header that we see and
06:05 - this prints on the screen
06:06 - welcome as a header the one tricky thing
06:11 - about headers is that the number that is
06:14 - here
06:15 - in the opening and closing bracket for
06:18 - headers
06:19 - matters so i had a really good example
06:21 - of this
06:22 - um but basically play around with it
06:26 - when you're
06:26 - making your websites today the headers
06:30 - matter because they change what the
06:31 - header looks like
06:33 - so you can always change it back in um
06:37 - css but headers
06:40 - come with their own css like just
06:43 - inherently
06:44 - it's not like that bad like it's like
06:45 - header one is bigger than header two
06:48 - and it goes all the way up to header six
06:50 - so for easy css work if you think your
06:53 - header's too big
06:54 - just decrease the number and if you
06:56 - think your head is too small increase
06:57 - the number
06:58 - um if you're having a little bit of
06:59 - trouble with that call me over when
07:01 - we're doing reply and i'll be happy to
07:02 - help you
07:03 - um body so this is the body of your
07:06 - webpage it comes below your headers and
07:08 - it comes above your footers there's no
07:10 - example of the footer here
07:11 - but your footers anything that's at the
07:13 - bottom of your web page anything that's
07:15 - in the body is going to be like the
07:16 - middle
07:17 - the meat of your web page and example
07:21 - paragraph this is text now i know we
07:24 - talked about how the headers
07:25 - how the number here matters in
07:27 - paragraphs we don't have that in html
07:30 - all paragraphs regardless of the number
07:32 - here look
07:33 - exactly the same you could have
07:35 - paragraph 155
07:37 - and it would look exactly the same as
07:38 - paragraph one
07:40 - so that's just something to keep in mind
07:41 - headers the number here matters
07:43 - and yes
07:46 - hyperlink uh what would be the
07:48 - difference between like an h6 versus a
07:50 - paragraph would they be the same size
07:52 - um they're a little different the header
07:55 - six
07:56 - is a little bit more bold um
08:00 - i i mean if you're really interested
08:02 - just play around with it honestly the
08:04 - whole point of web pages is just to play
08:06 - around with it
08:07 - but yeah so definitely play around with
08:10 - it but
08:11 - i mean if you don't like it you can
08:13 - always just take it out but yeah it's a
08:15 - little bit more bold
08:16 - um so linking css and javascript css and
08:19 - javascript can be used html in two
08:21 - different ways
08:22 - internally in the same file that's why
08:24 - we have our html opening and closing
08:26 - tags
08:26 - because we can use html and css in the
08:29 - same file so we want to differentiate
08:31 - between our html and css
08:33 - or externally in different files which
08:35 - is going to be the example we're using
08:36 - today
08:37 - so you'll notice when i go through the
08:39 - replica example that the html file
08:41 - will have a link to both the javascript
08:43 - file don't worry about that today
08:46 - and the css file probably don't worry
08:48 - about that today
08:49 - and you'll see how we're able to link
08:50 - the files externally
08:52 - to the html file so that all of it is
08:54 - referring to the same web page
08:57 - externally is recommended that's what
08:58 - we're using today
09:00 - more organized and different html files
09:02 - can use the same css and javascript
09:04 - files
09:05 - so how do we link the files great
09:08 - question
09:10 - perfect so linking this is exactly what
09:12 - you're going to see
09:13 - in our replied example today um
09:17 - so this is the code right here it's kind
09:20 - of in a little pink box
09:22 - um so it says script script file
09:25 - source equals script.javascript
09:29 - now what's i remember we had a question
09:32 - about what's between the brackets does
09:33 - this are the quotation marks excuse me
09:36 - the quotation marks does that matter for
09:38 - this
09:39 - it does because what is in between these
09:42 - quotation marks to link your files
09:45 - must be the exact same as your file name
09:48 - otherwise it won't link because it will
09:52 - be trying to look for a file that
09:53 - doesn't exist
09:54 - so that's why we need to have the exact
09:56 - same
09:57 - file an easy trick to do that is
10:01 - i always like to use my
10:04 - html file so if i have index.html
10:08 - i'm going to have index.javascript and
10:11 - index.css
10:12 - so that i know all of these files are
10:14 - linked to that specific html file
10:16 - so i don't get confused but since we're
10:18 - only working with one html file today
10:20 - it's okay just be careful with it but i
10:22 - think the default is
10:24 - script.javascript and style.css
10:27 - we have a question what does meta stand
10:30 - for
10:32 - oh i think you can still see meta on
10:33 - this
10:36 - no oh yes mata so
10:39 - meta is we're gonna use it in this
10:41 - example
10:42 - so meta is an inherent um
10:46 - attribute not an attribute but it's like
10:47 - an inherent um
10:50 - line and basically it's bringing in
10:56 - like an attribute of the site so
11:01 - basically it's like it's it's kind of
11:04 - like the
11:04 - overlying css but i would rather call it
11:08 - principles than styling so if we see
11:11 - here
11:12 - meta is telling us that our content
11:15 - has to be the width of the device
11:18 - it can't be larger and it can't be
11:20 - shorter because that just
11:22 - makes for easy viewing experience this
11:25 - meta
11:26 - is telling us that our character set of
11:28 - the site which
11:29 - links into css is utf-8 which is a given
11:34 - character set that's probably
11:36 - in our css file so meta is like our
11:39 - overarching rules that our site has to
11:42 - go by
11:43 - yeah so like meta is going to be in
11:46 - basically everything
11:47 - don't worry about it for today um here
11:50 - let's show the replica example because i
11:52 - feel like that will help us more than
11:54 - looking at this
11:56 - so this is your replica file that we're
11:58 - all going to use today you're going to
11:59 - fork it
12:00 - but it's going to be yours um i made a
12:03 - starter site for you all
12:05 - um it's about harry potter but you know
12:07 - it works
12:08 - so this meta is linking our character
12:12 - set
12:12 - um i don't really have any css in here i
12:14 - just put some sample
12:16 - but the cf the meta is only going to be
12:18 - found
12:19 - in the like html file
12:23 - but whatever it's linking could be in
12:25 - like other files
12:27 - so i mean this is like a standard
12:29 - character set
12:30 - utf-8 it's like a standard like web
12:33 - browser friendly character set
12:35 - character set if you've noticed not
12:38 - every single web file out there
12:40 - is one font right i have one font here
12:44 - i have a different font in my
12:47 - google slides i have a different font
12:49 - for this run button
12:51 - not every single web thing is the same
12:54 - font
12:55 - a character set is what kind of allows
12:58 - us
12:58 - to dictate not only the characters we're
13:01 - using
13:02 - but like also that font so um oh sorry
13:07 - that's completely wrong that's font
13:09 - family character set is
13:11 - the characters we're using so are we
13:13 - using
13:14 - cyrillic letters are we using the
13:16 - spanish alphabet are we using
13:18 - the greek alphabet are we using english
13:21 - like the anglican alphabet like what are
13:22 - we using
13:23 - that's our character set yes so it's the
13:26 - letters like the specific alphabet we're
13:28 - using
13:28 - i'm so sorry that was really confusing i
13:31 - didn't explain that well
13:33 - um but yes so that's our character set
13:36 - and then our meta is basically just like
13:38 - bringing that in telling the computer
13:40 - this is the character set we're
13:41 - specifically using recognize these
13:42 - characters
13:44 - i see chat so i think this is just an
13:46 - example but i think
13:48 - i mean with device width like if you're
13:51 - talking
13:51 - generally like height doesn't really
13:54 - matter right
13:55 - because if we're scrolling through a web
13:56 - page our dictated height
13:59 - is like our web page is going to be
14:00 - longer than our computer right but we
14:02 - can scroll down
14:04 - right so our height isn't necessarily a
14:06 - factor
14:07 - but our width matters because if our
14:09 - width is
14:10 - 500 feet long and my laptop screen is 15
14:13 - inches
14:14 - it's not going to work so by making
14:16 - width equals device width we can have
14:18 - this
14:18 - rectangle that is the standard width so
14:22 - our
14:22 - content is able to show up on screen but
14:25 - the height doesn't matter because we can
14:27 - just scroll through and adjust height as
14:29 - we see fit
14:30 - okay yeah does that make sense yeah then
14:34 - why isn't content in a separate meta
14:38 - um honestly
14:42 - it's for simplicity's sake because this
14:44 - meta is talking about the viewing
14:47 - so like name viewport like this is like
14:50 - the viewing
14:51 - meta and then the content of that meta
14:54 - is how we're able to view the given web
14:57 - page
14:58 - we always say ahrefs just because it's
15:00 - easier but totally go for href i'm just
15:03 - trying to find
15:03 - where the given ah attribute href
15:07 - um ahref is like a weird one i'm trying
15:10 - to see
15:11 - i might have a better example of it in
15:13 - my
15:14 - um replit to show you
15:17 - here this is an href
15:22 - so this is inserting a link
15:26 - which is like the challenge for today um
15:29 - having so hrefs are always enclosed in
15:32 - the a tag so this is my href
15:34 - i have an a tag with
15:39 - this but it closes over here so
15:42 - href so a open we leave the tag open
15:46 - because ahrefs are within
15:48 - one opening tag um they're kind of weird
15:50 - like that they're an exception of html
15:52 - but it's how we insert links into other
15:54 - web pages so
15:55 - it's how we are able to have multiple
15:57 - web pages on the same web page so
16:00 - say you're on amazon and you want to
16:02 - click the checkout button
16:04 - the checkout button is an href button
16:07 - because the checkout window is not the
16:09 - same window that you just bought
16:11 - slippers in right so ahref is how we are
16:15 - able to link sites together
16:16 - so href this is my link it's like
16:20 - the example like we linked harry potter
16:22 - because it's a harry potter example site
16:25 - so this is our href link to the site and
16:28 - then
16:28 - below that we have what it would say if
16:31 - somehow the link didn't show
16:33 - because you always want to have an
16:34 - alternate something goes wrong
16:36 - so below that it says summary and that's
16:38 - what would show
16:40 - oh no that's not the alternate sorry
16:42 - summary is what shows
16:44 - as the link so i'm going to refresh this
16:45 - and you're going to see the webpage
16:48 - if it i have to run it perfect
16:51 - so this is my href right here href it
16:54 - says summary
16:56 - but it is my href because if i click on
16:58 - it
17:00 - it's going to open wikipedia because
17:02 - that's my href and it linked the sites
17:04 - together
17:05 - so href is our linking bridge between
17:08 - one site and another
17:10 - so that's our tag to do that well not
17:13 - our tag but it's our operator to do that
17:15 - our tag is the a
17:17 - i was gonna put these in but i think we
17:20 - can go through it
17:21 - body tags what goes in a body tag can
17:23 - someone tell me
17:27 - i'll look in chat too to see if anyone
17:30 - had said it in the chat
17:37 - body text yeah so body is like the meat
17:40 - of our website
17:41 - um we can have paragraphs we can have
17:42 - headers but that's what goes inside the
17:45 - body tags
17:46 - paragraph tags what goes in there a
17:49 - paragraph
17:50 - um and what attributes do you need to
17:53 - use to link css to html
17:56 - href so what i said before href is our
17:58 - bridge
18:00 - from one to another here we're using
18:03 - href to link our css sheet to our html
18:08 - seat we can also use it to link
18:09 - our um one web page to another
18:13 - but they can do a lot of different
18:14 - things but think of them as bridges
18:16 - linking one thing to another
18:18 - and a rel is
18:21 - like the name it's like
18:24 - i it's hard to explain but you don't
18:27 - need to worry about it right now
18:29 - the most thing you're gonna have to
18:30 - worry about is the href because that's
18:32 - inserting a link in there
18:34 - it's like rel is like how it's like
18:36 - referred to
18:37 - basically so we're gonna make a webpage
18:41 - today is everyone excited about it
18:43 - um honestly it's a really fun workshop
18:46 - i'm gonna
18:47 - because if you copy and paste it you're
18:48 - editing the communal one
18:50 - can everyone see my screen again we're
18:51 - gonna go through forking it
18:55 - okay great we're gonna see this little
18:58 - arrow
18:59 - this little arrow right here can
19:01 - everyone see that we're gonna click it
19:05 - and we're gonna hit this button it says
19:08 - fork
19:11 - yes everyone sees that perfect yes can
19:14 - everyone see that
19:16 - awesome once you click that button
19:20 - see it opens a new one see how it
19:23 - changed to part 1-3
19:25 - this is now my own reply no one can see
19:28 - it except for me
19:29 - this is the original once you forked it
19:31 - i want you to close the original
19:33 - because that means that you have all the
19:36 - codes you need right here
19:39 - and you're not editing anyone else's by
19:40 - accident
19:42 - forking it means that you're basically
19:44 - taking the one
19:46 - that was given you're making an
19:48 - identical copy
19:49 - and then that identical copy is unique
19:51 - to you so
19:52 - the file that i gave you is access to
19:55 - everyone it's accessed publicly
19:56 - so that means even after this workshop
19:58 - you want to go back to it you're more
19:59 - than welcome to do so
20:01 - by forking it you're creating your own
20:03 - unique copy of that file
20:04 - that you can edit without changing the
20:07 - original file
20:08 - so that the original file maintains its
20:11 - like coding integrity
20:12 - because we don't want to have that file
20:14 - be all messed up and then people are
20:16 - looking at it for reference and then
20:18 - h tags are all wrong and then paragraphs
20:21 - are a little bit weird so we want to
20:22 - make sure that that
20:24 - is maintaining the same can you fork
20:27 - any code um in reply specifically or
20:31 - like just in general
20:35 - in general so a lot of the code builders
20:39 - are so i mean i've used at least for
20:41 - html and css i've used mozilla thimble
20:44 - i've used glitch i've used droplet every
20:46 - single one of those services
20:48 - are going to allow you to fork it um
20:50 - they might not call in it forking it
20:51 - they might call it making a copy
20:54 - um they might call it making a reference
20:56 - but every single one of those services
20:58 - have allowed you to do that
20:59 - now in terms of like i have a question
21:02 - here that's about those
21:04 - gray tags um those are not tags
21:07 - let's talk about them um i'm gonna share
21:10 - my screen again
21:11 - um thumbs up we can see my screen
21:16 - awesome so i think what that comment is
21:18 - referring to
21:19 - is these um these little gray
21:22 - text blurbs um these are not tags these
21:26 - are comments
21:27 - so comments are really really useful
21:28 - when we're coding because it allows us
21:30 - to
21:31 - understand our code just in like plain
21:33 - simple english
21:34 - so this comment is saying import the web
21:36 - pages style sheet
21:38 - because that's what this line of code
21:40 - does
21:41 - i see a chat okay
21:44 - um yeah so that's what this line of code
21:47 - does
21:48 - so these comments how you make a comment
21:50 - is you do carrot
21:51 - exclamation point dash dash
21:54 - i mean the dash dash isn't necessary
21:56 - that's just because we wanted to have
21:57 - that centered
21:58 - but it's carrot exclamation point
22:01 - closed carrot and anything within the
22:03 - carrots is considered your comment
22:04 - it doesn't affect how the code runs and
22:06 - it's only visible to you the person
22:08 - who's coding
22:09 - and it basically just tells you whatever
22:12 - you want it to tell you
22:13 - so i can edit my comment to say fluffy
22:15 - bunnies are amazing but that doesn't
22:17 - really give me a whole lot of
22:18 - information about my code
22:19 - so coders often use comments um
22:22 - to just tell us what is happening with
22:24 - the given segment of code
22:26 - um so you can use them as often or as
22:29 - little as you want you could have no
22:30 - comments in your code and it would run
22:32 - completely the same as if you had 500
22:34 - comments
22:35 - so comments are just really there for
22:36 - the coder to understand what's going on
22:38 - or it's for if the coder wants to share
22:40 - their code with people
22:41 - we can put comments in to let the other
22:43 - people know what's going on with the
22:45 - code
22:46 - now while i have yes i see another chat
22:49 - what's going on
22:50 - how can i center my heading that's a
22:53 - great question
22:54 - um i'm going to give people a little bit
22:56 - of time
22:58 - centering your heading is something that
22:59 - happens in css so we're not going to
23:02 - really touch on that today because we
23:03 - didn't do any css coding
23:04 - but if you go into style.css which you
23:07 - also have access to because you forked
23:09 - the file
23:10 - body h1 image with
23:14 - font style color background color these
23:16 - are very very basic
23:18 - so play around with them um
23:22 - but if you go i'm gonna give you a hint
23:24 - and if you still can't figure it out
23:26 - come back to me after i've helped um
23:28 - her find the replit file but
23:31 - i'm gonna give you a hint that says you
23:34 - have to put something in here
23:36 - that tells you about the margins on
23:38 - either side
23:40 - of the header so that's all i'm going to
23:42 - say for now
23:43 - i'm going to stop sharing my screen and
23:45 - i want you guys to go
23:47 - into the file and i want you to take
23:49 - everything that's like black
23:50 - text so you'll see like black text it
23:52 - says harry potter
23:53 - talks about all about harry potter i
23:55 - want you to change all of that
23:57 - i want you to make it a web page about
23:59 - something that interests you
24:00 - it could be your favorite food your dog
24:03 - your favorite class at school
24:05 - um it could be about anything and i want
24:08 - you to make a web page
24:09 - that tells me about that thing so
24:12 - so this is the website right here this
24:14 - is the link

24:17 - link i want you to copy and paste
24:18 - whatever website link you want into that

24:46 - quotation marks still there
24:48 - and i want to center my cursor in the
24:50 - middle of those two
24:51 - quotation marks then i'm going to ctrl v
24:54 - paste my new link in there and then i'm
24:56 - going to go to the summary
24:58 - um that's what the word says in order to
25:00 - clink on the link
25:01 - and i'm gonna make it so it says like
25:04 - link

25:25 - so um we're going to use our example of
25:28 - dogs again hold up let me
25:29 - refresh the page the replit page so you
25:31 - guys can understand what i just did for
25:33 - emmanuella who asked the question about
25:35 - inserting the link yes
25:39 - do website need to cite the source of
25:41 - images that's a really good question
25:43 - for this no because you know like
25:47 - if you're just using it for fun like no
25:49 - that's fine
25:50 - um oh always make sure if you want to
25:53 - see
25:54 - your web page you have to click run
25:57 - and then do that so
26:00 - emmanuella i don't know if you're still
26:02 - here but basically our link
26:04 - was this and i changed it so this is
26:06 - what it says
26:07 - but this is the link it goes to so
26:09 - that's how you change a link
26:11 - um okay perfect we can
26:14 - that's how you would change a link so i
26:16 - hope that kind of made sense

26:20 - gonna share the screen again
26:22 - perfect okay now next question
26:26 - changing images awesome let's do that
26:27 - now so we're gonna go back to our use of
26:30 - dogs
26:31 - um we're gonna go to images little i'm
26:34 - trying to find one
26:35 - that has like
26:39 - not a whole lot of um not a whole
26:43 - because a lot of these
26:44 - perfect this one so i'm gonna go here
26:47 - i'm gonna find an image i want on
26:49 - google i'm gonna copy so i'm going to
26:52 - right click and i'm going to play
26:53 - copy image address okay we're going to
26:56 - copy image address
26:57 - click then i see chats i'm going to get
27:00 - those in two seconds
27:02 - if we see image source equals same thing
27:06 - as the web page we're going to go
27:07 - everything in between those two
27:09 - quotation marks i want you to delete it
27:11 - delete it and then we're going to paste
27:14 - our new image link
27:15 - which is really long because it's an
27:17 - image source link
27:18 - why is it so long didn't realize it was
27:20 - that long okay we're going to control z
27:22 - but basically you want to paste your
27:25 - image source link
27:27 - um okay let's try this one
27:32 - i'm trying to find one that has like a
27:33 - short one that we can
27:35 - um use but it's like not really working
27:39 - all that well because a lot of these
27:42 - have just like really long image links
27:43 - for no reason
27:44 - anyway sorry about that so we're going
27:47 - to paste our new image link in there
27:49 - it's going to be long it's going to be
27:50 - gross looking but that's usually how
27:51 - image links are
27:53 - then this is our alt text our alt text
27:55 - is what shows up if an image doesn't
27:57 - render
27:58 - so we're going to change that to like a
27:59 - picture of a dog
28:02 - because that's what this image is a
28:04 - picture of a dog
28:05 - then you're going to see right now in my
28:08 - webpage it was a picture of the harry
28:09 - potter cast because that's what my
28:10 - original image link was
28:12 - if i refresh it or i have to run it
28:16 - it's a picture of a dog now because we
28:18 - changed our image link
28:20 - to the link that was like the image
