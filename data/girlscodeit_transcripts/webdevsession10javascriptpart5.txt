00:00 - now the session's officially recording
00:02 - and
00:03 - i'm going to share my screen and we're
00:04 - going to get into javascript part 5.
00:06 - get excited get hyped uh oh this is our
00:09 - project
00:10 - ignore that that's our project okay
00:12 - let's do
00:13 - javascript part 5 guys so
00:16 - today we're gonna be talking about
00:18 - manipulating the dom
00:19 - now what is the dom well you already
00:21 - know what the dom is
00:22 - the dom is the document object model
00:26 - and it's a tree like representation
00:29 - of the contents of a web page so let's
00:32 - go to our demo replay link
00:35 - um our lovely instructor christian made
00:37 - this for us um
00:38 - this is some like manipulating the dom
00:40 - examples so it's basically just like
00:42 - the content of our web page see we have
00:45 - this one that's highlighted blue
00:47 - you know this one that is green in color
00:49 - a little bit you can't really tell
00:51 - but this is what the dom is the job is
00:52 - our content of our webpage and
00:53 - manipulating the dom is manipulating the
00:55 - contents of our web page
00:56 - so yeah it's a fun it's a fun lesson
01:00 - um ids is basically
01:03 - not ids why did i read it like that ids
01:07 - giving an element an id attribute allows
01:10 - it to be selected in the javascript code
01:11 - so basically by saying
01:13 - oh this element like giving it an id
01:16 - name like
01:17 - giving it identification it allows it to
01:18 - be used within the javascript code which
01:20 - therefore allows us to manipulate the
01:22 - dom
01:23 - a specific can i a specific id cannot be
01:25 - reused by other elements
01:27 - this is important to note because you
01:29 - don't want to have two things that are
01:31 - like going on at the same time um that's
01:34 - also important to note because
01:35 - if you name like it won't run if you
01:37 - name things the same thing and if you
01:39 - name things the same name it might run
01:41 - but it might just manipulate things in a
01:43 - way that you don't want them to
01:44 - so always make sure you're using
01:45 - different names for different things so
01:47 - they correspond correctly when you're
01:48 - manipulating the dom all right
01:52 - um fetching elements so remember how we
01:55 - have each element each element has an id
01:57 - name
01:58 - so the fetching elements we're going to
02:00 - say
02:01 - this is kind of like the syntax of it if
02:02 - we can let me use my pointer
02:04 - this is like the syntax of it so like
02:07 - dot get element by id and then bracket
02:11 - id
02:11 - name let's talk about through this so
02:15 - document.get so we're going to say okay
02:17 - get the thing so in the document we're
02:19 - going to get it
02:20 - get element by id so we're going to say
02:23 - okay you're going to get an element but
02:25 - you're going to get it through its id
02:27 - you're not going to get it through like
02:28 - a tag like headers you're going to get
02:30 - it through like its specific element
02:32 - name
02:32 - and you're going to put the element name
02:34 - in these brackets
02:36 - yeah hopefully that makes some sense um
02:38 - i want to take note that like
02:40 - these are case sensitive so you notice
02:42 - how we have some weird like
02:43 - all lowercase all lowercase and then
02:46 - capital of the first letter capital the
02:48 - first letter capital the first letter
02:50 - these are case sensitive so like be
02:51 - careful with that when you're doing it
02:53 - um and that's just the one thing to note
02:54 - when we're going through when you're
02:56 - saying document.getelementbyid
02:58 - a string is passed on to dot
03:01 - getelementbyid
03:02 - as an argument and can be saved into a
03:05 - variable
03:06 - so we're just manipulating it into
03:08 - different various forms of data
03:10 - and saving it into a variable allows to
03:12 - be manipulated later on
03:14 - which is useful when we're doing things
03:16 - like counters for example
03:18 - um all elements with a certain class
03:20 - name can be fetched by get elements
03:22 - by class name yeah so like a class
03:26 - like um middle a class
03:29 - like i think we have um a class called
03:33 - the middle
03:34 - in the example today so i'm going to use
03:36 - that example like class so it would be
03:38 - like dot get elements
03:39 - by class name bracket middle
03:44 - so that would be what you're going to
03:45 - see in the code today um
03:47 - here's an example of that is a syntax a
03:49 - variable element
03:50 - so an element called variable or a
03:53 - variable called
03:54 - element equals document.getelementbyid
04:00 - id so the name is id lowercase
04:03 - how's it going so far do we have some
04:05 - questions how are we feeling
04:06 - yes no maybe i'm gonna look at the chat
04:10 - yeah yes or no maybe thumbs up thumbs
04:12 - down
04:16 - i see no thumbs up i see no thumbs up
04:18 - okay one thumbs up
04:20 - chat can you explain that again okay
04:23 - what is i'm gonna explain fetching
04:25 - elements again okay so fetching elements
04:27 - basically just means when we want to
04:28 - work with a specific element
04:30 - we're going to call it so remember how
04:31 - we like called variables we called
04:33 - methods we called functions
04:36 - not methods because you guys don't know
04:38 - about methods yet we're doing that today
04:40 - calling functions remember how we called
04:41 - functions and we said like
04:43 - function you know and then we called it
04:45 - by saying the function name
04:46 - and then brackets so it's basically the
04:48 - same thing whenever we want to
04:49 - manipulate an element we just have to
04:50 - call it with this specific syntax
04:53 - yeah so this is the specific syntax to
04:55 - call an element and when we call it
04:57 - we're just calling it so we can work
04:59 - with it and manipulate it
05:01 - okay so
05:04 - um event listeners um after fetching
05:08 - elements an event
05:09 - that uh an event on that element can
05:12 - trigger
05:13 - javascript code to run yeah so what
05:16 - event listeners kind of are
05:17 - if we're going to think about it in like
05:18 - layman's terms is that an event listener
05:21 - is like it's like a puppy right
05:24 - so the puppy sits there and sits there
05:26 - and it sits there and it sits there
05:28 - and the puppy waits for key words right
05:31 - so if you say come the puppy will come
05:32 - to you if you say sit the puppy sits
05:36 - event listeners are just like that so
05:37 - when you give them specific commands
05:39 - they listen for specific things
05:41 - and when those specific things happen
05:42 - they complete actions accordingly
05:45 - so like when you say sit the event
05:46 - listener would sit if you say
05:49 - come to me the event listener would come
05:50 - to you as like a
05:52 - puppy example we use them in java
05:55 - because we went to say like when this
05:57 - thing happens
05:58 - trigger this line of code so like say if
06:01 - we have
06:01 - a dice game where we pick random numbers
06:03 - and we say like oh like you're like
06:05 - we're rolling
06:06 - digital dice and we pick random numbers
06:08 - our event listener could be like if we
06:10 - roll
06:11 - two sixes trigger code like you won the
06:14 - game
06:14 - you know like that's a good example of
06:16 - event listener so when something happens
06:18 - the event listener picks that thing up
06:20 - and then executes code
06:22 - um events can also range from actions
06:26 - just like
06:26 - keys or clicks so like when you click on
06:29 - a web page that could be an event
06:31 - this is the example for add event
06:33 - listener click
06:34 - so like when we this would be add dot
06:37 - event listener so add event listener
06:39 - click so when we click the web page
06:42 - display date so it would display
06:44 - the date the given date and we can do
06:46 - that because date is like a programmed
06:48 - in function in java so you can always
06:49 - like get date and time and you don't
06:51 - have to do external programming for that
06:54 - yeah yes no maybe i'll go back yes no
06:57 - maybe
06:58 - hopefully yes no baby
07:05 - what does the event listener do the
07:07 - event listener
07:09 - just listens for the event and then
07:11 - tells the subsequent code to run
07:15 - so that's what the event listener is the
07:16 - event listener just like waits for a
07:17 - certain thing to happen and then once
07:18 - that thing happens it just tells the
07:20 - code that this thing happened
07:21 - so that like code can run
07:25 - yeah so it's basically just like an
07:26 - intermediary kind of
07:30 - yeah okay chat
07:34 - yeah okay
07:38 - manipulating events so we have our
07:40 - events so events like are things that
07:42 - happen in our web page things that
07:43 - happen in our code
07:44 - the contents attributes and styles of
07:46 - selected elements can be changed with
07:47 - javascript so like
07:50 - our our like the content of our web page
07:53 - can be changed through javascript and
07:54 - that's the whole point of today's lesson
07:56 - the whole point of today's lesson is
07:57 - manipulating the dom
07:58 - and we can change the contents of the
08:01 - javascript
08:03 - through uh we can change the contents of
08:06 - the web page through javascript
08:08 - and we can call that manipulating events
08:10 - because events can be
08:12 - whatever so that's what we're doing here
08:14 - so in this example
08:17 - document.getelementbyid some random id
08:20 - dot inner html hello there let's go
08:23 - through this
08:24 - document.getelement we already know this
08:28 - we're getting an element by id the id
08:31 - name is something random id so
08:33 - we're looking for something called
08:34 - something random id
08:36 - yes so we're going to go and try and
08:39 - look at all the
08:40 - elements by id and once we say oh we
08:42 - found something random id
08:44 - we're going to take it dot or html so
08:47 - we're going to use
08:47 - our like coded in html and we're going
08:51 - to say hello there
08:53 - let's go through inner dot uh dot inner
08:55 - html so remember
08:56 - um a couple examples ago we had like
08:59 - script
09:00 - in our html page right so we had
09:03 - something that said like
09:05 - um like it was a function that ran i
09:08 - think the most
09:08 - recent example of this is probably last
09:10 - week where we saw like uh javascript
09:12 - code within our html page
09:14 - javascript css and html are all
09:16 - interchangeable they all work together
09:18 - on web page
09:19 - so you could program html
09:22 - within a javascript file when using dot
09:25 - inner html because you're saying oh like
09:28 - right here this is html code
09:31 - so they all work in tandem like that you
09:33 - can use javascript within an html file
09:35 - you can use some html in a css file you
09:37 - can
09:38 - you know mix and match and like that but
09:39 - there's certain syntax you need to use
09:40 - to do that
09:41 - so when you're in a javascript file and
09:43 - you want to change some html
09:45 - you're going to put dot h in our html to
09:48 - signify it's html
09:49 - and then it will change the webpage's
09:51 - html within your javascript file
09:53 - oops sorry so
09:57 - that's what this does get elements by id
10:00 - get some random dot id gets dot inner
10:04 - html
10:05 - then it just says hello there
10:08 - now we're going to go and we're going to
10:10 - look at the next example replaces
10:12 - existing content with the element id
10:13 - attribute as it's assigned so
10:18 - document.getelementbyid some random id
10:20 - we know what this does
10:21 - yes get some random id dot set attribute
10:25 - attribute value so say
10:28 - some random id was like i um a flexbox
10:33 - right so say that our
10:36 - flexbox called some random id
10:39 - had a flexbox is just like a box on your
10:42 - screen that you can
10:43 - change the dimensions of and say
10:46 - we wanted to have the box be 100 pixels
10:49 - by 100 pixels
10:50 - that's how it starts out by doing this
10:52 - we say like set attribute
10:54 - our attribute could be width and the
10:56 - value could be 200 so now all of a
10:58 - sudden our box is 200 by 100.
11:01 - so doing this you can change attributes
11:03 - of html elements within your javascript
11:05 - code
11:08 - manipulating events so
11:12 - changes a specific style property of a
11:15 - selected element
11:16 - um property can be background color
11:18 - margin etc
11:20 - right so we talked about our properties
11:22 - um the styling for that specific
11:23 - property goes into value
11:26 - so remember we had our width and then
11:28 - 200 pixels
11:30 - right so the specific way we want to
11:32 - style it and then the styling element so
11:34 - with
11:34 - 200 pixels
11:38 - um in this way we're going to do
11:39 - document.elementbyid some random id
11:42 - we know what this means dot style css
11:46 - as soon as you see style you should know
11:47 - that that's css
11:49 - dot property so property like what is
11:52 - the property we want to change
11:54 - sticking to our example dot with
11:57 - value 200 pixels yeah
12:01 - how do we feel about that yes no maybe
12:08 - reactions
12:11 - i see nothing in the chat so i'm
12:13 - assuming we're okay okay one thumbs up
12:15 - too
12:15 - okay awesome so methods
12:18 - methods are actions that are performed
12:20 - on objects in javascript so like
12:22 - one specific action that's performed on
12:25 - an object
12:25 - is a method right so like functions can
12:29 - be a series of actions but like
12:31 - one action is a method
12:34 - acting accessing a method so like
12:36 - calling a method
12:37 - remember how we called functions
12:39 - accessing a method or calling a method
12:42 - goes as follows so object name dot
12:45 - method name
12:46 - right so we want to talk about the
12:48 - object we're talking about
12:50 - then the method we want to call so like
12:52 - what method it is
12:53 - and it's very similar as our function
12:55 - syntax remember function
12:57 - so we just have the function name and
12:58 - the brackets well this is just method
12:59 - name and then brackets but we also have
13:01 - the object name
13:02 - there are also several built-in methods
13:04 - so remember how math
13:06 - we have our um like built-in math
13:08 - functions
13:09 - well if you're talking about something
13:11 - like a string like we know it's a string
13:13 - you can use built-in methods like two
13:15 - uppercase which changes all of your
13:17 - words into um
13:20 - which changes all of your words into
13:22 - uppercase so like they're all capital
13:23 - letters
13:24 - so there's built-in methods like that
13:25 - just like there are built-in methods for
13:27 - the math portion as well okay
13:30 - is there any questions this is the end
13:31 - of the lesson so is there anything we
13:32 - want to go back and talk about are we
13:34 - good
13:39 - um excuse me yeah um so maybe
13:43 - um we can go over the important points
13:47 - again
13:49 - the important points what do you mean by
13:51 - that like the important stuff
13:55 - um can you give me like like a question
13:58 - that you had because there's a lot of
14:00 - important things
14:01 - you know so like is there like a
14:04 - specific area you wanted to go over
14:06 - again
14:08 - because there's a lot of important
14:10 - things like we talked about a lot this
14:11 - lesson
14:12 - so i don't want to like go through it
14:13 - all again if
14:15 - we don't need to especially if there's
14:17 - people who get it so there's a specific
14:18 - question you have
14:19 - can you try and narrow it down a little
14:22 - bit and then we can talk privately
14:23 - during the breakout rooms
14:25 - um well if you go back
14:28 - a few slides like two or three i think
14:33 - okay tell me when to stop like right
14:36 - after this
14:36 - wait one right after this this one like
14:39 - forward
14:41 - this one yeah that one okay what's what
14:44 - do we
14:44 - what's the question um i don't really
14:48 - understand it okay
14:52 - so manipulating events is basically just
14:54 - we're talking about like
14:56 - so remember we have our event examples
14:57 - like key clicks
14:59 - or um key clicks or
15:02 - i mean key clicks is a good example so
15:04 - an event is like like
15:06 - events are something that happens within
15:08 - our web page that we can like look for
15:10 - and then when it happens we can do
15:12 - something about it so a good example is
15:14 - like a key click so when we say like oh
15:16 - like the web page has been clicked we
15:17 - can do something like we can like
15:19 - display the date
15:20 - we can say like hello there we can do
15:22 - all these things
15:23 - manipulating events is basically just
15:25 - saying like
15:26 - oh we're going to
15:29 - use javascript to manipulate the event
15:32 - so we're going to say like
15:33 - what happens when the event happens
15:37 - right so like summary and id we have an
15:41 - element here
15:42 - so we have an element it has an id we're
15:45 - using html
15:46 - so that we change it to hello there so
15:48 - we're changing
15:50 - the event right so in this case
15:54 - we're setting attributes so we're
15:56 - changing the code through javascript
15:59 - so we're changing certain events through
16:00 - javascript if that makes sense if you
16:08 - still don't get it we can talk about it
16:09 - later
16:11 - okay so guys let's go into our project
16:14 - for today
16:16 - um i will as always drop the
16:19 - submission link and the link in the chat
16:21 - give me two seconds to do that
16:23 - and yeah we're gonna get through it
16:27 - today i'm gonna go through the replicode
16:29 - as always and then we're gonna get into
16:31 - our challenges for this week
16:33 - in our project yeah this one was a short
16:36 - lesson guys
16:38 - um but you guys are really like
16:42 - getting on your way with coding so
16:44 - that's good
16:46 - okay that's the replit and i'll drop the
16:49 - submission form
17:04 - okay there you go so that's your upload
17:06 - that's your submission form as always
17:08 - we're going to go to the replay and
17:08 - we're going to make sure that we fork it
17:10 - because that's always important to
17:12 - remember
17:16 - yeah so make sure we fork it guys make
17:19 - sure
17:22 - that's what we do we're gonna have to
17:24 - fork it remember
17:26 - and i'll share my screen so we can go
17:29 - through the replica
17:36 - if we have any minecraft fans in the
17:37 - house there are
17:39 - some minecraft references
17:42 - in the replit today so i hope you enjoy
17:45 - those
17:47 - we tried to make the image fun so
17:51 - okay so we're going to look and we're
17:52 - going to notice that our script file
17:54 - first of all is completely empty
17:57 - this is intentional you're going to be
17:59 - using your
18:00 - javascript within your html file to
18:02 - manipulate the dom
18:03 - that's the whole point of today's
18:05 - assignment i want everyone's script file
18:06 - to be completely blank
18:08 - let's go through the code index.html
18:11 - we have our metadata we never concern
18:14 - ourselves with that
18:15 - first of all divider class center
18:19 - id letters what is this element
18:22 - and id we know what that is we have a
18:24 - class
18:25 - called center and we're going to call it
18:26 - id letters right because we're talking
18:28 - about the letters
18:29 - and what this says is we want all of our
18:31 - colors to be centered and we call it
18:33 - class center because we want to
18:35 - manipulate
18:35 - everything in here so we give it a class
18:38 - and we call the id
18:40 - that class so we can manipulate
18:41 - everything in here
18:43 - and we do that within our css file so
18:46 - here we just have h-e-l-l-o exclamation
18:49 - point
18:49 - pretty letters fun colors
