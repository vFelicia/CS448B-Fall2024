00:00 - hi everyone and welcome to our seventh
00:03 - stem session video um from girls code it
00:06 - i'm simone and today we'll be talking
00:07 - about how to start your computer science
00:09 - career
00:10 - in high school and with computer science
00:14 - we're going to talk about first what it
00:16 - is so what is cs i think
00:18 - i gave that away it is computer science
00:21 - but
00:21 - computer science is actually the study
00:23 - of computers and computational systems
00:25 - and that sounds pretty straightforward
00:27 - like computer science
00:29 - study of computers why is it so hard but
00:31 - there's so much layers to cs
00:33 - that that's what makes it one of the
00:35 - most accepting fields and we'll talk a
00:36 - bit more about that later
00:39 - but cs is heavily based on
00:42 - math so computer science
00:45 - if you guys have ever looked at the ap
00:48 - it is
00:49 - under the math category just because it
00:51 - is
00:52 - so heavily reliant on mathematics
00:54 - concepts and
00:55 - mathematics and computer science really
00:57 - coincide with each other on a lot of
00:59 - spots and number three computer science
01:02 - is a field that focuses on theory
01:04 - design and application so you're not
01:06 - necessarily building here
01:08 - computer science more about the software
01:10 - and everything behind
01:12 - the hardware which is what usually you
01:14 - would see you're like
01:15 - oh here's the computer but cs is what's
01:17 - inside that like all the
01:19 - circuits all that fun stuff and
01:23 - even more important it's about the
01:24 - theory the ideas that come
01:26 - the design and everything in computer
01:29 - science is designed
01:30 - separately and then built
01:33 - and so why would you want to care about
01:36 - computer science
01:37 - like why is it that important and i know
01:39 - that this question may seem
01:41 - a little bit stupid but we have to go
01:43 - over some of the important stuff with it
01:45 - so computer science really builds on
01:47 - problem solving
01:48 - and you guys might have heard that but
01:50 - problem solving
01:52 - is an essential part of computer science
01:54 - just like it is in many other fields
01:56 - computer science
01:57 - poses you with a problem it gives you
02:00 - let's say like a coding challenge and
02:01 - you have to solve it there isn't that
02:03 - many resources you can use you can use
02:05 - other people's ideas
02:06 - but at some point you are on your own
02:08 - trying to figure that out
02:10 - and problem solving in general is an
02:11 - essential skill in life
02:13 - and why not practice it with computer
02:15 - science which is such a growing and
02:17 - accepting and amazing
02:19 - industry also computer scientists
02:23 - are behind all like the fancy technology
02:25 - stuff that we use every day especially
02:27 - now
02:28 - during the coronavirus we have so much
02:30 - technology and
02:32 - you don't even realize that that is all
02:35 - based on computer science
02:36 - and that's really like the amazingness
02:39 - of computer science
02:41 - is the amazingness but the awesome thing
02:44 - about computer science is that it can
02:46 - create so many things and it spans just
02:48 - such a large
02:50 - amount of fields and places
02:54 - but in addition computer science can
02:56 - lead to more equality
02:58 - it's such a new field like if you think
03:00 - about it computers weren't even
03:02 - around before the 1980s i believe so
03:05 - it's so new just 40 years
03:08 - about and
03:12 - it's really a chance for us to give
03:15 - the underrepresented people in the
03:17 - workforce more representation because
03:19 - computer science is so
03:20 - important and it's going to be really
03:22 - important in the future
03:24 - and having it be an essential part of
03:26 - our lives gives it a real like
03:28 - we have we're in this together so
03:30 - everyone should be able to work on it
03:32 - and also computer science is one of the
03:33 - largest industries as i've said and will
03:36 - only continue to grow we're basing our
03:37 - whole lives from now on
03:38 - technology and that technology our
03:42 - thirst for more will lead computer
03:45 - science to be one of the most
03:46 - impacting fields later on and
03:50 - computer science makes a positive
03:51 - improvement for society like
03:54 - let's say an alexa and amazon alexa
03:56 - those were
03:57 - built so that they could help people who
04:00 - couldn't
04:01 - um necessarily like use computers or
04:03 - phones
04:04 - the voice recognition allows people to
04:06 - just be able to talk
04:08 - with the device and it'll
04:11 - do things for them instead of having to
04:13 - like type something out in your phone
04:15 - a lot of elderly people especially with
04:18 - like arthritis maybe can't type it in
04:20 - and that really um helps them be able to
04:23 - do all that
04:25 - so moving on from there here on this
04:28 - slide i'm just going to talk about
04:29 - some more importance of computer science
04:31 - computer science
04:32 - the if you didn't have computer science
04:34 - you wouldn't have computers especially
04:36 - now during
04:37 - coven our cover 19 situation we rely so
04:40 - heavily on computers think about if we
04:41 - didn't have computers we wouldn't have
04:43 - school currently we wouldn't have ways
04:45 - to socialize we wouldn't have work
04:47 - everything would just be so much harder
04:49 - the computer science that allows us to
04:51 - have so much technology
04:53 - to allow us to connect and work together
04:55 - won't would not be there
04:59 - and now more importantly how is cs
05:02 - applicable in your life why do you care
05:04 - about everything that has that's
05:05 - happening in the world if it doesn't
05:07 - concern you
05:08 - well that's not necessarily true but
05:11 - let's look into that a bit more with
05:14 - computer science you have so
05:17 - much opportunities like computer science
05:20 - spans a
05:21 - great feel like a great
05:24 - huge amount of smaller fields
05:28 - that you can major in and they're all so
05:30 - interesting
05:31 - and they're all developing and they
05:33 - could use all the help they can get
05:36 - and so these are just listing some of
05:37 - the jobs but if these jobs sound cool to
05:39 - you a
05:40 - computer science degree is the way to go
05:42 - like this is our future
05:45 - and computer science is an amazing
05:47 - growing and accepting field
05:49 - so whether you want to be a data
05:50 - scientist business analyst
05:52 - and even if you want to do artificial
05:54 - intelligence machine learning
05:56 - artificial intelligence there's that's
05:58 - one of the um
06:00 - more interesting ones you see it so
06:01 - often in movies and maybe you want to
06:03 - try out and see what it's all about
06:08 - and also some quick facts just to
06:10 - convince you
06:11 - to go into computer science um computer
06:14 - science graduates
06:15 - get paid some of the highest starting
06:17 - salaries since it's so the field is so
06:19 - new it's so important it deals with
06:20 - things that we need in our everyday
06:22 - lives
06:23 - that we've grown to rely on the
06:24 - computers the technology
06:26 - all of that it's very high paying
06:30 - and also a fun fact is that hp microsoft
06:34 - and apple and i realized apple should be
06:36 - capitalized
06:37 - but those all began in a garage if you
06:40 - look that up it's true
06:42 - they all started with a person having an
06:44 - idea and building on it and now
06:46 - those companies are huge and around the
06:49 - world
06:50 - more than 17 billion devices are
06:52 - connected to the internet
06:54 - that's a huge amount of devices that's
06:56 - imagine
06:57 - that's set if we didn't have computer
06:59 - science those 17
07:00 - billion devices would not exist they
07:02 - want to connect the internet
07:04 - and people would not be able to
07:06 - communicate imagine how much
07:08 - is relying on those 17 billion devices
07:12 - and now for the more important stuff how
07:16 - can you start your career what is this
07:17 - presentation about well now we're going
07:19 - to get into that
07:21 - so a frequent question is where do you
07:23 - start you want to go into cs
07:25 - so where should you begin well you want
07:28 - to use the resources you already have
07:30 - so many schools offer amazing
07:33 - opportunities for you to take classes
07:35 - that base
07:35 - off of cs that are an extension of cs
07:38 - you can enroll in extracurriculars
07:41 - and learn a coding language on your own
07:43 - if those aren't available options
07:45 - so first if you want to look at what
07:47 - classes your school offers
07:49 - many times and i know i've listed aps
07:52 - but
07:53 - it doesn't have to be an ap necessarily
07:55 - if your school doesn't offer an ap
07:56 - that's fine
07:57 - aps are just great because you get to
07:59 - take college level courses
08:00 - and that also gets you ready for the
08:02 - college rigor of cs courses
08:04 - by ap computer science of course and
08:07 - since a lot of people when ap computer
08:08 - science
08:09 - came out they didn't take it they ap
08:13 - actually made a separate one principles
08:15 - and principles
08:17 - is a simpler one but it still goes
08:20 - very in-depth and it's also an amazing
08:22 - course to take ap calculus as i said
08:25 - computer science bases off very heavily
08:28 - on math so math could help you so could
08:29 - ap statistics if you want to go into
08:31 - data analysis
08:33 - that's also a portion of cs or ap
08:35 - physics and chemistry some science
08:37 - concepts are really
08:38 - useful if you want to deal with 3d
08:40 - design 3d animations all that fun stuff
08:42 - and i know this one is um really frowned
08:46 - upon like why would you want to learn a
08:47 - foreign language
08:48 - well since cs is such a growing field it
08:50 - spans technology is what connects the
08:52 - world together
08:53 - and learning a foreign language maybe
08:56 - you could go somewhere else to work with
08:58 - if when going into computer science
08:59 - you'll meet so many people from
09:01 - different backgrounds
09:02 - that learning a foreign language could
09:03 - really help you
09:05 - to be able to communicate better and
09:07 - work on those problems more efficiently
09:10 - and our second option our second
09:13 - piece of advice i'd say is to enroll in
09:15 - some extracurriculars
09:16 - extracurriculars are a great way to
09:19 - extend your knowledge
09:21 - and really go beyond and some of these
09:24 - and i've only listed
09:24 - four but there's so many that your
09:26 - school this is
09:28 - personally the ones that i could think
09:29 - of that my school offers
09:31 - and it's math team because computer
09:33 - science based off on math
09:34 - first robotics is a great opportunity
09:36 - and so is vex
09:38 - they are both they allow you to see the
09:40 - aspect of cs
09:41 - of you create the programs you create
09:43 - the software now what do you do with it
09:46 - you put it in roblox that you build
09:48 - it allows you to see the impact what you
09:49 - could really do with programming
09:51 - computer science
09:52 - and last we have cyber patriots which is
09:55 - a program given out by
09:57 - the air force and cyber patriots is
10:00 - great because
10:02 - it allows you to compete and challenges
10:04 - to secure systems
10:06 - and cyber security is very important in
10:08 - computer science
10:09 - and if you don't have if perhaps you go
10:12 - to like an
10:13 - online school and you might not have
10:15 - these resources you might not be able to
10:17 - take the aps you might not have
10:18 - extracurriculars to enroll in
10:20 - you can always learn a coding language
10:22 - on your own there are so many websites
10:23 - that offer free tutorials
10:25 - you have our website girlscoded.org of
10:28 - course
10:28 - by the way make sure to sign up for web
10:30 - dev signups and our web dev courses
10:33 - and those are going to teach you some
10:34 - html css
10:36 - css and javascript but you have so many
10:39 - different ones and of course
10:41 - youtube is always a great one you can do
10:44 - so much
10:45 - if eve if you just want to be in the cs
10:48 - field
10:49 - even if you don't have necessarily the
10:51 - resources someone
10:52 - else might have and another step is to
10:56 - work on projects and to showcase your
10:58 - work
10:58 - projects are really important because
11:00 - they allow you to experience
11:02 - instead of just watching tutorials um
11:05 - reading books you get to experience the
11:08 - computer science part of it you get to
11:10 - experience as if you're working on a
11:12 - project you really get to make mistakes
11:15 - and mistakes are will give you
11:17 - that um that ability to continue
11:21 - mistakes or will show you what you're
11:22 - doing wrong what you're missing and what
11:23 - you can improve on
11:25 - and in the end when you're able to solve
11:27 - all those problems
11:28 - it gives you a huge sense of
11:30 - accomplishment to see your final project
11:32 - and it's working and it's great
11:33 - and you can share it with people is just
11:37 - an amazing feeling
11:39 - of accomplishment and confidence and
11:42 - a good way to show others your project
11:44 - is to post them online
11:48 - you can or you can post them on your
11:52 - social media perhaps
11:53 - just to show people and github is really
11:56 - useful for this github is all about
11:58 - people posting their projects being able
12:00 - to reference them later
12:01 - in the future to show them like hey look
12:03 - at my cool project idea oh that's cool
12:05 - but i think you could go further on that
12:07 - you know and people can really comment
12:09 - on each other's
12:10 - project to further the progress on those
12:14 - and
12:14 - girls code it has a github stem session
12:18 - so i could link that for you guys in the
12:19 - description
12:23 - and our third piece of advice is to find
12:25 - some internships in summer
12:27 - programs internships allow you to learn
12:30 - from professionals and to really
12:31 - experience
12:32 - computer science for what it is a a job
12:35 - you know like it allows you to
12:36 - experience the job
12:38 - working on problems that you would
12:41 - get paid for that are important like you
12:44 - could always make your own projects but
12:45 - this gives you the
12:47 - um a bit of pressure like this is
12:49 - something you have to create and the
12:51 - accomplishment here is huge you got to
12:53 - learn from professionals you got to
12:55 - experience the whole idea of working
12:58 - cs as a job which is the cs career
13:02 - and they're also really useful because
13:03 - they build experience of course you're
13:05 - working from professionals
13:06 - you're looking at the best people the
13:08 - people who've already learned
13:09 - and can only give you more from that um
13:12 - and of course you can always go to
13:14 - hackathons hackathons
13:16 - allow you to showcase your knowledge and
13:18 - to stand out by being
13:20 - a competition they allow you to
13:24 - they allow you to not only learn because
13:27 - then
13:28 - you can meet other people learn from
13:30 - that but they allow you to show off your
13:32 - knowledge
13:32 - and to see what computer science is
13:35 - really about
13:36 - like to see a challenge and here i've
13:39 - linked one website and also link to the
13:40 - description some to consider like
13:42 - internships compute and computer science
13:44 - programs
13:45 - and it says specifically for girls but a
13:47 - lot of them can also be applied to guys
13:49 - as well
13:50 - so don't worry about that
13:53 - and our last section is how can you
13:56 - make a difference there are so many
13:59 - people wanting to go into cs
14:00 - how are you going to make the difference
14:03 - and to be truthful you everyone makes a
14:07 - difference in cs
14:08 - it's a growing field there's so much
14:10 - more that we have to learn from it
14:12 - there's so much more we can do with it
14:14 - that just the
14:16 - idea i'm going to go into computer
14:18 - science and i'm going to try my best
14:20 - you will accomplish so much and the
14:23 - other thing
14:24 - is that computer science is a field that
14:26 - can really
14:27 - um showcase and build equality
14:31 - and um usually
14:34 - stem is considered for guys and we know
14:37 - that stereotype but that's what
14:39 - we and girls code it and a lot of people
14:41 - are trying to break that girls also have
14:44 - the capabilities just like guys to go
14:46 - into stem fields
14:48 - especially computer science and a lot of
14:51 - times
14:52 - that's the important thing to have the
14:54 - idea i'm going to
14:55 - make it like i'm going to go into it i'm
14:57 - going to make it like
14:59 - i can do this and that confidence that
15:01 - even though
15:02 - you're a girl you can do it like you can
15:05 - go into computer science make a
15:07 - difference because it's just so much
15:08 - computer science needs all the help it
15:10 - can get
15:10 - to growing accepting field and there's
15:12 - so much more that we have to learn from
15:14 - it
15:15 - and here we just have a chart and these
15:18 - points i went over
15:22 - a second ago but we also have the fact
15:25 - that minorities
15:26 - are very underrepresented too in
15:29 - computer science
15:30 - and as you can see here we have
15:33 - the interesting thing is that when
15:36 - you're comparing male and female
15:38 - you have to 51 so almost half and half
15:41 - and this is a 2010 to 11 study so
15:44 - i guess not that recent but we can still
15:47 - gauge from here
15:48 - the enrollment is pretty good but the
15:51 - amount
15:51 - of females who take the test the ap
15:54 - computer science exam
15:55 - are way less than the amount of guys who
15:57 - take it
15:58 - and that's the important thing to tell
16:00 - yourself even though i'm a girl
16:01 - i still have the capabilities to do this
16:05 - and cs is just such an amazing field it
16:08 - promotes equality
16:09 - it everyone can do it if you set
16:12 - yourself to it
16:13 - you can solve these problems problem
16:15 - solving and
16:17 - math and coding is not based on gender
16:20 - or your race ethnicity
16:24 - everyone can do it and that's what is so
16:26 - important about cs because it binds
16:28 - people together and it really promotes
16:29 - equality
16:30 - and that's some points that i want to
16:32 - touch on is that when you go to those
16:34 - summer internships we talked about
16:37 - they can really lead you to meeting more
16:39 - people you meet
16:40 - people of different backgrounds and you
16:43 - get to ask them questions you got to
16:44 - exchange
16:45 - all that amazing knowledge that you both
16:47 - accum or all of you have accumulated
16:50 - and that's really the important part is
16:52 - that a cue like
16:53 - that's the knowledge that's the learning
16:55 - you learn from other people
16:56 - even though they're different from you
16:58 - and that's really how cs is so
17:00 - important in creating equality
17:04 - and also it's just um
17:08 - you really want to tell yourself i got
17:12 - this
17:12 - i can do it you have to have the
17:13 - confidence that you can go into this
17:15 - field because
17:16 - it's not that bad i know a lot of people
17:19 - are scared about
17:20 - of computer science because they're like
17:21 - oh my god computers
17:23 - that's such a big thing technology math
17:25 - i'm terrible at those
17:27 - but no computer science has so much um
17:30 - differ so many different things you can
17:34 - do
17:34 - computer sciences just spans and i know
17:37 - it might sound computer science
17:38 - science of computers what else could
17:40 - there be but it spans so many different
17:43 - areas that you can specialize in and
17:46 - there's something for everyone really
17:47 - and that's what's important about
17:48 - computer science is that
17:50 - it's so accepting and
17:53 - i that was our last slide and thank you
17:56 - so much for watching guys we really
17:58 - appreciate you guys being here with us
18:00 - that concludes our stem session 7 on
18:04 - how to start your cs career in high
18:06 - school and i just wanted to touch
18:08 - upon a little bit it doesn't have to be
18:10 - in high school it can be in elementary
