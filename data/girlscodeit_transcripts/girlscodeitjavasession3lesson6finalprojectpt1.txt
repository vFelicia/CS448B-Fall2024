00:00 - and run it
00:03 - so basically what this project option is
00:06 - is
00:06 - um it's like a shop so you can as you
00:09 - can see from these
00:10 - options here you can view the items add
00:13 - items remove items or check if an item
00:15 - is
00:16 - in the shop so first of all um nothing
00:19 - is in it
00:19 - yet so we are going to add an item so
00:22 - let's just say like
00:25 - apple continue yes we want to continue
00:29 - um let's now
00:32 - view the items and as you can see we
00:35 - added apples and now there is apple
00:39 - um let's remove items
00:42 - to enter the index so the index is going
00:44 - to be zero so
00:48 - and then view items so we can see
00:50 - there's nothing
00:52 - nothing in our shop now um and so that's
00:55 - pretty much it
00:56 - and then check if an item is in the shop
00:59 - you basically just
01:01 - um write what you're looking for and
01:03 - it'll let you know if it's
01:04 - present or not so that's pretty much it
01:08 - in this project um i think it uses
01:12 - everything i talked about so it has
01:14 - um the items are stored in an arraylist
01:18 - if you guys remember that we talked
01:20 - about that a couple times ago
01:22 - um and since we have options whenever we
01:24 - have options we're going to be using our
01:26 - if statements
01:27 - so um yeah this project uses everything
01:31 - so this is one of the
01:34 - options
01:37 - okay untranslated
01:51 - so for the um
01:55 - for the other option we have a game
01:59 - it's like a make your own adventure game
02:04 - so click on it that's not
02:08 - compile
02:11 - just to show you the results it starts
02:14 - off with
02:14 - this hello traveler and asks you
02:18 - for your character name
02:22 - so i can enter anything like
02:26 - okay and this says
02:30 - welcome andrea here are your stats
02:33 - there's your health and your damage and
02:35 - your
02:35 - inventory and right now our inventory
02:39 - doesn't have anything
02:41 - so yeah and then we can go on an
02:44 - adventure and you press
02:45 - enter and you
02:48 - walk and then you stumble upon this rock
02:52 - so you can either choose to one pick it
02:54 - up i mean ignore it or to pick it up
02:57 - so let's say i want to ignore the rock
03:03 - and it says i tripped over a rock so i
03:05 - lost some help
03:07 - so sad anyways and then we continue
03:10 - walking
03:11 - and then we find this stick
03:14 - and i pick it up so there's plus one
03:17 - stick
03:18 - in my inventory and
03:21 - then i see this old man that
03:25 - asks if i can if he can have that stick
03:29 - and i can either say yes or no
03:35 - and you're doing just one project
03:39 - and you can choose so let's just say
03:43 - yeah i'll give it to him and you give
03:47 - the
03:47 - man a stick and you continue along the
03:50 - journey
03:51 - and then oh you give him a stick and he
03:54 - gives you
03:55 - a sword and this sword does 50 damage
03:58 - so then continue on your adventure and
04:01 - then you see this blue devil oh no
04:04 - what are you gonna do you're gonna look
04:07 - into your inventory because you decided
04:11 - that you're gonna fight with it
04:13 - so one i look into my inventory
04:16 - and i find my stick and my silver sword
04:22 - and so um i decide to fight this monster
04:27 - you fight the monster and you lose
04:29 - health
04:30 - most of the enemies loses health and
04:32 - then you win
04:34 - so that's just my example of an
04:37 - adventure game
04:38 - and you can make it as simple or as
04:41 - complex
04:42 - as you want but like both of these
04:46 - objects project examples
04:49 - we cover if statements making variables
04:53 - doing loops and also making arrays
04:56 - and arraylists so it's just a way to
04:59 - practice
05:00 - what you learn and yeah
05:03 - and both options are great
05:12 - yeah so basically um you'll be choosing
05:15 - one of those projects
05:17 - um and like andrea said for her
05:20 - adventure one you could
05:21 - you don't have to do the adventure that
05:23 - she did you can make your own thing
05:25 - um so basically you're gonna choose one
05:28 - of the two options and then you'll be
05:29 - working on that
05:31 - for the next three meetings including
05:34 - this one
05:35 - so this one and then the next two so
05:37 - just take a moment and just think about
05:39 - which one you want to do
05:40 - and then either type it in the chat or
05:43 - just take your mic
05:44 - off and let us know
05:49 - so if you want the shop one which was
05:50 - the one that i showed you just like
05:52 - type shop or something if you want
05:54 - andrea's and then just type
06:04 - adventure
07:24 - um okay
07:28 - so i guess the first thing
07:32 - when we're doing the adventure game is
07:35 - to think about what
07:39 - story i guess or what adventure you want
07:42 - so like andreas was your traveler
07:44 - you go you have the option to pick up a
07:46 - rock um
07:47 - or stick i don't quite remember what it
07:51 - was
07:52 - um but basically just adventure where
07:55 - you have to make decisions so the first
07:57 - step
07:57 - in um creating your own adventure code
08:01 - is going to be to come up with that
08:03 - basic guideline
08:04 - of what you want to do um main like
08:07 - basic storyline i guess um
08:10 - the important thing is just to
08:14 - be sure to have decisions to be made so
08:16 - maybe it could be
08:17 - you're walking on a trail do you turn
08:19 - left or right or it could be i mean
08:20 - that's a pretty boring example but
08:22 - um so feel free to spruce it up a little
08:25 - bit and get
08:26 - more creative um it's just important to
08:29 - make sure that we have decisions and for
08:31 - every decision that we make
08:32 - um something's gonna happen so if we
08:35 - turn right something's gonna happen
08:36 - if you turn left something different is
08:38 - gonna happen um
08:40 - so if you
08:43 - want to take maybe i don't know what do
08:47 - you guys think like 10 minutes
08:49 - do you think that's good yeah
08:52 - like 10 to 15 minutes to just brainstorm
08:56 - and yeah yeah and it doesn't have to be
09:00 - a super long complicated story just
09:02 - something simple with a couple of
09:04 - decisions
09:05 - i will start with like one or two
09:06 - decisions and then of course if
09:08 - um you feel comfortable we can totally
09:11 - find ways
09:12 - to make it more interesting and add more
09:14 - things to it but just to start
09:16 - just come up with like one or two
09:17 - decisions um
09:20 - and the basic storyline i guess
09:23 - of your game so if you guys have any
09:25 - questions meanwhile
09:26 - uh please feel free to just to ask us
09:29 - we'll be here
09:30 - um if not then we'll give you guys some
09:33 - time
09:34 - to get started
09:58 - to like code anything today we're just
10:00 - going to come up with
10:02 - some ideas and maybe share them and you
10:05 - guys can develop your story
10:07 - more until the next time we meet as well
10:10 - can even change your story
10:18 - it would be great because we only have
10:20 - 10 minutes left
10:21 - for class so it'd be great if you guys
10:24 - can share
10:25 - something it doesn't have to be your
10:27 - entire story just
10:29 - like one decision be great
10:47 - all right then caitlyn do you want to
10:48 - make me share one of yours
10:55 - yeah so like um if you
11:00 - if you feed this squirrel it takes you
11:02 - to a magical portal
11:03 - and if you don't then you just see a
11:06 - normal portal and if you go to the
11:07 - magical portal you meet a unicorn
11:10 - and then i don't know what happens next
11:14 - and if you go to the normal portal then
11:16 - you see
11:17 - the mysterious man who gives you a sword
11:20 - if you give him the stick
11:23 - yeah that's perfect that's great um
11:27 - michelle
11:28 - do you want to share why don't you uh
11:30 - michelle why don't you share
11:32 - one of your decisions
11:38 - okay so she said in my story you're
11:41 - royal and you have to make decisions to
11:42 - help your kingdom
11:44 - um example help a peasant find out they
11:46 - are a
11:47 - princess in disguise
11:51 - what just happened yeah michelle that
11:54 - sounds really really interesting that
11:55 - sounds great
11:56 - um so both of you guys uh those
11:58 - storylines sound really really good
12:00 - um and like andreas said we'll be
12:04 - starting to actually code on
12:08 - the next i think that's tomorrow
12:11 - um so tomorrow will help you guys start
12:14 - to code but it's great that you have
12:16 - your basic ideas
12:19 - um and feel free to continue that after
12:24 - this if you would like to
12:27 - i guess we're ending a little bit early
