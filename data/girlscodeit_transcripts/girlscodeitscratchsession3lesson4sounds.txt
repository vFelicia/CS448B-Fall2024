00:02 - hello
00:11 - so today we're talking about sound
00:15 - um that you can add to your game it's
00:18 - like
00:20 - mostly aesthetic reasons but i think it
00:23 - brings a lot of depth
00:24 - into your game and um i think it would
00:27 - be a good idea to
00:28 - have that in your game as well it also
00:31 - ties into
00:32 - a lot of what we're talking about
00:34 - yesterday and the class before
00:36 - about sensing and like the if loop
00:39 - so yeah here we go
00:44 - going to share my screen
00:52 - okay so let's look inside
00:56 - the code that we were working on
01:10 - yesterday
01:12 - okay so as you can see on the left here
01:15 - we have code costumes and sound
01:18 - um what we're going to be looking at
01:19 - today will be the sounds
01:22 - and uh it's basically the same thing as
01:25 - sprite or backdrop you can go over here
01:27 - look for sounds in the database
01:29 - record your own sounds choose a random
01:32 - sound or upload a sound that you already
01:34 - have on your computer
01:35 - so the sound that they give us as a
01:37 - default is the meow sound
01:39 - because um the default sprite they give
01:41 - us is a cat
01:42 - um you can hit the play button to
01:45 - hear what it sounds like
01:48 - and you can also alter the sounds here
01:51 - um
01:52 - with things like making it faster slower
01:55 - louder more quiet you can mute the sound
01:59 - um and then fade in fade out you can
02:02 - make the sound go backwards or you can
02:04 - make it
02:06 - robotic
02:08 - so um yeah
02:11 - you can just alter the sound like that
02:13 - and it'll be inside
02:14 - your database or your scratch codes
02:18 - um you can also go here choose sounds
02:20 - and like choose music to put in the back
02:22 - of your game
02:23 - so if you go over here to loops
02:26 - basically these um
02:30 - these oh my gosh um
02:37 - that's not
02:48 - okay
02:54 - okay um you take these like
02:58 - loops and then when you loop them
03:00 - throughout your code you'll have
03:02 - background music for your code
03:04 - so if you go over here like hover over
03:07 - it or like press the play button
03:12 - it just plays like music and then you
03:14 - can loop it so then that'll always play
03:16 - during your game
03:17 - and i'll show you guys how to do that
03:19 - right now um
03:21 - so here you have your cat you can make
03:24 - it play a sound whenever you you know
03:27 - touch something
03:28 - or anything um
03:32 - let's say our cat makes a sound every
03:36 - time it touches the sun
03:38 - so we already have code down here for
03:39 - what happens when it touches the sun
03:42 - um we switch the costume to a red cat
03:45 - and then we also stop everything but
03:47 - before that we can also make it play a
03:49 - sound
03:50 - so let's go to sounds here
03:54 - and then we can play sound this
03:57 - until done and let's make it
04:00 - now okay so now when we're starting the
04:04 - code
04:05 - or walking towards the sun and then
04:08 - the sound plays when we touch it and
04:11 - then it also turns red because that's
04:12 - what it says in a code
04:14 - and then our code also stops so that's
04:17 - how you put
04:18 - sound in um the difference between the
04:20 - play sound until dawn
04:22 - and the star sound is that playing sound
04:25 - until done
04:26 - means that however long your sound is
04:29 - over here
04:30 - it'll play until completion and
04:34 - it won't stop in the middle if you do
04:36 - start sound
04:37 - um it'll start sometimes it'll
04:40 - complete all the way to the end and
04:42 - sometimes it won't it really depends on
04:43 - your code
04:44 - if you say if my cat is touching the sun
04:48 - start the sound and you are constantly
04:51 - touching the sun
04:53 - then the sound will always replay from
04:55 - the beginning because it always sees you
04:57 - touching the sun
04:58 - um as the first time you touch the sun
05:01 - so then
05:02 - the sound will always start from the
05:03 - beginning does that make sense
05:07 - um does anyone have any questions or
05:09 - like thumbs up if you understand
05:13 - anything
05:16 - don't understand thumbs up
05:20 - if you don't understand maybe do a
05:23 - thumbs down
05:24 - okay seems like everyone understands
05:27 - so yeah and then i'll
05:30 - show you guys how to make a music loop
05:33 - in your
05:34 - game this might be a little loud but you
05:36 - can also adjust
05:38 - the sound if you go over here i'm going
05:40 - to use the bossa nova music
05:42 - but it's kind of loud so i'll just make
05:45 - it softer
05:52 - sorry hold on
06:10 - okay sorry about that um
06:14 - back to the music here we made it a
06:17 - little softer
06:19 - and then we can go into the code and for
06:22 - events we'll make a separate one that
06:24 - says
06:24 - when green flag is clicked over here
06:28 - and then our forever loop because we
06:30 - want
06:31 - um our music to loop as long as we're
06:33 - running the game
06:35 - and then for sounds we want to play
06:37 - until it's done or else it'll sound
06:39 - really weird and glitchy
06:41 - so from the beginning now we have the
06:43 - bossa nova music in the background
06:51 - and then we have the same sound where we
06:53 - touch the sun
06:55 - and then everything stops so
06:59 - that's basically it on sounds remember
07:02 - different ways you can get sound
07:03 - is to look in the database and you can
07:05 - search something up
07:06 - uh you can record your own sound if you
07:08 - don't have anything in the database that
07:11 - you would like to use
07:12 - or you can get a random sound or upload
07:14 - your own sound
07:16 - so is there any more
07:20 - questions about sound
07:25 - okay well i'll just also talk about this
07:28 - you can
07:28 - affect the sound inside the code instead
07:31 - of doing it outside of the code
07:33 - um like if something happens that makes
07:35 - your sound
07:36 - go up a pitch in your game you can do
07:38 - change the pitch effect by
07:40 - and then a number so the positive number
07:43 - will
07:44 - change the pitch to go higher so it'll
07:46 - be a higher pitch
07:47 - it'll be more squeaky a negative number
07:50 - will make it lower
07:51 - and like you know lower
07:54 - so you can also set the pitch um
07:58 - i think 100 is the normal and then a
08:00 - pitch higher than that would be
08:03 - like over 100 and then picture lower
08:06 - would be
08:07 - lower than 100 um same thing with volume
08:11 - if you use a positive number the volume
08:13 - will increase
08:14 - and get louder use a negative volume
08:16 - it'll become quieter
08:18 - and then set volume percentage is the
08:20 - same 100 is the normal percent
08:23 - um but if you want to set it like two
08:25 - times you do like 200
08:27 - or like 50 for half the volume
08:30 - and yeah you can also show your volume
08:34 - on the side here
08:35 - that's the volume it is that right now
08:38 - the normal volume okay
08:40 - so does anyone have any more questions
08:43 - on sound
08:50 - um thumbs up if you have no questions
08:52 - just so i know
08:57 - or yeah thumbs up you have no questions
09:00 - if you understand everything
09:03 - okay awesome so then it's
09:06 - 4 10 right now um i'll give you guys 15
09:09 - minutes to work a little bit on sound
09:12 - and then after i'll um
09:15 - maybe ask a few of you guys to share and
09:17 - i'll also talk about
09:18 - like some more things that we might use
09:21 - in the future like
09:22 - our events section okay so i'll stop
09:25 - trying
09:31 - okay so 15 minutes
09:35 - uh we'll come back at 4 25.
12:58 - hello for those of you who just um
13:01 - entered we are using
13:04 - 15 minutes to work on just sound effects
13:07 - that we are going to add to our project
13:09 - and we'll come back at 4 25. if you have
13:12 - any questions
13:14 - please message it in the chat and then
13:16 - i'll go over it
24:40 - okay so we have um we should come back
24:44 - now from working
24:48 - um someone asked where's the disappear
24:51 - block
24:52 - um is this for making the sprite
24:54 - disappear
24:55 - because um the sprite disappear would be
24:59 - in the looks block
25:07 - would be in the looks block um
25:15 - here and it says hide
25:19 - and that's how you make your sprite like
25:21 - disappear it just makes your
25:23 - right hide itself
25:38 - okay so the next thing we'll be talking
25:41 - about
25:42 - is the events um we briefly covered this
25:45 - in the beginning but basically they're
25:47 - just
25:48 - um conditions so when
25:51 - something happens and then below it
25:54 - something else
25:55 - will happen so when green flag is
25:57 - clicked our code will start running and
25:59 - this condition has to be met before
26:01 - anything at the bottom
26:02 - um happens at all so you can make
26:06 - when the space key is pressed i don't
26:09 - know make the character change colors
26:11 - and then you can do this
26:12 - throughout the game um you want you
26:15 - don't even need to
26:16 - use these at all unless they are
26:18 - activating your game
26:19 - so um if you have green flag
26:23 - over the code that basically runs your
26:26 - game you
26:27 - have to press it but if space the space
26:30 - key
26:30 - is only something like changing colors
26:32 - then and it's not important for your
26:34 - game
26:35 - you actually don't even need to press it
26:36 - the entire time that you're
26:38 - playing your game so these are um
26:41 - pretty useful for things that you might
26:44 - not want clogging up your
26:46 - regular um area here you can always make
26:50 - duplicates of these and then they'll
26:52 - both happen at the same time because
26:53 - they both have the same condition
26:56 - uh yeah and this will help you organize
26:58 - and
26:59 - also help you do things like changing
27:03 - whatever when something happens
27:07 - okay so we also have this
27:10 - if else if and then a condition
27:14 - then else this happens um
27:17 - this is different from the if statement
27:20 - because
27:20 - it says if this condition happens
27:23 - then um they would do this but if the
27:26 - condition is not met
27:28 - something completely different would
27:29 - happen so
27:31 - if we're talking about points and you
27:33 - wanted your character to get points
27:35 - every time you touch
27:36 - something but you wanted your character
27:38 - to lose points whenever they're not
27:40 - touching
27:41 - that thing you would do if sprite is
27:44 - touching
27:45 - that thing then points would go up
27:48 - else points would constantly be going
27:50 - down when the character is not touching
27:52 - that object
27:54 - um this is
27:58 - um a loop repeat until condition is met
28:02 - in java this would be a while loop
28:06 - while something is happening um keep
28:08 - repeating something
28:10 - um and then while that thing is not
28:12 - happening then the loop will end so
28:14 - it's kind of like a while loop but it's
28:16 - also different because this is
28:18 - waiting for a condition to be met and
28:20 - then the while loop is waiting for a
28:22 - condition to not be met
28:25 - so there are those
28:30 - um we also have our sensing here
28:33 - and all that stuff and we'll talk about
28:37 - a lot of these operators in the future
28:39 - as well as the variables
28:41 - um but yeah now that we've gone over
28:45 - that
28:46 - do you guys have a project that you want
28:48 - to share
28:50 - so um
28:53 - elizabeth and then sammy
28:57 - okay so elizabeth do you want to share
29:00 - okay um
29:04 - yeah you should have permission now
29:09 - thank you i have to get um
29:14 - it's not very impressive but it took a
29:16 - long time
29:17 - yeah no worries if you have any
29:19 - questions i can always help you with
29:21 - those
29:24 - okay
29:27 - i don't know if you can hear the music
29:29 - oh yeah we can hear
29:47 - oh and i see you added points there as
29:49 - well
29:51 - it's not really working really well
29:52 - today but
29:54 - it's fine if you do you have any
29:56 - questions on
29:57 - um some things in the game
30:00 - or like how to code something
30:04 - okay well then um sammy do you want to
30:07 - share next
30:08 - or
30:16 - oh is this your next episode in your
30:18 - game
30:19 - um this is the third one actually the
30:22 - third episode
30:24 - yeah it's pretty cool
30:34 - nice
30:51 - hmm
30:55 - what is the ice dragon there
30:59 - every so when i when the magic spell
31:02 - sound
31:02 - plays the i dragon says no and then it
31:06 - just disappears
31:08 - was the ice dragon there in the
31:10 - beginning
31:12 - um yeah it was
31:15 - i'll i'll show if you want me to if you
31:18 - want to see it again i can show you
31:20 - yeah can you share the screen again yeah
31:29 - oh okay so
31:33 - i need to do something yeah okay
31:45 - yes
32:08 - yay
32:11 - good episode i like that one
32:15 - yeah i made another episode two where
32:19 - um gigan pico meets
32:22 - these other three characters
32:27 - are you planning to make like a whole
32:28 - series with them
32:30 - yeah awesome yeah a lot of people who
32:34 - use
32:34 - scratch like to code um things like
32:37 - drawings or stories and yeah
32:40 - it just shows that scratch isn't only
32:42 - for coding games
32:44 - yeah is there anyone else who
32:47 - wants to share what they've done
32:56 - okay well um
32:59 - it's a little early to end class so i'll
33:02 - probably just talk a little bit about
33:04 - operators
33:05 - um and then we'll use that for
33:09 - next class so operators are
33:14 - you know things like addition
33:16 - subtraction
33:18 - multiplication and division and anything
33:20 - in the shape of an
33:21 - oval is supposed to be an integer or
33:24 - like a number
33:25 - so as you can see here um in this oval
33:29 - they have a number and uh
33:33 - these things are shaped as an oval you
33:34 - can actually put them in
33:36 - the spaces that have ovals in them so
33:38 - you can put it over there
33:39 - and uh that changes a lot of things
33:42 - because you can now
33:43 - like change the things while your code
33:46 - is running
33:47 - by using variables and there are things
33:50 - like pick random
33:51 - which basically picks a random number
33:53 - from one to ten
33:54 - and you can use this to play like to
33:56 - make games like
33:58 - um where you have to enter a number and
34:00 - then
34:01 - a computer enters a number and it could
34:03 - be like if you get the higher number
34:05 - then that was
34:07 - then the one generated by the computer
34:09 - you could win
34:10 - and then you can also change that into
34:11 - something like rock paper scissors
34:13 - where certain numbers mean rough and
34:15 - certain numbers mean paper
34:17 - and then stretching numbers mean scissor
34:19 - and then um
34:20 - play rock paper scissors against the
34:22 - computer which is always
34:24 - really fun to code um
34:27 - the one that are hexagons are boolean so
34:29 - they're true and false
34:31 - if this variable here is greater than 50
34:34 - then the boolean there the boolean value
34:37 - will be true
34:39 - and then when the condition is true as
34:42 - we know
34:42 - usually things below will start to run
34:47 - okay so we talked about those
34:52 - integers booleans and then now we have
34:54 - string which is basically just words
34:56 - um if you join apple and banana you're
35:00 - basically combining the word and you'll
35:01 - get apple banana
35:03 - and then letter one of apple you see it
35:06 - is a
35:07 - oval which means that it is a
35:12 - not okay so it's a variable
35:15 - not um a number
35:19 - um for these cases there are numbers um
35:22 - the ovals actually i made a mistake
35:24 - before when i said it was integers
35:26 - they're actually variables and variables
35:27 - can be both integers
35:29 - and string yeah sami do you have a
35:31 - question
35:33 - operators are mostly math right
35:37 - yeah mostly mostly math for the integers
35:40 - but um in this case they're kind of
35:43 - logic based
35:44 - as well because um the strength here is
35:47 - uh the words here
35:49 - are less math and more like just dealing
35:52 - with words so like joining apple and
35:54 - banana
35:55 - you would get apple banana letter one of
35:57 - apple
35:58 - will return a the length of apple will
36:01 - count the amount of letters in
36:03 - the apple and then return that as a
36:05 - number value which would be five
36:08 - this i don't know word length of apple
36:11 - would be like how long how big a app
36:15 - like the object apple is
36:19 - yeah that um the thing is
36:22 - because the our code has to be really
36:25 - specific
36:26 - when it says length and then a word
36:29 - usually they
36:30 - have to find the length of the word
36:32 - itself because you can type something in
36:33 - here
36:34 - that's not even real like like just run
36:37 - random letters
36:39 - and then if it was calculating the
36:42 - you know the length of that in real life
36:44 - it wouldn't know how to because it
36:46 - doesn't
36:46 - um the thing doesn't exist so when it
36:48 - says length of
36:50 - and then a word what it's talking about
36:52 - is the length of the word itself and not
36:54 - the
36:55 - word the object that the word is
36:58 - referencing
37:01 - so yeah whenever um
37:04 - it says length of something a lot of the
37:08 - time
37:08 - it's counting the amount of objects in
37:11 - the thing so
37:12 - in this case the letters
37:17 - um absolute value
37:21 - i don't know if you learned that in your
37:22 - math class i'm sure you guys did though
37:25 - is um the distance between the numbered
37:28 - given
37:28 - and zero so negative four the distance
37:31 - between negative four and zero would
37:33 - still be four
37:34 - absolute value is basically just a
37:35 - positive value for every number
37:38 - um so if you give 2 the absolute value
37:40 - is 2. negative 2
37:41 - they'll still be 2. that's just what
37:43 - absolute value
37:44 - means um
37:50 - yeah and then we have variables which
37:53 - we'll talk about
37:54 - in our next class so our next class will
37:56 - probably be a little bit longer than
37:58 - this one
38:00 - because can help like score
38:03 - point yeah you can make um let's make
38:06 - the variable right now actually and then
38:08 - i'll talk more about it
38:09 - next class points
38:13 - and then it'll show over there basically
38:15 - it shows you how much points
38:17 - how many points you're getting and
38:20 - you can change it so that it'll give you
38:23 - points whenever you do something
38:27 - and then you use these to you know
38:29 - change your variable
38:31 - set variable to a number change by
38:34 - number and then show up here or hide
38:38 - hide it up there um
38:44 - yeah for variables you can also
38:47 - make it so that they keep track of
38:49 - different things like
38:52 - location so let's say you're walking and
38:56 - you want to walk 10 spaces
38:58 - from wherever you are and then you want
39:00 - something to happen you can make it so
39:02 - that
39:02 - the points go up by 10 while you're
39:04 - walking
39:06 - and then when you reach a certain area
39:09 - it senses that the points um are over
39:13 - a certain number and then something
39:15 - could happen there
