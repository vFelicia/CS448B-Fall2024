00:02 - i just like to thank all of you for
00:03 - showing up today this
00:04 - is our official first official stem
00:07 - session
00:08 - and it'll be going over how to start a
00:10 - club and we're thinking about having
00:12 - these
00:12 - every two weeks or so and at the end of
00:15 - each
00:15 - course i hope you guys are all taking
00:18 - the python courses we're offering right
00:19 - now
00:20 - and at the end of each course we will
00:22 - have a guest speaker come in and talk
00:24 - about their achievements
00:26 - um but for now i'm just going to talk
00:28 - about how to start a club if you guys
00:30 - have
00:30 - any questions please save them until the
00:33 - end
00:34 - and let's do this so i'm going
00:37 - to share my screen
00:41 - with you guys so as i said today's
00:45 - session will be a how to start a club
00:48 - and it's i've titled it the eight steps
00:50 - to becoming a leader plus ideas so i
00:52 - will just basically talk about
00:54 - the eight most important steps in my
00:55 - opinion of how to start a club in school
00:58 - or outside of school
00:59 - and then i will give ideas suggestions
01:02 - for fundraising all that fun stuff so
01:04 - please stay until the end
01:06 - and just if you have questions please
01:08 - save them until then
01:10 - so i'm going to start by explaining the
01:12 - two types of clubs there are in my
01:14 - opinion so there's a school club
01:15 - and a outside organization non-profit
01:18 - organization whatever you want to call
01:20 - so our organization girls coded falls
01:23 - under the category of
01:24 - organization of course and so
01:28 - the difference is is that one is in
01:29 - school obviously and one is outside of
01:32 - school
01:32 - and as you can imagine the one that's
01:33 - outside of school probably has
01:35 - a lot more work involved in it we have
01:37 - like a whole website a lot of the school
01:39 - clubs are just based in school
01:41 - and um not all clubs fall under
01:45 - one or one category or the other and as
01:49 - as i'll show later with one of the club
01:51 - ideas they can be
01:53 - both at once but this is just the
01:55 - general separation i think
01:58 - so the first step to forming a club is
02:01 - to find something you're passionate
02:02 - about
02:03 - so you really have to find an idea that
02:06 - you like
02:07 - because then you'll be able to put more
02:08 - time into it and you'll be
02:10 - happier and you'll put in more time into
02:13 - the club
02:14 - and you'll be able to do it better so
02:16 - the first step
02:17 - in this step is to brainstorm ideas and
02:20 - you'll want to brainstorm ideas because
02:22 - you can have a lot of ideas but you also
02:25 - have to brainstorm if they'll work or
02:26 - not and you have to see
02:27 - how willing you are to put time into
02:29 - that idea um
02:30 - you can either build on a subject you
02:32 - like such as girls code we're building
02:34 - on programming and coding
02:36 - and empowering girls in the stem field
02:39 - or you can explore something entirely
02:41 - new if you've
02:42 - recently become interested in art you
02:44 - can form an art club so that for people
02:46 - who are also
02:47 - recently interested in art they can join
02:49 - too
02:51 - and just if it's a school club make sure
02:54 - your club doesn't already have a club
02:56 - that's based on our idea because schools
02:58 - will not take
02:58 - duplicate clubs of each other so just
03:01 - make sure your idea is unique original
03:03 - and it's something that you're
03:04 - passionate about
03:06 - step number two is to find a few friends
03:09 - to help you
03:10 - so this stuff is important because you
03:11 - can't really start a club on your own
03:14 - so if you find friends who are hard
03:16 - working and willing to put time into
03:18 - your club's ideas
03:19 - you can combine their ideas with yours
03:22 - and it'll make the club even better
03:23 - because it's all inclusive
03:25 - and it's important to have a lot of
03:27 - members in your club
03:28 - so just don't limit it to friends i say
03:31 - friends because usually people when
03:33 - starting a club
03:34 - they find their friends and from there
03:35 - they branch out but
03:37 - just try to reach out to someone form a
03:40 - club with them if you have
03:42 - someone who ha if you know someone has
03:44 - the same interest as you and this club
03:46 - then start the club with them but having
03:49 - more friends and members in your club by
03:52 - doing that you can get feedback
03:54 - and improve on your own ideas
03:57 - so um just try to find my tip for this
04:00 - one is to find
04:01 - hard-working and devoted members because
04:03 - you want members you don't want to start
04:05 - a club with just friends who are there
04:07 - to take up the leadership positions
04:08 - right
04:09 - because we all know there's some people
04:10 - who do that but
04:12 - you want to find devoted members who are
04:14 - willing to put the time
04:15 - into your club and have fun with it and
04:18 - work to make it bigger
04:21 - so for example all of us and girls code
04:23 - it not all of us
04:24 - are friends but for example i joined
04:26 - because my friend who is the vice
04:28 - president
04:28 - asked me to join and we're all
04:30 - hard-working and devoted to coding
04:33 - and from there we can meet other people
04:36 - from our website so that's a little bit
04:37 - different in school it's easier because
04:39 - you know most of the people
04:41 - but just my last take on this is to try
04:44 - and find
04:44 - friends and members who are devoted and
04:47 - willing to put the work in
04:48 - and they also like your idea because you
04:50 - don't want them joining and then saying
04:52 - that they want another idea
04:53 - so step number three is to find an
04:55 - advisor and usually this is a
04:56 - requirement for all school clubs
04:59 - because um you need someone who to have
05:02 - their like room open for you to meet in
05:05 - and you also need them to give you
05:07 - advice because the advisor
05:09 - has to you have to have an advisor to
05:11 - monitor
05:12 - how your club's doing what they have
05:14 - even in outside organizations
05:16 - it's good to have some an adult to reach
05:18 - out to because problems can be
05:20 - caused that need to involve an adult
05:24 - and so the advisor can also help with
05:26 - the registration process of your club
05:28 - which i'll talk about later
05:29 - but the registration process in most
05:32 - schools is difficult especially since
05:34 - it's not always made clear and a lot of
05:36 - students end up doing it
05:38 - on their own if they want a club because
05:40 - a lot of people have work in school
05:42 - but then again this doesn't really apply
05:45 - to outside organizations like girls
05:46 - coded because we didn't really have a
05:48 - registration process
05:49 - it's just for school and an advisor can
05:52 - also provide a room to meet in which is
05:54 - also good because you kind of you can't
05:56 - just meet on the lunch tables usually
05:59 - but if you want it to be in official
06:01 - clubs and just make sure to explain your
06:03 - goals and expectations for their
06:05 - involvement because an advisor will only
06:07 - join your club if they know is involved
06:09 - what they have to be involved in because
06:11 - usually a lot of the advisors in schools
06:14 - especially have multiple clubs that
06:16 - they're monitoring
06:18 - and so it'll be good to have um
06:22 - to have them know if you're expecting
06:24 - them to like say
06:25 - drive you or be present at events
06:27 - outside of school
06:28 - then they'll have to know that
06:29 - beforehand because you can't just tell
06:31 - them
06:32 - oh yeah we need you to do this and they
06:34 - might say no because
06:35 - usually teachers have a lot of work to
06:37 - do and um
06:39 - that'll just make it harder on them and
06:41 - on yourselves because
06:43 - it won't allow you to have those events
06:44 - that you want so just make sure you tell
06:46 - your advisor what you expect of them
06:48 - and make sure to have an advisor if
06:50 - you're in your school i
06:52 - most schools need an advisor and it's
06:54 - better to have one once again
06:56 - i'm saying just for a room and for
06:57 - advice
06:59 - step number four is to check with your
07:02 - school
07:02 - so a lot of schools have registration
07:05 - process for clubs you can't just say i'm
07:07 - gonna start this club
07:08 - four members and expect the school to go
07:11 - with that
07:12 - in a lot of schools they have to
07:13 - accommodate many many many different
07:16 - clubs so each school has
07:18 - different registration processes and you
07:21 - have to pay attention to that
07:23 - and um so that you can actually make a
07:26 - valid club in your school
07:28 - and there's a lot of deadlines for this
07:30 - stuff because um
07:31 - again this stuff is only for school
07:33 - clubs but
07:35 - um there's a lot of deadlines like when
07:37 - you have turn in this form and what you
07:38 - have to
07:39 - platform like club constitutions and all
07:41 - that sort of fun stuff
07:43 - but just make sure to be aware of those
07:46 - deadlines and follow them really really
07:48 - closely and make sure
07:49 - you're really um on task for that
07:54 - and step number five i call divide and
07:56 - conquer but it's basically to divide up
07:58 - the roles in your board
07:59 - positions because you don't want to be
08:02 - the dictator of your club right
08:04 - you want to have a large set of friends
08:08 - and other members to help you and
08:10 - because if you divide four positions
08:13 - you'll be able to have more um ideas and
08:16 - that way your club will be more
08:17 - inclusive
08:18 - and people will want to join more so
08:20 - just allow your club members to vote on
08:22 - a board because that is
08:23 - showing that you care about their
08:25 - opinions and more people
08:26 - want to join because their opinion is
08:28 - being heard also
08:30 - ideally i'm saying this as a girls coded
08:33 - experience
08:34 - but you should have especially in school
08:36 - and outside organizations um i'll talk
08:38 - about how it's a little bit different
08:39 - there
08:40 - but in school your club a lot of schools
08:43 - just want a present vice president
08:45 - and secretary and maybe sometimes a
08:47 - treasurer
08:48 - but it's good to have a communications
08:50 - director too and these clubs
08:52 - and these positions can have multiple
08:55 - members and them
08:56 - just so that you can if your club is
08:57 - really large and to make it
08:59 - as inclusive as possible and so the
09:03 - present
09:04 - or co-presence i'll talk a little bit
09:06 - about
09:07 - expanding later but the president will
09:10 - plan the majority of the events and run
09:12 - the whole club
09:12 - as a whole that's basically their job is
09:15 - to keep the club together right
09:17 - and the vice president can will assist
09:20 - the presidents because usually the
09:22 - president's job especially if your
09:24 - club organization is really large the
09:27 - presidents will have
09:28 - a lot to work on so the vice president
09:30 - will help them with that
09:33 - and that way the workload is divided and
09:37 - the club can function better
09:39 - the secretary can keep track of
09:42 - participation
09:43 - and write down any ideas or questions
09:46 - that
09:47 - club members or board members may have
09:49 - it's important to keep track of ideas
09:51 - because
09:52 - as i said you want to be it's really
09:54 - important to be inclusive in the club
09:56 - so you'll want to include as many people
09:58 - as possible and that involves writing
10:00 - down their ideas
10:01 - using them to better your club and
10:04 - um yeah so the secretary basically does
10:08 - that
10:08 - the treasurer is in charge of the budget
10:10 - if your club has a budget so not all
10:13 - clubs
10:13 - have budgets usually school clubs don't
10:16 - and
10:17 - um i'll talk about that a little bit
10:19 - more later in the next slide
10:21 - but usually um outside organizations um
10:25 - like for example girls code is a
10:27 - non-profit organization so we don't
10:30 - currently have a treasure we're thinking
10:32 - about it just because we want to make a
10:34 - club better
10:34 - but if you're just starting out no you
10:36 - don't always need money to start out
10:38 - your club
10:39 - um but if you have a budget if your club
10:44 - is going to be really big
10:45 - and for example if you're extending from
10:46 - like a charity organization
10:48 - then you'll need a treasure to keep
10:50 - track of the money that they're donating
10:51 - to those
10:52 - organizations so the treasurer is the
10:55 - one in charge of the budget
10:57 - and the communications director sends
10:59 - out emails which is really important
11:00 - because you really want to notify your
11:02 - members
11:02 - of your meetings beforehand you don't
11:04 - want to tell them the day before oh hey
11:06 - guys we're going to have
11:07 - a club meeting tomorrow because not all
11:09 - of them would make it and
11:10 - that really discourages members because
11:12 - they don't know what's going on
11:14 - and they'll just want to get out of the
11:16 - club because
11:18 - it's very unorganized so the
11:19 - communications director's job
11:21 - really makes the club organized and
11:22 - scheduled so that because they send out
11:25 - emails notifying the members of any
11:26 - changes events or meetings
11:29 - so making different jobs helps the club
11:33 - become
11:33 - organized and efficient more organized
11:36 - and more efficient
11:37 - so dividing the rules helps with
11:40 - organization
11:40 - because the workload is divided and it's
11:43 - not just
11:44 - all um on top of one person it's not all
11:47 - on top of you as i said we don't want to
11:49 - be a dictatorship
11:50 - we want to have like
11:53 - parliament i guess but um
11:57 - making different jobs helps with that
11:59 - and it also improves the efficiency of
12:01 - the club because
12:02 - dividing the workload means that the
12:04 - different work the
12:05 - all the work can be done quicker and
12:08 - that way your club
12:10 - becomes better and it's able to attract
12:12 - more members
12:13 - and it's important to allow other
12:15 - leadership positions because
12:16 - we're not a dictatorship but it's
12:19 - important to allow other leadership
12:20 - positions because other people
12:22 - contribute their ideas
12:23 - and by combining your ideas with other
12:25 - ideas you're being inclusive
12:27 - allowing for people to benefit your club
12:30 - and that really helps um
12:34 - to make your club better and more
12:36 - inclusive because as i said
12:38 - the one important takeaway for a club is
12:40 - to have it be inclusive because then
12:42 - more people want to join
12:44 - and um oh yeah this is my tip so allow
12:47 - for clubs to have
12:48 - for club positions to have two members
12:50 - if your club is very
12:52 - large so you can have more than two you
12:55 - don't want to have like a whole group
12:56 - for each position
12:58 - because that may be a little bit
13:00 - unorganized
13:01 - but if you have multiple numbers for
13:02 - each position then
13:04 - especially if your club is really large
13:06 - like for girls coded we have at least
13:08 - two people on each position
13:10 - but um it helps with the workload
13:12 - dividing it as i said dividing the
13:14 - workflow it makes the
13:15 - um club process much more efficient and
13:18 - it gets the work done quicker
13:24 - and so step number six is optional
13:27 - it depends on your club but it's to plan
13:29 - a budget and i just want to talk about
13:30 - this one because it is important
13:32 - sometimes
13:33 - but some schools have events where clubs
13:36 - can collect money for example in my
13:37 - school we have this thing it's called
13:38 - club rush where we each buy um
13:43 - like food items and we sell them for a
13:46 - higher price to make profit and that way
13:48 - we get money for a club
13:50 - and for a lot of clubs this is necessary
13:52 - because
13:53 - you need money to function if you're
13:54 - going to plan a big event where everyone
13:56 - goes somewhere
13:58 - you have to pay for buses for food and
14:01 - for transportation is buses but all that
14:03 - stuff you have to pay or if you're
14:05 - planning
14:06 - a technology competition related club
14:09 - you have to pay the registration fee
14:12 - and that's just where the budget comes
14:15 - into play but not all clubs especially
14:17 - if you're new
14:18 - to starting a club and if you're if your
14:19 - club is small in the beginning
14:21 - and you don't really need a budget you
14:23 - as it gets larger then
14:26 - but you so as i talked about you have to
14:28 - decide what the club needs
14:30 - and how you're gonna get all that money
14:32 - because if
14:33 - it's an insanely large cost you're going
14:35 - to have to
14:36 - go out and require more money and
14:40 - usually that's what puts a lot of people
14:41 - off
14:42 - because they don't have the funds for
14:43 - that so just start small
14:46 - is my advice and grow your club larger
14:48 - and as it grows larger
14:50 - you can get a budget and you can have
14:51 - people donate to a club or you can hold
14:53 - fundraising events which i'll talk about
14:55 - later
14:56 - and my third um point for this is that
14:59 - this can be a separate job headed by the
15:01 - treasure as i talked about the last
15:03 - slide the treasure is the
15:04 - specific handles specifically handles
15:07 - the budget
15:08 - if there is one and usually school clubs
15:11 - as i said don't have a budget but if
15:13 - you're gonna
15:14 - collect money for an event or something
15:17 - um then it's good to have a budget
15:19 - planned
15:20 - so that you know how much you spend how
15:22 - much you already have
15:25 - so step number seven is to plan
15:28 - ahead and planning ahead is important
15:32 - because you have to schedule your
15:34 - meetings beforehand in order for people
15:36 - to come as i talked about the
15:38 - communications director's job is
15:40 - really really important because imagine
15:43 - that you're a club member and you get an
15:45 - email like the day before
15:48 - and it says tomorrow we're going to have
15:50 - a club meeting would you go to that
15:51 - meeting
15:53 - i wouldn't because it's just i might
15:56 - have too much on my plate at that moment
15:58 - i might be too stressed out
16:00 - and i just wouldn't want to deal with it
16:02 - or i would forget
16:03 - if you know something for a while
16:05 - beforehand if you get reminders about it
16:07 - then it helps to remember
16:09 - so you want to plan ahead make sure your
16:11 - meetings correspond
16:12 - with as many um members calendars as
16:16 - possible
16:17 - because you can't schedule a meeting and
16:19 - expect people to show up because
16:21 - they people not always put your club
16:24 - first
16:24 - they might have other time commitments
16:27 - that they've made beforehand
16:28 - and an important tip is to ask um
16:33 - what days and times works for people
16:35 - like through email maybe say
16:37 - um we'll have we're planning on having
16:40 - like
16:41 - our meetings wednesday or thursday
16:42 - please respond with the day that you
16:44 - will
16:45 - more more like you most want the club to
16:48 - meet
16:48 - and is most convenient for you and
16:52 - coming up with events that people can go
16:54 - to
16:56 - is very encouraging and engaging to your
16:58 - members and also i want to talk about um
17:00 - planning events so different clubs
17:02 - need to plan different events for
17:04 - example um
17:06 - let's say that your club is the
17:09 - interact rotary club and they go and
17:11 - they build
17:12 - houses for people they help build houses
17:15 - for people who
17:17 - need homes for the homeless and um
17:21 - you have to plan the event so you have
17:23 - to tell your members when that event is
17:25 - going to be beforehand you can't just
17:26 - tell them like
17:27 - saturday we're going here because no one
17:29 - will want to come so you want to make
17:31 - sure you know about
17:32 - those dates and that you communicate
17:34 - that to your
17:35 - members beforehand and finally our last
17:38 - step
17:39 - is partnering and i know this may seem
17:42 - like a big goal
17:43 - because if you're starting out small you
17:46 - usually
17:46 - start small and then get bigger and
17:48 - bigger and bigger but partnering is
17:50 - important because
17:51 - it expands your um
17:54 - club it expands in your club's influence
17:57 - for example
17:58 - i'm going to give an example with girls
18:00 - coded we're currently partnering with an
18:02 - organization called girlplex
18:04 - and they are on the east coast and as
18:06 - you can imagine in california
18:08 - we are very far away from the east coast
18:10 - because we're based in california and
18:12 - we're a small
18:13 - but through making our meetings and our
18:15 - website and through um
18:17 - and through reaching out to people
18:19 - through social media
18:20 - and all that stuff we have managed to
18:24 - gain their support and we have partnered
18:26 - with them
18:26 - so now even though we're based way on
18:28 - the west coast of the us
18:30 - we have influence in the east coast too
18:33 - people on the east coast know about us
18:35 - that partnering
18:38 - is um makes your club larger and have a
18:41 - greater influence because you want to
18:42 - know
18:43 - that as many people will be able to join
18:45 - your club as possible and that involves
18:47 - making it bigger
18:48 - making it more and you want to make
18:50 - people want to come to that club and
18:52 - expanding its influence
18:53 - can be done through partnering
18:56 - and so now i'm going to talk about ideas
18:58 - for clubs
19:00 - and um my first club ideas are the
19:04 - classics so we have the book club the
19:06 - key club and homework club
19:08 - and i'm sure you guys have heard about
19:10 - those in classics the problem with
19:11 - classics is that usually your school
19:13 - has them if you want to make it a school
19:15 - book because usually these are school
19:16 - clubs i think most of my ideas are based
19:18 - on school clubs
19:19 - but um these classics are
19:22 - the first ones that like for example my
19:24 - school has
19:26 - about a hundred and fifty maybe a
19:29 - hundred clubs
19:30 - and you can imagine that they probably
19:33 - already have a book club
19:34 - and key club and homework club right so
19:37 - you want to have
19:38 - an idea that is really original but if
19:40 - your school doesn't have these
19:41 - it's a great way to start because most
19:43 - people will know about that
19:44 - and more people want to start these
19:46 - because they're so well known
19:48 - and um homework club i just want to say
19:51 - is an amazing idea because
19:52 - it involves people getting together and
19:54 - helping each other with homework after
19:56 - school and that can be amazing to
19:58 - students
19:58 - because a lot a lot of people need help
20:01 - but they're too afraid to reach out and
20:02 - so a club can be a really
20:04 - stress-free environment to reach out to
20:06 - someone for help that's necessary
20:09 - um so my second one which is really
20:12 - popular
20:13 - is partnering with the charity
20:14 - organization and this one
20:16 - is an amazing cause charity
20:19 - organizations are amazing because
20:21 - people um this is basically based on
20:24 - helping other people and with charity
20:26 - organizations you can also get
20:27 - volunteering hours which is often used
20:29 - to encourage
20:30 - members to join but it's just a great
20:32 - cause like you're helping other people
20:35 - and these are just three but operation
20:39 - smile make a wish and save the children
20:41 - are really well known and usually these
20:43 - are throughout the whole country or even
20:46 - expand
20:47 - outwards from that operation smile helps
20:50 - um gain money or donates money
20:53 - for kids to get surgery if they have the
20:56 - cleft lip
20:57 - and you're bettering people's lives by
21:00 - donating money fundraising
21:02 - and charity organizations a lot of
21:04 - people join because it's such a great
21:06 - cause and for make-a-wish
21:08 - i was going to talk about how clubs can
21:11 - overlap between a school club and an
21:13 - outside organization
21:16 - so make a wish expands by
21:19 - letting students have school clubs
21:21 - outside
21:22 - or just be chapter presents outside of
21:24 - school or even just have fundraisers so
21:27 - um i'm gonna give an example with a
21:30 - school nearby me
21:31 - that they have host a fashion show and
21:34 - donate
21:35 - all of that money to make a wish and
21:37 - make-a-wish is actually
21:38 - they collect money and they
21:41 - um find and they use that those
21:44 - resources
21:45 - to buy stuff that kids really want but
21:48 - can't get
21:48 - and they gift it to them and it's
21:51 - amazing
21:52 - but um the great thing is that it
21:54 - doesn't it's very flexible
21:56 - make a wish allows for people to be
21:59 - for students to start a club in school
22:01 - and expand from there or they could just
22:03 - be chapter presidents
22:05 - because usually starting an outside
22:06 - organization is easier because
22:08 - you don't have to um the registration
22:11 - process i mean because there is none
22:13 - but usually it's harder to um work with
22:17 - so i just wanted to let you guys know
22:18 - that it doesn't limit to just
22:21 - school club or organization it could be
22:23 - both or
22:24 - yeah and my third
22:28 - tip is trying a stem club so girls coded
22:31 - is a stem club we are based on coding
22:34 - and
22:35 - but we're also based on empowering girls
22:37 - and encouraging girls to enter the
22:40 - coding field and overall stem field
22:45 - and so these are just a few options but
22:47 - there are so many different stem clubs
22:49 - and competitions
22:50 - so you can find a competition a team
22:52 - competition and start forming a team
22:55 - and that could be your club for example
22:57 - the science in ocean bowl
22:59 - is like trivia but for science and ocean
23:02 - and you go and you have the competition
23:04 - and you answer questions as a team and
23:06 - you gain points like that
23:07 - robotics is also really fun the two
23:09 - robotics clubs at my school
23:11 - are vex and frc and both are amazing
23:14 - because people join because you're able
23:16 - to create something with your hands
23:18 - and then go on a competition and
23:21 - experiment with that coding is also
23:23 - really good because
23:24 - programming and software development are
23:27 - so
23:28 - high in demand for jobs and literally
23:30 - every stem field
23:31 - has been very high demand so i really
23:33 - encourage you guys
23:34 - to pursue a stem interest
23:39 - but fourth option is to explore an
23:41 - artistic talent artistic talents are
23:43 - amazing because
23:44 - they are they you know they allow you to
23:46 - show your creativity
23:48 - they allow you to um and they just allow
23:51 - you to
23:52 - be like use a hobby for it to develop or
23:56 - even if you want to go into the art
23:58 - um industry this really helps because
24:01 - it lets you teach and be top art
24:05 - and so these are just diffuser
24:06 - photography art review magazine comic
24:08 - book club
24:09 - these that all sound really fun and um
24:13 - they're very creative and they're very
24:15 - flexible with what you can do
24:17 - and um they usually have a very
24:19 - stress-free environment which brings me
24:20 - to our last option which is just
24:22 - fun and stress-free quotes and usually
24:25 - these are
24:26 - um used in school but
24:29 - uh you so imagine your school day is
24:31 - really stressful right
24:32 - and how awesome would it be to go let's
24:35 - say to lunch or an after school club
24:37 - that just involves like a harry potter
24:39 - kahoot
24:40 - um a lot of people are obsessed with
24:42 - harry potter i
24:44 - am and um these are just
24:47 - um basically small silly debate topics
24:50 - like which house do you prefer
24:51 - and stuff like that or you can have a
24:54 - magic club magic clubs are awesome
24:55 - because
24:56 - you got to learn a whole new talent
24:58 - which is amazing magic so great
25:00 - and cooking just allows for a
25:02 - stress-free hobby that you could develop
25:04 - and if especially with um a lot of
25:08 - cultures in your school
25:09 - a lot of different ethnicities if you
25:13 - form a cooking club
25:14 - then you can develop it into an
25:16 - international club
25:17 - which includes cooking and customs from
25:21 - different
25:22 - ethnicities and so on
25:25 - so those are just some ideas for clubs
25:27 - to start and now i'm going to talk
25:29 - about tech clubs specifically because we
25:31 - are a tech club
25:33 - and we really encourage students
25:36 - our students to go into these
25:40 - so tech clubs are amazing as i said
25:43 - before because they offer
25:45 - a um jump start into the
25:49 - stem industry and right now the stem
25:51 - industry
25:52 - is very um it's looking for a lot of
25:55 - people so if you pursue a stem interest
25:58 - then you will most definitely find a job
26:01 - and
26:01 - i don't want it to sound just because of
26:03 - that but stem
26:04 - is an amazing field an amazing subject
26:08 - my favorite uh school subjects are
26:10 - always stem subjects because they allow
26:12 - you to experiment
26:13 - visualize they allow you to do
26:15 - everything and
26:16 - i'm just some ideas for tech clubs are
26:19 - for
26:19 - of course girls coded is a tech club
26:22 - that empowers girls to code because
26:24 - right now
26:25 - we don't have a lot of girls in coding
26:27 - and um
26:28 - in stem industries and we really seek to
26:31 - bridge that gender gap that is forming
26:34 - and we want to encourage girls to apply
26:37 - for stem related jobs because a lot of
26:39 - girls are intimidated by it
26:41 - i um last year i took a stem class
26:44 - in which i was the only girl and that
26:46 - can really intimidate a lot of
26:49 - women and they want to drop those and
26:51 - they'll want to pursue something
26:53 - with more girls in it and there is a lot
26:55 - of sexism in these industries
26:57 - where people um
27:00 - look on um and it's just harder for
27:04 - girls to apply
27:05 - but we're seeking to bridge that because
27:07 - there is no way to fix this
27:09 - without pushing girls into the stem
27:12 - field
27:12 - we have to um try and do this
27:16 - stuff because it is better for us and we
27:19 - have
27:19 - the opportunity to do it so for tech
27:22 - clubs
27:24 - we um you can have there's a lot of
27:27 - local opportunities to visit tech
27:29 - companies like not necessarily the big
27:30 - ones the big ones
27:31 - it's usually through school through an
27:33 - advisor who talks to them
27:35 - and they bring you in as a school trip
27:37 - but smaller companies
27:39 - can have you can have your club visit
27:42 - them and
27:43 - thus learn about their opportunities for
27:45 - work what they do
27:46 - and it's just a fun experience it's
27:49 - almost like an internship except for
27:50 - like
27:51 - an hour but and you're just learning
27:54 - about it
27:54 - and also working with other businesses
27:57 - so you could
27:58 - some of these businesses um extend
28:01 - to members to students trying to form
28:04 - clubs and it really helps because
28:06 - um a lot of people don't know from where
28:10 - to start
28:10 - and these businesses sponsor these
28:13 - causes
28:14 - to um push more people into the stem
28:17 - field because it is the major one right
28:20 - now
28:21 - in the world today if you see if you
28:23 - look around there is technology
28:24 - everywhere and it's so important
28:26 - to be involved in that and also this one
28:29 - is kind of
28:30 - like um additional point but looking for
28:32 - stem-related events at libraries
28:34 - libraries have and there could be other
28:37 - places but i know for sure that
28:38 - libraries have a lot of
28:40 - stem related um events including little
28:44 - um organizations that develop their
28:46 - businesses in there
28:47 - and you can we also have we all know
28:50 - um an hour of code right and schools
28:54 - develop that but
28:55 - you can also work with that and you can
28:57 - spark your interest
28:58 - of for coding there or through
29:01 - organizations like girls code which i'm
29:03 - so happy you guys have joined
29:04 - because that means you're pursuing an
29:07 - interest that you like
29:08 - and that will be so useful to you so
29:12 - moving on i'm going to talk about some
29:13 - fundraising ideas
29:15 - and fundraising ideas include bake sales
29:18 - which i'm sure all of us have heard of
29:19 - where people bake and
29:21 - the all the donations go to the club
29:24 - science fairs are amazing especially for
29:26 - technology related clubs because
29:28 - students
29:29 - have the opportunity to show what they
29:31 - have made
29:32 - and earn money in the process for their
29:34 - club movie nights are
29:36 - also great because they should make a
29:39 - stress-free environment for students to
29:41 - come to
29:41 - and they pay for that um entertainment
29:44 - and that can be used to fuel your club
29:47 - scavenger hunts
29:48 - are fun school olympics are also fun
29:50 - like school olympics and fashion show i
29:52 - feel like go together because they can
29:53 - be a whole school effort
29:55 - and everyone will want to participate
29:57 - and
29:58 - you don't even have to raise money for a
30:00 - club you can raise awareness for a club
30:02 - like raise awareness how we do
30:05 - breast cancer week for example
30:09 - um and it's just you're raising
30:12 - awareness for that
30:13 - cause so um
30:16 - or you can have a craft fair where that
30:18 - kind of goes in with science fair both
30:20 - crafts it all
30:21 - gains money for your club right and
30:24 - fundraising.com if you guys want to
30:25 - write that down that is an amazing
30:27 - website because a lot of
30:28 - stores and businesses
30:32 - will lower their costs for products if
30:35 - your club
30:36 - if your club reaches out to them and
30:37 - says and like says
30:39 - we want to sell this and gain money from
30:41 - it and profit from it so that we can
30:42 - you use it to fuel our club or donate it
30:45 - to a charity organization
30:47 - like for example you can buy like a
30:48 - whole bag of lollipops
30:50 - for a very low cost and then sell each
30:53 - lollipop for a higher cost at your
30:55 - school fair for example
30:57 - and that's just helpful to profit your
30:59 - pub
31:02 - and i think okay and we're almost done
31:05 - and i just want to say that the most
31:07 - important thing is to choose something
31:08 - that you're really passionate about
31:10 - and that you'll have fun and put time
31:13 - into because
31:14 - if you're not passionate about this club
31:15 - idea then it won't last long because
31:18 - eventually you'll get tired of it you'll
31:20 - get tired of having to deal with it so
31:21 - just try to find something that you're
31:23 - interested in
31:25 - all right this is the time where you
31:27 - guys can ask questions
31:28 - i will stop sharing and feel free to
31:31 - write them in
31:32 - chat or on yourselves and speak
31:35 - thank you for listening to the
31:36 - presentation
31:38 - all right thank you everyone for coming
31:41 - i really appreciate you

31:44 - believe the next one is going to be an
31:46 - intro to github
31:47 - these are amazing if you want to um
31:50 - pursue like small interests other than
31:53 - coding but make sure to sign up for
31:55 - coding classes they are free
31:57 - we will teach um python until
32:00 - i think the end of november or
32:01 - mid-november and then we start web
32:03 - development courses
