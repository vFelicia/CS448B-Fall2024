00:00 - development today we'll be covering what
00:02 - web dev is
00:04 - what is web dev well it's a process of
00:07 - creating websites like a single web page
00:09 - or creating web apps or games
00:13 - how do websites work when you access the
00:16 - internet you probably use something
00:17 - called a browser like google chrome or
00:19 - safari
00:20 - these browsers are what we call clients
00:22 - client center request website files from
00:24 - a server
00:25 - so that they can display the site
00:30 - what's the difference between client
00:32 - side and server side
00:34 - well client side oops well client side
00:38 - is the side of the website that you see
00:40 - when you visit sites like google
00:41 - yahoo or youtube any changes that you
00:45 - make to the client side webpage
00:47 - will make changes to what's what gets
00:49 - displayed on other devices
00:52 - server side is the side of the website
00:54 - that the server sees
00:55 - this is where your website files will be
00:57 - located
01:08 - what is html html stands for hypertext
01:12 - markup language and it's used to create
01:14 - and arrange things like
01:15 - text images and videos it's like the
01:19 - foundation of your website and it's what
01:22 - gets displayed
01:23 - to users
01:26 - that's what you're editing and i'll show
01:28 - you how that works
01:30 - um what is css it stands for cascading
01:32 - style sheets
01:33 - um it's to kind of edit the elements
01:37 - that
01:37 - you added on the html file to make it
01:39 - look prettier
01:41 - right like this slide
01:44 - the example is very bare there's no font
01:48 - there's no styling but with css
01:51 - which is cascading style sheets for
01:53 - short it makes it look really pretty
01:55 - and you could also work on like
01:58 - margins website layout
02:02 - all that stuff with css and here's an
02:05 - example of how that works
02:06 - so it's it looks a lot better than
02:09 - just black and white right and
02:13 - so now we have javascript um
02:16 - it's added it's used to add
02:18 - functionality and to change the behavior
02:20 - of websites
02:21 - and so it could be as simple as like
02:25 - a click of a button on the website right
02:28 - your to make that button work you have
02:30 - to use javascript
02:32 - right or to make it modify something
02:34 - that's on the web
02:36 - page or give you data you need a you
02:39 - need javascript right
02:41 - and um to get
02:45 - into apis which we'll get into later
02:47 - which is
02:48 - fetching data from another server
02:52 - um you need javascript for that you need
02:54 - ajax or
02:55 - fetch but those are both javascript
02:58 - things um some examples like
03:03 - you could get the time that's stored on
03:04 - your computer
03:06 - using this this is a function
03:09 - and then you could run the function
03:13 - and make it display the time
03:26 - upload account you can just create new
03:32 - and then make sure this is html and css
03:35 - javascript
03:36 - and we can name this let's just name
03:38 - this demo
03:39 - um i'm going to create the replit
03:44 - are you
03:53 - um okay so these are
03:56 - tags uh
04:00 - we have things like head
04:03 - meta link
04:10 - man let's go to these demos
04:24 - okay so you could put this on the bottom
04:29 - um i like to always put it on the top
04:33 - but i'll show you how you can do that
04:35 - later
04:36 - and so these this file all the elements
04:40 - get
04:40 - added from top to bottom right and
04:44 - the head tag anything that's within the
04:46 - head tag
04:48 - it's not going to be displayed on your
04:49 - website except the title
04:52 - um which is going to be this one and
04:54 - that's going to be displayed
04:56 - on the tab right and the body
04:59 - is what actually gets displayed on your
05:02 - website
05:04 - and so we have some important tags
05:07 - and i'll show you how they get displayed
05:09 - on the website
05:16 - see we have hello so if i
05:20 - man if i decided to put this in head
05:23 - it wouldn't pop up because nothing on
05:26 - head gets just
05:28 - okay never mind okay but
05:32 - you don't want to put anything in head
05:34 - head is basically what
05:36 - for all your imports and stuff like that
05:38 - and the body is what
05:41 - gets displayed in your website right and
05:43 - so we have some common tags here here's
05:45 - div
05:46 - e um
05:50 - image
06:03 - i'll stewie is
06:08 - okay so these are some commonly used
06:11 - uh tags um div is used a lot
06:14 - um actually i guess i should show you
06:18 - something first
06:20 - so in html all the elements
06:23 - which is stuff like div is um
06:27 - in a box right all these all these like
06:30 - this layer yeah for every element
06:33 - they're all boxes
06:34 - if that makes any sense and i'll show
06:35 - you what i mean um i'll set this to
06:38 - id
06:42 - right i'll show you what id means later
06:44 - as well
06:45 - but let's just set this
06:48 - okay
06:54 - you don't have to worry about what i'm
06:56 - doing
06:57 - i'm just trying to show you that
07:01 - these are rectangles and
07:04 - um
07:12 - all right so can you see that these are
07:16 - all rectangles it doesn't matter
07:17 - what the dimensions are
07:20 - they would always be rectangled
07:24 - and so you have to keep that in mind and
07:27 - um
07:28 - elements like to be added from top to
07:31 - bottom where they kind of stack up on
07:32 - top of each other
07:34 - um they very rarely want to go from left
07:38 - to right
07:39 - and so if you want to do that you'd have
07:41 - to do that with a
07:43 - css file but i'll show you what a couple
07:46 - of these
07:47 - common image tags do
07:51 - um this is a paragraph tab and so
07:54 - you can just write a bunch of things in
07:56 - here and it'll get displayed
08:00 - all right let me actually get rid of
08:01 - this box
08:05 - all right so we have a bunch of text
08:06 - like that gets displayed
08:09 - um the image tag is pretty cool because
08:11 - you could actually
08:13 - um get images from
08:17 - other websites so let's say i were to
08:20 - want to get an image of a bagel
08:24 - right go to images
08:29 - let's get this photo right here it
08:32 - doesn't look very appetizing
08:34 - but
08:37 - and if we were to get
08:41 - this photo and then
08:44 - put it into here
08:48 - we would see
08:52 - wow that's very big but yeah we see the
08:55 - photo
08:56 - of the bagel
09:02 - and it's very large so if you want to
09:06 - edit the size of that you're going to
09:07 - have to do that
09:08 - on the css file
09:11 - um we got the link
09:15 - not one second
09:32 - one second i'm sorry
09:50 - okay so now we're gonna work on
09:53 - inspecting element now that we know what
09:55 - those basic tags are
09:58 - um actually wait i haven't i haven't
10:00 - showed you all the tags yet
10:01 - let me finish sharing those really quick
10:05 - and then so now that we got the image
10:07 - tag out of the way
10:09 - um actually it should
10:12 - i didn't show you what the source tag
10:14 - did the source tag is really important
10:16 - or the source um
10:18 - just the source yeah you need the source
10:20 - for the image right now this could be a
10:22 - local file that's saved on your
10:25 - hosting service or your desktop um
10:29 - it's basically it could either be the
10:32 - folder that
10:34 - contains all these three files html css
10:37 - and javascript files
10:39 - or it could be a url either
10:42 - they both work right um
10:46 - now we have uh the link
10:50 - the link is really important because
10:52 - it's right here
10:53 - link and script
10:56 - this works here okay it works um
11:00 - these are really important because the
11:02 - link is to import your css file
11:05 - and we could see that in the link right
11:07 - here and then
11:09 - the script allows you to import your
11:11 - javascript file
11:12 - and then these are the headers
11:15 - now the headers are important because
11:19 - your website kind of gets ranked on your
11:21 - headers as well
11:24 - ranking means like how high up
11:28 - your website is is on like the google
11:31 - results right
11:33 - and then so if we have a header of hello
11:37 - and then so there's headers one through
11:39 - six
11:41 - and they basically work like that now
11:44 - header 1
11:45 - is bigger than header 6 and header 1 is
11:47 - usually reserved for the title of your
11:49 - website
11:51 - and then we have span which is basically
11:53 - like another text box
11:56 - i'll show you that right here
12:02 - okay
12:06 - all right now let's do the uh inspect
12:08 - element
12:11 - i think that'd be good
12:16 - all right so i'm gonna send you guys
12:20 - the link for the inspect element
12:26 - so we have the weather website and we
12:29 - have
12:30 - this website oh
12:34 - they're both the same size okay i'll
12:37 - send it to you guys
12:38 - in the chat
12:42 - i don't know if i can get this thing to
12:50 - work
13:03 - um i don't know why it's not showing up
13:06 - for me
13:11 - oh here we go okay so
13:14 - here's a link to the weather and then
13:18 - here's a link to the disney
13:21 - website and so we're going to work on
13:23 - the weatherworks
13:25 - uh weather website first
13:29 - and uh it's going to be pretty cool
13:33 - so once you guys open that all up we'll
13:36 - get started
13:47 - okay so this website right here
13:52 - um it runs on the same three files
13:55 - that i mentioned before html css and
13:59 - javascript
14:00 - and so whatever
14:03 - whatever is being displayed on the
14:05 - website that you can see right now
14:07 - it's because of html and uh
14:10 - css for styling and so
14:13 - that means that whatever you edit will
14:16 - also be an
14:17 - edit to the html file right which in
14:20 - turn edits what it displays
14:22 - and so now when we inspect element on
14:24 - certain elements of the page
14:26 - we can kind of mess around with what
14:30 - a website displays and you might have
14:32 - done this for
14:34 - i don't know your grades to show off or
14:36 - something
14:37 - but um in case you don't know we'll go
14:39 - over it and we'll
14:41 - kind of go over how it works
14:44 - and so let's say i want to change the
14:46 - weather to
14:48 - 400 degrees right um
14:51 - we see a span here which is what i kind
14:53 - of showed you on the replit
14:55 - right here the span right
15:00 - and we know that it's a text container
15:03 - and so we could change this
15:05 - to be something like 400 and then
15:08 - it gets displayed right because we're
15:10 - editing the html file which
15:13 - edits what we see on the on the website
15:16 - right
15:24 - and then so let's say we want to change
15:27 - this
15:28 - video or this image
15:32 - is this a video oh it's an image
15:36 - okay let's say i want to change this to
15:37 - the bagel image right
15:41 - um let's see let's look for that bagel
15:44 - image again
15:47 - that's how you get the same image right
15:49 - here
15:51 - and there is a new tab copy this
16:07 - is so we see the source
16:10 - that's what i showed you before the
16:12 - source is really important because
16:14 - um it's
16:17 - where your file is going to be sourced
16:20 - from i'm not sure why this isn't working
16:24 - but i'll show you an example of that on
16:26 - another website
16:29 - um
16:33 - so yeah i mean you could edit basically
16:36 - any text or any image on the site
16:39 - you could say connect with them
16:42 - i don't know and then um
16:45 - let's see if we could do something fun
16:47 - with this are you guys all following
16:49 - along by the way
16:50 - i don't know if you guys are but it's a
16:52 - good idea too
16:57 - so now let's move over to the uh disney
16:59 - site
17:00 - and then so let's try and change this
17:02 - image to the big website i'm pretty sure
17:04 - this will work
17:08 - let's move over here
17:13 - okay span
17:16 - here is the image source
17:21 - okay there we go how do you guys like
17:24 - that i
17:25 - oh wait okay
17:28 - wait hold up hold up that was actually
17:30 - really cool i like that
17:32 - let's let's leave it at that okay so now
17:36 - i know we have
17:37 - a bagel so we we changed the image using
17:40 - the image tag right
17:43 - the really use an image tag
17:47 - and then if you want to change this to
17:50 - um this one's actually pretty cool
17:54 - because
17:54 - when you click stream now it takes you
17:56 - another website right
17:58 - let's see if we could change that to do
18:01 - something else
18:02 - oh okay so an a tag
18:05 - is basically saying um
18:09 - move me to this page or something like
18:12 - that right
18:12 - so it's basically telling you to move to
18:15 - another page it's like an action
18:17 - you could say um if we wanted changes to
18:20 - move to
18:21 - google.com we could very much
18:25 - do that um let me see right now
18:31 - oops
18:35 - okay let's change this
18:38 - to google.com
18:42 - right if we click it now
18:45 - okay i think we're gonna need https
19:02 - okay so now when we click this it's
19:04 - going to take us to google
19:05 - and so it just shows you like
19:09 - you could literally edit anything on
19:11 - whatever website
19:13 - but it only shows up for you and the
19:15 - reason why that is because
19:17 - you're on the client side the server is
19:19 - set up so that it doesn't take changes
19:22 - that you make on the website
19:24 - so i mean if that was the case if we
19:27 - were allowed to make changes on whatever
19:28 - website we wanted that was that would be
19:30 - a huge security issue
19:32 - um let's see my chats
19:38 - you guys have any questions so far
19:45 - you did not get the link okay
19:50 - okay
19:54 - um i don't know if we're supposed to go
19:56 - back yet
20:10 - do you guys follow along okay
20:19 - yes yeah that was pretty cool
20:23 - okay sounds good
20:26 - um
20:31 - when i'm gonna spend a couple more
20:34 - minutes on the replay
20:36 - and then we'll head over and watch this
20:37 - last video
20:44 - okay so i'll kind of show you a quick
20:47 - demo
20:48 - of javascript and um
20:51 - css so let's say i have a button here
20:54 - now button's also a tag
20:56 - and i say click me right
20:59 - you'll have a button called click me now
21:02 - if i give us an id
21:03 - and an id is basically a way for
21:06 - an element to be identified right so
21:11 - if i had a thousand button elements if i
21:14 - if i just say hey
21:16 - when i click a button you know do this
21:19 - or that
21:20 - because you can't do that because you
21:21 - don't know what button you're talking
21:22 - about right it could be buttons for
21:23 - different functions
21:25 - and so we would give these ids
21:30 - a unique name right so we'd say
21:34 - um color button
21:37 - right now whatever
21:41 - id you give to any element here
21:44 - it automatically allows you to retrieve
21:46 - it from the javascript file in the css
21:48 - file
21:49 - you can see an example of the css one
21:52 - right here when it says
21:54 - box oh
21:58 - i think we are done for the day but um
22:03 - yeah i hope you guys
22:06 - learned something um
22:10 - i think they're closing the breaker
22:15 - now
22:19 - but in the meantime i guess i could
22:20 - finish this off
22:23 - um so
22:26 - we have uh okay well i guess we have to
22:28 - go now all right thanks guys
