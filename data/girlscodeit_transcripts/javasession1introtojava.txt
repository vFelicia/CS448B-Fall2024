00:00 - all right so hey guys my name is jessica
00:02 - i'll be your teacher for today
00:04 - um i'm a senior cs student
00:08 - at university of maryland so and for
00:11 - this
00:12 - lesson or for this class i would just be
00:14 - like going through the um
00:16 - intro to java just giving you a basic
00:18 - overview
00:19 - of like what this language is about why
00:22 - you should learn java
00:24 - um we won't be doing any programming for
00:26 - today so don't worry
00:28 - about um all of that and
00:32 - let me see oh yeah if you have any
00:34 - questions feel free like if you're
00:36 - comfortable
00:36 - uh and and just like ask away
00:39 - um otherwise you can also just ask in
00:42 - chat and i'll try my best to answer
00:46 - all right so again for today's lesson
00:49 - all we'll really be doing is just
00:52 - going over a basic overview of the
00:54 - course like
00:55 - what you'll be learning and what to
00:56 - expect for this course
00:58 - um next just like what is java why do
01:01 - you want to learn java
01:03 - um finally like setting up our our ide
01:06 - basically we're using reflect for this
01:08 - class so just learning how to make it
01:10 - account
01:11 - and how to like start a java program um
01:14 - finally kind of a workshop more like a
01:17 - demo of
01:18 - like what java looks like um
01:21 - and then tips for learning a programming
01:23 - language and
01:25 - finally any helpful links
01:28 - so first off um just wondering how many
01:31 - of you
01:32 - are um wanting to take like the ap exam
01:44 - all right so basically on this course
01:47 - is sweet so this course is
01:51 - basically following the general ap
01:53 - curriculum
01:54 - um however like if you aren't if you
01:57 - aren't planning to take
01:58 - like the ap exams or you are an ap
02:00 - student don't worry
02:01 - this is still pretty accessible to
02:03 - beginners
02:04 - um and like i said it's designed to
02:07 - basically
02:09 - prep ap students for exams so we'll give
02:12 - you like example
02:13 - um frq and multiple choice questions if
02:16 - you aren't planning to take the ap exams
02:18 - um we do have questions that are geared
02:20 - more for beginners
02:22 - um again it follows the ap csa
02:24 - curriculum
02:25 - um don't worry about like having to be
02:28 - good at math you don't need to be good
02:30 - at math to honestly learn most
02:31 - programming languages
02:33 - unless they're like specifically geared
02:35 - towards math
02:36 - so don't worry about like oh i don't i
02:39 - haven't taken like
02:40 - calculus or anything so can i learn java
02:42 - you can still learn java
02:44 - um in the future we'll try to have
02:46 - separate breakout rooms
02:47 - that are like more specifically for ap
02:50 - review and
02:50 - other breakout rooms are that are geared
02:53 - for beginners
02:54 - um and yeah so
02:57 - the general overview of the course is
02:59 - basically
03:01 - um today is just a basic introduction um
03:04 - eventually you'll learn how to like use
03:06 - objects
03:07 - do you like bullying statements um
03:09 - iteration writing classes
03:12 - um we also have one lesson about arrays
03:15 - and working
03:16 - with the raid list um find the
03:18 - inheritance recursion
03:20 - and then a final project just to show
03:23 - um how much you guys have learned um it
03:26 - seems like a lot but
03:27 - don't worry it's these are all um well
03:30 - we'll try our best to like
03:32 - get you guys to learn it um
03:35 - and yeah that's so
03:40 - first off what is java java is
03:43 - a pretty um pretty old programming
03:46 - language
03:46 - originally developed by sun microsystems
03:49 - and now it's being
03:50 - maintained by this company called oracle
03:53 - um
03:54 - it's it ha it's basically a language
03:57 - that's centered around
03:58 - classes so everything in java is
04:01 - basically a class
04:02 - um we'll exp we'll like get to
04:06 - explaining all this later so don't worry
04:07 - if
04:08 - if you're not too sure about it um and
04:11 - because it's
04:12 - a language that is
04:15 - basically all classes it's super good
04:18 - for learning
04:18 - object-oriented programming and java
04:22 - is kind of like the object-oriented
04:24 - language
04:26 - finally java is a compiled language that
04:28 - runs on a java virtual machine
04:30 - which basically means that um in order
04:33 - to
04:33 - run java on your computer you have to
04:36 - download
04:37 - a compiler called a jvm and there are
04:39 - several different versions out there
04:41 - some are free some are paid but um you
04:44 - have to download one of these
04:45 - to be able to run java um because
04:49 - these like these jbms are basically
04:51 - what's going to translate java
04:53 - into something that the computer can
04:55 - read
04:59 - so next um why learn java java
05:02 - is like i said it's the object-oriented
05:05 - programming language
05:06 - so the most important part of why you
05:08 - should learn java is that
05:11 - it's really good for learning the
05:12 - fundamentals of object-oriented
05:14 - programming
05:15 - and this is like a skill and sort of
05:19 - a concept that you you kind of um
05:22 - have to you kind of need to learn other
05:26 - languages too
05:27 - and on a more practical level java is
05:30 - like used to create a lot of things
05:32 - so like there are games that are created
05:35 - in java
05:36 - if i recall correctly minecraft like
05:38 - just recently
05:40 - um refactored
05:43 - their code base to be in java um you can
05:46 - also even like make
05:47 - make mobile apps so a lot of android
05:49 - apps are actually made in java and
05:52 - there's like so much more like you can
05:54 - make entire programs
05:56 - that are really complex just in java
05:58 - itself
05:59 - and finally it's a great beginner
06:01 - language a lot of college courses
06:03 - actually use java as their sort of intro
06:07 - to programming classes
06:08 - so like for for university of maryland
06:11 - um
06:12 - our first language like my first
06:14 - language was actually java
06:16 - and it's compared to like other
06:18 - languages the concepts
06:20 - and like the sort of the skills you need
06:24 - to learn java
06:25 - are pretty low so and so there's first
06:28 - off there's a little barrier of entry
06:30 - and also um there's a lot of really
06:33 - helpful
06:34 - online um resources that you can
06:36 - basically
06:37 - um use if you learn java
06:42 - so for this class um we
06:45 - have we're using this website called
06:47 - roughlit to basically run all our code
06:50 - on
06:50 - so the reason we're using breathlet is
06:52 - that it's very accessible
06:54 - you don't really need like to download
06:56 - anything
06:57 - to use roughly and also um it's pretty
07:00 - easy to like create an account
07:02 - and act get like all the access to a
07:04 - code finally um
07:06 - all all of our demos will be on roughly
07:09 - so it makes it easier for us to share it
07:11 - with you
07:12 - but um if you want to create code
07:14 - locally there are several
07:16 - different um platforms that i can use to
07:18 - develop java
07:20 - um first off you have like for example
07:21 - you have blue jay um
07:23 - intellij idea or vs code um
07:27 - the really big one or the really big ide
07:30 - is eclipse
07:31 - and you also have nothing um again some
07:34 - of these are free some of these not so
07:36 - free but
07:37 - if you're interested in like in
07:40 - sort of being able to save your code to
07:42 - your disk
07:44 - um these are the ides you can look out
07:46 - for
07:49 - so um for today we aren't really gonna
07:52 - have
07:53 - you um do any coding but i'm gonna show
07:56 - you how to make a breathlet account
07:59 - so first off when you go to reflect
08:00 - you're going to see this
08:02 - um you just click on sign up you can log
08:06 - in through like google
08:07 - github or facebook but in case you don't
08:10 - want to
08:15 - you can just make a username
08:18 - enter your email um
08:26 - is a fake email account but it's okay
08:29 - and then um make a password
08:32 - and then just click sign up any
08:38 - questions
08:43 - all right also like again if you guys
08:46 - have any questions about like
08:47 - what i was talking about earlier um feel
08:49 - free to ask
08:54 - all right so let me log into
08:59 - my real wrestling account
09:02 - or my actual roughly account and then
09:04 - i'll also show you guys how to
09:06 - just make a
09:11 - oh what is an id is
09:14 - is an acronym that stands for integrated
09:17 - development
09:18 - environment so it's basically um
09:21 - an app that or a desktop application
09:25 - that allows you to create code so um
09:29 - for example eclipse will
09:32 - allow you to like open a file and
09:35 - basically like
09:36 - create your own java program in like
09:39 - on your own computer instead of like
09:41 - online
09:42 - so you can think about it sort of like
09:45 - um
09:45 - sort of like microsoft word or like
09:47 - microsoft office but for like coding
09:52 - yep so now
09:56 - i'm just going to share my screen again
10:02 - see so now i'm in my own roughly account
10:06 - so if you ever want to create code you
10:08 - can just go to create
10:10 - um sorry click this
10:13 - um plus button you can choose like java
10:16 - i'm going to call this
10:20 - java app
10:23 - press enter and it'll open sort of
10:26 - environment like this
10:28 - where um on the left hand side you have
10:30 - your files on the right this
10:32 - is sort of like where everything will
10:35 - print
10:36 - so this first program
10:40 - is just the hello world program um
10:43 - again like i said java is always like
10:47 - everything in java is a class so even
10:50 - your main function
10:51 - is sort of wrapped in the class called
10:53 - name and in java
10:55 - um you have this really long name
10:57 - function that
10:58 - will explain like what all this means
11:00 - later but right now
11:01 - the main function is public sac boy main
11:04 - string arts
11:06 - and um this is sort of where your
11:08 - program starts
11:10 - so what this program will do is it will
11:12 - just
11:13 - print out hello world and you can test
11:16 - it by clicking run
11:18 - um java will first compile
11:21 - and then after a few seconds
11:24 - it should print out hello world
11:28 - and then over here you have files you
11:30 - can even um
11:31 - like download packages which is pretty
11:33 - cool for roughly
11:35 - and then finally um so for this course
11:39 - we'll be sharing a lot of demo code and
11:42 - just a very important heads up so
11:45 - basically
11:46 - um whenever we share
11:49 - code and you sort of want to put like
11:50 - play with it or change it
11:52 - make sure um you press you click
11:56 - fork before you um do anything with code
12:00 - so um basically
12:03 - make sure you always fork before you
12:06 - like edit any devil code
12:08 - any um questions about that
12:16 - all right
12:23 - so um
12:28 - let me just do this and
12:31 - get back to the presentation
12:37 - so finally i'll just be going over
12:40 - like some tips that i have for just
12:43 - learning a programming language so and
12:47 - um
12:48 - basically in college like you have to
12:51 - it's like in programming in general so
12:54 - what does fourth do
12:56 - fork is basically um it
12:59 - basically will create your own copy of
13:01 - the code
13:02 - so um if i give you like a demo link and
13:06 - you look at it it's sort of like it's
13:08 - kind of like um
13:09 - google docs where we're sort of looking
13:12 - at the same thing
13:13 - so um the issue if you don't work before
13:16 - you change code
13:17 - is like i'll be like doing a demo or
13:19 - something and then
13:21 - if you like delete a line then it'll
13:23 - happen to my code too
13:25 - which can cause a lot of problems or
13:27 - like for example
13:29 - um another teacher might um change
13:32 - the code while i'm typing which will be
13:35 - an issue
13:36 - so basically um what
13:40 - like you should work before you change
13:42 - code so that um
13:44 - anything you change on your side won't
13:46 - um show up on my side
13:48 - so yeah yep
13:52 - um i'm moving on so just like some tips
13:56 - for learning languages
13:57 - um first off practice
14:00 - so um always like
14:04 - when we're we're like going through
14:06 - demos um
14:08 - just play with the code um don't be
14:10 - afraid of breaking anything
14:12 - um so make sure like first off
14:15 - whenever i'm doing demos you know how
14:17 - that code works
14:19 - um second off learn how to start like
14:21 - making your own programs
14:23 - so um fork all the demos and then you
14:27 - can even just like
14:28 - make little changes see what happens
14:31 - um second off google is your friend um
14:35 - don't be afraid of like oh is this
14:37 - cheating or like i can't copy code
14:40 - um just like don't be afraid
14:44 - of just copying other people's code um
14:46 - if you have like if you're running into
14:48 - issues
14:48 - google first um hopefully
14:52 - like especially with java there's really
14:54 - good online support
14:56 - so um if you have an error probably
14:58 - someone else
14:59 - has like has already had that error
15:01 - before and um
15:03 - someone has a solution for it um just
15:06 - like be careful when you're copying code
15:08 - because
15:09 - um don't just copy and paste blindly
15:12 - without understanding
15:13 - what's going on in that code what i find
15:15 - really helpful
15:16 - is that whenever i'm like i see
15:19 - someone's code online and i want to use
15:20 - it
15:21 - i don't just ctrl c ctrl v and call it a
15:24 - i'll actually type it out and just go
15:27 - through their code
15:28 - and try to understand like what's going
15:30 - on and why they like
15:31 - made these decisions um first off like
15:34 - not everyone's code online is perfect
15:36 - there might be some bugs that you can
15:38 - catch and second off
15:40 - it's sort of a learning experience for
15:41 - you so like you can see
15:44 - sort of someone else's logic of why they
15:46 - need code
15:47 - this way um second off this is more of a
15:51 - test taking
15:52 - tip so pay attention to details um
15:56 - i wouldn't call like a lot of questions
15:59 - on exams or trick questions
16:01 - but um there's like a certain logic
16:05 - behind um behind
16:08 - certain pieces of code and if you don't
16:11 - pay attention to small details you might
16:13 - get tripped up
16:15 - um lastly diagrams are very helpful so
16:18 - um when eventually we'll be learning
16:21 - things like
16:22 - about classes subclasses and inheritance
16:25 - um
16:26 - and it's always very helpful to draw
16:27 - class diagrams
16:29 - this is very important especially when
16:31 - we get to like
16:32 - more complex topics like inheritance and
16:35 - polymorphism and stuff like that
16:37 - um that way like that it just allows you
16:41 - to sort of organize everything visually
16:46 - and then finally i'll be posting all
16:47 - these links in chat so don't
16:49 - don't worry about like having these
16:50 - screenshots or anything um
16:52 - these are just a list of resources that
16:55 - we've compiled that
16:57 - um that are things you can refer to to
17:00 - sort of
17:01 - help you learn java first off is
17:04 - geeksforgeeks which is a really good
17:06 - tutorial site
17:07 - and they have really extensive like
17:10 - articles about anything you want to
17:11 - learn in java
17:13 - um second is just a youtube channel with
17:16 - java tutorials um
17:18 - yeah i also have like the college board
17:20 - csa um playlist
17:23 - w3school is kind of like geeks for geeks
17:26 - where it's a bunch of java tutorials
17:28 - um finally like if you want to apply
17:31 - like everything we learned here hacker
17:34 - rank is pretty good
17:35 - for um just doing practice problems also
17:38 - like hacker rank
17:39 - gives you um sort of example interview
17:42 - questions that you might
17:43 - see um when you're trying to like get a
17:46 - job
17:46 - in programming and then also for ap
17:49 - students
17:49 - there's also like whole bunch of
17:51 - examples of frqs and multiple choice
17:58 - questions
18:01 - so any questions about what we just
18:03 - talked about
18:05 - or like anything job related to be
18:07 - honest
18:12 - sweet so oh also
18:15 - i'm gonna first just drop the a discord
18:18 - invite to the girls coded discord
18:20 - that way um if you guys have any
18:22 - questions like outside of class
18:25 - or like uh just about anything
18:28 - um you can just ask us directly on
18:31 - discord
18:32 - so can you tell us some ways people use
18:35 - it
18:35 - applications so um
18:38 - an example of a java application
18:42 - like if you're familiar with minecraft
18:45 - that the entire like people have
18:48 - minecraft is basically coded
18:50 - in java um also
18:54 - a lot of android apps are also in java
18:57 - so
18:57 - um for example
19:00 - i did like uh i did an
19:03 - android app that would basically
19:05 - recognize like facial expressions
19:07 - using computer vision and machine
19:09 - learning and
19:10 - it'll like put an emoji like if you're
19:12 - smiling you'll put a smiling emoji or if
19:14 - you're frowning you'll put an angry
19:16 - emoji
19:17 - um that was all in java
19:20 - um other ways so
19:23 - java has a really strong um
19:26 - uh graphic ui library so like people
19:30 - will make like
19:31 - a lot of people a lot of companies will
19:32 - actually make like internal tools using
19:35 - java so um for example my parents
19:38 - are both computer programmers and they
19:41 - just use java to make a bunch of web
19:43 - apps
19:43 - and and that sort of stuff
19:47 - um and let me think if i'm missing
19:52 - anything else
19:53 - but that's mostly it like it's
19:57 - mostly used for like a lot of internal
19:59 - schools for companies
20:00 - um android development
20:03 - is both in java and kotlin um
20:07 - also yeah and even like games like
20:11 - minecraft
20:13 - do you need to know javascript to know
20:15 - java
20:16 - no you don't need like any you don't
20:19 - need to know any other language you know
20:21 - java
20:22 - and that's actually like what's so great
20:24 - about java is that like
20:26 - you don't need any uh like prior
20:28 - programming experience or anything
20:30 - to learn be able to learn java i would
20:33 - actually say that you need to know
20:34 - a little bit of java to know javascript
20:37 - because javascript is a scripting
20:39 - language that's based on java
20:42 - so i would say like more like the other
20:44 - way around than like
20:52 - and then i'm gonna start dropping the
20:55 - um resources links in chat um
20:58 - feel free to like just ask any questions
21:02 - or or like any of that while i'm
21:06 - dropping these all right oh yeah finally
21:09 - um
21:11 - for this class we also have a feedback
21:14 - board
21:16 - that it's like if you want to fill out
21:19 - it's really important that like me and
21:22 - like the rest of teachers know like
21:23 - how we're doing so that we can sort of
21:26 - adjust our teaching styles so that you
21:28 - can learn the most
21:30 - so please fill out the um feedback form
21:32 - otherwise
21:33 - um let me just show this
21:40 - otherwise we also have um a website
21:44 - girlsquoted.org
