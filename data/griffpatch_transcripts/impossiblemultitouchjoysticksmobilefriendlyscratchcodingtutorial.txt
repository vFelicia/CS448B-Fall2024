00:00 - foreign
00:03 - scratchers
00:04 - everyone knows multi-touch joysticks are
00:07 - not possible in scratch right well
00:10 - that's what I thought until a scratcher
00:12 - named Alexandra Varian shared with me a
00:15 - clever trick that simply blew me away
00:17 - yes here I am scratching on my phone
00:20 - left them on a thumbstick and
00:22 - simultaneously able to click with my
00:24 - right thumb what witchcraft is this I
00:27 - kid you not this is native scratch can
00:30 - you imagine the possibilities whether
00:31 - you want to move and jump or move and
00:34 - shoot or perform those impossible
00:35 - ceiling crouches in apple well that is
00:38 - exactly what we've been waiting for want
00:41 - to know how this works then keep
00:43 - watching first we'll explain the basics
00:45 - and then we'll build a working
00:47 - backpackable multi-touch joystick of
00:49 - your own all ready to drop into your
00:52 - best games so cool the best way to
00:55 - explain this Wizardry is to look at
00:56 - exactly how scratch handles mobile
00:58 - clicks and drags this little script will
01:01 - do the job it just continually moves the
01:04 - cat's Sprite to the mouse pointer and
01:06 - says whether the mouse button is down
01:08 - with a true or false otherwise if I tap
01:11 - the screen with my finger scratch tweets
01:13 - this as a mouse click true and Scratchy
01:17 - follows my finger wherever it may go
01:18 - take my finger off the screen and
01:20 - Scratchy says false
01:22 - well that is all as we would expect but
01:26 - here comes a problem a second touch on
01:28 - the screen neither changes the cat's
01:30 - position or affects the mouse down state
01:33 - it still reports true as it did before
01:35 - so the second touch was completely
01:38 - undetectable bummer but wait this is
01:42 - weird having released the second touch I
01:44 - can keep dragging the cat around but the
01:47 - cat is reporting false even though our
01:49 - first finger never left the screen it
01:51 - appears scratch only reports the last
01:53 - change of any touch whether pressing or
01:56 - releasing in which case yes from now on
02:01 - as long as we keep holding the first
02:02 - finger to the screen we can measure the
02:04 - movements of the first touch with the
02:06 - mouse x y and the clicking of the screen
02:09 - with the mouse down it's that simple
02:12 - that's not to say there are still a few
02:15 - hurdles to make this work smoothly like
02:17 - how to deal with that pesky first failed
02:19 - click and how to detect when the player
02:22 - releases are some stick but honestly
02:24 - these little problems are what makes
02:26 - coding really fun guys enough talk
02:29 - already let's get scratching
02:32 - oh no there's a most dangerous and
02:35 - horrible looking Chasm here and we need
02:37 - to get scratch cat across in safety so
02:39 - we need some control mechanism make a
02:42 - new Sprite naming it stick we are going
02:45 - to Define both keyboard and touching
02:47 - controls all in one place to make our
02:50 - life simpler when green flag clicked go
02:53 - to front this is more important than you
02:56 - might imagine the Sprite at the front
02:58 - will begin running its scripts first so
03:01 - if we want our keyboard and mobile
03:03 - controls to not lag a frame behind the
03:05 - action then we need this to run as soon
03:08 - as possible
03:09 - now we'll repeat forever okay we need a
03:12 - variable stick X for all Sprites we'll
03:16 - detect the use of the keyboard first but
03:18 - don't fear the mobile controls are
03:20 - coming momentarily so stick around and
03:23 - we set stick X to key right crest
03:26 - subtract key left pressed
03:32 - if we run the project you can see that
03:34 - this already reports as one for right
03:36 - and -1 for left zero for nothing being
03:39 - pressed at all that is funky but what if
03:42 - we want more key combinations like the
03:45 - wasd too well no problem we just place
03:48 - the right key check in an or block along
03:51 - with a test for the D key but gosh the
03:54 - length of this script is getting quickly
03:56 - out of hand so let's break the maths up
03:58 - using a set block followed by a change
04:01 - buy block
04:03 - first we set stick x to the right hand
04:05 - key values and then we change the same
04:08 - stick X by the negative value of the
04:11 - left hand key presses yeah that wants to
04:14 - be an or too for the left Arrow or the a
04:17 - key
04:18 - great does that make sense I hope so
04:21 - because now we do the same for stick y
04:24 - make sure to create that for all Sprites
04:27 - too and we want to set stick y
04:31 - to the up Arrow
04:33 - or W key
04:35 - and change stick y by the down arrow
04:39 - or S key
04:41 - perfect time to give that a test just to
04:44 - confirm that stick X and stick y
04:46 - variables are reporting ones zeros and
04:48 - minus ones as appropriate for all the
04:50 - arrow keys and the wasd key combinations
04:53 - that we wanted
04:55 - cool so just one more stick variable to
04:58 - add and that is the awesome stick button
05:01 - for all Sprites and oh boy this is the
05:04 - one we are so excited to have in a
05:06 - mobile compatible control scheme use an
05:09 - if else checking for whether the space
05:11 - key is pressed then if it's not pressed
05:14 - we'll start there set the stick button
05:17 - to zero it's not pressed but if it's
05:20 - pressed then interestingly perhaps drop
05:22 - in a change stick button by one
05:26 - right now if we run the game you'll find
05:28 - holding down the space key causes the
05:31 - stick button to go crazy when our game
05:34 - is fleshed out a little more this will
05:36 - increase by one every game frame but at
05:38 - the present there's nothing to stop it
05:40 - changing as fast as it likes which is
05:42 - very fast indeed great we have a basic
05:46 - keyboard control scheme before we add
05:48 - Mobile support let's link this up to
05:51 - control R scratch cat
05:53 - so in the scratch cat Sprite when flag
05:56 - clicked position the player at the
05:59 - starting position
06:00 - then in a forever Loop change their X
06:03 - position by
06:05 - 8 multiplied by
06:08 - our stick X variable left or right
06:12 - and in the same way change y by six
06:16 - multiplied by
06:18 - stick y so they will travel a little
06:21 - slower up and down that's why it's six
06:23 - rather than eight
06:25 - give that a test
06:27 - Splendid that works great and on a side
06:31 - note see how stick button is now
06:33 - increasing much slower I told you that
06:35 - would happen right how about we hook
06:38 - this up to make a jump
06:40 - when green flag clicked forever
06:43 - and we simply wait until
06:47 - stick button
06:50 - is equal to one
06:53 - if we used a greater than zero then the
06:55 - cat would keep jumping over and over but
06:58 - by saying equals one it will only jump
07:00 - the first time the key is held down then
07:03 - switch to a jumping costume
07:05 - repeat ten times
07:08 - changing y by 10 to jump upwards and
07:12 - then back to costume one
07:14 - repeating 10 times back down again with
07:17 - a change y by negative 10. cool give
07:21 - that another go jump jump jump jump
07:25 - oh boy this game will be on trending in
07:28 - no time but enough what about the Mobile
07:31 - touch good point click back into this
07:35 - sticks right and let's do this this is
07:38 - all keyboard code let's Shuffle it off
07:40 - into a custom block naming it keyboard
07:42 - controls run without screen refresh and
07:46 - move everything inside the forever Loop
07:48 - into this new Define block next up we'll
07:51 - draw our joystick bass costume a black
07:54 - circle holding shift while drawing to
07:57 - keep it a perfect circle and we want it
07:59 - around 100 by 100 pixels wide or just a
08:03 - little over is fine the great thing
08:04 - about sizing to 100 pixels is that when
08:07 - we size the costume to 100 in the code
08:09 - it will be a hundred pixels wide and if
08:13 - it was 50 it will be 50 pixels wide that
08:16 - makes working with sizes much easier
08:19 - then using the selection tool snap the
08:21 - shape to the middle of the costume
08:23 - canvas that's really important perfect
08:26 - if you want to decorate it further then
08:28 - be my guest I'm going to name this
08:31 - costume base
08:34 - next drag it on the stage to where you
08:36 - want it to sit bottom left is generally
08:38 - a good fit now before we begin looping
08:41 - let's set the stick up correctly the
08:43 - thumbstick is a little big for my taste
08:45 - at present so size it to 80 percent
08:48 - and user set goat effect to as much as
08:51 - 80 percent to fade it nicely out so as
08:54 - it's not too distracting
08:57 - yeah I like that now in that forever
09:00 - Loop we'll position the sticks bright
09:01 - with a go to XY and then drop in a
09:05 - switch costume to base perfect okay
09:09 - we'll need to know the range of movement
09:11 - our stick has from the center to the
09:13 - edge
09:14 - to make a new variable for this named
09:17 - range for this Sprite only and we'll set
09:20 - range to the Sprite size reporter
09:23 - divided by
09:28 - 2.5 now dividing by 2 would take us
09:32 - right to the very edge but we want to
09:34 - stop the stick just a little bit before
09:36 - that so two and a half it is join these
09:40 - scripts backup and we are ready to talk
09:42 - about touch interactions
09:44 - so until someone actually touches the
09:47 - screen we want to allow the previous
09:48 - keyboard controls to function therefore
09:51 - we'll repeat until the mouse is down
09:58 - and until it is we'll keep running the
10:01 - keyboard controls block
10:03 - if we give that a test you'll find the
10:05 - keyboard controls are still working fine
10:07 - great but this mouse down check alone
10:10 - doesn't guarantee this was a fresh click
10:12 - or touch of it we need to ensure the
10:14 - mouse wasn't already down beforehand so
10:17 - duplicate that repeat until block and
10:19 - change the first one to repeat until the
10:22 - mouse is not down
10:24 - better that means the second repeat will
10:27 - always detect a fresh new click next up
10:30 - we don't want to activate the stick if
10:32 - we are not clicking somewhere nearby so
10:35 - check if the distance from this Sprite
10:38 - to the mouse pointer
10:39 - is less than
10:44 - the size of the Sprite
10:46 - and then make a new custom block for
10:49 - this naming it stick activated and do we
10:52 - run without screen refresh no no we do
10:55 - not leave it unchecked because we are
10:58 - expecting this script to run until we
11:00 - finish moving the thumbstick around
11:02 - definitely longer than one game tick
11:04 - cool drop that into the last if
11:08 - now I'll just reposition these scripts
11:10 - so that we can see the main script and
11:12 - the stick activated script together
11:14 - there we go so to begin with the stick
11:18 - will stay active until we release the
11:20 - mouse button repeat until not Mouse down
11:24 - and while it is active we set stick X to
11:28 - and we want the distance between the
11:30 - mouse pointer and the middle of the
11:32 - sticks bright so that's Mouse X subtract
11:36 - X position
11:38 - the position of our Sprite
11:40 - but a heads up that distance can be a
11:43 - large number and we really want it to
11:45 - have a range from negative one to one
11:48 - like our keyboard joystick did so we
11:51 - have to divide the Distance by and here
11:53 - we go our range variable
11:58 - cool do the same for the stick y
12:03 - with the mouse y subtract
12:05 - y position that's still divided by range
12:09 - and hurray because that is surprisingly
12:12 - the basis for a Simple Touch stick
12:14 - control smash the green flag and check
12:17 - this out
12:18 - I can click and drag on the base control
12:21 - and our cap moves perfectly in sync with
12:23 - our directions it also has the benefit
12:26 - of being analog that is we can request
12:29 - slow or fast movements rather than the
12:32 - keyboards either on or off digital
12:34 - approach
12:35 - which by the way still works very well
12:37 - while I'm not using the mouse which is
12:40 - awesome because our scratch cap player
12:42 - Sprite only needs to look at stick X and
12:45 - Y and yet both arrow keys
12:47 - wasd and touch control systems are
12:50 - catered For man that's cool what a Time
12:53 - Saver now we do have one problem we can
12:56 - still drag our Mouse way off the base
12:59 - area and this causes our stick X and Y
13:01 - to exceed the intended minus one to one
13:03 - limit no problem if
13:07 - greater than
13:08 - and we'll use the ABS value of stick X
13:12 - this means the absolute value of and it
13:15 - simply flips any negative numbers to
13:17 - positive ones
13:18 - and we check whether that's greater than
13:20 - one
13:21 - and that will therefore be true for
13:23 - numbers less than negative one as well
13:26 - now to set stick X back to one or's
13:29 - minus one we divide stick X by the ABS
13:33 - of stick X you see any number divided by
13:36 - itself is one but since we have an ABS
13:39 - here little trick negative numbers end
13:42 - up as negative one instead which is
13:44 - exactly what we want perfect let's do
13:47 - this again for stick y
13:51 - stick y stick Y and stick y
13:55 - giving that another test
13:57 - and yeah that's what we wanted stick X
14:00 - and Y are maxing out at one this is
14:03 - great for platform games but a little
14:06 - different from my crazy cool joysticks
14:08 - tutorial which is still around if you
14:10 - want to see it where we limited the
14:11 - movement to a circle each has their pros
14:15 - and cons and we can do either now this
14:18 - part is almost done and I'm desperate to
14:20 - get onto the multi-touch but just before
14:22 - we do have you noticed that when we
14:25 - first touch the stick it's really hard
14:27 - to begin dead center and as a
14:29 - consequence our player starts moving
14:31 - around right away this can be very
14:33 - frustrating and can lead to you losing a
14:35 - life in a real game so watch this drop a
14:39 - go to Mouse pointer at the top of this
14:42 - stick activated script
14:44 - and now when we run the project the
14:47 - first touch teleports the stick base to
14:49 - our Mouse pointer and thus we always
14:51 - begin dead center this prevents any
14:53 - undesired movement and now that is funky
14:56 - and literally a lifesaver on mobile
14:59 - cool because we can now finally look at
15:02 - adding that multi-touch support oh yeah
15:05 - to make sure we know what scripts do
15:07 - what pull out all the stick movement
15:10 - code and make a new custom block to
15:12 - house it in name it detect stick
15:15 - movement and this time we can run
15:17 - without screen refresh
15:20 - yeah drop it back in the forever Loop
15:24 - and now make another new block this time
15:26 - named detect stick button crazy drop it
15:31 - in right after the stick movement Block
15:33 - in the same Loop
15:35 - so basically we need an if else
15:38 - and we'll be looking for the mouse down
15:40 - state
15:41 - and when it's not down in the else we
15:44 - set stick button to zero and just like
15:48 - for the keyboard version when the mouse
15:49 - is down we change stick button by one
15:52 - but this isn't going to work is it
15:55 - because if we run the project the first
15:57 - click to use our stick also triggers a
16:00 - mouse down jump oh man this is our first
16:02 - problem well then we must ignore the
16:06 - first click and not jump we can do this
16:08 - with a variable latch set stick button
16:12 - to the empty value as soon as the stick
16:15 - is activated but before the repeat Loop
16:18 - begins this empty value is our latch
16:21 - value then in the detect stick button
16:24 - script we want to wait until the latch
16:26 - is removed by releasing the mouse and
16:28 - setting stick button to zero here
16:31 - therefore don't set button to 1 until
16:34 - stick button is not an empty value but
16:38 - don't Yes you heard me correctly I have
16:40 - made a mistake while recording this
16:42 - works as equal to zero but really it
16:45 - should be greater than the empty value
16:47 - otherwise it will stop at one and that
16:50 - the change will never increase any
16:51 - further let's give this a test and this
16:54 - time I'm going to switch to testing on
16:56 - my mobile phone you can see my touch is
16:59 - highlighted as little white circles well
17:02 - the initial click of the stick no longer
17:04 - triggers a false jump but as soon as we
17:06 - tap the screen with a second touch all
17:09 - that happens is the first touch ends and
17:11 - we are no longer registering a usable
17:13 - joystick quite the step backwards really
17:15 - the reason of course is that when the
17:18 - second touch ends our Mouse down also
17:20 - ends even though one finger is still
17:22 - touching the screen only the last touch
17:24 - or release updates the mouse down
17:26 - reporter so we no longer use the mouse
17:29 - down here
17:31 - and instead we repeat until the distance
17:34 - to the mouse pointer is greater than
17:38 - and we'll use a size multiplied by 1.5 I
17:43 - want an even larger active drag zone
17:45 - around the stick before it deactivates
17:48 - right this might feel a little odd to
17:51 - begin with but let's see this in action
17:54 - I'll try to hold our cat still and then
17:56 - tap with my second finger and as
17:59 - expected the second touch just unlatches
18:01 - the stick button to zero without a jump
18:04 - click again and we jump and we can keep
18:08 - jumping with more touches this is
18:10 - amazing look at me go I really didn't
18:13 - think this would be possible in Native
18:15 - scratch wow but there are problems if I
18:20 - just let go of the left stick
18:22 - scratch doesn't notice and it keeps on
18:25 - assuming the stick is held in the same
18:27 - position to cancel it we need to click
18:29 - on the screen again or drag the joystick
18:32 - far out of its active Zone
18:34 - feels weird at first but you soon get
18:37 - used to it and the point is we have
18:40 - actually done it this is now a fully
18:42 - working backpackable multi-touch
18:44 - joystick and once your fingers are on
18:46 - the screen it's just so easy to control
18:48 - it's just lacking a whole lot of Polish
18:51 - like a visual stick to move around and a
18:54 - clickable button but one little snag
18:58 - before we do have you noticed how tricky
19:00 - it is to keep the player still in the
19:03 - past we could just release the stick but
19:05 - now we need to keep contact so we really
19:08 - need a so-called Dead Zone in the Middle
19:10 - where no movement occurs this can either
19:13 - be done in the stick script or in the
19:16 - player scripts so your choice really I'm
19:18 - going to do it right in my player before
19:20 - we change X by wrap that in an if and
19:24 - check that the absolute the ABS of stick
19:26 - X is greater than some low threshold say
19:29 - 0.3
19:31 - the same can be done for stick y
19:35 - right smash that green flag The Dead
19:38 - Zone gives us a little more confidence
19:40 - that we can keep our player still
19:42 - without having to lift our finger off
19:43 - the screen nice job to top it off we can
19:46 - then stuff a pointing Direction into the
19:49 - change X and set direction to stick X as
19:52 - long as we've set the direction mode of
19:53 - scratch e to Left Right only that is and
19:56 - then this will let them face the way
19:58 - they moved well they will be pleased and
20:01 - so am I that looks World better oh wait
20:04 - I do believe I have a problem I'm seeing
20:07 - my cat begin bouncing up and down over
20:10 - and over again when I hold down the
20:11 - button as far as I was aware this should
20:14 - never occur due to the cat only jumping
20:16 - when stick button was equal to one but
20:19 - as you can see my stick button is equal
20:22 - to one and that is wrong yeah that was
20:25 - down to that previous bug remember where
20:27 - I should have checked that stick button
20:29 - was greater than the empty value
20:31 - otherwise this change stick button only
20:34 - runs once and never increases greater
20:36 - than one
20:38 - test that again and view bug squashed a
20:42 - jump is now only triggered by the first
20:45 - click but for the icing on the cake
20:47 - we'll now give our multi-touch stick a
20:49 - facelift for we are missing that iconic
20:53 - draggable Central's control stick in the
20:56 - costume editor duplicate base naming it
20:58 - bass active and then click back into the
21:02 - first base costume
21:04 - and add a new white circle making it
21:07 - much smaller than the first and snap it
21:09 - again to the center I think that looks
21:12 - pretty good don't you
21:13 - but so that we can drag the middle
21:15 - around on screen duplicate this costume
21:18 - again and delete the outer circles
21:20 - entirely this costume will now name
21:23 - stick
21:25 - so when we run the project we start with
21:28 - a combined stick costume so now as the
21:31 - stick is activated we must separate the
21:32 - stick from the base using a clone
21:35 - after going to the mouse pointer switch
21:38 - to the stick costume
21:43 - and create a clone of myself
21:46 - so with the Clone made we switch our
21:48 - main Sprites costume back to the Base
21:50 - active costume the one without the stick
21:53 - join the scripts back together however
21:55 - because we are generating a clone we
21:57 - must also ensure we delete that clone
21:59 - when the drag is finished for that will
22:01 - end with a broadcast and the new message
22:05 - deactivate stick
22:07 - and it will be very simple when I
22:09 - receive deactivate stick
22:11 - delete this clone now to get the Clone
22:15 - moving along with our touches
22:18 - when I start as a clone I will ensure
22:21 - this is the stick by saying if costume
22:25 - name equals stick
22:27 - we start by going forward by one layer
22:30 - all clones begin behind the original
22:32 - Sprite and we want this stick to be in
22:34 - front of the base
22:35 - then set ghost effect to zero so that
22:38 - the drag stick is nice and bright
22:41 - a forever loop at least until the Clone
22:43 - is deleted and now we want to set the
22:46 - thumbstick's position to the same as the
22:48 - base we need a trick to get scratch to
22:50 - do this click into the player Sprite
22:53 - temporarily and now drag in a new go to
22:56 - stick block
22:57 - this we then proceed to drop back into
23:00 - the stick Sprite
23:02 - we can get rid of this one
23:04 - then back in our stick scripts we can
23:06 - pop that block into our waiting forever
23:09 - Loop nice next we simply need to offset
23:12 - this by stick X and stick y using our
23:15 - change X and change y by blocks just
23:19 - remember to multiply stick X by range to
23:21 - reflect the full movement the same
23:24 - applies to stick y
23:28 - cool smash the green flag and you should
23:32 - find that activating the stick produces
23:33 - a bright white handle that we can move
23:36 - freely around and yet it's constrained
23:38 - to the stick base perfect
23:41 - so then the last upgrade will add is a
23:44 - nice multi-touch button with a helpful
23:46 - click to activate message to let people
23:48 - know what to do next back in the costume
23:52 - editor then
23:53 - duplicate The Base active costume and
23:56 - write in white click to
23:59 - and with another text element activate I
24:02 - do it in two parts so that I can Center
24:04 - align each one independently
24:06 - finally I'll add a little arrow pointing
24:09 - down at the button to draw attention to
24:11 - it
24:12 - give the costume a name I'm calling mine
24:14 - ready okay back in the code we need the
24:18 - stick activated script
24:20 - and where we were already creating the
24:22 - stick clone we are now going to also
24:24 - switch costume to ready and again create
24:27 - a clone make sure to drop these in
24:30 - before switching costume to stick order
24:33 - is often more important than you might
24:35 - imagine and this will ensure the stick
24:38 - will still go in front of the base
24:40 - Sprite
24:41 - cool then we need to look at the when I
24:44 - started clone block next we already
24:46 - handled the stick clone here so the
24:49 - button clone will be handled below this
24:51 - if
24:52 - and we want to position this button on
24:55 - the right hand over here drop in a go to
24:58 - XY block and we'll flip the X position
25:00 - with a negative value to a positive one
25:03 - 174 in my case that should be enough for
25:06 - us to already run the project and check
25:08 - out the basic positioning
25:10 - the new button only appears when we
25:12 - click down on the stick like so and oh
25:15 - that looks good yeah and then when we
25:17 - release the joystick it disappears again
25:19 - this is good because it helps the player
25:21 - to understand how this button is to be
25:23 - used
25:24 - so now we want to change the costume
25:26 - once the button is activated
25:28 - so wait until the mouse is not down not
25:32 - Mouse down and switch to the Base active
25:35 - costume that's the one without a stick
25:38 - in the middle
25:39 - testing again and you can see that the
25:42 - first click now clears the click to
25:44 - activate message wow not much more to do
25:47 - than that but perhaps having the button
25:49 - darken as we click it would be nice so
25:52 - forever
25:54 - if else
25:56 - checking if Mouse down
25:58 - then set goes to vect 225
26:02 - otherwise set ghost effect to 75 or 80.
26:06 - okay let's do this run the project again
26:09 - this time on my phone so that you can
26:11 - see how it finally looks left thumb on
26:14 - the stick and the click to activate
26:16 - message appears so click that button and
26:19 - it activates and then we can click again
26:21 - to jump oh yes that is so cool I'm
26:25 - loving how it looks and it works just so
26:28 - well what more is there to say except
26:30 - how about we try backpacking the sticks
26:33 - bright and adding it to our classic
26:35 - platformer game
26:37 - so here we go dropping it right in
26:42 - and we need to click the player Sprite
26:44 - and find the Define controls left and
26:46 - right script here are the left and right
26:49 - arrow key press blocks and we'll pull
26:51 - these out and simply replace them with
26:53 - our stick X variable the check below is
26:56 - looking for when the key is not pressed
26:58 - but we really need one of those Dead
27:00 - Zone checks for this joystick so use the
27:03 - ABS value of key X and check that it's
27:05 - less than 0.3
27:08 - that replaces the key equals zero
27:11 - next find the Define control up and down
27:14 - I'm going to replace the key up check
27:16 - here with a check for stick button
27:20 - greater than
27:21 - zero if you like you could use an or
27:24 - here and also check for the stick y
27:26 - equals one for jumping with the up Arrow
27:28 - key anyhow I think that is enough to
27:32 - give this a try let's do this on my
27:34 - phone again
27:36 - and I have to say this game feels a lot
27:38 - more natural with this new control
27:40 - scheme
27:41 - let's see if I can make it through the
27:43 - level
27:45 - wow I cannot wait to see the projects
27:48 - you guys add this control stick to as
27:51 - always there's a studio Linked In the
