00:02 - hello fellow scratchers what better way
00:05 - to enhance our classic platformers than
00:07 - to introduce enemies into the fray you
00:09 - may recognize this little red chomping
00:11 - fellow from my apple game the great
00:13 - thing about enemies is that unlike
00:15 - spikes or lava enemies tend to be a lot
00:17 - more dynamic bringing the level to life
00:19 - and also requiring more skill to avoid
00:22 - or to take out
00:24 - so we'll be adding simple enemy spawning
00:26 - movement gravity incline traversal and
00:29 - finally the ability to squish an enemy
00:31 - by jumping on his head classic stuff
00:33 - indeed so what are we waiting for let's
00:37 - get scratching we begin where we left
00:39 - off in episode 10 saving our project as
00:42 - a new copy for this is episode 11.
00:47 - so i'm thinking to place the first enemy
00:49 - down here on the first scene
00:52 - it'll be best to make a new sprite for
00:54 - the enemy and i'll name it enemy makes
00:57 - sense
00:59 - for fun i'm drawing the little red enemy
01:02 - dude from apple begin by drawing a
01:05 - simple square
01:06 - now we can check the size looks good on
01:08 - the stage view
01:10 - and we can also drag them into a
01:11 - suitable space while we're at it
01:13 - when you design an enemy remember to
01:16 - always draw them facing to the right
01:19 - even if you want them to face left or
01:21 - rotate to fly upwards it really doesn't
01:22 - matter we still draw them facing right
01:25 - always
01:27 - then once you have them drawn just
01:30 - double check that the costume is
01:31 - centered on the canvas i do that by
01:34 - selecting the whole thing and then
01:36 - dragging them to the middle where they
01:38 - should just snap into place there you
01:40 - see if your costume is not centered in
01:43 - the costume editor then its position and
01:45 - collision sensing gets way messed up and
01:48 - in turn that causes bugs later on so you
01:50 - really want to get this centering step
01:53 - mastered
01:54 - right let's give this enemy costume a
01:57 - name
01:57 - red one
01:59 - i use a one because next up we are going
02:01 - to add more costumes for simple enemy
02:03 - animation i want them to open and close
02:06 - their mouth
02:07 - so duplicate red one costume and now we
02:10 - have a red two
02:11 - select the entire top half of the
02:13 - costume rotate it and move it back into
02:16 - place
02:17 - nice
02:18 - we then do the same again duplicating
02:20 - red two
02:21 - and we widen the mouth further still
02:24 - brilliant
02:25 - to complete the animation we need the
02:26 - mouth to begin to close once more
02:29 - simplest way to achieve this is to cheat
02:31 - and duplicate costume 2 again dragging
02:34 - them to the bottom of the list now we
02:36 - have the costumes in animating order
02:38 - from closed to open and then beginning
02:41 - to close once more ready to loop back
02:43 - around to fully closed and then to
02:46 - repeat
02:47 - excellent we just need one more costume
02:50 - and that is for when red gets squashed
02:53 - duplicate costume one and drag it down
02:55 - to the bottom of the list
02:57 - i think we should name it red squish
03:01 - then just flatten the costume by
03:03 - selecting it all and dragging from the
03:05 - top downwards this ensures the bottom
03:07 - won't lift off the ground
03:09 - you might also like to pull out the
03:11 - sides a bit to give that extra squished
03:13 - look
03:14 - if you hold down the alt key while
03:16 - dragging then it sizes around its middle
03:19 - which is extra useful here
03:21 - super right costumes are done it's time
03:25 - to do some coding
03:26 - we've used a number of methods to bring
03:28 - sprites into the game the collectibles
03:31 - were clones that we spawned across the
03:33 - entire level right at the beginning the
03:35 - lifts and danger sprites well they
03:37 - weren't clones but instead have one
03:39 - sprite that we reused on each scene
03:41 - where needed
03:43 - but for enemies we will do something a
03:45 - little different again
03:47 - using clones that would allow us to have
03:49 - more than one enemy per scene i like
03:51 - that but to avoid building up loads of
03:53 - clones and any overheads that that might
03:56 - bring will only spawn them when needed
03:59 - and despawn them again when we leave a
04:01 - scene
04:02 - so as normal when working with clones
04:05 - the original sprite should be hidden
04:07 - when flag clicked
04:09 - hide
04:10 - let's work on enemy spawning they will
04:13 - appear when we enter a scene so
04:15 - when i receive change scene
04:19 - then check which scene we entered if
04:21 - scene equals one
04:29 - okay so the player has entered scene one
04:32 - we want to clone a new red enemy
04:35 - drag in a go to xy block
04:38 - okay hold on i actually want to move
04:40 - them further to the right over here
04:42 - now remove that block and drag in a new
04:45 - one
04:46 - that way it's all set with the x and y
04:48 - values for the new position
04:51 - next up we want to face left with a
04:54 - point in direction negative 90.
04:57 - cool that's the basics so we can go
05:00 - ahead and create a clone of myself
05:03 - that will ensure that the new clone is
05:04 - created positioned and orientated just
05:07 - as we want but just like the original
05:09 - sprite it too will start hidden
05:13 - easy to fix bring in a when i start as
05:16 - clone hat block
05:18 - and show
05:21 - nice and simple let's give it a test
05:24 - just click play
05:26 - oh man what
05:28 - red what are you doing upside down man
05:31 - obviously the rotation mode of this
05:34 - sprite is not set correctly we'll
05:36 - address this under the when green flag
05:38 - clicked hat
05:40 - pop in a set rotation mode
05:43 - to left right
05:45 - that should stop the sprite appearing
05:46 - upside down and limit it to only
05:49 - flipping left and right
05:51 - okay much better the enemy spawning is
05:54 - working but if we move on to the next
05:56 - scene
05:57 - ah the enemy is still here we need to
06:00 - ensure we despawn them again as we leave
06:03 - a scene
06:06 - now we have a number of options of how
06:08 - to do this we already have the when
06:11 - scene changed event that triggers when
06:14 - we move off a scene and enter a new one
06:16 - but to make things really clear and easy
06:19 - to follow i suggest we add a new event
06:22 - that runs before this one for leaving a
06:24 - scene
06:26 - for this we should click into the player
06:28 - sprite
06:30 - and we need to find the define begin
06:32 - scene scripts
06:34 - this is where we are broadcasting the
06:36 - change scene event
06:38 - we now want another broadcast before
06:40 - this one so separate off the stop block
06:43 - duplicate the broadcast and join it all
06:46 - back together next we'll change the
06:49 - first broadcast to send out a new
06:51 - message
06:53 - now in retrospect i think a better name
06:55 - for this might have been leave or exit
06:58 - scene but i gave it the name
07:01 - about to change scene of course it
07:03 - really doesn't matter but do feel free
07:05 - to name it whatever you like
07:07 - okay so back to the enemy sprite
07:10 - we can now bring in a when i receive
07:13 - about to change scene
07:15 - and to remove all the enemy clones is
07:17 - now easy just delete this clone
07:21 - cool
07:22 - now the begin scene event can safely run
07:24 - and everything should be good
07:26 - shall we test
07:31 - yeah the enemy clones are gone
07:35 - so what next
07:37 - well this enemy is looking a bit floaty
07:40 - shall we add in some gravity to bring
07:42 - them down to the ground
07:44 - make sure we are still in the enemy
07:46 - sprite and will continue coding in the
07:49 - when start as clone script
07:51 - they need their own little game loop so
07:54 - bring in a forever block
07:56 - for gravity we need a speed y variable
07:59 - make it for this sprite only as each
08:01 - clone needs its own speed
08:04 - initialize speed y to zero
08:07 - just before the forever loop begins
08:11 - gravity is simply a constant force
08:14 - pulling downwards so we change our speed
08:16 - y by a pull of negative one each game
08:19 - tick
08:21 - then actually move the enemy with a
08:23 - change y by
08:25 - and drop in the speed y variable yeah
08:28 - you'll see this a bazillion times in all
08:30 - our games but this is not enough as if
08:33 - right now the falling enemy falls
08:35 - straight through the level we need to
08:37 - stop them but as lifting them out of the
08:39 - floor requires a bit of extra looping
08:42 - we'll need that custom block magic make
08:45 - a new custom block naming it move
08:48 - down
08:49 - and yes tick the run without screen
08:51 - refresh block we need it okay we will
08:55 - move the gravity code into this new
08:57 - custom block and replace it with a move
08:59 - down
09:00 - great
09:01 - so now
09:03 - if after moving the enemy down here we
09:05 - find we are overlapping that is touching
09:08 - the level we want to move the enemy back
09:11 - up again until they are not touching the
09:13 - level
09:15 - simplest way to do this is with a repeat
09:17 - until block and we repeat until we are
09:20 - not touching
09:23 - the level
09:25 - okay so after we've moved down if they
09:28 - are not touching the level then this
09:30 - repeat doesn't even run
09:33 - but if they are then we repeatedly
09:35 - change y by one to bring them up until
09:39 - they are again no longer touching the
09:41 - level
09:42 - sweet we just need to reset the full
09:44 - speed by setting their speed y to zero
09:48 - and that's it testing the project now
09:51 - shows the enemy is nicely grounded
09:54 - if i go back to the project view then i
09:56 - can drag them around and they always
09:58 - fall back to the ground excellent we are
10:00 - ready to move on
10:02 - in fact moving on is exactly what we
10:04 - want this enemy to do so a new custom
10:07 - block for this to match the move down
10:09 - one name it move
10:11 - left and right
10:13 - tick to run without screen refresh
10:16 - and it would be best to make use of this
10:18 - before the move down block i think
10:22 - so assuming the enemy is facing left or
10:25 - right let's use the move block
10:28 - and move two steps forward
10:31 - then we check for collisions
10:34 - we may have hit a wall right so if
10:37 - touching
10:38 - level
10:40 - then we move back out of the wall with a
10:42 - move minus two steps negative two steps
10:46 - and then we just turn them around to
10:48 - walk back the opposite direction turn
10:50 - clockwise by 180 degrees
10:53 - it's testing time here we go the enemy
10:56 - is coming this way they hit the wall
10:59 - turn around and walk off and oh
11:02 - they appear to be sulking at the edge of
11:04 - the level like one of my pet totes they
11:07 - also bury their heads in the ground and
11:09 - pretend not to be there yep we can see
11:11 - you red
11:13 - well we can choose here to do one of two
11:15 - things either they walk off the screen
11:18 - or they turn around and come back
11:20 - i say we turn them around so instead of
11:23 - just checking touching level we need an
11:25 - ore block and also check for touching
11:28 - edge that is the edge of the screen
11:32 - now when we test the game
11:34 - the enemy also turns when they reach the
11:36 - edge of the screen too
11:38 - perfect this is looking really good but
11:41 - you know often when you draw levels in
11:43 - scratch surfaces are not perfectly
11:46 - straight and if i was to introduce a
11:49 - small bump into the level
11:51 - i think we will find that the enemy can
11:53 - be thwarted all too easily
11:57 - what we need to do is let them have a
11:59 - little bit of lift to get them over
12:00 - these small obstacles but still turn
12:03 - them around when hitting a wall
12:05 - we can start by separating off the if
12:07 - touching script
12:09 - now instead we will give the enemy a
12:12 - number of tries to get out of the floor
12:14 - before giving up and turning around
12:16 - a good block for this is a repeat block
12:19 - and i'm plumbing for a repeat four times
12:23 - but hold on we haven't even asked if we
12:25 - actually have collided yet well no
12:28 - problem we do this first thing inside
12:30 - this repeat loop
12:32 - if
12:33 - not
12:34 - then bring back the touching checks into
12:36 - here if we have moved sideways and are
12:39 - not touching the level or the edge of
12:41 - the screen then we don't want to do
12:44 - anything
12:45 - so just stop this script
12:47 - see it doesn't matter that we have
12:49 - entered this repeat block we will still
12:51 - stop running this move and left block
12:53 - here and all is done
12:55 - but if we are touching the level then we
12:58 - can try moving y by one to get out of
13:02 - the slope
13:03 - and this will now give us four tries if
13:06 - at any point it manages to get out of
13:08 - the level then the script stops and it's
13:10 - all okay no need to turn around it was
13:13 - just a slope
13:14 - but
13:15 - if the enemy is still touching the level
13:17 - after four tries of moving up then we
13:19 - give up this is too much for the enemy
13:21 - to get around we need to ensure we
13:23 - return them back down the four pixels so
13:26 - change y by negative four
13:29 - and then we bring back the move minus
13:31 - two steps and turn 180 degrees that will
13:34 - turn the enemy around as before
13:36 - excellent that makes sense doesn't it
13:39 - let's test
13:42 - oh yes very cool and smooth they are
13:45 - gliding nicely back and forth and that
13:47 - little bump in the road doesn't pose us
13:49 - with any problems
13:51 - great so with the movement done we can
13:54 - focus next on animations
13:57 - now if we were to just begin switching
13:59 - enemy costumes we would instantly begin
14:01 - hitting the same old problem of sprite
14:03 - collisions occurring due to changes in
14:06 - costume size and shape
14:08 - now this is because we are not at
14:10 - present using hitboxes for the enemies
14:12 - so the collisions are done using the
14:14 - enemy's current costume we need to
14:17 - ensure that the collision detection the
14:19 - touching blocks always use the same
14:21 - costume so let's begin by ensuring that
14:23 - this is the case
14:25 - at the start of the forever loop before
14:27 - we move the enemy
14:29 - switch the costume to red one
14:32 - now because our enemy is square we might
14:35 - as well just use this as our hitbox but
14:37 - you could if you like draw a new costume
14:40 - for this
14:41 - now we should also set the rotation mode
14:43 - to don't rotate because if you remember
14:46 - even flipping the direction of the
14:48 - costume can cause the same hitbox
14:50 - changing issues we don't want to leave
14:52 - them always facing right
14:55 - so after the player is moved each frame
14:57 - we reset the costume and rotation mode
15:00 - to how they were before red one
15:02 - and left and right mode
15:05 - good looking sensible so now for the
15:08 - animations
15:09 - since we are always switching costume
15:11 - back to red one for the collision
15:13 - detection we'll need to keep track of
15:15 - the current animation frame in some
15:18 - other way
15:19 - make a new variable named frame for this
15:22 - sprite only
15:24 - we'll initialize frame to zero before
15:27 - our forever loop kicks off
15:29 - and then we'll need to change frame by
15:32 - to animate through the costumes
15:35 - put it just before we switch the costume
15:37 - back to red one here
15:39 - but rather than adding one let's slow
15:41 - down the animation to once every three
15:44 - or so frames by changing frame by
15:47 - one third that's
15:49 - 0.33 around
15:52 - you will probably have seen this math
15:54 - script before in the switch costume we
15:56 - need an addition operator
15:59 - now we are beginning the animation on
16:01 - costume one here and we animate over the
16:05 - four costumes before looping back to
16:07 - costume 1 again
16:09 - so
16:09 - we start on costume 1. stick that in on
16:12 - the left
16:13 - then on the right we need a floor block
16:16 - this rounds numbers down to their
16:18 - nearest whole number so from frame
16:20 - 1.33 down to frame one
16:23 - next we need mod to loop us around each
16:26 - of the four costumes
16:28 - so the four goes in on the right
16:31 - mod gives us the remainder after
16:32 - division
16:34 - now we can place the floor of the frame
16:36 - on the left of the mod ta-da that's it
16:39 - start on frame one and loop around the
16:41 - next four frames over and over again and
16:44 - that's it and there we have it the
16:47 - animation is looking great and the
16:49 - animation speed is working well too
16:52 - so are you ready to get a little more
16:54 - interaction going off here it shouldn't
16:57 - be hard to allow this enemy to hurt us
16:59 - since the danger sprite does this
17:01 - already with just a broadcast of lou's
17:03 - life
17:04 - indeed at the end of the forever loop
17:06 - drop in an if block
17:10 - and look for when the enemy is touching
17:12 - player
17:17 - i don't want to extend this loop with
17:19 - too many scripts so make a new custom
17:21 - block naming it
17:23 - touching player
17:24 - but this time don't tick the run without
17:27 - screen refresh we may want to add some
17:29 - animation into this script after all
17:32 - yeah so make use of the block right away
17:34 - when we know we are touching the player
17:36 - here
17:37 - and for starters just drag in a
17:40 - broadcast
17:41 - lose life
17:43 - we are going down so run the project
17:46 - here we go
17:47 - touching the enemy
17:51 - what was that sound the player death
17:53 - sound got looped over and over in the
17:56 - most horrible way there
17:58 - so we must be triggering the lose life
18:00 - over multiple frames
18:02 - the problem is that the enemy keeps
18:04 - moving after we die which i like and
18:07 - then they are still checking for
18:08 - collisions as we are fading out we need
18:11 - to prevent further checks while the
18:13 - loose life animation is playing
18:15 - okay then so no problem
18:18 - when we check for touching player add in
18:20 - an and block and an equals
18:27 - we'll need a new variable name it
18:29 - invulnerable
18:30 - for all sprites
18:32 - this will indicate that we cannot be
18:34 - killed
18:35 - and we'll check whether it equals zero
18:39 - so if the player is not invulnerable and
18:42 - the enemy is touching the player
18:44 - only then do we trigger the loser life
18:47 - that's all very well and good but we
18:49 - need to now set the invulnerability when
18:51 - we lose a life
18:53 - that will be in the player sprite so
18:56 - click in there and find the when i
18:58 - receive lose life script
19:01 - then right at the top stuff in a set
19:03 - invulnerable to one
19:05 - nice
19:06 - that should prevent the horrible sound
19:09 - but we also need to reset this back to
19:12 - zero when the game begins
19:14 - so find the define reset and begin level
19:17 - script
19:18 - and we'll set vulnerable to zero right
19:21 - at the top
19:25 - excellent let's test that out
19:31 - oh phew that is a relief that is much
19:35 - more bearable good work
19:38 - of course everyone knows though that we
19:40 - should be able to jump on this enemy's
19:42 - head to defeat it
19:44 - that would be a great addition to this
19:45 - project and we'll detect it by looking
19:47 - for when the player is simply moving
19:49 - down from above
19:50 - place an if before the broadcast lose
19:53 - life
19:54 - if the speed y of the player is less
19:57 - than
19:58 - we need to get the speed y from the off
20:00 - block from the sensing category
20:07 - and i'm going to plumb for a speed of
20:09 - minus one
20:11 - we want to be sure they are traveling
20:12 - downwards when they touch the enemy
20:15 - now we should play a squish sound from
20:18 - the sounds tab
20:20 - we can search up one
20:22 - here we go
20:23 - squish pop should be good
20:30 - so in the if start sound squish pop now
20:34 - remember we made a costume for when the
20:36 - enemy was squished switch costume to red
20:39 - squish
20:41 - next we want to wait for a moment
20:43 - perhaps 0.3 seconds
20:46 - before fading away
20:48 - to do that we repeat 10
20:50 - that is why we didn't tick the run
20:52 - without screen refresh otherwise this
20:54 - would not have animated and we change
20:56 - ghost effect by
20:58 - 10
20:58 - as ten tens are 100 and it will have
21:01 - totally faded away super
21:03 - we just need to finally delete this
21:06 - clone after the repeat loop has finished
21:08 - off
21:09 - shall we give this a quick test i should
21:12 - be able to jump on his head
21:16 - oh man i just ran into him let's try
21:18 - that again yeah there we go squished him
21:22 - flat
21:23 - but there's something missing here did
21:24 - you see what it was
21:29 - yeah we need the player to bounce up
21:32 - again it just looks wrong with the
21:33 - player landing on the ground after the
21:35 - squish
21:37 - since we can't set the player's speed y
21:39 - from the enemy sprite we need to
21:41 - broadcast
21:42 - right before playing the squish sound
21:44 - and broadcast a new message named
21:48 - player
21:49 - bounce
21:55 - click into the player's sprite and find
21:57 - some space
22:01 - when i receive player bounce
22:08 - we just set speed y to
22:11 - how about 10
22:12 - we can always change this at a later
22:14 - date if it seems too much or too little
22:16 - you know what to do by now
22:19 - shall we test that out
22:27 - splendid i really like that the little
22:29 - bounce just makes all the difference
22:32 - okay guys i wonder if you have been
22:34 - concerned about where i placed this
22:37 - first enemy did any of you think oh man
22:40 - he's going to regret that when the
22:41 - player tries to come back onto the first
22:43 - scene
22:44 - well if so then you would be quite right
22:47 - see how unfortunate this is in years
22:49 - gone by i have played actual commercial
22:51 - games where this has been a problem we
22:54 - need to be more careful to consider all
22:55 - the directions a player might enter a
22:57 - scene such that they don't stumble onto
22:59 - an enemy spawn zone and get an auto kill
23:02 - however we can be a bit more cunning yet
23:06 - but to do so we should first improve our
23:08 - enemy spawning script
23:10 - click into the enemy sprite and find the
23:12 - when i receive change scene script
23:14 - we'll make a custom block to wrap up all
23:16 - the positioning and cloning here
23:19 - name it spawn
23:21 - add an input of type
23:23 - then a text label of at
23:26 - then two numeric inputs of x and y
23:30 - a text label of der d i r for direction
23:33 - and an input of der2
23:35 - great run without screen refresh
23:38 - we can move the position and the clone
23:40 - script in there and make use of the
23:41 - block in its place
23:45 - now the type part is not currently used
23:48 - but i find it nice to give it a name so
23:50 - stick in red
23:51 - then we copy the x and y positions
23:54 - and of course the direction of minus 90.
23:57 - coolio we just need to link up the x and
24:00 - y inputs to the go to xy
24:03 - and the input to the point in direction
24:06 - and that is that give it a quick test
24:09 - yeah looking good
24:11 - so what was i saying about a cunning
24:14 - plan
24:15 - right yes so the cunning plan is why do
24:18 - we have to position the enemy in the
24:20 - same place all the time
24:22 - why not change their position if the
24:24 - player comes into the scene from a
24:26 - different direction
24:28 - can we do that
24:29 - sure we can stick in and if else around
24:32 - the spawn block right in here
24:35 - we need to check which side of the
24:36 - screen the player is on
24:38 - stick in a less than comparator and we
24:41 - are looking for the player's x position
24:44 - if x position of player is less than
24:47 - zero then we have entered the scene from
24:50 - the left so we are fine to position the
24:52 - enemy to the far right
24:55 - now let's duplicate the spawn block into
24:57 - the else
24:58 - so where should we spawn the enemy if
25:00 - the player entered from the right of the
25:02 - scene
25:03 - well make the enemy visible on the stage
25:06 - and position them further over to the
25:08 - left away from the auto kill zone for me
25:11 - that gives an x of 87 so i enter that
25:14 - into the new x spawn position
25:16 - also i want the enemy to be facing right
25:19 - so change the direction to 90.
25:22 - finally we can test that
25:25 - the game starts with our enemy on the
25:27 - far right as before so leaping over him
25:29 - we can come in from the right
25:31 - yes we didn't die which is a great sign
25:34 - and yes the enemy now appeared over to
25:36 - the left as we came into the scene
25:39 - brilliant
25:40 - so of course you only need to do this if
25:42 - you want the enemy to behave differently
25:44 - when you enter the scene from left or
25:46 - right otherwise we can just leave a
25:48 - single spawn block for a scene
25:50 - but what if you wanted to make more than
25:52 - one enemy per scene can we do that well
25:56 - yes of course just stop the project
25:58 - we make the enemy sprite visible and
26:00 - position it where you want them to spawn
26:03 - then duplicate a new spawn block within
26:06 - the same if scene equals 1 and fill out
26:08 - the x and y position from the current x
26:10 - and y position on the stage
26:12 - and i'll make them face left
26:17 - okay
26:18 - give that a run through
26:20 - so you see both enemies have spawned at
26:22 - the same time and everything is working
26:24 - great in this game the enemies always
26:26 - respawn once you return to a scene you
26:29 - may or may not want this if there's a
26:31 - great demand then i'll show you other
26:33 - ways that this can work in later
26:34 - tutorials but this keeps the game more
26:37 - lively okay we are close to concluding
26:40 - this episode now but one last thing i
26:42 - want to cover is how we might prevent
26:44 - this top enemy from falling off of the
26:46 - top platform
26:48 - often we want to keep enemies patrolling
26:50 - within certain zones the simplest way to
26:52 - achieve this is by adding safe zones
26:55 - that is areas where enemies can not walk
26:58 - like extra walls that only appear to
27:00 - enemies
27:02 - start by duplicating the danger sprite i
27:05 - chose this because it has the least
27:07 - scripts so we'll need the least cleaning
27:09 - up
27:10 - name it safe zones
27:13 - then in the costume editor delete all
27:16 - but the blank costume
27:18 - now as i want to add safe zones to scene
27:20 - 1 of the game i will click into the
27:22 - level sprite and copy scene 1 costume
27:25 - into the new safe zone sprite
27:28 - cool click back into the safe zone
27:30 - sprite now
27:31 - we can now draw in any enemy blocking
27:34 - walls i want one right here at the edge
27:37 - of this top platform
27:39 - so running the project now you can see
27:41 - the new wall has appeared but it's not
27:43 - doing anything
27:49 - so click into the enemy sprite and find
27:51 - the move left right script
27:54 - as well as colliding with the level we
27:56 - now want to also collide with safe zones
28:00 - but you know this script is getting a
28:01 - bit too wide for my liking so pop in a
28:04 - second if inside the first
28:07 - because these are not touching we can
28:10 - say not touching safe zone here and it
28:12 - works just the same
28:18 - run that now
28:20 - and you should find the player can jump
28:22 - right through these zones
28:25 - but the enemy
28:26 - they cannot that's perfect
28:29 - the only drawback is that we don't
28:31 - really want these to be visible to the
28:32 - player like this
28:34 - the best quick fix is within the safe
28:36 - zone sprite
28:38 - set ghost effect to 100 right at the
28:42 - start up here now if we'd hidden the
28:44 - sprite with a hide that would prevent
28:46 - the enemies from touching it and they
28:48 - would then just walk straight through it
28:51 - but using ghost to fade them away to
28:54 - nothing actually keeps them fully
28:56 - touchable which is very useful to know
28:58 - indeed
29:01 - so test that again
29:03 - and yeah that looks good we have our
29:06 - enemies moving just as we want it
29:08 - so finally before we finish there's one
29:11 - more issue to address come with me to a
29:14 - scene with a moving door
29:16 - i'm going to place a new enemy on the
29:17 - screen to the right of this door
29:20 - stop the project make the enemy visible
29:22 - position them
29:24 - and then in the when i receive change
29:26 - scene script
29:29 - we need a new check for scene 4.
29:32 - i only want to spawn a single enemy so
29:35 - remove all the rest of the spawns
29:37 - fill out the x and y positions from the
29:40 - stage
29:41 - right so what's going to be the problem
29:43 - with this
29:44 - any ideas
29:46 - are you watching
29:49 - ah
29:50 - they can walk through doors or more
29:53 - specifically they can walk through
29:55 - moving platforms
29:57 - so we have another sprite we need to
29:59 - check for enemy collisions against
30:01 - yeah back in the enemy sprite find the
30:04 - move left or right script
30:07 - and introduce a touching platform block
30:11 - we need the or operator again as the
30:13 - enemy is blocked if it is touching a
30:15 - safe zone or a platform
30:18 - so pop that in and here we go
30:24 - yes the enemy is now behaving less like
30:27 - a red ghoul and more like the nice
30:29 - chomping enemy that we wanted that's
30:32 - great to see i'll just go grab the key
30:34 - to this door
30:36 - and now we can let ourselves in
30:38 - [Music]
30:43 - if i wait for this guy i can let them
30:45 - through the door
30:48 - too oh whoops
30:51 - looks like they got caught i guess at
30:53 - this point we could do some extra checks
30:55 - and set them to get squished
30:57 - but i'm not overly bothered by this
30:59 - little quirk maybe we'll revisit this in
31:01 - a later episode too because well
31:03 - this is all we have time for today i
31:06 - only covered one of so many possible
31:09 - enemy types and behaviors but i hope you
31:11 - might try to add all sorts of enemies to
31:13 - your platformers now yourselves
31:15 - when you do please submit them to the
31:17 - studio linked under this video i'm
31:19 - really looking forward to seeing them
31:21 - i'm dead keen to make a video showcasing
31:24 - them but since there's so many i'll be
31:26 - opening first dibs to my channel members
31:28 - so watch out for a member-only post
