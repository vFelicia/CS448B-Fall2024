00:50 - keeps you on your toes quickly feed the
00:52 - fire with oil before the drops can
00:54 - extinguish it pull out your umbrella to

01:04 - 2013 where we get to play as a speedy
01:07 - White Rabbit feeding our faces with
01:09 - carrots I love how very rabbity our
01:11 - movements are but watch out for the
01:13 - hunter out to have his rabbit pie but
01:16 - gosh once you reach full carrot your
01:18 - fearsome carrot breath is
01:20 - Unleashed I can't tell you how
01:22 - entertaining this combo is and you even
01:24 - have a more tricky night cycle to deal
01:26 - with where it becomes very tricky to see
01:28 - that Hunter just how long can you
01:31 - survive the black tiger 7 sneaks into
01:34 - the arcade category with this little gem
01:36 - named feed the cat the trick is to keep
01:39 - their hunger bar topped up while making
01:41 - sure not to eat anything that would
01:43 - disagree with scratchy's rather delicate
01:45 - tummy it starts pretty easy eat the
01:47 - burgers carrots tacos as they fly across
01:49 - the conveyor belt but the speed ramps up
01:51 - quickly and then things get out of
01:54 - control it's a brilliant game that keeps
01:56 - you coming back for more and last but
01:59 - not least Feed Me by just a lemon dude
02:02 - and you can tell from the title screen
02:04 - that this game means business and it
02:07 - does you play this little dude facing
02:09 - off against an unending onslaught of
02:11 - wacky mutations armed with only well a
02:14 - rather awesome rapid firing Cannon which
02:17 - is lucky because you need it the fact
02:20 - that we are feeding these enemies of
02:21 - bullets is made plain when the large Ms
02:24 - burst into the scene I love everything
02:27 - from the great enemies the clean score
02:29 - projected on the ground behind the
02:30 - action and the handrawn Crosshair wow
02:33 - just don't die trying to collect those
02:35 - tempting powerups oh
02:38 - bother so wow each of these games is a
02:41 - blast but the winner is Feed Me by just
02:46 - a lemon dude a welld deserved
02:48 - congratulations considering the
02:49 - competition in this category best
02:52 - Gathering Survival game oh now guys
02:57 - Gathering games these are the games
02:59 - where you must go out to gather
03:00 - resources to complete your mission and
03:03 - oh man have I got the best games to show
03:05 - you it's just a shame only one can win
03:09 - in feed it nuggety 7 has you stranded in
03:12 - a Strange Land where your job is to
03:15 - appease the sleeping Beast by keeping it
03:17 - well fed yeah I guess eats in it sleep
03:20 - and its favorite food is rocks and trees
03:23 - which it just so happens you can pick up
03:25 - in abundance at least to begin with the
03:28 - items get stored in your fast list
03:30 - inventory which means you get to choose
03:32 - when to return to feed the beast
03:34 - preferably before their hunger bar drops
03:36 - too low but don't overfeed them as
03:39 - resources don't grow on trees you know
03:42 - um next up cool Koda 13 presents slime
03:46 - servant in this polished game you need
03:49 - to pick up food scattered randomly
03:51 - throughout the world and bring it to the
03:53 - Slime King but be careful if you run out
03:56 - of energy you will lose so you must eat
03:59 - some of the food yourself only don't let
04:02 - the Slime King see you do it or he won't
04:04 - be happy it's a wonderfully addictive
04:06 - game and I love going back to try and
04:08 - beat my last score I just wish the key
04:11 - for eating food yourself was different
04:12 - to the pickup and give buttons because I
04:14 - kept accidentally eating when I was
04:16 - trying to give to the Slime King and
04:19 - that's game
04:22 - over ah nautical nourishment by word
04:26 - four is for those who like to explore
04:29 - the depths of the ocean initially things
04:31 - look quite simple but the controls and
04:33 - the visuals as you begin to dive deeper
04:36 - really start to draw you in the story is
04:38 - that you need to gather enough
04:40 - underwater resources to cook up some
04:42 - great Seafood to feed all the fish who
04:44 - happen to be swimming all around you
04:46 - most delightfully I'm told using my
04:49 - boids tutorial a great job because it's
04:51 - very well suited to this game wow we can
04:54 - use some of our collected resources to
04:57 - buy upgrades which really helps so we
04:59 - can die deeper and for longer and oh my
05:02 - gosh what was that don't hang around to
05:05 - find out but curiosity and the need for
05:07 - more resources quickly bring you back
05:09 - down to the depths what a great
05:12 - game so that brings us to the last entry
05:15 - in the Gathering genre and this is
05:17 - called kindling by top script and their
05:21 - sister rain soup shark and what can I
05:24 - say about this game oh wow so it's a
05:29 - beautifully scripted adventure of two
05:31 - kids camping in a forest and within
05:33 - moments of the opening dialogue
05:35 - beginning I was hooked and I mean hooked
05:38 - it's witty clever endearing you get set
05:42 - to the job of gathering firewood from
05:44 - the forest to feed the fire sound boring
05:47 - oh man okay I forgive you you didn't
05:51 - know better I do and I mean I've played
05:53 - this game all the way through three
05:55 - times already and I never skipped a line
05:57 - of the dialogue it is genius
06:01 - and so that brings us to decision time
06:03 - and I feel sorry for the others in this
06:05 - category because they're all winning
06:07 - material but top scripts kindlein is my
06:09 - go-to game congratulations to you and
06:12 - your sister well done best casual game
06:16 - moving on to the slightly more relaxed
06:18 - casual game genre we again have some
06:21 - stiff competition just look at these wow
06:26 - the moment I first played Burger Mania
06:28 - by paban 00 Z I loved it a gigantic
06:32 - monster burger is destroying the city
06:34 - obviously because it's hungry so we must
06:37 - feed it the levels are presented in
06:39 - classic Casual Gamer style and we try to
06:42 - stack the burgers to match the order get
06:45 - it right and you have one happy monster
06:47 - get it
06:48 - wrong and well you wasted precious time
06:52 - and the city is one step closer to
06:53 - destruction as the levels progress the
06:56 - orders get more complex and the gameplay
06:58 - more hectic it's quite the ride so you
07:01 - might think there's no game to rival
07:03 - that but you'd be wrong because w111
07:07 - 004s offering monster Cafe is right
07:10 - there at the same level and as they
07:13 - themselves mention perhaps they should
07:15 - have kept this for the Halloween Jam
07:17 - nonetheless this is a wonderful feeding
07:19 - game presented in the most impeccable
07:21 - manner use the curse keys to select each
07:24 - ghost's desired dish in a frantically
07:26 - spooky Race Against Time and then just
07:28 - when you think it's all over the pace
07:30 - picks up and you have to double time it
07:33 - oh
07:34 - yeah and then we have sling feed by
07:38 - scratcher Greg 96 and our poor Pooch is
07:43 - stranded on a distant Island without
07:45 - food well no problem we have a handy
07:48 - catapult and a pair of fruit trees what
07:51 - could go wrong each level our dog sends
07:54 - us his daily food requirements apples
07:56 - and oranges and it's our job to get them
07:59 - to him this is one of my favorite
08:01 - Renditions of a pullback catapult that
08:03 - I've seen on Scratch and the sounds are
08:05 - just ace too I wish the dog were a
08:07 - little less static and the levels a lot
08:09 - more diverse but the basic gameplay is
08:11 - top-notch and very well-coded
08:14 - H floating dog is at an ultimate
08:17 - difficulty level or a bug who am I to
08:21 - say and that brings us to the last
08:23 - casual game of the group eat it up by
08:26 - Malo and Ouija when I first saw this I
08:29 - was like what but then I started playing
08:33 - nine crazy mini gamess all packed into
08:36 - one project and the first few oh my word
08:39 - I split my sides because they are so
08:42 - delightfully drawn and hilariously
08:44 - animated hats off to Malia and Ouija on
08:47 - their brilliant art Direction the games
08:49 - themselves are fun rather easy there
08:51 - would be much more playability if a high
08:53 - score was included on each mini game
08:55 - perhaps however not playing through each
08:57 - mini game is simply not not an option
09:00 - for anyone the experience is just too
09:04 - good so the impossible task a winner but
09:09 - who will it be it's
09:12 - w11104 with monster Cafe congratulations
09:16 - on this spooky
09:18 - Masterpiece best

09:24 - games a young slime all alone except for
09:28 - his trusty cake Master encounters a
09:31 - dragon the only problem is he has bad

09:37 - stands out for its great atmosphere
09:39 - conjured using clever use of sounds
09:41 - music lighting and dynamic

09:52 - conversation between a dude with his
09:54 - super cute chick oh that's my new pet
09:57 - name chick chick and a friend what
10:01 - impressed me was the obvious amount of
10:02 - clever scripting that went into
10:04 - choreographing the text and speech with
10:06 - the character movement and scene changes
10:08 - and gosh that cute chick let's do it

10:50 - this fun encounter between be and a
10:52 - waiter had me in stitches I hope you
10:56 - find inspiration to bring us more where
10:58 - that came from but now we must choose a
11:00 - winner this is so hard Bluey b games

11:13 - by Blue batty games well

11:37 - and call of the krg that's cool
11:40 - rectangle guy if you didn't know now you
11:42 - must listen carefully to what they ask
11:44 - for and then press the down key to go to
11:47 - the kitchen space then pops up the menu
11:49 - on screen onscreen buttons were perhaps
11:51 - a bit of a missed opportunity now use
11:53 - the menu to deduce the ingredients for
11:55 - our order and once acquired drop them
11:57 - one by one into the sandwich machine
11:59 - funnel and whack the button and out pops

12:14 - competition because next up 1748 879
12:18 - brings us restaurant Tycoon this time we
12:22 - are controlling this little Pizza

12:30 - the pizzas to the customers who have sat
12:32 - down at a table to spice it all up
12:34 - there's also the upgrade shop which
12:36 - allows you to boost your pizza money to

12:40 - come in I guess it could be a quiet day
12:43 - in pizz
12:44 - land here's another restaurant game by
12:47 - Saro named five-star restaurant clicker
12:51 - first thing you notice is the wonderful
12:52 - story and smooth text engine and then
12:55 - into the game graphically it's simple
12:57 - but distinctive you use keys or the
13:00 - mouse to control the game on the PC the
13:02 - keys are much quicker as the orders come
13:04 - in select whether it's an appetizer main
13:06 - course or dessert and then plate up the
13:08 - ordered item as quick as possible to
13:09 - send it off the quicker you go the
13:11 - better as the game progresses things get
13:13 - a lot more hectic which makes it really
13:15 - fun I'm just not sure if the difficulty
13:17 - is an illusion or not as I did expect to
13:19 - have died when the orders overflowed but
13:22 - apparently not and then lastly
13:25 - undercooked in Scratch by Dave Maceno
13:29 - I'm not sure I've ever seen scratch cat
13:31 - and his friends depicted as cute as this
13:34 - before they're adorable but then so is
13:38 - this restaurant game where your scratch
13:40 - Friends Place their orders and you take
13:42 - the role of scratchy getting to work
13:43 - grabbing ingredients and assembling
13:45 - Burgers right on the work surfaces like
13:47 - a pro I just love how this game has been
13:50 - put together it may be a little rough
13:52 - around the edges but man totally
13:54 - forgiven because it's a real joy to play
13:57 - see if you can beat my best score of
14:00 - 520 and with that after much
14:03 - deliberation the winner of the
14:05 - restaurant category is indeed Dave mungu
14:08 - with undercooked in scratch cuteness
14:11 - combined with skill with an awesome
14:13 - assembly mechanic just couldn't be beat
14:15 - great work best farm fishing game so

14:21 - into the farming or fishing categories
14:22 - so I've rolled them into one let's see
14:25 - them firstly we have another Masterpiece
14:28 - by the legendary not a school account
14:31 - where the world has grown desperately

14:48 - top-notch and the upgrades are balanced
14:50 - to make you want to keep playing I'm not
14:52 - sure which zone in the fields the fish
14:54 - or the chicken coop drives the most
14:56 - income but it's fun trying them all out
14:59 - out I think perhaps all it needs is some
15:01 - more idle income where strategy can play
15:03 - more of a role where you don't have to
15:04 - be present at all times but seriously
15:07 - wow next up we have fish a far out

17:26 - account with farm farm farm well done on
17:29 - a wonderfully polished
17:32 - game best strategy sluzzle game everyone
17:37 - loves a puzzle right well okay so caged
17:40 - by dabman 67 is a horror survival puzzle
17:43 - you find yourself on a ship in charge of
17:46 - feeding the Beast and there's really not
17:48 - much to go on can you piece together
17:50 - enough to both feed the beast and
17:53 - survive the night great atmospherics
17:56 - with a lot of potential
18:00 - oh nice the delightful gobbles is a card
18:04 - game brought To Us by scratchy long legs
18:07 - 25 where you have to take in the cute
18:10 - gobbles the brown cards and then feed
18:12 - them using the purple cards the food
18:15 - cards but be careful to use the right
18:17 - combinations to feed them just enough
18:19 - but not leave them hanging around too
18:21 - long as they will just leave and you'll
18:23 - lose that round I haven't quite grasped
18:25 - the intricacies of which gobble likes
18:28 - which foods but if I had plenty of time
18:30 - I'd love to play all the way through as
18:32 - it's a real treat with its cute graphics
18:34 - and pleasant narrated Story the user
18:36 - Hollow song has created this fascinating
18:39 - game dragons and kingdoms where we must
18:42 - protect your kingdom from The Fearsome
18:44 - Dragon you do this by balancing your
18:47 - resources planting fields of wheat to
18:49 - make bread and stone to make bricks the
18:52 - trick is that when the dragon attacks
18:54 - you which he will do at certain times
18:56 - you get to choose whether to feed them
18:58 - bread to buy yourself extra time to
18:59 - build up your resources or well
19:02 - otherwise the dragon attacks and then HS
19:05 - Battle Stations did you manage to
19:07 - construct a good defense if not then I'm
19:10 - afraid you don't stand a
19:12 - chance on the other hand with good logic
19:16 - solving yeah I don't think that Dragon
19:18 - will be coming back in a oh my uh moving
19:22 - swiftly on feed it by Robo doog 81 is
19:26 - our last Puzzler and we we take
19:29 - ownership of a green yet very friendly
19:31 - pet dot our goal is to take them safely
19:34 - through this maze only they won't follow
19:37 - you unless you feed them a treat the
19:40 - downside is that they get a little
19:41 - bigger with each feeding the plus side
19:43 - is that they'll follow you for quite
19:45 - some time until they lose interest and
19:48 - then you just have to feed them again
19:50 - problem is get too big and they won't be
19:52 - able to fit through these smaller gaps I
19:54 - love the concept and it certainly had me
19:56 - playing levels over and over again
19:58 - trying to get the best route such that I
20:00 - could feed my pet just the right amount
20:02 - to get me safely to the exit very cool
20:05 - idea but who do you think is worthy of
20:08 - the title of best Puzzler
20:11 - game Gobles by scratchy longlegs 25 for
20:14 - a very unique feed it project that is
20:17 - worth exploring and will keep many a
20:19 - scratcher busy for some time to come
20:22 - excellent
20:23 - job special mention and now my friends
20:27 - we come to a quick fire round of special
20:31 - mention projects no specific game genres
20:33 - just a lot of games that I really loved
20:35 - and wanted to share with you feed it by
20:38 - Nuno game a simple food collection game
20:41 - where you mustn't let the food touch the
20:43 - floor start slow and gets frantic I love
20:47 - it I wonder how far people can go feed
20:51 - the beast by Nether Dragon 222 another
20:53 - feeding the Beast Style game sadly
20:55 - there's a bug so you have to manually
20:56 - hide the thumbnail before you can
20:57 - actually play it please fix this because
20:59 - it's great because then you're treated
21:01 - to my favorite Beast feeding animation
21:03 - of all time I cannot get enough of these
21:06 - little
21:07 - pigs this was my favorite frog game of
21:10 - the challenge always good to see a frog
21:12 - or two you hop around catching the black
21:14 - and golden flies but just be careful not
21:16 - to eat the infected red fly oh
21:20 - no feed the clbo by V OE is probably the
21:25 - simplest scratch projects submitted but
21:27 - this new SC rer has somehow stumbled on
21:30 - a winning formula because it's using the
21:33 - when key press blocks you have to stop
21:35 - moving to press space to eat the berry
21:37 - and get score holding it down can yield
21:39 - Oodles of score if you time it right but
21:42 - that clbo moves around so randomly it's
21:44 - a real skill to know when to move and
21:46 - when to hold down space I love it feed
21:50 - thy creature by Lemonade bucket is a fun
21:53 - monster feeding arcade game it looks
21:55 - great and plays not so great it feels a
21:58 - little buggy but once you learn how to
22:00 - get that hand to grab the people then it
22:03 - starts to fall into place this game has
22:05 - a huge amount of potential and I really
22:07 - love it so keep at it feed the duck by
22:11 - wbox my
22:12 - singing oh my gosh the voice acting is
22:16 - killer I'm hungry can you please take me
22:19 - down to the pumpkin patch so I can get a
22:20 - pumpkin I love this so
22:24 - much thank you but if you have a
22:27 - duckling at home or duck please do not
22:29 - feed them any fast food and what awesome
22:32 - advice thank you and lastly House of the
22:36 - unfed by edca a crazy take on the
22:40 - classic bat bouncing game where you have
22:42 - to try to feed a weird mouth bouncing
22:45 - the ball off the walls seems to help but
22:47 - then every now and again the mouth pops
22:49 - off to the shadow realm the only option
22:52 - is to follow and continue the fight
22:54 - there if it wasn't for all these crazy
22:56 - ads getting in the way I mean what
23:00 - why and so if I had to pick a final
23:04 - winner for the most fun of the special
23:06 - mention games the winner must be feed
23:10 - the clbo by Vee although there's
23:13 - Limitless room to improve this game its
23:15 - very nature makes it fun I dare you to
23:18 - try and beat my score I think it could
23:20 - be a big hit so thank you everyone for
