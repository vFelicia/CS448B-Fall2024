00:00 - [Music]
00:02 - hello fellow scratchers it's been a
00:05 - while but we are back with a brand new
00:07 - episode of the legendary RPG series and
00:10 - gosh is it overdue having just coded the
00:13 - very excellent level saving system in
00:15 - episode 10 now we finally get to create
00:18 - multiple scenes and Link them all
00:19 - together to create a much much larger
00:22 - and exciting game world but how do we
00:26 - keep track of which scenes link together
00:29 - no problem we'll do it by giving them
00:31 - clever names like this one over colon Z
00:35 - colon Z this represents part of our
00:38 - Overworld map combined with a coordinate
00:40 - an X and Y telling our game where the
00:43 - scene is located on the full map so as
00:46 - you can expect that will require some
00:48 - cutting value manipulation but it's all
00:50 - in the day's work for a Griff batch
00:52 - tutorial so are you ready for some RPG
00:55 - coding fun I certainly am so find your
00:58 - projects from where we left off in
00:59 - episode 10 and save them as a fresh new
01:02 - copy for this is scratch RPG episode 11
01:07 - guys let's get
01:10 - scratching we need to begin in the level
01:13 - store Sprite this is where all our
01:15 - saving and loading code lives hopefully
01:17 - you too have the current scene set to
01:20 - over colon 0 colon 0 and if not then you
01:23 - have the option to set Yours to this now
01:26 - now why not make the C name variable
01:28 - visible on the stage
01:30 - good okay so our level is surrounded on
01:33 - all sides by bushes to get past these to
01:37 - another scene we'll need to clear a path
01:39 - the zero key enters the level editor and
01:41 - the E key picks the empty tile under the
01:43 - mouse and now I can brush with the empty
01:45 - tile to remove the section of the wall
01:48 - and can I walk off no I cannot but we
01:52 - have bigger problems to chew on because
01:54 - when I click the green flag again oh
01:57 - dear my level changes have been lost so
02:01 - before anything else we'd better
02:02 - complete the saving of any level updates
02:05 - the obvious time to save is when the
02:06 - user closes the level editor right I can
02:09 - see we already created a load scene
02:11 - event similarly we now add a when I
02:15 - receive store save scene and don't worry
02:19 - the custom block already exists for this
02:22 - save scene it requires a name to save
02:25 - under and we use the current one from
02:27 - the seen name variable great that will
02:30 - be perfect Oh but before we move on
02:33 - there's something I just wanted to fix
02:35 - in here scroll down to our Define new
02:37 - map script there's a block I want to
02:39 - copy this set gml from
02:42 - gmax there we go I copied it and then
02:45 - return all the blocks back as they were
02:48 - before now find the Define read module
02:51 - grid script this is where we load up a
02:54 - saved grid list and again we are setting
02:56 - gmax but do we set gml no we we don't
03:00 - well that could be very unfortunate if
03:02 - the scene size was to change so paste in
03:06 - the copied blocks now VI you thank you
03:09 - to all the scratchers who pointed that
03:11 - one out to me next up then we can head
03:14 - into the tile Sprite we are looking for
03:16 - the toggling of the level editor so find
03:19 - the when zero key pressed hat block if
03:22 - you're wondering why I have this helpful
03:24 - find bar it's part of the awesome
03:26 - scratch add-ons browser plugin I know
03:29 - many of you are already using it too
03:32 - okay now we need to be careful it
03:34 - probably isn't a good idea to save the
03:36 - scene while the main game Loop is still
03:38 - running so broadcast and wait for the
03:42 - Stop Game Loop event to
03:45 - run great so this top if Branch runs
03:48 - when we are exiting the level editor
03:50 - setting editor back to zero and this is
03:53 - the point we should be saving our scene
03:55 - edits drop in a broadcast and wait once
03:58 - more to the new store save scene event
04:02 - in the level store and look here this is
04:05 - where we hide the editor layer variable
04:07 - it makes sense to also show and hide the
04:09 - scene name here too duplicate the hide
04:13 - and also hide scene name now for the
04:17 - else Branch this is where we open the
04:19 - level editor and rather than saving we'd
04:22 - be wise to also force a fresh load of
04:25 - the scene so broadcast store load scene
04:28 - and wait
04:30 - now why load a scene that's already
04:31 - loaded well there's nothing to say our
04:33 - levels won't get modified in game as the
04:36 - game is played so restoring the level
04:38 - before we edit is probably a safer bet
04:41 - we'll also show the C name variable and
04:45 - finally since we stopped the game Loop
04:47 - right up here we'll need to start it
04:49 - back up again with a broadcast start
04:52 - game Loop now do notice I didn't use the
04:55 - broadcast and wait here that was
04:57 - important as we want this script to end
05:01 - and the game Loop is free to continue on
05:03 - without us brilliant smash that green
05:05 - flag and we can give that a test
05:09 - toggling the editor on and off should
05:11 - show and hide the scene name cool but
05:14 - more importantly if I make a change to
05:16 - the level and then exit the editor I'm
05:19 - expecting a green flag click to no
05:21 - longer reset the level yes this time my
05:24 - change was saved and persisted you just
05:27 - need to remember that to keep the level
05:30 - permanently in your scratch game you
05:32 - also need to save the project too anyhow
05:36 - that is awesome I'll just tidy up my
05:38 - screen by double tapping the SC name
05:40 - reporter to switch it to its more basic
05:43 - form okay saving achieved our next task
05:47 - is to get the player walking from one
05:48 - scene to the next not so fast we've
05:52 - already hit a problem do you see how we
05:54 - are being stopped in our tracks right at
05:57 - the edge of the level and this is a
05:59 - bummer the reason is down to how we
06:01 - store our levels in lists grid lists one
06:05 - row at a time lined up one after the
06:07 - other this means if we try to check what
06:11 - tile is to the left of this one we'll
06:13 - find it's the tile from the opposite
06:16 - side of the scene well pants that's
06:18 - another wall of tiles no wonder we have
06:21 - problems getting off the edge of the
06:22 - screen and we can prove this by rushing
06:25 - over to the other side of the
06:27 - level gosh why did I make this scene so
06:29 - big hold on to that thought now if I
06:32 - redraw the boundary bringing the wall of
06:34 - bushes one tile to the left okay so now
06:37 - there's a gap at the right so dashing
06:40 - back over to the left again
06:42 - and a slightly confused result but this
06:46 - is a success when compared to last time
06:48 - and it is enough for us to trigger a
06:50 - change of scene therefore we are going
06:53 - to add a one tile Gap to the right and
06:55 - top of every scene in our game and yes
06:59 - that that would look bad if we allowed
07:01 - the player to ever see it so we'll be
07:03 - careful to stop our camera ever
07:04 - scrolling it into view okay if you want
07:08 - to keep your existing scene playable
07:10 - then we need to take the time to remove
07:12 - all the tiles from the far right and the
07:15 - top rows it's sent up to you whether you
07:17 - restore the Border bushes or not and now
07:20 - we're safe to proceed on to change the
07:22 - camera fencing the code for this can be
07:25 - found in the player Sprite under the
07:28 - Define move camera script scroll down to
07:32 - the bottom to if conditions the first
07:35 - prevents the camera from moving further
07:37 - than the level width minus half a screen
07:40 - 240 pixels now we want to increase this
07:43 - by one tile so 240 + 32 is
07:49 - 272 the same is true for the top edge of
07:51 - the level 180 + 32 is
07:55 - 212 only we must change it on both these
07:58 - lines 20 22 for each give that a quick
08:02 - test speeding over to that right hand
08:06 - Edge and it's perfect the right hand
08:09 - tile is completely
08:11 - hidden great then we should consider our
08:14 - level generation code next click back
08:17 - into the level store Sprite and find the
08:20 - new map script this creates a fresh new
08:23 - fully bordered scene filled with a
08:25 - random splattering of grass and bushes
08:28 - that's great except except we need to
08:30 - include that one extra tile around the
08:32 - Edge from now on either that or we
08:35 - consider scrapping the Border alt
08:36 - together since we are now free to walk
08:38 - from scene to scene
08:40 - unimpeded well I'll show you how to do
08:43 - both and you can make up your own minds
08:45 - we reduce the body height of the level
08:47 - by one tile that's now gmax minus
08:51 - 3 and add it back as a blank top row add
08:55 - to grid but fill it out with blank tiles
09:00 - now we reduce the body width using gmax
09:03 - minus 3 instead of two and similarly
09:07 - attack one extra blank tile to the far
09:10 - right add blank value to
09:13 - grid oh my I almost made a terrible
09:16 - mistake there the final add to grid that
09:19 - we dropped in at the end was in totally
09:21 - the wrong place it needed to move up to
09:24 - be before this final repeat that is for
09:26 - building up the extra two layers above
09:29 - the first grid and these need to be
09:32 - blank and now a big conundrum you might
09:36 - notice that I opted to set gmax to 100
09:40 - here that means each scene is a
09:42 - ridiculously huge 100 by 100 tiles
09:45 - that's 30,000 tiles each when you
09:48 - include height but now that we'll be
09:51 - able to split our map across multiple
09:52 - connected scenes I'd much prefer to
09:55 - limit each scene to just 32 by 32 tiles
09:59 - but if you have already created a
10:01 - fantastic RPG scene and you simply
10:03 - couldn't bear to lose it then I'm afraid
10:05 - you're just going to have to stick with
10:07 - gmax as you have it set now for me I
10:10 - prefer to have a fresh start I am
10:13 - setting gmax to 33 one more than 32 to
10:16 - allow for that one tile Gap then while I
10:20 - have the level editor open I can click
10:22 - the new map button and boom my beautiful
10:26 - level is no more but I am now standing
10:30 - in a very nice 32x32 bordered scene
10:33 - which I think you'll find is a far more
10:35 - manageable size to design your game
10:38 - within so how about we look at
10:40 - generating a fully empty scene next well
10:43 - that's even easier instead of all the
10:45 - complex generation scripts after we set
10:48 - GM we just replace them with a single
10:51 - repeat block repeating for G multiplied
10:55 - by three one for each layer of tiles
10:59 - and then we add the blank value to grid
11:02 - inside that Loop yes that's all we need
11:05 - for a fully blank scene click the new
11:07 - map block again and there you go as
11:11 - blank as a blank thing just remember for
11:15 - that new level to save you need to have
11:16 - clicked new map with the level editor
11:19 - open then when we toggle it off with a
11:22 - zero key that causes it to save and now
11:25 - it's time time to code what happens when
11:27 - we walk off the screen green so I'll
11:30 - make sure we can identify our home scene
11:32 - by decorating it with a number one and
11:34 - some pretty flowers and a tree and here
11:37 - we go we can click into the player
11:40 - Sprite let's get our bearings the main
11:43 - game Loop is here broadcasting tick
11:45 - player so find that when I receive tick
11:48 - player script this deals with the player
11:50 - and the camera movement so now we need
11:53 - to test if the player has moved out of
11:56 - bounds make a new custom block for this
11:58 - called check out of bounds and be
12:01 - careful not to check the run without
12:04 - screen refresh I know leave that well
12:08 - alone this is because we may want to add
12:11 - in a transition effect later on and that
12:13 - will certainly require some
12:15 - animation so drop the new Block in right
12:18 - away check out of
12:20 - bounds and now let's flesh out this new
12:23 - custom Block in some free space we'll
12:26 - Begin by checking whether the player has
12:28 - walked off the left edge of the scene if
12:31 - player X is less than zero then that's
12:36 - it we need to change scene so perhaps
12:39 - another custom block is in order name it
12:42 - change scene and follow this with an
12:45 - input named type we can use this to
12:48 - identify the type of transition next add
12:51 - a label Direction followed by two more
12:54 - inputs DX and Dy these are to tell us
12:58 - the direction we are traveling in once
13:01 - again refrain from clicking run without
13:03 - lemons for the same reason as before I
13:06 - do intend to add a transition animation
13:08 - later on so as before make use of the
13:11 - new block to change the scene as we walk
13:14 - off the left edge of the scene fill in
13:17 - the type as Edge and we'll give it a
13:20 - direction of minus one we're walking to
13:22 - the left and zero that's one scene to
13:25 - the left and no change up or down does
13:28 - that make sense
13:29 - good to check if we've walked off the
13:32 - right edge of the scene it's if player X
13:35 - is greater than and the right Edge is
13:38 - calculated as 32 at a tile width
13:41 - multiplied by and then we need gmax
13:44 - minus one to account for the extra blank
13:47 - column plug those together and update
13:50 - the change scene to move positive one
13:53 - scene to the right excellent now for the
13:57 - bottom and top Edge es duplicate both
14:00 - ifs and change all player X's for player
14:07 - y's also the directions need switching
14:10 - to zero and minus one for moving down a
14:13 - scene off the bottom Edge and zero and
14:17 - one for moving upper scene Splendid if
14:20 - you want to test this is working you
14:22 - could drop a stop all script into the
14:25 - change scene block and confirm moving
14:27 - off the edge does indeed stop the
14:30 - project but let's plow on because this
14:33 - is where things get fun we are
14:35 - officially changing scenes now so as we
14:37 - transition we can stop other scripts in
14:40 - Sprite this forces the game Loop to come
14:42 - to a stop also drop in a weight zero
14:46 - block to ensure the loop ends before we
14:48 - now
14:49 - continue if editor is greater than zero
14:53 - then the editor is active so we'd better
14:55 - ensure any changes get saved broadcast
14:59 - and wait for the store save scene to
15:03 - complete fantastic now if the input type
15:08 - is equal to the word Edge then yep we've
15:11 - just walked off the edge of the scene in
15:14 - that case we should check the current
15:16 - scene name it reports as over colon 0
15:20 - colon 0 so this is where we need some
15:23 - clever code to split the scene name
15:25 - apart from its individual X and Y
15:28 - components well okay then let's make a
15:31 - new custom block naming it split string
15:35 - with an input
15:37 - string a label at and a final input
15:42 - character or Char for short and this
15:46 - time we do check the run without screen
15:49 - refresh so given the input string over
15:52 - colon 0 0 and a split charart of colon
15:57 - this custom block will Loop through each
15:59 - letter building up the individual
16:00 - strings within but splitting them
16:03 - whenever it finds a colon and this
16:05 - should result in a three item list let's
16:08 - create the list
16:09 - first name it strings making it for this
16:13 - Sprite
16:14 - only we'll delete all of the strings to
16:17 - ensure it starts
16:19 - empty and we need another variable the
16:22 - integer I for this Sprite only to keep
16:25 - track of our progress through the string
16:28 - starting at the first letter so set I to
16:31 - one and another new variable string
16:35 - again for this Sprite only we initialize
16:39 - string to the empty value and now we can
16:42 - begin the process
16:45 - repeat for the length
16:48 - of the input string so to store the
16:53 - first letter make a new variable C for
16:57 - this Sprite only
16:59 - setting
17:01 - C to
17:03 - letter
17:04 - I of the input string so is it the
17:09 - splitting character if else checking if
17:13 - C is equal to the input Char that's a
17:18 - colon in our case if it is then we can
17:21 - assume we've found the split point so
17:23 - whatever value is now in our variable
17:25 - string we add that to the strings list
17:29 - add the orange string variable to
17:32 - Strings and then we set string back to
17:34 - the empty value now this will make more
17:37 - sense in a moment as we see what to do
17:39 - for letters that are not colons
17:41 - Splitters that's in the else branch in
17:44 - this case we set string to the
17:48 - join of itself string and the new letter
17:53 - from variable C finally we move on to
17:56 - the next letter in the string by
17:58 - changing I by One just before looping
18:02 - back around to continue the merry string
18:04 - splitting
18:05 - dance when this finally ends and all the
18:09 - letters have been processed we simply
18:11 - add to the string list whatever remains
18:14 - in that string variable we are done want
18:17 - to see that in action it's probably a
18:19 - good idea split string some words
18:23 - separated by spaces and set that
18:25 - splitter to the space
18:27 - character
18:29 - and then click the block and Tada all
18:32 - the words are split out into individual
18:34 - items in our list that's so cool right
18:38 - and how about a string of numbers
18:39 - separated by colons remember to change
18:41 - the splitter to a colon 2 and
18:44 - now again all the numbers are split out
18:47 - isn't that great we can definitely use
18:50 - this to decode this C name variable just
18:52 - drop it
18:53 - in and pow there's our map name and the
18:57 - X and Y position all separated out in
18:59 - our list
19:01 - Perfecto so scroll back over to our
19:04 - Define change scene custom block and
19:06 - we'll finish this baby off if this is an
19:09 - edge transition then split the string
19:12 - scene name at the character colon let's
19:15 - sity check that result if the length of
19:18 - the string list is three then that's as
19:21 - expected a map name followed by an X and
19:24 - Y position so now we can use these
19:27 - strings and the DX and Dy inputs to
19:30 - calculate the scene name we are
19:31 - transitioning to set scene name to item
19:35 - one of strings that's the map name
19:39 - over next up we need the exposition set
19:43 - TMP temp that's reusing an existing
19:45 - variable and we need an addition block
19:49 - summing item two of strings that's the
19:52 - scenes Exposition with the direction DX
19:56 - input variable that'll be minus one for
19:58 - transitioning left and one for
20:00 - transitioning right finally append this
20:03 - to our scene name set SC name to the
20:06 - join of C name and another join block
20:10 - because we first require a colon and
20:13 - then that TMP temp variable that's the
20:17 - exposition updated and restored now
20:20 - we'll do the same for the Y duplicate
20:22 - the last two lines only switching for
20:26 - item three the previous scene's WIP
20:29 - and add to that the Dy input variable
20:32 - nice the next line remains unchanged and
20:35 - our translated C name should be complete
20:38 - don't worry about the else Branch down
20:40 - here for now we'll come back to the
20:42 - other transition types another time
20:44 - think doors holes of the ground stairs
20:46 - goodness knows what else we might need
20:48 - down the road so yay we're close can you
20:51 - feel it broadcast and wait for the store
20:55 - load scene message to complete now what
20:58 - if the requested scene doesn't yet exist
21:01 - well no problem because our load scene
21:03 - script is set up to create a new scene
21:06 - in that case wow how clever of us now
21:10 - wowers we've done a lot of coding we may
21:13 - not quite be done but it's high time we
21:15 - tested our work so smash that green flag
21:19 - we can confirm we begin at scene over
21:22 - colon 0 0 now what we hope is that by
21:26 - walking off the left edge of the scene
21:28 - stupid list in the way that the scene
21:30 - name changes to over negative
21:33 - one0 exactly yeah so pleased to see that
21:37 - result but we didn't see the scene
21:40 - change on screen because the project
21:42 - stopped and that's expected as we never
21:46 - restarted the main game Loop anyhow so
21:49 - if I hit the green flag again now we
21:52 - find ourselves in the new blank scene at
21:54 - minus1 0 so now we can try walking off
21:58 - off the right hand edge of the scene
21:59 - instead that should return us to over 0
22:02 - 0 perfect and of course the project
22:05 - stops so can we just start up the game
22:08 - Loop and all will be well uh no there's
22:12 - one more thing we haven't considered
22:14 - when a player walks off the left edge of
22:17 - one scene we'll be expected them to wrap
22:20 - around appearing on the right edge of
22:22 - the scene once
22:24 - more okay then so if type equals Edge
22:29 - and then we have walked off the edge so
22:32 - which one was it if DX is equal to one
22:38 - then we are walking to the right so we
22:40 - must appear on the far left of the next
22:42 - scene set player X to
22:46 - Zero that one's easy let's duplicate
22:49 - this for DX equal to minus one the Maths
22:53 - for the right edge of the level is 32
22:56 - multiplied by and we drop in the result
22:59 - of subtracting one from gmax gmax minus
23:03 - one great a simple task of duplicating
23:06 - both cases now and switching the DXs for
23:13 - dys and the player X's for player
23:19 - Wise job done and now we can restart the
23:23 - main game Loop broadcast start game Loop
23:28 - remembering that we mustn't wait for the
23:30 - game Loop that isn't going to
23:32 - end okay wow hide them varable reporters
23:36 - and list they just clog up our beautiful
23:38 - screen for it is testing time baby smash
23:42 - that green flag here we are on scene one
23:45 - over 0 0 I'm walking left and we've
23:48 - transitioned to scene over minus one 0
23:51 - and the player is indeed now entering
23:53 - from the right edge of the scene that's
23:56 - excellent walking back and here we are
23:58 - again on scene one and we're at the left
24:01 - Edge Let's try moving down oh yeah that
24:05 - is what I'm talking about scene over 0
24:08 - minus one that's one below the first
24:10 - scene and I can confirm we currently
24:13 - entered from the top of the scene and
24:15 - finally back up to the first scene that
24:18 - works for me tell you what an even
24:21 - better test would be to go back and lay
24:23 - down some rocks and now we can confirm
24:26 - that the new scenes are indeed saving
24:28 - and that we can revisit the same ones
24:30 - consistently I wonder how many scenes we
24:33 - can extend this too quite a few I expect
24:36 - hey wait a minute are you seeing that
24:39 - I'm experiencing a bit of scene flicker
24:41 - as I change scenes it looks like we are
24:43 - seeing a flash of the bottom of the
24:45 - first scene as we enter it and then it
24:47 - reverts to normal it's most likely that
24:49 - we just need to move the camera to the
24:51 - player after switching scene to confirm
24:55 - this simply drop a move camera block
24:57 - right before the broadcast to start the
25:00 - game Loop shall we try this
25:03 - again let's
25:06 - see yeah that was the problem excellent

25:12 - end of another episode now I really hope
