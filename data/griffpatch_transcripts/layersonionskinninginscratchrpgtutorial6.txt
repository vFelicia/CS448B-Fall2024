00:03 - scratchers welcome back to part six of
00:06 - our coding and RPG Series in scratch
00:09 - today we are going to be moving into New
00:12 - Dimensions as we expand our tile base
00:14 - levels not to one not two but three
00:17 - layers of tiles four if you include the
00:19 - background texture too this is important
00:22 - so that we can give our level texture
00:24 - and density making our level designs
00:26 - look far more impressive but what's more
00:29 - our third layer is to be special as it
00:32 - we layered on top of the player Sprite
00:34 - this means we can finally walk behind
00:37 - larger game assets and everything really
00:39 - starts to fall into place I've been so
00:41 - excited to get us to this point and I
00:44 - know from your comments you have too so
00:46 - please if you are then do hit the like
00:48 - button under these videos to try to get
00:50 - the word out and help keep this series
00:52 - going okay so we pick up from where we
00:55 - left off in episode 5 but take a moment
00:57 - to save this as a new copy but this is
01:00 - episode six
01:02 - let's get scratching
01:05 - before though we can begin painting
01:07 - multi-layered levels we need a way to
01:10 - store that level our grid list is
01:12 - currently storing a simple 2D grid of
01:14 - tiles in theory we just need to add two
01:17 - more of these on top so what two new
01:19 - lists
01:20 - that could work but coding it would be
01:23 - more difficult as we'd be forever
01:25 - referring to multiple lists so instead
01:28 - we'll simply tack each grid layer onto
01:31 - the end of the previous one creating one
01:33 - single huge level list the indexes into
01:36 - the list are still quite simple to use
01:38 - the first tile in our level is tile
01:41 - index number one to get to the tile
01:43 - above it we add to this the number of
01:45 - tiles in a row gmax if you remember so
01:49 - it's logical that to get to the next
01:51 - grid layer above we would now add the
01:53 - count of tiles in a whole grid layer and
01:56 - that is gmax multiplied by G Max
02:00 - we will therefore store this value in a
02:03 - variable named grid multiplier or G mull
02:06 - for short
02:08 - so let's do this we'll Begin by clicking
02:10 - into the level store Sprite
02:12 - we need to calculate the gmax multiplied
02:15 - by G Max in our case that's 10 000 tiles
02:19 - quite large and we should be able to
02:22 - confirm this does match the number of
02:23 - rows in our grid list yep 10 000 items
02:28 - create a new variable naming it g mull
02:32 - making it for all Sprites and we'll set
02:36 - Gmod to
02:38 - gmax multiplied by G Max
02:43 - now please click this script so that
02:45 - Gmail variable gets set there we go 10
02:49 - 000.
02:50 - so to add the extra two layers to our
02:52 - existing levels we repeat for two layers
02:58 - multiplied by G mole
03:04 - and we add the empty value to grid
03:10 - that should be twenty thousand empty
03:12 - items appended to the end of our grid
03:14 - list shall we test that currently we are
03:17 - on Ten Thousand rows and after clicking
03:19 - this repeat script now we have 30
03:23 - 000 items wonderful and yes they are all
03:26 - empty rows that fixes up our lists now
03:30 - we should make sure any future level
03:33 - lists are also set up correctly
03:35 - find our Define new map script and after
03:39 - it is generated our simple single layer
03:41 - level drop this repeat onto the end like
03:44 - so and that will bring it up to the full
03:46 - three layers two
03:48 - the set Gmail that can be dropped in
03:51 - after the set gmax
03:54 - awesome that's the setup done now to
03:56 - handle the drawing of the new layers
03:59 - click into the tiles Sprite
04:01 - and find the Define paint script
04:05 - script is responsible for stamping one
04:07 - screen of tiles from our level Grid we
04:10 - want to extend this to allow us to stamp
04:13 - a further layer of tiles on top
04:15 - so click to edit the custom block and
04:18 - rename it paint layer
04:21 - with a new input of layer number
04:28 - now if we scroll up to the when I
04:31 - receive paint background script we can
04:34 - now enter a layer number of one in this
04:37 - first paint layer block as that will be
04:39 - the first layer of tiles in our grid
04:41 - list
04:42 - but then right afterwards duplicate the
04:45 - paint layer block and we'll follow it up
04:47 - with a paint layer 2 as well right on
04:50 - top of the first layer of tiles
04:52 - okay but not to get carried away we
04:55 - haven't yet scripted how the layer input
04:58 - is to work so back into the Define paint
05:01 - layer script
05:03 - split off these scripts under the change
05:05 - gidx block
05:07 - gidx or grid index represents the item
05:10 - number of the tile in our grid list we
05:13 - just need to adjust this for the
05:14 - specified layer number if you remember
05:16 - we have the variable G mull that records
05:19 - how many items are in each layer so we
05:22 - just need to multiply these together
05:24 - except we first should subtract 1 from
05:28 - the layer number since layer 1 wants to
05:30 - begin at the very start not a whole
05:32 - layer into the list
05:34 - so that's layer number subtract 1 all
05:37 - multiplied by G Mull and we drop that
05:40 - into the change gidx block like so
05:44 - cool that's that and that should now be
05:48 - stamping both our tile layers of course
05:51 - testing that out is a little more tricky
05:54 - since we don't yet have any tiles in our
05:56 - second layer but you should at least be
05:59 - able to confirm that things are still
06:01 - looking okay as they are
06:03 - so to add tiles to another layer we need
06:07 - to know which layer we are painting to
06:10 - make a new variable named layer for all
06:14 - Sprites
06:15 - we want to see this layer number when
06:18 - using the level editor so find the when
06:21 - zero keypress script and where we
06:24 - previously hid the editor variable
06:26 - switch this to hide the layer variable
06:29 - and below that also show the layer
06:32 - variable
06:34 - just make sure to remember to actually
06:36 - hide the editor variable if it was left
06:38 - showing like mine was
06:41 - there this variable reporter is just as
06:44 - good an indicator that we are editing
06:45 - the level as the other reporter was and
06:48 - this one is also functional now to let
06:51 - us switch layers I'm going to use the
06:53 - number Keys one two and three for this
06:56 - so I'll just make some space for the new
06:59 - Scripts
07:00 - now when one key is pressed
07:04 - let's make a new custom block
07:08 - set layer
07:11 - with an input of layer number
07:14 - and when the one key is pressed we use
07:17 - the set layer to one
07:20 - now we could duplicate that again for
07:24 - the number two key setting layer to 2.
07:27 - and for the three key setting Layer Two
07:30 - yes you guessed it three
07:32 - right the Define set layer script
07:37 - we'll start with a check
07:40 - if editor
07:42 - is greater than
07:46 - zero
07:47 - just to make sure we are in the editor
07:50 - and then simply set the layer variable
07:52 - to the layer number input
07:56 - great let's test that worked smash the
07:59 - green flag and check that when the level
08:01 - editor is open you can indeed press
08:03 - numbers 1 2 and 3 to get the layer
08:05 - available to change value
08:07 - Splendid now we just need to extend the
08:10 - block placement to actually place on
08:12 - that specified layer
08:15 - right these scripts that place new tiles
08:18 - with the mouse is under the Define paint
08:21 - editor script scrolling down and here
08:24 - under the if Mouse down we are indeed
08:27 - replacing tiles in the grid
08:29 - we have that G idx again so all we need
08:32 - to do is account for the current layer
08:34 - number
08:35 - but we are using gidx twice here once
08:39 - for placing the blocks and again for
08:41 - that e key tile picker I don't want to
08:43 - write this maths twice but also we
08:46 - mustn't change the gidx variable itself
08:49 - so let's make a new variable
08:52 - name it TMP temp to store temporary
08:56 - calculations making it for this Sprite
08:58 - only
09:00 - before the if melts down set TMP to
09:04 - rgidx
09:05 - and then we can carefully replace the
09:07 - two following gidx variables with these
09:10 - new TMP variables instead since they are
09:12 - now the same value
09:15 - cool because now we are free to do the
09:18 - layer offsetting to this temp variable
09:21 - we need a layer and subtract from that
09:25 - one as before
09:27 - and then we multiply this by G mull the
09:31 - size of our layer lastly we add this to
09:34 - gidx and pop it back into the set temp
09:38 - block
09:39 - oh gosh wow how good are you feeling
09:42 - about this in theory we are now ready to
09:45 - replace tiles in any layer and have
09:47 - coated up the stamping of the first two
09:49 - layers too so poke that green flag and
09:53 - let's take a gander
09:55 - so I've entered Layer Two and I've got
09:57 - the top of a tree as my brush costume
09:59 - I'm going to try and place it right over
10:02 - this pathway so what do you think will
10:05 - this all come together and work click
10:08 - yes oh yes we've only gone and done it
10:11 - you can clearly see the previous tile
10:13 - still sat behind the top of this tree
10:15 - tile so I am pleased about that and I'll
10:18 - just finish off the rest of that tree
10:19 - now yes that's dead exciting isn't it
10:24 - now question why can't I delete this
10:27 - right hand portion of the tree
10:29 - uh it's because I'm still editing layer
10:32 - two you see and this tree was drawn on
10:34 - layer one of course so press the one key
10:37 - to switch to layer 1 and now with a
10:40 - blank costume selected using that hiki I
10:43 - can delete this tree too of course
10:45 - having done so it would actually have
10:47 - been better to move the whole tree
10:49 - across off the path so back to layer 2
10:52 - and I'll redraw this tree one tile up to
10:54 - the right and then remove the left hand
10:57 - tiles there looking nice guys
11:01 - layer 1 and 2 work excellently but hold
11:06 - the phone something is not quite right
11:08 - should I really be able to walk right on
11:11 - top of this Treetop it would make more
11:13 - sense if that was drawn on top of my
11:16 - player right indeed and this is the
11:19 - whole purpose of layer three our third
11:22 - layer is to be drawn above or in front
11:25 - of the player giving that illusion of
11:27 - depth
11:28 - only problem is our level is stamped and
11:32 - the player is just a Sprite no stamping
11:35 - involved and as such can never appear
11:37 - behind the level hmm unless we stamp the
11:42 - player 2. okay if we look over here in
11:46 - the paint background script this is
11:48 - where the layer 1 and 2 are stamped and
11:51 - we will need to stamp the player right
11:53 - after this before we then go on to stamp
11:55 - layer 3.
11:56 - to do this we need to click into the
11:58 - player Sprite
12:00 - find the main game Loop when I receive
12:04 - start game Loop
12:06 - the scripts are running in this order
12:08 - player movement paint the background and
12:11 - then paint the player it has the right
12:13 - name paint player but if we check out
12:16 - the scripts it's only positioning and
12:19 - not stamping but no problem we just drop
12:22 - in a stamp block at the end
12:25 - but don't forget that the player Sprite
12:26 - is still showing so to tidy this all up
12:29 - under the when green flag clicked script
12:31 - drop in a hide block
12:36 - perfect let's give that a test to see if
12:39 - the player's Sprite is stamping
12:40 - correctly above layers one and two
12:43 - sweet yes it is looks just the same as
12:46 - before
12:47 - now we just need to paint that third
12:50 - layer after stamping the player find the
12:53 - main game Loop once more and we need a
12:56 - new broadcast after painting the player
12:58 - broadcasting the message paint layer 3.
13:03 - can you guess what this is meant to do I
13:05 - wonder how many of you could complete
13:07 - the scripts for painting layer 3 without
13:09 - me
13:10 - feel free to stop the video and see if
13:12 - you can drop me a message in the
13:14 - comments if you did manage it but here
13:17 - we go click into the tile Sprite we are
13:20 - going to need a new when I receive event
13:22 - hat block for the paint layer 3 event
13:26 - and what we do is just paint layer three
13:29 - of course now that in itself is almost
13:32 - enough except when the level editor is
13:35 - open we really want that to all draw
13:38 - after the main level finishes drawing so
13:41 - grab the scripts from the set Focus
13:43 - palette block above and move them over
13:46 - into the paint layer 3 script
13:49 - nice okay so in theory gosh the
13:52 - excitement is palpable I'm switching to
13:54 - layer 3 now no wait I need to remove the
13:57 - top of the tree so back to layer 2 and
14:00 - then press e over some empty space and
14:02 - draw over the old tree to remove it then
14:05 - back to layer three and draw the top
14:07 - back in yes it's drawing which is a very
14:11 - good sign but is it in front of the
14:13 - player careful does it oh guys yes that
14:18 - is so beautiful isn't it what a change
14:20 - now we can go behind and in front of
14:23 - these tiles so good
14:25 - of course without Collision detection we
14:28 - can still pass through the middle but
14:30 - hey one thing at a time right come on I
14:34 - just have to try this out on a larger
14:36 - house the whole top section of this
14:38 - should now be transitioned into layer 3.
14:41 - oh wait it's not even on Layer Two this
14:43 - is a layer one house at the moment so
14:45 - remove it from there
14:47 - and then on layer three draw the house
14:50 - back in with our magic space key feature
14:53 - Still Loving that
14:56 - here we go taking a stroll oh simply
15:00 - awesome if you are seeing these results
15:03 - in your project too then kudos to you
15:05 - you've done a great job we all can have
15:07 - a lot of fun making our levels look and
15:09 - feel super awesome from here on like
15:12 - creating this awesome Stone Temple
15:15 - complete with doorway
15:18 - grassy roof fence ladder or whatever
15:21 - else you feel like adding looks so good
15:24 - doesn't it
15:26 - now just before we conclude this episode
15:29 - one thing that gets a little tricky now
15:31 - that we have multiple layers of tiles is
15:33 - knowing which tiles you placed on which
15:35 - layers So to avoid confusion how about
15:38 - we add an option to fade out the layers
15:41 - you are not working on a so-called onion
15:44 - skin mode
15:45 - so still on the tile Sprite under the
15:48 - when flag clicked we'll make a new
15:51 - variable onion mode for all Sprites
15:56 - and set onion mode to zero when the game
15:59 - starts up
16:01 - now to be extra safe under the when zero
16:04 - key press script whenever we enter or
16:06 - exit the level designer let's also set
16:09 - onion mode back to zero turning this
16:11 - mode off we don't want to keep it
16:13 - enabled when playing the game now we
16:16 - could introduce a new key press to
16:18 - toggle the onion skin mode on and off
16:20 - but how about we combine it with the
16:23 - already defined number Keys one two and
16:25 - three at present when we press a layer
16:27 - number key we call the set layer here if
16:31 - we happen to press the same layer number
16:32 - twice then we simply stay on the same
16:35 - layer but perhaps we could use multiple
16:38 - presses to toggle the onion skinning on
16:41 - and off instead
16:43 - for this we need an if else block
16:45 - checking whether the current layer is
16:48 - already equal to the requested layer
16:50 - number
16:51 - well then if that isn't the case then we
16:54 - want to set layer to the new layer
16:56 - number as before so that goes in the
16:59 - else
17:00 - but if this is the same layer number
17:02 - again let's toggle the onion mode
17:05 - instead by setting onion mode
17:08 - to the result of subtracting from one
17:12 - onion mode that will toggle the mode
17:15 - from 0 to 1 and back to zero again let's
17:18 - just sanity check that by running the
17:19 - project with the level editor open and
17:22 - we are on layer 1 already so pressing
17:24 - number one again and woo the onion mode
17:27 - has toggled to one and back to zero with
17:30 - each subsequent press
17:32 - now press number two to get to Layer Two
17:34 - and press two again and yes this is
17:36 - working just as we hoped
17:39 - Okay cool so let's get this working
17:42 - find the Define paint layer script
17:45 - and we'll pop in an if block right at
17:47 - the top
17:49 - we simply want to check whether onion
17:51 - mode is greater than zero
17:56 - if it is then great we want to fade away
17:59 - all but the current layer of tiles
18:02 - so not
18:04 - layer equals layer number
18:08 - so if we are painting an onion skinned
18:10 - layer one other than the current layer
18:13 - then set ghost effect to fade this
18:16 - nicely out to something like 80. feel
18:19 - free to play with that value to find
18:21 - what you like the most
18:22 - now just before we try that out scroll
18:25 - down to the bottom of the script and we
18:27 - must ensure we set the ghost effect back
18:30 - to zero at the end otherwise the next
18:33 - tiles to be stamped will continue to be
18:35 - faded out and we don't want that
18:37 - so run the project now
18:40 - and clicking one again to enter the
18:43 - onion skin mode on layer 1 and look
18:45 - there's our first layer tiles showing up
18:48 - ghosted this lamp post is on layers two
18:50 - and three I expect
18:52 - if I press 2 to edit layer 2 there we go
18:56 - now layer 1 tiles fade away and we can
18:58 - clearly see the layer 2 tiles
19:01 - how about layer three here there they
19:05 - are that's so cool and will really help
19:07 - us when editing more complex level
19:09 - regions what you might note though is
19:11 - that the background grass texture
19:13 - doesn't yet fade away and we really need
19:15 - that to do the same so click with me
19:18 - into the background Sprite we've not
19:20 - been in here for a while have we before
19:22 - we stamped the background we want an if
19:25 - else block
19:28 - so that we again can check if the onion
19:30 - mode is enabled that is it's greater
19:33 - than zero
19:36 - if it is then we want to draw a faded
19:39 - out version of our grass texture to do
19:42 - that we'll first erase all from the pen
19:44 - category to clear the screen to Pure
19:46 - White
19:47 - and then set ghost effect as before to
19:50 - 80 percent before our script goes on to
19:54 - stamp the background this time faded out
19:57 - then we just need to account for when we
19:59 - are not in onion mode and we set ghost
20:02 - effect to zero
20:04 - fantastic that should do the job shall
20:07 - we check it out smash that green flag
20:10 - let's turn on onion skinning mode
20:13 - oh yes there we go now everything except
20:17 - layer 2 tiles are ghosted including that
20:20 - background we should now be able to view
20:22 - layer one yep without the background
20:24 - which is good news for helping us to
20:26 - build our level and know where our tiles
20:29 - really are if we check out the houses
20:31 - you can now clearly see where tiles are
20:34 - at the bottom which tiles are on Layer
20:36 - Two at just this corner tile for me
20:39 - and of course layer 3 that draws in
20:42 - front of the player well excellent that
20:46 - neatly brings us to the end of another
20:48 - highly productive episode if you're
20:51 - enjoying this series then please smash
20:52 - the like button now and don't forget to
20:54 - subscribe to the channel so as not to
20:56 - miss the next exciting episode I wonder
20:59 - what we'll cover next I'm thinking that
21:01 - we should perhaps start to think about
21:03 - Collision detection what do you think
21:05 - it's quite a biggie but it feels like
21:07 - it's the natural Next Step okay well
21:11 - that's it from me today do have a great
21:13 - week ahead and scratch on guys
21:18 - [Music]
21:39 - thank you
