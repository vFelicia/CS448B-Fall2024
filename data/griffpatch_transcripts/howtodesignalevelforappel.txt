00:00 - hello fellow scratchers i'm grifbatch
00:03 - and i'm super excited to introduce you
00:05 - to my latest game
00:06 - apple this game has been in development
00:09 - for around three months
00:10 - and it's quite possibly the most
00:11 - ambitious platformer i've worked on to
00:13 - date
00:15 - this video is going to focus on the
00:16 - level designer but before we do
00:19 - here's a quick overview of the game
00:20 - itself you play the part of this little
00:23 - chap
00:23 - named apple a character originally
00:25 - designed by legobauer9
00:27 - look him up on scratch and who you may
00:30 - have noticed
00:31 - had a cameo appearance in my getting
00:33 - over it game earlier this year
00:35 - the premise of apple is that the very
00:38 - world is out to get you
00:40 - you'll frequently notice it watching you
00:41 - with its big eye and
00:43 - very often trying to spike or squish you
00:46 - now the first challenge you have is
00:48 - simply to get through
00:49 - each level reaching checkered flag the
00:52 - game keeps track of the world record
00:54 - fastest time so
00:55 - that should be a bit of fun for the
00:56 - community to make things even more
00:58 - interesting
00:59 - we also record the fastest time for the
01:01 - player who manages to collect
01:03 - all the yellow apples on a level and
01:05 - also one more time
01:06 - but the player who manages to find and
01:09 - collect
01:10 - the one big red apple hidden on the
01:11 - level and collect all the glasses too
01:14 - so that's three records to try and beat
01:16 - for each level in the game
01:18 - making this probably quite a fun game to
01:19 - speed run
01:21 - talking of levels apples currently has
01:24 - nine official levels
01:26 - the first being the easiest and as you
01:27 - progress through the game each level
01:29 - introduces more of the game's mechanics
01:31 - and content by the time you reach level
01:34 - nine you should be in theory
01:36 - a master of all things happen but things
01:39 - don't have to
01:40 - stop there because apple contains a very
01:42 - handy level designer right here on the
01:43 - front screen
01:44 - and everyone can share their hand
01:46 - crafted levels with the scratch
01:48 - community
01:49 - okay so the apple level editor you'll
01:52 - find the
01:53 - menu option on this front page to enter
01:55 - the level of editor
01:58 - now we spawn on a nice blank world i can
02:00 - use the
02:01 - was store the arrow keys to move around
02:03 - and i can fly
02:04 - quite nicely which is very useful for
02:05 - editing levels and i can go through
02:07 - anything and i can't die
02:08 - so very indestructible so how do i
02:12 - test a level rather than just flying
02:14 - around simple
02:15 - click on edit menu hit play and that
02:18 - toggles
02:19 - for a second into play mode and now i'm
02:22 - unable to walk through walls
02:23 - and i can play the game again i hit edit
02:26 - menu
02:27 - to go back into edit mode and now i can
02:28 - go through again there's a shortcut for
02:30 - that which is really very useful when
02:31 - editing levels quickly
02:33 - hold down q and tap the m key
02:36 - and that toggles it into play mode hold
02:38 - down q
02:39 - press m back into edit mode again
02:43 - right so i've got a brush which is this
02:47 - block under my cursor i can hold down
02:49 - the left mouse button
02:50 - and drag and paint blocks onto the
02:53 - screen
02:54 - which is great and if i happen to start
02:57 - dragging from a block that i've already
02:59 - painted
03:00 - it deletes so i can really quickly just
03:03 - drag in
03:04 - bits of level like this move around
03:08 - and draw it as i go so what about
03:11 - swapping to a different type of brush
03:13 - well that's the number keys so number
03:15 - one key toggles between different solid
03:17 - blocks
03:18 - different shapes different textures
03:22 - like this and some different
03:25 - sized ones too like this i can put in
03:27 - little blocks
03:29 - if i test it by holding q and tapping m
03:34 - and see now i can test out my level
03:37 - great
03:38 - q m again back into edit mode now
03:41 - what about different type of things so
03:43 - how about spikes that's the number three
03:45 - key
03:46 - so here's some spikes different spikes i
03:48 - can put some spikes down in this pit
03:49 - like this
03:51 - it looks cool doesn't it and there's
03:54 - another shortcut here if i want to use
03:56 - um the same brush that i've already used
03:58 - like if i wanted to paint with this one
04:00 - put my mouse over that block press the e
04:03 - key which means eyedropper
04:04 - there look i'm now drawing with that
04:06 - block he over the
04:08 - spikes becomes a spike so i can quickly
04:12 - go around find a block i like like that
04:13 - one and then i can draw with it
04:16 - okay so there's some spikes let's just
04:19 - test they work
04:20 - i just press the q and m
04:23 - yep spikes work treat
04:26 - okay so what if i wanted to change where
04:29 - i appear on the level
04:31 - so if i press the five key that shows me
04:34 - things like collectibles so i can drop
04:36 - in an apple
04:37 - six so five again is a checkpoint flag
04:41 - five again that's a used checkpoint flag
04:43 - i don't really need that one to be
04:44 - honest
04:45 - uh five again it's the end of level flag
04:47 - very important let's put one of those
04:49 - over here
04:50 - the end of the level okay five again
04:54 - now that's a special apple that's an
04:55 - apple that will follow a platform so
04:57 - don't use that for anything else but
04:58 - for moving platforms i'll show that
05:00 - later keys
05:02 - and here we go there is the spawn point
05:05 - so that was the number five key to find
05:06 - that
05:07 - and i wanted to spawn up here okay so
05:11 - when the game starts now i'm going to
05:12 - appear up there
05:14 - i've got an apple to collect i've got a
05:15 - checkpoint and i've got an end of level
05:18 - um before we do anything else's level
05:20 - let's just try to get an enemy in
05:22 - now that's the number four key so here's
05:24 - the default enemy i'll put him here
05:27 - like this now let's just see what
05:29 - happens if i run that
05:30 - so i'll just use the play button
05:34 - he starts and he falls into the spikes
05:37 - not a very good way what i wanted to do
05:39 - is go left and right
05:40 - up here so toggling back into game mode
05:43 - i have to use a special block which is
05:44 - number two but number two button is kind
05:46 - of
05:47 - um non-solid blocks
05:50 - so i've got this decoration block so
05:52 - again i get
05:53 - this grey x the grey x is a special one
05:57 - which is very useful for enemies
05:58 - and moving platforms and it means no
06:01 - enemy or moving platform can move into
06:03 - this block
06:04 - so i put them like that and then started
06:06 - off
06:06 - [Music]
06:08 - now the enemy is constrained to being on
06:11 - top of this
06:12 - platform brilliant
06:16 - and that is a reasonable quick level
06:19 - so let's give it a save and see if it
06:22 - works
06:23 - so hit edit menu hit save
06:26 - you get your code this big long string
06:29 - here
06:29 - so if i double click it and then right
06:32 - click
06:32 - and say copy that now copies that to my
06:35 - clipboard
06:37 - now these codes you can paste
06:41 - into the scratch form here is my scratch
06:45 - form the link will be
06:46 - under the video and i'm going to paste
06:49 - this code just here like this
06:52 - so i'll say here's my
06:56 - test level code
07:00 - enjoy like that so there's the entire
07:03 - level
07:04 - hit submit there we go
07:08 - the level for someone to try now how do
07:11 - people go about trying these levels
07:14 - so let's quit out of the level editor
07:16 - back to the main menu
07:19 - and now we hit the play button like
07:20 - normal and rather than choosing a level
07:23 - click on load and now we're prompted to
07:25 - enter a level code
07:27 - so where's that so if i double click on
07:30 - this
07:31 - copy it to the clipboard either right
07:32 - click or press ctrl c
07:35 - go back to apple paste it
07:38 - to here my paste with right click
07:41 - yeah i can paste it with the right click
07:43 - click tick
07:45 - and here comes our custom level see i
07:48 - spawn at the top
07:50 - [Music]
07:55 - and there we go four seconds excellent
07:59 - so that's a quick way to be able to edit
08:01 - levels
08:02 - so what else can we do with this level
08:05 - editor
08:06 - let's go back in and learn a few more
08:09 - extended techniques
08:11 - so far we built this little level here
08:15 - now what if we wanted for example to
08:18 - have spikes not just on the ground but
08:20 - on walls okay so if i go over the spike
08:23 - and press e
08:24 - i can pick up my spike sprite pick up my
08:27 - spike
08:28 - of course i could just press the three
08:30 - key and toggle through what i want
08:31 - but you'll notice they're always
08:32 - pointing up at the moment
08:34 - so what i can do is press the r key for
08:37 - rotate
08:39 - and that toggles me around all four of
08:41 - the possible positions this spike can go
08:43 - in
08:43 - so then it's just an easy matter of just
08:46 - drawing them in where i want
08:47 - rotate it around over there so that's
08:51 - really really easy
08:52 - and the same applies to things like
08:55 - flags
08:55 - checkpoints on walls
08:59 - uh even um enemies but this enemy
09:03 - although you can put him on the side he
09:05 - won't react nicely at all if you try it
09:07 - doesn't
09:08 - that's just not not meant to happen
09:11 - but there are enemies that can for
09:12 - example saw blades
09:14 - they can be put on the edge of walls
09:15 - like this i click one on
09:17 - and then start it playing
09:20 - it attached itself to the wall that i
09:23 - put it on
09:24 - that rotate it around like that it would
09:26 - attach to that wall
09:27 - like that
09:31 - it uh attaches to an imaginary wall
09:33 - which doesn't really work
09:34 - should be on that wall anyway so
09:38 - what are we going to look at next we uh
09:40 - looked at enemies and how they could be
09:42 - bounded
09:42 - so they fall off should we just have a
09:45 - look at all the different types of
09:46 - things that we have in this game so
09:47 - let's click main menu and do new
09:50 - yep okay so
09:54 - let's look at the
09:55 - [Music]
09:57 - enemies first so meshes let's look at
10:00 - those
10:01 - so i generally put these too high up or
10:04 - one block high up
10:05 - put a couple of those in a row like this
10:08 - and then i'll push the normal blocks
10:11 - thing in between in fact no not for now
10:13 - let's not do that bit let me put
10:15 - a run of level blockers
10:19 - like that across the top then we can see
10:21 - what's going on here if i run the game
10:23 - using the q and m key together
10:28 - stick to the ceiling here so you'll see
10:31 - that these all go together
10:35 - and they're going up as far as
10:40 - these x's i put in if i hadn't put these
10:43 - in
10:44 - it would have done this
10:49 - goodbye yep not a very good plan
10:53 - so usually you put in two of these
10:56 - blocks above like this and if i just put
10:59 - in
11:00 - oops not eyeballs oh well let's do that
11:03 - why not
11:04 - okay now that
11:08 - having two blocks high hides this top
11:10 - part of the
11:11 - masher so it's all nice and neat
11:16 - okay now something much more extended um
11:19 - enhanced
11:20 - what if i want these meshes not to be
11:23 - striking at the same time but to be like
11:25 - one two three
11:26 - one two three so this
11:29 - is a bit clever um so we enter edit mode
11:33 - what we do is we put the mouse over the
11:35 - top of the first one
11:37 - and we press the slash key
11:40 - so this pops up and enter data
11:44 - and then ask block at the bottom here
11:45 - where we can enter commands
11:47 - now these are strings of letters and
11:49 - numbers
11:50 - um with no spaces in between but each
11:53 - letter means something so in this case
11:55 - i'm going to hold the masher
11:59 - which is an h key i'm going to hold it
12:01 - for zero
12:03 - what that means is that this mesher is
12:06 - going to
12:07 - instantly mash down a of the level
12:10 - second one press slash i'm going to hold
12:14 - it
12:14 - for 10. that's 10 frames that'll be a
12:17 - third of a second
12:20 - and then the third one slash hold
12:23 - 20 so we've got h0
12:27 - 10 and h20 and now let's do here and
12:30 - then run the game
12:34 - and now beating one of the other but
12:38 - they're keeping nicely in time with each
12:39 - other
12:43 - okay what if i want them to mash
12:47 - at different speeds so what you can
12:50 - change is the amount of time
12:51 - they stay at the top so at the moment
12:52 - they can mash down they rise up and then
12:55 - they stop for a bit and they match again
12:57 - if i press slash over this again so i
13:00 - have to type h0 again if i want to keep
13:02 - that
13:03 - but i also have a d for delay so h for
13:05 - hold that's at the start holds it
13:07 - then d is how long it delays at the top
13:10 - so the delay of zero
13:11 - would mean it doesn't wait at all so if
13:14 - i run that now
13:15 - this first one is going to go up and
13:17 - then drop straight away which is much
13:20 - more deadly
13:24 - and over this one here then so if i have
13:26 - a hold of 10 but then a delay of
13:29 - 30 would be a whole second delay at the
13:32 - top
13:35 - so this one here should come up and wait
13:36 - for a whole second or topping
13:40 - i actually didn't really see that much
13:42 - glowing i must hold for about a second
13:43 - anyways if i
13:44 - delay so i delay it for 60. that should
13:47 - be two seconds which is longer than
13:48 - normal let's give that a go
13:51 - so it goes back up and then it waits two
13:54 - seconds before dropping again
13:56 - there we go you can add a lot more
13:58 - interest into your level
14:00 - by programming these things like this
14:06 - now what if i want these to mash
14:09 - only when i come near them
14:12 - the first time so you can't make it so
14:15 - that they
14:16 - otherwise at the moment you can't at the
14:17 - moment make it so that they
14:19 - always drop when you stand on a certain
14:20 - place but you can make it so they drop
14:22 - the first time let me show you how to do
14:24 - that so if i come over here
14:26 - and i put in here a g code which is
14:29 - group
14:30 - i'm going to call it g1 for group one
14:34 - and i'm going to do the same for all of
14:35 - these g1
14:38 - g1 okay so these are all linked to g1
14:40 - for group one
14:42 - now press 2 key and select this new one
14:46 - this here this is a trigger block and it
14:49 - means if i touch this
14:51 - it'll set off some trigger group so
14:54 - wherever we're going to put it let's put
14:55 - it just here okay
14:58 - and then i'm going to write not nicely
15:01 - then i'm going to
15:01 - press the slash key and i'm going to
15:03 - give this a g1
15:05 - tag as well so that's group one now
15:09 - start the game and behold the meshes are
15:12 - all waiting for me
15:14 - and when i touch this
15:15 - [Music]
15:17 - they all get set off
15:19 - [Music]
15:21 - now why didn't they drop straight away
15:22 - and kill me
15:24 - because by default these have a slight
15:27 - hold
15:27 - on them and i've taken the hold off so
15:29 - if i do g1
15:31 - hold a zero
15:36 - that one now drops as soon as i go
15:39 - underneath it
15:41 - so as soon as i touch it so if i put
15:43 - them all as
15:44 - g1 hold zero
15:50 - they will all now drop the moment i
15:52 - touch that
15:55 - but then they continued dropping until
15:56 - the levels we started
15:59 - so it's more for speed runs that you can
16:00 - do that it's an
16:02 - interesting technique for setting up
16:04 - your level how you want it
16:06 - where this is really useful is for
16:08 - things like lifts so if we switch now to
16:11 - the lift which i think is the number
16:14 - uh six yes that's it so number six is
16:17 - lifts
16:18 - and moving platforms so this first one
16:20 - is a lift that would go
16:22 - left to right here's a lift that goes up
16:24 - and down
16:25 - so if i put in let's just go through
16:27 - them again i think there's one more lift
16:30 - this one here another up and down lift
16:31 - but it's got this special x here
16:33 - which is the block that stops things
16:35 - moving through them which is great for
16:37 - lifts
16:38 - so this lift here can go in the ground
16:40 - but it doesn't go further down so it
16:42 - doesn't
16:42 - bob down there so if i just run that
16:45 - straight away
16:46 - that just becomes a moving lift and it
16:50 - just goes up for infinity
16:52 - so we need to bound it how do we stop it
16:54 - from moving well
16:55 - we've seen this before we use the hexes
16:58 - so where do i want to go to
16:59 - will be here so to move up to level with
17:02 - the top of this
17:03 - let's give that a go
17:05 - [Music]
17:08 - perfect that just pops up and down
17:11 - between those two x's
17:13 - and of course i can bind this
17:16 - to a a trigger block so if i put a
17:19 - trigger block
17:20 - above the lift and then i put this into
17:24 - group
17:24 - two this time because that's group one
17:26 - i'll
17:27 - also tag the lift with the g2 so both of
17:30 - those are grouped too
17:32 - now the lift stays where it is until i
17:35 - stand on it
17:37 - it goes up what if i wanted it
17:40 - to stay where it is at the top and then
17:43 - come down so pause at the top
17:44 - before coming back down well that's the
17:47 - slash key
17:48 - keep it in group two and now we use the
17:51 - delay
17:52 - and i'll have a delay of 60 for two
17:55 - seconds that means so 30 is a second
17:59 - okay
18:00 - i'll give that a go it goes and it
18:03 - should stop for two seconds
18:07 - and then it did it comes back down stops
18:10 - two seconds
18:12 - beautiful what if i wanted
18:15 - it to move faster okay so again
18:19 - that's the slash key so group 2
18:22 - delay 60 so we've got two things we can
18:25 - do here
18:25 - we've got s for speed that's how fast it
18:28 - moves
18:29 - and we've got a for acceleration it's
18:31 - how fast it gets to that speed
18:34 - so speed we can set to let's say
18:37 - 6 16 yeah why not it's quite fast uh
18:42 - acceleration we do in hundreds um an
18:45 - acceleration of 100 is pretty fast um i
18:48 - think by default it's something like 12
18:50 - or something i'm not sure
18:51 - so this is going to be really fast now
18:53 - this lift
18:54 - let's give it a go here we go
18:58 - way much more dynamic feeling
19:06 - cool okay
19:09 - what else can we have a look at let's
19:11 - have a cycle through the blocks
19:13 - so number one key we've got the normal
19:15 - block we also have things like eyeballs
19:18 - which when we play the game they look
19:20 - really cool they follow the
19:21 - layer around then we have
19:25 - half sized blocks like this again you
19:28 - can rotate those
19:29 - so they look really nice
19:32 - and we have tiny blocks
19:37 - and we have these now this is to do a
19:40 - really big
19:41 - nice block so if i go in here like this
19:43 - and rotate it
19:44 - rotate it rotate it you can make a big
19:46 - block like that
19:48 - and then we've got kind of diagonal
19:50 - blocks
19:52 - hidden blocks these are really cunning
19:54 - you can hardly see the things
19:57 - um let me get rid of this one here and
20:00 - play this
20:02 - there we go you see so watch out for
20:06 - those who can put some nice hidden bits
20:07 - in the game with those
20:10 - um what else so number one key we had
20:13 - those i think then we've got some darker
20:14 - blocks
20:16 - body blocks and we got these blocks
20:18 - these are meant to be put underneath
20:21 - these meshes like this so they look
20:24 - like the ground has been squished
20:27 - [Music]
20:29 - okay so that's that's all the ones
20:31 - that's pretty much it you have just
20:32 - those
20:33 - number twos you have these darker blocks
20:36 - which are kind of used a bit of
20:37 - decoration
20:38 - you have the x's to stop mobs from
20:41 - getting through them
20:42 - and stop moving platforms half
20:45 - half stoppers this is a special block
20:49 - this one if i pop it say here
20:52 - what this means is don't let the screen
20:56 - scroll up while that's on the screen it
20:58 - doesn't go any higher than about the
21:00 - middle of the screen until
21:02 - you force it to by going really high
21:06 - down again
21:10 - so that way that way you can hide um
21:13 - secrets in the level are above this okay
21:16 - that's what that's for
21:18 - trigger blocks you've seen this
21:23 - what is this this is number two key
21:25 - still this is a hidden
21:26 - area so look if i was to drop a few of
21:29 - these down like this
21:31 - if i go down there look i actually
21:33 - dropped behind us into a secret area
21:35 - now this is useful for hiding coins and
21:38 - secrets
21:39 - so if i was to go into number five let's
21:42 - say coins apples
21:43 - so here's number five apple press that a
21:45 - few times
21:47 - and you'll find there we go i hid an
21:49 - apple if i put that
21:52 - in like this and pause it
21:55 - you'll see that the apples are hidden
21:56 - they can't see them
21:58 - and then oh yeah don't jump to that
22:02 - if i come down here they appear since i
22:04 - go into the secret area
22:06 - that way you can hide extra apples
22:08 - around the level
22:10 - okay what else can we find so we've done
22:14 - that we've done that mob we've looked at
22:16 - this one so we can say we can put this
22:18 - on any wall we like we can have it hang
22:19 - up and down here
22:21 - i do that just put some things we'd
22:24 - stand on and run it
22:25 - watch what happens it goes right off the
22:28 - end
22:29 - and flies away now why does it do that
22:31 - because this is going up down here so i
22:33 - need to put a little x on the end number
22:35 - two key
22:36 - that run it again and now it goes
22:40 - between those two points
22:42 - always useful to remember to put those
22:43 - in okay
22:46 - um number four key again what else have
22:48 - we got we've got bird
22:50 - bird likes to do mayhem two players if i
22:53 - just unpause that
22:55 - there he goes dropping bombs like nobody
22:57 - business
22:59 - and he'll always fly towards the player
23:01 - so from whichever side
23:03 - he is on i'm not sure we've done
23:07 - now this is more like a pop-tart eye you
23:09 - put that in how high you want it to go
23:11 - to
23:12 - like so and of course you have one there
23:15 - and then you need to press
23:16 - the um which key is it the
23:20 - yeah six key until you've oh that was it
23:24 - cyclone again there we go it's little
23:26 - pocket
23:27 - you put one of those underneath each eye
23:29 - like that
23:31 - um now if you just run that it should
23:34 - just work
23:35 - it will start in there they pop out the
23:38 - height that you set
23:41 - cool these can be put at any angle as
23:44 - well so you can take them
23:46 - and you can put one in like so
23:49 - put in this little pocket and run it
23:53 - [Music]
23:56 - and that just works beautifully okay
23:59 - let's just
23:59 - remove all those actually before we do
24:03 - go back one thing you might want to do
24:05 - um
24:07 - let me just put these in all the same
24:08 - height you can choose how
24:10 - long they take to re-pop out the ground
24:13 - if i put
24:13 - my mouse cursor over them press slash i
24:16 - can use the d
24:17 - key again for delay i have a delay of
24:20 - zero
24:20 - on that one a delay of
24:24 - five delay of 10
24:29 - and a delay of 20. okay so you can mouse
24:32 - over and see what they are set to
24:34 - if i run that time it takes for them
24:38 - to re-launch is now set by that
24:44 - delay
24:46 - okay so what else have we got these
24:49 - little chaps are
24:50 - nasty they just run at you like crazy
24:51 - little things just pop one down
24:54 - and they all just look at you like that
25:00 - okay and then we've got the big
25:03 - guy let's pop him in here just get rid
25:06 - of his eyes
25:08 - he just sits where he is until you get
25:11 - close
25:11 - does his flashy thing that's it
25:16 - um and let's see
25:20 - worms now they like to just um
25:24 - move around whatever you've put in a
25:26 - level so let's put in some
25:28 - blocks here like this
25:32 - okay
25:35 - and then back to our worm
25:38 - so put in the direction that you want
25:40 - him to be
25:42 - like this and now if we unpause
25:48 - they will kindly run around that shape
25:50 - for you
25:52 - and there is a uh that's four again
25:55 - there's one in the opposite direction
25:57 - so you can have them going against the
26:00 - direction of each other
26:03 - really good now there's a little trick
26:06 - with these guys
26:06 - i'll show you now so
26:10 - if i was to create a long line like so
26:14 - and there's four find the little guy
26:18 - i'll put one on this side and i'll put
26:20 - one on this side
26:22 - now if i start that off you'll see them
26:24 - all nicely perfectly timed with each
26:26 - other
26:28 - but this is not always the case if i
26:29 - come over here it started off
26:32 - and then come across there they're no
26:35 - longer in sync even though they were
26:36 - supposed to be opposite each
26:38 - other now why does that happen so the
26:41 - way that
26:41 - enemies work in apple is that as they
26:44 - are about to appear on screen
26:46 - as i walk along here they start moving
26:49 - but the other worm on the other side
26:50 - hasn't yet come near enough to the
26:52 - screen to actually be affected
26:53 - and spawn so by the time i come over
26:55 - here they're not in the same place
26:57 - anymore
26:58 - but i can get around that by using
27:00 - groups so if i slash
27:01 - press the slash key on that worm and do
27:03 - g3 for group three
27:06 - and slash on this one g3 again they're
27:09 - now both
27:09 - grouped together and now if i start the
27:13 - level
27:15 - the other worm automatically starts as
27:18 - soon as one worm starts the other one
27:19 - starts
27:20 - okay so what else have we got anymore
27:25 - we got this guy he's a big version of
27:27 - the red one
27:28 - the only difference being you can't kill
27:30 - this one
27:33 - and just bounce on his head um
27:37 - and that's all the enemies so what's
27:39 - number five so we've got apples to
27:40 - collect
27:41 - flag checkpoints um completely check
27:45 - flag checkpoints but we don't really use
27:46 - those um we've got the end
27:49 - of level you can only have one of these
27:51 - if i set one somewhere either one
27:53 - disappears
27:54 - and what's more the level stops
27:56 - scrolling once you reach it
27:57 - if i put one here and run the game
28:01 - i can no longer go further right than
28:02 - that so just remember that
28:06 - um hear me pressing here five so we've
28:09 - got apple with a down arrow now what's
28:11 - that for
28:13 - this is um let me come over here a bit
28:15 - more space
28:17 - if i wanted to put an apple on a lift
28:20 - so pressing one five
28:23 - six six key sorry uh and put a moving
28:26 - platform underneath
28:28 - i'll stop there moving that one from
28:30 - moving right further than that
28:32 - and start the game this apple
28:35 - likes to stay on top of that lift
28:39 - and it's the same for press the six key
28:42 - do it up and down lift
28:45 - i can put an apple on top of the lift in
28:47 - that case too
28:49 - and if it goes
28:51 - [Music]
28:52 - if i just used a normal apple
28:56 - the lift would have just gone through it
28:59 - so why don't i use normal um
29:01 - sorry these special apples all the time
29:03 - well because
29:04 - they use up a whole nother clone and you
29:06 - don't want to fill your level full of
29:08 - clones
29:09 - these apples are special and they don't
29:11 - use extra clones
29:12 - um so they're much better to use these
29:14 - apples whenever you can
29:15 - only use these apples for special cases
29:17 - where they need to be moving on top of
29:18 - an object
29:20 - okay so done those keys
29:23 - yep that's nice and easy stick a key in
29:25 - the level um
29:27 - and this guy is the spawn point so where
29:29 - the level i start so i could start a
29:31 - little just there if i wanted
29:32 - again you can only do one of those if
29:34 - you haven't got one he starts where
29:36 - he started on when i started level up
29:38 - originally um
29:40 - so if we had a key we need a door um
29:43 - where the doors i think they're under
29:44 - the six key
29:48 - there it is so i can pop those like that
29:52 - then uh let me just go i can't go
29:55 - through the door
29:56 - until i click the key and i can
30:02 - okay and that's all
30:06 - oh pop them the big apple you can only
30:09 - have one of these too there's always one
30:10 - of those to find on my level hidden away
30:12 - somewhere
30:14 - number six key i've got the lifts i've
30:16 - got these which are
30:17 - crumbling blocks so these act
30:20 - as normal blocks until they've been
30:24 - crumbled
30:25 - and lifts obey the blocking of those two
30:27 - which is quite cool
30:29 - and you can do all sorts with those
30:35 - number six key trampolines
30:39 - okay let's move through here to a
30:41 - trampoline
30:43 - how do these work simply place one and
30:46 - it just does its job
30:47 - and you can have all different angles of
30:50 - these
30:52 - like so um
30:56 - you can also affect how far they fling
30:58 - you so um
30:59 - if i go over here and press the slash
31:01 - key if i press
31:03 - a y code here for y up and down and give
31:06 - it a value of
31:07 - 30. now use it
31:10 - [Music]
31:13 - so it's taking about this high at the
31:14 - moment let's put a block in there
31:16 - [Music]
31:17 - so let's try a one a y of 40 instead
31:25 - okay so that's much more springy
31:28 - and if you really want you can make it
31:30 - go sideways as well at the same time so
31:32 - you'd give it a y of 40 and an x of say
31:35 - five
31:38 - let's just give that a go
31:41 - see that now takes me slightly to the
31:43 - side as well
31:44 - so you can make these kind of take you
31:46 - somewhere it's quite fun so if i
31:48 - just jump on that again a second it's
31:51 - taking me to about here it's
31:53 - let's give that a go
31:57 - really taking me too far to the side i
32:00 - need to kind of
32:01 - i don't know if that'll do it
32:03 - [Music]
32:05 - almost there we go straight on top so
32:08 - you could like line things up to clever
32:10 - things
32:11 - um and the same for this one here you
32:13 - could give it a a
32:15 - y value to make it move you up more or x
32:17 - value of
32:18 - much more to take you further to the
32:20 - light
32:22 - okay six key again
32:26 - yes you've got the pop-tart we've got
32:28 - the crumbly blocks ah
32:29 - so this conveyor belt and you just drop
32:32 - them in you can see the direction it's
32:33 - gonna
32:34 - take you in on your arrow the six again
32:36 - it takes you the left-hand one
32:39 - like that and you can rotate these
32:47 - they take you wherever they go and i can
32:49 - stick to the wall
32:50 - stick to the ceiling and they can take
32:52 - you in all different places
32:56 - okay what else
33:00 - i think that's all of them sixes so that
33:03 - take us through everything so look so
33:04 - we've done the ones
33:06 - then the twos decorations three the
33:08 - spikes
33:09 - fours are enemies fives are collectibles
33:12 - flags
33:13 - keys spawn points sixes are moving
33:16 - platforms crumblings trampolines
33:18 - and conveyor belts doors seven
33:23 - seven is a boss now boss i haven't
33:25 - actually put into the game
33:26 - but you can use him if you want you have
33:28 - to put him down on some level
33:30 - and then you have to make sure that he's
33:31 - contained
33:33 - like so um and
33:37 - yeah have a go you can have a go if you
33:38 - want but he's not meant to be there so i
33:41 - wouldn't use him in your levels if i
33:42 - were you
33:43 - and i think that pretty much counts for
33:46 - everything
33:47 - um so you're able to then save your game
33:51 - and when you've saved it go to the forum
33:54 - and post it for other people to play
33:56 - with and enjoy
33:58 - i can't wait to see what you create with
34:01 - this um i had a great fun creating my
34:03 - nine levels
34:04 - and uh it's quite interesting to see
34:06 - different people's designs
34:08 - and takes and the clever mechanics you
34:10 - can make by combining all of the
34:11 - different elements that apple has
34:13 - in store for you well i do hope you're
34:16 - going to enjoy this
34:17 - i am really enjoying it and i just i
34:19 - cannot wait to see what you make to post
34:21 - them on the forum
34:22 - and i'm going to play them and i'm sure
34:23 - everybody else will too um
34:25 - and who knows maybe i'll take some of
34:26 - the best levels and add them to the game
34:28 - or a new version of the game we can all
34:31 - play
34:32 - together later so thank you for watching
34:34 - do subscribe
34:35 - um love this video and see you on
34:37 - scratch guys
