00:00 - [Music]
00:01 - hello fellow scratchers I'm Griff batch
00:05 - and today I'm going to teach you how to
00:06 - make a scratch game and not just any
00:09 - game robtop's hugely popular Geometry
00:12 - Dash in his first episode we'll cover
00:14 - how to draw the classic Geometry Dash
00:16 - character and use scratch's block coding
00:18 - language to bring them to life but the
00:21 - fun really begins when we combine that
00:23 - thumping soundtrack with a custom design
00:25 - level that anyone can create all within
00:27 - scratch itself what's more I've got a
00:30 - brilliant trick to teach you to create
00:32 - that awesome Geometry Dash style side
00:34 - scrolling effect and it only requires
00:37 - two clones so cool are you ready for
00:40 - this guys let's get scratching
00:44 - We Begin by creating a new project this
00:47 - is Geometry Dash in scratch so scratch's
00:51 - projects always begin with a cat Sprite
00:53 - named Sprite one and clicking into the
00:56 - costume editor we find two cat costumes
00:59 - already drawn ignore these for now and
01:02 - click here to paint a brand new costume
01:05 - for that classic Geometry Dash character
01:07 - we'll use the rectangle tool and pick a
01:11 - yellow fill but keep the Border black
01:14 - with a width of four pixels
01:17 - the canvas area represents a full game
01:19 - screen so since the player needs to be
01:22 - small we'll zoom in until we can see the
01:24 - center point of the drawing canvas and
01:27 - can still count out four squares
01:29 - diagonally up and left off center
01:32 - now begin drawing from there and while
01:35 - still dragging you'll find if we hold
01:37 - down the shift key the shape becomes a
01:40 - perfect square useful to know and I have
01:43 - loads more tips where that came from
01:45 - Once done check the size of our costume
01:48 - here on the left we are aiming or a 34
01:51 - by 34 pixel size if you need to shrink
01:54 - the player down a touch then do that now
01:56 - lastly to allow the player to rotate
01:59 - beautifully later on not like this we
02:02 - must drag the entire shape and let it
02:05 - snap to the center point on the canvas
02:07 - you see that that fixes the problem so
02:10 - you should do it now
02:11 - great so we can go to town making this
02:14 - player our own a few extra rectangles
02:16 - makes all the difference awesome I love
02:20 - that I'm now going to tidy up and delete
02:22 - those old cat costumes sorry scratchy we
02:25 - won't be needing you in this tutorial
02:27 - okay what really makes Geometry Dash
02:30 - stand out from other jumping games is
02:32 - its fantastic music tracks if we click
02:35 - into the sounds Tab and then on the
02:38 - choose a sound option we can see what
02:41 - scratch has to offer Us in the way of
02:42 - Music a filter by Loops then we can no
02:47 - no gosh no
02:50 - ah right now you're talking dance
02:54 - energetic has some punch to it but it's
02:56 - only a short clip so it will need
02:59 - looping click into the code Tab and
03:01 - we'll drop in our first simple coding
03:03 - blocks when flag clicked this triggers
03:06 - code to run when the game begins forever
03:09 - this control block tells scratch to keep
03:12 - running the same script over and over
03:14 - again then under the sounds category
03:16 - there's a start sound and a play sound
03:19 - until done block we want the until done
03:22 - one so that the full sound is played
03:24 - before it tries to start over again
03:26 - click on the green flag icon and our
03:29 - short music Loop begins to play and
03:31 - hopefully when it usually would end the
03:33 - forever Loop starts it all over again
03:35 - awesome that would indeed do the trick
03:38 - but what if we prefer to have a longer
03:42 - more unique music track like those used
03:44 - from the original Geometry Dash well
03:47 - fear not we can easily import music of
03:49 - our own into scratch or Source tracks
03:52 - from other scratch projects for example
03:55 - just open another scratch window and
03:57 - search for Geometry Dash music in the
04:00 - scratch search bar there are literally
04:02 - hundreds of projects that already
04:04 - contain the music we are looking for
04:06 - looking at Sprite and there it is Stereo
04:09 - Madness
04:10 - we just open our backpacks found at the
04:12 - bottom of the screen and drag the
04:15 - desired music track down there
04:17 - then back in our scratch game we open
04:20 - the backpack and drag the music track
04:22 - into Sprite one like so easy right okay
04:25 - Tidy Up by deleting those unwanted
04:28 - sounds and moving back into the code we
04:30 - have to remember to update the play
04:32 - block to use the new sound we just
04:35 - imported yeah that is brilliant but hold
04:38 - on we can't just use music or Graphics
04:41 - from a real game without giving credit
04:43 - so switch to the project page view and
04:46 - enter stereo Madness soundtrack by Rob
04:49 - top games thank you rob top you Legends
04:53 - now back to business before we go on to
04:57 - look at designing a scrolling level I
04:59 - know so cool let's add some basic
05:01 - jumping scripts when the space key is
05:04 - pressed we want to quickly move the
05:06 - player up and down again but not
05:08 - instantly gradually over time so repeat
05:12 - 10 times we want to change y by 10. this
05:17 - will move the player upwards by 10
05:19 - pixels that's quite small 10 times in a
05:22 - row creating a short animation and what
05:25 - goes up in this case won't come back
05:28 - down not unless we tell it so duplicate
05:31 - that repeat script but change y This
05:33 - Time by negative 10 minus 10. changing y
05:37 - by a negative number always moves the
05:40 - Sprite downwards you don't even need to
05:43 - run the project to test this just click
05:45 - out of the change Y block and then as
05:47 - soon as we press the space bar yay nice
05:50 - the player jumps but if you think that's
05:53 - good wait until the next episode where
05:55 - we'll make this way way more cool
05:58 - but let's not get carried away we have
06:01 - much to do before then it's a good time
06:03 - to give Sprite one an official name so
06:05 - rename it player and now let's make a
06:09 - start on our Geometry Dash level yeah
06:12 - click into the staged Sprite and into
06:15 - the backdrop costume tab this is where
06:18 - we get to choose or Draw other fancy
06:20 - backdrop that sits behind all the
06:22 - Sprites in our game but for a scrolling
06:24 - game it's not actually so useful because
06:27 - backdrops are static they cannot be
06:29 - moved around or scrolled what we can do
06:32 - though is lay down a nice purple
06:34 - rectangle as a simple wallpaper that
06:36 - will sit behind our game
06:39 - now the actual Geometry Dash level
06:41 - requires a new Sprite of their own so
06:44 - click to paint a new Sprite like so
06:47 - and what we need is a floor
06:50 - using the rectangle tool again I'll
06:52 - choose a more Vivid purple so turn up
06:55 - the saturation a touch and make it a tad
06:57 - darker then make sure to set the Border
07:00 - width to zero it's important that the
07:02 - edges are left as a solid color
07:05 - now the rectangle we draw must be quite
07:07 - low down to give us plenty of space for
07:09 - our game it must also cover the entire
07:12 - width of the inner canvas and I'd advise
07:15 - you overlap each Edge just that tiniest
07:18 - bit this will help us avoid getting
07:20 - those ugly seams showing up later on
07:22 - talking of which you'll notice things
07:25 - are not looking lined up in the stage
07:27 - view now don't worry we can easily drag
07:29 - Sprites around on there but better still
07:32 - we can accurately position them by
07:34 - setting their X and Y to zero using
07:36 - these controls below the stage great
07:39 - that's perfectly aligned now good work
07:41 - want to decorate the level further sure
07:44 - thing go to town I'm adding a more Vivid
07:46 - rectangle and then quickly creating
07:48 - copies by holding down the ALT key and
07:52 - dragging the shape
07:53 - better still hold down shift 2 and the
07:56 - new shape remains horizontally aligned
07:58 - to the initial shape so everything looks
08:00 - extra smart that's another neat trick
08:03 - alt and then shift
08:05 - and one more thing this wouldn't be
08:07 - Geometry Dash without the white line
08:09 - across the top of the floor using the
08:11 - line tool with the width set to 4 and
08:14 - again holding the shift key to keep the
08:16 - Hawaiian horizontal we can draw out such
08:19 - a line do keep using the shift key trick
08:22 - as you don't want this line to be
08:23 - anything but straight across lastly
08:26 - using the selection tool I could select
08:29 - the line and nudge it up and down using
08:32 - the arrow keys on my keyboard to move it
08:34 - into exactly the right place okay that's
08:38 - looking great all except that my player
08:40 - is floating hold on you can't move
08:43 - Sprites when in full screen mode click
08:45 - back inside and then drag them until
08:48 - they sit nicely on the floor somewhere
08:50 - over to the left side of the screen is
08:52 - perfect and oh my this is looking so
08:55 - Geometry Dash right we gotta get this
08:58 - floor scrolling name the Sprite level
09:01 - and then click back into its coding tab
09:05 - when flag clicked so in a scrolling game
09:09 - the player doesn't move forever block
09:11 - instead the level does so change X by
09:16 - and since negative numbers move things
09:19 - left we can try negative two
09:23 - oh gosh that is way too slow try perhaps
09:26 - negative 10.
09:28 - ah now we're not seeing anything here
09:31 - because the level has already moved
09:33 - fully left we need to reset the position
09:35 - back to the right before the game begins
09:37 - we can do that with a go to X Y block
09:41 - before the forever Loop and change it to
09:43 - be an X of zero and a y of zero that's
09:45 - the center of the screen that's nice and
09:48 - Speedy now but although we are moving it
09:51 - left forever do you notice how it's
09:53 - actually getting stuck on the left edge
09:55 - of the screen and this is known as
09:57 - Sprite fencing in scratch and it can
10:00 - actually be very useful but right now
10:02 - and often is the case not so much
10:05 - luckily there's an easy workaround back
10:09 - in the costume editor we simply draw a
10:11 - long rectangle below the visible area of
10:14 - the canvas see this will be off screen
10:15 - but also wider than the visible level
10:18 - overhanging at the left and right Edge
10:20 - this extra width all scratch into
10:22 - allowing the Sprite to move further off
10:25 - screen than it otherwise could and that
10:27 - is all we need to do to make the magic
10:28 - happen what a great start but obviously
10:32 - as the level costume Scrolls off to the
10:34 - left we are now in need of a new costume
10:37 - or Sprite to scroll in from the right to
10:40 - take its place in theory we could line
10:42 - up a whole sequence of these level
10:44 - Sprites to construct an entire level but
10:47 - using all these large Sprites can be
10:49 - costly and we might even run out of
10:51 - resources so how about we scrap all but
10:54 - two of the Sprites and simply cycle them
10:57 - around over and over again to create the
11:00 - illusion of an infinite level
11:03 - to code this up let's focus on just one
11:06 - of the level Sprites we need to know
11:08 - that scratch's screen is 480 pixels wide
11:12 - therefore when a level Sprite has moved
11:14 - left by negative 480 we will need to
11:18 - move it back over to the right by not
11:21 - just 480 but twice that
11:24 - 960. then it will be ready to come back
11:27 - in from the right to complete the effect
11:30 - let's do this we are already scrolling
11:33 - left we just need a conditional if block
11:36 - and a less than check
11:39 - if the new X position of the Sprite is
11:43 - now less than negative 480 then we want
11:47 - to move it back to the right by 960.
11:52 - if all our calculations are correct then
11:54 - this should look pretty cool run the
11:56 - project
11:57 - and that is very smooth we have the
12:00 - first level Sprite in place we just need
12:03 - a second one to join in to fill that Gap
12:06 - so we could create a physical second
12:08 - level Sprite but that would begin to
12:10 - complicate our level design and
12:12 - scripting instead we'll keep one Sprite
12:15 - but create a second copy through code
12:18 - using clones to demonstrate this in the
12:22 - costume editor name the First costume
12:25 - level
12:26 - 1.1 it's the first level of the game and
12:29 - is the First costume of the level
12:32 - and then right click and duplicate the
12:35 - costume as level 1.2 perfect the second
12:39 - costume we do well to draw a small
12:42 - square at the top so that we can tell
12:43 - the two costumes apart right are you
12:46 - ready separate off the forever Loop
12:49 - script but keep it handy we'll need it
12:51 - again
12:52 - then under the control category find the
12:55 - create clone of myself block this will
12:58 - literally create a copy of the Sprite
13:01 - exactly as it is right now and we can
13:05 - have the Clone run our scrolling script
13:07 - here by dropping in a when I start as a
13:10 - clone hat block and then attach them
13:11 - together like so
13:13 - should we give that a test
13:15 - okay so that doesn't look great but we
13:18 - can see the scrolling clone behind the
13:21 - original Sprite Which is no longer
13:23 - scrolling for Simplicity it'd be best to
13:26 - hide that original Sprite so drop a hide
13:28 - Block in before the Clone is created
13:33 - and then remember to show the Clone
13:35 - Sprite before it starts to scroll
13:38 - Let's test that again green flag time
13:40 - and now things are back to normal only
13:43 - having made the switch to use clones the
13:46 - next step of adding a second clone is
13:48 - super easy make sure the first clone
13:51 - though is switch to use costume level
13:53 - 1.1 prior to being cloned and then we
13:57 - can prepare our second clone we want to
13:59 - start on costume two so drop in a next
14:02 - costume block
14:04 - also it will begin 480 pixels to the
14:07 - right of the first level Sprite so
14:09 - change X by 480.
14:12 - and that's it we can create a clone of
14:15 - myself to make it official guys are you
14:17 - ready for this hit that green flag oh
14:20 - joy look at what we have created a
14:23 - beautiful infinite scrolling background
14:25 - composed of both the first and second
14:27 - costumes of this level cycling around
14:30 - and around forever this is really neat
14:32 - and there are so many uses for this but
14:35 - I can't wait to add some obstacles for
14:38 - the player to actually jump over then it
14:40 - will start to feel like a real game
14:42 - perhaps a deadly ground Spike we can
14:45 - remove that random hovering square and
14:48 - begin by drawing a black Square holding
14:51 - shift for that perfect shape we could
14:53 - perhaps do with seeing how big this
14:54 - looks on the stage click show to make it
14:57 - visible ah but we also need to ensure
14:59 - it's moved into view with an X and Y of
15:02 - 0 0.
15:03 - whoa that's much too big
15:06 - Now to create a triangle we can use the
15:10 - shaping tool simply select one corner
15:12 - and click delete there you go
15:16 - now to fix the rotation use a select
15:19 - tool and while rotating hold that magic
15:22 - shift key once more and it constrains to
15:24 - 45 degree angles perfecto
15:27 - just reduce its width and to complete
15:29 - that Geometry Dash aesthetic give it a
15:32 - white border again with a width of 4
15:34 - pixels looking really cool indeed but
15:38 - alas this coloring actually causes us a
15:41 - slight problem to detect when the player
15:43 - touches a hazardous part of our level
15:45 - like a spike we could really do with it
15:48 - being a unique color hmm yeah in
15:52 - Geometry Dash everything is black and
15:54 - white so to differentiate them we'll
15:56 - have to cheat a little we'll keep the
15:58 - level borders white but change the spike
16:01 - outline to be a very pale yellow with
16:04 - perhaps a saturation just above eight or
16:07 - so to ensure it remains detectable
16:10 - okay that looks acceptable to me let's
16:13 - see if we can detect a collision using
16:15 - that color
16:16 - click back into the player Sprite and
16:18 - we'll need a new when flag clicked hat
16:21 - block
16:24 - then simply wait until
16:27 - with touching a color
16:30 - oh bother the spike is no longer visible
16:32 - on the stage quickly click back into the
16:35 - level Sprite and make it visible again
16:37 - and set X back to zero there it is and
16:41 - while we're here and to avoid having to
16:43 - keep setting this X to Zero manually why
16:46 - don't we drop in a go to XY 0 0 after we
16:50 - create the second clone here nice that
16:53 - will make things easier going forward
16:55 - so back into the player Sprite
16:57 - now we can see the spike so let's set
17:00 - the Collision color that we're waiting
17:01 - for
17:02 - the Color Picker lets us select it
17:04 - directly from the stage but you have to
17:06 - be careful to pick the right part
17:09 - Splendid that looks about right so when
17:13 - we finally Collide from the control
17:15 - category drop in a stop all block it
17:18 - will be game over Dude run the project
17:21 - and we'll give it a test
17:23 - if the color matches and yes it
17:26 - certainly does then the game ends a good
17:29 - test indeed but it's really not the
17:31 - snazzy Geometry Dash ending we were all
17:34 - hoping for why does the entire level
17:36 - disappear do you know well it's because
17:39 - when a scratch project stops scratch
17:41 - deletes all the Clones so all our level
17:44 - clones vanish in that case rather than
17:47 - literally ending the game how about we
17:49 - force the level to stop scrolling
17:51 - instead for this we'll need extra
17:54 - control over the scrolling this is a
17:56 - good opportunity for a scratch variable
17:58 - naming it scroll speed and leave it for
18:02 - all Sprites
18:04 - click the ok to confirm so when the game
18:07 - begins set this new variable scroll
18:09 - speed
18:11 - 2 negative 10.
18:13 - you'll see that if we click into the
18:15 - level Sprite now that negative 10 is
18:18 - also the amount that we're changing X by
18:20 - to scroll the level in that case it
18:23 - should make no difference to replace the
18:25 - negative 10 with a copy of the scroll
18:27 - speed variable we can run the project
18:30 - and confirm that this indeed makes no
18:32 - difference whatsoever so why bother with
18:35 - that variable at all aha click back into
18:38 - the players right now we can control the
18:41 - scrolling using this variable so instead
18:44 - of stopping the entire project we'll
18:46 - switch this to only stop other scripts
18:49 - in this Sprite that will stop the
18:52 - forever Loop that is playing our music
18:53 - track but it won't prevent the continued
18:56 - scrolling of the level
18:58 - but now if we use a repeat 10 we can
19:02 - then bring the scrolling speed to a
19:04 - gradual stop by changing scroll speed by
19:07 - one the result is a smooth but quick
19:10 - deceleration of the scrolling speed to a
19:13 - complete standstill with a scroll speed
19:15 - of zero I love it now we just need to
19:19 - get the player to stop sliding after
19:21 - impact and instead stop dead in their
19:23 - tracks no problem first we need to
19:26 - ensure our player Begins the game in
19:28 - their current fixed position go to XY
19:31 - and it should pre-populate with our
19:33 - current and the correct X and Y position
19:36 - next within the repeat 10 once the game
19:38 - is over we want to scroll the player
19:41 - like we do the level so change X by and
19:44 - drop in the same scroll speed variable
19:46 - can it be that easy
19:49 - and do you see how the Collision now
19:51 - carries us back along with the level
19:53 - rather than plunging on through as
19:55 - before man this is really coming
19:57 - together really awesome what do you guys
20:00 - think
20:01 - I'm feeling a collision sound would make
20:03 - this even better click into the sounds
20:05 - tab of the player Sprite and search up a
20:07 - new sound under the effects filter
20:11 - and here's the Bonk sound effect we can
20:15 - start playing it right after stopping
20:17 - the other scripts but before we begin
20:19 - the slowed down animation and see how
20:22 - we're starting to play it now rather
20:23 - than waiting until it's finished
20:25 - oh man yeah that's horrid and perfect at
20:29 - the same time so funny well this episode
20:33 - is almost done can you tell but hold on
20:36 - I can't help but think the level is just
20:38 - a bit too boring to stop here with just
20:41 - the same single Spike repeating over and
20:44 - over again huh can we not add new level
20:47 - costumes and have them included in the
20:49 - sequence of scrolling scenes we can test
20:52 - this by having one and then two and then
20:54 - three spikes in a row
20:56 - but the answer at present is no we still
21:00 - only see the same two costumes repeating
21:02 - over and over but don't worry the
21:05 - solution is super easy whenever we cycle
21:09 - at level Sprite back around we also can
21:12 - skip it Forward by two costumes then
21:15 - working as a pair the two clone Sprites
21:18 - can now recreate any arbitrary Long
