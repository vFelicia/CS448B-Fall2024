00:00 - foreign
00:03 - scratchers and welcome to this scratch
00:06 - Junior challenge yes apparently this is
00:09 - a thing where scratchers forgo the
00:11 - comparative power of scratch and attempt
00:13 - to recreate the ever popular flappy bird
00:16 - in scratch's little baby brother scratch
00:18 - Junior and here are a few examples of
00:21 - what I've seen the question people have
00:23 - been asking is if Griff patch use
00:25 - scratch Junior could he do any better
00:29 - well challenge accepted so flappy bird
00:34 - not the most complex game and I'm
00:36 - thinking if I can make the graphics look
00:38 - good then the game will just follow so
00:40 - what do we have we got these Sprites on
00:43 - the left script below the main game
00:46 - stage and the backdrop at the top
00:47 - perhaps yeah it's a little different to
00:50 - scratch 3 for sure the lack of color
00:52 - choices in the palette is a tiny bit
00:54 - worrying but let's see how this plays
00:56 - out Flappy is played portrait so these
00:59 - guys will help me keep within the game
01:01 - bounce and then a few more guides for
01:03 - the road bushes and clouds
01:06 - now mostly with ovals let's draw these
01:09 - clouds
01:10 - and I quite enjoy using that fill tool
01:12 - pop pop very cloud-like I love it the
01:15 - buildings are going to be a lot more
01:17 - fiddly rectangles this time and for many
01:21 - hours of pain I learned a neat trick
01:23 - that shapes positioned on top of other
01:26 - shapes can be manipulated as a group so
01:29 - if I clone stamp the whole rectangle
01:31 - oops not the cloud there that makes it
01:34 - so much easier you've no idea so the
01:38 - grassy Hills many more ovals I guess
01:41 - just gotta remember to draw these from
01:43 - Back to Front another lesson learned is
01:45 - that it is really difficult to change
01:48 - the order later on so get it right first
01:50 - time or else hide the bottom of the
01:53 - hills using a field rectangle and then
01:56 - layer on more ovals
01:58 - and that final rectangle yeah this is
02:01 - looking surprisingly good don't you
02:03 - think
02:04 - so all this will be static without any
02:07 - movement but the floor area down here
02:09 - wants to scroll sounds simple enough how
02:12 - hard can it be I'll use a new Sprite
02:15 - just like in scratch and draw out the
02:17 - floor we want that nice diagonal stripe
02:20 - pattern across the top so I'll just have
02:22 - to hand draw those using lines only
02:25 - scratch junior is doing its darndest to
02:27 - get in the way joining up the lines
02:29 - where I don't want oh man now it's done
02:33 - something really naughty filled the
02:35 - outline of the shape behind I didn't
02:37 - even know you could do that with this
02:38 - tool oh well you can always learn
02:40 - something new from our mistakes anyhow
02:43 - change of plan I'll use the Clone tool
02:46 - and I'll space them out more
02:49 - a few moments later good enough just
02:52 - touching them up with some filled
02:54 - rectangle highlights and shadows
02:58 - ah okay so these Sprite costumes are
03:00 - apparently only half the width of the
03:02 - stage that's unfortunate I guess I'll
03:04 - need two of these Sprites to fill the
03:06 - entire floor
03:07 - but before that let's make it scroll do
03:10 - we have a Wen green flag click block aha
03:14 - there's the little beauty what a
03:16 - reassuring sight and we'll move left yep
03:19 - but wait what are the units is it pixels
03:22 - hmm try 20 and smash that green flag
03:27 - whoa I did not see that coming that is
03:30 - not a scratch move block it functions
03:33 - more like a Glide block apparently and
03:35 - it wraps around and stops exactly where
03:38 - it began very curious I need a moment to
03:41 - understand this uh hold on soon after
03:45 - okay I found a clue we can turn on a
03:48 - helpful grid View and this reveals the
03:51 - stage is exactly 20 grid cells wide the
03:54 - exact amount I happen to pick to move by
03:57 - hold on then that's really restrictive
04:00 - scratch has 480 possible expositions and
04:03 - scratch junior is limited to 20. gosh
04:07 - um is this game actually going to be
04:09 - possible
04:11 - right I need two of these floor Sprites
04:13 - to cover the entire width of the screen
04:15 - is there a clone block I wish we just
04:18 - have to create a new Sprite luckily we
04:20 - can choose to copy the costume from a
04:22 - previous instance don't ask me why they
04:25 - look Blank That's confused me no end too
04:28 - oh what something has gone wrong the
04:31 - costume is way off center and has issues
04:33 - one nice thing is that we can easily
04:36 - copy code scripts between supplies good
04:39 - job too because we need them so this one
04:41 - could go on the left and hold on hold on
04:45 - the diagonal stripes are reversed what's
04:48 - going on one
04:51 - eternity later okay so it turns out when
04:54 - you move a Sprite to the left or right
04:55 - it flips to face the direction it moved
04:57 - there's no way though to turn that off
04:59 - but not to worry because both grounds
05:02 - will eventually move the same way and so
05:05 - they'll be flipped the same direction I
05:07 - thought I was going mad
05:08 - cool so I need this floor movement to
05:11 - Loop forever
05:13 - no forever Loop
05:15 - aha yes this looks like the bee's knees
05:19 - Perfecto well almost there's a gap let
05:24 - me just
05:25 - oh this editor no stretch
05:29 - yes got it and I'm thinking this will
05:32 - look great as soon as we add in some
05:34 - filled sidebar Blanca Sprites to cover
05:36 - up the edges of the screen
05:38 - sizing it up and there we need another
05:42 - one for the opposite side though but I'm
05:44 - having trouble getting it into the
05:45 - position it's because it's flipped after
05:48 - I moved it again ah I didn't learn from
05:50 - my mistake
05:52 - there this is marvelous there's nothing
05:55 - wrong with this at all 10 points for
05:57 - Griff patch and it only took a couple of
05:59 - hours to get to this point
06:01 - now to tackle the Flappy Bird themselves
06:05 - please don't end up looking cursed
06:08 - [Music]
06:18 - voila not so shabby All Things
06:21 - Considered so on the title screen of
06:24 - this game Flappy wants to just hover up
06:26 - and down a little at present they are
06:28 - looking more like a bird torpedo problem
06:31 - is we're limited to these grid squares
06:33 - of movement I'll try the smallest up and
06:36 - down movement possible forever
06:39 - um yeah that's janky we can't move less
06:43 - but perhaps if we could slow the motion
06:45 - down is that possible aha what's this a
06:49 - speed block slow medium or fast I
06:52 - presume switching to medium
06:54 - and this is somewhat better the
06:56 - transition is a tad harsh but Beggars
06:59 - can't be choosers and I am most pleased
07:01 - with the overall look thus far next up
07:04 - we need to detect user input clicking to
07:07 - start the game and to activate a jump
07:09 - the best I think we can do is have an
07:11 - on-screen button to tap on for
07:13 - convenience it can be added as part of
07:15 - the right hand blanker Sprite
07:17 - great so when the button is first
07:19 - pressed I'm going to switch to a brand
07:21 - new scene to keep our coding as clean as
07:23 - possible scratch Junior's scenes are not
07:25 - at all the same as scratch 3 as no
07:28 - Sprites are shared between them so we
07:30 - have to copy both the scene backdrop and
07:33 - every Sprite one at a time from the
07:35 - first scene like so
07:37 - okay this looks good now to introduce
07:40 - the bane of flappy bird life those pesky
07:43 - pipes something like this to see if it's
07:47 - the right size
07:48 - yeah not bad just a small change and I
07:51 - think we are on to a winner it'll look
07:54 - great when we shade it in
07:56 - [Music]
08:00 - one hour later wow ridiculously time
08:04 - consuming and intensely satisfying just
08:06 - like Flappy Bird for the lower tube I
08:09 - guess I can just rotate oh no no not
08:12 - like that just copy it and there now I'm
08:15 - a bit worried about making a mistake
08:17 - adjusting these costumes so I'll make a
08:19 - new copy now
08:21 - foreign
08:22 - hold on what's that mysterious dot is it
08:27 - a smudge on my monitor I can't select it
08:29 - or delete it and yet weird of
08:31 - weirdnesses if I draw around it I can
08:34 - move it with my Square what
08:36 - never mind I'll sort it later
08:38 - [Music]
08:40 - no now the end of my pipe is messed up
08:43 - for goodness sake fine delete that and
08:46 - clone again seriously this is not rocket
08:48 - science guys
08:50 - there one complete pipe complete with
08:53 - curved pixel but out of sight out of
08:55 - mind
08:56 - perfect
08:57 - the pipes will begin over to the right
09:00 - eventually Behind These side panels and
09:03 - when the flag is clicked hmm is that
09:06 - right there's no when seen start option
09:08 - so I'm guessing we still use the green
09:11 - flag
09:12 - now we'll pause for some number I have
09:15 - no idea what that is seconds I don't
09:17 - know then repeatedly Loop the pipes
09:19 - movement a little setup though I think I
09:22 - want to quickly make sure the pipe is
09:23 - visible and then at the normal Pace move
09:26 - the pipe across the screen to the left
09:28 - using this
09:29 - oh no I don't believe it the costume has
09:33 - flipped again why scratch Junior why
09:36 - would you do this to me now I've got to
09:38 - switch the whole pipe around the other
09:40 - way what a waste of time three hours
09:44 - later okay so moving 20 grid squares to
09:47 - the left for a complete circuit
09:50 - you know all that change of speed was
09:52 - Overkill we can probably do without that
09:56 - now that's nice I'll just up that to 99
09:59 - repeats and pop in an extra weight 20 so
10:02 - the same pipes don't show up again too
10:04 - quickly
10:05 - now to spice things up we need more
10:08 - pipes and at different heights
10:10 - so a new Sprite copied from the latest
10:12 - costume copy the script size Urban
10:15 - position but change the initial delay so
10:18 - that the pipe appears a little later on
10:20 - than the first finding the best time is
10:22 - a matter of trial and error
10:24 - [Music]
10:28 - and there I have plugged for 17 and that
10:31 - appears to work well
10:32 - just going to nudge the costume upwards
10:34 - and that curved pixel foreign
10:37 - hey look at this beautiful yay and
10:40 - there's just enough Gap to fit in one
10:42 - more pair of pipes I believe obviously
10:44 - we could go on and on making even more
10:46 - pipes with a longer delay across the
10:48 - board but for now this will do fine
10:51 - so to get these pipes behind the floor
10:54 - Sprites just hold down on a Sprite to
10:56 - bring it to the front and the sidebars
10:59 - too
11:00 - smash the green flag yes yes no oh the
11:05 - second floor Sprite this is a pain to
11:07 - bring it to the front I'm gonna have to
11:09 - move these other things right out of the
11:10 - way and there we go reset everything
11:13 - else back careful does it and look at
11:17 - this can you believe this is scratch
11:19 - Junior really yeah now I'm getting
11:22 - rather excited but truly the fun is just
11:25 - beginning we want to activate a jump
11:27 - when the player clicks the jump button
11:29 - when the right blank is bright including
11:31 - the button that is clicked a broadcast
11:34 - message now there's no names in scratch
11:36 - Junior just colors so I'll pick a very
11:38 - Flappy yellow
11:39 - then in the bird Sprite
11:41 - whoa there hold on I've made a blunder
11:45 - I'm coding the game script in the first
11:47 - scene
11:48 - pants how did this happen I thought I'd
11:50 - added the pipes only to the second scene
11:52 - okay so quick fix up finish copying
11:56 - those committing Sprites uh the sidebars
11:59 - and then reverse the scene order and
12:01 - we're good as new the first scene has no
12:03 - pipes and when the jump button is
12:05 - clicked we actually just change to scene
12:08 - two game on dudes we can see this in
12:11 - action no pipes are coming in scene one
12:14 - click the jump button and bring it on we
12:16 - are in the game brilliant I don't like
12:19 - that tacky black line there though is
12:22 - that in the backdrop be gone you
12:24 - guideline
12:25 - so this is it we must get Flappy Bird
12:28 - jumping it should be simple but I'm
12:31 - rather dreading it due to the limited
12:33 - scratch blocks available we trigger off
12:35 - the yellow jump event and hold the phone
12:37 - do mine eyes deceive me or does scratch
12:40 - Junior have a jump block built in hmm
12:42 - wow initially this looks good but it
12:45 - could be faster
12:47 - yes much better but there is a problem
12:50 - the jump curve is great but the motion
12:53 - stops abruptly at the same height as it
12:55 - began we need it to continue downwards
12:58 - like this perhaps
13:00 - no perhaps faster
13:07 - okay better but still not perfect and as
13:10 - it turns out using this block leads to a
13:12 - whole world of pain when more jumps are
13:15 - strung together so what else is possible
13:17 - how about we build a movement by hand
13:20 - fast upwards by two squares
13:23 - and this still looks too slow to me but
13:25 - this is the fastest we can set it to
13:28 - the only thing I can think to do is to
13:30 - try using two scripts at once moving up
13:33 - at the same time is that possible
13:36 - yes yes it is and by only moving one
13:39 - block in the second move the movement
13:41 - starts fast and then slows down a touch
13:44 - so that is a real neat trick to finish
13:47 - the jump we might try pausing just for
13:49 - one and then at a medium pace begin back
13:52 - down before at full Pace once more drop
13:55 - right down to the ground
13:57 - so how does this look
14:00 - yeah now it's not as smooth as the jump
14:03 - block but it is under our control man I
14:06 - can tell you this game is going to be
14:08 - really tough to play ha it would be game
14:11 - over for me all the time I wonder if I
14:14 - can improve that jumping script at all
14:15 - let's just try a few things
14:17 - now without the second jump oh no that
14:20 - is awful put that back in and just
14:23 - confirming the built-in jump isn't
14:24 - better at all
14:27 - oh no really that is really isn't I'm
14:30 - thinking perhaps I should try removing
14:32 - the weight at the top of the jump Arc
14:33 - and I must put back in that second jump
14:36 - script okay now this is something yeah
14:39 - yeah I think this is it
14:41 - so before we add the final Collision
14:44 - detection and prove just how bad at this
14:46 - game I really am I'd love to get the
14:49 - bird tilt upwards as they jump
14:53 - yes oh magical oh this oh oh oh this is
14:58 - actually hilarious this has gone
15:00 - horribly wrong but I love it I did worry
15:03 - this might happen because we don't have
15:05 - a way to reset the direction of the bird
15:07 - with each jump action scratch Junior can
15:09 - only rotate by but not pointing
15:12 - Direction and if we jump again before
15:14 - the first jump ended the rotation is
15:17 - compounded it's strangely odd but you
15:19 - know what I do rather like it quirky if
15:23 - you want to know if I came up with a
15:24 - solution to this problem then actually I
15:26 - did we can get around it but only by
15:29 - having two Flappy Bird Sprites each at
15:32 - different angles that we hide and show
15:34 - as they jump it works a treat if you
15:36 - really want to get things as close to
15:37 - real as possible
15:39 - so the final stretch now collisions
15:42 - super easy when the Sprite collides with
15:44 - another you can't ask what it collided
15:47 - with so everything except the stage
15:48 - backdrop is a possible Collision here
15:50 - and then we stop all the scripts in the
15:53 - birds right then we'll use a broadcast
15:56 - message to stop the other Sprites too
15:58 - red for game over
16:00 - and do it quickly as we can too a quick
16:03 - test flying straight into a pipe good
16:07 - the bird has stopped and now we need to
16:09 - stop everything else
16:11 - pipes first when red event is triggered
16:14 - stop all the screens the same for all
16:17 - three pipe Sprites too testing again
16:20 - yeah oh I forgot about the ground
16:24 - scrolling drop the script into those two
16:26 - Sprites too
16:28 - and yes now we are in business wow this
16:34 - is so good
16:35 - I'm sure it's not just me but I can't
16:38 - help but notice the bird continues
16:39 - moving by one frame or more after the
16:42 - collision and that's a bit of a shame
16:44 - and try as I might there does not appear
16:47 - to be a fix for this I know what I do in
16:49 - scratch 3 but in scratch Junior with the
16:52 - timings and movement our hands are tied
16:54 - and so all that's left is to trigger a
16:57 - reset to the starting screen ready to
17:00 - try the game again
17:01 - wait for three and then go to the next
17:04 - scene which I assume will Loop us back
17:06 - to scene one let's see
17:08 - and yes it surely does wow guys so what
17:14 - do you think this is it it sure was fun
17:16 - trying to push scratch Junior's
17:18 - boundaries some people say that scratch
17:20 - is not a real programming language and
17:22 - that it's really limited but man just
17:25 - set them to using scratch Junior for a
17:27 - day and when they emerge they will be
17:29 - ready to embrace scratch with open arms
17:31 - seriously scratch 3 is simply fantastic
17:33 - still this game is actually pretty good
17:36 - and I think I'm starting to get the hang
17:38 - of it at last it does make me wonder
17:41 - just how much further could we take this
17:43 - Flappy Bird game do you think it is
17:45 - possible to make a score counter I mean
17:48 - we don't have any variables do we but I
17:50 - have some ideas that might be fun to try
17:53 - out one day perhaps so if you enjoyed
17:56 - this bit of fun please do smash the like
17:58 - button Now And subscribe to the channel
18:00 - so as not to miss my next exciting
18:03 - tutorial until next time then have a
18:06 - great week ahead and scratch guys
