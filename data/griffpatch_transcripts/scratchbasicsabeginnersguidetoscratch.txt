00:18 - animations today we're going to take a
00:21 - quick tour of the scratch website and
00:23 - Editor to get you started on your
00:25 - creative
00:28 - Journey
00:31 - let's start by opening our web browsers
00:33 - and going to the scratch website at
00:37 - scratch.mit.edu or you can just Google
00:40 - it here you'll find a community of
00:43 - creators a gallery of projects and of
00:46 - course the scratch
00:48 - editor but before we dive into that on

02:09 - the scratch editor this is where the

02:18 - your projects come to life the block
02:21 - pallet is on the left containing
02:23 - categories of blocks that you can use to
02:25 - code your project and then the coding
02:29 - area is in the middle this is where
02:31 - you'll drag blocks from the pallet to
02:33 - build your
02:35 - script okay let's create a simple
02:39 - project we don't have to make do with
02:41 - this default scratch Sprite we can start
02:44 - by deleting that one and adding our own
02:48 - you can choose one from the costume
02:54 - library or Draw our very own in the
02:57 - costume
02:58 - editor
03:03 - yes we can have a whole lot of fun in
03:05 - here without ever touching the coding
03:08 - but come on let's make the Sprite move
03:11 - make sure we are back in the code Tab
03:14 - and then find the motion category in the
03:17 - block pallet and drag a move 10 steps
03:21 - block into the coding area now let's
03:25 - make this action happen when you click
03:27 - the green flag from from the events
