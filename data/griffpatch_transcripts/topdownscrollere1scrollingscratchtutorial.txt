00:00 - hi everyone this is Griff patch and
00:02 - today I'm going to make a tutorial on
00:05 - how to make a top-down scrolling game I
00:08 - created this game zombie cube escape a
00:10 - couple of weeks back now and with the
00:12 - sole purpose of being able to show you
00:13 - on YouTube how to make a game like this
00:15 - so this game as you can see I can
00:18 - control my Square and the level scrolls
00:20 - around and it's also got enemies now
00:22 - that's probably the the most difficult
00:25 - part of the game but to begin with I'm
00:27 - going to show you how to make the
00:28 - scrolling part on the level and then
00:30 - we'll move on to doing the enemies next
00:32 - so without further ado let's stop this
00:34 - and we'll create a new project
00:40 - okay so first off name your first sprite
00:43 - as player I like to call it player it
00:46 - makes it nice and easy to know the
00:48 - players bright and we need another
00:50 - sprite now so let's add a new one and
00:53 - we'll paint it and this one is going to
00:56 - be called which we call it level like
00:59 - that okay let's just make this bit
01:02 - smaller so we can see this there yeah
01:04 - yeah yeah now this is the fun bit
01:06 - because you get to draw your level and
01:09 - what we're gonna do is draw a level
01:11 - that's zoomed out so when you play it
01:14 - it's gonna be much bigger but it means
01:16 - that you can have a big level that
01:17 - Scrolls around okay let's switch to
01:19 - bitmap mode and I'll fill in the entire
01:23 - background black that's gonna be the
01:26 - background of the level black and on top
01:28 - of that we're going to draw our walls so
01:31 - choose a color for that like the nice
01:32 - green there we go so we're on fill
01:35 - rectangle mode still and now we can
01:37 - start drawing some walls so let's just
01:40 - draw
01:42 - a few rectangles
01:49 - so
01:54 - okay that'll do for now there's a little
01:58 - bit of a level to begin with so let's
02:02 - give call this level one up here there
02:05 - we go okay now go into your code and
02:10 - let's add an event receiver when I
02:14 - receive and will call this new message
02:18 - setup okay and now we need some
02:24 - variables this is where we need the
02:26 - scrolling variables so let's make a new
02:29 - variable now be careful here it's me for
02:31 - all sprites so I'll use uppercase
02:34 - letters so I can remember that it's for
02:35 - all sprite so I'll call it scroll X in
02:39 - capitals I get space there no let me go
02:41 - scroll X I'll great that I'll create
02:44 - another one again capital letters scroll
02:47 - why okay and now we want a position
02:53 - variable for the level itself and that's
02:56 - gonna be useful later so I'll just call
02:58 - it X in lowercase this time click thee
03:01 - for this sprite only okay make a verbal
03:05 - Y again
03:07 - lowercase not uppercase this is bright
03:09 - only and then in your setup set the X to
03:15 - zero and set the y 0 like that what we
03:21 - need to do is resize this level to make
03:23 - it big now for this to work
03:25 - you need a little trick go back into the
03:27 - costumes add a new costume it's paint
03:30 - and this is gonna be a really small
03:32 - costume so I'm just going to add in a
03:34 - little or a little dot there might not
03:38 - really need to do it and do that but I'm
03:40 - gonna do that for now so there we are
03:42 - it's a little tiny dot I'm going to call
03:44 - this dot like that okay
03:50 - back into code and then change to that
03:53 - costume first switch to costume dot and
03:59 - the reason we do this is because then we
04:00 - can now set the size of the costume
04:05 - - nice and big say 300 2% so it could be
04:08 - three times bigger than the covered
04:10 - little dot and then we can switch the
04:13 - costume back to level one now what
04:16 - you'll find is if we want level one we
04:17 - set the costume between two percent
04:18 - because it's a full scale let me show
04:20 - you let me show you nice and easy
04:23 - so if I switch to costume one okay at
04:26 - eye level and then I say set size to
04:30 - three hundred that is not so units on
04:33 - site if you have a look at the actual
04:35 - size you click on here
04:40 - the actual size is 150 even though we
04:42 - said it 300 now that's because scratch
04:44 - does not want you to make that costume
04:45 - very much bigger than the screen however
04:48 - if you switch to costume dot which is
04:51 - nice and small there it is
04:52 - then set size 300 it does it and then
04:57 - switch back to costume one stays at 300
05:00 - and there's our costume that's 300
05:03 - percent of the level so now we've got
05:04 - big big costume that we can move around
05:07 - and scroll let's put that back to how it
05:09 - was
05:09 - dot size 300 switch costume to level 1
05:14 - excellent
05:16 - so that then sets up our level ready to
05:18 - go next step we need to add in our
05:22 - little guy so let's put in the beginning
05:28 - of the project or in green flag clicked
05:29 - like that we then want to set the
05:33 - scrolling variables so set scroll X to
05:38 - zero and scroll Y to zero it's always
05:43 - important to set your veil was up at the
05:44 - beginning of the project otherwise you
05:46 - don't always get them resetting to what
05:48 - you want them to be and you kind of
05:49 - forget any wonder why poem doesn't work
05:51 - the second time you run it so accept
05:53 - that like that we need some new
05:55 - variables the player's position so it is
05:58 - going to be for this sprite only have an
06:00 - X click ok another variable Y again for
06:06 - this sprite only
06:08 - and these variables we were set to zero
06:11 - as well
06:16 - okay now we need to broadcast to set up
06:20 - at the level so in vents broadcast and
06:25 - wait and we both got set up so now when
06:28 - we run this project it will set anything
06:30 - up and call the level and set that size
06:33 - up properly - okay let me just hide all
06:36 - these variables we're creating because
06:37 - they're not very useful all over the
06:39 - screen same in the level let's get rid
06:41 - of those there we go
06:43 - right now we need a little character now
06:46 - we could keep the cat if we wanted but
06:48 - I'm just going to simplify that and make
06:50 - it into a little cube person like I did
06:53 - in my exam B cube so paint just zoom out
06:57 - so I can see the whole screen choose a
07:00 - color for your little guy I'm gonna go
07:02 - for red
07:04 - and then draw a square in here now if
07:08 - you hold down while you're dragging hold
07:11 - down shift create a perfect square which
07:14 - is nice so let's do that let's get rid
07:17 - of the scratch cat costumes and I'm
07:20 - going to call this costume player as
07:22 - well let's go back to the code so at the
07:26 - moment I can't see my player because
07:28 - he's behind the level so let's make sure
07:30 - he comes to the front so let's say looks
07:34 - go to front yeah run that it should pop
07:38 - up there he is
07:41 - okay so what we need now is to add in
07:43 - the game loop so in the controls let's
07:47 - add a repeat until and just pop it in
07:50 - there so this is going to run until to
07:52 - make a curse and asking me until the end
07:53 - of the game so we'll leave that empty
07:55 - for now because that means it will just
07:56 - repeat forever until we add something in
07:58 - there so click a broadcast in here
08:01 - just a normal broadcast not to book us
08:02 - and wait and a new message and it's
08:05 - going to be player move like that
08:12 - okay and then put a receiver for that in
08:17 - here like this and in here we're going
08:21 - to have a custom block so create a new
08:26 - block and we're going to call this
08:29 - player move and we're going to run
08:32 - without screen refresh and then add that
08:37 - player move to there like that okay so
08:40 - everything we're going to do to it
08:41 - moving is going to get in here for that
08:43 - we need lots of ifs so if and then a
08:48 - sensing block and a key pressed if we
08:53 - press
08:54 - up arrow key then now another custom
08:59 - block and we're going to call this try
09:04 - move
09:07 - and then X
09:13 - input and it's going to be how to X and
09:16 - then the text Y add another input and
09:22 - call it add Y and click OK that makes
09:27 - this a nice little block here what we
09:29 - can then use it's put the custom block
09:32 - into there and we can say how much we
09:34 - want to try moving when we click the up
09:36 - arrow sorry X we want to move 0 and y we
09:40 - want to move up so let's put in four
09:42 - there okay
09:46 - down a bit so this is going to be the
09:47 - same for each of the directions you can
09:49 - push let's do another one when we push
09:51 - the down arrow we want to move the Y by
09:55 - minus four
09:57 - and I'll do it again when we press the
10:02 - left demo we want to move X by minus 4y
10:07 - by 0 we press the right arrow we move
10:12 - the X by 4 and the y by 0 okay did we
10:17 - get that and then we can code up our
10:20 - moving block here so let's do that first
10:24 - so when we press an arrow key we're
10:27 - going to call this try move so this will
10:29 - try and move our player in the direction
10:31 - that we've specified as we need a motion
10:33 - go to block here like this so our
10:38 - position R use a bit of for maths in
10:39 - here so let's put in the add operator
10:44 - and the position we're going to be at is
10:47 - our X which is our players x position
10:50 - plus the amount that we want to move so
10:55 - this gives us the correct position of
10:56 - our player but we need to account for
10:58 - the scrolling of the screen too so in
11:00 - here we have to also have a takeaway
11:07 - X in here and drag your X plus X into
11:11 - the left side like this so the position
11:15 - of the player is the player's position X
11:18 - plus the amount we want to adjust it by
11:21 - removing the amount scroll of the screen
11:23 - and that gets us the exact position on
11:25 - the screen that it should be at and we
11:27 - want the same thing for the right hand
11:28 - side not same thing for the right hand
11:32 - side only it's going to be Y I'm going
11:36 - to be add Y and it's going to be scroll
11:40 - why hey that finds the exact titian and
11:44 - we want to relocate to now if after
11:46 - moving to his position it's touching the
11:48 - green wall then we want to not move the
11:52 - player
11:52 - so if sensing touching color and then
12:00 - pick the color on the level here which
12:03 - is this green that what we actually want
12:06 - is not if we're not touching a green
12:12 - wall then we want to allow the move so
12:15 - what we then do is change X
12:21 - by an ex
12:24 - and change why
12:27 - I had why okay so what we're doing here
12:32 - is we've positioned the player on the
12:35 - screen but we've not actually added
12:38 - anything to his x and y which is what's
12:41 - storing his location and we only
12:42 - actually change his location is stored
12:46 - position if we're not touching a wall so
12:48 - that's the trick we're using here
12:51 - okay good
12:53 - so now we want to add in another
12:54 - broadcast into the repeat loop so we've
12:58 - moved the player then we want to move
13:00 - the level so new message move level like
13:06 - that now when we call level move and put
13:10 - in the receiver
13:14 - down here and it's going to be called
13:18 - move level and we want to just position
13:20 - our player so it's same kind of script
13:22 - we had before I would say if bit just
13:26 - without the ad so it's going to be get
13:28 - this in high position
13:31 - I gotta get that there we go X
13:35 - get rid of those ants
13:38 - so we're gonna position
13:40 - player exactly we should be where
13:43 - exposition takeaway scroll X&Y petition
13:46 - takeaway scroll why when move level is
13:48 - called
13:50 - now hush do the moving level bar in a
13:52 - second but let's just give this a play
13:54 - and see what happens
13:56 - okay look so press the arrow keys Mike a
14:00 - bear moves and if I walk into a wall
14:03 - stops
14:06 - actually working really well no
14:07 - scrolling but it is doing exactly what I
14:10 - wanted it to do
14:12 - okay
14:14 - so now I need to scrolling level so what
14:17 - we're going to do is change the scroll X
14:20 - and scroll Y and that's going to happen
14:21 - here at the bottom of the player move
14:24 - custom blocks after we've done all the
14:25 - movement we're going to scroll the
14:27 - screen to reflect the movement that we
14:29 - just made
14:30 - so in variables you need a change and
14:34 - we're gonna change scroll X by now add
14:39 - in here over around so that's gonna
14:42 - round the number to the nearest whole
14:43 - number no decimal fractions which is
14:46 - important for when you're moving around
14:48 - because it tends to cause quite a bit of
14:50 - a problem if you have fractional numbers
14:52 - when you're always trying to do touching
14:54 - stuff in scrolling so I always round it
14:56 - to the nearest number so round and we
14:59 - want to move it by a bit of the distance
15:02 - towards the player so the player Muse
15:04 - over here the level wants to move back
15:05 - towards the player so what we're going
15:08 - to do in here is have a divide and then
15:14 - on the left side - so this is going to
15:17 - be the distance between the player and
15:18 - the current scroll of the screen so
15:21 - let's put in player X the current player
15:24 - takeaway scroll cover position that's
15:28 - difference between the player position
15:31 - and the screen scroll position and we're
15:34 - going to divide it by 10 so that it's
15:36 - going to move it by a tenth of the
15:37 - amount the distance between the two
15:40 - things so that means it kind of will
15:41 - slowly catch up and the same with the
15:44 - scroll Y we'll change that to be y
15:47 - takeaway scroll Y divided by 10 okay
15:51 - that will scroll the scroll X and Scott
15:55 - Y all we need to do now is position the
15:58 - level to that with that scroll as well
16:01 - so we've added in the move level here
16:05 - which has been positioning our player
16:07 - based on the current scroll we want this
16:10 - also in level so I'm just going to drag
16:13 - it in to level okay do we go into level
16:17 - there it is
16:19 - so this is also now going to be
16:21 - positioning the level with the scroll
16:23 - let's just run that and see weapons
16:27 - if I now move
16:31 - that
16:33 - smooth scrolling
16:36 - and can't walk into these
16:39 - walls
16:41 - perfect
16:44 - so it's really good
16:47 - see how far we've got already there so
16:50 - I'm pretty pleased with that that's a
16:53 - really good start to our game and you of
16:56 - course can now go ahead and design this
16:58 - level just as excitingly as you want so
17:01 - as I move around here I could for
17:03 - example draw in another wall to find
17:06 - just pick the right green color again
17:09 - like that I can draw in another wall
17:14 - here that appeared straightaway on the
17:16 - game pigs around here like this I can
17:20 - then build some more walls I can draw
17:22 - one in here just be careful as you do
17:25 - this if I used to use the arrow keys now
17:27 - to move my player on the right hand side
17:29 - here I'm also moving the wall because
17:33 - it's still selected over here so the
17:35 - cursor keys
17:36 - moves the wall so I'm causing a bit of
17:38 - confusion there and while playing the
17:39 - game to make sure when you've drawn it
17:41 - you click off it otherwise when you move
17:43 - you're going to start changing a level
17:45 - by mistake we go ahead design whatever
17:48 - level you like only the green is gonna
17:50 - act as a wall at the moment so you can
17:53 - put other colors on the floor and it
17:55 - won't get in your way
17:56 - design your level exactly as you like it
17:59 - we our next YouTube tutorial I'm going
18:01 - to show you how to add in some enemies
18:04 - so that is gonna be fun I hope you
18:07 - enjoyed that and we've patch follow me
18:09 - thanks bye
18:11 - you
