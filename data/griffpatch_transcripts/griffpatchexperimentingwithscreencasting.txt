00:02 - hi this is Griff patch I'm really
00:04 - excited that you're listening to this um
00:06 - not really sure what I'm doing at the
00:08 - moment but I just wanted to be able to
00:10 - maybe put together some YouTube videos
00:12 - I've often been asked and I don't really
00:15 - have much of a presence on YouTube so uh
00:17 - this is a start not that I'm set up for
00:20 - this I'm at present uh sitting in my
00:22 - kitchen with a with a microphone shoved
00:25 - into a boot to hold it somewhere near my
00:27 - face so it's not the most comfortable of
00:29 - situ ation to be in but I thought I'd
00:31 - give it a go um not really sure what I'm
00:34 - even going to show you but I thought
00:35 - it'd be a good a good way of
00:38 - experimenting and seeing uh whether it
00:40 - actually works uh this screen capture
00:42 - and that so I'm going to create a new
00:45 - project and uh and off we go um I expect
00:48 - in future people might want to ask me uh
00:52 - some questions and maybe I can show show
00:54 - off some things to uh try and answer
00:57 - those questions uh but for now in the
00:59 - lack of any anything more deep I'm just
01:01 - going to have a bit of a play around
01:02 - really um so let's just get uh scratchy
01:06 - to do something interesting um I'm just
01:09 - going to set him up uh to point to the
01:12 - right like he currently is just because
01:14 - I'm pretty sure we going to make him
01:15 - move around it's good to set him back to
01:17 - where he is now I'll stick him on the
01:20 - far left of the
01:21 - screen which is 240 but I'll move it 230
01:24 - that's about right there we go and I'll
01:27 - make him a lot bigger to begin with
01:31 - set size to
01:34 - 200 should do the trick just see that
01:38 - yeah that's great now what I want to do
01:40 - first is have him move in to roughly the
01:42 - middle but I don't want to just have him
01:44 - move straight but uh let's just see um
01:49 - if I do a repeat Loop here I'll just do
01:52 - a forever Loop for now just so we can
01:53 - see them working let's just move him
01:56 - forward um like so let's just see
02:00 - okay so there we go he moves he doesn't
02:02 - stop in the middle and he moves at a
02:04 - pretty straight uh speed very constant
02:08 - when don't want that either so we want
02:10 - him to slow down as he moves so what I'm
02:13 - going to do is introduce a new variable
02:15 - called
02:18 - speed and I'm going to do it for this
02:20 - Sprite only now it's important because I
02:23 - don't want any other clones or Sprites
02:25 - to have access to this varable this is
02:28 - this cat speed only
02:31 - okay I'm going to click off the tick to
02:33 - stop it appearing on the screen I don't
02:34 - want it to be taking up any of the speed
02:37 - a uh the screen space so let's set his
02:40 - speed just here and I'll set it to 10
02:45 - for
02:46 - now
02:47 - and now I will make him move by speed so
02:53 - that will do the same at the moment no
02:54 - difference he's moving by
02:57 - speed so I'm going to Al Al to the speed
03:00 - as he moves so I'm going to set his
03:04 - speed
03:07 - to what his current speed is multiplied
03:10 - by now slightly less than one so that
03:16 - every time it goes around this Loop
03:17 - speed will get smaller and smaller so if
03:20 - I run that
03:21 - now there we go simple as that he now
03:26 - moves forward and speed gets smaller and
03:28 - small in fact we put speed back on again
03:30 - you'll see
03:32 - speed slowly gets down to zero point
03:34 - very very small doesn't move at all so
03:37 - that's
03:38 - good
03:41 - excellent now what I was thinking of
03:43 - doing in this demo uh is doing maybe a
03:46 - bit of cloning so that I could click on
03:49 - that cat and little versions of him
03:52 - would spin off different
03:54 - directions so let's give that a
03:57 - go so let's let's have uh when this
04:00 - Sprite is
04:02 - clicked now what we're going to do in
04:04 - here is
04:06 - create three cats from the one cat so
04:09 - that means I'm to create two clones and
04:13 - leave the one that we already
04:15 - have so to do that we'll need a repeat
04:18 - block now remember that's two
04:21 - clones so we'll have repeat
04:23 - two and we will create a clone of
04:27 - ourselves that's great
04:30 - what else do I want to
04:32 - do um I want to
04:36 - turn and we'll
04:38 - turn uh after we
04:41 - clone and we'll turn by 120 since we're
04:45 - doing three cats so
04:48 - 320s is 360 which is a full circle fact
04:51 - if we just click him now we go three
04:54 - cats so that's great that's done what we
04:56 - wanted
04:58 - and that'll happen every
05:04 - time the last one still moves on great
05:07 - so now you can see why I put in the
05:09 - point Direction 90Â° at the beginning
05:11 - when we click the flag so otherwise we'd
05:13 - be pointing in this space strange
05:14 - Direction so we always start from the
05:16 - same beginning that's
05:19 - great so we've got three cats in three
05:22 - directions what I wanted them to do was
05:24 - to move off in the different directions
05:27 - just like the first cat moved so for
05:30 - this we currently have one forever loop
05:33 - on the one cat that starts out but not
05:36 - on these new
05:37 - clones so what we can do is we can
05:39 - create a custom
05:41 - block called move
05:45 - cat caps locks there that's
05:50 - better okay and we'll take
05:54 - this bit here setting the speed and the
05:57 - loop from the main
06:00 - green flag into my move cat and
06:03 - replace it there with move cat and that
06:05 - will now do the same as it always did so
06:07 - now that click flag is doing this move
06:10 - cat but what I want to do is have each
06:13 - of these clones also call the move cat
06:16 - so I can move this down to a new block
06:19 - hold on what I should have done is put a
06:24 - when there we go when I start as a clone
06:26 - so each of the
06:28 - Clones will also call in to move cat so
06:32 - let's just run that
06:33 - again if I click
06:37 - him there now the two clones that were
06:42 - created zoomed off the one that I
06:44 - already had
06:46 - didn't now why was
06:50 - that what did I need to do that I did
06:52 - not
06:55 - do ah yes I what I did
07:00 - so what I really should be doing for
07:03 - getting this set speed in here let's get
07:05 - rid of
07:06 - that let's set the
07:09 - speed one in
07:12 - here like that so the very first one
07:15 - moves
07:16 - but I'm just going to duplicate that get
07:20 - of that move cap I want to set the speed
07:23 - over here where where do I want it here
07:27 - so when here this the first cat is
07:31 - clicked I'm going to set the speed of
07:33 - the new cat sorry the cat that's clicked
07:35 - to start him going off again and also
07:38 - the ones that are cloned will move at
07:41 - the same speed as
07:43 - well that is right I have got that right
07:46 - good right so let's just try 10 for now
07:47 - that's fine let's do
07:51 - that there we go and I click him again
07:55 - and I click him again and again and
07:58 - again and again and again and they just
08:00 - keep splitting that's crazy but of
08:03 - course when things split they should get
08:05 - smaller shouldn't they obviously so
08:06 - let's make him go smaller when he splits
08:10 - so in looks set size here we
08:15 - go
08:16 - so I should do it again in here so I set
08:19 - the speed and I want to set the size now
08:21 - his size I want him to be half the size
08:23 - he originally was so I'm going to divide
08:25 - his
08:27 - size if we go into looks again we can
08:29 - have the size block so set size to the
08:33 - current size divided by two that's half
08:36 - the
08:36 - size try that again then so click there
08:40 - we
08:41 - go nice only problem is he doesn't half
08:45 - move fast when he's little you'd expect
08:48 - his speed to be like relative to his
08:50 - size really wouldn't you so let's make
08:53 - it so that his speed is relative to his
08:56 - size so when we're setting speed to 10
08:58 - here let's change that
09:00 - what we shall do
09:03 - instead set his speed to be now we can
09:06 - choose set it to I'll just duplicate
09:09 - size there set his speed to the size
09:13 - divided by something and uh Let's do
09:19 - let's try 15 in
09:21 - there so
09:26 - click
09:28 - click
09:30 - click this is
09:34 - better apart from they moved a bit too
09:36 - far out tell you what I'll do rather
09:38 - than setting the
09:40 - speed and then setting the size I'll set
09:44 - the size so it gets smaller first
09:46 - because then his speed is relative to
09:48 - the size he's now become rather than the
09:50 - size he was try that
09:53 - again ah this is
09:57 - good look at that
10:02 - see what this is doing this is quite
10:05 - interesting if I keep clicking
10:08 - them is actually
10:10 - creating this quite interesting
10:13 - pattern
10:15 - and what this is interesting is because
10:18 - it's actually um it's actually very
10:21 - similar to a fractal pattern well it's a
10:24 - pattern that just keeps going on forever
10:25 - and ever so if you could zoom in you
10:28 - could keep doing this and you'd make a
10:29 - pattern that just you could zoom in and
10:31 - in and in because we keep splitting them
10:33 - and splitting them and splitting them of
10:34 - course scratch will weat it's clone
10:36 - limit before we could do that but it's
10:37 - quite an interesting thing and perhaps
10:39 - it's something we could actually play
10:40 - with um so rather than me having to
10:43 - click these how about we get them to
10:46 - automatically split when they slow down
10:50 - so when I click here and I start off he
10:52 - slows down how about we get him to to
10:55 - pop that point and turn into three cats
10:58 - and we'll see where that goes
11:00 - so that would mean having to get rid of
11:02 - this Sprite clicked and have that occur
11:06 - automatically um when the speed gets
11:08 - slow now the cap is getting slower in
11:11 - this move cap Sprite um sorry custom
11:13 - block so we'll have to put a if in
11:16 - there let's put it in underneath the
11:19 - move and we'll say
11:22 - if the
11:25 - speed is less than um let's say 0.1 so
11:31 - this is getting really slow so less than
11:32 - a pixel so that's quantity gets very
11:36 - slow then ah now we can't do this yet
11:40 - because what we need is this bit of
11:42 - script down here when it's clicked to be
11:44 - again in its own little custom block so
11:45 - we'll get rid of the Sprite clicked
11:47 - we'll create a new block
11:50 - called
11:54 - split okay so this code for splitting
11:57 - the cat into three is is now called
11:59 - split and we can pop the split into this
12:03 - speed over here so when it gets slow
12:05 - it'll call that let's just give that to
12:07 - go if I missed
12:10 - anything oh there we go
12:12 - pop and then they will go and then they
12:16 - will go and there we'll go again and I
12:19 - should think we will oh now it's g a bit
12:22 - crazy because we have run out of clones
12:26 - so now it's kind of dancing actually I
12:28 - quite like it
12:31 - it's quite
12:36 - funky let's see that in uh full
12:39 - screen because then you might be to see
12:41 - the little
12:51 - cats okay at this point that's there
12:54 - that's the bit where it goes
12:56 - wrong so now the Clones are not being
12:59 - created what's happening is it's the one
13:01 - single cat is continuing running and the
13:03 - other clones never get started because
13:05 - scratch is a 301 clone
13:09 - limit often the bane of many programers
13:12 - lives but it's uh there to stop the your
13:14 - computer from overheating from getting
13:17 - too
13:18 - slow right
13:21 - cool you know what might be quite fun is
13:24 - to add a pen Trail to that to be able to
13:26 - see where the cat moves as he splits
13:30 - let's try that should we um
13:33 - so
13:35 - let's start up so we'll clear the screen
13:38 - to begin with so was a good idea and
13:42 - quite often also got idea to stick a pen
13:43 - up at the beginning before we do
13:45 - everything just in case the pen is left
13:47 - down and that would mean that you'd have
13:50 - an extra line drawn from wher the uh
13:52 - scratch cat last was we don't want that
13:55 - so let's do that let's set a nice color
13:59 - maybe a
14:00 - green uh there's a nice green there's a
14:04 - nice
14:05 - green um and then we just have to have a
14:08 - pen down before we start drawing let's
14:11 - just give that go straight
14:16 - away there we go so now we can see each
14:19 - cat drawing its own little
14:22 - line I like
14:27 - that
14:29 - huh this um this fractal triangle it's I
14:33 - think it's called shapin triangle um but
14:37 - I don't think that one dances like this
14:39 - uh that's a bit uh bit more curious but
14:43 - I do like the idea I do love fractals
14:48 - um we could even um May this you could
14:53 - start drawing like it's kind of like
14:54 - like almost like trees don't they these
14:57 - fractals
15:00 - we could make the line a bit thicker on
15:03 - the main branch to begin with and thin
15:05 - out as it goes shouldn't be too
15:07 - difficult um so pen size so let's set
15:11 - the pen size where should I set it I'll
15:14 - put it in here because all the no I
15:19 - won't no I won't where should I put it
15:21 - I'll put an initial pen size in
15:24 - here
15:26 - uh what I'm going to do set it relative
15:30 - to the size of the Sprite so
15:34 - looks size divided
15:37 - by let's go with
15:39 - 50 and I'll do the
15:44 - same in here after I've resized it when
15:47 - I split let's give that a
15:56 - go not sure I did that really thick
16:04 - enough let's try a bit
16:06 - thicker let's try dividing it by 30
16:25 - instead I think we
16:27 - should stop it from doing this dancing
16:30 - to be honest let's get it to be a proper
16:33 - triangle um so to do that we'd have to
16:36 - tell it not to
16:38 - split so if I put an if around
16:45 - here then
16:49 - if
16:50 - size is bigger
16:53 - than let's say it's bigger than 10 so if
16:57 - it size bigger than 10 then it goes
16:59 - ahead and shrinks and splits otherwise
17:02 - it's just going to stop moving because
17:03 - it's going to continue in this little
17:05 - mouse mouse scratch C moving bit when
17:08 - it's got really slow so if I just run
17:11 - that let's
17:14 - see if we have a stable ending
17:21 - condition and I think one more split it
17:23 - shouldn't
17:25 - stop hey there we go lots and lots of
17:28 - little
17:29 - cats that was quite fun I should think
17:32 - uh you could probably have a lot of fun
17:34 - with this just uh playing around with it
17:36 - maybe it needs a much darker background
17:38 - let's try black
17:42 - oh I like that quite as much as I
17:44 - thought I was going to maybe uh bit of a
17:47 - gradient
17:48 - there let's just see that's nice like
17:52 - he's drawing a nice
17:57 - Leaf but it's c isn't it there you are
17:59 - simple little cloning sample and we've
18:02 - ended up with Shin's
18:05 - Triangle Well I think that's probably
18:07 - enough for this sorry about my waffling
18:09 - let me know what you think and maybe
18:11 - I'll uh create some some bit more in
18:14 - depth tutorials and hopefully a little
18:16 - bit less waffly but apologies for my
18:19 - waffling scratch
18:22 - on
