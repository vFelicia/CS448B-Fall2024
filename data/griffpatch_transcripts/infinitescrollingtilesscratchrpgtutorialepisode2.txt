00:02 - hello fellow scratchers this is part two
00:05 - of our scratch rpg tutorial and man this
00:08 - episode promises to be a stonker sure we
00:11 - have our player sorted from episode one
00:14 - but the substance of our rpg relies upon
00:16 - the creation of a seamless persisted
00:18 - tiled scrolling level wow the things we
00:22 - are going to learn beginning by covering
00:24 - crazy simple infinite scrolling
00:26 - backgrounds yeah infinity sure does go
00:30 - on a very long way
00:32 - then we'll talk about level maps using
00:34 - scratch lists before coding a working
00:37 - grid list solution to power our stamped
00:40 - scrolling engine
00:42 - finally for those who think rift batch
00:44 - and lag never does they meet stay tuned
00:47 - to the end of the video because yes the
00:49 - lag is real
00:51 - but fear not where we are heading we'll
00:54 - say goodbye to lag for good yep silky
00:57 - smooth scrolling i promise
01:00 - hey talking of lag some of you have
01:02 - commented that loading these big
01:04 - projects in scratch can be real slow so
01:08 - here's a handy hint
01:09 - don't click the see inside button from
01:12 - the my stuff page watch how slow this is
01:16 - i'll leave that loading and in the
01:17 - meantime watch how fast it loads if we
01:20 - instead click to view the project like
01:22 - this
01:24 - and then my goodness does it load a lot
01:26 - quicker
01:27 - and then we simply click to see inside
01:29 - and there we are yep to the screen is
01:32 - still loading
01:34 - right with our projects loaded click to
01:36 - save as a new copy
01:39 - for this is episode 2. guys
01:43 - let's get scratching
01:45 - so last episode we got as far as getting
01:48 - our player to walk around and animate
01:50 - and that is great but this is supposed
01:53 - to be a scrolling game so let's see what
01:56 - we can do about that
01:58 - a scrolling effect is achieved by not
02:00 - moving the player but moving the entire
02:03 - scene around too
02:05 - so the grass will have to move left oops
02:09 - did you know that dragging a sprite on
02:11 - the stage causes it to move in front of
02:13 - all the other sprites
02:15 - now it's in front of the player sprite
02:17 - too oh
02:18 - not to worry click back into the player
02:20 - sprite and under the when flag clicked
02:23 - script drop a go to front block right
02:26 - after the set size that'll make sure the
02:28 - player stays at the front
02:31 - okay player x and y keep track of the
02:34 - player's position on the level now we
02:36 - will add some variables to keep track of
02:38 - the scrolling viewport the camera
02:41 - position if you will
02:42 - create a new variable cam x for all
02:45 - sprites this stands for camera x
02:48 - and we create cam y also for all sprites
02:53 - we can test these out by right-clicking
02:55 - the variable reporters on the stage and
02:57 - changing them into sliders
03:01 - find the when i receive paint player
03:04 - script now to scroll the sprite around
03:07 - using the camera sliders we just
03:09 - subtract camex
03:12 - from player x
03:13 - and cam y
03:15 - from player y
03:17 - this simple change gives us the power to
03:19 - pan the player around the screen
03:21 - independent of the normal movement
03:23 - scripts
03:24 - but to complete the effect we need to
03:27 - move the background grass sprite 2.
03:30 - so click into the background sprite
03:33 - we'll add some general setup scripts
03:34 - first when flag clicked
03:37 - set size to 200 yeah all my sprites are
03:41 - 200 in this project
03:44 - so bring in a when i receive event
03:47 - receiver
03:48 - and we'll add a new message
03:50 - paint
03:51 - background
03:56 - now we go to xy
04:00 - and we subtract from zero
04:04 - cam x
04:06 - and the same for the y
04:08 - zero subtract
04:10 - cam y
04:12 - to make this all work we just need to
04:14 - broadcast this new event so back in the
04:16 - player sprite find the start game loop
04:19 - script
04:21 - add a new broadcast block for the event
04:24 - paint background
04:25 - and we drop it in here before the paint
04:28 - player broadcast and this way the
04:30 - background will be drawn before the
04:32 - player
04:33 - excellent let's test it out smash that
04:36 - green flag and we have some fun wiggling
04:39 - these camera sliders and watching the
04:41 - player and the grass now scrolling
04:43 - around together beautiful
04:45 - and yes we can still walk around using
04:48 - the arrow keys as long as we click off
04:51 - the variable reporter first it's nice
04:53 - that the scrolling and the player
04:54 - movement are independent
04:56 - as the player will not always want to be
04:58 - locked to the center of the screen
05:01 - however
05:02 - that might be the exception rather than
05:04 - the rule so in the player sprite under
05:07 - the tick player receiver
05:09 - set camex to
05:12 - player x
05:14 - and set camera y
05:17 - to player y
05:19 - now the camera is locked to the player
05:21 - position following along as we walk but
05:24 - it's great that we have the flexibility
05:25 - to break away from that later on
05:28 - now it's a shame that the background
05:29 - costume is so small and we reach the end
05:33 - so soon it'd be nice if we could make it
05:36 - go
05:36 - further luckily there is a trick for
05:39 - that click into the background sprite
05:42 - now you see this large grass costume is
05:44 - made up of a repeating pattern of
05:46 - smaller grass tiles it repeats
05:48 - seamlessly every 32 pixels now this
05:51 - costume at 200 percent is a full tile
05:54 - wider and taller than the stage that
05:57 - means we can scroll it smoothly across
05:59 - by a full tile 32 pixels
06:02 - but here's the trick before scrolling
06:04 - further and revealing that ugly costume
06:06 - edge we jump it back to the left by a
06:10 - full tile width
06:11 - the magic is that the player isn't even
06:14 - aware that we did it and this creates a
06:16 - perfect infinite scrolling background
06:20 - and it's easy to script
06:22 - in the background sprite we replace the
06:24 - camex
06:26 - with a mod block
06:28 - camex can be placed on the left and on
06:30 - the right we enter the width of a tile
06:33 - 32
06:34 - this will now loop the camera position
06:36 - around so it never reaches or exceeds 32
06:40 - we want to do the same for cam y
06:42 - mod it by 32 and subtract the result
06:46 - from zero are you ready for this green
06:50 - flag time and would you look at that you
06:54 - wouldn't know the tricks going on behind
06:55 - the scenes would you just looks like a
06:58 - sweet scrolling background
07:00 - if you want to see the costume being
07:02 - shifted around then you can set size to
07:03 - 100 and there you go you can see how the
07:06 - costume is just shifting back and forth
07:08 - i love it now back to 200
07:12 - so wow we could do a lot with this but
07:15 - to populate our world with exciting
07:17 - roads buildings and more we'll need an
07:20 - upgrade yes we're going to talk about
07:23 - tiles
07:24 - so for now hide the background sprite
07:27 - and we'll click into the tile sprite now
07:29 - you may or may not be planning to use
07:31 - the same tile costumes for your rpg as
07:34 - mine but whether you are or not we
07:36 - should try to understand how i've laid
07:38 - them out
07:39 - you'll find the first actual game tile
07:41 - doesn't start until costume 20. more on
07:44 - why in a moment but each costume has a
07:47 - width and height of 16 pixels which at a
07:50 - size of 200 percent ends up as 32 by 32
07:54 - pixels in the game
07:56 - this is just a great size not too big
07:58 - and not too small
08:00 - the costume itself is a bitmap and is
08:02 - centered on the canvas this makes it
08:05 - really quick to import the new costumes
08:07 - so what about all those other costumes
08:10 - before this first tile
08:12 - well there's a big costume this looks
08:15 - empty but is actually a large
08:17 - transparent rectangle we use it to allow
08:19 - other costumes to move easily off screen
08:22 - the next costumes are going to be used
08:24 - in the level editor in future episodes i
08:26 - can't wait for that and then you'll also
08:29 - find the rest of the costumes are blank
08:32 - and they're named reserved
08:34 - you see we may need more costumes for
08:37 - other editor features later on and these
08:39 - reserved costumes can be replaced as and
08:41 - when we need them without changing then
08:44 - the costume number of tile 20. you see
08:47 - changing the costume numbers of tiles
08:49 - already used in our game will lead to
08:51 - broken levels and we don't want that
08:55 - well okay guys let's make a start we
08:58 - need the obligatory sprite setup code
09:01 - when flag clicked
09:03 - set size to 200 yep
09:06 - and then
09:07 - hide no need to have the original sprite
09:10 - visible on the stage
09:11 - then when i receive paint background
09:14 - now we are wanting to paint a grid of
09:17 - tiles to the screen like this
09:19 - so we'll need a new custom block named
09:22 - paint
09:23 - with run without screen refresh checked
09:26 - this will allow it to paint all the
09:28 - tiles quick enough before the screen
09:30 - refreshes
09:31 - drop the paint block under the paint
09:33 - background receiver
09:35 - nice let's start simple and just paint
09:38 - one line of tiles switch costume to the
09:41 - first actual tile costume and for me
09:43 - that's tile00
09:45 - right after that line 18 costume thing
09:47 - there
09:48 - for now set x to zero
09:52 - and we'll paint one row of tiles so
09:55 - repeat ten
09:58 - often at this point we would drop in a
09:59 - crate clone block but nope not this time
10:02 - the reason i keep naming these events
10:04 - paint is that we are going to paint
10:07 - these costumes to the screen
10:09 - so click on add an extension and choose
10:13 - the pen extension
10:15 - and now we can stamp the sprite on the
10:18 - stage literally painting copy of it on
10:20 - the screen
10:21 - after which we move on to stamp the next
10:24 - tile by changing x by 32 that's the
10:28 - width of our tile sprite if you remember
10:30 - great let's see that working just click
10:33 - the define paint script and yes that's
10:36 - cool we've stamped a seamless line of
10:39 - tiles from the middle of the screen to
10:41 - the right margin
10:43 - well
10:44 - almost seamless the last tiles have
10:46 - experienced somewhat of a pile up at the
10:49 - edge of the screen and this happens
10:50 - because of scratch's fencing rules that
10:53 - prevent you moving a sprite fully off
10:55 - the screen oh bother
10:58 - well what we'll do to get around this is
11:00 - to switch to a big costume before we
11:03 - move because big costumes are allowed to
11:06 - move further off screen
11:08 - so we'll move to where we want to go
11:10 - before switching back to our smaller
11:12 - costume again perfect
11:16 - so duplicate that switch costume block
11:19 - and now change the original costume to
11:20 - be the big costume mine is costume one
11:24 - this is then moved into position and
11:26 - before we stamp the tile we quickly
11:28 - switch to the actual costume to be
11:29 - stamped
11:31 - then right afterwards switch back to the
11:33 - big costume ready for moving once more
11:37 - to test that click the paint block again
11:39 - and there we go bug squashed
11:44 - right then for a complete grid of tiles
11:46 - we just need to stamp more of these rows
11:49 - up the screen
11:50 - separate off the set x and repeat loop
11:53 - that drew that row
11:54 - and we begin with a set y again to 0
11:59 - and then repeat 10 times for the 10 full
12:01 - rows
12:03 - these scripts go back inside this new
12:05 - repeat
12:06 - all we need to do though is make sure to
12:08 - keep moving up to the next row using a
12:10 - change y by 32
12:14 - as the last block in the outer loop
12:16 - now this is exciting click the paint
12:19 - script again to run it and let's see
12:21 - what we've got
12:22 - yeah very promising indeed and don't be
12:26 - worried about it feeling slow if we
12:28 - clear the screen that's in the pen
12:30 - category click on the arrays all block
12:33 - there
12:34 - so if we now click the when i receive
12:36 - block up here
12:38 - bang instant tile painting much better
12:41 - it only draws slowly when we click on
12:43 - the define block itself and that's
12:45 - because running a block directly ignores
12:48 - the run without screen refresh option
12:50 - great for testing but it can be a little
12:52 - confusing if you didn't know that
12:54 - for now we'll place an erase all block
12:57 - at the top of the paint script to clear
12:59 - things up before we begin painting
13:02 - now one thing we haven't yet addressed
13:04 - is scrolling this tile grid with the
13:06 - camera
13:07 - no problem though just as before we take
13:10 - the set y block and carefully to use cam
13:13 - y for the y position replace zero with
13:17 - zero subtract cam y
13:20 - and do the same for the set x replacing
13:22 - zero with
13:24 - zero subtract cam x
13:28 - and then excitedly slap that green flag
13:31 - and bask in the glory of this beautiful
13:34 - scrolling grid of tiles nice work
13:37 - but we are not quite there yet click the
13:41 - green flag to reset the project because
13:43 - things are not yet positioned quite as
13:46 - they should be what i would expect to
13:48 - see is this since we start by setting
13:51 - player x and y to 0 0
13:54 - the player should be snugly positioned
13:56 - at the bottom left corner of the bottom
13:59 - left tile of our level
14:01 - so why are these things not aligned
14:03 - correctly well it's down to our costumes
14:06 - if we position a tile sprite at an x and
14:09 - y of zero it appears here because the
14:12 - costume is center aligned
14:15 - what we actually want is for it to
14:16 - appear here half a width and height
14:19 - across and up from where it is so unless
14:22 - we want to edit all 500 plus costumes
14:25 - let's do this in code
14:28 - find the zero subtract cam y
14:31 - and to add 16 pixels to this we can just
14:34 - write 16 subtract cam y
14:37 - and for the x set x to 16 subtract cam x
14:42 - simple
14:43 - tap that green flag and we can confirm
14:45 - we are getting closer to our goal
14:49 - next up the player sprite
14:51 - in the costume editor we can see that
14:53 - they too are center aligned but it's not
14:55 - as simple as moving them up so that
14:57 - their feet are in the center because
14:59 - this is a semi 3d world we are
15:01 - simulating imagining them inside a 3d
15:04 - block helps a bit their feet are
15:06 - therefore actually around here
15:09 - so we have to move them up by 10 pixels
15:12 - and that should do the trick
15:13 - again leave the actual costume alone in
15:16 - our code find the when i receive paint
15:18 - player script
15:20 - we need an addition block and we'll add
15:22 - to player y an extra 10 pixels return
15:26 - that to the set y block
15:28 - so has this sorted the positioning green
15:31 - flag time and yes this is looking much
15:35 - more as expected
15:36 - so we can safely move on to greater
15:40 - things enough of the same repeating
15:43 - tiles i think we want to define a full
15:46 - level map recording what tile costumes
15:48 - appear where
15:50 - so who watched my tutorial on grid lists
15:53 - if you haven't or need a recap then do
15:55 - give that video a watch but basically
15:58 - our goal is to store a level map like
16:01 - this one in a scratch list
16:03 - let's take a smaller example we can't
16:06 - store costumes in a list but we can
16:08 - store costume numbers so starting at the
16:11 - bottom left this bush is costume 79 pop
16:15 - that into the list
16:17 - and then we work our way across the
16:19 - first row filling out the costume
16:21 - numbers all bushes
16:24 - once a row is complete we simply
16:26 - continue on the next row above left to
16:29 - right ah the plain grass is costume 44
16:32 - and we continue sell after cell row
16:35 - after row until we've completed the
16:37 - entire grid
16:39 - perfect
16:40 - let's do this we'll start by creating a
16:42 - grid list exactly like this one
16:45 - so we're still in the player sprite so
16:48 - find the when flag clicked script to
16:51 - trigger the loading of our grid list
16:53 - broadcast and wait
16:55 - important because we must wait for the
16:57 - level to load before continuing
16:59 - and use the new message
17:01 - store
17:02 - load scene
17:04 - i begin with the word store to indicate
17:06 - this event is handled by the level
17:08 - storage code
17:09 - indeed we can create a new sprite for
17:12 - this now
17:14 - naming it level store
17:17 - all level loading saving and generating
17:19 - will go in here so when i receive store
17:23 - load scene
17:25 - we can add actual loading scripts later
17:27 - on for now we'll just generate a level
17:30 - make a new custom block named
17:32 - new
17:33 - map
17:34 - run without screen refresh
17:36 - drop the new map block into our event
17:39 - and we are ready to generate our grid
17:41 - list
17:42 - talking of which make a new list and
17:45 - name it
17:46 - grid
17:47 - leaving it for all sprites
17:50 - start with a delete all of grid to
17:53 - ensure that it's fresh and ready for us
17:55 - to use
17:56 - before we begin we need to decide the
17:58 - width and height of our grid make a new
18:01 - variable for this named gmax
18:04 - grid max for all sprites
18:08 - and for consistency let's set
18:12 - gmax to 10
18:15 - this will generate a 10 by 10 cell grid
18:18 - now let's add this first row of bushes
18:21 - repeat
18:23 - for g max
18:24 - that's 10 items
18:26 - adding to grid
18:29 - the bush costume
18:31 - except i feel we're going to be adding a
18:33 - lot of runs of the same costume let's
18:36 - make this repeat ad into a custom block
18:40 - name it add to grid with an input
18:44 - count
18:45 - that's the number of tiles to be added
18:47 - in a line
18:48 - a label of tiles of
18:51 - with the input
18:53 - tile that's the tile to be repeated run
18:56 - without screen refresh
18:58 - we can then move the repeat into here
19:01 - using the count input in place of g max
19:04 - and the tile input is the costume number
19:06 - to be added to grid
19:08 - nice it's now simple to add the first
19:11 - row to the grid
19:13 - we just say add to grid
19:16 - gmax items
19:18 - of costume 79 that's my bush costume
19:22 - we can test that works by clicking the
19:23 - new map script and we should see 10
19:26 - items of 79 appear in our list
19:30 - the next row begins with one bush so add
19:33 - 79 to grid
19:36 - this is followed by a run of grass how
19:38 - many well two less than the full width
19:41 - so add to grid block 44 that's the grass
19:45 - with a count of g max subtract two
19:50 - and don't forget to finish off with
19:52 - another bush add 79
19:55 - that's the next row completed so
19:56 - clicking the script should add another
19:58 - 10 items to the end of our existing list
20:01 - great so we just need to repeatedly add
20:04 - more of those types of row so pop that
20:06 - in a repeat block and the number of
20:08 - times to repeat is again two less than
20:11 - the full height which is gmax subtract
20:14 - two
20:15 - lastly to complete our level we add
20:17 - another full row of bushes
20:20 - at grid gmax tiles of 79.
20:24 - if all is well running the whole new map
20:27 - script will now result in 100 items in
20:29 - our grid list brilliant
20:32 - we are ready to boogie
20:34 - we can hide the grid list and click back
20:36 - into the tile sprite ready to make use
20:39 - of this list to paint our tiles
20:41 - we begin painting grid tile one
20:45 - we need a variable to keep track of this
20:47 - and name it gidx that stands for grid
20:50 - index
20:51 - and make it for this sprite only
20:54 - and set gi dx to 1
20:58 - pop that in at the top of the script
21:02 - now we are switching costume here so
21:04 - bring in an item 1 of grid
21:08 - now we want to pull the costume number
21:10 - of the tile at position gidx out from
21:14 - the grid list
21:15 - then to move on to the next list item
21:18 - change gidx by one
21:21 - just before the end of the inner repeat
21:23 - loop like so
21:25 - oh boy you know what time it is it's
21:28 - testing time smash that green flag yes
21:31 - yes look at that that's exactly what we
21:34 - were hoping for aren't grid lists the
21:37 - best
21:38 - so being the curious scratchers we are
21:41 - our next thoughts might be to wonder
21:43 - well how big can we make our gridless
21:45 - level let's find out click back into the
21:48 - level store sprite our level is 10 by 10
21:51 - so now set g max to 100 that's a hundred
21:56 - times a hundred um ten thousand tiles
22:00 - gosh do you think our stamping script
22:02 - can handle this
22:04 - to find out we must click into the tile
22:06 - sprite once more because our stamping
22:09 - repeat loop is still set to a fixed 10
22:11 - tiles we need to update this to use the
22:14 - gmax variable in both cases
22:17 - so before i run this what do you think
22:20 - do you expect stellar fast performance
22:22 - or terrible sluggish super lag
22:25 - well sadly it's the latter asking
22:28 - scratch to stamp 10 000 tiles is far too
22:32 - much for the poor thing to handle this
22:34 - is a problem for us but just wait a
22:37 - minute how many tiles are actually
22:39 - visible at a time
22:41 - certainly not the full ten thousand i'd
22:44 - say we're only seeing one to two hundred
22:46 - tiles on the screen at once the rest are
22:48 - out of view
22:50 - what do you say to us optimizing our
22:52 - script to only paint the tiles that are
22:54 - actually within the screen bounds
22:57 - for the time being just pop back into
23:00 - the level store sprite and set gmax back
23:03 - to 32 to curb the unbearable lag as i'm
23:06 - afraid this is all we have time for this
