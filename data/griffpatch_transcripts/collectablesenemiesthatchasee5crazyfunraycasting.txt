00:02 - hello fellow scratchers i'm griff patch
00:05 - and welcome back to part five of our
00:08 - two-part series crazy simple ray casting
00:11 - in scratch oh man well that hasn't
00:13 - really played out as i expected but ha
00:16 - not to worry this has been so much fun
00:18 - adding in entities and exploring more
00:20 - complex areas of 2d projection and death
00:22 - sorting has been a blast
00:25 - and if you've got this far then today is
00:27 - going to blow your socks off because we
00:30 - are going to introduce loads of the
00:31 - features you've been asking for
00:33 - collectibles extra enemy types and more
00:36 - importantly getting those enemies to
00:38 - chase us yes that's right so awesome and
00:42 - so this is a great time to save our
00:44 - projects as a new copy for this is
00:46 - episode 5.
00:48 - guys
00:49 - let's get scratching
00:52 - i like to begin each episode by
00:54 - addressing any niggles from the previous
00:55 - episodes and today i will start by
00:58 - pointing out that nano has continued to
00:59 - look a little floaty from day one the
01:02 - reason is that we always expect to see a
01:04 - shadow on the ground by someone's feet
01:06 - nano is no exception many of you noticed
01:08 - that i included one in my youtube
01:10 - thumbnails too so come on then click
01:12 - into the pen sprite and the costume
01:14 - editor
01:16 - if we zoom into nano's feet
01:19 - i'll use the oval tool and select a
01:22 - color of pure black with no outline
01:26 - and then draw a wide oval centered at
01:29 - nano's feet
01:30 - if we click the send to back
01:32 - and then just tidy up the position
01:34 - there and testing the project we can see
01:37 - that this is looking really nice but
01:40 - hold on do you see this this has been a
01:43 - problem for a while too but with the
01:44 - shadows it's now more visible nano's
01:47 - feet appear above the wall
01:50 - interestingly this is only the case when
01:52 - we are far away from them
01:55 - to understand why this is happening we
01:57 - need to see how scratch draws a line
01:59 - between two points
02:00 - we expect a line this long
02:03 - but we get a longer line because scratch
02:05 - adds on a nice rounded end it's this
02:08 - extra half pen width that is making the
02:10 - walls extend down below nano's feet
02:14 - so this should be relatively easy to fix
02:16 - we just reduce the line length by half
02:19 - of the pen width on each side that is
02:21 - res divided by two
02:24 - so still in the pen sprite find the
02:26 - define draw row script
02:30 - we begin our line at a y of the variable
02:33 - height
02:34 - we need to subtract from this half of
02:37 - the pen width
02:39 - so divide
02:42 - res
02:45 - by 2 and pop that back in
02:48 - next we do the same for the bottom of
02:50 - the line but rather than taking away we
02:52 - need to add half of res to it to do this
02:55 - we can just pop a res divided by two in
02:57 - place of the zero
03:00 - cool let's test this out
03:05 - okay here we are and that is looking
03:08 - good yeah super
03:11 - and zooming in and out with the fog
03:13 - slider makes it really clear that this
03:14 - is working perfectly now great
03:19 - now since we are here in the code fixing
03:22 - the wall heights let's just quickly talk
03:24 - about the wall heights themselves
03:27 - i know most of you have kept your walls
03:29 - just the same as mine but watch this you
03:33 - can have so much more fun
03:35 - bring in a multiply block and put the
03:37 - height on the right and return it back
03:40 - from where it came
03:41 - for starters let's multiply this height
03:43 - by 1. testing that and the walls are
03:46 - just as they were but watch the effect
03:48 - of switching this one for a two
03:51 - ha
03:52 - look did you see that the walls are
03:54 - suddenly all tall looking
03:58 - that makes the level feel much bigger
04:00 - and more spacious
04:03 - but why stop there we could use a three
04:06 - wow or four oh man this is huge the
04:11 - level is towering above us either we are
04:13 - now ants or we are in a very formidable
04:16 - maze
04:21 - so what will i set this multiple to i'm
04:24 - going to plumb for 1.5 that just gives
04:28 - ceiling a bit more height but it doesn't
04:30 - push it way above us and i like that
04:35 - so what's next how about we add some
04:37 - more entity types
04:39 - again in the pen sprite open the costume
04:42 - editor
04:43 - we click to choose a new costume
04:46 - what with all this extra height in the
04:47 - level i want a big guy to fill the space
04:50 - and i know just the one frank it is
04:54 - before we can use them though we need
04:55 - them sized correctly if we click into
04:58 - the nano sprite we can grab that 200 by
05:01 - 200 square we drew in episode three to
05:03 - do that we use the selection tool and
05:06 - draw a selection box to overlap the
05:08 - invisible 200x200 box there it is you
05:11 - see
05:12 - hit the copy button and we'll use it
05:14 - again shortly
05:16 - now back into frank's costume let's
05:18 - select all the parts of frank's costume
05:21 - and group them together with the group
05:22 - button and now we can paste in our
05:27 - invisible box
05:28 - oh wow it was actually quite close to
05:31 - the right size wasn't it before we do
05:33 - anything else make the invisible
05:34 - rectangle visible by upping its pen
05:37 - width yep there it is
05:39 - now we can select frank because they're
05:41 - all grouped together and size them down
05:43 - a touch and keep them centered in the
05:46 - middle of the screen but with their feet
05:48 - on the floor
05:49 - that is on the bottom of this square we
05:52 - should add a shadow under their feet too
05:54 - i'm just going to nip into the nano
05:55 - sprite and copy it and paste it back in
05:58 - here we'll need to make it bigger
06:01 - and send it to the back
06:03 - finally select the sizing box again and
06:06 - set the pen width back to 0 to hide it
06:09 - excellent so nano was costume 1 and
06:12 - frank is now costume 2. we need to spawn
06:14 - this new enemy type
06:17 - click into the entities sprite and here
06:19 - we are spawning 25 nanos of costume 1.
06:23 - duplicate the spawn block and we'll add
06:25 - 5 clones of costume 2.
06:29 - cool
06:30 - that was easy let's test that out
06:33 - okay there's loads of nanos there were
06:35 - 25 after all there should be five francs
06:38 - somewhere
06:39 - oh come on frank
06:41 - frank
06:43 - ah
06:44 - something be wrong
06:46 - i should have found one by now so we
06:48 - spawned type twos
06:50 - hold on hold on look here in the define
06:53 - rotate view script oh man we are always
06:56 - drawing type ones that's a bit of a bug
06:59 - this should have been changed to use the
07:01 - type variable
07:03 - and yes look i can see a frank there
07:05 - already yep they were here all along
07:08 - only they were frank's disguised as
07:10 - nanos and very convincingly too
07:19 - you know it would have been much easier
07:20 - to find these franks if we'd been able
07:22 - to see this world map while the game was
07:24 - running with all the entities displayed
07:26 - on it
07:27 - and it isn't hard to do remember how we
07:30 - have set all the ghost effects to 100 to
07:32 - hide the map as it is
07:34 - okay then so click into the stage sprite
07:37 - and we'll make a new variable naming it
07:39 - map ghost
07:41 - no we are not going to be adding ghosts
07:43 - to the level although yes that would be
07:46 - fun
07:47 - this will allow us to toggle the level
07:49 - ghosting effect on and off
07:51 - when green flag clicked set map ghost
07:54 - to 100.
07:57 - things want to start hidden
07:59 - then when m key is pressed
08:05 - set map ghost again
08:07 - but we set it to 100 subtract
08:14 - map ghost
08:17 - we can see this working by tapping the m
08:19 - key over and over it now toggles nicely
08:22 - between 100 and 0. great that's going to
08:25 - make it easy now we just need to tell
08:27 - the other sprites to apply their ghost
08:29 - effects
08:30 - broadcast a new message
08:33 - toggle map
08:38 - first we'll address the player sprite
08:40 - click on them and find some free space
08:43 - when i receive
08:45 - toggle map
08:48 - then set the ghost effect
08:54 - to our variable map ghost
09:00 - i can tap the m key now and there you
09:02 - can see the player is appearing and
09:03 - disappearing obediently
09:05 - now we want the same script in the level
09:08 - sprite so drag one in there
09:13 - and now two in the entities sprite
09:17 - and that's it just those two so let's
09:19 - give this a test click the green flag
09:22 - everything looks normal when things
09:24 - start up but tap the m key hi there we
09:27 - have the map and all the entities wow
09:30 - there are loads of them and of course
09:32 - the players in the middle the fun thing
09:34 - is that i can still drag these entities
09:35 - around the map when it's visible oh
09:37 - that's so cool
09:38 - yeah i can bring them all in
09:41 - and oh yes that one was a frank you know
09:44 - that poses an interesting question
09:46 - shouldn't frank's hitboxes be bigger
09:48 - than nanos because if we move them all
09:50 - over to a wall
09:52 - we can see that frank is now embedded
09:55 - right in it
09:56 - yeah we need their hitbox to be much
09:59 - bigger
10:00 - to fix this make sure we are in the
10:02 - entity sprite oh tidy up that toggle map
10:05 - script that we dragged in
10:07 - and then find with me the when flag
10:10 - clicked script
10:11 - here we set the size of the hitbox for
10:13 - all entities at 225 percent
10:17 - so separate that off and we'll make a
10:19 - duplicate
10:20 - the first we place before the first
10:23 - spawn block this is for nano and 225 was
10:27 - good
10:28 - but before the second spawn this is for
10:30 - frank so set size to something much
10:33 - bigger let's say
10:35 - 400 percent
10:37 - yeah now run that again and press the m
10:40 - key
10:41 - yeah that has given them a lot more body
10:44 - i can find them so much easier and if i
10:47 - move them up against a wall
10:49 - well okay they still overlap a tiny
10:52 - amount but seriously that's not so bad
10:54 - i'll actually stick with this the main
10:56 - thing to consider is that their feet are
10:58 - free of the wall really
11:00 - hey why don't we also change the color
11:03 - of the entities on the map we can match
11:05 - their color to their type somehow um
11:07 - from the looks category bring in a set
11:10 - color effect block i'll make the nanos
11:13 - set color effect to
11:15 - -10
11:18 - but for frank i can set the color effect
11:21 - to
11:22 - 20.
11:23 - let's see that in action
11:25 - oh nice green for frank's and orange for
11:28 - nanos not bad i can bring them all in to
11:31 - make a cool scene hey gosh
11:33 - this is such a laugh you know we could
11:35 - make a scratch movie maker with this
11:37 - couldn't we say cheese guys love this
11:40 - zoom slider
11:42 - but these nanos don't look pleased
11:45 - perhaps it's because they are sick of
11:47 - being stuck in one place and i can't
11:49 - fault them for that guys would you like
11:52 - to start coming to get me
11:54 - i'm right here we want to slowly move
11:57 - each enemy sprite towards the player
12:00 - like this
12:01 - it's easy to demonstrate by dragging
12:02 - them with the mouse and when you forget
12:04 - all the 3d effects we've added on top
12:06 - all we really need to worry about is
12:08 - moving the 2d sprites in the 2d level
12:11 - after all
12:12 - because of this it should be
12:14 - surprisingly easy to get this to work
12:16 - in the entities sprite then scroll down
12:19 - into some free space we'll trigger our
12:22 - scripts off a fresh when i start as
12:24 - clone block
12:28 - this movement will loop forever
12:32 - and we want each entity to first face
12:35 - the player so point towards player
12:40 - and then we simply move forwards
12:44 - oh wow not by 10 that's far too quick in
12:47 - 3d space just move by 0.5 for starters
12:51 - to get a feel for things
12:53 - well that was easy i'm excited shall we
12:56 - run this project
12:58 - oh my gosh they're coming they are all
13:01 - coming and they're not happy i can see
13:03 - them all on the map and oh oh they are
13:06 - cheating they're coming through the
13:08 - walls this is not fair what chance does
13:11 - that give me
13:12 - no we cannot have this the walls must
13:15 - stop them well if we think right back to
13:18 - episode 1 of this tutorial we spent
13:20 - almost the whole episode adding good
13:22 - collision detection code to our player
13:24 - sprite
13:25 - the good news is we can copy those
13:27 - scripts and use them again for the
13:29 - enemies yay
13:30 - so click into the player sprite
13:34 - and we find the define move and the
13:37 - define try move scripts
13:39 - these are the ones we want
13:41 - start by dragging the try move script
13:43 - into the entity sprite
13:45 - and then follow that up with the define
13:47 - move script
13:51 - perfect
13:53 - back into the entities sprite and we can
13:55 - move these scripts into some free space
13:57 - tied it up
13:58 - now find the little enemy game loop
14:01 - under the when i start as clone
14:03 - we just need to switch out this move
14:05 - step block for the shiny new move custom
14:08 - block we just dragged in
14:10 - use the same distance of 0.5 and then
14:13 - make sure to throw away the old blue
14:15 - move block afterwards yeah here we go
14:17 - run the project
14:20 - okay they're still coming for me all
14:21 - right but pop on the map can you see
14:24 - there are plenty of entities still
14:25 - trapped on the other side of the walls
14:27 - it's working brilliant
14:30 - that was easy we can have a much more
14:33 - balanced game of hide and seek now
14:35 - but hold on there is another issue that
14:37 - is becoming clear these entities don't
14:40 - have any concept of personal space they
14:43 - are literally all over each other this
14:45 - will not do at all is there anything we
14:47 - could do
14:48 - and yes of course if we just take a look
14:51 - at the define try move script that we
14:53 - borrowed from the player the movement
14:55 - collisions are restricted to touching
14:58 - level sprites
14:59 - so that stops them going through walls
15:02 - but if we now scroll to the define spawn
15:05 - script where we're first cloning the
15:07 - entities on the level we have an extra
15:09 - check to prevent the entities
15:11 - overlapping each other when they spawn
15:13 - touching level or
15:16 - touching entity aha right then
15:19 - how about we duplicate this or and take
15:22 - it back to the try move script
15:27 - and now pop it in place of the single
15:29 - touching level block
15:31 - there now the entity will not walk over
15:34 - a level wall
15:35 - or another entity that sounds too good
15:38 - to be true only one way to find out run
15:41 - the project
15:43 - and here they come
15:46 - now this is interesting i think yes they
15:48 - are they are colliding with each other
15:50 - and shuffling around surround me
15:52 - completely this is just so cool
15:54 - of course i never added myself as a
15:57 - collidable object so i can just walk
15:59 - through them but but perhaps if i
16:01 - couldn't walk through them and i got
16:02 - trapped by the enemies that in itself
16:04 - would be a really interesting game i'm
16:06 - just saying
16:07 - wait hold on why are these entities no
16:10 - longer coming after me that's a bit
16:12 - surreal perhaps if i walk around them a
16:14 - bit
16:17 - oh yeah here we go so this nano got free
16:19 - and has come for me
16:21 - i think i can see the problem though do
16:23 - you see how the enemy hitboxes are
16:25 - rotating on the map
16:27 - this never used to happen it's been
16:29 - brought in by the move scripts from the
16:31 - player sprite i believe the rotation is
16:34 - causing the sprites to collide after
16:35 - they are rotated and that prevents them
16:37 - from moving away from each other
16:40 - so find our define move block
16:43 - here it is now we don't want either of
16:45 - these switch costumes or set rotation
16:47 - mode blocks so take them out but leave
16:50 - both the try move blocks
16:52 - and these lower ones get rid of the lot
16:56 - now let's try that again
17:01 - here they come they're not rotating on
17:03 - the map check
17:06 - and as they congregate
17:08 - ah i can edge away and yes i think
17:12 - oh yes i think we were right they are
17:14 - free to split apart and come after me
17:17 - sweet
17:18 - bug squished
17:20 - now we are really gaming there's just a
17:22 - big swarm of entities lurking around the
17:24 - middle of the level and then a
17:25 - spattering of others waiting to jump
17:27 - scare me as i come around the corner ah
17:29 - yes like that man
17:32 - so there's so many directions we could
17:35 - take this game i guess the question is
17:37 - what happens when an enemy touches the
17:39 - player well it could be nothing it could
17:42 - be that we get trapped by them and i
17:43 - can't move perhaps we can even push them
17:46 - around that would be fun
17:47 - what we'll do for now though is to add
17:50 - the concept of player health
17:52 - begin by clicking into the player sprite
17:54 - and find a define player tick script
17:59 - this is our player's main game loop
18:01 - so right at the bottom
18:05 - if touching entities
18:12 - that will be any kind of entity
18:15 - next make a new variable
18:17 - health for all sprites
18:20 - and when we touch an entity change
18:22 - health by -1 ouch
18:26 - then if health is less than one
18:36 - then
18:37 - we do something say game over i guess
18:40 - but for now pop in a broadcast
18:45 - game over
18:47 - and i'll leave it to you for an exercise
18:49 - to do something fun with that in your
18:50 - own time
18:52 - we should just scroll up to the when
18:54 - flag clicked
18:56 - and set health to 100 when the game
18:59 - starts
19:03 - there
19:04 - should we test that out
19:07 - so there's my health at 100
19:11 - oh but not for long something must have
19:13 - touched me run away we really need to
19:16 - add some sounds when i get hurt i think
19:18 - that would be cool
19:20 - oh man i wish i had a jump key to jump
19:22 - over these nanos that would be so cool
19:24 - to dodge them like that
19:26 - again though we'll need a way of telling
19:28 - the difference between nanos and franks
19:30 - oh well for another time perhaps
19:32 - oh gosh i'm getting surrounded
19:35 - so we've covered enemies quite a bit but
19:37 - what's the point of running around this
19:38 - level without some other goal how about
19:41 - we add something to collect
19:44 - now i was originally going to reuse the
19:46 - entity sprite for this but i've changed
19:48 - my mind now that entities can bump into
19:51 - and block each other you see i don't
19:53 - want my collectibles to block the
19:55 - enemy's path so instead duplicate the
19:58 - entity's sprite entirely and we'll name
20:00 - this one collectibles
20:05 - then in the scripts what do we need to
20:07 - change well we only want to spawn one
20:10 - type of collectible at present so remove
20:12 - the second set color size and spawn
20:14 - blocks
20:16 - we'll also spawn 10 collectibles
20:19 - and the type that can be a costume
20:21 - number three
20:23 - we'll add that costume in a moment
20:25 - and then scroll down to the when i start
20:28 - as clone loop
20:29 - collectibles don't follow the player so
20:32 - remove the point in direction and the
20:34 - move blocks
20:36 - okay so costume number three
20:39 - click into the pen sprite and let's look
20:42 - at the costumes
20:44 - now i'm going to choose a third costume
20:46 - from the library i'm after something
20:48 - nice and bright i think a star will be
20:51 - perfect
20:52 - now i'm going to go back to nano and
20:54 - copy the 200x200 square yet again
20:57 - then back into the star
21:00 - group the whole costume together
21:03 - before pasting the invisible box
21:06 - and give it some pen width
21:08 - now i'll move the star down just a touch
21:11 - so it's under the player's eye line
21:13 - now i want this star to shine so draw a
21:16 - circle around the entire star
21:21 - we can send it to the back to position
21:23 - it nicely in the center of the star
21:25 - and then change the fill to be a
21:27 - circular gradient
21:30 - the left color we make pure white
21:33 - and the right hand color we can switch
21:36 - to transparent
21:37 - like so
21:39 - oh that's going to look great on the
21:41 - dark background that just leaves us to
21:43 - change the square's pen width to zero to
21:46 - hide it and we are good to test
21:50 - oh cool i can see a star in the
21:52 - background there and on closer
21:53 - inspection well we have two of them and
21:55 - they do look nice i'm loving that very
21:58 - much get away nanos these are not yours
22:00 - they are mine
22:02 - well i'm pretty sure they are mine
22:03 - anyway oh i really want to be able to
22:05 - collect these
22:07 - okay that can't be hard can it you don't
22:09 - need griff batch to teach you this one
22:11 - find the when i starters clone for
22:13 - everloop in the collectible sprite
22:18 - we want to check if they are touching
22:20 - the player sprite
22:26 - and now we definitely need a sound i
22:28 - think there's one in the sound library
22:29 - named collect
22:33 - nice that will do fine
22:36 - so if we touch the player start the
22:39 - sound collect
22:42 - then from the control section we want
22:44 - the delete this clone block there it is
22:48 - so play the sound and delete the
22:50 - collectible neat i think that deserves a
22:52 - test
22:55 - ping oh guys you noticed that sorry
22:58 - coming through yes i've still got two
23:00 - health oh i'm dead i'm dead luckily i
23:04 - haven't implemented that yet
23:06 - so it's cool how these collectibles are
23:09 - all scattered around but i have no idea
23:12 - how many there are left to collect
23:14 - so let's make a counter
23:16 - make a new variable naming it stars
23:20 - for all sprites
23:22 - then find the when flag clicked
23:25 - and before we spawn any of these new
23:27 - collectibles we'll set stars
23:29 - to zero
23:32 - then scroll down
23:34 - find the when i start as clone
23:36 - change stars by one
23:39 - now each time we create a new star we'll
23:41 - count it in this variable
23:43 - and consequently when we collect a star
23:47 - we change stars by
23:51 - -1 to count them back down
23:56 - now this star's counter is really
23:59 - boring you might want to spruce it up by
24:01 - following my awesome number counter
24:03 - tutorial from just a few weeks ago
24:05 - there's a link under the video if you
24:07 - can't find it however the good news is
24:10 - this does appear to be working great oh
24:12 - ah they got me there definitely need
24:15 - some sound or graphical feedback to let
24:17 - me know i'm being hurt
24:19 - right come on i'm going to hide the rest
24:21 - of these variables and give this a
24:22 - proper play
24:23 - can i collect all the stars without
24:25 - losing all 100 health
24:28 - and while i do this i'm sorry to say
24:30 - that we have come to the end of another
24:32 - episode is this the end of the
24:34 - raycasting series i'd have to say no
24:36 - because there's still projectiles
24:38 - jumping level progression and minimap
24:41 - end screen and perhaps a look at even
24:42 - texture mapping who knows i'll put a
24:45 - poll on my channel to see what the
24:46 - general consensus is but i do feel that
24:49 - after five weeks of raycasting it may be
24:51 - time to do something a little different
24:52 - next week
