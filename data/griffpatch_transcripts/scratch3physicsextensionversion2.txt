00:00 - hi this is Griff patch I thought I'd
00:03 - post a video showing the latest updates
00:05 - I've been making to my physics extension
00:07 - which is a little bit of a playground
00:09 - extension really I don't know whether
00:11 - scratchy will ever be able to
00:13 - incorporate this but if you feel that
00:15 - exciting because it's gonna do some
00:17 - really fun things with it you can play
00:19 - with this extension yourself if you go
00:21 - to this web address at the bottom of the
00:23 - page here
00:24 - I shan't read it out I hope you can read
00:26 - that and there'll be a link under the
00:27 - video so you can have a play now this is
00:29 - a version two of my plug-in if you did
00:31 - use the previous version you might find
00:33 - it doesn't work with your projects
00:35 - anymore because I've made quite a lot of
00:36 - changes since then but let's a little at
00:39 - what you can now do with this now we
00:41 - have to apologize for the some of the
00:42 - icons are not quite working that just
00:44 - seems to be a bit of a problem with my
00:47 - deployment critic with patch github
00:49 - account so let's look what this project
00:51 - is doing so some of this physics is very
00:55 - easy to to put into place what we have
00:59 - is we've got the main sprite one which
01:01 - is your Wildcat you can see I'm just I
01:04 - just makes a bit clearer all we're doing
01:07 - is positioning the cat at the center of
01:09 - the screen setting his direction he's
01:12 - pointing in and then we have the physics
01:15 - extension now that can be added to your
01:18 - project through this extension button
01:20 - down here you'll see I've got a box 2d
01:22 - Griff patch physics extension which you
01:25 - can click on and that will add this
01:27 - physics extension to be to your scratch
01:31 - project as long as you're running
01:32 - through my growth patch address of the
01:35 - scratch 3 version which you'll have to
01:36 - use for this so that provides you with
01:39 - these new blocks now it's a lot more
01:41 - than they used to be if you've seen the
01:42 - previous version so let's walk through a
01:44 - bit of them so what we do we've got the
01:46 - positioning cat in the middle there
01:47 - we're setting up the stage and now we've
01:50 - got a type of stage and the one we're
01:53 - using here is open stage no floor so in
01:56 - other words there's no boundary around
01:58 - the edge at all all the objects can fall
01:59 - straight through off the edge and they
02:01 - just keep falling forever out of your
02:03 - view we have an enable for block now
02:08 - what that's doing is saying I want to
02:10 - use physics on this sprite so
02:14 - cat is now using physics it's enabling
02:16 - it for this costume which is why he's
02:18 - wearing right now and in mode normal so
02:21 - we'll leave that black out for now and
02:22 - then we set fixed and the mode is fixed
02:27 - but can rotate what that means is the
02:29 - cat is fixed in place on the screw on
02:31 - the screen he can't fall but he can
02:34 - rotate which is what we're seeing here
02:36 - he's swinging left and right and where's
02:38 - he rotate around well if you look at his
02:40 - costume where the center of this costume
02:44 - is it's just there right on his tail so
02:49 - that is where he's rotating around
02:50 - wherever I have the middle of the
02:52 - costume that is where he rotates so he's
02:55 - retaining around his tail okay then we
03:00 - have a forever loop and we stepped the
03:02 - animation at the simulation now what
03:04 - that means is it runs this physic
03:06 - simulation if I was to just take that
03:07 - off stop it
03:11 - can't let me try it again stop it so if
03:13 - I run that forever loop the physics
03:16 - starts working I stop the federal loop
03:18 - stops as simple as that so you need that
03:23 - in place for it to run the simulation
03:24 - but only in one sprite so one script
03:28 - must be running that steps the
03:29 - simulation that does all the physics for
03:30 - all the sprites if we look in the hen
03:33 - what are we going here let's zoom in a
03:35 - little bit so we've got the green flag
03:38 - clicked and then we have a forever loop
03:41 - inside there and we're creating clones
03:44 - all the time every point 15 seconds
03:47 - which is why they're always appearing
03:50 - and in the start of the clone we show
03:53 - the hand we go to a random position at
03:56 - the top that went in a random direction
04:00 - enable the physics using the new physics
04:03 - blocks or the hen mode normal and then
04:07 - repeat until the position of the hen
04:10 - goes off the bottom of the screen and
04:12 - then we delete the hen that's all we do
04:16 - that's all the whole project is doing is
04:19 - creating hens
04:22 - and simulating and all the rest of the
04:25 - interactions has done through the
04:26 - physics engine itself which you don't
04:28 - have to worry about there's one example
04:32 - now let's look at a more exciting
04:35 - example
04:36 - let's go in for this one here Paula GaN
04:41 - play it to start with you can see what
04:42 - happens this is a bit more interesting
04:45 - physics here we have a ball got some
04:48 - slopes and we have
04:51 - of other nice interaction
04:55 - this physics engine
04:58 - I really like that
05:01 - showing off a little bit more monkey
05:03 - physics
05:10 - now the only clever extra thing in this
05:13 - project rather than the other one is
05:14 - that this we have a special costume here
05:17 - and when I'm enabling the physics for
05:21 - this cost this sprite rather than saying
05:24 - enable for this costume which looks at
05:26 - the costume shape I'm saying for this
05:29 - polygon and this is a special mode that
05:35 - looks at individual polygons in the
05:39 - shape and constructs the physics object
05:40 - for it otherwise if I quickly to show
05:44 - you what happens if I do it for costume
05:46 - instead than that what happens is it
05:50 - will create a costume as if this was a
05:52 - complete square so the ball cannot go
05:55 - inside because it doesn't let you have
05:58 - it's called them convex polygons so you
06:02 - can't have a polygon that goes in and
06:05 - then out again which is what's happening
06:06 - here
06:07 - so what it has to do to actually work is
06:09 - one object it has to have multiple con
06:12 - convex polygons which means they don't
06:15 - go into these three ones or individual
06:17 - polygons and they they don't have any in
06:21 - indents in them they're just completely
06:24 - rectangular and they
06:30 - therefore if I change to polygon mode it
06:33 - looks at the three individual polygons
06:36 - and allows the ball to go inside but it
06:38 - keeps it as one object that's what that
06:41 - was about
06:43 - let's load another example so let's have
06:48 - a look at something that you'll enjoy so
06:53 - scrolling this is a funky one
06:59 - so we have looser balls we have a donut
07:01 - and we have a cat I can press the left
07:03 - and right arrow keys which causes me to
07:05 - rotate
07:08 - and you'll notice this time the screen
07:11 - can scroll which is a bit of a big deal
07:17 - for this project
07:21 - and I can really kick those balls around
07:23 - which is great fun okay
07:29 - so now this is says enable form it's got
07:31 - our blank bit there that's because this
07:32 - was a project I made before I create
07:34 - this new version the extension so
07:35 - unfortunately the bit hasn't quite
07:36 - worked so I should have really replaced
07:38 - that with that enable for this costume
07:42 - all I have in here is a bit of setup the
07:47 - stage is doing setup with an open stage
07:50 - with the floor which means it's got the
07:53 - bottom of the level you cannot fall off
07:55 - everything stops at the bottom but they
07:57 - can go off the edge which is what it
07:59 - means when it there's an open stage with
08:00 - a floor no with a floor I've been able
08:04 - physics for the cat and I have a forever
08:06 - loop here which has got the step
08:08 - simulation in it which means it's
08:10 - running it also checks for key presses
08:12 - and when you press a key press it spins
08:15 - with force so the cat is taught to spin
08:18 - so you can spin it right and you can
08:20 - spin it left the difference with the
08:23 - spin with force rather than the
08:25 - scratches turn is that this will
08:28 - continue to spin with physics so it's
08:30 - like you spin it and it keeps going so
08:34 - that's what happens so he spins when you
08:35 - press a direction steps the simulation
08:37 - and then at the bottom here what have I
08:39 - got this is a right good block look at
08:42 - this
08:44 - change scroll by X now this is kind of
08:48 - it's not really part of the physics
08:49 - engine but it's something that I've
08:50 - added in to the physics engine library
08:53 - which means that you can start to move
08:56 - your whole sprites around the stage
09:01 - without having to do the scroll next of
09:03 - all yourself I can show you this if I
09:06 - just get the change scroll X by block
09:12 - I just put in a value of say 10 in there
09:16 - let's just click that
09:18 - oh stop watch it first they click it
09:22 - everything moves by that amount
09:25 - so I'm actually scrolling screen and
09:27 - what's more this scrolling is not
09:32 - limited by sprites going off the screen
09:34 - so sprites really can go right off the
09:38 - screen in this version of the extension
09:41 - rather than using scratch normal way of
09:43 - making things get stuck to the edge
09:45 - which is important because these when
09:47 - you're scrolling around with lots of
09:48 - physics you don't want them all to stick
09:49 - to the edge you want them to look like
09:51 - they're going off properly so that's
09:52 - what I've managed to achieve so far it
09:55 - does the job quite nicely so that's
09:57 - quite exciting ok let's look at another
10:01 - example this one you're going to love
10:07 - because I love it okay here we are
10:11 - simulating a car we have wheels attached
10:16 - and we have lots of physics example
10:19 - interactions you can race along Scrolls
10:24 - we have a big bear yeah you can push
10:27 - things around
10:29 - and of course we can crash beautifully
10:33 - which is all great fun and
10:38 - oh look at that a wheelie as well we're
10:41 - never done all those Oh No
10:42 - those milk bottles what can you do
10:47 - so physics with wheels now this is using
10:51 - a very similar concept to the other
10:55 - project that had a rotating cat with all
10:57 - the hens in that what you can do is you
11:00 - can if I go into a wheel here and look
11:02 - at the script
11:05 - what I've got here is when I get this
11:08 - receive setup wheels I position the
11:11 - wheel on the screen and I position it if
11:14 - I run the project again
11:18 - in wheels in place where I want them on
11:20 - the screen and I positioned the car
11:21 - where I want it so that it's looking
11:23 - like a car but without fixing anything
11:26 - in place the whole thing would just fall
11:27 - apart what we do is we enable the the
11:32 - physics for this for this wheel using
11:34 - the enable for I've chosen that circle
11:37 - rather than costume or polygon and the
11:40 - reason for that is that if you choose
11:42 - just enable for this costume you'll get
11:44 - a rough outline of a wheel and it won't
11:47 - be perfectly certainly circular because
11:49 - of the pixels and the way it works
11:50 - whereas if you enable it for a circle
11:52 - becomes a perfect circle and it's really
11:54 - good at enrolling so that's what you
11:56 - want to do for any proper circle you
11:57 - want to simulate and it's in mode
11:59 - precision rather than just normal and
12:03 - that is useful when two objects can
12:05 - interact with each other that are both
12:07 - moving so if you if there's ever any
12:09 - interactions I need two objects that
12:11 - both can move rather than say a floor
12:13 - that's completely stationary that's fine
12:15 - but if you need to have two things
12:16 - interacting that are moving you want to
12:18 - put it into precision mode just one of
12:20 - the objects need to be positioned
12:20 - generally the object that's running
12:22 - around it work without it but not as
12:26 - nicely but then this is important thing
12:29 - the wheel
12:29 - I put set fixed fixed but can rotate
12:32 - exactly the same as the cat on the
12:34 - chicken project at the beginning but if
12:38 - you set fixed and can rotate when the
12:40 - wheel is in front of another physics
12:43 - object it fixes it to that object
12:46 - instead of to the background so the
12:48 - wheel is fixed to the car exactly where
12:51 - it's placed
12:54 - then I set up a little bit of of the
12:57 - attributes of this physics object I can
12:59 - set the density so how heavy it is
13:02 - I set how rough it is and I said the
13:04 - wheel to be really rough so it grips the
13:06 - ground and I said it's bounce just to
13:08 - normal
13:10 - and then all the controls for the car
13:13 - are in the wheels so we have a forever
13:16 - loop in the wheel and when the key arrow
13:18 - keys are pressed it spins the wheel and
13:21 - the same with the other wheel exactly
13:23 - the same scripts just in a slightly
13:26 - different position to get him on the
13:27 - other side of the car
13:30 - the car itself look what I've got in
13:33 - here I set up the stage open with no
13:36 - floor again
13:37 - I set the scroll position to start the
13:39 - game so it's not scrolling so it's right
13:41 - in the center of the level position the
13:43 - car went at night direction enable the
13:47 - physics precision mode again and this is
13:49 - where I set up the wheels so once I've
13:51 - positioned the car and got its physics
13:52 - set up i broadcast set of the wheels
13:54 - they position and set up their physics
13:56 - and pin themselves to this car and then
14:00 - I Bought guys go and I begin the game
14:02 - stepping simulation and all the time I
14:06 - update the position of the scrolling too
14:09 - so once the physics has run I changed
14:12 - the scroll based on the position of the
14:14 - car on the level so that it follows it
14:17 - the most simple would actually be not to
14:20 - have any of this at all just to have
14:21 - change scroll by x position of the car I
14:24 - think that mean II would just the car
14:27 - will be right bang smack in the middle
14:29 - of the screen all the time
14:31 - which is what's happening here car is
14:33 - now completely in the center where as
14:36 - what I had was a bit of a clever bit of
14:39 - jiggery-pokery here which allows you if
14:42 - you look now
14:45 - car
14:47 - kind of move out of the center as you
14:48 - race so it actually gives you more view
14:51 - of what's coming
14:55 - about so it's including the velocity so
14:59 - how fast the car is going into the
15:01 - positioning so as a car increases speed
15:03 - it moves me away from the direction it's
15:05 - going in so you can see more that's what
15:07 - this bit here is about a bit of softer
15:08 - scrolling but I say can be simple I can
15:11 - just change scroll backs by X position
15:14 - right so that's that game here let me
15:17 - show you some more so we also have this
15:22 - project
15:26 - okay so this one is more of a platformer
15:28 - so I can walk my cut around can jump
15:33 - interact with all these objects
15:40 - like this i also
15:46 - to fire
15:49 - of course this but I can fire an awful
15:52 - lot of these tacos which is mighty
15:55 - entertaining and these tacos will
15:57 - actually start disappearing after I
15:59 - think 10 seconds or 20 seconds I can
16:01 - remember you'll see them here we go
16:03 - so they can never get too many tacos and
16:07 - if I go over to the left here you might
16:08 - notice that I have a rather
16:13 - recognizable structure which of course I
16:16 - can either run into or I can find my
16:18 - tacos at just to prove a bit of concept
16:22 - that it works there you go
16:26 - so they are a platforming type physics
16:30 - which
16:32 - it's great now how does that work
16:33 - there's a few extra special things going
16:35 - on in this one let's see what blocks
16:37 - I've used
16:41 - this one here think about platforms is
16:45 - you need to know whether you're standing
16:48 - on the ground for example for jumping so
16:50 - I've introduced a new block called
16:52 - touching and you can choose whether you
16:55 - want us check these touching your feet
16:57 - or any part actually to show this
17:00 - example let me load a different project
17:02 - up this one touching is a simple example
17:05 - showing how the touching works so this
17:09 - cat is showing you what he's touching so
17:12 - at the moment he's touching stage which
17:13 - means he's touching the bottom of the
17:15 - stage that we've set up
17:17 - let me change in a time place I pick him
17:20 - out which off him on top of this loaf of
17:22 - bread now set he's touching bread
17:25 - I put him slightly off
17:30 - it's not half rocking me
17:34 - touching stage and bread
17:41 - I think what's happened is that
17:43 - some of my it's gone now I'll come back
17:48 - let me position him back on the screen
17:50 - it goes
17:54 - there we go so he's touching stage and
17:57 - bread if I put the bread on top of his
17:58 - head
18:00 - now reports he's only touching the stage
18:02 - that's because I'm only saying say
18:05 - touching feet as if I put touching any
18:08 - now he's touching boats again so tells
18:11 - me the cat is touching red at a stage
18:14 - I change it to feet is a neat item stage
18:16 - with under underneath it's important
18:19 - now he's just touching red
18:24 - so now I can tell what the cat is
18:25 - touching it returns not just one thing
18:28 - but the two things or more things that
18:31 - he's touching underneath as a string so
18:34 - you can use that you and then find out
18:37 - whether he's touching a particular
18:38 - sprite and it comes up with the name of
18:40 - the sprite in there yeah so I said a
18:46 - quick little look through the blocks
18:48 - that I've defined so we can just know
18:50 - what they all do so we've got set up
18:51 - stage that's to do with how the physics
18:54 - engine is interacting with the whole
18:55 - stage so you can have Bach stage which
18:58 - means there's walls all the way around
19:00 - open with the floor which means it's
19:03 - completely open but there's a floor that
19:05 - stops you from falling down further and
19:06 - there's open no floor which means
19:09 - there's no no no bounds at all it just a
19:11 - being the thing just falls off out of
19:12 - this view
19:15 - that gravity how fast things are falling
19:17 - so if I enable that at the top of my
19:20 - project with it okay so that's a gravity
19:25 - of ten I stick that down to a minus one
19:27 - instead
19:28 - drop him then gravity is now much
19:32 - reduced and equally I can put gravity
19:37 - around so that's great any go out to you
19:40 - like in fact of course I can have
19:41 - gravity pushing sideways too
19:49 - cookie undo that because that's gonna
19:51 - end up with me losing all my objects
19:53 - that's the one thing now of course I've
19:56 - made it says things can got the edge of
19:57 - the stage and now of course I'm losing
19:59 - things which shows you exactly why
20:00 - scratch decided not to allow things go
20:03 - off the edge of the screen however what
20:06 - I would to say is a good idea is that
20:07 - let things go off the screen but when
20:09 - you hit this stop button bring them back
20:10 - on again so I might implement that we'll
20:13 - see at the moment you can get in back
20:15 - generally by just clicking go to button
20:17 - on each bright and it pops back in case
20:19 - you lose it and the best way of course
20:22 - is to have your scripts set them up at
20:24 - the position they need to be the
20:25 - beginning when you click the green flag
20:26 - so that would sort them to what else
20:30 - have we got
20:31 - so enable for so this is when you enable
20:34 - physics every object that you want to
20:36 - interact with each other needs to be
20:38 - enabled so we've got for this costume
20:40 - which gives you a convex polygon around
20:46 - the object and it what that means is it
20:48 - fits a nice rectangle well polygon not a
20:51 - rectangle but a shape around the objects
20:53 - costume and uses that for all the
20:55 - collisions that's what this costume does
20:58 - circle means the object should be
21:00 - treated to the circle polygon is what I
21:03 - showed you in the first second example
21:04 - is where you draw using the vector
21:07 - editor only only two vector editor and
21:09 - you do it using the polygon tool or
21:11 - rectangle tool no nowhere circles or
21:14 - anything like that at the moment that's
21:15 - how it works and all sprites is a quick
21:19 - mode that just enables physics for
21:21 - everything that you've put on the on the
21:22 - on the on the stage so you dr. billet
21:25 - bother doing it to all of them but
21:27 - that's really just for fun we have step
21:30 - simulation and that's used for actually
21:33 - making everything move so I click this
21:34 - you'll see on the right hand side here
21:36 - everything moves by one frame every time
21:40 - I click that so I always do those in a
21:42 - loop we have go to XY so this kind of
21:48 - replaces the motion block go to and
21:51 - there's pretty much exactly the same
21:52 - thing except that we have this drop down
21:56 - to so if I go to 0 0 it's
22:01 - kid now that's a revelant find out why
22:03 - that is is my scroll set
22:07 - yes it is so I've actually scratched
22:10 - three does not reset these variables
22:12 - from project load to project load so
22:14 - when I reload his project and I was
22:15 - scrolling around my previous game my
22:17 - game level is actually scrolled so when
22:20 - I position this in world I positioned it
22:23 - in the center of the world but I'm not
22:26 - looking at the world my game is scrolled
22:28 - to the left by a lot so I need to reset
22:31 - my scroll before I'll actually see my
22:33 - object there he is so now when I
22:36 - positioned him I can see him but I have
22:39 - the option to say position on stage and
22:42 - this worked then exactly like the normal
22:44 - go-to
22:47 - and I also have relative and that means
22:50 - move it from where it is so it's like
22:53 - change X Y instead so now I can move it
22:55 - click it click click
23:02 - I have no idea why he's moving downwards
23:05 - that's a little bit worrying
23:08 - it's like
23:09 - he's being affected by
23:12 - gravity there
23:14 - or
23:17 - something very wrong
23:21 - yes there's definitely something wrong
23:22 - there that that change I think
23:26 - I cannot explain that you'll have to
23:28 - does not use that go to X Y u relative
23:30 - until I fixed it you will see it get
23:33 - fixed if it if it does I also you
23:36 - haven't used that much but it was there
23:37 - for an idea it's through the in world
23:38 - and the on stage that's the most
23:39 - important but anyway leave that for now
23:43 - what else have we got
23:45 - where were we so we've got the go to X Y
23:48 - we've got set velocity to SX sy so this
23:52 - is setting the speed that it's currently
23:54 - traveling at so you can quickly just
23:57 - cause something that we run this if I
23:59 - set velocity to speed Y off ten run it
24:02 - there we are
24:04 - it's like jumping
24:07 - sets his speed at that moment and again
24:11 - I can say speed sideways or diagonally
24:13 - and it just jumps around like that
24:18 - so we have to change velocity which is
24:21 - obviously just a way of changing the
24:23 - current velocity speeding he's going it
24:24 - and you have reporters for the X and y
24:26 - velocity so you can see how fast he is
24:29 - traveling at any moment
24:36 - we got we have push with force in
24:40 - direction so this is very like the set
24:44 - velocity only set Blas t overrides the
24:48 - current velocity so yours replacing
24:49 - saying he is at this moment traveling at
24:52 - this speed
24:52 - this one is additional so if he was
24:56 - already moving in a certain direction
24:57 - this would add force to it and it also
25:00 - is in a specific direction so it's
25:02 - slightly different way of voicing it so
25:04 - if I chose an angle of minus 45 which is
25:06 - like this way you'll be pushed in that
25:09 - direction and divide it 45 degrees
25:12 - I'll come back in him so that's just
25:14 - another way of interacting with the
25:16 - physics spin with force
25:23 - this is spinning in a force of 500 let's
25:27 - do a minus 500 they will spin in the
25:30 - opposite direction
25:32 - there we go
25:35 - you'll have to play around with the
25:38 - values in there because depending on on
25:40 - how heavy the cat is and how much
25:43 - friction he's under things then back and
25:46 - change dramatically know how much force
25:48 - you need to apply then we have set fixed
25:52 - so I've already explained it a little
25:54 - bit but you have the option of fixing
25:57 - something completely in place which is
25:59 - this one fixed but can that's like fixed
26:01 - in place that one if I did that then he
26:05 - absolutely cannot move
26:10 - like that no missed it click they're
26:13 - fixed in place so other objects can bump
26:15 - into him like this piece of bread but he
26:20 - will not move or rotate that's it
26:21 - he's part of the furniture of the level
26:23 - that doesn't mean you can't scroll him
26:25 - round because if you scroll the level if
26:28 - I scroll level but a little bit ports
26:31 - the level moves so he can move by being
26:33 - moved with the scrolling of the level
26:35 - but he is a fixed bit of level that
26:37 - won't move away from the rest of their
26:39 - wall alternative is fixed but can rotate
26:44 - so now he's in the simulation you rotate
26:47 - around his central point
26:51 - there's free which means he can fall
26:52 - around rotate and rotate
26:56 - set density
26:59 - this is actually more than just
27:00 - intensity its density roughness bounce
27:03 - so you're kind of setting up the
27:05 - attributes of his physics so this is the
27:07 - normal way they default to you've got
27:10 - density of normal roughness normal
27:12 - bounce normal and you've got options of
27:14 - very light objects very heavy Bay rough
27:17 - smooth and how much they're going to
27:20 - bounce around like if I can make this
27:21 - cat very bouncy now I run it
27:28 - right
27:31 - that work right again oh yeah
27:35 - there we go now very bouncy
27:40 - touching I went over this is whether
27:43 - he's this brightest is resting on or
27:46 - against another sprite
27:50 - set scroll and
27:52 - change scroll so I can move the level
27:54 - around and the reporters for the scroll
27:57 - and that's everything in this simulation
28:01 - so far so go and have some fun with it I
28:07 - think is the it's the next thing you
28:10 - need to go and do there's lots of
28:13 - potential and I've had a lot of fun
28:16 - making it
28:16 - I don't know like I say whether we still
28:20 - ever make its way officially into
28:21 - scratch and whether this version of it
28:24 - will maybe a more simplified version
28:26 - will find its way in at some point but
28:28 - they do seem very keen on being able to
28:31 - make scratch mean to be more involved in
28:35 - making extensions so I'm quite looking
28:37 - forward to what might be the future for
28:39 - scratch and extensions and I think you
28:43 - guys probably be quite excited too so I
28:45 - thought I'd quickly share this little
28:47 - demonstration of scratch with you
28:50 - physics and can't wait to see what you
28:53 - guys can come up with to if you make
28:56 - your projects in this extension just
28:58 - note that you can save your projects to
29:00 - your hard drive but you can't share them
29:03 - on scratch itself so that's as a
29:08 - limitation but you can save them and
29:09 - load them back again using the file menu
29:11 - so have fun
29:13 - I hope you enjoy that extension and can
29:17 - get on well with it let me know what you
29:19 - managed to create by now
