00:02 - hello fellow scratchers this is a super
00:05 - short but hopefully helpful tutorial on
00:07 - how to create those nice bright trail
00:09 - effects in scratch they were recently
00:12 - featured in my boys video and i got a
00:14 - lot of requests asking how did i do it
00:16 - so without further ado i'll show you
00:19 - i'll start by creating a forever loop so
00:21 - that scratchcat follows my mouse pointer
00:23 - just like this and now we have something
00:26 - to add a trail to so there are two
00:28 - different approaches to creating trails
00:31 - using clones and stamping each with its
00:33 - own benefits and drawbacks
00:36 - first we'll look at the cloning
00:38 - technique
00:39 - drop a crate clone of myself into the
00:41 - forever loop
00:43 - and whew we're off right away you can
00:46 - see that we are leaving a trail of cats
00:48 - behind our mouse and the clones are
00:50 - building up fast in fact within no time
00:53 - at all we hit the 300 clone limit and
00:56 - bam no more clones can be made so the
00:59 - trail stops forming here
01:02 - but not to worry i wasn't envisaging
01:04 - having a trail anywhere near this long
01:06 - anyhow so how do we make it shorter
01:09 - bring in a when i start as clone
01:12 - and a repeat 10 loop
01:15 - after about 10 repeats we can delete
01:18 - this clone the result of this is that
01:21 - each clone will hang around for about 10
01:22 - ticks of our game and then be deleted
01:25 - that's cool
01:27 - but the effect we are after is for the
01:29 - trail to fade away gradually rather than
01:31 - just stopping all at once so from the
01:34 - looks category drop in a change effect
01:36 - by block
01:38 - and we want the ghost effect
01:41 - for now set the change amount to also be
01:44 - 10
01:45 - and then run the project
01:47 - and there we go we have achieved a
01:50 - simple sprite trail that's really smart
01:53 - if i just pause the video for a moment i
01:56 - would like to point something out and
01:57 - that is that the trail left behind by a
02:00 - ghost clone is visible through the clone
02:03 - in front of it and this may not bother
02:06 - you but just remember this for now as i
02:08 - will revisit it later on okay so we have
02:11 - a trail that is 10 clones long what if
02:14 - we want longer trails
02:16 - no problem to make it easy create a new
02:19 - custom block
02:21 - naming it
02:22 - fade
02:23 - over
02:24 - and we need an input of frames
02:27 - and why not finish with a label frames
02:30 - and for once we don't want to run
02:32 - without screen refresh that's because
02:34 - this script wants to perform an
02:36 - animation over a number of frames not
02:39 - run in a single quick frame
02:41 - so we'll drop this in as the first block
02:44 - when i start as clone
02:46 - and the following scripts they can move
02:48 - into the new define block
02:50 - nice
02:51 - the idea then is that we can enter how
02:53 - many frames we want our trail to last
02:55 - for let's try 25 frames
02:59 - so our repeat block can now use the
03:03 - frames input
03:04 - that will be 25 right now
03:07 - but what about this change ghost effect
03:09 - how much do we need to change this by to
03:11 - make the fade last for 25 frames
03:15 - the solution is to consider that a ghost
03:17 - of 100 is fully ghosted so if we divide
03:21 - that 100 into frames that is 25 pieces
03:24 - then that will add back up to 100 after
03:27 - 25 repeats
03:29 - perfect
03:30 - run the project
03:32 - yeah that's splendid very cool indeed
03:35 - now we can choose exactly how long each
03:38 - trail will be
03:40 - so we did it so why isn't this tutorial
03:43 - over well because using clones to create
03:46 - trails is not always possible you see we
03:48 - only have 300 clones to work with at any
03:51 - one time
03:52 - and often we want more than just one
03:55 - sprite to have a trail
03:57 - so i'm going to teach you option two and
04:00 - this one uses the pen extension and
04:03 - stamping so let's rewind and go back to
04:06 - our simple forever loop without any
04:08 - cloning in sight
04:10 - now click on the extensions
04:13 - and choose the pen extension
04:16 - brill we can drop an erase all as the
04:19 - first block in our script just to ensure
04:20 - we begin with a blank pen canvas each
04:23 - time the project runs
04:24 - and try placing a stamp block right
04:27 - after moving the sprite in the forever
04:29 - loop
04:30 - and here we go again we have an endless
04:33 - stamping mouse trail that was easy and
04:35 - this time no clones being created and
04:38 - thus no limit on how long i can go on
04:41 - drawing this trail
04:42 - where we do have a problem is getting
04:45 - this long trail to fade out since once
04:48 - we stamp a sprite it's no longer
04:50 - changeable it's just part of the
04:51 - background
04:53 - well then we'll need another trick and
04:55 - let me show you something
04:57 - start with an eraser all and click that
05:00 - and i'll move scratch cat into the open
05:03 - next up make a new sprite and we'll name
05:06 - it
05:08 - fader i'll make it a bitmap costume and
05:12 - then i can fill it pure white
05:17 - yeah that fully obscures scratch cat for
05:19 - now who is behind this fader sprite
05:22 - some scripts when flag clicked
05:26 - go to zero zero
05:29 - this ensures it fully covers the stage
05:32 - and then go to the back
05:37 - and hide
05:39 - that will bring scratchy into view once
05:41 - more and we want to now click into the
05:43 - scratchcat sprite1
05:45 - and duplicate the stamp block
05:47 - this is what i wanted to show you
05:50 - click stamp
05:51 - and i can now move scratch cat over to
05:53 - the right leaving behind the stamped cat
05:55 - as expected
05:57 - so what happens if we then stamp the
06:00 - white fader sprite
06:02 - right afterwards
06:03 - well no prizes i'm afraid if you guessed
06:05 - that it would stamp the white costume
06:08 - right over the old stamped cat costume
06:11 - they are now completely erased so that
06:13 - wasn't so useful
06:15 - okay then let me set that back up again
06:18 - stamping the cat and come back to the
06:20 - fader sprite once more
06:22 - this time though we set the ghost effect
06:25 - to 50 before we stamp the background
06:31 - so this time when we click the scripts
06:35 - rather than making the whole stage white
06:37 - we only fade it towards white by half 50
06:41 - white
06:42 - that is cool
06:43 - then once more we can stamp the cat
06:46 - where it is and we get a fresh bright
06:48 - cat back in the fader sprite do the
06:51 - stamp again and not only does the last
06:53 - stamped cat fade away but the older
06:56 - faded cat fades out even further that's
06:59 - so cool this process we can just simply
07:02 - repeat over and over each click of the
07:05 - fade script makes the previous stamped
07:07 - graphics fade further and further away
07:09 - until they finally vanish from view
07:12 - i think you get the idea let's put this
07:14 - into practice stick the set ghost effect
07:17 - after the other scripts and bring in a
07:19 - forever loop for our stamp block
07:22 - this will now continually fade away
07:24 - anything that we tried to stamp
07:26 - in our case that would be our scratch
07:28 - cat stamped in its own forever loop over
07:30 - here
07:31 - if we run the project then well can you
07:34 - see the trail yes it's there very subtle
07:37 - but it is there
07:38 - to make it more prominent all we need to
07:40 - do is change this ghost effect to a
07:43 - larger value approaching 100 let's try
07:46 - 90
07:48 - wow guys look at that now this is quite
07:52 - a different effect to the clone based
07:54 - trails
07:55 - firstly if i pause it for a second see
07:58 - how each cat is not transparent you
08:00 - can't see the cat behind showing through
08:04 - that makes the trail a lot cleaner and
08:06 - less confused than the clone based one
08:09 - plus we are no longer creating tons of
08:11 - clones and that is a good thing too
08:14 - but the other difference is that the
08:15 - trail does tend to have this screen burn
08:19 - effect like it fades away but the last
08:22 - residue hangs around for a lot longer
08:24 - than you might otherwise expect
08:26 - well that is the way of it and how this
08:28 - method tends to work do try changing the
08:31 - ghost effect to different values to
08:32 - alter the effect it is actually quite
08:34 - fun and you can try each of these
08:36 - methods using clones or stamping and
08:38 - find the one you prefer
08:40 - many scratch projects use either of
08:42 - these but if you saw my boys video i was
08:45 - using the stamping method for my boyds
08:48 - the reason was that i had way too many
08:50 - clones already to afford using more just
08:52 - for the trails
08:53 - so we come to the end of this short
08:56 - tutorial i hope this was helpful to some
08:58 - of you and that you can just slot that
09:00 - into your projects and have some fun it
09:02 - works great in so many different
09:04 - projects and games feel free to drop me

09:08 - some success with this i'd love to hear
