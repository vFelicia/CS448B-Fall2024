00:00 - hi I'm Chris patch welcome back to my
00:03 - scrolling platformer tutorial for
00:05 - scratch now you might noticed that this
00:09 - little level has changed a bit I was
00:11 - going to look at doing Edney exits today
00:14 - but as it turns out it's been reported
00:18 - to me that there's been a bit of an
00:19 - issue with the currents platform as it
00:20 - is and I'm going to show you that right
00:22 - here what we've discovered is that the
00:25 - red color of course was the lava and
00:26 - that would kill you but it actually
00:28 - kills you when it shouldn't so for
00:30 - example if I walk over here to the edge
00:31 - of this platform and then jump I die if
00:36 - I walk over this Y bit here and I jump I
00:38 - die now why is that well the problem
00:41 - we're having here is that this way the
00:43 - scripts work at the moment is that I
00:45 - detect the touching lava after I move
00:48 - the player but before I move them out of
00:50 - a platform so here I'm travelling up
00:53 - into the air coming down really fast and
00:55 - going through the platform touching the
00:57 - red and dying before it moves me up to
00:59 - say I'm on top of the platform again oh
01:01 - and that's a bit of a shame because that
01:03 - makes the scripts a lot more tricky and
01:05 - I was trying to avoid having to have do
01:07 - any tricky scripting so today I'm going
01:10 - to show you how I would go about fixing
01:12 - this and it really sits how I would have
01:15 - coded it myself anyway had I been coding
01:17 - this platform of myself but I'll say I
01:20 - was trying to make it a little bit
01:20 - easier but so sorry about that I'm gonna
01:22 - have to go a little bit harder you'll
01:25 - note we are using scratch to e now which
01:27 - is come around as that's quite exciting
01:29 - I've had to make this screen a little
01:31 - bit bigger for this YouTube tutorial
01:32 - because if it was any smaller you
01:34 - wouldn't have much size for my scripts
01:36 - so I have added in a little bit of extra
01:39 - red on the platform of sprites as you
01:42 - can see just for testing purposes only
01:45 - so you don't bother buddy knows but you
01:47 - can add them in if you like just so you
01:49 - can test this feature happening on your
01:51 - scratch projects to write to fix this
01:55 - what are we going to do is we're going
01:56 - to split our platform as sprites into
02:00 - two different sprites one for the
02:02 - platforms and one for the lava or the
02:05 - dangerous areas so let me just stop this
02:09 - project so if you might click on
02:11 - platforms and duplicate them
02:14 - move those together like that and then
02:18 - we name it as danger like that okay
02:26 - now what we need to do now is in the
02:29 - danger sprites go to the costumes and
02:32 - what we need to do in each of the
02:33 - different costumes will live and pass
02:35 - the level we've got to remove everything
02:38 - except for the bits that are dangerous
02:40 - so just click in and delete pressing
02:42 - delete key does the trick
02:43 - next level delete these bits it SAS
02:47 - blank sprite but that's fine next one
02:50 - and delete these bits so we are now left
02:54 - with only the bits that kill you in the
02:57 - danger sprite so go back to the platform
03:00 - sprite and then here we need to do the
03:02 - opposite we need to only delete the bits
03:04 - that kill you so if we delete the red
03:06 - bits go to the next costume note that
03:10 - all stays I only delete the red bit okay
03:14 - so now we've called completely split out
03:17 - the platforms from the bits that hurt
03:19 - you okay let's just run that just make
03:22 - sure that it is running so here we are
03:27 - now you can see we can still see both
03:31 - the red bits and the platform's just as
03:35 - if it had been a single costume now the
03:38 - reason it's working is because we've
03:39 - just duplicated up this code and all of
03:42 - the scripts for positioning each of
03:44 - those level pieces and the danger pieces
03:46 - are exactly the same so it's showing
03:48 - both sets so what we'll find is that we
03:51 - still die if we jump here because we're
03:54 - still touching the red so we need to
03:56 - change the scripts now not to be the
03:58 - touching red anymore so let's stop that
04:00 - so this is in our player sprite within
04:05 - the define change player X custom block
04:08 - we've got this test die call now we no
04:11 - longer want that so right click on test
04:13 - die and say delete block beautifully
04:17 - deletes that little block them within
04:19 - there which is a new feature of scratch
04:20 - 3 which is very useful rather than
04:22 - having to rearrange things a lot now we
04:24 - wanted the same in the change player why
04:27 - find that it is say get rid of the test
04:30 - die right-click it
04:32 - delete block okay so now we shouldn't be
04:35 - the die at all if we there we go so now
04:38 - we fall straight through and he read
04:40 - because weird is no longer platforms and
04:44 - all are touching scripts are touching
04:46 - platforms so it's no longer looking at
04:48 - those at all which is great so we can
04:50 - have fall through lava so what we need
04:52 - to do now is add back in a test that
04:54 - actually checks that we're touching a
04:56 - real lava so if we go along to our
04:59 - script called test die it used to be
05:01 - touching color red so we're going to
05:03 - change that get rid of the touching
05:05 - color red and we're going to be having
05:07 - touching illnesses touching mouse
05:10 - pointer change it to be danger so if we
05:15 - touch any danger sprites then we're
05:18 - going to set the exit now at the moment
05:20 - we're no longer using this test die
05:21 - because we just removed it so we need to
05:23 - put that back in but this is the
05:25 - critical change because we can put it in
05:27 - after we've changed pair Y here in the
05:30 - tick script so let's just get that
05:33 - scroll out of the way I'm gonna put it
05:36 - in just here so we want to go to my
05:39 - blocks and do a test I just there then
05:44 - put the scrolling back in so what's
05:46 - gonna happen now is it's gonna move our
05:48 - player we're gonna be pushed back out of
05:50 - the platform like we want to be and only
05:52 - then does it test to see if we're
05:53 - touching any larva still let's give that
05:56 - a run so first off there we go we died
06:01 - but let's try on the edge jump jump
06:04 - fine yeah yeah we're just fine so I
06:08 - think that is going to solve all our
06:11 - problems and it's quite nice because
06:14 - previously when we touch lava we would
06:16 - only be on the surface of the lava but
06:18 - now we actually can sink in a bit before
06:20 - we die which I quite like anyway so
06:23 - that's great
06:25 - okay so that solves the problem and it's
06:28 - not too difficult to implement but
06:31 - here's the slight problem now when
06:34 - you're designing your levels you've got
06:37 - to design them in the platform script
06:39 - let's try another one
06:41 - duplicate a piece of platform level I'm
06:46 - going to call it oh it's all the way of
06:47 - course it's labeled it already layer 1 4
06:49 - so we could draw our new bit of level in
06:52 - here just like we would have done in
06:54 - scratch - let me design it or honky-dory
06:59 - like this copy/paste ok
07:14 - so here's our new level but we want
07:17 - larvae in this one too but of course
07:21 - when we draw our lover here it's only
07:24 - going to be temporary he wearing an
07:25 - adroit in here and then we're going to
07:28 - have to move it into the danger sprite
07:31 - instead often it's useful to draw it in
07:33 - here even so because you're drawing it
07:37 - with the other part of the level visible
07:38 - otherwise if you're doing in here doing
07:40 - it blind and it's very hard to know if
07:41 - you're drawing in to my place so there's
07:43 - that the good thing about now the way
07:46 - we've done this lava is it doesn't have
07:48 - to be red anymore you can actually have
07:50 - any color you like
07:50 - so let's choose a slightly different
07:52 - color just for some fun a slightly
07:54 - dangerous bluey
07:57 - dark purple this we can test to make
08:03 - sure it works first let's add in a new
08:06 - clone for this new bit of level and
08:09 - we'll add it and just like we used to do
08:10 - and I run that let's make sure that our
08:12 - new bit of level has appeared here it is
08:16 - good but of course purple is not going
08:19 - to kill us at all in fact purple is at
08:23 - the moment a solid platform because it's
08:25 - in the platforms and then we no longer
08:27 - want anything in platforms that we can't
08:28 - walk on it's going to kill you or
08:30 - anything so we need to stop a project
08:32 - and we need to move our costume for the
08:35 - death into the danger so go into your
08:38 - costumes we need to copy this costume
08:42 - we've just drawn into danger so drop it
08:44 - into danger then into danger another
08:48 - dangerous sprite we can go and look what
08:50 - we can now do is remove everything that
08:52 - isn't dangerous from that sprite costume
08:56 - like that and back into platforms and
08:59 - remove the dangerous bit so in the
09:02 - platform's we've got the new bit of
09:03 - level the danger we've got the danger
09:06 - that's almost everything but remember
09:08 - the scripts also need changing so if you
09:10 - go into our scripts again we need to add
09:14 - this extra clone into the danger sprite
09:17 - as well as this one so let me just drop
09:19 - that into the dangerous bright and you
09:24 - want to put that into the here - so
09:25 - these scripts always have to stay the
09:27 - same in the
09:28 - two different stripes the platforms and
09:31 - the danger so that they're both being
09:33 - created in the same way let's run that
09:36 - and make sure it works there we go and
09:42 - if we go in there we go we die
09:46 - and that is it for this tutorial
09:51 - sorry it wasn't on know what I was going
09:53 - to do it on but this is a pretty good
09:55 - fix that we need to do to make this game
09:56 - work more robustly you can choose
09:59 - whether you want to do this or whether
10:00 - you don't because you programs they
10:02 - still work without these changes but
10:05 - there are cases where you will get
10:07 - player dying if you're not careful and
10:09 - design the level in a way that avoids it
10:11 - so that concludes this tutorial I hope
10:13 - you understand that and I hope you'll
10:15 - also understand that now we can do more
10:16 - interesting death sprites because they
10:20 - can be all different colors too and that
10:22 - can make your level look a lot more fun
10:24 - because you can design it any way you
10:26 - like
10:26 - so tune in next time bye now
