00:00 - hi sis Griff patch this is my second
00:02 - part of my top down scrolling game
00:04 - tutorial for scratch today we are going
00:08 - to look at how to add in enemies this is
00:11 - a very simple enemy artificial
00:13 - intelligence let's start by adding in a
00:15 - new sprite like so and this is going to
00:19 - be an enemy cube so let's add in a new
00:23 - color for this enemy cube and I'm going
00:25 - to make it green
00:28 - I kind of nasty dark green because it's
00:31 - a zombie and I'm gonna destroy it in
00:34 - here like this again shift to make it
00:36 - square there he is
00:38 - my zombie cube so this guy here is gonna
00:41 - be following my player so let's just
00:44 - call him zombie cube into code now he
00:49 - needs an X for this sprite only and
00:54 - another available y for this right only
00:57 - and he's a lowercase not uppercase
00:59 - because they're for this sprite only
01:01 - let's have in a event and when I receive
01:05 - setup I'm at now this is where we
01:11 - positioned the zombie cube for his first
01:14 - initial appearance so we'll set X and y
01:18 - and we can't use the arrow because
01:20 - that'll be white on top of our cube so
01:21 - left for now let's put minus 200 by zero
01:26 - which is pretty much where he is now
01:28 - okay and then we also need if we go into
01:33 - the level sprite
01:35 - let's drag in this move level into the
01:39 - zombie cube is that will then quickly
01:42 - position him properly for well scrolling
01:45 - such as will net so here we go there's
01:48 - our zombie cube and in nicely sits
01:52 - crawls with the level which is what we
01:53 - want
01:57 - notice if we got off the edge of the
01:58 - screen he stays stuck to the edge so
02:02 - we'll have to fix that okay so what
02:04 - we're going to do is add in a custom
02:06 - block make block and call it position
02:09 - and we could have an argument X and
02:12 - argument Y one without screen refresh so
02:17 - okay and now in here we're going to add
02:21 - in our go-to block like this put the new
02:26 - position into the more level receiver
02:32 - and then x- croelick's y- scroll why go
02:35 - in there
02:36 - than the X&Y I can go in like that okay
02:39 - now the reason we do this is we're now
02:40 - going to add another variable called is
02:44 - visible although a case and for this
02:47 - sprite only
02:50 - we can set that here under the go to and
02:53 - in here we're going to add in and and
02:56 - and then to equals on on your side like
03:02 - this
03:04 - let's make a little bit more room for us
03:06 - and in here we're going to have X Y and
03:13 - then we need the actual positions on the
03:17 - screen so x position and y position so
03:24 - his visible is going to be set to true
03:26 - when we manage to position the zombie
03:29 - cube where he was supposed to be if he
03:32 - doesn't go where he's meant to be is
03:33 - visible be false let's just watch that
03:36 - in action I run this project now so it's
03:40 - visible is true so it's Amba cubes there
03:42 - which is good I move for too far to the
03:44 - right and I got to false so he shouldn't
03:48 - be showing them though she is showing
03:51 - shouldn't be showing you can see the
03:52 - true and false changing we can make use
03:55 - of this fact to hide him when he's
03:56 - off-screen and more than that what we
04:00 - gonna do with this game is he we only
04:01 - move these zombie cubes when they are on
04:04 - the screen if they're off-screen they
04:05 - don't move so they don't walk onto
04:08 - screen otherwise all the zombies on the
04:10 - whole level would come straight at you
04:12 - at the very beginning and not be where
04:13 - they're meant to be their mentor kind of
04:15 - appear as you find them on the level so
04:17 - that's what we're going to use is true
04:18 - and false here ok so let's go back to
04:21 - the program we can hide that variable
04:24 - visible now so what we want to do is
04:27 - have this enemy cube move towards the
04:30 - red player but only when he's on screen
04:33 - so let's give that a go in the player
04:37 - sprite we still have this loop here so
04:40 - remove the player we move the level and
04:43 - next we want to move the enemy cubes so
04:47 - it's quite another broadcast underneath
04:48 - and we're going to call this move enemy
04:55 - like so ok we can go back into our enemy
04:59 - sprite finest rename this to zombie or
05:02 - enemy you choose what you want to call
05:03 - it and we're gonna have a receiver in
05:06 - here and I receive move enemy
05:14 - so let's put an if/else in here
05:19 - and what we're going to do first is
05:22 - going to check whether we're on screen
05:24 - and we've got that in this is visible so
05:26 - if we put an equals go into variables
05:30 - and have not my verbal is visible and
05:34 - put in here true
05:37 - GRU II okay just like it was set to so
05:40 - when it's on-screen it wants this bit
05:42 - it's off screen it runs this bit so
05:44 - first of all that's going to looks and
05:46 - hide when it's in the off screen show
05:50 - when it's on the on screen let's run
05:52 - that just to make sure that works so
05:55 - he's visible off screen disappears on
05:57 - screen appears so now he's no longer
06:00 - sticking to the side of the screen right
06:02 - what we're gonna do when we want to move
06:04 - our little player then so let's add in a
06:06 - custom block for moving him and we'll
06:08 - call it follow
06:13 - player one without screen refresh
06:18 - okay
06:21 - and move that underneath the show like
06:25 - that and let's move this down even
06:28 - further so follow player what are we
06:31 - going to put in here right so we need an
06:36 - if statement and then we need some
06:40 - comparisons so if this example the
06:42 - player is to the right of zombie cube we
06:45 - want to move the right so let's put a
06:47 - greater than now this wants to be the
06:52 - position of the player so for that we
06:57 - have to look in sensing
07:00 - and this block here which says backdrop
07:02 - of stage now it might seem a bit strange
07:05 - but this is the one we need because in
07:07 - here you can change stage to player now
07:12 - watch out it jumps up to the top it
07:13 - always does that but I think they're
07:15 - gonna fix that book soon hopefully
07:18 - change the left-hand side you can now
07:21 - choose the variable X naught X position
07:24 - X cuz that's available of our player
07:27 - sprite that howls where our player is
07:28 - there we go so now we can say if the
07:33 - position of the player it's greater than
07:39 - X like so now this X is our zombie's X
07:43 - so if the player here is bigger than the
07:48 - zombies X so to the right of we want to
07:50 - move our zombie to the right so now we
07:55 - can borrow these scripts form player so
07:59 - just like in here where we move a
08:00 - direction if a certain condition is true
08:02 - so let's move this custom block into
08:06 - zombie
08:09 - and where did it go there it is
08:12 - just put it here for now
08:14 - so if it's to the right we want to try
08:19 - move and we'll move it one pixel to the
08:23 - right and we won't move up try 1 comma 0
08:28 - okay let's just go and have a look at
08:30 - our
08:32 - try and move we might need to change us
08:34 - a little bit okay what we need to change
08:35 - in here is rather than doing the go -
08:38 - let's use our position that we created
08:41 - and move the whole positioning
08:45 - there was into that instead so not using
08:47 - the go-to no reason we want to do that
08:50 - is that this position you remember your
08:53 - ground here also settee is visible so we
08:57 - know that if we try moving to a new
08:59 - position without a zombie cube if we
09:02 - position them off-screen then we don't
09:04 - want to allow to do that because we
09:05 - don't want to allow the zombie cube to
09:08 - move away from the screen because that
09:10 - can cause problems because you can't
09:12 - tell if it's touching at wall if he's
09:14 - moving off screen because the touching
09:16 - color only works if it's on screen which
09:19 - is a big problem for the scrolling games
09:21 - so we're going to get around that by
09:24 - detecting a physical screen and then not
09:26 - letting him move so put in a hand down
09:29 - here into the if block and we're going
09:35 - to check that he's on screen here so
09:36 - only allow him to actually move equals
09:40 - it's visible where is it there it is is
09:44 - visible so it's visible equals true and
09:47 - he's not touching a wall then allowing
09:50 - to move
09:51 - let's just delete that myvariable really
09:53 - don't need it that's better was it more
09:55 - confusion than it needs to okay that
09:58 - what means he should let's just run that
10:00 - see if it actually works
10:01 - hey look at this so he's now moving to
10:04 - the right of course it can't hurt me and
10:06 - he can't move any other direction part
10:10 - firm to the right let's just see where
10:13 - they can get through the wall if I move
10:14 - around here
10:17 - you
10:20 - no stopped that's brilliant
10:24 - so let's put in his other directions
10:29 - where is here we go so in the follow
10:32 - player so at the moment we've only got
10:34 - to moving to the right let's add in some
10:36 - other ones so duplicate that so if he is
10:39 - less than less than less than if player
10:44 - X is less than X
10:51 - and move him by minus one so now he
10:54 - should be two moves left as well so the
10:56 - moment is moving to the right on the
10:58 - other side of him now he moves to the
11:00 - left
11:02 - so now all we need is up and down so
11:04 - let's do that so if we duplicate these
11:08 - so it's going to be Y off player now and
11:12 - why player and available y available Y
11:18 - so if Y of player is bigger than Y we
11:22 - want to be up so through 0 X 1 Y in the
11:25 - Tri move and then this one 0 and minus 1
11:29 - so moving up and down which one that now
11:35 - now you see quite happily following me
11:40 - I move down here out of the way
11:44 - it's desperately trying to follow me but
11:46 - he's not gonna get me cuz I'm far too
11:49 - fast for him
11:52 - if I move off-screen come back he moves
11:58 - disappears now he should not be
12:01 - following me now if I go back on here he
12:02 - should appear see not following till he
12:06 - is on the screen there we go so this is
12:10 - a really big start was our game
12:14 - at the moment he's not getting stuck on
12:16 - anything which is quite impressive
12:17 - because when I was playing earlier he
12:21 - would get stuck on walls quite happily
12:23 - and we're gonna have to fix that because
12:25 - it does happen okay one more tweak that
12:28 - we need to to do to this is in the
12:35 - oh here we are at the bottom of the
12:36 - follow here we need to move him to
12:39 - exactly where he supposed to be at the
12:41 - end of moving because if we tried to
12:43 - move and it failed it leaves him still
12:46 - overlapping the level so all we need to
12:49 - do for that is add in another position
12:52 - core what we need to do for that is copy
12:55 - the this position here
12:58 - in the move level
13:01 - and put that at the bottom of the follow
13:04 - player like that so after we finished
13:06 - moving it positions him where he's meant
13:08 - to end up just run that and make sure
13:10 - that all works shouldn't really notice
13:13 - much difference there we go
13:16 - so we have one zombie coupe but it's
13:20 - really only gonna get really exciting
13:21 - when we have lots more so this is the
13:24 - end of this tutorial but next time I'm
13:26 - gonna introduce lots more zombie cubes
13:28 - and how you set them up nice and easily
13:30 - and it's going to make the game much
13:31 - more fun so join me next time subscribe
13:33 - to me thanks for watching
13:35 - this is Griff patch bye now
