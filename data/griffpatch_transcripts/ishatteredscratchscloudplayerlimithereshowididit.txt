00:00 - foreign
00:03 - scratchers if you didn't know I have
00:05 - been working hard on a new Minecraft MMO
00:08 - scratch game something I've been wanting
00:10 - to try to go for a really long time but
00:12 - technically it's been quite a challenge
00:14 - in this video I'm going to take you on a
00:17 - deep dive into the tricks I discovered
00:19 - that helped me to make this multiplayer
00:21 - Masterpiece possible in scratch now MMO
00:25 - stands for massive multiplayer online
00:27 - and as such you may see as many as 60
00:30 - scratches in game simultaneously Yes you
00:33 - heard me right 60 players all mining
00:36 - crafting chatting and swapping items in
00:39 - the same game world now I simply love
00:41 - walking around and seeing what my fellow
00:43 - scratches have been building from Deep
00:46 - mines to Pumpkin houses nice one be
00:48 - legal102
00:50 - so as with all online scratch games this
00:54 - project is built using the humble Cloud
00:56 - variable they work like normal variables
00:58 - except their values are shared across
01:01 - the internet to all the other players of
01:03 - your scratch project very cool but with
01:06 - serious limitations they can only store
01:09 - numbers not text
01:11 - and after setting a cloud variable you
01:14 - must wait a tenth of a second before
01:16 - setting another one to avoid facing
01:18 - stability issues and you can only have
01:21 - 10 of them per project but before we
01:24 - talk any more about Cloud variables what
01:26 - about the scrolling platformer engine
01:28 - does this look familiar to you it's
01:31 - actually adapted directly from episode 4
01:34 - or 5 of my titled RPG tutorial yes so
01:38 - this is a 500 by 100 tiled grid list
01:41 - where the tile set costumes were sourced
01:44 - directly from the Minecraft sample
01:46 - resources on GitHub and it works just
01:49 - great the tiles of stamped and so it
01:51 - uses minimal clones and I've used very
01:54 - basic platformer scripts like those in
01:56 - my early tiled Mario tutorials and
01:59 - really enough said about that I was just
02:01 - pleased I could adapt the code so
02:03 - quickly and save all that rethinking
02:06 - so next up I need the multiplayer code
02:08 - again I was able to reuse some of my
02:11 - existing scripts to get the Head Start
02:13 - specifically for my MMO platformer game
02:16 - but we should take a step back and let's
02:19 - first take a look at the precursor to
02:21 - this my first successful cloud game
02:23 - Cloud platformer multiplayer fun all my
02:26 - cloud games up until very recently
02:28 - worked just like this one we have eight
02:30 - Cloud variables for the players and we
02:33 - allocate them out one per player
02:35 - then each player's scratch project is
02:37 - responsible for taking the player's
02:39 - username their position on the screen
02:41 - and the costume number and encoding all
02:43 - of that into a single Cloud variable
02:46 - friendly value or data packet if you
02:49 - will they then set their allotted Cloud
02:51 - variable to this value as do all the
02:54 - other players and in this way all the
02:56 - connected scratch projects know who is
02:58 - playing and where they should be on the
03:00 - screen and it works really well but it
03:02 - does have an obvious limitation we can't
03:05 - support more than 8 to 10 players at a
03:08 - time then along comes my new
03:11 - experimental MMO platformer project and
03:14 - this one blows the 10 player limit right
03:17 - out of the water and far up the beach
03:20 - see for yourself as I'm joined by over
03:22 - 130 of my fellow scratches all in game
03:26 - at the same time what magic is this well
03:29 - it's actually pretty straightforward let
03:32 - me explain
03:34 - as before each player's scratch project
03:36 - constructs a data value from their
03:39 - username and Sprite positions Etc but
03:41 - this time they just pick any of the
03:43 - cloud variables at random and set it to
03:46 - their data value
03:48 - now all 140 players of the game will see
03:52 - that cloud variable change value and
03:55 - this is where it gets funky each project
03:58 - maintains two lists the first contains
04:01 - the names of players who've joined the
04:03 - game by decoding the start of the
04:06 - incoming Cloud variable we can identify
04:08 - who sent it this one's username is guy
04:11 - if they've already joined then we find
04:13 - them in the name list and use the second
04:16 - list to store the actual cloud value
04:18 - alongside their name both at the same
04:20 - item number this is called a key value
04:23 - pair
04:24 - the other case is that the cloud
04:26 - available is for a player we have yet to
04:28 - see before a new player in this case we
04:31 - simply add them to the player names list
04:33 - and insert the cloud value too and that
04:37 - is it awesome by using lists to store
04:39 - the cloud data we are no longer
04:41 - restricted to a maximum of 10 players
04:43 - and the players sharing the same Cloud
04:46 - variable do not have to worry about
04:47 - overriding each other as the list keeps
04:49 - each player's code safely stored away so
04:53 - cool
04:54 - it's then just a matter of cloning a
04:56 - Sprite for each new player and decoding
04:58 - their position for display
05:01 - so since this Cloud engine worked so
05:04 - well I dropped it into my modified RPG
05:07 - engine and yay it's perfect for running
05:10 - and jumping around with all my friends
05:11 - but that's really only half the story
05:14 - not only do we need to synchronize our
05:17 - player movements via the cloud but also
05:19 - the state of the entire game World 2 and
05:23 - this is a huge problem a huge problem
05:27 - indeed because a level consists of 50
05:31 - 000 tiles back when Cloud variables
05:34 - didn't have a limit on their size we
05:36 - could in fact squeeze an entire level
05:37 - into one variable think scratch Aria but
05:41 - sadly as of 2023 we can only squeeze in
05:45 - 256 digits at a time scratch Aria r i p
05:50 - the next idea would be to split the
05:52 - level code up into chunks and send them
05:55 - one at a time across the cloud
05:57 - well with the limits on cloud updates
05:59 - that would take a full two minutes
06:02 - that's a long time to wait for a game to
06:04 - load and who is going to be sending this
06:07 - anyway we need this to somehow
06:09 - self-coordinate between all the players
06:12 - of the game
06:13 - so to cut down on the amount of data
06:16 - that needs to be sent I decided to begin
06:18 - the game with a predefined world akin to
06:21 - the Demo World on Minecraft that would
06:24 - allow all projects to load up instantly
06:26 - in a common Land good
06:29 - then as players mine and place blocks
06:31 - all we need to worry about is keeping a
06:34 - list of these changes and sending these
06:36 - details to everyone else
06:38 - obviously the list of changes will
06:41 - gradually grow quite large and so we
06:43 - can't send them all at once so instead
06:47 - we keep a record of the last sent block
06:49 - and cycle around the list
06:51 - sending just four or five updates along
06:55 - with our normal username and position
06:56 - data
06:58 - in this way every player will eventually
07:00 - see every block that we've modified
07:04 - Splendid we have a workable solution but
07:07 - as with all good ideas there's always
07:09 - issues to be teased out for example when
07:12 - another player changes a block that we
07:14 - previously changed ourselves we have to
07:16 - be careful we don't accidentally
07:18 - overwrite it again with our recorded
07:20 - change so remove the record of our
07:23 - change as soon as another user
07:25 - overwrites it it's useful to keep a
07:28 - record of who changed each tile and when
07:30 - to best resolve these conflicts you can
07:33 - see this working in game by holding
07:35 - space
07:37 - so that's who stole my precious cake
07:41 - another issue that causes a lot of
07:43 - trouble is when a player leaves the gate
07:46 - all existing players would continue
07:48 - seeing Bob's glorious house exactly as
07:50 - Bob left it
07:52 - but a new player joining the game will
07:55 - not see Bob's house at all why is this
07:58 - well because Bob is no longer around to
08:01 - send his tile edits to the new players
08:04 - and they are seeing the level as if Bob
08:07 - never existed and this is a serious
08:10 - problem because the levels are out of
08:12 - sync between players and it's never
08:14 - gonna sort itself out
08:16 - we must have consistency between our
08:18 - players or this game will fall apart
08:22 - the easiest solution is after Bob leaves
08:25 - to reset all his changes for everyone
08:29 - and since I'm already keeping a record
08:31 - of who modified which game tiles this
08:34 - shouldn't be hard goodbye bobville and
08:37 - sorry to that poor scratcher exploring
08:39 - Bob's mind
08:41 - [Music]
08:42 - sad but the plus side to this strategy
08:46 - is at a level which would slowly have
08:48 - descended into chaos that's entropy in
08:50 - action my friends now continually
08:52 - self-repairs as players leave if all is
08:55 - well we strike a nice balance and
08:58 - everybody can have a lot of fun
09:00 - obviously there's tons more I could talk
09:02 - about the inventory hot bar crafting
09:05 - smelting player costumes armor but
09:07 - what's interesting is where this project
09:09 - is heading I began it as a mere
09:12 - experiment to see whether it was even
09:13 - possible to make an online multiplayer
09:15 - Minecraft Style game and the answer is a
09:18 - very positive yes but there are things I
09:20 - have not yet added and with good reason
09:23 - let me go over those uh Falling Sand and
09:26 - Gravel blocks these are particularly
09:28 - tricky since once a block moves I have
09:30 - to decide where it ends up and who is
09:33 - the owner the consistency across
09:35 - computers far harder than it sounds
09:38 - water and lava for the same reason as
09:41 - sand and gravel any tile with movement
09:42 - brings me lots of pain maybe one day
09:45 - I'll look into it and figure something
09:46 - out
09:47 - then there's day night and Illumination
09:50 - in general calculating this is quite
09:53 - expensive even in a single player game
09:55 - if I was to extend this out for 60
09:57 - players all editing the map it's going
09:59 - to be too slow trust me perhaps there's
10:02 - some clever trick I could use but I
10:04 - haven't thought of it yet
10:06 - our chests now then these would be cool
10:08 - but it's another layer of complexity but
10:11 - where do we store the chess data and how
10:14 - do we make sure it's synchronized over
10:16 - the cloud one to ponder
10:18 - PVP this has come up so many times
10:20 - seriously this is a peaceful game the
10:23 - biggest problem is that the game lag
10:25 - means that everybody is a half second or
10:28 - so behind each other and movement wise
10:30 - and when you think you might have hit
10:31 - someone but you didn't and vice versa
10:34 - nobody wins and no one ends up happy
10:38 - then there's mobs oh man usually for
10:41 - these I end up having one player's
10:43 - computer take control of the mobs
10:45 - nearest to them but sending enough data
10:47 - to make that work will be super hard
10:49 - given the current cloud restrictions I
10:52 - would really love to add some pigs and
10:53 - chickens I have pondered on providing
10:56 - say masks that let you take on a roll of
10:59 - a different mob so players can play as
11:01 - people or other mobs like Piggies or
11:04 - chickens I don't know what do you think
11:06 - could be really entertaining if you
11:08 - agree then why not drop me a comment and
11:10 - lastly safe zones and teaming it's
11:13 - obvious that there are a number of
11:15 - people who find it more fun to destroy
11:17 - people's hard work than build themselves
11:19 - and I really don't approve so I wonder
11:22 - if there's something clever I could do
11:23 - to help prevent it and still support
11:25 - collaborative building hmm tricky so let
11:29 - the discussion begin I value your ideas
11:32 - and thoughts do drop me a comment well I
11:36 - hope you enjoyed that little technical
11:37 - overview and update if you did then
11:40 - please say thanks by Smashing the like
11:42 - button under the video I'm having a lot
11:44 - of fun coding this game and I'd love
11:46 - your feedback so do drop me a comment or
11:48 - two if you haven't yet subscribed to my
11:50 - channel then you can do that now and
11:52 - don't forget to toggle that little bell
11:53 - icon so as not to miss being notified
11:55 - that my next video has dropped so I'll
11:58 - see you again soon but until then take
12:01 - care and have a great week ahead and
12:04 - scratch on guys
12:06 - [Music]
