00:00 - hi Grif patch here and I want to show
00:02 - you today how to create a simple
00:04 - scrolling game in scratch it's gonna be
00:07 - really basic because there's lots to do
00:09 - with scrolling games when things get
00:11 - complicated but I want to really try
00:13 - keep this as easy as possible so this is
00:15 - the little project I've put together
00:16 - here you can see I've got scratch cat
00:18 - I've got some things moving I can move
00:21 - around and if I move to the right the
00:23 - level Scrolls and all is good so let's
00:27 - start off with a completely blank
00:28 - project create new project
00:32 - so what I'll try and do is go through
00:34 - quite quickly creating the project and
00:36 - then maybe I'll explain more detail
00:38 - afterwards let's see how that goes so
00:40 - new project starts there scratch cats
00:42 - give it a name scrolling project okay
00:47 - and I'm gonna name my scratch cat as
00:49 - player so we know who he is
00:51 - this is dar player and I make him so he
00:54 - moves left and right only points in the
00:57 - direction left my early
00:58 - okay so backgrounds let's add a
01:01 - background from the library we can
01:03 - choose blue sky now what me is that
01:07 - can't scroll it's a background
01:08 - backgrounds don't scroll and you can't
01:10 - get away from that before age me the
01:11 - stage so let's create a new sprite and
01:16 - we're going to call this background okay
01:21 - and this is not gonna rotate at all good
01:25 - and we're gonna take a nice background
01:28 - at me out there and I'm gonna drag it
01:29 - into my sprite okay and now I'm going to
01:33 - change my actual stage background to
01:35 - white so we could see there's this white
01:37 - area behind and now we can move our
01:41 - background and like before so that's the
01:44 - basis let's get rid of this empty
01:46 - costume so it just got a nice costume of
01:48 - blue sky okay I got add some scripts in
01:52 - here first off let's go into the player
01:56 - supply because this is the way this is
01:57 - where everything happens this is where
01:58 - things kick off so I'll have a green
02:00 - flag inside there I am going to add a
02:04 - variable called scroll X you'll see that
02:08 - a lot in scrolling projects we could
02:10 - call it camera X but we like scroll and
02:12 - it's going to be for all spy
02:13 - so they all can see that and we're going
02:16 - to set that to zero at the very
02:17 - beginning so that's where we start
02:19 - scrolling from will keep that ever now
02:21 - now we want to have some broadcasts in
02:26 - my projects I very rarely have more than
02:28 - one green flag clicked I like to keep
02:31 - things in control of my own control so I
02:34 - don't like them running in all different
02:37 - sprites you never know quite how
02:38 - projects start up so let's keep it
02:40 - simple by having one and then
02:42 - broadcasting from there so we are in
02:44 - control so in a broadcast setup so
02:49 - everything that were wants to happen can
02:50 - be set up in that broadcast and it won't
02:54 - continue running until that's finished
02:56 - because I've got broadcasting wait and
02:58 - then we're gonna do some more sitting up
03:00 - not more setting up so I start getting
03:03 - some loops running so let's start a
03:04 - broadcast without this this is not a
03:06 - wait broadcast this is a normal
03:08 - broadcast and I'm gonna call this player
03:13 - okay and a receiver for that in this
03:19 - place right there it is that's ready and
03:22 - I'm gonna have another broadcast in here
03:27 - called loop this all come clear later
03:35 - and another one called background loop
03:43 - and finally one more I'm going to call
03:48 - other loops okay this is my foundation
03:52 - for starting loops of code off in the
03:55 - right order this is the order I want
03:57 - them to run in so the moment there's
03:59 - nothing receiving these broadcasts but
04:00 - that's fine
04:01 - we got to do that later so in the
04:04 - background let's have a receiver for the
04:07 - background loop well that's convenient
04:09 - that's what I want so the background
04:11 - loop no it's not what I want I'm like
04:14 - sorry and I wanted was a setup okay so
04:17 - at the very beginning we're gonna set up
04:18 - where our background is so for that for
04:22 - now I'm going to stick it as I go to
04:24 - zero zero
04:26 - okay sis click that yeah nicely
04:29 - positioned right to where it should be
04:32 - I also want to make sure that the cat is
04:34 - in front of the background let's click
04:37 - on the cat and we'll stick where's the
04:40 - go to front
04:41 - let's hit they go to actually no you
04:43 - ever do that do you yes you do okay go
04:46 - to front there he is good I was missing
04:49 - mr. cat right what next
04:53 - so let's get the cat so that he falls
04:56 - down on to the floor so where this had
04:58 - some stuff into the player scripts now
05:02 - let's have a forever loop within our
05:03 - player loop receiver and in we will have
05:08 - a motion and we'll change our Y position
05:13 - by minus eight that will just make him
05:16 - loop straight down towards the floor if
05:18 - I run that in fact so much so he falls
05:20 - to it which is fine let's put let's put
05:25 - two go to zero zero above there so we
05:27 - can press it again of an it okay there
05:29 - he goes falling down no gradual
05:33 - gravitation stuff in this project - no
05:35 - nice smooth moving I'm just gonna make
05:37 - him fall down at the constant speed just
05:40 - for simplicity right so we won't stop
05:42 - him on the ground
05:43 - so let's but if after reason being moved
05:46 - down we will check to see whether he's
05:47 - touching the ground or not in this case
05:50 - I'm using color sensing so if he's
05:53 - touching brown then I will move him back
05:56 - up again simple as that so now he should
06:00 - just stop on the ground yeah beautiful
06:02 - okay and now we need a little bit of
06:04 - movement to move left and right
06:05 - otherwise we're not gonna be able to
06:07 - scroll very much are we that's but an if
06:09 - in here if sensing if the key is pressed
06:15 - and it's the right arrow then we want to
06:20 - change our position and again I'm gonna
06:23 - choose eight that's enough I press the
06:25 - right arrow let's run the project first
06:27 - my dome there we go he moves
06:31 - however he just moved off the screen and
06:33 - that's not quite what we got achieving
06:35 - at the end so what we need to do next
06:38 - so the secret of scrolling is you don't
06:41 - want the cat to look like he's moving
06:42 - along the level you want the level to
06:44 - look like it's moving behind the cat so
06:46 - what we need to do here is get when the
06:48 - cat moves to the right you want the like
06:50 - the camera to move to the right - so the
06:52 - whole it looks like the whole thing is
06:54 - moving to the left so what we need to do
06:57 - is change that scroll X so if we go into
07:03 - the background we want this to be moving
07:05 - now when the cat moves so let's get our
07:08 - new event to receiver and this is the
07:11 - background loop like we had before which
07:13 - is great we have a forever loop okay now
07:18 - we've got a scroll X that's great so
07:21 - we're going to reposition this
07:24 - background set the x position of the
07:27 - background to be nice it might look a
07:30 - bit complicated it's not it's good it's
07:32 - easy it will get used to it
07:33 - 0 - scroll X that means is the negative
07:38 - version of scroll X so scroll X changes
07:40 - by 10 our background will move to the
07:42 - left by 10 okay
07:45 - you can test that if I run the project I
07:48 - should now be able to put a set scroll
07:51 - to a value like 10 click that and it
07:56 - should maybe I see that move back to the
07:58 - left to verify if we get change change
08:01 - by 10 maybe time I click that it'll
08:05 - scroll the background to the left
08:07 - beautiful okay so in my scratch cat now
08:14 - I'm gonna add another receiver this
08:18 - receiver is the camera loop so we're
08:23 - broadcasting that there so after this
08:26 - player loop has run through and we've
08:28 - moved our cat I'm now going to move the
08:31 - background so that both the cat and the
08:34 - background will move to meet where the
08:37 - cats moved to to try and keep the cat in
08:39 - the middle of the screen so what we were
08:43 - to do is look for the cat having moved
08:45 - to the right so if we go into motion
08:49 - and we look for expedition there we go
08:51 - say if the exposition of the cat is
08:54 - greater than zero so he's moved to the
08:56 - right we're going to do its change the
09:02 - scroll X by eight and this is important
09:10 - we need to move the cat to the left by
09:13 - eight so it's in line with the scrolling
09:17 - so it's closed the camera moves the
09:19 - light cat therefore moves to the left so
09:22 - if we run that now and move to the right
09:26 - nothing happens
09:28 - ah see my mistake there I'm very sorry
09:32 - look at this so I've got a camera loop
09:33 - and there's no loop in there they stick
09:36 - a forever loop around that let's try it
09:39 - again
09:39 - okay moved to the right there we go so
09:42 - now when I moved to the right level
09:45 - moved to the left and I stay stationary
09:47 - this is quite cool in fact if you play
09:51 - around with this you'll see it's
09:51 - actually quite flexible so if I change
09:53 - the scroll to - and - - and run that
09:55 - again if I move to the right level
09:58 - slowly Scrolls to meet me so you can do
10:02 - some quite cunning effects here but for
10:04 - now let's keep them in the middle let's
10:05 - move in the same amount eight and that
10:09 - keeps him nice and in line with the
10:11 - scrolling and now you see the next
10:14 - problem if you scroll the level across
10:16 - you end up with a big gap you need more
10:18 - level so let's add some more level in
10:21 - okay for this I am going to change my
10:24 - background so what I need is a new
10:26 - variable called level X and this has to
10:32 - be for this right only it's very
10:33 - important because each each screen of
10:37 - the level has to have its own position
10:39 - so let's add that in there get rid of
10:42 - the on the screen and start my setting
10:45 - level X to zero this is in a set up a
10:48 - stage not the running stage setup so
10:52 - what we do is use some clones here so
10:54 - we're going to set the level to zero
10:55 - we're going to load in ourselves create
10:59 - clone of myself
11:01 - then I'm gonna change X by 480 that's a
11:08 - full screen width right and now down
11:14 - here where we've got the receiver rather
11:17 - than being positioned zero we're going
11:19 - to put our level X into there and I run
11:22 - that and now you see this we have two
11:26 - screens we own that again first green
11:31 - second screen that was easy wasn't it
11:34 - and of course what you can do in here
11:36 - then is create some different parts of
11:38 - the level so I'll duplicate the costume
11:40 - and I'll add a little bit of something
11:42 - else slightly different to this one are
11:45 - adding a bit of it's in the first sprite
11:50 - let's add in a bit of platform here like
11:52 - this and in the second one I'll add in
12:00 - that I'll add in a fluffy cloud
12:16 - okay like that okay good now if you go
12:21 - in here so when you were cloning our
12:23 - background what I need to do is change
12:25 - the costumes so if I set the costume to
12:28 - begin with to be our first costume blue
12:32 - sky and then I just put a next costume
12:35 - after the clone so now we run that now
12:39 - I'm stuck in the middle let's change the
12:40 - opposition of our little count here so
12:42 - rather than being zero zero let's put
12:44 - him up a bit higher a hundred higher
12:48 - there we go so he's on this fall's down
12:51 - that's awfully loud excellent so what if
12:56 - I want even more screens well of course
12:58 - that's really easy now you can see in
12:59 - here all we need to do
13:00 - it's duplicate up from the clone like
13:04 - that and that will keep going through to
13:07 - the next costume each time so cloud and
13:10 - then we'll go back to this first one
13:11 - again okay you could loop that around
13:14 - and create lots and lots of those okay
13:17 - so maybe what that'd be worthwhile is
13:21 - putting in another movement so we can
13:23 - move left as well so let's just
13:24 - duplicate up the move right and change
13:28 - it so this is now a left and that moves
13:32 - him by minus eight on that thing so I
13:36 - can move left I can move right move left
13:39 - and it doesn't scroll back now this is a
13:41 - common feature in lots of games like
13:43 - Super Mario and things you you can keep
13:45 - progressing but you can't move Mac and
13:48 - that's a design decision you can choose
13:49 - whether your game wants to be like that
13:50 - or not it actually is very easy to do
13:53 - both both types of scrolling if we
13:56 - wanted it to scroll back and forward we
13:59 - can change this scrolling here to allow
14:01 - for different directions for example so
14:05 - I could put what's the best way of doing
14:07 - this let me have a quick think no let's
14:09 - not do that so what we can do if you
14:17 - want it to scroll exactly the same so
14:19 - let's stop the program let's change
14:21 - scroll X by position X
14:27 - and set exposition to zero now that if I
14:31 - run that well now keep it in line but I
14:35 - can get back as well yeah that's pretty
14:41 - well so depending what you want so this
14:45 - now if he can't moves to the right
14:47 - it changes the scroll though by how much
14:49 - is moved by or again to the left it
14:51 - changed it by how far he's moved to the
14:53 - left and then it puts me back in the
14:54 - middle so that's the alternative way of
14:56 - doing it but I'll take that out because
14:58 - I was trying to write her a game that
15:01 - scrolled with my cat to the right but
15:05 - not to the left okay now next thing to
15:08 - notice is how sprites don't move off the
15:12 - screen very nicely if I add a new sprite
15:16 - here now I'm going to call this Apple
15:22 - and I'm gonna add a costume from the
15:25 - library let's try and find an Apple I
15:28 - think it's there we go
15:29 - good old Apple there we go there we go
15:36 - okay now objects in games after scroll
15:40 - of course with the background so we need
15:42 - to with my cat gone why is he
15:46 - disappeared behind I need to bring him
15:49 - back to the front looks there he is
15:53 - Apple different there we go right so
15:57 - this Apple needs to move with the
15:58 - background just like the background
15:59 - moved with the scroll X so let's put in
16:03 - some scripts now I've already got the
16:05 - receivers ready so we've got in it I'm
16:08 - not in it so I setup I call it this time
16:09 - sometimes it's called the init to
16:10 - initialize but we're calling a setup
16:12 - this is where we need to position the
16:14 - Apple and again we gonna have to have a
16:16 - special Apple X for this sprite only
16:21 - okay set Apple x2 and the position I
16:24 - want them to be let's put him at let's
16:28 - put its life further off screen so we
16:30 - can scroll along to find him that's put
16:32 - it at 300 and
16:37 - to set his Y position to be zero it's
16:46 - fine right in the middle of the screen
16:48 - vertically and then we need to our event
16:51 - receiver for the other loops right good
16:57 - all other things other than the
16:59 - background and the player will go under
17:01 - other loop that's why I mean deciding
17:03 - anyhow so forever loop in there well
17:05 - when you do is position him for now so
17:07 - it's the same as the background so let
17:11 - me just copy that in into the Apple I'm
17:16 - instead of level X it needs to be a Plex
17:19 - I right click there to do that but this
17:22 - colics is the same say now if I run that
17:25 - there is the Apple in our level but look
17:30 - see how he stays on the side of the
17:32 - screen on the left or on the right and I
17:36 - haven't reached him yet that is the
17:38 - problem with scrolling games in scratch
17:39 - scratch does not allow objects sprites
17:42 - to go off the screen not completely they
17:44 - always stay on by between well it's 12
17:47 - pixels off the screen I believe but
17:49 - because they have wide borders sometimes
17:52 - they can be this is the outline of the
17:54 - Apple they can actually stick out even
17:55 - more so I tend to add a border around
17:58 - each scrolling project of about 16
18:01 - pixels to hide these things that are
18:04 - often meant to be off screen but aren't
18:05 - off screen so let's add in another
18:08 - sprite called border like so doesn't
18:14 - have to rotate and all we need to do to
18:18 - initialize it it is ad in the setup and
18:25 - position it at 0 0 and it has to be at
18:32 - the front go to front costume now we
18:38 - want to draw this nice and neat so if we
18:40 - zoom in and we want to in bitmap mode
18:44 - makes easier now scroll the screen to
18:46 - the bottom left now you see his little
18:49 - scrolling a bit more
18:51 - zoom in a bit more if I scroll to the
18:53 - bottom your notice that this
18:56 - checkerboard pattern is quite a useful
18:58 - thing if I click on block and black and
19:02 - filled so each one these blocks is four
19:05 - pixels so to be 16 pixels we need it to
19:08 - be four of them so we need to draw a
19:10 - block that is covering four of these
19:13 - okay like that so it's perfectly sized
19:17 - before hi so if we zoom out
19:19 - click on the select tool select that
19:25 - square a bit of it and then drag it out
19:28 - sideways that means we have a perfectly
19:30 - sized for pics or 16 pixel high now we
19:35 - can zoom in and do the same for the
19:40 - vertical so draw a cube that's 4 cross
19:45 - so zoom out select drag up like that
19:56 - zoom in to the top left draw if you can
20:06 - 4 pixels it actually looks like I could
20:11 - drag that out maybe if i zoom out now
20:13 - before I go yes this is easier I'll do
20:17 - that yes better zoom in scroll to the
20:20 - left let's go to the bottom draw your 4
20:27 - like that zoom out
20:29 - I'm trying it up excellence there
20:31 - perfect if I would not now okay you can
20:35 - now see Apple is not visible it's behind
20:38 - that black like scroll across there he
20:40 - is and if I go across further to the
20:43 - left can't see him perfect there you go
20:47 - see
20:50 - and you can add movement scripts and
20:52 - things into Apple so I've got this other
20:55 - loops here running which is setting his
20:56 - position to the where he's scrolling to
20:58 - but you can actually add more loops in a
21:02 - like type of a say for example in here
21:05 - and this is the reason I'm using these
21:07 - loops in this way is I can put in a
21:10 - repeat say 20 and I can make him move
21:17 - change Y by 3 and then repeat 20 change
21:26 - Y by minus 3 for example and run that
21:31 - and if I come across there you go and
21:37 - now if you want him to move sideways
21:39 - you'll be careful
21:40 - because you do not want to use change X
21:42 - because the apples exposition is no
21:44 - longer defined by his scratches
21:48 - exposition you have to use your data
21:50 - variable Apple X so if I wanted him to
21:53 - move sideways let's do another loop that
21:56 - makes him move sideways so this time
22:00 - I'll make him do this very quickly here
22:03 - so maybe let's do it even more so for
22:07 - just loops of four I'm gonna change
22:10 - Apple X by eight and I'm the other one
22:16 - I'm gonna change it but I'm minus eight
22:17 - now run that that's going to find him
22:22 - yeah see I have to use the Apple X
22:25 - because as you scroll his position
22:27 - changes so it needs to be controlled by
22:30 - his Apple X which we set at the top
22:32 - there cool and that's pretty much it I
22:41 - hope that was useful I'm gonna expand on
22:44 - this and add lots more things to it do
22:46 - comment love the video and tell me what
22:49 - you think there's so much more to cover
22:52 - but that will do for now I think thanks
22:55 - for watching
