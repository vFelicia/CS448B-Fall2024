00:02 - hello fellow scratchers
00:04 - and boom what is Geometry Dash without
00:07 - an epic end of game explosion I'm Griff
00:11 - batch and in this fourth episode of our
00:13 - series we'll be recreating this effect
00:15 - just as you see it here and guys it
00:18 - looks awesome doesn't it sit tight and
00:20 - I'll show you exactly how it's made now
00:23 - these videos do take me a lot of time to
00:26 - put together so I'm trying something a
00:28 - little different in an effort to get new
00:30 - videos out weekly I'm going to try to
00:32 - keep my episodes short and on topic if
00:35 - you like this idea then please take a
00:36 - moment to drop me a like and I'll also
00:38 - watch out for your comments under the
00:40 - video so without further Ado we'll get
00:43 - right to it open your projects from
00:45 - episode 3 and as always we're going to
00:47 - save them as a fresh due copy for this
00:50 - is episode four guys let's get
00:54 - scratching
00:55 - and I can hardly believe this but the
00:58 - first thing to note about modern
01:00 - Geometry Dash is that when the player
01:02 - dies the level instantly grinds to a
01:04 - halt what and to think that we spent all
01:07 - that effort to bring it to a nice
01:09 - gradual stop oh well it was a fun lesson
01:13 - learned but let's take it out in the
01:16 - player Sprite now scroll down to the
01:18 - when I receive game over script then
01:21 - right before the repeat Loop simply set
01:23 - scroll speed to zero yes a complete stop
01:28 - and then pull out that change scroll
01:30 - speed from the loop so that it no longer
01:33 - applies
01:34 - now is that all we need to change let's
01:36 - take a look
01:37 - ah so dying to spikes ah that looked a
01:41 - little odd the player appears to jump to
01:43 - the right and I did expect that because
01:46 - scrolling up to the game on scripts we
01:49 - have this little change X block here or
01:52 - when we touch a spike now this needs to
01:54 - go so carefully remove it but keep those
01:57 - other two broadcast and stop blocks
01:59 - below
02:00 - here we go smash that green flag and now
02:04 - we have a much tidier instance stop I'm
02:08 - testing on a wall Collision here it
02:10 - comes yep that too is working fine
02:13 - Splendid then we can move on to creating
02:16 - the first part of the explosion effect
02:18 - the expanding Circle
02:22 - we'll Begin by creating a new Sprite
02:25 - naming it explode
02:29 - the color of this circle is going to be
02:32 - the same cyan blue we used in the
02:34 - particle Sprite and we get the color
02:37 - using the selection tool and simply
02:39 - selecting the particle shape there we go
02:42 - now moving back into our new Sprite The
02:45 - Fill color is retained so we'll draw a
02:47 - circle don't forget to hold down the
02:49 - shift key to keep it perfectly circular
02:52 - and we're aiming for a size of 100 by
02:55 - 100 pixels a little adjusting and there
03:00 - we go
03:01 - lastly snap the shape to the center of
03:03 - the canvas and we are good to get coding
03:06 - when green flag clicked we'll do some
03:10 - setup initially we'll hide the explosion
03:14 - gone the next time it shows is when we
03:17 - receive the game over message
03:20 - so bring that in
03:22 - and immediately show the Sprite again
03:27 - now obviously this should be positioned
03:30 - over the player go to player
03:36 - nice but a bit too large for starters so
03:39 - set size two
03:42 - twenty percent that's the setup now for
03:46 - the animation
03:48 - repeat and ten times
03:51 - and we're going to change size by to
03:53 - make it grow and leaving it at 10 for
03:56 - now
03:56 - then we'll click the game over script to
04:00 - test it
04:01 - okay nice I'm liking this but let's make
04:04 - it grow for longer up the repeat to 15
04:08 - frames
04:10 - cool but as the circle expands we want
04:13 - it to fade away too we do that with a
04:17 - change ghost effect and for full Fade
04:20 - Out that's 100 over 15 frames that
04:24 - should be 100 divided by 15 roughly
04:26 - seven each time
04:28 - smash that game over script and that
04:31 - looked good let's see it again
04:33 - oh purple scratch cats did we break it
04:37 - no no we just forgot to reset the ghost
04:40 - effect to make it visible again the
04:42 - second time around drop in a simple
04:44 - clear graphic effects and yes we are
04:47 - back in business now this short is cool
04:50 - but I have one more enhancement to make
04:52 - the circle currently expands at a
04:55 - constant linear rate but it would look
04:58 - even better if instead its expansion
05:01 - slowed down over time this is called
05:04 - easing out
05:06 - so rather than changing size by 10 each
05:09 - frame we calculate the easing figure
05:11 - using a subtract block starting with a
05:14 - hundred and seventy percent that's the
05:16 - maximum size we are aiming to expand our
05:19 - Circle to from this we subtract the
05:22 - current size of the explosion Sprite
05:24 - that gives us the amount left we need to
05:27 - increase by that's nothing if we've
05:29 - already reached our Target size
05:31 - and now we divide
05:34 - dividing the amount left to increase by
05:36 - by nine
05:38 - now the larger this number is the longer
05:41 - it will take for the shape to reach its
05:43 - final size
05:44 - right exciting hit that game over script
05:48 - oh yeah that's what I'm talking about
05:51 - the new easing out gives it that
05:53 - professional touch right
05:55 - now just before we move on I think it
05:57 - best to drop in a hide block at the end
05:59 - I just feel better knowing that the
06:01 - Sprite is not hanging around on screen
06:03 - even if it is ghosted to nothing
06:06 - great time to see this fully in game
06:09 - smash that green flag
06:11 - perfect that's just as I hoped it's
06:14 - looking better and better except my OCD
06:18 - simply cannot take this anymore does
06:20 - anyone else notice that oh so tiny but
06:23 - highly annoying step down in the level
06:25 - as the player moves from Level costume
06:27 - number one to costume two ah man I hate
06:30 - it and it does seem strange because the
06:33 - ground is an exact duplicate between
06:35 - costumes one and two they should line up
06:37 - perfectly well not to worry if you want
06:40 - to fix it you can just drop in another
06:42 - rectangle at the top of our levels again
06:44 - out of sight and that alone is enough to
06:46 - fix my first screen crazy and you may
06:50 - need to add them to more than one just
06:52 - see how you go phew now I can move on
06:56 - the next stage of our explosion is to
06:59 - add in those particles the particle
07:01 - burst now this is what really brings the
07:04 - whole animation together particles begin
07:06 - at the center of the player and then
07:08 - spread outwards in a circle
07:11 - now we already added the particle Sprite
07:13 - and that was used to create the trail
07:15 - behind the player however we won't try
07:17 - to reuse it instead right click or long
07:20 - press on mobile and duplicate the
07:23 - particles Sprite
07:25 - this time we'll name it explode
07:27 - particles or perhaps particle burst if
07:30 - you prefer
07:31 - okay the costume can stay exactly the
07:34 - same click into the coding tab
07:37 - so unlike the particle Trail a particle
07:40 - burst must generate many clones all at
07:43 - once the trigger is once again from a
07:46 - game over event when I receive game over
07:49 - we want to create say 40 clones
07:51 - therefore repeat for 40. and create
07:55 - clone of myself
07:58 - the problem is this repeat Loop doesn't
08:00 - run instantly but will stagger the
08:02 - animation over 40 game frames to make it
08:06 - instant we need to make a new custom
08:08 - block
08:10 - boom and tick the run without screen
08:13 - refresh checkbox this will do the trick
08:17 - now all 40 clones will be created
08:19 - without waiting around excellent just
08:22 - drop the boom block under the game over
08:24 - receiver
08:26 - okay next up we want to code the
08:28 - particle's motion when I start as a
08:31 - clone now although the original particle
08:34 - scripts follow a similar pattern we'd be
08:36 - better to move them off and cherry pick
08:38 - the blocks we need
08:40 - the go to player that stays the same
08:43 - but we don't want to offset the position
08:45 - with the change X or Y blocks
08:48 - set size yeah we need that but up the
08:52 - picked sizes between 75 and 150 this
08:56 - time
08:57 - ah speed X and speed y so okay I'm going
09:01 - to switch to use a direction and speed
09:03 - this time around so drop in a point in
09:07 - Direction block and we'll pick a
09:09 - direction between negative 180 and 180.
09:12 - that's a full circle around the player
09:14 - and will help to form a circle of
09:16 - projectiles
09:18 - and now to set the speed
09:20 - so this should just read set speed not
09:23 - set speed X we can rename the variable
09:25 - speed X to Simply speed
09:30 - and then the speed y that can be deleted
09:34 - great bring that particle Sprite to the
09:37 - front go to front
09:40 - and reattach the remaining scripts the
09:43 - show repeat and delete blocks but we're
09:46 - going to pull out the movement scripts
09:47 - from the repeat these still assume a
09:49 - change X and Y approach to the movement
09:52 - instead our costume is already facing in
09:54 - the direction they want to move so all
09:56 - we need to do is move forwards by this
09:59 - particle's speed
10:01 - and then yeah we're going to fade them
10:03 - out using the change ghost block
10:06 - just a few more changes we'll up the
10:08 - repeat to 20 so that the particle burst
10:10 - lasts for a longer time and reduce the
10:13 - ghost effect down to four
10:15 - wow that was a lot of fiddling around I
10:19 - hope we will be suitably rewarded when
10:20 - we run these scripts to do so we're
10:23 - going to click on the when I receive
10:25 - game over hap lock just here
10:27 - and that is quite a cute little
10:30 - explosion but I can see a few issues
10:33 - firstly it's not half as big as I wanted
10:35 - and secondly the particle cubes are all
10:38 - rotated in the direction of travel we
10:41 - don't want this they should stay upright
10:43 - at all times and we can quickly fix that
10:46 - by clicking into the direction input and
10:48 - hitting the don't rotate option that's
10:51 - the third one across
10:53 - good that solves that one now for the
10:57 - power the speed we need to up the
10:59 - particle's initial speed let's try form
11:02 - three all the way up to 12. they should
11:05 - be quite fast
11:06 - click oh yes now that's more like it
11:10 - this particle burst is looking so much
11:12 - better for those small tweaks I've got
11:15 - to see this in game smash that green
11:17 - bunting
11:18 - oh marvelous it looks even better
11:21 - combined with the central circle too
11:23 - this is partly because of how the
11:25 - particles outpace the circle as the
11:27 - circle slows down with that easing we
11:30 - added now you might think we are done
11:33 - there and it's very close but I just
11:35 - have a couple of finishing touches to
11:37 - make firstly I'd like some particles to
11:40 - disappear faster than others so before
11:42 - the repeat Loop change ghost by a pick
11:45 - random
11:47 - between 0 and 30. that gives some
11:51 - particles a head start in fading away
11:54 - and then also we can make the particles
11:57 - shrink in size as they fade
12:00 - change size by negative three
12:04 - and now let's see this in action
12:07 - yeah it's coming along
12:10 - but the biggie is this in real Geometry
12:13 - Dash when particles overlap they change
12:17 - their color to become more white I love
12:19 - that and it's not so easy to replicate
12:22 - in scratch Faithfully but we can emulate
12:26 - it just a tat by setting the brightness
12:28 - effect before the repeat Loop to 100
12:32 - that's as bright as we can make it so
12:36 - now our particles appear white instead
12:39 - of blue
12:41 - and then we quickly fade back to Blue
12:44 - using a change brightness effect by
12:47 - negative 20. drop that into our repeat
12:50 - Loop
12:52 - except there is a problem with that the
12:54 - brightness quickly goes too far the
12:57 - other way and makes our particles black
12:59 - oh great
13:01 - no problem though we'll handle the
13:03 - brightness in our own script when I
13:06 - start as clone again
13:10 - repeat
13:11 - but only this time for five frames
13:15 - and in there we change the brightness by
13:18 - negative 20. and run the project
13:23 - great that fixed it getting too dark but
13:26 - the white effect is so quick I can
13:28 - hardly see it how about we hold it at
13:31 - White for a few extra frames we can do
13:34 - that with a weight before the repeat for
13:36 - three frames that's calculated as three
13:39 - thirtieths of a second that's 0.1
13:43 - seconds and that's it our particle
13:46 - explosion is complete and I'm really
13:48 - very happy with that all we need to do
13:51 - is Fade Out the player for the final
13:53 - effect so in the player Sprite
13:56 - scroll down to the game overscript and
13:59 - no surprises here change ghost effect by
14:04 - and we want this to be very quick so
14:06 - enter a value of 20.
14:09 - here goes nothing
14:11 - and wow all our hard work has paid off I
14:15 - don't think it could get a lot better
14:16 - looking than this what do you think did
14:18 - we miss anything let me know in the
14:21 - comments let's try a wall Collision
14:23 - oh boy that's really good and it sets us
14:27 - up nicely for the next episode where
14:29 - we're gonna ditch having to click that
14:31 - green flag to start the game so noob
14:33 - finally having the option to restart the
14:36 - level in game I'm looking forward to
14:38 - that and hey if you have a request for
14:40 - what we cover next then drop it in the
14:43 - comments under the video do remember to
14:45 - submit your projects to the official
14:46 - scratch Studio you'll find that linked
14:48 - under the video too and oh while you're
14:51 - still here please smash the like button
14:53 - and so is not to miss my next exciting
14:55 - video ensure you are subscribed to my
