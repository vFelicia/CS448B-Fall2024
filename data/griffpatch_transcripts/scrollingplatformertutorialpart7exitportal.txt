00:00 - hi thrift patch and welcome back to the
00:03 - next part of my tutorial on how to make
00:06 - a scrolling platformer in scratch today
00:08 - we're gonna be looking at adding in the
00:10 - exit this is the exciting little port at
00:13 - the end of the game where once you've
00:15 - clicked all the collectables it opens up
00:17 - and you jump into it and it whizzes off
00:19 - and it goes on to the next level we're
00:22 - going to see how far that we can do
00:24 - today so where we left off from last
00:28 - week we're now running in scratch 3 we
00:31 - were looking at the death problem that
00:34 - we had and we fix that so now we need to
00:36 - do is add in the end so when we click
00:39 - these they have a little portal at the
00:41 - end let's see so what we can do and we
00:45 - just make this little screen smaller so
00:47 - we have a bit more space okay so let's
00:50 - begin
00:51 - what we need to do is actually add in an
00:53 - exit first so what we're going to do for
00:56 - that is we're going to clone the
00:58 - collectibles sprite while duplicate
01:01 - sorry not clone duplicate right click
01:02 - and duplicate ok and we're gonna call
01:06 - this exit like so it's a little bit
01:11 - different from scratch too so you'll get
01:12 - used to this idea of how are you rename
01:14 - things and things but that's how you did
01:15 - it in the box ok so what have we got to
01:20 - do now first of all I guess we've got to
01:22 - draw the portal so that's going to
01:23 - costumes we're going to do it very
01:25 - similar to how we drew the collectables
01:27 - so what we actually can do probably is
01:31 - just select that and make it bigger if
01:34 - you hold down alt just so you know the
01:36 - Alt key and drag the corner it resizes
01:39 - from the middle rather than from the
01:41 - edge which is quite useful so we can
01:43 - resize it the size we want and I'll make
01:46 - the middle big again it can hold down
01:47 - alt while dragging the corner so
01:52 - something like that and let's change the
01:56 - colors so the outside glow let's go to
02:00 - the drop down the colors here and we're
02:03 - on radial fill already the circular one
02:05 - we want to swap around these two colors
02:08 - we want the transparent to be on the
02:10 - outside like
02:12 - and we on the inside to be around 50
02:17 - which is right and then 44 saturation
02:20 - drag that down to about 40 yeah and then
02:25 - brightness let's put that right down to
02:28 - 40 so it's just a dull glow at around
02:32 - the edge that's good
02:34 - click onto the middle part and this one
02:37 - is click again on there we want it to be
02:42 - actually no we don't want to raid your
02:45 - fill those we want a solid fill do that
02:46 - this is a closed portal and we want the
02:50 - outline to be one color and the inside
02:54 - to be black so let's just make that out
02:56 - fill black first click on outline and
03:00 - we'll make this the same color as the
03:01 - glow which is color 50 this saturation
03:06 - 40 and the brightness of 40 like that
03:12 - okay maybe make our outline a little bit
03:17 - thicker as well let's make that into
03:19 - four try that so you mean yeah there we
03:23 - are look at our line of four good so
03:26 - that's a closed portal now we need an
03:29 - open portal so if we duplicate this
03:32 - costume that now for the open one what
03:36 - we want to do is change the color of the
03:38 - inside and let's change it to fill and
03:41 - we'll have a linear gradient field which
03:44 - is this one here and the left side we're
03:47 - going to set to again 50 it's the color
03:53 - we like so kind of blue color saturation
03:56 - of 40 and dryness 100 nice and bright
04:02 - like a sky and the bottom color of the
04:05 - fill we want to be white which is
04:07 - brightness 100 and saturation zero
04:12 - that's it that blue to white they're
04:16 - beautiful portal like that very much
04:20 - okay so that's our little portal drawn
04:21 - let's give these costumes names
04:23 - we'll call the open one open and we'll
04:27 - call the closed one closed there we go
04:31 - nice and simple right so what do we do
04:35 - now now we want to be able to position
04:37 - that portal on our level now this is
04:39 - going to be done just the same as we did
04:41 - our little collectibles back in goodness
04:44 - knows which part of our tutorial seems
04:45 - so long ago now but to do that it's this
04:49 - bit of script inside the exit which we
04:51 - have duplicated from the collectibles so
04:54 - it's position so we want to position our
04:55 - portal him and we've still got our
04:58 - little clever m'kay key which hopefully
05:01 - you remember we're just going to tell us
05:03 - where to put something so everyone the
05:05 - project okay we'll go all the way to the
05:09 - end and we want to put our portal just
05:12 - here floating at the end of the level so
05:15 - put the mouse where you want it to be
05:16 - and press m and hopefully everything is
05:19 - still working our little script will
05:21 - have shown where we want to place this
05:23 - so type these numbers into the first
05:26 - clone at so 944 by 22 okay
05:33 - that's in there now we do not want any
05:36 - of these other clones because we want
05:37 - one portal so that will pop that there
05:42 - so we should better give it a little
05:44 - quick check for you run it there we go
05:51 - portal is there closed great right
05:55 - what's our next step let's hide that
05:58 - mouse there because we don't want that
05:59 - anymore so go into availables
06:01 - and get rid of that Mouse good okay so
06:07 - we've reached in the level and the
06:08 - portal is shut we need this to open when
06:10 - we've collected all the collectables but
06:13 - to know whether we've collected them all
06:14 - we need to know how many there were to
06:16 - begin with so we need to have a record
06:17 - of that add it to the game so if we
06:20 - click into the collectibles sprite and
06:22 - we'll add a new variable for all sprites
06:26 - so we'll type this in capital letters
06:28 - again so we know we're going to call it
06:31 - collected max okay so this is the
06:36 - maximum number that you can collect
06:38 - click OK okay now the beginning that's
06:41 - zero but we'll we'll set it to zero as
06:44 - well we'll do it just here under the set
06:47 - collected and we'll set collected max to
06:51 - zero as well okay and now in here we're
06:56 - going to be cloning our new collectibles
06:58 - so if we keep track of every time we
07:00 - clone one by putting a change into here
07:04 - like this change collected max by one so
07:10 - if we were not now collected max it's
07:14 - five and amount collected zero so as we
07:17 - go through the level collective goes up
07:20 - letting max stay the same of course and
07:22 - now collected max and collected at the
07:25 - same so at this point we want this
07:27 - portal to open that stopped the scripts
07:30 - now where are we going to put this this
07:33 - bit of script we're gonna add to the
07:37 - code where here we go in the when
07:40 - received tick this is where we are
07:43 - checking to see if the collectibles
07:45 - touching the player and we're changing
07:46 - the amount of collected by one so in
07:50 - here we can add an if statement just
07:52 - underneath the change collected make
07:56 - sure that deletes underneath if not
07:58 - inside it and we need to compare using
08:00 - an equals operator that collected
08:06 - variable so I is equal to collected max
08:13 - so at the point that you've collected
08:16 - all of the collectibles then we can do
08:19 - something and we'll use an event or
08:21 - broadcast in here like that and we'll
08:25 - book us a new message and they say this
08:28 - is going to be open port or like so okay
08:36 - and that we can receive in the portal
08:40 - sprite so go into the portal sprite and
08:42 - we'll add in the new receiver
08:44 - down here which is going to be open
08:48 - portal and in here we need to switch the
08:51 - costume looks switch costume - guess
08:56 - what open okay so that should open the
09:00 - portal to Reve they go it's quite an
09:02 - exciting change so here I am testing the
09:05 - level collecting all the collectables
09:07 - and I miss this one right the portal is
09:09 - closed and I'm collecting this little
09:12 - collectible it opened the a that's great
09:15 - and now what we need to do is make the
09:17 - script for when we go into the portal
09:19 - that the level will end at present I can
09:22 - collect it because it's just a duplicate
09:24 - of the collectible sprites which is
09:26 - obviously not right so stop this and
09:30 - let's go and fix that so in the exit
09:32 - sprite let's find the bit where we can
09:35 - collect it here we go so in the tick
09:38 - receiver we've got if touching player
09:40 - and then change collected by one and
09:42 - delete the portal which is not what we
09:44 - want so get to that so this is where the
09:46 - scripts are going to go now one
09:48 - important difference here so we don't
09:51 - want this touching to work if the portal
09:53 - is closed so we need to put an operator
09:57 - and we put an end in here now let's
10:00 - replace the touching here with that and
10:02 - put the touching into the second part of
10:04 - the end now on the left side we need to
10:06 - check that the costume if we go down in
10:09 - the looks we'll find a costume here and
10:13 - we need back to the operators we in
10:15 - equals so costume number equals now we
10:23 - can either do costume number equals two
10:24 - because if you're looking in costumes
10:26 - its costume number two is that open one
10:28 - or we can use the name open which is a
10:31 - new scratch to things so we can change
10:33 - the name and put open in there so up to
10:37 - you which you do their costume name or
10:39 - costume number we'll try a name because
10:42 - that makes it a little bit more clear
10:43 - what's going on in the scripts mono
10:45 - number two and when that happens what do
10:48 - we need to do well it's the moment we
10:50 - need to set available exit just like we
10:53 - do when we die
10:55 - but we're going to set it to rather Ming
10:58 - die we're gonna set it to win and at the
11:02 - moment in our scripts that probably
11:03 - won't do anything different to how we
11:04 - die because I think we set it up so that
11:06 - it would anything happens and without ex
11:09 - available it just kills us but let's try
11:12 - it anyway okay let's test this if I rush
11:14 - through this level I'm gonna not collect
11:16 - them all and miss one so that we have a
11:18 - closed portal and I jump through it and
11:20 - I don't go through perfect it was closed
11:23 - if I went through and this time I
11:25 - collect them all and then jump in I die
11:28 - which is exactly what I want because the
11:30 - the moment when I said any thing in the
11:34 - exit available our player sprite or kill
11:38 - us which is what we set here we go when
11:41 - X is anything other than zero blank
11:43 - sorry we died so we need to change this
11:47 - now so that we can do more than just die
11:49 - at the end so let's change this a little
11:52 - bit down here let's add in if-else
12:01 - condition around this die can I even get
12:06 - in my place no I cannot
12:08 - nevermind let's move that out pop that
12:10 - in there like that
12:12 - there we go so what we're gonna do is
12:15 - put the die in the second part of the if
12:18 - in the else part and this condition here
12:21 - is going to check to see whether we've
12:22 - won so put an equals operator in there
12:27 - find the exit available in one side and
12:33 - put win in the right hand side okay so
12:38 - when we finish the game because the
12:40 - exits been set we then check if exit is
12:42 - win and we'll do this and if it's not
12:44 - win we assume we're gonna die now let's
12:46 - create a new custom block for when we
12:49 - win so it's call this game win and we
12:57 - won't run without screen refresh leave
12:58 - that unchecked and drag in your new game
13:04 - win into this side okay so when we exit
13:08 - and when we go into win otherwise
13:09 - to die let's move our game win over here
13:13 - where we can script up a nice new bit of
13:16 - code there we go
13:20 - this is quite an exciting bit and as you
13:22 - saw in the demo at the beginning of this
13:25 - tutorial I had this little animation
13:27 - where the player would we surround the
13:29 - exit and go into it now that's quite a
13:31 - nice little feature so let's have a go
13:33 - implementing that so what we're gonna
13:35 - add in here is a repeat loop for 50
13:39 - frames of animation that's how long it's
13:42 - going to take us to get into the middle
13:44 - of the portal and then we add in a point
13:50 - towards I'm going to point towards the
13:55 - exit like that then we shall turn our
14:01 - player by 65 degrees okay so what this
14:08 - is doing is we point a little character
14:10 - towards the middle so he's facing
14:11 - towards it so if you move forward here
14:13 - to be straight towards the exit but then
14:15 - we turn him away from the exit by 65
14:18 - degrees which moves us into kind of this
14:21 - direction and what that means is that
14:23 - we're actually moving kind of around the
14:25 - exit so let's do that and we want to
14:29 - move forwards and now this is a bit more
14:33 - interesting too because as you're on the
14:34 - outside of the portal you move fast as
14:36 - you go in
14:37 - you move slower as you're going in so
14:39 - what we need to do is have an operator
14:41 - put a divide in there and then you want
14:45 - sin which one is it
14:47 - sensing yep distance to and put distance
14:52 - to portal exit sign in there and divide
14:56 - it by two so we're moving forward by
14:59 - half the distance that we're away from
15:01 - the portal and then other things we want
15:05 - to do is change our player size so it
15:07 - looks like we're going into the portal
15:08 - so go to looks again change size by and
15:13 - we'll put minus 1 in there to get
15:16 - smaller by a little bit each time and
15:18 - we'll also make them fade out as he goes
15:20 - into it
15:21 - say we want to change it's not gummy
15:25 - color we want it to be ghost to make him
15:27 - getting more and more invisible and
15:29 - we'll do that like - so that should do a
15:34 - little animation of us whizzing round
15:35 - and round the portal and at the end of
15:38 - this we are going to change level by one
15:47 - to get us onto the next level and add
15:50 - one more thing which is a weight of one
15:54 - second at the end one more thing
15:56 - sorry we also need to hide hide
16:03 - ourselves after we've done I repeat
16:06 - before we do any weight waiting so
16:09 - should we give this a go and see what
16:10 - happens okay so let's get what's the
16:19 - portal jump in nope that most certainly
16:23 - did not work so you can see even I have
16:28 - bugs in my code so the reason for that I
16:30 - already know is that in our exit scripts
16:34 - if we look at our clone at here
16:38 - when we when we are setting up our level
16:43 - we clone a new portal at this position
16:48 - that we wanted to add but the problem is
16:50 - if we're using clones then our scripts
16:53 - in our player which was trying to rotate
16:55 - around the portal don't work because
16:57 - they're looking at the position of the
16:59 - main sprite for the port the exit not a
17:04 - clone so we want to get rid of this to
17:06 - create clone because we don't actually
17:08 - need clones for the portal we just want
17:10 - to use a normal sprite and position it
17:12 - also what we need to do is remove this
17:15 - set X at the bottom of the setup because
17:20 - now we're not using clones so we want
17:22 - our position to be exactly what we set
17:24 - in here
17:25 - that's one nut again well hold on I'm
17:28 - tiny and upside down that's not quite
17:32 - what I was after
17:34 - let's stop that and fix that too now the
17:37 - reason that's happened is I we are
17:38 - little animation did start to run and
17:40 - it's changed us but we haven't got any
17:42 - scripts in the player sprite to make
17:44 - ourselves the right size at the
17:46 - beginning of the game so let's go
17:48 - through to the game on where it shows us
17:50 - and let's set our size to be a hundred
17:54 - percent here we go so set size to 100
17:58 - there
17:58 - I will also upside down which shouldn't
18:01 - be happening so let's have a look at
18:02 - fixing that what you want to do go into
18:06 - the player direction click on that and
18:10 - let's change it not to be rotating but
18:13 - to be flipping after my instead and that
18:15 - also keep us the right way up so that
18:17 - should be right ok let's have another go
18:21 - run that okay we're back to normal let's
18:25 - collect all of the collectables and jump
18:30 - in yay far better and we are now on
18:36 - level 2 level 2 doesn't look very good
18:40 - does it
18:40 - so we got some work to do there so let's
18:45 - just come back the editor and just for
18:47 - starters let's just add in a little bit
18:49 - of level 2 so we can see that it works
18:51 - so to do that lets go into costumes on
18:55 - platforms and for now let's duplicate
18:59 - our level 1 like so put it at the end
19:03 - and we'll call it level space 2 space 1
19:09 - so it's level 2 and the first part of it
19:12 - and let's just make it a little bit
19:14 - different so we can tell I'll just make
19:18 - it slightly rounded like that what we
19:21 - also need to do is go into the exit code
19:24 - to avoid having this portal appear in
19:26 - the middle of the level let's just add
19:29 - in a clone portal let's just clone it to
19:33 - the right of the level so that would be
19:35 - about 240 I think now click on the
19:39 - platform sprite okay now what we need to
19:42 - do is add in a level 2 script in the
19:45 - up so just duplicate the if inside the
19:51 - else part I'm going to have a check for
19:53 - level two in here or set level to be
19:57 - level two one get rid of that we don't
20:01 - even need the clone part so it's just
20:05 - setting the costume two to one because
20:07 - that all position in our first part of
20:09 - our level at that position and the same
20:13 - needs to be done in danger of course
20:15 - so duplicate the if into the else check
20:22 - for level two and we're going to set the
20:26 - costume but we haven't got us for a
20:28 - costume for that yet so let's just
20:30 - create a new one blank costume called
20:35 - level two one now we'll set that in here
20:42 - as well good let's give that a whirl
20:58 - now we're getting somewhere so the only
21:01 - thing left is our little character is
21:03 - completely invisible you must be there
21:06 - I can move so why is he not it's because
21:10 - when we added our player fading out we
21:14 - faded him - nothing using ghost but we
21:17 - never set him back so that he was
21:19 - visible so show won't do it you need to
21:21 - set ghosts to zero in there so on game
21:29 - on setting his size setting his ghost to
21:32 - zero and we're showing him and I think
21:35 - that will fixed everything and we'll be
21:38 - in a much better place there we go
21:45 - level - very good give yourself a pat on
21:49 - the back if you got this far that was a
21:51 - little bit of a hairy episode I think so
21:53 - thank you for watching I hope you'll
21:56 - come back next time bye now
