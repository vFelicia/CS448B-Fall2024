00:00 - [Music]
00:02 - hello fellow scratchers man I love this
00:05 - scratch raycaster series and I'm very
00:07 - excited to be coming back to add
00:09 - something new if you haven't yet
00:11 - followed along then now is a great time
00:13 - to start episode 1 and 2 are dead simple
00:16 - seriously fun and wow I can hardly
00:19 - believe the progress we've made since
00:21 - then which brings us back to today and
00:24 - we're going jumping mad adding the
00:27 - ability to jump over Nano and generally
00:30 - jump all around the level because it's
00:32 - far too much fun how cool is this So
00:36 - currently we only store a player X and Y
00:39 - position on the map now we're going to
00:42 - need to add the player's vertical
00:43 - position too player Zed and in episode 8
00:47 - we already covered panning of the scene
00:49 - up and down but jumping is a little
00:51 - different as the Parallax effect
00:54 - requires further away elements to pan
00:56 - slower than those close oh wow look at
01:00 - all the tiny enemies spread around a
01:02 - level that is so fun and so if you've
01:06 - already caught up with episode 9 shout
01:08 - I'm ready in the comments and if not
01:11 - then not to worry you'll soon catch up
01:13 - because without further Ado we'll save
01:16 - our projects as a new copy for this is
01:19 - episode 10 guys let's get
01:25 - scratching okay so before we lay down
01:28 - any new code to make testing easier I
01:30 - want to temporarily disable the mouse
01:33 - controls don't worry we'll put them back
01:35 - at the end in the player Sprite scroll
01:38 - down to the Define player tick script
01:42 - this is where all the player movement
01:44 - happens I'm going to separate off all
01:46 - the mouse control code that's everything
01:48 - down to and including the first turn by
01:51 - degrees
01:53 - block and to make things clear let's
01:55 - wrap that in a custom block naming it
01:58 - Mouse controls
02:00 - and run without screen
02:03 - refresh so we can attach the new Define
02:06 - hat block to those Mouse scripts and
02:09 - then we'll make use of the mouse
02:11 - controls block right away however we are
02:14 - temporarily disabling the mouse controls
02:16 - aren't we so bring in an if else and
02:20 - drop the new Block in the first then
02:23 - Branch cool bring back the rest of the
02:26 - scripts from below popping them in on
02:28 - the end of R if the else block simply
02:32 - wants to set camera y to zero to ensure
02:37 - that we're looking straight
02:39 - ahead note that an empty if condition
02:42 - will always run the else Branch so our
02:45 - Mouse controls are now disabled I'm just
02:48 - going to move that Mouse controls
02:49 - definition into some free space down
02:52 - here excellent give that a quick run to
02:55 - confirm it works here come the Nanos yes
02:59 - I can wave my mouse around and it no
03:01 - longer rotates The View instead I am
03:03 - forced to use the keyboard also I don't
03:07 - really want the cursor to follow my
03:09 - mouse either so to fix that we can pop a
03:12 - set pointer lock into the else Branch
03:15 - too setting it to
03:17 - one and now the pointer becomes locked
03:20 - to the middle of the screen and we are
03:22 - running 100% mouse
03:25 - free I would also like to disable the
03:29 - enemy movement as they can often get in
03:31 - the way far too quickly when we're
03:33 - testing so click into the entity Sprite
03:36 - and scroll down to where the when I
03:39 - Stars clone script is and this is the
03:42 - simplest change just separate off the
03:45 - move custom block and do leave it nearby
03:48 - so that we can restore it later on ha
03:51 - these enemies are out of luck but that
03:54 - is much better for
03:56 - testing well then let's have some fun
03:59 - fun click into the pen Sprite this is
04:02 - where all the 3D drawing gets done
04:05 - specifically in the Define draw row
04:09 - block and now we are going to add player
04:13 - verticality you can see this is where we
04:16 - calculate the height of each vertical
04:18 - slice of wall based on its distance from
04:20 - the player and here is where we work out
04:24 - the top y position to begin drawing the
04:26 - wall downwards this is what we'll need
04:29 - to tweak
04:30 - but first we'll need to make a new
04:32 - variable player Zed to keep track of
04:36 - that vertical position making it for all
04:39 - Sprites and for fun switch the variable
04:41 - reporter to be a slider by right
04:44 - clicking it or with a long press on
04:46 - mobile so as I now slide this upwards I
04:49 - want the player to appear to rise up off
04:51 - the floor the effect of this is that the
04:53 - level should move
04:56 - downwards if you can remember way back
04:58 - to gosh like episode two of this series
05:01 - is it then this 1.5 represents how tall
05:05 - above eye level each wall
05:08 - starts so to shift this wall downwards
05:11 - by player Zed we'll use a subtract block
05:15 - subtracting our player Zed from the same
05:18 - 1.5 value now we don't need to worry
05:21 - about further away things moving slower
05:23 - as this is already accounted for in the
05:26 - height
05:28 - variable but we do need to compensate
05:30 - for it being multiplied by 10 so we
05:33 - divide player Zed by 10
05:38 - first finally we can drop that in place
05:41 - of the existing
05:42 - 1.5 oh that line is getting a bit long
05:45 - for my liking but I'm going to let it
05:47 - slip this once because it is testing
05:49 - time so slap that green
05:52 - flag oh man yes see how easily the level
05:56 - now drops away below us I'm really
05:58 - loving that it's just too much fun
06:00 - trying this out all over our level but
06:04 - we do have to do something about these
06:06 - enemies the same vertical positioning
06:08 - should be being applied to them too what
06:12 - we will need is to duplicate this math
06:14 - script up to where we're multiplying by
06:17 - height and then moving over to our
06:20 - Define Stamp entity script this is where
06:23 - we yeah stamp our entities on the screen
06:27 - but enemies don't have a vertical Zed
06:29 - position specifically so we're going to
06:32 - replace this 1.5 or a zero to represent
06:35 - that position and then simply drop the
06:38 - script into the goto XY on the left
06:40 - there placing the blank value super easy
06:44 - right well smash that green
06:48 - flag oh yes did you see that I am liking
06:53 - what I saw the entities are now behaving
06:55 - exactly as we'd hoped keeping their feet
06:58 - firmly on the ground ground as I raise
07:00 - the player up and down he hey like this
07:03 - it makes me feel really
07:05 - tall however as fun as it is to look
07:09 - down on our level from above the
07:11 - rendering of the level from above will
07:13 - never look quite right as our raycaster
07:16 - is optimized to not draw any walls
07:18 - behind the First wall each Ray
07:22 - encounters as well as this we have a
07:24 - virtual ceiling in place and we are not
07:26 - supposed to be able to burst through it
07:29 - if you come up close to a wall and
07:31 - adjust the player Zed value you should
07:33 - find this looks fine up until around 13
07:37 - or 14 but any higher and the illusion is
07:41 - lost so we'll have to remember that as
07:44 - we scrap the player Zed slider and code
07:46 - up some actual player jumping scripts 13
07:49 - or 14 is the max so click with me into
07:52 - the player
07:54 - Sprite and yes we still want the player
07:57 - tick script only scroll right down to
08:00 - its bottom now we're looking out for
08:03 - when the player presses the space key if
08:07 - key space is
08:10 - pressed but we only want to jump when we
08:12 - are touching the floor so another if
08:16 - checking when player Zed is equal to
08:20 - Simply zero that will be the
08:22 - floor okay now we need some vertical
08:25 - momentum to jump up with make a new
08:28 - variable
08:30 - player speed Zed or player SZ for short
08:35 - for all
08:37 - Sprites now when we successfully jump we
08:40 - set player speed Z
08:43 - to not too much let's try
08:47 - two then to move the player up by this
08:50 - speed
08:51 - change player
08:54 - Zed by the player speed Zed SZ except we
09:00 - need to remember all our movements are
09:02 - scaled by our Delta value to allow for
09:05 - slow frame rates so change player Zed by
09:09 - player speed Zed multiplied by
09:12 - Delta next we account for Gravity change
09:16 - player
09:18 - speedz
09:20 - by netive
09:23 - 0.2 again we need to multiply that by
09:27 - Delta all that's left is to prevent the
09:30 - player falling through the floor if
09:33 - player Zed is less
09:36 - than less than zero then they Fallen too
09:40 - far so simply set player Zed back to
09:43 - zero but also let's reset the player
09:46 - vertical speed set player speed Zed back
09:50 - to zero
09:52 - also and are you ready for this run the
09:55 - game and press space Bo
10:00 - Bo oh man that's awesome and if you look
10:03 - our height is not going much above 10 so
10:06 - we are well within our acceptable
10:08 - parameters testing next to a
10:10 - wall in front of Nano they must think we
10:14 - are looking most odd hey I wonder if we
10:17 - can oh yes I know exactly what we are
10:21 - going to work on next jumping over
10:24 - enemies of course we'll need to account
10:26 - for the fact that some enemies are
10:28 - taller than other
10:30 - Frank so we are in the player Sprite and
10:35 - ah here is where we detect that the
10:37 - player is touching an
10:39 - entity and for reference we are still in
10:42 - the Define player tick script yes it's
10:45 - all happening in here today now the
10:47 - problem is touching entity doesn't tell
10:49 - us what type of entity we touched be
10:51 - that a nano or a much larger Frank so
10:55 - that's not going to work here we need to
10:57 - pull out the if to touching entity
10:59 - script and make sure to reattach the
11:02 - other script from
11:04 - below right we're going to move this
11:06 - touching script into the entity Sprite
11:10 - instead so before we do click first into
11:12 - the entity Sprite and yes this is
11:15 - actually where we're going to do the
11:16 - work in the when I start as a clone
11:19 - forever Loop we'll make a new custom
11:22 - block named hurt player and we'll run
11:26 - without screen refresh now drop the new
11:29 - block into the forever Loop so it runs
11:31 - each game
11:32 - frame and now we need those touching
11:34 - scripts from the player Sprite click
11:37 - back into the player and drag them right
11:39 - into the entity
11:42 - Sprite right they should have appeared
11:44 - somewhere nearby so attach them to the
11:46 - Define Hur player hat block but careful
11:50 - notice how we are looking for touching
11:53 - entities this is no longer correct we
11:56 - are now wanting to know if the entities
11:58 - are touching the player so make sure to
12:01 - switch that around a wonderful benefit
12:04 - of detecting cisions this way around is
12:07 - that each enemy can now control if and
12:10 - how much damage they inflict on the
12:12 - player we just need to code it up right
12:14 - here but for now let's just confirm this
12:17 - is working as
12:19 - expected yep touching Nano is a constant
12:22 - Health drain however it's not super
12:25 - obvious that we are taking damage is it
12:27 - really often first person games will
12:29 - flash a color on the screen to indicate
12:31 - damage has been
12:33 - inflicted so we're going to add a
12:35 - broadcast whenever the player is hurt
12:38 - broadcasting a new
12:39 - message player
12:43 - hurt the pen rendering is all done in
12:46 - the pen Sprite so clicking there now and
12:48 - we're going to create a new costume for
12:50 - this and zooming right out of the canvas
12:53 - draw a huge rectangle over the entire
12:56 - painting area snapping it to the center
12:58 - enter if you can now I don't want an
13:01 - outline but the fill that is important
13:04 - we'll switch to a radial gradient fill
13:08 - and the center that's the left hand
13:10 - color swatch click that and make it
13:14 - transparent then the right hand Swatch
13:17 - we want a deep red around a brightness
13:19 - of 60 or so now if we can make that
13:22 - visible on stage you can get a picture
13:24 - of what we are looking at perhaps set
13:26 - the size to 100 and the X and Y position
13:30 - to 0 0 there we go that should work
13:36 - great shall we code it up find some
13:39 - space and we'll trigger off a when I
13:43 - receive for the player hurt
13:47 - event okay so we're going to switch to
13:50 - the new hurt
13:52 - costume and then we'll make sure the
13:55 - size is set to 100
13:59 - also a clear Graphics effect would be a
14:02 - good idea to reset any brightness or
14:04 - ghosting effects then position the
14:07 - Sprite in the center of the screen with
14:08 - a goto XY 0 0 and finally from the pen
14:14 - category we stamp our hurt costume on
14:17 - the stage Splendid are you ready to see
14:21 - this in action we're approaching a
14:24 - dangerous
14:26 - Nano and there it is our red overlay is
14:29 - working perfectly down goes our health
14:32 - and we are well aware of that because we
14:34 - can see the red colored border around
14:36 - the screen
14:38 - cool and now we are all set up to add
14:42 - the most awesome of scratch Sports Nano
14:45 - Leap Frog right now no matter what we do
14:48 - we continue to cide with this little guy
14:51 - but not for long look here still in the
14:55 - pen Sprite you can see that the costume
14:58 - one is the Nano and we no longer want to
15:00 - collide if the player's Zed value is
15:03 - greater than their height now costume 2
15:07 - is a Frank and they are simply Too Tall
15:09 - jumping will still result in the player
15:11 - getting
15:13 - hurt okay then click back into the
15:15 - entity
15:17 - Sprite before we check for touching the
15:19 - player we'll drop in a new if
15:23 - check and we need an
15:26 - and so we can check if typ is equal
15:31 - to one for that is a
15:34 - nano and if player Zed is greater
15:40 - than around three then we are jumping
15:43 - over their head well if we are jumping
15:46 - then we won't be able to cide with any
15:48 - Nanos so we can stop this script and not
15:52 - bother to check for collisions with this
15:55 - entity wow that was quite easy
15:59 - question is does it work smash that
16:02 - green flag I'm testing walking
16:04 - collisions first and yep that works as
16:07 - before now with a run up jump and I
16:10 - didn't see a Flash and no not a single
16:13 - Health Point was lost that is great
16:15 - let's do it again whoops I think I just
16:19 - caught them there come on Hur up yeah
16:24 - got it hey you know we could easily add
16:27 - a score counter and track how many Nanos
16:30 - we jumped over and that would be too fun
16:34 - hold on let me just find a
16:36 - Frank uh Frank Where Are You Frank aha
16:41 - okay jump ouch yes as hoped jumping has
16:46 - no effect on reducing Collision pain
16:49 - from touching a
16:51 - Frank nice one so we are almost there
16:55 - before I finish though let's restore the
16:57 - enemy movement in the entity Sprite
17:01 - place the move script back into the when
17:03 - I started clone forever Loop before we
17:06 - detect the player
17:08 - collisions and in the player
17:10 - Sprite oh we can get rid of that old
17:13 - touching player script and then if you
17:16 - want to we can restore Mouse control by
17:19 - finding the Define player tick script
17:22 - and simply drop a not block into this if
17:25 - condition you could of course opt to
17:27 - switch this mode on or off in any way
17:30 - you feel best let's give that a quick
17:32 - test yeah there's the mouse ouch
17:35 - something is already attacking me but
17:37 - tell you what let's hide those excess
17:39 - variable reporters player Zed and speed
17:42 - Zed and that my friends is what you'd
17:45 - call a wrap and isn't this game looking
17:51 - fantastic I do hope you've enjoyed
17:54 - re-engaging with this series if so then
