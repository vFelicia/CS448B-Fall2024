00:03 - okay I have enabled my audio can anybody
00:07 - hear me
00:15 - anybody getting my audio stream working
00:17 - I'm kind of looking it says my stream is
00:20 - healthy he's after that pause that you
00:27 - can hear me anybody hear me
00:32 - hello hello hello great I'm assuming
00:40 - that art is working I am going to have a
00:43 - go at playing my game once more and this
00:48 - time with some audio and so hopefully
00:51 - you'll hear that now I'm going to try
00:53 - not go mad because my word this game
00:57 - really for straights
01:00 - okay let's talk it through a little bit
01:03 - so here we go so I got the start the
01:06 - game down pretty well but it depends
01:08 - where I managed to catch my hammer this
01:11 - bit it's all a bit of luck really where
01:14 - I have all lands okay that was quite
01:17 - good and that is very nicely if I get
01:20 - there in 16 seconds I'm very happy
01:22 - usually this game is so slippy mines bit
01:26 - better and oh man well there you go
01:30 - all saved but it's not gonna be a good
01:33 - time for that okay let's do it again
01:37 - nope no oh my goodness
01:40 - come on come on come on come on get in
01:42 - there I've managed to fix little bug
01:45 - that was happening around here which was
01:50 - that you would get stuck in the ground
01:51 - and slowly rise up ah I had originally
01:56 - fixed it for the hammer but not for the
01:58 - player I discovered so that was why that
02:00 - was happening that's very nice that's
02:02 - fixed now this bit talking and playing
02:06 - at the same time reducing go together
02:08 - but no this is the bit
02:13 - because you have to get it have to get
02:18 - it just in the right place now Oh groove
02:20 - it's a bit annoying as it comes in the
02:23 - wrong place
02:23 - white get it and I have attended Cetus
02:27 - yeah yeah okay going well I thought
02:32 - talking at the same time was not gonna
02:34 - be a good idea right let's try it again
02:39 - [Music]
03:00 - it's getting worse and worse okay we're
03:16 - off bookshelves okay now so little flick
03:18 - across here and then you can start PO go
03:21 - back and forward between the different
03:23 - objects on the screen no no no okay try
03:33 - again much better
03:38 - no boy getting stuck on dogs ears and
03:42 - this time
04:11 - little slips now little slips what hold
04:17 - a moment speedrunning is just too
04:24 - difficult I'll tell you one my habits
04:26 - need to be gripping on the side of the
04:27 - bus now
04:31 - this is not going very smoothly
04:53 - come on scratch cat - do not fail me now
04:57 - you're like flipping around all over the
04:59 - place know how that guy had got under
05:06 - two minutes now on this game managed it
05:09 - I would love to see a video of that
05:12 - happening it must have been literally
05:16 - perfect nothing alike what I am just
05:21 - doing for you here
05:22 - absolutely killing the game but you know
05:28 - you can't be the best at your own game
05:30 - sad as it is I think I do enjoy creating
05:34 - them more than I enjoy playing them
05:36 - although I have to said I do enjoy
05:39 - playing this game there's a really good
05:41 - jump and I love that that is one of my
05:44 - least favorite bits except for the bat
05:47 - which almost falling back to this bit
05:55 - it's just so dependent what is dependent
06:03 - upon catching that hammer the right
06:05 - place it's just luck now those who've
06:11 - seen me climbing here before know this
06:12 - is problematic I'm not working out where
06:19 - the top was not bad
06:21 - three life we've got such a bad time of
06:24 - it here 5 minutes 25 Oh see that's like
06:27 - the best
06:28 - we've run in a space I've probably ever
06:29 - had if only I could tack that onto the
06:35 - end of a really good start
06:37 - run I'd actually be there for a chance
06:39 - of getting a good time ok let's give it
06:43 - another go now before I do just to let
06:47 - you know those who are interested in
06:48 - doing speedruns I've just added a
06:50 - feature to the start this game which is
06:52 - if you press Q and R at the same time it
06:55 - resets this game at the time keeping the
06:59 - same sound settings which means if you
07:02 - ask be drilling it
07:04 - and water quickly reset you can it's
07:07 - kind of like quit and reset event on cue
07:09 - in our oh and if I were speedrunning
07:17 - that is what I would be okay I'm gonna
07:20 - do it you said go
07:35 - now 14 seconds to this point that is
07:38 - like the best generally when I start
07:43 - missing up so far so good
07:48 - no but there's so much potential to give
07:52 - off yeah this is I shouldn't look at the
07:57 - time if I look at the time did I stop
08:00 - panic I'm actually doing well okay
08:14 - no no no don't oh cool now pull on it
08:22 - now because it comes up you didn't
08:23 - pretty well okay keep this going yeah
08:28 - yeah yeah
08:40 - no no no no no no no no yeah hmm oh you
08:49 - do not watch having there let's go nope
08:53 - let's not go go do you like landing a
09:01 - good start oh my goodness
09:06 - 12 seconds
09:34 - No
09:53 - oh goodness come on no no no no no no no
09:57 - no no no
10:09 - oh right clique of death oh it was going
10:17 - so well it was going so well
10:25 - no oh come on speed runs go
10:43 - I spent so long building this ah
10:48 - building this level out of scratch cause
10:51 - costumes I have to look my way through
10:56 - the library first thinking what
10:58 - categories of objects I could use and
11:04 - what shapes of objects are in the
11:07 - categories because I have to be able to
11:08 - build a level out of them and the
11:10 - problem with lots of lots of the
11:13 - costumes man lost pom with lots these
11:18 - costumes is that they were very bitty I
11:21 - needed shapes that were quite solid
11:23 - because otherwise you get caught in them
11:26 - so I went to the really blocky colorful
11:29 - objects the level I put together in
11:35 - adobe illustrator because it let me
11:40 - break the level up into many screens and
11:45 - then export them all back into scratch
11:48 - again a screen at a time which was very
11:53 - handy to try and make the level look as
11:55 - much as the original shape of the
11:58 - original games is based on as possible
12:05 - it's made of around 160 full screens and
12:11 - to begin with I was exporting them as
12:14 - the standard oh stop talking soon
12:20 - because starting to do relatively okay
12:27 - maybe it's a trick maybe I should talk
12:29 - while blank so they were the usual okay
12:37 - I'm gonna stop talking here because this
12:38 - is a bat
12:45 - yes now go to class little bit come on
12:48 - yes okay concentrate now no mister
12:58 - mister okay Christmas tree
13:14 - oh my goodness Oh No Oh
13:22 - sausages sausages design this game tell
13:33 - you so the usual levels are made up of
13:42 - 480 by 360 pixels bitmap mode but it
13:49 - does support double resolution so to
13:52 - begin to begin with the levels all in
14:05 - the normal scratch resolution I would
14:09 - have been nice if I could have exported
14:10 - them as vector but as it come on it's
14:16 - just it's not talk for a second let's
14:20 - get at this tree oh I just got no power
14:27 - left in my am yeah ugh about ah funny
14:38 - thing is I've never made it to space in
14:40 - the real game fact I Honey you made it
14:42 - anywhere in the real game that little
14:45 - chimney bit is probably the hot tub or
14:47 - where this I forgot
14:49 - so trying to implement a space scene I
14:53 - was really working blind because there
14:55 - wasn't hardly any YouTube videos of
14:57 - anybody getting into space except for
14:59 - when they complete the game and they're
15:00 - really good at it so they all go flying
15:02 - through space and do the games I have no
15:05 - idea where the takos should go in space
15:07 - not little those tacos in the real game
15:09 - and I had no idea where they are
15:11 - I had no idea how much gravity there was
15:13 - I could just see that there were being
15:14 - sucked towards the planet for tacos so I
15:17 - did my best with that so I don't know
15:19 - whether it's actually anything near
15:21 - accurate or not but nobody's complained
15:24 - and really frustrating so it probably
15:27 - the power line
15:29 - yes so I was saying my export at all
15:31 - these levels screen at a time at
15:36 - originally the normal
15:37 - there's 640 by 480 no 485 360 size but
15:44 - then I changed and managed to explore
15:48 - them a double resolution and that's what
15:51 - they are at the moment which actually
15:52 - looks a lot nicer and scratch was quite
15:54 - happy for me to exported like that
16:18 - Oh
16:32 - so the way I put the level together was
16:34 - I found a high-resolution map from the
16:39 - original game not both eye high enough
16:44 - that you could see the shape of
16:45 - everything anyway
16:47 - and then I was able to lay my level over
16:51 - the top of that and put the scratch
16:54 - costumes which I exported from scratch
16:56 - and I'd pop them into illustrator and
17:00 - then I started 200 then I started to
17:05 - remodel things a little bit so like all
17:07 - these rocks example there's only two
17:09 - rocks in the scratch library and so I
17:15 - had to change their color a little bit
17:20 - variety I also used the puppet warp tool
17:23 - and various other tools illustrator
17:25 - gives to bend them into roughly the
17:29 - shape that fit the level some things I
17:34 - had to walk more than others just to be
17:35 - able oh my goodness oh what a save no
17:45 - okay my changes back I really hated that
17:49 - maybe the unfair she'll be a bucket here
17:53 - in a real game with some pretty awesome
17:56 - physics going on but what I didn't want
17:59 - to do wasn't make it lag and the amount
18:05 - of cost you sensing I'm doing this game
18:07 - is quite huge
18:27 - well that's the end of my my speedrun
18:30 - yeah the bass sensing I doing this game
18:32 - is quite a lot so what I'm actually
18:34 - doing at the moment as I moved the head
18:37 - of the hammer and the player and I work
18:43 - out how much velocity I have to move
18:46 - each one for each frame and I move it
18:52 - through every pixel but it's moving
18:55 - between the two points every frame so
18:59 - it's doing a lot of sensing what it
19:04 - means that that yeah yeah it means that
19:09 - the hammer does not go through things
19:11 - and nor does your body well I say go
19:14 - through things I mean it doesn't go
19:16 - through I'm gonna restart this this is
19:18 - it's not going well
19:42 - Oh like yourself that when it goes right
19:49 - it's such a nice feeling but the readers
19:52 - not last long because just doesn't go
19:54 - right through long enough
20:02 - no I'm just we're just going thank you
20:05 - yeah
20:16 - right up we go
20:31 - I really hope that the guys who get the
20:35 - fastest scores on this game will be able
20:37 - to screen record them because it's so
20:40 - satisfying seeing I'm actually going to
20:42 - run where you're not messing up all the
20:44 - time so it's screen casting this not my
20:52 - goodness the most exciting things you
20:56 - guys cuz there's no way that saved by
21:18 - pixel Samoa
21:23 - have you noticed that even the sounds
21:26 - change when you scrape on something I
21:28 - think I guess that's really quite
21:30 - pleased if that works the physics in
21:35 - this are not model accurately at all I
21:39 - was wondering about going back and
21:41 - reworking it to use a more authentic
21:45 - physics system where I've modelled both
21:47 - the hammer and the player but that would
21:55 - have required a lot more work might not
21:58 - have worked and I would not have been a
22:01 - released a project so in the end I was
22:07 - doing which was just using general kind
22:09 - of scratch sensing and then that kind of
22:15 - the best guess approach which is often
22:18 - serves me well and I think is using a
22:20 - lot of games at least it used to be now
22:23 - that we have physics engines it's
22:24 - probably less than oh yeah it's it's try
22:29 - going this way oh I missed it I could
22:32 - have caught that it would have been good
22:34 - a good space maneuver as it is I'm just
22:38 - going to float
22:42 - hello off I go well three minutes 24
22:50 - wasn't too bad a time was it I really
22:56 - like to get maybe two two and a half
22:58 - minutes I reckon I could do it but it
23:01 - might take a lot of blood and sweat but
23:03 - why do then I keep at it it's not is
23:20 - that no I'm like just wobbling across
23:26 - the floor oh well let's go with it
23:37 - sometimes you certainly make up for a
23:42 - bad start some genius move later on
23:57 - Bosse you get across this really fast
24:01 - I've discovered it like we know if only
24:05 - I could
24:06 - hello these moves consistently
24:28 - I would not have believed it possible to
24:31 - get these at the Times the other day
24:34 - when I was releasing the project when I
24:37 - released the project my best time oh I
24:39 - shoulda grabbed my best time was 20
24:44 - minutes so I was rather shocked was
24:49 - first the first high school that came
24:51 - online I think was six minutes I thought
24:54 - yeah that's good and then some guys
24:58 - started playing it and I got I got three
25:00 - and then now two and it's just blown me
25:05 - away oh my goodness come on
25:35 - oh please
25:45 - no no no no no knows that come on grab
25:52 - it grab it please grab it
25:58 - you're the mercy of scratches bitmap
26:04 - pixel detection
26:17 - different boots normal could be good no
26:20 - not gonna be good if I can't reached it
26:23 - we said I go oh yeah yeah maybe it's a
26:29 - job
26:32 - oh my go into space at the edge of the
26:35 - level come back I put that on so that
26:41 - you couldn't go bounce by going
26:42 - downwards interesting fact they actually
26:48 - did use Oh
26:49 - oh man I used the same gravitational
26:53 - physics as I used for my atmospheric
26:57 - ball game where you could orbit all the
26:59 - planets so that was quite fun at that
27:01 - time where they would make you so that
27:03 - so quickly after releasing the first
27:04 - game atmosphere cool test project seemed
27:10 - it's 38 almost not the fastest but it's
27:15 - still pretty good I would have been very
27:17 - contented with that the other day
27:38 - no come on no series I love cherries by
27:43 - the way it's my favorite fruit
27:45 - I have a cherry tree in the garden nice
27:49 - black cherries it's quite young a few
27:51 - years old and very first year that we
27:55 - had it
27:56 - I have noticed a lovely red cherries on
27:59 - it and I went to bed one night woke up
28:03 - the next day and the birds had eaten
28:06 - every single sherry and I was very very
28:07 - sad the next year I put a big net on top
28:12 - of it the last few years because I've
28:28 - dangled two CDs from it instead my wires
28:33 - and they can work a treat strangely
28:36 - enough I don't think it's the content of
28:38 - the CD it's because they they rotate and
28:45 - so we're taking a song great
29:25 - she'd learn the names of all these bits
29:27 - I know this one's called a chimney oh I
29:34 - have to call it the watermelon now
30:03 - it's amazing what practice does for you
30:05 - slip Oh
30:07 - apart from that yeah
30:10 - practice these games over and over and
30:14 - do get
30:24 - well the letting go to the point where
30:28 - this particular game dry just so crazy
30:31 - there you just lose control of the
30:33 - things that you thought you could do we
30:35 - suddenly canting at all and what I was
30:44 - trying to I really wish I called of that
30:47 - because that was really good when I was
30:51 - earlier trying to record my games so
30:57 - that I'd better put them on YouTube
30:59 - not the screencasting but actually
31:01 - recording the pressure of having the
31:06 - record button pushed it was quite
31:09 - phenomenal and you do quite well without
31:13 - it playing but then as soon as the video
31:16 - means you're calling you do rubbish
31:30 - Oh
31:38 - I'm sure there's a smoother way of doing
31:40 - this that bit okay Oh sausages I was
31:53 - coming away then oh no no no no no yeah
32:07 - that's that's just unfortunate I'm
32:09 - afraid that's not a good not a good
32:12 - route so it's three spaces oh don't I
32:22 - how many of you guys actually got over
32:25 - it it's nice thing other do it but it
32:35 - would be nicer to do it a little bit
32:37 - more style than I have been managing
32:39 - here yeah are you guys watching how many
32:45 - are there Wow well it's nice of you what
32:49 - are you saying anything
32:50 - it's a look oh my life how am I meant to
32:53 - read that then right this is very sad I
32:59 - seem to be plummeting back to attack her
33:01 - somewhere below me no I am right
33:03 - that's at least in this game right I get
33:13 - this stage my QR key doesn't work that
33:18 - QR key is so new I haven't even updated
33:19 - the About section to say that you can do
33:24 - it it was a requested feature for people
33:26 - doing speedruns
33:43 - that was a beautiful scent
33:53 - oh and there we go no so good it's just
34:04 - so so nice up to that point when it goes
34:13 - wrong it really goes so those books then
34:20 - I use it the staircase they were just
34:22 - books though ah die cut from the scene
34:27 - of the witch's cottage
34:29 - she's one of scratches backgrounds one
34:32 - of the few which is actually a vector
34:34 - background most backgrounds in scratch
34:35 - of bitmap which are really hard to use
34:40 - for this game so there was a few things
34:43 - that were bitmaps which I converted to
34:45 - vector which is like a tracing feature
34:48 - the big book case which is
35:02 - to the left of the book staircase this
35:07 - was not saying most of the stuff I've
35:10 - got on the level varies
35:18 - cuz it looks so much nicer
35:54 - ah and there goes my chance of like
35:59 - record to me I was close that was really
36:03 - close this space space the one thing
36:24 - that is easier in my version of this
36:27 - game is the arm action with the hammer
36:31 - as you get closer in towards the body in
36:34 - the real official game it kind of does
36:37 - this little bit where switch is over and
36:39 - it can get stuck on a climb inside loop
36:41 - and an outside loop and I think in my
36:44 - version that's easier you can kind of
36:45 - pull the axe quickly across your body
36:47 - which I find very convenient but so I
36:53 - wasn't too bothered about trying to
36:55 - change it
37:00 - the I noticed that the guy in the pot in
37:04 - the real game also he leans towards
37:09 - where the Hammers going so when he when
37:12 - you move the hammer to the right he'll
37:13 - lean to the right of the pot which means
37:16 - he's kind of doesn't he doesn't need to
37:18 - stretch as far with his arms because
37:20 - he's leaning towards where the Hammers
37:22 - going where's my guy's arms look a
37:26 - little bit unnaturally long Oh but for
37:35 - the sake of having to try and simulate
37:40 - leaning I decided
37:54 - stuck
38:03 - all these little nooks here get in the
38:07 - way
38:07 - I'm pretty sure there's no little looks
38:09 - in the real game so you probably get
38:10 - caught a lot more in my game but that's
38:14 - not weird with our bigs Oh Oh big fall a
38:19 - big fall
38:21 - right - ah
38:34 - these scratch blocks here I
38:40 - screenshotted them from within scratch
38:43 - took them from the menu at the side I
38:46 - just used my browser to zoom in using
38:50 - the browser's native zooming I'm in a
38:53 - really big and then it's green shot at
38:56 - them and imported them in and they look
38:59 - pretty good
39:16 - Oh
39:21 - here we go again
39:28 - it's better
39:36 - over
39:41 - oh my goodness
39:47 - getting a bit stuck on everything now
39:56 - no no no like DejaVu be nice if there
40:03 - was a way of just launch get myself back
40:05 - up there
40:07 - of course they could because I'm Thor
40:09 - did you know that Micah Thor's hammer
40:12 - yeah it's true there might be a bit of
40:17 - debug in here that lets me fly it's
40:20 - quite fun if I was Thor how else you see
40:26 - would I get to the top of the level to
40:27 - test it out not what I would use such a
40:30 - thing Myron's lifecasting hat Oh in fact
40:35 - to get that record that will be very
40:37 - cheating
40:53 - Oh what do you guys all see in the
40:56 - Easter egg yet where you fall in the
40:58 - water and it makes your head grow bigger
41:00 - it was something that occurred in the
41:04 - real game when you watch youtube videos
41:07 - you can see there's clips of the Easter
41:10 - eggs and what one of them involved is
41:13 - it's actually it's all mesh kind of
41:15 - starts turning inside out and getting
41:16 - really big as you fall in the water a
41:19 - few times so I couldn't resist having
41:21 - something similar and because if I could
41:24 - do with his head getting big each other
41:26 - time seems to be hilarious to me quite
41:30 - sure it's quite a first it was then now
41:31 - but it might amuse you guys and some
41:36 - people have actually managed to complete
41:37 - the game with the big head so
41:39 - congratulations to you guys that's
41:42 - ridiculous
41:53 - [Music]
41:59 - strangely talking to you guys as I'm
42:03 - doing this I'm a lot less rayji I was
42:05 - playing it yesterday and to record my
42:08 - lives my video not my live stream and I
42:11 - just got so mad but being able to talk
42:15 - naturally as you play it actually feels
42:20 - more soothing
42:23 - not quite sure why maybe it's just ah
42:27 - takes the edge off it didn't know how it
42:32 - effects oh my playing because I suspect
42:36 - I'm not being able to tap here as much
42:39 - attention I mean like 40 seconds show I
42:45 - got in like 30 usually
42:56 - if you saw my huge YouTube video of my
42:59 - speedrun yesterday and he watched the
43:01 - really quite long outtakes
43:03 - you all saw this bit and I failed it so
43:09 - many times it was almost unbearable
43:12 - about jump but actually I found out a
43:17 - good tip so those at least for Windows
43:20 - users and the reason it was feeling so
43:23 - bad was actually on my mouse I had a
43:25 - wireless mouse and it had precision mode
43:29 - enabled on the windows options precision
43:40 - mode enabled which meant that the mouse
43:41 - accelerated away if you move it fast
43:45 - it's designed to like speed across the
43:47 - screen which is a really useful thing to
43:48 - have enable when you're working in apps
43:52 - and things on Amy's probably quite used
43:54 - to the feature but I believe that if you
43:57 - play any computer game that uses the
43:58 - mouse it would automatically disable
44:01 - that because the game would be in
44:03 - control of the mouse but miss game here
44:06 - in any scratch game we have no such
44:09 - luxury
44:10 - not games that run in web browsers don't
44:17 - have access to that but scratch doesn't
44:19 - make use of it so at the moment that's
44:23 - what they're saying
44:24 - yes mouse capture so our mouse in
44:29 - scratch could go out of the window and
44:31 - when it does you lose you lose control
44:37 - of the mouse in scratch which is really
44:42 - bad suddenly it's not registering
44:45 - anything and you die
44:47 - I've actually tried but some warnings
44:49 - into the game tell you what's happening
44:51 - you might have seen them pop up saying
44:53 - go fullscreen because when you're
44:56 - fullscreen in the least and windows I
44:59 - didn't max it's not the case but the
45:01 - windows it's you don't lose the mouse
45:06 - catcher so that game continues when the
45:08 - mouse is near the edge of the screen
45:31 - used to be suit no I'll keep going I
45:36 - used to be so careful I was about to say
45:38 - going across those to be honest not so
45:42 - careful everywhere but I was so careful
45:44 - going across those balls in the sky
45:47 - because I didn't think it was possible
45:51 - to go fast until I saw someone else's
45:54 - YouTube video playing it and then I
45:57 - appreciated that you could really pick
46:01 - it if you are able I think you've got to
46:06 - concentrate though oh right bat my young
46:09 - friend nice myst
46:22 - too fast too
46:27 - it was only the day I think the day
46:30 - before release of this project that I
46:35 - actually was able to add in slipping
46:41 - hammer up to that point the hammer was
46:46 - actually really grippy and once the
46:48 - hammer was in place that's crystal
46:51 - keeper seven can't tell you because he
46:52 - beat attested a little bit for me no1
46:54 - again ah the hammer was really grippy
46:59 - and it did mean it was actually a lot
47:02 - easier especially climbing this really
47:06 - annoying tree what we can do in space
47:08 - today no no I'm the big in this space
47:17 - right well I am definitely get it like
47:19 - at some point I'm just not quite there
47:22 - yet quite got the neck so how many times
47:26 - the other guys have gone to space we're
47:29 - really good at this
47:31 - are you lost my train of thought was I
47:37 - talking about
47:39 - we should get talked back to me and tell
47:42 - me what it was that I was talking about
47:53 - one game that I've never made a game of
47:56 - yet and you know I made lots of games of
48:00 - but the games that I enjoy is portal
48:05 - when people saw that portal cube that's
48:12 - it called that's companion cube isn't it
48:14 - in this level and they would always have
48:17 - a hint that I'm gonna be making a portal
48:18 - game well Wow it wasn't it was just
48:21 - because I really like portal and I
48:23 - thought it'd be funny but I do really
48:28 - like portal and I have wondered about
48:30 - making a game based on portal at some
48:33 - point or other just not quite sure where
48:37 - I think it really is quite a good
48:38 - scratch portal game already I'm sure
48:42 - it's the one yes back
48:58 - another thing achieve a metal people
49:01 - have asked whether I had considered
49:04 - making this multiplayer up this game yes
49:07 - I absolutely had I was thinking that
49:11 - would be quite a cool thing to do I
49:12 - guess the idea being you could kind of
49:15 - start climbing mountains and you could
49:16 - see other people doing it too at the
49:17 - same time now it might be a bit laggy
49:24 - problem but it might not I guess the
49:31 - biggest problem is we got quite a few
49:33 - people playing in this game so if it was
49:38 - the usual thing of having 8 players say
49:42 - then it would be I guess the first 8
49:45 - people to whoever actually managed to
49:49 - get on would be the ones that would be
49:51 - playing everybody else I was on
49:54 - everybody else would have to just be
49:56 - watching but the problem being if
50:00 - there's a lot of people the people you
50:03 - want to watch or the really probably the
50:05 - really good ones if they were the ones
50:08 - they favorite to show for their benefit
50:11 - of nobody else then those people
50:14 - wouldn't be able to see the people we're
50:17 - not very good I mean people who are
50:21 - learning ah I see penance what's going
50:25 - really well so the people who are at the
50:29 - bottom of the mountain who are not
50:30 - showing on the multiplayer we're gonna
50:35 - see the people who are doing really good
50:37 - but the people who really couldn't
50:39 - better see the people who weren't it
50:41 - should be a bit of a bummer because you
50:43 - really wanna be able to see the people
50:45 - who are doing so well so that you can
50:47 - help them cuz that's if you think about
50:49 - cloud platform of fun one of the things
50:52 - that really makes that game fun is that
50:56 - what makes that game really fun is the
50:58 - fact that you can you can help out
51:01 - people I really like that probably one
51:04 - of my most unique games and is that
51:08 - being able to do things yourself
51:10 - help
51:11 - show other people how to do them too and
51:17 - if you could not see in this game the
51:18 - people who were not doing so well then
51:20 - you couldn't help them out so there's a
51:23 - bit of a conundrum I'm not really sure
51:25 - where where to go with it
51:28 - I thought eyes up I've done it
51:48 - [Music]
51:54 - you kind of think that we're coming so
51:57 - far that the person might be really good
51:59 - at finishing but no there's actually
52:08 - some Christmas tree branches don't have
52:13 - lips on my purposely did that oh I see
52:20 - now that's Oh
52:22 - Bettis a better space scene still on the
52:27 - best for minutes 35 but I would have
52:30 - been so happy with that
52:31 - yesterday today know what is the rule
52:36 - the high score one minute 46 by DD 886
52:42 - one it's absolutely an unreal and Java
52:46 - programmer has overtaken Bolton the fish
52:50 - and I am sinking down to number six the
52:53 - two minutes 53 I could have done so much
52:55 - better but I got stuck in space for ages
52:58 - it's so frustrating but
54:13 - I wonder whether this game would ever
54:17 - would have worked in scratch to have to
54:24 - say that scratch three has come a long
54:26 - way since it was first released which is
54:33 - very lucky because when the first
54:35 - released it's really slow prepared to
54:38 - scratch to think what a lot of people
54:43 - quite worried oh it's come a long way I
54:47 - know the scratch team are not super
54:50 - happy with the performance of the script
54:52 - editor they're using block which is a
54:55 - Google thing I believe to make the
54:59 - blocks
55:00 - although the Google's version didn't
55:02 - look anywhere near as nice as scratches
55:03 - scratch did a good job of redesigning
55:06 - the scratch blocks to look snazzy but it
55:12 - doesn't perform well for large scripts
55:15 - with computer behind it still quite slow
55:24 - scratch develop math scratch developer
55:28 - extension for the browser helps a bit
55:31 - because it means I can jump around and
55:32 - find mice
55:35 - find my scripts easier but I do think oh
55:41 - I do believe a scratch team of thinking
55:44 - about whether there's an alternative
55:47 - maybe later down the line no no
55:58 - just to ball it's always worth
56:01 - continuing then you get this far anyway
56:02 - though because I'm just not so good at
56:05 - the bit up here at the moment pardon
56:06 - don't practice it enough cuz I don't get
56:09 - it often enough so history
56:31 - this is where I would be raging if I
56:34 - ever got you guys to talk to
56:47 - no scope to rage anyway I go straight up
57:16 - to the left interesting yeah 4:33 how
57:40 - much two minutes what's the world record
57:44 - for 33 records 146 my goodness can you
57:54 - imagine what it must be like it's got
57:58 - imagine it it's amazing
58:01 - that's often
58:07 - I do hope you are I do hope you recorded
58:09 - a video because thankful one will be
58:11 - really happy to see it
58:23 - don't look nothing like this it makes me
58:27 - wonder when he plays it as he also dude
58:30 - these amazing moves like me where he
58:33 - flies
58:45 - Oh
58:50 - Oh
59:03 - oh mercy of all this bitmap it's just
59:16 - the pixels when you're watching games
59:22 - like this physics it's really tricky to
59:26 - work with pixels cuz I've got all these
59:31 - little itches my definition is square so
59:34 - the original game all the mountain was
59:38 - built from 3d assets which therefore had
59:42 - nice hit plugins was done yes all the
59:56 - physics was done using maths
59:58 - oh nice edges which means you can impact
60:04 - nice
60:13 - yeah physics are easy nice mathematical
60:17 - shapes when you have bitmaps like we
60:21 - have in scratch you get stuck on all the
60:24 - pixels which is really frustrating so
60:28 - you have to do your best to mitigate
60:30 - that with the scripting and I've done a
60:35 - pretty good job in this sure does get
60:39 - caught
60:58 - it's name record at least like nothing
61:01 - on this tree
61:09 - no mister
61:27 - oh goodness I can eat you fast laughs I
61:33 - am too far to the left I'm gonna get
61:36 - this one nice nearly nice have I got
61:43 - high enough are you gonna complete or
61:45 - are you gonna go back down again I'll
61:47 - close the light I must be so close man I
61:52 - have had it
61:54 - hang in space for a long time before
61:56 - where I just been on the edge of like
61:58 - the gravity of a planet it can be so
62:01 - frustrating really can I'd love to know
62:05 - what you guys do think of the ending
62:06 - whether I've got that right any of you
62:08 - guys who actually played the original
62:09 - game let me know with comments in my my
62:14 - scrap for jet probably is the best place
62:15 - for it
62:32 - I'm wondering whether anybody's gonna
62:33 - have a go creating another level for
62:35 - this game now that the games out because
62:37 - see it's just costumes it's got quite
62:40 - clever system to know which costume to
62:46 - use where you've got a name the costume
62:48 - as a grid location and it just
62:51 - automatically puts them all together the
62:55 - problem of course is drawing them all
62:57 - because you have to get them all to into
63:00 - the lock if there's any demand maybe I
63:06 - should work on a second level but my
63:09 - goodness how many hours did this one
63:12 - take me do you think
63:23 - take pretty well there's famous last
63:27 - words
63:44 - come on booth batch nice not so nice oh
63:54 - just congratulate myself on getting up
63:57 - this bit so smoothly
64:07 - I'm feeling about that I did it
64:10 - goodness yes I can
64:37 - no no no no no no oh please please
64:47 - please please please please oh that was
64:52 - tential it was potential and now time is
64:56 - ticking away that was looking really
65:00 - quite nice we could have managed a two
65:02 - and a half minutes there we could have
65:04 - done could have been my record my record
65:07 - not the record but it's missed missed it
65:12 - cuz of those space tacos it's very
65:17 - frustrating game isn't it and look at
65:19 - that sucked sideways slowly through
65:24 - space back towards space tacker out of
65:30 - context you wouldn't really quite get
65:32 - what that meant would you it's gonna be
65:36 - maybe three and a half three twenty-four
65:47 - space you'd think if you got that far
65:52 - that would be it that you have it you
65:54 - did a good run yeah but that's not a
65:59 - good position to be in scratch cat I
66:01 - think you have to do it again Oh like I
66:08 - was in slow motion
66:13 - [Laughter]
66:25 - think Meryl brought a significant amount
66:28 - of rage to scratch I do apologize I had
66:33 - no idea it was gonna be quite this bad I
66:37 - kind of thought I would make an easier
66:40 - version and I think I have but it's hard
66:46 - to know you know because I can't
66:48 - actually play that we all get in at the
66:49 - moment
66:49 - as my gaming PC's when out of action so
66:54 - I've had to do this without being had to
66:55 - play the game but when I did play it I
67:01 - was really bad and it frustrated me so
67:06 - much but of course in the making that
67:10 - I'm making at this game I've played this
67:12 - game loads
67:24 - so because I play this so much now what
67:27 - I don't know is whether having done so I
67:30 - actually would be really good at the
67:31 - regional game now but my gut reaction is
68:08 - 50
68:11 - oh you've heard of that you had it
68:26 - consistency's the name and a game Oh
68:33 - popping consistency of falling I don't
68:38 - have it come on you're wasting my time
68:41 - by not sliding yeah
69:05 - that is my least favorite look that a
69:08 - little bit there on that trouser it's so
69:11 - hot so hard to get into and I honestly
69:17 - do not know what it is why sometimes it
69:22 - gets in other times it doesn't it
69:26 - doesn't make any sense to me as to what
69:28 - it is this game I tell you it's funny
69:45 - thing human nature isn't it it's like we
69:48 - like to be punished I think
70:04 - goodness
70:06 - into space all my arms are jiggling it's
70:08 - like they're spasming I'm not surprised
70:10 - after always hard work you would expect
70:12 - them to star spasming a bit I think my
70:16 - fingers will be spasm they after playing
70:18 - this game ah I have seen YouTube videos
70:21 - of people slamming into these bloomin
70:24 - tacos and not like goats obviously and
70:25 - then we all go and just not name what to
70:29 - do with them
70:29 - that was just terrible I'm not even
70:31 - getting not going to do it I'm gonna
70:32 - restart it go I meant to put in more of
70:48 - those comments that you get the start
70:50 - the one that says backwards yeah this
70:56 - comment here I meant to put more of
70:58 - those in I never got around to it I can
71:01 - I was thinking the big point useful like
71:04 - showing people the direction I meant to
71:06 - go in because some people say wait a
71:07 - mintue go here after you get soso bit
71:11 - and I could use those couldn't I'm like
71:13 - comments that's quite pleased when I
71:17 - thought the idea of having the comment
71:18 - of a star there are the fits nicely with
71:21 - scratch not what I actually use them in
71:25 - scratch hobby ever do you guys use the
71:29 - comments in your scratch code I think I
71:33 - would if they if they didn't slow down
71:38 - the scripting area and especially more
71:42 - if they actually rearranged neatly when
71:45 - you move the scripts around the biggest
71:47 - flaw with them it's the father they just
71:53 - stay where they were and you get these
71:56 - funny lines going across your screen
71:57 - where that script is joined on to
72:00 - something Russ semi-random
72:04 - after you've moved your scripts around
72:18 - then whose review guys have got my
72:21 - browser extension for scratch scratch
72:24 - developer tools I think I quit this Matt
72:28 - my goodness is that useful for tidying
72:31 - up your scripts doesn't support tidying
72:33 - comments though but that maybe it's
72:35 - something I should do isn't it really
72:37 - but it's so nice oh no no no it's so
72:44 - nice to be able to click the clean up
72:47 - button
72:47 - I'll have your scripts layout nicely
72:51 - just in one big line like the current
72:55 - scratch the actual bucket game is harder
73:15 - or easier than my back
73:17 - I would guess harder but with my success
73:54 - it's just it's just not I missed it -
74:00 - missed it anything that's close to three
74:10 - minutes to be a good time I spend a lot
74:14 - of time floating around in space I
74:16 - really do
74:18 - it's very sad very sad he looks a bit
74:23 - bored a scratch cat I'm surprised he's
74:27 - actually quite surprising I can survive
74:28 - in space
74:32 - really maybe I should like I've been
74:36 - pull out a little space helmet when he
74:38 - enters the atmosphere that'd be cute
74:41 - yeah I'm liking the animation at the
74:44 - beginning out I have this should be
74:45 - coming out of your pot animation I
74:51 - didn't get round to that I was just in
74:56 - the end desperate to share the game ever
75:03 - since thinking about trying to create
75:05 - the idea I was just being so stoked to
75:08 - get a project out that people could play
75:11 - on closing you that wants people started
75:13 - playing it it'll be real fun
75:21 - and so in the end as soon as I have a
75:23 - project that was share worthy I shared
75:30 - it has to be said I don't often wait
75:37 - before sharing a project that it's
75:40 - actually finished a lot of my projects I
75:42 - will share way way early on already
75:45 - completed a little bit of them I guess
75:48 - I'm I'm quite lucky in that I have such
75:51 - a following that people don't really
75:52 - mind oh I just like falling there very
76:04 - much oh I also just like flying
76:08 - backwards and getting stuck on that and
76:11 - missing this this is where they start to
76:14 - rage because the things that is so easy
76:18 - suddenly to start becoming hard
76:37 - I know I've got here in 12 seconds
76:40 - before
76:47 - but it's just still good Oh quite a good
76:51 - time
76:57 - so this is the first nickel break
77:00 - deposition right no I said it can't hit
77:03 - that you know I just was too far
77:25 - mr. caching caching caching caching
77:30 - caching my good ten seconds behind my
77:36 - best pace
77:44 - it doesn't mean I'm gonna get my record
77:47 - because I always make a mistake
77:57 - just looking
78:02 - yeah much worse
78:30 - what we're doing wrong why isn't it
78:34 - cooking
79:01 - yeah I'm not gonna get it now it's like
79:06 - I'm aiming for the tiger and I tell you
79:08 - it's like could I could I be any more
79:12 - accurate aiming for the taco if I could
79:28 - just pop into the code right now and
79:30 - just delete all those tacos it's very
79:33 - tempting very very tempting to go and do
79:36 - that but of course I'm not going to do
79:42 - that it's supposed to be part of the fun
79:50 - not gonna pay for too much longer now
79:52 - I'm not quite sure what time it is where
79:54 - you are where I am it's oh my goodness
79:58 - it's like something believe it
80:43 - no I mean II don't like these bits where
80:48 - I have to launch myself it's like so
80:53 - what what is it about that suddenly
81:08 - becomes so difficult sometimes it just
81:10 - seems to be easy-peasy
81:12 - like mine now I just look at the angles
81:14 - it just looks wrong it feels like I'm
81:16 - going to go the wrong way I do
81:18 - so what is it why is it look wrong yes I
81:29 - understand why really it just I need to
81:33 - be on the end
81:56 - well a whale space now stop slow slow
82:07 - slow start make up the pace
82:16 - I see was a beautiful bit of pace my
82:24 - stuck
82:49 - I think I'm getting tired maybe that's
82:54 - the reason
83:12 - sometimes you seem to lose control of
83:14 - the whole Mouse
83:24 - I think so much of it has to be down to
83:26 - body memory from playing it over and
83:29 - over again
83:44 - Doyle said
83:52 - well like I said it I only know I only
83:57 - had it on the thing that let me slip I
84:03 - was good today before I launched I
84:07 - shared this project up to then if you've
84:13 - got your hammer or something you pretty
84:16 - much has had it
84:21 - he wouldn't slip which is why I didn't
84:25 - have the snake in which should be just
84:27 - here and snake takes you all the way
84:32 - back to Stars 11 if you manage to take
84:39 - the snake right to the bottom I did draw
84:44 - a snake I had the asset ready to go
84:48 - snake yes I didn't have the snake
84:58 - because I did try and ridge need to add
85:00 - it but it really did not work with the
85:03 - physics yeah what she ended up happening
85:06 - was the hammer stretched out and your
85:09 - arms got longer and it didn't slide just
85:13 - did bad things but because I had changed
85:20 - the code just the day before I released
85:22 - it and added in sliding of
85:32 - oh wait the time lost time daddy didn't
85:38 - I is that a good route to get up space
85:45 - am i there
85:47 - am I being pulled back I'm being pulled
85:51 - back I didn't make it
85:52 - that's just this now
86:01 - I feel like I was in the middle of
86:02 - saying swing again just like last time
86:03 - the snake yes so I didn't put it into
86:07 - the original listen to the game when I
86:09 - released it because the physics didn't
86:11 - work but since then I have updated the
86:16 - physics and they do allow a lot more
86:18 - sliding but the way it works is that
86:25 - they're really slightly bit when you
86:29 - start to slip only occurs when you're
86:32 - travelling quite fast I think probably
86:35 - fast downwards which hopefully only
86:39 - occurs if you're falling
86:51 - but it does add quite a lot to the game
86:55 - the fact that you can slide a lot
87:00 - otherwise those epic Falls would not be
87:03 - anything like as epic and the game just
87:06 - wouldn't be itself but it does really
87:11 - frustrate another interesting thing that
87:23 - is in this game before we haven't
87:26 - noticed is that the cat when he falls
87:31 - really fast you might notice this is
87:33 - that he goes off screen and your hammer
87:38 - ah can go off screen as well when you're
87:41 - moving the screen Scrolls quite a bit
87:44 - you're moving quite fast but of course
87:48 - sensing blocks on scratch any work on
87:51 - screen no no no no no here look see it
87:59 - seemeth off screen now I'll just show
88:01 - you if I fly up here a second wave drop
88:05 - down
88:05 - I got a screen and yeah I can bump into
88:08 - things so how do I do that let's do it
88:10 - here off the screen yeah bang see I was
88:17 - able to detect that even though oops
88:21 - even though I was off screen so actually
88:24 - what happens is it Scrolls the entire
88:26 - level mom to screen with the cat in the
88:32 - middle of the screen does all its
88:34 - detecting and then Scrolls the level
88:37 - back off screen again before before it
88:40 - shows you what's happening so you don't
88:42 - ever see it happening but the screen is
88:44 - actually bouncing back and forth between
88:46 - you being in the middle and you being
88:49 - where you are visually so that it's
88:52 - sensing in one go and all the visuals in
88:57 - the next go go off frame I guess is a
89:00 - way to describe it
89:02 - ah that was a bit of a late addition to
89:08 - the game too because originally it was
89:10 - the cat was lying in the middle of the
89:12 - screen I couldn't really do it any other
89:14 - way but it works a lot better with a
89:21 - slow scrolling and if that effective I'm
89:24 - going off the screen that's quite
89:25 - important to the game
89:40 - could be nice thank you dog Fox actually
89:43 - sy
90:00 - sometimes it feels like you've got like
90:01 - a real oh man I'm not thinking I was
90:13 - gonna say you get into the swing of it
90:14 - and it feels really natural and then
90:19 - other times completely unnatural she was
90:21 - like you've got no control whatsoever
91:02 - Oh
91:09 - Oh No
91:13 - yes that my record okay I've actually
91:16 - got my record
91:18 - it doesn't say saving was it not 254 was
91:25 - my record 253 I haven't got call there
91:34 - but a little bit of catching on the very
91:36 - end there I would have got my record and
91:39 - I'd have been happy Oh
91:41 - maybe another day it's 10 minutes to
91:46 - midnight here so I'm gonna stop there
