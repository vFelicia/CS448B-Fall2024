00:00 - [Music]
00:02 - hello fellow scratchers
00:04 - i'm griff patch and in this part 13 of
00:06 - our tiled scrolling platformer series
00:08 - we are going to complete the work we
00:10 - started on our level editor
00:12 - and also bring in some new fun tiles to
00:14 - enhance our levels
00:15 - then to complete the episode we're going
00:17 - to squeeze in some basic level
00:19 - progression
00:19 - scripts yes we will be able to get to
00:22 - level two
00:24 - now if you've been following along from
00:26 - week to week and don't already have the
00:28 - orange platforming tiles in your project
00:30 - then you'll find them along with other
00:32 - new costumes in the updated asset
00:34 - project on my griffbatch tutor account
00:36 - as always there's a link under the video
00:39 - so
00:39 - let's open that up now and we'll simply
00:42 - backpack the entire
00:43 - tile sprite and the enemy sprite
00:49 - now my backpack is nice and empty you
00:51 - can keep it like this
00:52 - by right-clicking on items you don't
00:54 - want anymore and deleting them from your
00:56 - backpack
00:57 - good to know okay we can now open up our
01:01 - personal tile scrolling projects
01:03 - this would be a good time to make a
01:05 - backup using the file
01:07 - save as copy it's good practice to keep
01:09 - doing this especially between episodes
01:13 - right open your backpack and drag out
01:16 - the
01:16 - enemy and the tiles sprite
01:19 - this will result in us having an enemy 2
01:21 - and a tiles 2 sprite
01:24 - let's start with the tiles 2 sprite if
01:27 - we check out the new costumes
01:29 - oh yeah here we go the first new costume
01:32 - is the bush
01:33 - at costume 31. if i switch to the
01:36 - original tile sprite
01:38 - i'll just confirm that the last costume
01:39 - we had before was the mushroom at
01:42 - costume 30.
01:43 - yeah there it is i hope that's the same
01:46 - for you
01:47 - so we can start copying these new
01:48 - costumes from tiles 2
01:50 - into the original tile sprite one at a
01:52 - time
01:53 - counting as we go
02:02 - yep all the way to costumes 48 and
02:06 - 49. next
02:09 - we'll check out the costumes of our
02:10 - original enemy sprite
02:12 - okay the last one is another mushroom
02:16 - yeah it's costume number 21. click into
02:19 - the enemy 2 sprite
02:20 - and yes costume 21 is also a mushroom
02:24 - so let's begin copying costumes 22
02:27 - and up into the original enemy sprite 22
02:31 - 23 24 and costume 25
02:34 - and that's it i'm looking forward to
02:37 - making use of these costumes aren't you
02:39 - these are for the end of level
02:41 - progression later on in the video
02:42 - so stick around for that just checking
02:46 - that those costumes are all there in the
02:48 - enemy sprite
02:49 - great so we can safely delete the tiles
02:52 - 2 and
02:52 - enemy 2 sprites make sure you delete the
02:55 - right ones
02:56 - we don't want a disaster at this point
02:59 - do we
03:00 - our next job is to configure all the
03:02 - list data required by these sprites
03:05 - click into the editor sprite
03:10 - and make the tile key map list visible
03:13 - also the tile shape list and the tile
03:16 - groups list do you remember what each of
03:19 - these is for
03:20 - don't worry i'll go over these again
03:22 - quickly as we update each one
03:25 - start by clicking into the tiles sprite
03:28 - and enter the costume editor
03:31 - so our first list is the keymap list
03:34 - and this lets us assign a number key to
03:37 - a costume
03:37 - for use in the level editor then when we
03:40 - press that number key
03:42 - we can paint with that costume numbers 1
03:45 - to four have been used for the normal
03:46 - blocks
03:47 - and key nine is for enemies we'll start
03:50 - at row 31 then
03:52 - that's the new bush costume assign that
03:55 - to key number two
03:57 - and the same for the cloud platform key2
04:00 - next up we have the orange platforms all
04:03 - the way up to costume41
04:06 - these can be set to key 3 just like our
04:09 - blue costumes were
04:10 - so yes enter a 3 for each row from 33
04:14 - to 41 then we have four
04:17 - pipe costumes i'll enter these as keys
04:20 - one
04:20 - for rows 42 43 44
04:24 - and 45. right now
04:27 - this star will be an enemy just like the
04:29 - new mushroom was
04:31 - so give it a key of nine and
04:34 - the same for the end box costume it
04:37 - should be treated as an enemy
04:38 - key nine the last two costumes are
04:41 - background tiles
04:43 - and key two will be fine for these i
04:45 - think
04:47 - the next list is the tile shapes list
04:50 - that is used to let our project know
04:52 - which tiles are solid
04:54 - which are platforms and which are not
04:56 - solid at all that is we can walk through
04:57 - them
04:58 - we start at row 32 this is the cloud
05:02 - platform
05:03 - it acts the same as the top of a drop
05:04 - through platform so
05:06 - we enter an equal symbol for that
05:09 - oh look the next three tiles are also
05:11 - the tops of platforms
05:13 - so rows 33 34 and 35 are also equals
05:17 - the rest of the platforms don't count as
05:19 - solid so we can skip through these
05:22 - but the pipe that will be fully solid
05:24 - for the time being
05:26 - so make rows until row 42 in the list
05:30 - and then enter a hash and the same for
05:33 - rows 43 44 and 45 2. that's four hashes
05:37 - and that's it for the solid list so on
05:40 - to the tile group list
05:42 - this was new in the last episode and it
05:44 - was used for the tile
05:46 - auto arranging scripts we use it to
05:49 - group tile costumes that should auto
05:51 - arrange
05:52 - that will apply to the new orange
05:54 - platforms and the pipes
05:56 - i'll just check what group numbers we've
05:58 - already used
06:00 - okay so one and two only so let's use
06:03 - three for the yellow platforms start at
06:06 - row 33 and
06:07 - enter the group numbers of 3 for all the
06:09 - rows up to row 41
06:11 - like this
06:17 - the pipes are next these can be group 4.
06:20 - we'll set rows 42 43
06:22 - 44 and 45 to 4.
06:26 - now we could create a group for these
06:29 - black
06:29 - end tiles here but i don't want to bore
06:32 - you to death so i'm leaving them a b
06:34 - because next up we have to enter the
06:36 - costume recipes
06:37 - oh my i need to make the recipe list
06:40 - visible by going into the editor sprite
06:42 - again
06:43 - and we want the tile recipes list i'll
06:46 - make it nice and big
06:47 - and then go back to the tiles costume
06:49 - editor to see the costumes we are
06:51 - configuring
06:53 - we're starting with costume 33 again now
06:56 - if you need to remember how these codes
06:58 - work then please go back and watch part
07:00 - 12 again because
07:01 - we went into a lot of detail there on
07:03 - how to set these up
07:04 - i did it all again and i'm just going to
07:07 - give you the numbers
07:08 - are you ready the orange platforms
07:10 - starting at costume 33
07:12 - row 33 just enter zero one one zero
07:16 - space zero one zero zero
07:19 - row thirty four enter zero one one one
07:23 - space zero zero one zero space
07:26 - zero zero zero zero space zero one zero
07:30 - one now row thirty five we have
07:34 - zero zero one one zero zero zero one
07:38 - row thirty six enter one one one zero
07:41 - row thirty seven enter one one one one
07:45 - row 38 enter one zero one one
07:49 - and finally row thirty nine enter one
07:51 - one zero
07:52 - zero i'll just scroll down a bit
07:56 - okay row 40 enter one one zero one
08:00 - and space and a one zero zero zero
08:04 - and row forty one enter one zero zero
08:07 - one now the pipes starting at costume 42
08:12 - row 42 enter 0 1 1 0
08:16 - space 0 1 0 0
08:19 - row 43 we enter 0 0 1 1
08:23 - space 0 0 zero one
08:26 - row forty four enter one one one zero
08:30 - space one one zero zero
08:33 - and lastly row forty five we enter
08:36 - one zero one one space one zero zero
08:40 - one for you
08:43 - if you find things are not connecting up
08:45 - after this just rewind the video and
08:47 - check these numbers again okay
08:49 - now i can hide these lists from the
08:51 - editor sprite and we'll give the project
08:53 - a run
08:55 - oh no music i've muted my audio i hope
08:58 - you don't mind
08:59 - now enter the level editor with the zero
09:01 - key
09:03 - press the number one key until you find
09:05 - the new green pipe
09:07 - let's place down these tiles they
09:10 - certainly look great when you make a
09:11 - perfect two-tile wide column
09:14 - love how the floor also self-arranges
09:16 - around them that's beautiful
09:18 - but i want to also show you a limitation
09:20 - we have not accounted for
09:22 - in our tile layouts placing a second
09:25 - pipe next to an existing one throws our
09:27 - layout
09:28 - engine into chaos it doesn't know what
09:30 - to do
09:31 - as soon as we split them apart from each
09:33 - other they perfectly reassemble
09:36 - so what's going on here well our tile
09:39 - arranger
09:40 - only works with solid blocks of tiles
09:43 - the pipes
09:44 - flush up against each other are
09:46 - therefore treated as a single mass of
09:48 - pipe not two single pipes and so the
09:51 - tile arranger doesn't know how to draw
09:52 - that
09:53 - let's start afresh press the three key
09:56 - and look at the blue
09:57 - and orange platforms now i'm loving how
10:00 - the platforms reassemble as we paint
10:02 - them over each other
10:03 - it's really neat but again there is an
10:06 - issue here
10:07 - if you saw how we use these platforms we
10:09 - actually want the orange platform to
10:11 - appear to be
10:12 - in front of the blue platform with the
10:15 - blue platform looking to stay behind
10:17 - not be rearranged to sit together like
10:19 - this
10:20 - so we have two similar problems here
10:23 - both requiring us to paint
10:25 - new tiles but in a way that does not end
10:27 - with us fighting the arrangement of
10:28 - existing tiles
10:30 - i have to say this problem was a real
10:33 - doozy
10:34 - i spent a long time racking my brains as
10:36 - how i could do this
10:37 - but keep it simple enough to convey in a
10:39 - tutorial
10:40 - and finally i struck upon this idea how
10:43 - about we have a special mode
10:46 - that when we paint the tile arranging
10:48 - behaves as if we are painting on a new
10:50 - blank
10:51 - level the new tiles would then only
10:53 - arrange to fit the pattern of the new
10:55 - shape
10:56 - and the level behind would not be
10:57 - affected the final result would be a
11:00 - fast way of layering new level elements
11:02 - over existing ones
11:03 - in a very localized way to pull this off
11:06 - all we need is to keep track of which
11:09 - tiles we have painted
11:10 - since the mouse was clicked and then
11:12 - ensure
11:13 - the costume fixer ignores tiles we have
11:16 - not specifically painted on
11:18 - this time that seems simple enough
11:21 - so let's give it a go make sure we are
11:24 - in the editor sprite
11:25 - and we'll create a new list to keep
11:27 - track of which new tiles have been
11:29 - painted
11:31 - i'll name it edited indexes
11:34 - making it for this sprite only we want
11:37 - this list to be
11:37 - emptied whenever we finish painting new
11:40 - tiles
11:41 - so locate the when i receive move player
11:44 - and here is where we check for the mouse
11:47 - not
11:47 - being pressed in this case we can delete
11:50 - all the edited indexes
11:52 - now find the define paint tile script
11:55 - scroll
11:56 - down a bit to where we check auto being
11:58 - greater than zero
11:59 - this is where we are painting and then
12:01 - about to auto arrange the costume
12:04 - and its neighbors we should make a
12:06 - record
12:07 - of the painted tile indexes at this
12:09 - point
12:10 - but it would be wasteful to allow us to
12:12 - add the same tile indexes to the list
12:14 - more than once
12:15 - so check if the tile index is already in
12:18 - the list
12:18 - using a not edited index contains tile
12:21 - index
12:22 - and only then add tile index to the
12:25 - edited index
12:26 - list without this the list would become
12:29 - huge
12:29 - stuff full of duplicate tile indexes
12:33 - okay excellent look at these
12:36 - usages of fix costume at below
12:39 - we are now keeping track of the painted
12:41 - tiles but we need to limit the fixing up
12:43 - of costumes
12:44 - to be only those tiles in the new list
12:48 - i don't want to do this four times once
12:50 - for each of the fixed costumes
12:52 - so instead let's put the check in the
12:54 - custom block
12:55 - itself navigate to the define fix
12:59 - costume at script
13:00 - and we'll add an if right at the top now
13:04 - here's something new
13:05 - i didn't mention how we were going to
13:07 - turn this local editing feature on and
13:09 - off
13:10 - i'm going to use the space key in my
13:12 - project
13:13 - but you may want to use a different key
13:15 - or add a mode toggle
13:17 - but i like the simplicity of holding
13:19 - down the space key
13:20 - so if key space pressed
13:23 - now when the space key is held down we
13:26 - can prevent the fixing up of costumes
13:28 - that are not
13:29 - already in our list if not edited
13:32 - indexes
13:33 - contains tile index then stop this
13:36 - script
13:37 - oh man hold on hold on this is wrong see
13:40 - i used the tile index variable here this
13:43 - should
13:43 - not have been that it should have been
13:45 - the input variable named idx
13:48 - that is the tile index we are fixing up
13:51 - tile index variable is the tile we are
13:53 - painting
13:54 - wow that would have really messed things
13:56 - up we can test what we have done so far
13:59 - the best way is to use the blue
14:00 - platforms i'll draw one
14:02 - large rectangle like normal but then
14:05 - i'll hold down the space key
14:07 - and draw another one by its side
14:10 - so what have we got here you can see
14:13 - that the first rectangle has not been
14:15 - affected
14:16 - by the newly drawn tiles that's a plus
14:19 - but on the downside this new rectangle
14:21 - is acting as if
14:22 - it was still connected to the old
14:24 - rectangle
14:25 - that is not what we want and it's like
14:28 - that because we have yet to tell the
14:29 - recipe
14:30 - builder to exclude tiles not in our new
14:32 - list of painted indexes
14:35 - find the define build recipe script
14:38 - edge index is the tile we are checking
14:40 - out at this time
14:43 - so again only if key space is pressed
14:49 - and if
14:53 - not edited indexes contains
15:00 - the edge index then
15:03 - we are considering a tile that we have
15:05 - not yet painted within
15:07 - so we want to treat it as a blank tile
15:10 - to do this
15:11 - set recipe to the join of recipe and the
15:14 - number zero
15:15 - there and finally stop this script
15:19 - right are you feeling good about this i
15:22 - am
15:22 - let's give it a test i'll draw a blue
15:25 - platform area as before
15:27 - and then holding down my space key i'll
15:30 - make a new rectangle in front of the
15:32 - first
15:33 - and yes look at that it works
15:35 - beautifully
15:36 - what a triumph it's very pleasing to be
15:38 - able to paint these new blocks
15:40 - in front of the old ones and this should
15:42 - work for pipes too
15:45 - and yes it does look at how i can now
15:47 - draw each pipe
15:49 - as an individual local paint session by
15:51 - holding down the space
15:52 - key that way they don't consider each
15:54 - other when laying themselves out
15:56 - and we are free to draw them anywhere we
15:58 - please yep
15:59 - even over the blue tiles too i think
16:02 - this is a really excellent solution to a
16:04 - complex issue
16:06 - now can i show you another editor
16:08 - feature we should improve
16:11 - i have the auto arranging turned on and
16:13 - i select the blue tile costume using the
16:15 - three key
16:16 - and draw with that now i want to draw an
16:19 - orange platform tile
16:20 - i have to click through all the blue
16:22 - platforms using the three key until i
16:24 - stumble across the orange tile
16:26 - well that's a bit wasteful isn't it in
16:28 - auto mode
16:29 - i only want to choose either a blue or
16:32 - an orange tile type
16:33 - i no longer need to click through all
16:34 - these different costumes just one of
16:36 - each group
16:38 - that would save us a lot of fiddling
16:39 - time finding the right costume
16:42 - so find the define next brush custom
16:45 - block
16:46 - this is triggering when i press a number
16:48 - key and at present it repeatedly moves
16:50 - on to the next costume
16:52 - stopping when the key mapping of the
16:54 - costume matches the key that was pressed
16:57 - so i'm now thinking we skip over all
17:00 - but the first costume from any tile
17:02 - group
17:03 - that is we'd allow the selection of the
17:05 - first blue platform tile
17:07 - but none of the others matter so they
17:09 - are all skipped
17:10 - to do that we need the tile group for
17:13 - the brush
17:13 - costume we'll first set tile group to
17:16 - item
17:17 - chosen brush of tile group
17:26 - first let's consider when we don't want
17:28 - to skip costumes
17:30 - when auto mode is disabled that is auto
17:33 - is less than one
17:34 - then we need to allow selection of every
17:36 - tile
17:41 - and then also when the costume is not
17:44 - part
17:44 - of any tile group that is when tile
17:47 - group
17:48 - equals the empty value in both these
17:50 - cases we can stop this script right away
17:53 - just as we used to do right
17:56 - if we got past that then the brush is
17:58 - part of a tile group we only want to
18:00 - stop
18:01 - if it is the first one of that group in
18:03 - the list
18:05 - so how do we find the first matching
18:07 - value in a list
18:09 - if item hash of tile group in tile
18:12 - groups
18:13 - that gives us the row number of the
18:14 - first item in the list matching the tile
18:16 - group
18:17 - variable so if we compare that with the
18:20 - current costume
18:21 - then this will only be true if the
18:23 - current costume is the first tile from
18:26 - that tile group
18:27 - i think that's quite clever so if it is
18:29 - the first costume of the tile group
18:31 - we can again stop this script otherwise
18:34 - we'll skip it
18:35 - and let the repeat loop look at the next
18:37 - costume in the list instead
18:39 - i think we dare test that now and
18:41 - entering the level editor
18:43 - and pressing 3 selects the blue tile and
18:45 - then again
18:46 - now goes straight on to the next tile
18:48 - type and then toggles back and forward
18:50 - without any of those in between tile
18:52 - costumes
18:53 - super that's just what i was aiming for
18:56 - see how quickly i can switch now as i
18:58 - paint the level
18:59 - the same applies to pipes and wooden
19:01 - blocks yay
19:03 - so there's one more editor tweak we
19:06 - should add before we are free to move on
19:08 - to other topics
19:09 - and that is to fix the eyedropper tool
19:11 - that's the e
19:12 - key where it lets us pick a brush from
19:14 - any tile on the screen
19:16 - and we use it right away and well there
19:19 - lies the problem
19:20 - you can't select any tile it doesn't
19:22 - work on the enemies
19:24 - well that's an easy fix luckily locate
19:27 - the
19:27 - when e key press block in the editor
19:29 - sprite
19:30 - do you remember how we store the enemies
19:32 - in lists object idx
19:34 - is a list of tile indexes and object
19:37 - type
19:38 - is a list of enemy types at those
19:40 - indexes
19:41 - so let's first look at the indexes we'll
19:44 - need a new variable
19:45 - we'll name it obj object hash
19:48 - for this sprite only now set object hash
19:51 - to
19:57 - item hash of tile index in
20:00 - object index object idx
20:08 - this will let us know if there are any
20:09 - enemies located at the tile index under
20:12 - the mouse cursor
20:14 - use an if else and we'll set the chosen
20:16 - brush in both cases
20:18 - check first where the object hash is
20:20 - greater than zero
20:24 - if it is then there was an enemy so we
20:27 - can look up which enemy type that was
20:29 - set the chosen brush to item object hash
20:32 - of object type
20:37 - good that should give us back the type
20:39 - of the enemy at the given tile location
20:42 - run the project now pressing e over a
20:44 - normal tile still sets my brushes before
20:47 - but here goes if i mouse over a gumba
20:49 - and press e
20:50 - here i can now pick up the gumba brush
20:53 - so much easier
20:54 - i love that and the same with this
20:56 - mushroom excellent
20:58 - and the great thing about this is that
20:59 - now it allows me to select and then
21:01 - click to remove
21:02 - an enemy much faster press an e and then
21:05 - click
21:06 - the level editor is becoming so cool
21:08 - don't you think
21:10 - but now time for something completely
21:13 - different
21:14 - have you seen how the level end screens
21:16 - look in super mario bros 3 advanced
21:19 - unlike traditional super mario we don't
21:21 - have the usual flag at the right hand
21:23 - side of the level
21:24 - instead we get an interesting dark area
21:27 - like we've run out of level and then in
21:29 - the middle is a box that contains a
21:30 - power up of some sort that is cycling
21:32 - away in the background
21:34 - i assume this is collected as an end of
21:36 - level perk
21:37 - before the level concludes and we are
21:38 - able to move on to the next level
21:41 - so how much of this can we cram into the
21:43 - last part of this video
21:45 - let's start with the end box sprite
21:48 - click into the enemy sprite and you
21:49 - should find that the n-boxes costumes
21:52 - are here where we put them earlier the
21:54 - first empty costume is named end
21:56 - box just as one word with a capital e
21:59 - and a capital b
22:00 - and there are three more costumes
22:02 - following that showing the different
22:03 - perks available
22:05 - we need to initially tell the enemy
22:06 - sprite how to clone this type of enemy
22:09 - find the define spawn type custom block
22:12 - and we'll duplicate the last if to
22:13 - define
22:14 - a new type of enemy
22:17 - we don't want this set frame to -1 so
22:20 - delete that
22:21 - to find the tile type we want to check
22:23 - the costume number of the tile sprite
22:26 - if we look up the end box in the tile
22:28 - sprite we find its costume number is 47.
22:32 - so back in the enemy sprite check if
22:34 - tile type
22:35 - equals 47 then in the set type custom
22:38 - block
22:39 - set the type to end box capital e
22:42 - capital b without a space the costume is
22:45 - the same
22:46 - end box and leave the width and height
22:48 - as 16.
22:50 - okay we are good to run the project and
22:52 - we can rush over to the right hand side
22:54 - of the entire
22:55 - level
22:59 - now we have some work to do press the 2
23:02 - key until you find the dark square
23:04 - and now we need to paint a large area
23:07 - i'm standing
23:08 - so that the right hand wall is just off
23:10 - screen
23:11 - and now begin to fill in the entire
23:13 - background black
23:16 - this is actually quite therapeutic
23:20 - and then scrolling to the left a little
23:22 - i press two again until i find the black
23:24 - edge costume
23:26 - this i paint up the edge like so now if
23:29 - you want to challenge
23:30 - you could update the tile groups and
23:32 - recipes to make this
23:33 - auto arrange too because of this
23:36 - platform to the left
23:37 - i'm going to raise the height of the
23:39 - dark area just a little bit more
23:41 - there right and now we can place the end
23:44 - box
23:45 - press nine until it comes up and i think
23:48 - it wants placing around the middle point
23:51 - about there great the reason i made this
23:55 - an
23:55 - enemy in the first place was because the
23:57 - sprite is larger than a single tile
24:00 - so it otherwise would have to be made up
24:02 - of nine smaller costumes
24:03 - i didn't really fancy that so i did it
24:05 - this way
24:06 - there's no particular right or wrong in
24:08 - these things and you just have to weigh
24:10 - up the plus and minuses and then just go
24:12 - for it
24:13 - so exiting the level editor i can now
24:16 - check this out
24:17 - and it's looking pretty sweet all we
24:19 - need to make it look authentic
24:21 - is to add the animating perk in this box
24:24 - for that find the when i receive move
24:26 - enemy script and scroll
24:27 - right down to the bottom here is where
24:30 - we process
24:31 - each enemy type so again duplicate this
24:34 - last one
24:34 - and we'll check for a type of end box
24:38 - chuck away the tick life block and we'll
24:40 - handle this ourselves
24:42 - to animate the costume we'll use the
24:44 - frame variable
24:46 - change frame by 0.15
24:50 - the larger this value the faster the
24:52 - perk will change
24:53 - next set costume to now i'll just check
24:56 - the costume number of the first
24:57 - nbox perk
25:03 - it's 23 okay so set the costume variable
25:06 - to 23
25:07 - plus and then use a mod of three
25:11 - to cycle between the three costumes
25:14 - lastly on the left of the mod
25:16 - place a floor of frame remember that
25:19 - floor rounds the number down to the
25:20 - nearest whole number
25:22 - finally place the stop this script at
25:24 - the end of the if
25:25 - and we are ready to test
25:30 - oh yeah that's looking very authentic
25:33 - indeed
25:33 - i just need a way to be able to collect
25:35 - it to trigger the end of level
25:37 - now you'll note i can't walk off the
25:38 - right of the level because there's a
25:40 - wall there
25:41 - that we will have to work around but
25:43 - first things first
25:44 - we can make a simple collection script
25:46 - right here after setting the costume
25:49 - if touching mario then
25:56 - but i'm going to add another test to
25:57 - make things a little better checking if
25:59 - the distance to mario is less than 28
26:02 - this is to ensure it doesn't trigger
26:04 - from too far away
26:06 - i want mario to overlap the tile a
26:08 - little bit since it otherwise includes
26:10 - the n-box border in the collision
26:13 - and then very similar to how we
26:14 - triggered the mario death we can
26:16 - broadcast a new message
26:18 - mario level complete this frees us up to
26:21 - script the end of the level any way we
26:23 - please
26:24 - however we probably want to make the end
26:25 - perk appear collected
26:27 - so let's replace the last costume with
26:29 - the empty end box now
26:32 - to do that we can set type to pretty
26:34 - much any unused value
26:35 - i'll pick the word costume to represent
26:37 - a single unchanging costume
26:39 - and then set the costume to end box
26:42 - capital e
26:43 - capital b without space there we can
26:46 - give that another quick test
26:47 - just hold on a second right so if i now
26:51 - jump
26:51 - into the end box oh nice we can collect
26:54 - the perk
26:55 - or at least it appears so at this point
26:57 - one day we'll have to do something with
26:59 - it won't we
27:00 - but this is not that day so
27:03 - now we have the end box triggering the
27:06 - level complete event
27:07 - i think we should put something together
27:09 - quickly to get mario to register this
27:11 - event
27:12 - click into the mario sprite and we can
27:14 - find existing when i receive mario
27:16 - lose life we want to do something quite
27:19 - similar here
27:20 - only the animation will be different and
27:22 - instead of the level of his setting
27:24 - we will reset to the next level instead
27:27 - therefore duplicate the when i receive
27:29 - mario lose life and we can drag it into
27:31 - some free space
27:33 - right what can we remove from this
27:35 - script first off we don't want to play
27:37 - this lose live
27:38 - sound or set the player action to lose
27:40 - life
27:41 - we can take this a block of script at a
27:43 - time so i'll move everything
27:45 - under the first repeat over to the right
27:48 - what we're leaving in
27:49 - is the stop other scripts in sprite that
27:52 - is what causes the other main game loop
27:54 - to end
27:55 - and this one to take over in its place
27:58 - so i watched more videos of how mario
28:00 - reacts to the end of level perk
28:01 - collisions
28:02 - i note he tends to stop dead in his
28:04 - tracks so we can do the same by setting
28:06 - speed x to zero
28:08 - now instead of repeating a fixed number
28:10 - of times
28:11 - bring in a repeat and till block mario
28:14 - will be in the middle of a jump
28:16 - so let's repeat until he's back on the
28:18 - ground
28:19 - how can we tell that well falling will
28:21 - be less than one
28:22 - this number is always increasing until
28:24 - we land on the ground
28:26 - now to decide what needs to go within
28:28 - this loop
28:29 - we are completely taking control of the
28:31 - main game loop
28:32 - so to enable mario to still finish his
28:34 - jump and fall to the ground
28:36 - we can first use the handle keys jump
28:38 - block
28:39 - and then the move sprite x and move
28:42 - sprite y blocks
28:43 - and lastly bring back the paint sprite
28:46 - and broadcast position tiles blocks
28:49 - the old repeat loop can be deleted this
28:52 - should now bring mario down to the
28:53 - ground
28:54 - but it should be completely
28:55 - uncontrollable by the player
28:58 - we can give this a quick test i'm just
29:00 - zooming over to the end of the level
29:01 - oh wow wait i almost messed up again
29:04 - look
29:05 - we left the when i receive event as
29:07 - mario lou's life
29:08 - so sorry change that to be when i
29:10 - receive mario
29:11 - level complete of course right
29:14 - i can now safely jump into the nbox and
29:17 - pow i
29:17 - fall to the ground i can confirm i have
29:20 - completely lost control of mario now
29:22 - that's perfect as we now just want him
29:24 - to run off screen to the right to
29:26 - conclude the level
29:28 - we'll begin that process by ensuring
29:30 - that we are facing right
29:31 - point in direction 90. now we'll repeat
29:34 - until
29:38 - their x position is greater than 250.
29:41 - that is he's off the right-hand edge of
29:43 - the screen oh now hold on
29:45 - isn't there a wall in the way of mario
29:47 - to his right yes there is but don't
29:49 - worry
29:50 - this ending animation is no longer going
29:52 - to obey any laws of the level
29:54 - we just change x by 5 to move them right
29:57 - change player frame by 0.6 to give them
30:00 - an animation
30:02 - and lastly add the paint sprite and
30:04 - broadcast position tiles to ensure
30:06 - everything is drawn correctly so with
30:09 - mario off-screen we are all but
30:11 - done if we had an in-between level fade
30:14 - or splash screen then we could trigger
30:16 - that now but
30:17 - as we don't how about we simply trigger
30:19 - the next level to load
30:21 - this should be super easy for us we
30:23 - already have the level reload when we
30:24 - died
30:25 - and the scripts are just here to the
30:26 - right i'll also keep the repeat 30 loop
30:29 - to pause a second before
30:30 - loading we can delete the rest of these
30:33 - old duplicated scripts now
30:35 - so to make the next level load instead
30:37 - of the same one
30:38 - we simply change level by one and drop
30:40 - it in just before the broadcast to level
30:42 - load
30:43 - like so simple before we test this
30:46 - though
30:47 - a quick shout out to channel member
30:48 - james who spotted a soundbug during
30:50 - early access
30:51 - that will teach me from using my audio
30:53 - while recording click into the sound
30:55 - sprite and we'll add a stop
30:57 - other scripts in sprite to the top of
30:59 - the define music script
31:01 - without this we get the awful crackly
31:02 - music in level 2.
31:04 - if you're interested why well it's
31:06 - because both of these two broadcast
31:07 - receivers end up running the same
31:09 - foreverloop script
31:10 - at the same time continually
31:12 - interrupting one another and only
31:13 - getting to play the tiniest part of the
31:15 - sound
31:15 - before the other interrupts and does the
31:17 - same thing continually
31:19 - forever yuck and this is it folks
31:23 - the final test for today let me get over
31:25 - to the level end and
31:27 - gosh will it work i'll jump at the end
31:30 - box
31:31 - now you can see mario correctly turned
31:32 - around and is walking off screen
31:34 - there's a pause and celebration this is
31:37 - indeed
31:38 - level two such that it is can you
31:40 - believe we finally got here
31:42 - now there's plenty of room for
31:44 - improvements but i really wanted to at
31:46 - least get things working
31:47 - and we certainly have that for those who
31:50 - would have liked to have seen
31:51 - a classic mario flag ending well that
31:53 - would be no problem here either
31:55 - you would just need to swap the end box
31:57 - for an end flagpole
31:59 - then fix up the end animation where
32:01 - mario drops down to be in time with your
32:03 - falling flag
32:04 - i think that would be quite possible
32:06 - when within your reach
32:08 - in reality it's not so different really
32:10 - what i
32:11 - am excited about is that we have reached
32:13 - a point where i don't have any obvious
32:15 - loose ends
32:16 - and that frees us up to look at more
32:18 - interesting topics
32:19 - next time gosh do we have a whole load
32:22 - of requests
32:22 - there i will shortly put up a new poll
32:25 - just to see what you guys would like to
32:26 - prioritize some possibilities include
32:29 - the original small mario power ups
32:32 - crouching
32:32 - new enemies sloping tiles checkpoints
32:34 - title screens and menus oh
32:36 - man so much to think about but that
32:39 - brings us to the end of another episode
