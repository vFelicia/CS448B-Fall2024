00:00 - hello there fellow scratches have you
00:02 - been wondering how people have been
00:04 - getting sub 1 minute speedruns on my mo
00:06 - platformer game I'm Griff patch and I'm
00:08 - here to let you in on the best secrets
00:10 - to getting those crazy fast times if you
00:12 - want to give a shot yourself then
00:14 - there's a link to the game under the
00:15 - video but do you hang around because
00:17 - after the initial speedrun I'm going to
00:18 - slow it all down and talk you through
00:20 - how to squeeze the best times from each
00:22 - section of the level as it currently
00:23 - stands if you've been following me on
00:26 - scratch some time then you may recognize
00:28 - this project as being a combination of
00:29 - two of my earlier test projects the
00:31 - first released in 2016 was called
00:33 - playing with ideas as scrolling platform
00:35 - or bass the second cloud Firefly test
00:38 - shared back in April 2000 19 however
00:41 - this project smashed the 40 player
00:42 - record and has reached an astonishing
00:44 - 116 players at one time and the
00:47 - platforming scripts have been cleverly
00:49 - devised - rather than battle the lag
00:51 - problems it actually works with a lack
00:53 - to stream players gameplay in time with
00:55 - each other to create a seamless
00:56 - massively multiplayer experience no
00:59 - obviously it's not perfect as you might
01:00 - see players hanging around in the air
01:02 - now and then but seriously it's amazing
01:04 - we've got this to work at all right and
01:06 - there we have it a sub war minute time
01:09 - of fifty six point six seconds very
01:11 - respectable and yet still no world
01:14 - record gosh so I'm going to play through
01:17 - the video again but we'll slow right
01:19 - down so I can talk you through how it's
01:20 - done which I'm the first jump to land on
01:23 - the first stamping barricade and we
01:25 - quickly hop onto the next one allowing
01:26 - us to perform a long jump to reach the
01:28 - yellow step to the right
01:30 - but hold on there how do you do that
01:32 - long jump thing well okay for that
01:34 - you'll need a little practice you need
01:36 - to hold down the right key to begin
01:38 - running and then quickly tap the down
01:40 - key and then the up key immediately
01:42 - after each other did you get that
01:44 - run crouch jump and it sends you
01:46 - cartwheeling through the air sideways
01:48 - now jump onto the rotating lift I stand
01:51 - around the middle to give room for a
01:52 - running jump onto the blue platform this
01:54 - will give us enough time to catch the
01:56 - rising lift and try and get on to the
01:58 - top run this is crucial to our time
02:00 - otherwise we'll be on sync with the
02:01 - later obstacles and we'll be slowed down
02:03 - now take a leap of faith and long jump
02:06 - off the lift and we should land
02:07 - beautifully just before the long blue
02:09 - appeal then immediately do another long
02:12 - jump while we are still too
02:13 - the flat ground as it's easy to pull it
02:16 - off here and then jump jump jump up the
02:18 - slope to keep your high speed at the top
02:21 - make another long jump to take us across
02:23 - the void and then just run down this
02:25 - slope we don't need a jump here as that
02:27 - full speed we should just drop onto each
02:29 - platform as we reach them and then we
02:31 - reach the gray columns this part takes a
02:34 - little swift coordination to pull off at
02:36 - speed as we want to keep running but as
02:38 - we jump over the gaps in the floor
02:40 - we need to immediately release the right
02:42 - key just for a split moment to reduce
02:44 - our speed enough not to hit our heads on
02:46 - the following gray columns
02:47 - really tricky to get right but power
02:49 - mount to then getting us to the third
02:51 - column masher at just the right time to
02:54 - run right underneath without having to
02:55 - wait and now all the beautiful move this
02:59 - was devised by the awesome dab man 20k
03:02 - the current world record holder on this
03:04 - level and oh it's so good jump up to the
03:07 - flag and then immediately long jump onto
03:10 - the third rung of the rising and falling
03:11 - lift jump before you reach the purple
03:14 - floor to save just a moment of time and
03:16 - then jump back again up towards the
03:18 - purple step and here you will grip the
03:20 - wall long enough to wall jump off to the
03:22 - right and again spring back to the left
03:24 - to reach the second step and launch
03:26 - yourself up onto the lift before it
03:28 - passes you by and takes you right to the
03:30 - very top man I can't get enough of that
03:33 - what a move and now run run run down the
03:36 - hill to reach the furthest most flag now
03:39 - when you reach the flag turn around and
03:40 - do a long jump just to save a bit of
03:42 - time on the turn
03:43 - now get jumping up the hill we run at
03:45 - full speed across the lift rung and do a
03:46 - standard jump off the end keeping our
03:48 - left key held down at all times this
03:51 - should land us perfectly at the foot of
03:53 - the grave masher hopefully if all our
03:56 - timing was done right just as it's gone
03:58 - up and we've managed to dash through
03:59 - phew
04:00 - that is all the hardest part done now
04:03 - jump the gaps remembering again to try
04:05 - and release the run key just for a
04:07 - moment to prevent us losing too much
04:09 - time from bashing our heads and jump
04:11 - onto the first blue platform jump jump
04:13 - and then long jump once to get our jump
04:16 - timing right for once we make it to the
04:17 - top of the incline and then at the void
04:19 - we long jump across run down the slope
04:21 - and long jump the gap we spring off the
04:23 - last blue platform onto the lift
04:25 - across two wall jump and skip another
04:27 - rung do you think we might better pull
04:29 - off another wall jump here to get to the
04:31 - rung above feels like I'm waiting for
04:33 - ages and now it's the home run we leap
04:36 - off the lift as quickly as possible and
04:37 - then just run trusting our feet we'll
04:39 - find things to land on and finally long
04:42 - jump off the last of the yellow steps
04:43 - across to the barricades make the final
04:46 - jump to land at full speed on the end of
04:47 - run flag and celebrate woohoo what a
04:50 - time to be alive we did it what a score
04:52 - what a time ha
04:54 - so can you beat my time I bet you can
