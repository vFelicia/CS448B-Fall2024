00:01 - hello fellow scratchers
00:03 - i'm griff batch and welcome back to part
00:05 - five of our series
00:06 - creating a tiled scrolling platformer in
00:08 - scratch
00:09 - we've been working really hard building
00:11 - up our game engine and now i'm dead
00:13 - excited to have reached a point with you
00:15 - where we can finally begin to build up
00:17 - an in-game level editor
00:19 - you will have noticed me showing off a
00:21 - little creative demo of what's in store
00:23 - today
00:24 - but oh man enough of me talking let's
00:26 - begin coding
00:28 - okay my preference is that we will
00:30 - repurpose the generate script for
00:31 - scripting the level editor
00:33 - so click on it and give it the new name
00:36 - editor
00:37 - now the original level size was far too
00:39 - small to contain our upcoming levels of
00:41 - epicness
00:42 - so we'll set grid width to 100 and grid
00:45 - height
00:45 - to 40. you should also remove the
00:48 - spattering of beautiful golden blocks
00:50 - by removing the if else and keeping just
00:53 - the add 2 to tile grid
00:55 - lastly switch the floor tiles from
00:57 - costume 10
00:58 - to costume 7. this is the official floor
01:01 - costume from the tile set
01:03 - now let's run the project and check out
01:05 - the new basic level we have generated
01:08 - yeah i like the floor and wow it is
01:11 - surprising how big the level feels now
01:13 - it's 100 tiles long
01:15 - still going so this is a good start
01:20 - next we'll define a new variable named
01:23 - editor
01:23 - for all sprites and we'll set it to 1
01:28 - in the when i receive generate level
01:30 - script
01:31 - a value larger than 0 will mean that our
01:33 - game is in level editor mode
01:34 - surround the generate level usage with
01:37 - an if
01:38 - length of the tile grid equals zero
01:42 - this will now only run if we've deleted
01:44 - our level
01:46 - i'm just moving all these scripts down
01:47 - here out of the way
01:49 - right level editing we need an event
01:52 - from our game loop to hang the editor
01:54 - scripts off
01:55 - so bring in a when event receiver and
01:57 - we'll borrow the move player event
01:59 - as it is the first one that gets called
02:02 - straight away
02:03 - checking whether the editor variable is
02:05 - less than one
02:06 - if it is then we stop the script right
02:08 - here as the editor is not enabled
02:11 - okay now this bit is fun
02:14 - click into our player sprite and find
02:17 - the define
02:18 - get tile at x y custom block this is a
02:21 - super useful block
02:22 - and it would be a very nice if we could
02:25 - just use it again in our level editor
02:27 - and luckily we can grab the whole custom
02:30 - block
02:31 - and drop it on to the editor sprite now
02:34 - hold on there remember for a moment that
02:36 - this block is using variables like tile
02:38 - and
02:39 - tile grid x and y these were created
02:42 - for this sprite only the mario sprite
02:46 - so how will they work in a different
02:48 - sprite like the editor sprite
02:51 - well let's take a look click back into
02:54 - our editor sprite and we'll find a copy
02:56 - of the get tile x y custom block waiting
02:58 - for us
02:59 - be it smooched right over my other
03:01 - scripts i'll just move it into a better
03:04 - position
03:05 - now look at this all the variables that
03:08 - were used by this custom block have been
03:10 - magically recreated for us in this
03:11 - sprite
03:12 - if we make the tile variable visible we
03:14 - can also confirm that it has been
03:16 - recreated for this
03:17 - sprite only now for the editor sprite
03:20 - not
03:20 - mario that's nice thank you scratch
03:24 - we'll quickly make use of this block
03:26 - getting the tile at
03:28 - mouse x plus camera x by mouse y
03:31 - plus camera y we must remember to add
03:34 - the camera position to our mouse's
03:36 - position so that it caters for the
03:37 - scrolling screen
03:39 - okay and test what we should see is that
03:42 - the tile variable is now updating to
03:44 - show the tile costume
03:46 - under the mouse cursor value of 7 for
03:48 - the bottom tiles
03:49 - 2 for the background and 10 for the
03:51 - wooden tiles
03:52 - awesome so we want to allow the player
03:56 - to click the mouse
03:57 - and to set a tile to the new costume
04:00 - we'll start by adding an
04:02 - if not mouse down then stop this script
04:05 - okay so the next scripts will only run
04:08 - if the mouse is pressed down
04:10 - this next bit is so easy you won't
04:12 - believe it use a replace
04:14 - item tile index of tile grid
04:17 - with 10. i'm going to test this right
04:21 - away
04:21 - i can just click and draw out a little
04:23 - wooden platform like this
04:25 - run and jump and then draw some more no
04:27 - way how is this possible right
04:30 - i just love that so much don't you but
04:33 - i want more what if i want to remove
04:36 - a tile again okay so in all my level
04:40 - editors
04:40 - i have this feature that if you draw
04:42 - over an existing tile
04:44 - then it clears it so let's do that
04:47 - make a new variable named brush for this
04:50 - sprite only
04:52 - and we'll set it to zero in the when i
04:55 - receive
04:56 - generate level script we'll also set it
04:59 - to zero when the mouse is not pressed
05:01 - a brush of zero therefore means that we
05:03 - are not
05:04 - painting so we'll check for this
05:06 - condition before doing the actual
05:08 - painting here
05:09 - that is for brush equals zero within
05:12 - there
05:13 - we now add an if else block and we'll
05:16 - check where the tile
05:17 - equals ten now remember we just got the
05:20 - tile under the mouse
05:21 - using the get tile at block above so if
05:24 - the tile we are about to paint over is
05:26 - already a 10
05:28 - then we will instead paint with a brush
05:30 - of two
05:32 - that is the blank tile otherwise we do
05:35 - indeed want to paint with costume 10.
05:38 - lastly replace the 10 here with the
05:40 - variable brush
05:42 - hooray my favorite time yup it's testing
05:44 - time
05:45 - yes this is very good i can click and
05:48 - drag to paint
05:49 - but if i click again on an already
05:51 - painted tile then i can clear those
05:53 - blocks away
05:54 - loving it i think we can now safely hide
05:57 - these variable reporters
05:59 - now i know what you're thinking you're
06:01 - missing that gorgeous golden block right
06:04 - create a new variable named chosen brush
06:07 - for this sprite only
06:08 - and set it to 10 in the when i receive
06:11 - generate level script
06:13 - this variable indicates the brush that
06:15 - we are intending to paint with
06:17 - come back to the paint script we should
06:19 - then replace both usages of the value
06:22 - 10 with this new chosen brush variable
06:25 - choosing the brush can be super easy for
06:27 - now drag in a when
06:29 - key press tap block and trigger it off
06:32 - the 1 key and simply set
06:34 - chosen brush to 9. the lovely golden
06:38 - block
06:39 - nice and we can duplicate that up
06:42 - and have the 2 key setting chosen brush
06:45 - to 10.
06:47 - let's run the project and see if the one
06:48 - and two keys do indeed let us paint with
06:51 - a different costume
06:53 - and yes they do the one key has me
06:55 - fashioning handsome golden platforms all
06:58 - over
06:58 - and the two key lets me go back to using
07:01 - wooden blocks
07:03 - also the delete feature is working just
07:05 - the same
07:06 - very very good so how could we make this
07:09 - even better well at present
07:12 - we can't see what the brush is that
07:14 - we're about to paint with
07:16 - so how about we add that click into the
07:19 - tile sprite
07:20 - and look at the define setup script now
07:23 - can you remember way back in episode 1
07:26 - why we added this hide block at the
07:28 - bottom of the setup script
07:30 - well it was because we always had one
07:32 - tile left over after creating all the
07:34 - clones
07:35 - so we simply hid it okay well then
07:39 - how about we actually make use of it now
07:41 - to show the current editor brush well
07:44 - that would be efficient wouldn't it
07:46 - first we need to have a way of
07:47 - identifying this sprite from all the
07:49 - others
07:50 - so after we hide it set tile index to
07:52 - the empty value
07:53 - so that every other clone will have an
07:55 - index but this one will not
07:58 - next under the define position tile
08:00 - script
08:01 - let's separate out the first two ifs
08:03 - that deal with looping around
08:04 - off-screen tiles and bring in a new if
08:07 - else block
08:08 - the looping tile if scripts can move
08:11 - into the else
08:12 - and the lower scripts just need tacking
08:14 - on the end
08:15 - the condition for this if should be a
08:18 - check for tile index
08:19 - equals the empty value just capturing
08:22 - this single leftover sprite
08:25 - let's define a new custom block for the
08:26 - editor brush scripts
08:28 - naming it editor brush run without
08:31 - screen refresh
08:33 - and we'll make use of it right here
08:35 - specifically for that one hidden tile
08:36 - with a blank tile index
08:41 - okay so if editor is less than one
08:48 - or if the mouse is pressed and we don't
08:50 - want to show the brush
08:52 - and we stop this script now we want to
08:55 - position this little tile on the screen
08:58 - at the position referred to by the
08:59 - editor sprite
09:01 - so set tile x to are you ready for this
09:04 - 32 multiplied by and now we'll use the
09:08 - off block from the sensing category
09:10 - setting it to the editor sprite
09:13 - and now we can choose the tile grid x
09:15 - variable
09:16 - that will have been set by the last call
09:18 - to the get tile at
09:20 - in the editor now all we need to do is
09:23 - add 16 pixels to this
09:24 - to account for the centering of the
09:26 - costume we'll do the same for the y
09:28 - position
09:29 - with the sceptile y and the tile grid y
09:32 - and the tile costume itself well that's
09:35 - set on the editor sprite too
09:36 - so set tile to chosen brush of editor
09:40 - to make it beautiful we can set ghost
09:43 - effect to 50
09:44 - so we can see through it and lastly
09:46 - don't forget to show this hidden sprite
09:50 - ah now two more changes before we can
09:52 - try it out we need to remember to hide
09:54 - the tile when the editor is disabled
09:56 - and also scroll over to when i receive
09:59 - position tile script
10:00 - and we also need to move the set tile
10:03 - block into the if else block
10:05 - above so that our brush tile doesn't get
10:08 - messed up
10:10 - oh yay as promised it's testing time run
10:13 - your projects
10:14 - and confirm we can now see a ghosted
10:16 - brush at our mouse cursor
10:18 - pressing the one and two keys also
10:20 - switches the brush visually now which is
10:22 - really nice
10:24 - so i've talked about us hiding the brush
10:26 - when the editor is turned off
10:28 - well how do we turn it off click into
10:31 - the editor sprite and we'll add
10:33 - a when zero key pressed to toggle the
10:35 - level editor
10:36 - for now bring in an if else
10:40 - and check for editor being greater than
10:44 - zero
10:47 - if it is then we set it back to zero
10:51 - otherwise we set it to one easy
10:55 - we won't need to start the level in the
10:56 - editor mode anymore
10:58 - so it's a good time to go back over and
11:00 - set editor to zero in the generate
11:02 - script
11:03 - run the project now you can see that
11:06 - when the project begins
11:07 - i have no ghosted brush and i can
11:09 - confirm clicking on the screen does not
11:11 - paint any blocks
11:12 - so i press the zero key and woo yeah i
11:16 - can lay down some sweet tiles
11:17 - pressing zero again and i'm back into
11:19 - play mode i love it when things all come
11:22 - together so nicely
11:25 - now have you guys heard of god mode
11:28 - not only does it give us the ability to
11:30 - edit the level but also
11:31 - lets us quickly fly around and clip
11:33 - through solid walls
11:35 - it would be really useful to add this to
11:37 - our editor however before we can add
11:39 - more keyboard controlled scripts it
11:42 - would be wise to first revisit our
11:44 - primary control scheme
11:46 - at present we are limited to just using
11:49 - the arrow keys
11:50 - but many scratchers far prefer the wazed
11:52 - or
11:53 - looking forward even mobile controls to
11:56 - cater for this
11:57 - i'm going to suggest we create a new
11:59 - sprite
12:00 - naming it controls
12:05 - we'll add a when i receive block and
12:07 - make a new event named
12:08 - check controls we can use variables to
12:11 - represent the different control inputs
12:13 - we are concerned about
12:15 - so we'll add four new ones all of them
12:17 - for this sprite
12:18 - only we need a left right
12:24 - down up
12:27 - variable set left
12:32 - to key left arrow pressed
12:36 - or key a pressed
12:40 - we do the same for right down and up
12:43 - filling out the letters d s and w
12:52 - next we'll create two new variables
12:53 - named x-axis
12:55 - and y-axis again for this sprite only
12:58 - and use that cool trick of setting
13:01 - x-axis to
13:02 - right subtract left and the y axis
13:06 - to up subtract down
13:09 - great that's all we need in here so
13:12 - click back into our mario sprite
13:14 - so that we can hook it all up look for
13:16 - the define
13:17 - game loop custom block at the top of the
13:20 - forever loop
13:21 - add a broadcast to check controls that
13:24 - will ensure all the control variables
13:26 - are set
13:26 - before the move player and position tile
13:28 - scripts run each frame
13:31 - next find the define handle keys left
13:33 - right script
13:34 - and change the set walk to
13:37 - we need the of block again from here
13:39 - from the sensing category
13:40 - and choose our control sprite and now
13:43 - we'll select the axis
13:44 - x variable the other place that the
13:48 - controls are used
13:49 - is in the handled keys jump custom block
13:52 - here we switch the up
13:53 - key pressed for an up of controls is
13:56 - greater than zero
14:01 - we can run this now and confirm that our
14:03 - controls all still work
14:05 - all available reporters for left right
14:07 - up and down should be triggering
14:08 - and then we can also test for our wazzed
14:10 - keys too
14:11 - as they are also hooked up to the same
14:13 - variables in this control sprite
14:16 - excellent so with new control mechanisms
14:19 - defined
14:20 - let's add the god mode movement scripts
14:23 - find some free space in the mario sprite
14:26 - and make with me a new custom block
14:28 - named
14:28 - handle god mode run without screen
14:31 - refresh
14:32 - now this works just like our original
14:35 - movement scripts before we added gravity
14:38 - first we handle the change in speed from
14:40 - key presses
14:41 - by changing speed x by 6 multiplied by
14:44 - axis x
14:49 - and the same for speed y and axis y
14:53 - next we account for friction to slow us
14:55 - down by setting
14:57 - speed x to 0.7 multiplied by
15:00 - speed x do the same for speed y
15:04 - lastly we actually move the player by
15:06 - changing x by speed x
15:08 - and y by speed y
15:11 - super we just need to make use of the
15:13 - god mode script
15:15 - so scroll up to the when i receive move
15:17 - player script
15:19 - add an if else condition and we'll look
15:21 - for when the level editor is enabled
15:23 - that is
15:23 - editor is greater than zero if it is
15:26 - we trigger the handle god mode block
15:29 - now we always want to move the camera
15:31 - and paint the sprite
15:32 - so these go underneath here leaving the
15:35 - handle keys and move sprite blocks to be
15:37 - run
15:37 - when not in editor mode like this
15:41 - there that's nice and clean and makes
15:43 - sense so
15:44 - let's give it a test to begin with
15:47 - i'm in play mode and can move around as
15:49 - normal
15:50 - let me press the zero key okay now
15:53 - things have changed and as i press the
15:55 - arrow keys or wast
15:57 - i am able to quickly fly around and i'm
15:59 - no longer stopped by the blocks
16:01 - instead i just clip through them that's
16:04 - really good
16:05 - and i can toggle back to normal movement
16:07 - so easily
16:08 - just by pressing the zero key again it's
16:11 - so much easier now to create a level
16:12 - structures without worrying about my
16:14 - player's movement
16:15 - okay i have an announcement to make here
16:18 - if you see my control sprite disappear
16:20 - after this part of the tutorial then
16:22 - please don't panic
16:23 - it's just that i had to go back and
16:25 - re-record that part of the tutorial to
16:27 - improve the design
16:28 - we most certainly want to keep this new
16:30 - sprite so don't go deleting it
16:32 - thank you so next up
16:35 - if i click on the editor sprite see
16:38 - where we are selecting tile costumes
16:40 - under the number keys one and two
16:42 - well only having two sprites to draw
16:44 - this is never gonna cut it
16:46 - we need heaps more than that right
16:49 - problem is
16:50 - we don't have enough keys on the
16:51 - keyboard to map to all the tile costumes
16:54 - we are going to need
16:55 - so we need a better solution if you've
16:58 - used any of the level editors in my
17:00 - scratch games
17:01 - then you probably have seen how i like
17:03 - to categorize the different tile types
17:06 - and assign each category to a key
17:08 - instead
17:09 - then you simply press the key over and
17:11 - over to cycle through the different
17:13 - brushes
17:14 - so let's do that make a new custom block
17:17 - naming it next brush with a text input
17:20 - of
17:21 - key and run without screen refresh
17:24 - we'll replace both the when one and two
17:26 - key pressed hat block scripts with calls
17:28 - to the next brush block
17:30 - and set the input variable to the same
17:32 - number that has been pressed
17:34 - one for key one and two for key two then
17:37 - we'll add
17:37 - two more when key pressed hats for the
17:40 - three and four keys
17:42 - i think four categories will do for
17:43 - starters but we can always add more
17:46 - i think you get the pattern this system
17:48 - to work we need some way of mapping the
17:50 - different level tile costumes to these
17:52 - key numbers
17:53 - the easiest solution is to make a new
17:55 - list named
17:57 - tile key map for this sprite only we
18:00 - will leave the new list visible for now
18:02 - and click into the tile sprite so that
18:04 - we can see the costumes in its costumes
18:06 - tab
18:08 - we are going to add a row in this tile
18:10 - keymap list
18:11 - for each costume in tile sprite and the
18:14 - number we enter will be the key number
18:16 - that we want to assign to it to select
18:18 - it
18:19 - now costume 1 and 2 can't be chosen so
18:21 - we leave two blank rows in the list for
18:23 - them
18:24 - okay costume 3 is a ground tile so we'll
18:27 - assign it a key press of one
18:29 - and looking down the costumes the
18:31 - following costumes are also ground tiles
18:34 - until we reach costume nine so we enter
18:37 - key one all the way down to costume
18:39 - eight
18:41 - costume 9 though is a single block tile
18:43 - so let's assign that to key
18:45 - 2 and the same for costume 10. then
18:48 - looking at costume 11
18:49 - we have yet another tile type this will
18:52 - be a special jump through platform when
18:53 - we add this ability
18:55 - so all the blue tiles can be assigned to
18:57 - key 3
18:58 - all the way down to costume 19. quick
19:01 - tip
19:02 - just ensure to click out of the last row
19:04 - you enter
19:05 - in the list otherwise it can sometimes
19:07 - fail to save the last change you made
19:10 - cool the mappings are all there now in
19:13 - the list so we can click back into the
19:15 - editor sprite
19:17 - so when we press a certain key we want
19:19 - to find the next brush in this list
19:21 - after the currently chosen one that
19:23 - matches the key pressed
19:25 - we only want to look through this list
19:27 - once so add a repeat for length of tile
19:30 - keymap
19:31 - add an if else and we'll check whether
19:34 - the currently selected brush
19:35 - is less than the length of the mapping
19:37 - list
19:38 - if it is then we will add one to it to
19:41 - go on to the next brush in the list
19:43 - otherwise we set it back to the first
19:45 - costume to cycle round again
19:48 - now with an if we check the number
19:50 - entered in the keymap list for the
19:52 - current brush
19:53 - and compare it to the number of the key
19:55 - being pressed
19:56 - if it matches then we found our next
19:58 - brush so simply stop the scripts here
20:01 - otherwise the repeat loop continues
20:03 - around again and the next costume is
20:05 - checked for a match
20:06 - that's it let's test it i click 0 to
20:10 - enter the level editor
20:11 - and now i'm tapping the 1 key over and
20:13 - over this is cycling happily through the
20:15 - floor tiles just as hoped
20:17 - if i tap the 2 key then we should see
20:19 - those two single block tiles
20:22 - and then the 3 key cycles through the
20:23 - blue platform tiles
20:25 - this is awesome loving how it works and
20:28 - so now i can actually begin to choose
20:30 - and create
20:31 - far more interesting levels using the
20:32 - other available blocks
20:34 - you know one more useful editor feature
20:37 - we should add is the eyedropper tool
20:39 - that is where pressing e for eyedropper
20:42 - lets us use the tile
20:43 - under the cursor as the current brush so
20:46 - when e key pressed simply set the chosen
20:49 - brush
20:50 - to tile remember that tile will have
20:52 - been set in this sprite by the previous
20:54 - call to the get tile at xy
20:56 - so that makes it super easy give the
20:59 - project a run and enter the editor
21:01 - now hovering over a beautiful gold block
21:03 - and pressing e changes my current brush
21:05 - into the gold tile
21:06 - nice and pressing e over the corner of
21:09 - this floor tile
21:10 - yep this editor is coming along just
21:12 - great
21:14 - now thank you guys for all the comments
21:15 - you leave me under the videos they are
21:17 - super helpful for directing where this
21:18 - tutorial goes
21:20 - i've been asked a number of times how we
21:22 - can have holes in the floor that the
21:23 - player can actually fall down
21:25 - as you can see that doesn't happen right
21:27 - now and a comment from zukana asked
21:29 - whether
21:30 - we could remove the walls and ceiling
21:32 - too so let's try and address
21:34 - all that now so why don't we fall off
21:37 - the bottom of the level
21:38 - keeping the game running click on the
21:40 - mario sprite and find the define
21:42 - move camera script watch what happens
21:45 - when we temporarily take out the set
21:47 - camera y to 180 block
21:49 - do you remember how our level is
21:51 - actually wrapping around from bottom to
21:53 - top and top to bottom
21:54 - so since the level has a roof we are
21:57 - actually standing on that
21:59 - so i'll put back the block and move to
22:01 - the define get tile at xy script
22:04 - we can wrap the set tile in an if else
22:06 - block
22:07 - checking for a grid y of less than zero
22:10 - then if the tile is below the bottom of
22:12 - the level
22:12 - simply set tile to the empty value
22:15 - otherwise we set it as normal
22:18 - running the project now lets us actually
22:20 - fall into the hole
22:22 - well almost we just need to script what
22:25 - should happen
22:26 - next to mario move into some space and
22:28 - make a new custom block named
22:30 - check around player run without screen
22:33 - refresh
22:36 - and check if y is less than zero
22:41 - if it is then we have fallen off the
22:43 - level and let's just call the reset
22:45 - player script for the time being
22:47 - now we'll use this block in the when i
22:50 - receive
22:50 - move player script dropping in the check
22:53 - around player block
22:55 - just after the move sprite y we can test
22:58 - this quickly
23:00 - yay that's a little better now mario
23:02 - rushes back to his spawn point when he
23:04 - dies
23:05 - that will do just fine for the time
23:07 - being so how do we handle these walls
23:10 - that surround us
23:11 - the truth is we don't actually want the
23:13 - player to be able to walk off the side
23:15 - of the level at all
23:16 - so keeping a wall here to block him is
23:18 - quite useful
23:20 - so how about we do a little trick and
23:22 - just stop the camera from scrolling that
23:24 - far so that the wall
23:25 - is not shown on screen locate the define
23:29 - move camera script create with me a new
23:32 - custom block named
23:34 - limit camera edge x colon
23:37 - adding an input named edge x
23:40 - then a label of edge y colon
23:44 - and another input named edge y
23:47 - run without screen refresh we can move
23:50 - the entirety of the camera fencing
23:52 - scripts
23:53 - that is all four if conditions into the
23:55 - new define block
23:57 - and then we'll call it from where we
23:59 - took them
24:00 - with the values 240 and 180
24:04 - this lets us replace all the 240 180
24:08 - values from the limit camera edge script
24:10 - below with the edgex and edge y input
24:13 - variables
24:14 - like so it's probably a good idea to
24:17 - just test that the camera fencing is
24:19 - still working as before
24:21 - i'll whiz around the entire level and
24:23 - check that it's nicely fenced in on all
24:25 - sides
24:26 - yep still beautiful so this is cool
24:29 - because now we can tweak the fencing
24:31 - based on whether we are editing the
24:33 - level
24:33 - or not use an if else and we'll check
24:36 - for editor being greater than zero
24:40 - duplicate the limit camera edge block
24:43 - into both sides
24:44 - the top one stays the same for when we
24:46 - are editing the level
24:48 - but the bottom one will change the edgex
24:50 - to be 272.
24:53 - that's one block of 32 more than before
24:57 - run the project and right away we'll see
24:59 - that we are missing the left edge of
25:00 - tiles
25:01 - but try walking or jumping that way and
25:03 - we're still prevented from walking off
25:05 - screen
25:06 - that's good now click the zero key to
25:08 - enter the level editor
25:10 - and bing we could see the wall as before
25:13 - now we are in a pretty good place to
25:15 - start playing with designing some levels
25:18 - i really am this fast at laying down a
25:20 - level
25:21 - but you know what before we bring this
25:24 - episode to a close
25:25 - i'd really like just a few more tile
25:27 - types to decorate our level
25:29 - if you began this tutorial more recently
25:32 - then you probably already have lots more
25:33 - tiles in your tile sprite than you've
25:35 - been seeing in this video
25:37 - if so then just bear with me as i show
25:39 - all these amazing scratches at the
25:41 - cutting edge of production
25:43 - how to get the new tiles too so if you
25:45 - only have the 19 tile costumes
25:48 - look under my video again for the link
25:50 - to the resource project
25:51 - or find it on mywithpatch2 account and
25:54 - look inside
25:55 - click on the tile sprite and check out
25:57 - all these new costumes
25:59 - we must have these open up your backpack
26:02 - by clicking on the backpack bar and drag
26:03 - the entire tile sprite in there
26:06 - it'll be faster than dragging the
26:07 - costumes one at a time
26:09 - now go back to your work in progress
26:11 - tile scrolling project
26:12 - and open the backpack the tile sprite
26:14 - should be there
26:15 - so drag it out and drop it into the
26:17 - sprites panel
26:19 - now in the costumes tab scroll down
26:21 - until you can see costume
26:22 - 20. we will now drag each new costume
26:25 - one at a time down into the tiles sprite
26:28 - you may find counting them off as you go
26:29 - helpful 20 21
26:31 - 22 to help you keep track of where
26:34 - you're up to
26:35 - and then feel free to delete this tiles
26:37 - 2 sprite as we're done with it
26:40 - click back into the tile sprite and we
26:42 - can see costumes 20 to 27
26:44 - are all accounted for before we can use
26:47 - these costumes
26:48 - we need to map them to an editor key so
26:51 - click into the editor
26:52 - sprite and make the tiles key map of the
26:54 - list visible
26:55 - then we can revisit the tile sprite
26:57 - costumes for reference
26:59 - now costume 20 is a single tile block so
27:02 - we'll assign it to key
27:03 - two but the following three costumes are
27:05 - actually just animation frames of the
27:08 - previous tile
27:09 - so let's not have those selectable add
27:11 - blank rows for these in the key map
27:14 - the coin at costume 24 is the next
27:16 - interesting tile
27:18 - we'll give that a key binding of four as
27:19 - it's something new a collectible
27:22 - and once more enter blank values for the
27:25 - following three costumes
27:29 - so i'll just nip into the editor sprite
27:31 - to hide the tile keymap list
27:33 - so we can give this a test i enter the
27:35 - level editor
27:36 - and press the 2 key oh yeah that's nice
27:40 - a new block always looks fresh when
27:42 - you've been seeing the same thing for a
27:44 - while
27:44 - now how about pressing 4 yeah cool
27:48 - a nice coin i'll press 0 to test the
27:51 - level
27:56 - you know what that's some clever
27:57 - balancing act sorry to say we are not
27:59 - going to cover collecting coins in this
28:01 - episode
28:02 - however to wrap things up let's at least
28:05 - make these animating tiles
28:07 - animate right click back into the tiles
28:10 - sprite and scroll to the bottom
28:11 - of the when i receive position tile
28:14 - script
28:15 - we'll change the if tile is less than 2
28:17 - to an if else condition
28:21 - and then in the else check for a tile of
28:24 - 20
28:24 - or 24
28:30 - these are the two animating tiles to
28:33 - make them cycle
28:34 - around their four costumes we change
28:36 - tile
28:37 - using the mod 4 operator and in the left
28:41 - we use
28:42 - timer multiplied by 8 which sets the
28:44 - speed of the animation
28:46 - and wrap that in a floor operator to
28:48 - avoid any rounding issues
28:51 - and here comes our final test for this
28:53 - episode i hope it looks good
28:55 - and yes it does the magic of a little
28:57 - animation to bring the level to life
29:00 - and now let your imagination run wild i
29:03 - wonder what level creations you will
29:05 - begin to shape from this episode of the
29:07 - tile scrolling tutorial
29:09 - of course there's still so much more we
29:11 - need to cover
29:12 - the next episode will focus on the level
29:14 - saving and loading scripts
29:16 - we need this before we can add in the
29:18 - collectable scripts because
29:20 - otherwise the very act of collecting
29:21 - coins would be destructively changing
29:23 - our level
29:24 - and then from there perhaps we will move
29:26 - on to adding enemies and player lives
29:28 - oh and so much more i'm really looking
29:31 - forward to reading how you were getting
29:33 - on
29:33 - in the comments let me know if you
29:35 - managed to get your level editors
29:36 - working
