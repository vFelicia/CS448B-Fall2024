00:02 - hello fellow scratchers it's Griff patch
00:05 - here and I'm jumping on to tell you
00:06 - about this idea that's been brewing in
00:08 - my head and it's got me so excited yeah
00:12 - I'm so grateful to all of you who've
00:14 - been following me some for many years
00:17 - now my fellow scratchers loyally
00:19 - watching and commenting on my videos but
00:22 - here's the thing I'd really love to be
00:24 - able to answer more of your questions
00:26 - your requests and share more in the
00:28 - exciting work you've been up to over the
00:31 - years I've realized that YouTube alone
00:33 - is never going to allow me to deliver
00:35 - everything I wanted to offer you and so
00:38 - that got the cogs in my brain turning
00:41 - what we need is a Griff patch Academy a
00:45 - place where we could go deeper unpack
00:48 - those much requested topics you've been
00:50 - asking for a place we can work through
00:52 - our coding problems so that no one is
00:54 - Left Behind a place to Simply have fun
00:57 - together with competitions and some
00:59 - surprise Rises along the way and as a
01:02 - perk a place to access extended and
01:05 - updated Griff patch content not
01:07 - available anywhere else I've got so many
01:10 - ideas bubbling away and I think together
01:13 - we can create something amazing who
01:16 - knows where this could lead and that's
01:18 - what's got me so excited but guys I
01:22 - can't do this alone and I'm going to
01:24 - need your help to craft the best Griff
01:27 - patch experience possible if you loved
01:29 - my YouTube tutorials I'm intending to
01:32 - absolutely blow you away with my Academy
01:35 - I really want you to be a part of this
01:37 - and I've got a very special invitation
01:39 - for you join me on this adventure where
01:42 - we can build something wonderful
01:45 - together to start the ball rolling I've
01:47 - created a wait list sign up page but
01:50 - hold on there I know we scratchers come
01:52 - in all shapes and sizes hailing from all
01:55 - over the world and have a wide range of
01:58 - Ages and skills so so it's really
02:00 - important to me that everybody treats
02:02 - everyone else kindly and we keep one
02:04 - another safe especially online so
02:07 - because of this if you're under 16 I'll
02:09 - need your grownup adult whether that's
02:11 - your mom dad grandparent Cara or
02:13 - Guardian to sign up on your behalf this
02:16 - will give me the chance to share with
