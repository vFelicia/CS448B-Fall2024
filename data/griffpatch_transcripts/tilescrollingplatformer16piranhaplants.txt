00:00 - [Music]
00:02 - hello fellow scratchers this is griff
00:04 - patch i'm sorry that we missed last
00:06 - week's video because i was on holiday
00:08 - and i'm still on my vacations now so
00:10 - this is going to be a short video too
00:12 - i'm going to try and do it in a bit of a
00:14 - truncated format and i'm doing a bit off
00:17 - the cuff so it's not gonna be quite as
00:18 - polished as normal so forgive me for
00:20 - that but off we go today we are gonna
00:23 - add in the piranha plants to the mario
00:25 - tile scrolling platformer if we have a
00:27 - look at the enemy sprite we should find
00:31 - that the
00:32 - here we go the piranha plant is costume
00:34 - number nine so to use the piranha plant
00:37 - in the editor we're gonna have to drag
00:39 - the costume into the tiles sprite
00:43 - okay so in the tile sprite now that has
00:45 - created a costume number 68 great i'm
00:49 - gonna have to map this to an editor key
00:51 - so in the editor
00:54 - numbering its tile 68 in the variables
00:57 - come down
00:58 - and we want tile key map there we go so
01:03 - costume number 68. there we go we've
01:05 - gotta wait for it ready this needs to be
01:07 - a number nine because it's going to be
01:09 - an enemy
01:11 - okay so that straight away if i hide the
01:14 - list we should now be able to run into
01:16 - the editor
01:17 - with the zero key
01:18 - and press the number nine
01:22 - until we see there we go the piranha
01:24 - plant
01:25 - now piranhas usually go up and down
01:27 - inside a pipe key number one is our pipe
01:30 - so let's just add in a pipe here
01:33 - for our piranha plant to go into and
01:35 - then press nine
01:37 - here's the piranha plant and now look
01:40 - this is the first problem we have to
01:41 - solve the piranha plant
01:43 - can't sit directly in the middle of the
01:46 - pipe like we would like
01:48 - so we're gonna have to change the
01:49 - position of this tile to make it look
01:51 - like it's in the middle so to do that we
01:53 - need to move across by half a tile and
01:55 - up by half a tile for this piranha plant
01:58 - i'm going to press a zero key to save
02:00 - the level as i've done it so far so we
02:01 - don't have to unredo that tube again
02:04 - so in the tiles yeah so in this costume
02:07 - editor we need to move the costume we
02:09 - want to move it across by 16 up by 16.
02:11 - but remember that these costumes we've
02:13 - set size to 200 percent so in fact we
02:15 - only need to move it across by eight and
02:18 - up by eight not 16. so zoom right out
02:21 - with the equals there
02:22 - select the whole thing and then using
02:24 - the arrow keys so we can do fine control
02:27 - we click right eight times one two three
02:30 - four five six seven eight and the up key
02:33 - eight times one two three four five six
02:35 - seven eight
02:36 - and then unselect so that i'm hoping
02:39 - will position it perfectly that was the
02:41 - tile sprite we were doing that in
02:44 - so let's come across now
02:46 - press the editor key
02:48 - press the 9 key
02:51 - and
02:53 - there look at that so this is now
02:55 - looking great this will position it
02:56 - perfectly in the middle of the pipe
02:59 - so if i click the left button to lay
03:01 - that down
03:03 - next problem it doesn't appear and that
03:05 - is normal
03:06 - behavior for enemy sprites because we
03:09 - need to do a bit more work to get the
03:10 - enemy sprite working
03:12 - so press the zero key again to save it
03:14 - and we'll exit out and go into the enemy
03:19 - and i'll come into the code
03:22 - and we will get going
03:24 - what we need is the define spawn type
03:27 - custom block
03:29 - so here it is
03:30 - this is where we're defining all of the
03:32 - different types of enemy that we can
03:34 - spawn
03:36 - so we're going to want a new enemy type
03:38 - in here so if i just create some space
03:44 - now remember what number it was i think
03:45 - it was 68 for the piranha plant
03:48 - and the type is
03:50 - piranha
03:52 - costume ah now let's have a look
03:54 - costumes for the actual enemy it's
03:57 - costume number
03:58 - nine
04:00 - so let's pop a nine in there
04:03 - width 16 yep height is double height so
04:07 - 32 because the piranha plant takes up
04:09 - two full height of tiles
04:12 - so that should be enough to at least get
04:14 - the piranha plant appearing on the
04:15 - screen and here we go look at this
04:18 - very good so it's appearing
04:20 - now it's appearing where we actually set
04:22 - the sprite not where we moved it to
04:25 - so we're going to do a little bit more
04:26 - work to get this to appear in the right
04:28 - position too
04:29 - again this one now needs to move across
04:31 - by 16 pixels
04:33 - so what we are going to do is something
04:35 - slightly different to normal rather than
04:37 - doing this in the
04:39 - set type i'm going to use a when i start
04:42 - as clone block
04:44 - so in here we can check
04:47 - whether the type
04:49 - is equal to
04:51 - pirvana
04:53 - like so
04:55 - next we shall change the x position
05:00 - by 16. so this is the x variable rather
05:03 - than position
05:04 - so that should mean it now spawns across
05:07 - by 16 pixels let's run that
05:12 - okay excellent so with this piranha
05:14 - plant centered perfectly on the pipe how
05:16 - about we try and move the piranha down
05:18 - into the pipe a little bit
05:21 - to do that we're going to change y
05:23 - by negative
05:25 - 16. that should move it down just a
05:27 - touch so let's just run that again
05:30 - okay can you spot the problem
05:34 - so upon a plant has moved down but it
05:36 - has not moved into the pipe whatsoever
05:38 - it's positioned right over the top
05:41 - so to fix this we're gonna have to move
05:43 - this behind all of the tiles
05:46 - but careful not to move it behind the
05:48 - background sprite otherwise it'll
05:50 - disappear completely
05:53 - so if we
05:55 - move this to the back layer first
05:59 - as i said this will mean
06:01 - we can no longer see it at all which is
06:03 - no good we need to move it back in front
06:05 - of these sprites so to do that
06:09 - we go
06:10 - forward
06:12 - not by one layer
06:14 - but by the number stored in layers
06:16 - background do you remember this variable
06:18 - we created this to keep a record of how
06:20 - many sprites there were in the
06:21 - background so that we could do it
06:22 - exactly what we're doing now which is to
06:24 - move things back in front of the layer
06:26 - behind so there we go
06:28 - this is now positioned beautifully
06:30 - behind the pipe but in front of the back
06:32 - layers
06:32 - great
06:34 - now one problem that this is going to
06:36 - show up if i go into the level editor
06:40 - this is still positioned down a little
06:42 - bit here and i want this to be
06:44 - positioned where it originally was
06:46 - so to fix that why not surround
06:50 - the change y here
06:52 - with a check to see that we're in the
06:54 - editor or not so if editor
06:56 - is less than one
06:59 - okay so now it's only going to move us
07:00 - down and behind everything if we are in
07:03 - the editor
07:04 - so if i run the game
07:06 - it's behind the pipe press zero and now
07:09 - it's exactly where we positioned it
07:10 - which is above the pipe there
07:12 - super
07:13 - okay so how about next we get this
07:15 - little piranha plant to open and shut
07:16 - his mouth
07:17 - to do that we need to find the move
07:20 - enemy receiver here
07:23 - this deals with all of the movement of
07:25 - our enemy sprites if we scroll down we
07:27 - should find here we go let's do this
07:30 - duplicate this if type equals life
07:34 - okay so what our type is going to be is
07:36 - parana
07:39 - and of course we're not going to take
07:40 - life in here we're going to have a new
07:41 - custom block
07:43 - and let's pop this
07:44 - in the list of these different things
07:46 - that we create
07:47 - so we're going to need a new custom
07:48 - block and we'll call it tick piranha to
07:51 - be consistent
07:55 - like so and run without screen refresh
07:59 - great
08:01 - let's plop this over here
08:04 - and of course we need to make use of it
08:05 - in here so find the tick piranha drop it
08:08 - in there so if tick type equals piranha
08:11 - then tick purana
08:13 - and what we'll do in here
08:16 - oops where am i gone is
08:19 - what are we gonna do let's change the
08:21 - costume so we'll change frame by one
08:24 - because frame will keep track of
08:26 - its animation
08:28 - and we'll set costume
08:31 - do you remember what the first costume
08:33 - number was let's just check again
08:36 - there we go costume number
08:38 - nine so start with costume number nine
08:42 - so we're gonna want two different
08:43 - costume changes if you look at the
08:45 - costumes
08:46 - we've got costume nine and we've got
08:48 - costume 10
08:49 - like so and we want to animate back and
08:51 - forth between the two
08:54 - so to do that we use our
08:56 - friendly mod operator so two frames to
08:59 - animate between
09:01 - and now we're going to use frame in here
09:03 - but we always have a floor
09:07 - a frame
09:09 - divided by and now this is how many
09:11 - frames the animation wants to take
09:13 - before moving on to the next costume and
09:15 - we're gonna have four
09:18 - so pop that into this side of the mod
09:20 - and there you go
09:22 - if we want it to go quicker we can
09:23 - change it four to say a two wow look at
09:26 - that super fast or three
09:29 - no i like four it's good
09:31 - perfect
09:32 - so next up how about getting this little
09:35 - guy to move up and down well obviously
09:37 - we can put a change y in here and just
09:39 - drop it in here and whoo up it goes
09:42 - and minus one
09:43 - goes back down
09:47 - and back up
09:48 - okay stop that
09:50 - so up and down's easy peasy how are we
09:52 - going to make it go up and down when we
09:54 - want it to go up and down
09:57 - what we'll do is a technique very
09:59 - similar to what we've done with this
10:00 - costume here because the up and down
10:02 - motion will be on a cycling loop
10:05 - um the only difference is we want it to
10:07 - stay still for a bit then move up stay
10:10 - still and move down
10:12 - so
10:13 - let's use the temp variable that just
10:15 - means temporary i use that for a lot of
10:17 - things
10:18 - so set temp 2
10:20 - and we'll use mod again
10:22 - and i'm going to have eight stages of
10:25 - movement um i'll show you a little bit
10:27 - more in the detail in a second
10:29 - and on the left we're going to use a
10:31 - divide
10:32 - and we're going to have frame again
10:35 - and now this number this is how many
10:39 - frames it does something for so what
10:41 - we're going to do is we're going to move
10:42 - them move the piranha plant up for 16
10:45 - frames and down for 16 frames so we're
10:48 - going to divide by 16 here to keep track
10:50 - of how many frames it moves for
10:53 - okay so let's try and use this
10:57 - what it means i should be able to do
10:59 - is compare
11:01 - frame to something
11:03 - but i'm going to use the floor of frame
11:06 - because i didn't use a floor in here
11:08 - like i would in the costume
11:11 - so floor frame equals now this number
11:14 - frame uh oh no beg your pardon beg your
11:17 - pardon temp
11:19 - flaw of temp
11:21 - so temp will go from zero up to seven
11:24 - because i'm modding it by eight and it
11:25 - will repeat and go from zero to seven
11:27 - again and it stays on a number
11:29 - for 16 frames
11:32 - so when
11:33 - temp
11:34 - reaches 4
11:35 - i'm going to change my y to make it move
11:38 - upwards
11:39 - and i'm going to move it up by 4 pixels
11:41 - at a time
11:43 - okay
11:44 - so if i do 16 times four
11:46 - that will move it up by 64 which is the
11:49 - full height of the enemy
11:52 - if i run that
11:55 - okay so that now moves up by 64 pixels
11:59 - every now and again which is fine
12:01 - because we're going to move it down
12:02 - again otherwise it looks a bit silly
12:04 - so duplicate that and on number seven we
12:08 - shall move down by -4
12:12 - so let's run that
12:15 - okay it goes up and it goes down
12:18 - and it goes up
12:20 - and then it goes down so this is almost
12:21 - working we just need to make sure that
12:23 - it is behind the pipe completely when it
12:25 - starts
12:26 - now it's not quite evenly timed so this
12:29 - is now moving up
12:31 - and then down
12:33 - but it stays down for longer than it
12:35 - stays up
12:36 - that's because i've used four and seven
12:38 - i've had that as a three instead
12:41 - it would now move up and down equally
12:43 - spaced
12:46 - and if i was this is much lower it would
12:48 - then go up and wait
12:50 - oh i've done bad timing there something
12:52 - went again
12:54 - now it'll stay up for a longer than it
12:57 - stays down
12:59 - see that
13:01 - but four is good for me i want it to
13:03 - stay down for a little bit longer to
13:05 - give the player a bit more time
13:07 - so now if we want this now to appear
13:09 - right behind the pipe we're gonna have
13:11 - to go to the when i start as a clone
13:13 - again
13:15 - and now i'm moving down by -16 i need to
13:17 - move down by minus 64 to get right
13:20 - behind the pipe
13:22 - let's run that
13:25 - there we go
13:28 - excellent so this is looking really good
13:30 - now so i can imagine playing this game
13:32 - quite happily any problem is so i'm
13:35 - completely invulnerable to this guy at
13:37 - the moment so i need to add in mario's
13:39 - death here
13:40 - so let's see how about doing that so
13:42 - back to the tick
13:44 - provana script
13:47 - let's put this at the bottom of this
13:49 - script here we'll have an if
13:51 - touching
13:52 - mario
13:54 - and then we broadcast the mario lose
13:57 - life now that's pretty standard
14:00 - so i assume that'll work straight away
14:01 - let's just see
14:03 - yep
14:05 - that does him in well and truly
14:07 - but there is one slight problem here let
14:09 - me show you it to you
14:11 - yep i die even when the plant is down
14:14 - now why is that listen to the level
14:17 - editor here
14:18 - the reason that we're having that
14:19 - problem
14:20 - is that even when mario is just standing
14:23 - on top of this pipe
14:25 - the plant
14:26 - is just here and he is actually even
14:29 - though he's hidden he's just just just
14:32 - touching mario's foot which kills him so
14:34 - that's no use so how about instead we
14:37 - have a bit of a check to make sure that
14:38 - the plant is up or down before we kill
14:40 - mario
14:42 - so let's put an if
14:45 - around this here to stop it from
14:48 - triggering under certain conditions
14:51 - and what i should say is
14:54 - i shall check this temp
14:57 - variable
14:59 - because i know the plant is not moving
15:01 - up unless temp reaches the 4 value
15:05 - but i'm not going to say 4 what i'm
15:06 - going to do is
15:07 - 4.2 something slightly bigger now this
15:10 - is why i didn't put the floor in the
15:13 - original assignment up here because i
15:15 - wanted to make sure that temp could be a
15:18 - value with a decimal place
15:20 - now what this means is if i run the
15:22 - project
15:25 - if i stand on top of here
15:27 - like this
15:28 - now did you see that
15:30 - the plant was allowed to come up just a
15:32 - little bit before it killed me
15:34 - if i hadn't put that point two it would
15:36 - have killed me as soon as it popped up
15:38 - slightly and you wouldn't be able to see
15:39 - the plant and that would be a little bit
15:40 - unfair
15:43 - so are we there let me just press the
15:44 - zero key yep so the plant is appearing
15:47 - correctly
15:48 - and when i press zero again it
15:50 - disappears
15:51 - and it starts its little root that's
15:53 - really really good
15:56 - yeah
15:58 - i think we've got it
15:59 - okay well it's great to have more
16:01 - enemies in this game now than just the
16:03 - gumbas piranha plants are a absolute
16:05 - vital part of mario
16:07 - next up perhaps would be the koopas
16:10 - now you might be able to find that you
16:11 - can start doing the koopas yourself
16:13 - based off the same code as the gumbas in
16:15 - fact you can use the same gumbo walking
16:18 - code that gumball uses what is a little
16:20 - bit more tricky is the cooper shells now
16:22 - that's been driving me a little bit more
16:24 - trying to work out the best way to show
16:25 - you how to do that but i won't believe
16:27 - it this time i'm sorry
16:29 - and that then will be the end of the
16:30 - video i look forward to seeing you again
16:32 - next time if you like this video then
