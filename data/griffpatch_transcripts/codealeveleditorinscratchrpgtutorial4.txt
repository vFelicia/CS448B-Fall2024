00:00 - foreign
00:03 - scratchers I simply love level editors
00:06 - almost every game I've created has a
00:09 - level editor built in somewhere there's
00:11 - Apple eat the level paper Minecraft well
00:14 - the whole game is a level letter to the
00:16 - right but even my 3D laser tag game has
00:19 - an editor hidden away inside so it's no
00:22 - surprise that our scratch RPG is to
00:24 - feature one two without it designing
00:27 - large epic levels would be so very hard
00:30 - yes we've got loads of cool stuff to
00:33 - learn but in this episode we'll include
00:35 - using the pen to paint a Nifty split
00:38 - screen user interface this is looking so
00:41 - good right snapping to the level Grid
00:43 - and calculating the exactile under the
00:45 - mouse cursor displaying a ghosted copy
00:48 - of the active tile brush that's the one
00:50 - we selected to paint with and then we'll
00:52 - cover placing or painting new tiles
00:54 - within our levels so do stick around
00:57 - until the end of this video to see all
00:59 - this and more but enough talk guys let's
01:04 - get scratching
01:06 - load up your projects from episode three
01:08 - yeah looking great
01:10 - and so as not to lose all our epic
01:13 - progress we should begin by Saving this
01:15 - as a new copy for this is RPG tutorial
01:19 - episode 4. oh yes this is going to be
01:23 - fun the first thing we want is a way to
01:26 - toggle our level editor on and off and
01:29 - since the editor will need access to all
01:31 - the tile costumes we'll click into the
01:33 - tile Sprite for this
01:35 - when zero key pressed I often use the
01:38 - zero key to toggle My Level editors if
01:40 - you don't want every user to have access
01:42 - then you can either remove this script
01:44 - later on or you could add a user name
01:47 - check so only you can access it
01:49 - now an if else
01:51 - and drop in a greater than operator we
01:55 - need a new variable to keep track of
01:56 - whether we are editing the level or not
01:59 - let's name it editor for all Sprites
02:03 - now when editor is greater than zero we
02:07 - are editing the level
02:08 - so to toggle the editor off set editor
02:11 - back to zero
02:13 - else we are not editing so set editor to
02:17 - 1 to toggle it back on again we can just
02:20 - test that by tapping the zero key and we
02:22 - should find the editor variable happily
02:24 - switches between 0 and 1.
02:28 - as an enhancement let's hide the editor
02:30 - variable when the editor is not enabled
02:32 - hide variable editor and conversely show
02:37 - variable editor when it's active nice
02:41 - that works well
02:43 - so all the level editing scripts need to
02:45 - hang off somewhere so find the when I
02:47 - receive paint background script
02:50 - we'll paint the user interface after we
02:53 - paint the background but only if the
02:55 - editor is enabled if editor is greater
02:58 - than zero then we'll make a new custom
03:01 - block for this naming it
03:04 - paint editor and run without screen
03:07 - refresh
03:08 - as with the painting of the level tiles
03:10 - these scripts must run very fast within
03:13 - one game tick pop that into some free
03:15 - space and will make use of the new block
03:17 - right away when the editor is enabled
03:20 - here
03:21 - Splendid are you ready to rock the first
03:24 - thing we'll do is highlight the tile
03:26 - under the mouse cursor if you take a
03:28 - peek in our costumes you'll see costume
03:30 - 2 named outline is designed for this
03:33 - purpose I drew this to perfectly
03:35 - surround our 16 by 16 tiles hence it's
03:38 - 18 by 18.
03:41 - so for starters try switching to the
03:43 - outline costume
03:45 - and simply going to the mouse pointer
03:48 - then because we are not using clones
03:51 - stamp the outline costume right here
03:55 - great tap the green flag and check out
03:57 - what we have accomplished
03:59 - a very pretty cursor outline that
04:01 - follows the mouse but what's wrong with
04:04 - this is that we really want the outline
04:06 - to be snapping to the underlying tile
04:08 - grid not smoothly gliding around like
04:10 - this
04:11 - well then we need to know which grid
04:14 - cell the mouse is over the trick to
04:16 - remember is that we are viewing only a
04:18 - small window into our larger world map
04:20 - to get our Mouse position in World
04:22 - coordinates we must factor in Chemex and
04:25 - cam y so for the time being move these
04:29 - painting scripts over to the right and
04:31 - now in our variables we already have a
04:33 - GX and gy variable we can use these
04:36 - these stand for grid X and grid y so
04:38 - make them visible on the stage while we
04:40 - work this through
04:42 - set GX to and we'll sum Mouse X
04:48 - with kamex
04:50 - if we run the project you'll find this
04:52 - usefully now shows GX is 0 at the far
04:55 - left of the map rather than the negative
04:57 - 240 we are used to the player is at 240
05:01 - and as we walk to the right GX gets
05:03 - bigger and bigger which is just what
05:05 - we'd expect
05:06 - but to find out how many tiles across we
05:09 - have gone rather than pixels we need to
05:12 - divide this by the tile width that's
05:14 - right divide the whole thing by 32.
05:18 - of course as often is the case after
05:20 - dividing we are left with a fractional
05:22 - number and that should be cleaned up
05:23 - using a floor operator to round the
05:26 - number down
05:27 - carefully drop the entire expression
05:29 - into the floor
05:30 - and now beginning at zero we have a
05:32 - beautiful readout of how many tiles
05:34 - across the level Grid the mouse cursor
05:36 - is positioned
05:37 - let's do the same for up and down
05:40 - setting gy this time
05:43 - and we swap Mouse X for Mouse y
05:47 - and Chemex for cam y
05:52 - and there we go as you might imagine
05:55 - this GX gy grid location will be super
05:58 - useful going forwards
06:00 - now that we know the grid location of
06:03 - the mouse let's use it to snap that
06:05 - outline to the tile grid before we
06:07 - display it set X to
06:10 - we need to multiply the grid X backup by
06:12 - 32 our tile width to find its position
06:15 - on the full map
06:17 - then to position it relative to our
06:19 - camera we subtract kamex
06:23 - but one last week we add half a tile
06:26 - width 16 to account for the centering of
06:28 - our costumes
06:31 - we now do the same for this set why
06:38 - only with the gy variable
06:40 - and the cam y available
06:42 - cool that's the positioning we just need
06:45 - to bring back the switch costume to
06:47 - outline and the stamp block
06:49 - make sure to remember to remove that go
06:51 - to Mouse pointer now we must leave that
06:53 - in guys it's time to smash that green
06:56 - flag will the outline snap to the grid
06:59 - oh boy yes that's much better and
07:03 - importantly if we Edge the player along
07:05 - the grid snapping perfectly follows us
07:08 - and isn't fooled by the camera offset no
07:10 - sorry there's something very satisfying
07:13 - about walking around with the grid
07:15 - aligned cursor very professional indeed
07:17 - next up we want to get level editing and
07:20 - place down some new tiles
07:23 - if
07:24 - Mouse down
07:26 - then
07:28 - now we want to replace the existing tile
07:30 - under the mouse with a new tile so we
07:33 - use the replace item of grid block
07:37 - we need to choose what tile costume we
07:39 - are placing something a bit fun
07:42 - um uh ah yes 118 this big Stone
07:46 - so replace item of grid with the tile
07:48 - costume 118 118.
07:52 - but which item of grid we have the grid
07:55 - X in Grid y but not the grid index yet
07:58 - and that's what we need so we need to
08:00 - calculate that set G idx grid x 2 and do
08:05 - you remember this calculation the first
08:06 - item is a one and then we sum this with
08:10 - g x our grid X now that is how many
08:13 - tiles across the grid we need then to
08:16 - add the vertical we need to add and for
08:19 - this we need a multiply block because
08:21 - for every tile up the grid g y we need
08:24 - to multiply by G Max the number of tiles
08:27 - in a row
08:29 - great so sum them both together and that
08:32 - gives us the grid index gidx and now we
08:35 - can drop that happily into the replace
08:37 - item block here
08:38 - well this is exciting smash that green
08:41 - flag and it's time to get clicking ah if
08:45 - everything has gone well then we should
08:47 - have placed our first tile and the first
08:49 - of many I can assure you we can make
08:52 - some pretty cool looking Walls by just
08:54 - clicking and dragging in straight lines
08:56 - oh yeah right I'm getting carried away
08:59 - though and before you go to town making
09:01 - some Ultra snazzy maze don't forget that
09:04 - as soon as we hit the green flag boom
09:06 - our beautiful creation is gone because
09:09 - the level resets
09:11 - so before we get around to adding level
09:14 - saving and loading the best option would
09:16 - be to click into the level store Sprite
09:18 - and simply separate off the new map
09:21 - block from the when I receive load scene
09:24 - this means that when we run the project
09:26 - and lay down some funky level the next
09:29 - time the project is run our level stays
09:31 - just as it was wonderful
09:35 - of course there are times when you may
09:37 - still want to reset the level and then
09:40 - well just pop into this Sprite and click
09:42 - the new level block and the level resets
09:46 - Okay click back into the tile Sprite
09:50 - let's expand things so that we can place
09:52 - other types of tile other than just this
09:55 - stone block
09:56 - so in place of the costume number 118 we
10:00 - need a new variable
10:02 - rush for this Sprite only
10:05 - and for fun we can begin by making it a
10:08 - slider setting its range from 20 the
10:12 - first actual tile costume up to say 200
10:16 - for now although we have a lot more I
10:18 - know
10:19 - I can then drag that to the first tile
10:22 - 20. and we drop the brush variable in
10:25 - place of the number 118. cool let's see
10:28 - that in action click click and there is
10:32 - costume 20. let's try another brush tile
10:35 - 77 oh the grass of course one one six oh
10:40 - nice that's a fence yeah so there are
10:42 - loads of interesting tiles to be
10:44 - explored but a lot of them are hard to
10:47 - understand out of context
10:49 - and wouldn't it be nice to see what tile
10:51 - we're going to place before we actually
10:54 - start painting with it well not a
10:57 - problem come back up here to where we
10:59 - switch to the outline costume duplicate
11:02 - both the switch costume and the stamp
11:04 - block and to show the brush tile before
11:07 - we actually place it simply switch to
11:10 - the costume given by the brush variable
11:12 - and now we can stamp it in place just
11:14 - like that
11:15 - however it can be nice to just fade the
11:19 - tile out a little bit so set ghost
11:21 - effect
11:24 - to 25 before we stamp
11:28 - then we must remember to turn off that
11:30 - effect before continuing so drop in a
11:33 - clear graphic effect block before
11:35 - switching back to the outline costume
11:37 - and it's testing time so do you see how
11:41 - we have a faded version of the brush
11:43 - tile appearing at our cursor that is
11:46 - sweet and when we click the tile becomes
11:49 - fully solid wow we are making progress
11:52 - are you enjoying this you know what
11:54 - though a feature I often add to my
11:56 - editors is the tile picker key that is
11:59 - when you press e over an existing tile
12:01 - it selects that as the current brush and
12:03 - we can paint with it
12:05 - we can do this simply by adding to the
12:07 - bottom of the same paint editor script
12:10 - if
12:11 - e key is pressed
12:16 - then we set the brush to
12:18 - well the tile under the mouse so item of
12:22 - grid and we want the grid index again
12:26 - gidx but watch out this won't work yet
12:30 - because if you look we are only setting
12:33 - G idx when the mouse is pressed above
12:36 - here we need to move this set gidx out
12:39 - of there moving it up to a more suitable
12:42 - position under the set GX and gy blocks
12:45 - here that keeps all those all nicely
12:47 - together
12:49 - and now running the project we can
12:52 - finally press e over an existing tile
12:55 - and switch quickly to that matching
12:57 - brush to continue painting I love that
13:00 - feature
13:00 - also note this is the fastest way to
13:03 - remove existing tiles pressing e over
13:06 - the grass and you will find you can then
13:08 - paint over any tile to remove it very
13:11 - useful
13:12 - but it's still a real pain trying to
13:15 - find any other tile you are after just
13:17 - using the brush slide available so we
13:20 - are going to Now work on that awesome
13:22 - tile selection palette let's scroll back
13:26 - to the when I receive paint background
13:28 - receiver so as well as painting the
13:30 - paint editor we'll split the palette
13:33 - into its own custom block paint palette
13:38 - run without screen refresh
13:42 - drop that in right after the paint
13:44 - editor
13:46 - let's find some free space for this
13:49 - okay we'll start by painting a black
13:51 - rectangle to act as a background to our
13:54 - palette
13:55 - we'll need to know how wide to draw it
13:58 - so make a new variable palette width or
14:02 - Pal width for short for this Sprite only
14:05 - and set pal width to
14:09 - then we use a multiply so you can say
14:12 - that the palette is five tiles wide and
14:15 - multiply that by 32 of course
14:17 - but we also want a small border around
14:20 - the whole palette area so add to this
14:22 - eight more pixels that's four for each
14:25 - side we'll use the pen to draw a thick
14:28 - line
14:28 - so begin by setting the pen size to the
14:31 - width of our palette pal width
14:34 - then position it using a go to XY block
14:38 - beginning at the top of the screen
14:40 - that's 180.
14:43 - the X position that wants to be halfway
14:46 - between the left Edge and the right edge
14:48 - of the pallet
14:50 - start at the right 240 and subtract half
14:55 - the palette width that's pal width
14:57 - divided by two
14:59 - we can check this looks right by from
15:02 - the pen category set pen color to and
15:05 - choose black
15:06 - then use a pen down block and right away
15:09 - a pen up block if you run that you
15:13 - should find we have stamped a large pen
15:15 - Circle right here at the top right of
15:17 - the screen positioned perfectly for
15:19 - drawing a thick line down the full right
15:21 - edge of the screen
15:23 - shall we do that then drop in a set Y2
15:26 - just before we pen up again
15:29 - setting y to negative 180 the bottom of
15:33 - the screen and did you see that drop
15:35 - down brilliant
15:37 - hey do you notice though that with this
15:40 - right hand panel in place the game world
15:43 - no longer feels correctly centered on
15:45 - the player what's more if we Dash over
15:47 - to the far right of the map it can take
15:49 - a while the level fencing is also broken
15:52 - now in that the rightmost edge of the
15:54 - level is obscured by the palette area
15:57 - that's a shame let's fix this click into
16:01 - the player Sprite
16:03 - oh gosh you know what before we fix the
16:05 - camera fencing can we just fix this
16:07 - other highly reported issue you know
16:10 - when the project starts the player can
16:12 - flick from facing forwards to facing in
16:14 - any other direction well this is so easy
16:16 - to address the problem is that we didn't
16:18 - initialize the player der variable
16:21 - player Direction when we set the player
16:23 - X and Y so set player der to 180. that's
16:28 - facing forwards bug squashed Now find
16:33 - the when I receive tick player script
16:35 - everything from the setcam X block
16:38 - onwards is to do with positioning and
16:40 - fencing the camera so we'll split this
16:43 - off and make a new custom block for it
16:46 - name the block move camera and run
16:49 - without screen refresh
16:51 - all these scripts can be popped into the
16:53 - Define block and the move camera block
16:55 - placed from where they came
16:57 - but we are going to want to change the
16:59 - camera positioning based on whether we
17:01 - are editing the level or not
17:05 - so using an if else block check if
17:09 - editor is equal to one okay just to be
17:13 - clear here I am using equals rather than
17:15 - the greater than that I usually use as
17:18 - I'm reserving an editor value of 2 to
17:20 - mean full screen editing but we'll come
17:23 - to that later on
17:25 - next up make a new variable TMP for this
17:28 - Sprite only we use this to store any
17:31 - temporary variable we might need for
17:33 - intermediate calculations
17:35 - and in this case when we are in the
17:38 - editor set TMP to the width of this
17:41 - palette
17:42 - to get that from the sensing category we
17:45 - need the thing of thing block
17:48 - we first switch it from stage to our
17:51 - tile Sprite and then and only then can
17:54 - we find the variable named pal width yep
17:57 - the palette width this is a great block
18:00 - for getting values from other Sprites
18:02 - but it's not good for changing values
18:04 - but that's fine because we don't need to
18:06 - do that here
18:07 - in the else set temp to zero this means
18:12 - the panel is closed and has no width
18:14 - when the editor is not on
18:16 - so first off to Center the player
18:18 - correctly when the panel is open we need
18:21 - to scroll the level over to the right by
18:23 - half the panel width
18:25 - where we previously set cam X we now sum
18:28 - player x with
18:30 - TMP divided by two half the palette
18:34 - width
18:35 - if it's open otherwise TMP is zero and
18:38 - this will make no difference test that
18:41 - out
18:42 - and you can see we are positioned smack
18:45 - bang in the center that's looking smart
18:48 - hit that zero key and ensure the
18:50 - position keeps toggling back to the
18:52 - center of each view that's so cool
18:55 - now though for the other fencing problem
18:58 - right over here to the right
19:02 - what you should see is that we will need
19:04 - to allow the camera to scroll over by an
19:07 - extra full panel width if you move down
19:10 - in the code this is the right hand
19:12 - fencing Chemex greater than
19:15 - and we have a long-ish expression we are
19:18 - comparing to
19:19 - we need to add to this the variable TMP
19:22 - but rather than doing that twice let's
19:25 - instead put a change TMP block before
19:28 - that if check and drop in the gmax
19:31 - expression instead
19:34 - this has the effect of summing the two
19:36 - values and storing them in TMP so now we
19:39 - can simply replace both those longer
19:41 - expressions with TMP itself
19:44 - and there we go the proof is in the
19:47 - pudding and this is a rather yummy slice
19:49 - of said dessert it works splendidly in
19:51 - both editor and non-editor modes so good
19:55 - so with all that resolved we can move on
19:58 - to adding some content to our so-called
20:00 - tile palette click into the tile Sprite
20:03 - and we'll continue to work on the Define
20:04 - paint palette script
20:07 - I'm going to use the G idx variable to
20:09 - represent the palette's grid of tiles
20:11 - setting gidx to 20. that's the first
20:14 - tile costume
20:16 - now to position the first tile set y to
20:19 - 180 that's the top of the screen and we
20:22 - move down by subtracting 16 from that
20:25 - that's half a tile downwards plus four
20:29 - the small border around our tile palette
20:33 - next for the X position set the X2 and
20:37 - working back from the right of the
20:39 - screen
20:40 - 240 subtract pal width and to this we
20:45 - add the same half tile and border
20:49 - 16 plus 4.
20:51 - and now we can switch costume to the
20:53 - variable G idx
20:57 - and yep stamp
21:00 - few after all that slap the green flag
21:03 - and see if we got the maths just right
21:06 - if you did you should find that the
21:09 - first tile costume has appeared
21:10 - majestically in the top left corner of
21:12 - the tile palette yay that was the hard
21:15 - work done to extend this out just drop
21:18 - our repeat loop around the last switch
21:20 - costume and stamp repeating for the five
21:22 - tiles wide we said we'd include
21:25 - then we just need to change gidx by 1 to
21:28 - proceed onto the next costume
21:31 - and change X by 32. can I assume you
21:35 - know that's the tile width by now
21:37 - run the project now that is great can
21:41 - you appreciate the nice four pixel
21:43 - border we accounted for in our maths
21:45 - that is working a treat
21:48 - next up we'll extend this tile palette
21:50 - downwards too so another repeat block
21:53 - this time between the set Y and the set
21:55 - X surrounding everything below you'll
21:59 - find we can support a palette of exactly
22:01 - 11 tiles high so repeat 11.
22:05 - after each row is completed we need to
22:07 - add a change y by negative 32 yes
22:10 - negative as we need to move to the row
22:13 - below it you'll note that we reset the X
22:15 - position before continuing to paint the
22:18 - next row
22:19 - run that now
22:21 - and yeah this is not bad 11 tiles High
22:25 - fits perfectly right
22:27 - the only problem we have is that the
22:29 - tiles are looking like a little bit of a
22:31 - jumble if we look at the original Sprite
22:33 - sheet that these were split out from you
22:35 - can see that the layout is actually
22:37 - really helpful in making sense of the
22:40 - tiles we want to maintain this layout so
22:43 - in the same way we created the viewport
22:45 - for the game map we need to add a tile
22:48 - skip after each row ends to move us on
22:52 - to the correct costume for the next row
22:54 - below
22:56 - before we change y then drop in a change
22:59 - gidx and the amount we skip is one row
23:03 - of tiles from the Sprite sheet this is
23:05 - 18 for me but we then have to subtract
23:08 - from this the number of tiles already
23:10 - painted and that was five
23:13 - cool and there you go the tile palette
23:16 - is suddenly looking rather awesome
23:17 - indeed
23:19 - but grant me this one more Liberty the
23:22 - black background to the palette is a
23:23 - little bit severe and typically the area
23:25 - behind irregular shaped costumes is
23:28 - often shown using a light gray and white
23:31 - grid like the one you see in the costume
23:33 - designer it just so happens I have
23:35 - created one such costume just for this
23:38 - purpose costume number three named mask
23:42 - all we need to do is stamp this behind
23:45 - each other costume in the palette so
23:48 - duplicate the switch costume and stamp
23:50 - changing this time to the mask costume
23:53 - and then pop it back in before the other
23:56 - costume is stamped run that now and haha
23:59 - that's sweet perfectly aligned fit or
24:02 - purpose you can see how well using the
24:05 - Sprite stamping is helping us stay fully
24:08 - in control of our project and can
24:10 - quickly make some crazy cool effects
24:12 - that would otherwise require a lot more
24:14 - work and expensive clones okay so I'm
24:18 - currently painting with this flowery
24:20 - bush costume but although I can see the
24:22 - same costume in the palette on the right
24:24 - it's not indicated that this is the
24:26 - selected tile shall we fix that now
24:29 - start by dropping an if Block in after
24:32 - stamping the palette Sprite and check
24:34 - whether this was the active brush or not
24:36 - that is when G idx is equal to
24:41 - brush
24:43 - and then we just stamp the selection
24:45 - costume over the top
24:48 - switching to that outline Sprite and
24:52 - stamping
24:53 - but if we run that you'll see we have a
24:56 - problem yes it does highlight the
24:58 - selected brush and we can change brush
25:00 - using the slider and see the selection
25:02 - change but the outline is not fully
25:05 - drawing only the top left of it do you
25:08 - know why it's because of the order we
25:11 - are painting the tiles in the palette we
25:13 - draw the first tile then the outline if
25:16 - it's selected and then we go on to paint
25:18 - the next tile and this overwrites the
25:21 - edge of the outline and the same happens
25:24 - below to fix this we need to paint the
25:27 - outline last after all the palette tiles
25:30 - are painted
25:31 - so drag out those painting blocks and
25:33 - instead we'll make a record of the
25:35 - position of the selected tile for
25:37 - painting later
25:38 - we'll use that GX available so set GX to
25:42 - the X position
25:45 - and gy2
25:47 - the Y position
25:49 - but in case we don't find the selected
25:52 - brush and set GX we'll also need to set
25:54 - GX right up here before we begin the
25:57 - loops and we set it to the empty value
26:00 - got that
26:01 - good so back down to the bottom of the
26:04 - script
26:06 - now we can check if
26:09 - GX is greater than
26:15 - the empty value this is only the case if
26:18 - we did find the tile so simply go to x y
26:23 - popping in our recorded GX and gy and
26:27 - then switch to and stamp the outline
26:30 - costume
26:31 - wow well that should do it running the
26:34 - project now and yes yes it does the
26:37 - outline is painted fully on top of the
26:39 - other tiles
26:41 - well we're running out of time for this
26:44 - episode but it wouldn't be right to
26:46 - conclude before we've added in code to
26:48 - actually select a tile from the palette
26:50 - will it now since we are stamping a full
26:53 - Square mask behind each tile we can
26:56 - simply use a touching Mouse pointer for
26:58 - this
26:59 - if and we'll pop it just below the first
27:02 - stamp block
27:03 - and we'll need an and operator so that
27:06 - we can check both when the mouse button
27:08 - is down
27:10 - and when the Sprite is touching the
27:13 - mouse pointer
27:15 - and if that is the case then we just
27:17 - need to set the brush to G idx the
27:21 - currently painted palette tile
27:24 - let's check this out
27:27 - so on first impression this is doing
27:30 - exactly what we want clicking on a tile
27:32 - on the palette selects it and we can
27:34 - paint with it as we like
27:38 - well what could possibly be wrong with
27:40 - that it seems to be working perfectly
27:42 - right
27:43 - hide the editor palette and you'll see
27:46 - do you remember us painting any of this
27:48 - over here if not then how did it get
27:51 - here
27:52 - let me give you a clue in some free
27:55 - space open the editor and click on the
27:57 - Flower Rock and tree stumps and then
28:00 - walk across and oh no do you see what's
28:04 - happened every time we selected a tile
28:06 - from the palette it also gets painted to
28:09 - the level behind the palette at the same
28:11 - time what a disastrous bug and
28:15 - no no stop it there's no way we are
28:20 - leaving this until next time come on now
28:23 - can you find with me the Define paint
28:25 - editor script this is where we position
28:29 - the mouse on the grid and replace tiles
28:31 - when the mouse is pressed this needs to
28:34 - be fully disabled when the mouse is over
28:36 - the pallet so separate off all these
28:39 - scripts and we'll check if
28:42 - Mouse X is greater than
28:47 - and we want the left edge of the palette
28:49 - so that's 240 subtract
28:52 - pal width
28:57 - if this is the case then we can stop
28:58 - this script
29:02 - you can see it works when the outline
29:04 - costume stops painting as we move over
29:06 - the palette here very neat and if we
29:10 - click around on the palette then if all
29:12 - is well no tile will be painting behind
29:15 - nope that's perfect the only thing I
29:18 - might add is it's often nice to leave a
29:21 - little room for errors so when detecting
29:23 - this palette Edge I'd be tempted to
29:25 - change it to 230 instead giving a 10
29:28 - pixel Dead Zone but that's completely up
29:31 - to you wonderful you know I think we are
29:35 - there not that we haven't got plenty
29:38 - more features to cover I'm very aware
29:40 - that we can't yet scroll our palette
29:42 - area to access the masses of extra
29:43 - costumes available to us this will cover
29:46 - in the next episode along with adding
29:49 - the exciting palette tile tracing
29:51 - feature that allows us to lay down large
29:53 - runs of connected tiles far more quickly
29:55 - I love that feature with luck we'll also
29:59 - be able to expand our levels to feature
30:00 - not one not two but three layers of
30:03 - tiles so that we can experiment with
30:05 - layering tiles in front of the player as
30:08 - well as behind them for a more immersive
30:10 - experience
30:12 - wow guys I put a lot of effort into
30:15 - making these videos the best I possibly
