00:00 - [Music]
00:03 - hello fellow scratchers
00:04 - i'm griff patch and welcome back to a
00:06 - very exciting part 11 of our series
00:08 - creating a tiled scrolling platformer in
00:10 - scratch
00:11 - today we'll be focusing on death
00:14 - backgrounds and
00:15 - sound quite a mix and welcome additions
00:17 - to our game engine
00:19 - so are you ready great so here we oh
00:22 - stop stop
00:23 - sorry we have some bug fixes to squash
00:26 - first
00:26 - okay you will probably already have
00:28 - fixed this one wowzers how
00:30 - did i not see this one the first time
00:31 - around look at those coins fly
00:34 - i'm naming this the coin fountain bug
00:37 - still
00:37 - it's a good example of what our particle
00:39 - scripts are capable of
00:41 - a mistake is in the tile sprite within
00:43 - the when i receive position tile script
00:46 - this is where we are checking whether a
00:48 - tile has been bumped by mario's head
00:51 - but it just so happens that our editor
00:52 - brush the one we drew within the level
00:55 - editor
00:55 - has a tile index of blank which is the
00:58 - same
00:58 - as no bump so this is always spawning
01:02 - coins as if we were bumping
01:04 - we could fix this in a number of ways
01:06 - but we'll just make sure we are not
01:08 - in the level editor by adding an if the
01:10 - bump index check
01:12 - and checking if editor is less than one
01:15 - while we are here it has been pointed
01:17 - out to me many times
01:19 - thank you for picking me up on these
01:20 - things guys that we should be adding one
01:23 - to the coin variable each time we spawn
01:25 - one of these coins too
01:27 - there give that a quick test
01:32 - cool no more coin fountains and i can
01:35 - confirm that we are registering the
01:36 - collection of a coin now
01:38 - when we head bump a mystery block nice
01:41 - and so finally all the shame of it
01:43 - remember last episode's bug fix
01:45 - where i said we'd fix gumba not being
01:48 - cleared in the level editor when we're
01:49 - setting a level
01:50 - oh gosh i completely messed that up let
01:54 - me show you why
01:55 - come into the editor sprite and see how
01:57 - we added the delete
01:58 - all object index and object type lists
02:00 - here
02:01 - i was supposed to place them down here
02:03 - in the define generate level script
02:06 - under this delete all from tile grid oh
02:10 - sorry about that and now with that out
02:13 - of the way
02:14 - let's move on to something new we'll
02:17 - finally add in
02:18 - mario losing a life this will occur when
02:21 - we accidentally
02:22 - touch a gumba so click into the enemy
02:24 - sprite and find the define
02:26 - tick gumba script
02:29 - if you scroll down here and find the
02:31 - touching mario check
02:32 - you may remember we left the else side
02:34 - of this condition blank
02:36 - the condition was checking whether we
02:37 - were dropping down from above
02:39 - or not if so we squish gumba
02:43 - but otherwise we should be losing our
02:45 - life
02:46 - what we will do then is add in a new
02:48 - broadcast of mario
02:50 - lou's life that's nice and
02:52 - straightforward
02:53 - and our mario sprite will implement the
02:55 - receiver
02:56 - but before we do that just pop into the
02:58 - enemy costumes
03:00 - and let's copy the big costume over into
03:03 - our mario sprite
03:04 - because although up until now mario
03:06 - doesn't really go off screen
03:08 - when we lose a life we will now need him
03:10 - to
03:12 - so next up click into the mario sprite
03:15 - and then i'll make some space after the
03:17 - define game loop
03:18 - that's using my new dev tools extension
03:21 - but you of course can just drag the
03:22 - scripts to make space otherwise
03:25 - we'll add in when i receive mario lose
03:28 - life
03:29 - now we have to ask ourselves what
03:31 - happens when mario loses a life
03:34 - it's a lot easier to work from reference
03:37 - so let's watch a quick video
03:38 - of mario in action okay so
03:42 - first off in super mario we should only
03:44 - lose a life
03:45 - when we are small mario big mario has a
03:48 - second
03:48 - chance however we'll ignore that for now
03:51 - because we don't have a small mario yet
03:53 - now when mario gets hit first off the
03:56 - game
03:56 - pauses all the enemies and mario stop
03:59 - moving
04:00 - but note the level tile animations keep
04:02 - playing
04:03 - due to this it will probably be best to
04:05 - stop the main game loop altogether
04:08 - and make a lose life loop to replace the
04:10 - game loop
04:11 - so let's look at mario's movements
04:14 - firstly he changes costumes
04:16 - and then pauses this lets us see
04:19 - what killed us and reassures the player
04:21 - that the death was legitimate
04:23 - next mario jumps into the air and falls
04:26 - off screen
04:27 - back to our scripts then we always
04:29 - change mario's costume in the define
04:31 - paint sprite custom block but it's
04:34 - controlled by
04:35 - us setting the player action variable we
04:38 - will therefore set
04:39 - player action to lose life and we'll add
04:41 - in the code to switch costumes later
04:44 - next we'll use a stop other scripts in
04:46 - sprite
04:47 - to stop the main game loop from
04:49 - continuing once we've lost a life
04:51 - now the next thing that mario does is
04:54 - pause for almost a second
04:56 - nothing else on the screen should move
04:57 - but the tile should continue to animate
04:59 - so repeat 25 and paint sprite
05:02 - to update mario and we'll bring in a
05:05 - broadcast
05:06 - position tiles this ensures the level
05:08 - tiles are positioned and
05:10 - animated but we will not be broadcasting
05:13 - any of the enemy or player movement
05:14 - events
05:16 - now let's update the define paint sprite
05:18 - script
05:19 - if you have my dev tools enabled you can
05:22 - just middle click the custom block to
05:24 - jump to its definition
05:25 - otherwise it's fine script time so i'll
05:28 - duplicate
05:29 - one of these ifs and change it to look
05:32 - for a player action of
05:33 - lose life and then switch costumes to
05:37 - mario death it's been a long time coming
05:40 - we'll pop it
05:40 - right at the top under the go to xy so
05:43 - that it's the first thing that is
05:45 - checked
05:46 - now that mario will need to go off
05:47 - screen during the lose life animation
05:49 - we should switch to the big costume
05:51 - right at the top of this script
05:56 - okay give it a test i'll run right into
05:59 - a gumba
06:00 - and pow the game pauses with mario
06:02 - looking very uncomfortable
06:04 - and also notice that the animating tiles
06:06 - do keep moving for the first second
06:08 - perfect next step then is to have mario
06:12 - bounce up into the air
06:14 - come back to the when i receive mario
06:16 - lou's life
06:18 - we can make this effect using a simple
06:19 - jump script we therefore start by
06:22 - setting speed y
06:22 - to a positive number i found 17 to work
06:26 - well for a nice big bounce
06:28 - now we want this animation to repeat
06:30 - until mario has fallen off the bottom of
06:32 - the screen
06:33 - that is until y subtract camera y
06:39 - that's his screen position is less than
06:42 - minus 200
06:44 - it actually might not be quite enough
06:46 - maybe perhaps -220 to be sure
06:49 - see how you go whether you can still see
06:50 - the top of his head when he falls off
06:52 - screen
06:53 - now in the loop change speed y by minus
06:55 - one to simulate gravity
06:57 - and then change y by speed y you've all
07:00 - seen this before by now
07:02 - and finally paint sprite and broadcast
07:04 - position tiles to keep the tiles
07:06 - animating cool we can give it a test
07:10 - so on touching goomba now we pause as
07:12 - before and then bounce
07:14 - yeah that's just like mario and he does
07:17 - appear to have gone fully off screen so
07:19 - maybe we were okay so let's just make
07:22 - the game pause a little longer after
07:24 - he's gone off screen
07:25 - using a simple repeat 30
07:31 - broadcasting position tiles we never
07:34 - want to stop animating these
07:36 - and then finally broadcast and wait the
07:39 - level load event
07:40 - to reset the level
07:44 - and broadcast without a weight level
07:47 - start game loop
07:48 - respawn bit of a mouthful that one
07:52 - shall we test that running into a
07:55 - gumball bounces me off the level
07:56 - a short pause and then the entire level
07:59 - resets
08:00 - perfect i'll just confirm i can still
08:02 - squash the goombas
08:03 - and then try losing life over here yep
08:06 - the level still resets
08:07 - and all is looking good okay you have a
08:11 - choice here
08:12 - depending on the version of mario you
08:14 - like to play when mario falls off the
08:16 - bottom of the level he just disappears
08:18 - and in other games he does his loser
08:21 - life animation too
08:22 - if you want him to do the jump when he
08:24 - falls off the level then
08:26 - find the define check around player
08:29 - remove the reset player block and
08:31 - replace it with a broadcast mario
08:34 - lose life simple as that let me show you
08:36 - what that looks like
08:38 - so we find the gap to fall down and then
08:40 - there he goes
08:41 - and he now plays the same lose life
08:43 - animation here too
08:45 - yeah so it's up to you whether you want
08:47 - this or not
08:49 - next up then did you catch last week's
08:51 - video the simple background scrolling
08:53 - tutorial
08:54 - if not then you may want to catch that
08:56 - now as we are going to use the same
08:58 - scripts to add in our parallax scrolling
09:00 - background to mario
09:02 - a link to the background scrolling
09:03 - tutorial is in the notes under this
09:05 - video and covers things in far more
09:06 - detail
09:08 - so if you don't have the background
09:09 - sprite already in your game
09:11 - follow the link under this video to the
09:13 - scratch tutorial assets project on my
09:15 - grip patch tuto account
09:16 - and there you will find the new
09:18 - background sprite with two
09:20 - nice costumes backpack the entire
09:23 - background sprite
09:26 - and then switch back to your tile
09:27 - scrolling project and drag the
09:29 - background sprite into the sprite
09:31 - panel like so okay so these two new
09:34 - costumes are exactly
09:36 - 256 pixels wide
09:39 - as with all the graphics in this mario
09:41 - game though we want to set the size to
09:43 - be
09:43 - 200 percent so in your code tab
09:46 - add a when green flag clicked show the
09:48 - background
09:50 - send it to the back with the go to back
09:52 - layer block
09:54 - and set size to 200 percent
09:59 - now i click the script stack and hold
10:01 - the phone
10:02 - this costume did not get any bigger look
10:05 - the size is still 150.
10:09 - in fact even if i enter 200 in this box
10:12 - here
10:12 - it still jumps back down to 150 this is
10:15 - simply the biggest scratch we'll let
10:17 - this costume become
10:19 - well no problem we have ways of making
10:22 - this
10:23 - work click into the costumes tab and
10:25 - make a new costume
10:27 - i'll name it size 100 the name isn't
10:30 - important but helps us to know what it's
10:31 - used for
10:32 - and i just draw a small shape in the
10:34 - middle of the canvas
10:36 - back in the scripts we switch to the
10:40 - size 100
10:41 - costume before we set the size to 200
10:46 - now if we click the script stack scratch
10:49 - is happy to size this costume to 200
10:52 - and the happy news is that now that we
10:54 - are at this size
10:55 - scratch is also happy to let us switch
10:57 - back to the background costume
10:59 - afterwards
11:00 - and it remains at our desired two
11:02 - hundred percent
11:03 - yes so
11:06 - let's continue make a new variable
11:09 - sprite width for this sprite only
11:14 - and set it to be 256 multiplied by
11:21 - size divided by 100 that quickly
11:24 - converts the original sprite width
11:26 - to how big it is now 200
11:30 - of course we could have just set it to
11:31 - 512 i guess
11:34 - make another new variable named x for
11:36 - this sprite only and set it to zero
11:39 - now just as we did in the scrolling
11:41 - background tutorial
11:42 - create a clone of self so we have two
11:44 - background sprites
11:46 - and then change to the next costume
11:49 - change x by the sprite width so this new
11:51 - costume is next to the last one
11:54 - good we are all set up now we need the
11:57 - scripts to position the background
11:59 - as things scroll around when i receive
12:02 - position tiles make a new variable
12:06 - screen x for this sprite only
12:11 - and set it to x subtract
12:16 - half of camera x that is camera x
12:19 - divided by 2.
12:20 - now we set position x 2. we need
12:24 - a subtract
12:28 - sprite width on the end on the left we
12:32 - use a
12:32 - mod operator on the left of the mod we
12:36 - have our screen
12:37 - x variable and on the right sprite width
12:41 - multiplied by 2 that's the width of our
12:44 - two background sprites
12:46 - combined the y is easier because it
12:49 - doesn't wrap around
12:50 - just set position y to 244
12:53 - subtract half of camera y that is camera
12:56 - y
12:57 - divided by two these divided by twos
13:00 - will cause the background to scroll at
13:01 - half the speed of the foreground
13:04 - super did you get all that like i said
13:07 - refer to the previous video for help on
13:09 - this
13:09 - there's a link under the video no time
13:12 - to waste
13:13 - let's give it a test looking good
13:15 - standing still
13:17 - just dispatch this goomba ah delightful
13:20 - the background is scrolling slowly along
13:22 - with us
13:23 - then look how we can also scroll up and
13:26 - down
13:26 - very cool i'll enter the level editor
13:29 - with the zero key
13:30 - this is looking really great i don't see
13:33 - any seams and the background repeats
13:35 - perfectly hold on a second
13:38 - i think we have one problem did you
13:41 - notice something
13:42 - missing yeah the mushroom power
13:45 - has gone did you expect this
13:48 - we should have because the mushroom had
13:50 - to be sent to the back to allow it to
13:52 - appear from behind
13:53 - the tile but now doing that we'll have
13:57 - placed it behind these scrolling
13:58 - backgrounds
13:59 - too but fear not we planned for this
14:03 - do you remember if i click into the
14:05 - enemy sprite here
14:06 - where we send the mushroom to the back
14:08 - we are also
14:09 - moving it forward by the value of the
14:12 - variable
14:12 - layers background this was well planned
14:16 - we just need to set this variable to the
14:17 - right number of layers to bring it to
14:19 - the front
14:20 - of the background now back in the
14:22 - background sprite
14:23 - set layers background to 2
14:27 - for this sprite and its clone two
14:29 - sprites
14:31 - so let's test this
14:34 - oh man as i was saying let's test this
14:37 - now haha success
14:41 - the mushroom is back with us
14:44 - right now since i've been squashing all
14:47 - these gumbers i feel like we should just
14:49 - make another improvement here too
14:51 - when you jump on a gumba not only do you
14:53 - squish them
14:54 - but you're supposed to get a little
14:56 - score a number 100 float
14:58 - up from them if you click into the enemy
15:00 - sprite you'll find we already have a
15:02 - costume for this
15:03 - around costume 20 i think i added it
15:05 - here
15:06 - but now that we have the improved
15:08 - particle sprite scripts
15:10 - we will copy this costume into the
15:12 - particle sprite
15:14 - so click into the particle sprite the
15:17 - script for
15:18 - score particle is very straightforward
15:20 - under the when i receive position tiles
15:23 - add a new if and we'll check that type
15:26 - contains the word
15:27 - score this will be true for any particle
15:31 - with the word score
15:32 - in its name now make a new block named
15:35 - tick score run without screen refresh
15:41 - and we'll use it in our if block
15:43 - followed by
15:44 - a stop this script
15:47 - so the animation of the score particle
15:49 - is just a change y
15:51 - by one to slowly move it upwards there's
15:54 - no acceleration
15:55 - we can then use the position with
15:57 - costume block passing in the type
15:59 - that'll be the name of the particle and
16:02 - also we'll double up as the name of the
16:03 - costume for simplicity
16:05 - more on that in a second though and then
16:07 - to make the score disappear
16:09 - after a moment change frame by one
16:12 - and check if frame is greater than 60
16:15 - that's two seconds and then delete this
16:18 - clone
16:20 - now we want to spawn this particle when
16:22 - a goomba
16:23 - is squashed so click into the enemy
16:25 - sprite and find the define
16:26 - tickumba script scroll down to the if
16:30 - touching mario check
16:32 - and we need to add to the particle list
16:35 - the first thing we do
16:37 - is add the name of the costume we want
16:38 - to spawn that is
16:40 - score 100. next we add the x
16:44 - and y position of the goomba drop these
16:46 - in
16:47 - after all the squishing code
16:50 - give it a run
16:54 - and oh my gosh
16:57 - wow that's weirdy the costume is
16:59 - definitely wrong
17:00 - so let's check the name of the costume
17:03 - in the particle sprite
17:06 - ah look it's score with an uppercase
17:09 - s the thing about costume names is that
17:12 - unlike almost everything else in scratch
17:14 - they are case sensitive that is you need
17:17 - to get the upper and lower case letters
17:18 - the same for it to work
17:20 - come back to the enemy sprite and we
17:22 - must fix the score 100 to be an
17:24 - uppercase s that was my mistake we can
17:27 - test this again
17:31 - oh no get off me goomba again gosh
17:37 - yes havar a very neat little addition
17:40 - i won't do this now but we should be
17:42 - looking to allow this score to get
17:44 - bigger the more gumber heads we bounce
17:46 - on in consecutive jumps
17:48 - am i right with that i think so oh no
17:51 - i spotted another problem the score is
17:54 - not appearing in front of the blue
17:55 - platform tiles
17:57 - the particle sprite must have moved too
17:59 - far back so stop the project
18:01 - select the particle sprite and then
18:03 - click on the go to front block
18:08 - there that should do it and now
18:12 - to finish off for today let us add in
18:15 - some music and sounds
18:17 - this can really help to make a project
18:19 - come alive
18:20 - if you don't have the sound sprite in
18:22 - your project already
18:23 - then back to my asset project and now
18:26 - backpack
18:27 - the sound sprite there's a whole lot of
18:29 - sounds in here for you to play around
18:30 - with
18:31 - i'll bring the entire sprite into the
18:33 - tile scrolling project
18:43 - like so let's work at this a sprite at a
18:46 - time
18:47 - starting with mario so click into the
18:49 - sound sprite and the sounds tab
18:51 - and now copy the following sounds to our
18:53 - mario sprite
18:55 - the jump sound
18:58 - skid sound
19:02 - coin sound
19:07 - and losing a life sound
19:13 - great now click into mario i'll delete
19:16 - that
19:16 - default meow sound we really don't need
19:18 - that
19:19 - starting with mario's jump sound then
19:22 - find the define
19:23 - handle keys jump script now we only want
19:26 - to play this jump sound when we first
19:28 - begin a jump
19:29 - we can detect this by checking if
19:31 - jumping is equal to one
19:34 - this number gets larger the longer the
19:35 - jump lasts but one
19:37 - is the very beginning then start sound
19:40 - jump
19:41 - drop it in after setting speed y to 13
19:43 - just here
19:44 - okay quick test does the first sound
19:47 - work
19:48 - jumping now ah the silence has been
19:52 - broken
19:54 - that's quite weird cool let's add the
19:56 - coin collection sound
19:59 - find the define check around player at x
20:02 - y
20:04 - and we'll simply start sound coin
20:08 - nice now find the when i receive mario
20:11 - lou's life
20:12 - this occurs when we just lost our life
20:15 - so right at the top
20:16 - add in a start sound lose life
20:22 - [Music]
20:25 - coming along great lastly in this sprite
20:29 - locate the define make skid smoke
20:32 - and whenever we create a smoke particle
20:34 - we can also
20:35 - start sound skid
20:40 - simple enough but very effective
20:44 - okay that's mario's sprite sorted so
20:47 - back to the sounds sprite
20:49 - and we'll copy the following sounds to
20:51 - the enemy sprite
20:53 - item sprout one up
20:56 - and stomped
21:00 - click into the enemy sprite now
21:05 - and find the defined tick gumba script
21:09 - scroll down and in the scripts where we
21:11 - detect and squish gumba
21:13 - start sound stomped
21:17 - this next one requires a little
21:19 - scripting locate the define
21:21 - tick life this is where we process a new
21:24 - mushroom going up from a block
21:26 - while frame is less than 16 the mushroom
21:28 - is not yet appearing
21:30 - so if we compare frame with 16 we should
21:32 - be safe to then
21:34 - start sound item sprout
21:37 - drop it within the if frame is less than
21:39 - 48 conditional
21:42 - and this happens to also be where we
21:44 - check for picking up the mushroom
21:46 - we can just start sound one up before
21:48 - deleting this clone
21:51 - a good point to test again so we can
21:53 - jump on a gumba
21:56 - and then head bumping this block
22:00 - there's the mushroom sound yeah and we
22:04 - should also be able to collect it
22:07 - super so once more back to the sound
22:10 - sprite
22:11 - this time we'll be copying sounds to the
22:13 - particle sprite
22:15 - all we want is the coin sound this time
22:17 - for when a coin pops up from a mystery
22:19 - block
22:20 - so copy the coin sound across to the
22:22 - particle
22:24 - then in the particle sprite itself find
22:26 - the when i start as clone
22:28 - and we'll simply start the coin sound
22:30 - when type is
22:31 - coin like this
22:35 - we can test it by jumping up under a
22:37 - mystery block
22:38 - yep like that
22:40 - [Music]
22:42 - so just one more sound to add and that's
22:45 - the music track
22:46 - [Music]
22:49 - let's do that in the sound sprite itself
22:51 - for now
22:52 - the music will start when i receive
22:55 - level start game loop
22:57 - but also when i receive level start game
23:00 - loop
23:00 - respawn make a new custom block named
23:04 - music but don't tick the run without
23:06 - screen refresh
23:09 - we'll loop forever
23:14 - and play the sound until done selecting
23:17 - music level 1. the finishing touch is to
23:21 - stop the music
23:22 - when we lose a life so when i receive
23:24 - music lose life
23:26 - stop other scripts in this sprite and
23:28 - that will terminate the playing music
23:31 - and wow with that we can test the
23:34 - project again
23:36 - the music is off and it is all hanging
23:40 - together pretty well
23:44 - now how about losing a life though does
23:46 - the music stop
23:51 - yeah that works really well and the
23:53 - music stops and the lose
23:55 - live music kicks in then the main theme
23:58 - restarts with the level
24:01 - very slick and guys
24:04 - that brings us to the end of another
24:06 - episode it's very satisfying to finally
24:09 - have
24:09 - sound and also losing a life is huge
24:12 - we are destined to now need to build out
24:15 - level progression
24:16 - and more content it may be good to also
24:19 - recap some of what we've done
24:21 - looking at how the game engine is
24:22 - working as a whole but that will be for
