00:02 - hello fellow bug squishers and welcome
00:05 - to this special bug fixing episode of
00:07 - our raycasters series there have been a
00:09 - bunch of common issues reported over the
00:10 - last six episodes so i'm hoping that
00:13 - this video will help round up most of
00:15 - them and get everyone up to date each
00:17 - issue and fix has its own chapter so
00:19 - let's just jump right in and summarize
00:21 - what fixes are coming up
00:23 - fix number one is for the small player
00:26 - syndrome all the way back from episode
00:28 - two this is where only the top half of
00:30 - the level is drawn and makes us look
00:32 - really small or the level is towering
00:34 - above us
00:35 - fix number two is for when only one type
00:37 - of entity appears in our game even when
00:39 - we should be seeing nanos francs and
00:41 - even collectibles this was since episode
00:43 - four
00:44 - fix number three is for the mysterious
00:47 - extra entity bug where this mysterious
00:49 - entity we didn't add would appear in our
00:51 - level
00:52 - fix number four is for entities clinging
00:54 - to the edge of the screen yeah i don't
00:56 - like that fix number five help my walls
00:59 - have turned into sprites looks amazing
01:03 - but just amazingly wrong
01:05 - and finally fixed number six for those
01:07 - who want more than nine entity costumes
01:10 - more of a feature request than a bug but
01:12 - we'll cover that quickly here anyhow
01:14 - so those are the ones we're going to fix
01:16 - today let's get bug squishing
01:19 - fix number one is for the small player
01:22 - syndrome this problem has been reported
01:24 - to me many times since episode 2 and
01:26 - this is where the level's walls appear
01:28 - to only come halfway down the screen it
01:30 - makes it feel like the player is really
01:32 - small but it's a simple fix in the
01:35 - raycaster sprite under the single ray
01:37 - script the cause for this is that you've
01:39 - probably used a change y by block in
01:42 - here when drawing your line and with
01:44 - good reason after all that's often how
01:46 - we do things but in this case i sneakily
01:49 - used another set y2 block a set block
01:53 - not change a pen line will always draw
01:55 - between the previous and new position
01:57 - and you don't need to use a change for
01:58 - that to happen check it out there
02:01 - splendid our walls are drawing as
02:03 - intended oh i'm a poet i didn't know it
02:06 - fix number two when all entities are
02:09 - showing up with the same costume yep all
02:12 - nanos franks and even collectibles
02:14 - appearing as nanos this was since
02:16 - episode four and this one was my bad
02:19 - sorry so unless you caught my fix posted
02:22 - in the community tab then you will be
02:24 - wondering what you did wrong i am so
02:26 - sorry so what did we miss
02:29 - click into the pen sprite if we look at
02:32 - the draw row script here you can see any
02:35 - type less than 10 represents an entity
02:38 - that is a costume to be stamped
02:40 - but if you look at the stamp script
02:42 - you'll see we omitted to switch the
02:44 - sprites costume before we stamp so we
02:47 - only get one type of entity costume
02:49 - showing up in the game no problem before
02:52 - we position the sprite switch costume 2
02:55 - and we pop in the same type variable
02:58 - smashing the green flag and there you go
03:01 - so simple you can see the collectibles
03:03 - nanos and franks are now all present and
03:06 - correct
03:08 - fix number three is for the mysterious
03:11 - extra entity bug or the dummy entity
03:13 - some of you have noticed a mysterious
03:15 - entity showing up in your game and it
03:17 - doesn't move
03:18 - and it can be seen to switch costumes
03:20 - erratically yes there it is can you see
03:22 - them
03:23 - when we coded our entity sorting scripts
03:26 - we stuffed a blank item a dummy value
03:29 - into the list to initialize it this
03:30 - blank entity was needed to simplify the
03:33 - sorting code but the blank row is now
03:35 - showing up as a naughty random costume
03:39 - the fix is just to get scratch to ignore
03:41 - the blank dummy value in the pen sprite
03:44 - add an if to the top of the stamp entity
03:46 - script checking if the type is the blank
03:49 - value
03:50 - and if it is we use a stop this script
03:53 - to avoid painting it to the screen
03:56 - testing that now
03:57 - and the mysterious entity is nowhere to
04:00 - be found
04:01 - great stuff
04:02 - so on to fix number four this is for
04:05 - when entities cling to the edge of the
04:07 - screen this one is annoying to see too
04:10 - especially with the bigger entities like
04:12 - frank you can sometimes see their
04:13 - costume clinging to the edge of the
04:15 - screen even when they obviously should
04:16 - be fully off screen this is just scratch
04:19 - doing what scratch does as it tries to
04:21 - stop sprites going off the screen we can
04:23 - fix this again under the stamp entity
04:25 - script in the entity sprite
04:27 - what happens is we ask scratch to
04:29 - position the sprite at x but instead
04:32 - scratch places it so that the sprite is
04:34 - still just on screen
04:37 - well that means the x position doesn't
04:39 - get set to the value we asked it to that
04:42 - makes for a reasonably easy fix though
04:44 - surround the set brightness and stamp
04:46 - with an if check
04:48 - then use an abs block to flip any
04:50 - negative differences
04:54 - and then subtract the x position from
04:56 - the x variable that gives a difference
04:59 - in position
05:02 - and check whether the answer is less
05:04 - than one pixel away job done now the
05:07 - sprite will not be stamped when it goes
05:09 - off screen
05:11 - fix five help my walls have turned into
05:14 - sprites woohoo this is a good one i know
05:16 - a number of you have been getting this
05:18 - bug and it looks really funny and it's
05:21 - really easy to explain
05:22 - in our ray cast a sprite under the
05:24 - single ray script we have entered the
05:27 - wall colors as numbers in the draw
05:29 - blocks here and here
05:31 - now if you've used any number less than
05:34 - 10 then i'm afraid rather than being a
05:37 - nice red color as you probably intended
05:39 - we get entities appearing instead
05:42 - but because color hues are cyclic all we
05:45 - need to do is add a hundred and one to
05:47 - the desired color and hey presto we get
05:50 - our red color back no more random
05:52 - glorious repeating entity craziness
05:55 - so finally fix number six for those who
05:59 - want more than nine entity costumes
06:02 - this is more feature than a bug fix if
06:04 - we come into the pen sprite you can see
06:06 - we are only treating types less than 10
06:09 - as entities but this limits us to nine
06:11 - different entity types or costumes to be
06:14 - stamped
06:15 - so what if we want more well no problem
06:17 - at all we can boost this number up to
06:20 - 100 giving us 99 entity types to play
06:23 - with the downside of this is that we
06:25 - must make sure to add 101 to all our
06:28 - color values that are less than 100 in
06:30 - the raycaster sprite when we're using
06:32 - the draw block
06:33 - cool
06:34 - well that's all the fixes at this time
06:37 - i'll watch the comments and try to pick
06:38 - up any other issues that come up a lot
06:40 - but for now get yourselves up to date
