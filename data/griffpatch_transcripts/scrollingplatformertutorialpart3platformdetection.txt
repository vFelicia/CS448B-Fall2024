00:00 - hi I'm Griff patch welcome back to my
00:03 - scrolling platform or tutorial for
00:04 - scratch this is part 3 and today we are
00:08 - going to be looking into making our
00:10 - little platformer more robust or
00:12 - platforming tasks so let's start right
00:16 - away and what we're going to do is we're
00:18 - going to make our level a little bit
00:19 - more interesting so that we can see
00:21 - where the common platformer is letdown
00:24 - so let's change our costumes let's
00:28 - duplicate the level so we now got level
00:31 - 1 2 and we'll use this one for now so we
00:33 - don't raise our original one and we'll
00:36 - add in some more obstacles so what we're
00:39 - gonna add in is a slope on one side we
00:45 - can add in its choose another color a
00:47 - roof on this side and hold down shift
01:00 - there so I get a perfect line okay so
01:03 - we've got a bit more of an interesting
01:04 - level around the guy now let's go back
01:07 - into our person and play this game now
01:11 - when I move around up here all is fine I
01:13 - go down here I jump up yeah I can jump
01:18 - up straight through the wall there floor
01:20 - and if I walk up the slope that seems to
01:23 - work at the moment I walk up to this
01:25 - wall whoa straight up to the top not
01:28 - good so we need to fix all these things
01:30 - the first thing I'm going to fix is the
01:33 - jumping up through the ceiling that's
01:34 - the most easy to fix so let's go to our
01:37 - scripts what we need to change is to
01:40 - change player Y custom block now the
01:44 - reason this is all going wrong is that
01:45 - the script that says if you're in a
01:48 - platformer you have to move up to get
01:51 - out of it so if I'm jumping up from
01:53 - below that's not useful because
01:54 - unfortunately jumping up from below
01:57 - moving up obviously pops you out from
02:00 - the top of the platform so that's no use
02:01 - so we need to change this little bit of
02:03 - script here so that it knows which
02:05 - direction to push you if you touch the
02:07 - platform safely jumping up it pushes you
02:09 - down back out if you're coming down it
02:11 - pushes you back up
02:12 - so to do that let's get an if/else block
02:17 - we pop it right at the start
02:20 - hold on before we do this it's worth
02:22 - mentioning you should stop your project
02:24 - the problem with editing this sort of
02:27 - script while you're playing the game is
02:29 - that if it's running with a always it
02:32 - called if you're running it with the run
02:35 - without screen refresh ticket which we
02:37 - are in one of our blocks then if you
02:40 - change the scripts in here and it runs
02:41 - you can cause a loop that's so fast that
02:44 - it causes scratch to have a bit of a
02:45 - problem so stop your scripts here and
02:47 - we'll do it carefully then so what we're
02:50 - gonna move is the position block
02:52 - underneath this if the change Y is going
02:56 - to go into the if put them back in here
02:59 - okay
03:00 - so we've got the F at the start then
03:02 - we've got opposition part and we've got
03:04 - to change Y in them so we need the
03:06 - greater than symbol and what we're going
03:10 - to say in here is if the speed that
03:13 - we're moving us by is bigger than zero
03:16 - now what that means is we're moving up
03:19 - speed of positive speed it's moving
03:22 - upwards so if we're moving up we want to
03:26 - change the y by minus one so move him
03:30 - down again duplicate that into the
03:33 - second health part and so if we're
03:36 - moving up we move them down if we were
03:39 - moving down we want to reverb so put
03:41 - that one to one okay so we've got to
03:44 - change Y by minus one and they change Y
03:46 - by one it's just a nut again just to see
03:50 - what happens so now if I go into even
03:52 - jump uh-huh success he's not jumping
03:56 - through but one thing that is happening
03:59 - if I hold the up key yeah that could be
04:03 - a useful feature in a game but it wasn't
04:05 - what I wanted and the reason that is
04:07 - happening is that in our little loop
04:10 - down here we set in air to zero it means
04:16 - that if we hit something we assume we on
04:19 - the ground but we're not on the ground
04:21 - when we hit that I heads we should only
04:23 - be on the ground if we hit our bottoms
04:24 - so we need to move that
04:26 - in air from there to put it into this if
04:31 - here so it's only if I character is
04:34 - moving down and we hit something that we
04:36 - set in air to zero so now if we jump
04:39 - uh-huh
04:40 - there we go perfect it doesn't stick
04:45 - anymore and we can jump up here right
04:49 - so that's fixed our first problem of
04:52 - double jumping into roofs but now we
04:55 - have more problems so let's have a look
04:57 - what these are what about walking up a
05:00 - slope seems to work still how about
05:02 - walking into a wall nope so walking into
05:05 - a wall is our next issue to fix we need
05:08 - to stop him from jumping right up to the
05:10 - top so in essence what we need to do
05:13 - when we walk sideways need to check to
05:16 - see whether he's hit a wall and move him
05:22 - out this is very similar to this script
05:23 - we used for falling through a platform
05:25 - so let's see if we can make use of that
05:27 - fact what we're going to do is look for
05:30 - the give me a tick custom block and
05:35 - we've got the if left key change X right
05:38 - key change X so we're going to create a
05:41 - new custom block to use instead of this
05:42 - change X and we're going to call it
05:46 - change layer X by by the options down
05:57 - and add in Essex into there click OK
06:03 - ok this is just like our change but our
06:06 - Y and we're going to use this now so
06:09 - make sure you truth or might want to
06:10 - change play of X where we would change
06:13 - our X before let's use this so pushing
06:16 - pass in minus 8 again take that change X
06:20 - out and duplicate that and we'll change
06:24 - X by 8 when you move right I stopped
06:28 - this nope see I told you I warned you
06:30 - press stop right so this change player X
06:36 - by is going to be very similar to our
06:39 - change
06:40 - why in fact so similar them for now
06:41 - let's let's duplicate it and we'll pop
06:46 - it in here but what we need to do is
06:49 - make sure we change all of the s X's and
06:51 - s Y's and the y's and x's so make sure
06:55 - we're changing by SX not sy and the
06:59 - comparison is SX nice why get rid of
07:02 - these s Y's and then this bit here is
07:06 - change X by we don't need the NS let's
07:10 - get rid of that beat until not touching
07:14 - platform if speed X is bigger than the
07:16 - zero and change X by minus one otherwise
07:21 - change X by one get rid of the in air
07:25 - reposition and get rid of the chain
07:28 - Spets speed why it sounds a bit more cut
07:30 - down but that should be the first first
07:36 - cut of this so let's see if this works
07:37 - that's make it big again play our
07:40 - project so let's try walking to the wall
07:44 - uh-huh we do appear to be stuck there
07:50 - and not able to walk through it that's
07:52 - great
07:52 - hey Jai that's good can't go through the
07:55 - floor but what about slope yeah the
07:59 - thing that was working all along now
08:00 - doesn't work because anything that's any
08:03 - kind of incline at all which is what
08:05 - this big wall is stops us so we stopped
08:08 - by slopes now so we need to get making
08:11 - another change to our scripts support
08:13 - slopes now stop our project and have a
08:16 - look so you need to modify this change
08:21 - player X script and what we need to do
08:25 - is have some extra checks in here before
08:29 - we stop the player and move them away so
08:32 - the best way to do this is to get an if
08:35 - block and put it right way around the
08:40 - entire script under position and we're
08:44 - gonna need this touching platforms pop
08:46 - it in there so it's only gonna run this
08:48 - bit here if we're touching up that form
08:49 - when we walk sideways into one
08:52 - but what we want to do is to see whether
08:55 - when we walk across to the slope whether
08:58 - we can move ourselves up a little bit
08:59 - out of the slope if we find that we can
09:03 - move ourselves up then that's great
09:04 - we'll let it do that but if we walk into
09:06 - a big wall and we move myself up it
09:10 - don't say no we can't do that because
09:11 - we're not out of the wall we have to
09:13 - move up all this way to get out of the
09:15 - one we don't want that so we're going to
09:16 - let ourselves move a little bit up and
09:18 - see whether there's space so what we'll
09:21 - do is we'll have a repeat loop that's
09:23 - going to be repeat eight so eight pixels
09:26 - we're going to try which is just a
09:27 - little tiny bit just enough it's the
09:29 - same speed that we're walking sideways
09:30 - it's why I chose it so it means if we
09:33 - walk across eight we can move up eight
09:35 - so it's a nice 45-degree slope so
09:39 - wouldn't that repeat eight we need to
09:42 - change our Y position to move upwards so
09:47 - change Y by want
09:52 - so we've up my one then we need to
09:55 - position like that and then do a check
09:58 - to see whether it in a platform so again
10:01 - another if and check to see whether
10:05 - we're not in a platform yeah and if
10:11 - we're not in the platform then we're
10:14 - okay we're actually out of the platform
10:16 - on this scripts all want to stop let me
10:18 - show you this now if I move this whole
10:20 - script I put it into the here just
10:23 - before the other repeat okay so if
10:26 - you're touching a platform we loop
10:28 - around moving up eight times and if any
10:32 - point we're no longer in a platform we
10:35 - want to stop and come out of this custom
10:37 - block that can be done using this stop
10:40 - block but not stop all that stops the
10:44 - whole program we want to stop this
10:46 - script so this is the effect of moving
10:50 - me up and then as soon as when out of a
10:52 - platform we come out and that's great
10:54 - because that's what we wanted we've
10:55 - walked into a slope move this up and we
10:57 - help however if at the end of this eight
11:01 - move ups we're not out of the platform
11:04 - then we've probably hit a wall
11:06 - so we want to go back to doing what we
11:08 - did before and shaking and pushing us
11:11 - out of the wall back to where we were
11:12 - but before we can do that we realize
11:15 - that we've reviewed us us up by eight
11:17 - one eight times so we need to move
11:19 - ourselves back down eight times quickly
11:21 - so we need another change just in here
11:26 - at the end of the loop and it's going to
11:28 - be y by minus eight yeah so we've
11:35 - repeated around eight times going up and
11:38 - then move yourself back down eight and
11:40 - then if we have move down we then repeat
11:43 - the checks to push us back out of the
11:44 - slope so let's see if that works
11:47 - run that so we run into a wall all's
11:51 - good and the big moment ah fail it
11:57 - starts to seem to work and then it
11:58 - doesn't could it be that this slope is
12:01 - actually slightly taller than 45 degrees
12:06 - probably so in that case we might need
12:08 - to tweak this eight let's try adding
12:10 - this to 12 instead and again minus 12
12:13 - here try again here we go
12:17 - so this sleigh was actually too steep
12:20 - but now it works so you need to tweak
12:23 - that value to find a good one that works
12:24 - for your game let's try this wall yeah
12:27 - all good
12:27 - I think we have a good stable platform
12:34 - now this is looking really good much
12:39 - more like what we wanted originally okay
12:42 - so that was the main purpose of this
12:44 - tutorial to get this point but I thought
12:46 - what might be nice is just to add a
12:48 - little bit more level on just to make it
12:50 - a bit more exciting for you before I
12:51 - leave it for the next tutorial
12:53 - so let's do that go into your platforms
12:57 - so we've already now got level 1 point 1
13:01 - and level 1 too
13:02 - so let's add a third one in so duplicate
13:06 - that again so it's nice it's doing the
13:08 - numbering for words like this which is
13:09 - great it has changes level slightly so
13:12 - it's interesting let's draw another line
13:16 - going up from this platform like this
13:21 - and maybe change this line of it here
13:27 - too what should we do do that okay so
13:32 - we've got three bits of level so let's
13:34 - go into the scripts write what we
13:39 - haven't done is added in here the set up
13:42 - custom block which we already call
13:44 - broadcasting but we're not doing
13:46 - anything with it so how did I set up
13:48 - that I'll just move this tick up here
13:51 - out of the way I mean set up we want to
13:53 - do our cloning and positioning of the
13:56 - level pieces so for starters we need
13:59 - some set X and set Y's so set X and set
14:03 - Y to 0 to begin with which is in the
14:06 - middle so this level here will appear in
14:07 - the middle where the screen of the game
14:09 - and also switch the costume to the first
14:15 - costume of the level ok all good so that
14:19 - one just as they did before originally
14:21 - with our first part of the level now we
14:24 - want another piece of the level next to
14:26 - it so for this we need to start using
14:29 - clones under the control let's see
14:32 - create clone of myself so that means we
14:35 - now got two copies of this level and
14:38 - what we shall do now is script to move
14:41 - this bit of level so we will change X by
14:48 - will say 360 for now so we're moving it
14:52 - to the second one across by 360 and we
14:55 - will switch to the next costume as well
14:57 - so next costume case we would not now
15:03 - there we go so now we've got this bit of
15:06 - level and we've got the next bit of
15:08 - level and what if we want another one
15:11 - well it's easy now so we just gonna
15:14 - duplicate of this clone change X and the
15:17 - next costume and run it again now we
15:21 - have the neck bit of level so there are
15:25 - three pieces of level one after the
15:28 - other very easy very quick
15:30 - your course will have been noticing that
15:32 - on the Left we have a bit of an artifact
15:36 - but as we go along these bits on the
15:38 - left and light remain you can still see
15:41 - them poking across this is the bane of a
15:44 - scratchers life when it comes to
15:46 - scrolling so you'll see lots of projects
15:49 - with white or black borders around them
15:51 - to hide this little overlap over the
15:53 - previous bits of level or there's
15:56 - another way of doing things just to hide
15:58 - them as they go off the screen but that
16:01 - is not for this tutorial I'm afraid
16:03 - sorry about that
16:04 - you can design some levels have some fun
16:06 - but you have to put up with that edge or
16:07 - draw a little border around it so that
16:10 - you can't see it but next tutorial we'll
16:12 - go into how I will hide it for this game
16:14 - and I hope these lots more so thank you
16:18 - again for watching see you guys bye
