00:01 - hello fellow scratchers have you ever
00:04 - wanted to stretch a Sprite in your
00:06 - scratch projects no I mean in game yeah
00:10 - I know I have what if I told you it's
00:13 - been possible all along holy mother of
00:16 - scratch cat I just can't believe it
00:18 - think of all the possibilities this
00:20 - opens up so how exactly is it done well
00:24 - grab the fisheye effect and perform a
00:26 - little costume magic and wow oh no no
00:30 - not that magic there we go and then off
00:33 - we go and there's no stopping us now I
00:36 - love it so stay tuned and I'll show you
00:39 - exactly how to recreate this fun little
00:41 - project in scratch and we'll have a good
00:44 - laugh as we do it guys let's get
00:49 - scratching we'll Begin by creating a
00:52 - brand new project in scratch and
00:55 - Scratchy will be pleased to know that
00:56 - they are the star of the show so let's
00:59 - size them up wo too big uh perhaps
01:04 - 300% good and straight to it from the
01:08 - looks category pull out a set effects
01:10 - block switching it to the much
01:13 - undervalued fishey effect set its value
01:16 - to 100 and click the block to run it oh
01:20 - scratchy what have I done to you I am so
01:23 - sorry and at 200 it's like they've got
01:25 - some tuner in their teeth and are
01:27 - checking it out in the bathroom mirror
01:29 - so sure this fisheye is good for a laugh
01:32 - but how does it give us that stretch and
01:34 - squish effect that we are after bear
01:37 - with me just for a moment more and
01:39 - you'll see first let's animate this
01:42 - effect set it back to zero and drag in a
01:46 - repeat block repeating for 50 frames
01:49 - then rather than setting the effect
01:51 - we'll use a change block instead change
01:55 - fisheye by a value of 10 click the code
01:58 - to run it and watch old scratchy inflate
02:01 - like a balloon now to bring things back
02:04 - to normal duplicate the repeat script
02:06 - and this time change the fishee
02:09 - by1 minus 10 this makes the animation
02:13 - play forwards and then backwards again
02:17 - therefore this would look great looped
02:19 - over and over again when green flag
02:22 - clicked we reset the fisheye effect to
02:25 - zero and then Loop forever doing our
02:29 - fisheye
02:30 - animations click the green flag to run
02:33 - the
02:33 - [Music]
02:36 - project I think scratchy is feeling a
02:39 - bit tired and watching this too long and
02:43 - you'll be yawning too so with the
02:45 - animation still playing click with me
02:48 - into the costume editor because now we
02:50 - get to have some serious fun you see
02:53 - although we can't modify the fishey
02:55 - effect much through code we can change
02:58 - it by modifying the Sprite costume watch
03:01 - this oh man surrounding the costume with
03:05 - a large box has caused the Sprite to
03:07 - stretch out far too big let's drop it
03:10 - back to a size of 100 that's better now
03:13 - see how the central Cat is being pulled
03:16 - out in all directions towards the edges
03:18 - of this bounding box then if I move the
03:21 - box so that the midpoint is directly
03:23 - over scratches
03:25 - nose yes yes haven't I seen this chap on
03:29 - the pages a cute animal calendar oh no
03:32 - no this is just too funny and
03:35 - interesting too this one almost looks 3D
03:38 - don't you think
03:40 - no shall we try a wider bounding box
03:44 - oh wow that too is quite
03:47 - unique no
03:51 - no whoa scratchy have you been working
03:54 - out
03:57 - man so quickly let me show you what what
03:59 - this fishey effect is really doing to
04:02 - our
04:03 - Sprites here it is applied to a nice
04:06 - grid and the middle expands hugely and
04:10 - all other content is pushed outwards
04:12 - towards the edges but look at this area
04:15 - down here do you see how it is being
04:18 - squashed vertically and the closer we go
04:21 - to the bottom the less warping we see
04:25 - are you thinking what I'm thinking so
04:28 - starting again drag out a rectangle from
04:31 - the very bottom left corner of the outer
04:34 - drawing canvas holding shift to ensure
04:37 - we get a perfect square not a
04:39 - rectangle and then draw it out to almost
04:42 - fill the entire
04:44 - width then using the selection tool grab
04:48 - our Square by The Edge and move it
04:50 - upwards until the bottom line touches
04:53 - the feet of our scratch cat and there do
04:57 - you see what is happening scratch cat is
05:00 - shrinking vertically down towards their
05:02 - feet with very minimal warping to be
05:05 - seen let's just set the outline color of
05:07 - the bounding box to
05:10 - transparent and wow we have it guys an
05:13 - awesome stretch effect all ready to drop
05:16 - into our own games
05:20 - amazing but rather than stop our
05:22 - tutorial here what I propose is we put
05:24 - this to use and create a bouncing
05:27 - scratch Cat Project does that sound good
05:30 - to you but whatever you decide to make
05:32 - remember there's a link to a scratch
05:34 - Studio under the video where you can
05:36 - share your finished projects the wackier
05:38 - the better so yeah bouncing cats we'll
05:43 - start by speeding up this animation
05:45 - reduce the number of frames down to just
05:48 - six and we'll change the fishe to be
05:50 - faster by a value of 40 and mirror those
05:54 - values in the repeat below 6 and 40
06:00 - now we're rocking Yeah scratch cat's got
06:02 - some serious moves on but this isn't
06:05 - supposed to be looping so drag those
06:07 - inner repeats out into some free space
06:11 - this is the animation we want to see
06:13 - when the cat bounces down onto the floor
06:15 - and it's going to look dead cool drag
06:18 - the cat up ready to be dropped and we'll
06:22 - set the size to 100 oh whoops would you
06:25 - look at that scratch is not letting us
06:28 - set our size above 77% it's that same
06:31 - age-old problem our costume with the
06:34 - added bounding rectangle is actually
06:36 - really very large so scratch is
06:38 - preventing us sizing it up too big to
06:41 - get around that make a new costume
06:44 - keeping it blank is fine and we'll name
06:46 - it
06:47 - small now switch to that small
06:52 - costume and only then can we set size to
06:56 - 100 and that's okay for this small
06:58 - costume
07:00 - before cunningly switching back to our
07:02 - larger costume one that's our cat
07:05 - excellent pop that at the top of the
07:08 - scripts and click the green flag to see
07:11 - the size finally restored to that 100%
07:15 - nice finally we can drop in a goto XY to
07:18 - ensure scratchy is reset to the position
07:20 - when the project begins and I'll just
07:23 - round these figures to Zer and 100 for
07:27 - neatness great so now for the fun bit
07:31 - we'll add some simple gravity in the
07:34 - forever Loop change y by
07:38 - ne10 so that they get pulled downwards
07:40 - at a constant rate right off the bottom
07:43 - of the screen okay that's too far to
07:47 - bring them to a stop we need an
07:50 - if less
07:53 - than if the Y position is less than zero
07:57 - then we can set y position back to zero
08:01 - that will stop them ever getting below
08:03 - the middle of the screen once you've
08:06 - given that a run through scratchy will
08:08 - be sitting on an invisible
08:10 - floor all very nice but I would like to
08:13 - see that floor for real so click into
08:15 - the stage backdrop Sprite and enter the
08:18 - backdrop editor now pick your favorite
08:21 - color and then using the rectangle tool
08:24 - drag out a new rectangle to cover the
08:26 - bottom third of the canvas oh man that
08:30 - was so close to being the exact size we
08:32 - needed hauh you see we want it to be as
08:35 - close to their feet as possible so just
08:37 - drag the top handle of the rectangle up
08:40 - and down until you get it just right on
08:43 - the stage there we go perfect and they
08:46 - will fall back to the same spot every
08:49 - time now this simple form of gravity
08:52 - isn't enough to create a good bounce
08:55 - effect for that we need the cat to
08:57 - accelerate towards the ground and for
08:59 - that we need a variable but not this one
09:04 - delete okay make a new variable naming
09:08 - it speed Y and we'll make it for this
09:12 - Sprite only this will keep track of how
09:14 - fast this cat is falling set it to zero
09:18 - before our forever Loop begins and then
09:21 - to model the pull of gravity downwards
09:24 - we change speed y just before the change
09:27 - Y block by negative 1 a downward force
09:31 - and now we can replace this -10 with the
09:35 - value of our speed y variable cool stuff
09:39 - smash that green
09:41 - flag and the funny thing is we are so
09:44 - used to seeing gravity that it's hard to
09:46 - even notice that this is working any
09:48 - different but compare it to what we had
09:50 - before and you will really see the
09:53 - difference better still let's have them
09:56 - bounce back up again when they hit the
09:57 - floor after the set y to zero we also
10:01 - then set speed y to 15 that should send
10:05 - them shooting back upwards again after
10:07 - they've hit the floor and it certainly
10:10 - does isn't that great what a sprightly
10:13 - cat but yeah it is a little unnatural
10:16 - looking and and why is that because it
10:19 - makes scratch cat look like he's
10:20 - completely rigid you see soft bodies
10:23 - tend to compress squeeze and bend on
10:26 - impact with the floor haha well done we
10:29 - just have the new effect for that return
10:33 - of the bounce scripts these will do
10:37 - nicely drop them in before setting speed
10:40 - Y and we should be able to check this
10:43 - out
10:44 - immediately oh man what a
10:47 - transformation this is just such a cool
10:50 - effect in fact it's rather mesmerizing
10:56 - actually 1 hour later
11:00 - yeah so the amount of Bounce is matching
11:02 - the squish effect perfectly here but
11:05 - what if we change the Bounce by setting
11:07 - speed wide to say
11:09 - five you see now this would probably
11:13 - look better with a smaller squish to
11:15 - match the smaller
11:17 - bounce no problem pull out everything
11:21 - under the set y to
11:24 - zero and we're creating a new custom
11:26 - block for this animation naming it the
11:29 - squish what else and I'm going to add a
11:32 - numeric input named Force this is to
11:35 - record just how large a squish to
11:37 - animate and since we are animating
11:40 - within the custom block we leave the run
11:42 - without screen refresh
11:44 - unchecked great so push that over into
11:47 - some free space and we'll make use of
11:50 - that squish block right away after our
11:52 - set y to
11:54 - zero now the amount of Squish force is
11:57 - given by our speed y Y and the amount of
12:00 - force required to bounce the player
12:02 - right back up the way they came is
12:04 - therefore speed y multiplied by -2 2 *
12:09 - the force in the opposite
12:12 - direction so the length of our bounce
12:15 - will remain constant with a repeat for
12:18 - 14 frames and each frame we change the
12:21 - fishey effect as before but the amount
12:24 - we change will be dictated by the
12:26 - current speed of the player
12:30 - multiply speed y by and I find -4 to be
12:36 - a good value but you can play with
12:38 - that next up we change speed y again
12:43 - inside the repeat Loop and pop in a
12:45 - divide because we want to change the
12:47 - speed by our Force input but divide it
12:52 - equally between the 14 frames of our
12:56 - animation finally in short the fisheye
12:59 - effect is fully reset after the loop by
13:02 - setting fisheye back to zero excellent
13:07 - let's give that a test smash that green
13:10 - flag oh man I do love that it gives an
13:14 - even more pronounced Squish and jump now
13:17 - and once more I find myself no no no I
13:21 - don't because we have yet to test this
13:23 - with a reduced jump height so set the
13:26 - initial starting wide position to 50
13:29 - and we'll see what effect this
13:31 - has yeah okay this is more like it the
13:35 - squish is reduced and you'll note we
13:38 - automatically bounce back up by the same
13:40 - height we dropped from each time and
13:42 - that's cool at 20 and it's spot on
13:47 - whatever we choose this is going to play
13:49 - [Music]
13:52 - along so set things back to 100 and we
13:55 - can finish off this project a scrolling
13:59 - background never gets old so hide that
14:02 - Speedway variable reporter and we'll
14:04 - make a new Sprite for the scrolling
14:07 - floor I'm going to name mine Flor yes it
14:11 - does what it says on the tin we need a
14:13 - new Sprite because poor old backdrops
14:16 - can't be scrolled but click back into
14:18 - the backdrop now because we can drag the
14:21 - backdrop costume into our new Sprite to
14:24 - save us having to draw it all over again
14:27 - and then making sure we are still in the
14:29 - backdrop Sprite delete the costume to
14:32 - avoid any confusion later on so with
14:36 - that done you'll find the floor is easy
14:38 - enough to move around on the stage but
14:41 - to keep it centered set it now back to
14:43 - an XY of0
14:46 - 0 now I'm going to add some texture to
14:50 - this floor costume because without it
14:52 - you cannot tell when it's scrolling or
14:54 - stationary and that would defeat the
14:56 - point of all our hard work
14:59 - okay all done now using the selection
15:02 - tool we need to drag a marquee around
15:05 - the whole costume and with all the
15:07 - shapes selected click the group button
15:10 - to group them all together next begin to
15:13 - drag the group left but hold down the
15:16 - shift key to snap it to a horizontal
15:19 - Movement we want to line it up just a
15:22 - few pixel short of the center of the
15:25 - canvas But Here Comes the tricky part
15:28 - hold down the ALT key and drag the first
15:33 - group to duplicate it but don't let go
15:36 - yet instead hold down the shift key
15:39 - again to snap it to the horizontal
15:41 - movements and we want to position it
15:43 - nicely just overlapping the first group
15:46 - with its left Edge just shy of the
15:48 - center once
15:50 - more okay let us script when green flag
15:56 - clicked go to x of 0 y of Z and then we
16:01 - Loop
16:03 - forever now we could change X
16:07 - by
16:10 - -4 click the script to test it and sure
16:13 - enough the floor Scrolls left but the
16:16 - scrolling speed needs to be controlled
16:18 - by our player so make a new variable
16:22 - camera speed X leaving it for all
16:27 - Sprites and we'll set this
16:30 - to4
16:32 - also click that block to ensure the
16:34 - value gets set there we go and then
16:38 - change X by the camera speed X
16:41 - instead perfect except the scrolling
16:44 - background ends too quickly not a
16:47 - problem there's a reason our floor is
16:49 - made of two identical halves as that can
16:52 - create a perfect cycle if less
16:57 - than if the the X position is less than
17:02 - -240 that's half a screen width then
17:06 - change X by positive 480 that's a full
17:11 - screen width and that is looking mighty
17:15 - fine if you find the floor doesn't
17:17 - perfectly Loop then you will just need
17:19 - to tweak your costume to get the two
17:21 - groups position just right exactly 480
17:25 - pixels apart from each other if you need
17:27 - to know so the only problem now is that
17:30 - when the cat touches the floor they skim
17:33 - over it instead of coming to a
17:36 - stop click back into the scratch cat
17:39 - Sprite and we'll fix that now we need to
17:42 - ensure this Sprite is in front of the
17:44 - level using a goto front
17:47 - layer this not only looks good but it's
17:50 - important so that the cat scripts will
17:52 - run first before the level spite scripts
17:55 - and we can reset the camera speed X to Z
17:58 - zero at the start of our
18:01 - program that results in the floor
18:04 - standing still like so no movement so
18:08 - next let's move the cat Sprite to the
18:10 - right by four pixels change X by four at
18:14 - the top of this forever
18:17 - Loop now the cat happily bounces off to
18:19 - the right but while on the floor in the
18:22 - squish animation they stay put that
18:25 - looks good all that is left then is to
18:28 - bring back the
18:32 - scrolling when green flag clicked
18:38 - forever and we set camera speed
18:44 - X to a multiply
18:47 - block we want the camera to gradually
18:49 - follow the player so we'll use the
18:51 - exposition of the player multiplied
18:55 - by 0.1 and it's negative because well I
19:00 - should have really flipped the direction
19:02 - in the floor Sprite sorry about that but
19:05 - never mind lastly we must scroll our
19:09 - players too so change X by and drop in
19:13 - the same camera speed X excellent run
19:17 - the
19:22 - project and that that is so cool I love
19:27 - how the scrolling slows down as the cap
19:29 - bounces and it all just hangs together
19:32 - so well you may notice that it feels
19:35 - like scratchy is always hanging around a
19:37 - bit more to the right of the screen than
19:39 - he maybe should and you'd be right and
19:42 - that's because of how our scrolling is
19:44 - always trying to keep up with them as
19:46 - they move away but we can fix it by
19:49 - summing the cat's Exposition with an
19:51 - offset say 100 and that brings the cat
19:56 - 100 pixels left of center like so a
19:59 - pretty good compromise but not the only
20:02 - option so feel free to play around with
20:04 - that number until you find one that
20:06 - suits your game
20:08 - best so there you have it that's all our
20:12 - coding today and you can try plugging in
20:14 - different values for example speed up
20:16 - the cat's jumps by increasing the change
20:18 - X here eight is very
20:21 - good and 18 wo this would look very fine
20:25 - with a frog Sprite don't you think you
20:28 - know I really hope you will take this
20:30 - project and do something amazing with it
20:33 - as always there is a scratch Studio
20:35 - linked under the video for you to submit
20:37 - your squishy projects and this time it
20:39 - can be anything that makes use of this
20:41 - effect not just a bouncing scratch cat
20:43 - Frank or penguin knock yourselves out
20:46 - and create something unique to show off
20:48 - I can't wait to see what you come up
20:50 - with well I do hope you enjoyed this
20:53 - video if so then please smash the like
20:55 - button to show me your support and don't
