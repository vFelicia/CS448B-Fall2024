00:00 - [Music]
00:02 - hello fellow scratchers back for more
00:04 - Geometry Dash well that's excellent
00:07 - because that's exactly what I've got in
00:09 - store for you no beating around the bush
00:11 - we are finally branching out to bring
00:13 - that awesome ship mode into our games
00:16 - whether you fancy drawing these assets
00:17 - yourself or want to grab them from me
00:20 - I've got you covered yes we're going to
00:22 - get the ship physics just right and I've
00:25 - got the perfect bit of Mass to point the
00:27 - ship in the right direction finally we
00:30 - don't forget to fix the ship's particle
00:31 - stream to emit from just the right area
00:35 - so are you ready well before we dive in
00:39 - if you would like some help with the
00:40 - costumes for this episode I've created
00:42 - an asset pack on my Griff patch tutor
00:45 - account also linked under this video it
00:48 - contains the player and their ship form
00:51 - of course if you want to draw these
00:52 - yourself then please do that can be half
00:55 - the fun after all uh these are some of
00:57 - my hit boxes I use in my game and and
01:00 - then we have some level assets too
01:02 - including yes my rather artistic
01:05 - handdrawn portal costume and finally we
01:08 - have two soundtracks from the previous
01:10 - episodes just don't forget to give
01:12 - credit if you use them to foreverbound
01:14 - and robtop himself thank you guys right
01:18 - then if you want to make use of any of
01:20 - these then just drop the Sprites into
01:22 - your backpack one two and three and we
01:27 - are ready to rumble so open your
01:30 - projects from episode 6 and we'll save
01:33 - them as a fresh new copy for this is
01:36 - episode 7 guys let's get
01:41 - scratching we are going to begin by
01:43 - adding a portal and to avoid us trekking
01:46 - halfway across the level to test it I
01:48 - think we'd better pop one right here at
01:51 - the very start of the game click into
01:54 - the level Sprite and we want the portal
01:56 - dropping right here now it's your choice
02:00 - whether you draw your own portal in
02:01 - scratch or use my asset the important
02:04 - thing is that its size is around 2 by
02:07 - three of your regular tiles now it must
02:11 - contain no pure white color so that the
02:14 - player can pass through it without
02:16 - gliding and it must contain a unique
02:19 - color that we'll use to trigger the
02:21 - change to ship mode I'm using this pinky
02:24 - purple color so this would do just fine
02:28 - but since we have the at hand we might
02:31 - otherwise bring in my level asset Sprite
02:34 - and then copy the
02:37 - portal and paste
02:39 - it where is it ah paste it into the
02:43 - existing level like so we just need to
02:46 - remember to hide the imported asset
02:48 - Sprites before we play the game and here
02:52 - we are one very fine portal ready to
02:55 - transform us into a very Splendid ship
02:58 - or note how we are not colliding with
03:00 - the portal because I didn't include any
03:02 - Pure White in this costume so we are
03:06 - going to need a new costume for our ship
03:09 - too I don't mind if you want to draw
03:11 - this yourself or borrow the asset
03:13 - project the player Sprite I backpacked
03:15 - earlier already has a very fine ship
03:17 - ready to rock and roll so just drag the
03:20 - costume from that Sprite into our player
03:22 - Sprite like so then check back in our
03:26 - player Sprite to ensure both costumes
03:28 - are now ready for use I just noticed my
03:31 - players colors are still yellow and
03:33 - white so I'm going to update them to
03:35 - match the asset colors we can use the
03:37 - fill tool for that great now just in
03:40 - case you don't use my assets let me show
03:43 - you how the dimensions of this costume
03:45 - compare to the original player
03:47 - Cube okay so as you can see the player
03:50 - and the ship should fit just within the
03:53 - height of the original player Cube
03:56 - however the width is just a little wider
03:59 - and that's okay one thing you must
04:02 - ensure is that once you finished drawing
04:04 - your ship that you select the entire
04:06 - costume and snap it to the center of the
04:09 - costume canvas like so that is so that
04:12 - it will rotate nicely around its origin
04:14 - the middle point now costume names these
04:18 - are important you'll see I've named the
04:20 - ship form as ship but we must also
04:24 - rename the First costume not as player
04:27 - but now as cube this is the cube form if
04:31 - you want to support more than one skin
04:33 - then make this Cube one Cube two and
04:36 - Cube 3 Etc just always begin with Cube
04:40 - or
04:40 - ship excellent so with our costumes
04:43 - ready we need a way to switch between
04:45 - game modes from Cube to ship for this
04:50 - we'll make a new variable named mode and
04:54 - it's for all
04:55 - Sprites we want to begin as a cube so
04:58 - under the when I receive game on script
05:01 - before switching costumes we can set
05:04 - mode to cube the same name as our
05:07 - costume and that is no coincidence now
05:10 - move down to the forever Loop we want to
05:14 - watch out for when the player touches a
05:16 - portal I want all these Collision checks
05:19 - to be performed using the hitbox costume
05:22 - but also in the nonrotated form so I'm
05:26 - going to move this set rotation style to
05:28 - all around down below the touching Spike
05:31 - check
05:33 - here great now for the portal checks
05:37 - make a new custom block check portal and
05:41 - then I'm going to pop in a numeric input
05:44 - of player y we won't need that varable
05:47 - right now but it will be useful later on
05:49 - for sure we'll make use of this new
05:52 - block down here before setting rotation
05:54 - mode and we'll pass in the current y
05:56 - position of the
05:58 - player okay let's code the custom
06:02 - block are we touching a
06:04 - portal
06:06 - if touching
06:09 - color then make the level Sprite visible
06:12 - so that we can get the portal costume
06:14 - visible on the
06:16 - stage which will allow us to pick our
06:18 - exact pink shade that will trigger a
06:21 - change of
06:23 - form great next up set
06:28 - mode to can you guess yeah
06:33 - ship hold on I just realized I am
06:37 - recording this video in the new high
06:39 - contrast scratch color mode I use it
06:42 - quite a lot these days as it's great for
06:44 - taking screenshots but let me switch
06:46 - back to keep things consistent with my
06:48 - other videos now let's finish off this
06:51 - script after changing mode to ship we
06:55 - need to ensure we are facing to the
06:57 - right point in Direction 90
07:00 - and reset the player's jump speed
07:03 - setting speed y to
07:06 - zero cool if you want to test that then
07:09 - we should see that the mode variable
07:11 - will switch from Cube to ship the moment
07:14 - we touch the portal excellent and
07:17 - therefore actually switching costumes is
07:20 - just one block away switch costume
07:23 - that's here to mode are you ready for
07:27 - this let's go
07:30 - and yes we did it ship mode complete
07:35 - well I hope you enjoyed this episode
07:37 - like the video
07:39 - subscribe only kidding well no do please
07:42 - do those things but no we are not done
07:46 - we need some proper ship movement
07:49 - scripts just before we add these though
07:51 - I realize that some of you will have
07:53 - rushed ahead and added skins to your
07:55 - project and that will mean multiple new
07:58 - costumes something like well actually no
08:01 - hopefully nothing like this but anyhow
08:04 - all you need to do in this case is add a
08:07 - number after the costume name like so
08:10 - and then when we switch costumes pop in
08:13 - a join block first joining the mode with
08:17 - a skin variable and that can be the
08:19 - value one two or whatever to make the
08:22 - full costume name anyhow maybe we'll
08:25 - cover that fully in a later episode I
08:28 - just didn't want to leave you
08:29 - hanging so player movement scripts
08:33 - that's found up here if you happen to
08:36 - have scratch add-ons installed with my
08:37 - Dev tools extension then you can jump
08:40 - right to the definition by simply middle
08:42 - clicking the block yes these are the
08:45 - cube specific movement scripts so what I
08:48 - suggest is that we create a new custom
08:50 - block cube move for men let's try that
08:54 - again Cube
08:56 - movement and we'll move the entire
08:59 - player movement scripts over into that
09:01 - new defined
09:03 - block then we'll make use of this but
09:06 - within an if else block checking whether
09:10 - mode is equal
09:14 - to
09:15 - cube there we go excellent I think you
09:19 - can see where I'm going with this so now
09:21 - we need a second custom block ship
09:25 - movement run without screen refresh and
09:28 - of course we're going to drop that into
09:30 - the else
09:32 - Branch we'll code this block up now in
09:34 - some free
09:36 - space the movement of our ship is quite
09:39 - simple when the jump key is held we
09:42 - accelerate up otherwise we're going to
09:44 - be accelerating down so if else checking
09:49 - for the jump key oh yeah we have that
09:52 - over here it's space or Mouse
09:56 - down then we're going to accelerate up
09:58 - by changing ing speed y by
10:02 - one and back down just as easy change
10:05 - speed y by negative
10:08 - one we do have to be careful though not
10:10 - to exceed a maximum speed uh if speed Y
10:16 - is greater than
10:19 - 12 then we can set speed y back to
10:23 - 12 downwards is almost the same if speed
10:26 - Y is less
10:28 - than but we're not going to use -2
10:30 - instead we'll use -10 this is the same
10:33 - as the scrolling speed so that the ship
10:36 - will fall perfectly diagonally and yet
10:39 - set speed y to
10:42 - -10 so that's a speed sorted Now we move
10:45 - the actual ship change
10:48 - y by speed y yay and it's testing time
10:54 - I'm pretty excited to see how this turns
10:56 - out and into the portal
11:00 - okay so this is pretty cool holding
11:02 - space has me shoot up into the air and
11:05 - releasing brings me back down to
11:07 - earth however there are a few things
11:10 - missing one I should be rotating to
11:13 - match the direction of travel and two I
11:15 - can fly straight through the ground and
11:17 - the walls and that's less than ideal
11:20 - we'll fix that first adding to the ship
11:24 - movement
11:25 - scripts
11:27 - if the player is touch in the color
11:30 - white and that's pure
11:33 - white then first are we flying up or
11:36 - down use an if
11:39 - else if the speed Y is less than zero
11:43 - then we are flying downwards we'll use
11:46 - our move out of level block and we can
11:49 - enter one in the input to raise the
11:52 - player up out of the
11:53 - floor otherwise in the else also move
11:57 - out of level but use a negative one to
12:01 - drop the player out of the ceiling yeah
12:04 - this time we really do want to allow
12:06 - ceiling collisions when in ship mode
12:09 - finally still within the touching white
12:11 - if block finish by setting speed wi back
12:14 - to zero to level the ship off shall we
12:17 - give that another try smash that green
12:20 - flag and I'm going straight for the
12:22 - floor to ensure I can no longer pass
12:24 - through it it's also worth checking that
12:27 - the spikes are still as capable of
12:29 - ending my game as before and running
12:32 - into a
12:33 - wall yeah this is coming along great the
12:36 - next step is to improve the visuals by
12:38 - making the ship point in the direction
12:40 - it is flying H so how do we do that well
12:46 - we'll need a pointing Direction block at
12:48 - least but next up we need some
12:51 - trigonometry ha well don't worry it is
12:54 - actually simple enough drop in an
12:56 - addition and we're going to add 90 two
13:00 - and this is the exciting block no not
13:02 - the ABS but the arc tan or aan for short
13:07 - this calculates an angle based on the
13:10 - supplied gradient value now that is
13:14 - speed y divided by scroll speed just pop
13:20 - that in there and that is it don't
13:23 - believe it could be that easy well just
13:26 - watch this see using just the movement
13:30 - speed in the X Direction and the y
13:32 - direction we can calculate the direction
13:34 - angle and everything just looks
13:36 - beautiful Simply Beautiful don't you
13:41 - agree that simple change transforms this
13:44 - game mode into something quite special
13:47 - but of course there is still something
13:49 - missing we've lost our player particle
13:52 - Trail well previously this was triggered
13:54 - by a crate clone block and cloning h H
13:59 - the particle Sprite and you know what
14:03 - that doesn't look half bad it's just a
14:06 - shame that the particles do not emit
14:07 - directly from our ship's rear end if we
14:11 - click into the players costume Tab and
14:13 - take a closer look at the ship
14:15 - costume I'll just duplicate it so I can
14:17 - show you this without ruining the
14:19 - original costume if I make all the fills
14:22 - transparent then now I can count grid
14:25 - squares from the center of the costume
14:27 - to the rocket EX exhaust it's 1 2 3 4 5
14:31 - squares to the left and two squares down
14:35 - from Center okay make a note of that
14:38 - we'll need it again in a moment and we
14:42 - click into the particle
14:45 - Sprite you can see it's here that we
14:48 - position the particle at present so
14:50 - bring in an if else and once more we'll
14:53 - check for a
14:55 - mode of cube mode equals cu Cube then
14:59 - we'll separate off the show and repeat
15:02 - Loop and take just the change X and Y
15:04 - blocks and Below over into that if that
15:07 - is specifically for the cube particles
15:11 - great return the separated off scripts
15:13 - to the bottom and the if else to the
15:16 - when I start as clone hat block now
15:19 - we'll position the particles for our
15:21 - ship firstly we want to move five grid
15:24 - squares to the left ha except if our
15:27 - player is Rota
15:30 - then actually that's five squares
15:32 - backwards from the direction of
15:35 - rotation so we need to first point in
15:38 - the same direction as our player Sprite
15:40 - and luckily there's a handy Block in the
15:42 - sensing category for this the mighty
15:45 - thing of thing block just here and we
15:48 - begin by changing it to be of player
15:51 - because then the left hand options
15:53 - change and we can select direction of
15:56 - player now the particle is facing the
15:59 - same direction as the player Sprite that
16:02 - means if we use the move block we can
16:05 - move forwards in that direction or
16:08 - backwards by supplying a negative value
16:10 - so a grid square is four pixels so -5
16:14 - multip by 4 is -20 pixels then to move
16:19 - down by two squares we first turn
16:22 - clockwise by 90° so we're facing
16:24 - downwards and then move again this time
16:27 - by two multiply by 4 that's 8
16:31 - pixels cool what about the particle
16:34 - speed duplicate the set speed X and Y
16:38 - and we'll change them both to be a
16:40 - random number from
16:42 - -1.0 to
16:45 - 1.0 Splendid I think we can give that
16:48 - green flag a
16:50 - slap here we go so these particles are
16:53 - now definitely emitting from roughly the
16:56 - right place and they are controlled and
16:58 - less random but something is not quite
17:01 - right it feels like the particles are
17:03 - still slightly misaligned and in fact
17:06 - they are appearing roughly 10 pixels to
17:08 - the left of the ship's exhaust it had me
17:11 - stumped for a short while but then I
17:13 - realized that after all our Pixel
17:15 - Perfect positioning up here we then have
17:18 - the animation Loop below that Scrolls
17:20 - the particles off leftwards and that's
17:23 - great except that it begins to run right
17:27 - away and so immediately Scrolls the
17:29 - particles one frame to the left of where
17:31 - they're supposed to be ah the 10 pixels
17:35 - we need to delay this animation by one
17:38 - frame that we can do with a simple
17:41 - weight block waiting for zero seconds
17:44 - yes zero even without a specified time
17:47 - the scripts below will be postponed
17:49 - until the next animation frame and
17:52 - that's perfect so slap that green flag
17:55 - again and let's see what a difference
17:57 - one frame can make
17:59 - yes all the difference see how the
18:01 - initial particle is locked exactly in
18:04 - place no matter what angle our ship is
18:06 - at it's those little finishing touches
18:08 - that makes our games look awesome right
18:12 - talking of which what is up with our
18:14 - main title menu our player Sprite is
18:17 - stuck in mode but also we somehow
18:20 - lost our floor let's tackle the floor
18:23 - first I'm sure it's super simple and yes
18:26 - in the floor Sprite we set camera y to
18:29 - zero under the reset level script but
18:31 - not under our green lag script let's set
18:35 - camera y to zero in
18:38 - there good good we're getting there now
18:41 - for the player costume click back into
18:43 - the player Sprite and again when the
18:46 - green flag is clicked we just switch the
18:48 - costume to for whichever costume you
18:50 - fancy on the title screen Cube for me
18:53 - and with that things are looking back to
18:57 - normal bug
18:59 - squashed well that's great now there is
19:02 - one more issue that has been raised by a
19:04 - fellow scratcher and that's the fact
19:06 - that we don't have any particle Trails
19:08 - appearing on the title screen either
19:11 - well challenge accepted continue the
19:14 - green flag script with a forever Loop
19:16 - and again we create a clone of the
19:18 - particle
19:19 - Sprite now that almost does the trick
19:22 - except we have to be careful what game
19:24 - mode we were left in we are seeing the
19:26 - ship mode particles here no problem
19:29 - though we just need a set mode to cube
19:33 - right here at the top of the
19:37 - script and there you have it and I know
19:41 - that there are still more aspects that I
19:43 - have yet to cover like locking the
19:45 - vertical scrolling to a single height
19:47 - when in ship mode and a portal to return
19:49 - us back to cube mode but that and the
19:52 - many other exciting features we'll have
19:54 - to wait for another episode I do hope
19:57 - you are enjoying this tutorial and if
19:59 - you wouldn't mind liking the video to
