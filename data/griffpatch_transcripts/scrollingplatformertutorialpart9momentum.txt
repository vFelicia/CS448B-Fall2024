00:00 - hi guys this is Griff patch welcome back
00:02 - to another edition of our scrolling
00:04 - platformer or tutorial in scratch now
00:06 - that we have previously covered the core
00:08 - game engine I'm going to be recording
00:09 - smaller add in episodes covering the
00:11 - more requested features that we have yet
00:13 - to include today we are looking at
00:15 - player momentum that is how the player
00:18 - changes speed as you press the left and
00:20 - right arrows if you watch here you'll
00:22 - see the player instantly Springs left
00:24 - and right without any speeding up or
00:26 - slowing down so this is what we're going
00:28 - to try and address returning to the end
00:31 - of part eight of our series I'm is clean
00:33 - up this script okay so what we need to
00:37 - introduce is momentum so at the moment
00:39 - we have down here in the tick custom
00:41 - block we have a change player X by and
00:44 - at the moment we're changing it by minus
00:46 - eight for left and eight for right and
00:48 - there's no difference it's always minus
00:50 - a or plus eight so what we need to do
00:52 - introduce a new variable so make
00:54 - available and it's for this sprite only
00:57 - and we'll call it s X speed X okay now
01:02 - in the game on we want to set this s X
01:05 - to be zero at the very beginning same
01:09 - place that we set speed Y now in the key
01:14 - press section here we want to change s X
01:18 - by - to the left
01:22 - and we're gonna change it pi/2 for right
01:27 - now take out the change player X buy or
01:31 - keep one so now when we're pressing the
01:33 - left and right arrow keys we're changing
01:36 - their speed not the actual position now
01:38 - this will allow us to get faster and
01:40 - faster the longer we hold on a key but
01:42 - we must stop them from getting too fast
01:44 - and also want to slow down again when
01:46 - they let go
01:46 - so set speed X to be speed x times by
01:53 - 0.8 so that will slowly eat away at the
01:57 - speed until they come back to zero again
01:59 - okay but we also need to actually change
02:02 - their position now we could just put
02:04 - change X in here but it's better if we
02:07 - wrap that up in an if like this have
02:11 - greater than an absolute value of that
02:14 - means not negative always a positive
02:16 - version of a number so if their speed is
02:19 - greater than zero point nine so that
02:21 - means they're moving a bit then we
02:24 - change that position by not just their
02:26 - speed but round of speed that keeps us
02:30 - from using fractional numbers and makes
02:32 - the code a bit cleaner and we want to
02:33 - detect costume collisions okay when
02:37 - theory that should be it so let's give
02:39 - it a go so to begin with speed X is zero
02:42 - if I press some keys you'll see the
02:46 - speed changes and then goes back to zero
02:48 - again and we speed up and we slow down
02:51 - when we let go and that actually feels
02:54 - really quite nice quite a difference
02:58 - already feels a lot more professional
03:00 - excellent so that's that for this little
03:04 - tiny tutorial I hope you enjoyed that
03:06 - and next time we are going to look at
03:08 - wall jumping I hope you'll join me
03:11 - subscribe to the channel like video and
03:14 - I'll see you next time
