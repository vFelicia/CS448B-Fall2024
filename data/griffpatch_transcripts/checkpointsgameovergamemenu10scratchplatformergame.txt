00:02 - hello fellow scratchers in the now
00:05 - legendary words of bennett foddy
00:07 - starting over is harder than starting up
00:10 - i'm griff patch and this is episode 10
00:12 - of our classic platformer series and
00:14 - yeah it's true having our player respawn
00:17 - from the beginning after every mistake
00:18 - is too much like hard work you've been
00:21 - filling my inbox with requests to add
00:22 - checkpoints to our game so we will
00:25 - tackle that today as well as this we'll
00:27 - give the player a fixed number of lives
00:29 - and build a game over screen and as you
00:32 - might have noticed we're gonna round it
00:33 - all off with a delightful title screen
00:35 - to boot yeah this game is really coming
00:39 - together so are you ready for this i
00:42 - know i am guys let's get scratching
00:46 - we'll begin where we left off in episode
00:48 - 9. just make sure to save it as a new
00:50 - copy naming it episode 10.
00:53 - now
00:55 - forgive me when i recorded this video i
00:57 - forgot to rename the project so don't
00:59 - panic when you see it titled episode 9
01:01 - for the rest of this video sorry guys
01:04 - it's ok this really is episode 10.
01:07 - so to create waypoints or checkpoints in
01:10 - our game we need to consider how to set
01:12 - the initial spawn of the player
01:14 - in the player sprite scroll down to the
01:16 - define reset and begin level custom
01:19 - block
01:20 - you'll find we have hard coded the
01:21 - player's spawn location here in this
01:24 - begin scene block in my game it always
01:26 - spawns us in scene 1 at an xy of -125 by
01:31 - 55. this happens both when the game
01:34 - starts and after we lose a life
01:36 - to allow us to change where we respawn
01:38 - back to we'll need to remove these
01:41 - so-called hard-coded values and replace
01:43 - them with variables that we can update
01:45 - as and when the new checkpoints are
01:47 - reached
01:49 - so we'll make three new variables the
01:51 - first named spawn x
01:54 - check it for all sprites
01:57 - then spawn y
01:59 - again for all sprites
02:02 - and lastly spawn
02:04 - scene and we mustn't forget that one
02:07 - also for all sprites great so to begin
02:10 - the game we set these to the same values
02:12 - we used in the begin scene block
02:15 - set spawn scene
02:18 - to 1
02:20 - set spawn x
02:23 - to negative 1 to 5
02:26 - and set spawn y to
02:30 - 55. it should be no surprise then that
02:33 - we can slot these variables into the
02:34 - begin scene block to continue spawning
02:36 - us as we did before
02:41 - we just need to ensure these variables
02:43 - are set only once when the game starts
02:45 - so move them up into the when green flag
02:48 - clicked script underneath the broadcast
02:50 - setup will be perfect
02:53 - it's worth quickly testing our
02:54 - platformer is still working there should
02:56 - be no change
02:58 - great we are still spawning on the first
03:00 - screen excellent but now we have the
03:03 - power to change these spoil point
03:05 - variables at will so how about we
03:08 - introduce a few checkpoints along our
03:10 - path
03:11 - we could add a new sprite for the
03:13 - checkpoints but since we've already got
03:15 - a very cool collectible system why don't
03:18 - we just reuse it for checkpoints too
03:20 - click into the oh
03:22 - the apple sprite it got that name since
03:25 - we brought it in from the scratch
03:27 - library but we use it for the apples and
03:29 - keys and whatever else we need so anyway
03:32 - open the costume editor and let's pick a
03:34 - new costume for our checkpoint i think
03:36 - scratch has a
03:38 - ah
03:39 - yes scratch is green flag so funny we'll
03:41 - use that
03:42 - just click to make it visible on the
03:44 - stage it's a little bit oversized but at
03:46 - least it makes it easy for you guys to
03:48 - see in the video i'm just going to buff
03:50 - up this costume a little bit
03:52 - right now to make things clearer i hope
03:55 - you don't mind if we rename the sprite
03:57 - as collectible
04:00 - better
04:02 - so placing a checkpoint on the level
04:04 - should be quite straightforward we do it
04:06 - the same way as placing the other items
04:08 - in the game
04:09 - we play the game until we find the point
04:11 - that we want to place the checkpoint
04:13 - just here we'll be good
04:15 - next we click to make the collectible
04:17 - visible oh that's the one costume hold
04:19 - on switch to the green flag costume yep
04:22 - then we can position it on the stage
04:24 - like so
04:26 - then under the when i receive setup
04:28 - script we can duplicate one of the
04:30 - existing place blocks
04:32 - the costume name we want is
04:34 - i'll just copy it from the costume
04:36 - itself using the clipboard to ensure
04:38 - it's correct
04:39 - green flag capital g and f
04:43 - now the scene that's scene number two
04:46 - the position x and y is given by the x
04:48 - and y of the sprite on the stage here
04:52 - and yay we can run the project to test
04:54 - that out here we go
04:56 - will it be there
04:58 - yes our checkpoint flag is just where we
05:00 - placed it excellent so easy go ahead and
05:04 - collect it
05:06 - now
05:07 - when i lose a life we want to spawn back
05:10 - to the last touched checkpoint for that
05:12 - to happen we now need to update those
05:15 - spawn variables when the flag is
05:17 - collected
05:18 - now check this out if we make the
05:20 - collected list visible we can see
05:22 - clearly that our project has registered
05:25 - the green flag as an object we can carry
05:27 - around that's so cool but not what we
05:30 - want
05:31 - in the collectible sprite find the when
05:33 - i start as clone script
05:35 - we have a check for collecting apples
05:37 - but as you can see every other object
05:40 - gets added to the collectible list below
05:42 - we need to identify when we collected a
05:45 - checkpoint so using a new if else
05:47 - compare the sprite's costume name with
05:49 - the words green flag
05:52 - for speed i'll reuse the same start
05:54 - sound wand but i'm sure you can find a
05:57 - better one and now all we want to do is
06:00 - set the spawn point variables set spawn
06:03 - scene
06:05 - to the scene hash variable
06:07 - that's the current scene and then set
06:09 - spawn x
06:13 - now we do the same for spawn y
06:19 - now we'll use the player's current
06:21 - position this is obtained through the
06:24 - thing of thing block in the sensing
06:25 - category we need to access the player
06:28 - sprite and get their x position
06:31 - cool
06:32 - now we do the same for spawn y
06:35 - it just occurred to me though that
06:37 - rather than going to this effort we
06:39 - might prefer to set spawn x and y just
06:42 - to this sprite's x and y position
06:44 - feel free to choose often there are many
06:46 - means to an end
06:48 - now we want to slot this if else into
06:51 - the main script here
06:53 - so pull the existing lscript into the
06:56 - new else and push the whole thing back
06:58 - where that came from like
07:00 - so right shall we give that a test
07:04 - first test the original respawn
07:08 - yep we respawned back at the start
07:11 - next up collect the first checkpoint
07:14 - and now
07:16 - yeah yes that's perfect we respawn at
07:19 - the first checkpoint it's a good idea to
07:22 - confirm this also works when we lose a
07:24 - life on a different scene entirely
07:26 - yeah we've got it that's great dancing a
07:29 - little jig yeah
07:31 - so what i think would be good it's just
07:33 - to add a second waypoint just to confirm
07:36 - that there will be no issue and we'll
07:38 - put it on the right side of the locked
07:40 - door
07:41 - just here
07:42 - so taking the same steps again in the
07:44 - setup script of the collectible sprite
07:47 - we can duplicate our place green flag
07:49 - block this time it's for scene 4 so fill
07:52 - that in
07:53 - make the sprite visible
07:55 - position
07:56 - it and enter the x and y
07:59 - mine are 138 and 57
08:02 - and that should be it let's test
08:10 - here we are i can see the checkpoint
08:12 - just touch it and then let's see does it
08:14 - work
08:19 - you bet it does excellent that makes me
08:23 - super happy and i bet it will do wonders
08:25 - for your games because now you can
08:27 - afford to make your levels bigger and
08:29 - more exciting than ever oh yeah
08:33 - but hold on all this talk of losing
08:36 - lives and respawning but seriously just
08:38 - how many lives have i lost
08:40 - should we allow the player to just keep
08:42 - losing lives forever and no what we need
08:45 - is the concept of limited lives and then
08:48 - game over
08:49 - so no problem we need to keep track of
08:52 - how many lives our player has
08:54 - clicking to the player sprite
08:58 - and create a new variable
09:00 - we'll name it lives for all sprites
09:06 - so start off by setting lives to three
09:09 - have you ever wondered why three lives
09:11 - is the standard number of lives
09:13 - who knows but hey who are we to break
09:15 - from convention pop the set lives under
09:17 - the green flag script so it gets set the
09:20 - same time as the initial spawn variables
09:23 - do you remember where in our code we
09:25 - handled losing a life it's in the when i
09:27 - receive lose life event receiver this
09:30 - project is getting big enough now that
09:32 - it helps to have scratch add-ons
09:33 - installed to locate these events so
09:36 - after we've played the sound and faded
09:39 - the player out we should be thinking of
09:41 - reducing the number of lives we have
09:43 - left
09:44 - change lives by negative one
09:47 - we do this as the last thing before the
09:49 - level restarts with the reset and begin
09:52 - block
09:53 - a great time to test that the lives are
09:55 - working check to see we start with three
09:57 - lives yup and that losing a life takes
10:00 - us down to two lives
10:02 - yes and again
10:04 - now one life and finally aha now we are
10:07 - down to zero lives at this point the
10:10 - game should end but right now we are
10:12 - still responding so back to the code
10:15 - surround the reset and begin block with
10:18 - an if else block we only want to restart
10:20 - the game when lives is greater than zero
10:23 - that is we still have some lives left
10:26 - however if we are out of lives then it's
10:29 - game over dudes so to handle this we'll
10:33 - introduce a broadcast
10:36 - with a new message of
10:38 - game over
10:41 - great so this broadcast wants to cause
10:44 - the words game over to appear on the
10:46 - screen the best way to do this is with a
10:48 - brand new sprite i'll name it splash
10:51 - screen because we'll reuse it for any
10:54 - large in your face messages or splash
10:56 - screens later on
10:57 - now the first costume let's name it game
11:01 - over i'll leave it up to you to draw
11:03 - these words in any way you like mine
11:05 - will be nice and big and i'm adding the
11:07 - text twice layering one on top of the
11:10 - other with the background one having a
11:12 - thick border to give that text a clear
11:14 - outline
11:15 - that looks pretty cool we just need to
11:17 - trigger it off the game over event
11:20 - start with a when flag clicked to hide
11:23 - the game over message when the game
11:24 - starts
11:27 - and then
11:28 - when i receive game over
11:33 - we'll just quickly position the message
11:36 - with a go to xy of zero zero
11:40 - switch to the game over costume
11:44 - just in case
11:45 - and go to front layer to bring the
11:48 - sprite to the foreground
11:49 - and then finally we can show it
11:52 - and it's testing time
11:53 - bear with me as i just lose three
11:55 - precious lives
11:57 - two
11:58 - one
11:59 - zero fantastic the game has ended and we
12:02 - know it this adds much more playability
12:04 - to our game and suddenly we have the
12:06 - risk of losing all our progress
12:09 - cool
12:10 - right so what happens next
12:13 - our eager players are now hooked and
12:15 - want to try again
12:17 - do we force them to click the green flag
12:20 - oh no no rude we should add in a nice
12:23 - big button inviting them to play again
12:26 - okay we're still in the splash screen
12:28 - code after we've shown the game over
12:30 - costume we want another broadcast block
12:35 - this time with a new message of and this
12:37 - is a little forward thinking
12:39 - main menu
12:41 - our main menu will include the button to
12:43 - restart the game so this will serve as
12:45 - well
12:47 - for this we'll need a new sprite and
12:49 - we'll name it main menu
12:54 - the first costume we'll name
12:56 - play button
12:59 - starting with some simple text
13:01 - play
13:02 - now i need a button around the text a
13:05 - rectangle
13:07 - no let me show you a trick for drawing
13:09 - rounded buttons start by drawing a
13:12 - circle hold shift while drawing it to
13:14 - keep it perfectly circular
13:17 - now zoom in and switch to the shaping
13:20 - tool
13:21 - you can see the circle has four points
13:23 - around its edge by default
13:25 - still with the shaping tool carefully
13:27 - click either side of the first point to
13:29 - create two new points
13:32 - then click the middle one and delete it
13:35 - we can do the same with the bottom point
13:40 - now here's the fun part now i just need
13:43 - to move the text away from our circle to
13:45 - do this
13:46 - okay so with the shaping tool again
13:48 - click the circle to make sure the points
13:50 - are visible
13:51 - and we're going to drag a selection box
13:53 - from the top center of the circle to
13:55 - surround the three rightmost points of
13:58 - the circle
13:59 - now watch this with the three points
14:02 - selected i can drag any one point and
14:05 - all three points will move together
14:07 - letting me stretch the circle out in a
14:09 - really cool way
14:10 - but if while dragging i hold shift i can
14:13 - keep it nice and straight and yeah this
14:16 - is looking like a cool button right
14:19 - so i'll just snap it to the center of
14:21 - the canvas and plonk my text in the
14:23 - middle
14:26 - excellent we are on let's code the game
14:29 - over sprite has broadcast the main menu
14:31 - event so add in a when i receive block
14:34 - and trigger it off the main menu event
14:37 - just add a tiny delay a weight of 0.1
14:40 - seconds and now we can follow this by a
14:43 - go to front layer block and be sure that
14:45 - it will move us right the very front of
14:47 - whatever might have come before it
14:50 - then simply show the button great
14:53 - we should position it on the stage
14:54 - somewhere down here to be under the game
14:57 - over message
14:58 - then drop in a go to xy we can even it
15:02 - up by setting the x to zero
15:04 - gosh we're almost there we should just
15:07 - ensure this button is not visible when
15:09 - the project starts
15:10 - when flag clicked hide
15:13 - splendid run the project losing my lives
15:19 - and
15:20 - that looks okay the button is perhaps a
15:23 - little low down hold on just fix that
15:29 - better
15:30 - before we make this button clickable
15:32 - let's spruce things up a little bit more
15:34 - with some hovering effects it's nice to
15:36 - see the button react to my mouse moving
15:38 - over it
15:39 - drop in a forever loop
15:45 - then we will continually check using an
15:47 - if else block whether the button is
15:49 - touching the mouse pointer
15:51 - when it is we want the button to grow
15:54 - so change size by
15:59 - we want the button to grow until it is
16:00 - sized at 110 we can work out how much it
16:03 - needs to grow to get there and then
16:05 - change the size by a small amount of
16:07 - that each frame to animate it getting
16:09 - bigger
16:10 - use a multiply and on the right a
16:12 - subtract
16:14 - to work out the difference in size we
16:16 - place the current size on the right and
16:18 - then the size we want on the left that's
16:20 - 110.
16:22 - that tells us how much we need to grow
16:24 - to get to the full 110
16:26 - to give us a fraction of that amount we
16:28 - multiply by say 0.2 that's one-fifth of
16:32 - the difference each time around the
16:34 - loop a quick test by clicking on the
16:37 - script and then watch me hover over the
16:39 - button
16:40 - nice it grew very smooth now we just
16:44 - need it to shrink back down again when
16:46 - we leave it alone
16:47 - duplicate the change script into the
16:49 - else block and we want a target size of
16:52 - 100 to return the button to its regular
16:54 - size
16:55 - there we go
16:56 - now we can play with this button all we
16:58 - like it's great
17:00 - you know what would be super cool try
17:03 - setting the size to just 10 here when we
17:06 - first show the sprite
17:08 - now watch as i click the main menu
17:10 - script to run it
17:11 - how cool the button now has an entrance
17:14 - zoom effect for free
17:16 - great so let's make this button
17:18 - clickable
17:19 - easiest way is to trigger off a when
17:21 - this sprite clicked hat block
17:25 - the actions we need to trigger are first
17:27 - to hide this big button
17:30 - and then we need to broadcast to restart
17:32 - the game we don't have anything for this
17:34 - yet so a new message called start game
17:37 - is a good choice
17:40 - so how do we link this to the game
17:42 - startup code
17:44 - click into the player sprite and find
17:46 - the when green flag clicked script
17:49 - here we are this is where the game
17:51 - begins and everything is set in motion
17:53 - but now we want to be able to restart it
17:56 - from our own event with a when i receive
17:59 - start game receiver
18:01 - and we'll simply move the green flag
18:02 - scripts under this new receiver instead
18:05 - now we mustn't forget this green flag
18:07 - event though we might use a broadcast
18:10 - start game to move straight into the
18:11 - game as before after the green flag is
18:14 - clicked but now that we are delving into
18:16 - main menus it would be really cool if we
18:19 - added a proper title screen to our game
18:22 - so broadcast main menu
18:25 - this means when we click the green flag
18:27 - up pops our play button yay that's so
18:30 - cool and look if we click it the game
18:32 - begins super
18:34 - just test to make sure that the play
18:36 - button reappears when we lose all our
18:38 - lives
18:40 - yep game over and the play button
18:42 - returns and this pattern should repeat
18:45 - over and oh hold on we have a problem
18:48 - the game over message is still visible
18:50 - when we restart the game shocking but
18:54 - easy to fix head over to the splash
18:56 - screen sprite we just need a when i
18:59 - receive start game hat block
19:04 - and we hide this sprite
19:08 - cool back to business i think you'll
19:11 - agree that we need to work on the
19:13 - initial screen of our game a play button
19:16 - alone is not the title screen we were
19:18 - hoping for i'm planning to reuse the
19:21 - splash screen sprite to show
19:24 - her splash screen of course gosh you
19:26 - might be forgiven for thinking that i
19:28 - plan this in advance
19:30 - so still within the splash screen sprite
19:33 - make a new costume naming it main menu
19:36 - or perhaps title screen would have been
19:38 - better but no matter i'll fill the whole
19:41 - screen with a filled rectangle as a
19:43 - background and then quickly design a
19:45 - title screen for my game
19:47 - don't forget to leave space for the play
19:49 - button at the bottom
19:51 - of course you guys can arrange this any
19:53 - way you like to make it look great with
19:55 - your own game designs
19:57 - okay here we go what do you think not
20:00 - too shabby so back to the code we need
20:03 - to make this title screen visible as the
20:05 - game starts up
20:07 - we'll duplicate the game over scripts
20:09 - here
20:10 - just be careful to remove the broadcast
20:12 - main menu from the bottom we're going to
20:14 - trigger this from the green flag script
20:17 - here so it will only appear when the
20:19 - game starts
20:20 - remove the hide block and drag the
20:22 - scripts together
20:24 - we just need to replace the game over
20:25 - costume with our main menu costume
20:29 - fantastic that's done so smash the green
20:32 - flag so we can test this out
20:35 - and this looks promising and the button
20:37 - sits well on the title page
20:39 - click the play button to start the game
20:41 - this is all working great continue
20:44 - testing for the game over screen
20:53 - brilliant
20:54 - but watch out we have a horrible bug
20:58 - lurking just out of sight because i have
21:00 - the scratch add-ons web browser
21:02 - extension installed i can see the number
21:04 - of clones that have been created by this
21:07 - project and it's reading how many 99 oh
21:11 - no that should not be anything like that
21:15 - high run the project again with the
21:17 - green flag
21:18 - there i start with just nine clones at
21:21 - this point
21:22 - so when does this all go wrong well all
21:25 - is fine until we are on the game over
21:27 - screen
21:28 - and then click the play button
21:31 - boom 99 clones that is not good
21:36 - the only clones we are creating in our
21:38 - project are the collectibles so come
21:40 - into the collectibles sprite
21:43 - here is the setup event receiver it
21:45 - creates all the collectible clones for
21:47 - the level so what's wrong with this
21:50 - well nothing for the first time the
21:52 - project runs but the second time around
21:54 - after the game over screen is displayed
21:57 - that is where things are getting
21:58 - problematic the reason is that the event
22:01 - receiver to set up clones is received by
22:03 - all sprites and clones of sprites within
22:06 - this receiver and the second time we
22:08 - play the game we already have lots of
22:10 - collectible clones left over
22:12 - each clone will therefore receive this
22:15 - setup event and each one will create a
22:18 - whole level more of collectibles wow
22:21 - overload
22:22 - so to fix this we need to make sure to
22:25 - clear down all of these clones before
22:27 - the game starts up again
22:30 - bring in a when i receive block right at
22:32 - the top and we'll add a new message
22:35 - named reset game
22:39 - and all we need to do is delete this
22:41 - clone
22:43 - when this is broadcast all the clones
22:45 - will go away
22:46 - we should broadcast it from the player
22:48 - sprite
22:52 - under the when i receive start game
22:54 - script bring in a broadcast and wait
22:57 - block
22:58 - triggering the reset game event
23:01 - and we insert this before the setup
23:04 - broadcast
23:05 - that sounds good to me shall we test it
23:08 - out
23:10 - just a second
23:14 - right we're back on the game over screen
23:16 - now with nine clones
23:18 - you may have more or less depending on
23:20 - how many collectibles you've cloned
23:22 - and now hold on to your mice we click
23:26 - the play button
23:28 - phew
23:30 - we did it still just nine clones what a
23:33 - relief disaster averted cloning bugs
23:36 - like that are really common and it's
23:38 - good to understand why they happen yeah
23:41 - clones creating clones always a danger
23:43 - when combined with broadcasts
23:45 - but wow hasn't this episode been another
