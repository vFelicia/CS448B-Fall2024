00:03 - scratchers you may have seen my previous
00:05 - tutorial amazing health bars where we
00:08 - created each Health level using its own
00:10 - costume but so many of you wanted more
00:13 - asking how can we create a health bar
00:15 - with a beautiful fluid animation from
00:18 - Full to empty without those predefined
00:21 - steps and it just so happens I know a
00:24 - really cool trick to achieve just that
00:26 - before you ask no it's not using pen
00:30 - because then we wouldn't be able to
00:31 - layer our health bar over other Vector
00:33 - Sprites like this and we want this
00:36 - looking super crisp and high-res at all
00:39 - times yes this looks sweet so how's it
00:43 - done and this is clever the health bar
00:46 - is simply made up of two Sprites the
00:49 - base costume is a fixed half full health
00:52 - bar layered on top of that we have
00:55 - another half bar and this one we slide
00:58 - left and right when combined with the
01:01 - lower bar this can gives us a flexible
01:03 - 50 to 100 health bar how cool is that
01:07 - but how do we explain the lower half
01:10 - well now once we reach the halfway mark
01:13 - we cunningly switch from a half full bar
01:16 - costume to half an empty bar costume and
01:20 - with this we continue sliding it down
01:22 - over the remaining base health bar
01:24 - literally blanking it out as we go
01:26 - brilliant so stay tuned as I guide you
01:30 - through the coding process but in
01:32 - essence you should have got the gist I
01:35 - really like this technique as it only
01:36 - requires three costumes to accurately
01:39 - reproduce any level of Health the base
01:41 - the empty and the full costumes plus
01:44 - because this health bar is costume based
01:46 - we can decorate and enhance it to fit
01:49 - any game genre like those you might see
01:51 - in today's video sponsor rage Shadow
01:54 - Legends I've always had a soft spot for
01:56 - great looking games on this mobile game

03:25 - Okay so we've covered the theory if you
03:28 - want to go away and try to work out the
03:29 - scripts yourselves then wonderful take a
03:32 - moment to smash the like button on my
03:33 - video first and then come back to watch
03:35 - the rest of the video later otherwise
03:38 - let's just Breeze through how I went
03:40 - about it right now guys let's get
03:44 - scratching start a new project now we're
03:47 - keeping the scratch cat Sprite today but
03:49 - let's make it draggable on the stage
03:52 - when green flag clicked and set drag
03:55 - mode to draggable and that's in the
03:57 - sensing category I'm not sure why and
03:59 - now we can drag the cat around in full
04:02 - screen mode nice
04:04 - next let's define how much health our
04:07 - cat has make two new variables for this
04:09 - Max health
04:11 - for all Sprites this is how much health
04:14 - our cat has when they are full I'm going
04:17 - to set this to 200. loads of Health the
04:21 - next variable we need is the actual
04:23 - Health variable so call that Health
04:26 - again for all Sprites and set Health to
04:31 - Max health
04:32 - so they begin fully charged lastly right
04:36 - click the health variable reporter and
04:38 - change it to a slider this will make
04:41 - testing nice and easy we just need to
04:43 - set the slider range to be from 0 to 200
04:47 - that matches our Max Health great I'll
04:51 - name this Sprite player and we can move
04:54 - on to create the health bar itself
04:56 - create a new Sprite naming it health bar
05:01 - okay so drawing this health bar is
05:04 - actually probably the hardest part of
05:06 - this process because to make sure
05:08 - everything lines up and overlaps we have
05:11 - to be super accurate so take your time
05:14 - and don't worry if it takes a few tries
05:16 - to get it right to make lining things up
05:18 - easier I'm going to switch to bitmap
05:21 - mode then Zoom right in close
05:25 - and with the rectangle tool and a solid
05:28 - black fill
05:29 - count six squares to the left of center
05:33 - and one square up
05:36 - and being super careful that it is
05:38 - perfectly aligned draw the rectangle so
05:42 - that it continues another six squares to
05:44 - the right and one down of Center
05:48 - take the time now to double check your
05:50 - box edges are perfectly in line with the
05:52 - background grid if not you'll have to
05:54 - make adjustments
05:56 - cool this next bit is more fiddly now
06:00 - with a red fill I'm going to use the
06:03 - brush tool at size 2. to just Mark the
06:07 - edge of this costume this is a size
06:09 - guide if you need it but when you get
06:12 - used to using scratches paint editor you
06:14 - may not need to do that at all
06:15 - and so with the solid rectangle tool we
06:19 - draw the inside bar leaving that same
06:22 - one pixel border all the way around
06:25 - we need to stop exactly at the halfway
06:28 - point here wow I wish we had some
06:31 - scratch drawing tools to help us line
06:33 - this all up
06:34 - right with that done I'll just delete
06:37 - that little square
06:39 - beautiful let's name this costume base
06:43 - so this needs just a few scripts to
06:46 - position it correctly above the player
06:48 - Sprite I know you guys don't need me for
06:50 - this bit when flag clicked set costume
06:53 - to base
06:55 - set size to
06:57 - 300 for this video but set this to any
07:00 - size you want
07:01 - and then we want it to go to front of
07:04 - the other Sprites so go to front
07:07 - and then to ensure it moves with the
07:09 - player forever
07:11 - go to
07:13 - player
07:14 - of course we don't want this plonked
07:17 - right on top of the player like this so
07:19 - add in a change y by 70.
07:23 - that's better
07:25 - next up we need that funky sliding
07:28 - Health Sprite come back into the health
07:30 - bars costume editor and duplicate the
07:34 - bass costume
07:36 - then with the selection Marquee tool
07:39 - carefully select and delete the right
07:42 - hand half of the costume
07:44 - I just hit the delete key to delete it
07:47 - then do the same for the leftmost edge
07:50 - too
07:51 - right we'll come back to this but for
07:53 - now duplicate the costume again
07:56 - this costume needs moving a full costume
07:59 - width to the left and this is not a mean
08:02 - feat what I would recommend is again
08:04 - using the brush to paint a marker where
08:07 - the current costume ends and then use
08:10 - the Marquee tool select and drag the
08:12 - main costume over to the left making
08:14 - sure to hold the shift key down whilst
08:16 - dragging to keep the costume on a
08:19 - perfect horizontal level and drop it
08:21 - lined up with that dot
08:24 - nice remove the dot and we should be
08:27 - able to switch back and forth and
08:29 - confirm it's all lined up correctly
08:31 - okay the hard work is over phew let's
08:35 - name the costume full
08:37 - and clicking back into our second
08:39 - costume
08:40 - we can fill this pure black
08:44 - because this costume is our empty
08:46 - costume great
08:49 - so you may have guessed we are going to
08:52 - use a clone to make the sliding health
08:53 - bar rather than a separate Sprite drop
08:56 - in the create clone of myself just
08:58 - before we begin the forever Loop and
09:00 - then when I start as a clone
09:03 - we can duplicate the same forever Loop
09:06 - up here so both health bars are doing
09:08 - the same thing one in front of the other
09:11 - now a clone is always created one layer
09:15 - behind the Sprite that created it so it
09:19 - makes sense for the Clone to be the base
09:21 - health bar in which case we'll drop a
09:24 - switch costume to full just after
09:27 - creating our clone so that the first
09:29 - Loop is now handling the sliding top bar
09:33 - if we smash the green flag you'll see
09:35 - that we have managed to position the
09:37 - sliding Sprite way off to the left don't
09:40 - worry this was intentional to get it to
09:43 - full health we just need to slide it a
09:46 - full health bars width to the right
09:48 - in which case we need to know exactly
09:51 - how wide our health bar actually is
09:54 - checking in the costume editor it's 48
09:58 - pixels but that is the width including
10:01 - the black outline on either side the
10:04 - inside rectangle is therefore 2 pixels
10:06 - smaller bringing that down to 46 pixels
10:09 - in width
10:10 - we'll make a new variable to store the
10:13 - width in naming it width for this Sprite
10:17 - only and we'll set width to the 46
10:20 - pixels
10:21 - but don't forget we've set the size of
10:24 - our Sprite to 300 percent that's three
10:26 - times bigger we need to do the same to
10:29 - this width variable the Sprite size
10:32 - divided by
10:35 - 100
10:37 - is three cool so multiply 46 by that to
10:43 - get the full width of the health bar on
10:45 - the stage that's 138.
10:48 - so change X to move the floating health
10:51 - bar to the right
10:53 - by The Wiz
10:55 - oh I changed the costume when I went
10:58 - into the editor uh click the green flag
11:00 - to reset everything
11:02 - and there we've got our full health bar
11:04 - at last nice work
11:08 - but full health is only the first step
11:10 - now we want this to slide back to the
11:13 - left as the actual Health variable is
11:16 - decreased towards zero to make that
11:18 - easier we'll introduce a new variable
11:20 - naming it percent for this Sprite only
11:23 - rather than having a health from 0 to
11:26 - 200 will represent it as a number from
11:29 - zero to one we can do this by setting
11:32 - percent to the result of dividing the
11:35 - player's current health
11:37 - by their Max health
11:40 - if we run that now you'll see that at
11:42 - full health percent is one and at no
11:44 - Health percent is zero great because all
11:48 - we then need to do is Alter this change
11:50 - X multiplying with
11:53 - by this percent
11:58 - if we run that now you can see how
12:01 - bringing the health bar towards the
12:03 - midpoint correlates to the midpoint of
12:05 - the actual health bar so cool but any
12:09 - further and disaster the bar overflows
12:13 - the bottom of the bar and looks really
12:14 - really weird but if all is well all we
12:18 - need to do is switch our costumes over
12:20 - at this point to the empty bar costume
12:23 - if else
12:25 - and we need to check we are below half
12:27 - Health that's when percent is less than
12:31 - 0.5 half Health drop a switch costume
12:36 - into both sides
12:38 - and if they are less than half Health
12:40 - then switch to the empty costume to
12:44 - start removing now from the health bar
12:46 - otherwise leave the costume on the full
12:48 - costume as that already worked great for
12:51 - the upper part of the health bar
12:53 - we can now drop that in just after we
12:55 - set the percent here
12:57 - okay then we are good to give this a try
13:01 - things are looking good as we drop the
13:03 - health down and even past the halfway
13:06 - mark yes that is now working amazingly
13:09 - do you see that the empty costume is
13:12 - surely doing its job
13:14 - and we could drag the cat and everything
13:16 - stays perfectly in sync I just love that
13:19 - you know one last touch is to cycle the
13:22 - color of the bar from green to Orange
13:24 - and to red as the health decreases you
13:26 - don't need to do this but just in case
13:28 - here is how I did it both the bass
13:31 - Sprite and the Clone need to be
13:32 - positioned these scripts and then both
13:36 - change color so let's make a new custom
13:39 - block naming it position bar and run
13:43 - without screen refresh
13:45 - and take our top three blocks from the
13:48 - main forever Loop go to player change y
13:50 - by 70 and set sent
13:52 - the rest can stay in the main Loop but
13:55 - move these three blocks under the new
13:57 - defined block
13:58 - a position bar block can then of course
14:00 - be placed back at the top of the main
14:02 - Loop
14:03 - okay so the second forever Loop is doing
14:05 - the same job as our Define here so
14:07 - replace those two with a position bar
14:10 - block
14:11 - we can sanity check it still works
14:14 - yeah great so now since both Sprites are
14:17 - using the same script we can set the
14:20 - color in here to affect both Sprites at
14:23 - once
14:23 - set color effect to
14:26 - and we multiply percent
14:31 - with 50 because this should take us all
14:35 - the way from Red through to Green
14:38 - yeah that looks excellent and what's
14:41 - more as we Slide the health variable
14:43 - down the color changes back towards red
14:46 - pretty sweet right
14:49 - so we are done pretty much but this
14:53 - clever approach does have a couple of
14:55 - snags firstly if I just shift this bar
14:58 - around a little somewhere around here ah
15:02 - look where did this line suddenly appear
15:04 - from nasty you may not see this on your
15:08 - project but it's caused by me zooming my
15:10 - web browser larger to make this video
15:13 - things just don't always quite line up
15:15 - as expected in scratch the only fix I
15:18 - can suggest is to add a tiny half pixel
15:21 - bit of red to the right of the base
15:23 - costume
15:26 - you'll see that straight away fixes the
15:28 - Gap problem but when we reduce the
15:30 - health we now see that extra bit of bar
15:33 - on the right so to fix that we come into
15:36 - the empty costume and expand the Black
15:39 - by half a pixel to the right also
15:42 - and that that pretty much does it
15:46 - but there is a second issue and that is
15:49 - the Sprite fencing as we move off screen
15:53 - the floating bar gets left behind
15:56 - ugly like an ugly thing we fixed that in
16:00 - one of the usual ways in the costume
16:02 - editor make a new costume and draw a
16:05 - large rectangle
16:07 - name the costume big
16:09 - then back in the code we simply swap to
16:12 - the big costume before we position the
16:14 - bar
16:15 - that will let us move further off screen
16:17 - and right away we are switching back to
16:20 - the desired costume anyway so all should
16:22 - be good give that a try if you don't
16:24 - believe me
16:25 - see bug squashed great isn't it amazing
16:30 - what you can do with a little clever
16:32 - scripting and careful costume drawing
16:34 - and don't think you have to finish there
16:36 - you can Spruce things up even further
16:38 - try adding another layer like this
16:41 - or vertical gradient fill whatever you
16:44 - want to try but for now that is about
16:47 - all we have time for today if you've
16:50 - enjoyed the video please smash that like
16:52 - button and don't forget to subscribe to
16:54 - the channel so as not to miss my next
