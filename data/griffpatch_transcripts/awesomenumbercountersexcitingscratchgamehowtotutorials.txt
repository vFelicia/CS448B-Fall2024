00:02 - hello fellow scratchers have you made a
00:05 - great scratch game but felt it was let
00:07 - down by using scratch's built-in
00:09 - variables for the score or timer
00:11 - yeah we've all been there well worry no
00:14 - more because today i will be showing you
00:16 - how we can dispense with those and
00:18 - replace them with something a lot more
00:21 - awesome oh yeah come on the concept is
00:24 - pretty straightforward we need to have
00:26 - the digits 0 through 9 as costumes of
00:29 - our sprite and then we add a little code
00:31 - in to handle the rest and that's what
00:33 - i'm here for so guys without delay
00:36 - let's get scratching
00:39 - we'll begin with a fresh new project and
00:42 - quickly mock up a simple clicker game we
00:45 - just need a score variable for all
00:47 - sprites
00:48 - there it is
00:50 - and then when this sprite is clicked
00:54 - we change score by
00:56 - one wow
00:58 - this is about as basic as it gets right
01:01 - we click our cat and the score increases
01:05 - job done
01:06 - but gosh it would all look so much
01:08 - better without this boring generic
01:11 - variable reporter it's so small and
01:13 - uninspiring i mean we could double-click
01:16 - the score on the stage to change how it
01:18 - looks that's a tad better but it hardly
01:21 - adds to the excitement of me clicking
01:23 - the cat
01:24 - no what we really want is for the score
01:27 - to be large colorful in your face and
01:30 - really funky the only way we can
01:32 - currently do this is by using sprite
01:34 - costumes
01:36 - well alrighty then we'll start by making
01:40 - a new sprite
01:41 - i'm giving mine the name score
01:45 - click to choose a new costume from
01:46 - scratch's library and search for glow
01:50 - now you notice there's a whole costume
01:53 - font already made for us well that's
01:55 - handy choose the zero digit first
01:58 - so that looks pretty cool much more
02:00 - exciting than a variable reporter
02:03 - now we need to import the other nine
02:05 - digits one costume at a time i've copied
02:08 - the word glow into my clipboard so that
02:10 - i can paste it into the search box and
02:12 - save time
02:13 - however don't feel you are stuck using
02:15 - this particular font the tutorial will
02:17 - work just fine if you want to draw your
02:19 - own
02:20 - that would be super fun and would make
02:22 - your project unique to you
02:24 - phew i've imported all 10 costumes 0
02:28 - through 9.
02:30 - let's center the costume on the stage
02:32 - just move the score variable reporter
02:33 - out of the way first
02:35 - yeah that looks great now we just need
02:38 - to figure out how to make the beautiful
02:40 - new digit display the same number shown
02:42 - in the variable reporter
02:45 - often a problem is not so hard to solve
02:48 - if you can first break it up into
02:50 - smaller problems and then solve these
02:52 - smaller problems one at a time
02:54 - rather than tackling the whole score of
02:55 - 117 then we'll begin by looking at just
02:58 - the first digit the character one
03:01 - come into the code tab of our score
03:03 - sprite
03:05 - let's start by setting up our sprite
03:07 - when green flag clicked go to x y
03:11 - the current position of the score sprite
03:13 - is pre-populated for us great
03:16 - to help explain what we are doing i'll
03:18 - bring in a say block from the looks
03:20 - category and for now simply say the
03:23 - value of the variable score
03:25 - hit the green flag to run the project
03:27 - and we'll see the full score of 117
03:30 - displayed
03:31 - but for now we only want to deal with
03:33 - the first digit of this longer number
03:36 - luckily we can get the first character
03:38 - using the letter of block this is ever
03:41 - so useful just plug in the score
03:43 - variable and
03:46 - yay out pops the first digit only the
03:49 - one just as we hoped
03:51 - right that was the first hurdle now we
03:54 - need to translate this into a costume
03:57 - the costume for a digit of one
04:00 - look in the costume tab
04:02 - see how all the costume names begin with
04:04 - the word glow and a hyphen and then the
04:07 - single digit the costume represents like
04:09 - a 0 1 2 etc well that makes selecting
04:13 - the right costume super easy all we need
04:16 - to do is join together the word glow
04:18 - with a hyphen with a digit we want
04:21 - so back in the code and pull in a join
04:24 - operator
04:26 - on the left we enter the word glow
04:28 - hyphen ensuring to keep the uppercase g
04:31 - and then on the right drag in the letter
04:33 - one of score
04:35 - do you see what this is doing put it all
04:38 - back into the say block and run the
04:39 - project and now you can see we've
04:42 - managed to construct the full name of
04:44 - the costume glow hyphen one
04:46 - great so instead of saying the costume
04:49 - name toss in a switch costume block
04:52 - and move the join in there
04:54 - the old say block can go
04:56 - awesome let's give it a test
05:00 - yes as long as you match the costume
05:02 - name exactly including the uppercase and
05:04 - lowercase letters you should find that
05:06 - the costume has switched to the correct
05:08 - one it's worth trying it with some other
05:11 - score values just to make perfectly sure
05:13 - it's working as expected
05:15 - and of course i can click on the cat and
05:17 - the score variable goes up but i do
05:19 - still need to click the green flag
05:21 - afterwards before this large digit
05:23 - updates
05:26 - now once the score increases to 10 and
05:28 - above well we come undone because we
05:31 - need to look at the next part of this
05:33 - tutorial increasing the number of digits
05:36 - displayed
05:37 - to accomplish this we will need to make
05:39 - copies of the first digit sprite and for
05:42 - this we shall use clones
05:44 - bring in a repeat block to surround the
05:46 - switch costume
05:48 - now for starters we'll have 4 clones so
05:51 - enter four in the repeat loop
05:54 - after switching costume create clone of
05:56 - myself
05:58 - but before we loop around and continue
06:00 - creating more clones to prevent all the
06:02 - digits being cloned on top of each other
06:05 - we need to move this sprite out of the
06:07 - way to the right
06:09 - change x by
06:11 - ah we don't know how far to move it the
06:15 - size of the numbers will change
06:17 - depending on our costume and also the
06:19 - current size of the sprite a size of 200
06:22 - will need twice as much room for each
06:23 - digit
06:24 - right then let's experiment try moving
06:27 - right by the size reporter of the sprite
06:30 - itself that would move 100 pixels when
06:33 - we are at the size of 100
06:35 - right well it's good to see the clones
06:37 - are appearing but these digits are far
06:40 - too spaced out in fact we could fit one
06:42 - digit in between each of these clones
06:45 - that's actually quite a useful measure
06:47 - perhaps we should just half the distance
06:49 - we are traveling
06:51 - change x by half the distance then that
06:54 - is size divided by two
06:57 - give that a test
06:59 - okay yes that's looking much better so
07:02 - depending on the costume you've used in
07:04 - your project you may need to tweak this
07:06 - number two to make the spacing work for
07:08 - you so we have our clones but they all
07:11 - show the same value be it one one one
07:14 - one
07:17 - this is because each clone is still set
07:19 - up to show letter one of score what we
07:22 - need is for each clone to be assigned a
07:25 - different digit position for it to
07:27 - display the first second third letters
07:30 - of score
07:31 - but before we deal with that did you
07:33 - notice that although we have created
07:34 - four clones you're seeing five digits
07:37 - yeah that's because the last digit is
07:40 - not a clone but the original sprite we
07:42 - should deal with that first so it
07:44 - doesn't confuse things
07:46 - drop in a hide block after the green
07:48 - flag is clicked
07:49 - and then
07:50 - when i start as clone
07:54 - show
07:55 - this way only the clones will display
07:57 - right
07:58 - give that a test and there just the four
08:01 - clones are showing
08:03 - ah now we have the when i start as clone
08:06 - hat block we can move this switch
08:08 - costume over to here
08:11 - this puts each clone firmly in control
08:14 - of switching its own costume which i
08:16 - like
08:17 - but as we just noted they are all
08:20 - looking at letter one of score
08:24 - to identify which letter of score each
08:27 - clone should represent we'll make a new
08:29 - variable and name it index
08:32 - make sure to switch it to for this
08:34 - sprite only as each clone need its own
08:37 - value for this to work we begin by
08:40 - setting index to 1
08:42 - just before our repeat loop
08:46 - and then change index by 1 as the last
08:49 - instruction in our loop
08:52 - we can see this in action by bringing
08:54 - back a say block
08:57 - drop in the index variable and give that
08:59 - a run
09:01 - there see how each clone is reporting
09:04 - its own index starting at one and
09:05 - counting up so that's perfect for
09:07 - pulling out the right letter from our
09:09 - score
09:10 - simply drop the index variable into the
09:13 - letter of score block
09:14 - okay we need to test this baby out set
09:17 - score to 4321
09:19 - 4321 click it to set the value and then
09:23 - run this project
09:25 - oh
09:25 - wow yeah look at this 4321 exactly
09:28 - matching the score variable but in
09:31 - beautiful large vector letters
09:33 - so delete that say block and there we go
09:36 - so cool
09:38 - and if i click the cat to increase the
09:40 - score
09:42 - still not updating the costumes
09:44 - automatically we don't want to have to
09:46 - hit the green flag for this any longer
09:49 - no problem drop in a forever loop around
09:52 - the set costume block
09:54 - and then make sure to restart your
09:56 - project this ensures the new clone
09:58 - forever loops start running and now
10:01 - click that cat
10:05 - yes this is more like it our costumes
10:08 - are now synchronized with the score
10:10 - variable and i am loving it
10:12 - also if we double click the score
10:14 - reporter to change it to a slider
10:17 - and right click to set the slider's
10:19 - range
10:20 - setting a max value of 9999
10:24 - now we can slide this around and see the
10:26 - score tracks this too everything is
10:29 - working great
10:31 - so are we done here
10:33 - oh no no
10:34 - look what happens when the score is
10:36 - dropped down to zero
10:40 - bummer
10:41 - okay so what has happened here well the
10:45 - first digit is a zero that's correct but
10:48 - the rest
10:49 - that's a mess
10:50 - equally if i increase score to a say a
10:52 - three-digit number the first three
10:54 - digits are good but the last one
10:56 - nope
10:57 - the problem we have is that we don't
10:59 - have any sense of a blank digit what do
11:03 - i mean well look if we use the letter
11:05 - one of block with the number one hundred
11:10 - obviously we get a one back as the first
11:12 - letter and letters two and three are
11:15 - both zeros
11:16 - but what about letter four
11:18 - do you know the answer
11:21 - yeah it's blank the empty value because
11:24 - there is no fourth letter in a
11:26 - three-digit number
11:28 - well knowing this gives us power come
11:31 - into the costume editor see the first
11:34 - leftover blank costume here
11:36 - if you don't have one then don't worry
11:38 - just create a new one the order won't
11:40 - matter either so we start by grabbing
11:43 - the costume name from the other costumes
11:46 - glow hyphen
11:48 - but not the last digit
11:50 - and then we use it as the name of the
11:52 - blank costume that's right just the
11:55 - start of the name with nothing after the
11:57 - hyphen so this costume name will match
12:00 - any blank digits that is any letters
12:03 - past the end of the score
12:06 - shall we test that out
12:09 - there you see
12:10 - we are down to three digits yes the
12:12 - fourth clone is still there of course
12:14 - but it's now using that blank costume so
12:17 - we simply cannot see it
12:19 - we can drag the slider back and forth
12:21 - and clearly see this working a treat
12:23 - good job if you have got this far
12:26 - okay i can reach the number nine nine
12:28 - nine nine but what about ten thousand or
12:32 - one hundred thousand a six digit score
12:35 - well change the slider range so it can
12:38 - go to 999 999
12:40 - oh
12:41 - boy that is not good four clones gives
12:44 - us a maximum of four digits and after
12:46 - that we are in trouble
12:49 - but not an issue back in the code up the
12:52 - repeat loop from 4 to 6.
12:57 - well that sorted that now we just have
13:00 - the problem of the score trailing off
13:02 - the screen
13:03 - perhaps we'll move it over to the left
13:05 - like to here
13:06 - just enter a negative value into the go
13:08 - to x at the start here i'll try minus
13:11 - 180.
13:12 - that's not so bad it all fits now so as
13:15 - you see we can position and size the
13:17 - score in any way we want
13:19 - i'll just try different size
13:22 - hold on
13:24 - what's up with this
13:25 - scratch is refusing to let me size the
13:28 - score sprite that's confusing
13:31 - hmm let me try using a set size block
13:33 - instead set size to 50.
13:36 - run that
13:37 - no way it's still not working
13:40 - look size is still 100
13:43 - okay then i've guessed what's up and
13:45 - it's silly
13:47 - look in the costumes tab
13:49 - the selected costume is the empty
13:51 - costume and this has a size of zero by
13:54 - zero pixels and as such scratch is
13:57 - preventing us sizing the sprite down at
13:59 - all
14:00 - if we switch to any other costume before
14:03 - the set size
14:04 - then now i bet you this will work
14:06 - yes oh my word how scratch likes to test
14:10 - us right
14:11 - well at least we know how to solve that
14:13 - one now
14:15 - okay back to positioning the score
14:17 - now that it's so much smaller we could
14:19 - move it over to the right again for it
14:21 - to be more central perhaps set x to
14:23 - minus 80.
14:25 - so that looks okay for the longer six
14:27 - digit score but what bugs me is that
14:31 - when we drop down to a shorter smaller
14:33 - number well then the number looks like
14:36 - it's far off to the left of center and
14:38 - that's not so nice to look at
14:40 - indeed our number is left aligned and
14:43 - although this can be perfect for some
14:45 - layouts i would also love to show you
14:47 - how to make it center aligned as that
14:49 - can look even better when your score is
14:51 - front and center like this one
14:54 - now the way we center align text is to
14:56 - take the text we have generated find its
14:59 - full width and then move all the text
15:02 - left by half of that width and that's it
15:06 - it's centered
15:07 - to code this we are going to have to do
15:09 - a little maths
15:11 - so here are our six clones each with an
15:14 - index variable one through six
15:17 - to position them on the screen remember
15:19 - that the width of each digit for me is
15:22 - given by size divided by two
15:24 - so we could set each clone's x to index
15:28 - multiplied by
15:30 - size divided by 2.
15:32 - that would give us our letter positions
15:34 - as follows
15:36 - but notice that because sprite costumes
15:38 - are centered that the first digit
15:40 - appears offset half its width to the
15:43 - right of center
15:44 - we can fix this first by subtracting
15:47 - half from each index that will move them
15:50 - half a digit to the left
15:52 - and now to center them the length in
15:54 - digits of our number is three
15:57 - so we half three three divided by two is
16:00 - one point five
16:02 - and then we subtract this again from
16:03 - index
16:05 - okay
16:06 - not so hard
16:07 - maybe
16:08 - let's code this up
16:10 - start with the set x block
16:13 - and we need the index variable
16:16 - and a size divided by two
16:19 - these we can multiply together and plug
16:21 - into the set x block to give us an
16:23 - initial positioning
16:28 - if we run that then we get a simple left
16:30 - align position as before be it a little
16:32 - right of center
16:34 - so now for centering we subtract half
16:38 - that is 0.5 from index to allow for the
16:41 - center alignments of the costumes
16:43 - then from this we subtract the length of
16:46 - our score variable
16:50 - ah but we only want half of its length
16:53 - so bring in a divide and we want to
16:55 - divide this length by two
16:57 - there pop that back in and then the
16:59 - whole expression wants to be placed on
17:02 - the left here multiplying everything by
17:04 - size divided by two
17:06 - excellent that's quite a long sequence
17:09 - of blocks but does it work
17:12 - run the project
17:14 - nice the six digit number looks to be
17:16 - centered but we'll only know for sure if
17:19 - we try a shorter score with less digits
17:22 - down to five yes to four oh yeah
17:25 - marvellous this score is centering
17:28 - perfectly now
17:29 - just in case you wondered if you wanted
17:31 - to position this text elsewhere on the
17:33 - screen you can easily insert a change x
17:35 - by after this go to x to offset it
17:37 - elsewhere and the y you can set as
17:40 - normal
17:43 - we can also confirm it still works with
17:45 - larger sprites too
17:48 - yeah great
17:51 - now we are almost done i suggest we
17:54 - speed up the initial cloning to avoid
17:56 - any unnecessary flickering
18:00 - so make a new custom block named setup
18:04 - and we run without screen refresh
18:07 - move the entire green flag script stack
18:09 - under the new define block and then
18:11 - replace them with your new setup block
18:14 - all the digits will appear as soon as
18:16 - the project runs
18:17 - smokin
18:19 - so that's everything that i really
18:20 - needed to cover to ensure you can make
18:23 - some amazing projects with this but
18:25 - before we finish i would really like to
18:27 - also just tag on one extra thing that
18:30 - looks oh so cool
18:32 - a little animation
18:34 - find the when i start as a clone script
18:37 - we'll start by making a new custom block
18:39 - naming it change costume 2
18:42 - and then add a new text input called
18:45 - costume
18:46 - we want to use this in place of the
18:48 - switch costume block here
18:50 - so move the join into the input of the
18:53 - custom block and the actual switch
18:55 - costume can move down into our define
18:57 - change custom block
18:59 - finally link up the switch costume by
19:01 - using the costume input variable from
19:04 - the define block
19:06 - good so we've re-jigged the script but
19:08 - it does just the same thing as before so
19:11 - far
19:12 - but now within the custom block we are
19:14 - given the new costume name
19:17 - before we actually have switched to that
19:19 - costume
19:20 - this will allow us to check whether the
19:22 - costume needs to change or not
19:25 - so if not
19:27 - costume equals
19:29 - costume name
19:33 - then switch the costume
19:36 - again this does not change anything but
19:39 - it opens the door for us to take another
19:42 - action when the costume does change
19:45 - and what we'll do is set size to 120.
19:50 - if we test that you'll see only the
19:52 - change digits grow bigger
19:55 - but to complete this effect we need to
19:58 - quickly return them to their original
20:00 - sizes afterwards
20:02 - place a change size by after the set x
20:04 - in half revolut
20:06 - stop the project
20:09 - and a nice smooth size change can be
20:11 - given by multiplying with a subtract
20:15 - then place the current size on the right
20:18 - and the target size on the left
20:21 - that gives us the difference in size
20:24 - then multiply this by a fraction like
20:26 - 0.2 to slow down the animation
20:30 - and that's it we are ready to test so
20:34 - firstly drag the slider on the score
20:37 - variable
20:38 - oh man that is cool see how the letters
20:41 - pop out as they change and then sync
20:43 - back to where they belong i like that
20:46 - let's go full screen and try clicking
20:48 - the cat
20:49 - oh yeah this would make a sweet effect
20:52 - for any clicker game don't you think
20:55 - and i wonder what other special effects
20:57 - you could think of that would take your
20:59 - games to the next level and i am
21:02 - finishing now honest almost i just
21:05 - wanted to answer the question that you
21:07 - were just thinking can we extend this
21:09 - number engine to include words letters
21:12 - and symbols too
21:13 - yes yes we can simply go into the
21:16 - costume editor import the characters you
21:18 - are interested in that could be quite a
21:20 - lot of them so be warned and then you
21:23 - just set score
21:25 - perhaps we should use a different
21:26 - variable name at this point
21:28 - set score to a word like bed and then
21:32 - ah
21:33 - 401
21:35 - okay so that didn't work why not
21:38 - nah simple because costumes are case
21:41 - sensitive we need to use uppercase
21:43 - letters to match the costume name
21:45 - letters try again with b e d all
21:49 - uppercase
21:51 - and there you go we have at the start of
21:54 - a text engine exciting idea for a
21:58 - further tutorial perhaps
22:00 - and okay i've made a scratch studio for
22:04 - this tutorial you'll find a link for it
22:06 - under the video if you manage to make
22:08 - something with this tutorial or use it
22:10 - in one of your own games i'm sure you
22:12 - will then please don't hesitate to
22:14 - submit it to the studio i'd love to see
