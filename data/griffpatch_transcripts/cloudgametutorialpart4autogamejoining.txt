00:00 - hello fellow scratches I'm Griff patch
00:02 - and welcome to episode 4 of my series on
00:04 - creating multiplayer cloud games in
00:06 - scratch today's episode is entitled
00:08 - automatic game joining and to achieve
00:11 - this we will split the job into four
00:13 - parts but don't worry all four covered
00:15 - in this single episode but just make
00:17 - sure you keep with me until the end
00:18 - where we should achieve something very
00:20 - satisfying indeed if you missed parts
00:23 - one two three then I advise you go back
00:25 - and complete these first as we're going
00:27 - to continue from where we left off so
00:29 - stage one requires us to do some rather
00:31 - drastic script reshuffling so try to
00:33 - follow carefully rather than staying
00:36 - with a single sprite approach we are
00:38 - going to now draw a distinction between
00:40 - your player sprite and your opponent
00:42 - sprites the benefit of this is that the
00:45 - main player requires all the scripts for
00:47 - creating your game whereas the
00:49 - opponent's most likely only need to move
00:51 - around and change their costumes also
00:53 - there are there no clones used in the
00:56 - player sprite as there's just one for
00:58 - you so coding the main player becomes
01:01 - easier to handle let's start by
01:03 - duplicating the player sprite and we'll
01:05 - name it
01:06 - opponents click back to the first sprite
01:09 - and ensure it's named player we now want
01:12 - to remove anything that isn't to do with
01:14 - the main player scripts form this sprite
01:17 - where we used to have the setup players
01:19 - custom block bring in a board cast and
01:22 - wait for the message set up opponents
01:25 - will move up the broadcast begin and
01:28 - delete the setup players custom block
01:30 - altogether from this sprite under the
01:32 - begin receiver block stack completely
01:35 - remove everything below the first if
01:37 - statement this player sprite does not
01:39 - need to get its position from the cloud
01:41 - any longer let's change the if condition
01:44 - to be my player is greater than 0 this
01:49 - will allow our player sprite to send
01:51 - cloud data as whichever player number we
01:54 - get allocated we wrap up the cloud
01:57 - writing scripts by creating a new custom
01:59 - block send cloud data run without screen
02:02 - refresh and we'll move the setting coded
02:04 - block stack in there this makes things
02:06 - tidier now drag the new custom block out
02:09 - and place it back inside the if
02:11 - statement
02:12 - now because this player sprite is only
02:15 - bothered with positioning our main
02:16 - player we can simplify the positioning
02:18 - scripts to just use a go-to mouse
02:20 - pointer block as the first block in our
02:23 - forever loop from now on we will be
02:25 - adding any player positioning code in
02:27 - there this change also requires us to
02:30 - modify our send Cloud Data custom block
02:32 - to use expedition and y position in
02:34 - place of their mouse X and Mouse Y
02:36 - blocks we also need to switch to play a
02:39 - hash variable here with my player hash
02:42 - now let's switch over to the opponent
02:45 - sprite we don't want to be triggering on
02:48 - the green flag any longer but instead we
02:51 - will use the new when I receive set up
02:53 - opponents event in fact all we need in
02:56 - here is the setup players custom block
02:58 - so remove the rest
03:00 - let's drag in a set color effect 90 so
03:04 - we can distinguish between the player
03:05 - sprite and all the opponent clone
03:07 - sprites we could alternatively change
03:09 - the costumes themselves in the costume
03:11 - editor now that we have a player sprite
03:14 - as well as the four opponent sprite
03:16 - clones we will need to ensure we hide
03:18 - any opponent that is set to use the
03:21 - player ID that the player sprite is
03:23 - using within the begin receiver replace
03:27 - the if with an if/else block when this
03:30 - opponent player has the same player ID
03:32 - as my player ID set ghost to 100 to hide
03:37 - it otherwise we do the decoding and
03:39 - positioning as before note that we can
03:42 - delete the encoding scripts from this
03:44 - opponent sprite now let's just tidy this
03:47 - up a little bit more by adding a new
03:48 - custom block called tick and move the
03:51 - decoding and positioning scripts in
03:53 - there as always then move the tick
03:55 - custom block to where the scripts were
03:57 - taken from and now let's test I'll open
04:02 - up two windows side by side and in the
04:05 - left window I press the 1 key now see
04:08 - how you can tell which player is me by
04:09 - the color at this point did you notice
04:13 - that my player one sprite has been
04:15 - fading out while I am not moving the
04:17 - mouse remember this because we will come
04:20 - back to it shortly but before we look
04:22 - into that let's just tidy away some our
04:24 - new scripts the
04:26 - playa sprite no longer needs to be able
04:28 - to read or decode cloud data so we can
04:32 - delete the following custom blocks value
04:35 - equals cloud hash player and the begin
04:38 - decode of and finally the value equals
04:41 - read from encoded blocks and now let's
04:45 - move to the opponent sprite we can
04:48 - remove anything to do with setting cloud
04:50 - variables so delete the set cloud hash
04:53 - to value custom block the right value to
04:56 - encoded and while we're at it all the
04:59 - when key pressed hat blocks to join the
05:01 - game as these are also in the player
05:03 - sprite okay we've made it state two of
05:07 - this video where we're gonna fix the
05:08 - fading out of non moving players to
05:11 - visualize what is happening here let me
05:13 - make all the cloud variables visible now
05:16 - when a player does not move their mouse
05:18 - deposition doesn't change and therefore
05:20 - their cloud variable does not change
05:22 - either this is leading to the player
05:25 - fading away on other player screens as
05:27 - if we were no longer playing to fix this
05:30 - we need to ensure that we are always
05:32 - changing are encoded cloud variable even
05:35 - when we are not moving well something
05:38 - that it's always changing is the time so
05:41 - how about we encode this to send along
05:43 - with our data within the player sprite
05:46 - in the send cloud data custom block
05:48 - we'll arrange it to first write the user
05:50 - name and then we'll write the round of
05:54 - time at times ten timer is in seconds
05:58 - and cloud variables can only update ten
06:00 - times a second so if we multiply by ten
06:03 - and then round it then this number
06:05 - should increase by one every time the
06:07 - cloud variable is transmitted lastly we
06:10 - write the x and y position as before
06:12 - we're in a mirror these changes in the
06:14 - opponent sprite within the tick custom
06:17 - block after the begin decode we first
06:20 - read from encoded the value of the
06:22 - player name we therefore move the say
06:25 - block up here then read in the time
06:27 - value we don't do anything with this yet
06:30 - so decode the next value which is the x
06:32 - position and then finally the y position
06:34 - and now let's test again now when I join
06:38 - the game with the one key and
06:40 - still you will see that my players clown
06:42 - variable is constantly changing and the
06:44 - player no longer fades away great let's
06:47 - move on so we have this fading out
06:50 - effect but the names of the offline
06:53 - players are still visible which brings
06:55 - us to stage three of this tutorial we're
06:57 - gonna fix that and we're gonna
06:58 - completely hide the player names too in
07:01 - the opponent sprite add a new variable
07:03 - named offline and make it for this
07:06 - sprite only under the setup players
07:08 - receiver set offline to 100 this will
07:11 - signify the player is offline and hide
07:14 - the sprite in the beginning receiver
07:17 - when my player equals player hash set
07:20 - offline to 100 and hide now let's make a
07:24 - few changes to the tick custom block as
07:26 - follows when the cloud variable has not
07:29 - changed rather than fading out we now
07:32 - change the offline veil ball by one if
07:34 - the offline veil reaches a hundred then
07:37 - we hide the entire sprite this will also
07:40 - hide the name of the sprite in the
07:42 - speech bubble else if the cloud verbal
07:45 - has changed then rather than removing
07:47 - the ghost effect we now check whether
07:49 - offline is greater than 99 and if it was
07:52 - then the sprite must have been hidden
07:54 - and we show it again then after the if
07:57 - still within the else block we set
07:59 - offline back to zero to say that we are
08:02 - not offline ok let's give this a quick
08:05 - test notice as the project starts up the
08:09 - offline players no longer fade out but
08:12 - once they disappear so do their
08:14 - usernames great that's what we wanted to
08:17 - achieve and now hold on to your scratch
08:20 - blocks because this is stage 4 and we
08:23 - are going to script the auto game join
08:25 - in code itself the aim is to choose
08:28 - which player number we can be and
08:29 - therefore which cloud variable we will
08:32 - use how we are going to do this is when
08:35 - the project starts we take a look at all
08:37 - the cloud variables wait for a few
08:39 - seconds and then we take another look if
08:41 - a cloud variable has changed in that
08:43 - time then someone is already playing
08:46 - using that variable but if one of them
08:49 - is the same after that 3 seconds well
08:52 - then the game slot is my
08:54 - lightly free to use and we should claim
08:56 - it let's start by clicking into the
08:59 - stage backdrop to create some feedback
09:01 - messages for the user joining our game
09:03 - first rename the costume as blank now
09:07 - add a new backdrop named joining add a
09:10 - text message letting the player know we
09:12 - are trying to find them a place in the
09:14 - game next add a costume named full and
09:18 - this is to let them know that sadly the
09:20 - game is full and finally one more
09:22 - costume named joined this is to say that
09:25 - we have successfully joined the game
09:27 - right back to the player sprite now
09:30 - please under the setup opponents
09:33 - broadcast add a switch backdrop to
09:35 - joining immediately after this we will
09:38 - broadcast and wait a new message called
09:40 - join game next added an if/else block
09:46 - and check for my player is greater than
09:49 - zero
09:50 - this will be true if we have
09:52 - successfully joined the game so set
09:54 - backdrop to joined otherwise change the
09:57 - backdrop to full while we're in the
10:00 - player sprite we can remove all these
10:02 - when key pressed stacks as I'm happy to
10:05 - say that we're not gonna need them any
10:06 - longer and let's also delete the
10:09 - unrequired player hash variable and last
10:12 - value variable too as they are only used
10:14 - in the opponent sprite now lastly click
10:18 - into the opponent's sprite let's create
10:20 - that new receiver for join game this
10:23 - will trigger on all the opponent clones
10:26 - when the game is starting drag in our
10:29 - custom block value equals cloud hash
10:31 - with an input of player hash this gives
10:34 - us the current cloud variable for this
10:37 - opponent now to keep a record of the
10:40 - value of this cloud variable we set last
10:42 - value to the join of a and the variable
10:45 - value we wait three seconds before then
10:49 - getting the cloud variables value again
10:51 - using the same custom block finally
10:54 - compare the last value with the current
10:57 - value if they are the same then we can
10:59 - hope that this cloud veil ball is not in
11:01 - use by anyone else and we set our my
11:04 - player hash to the player number of this
11:06 - opponent clone as I said previously this
11:10 - script is run for all the opponent
11:13 - clones as they all will share the join
11:15 - game script
11:16 - therefore if any of them are not in use
11:19 - then one of those will succeed in
11:21 - setting the my player however if we go
11:24 - back and look at the player sprite you
11:26 - can see that if there were no free slots
11:29 - then my player would have remained as
11:31 - zero and we will get the message that
11:33 - the game is full right time to test is
11:37 - out first off fire up the project in my
11:39 - to scratch accounts the one on the right
11:41 - is my main grief match one on the left
11:43 - is my grief match shooter and you can
11:45 - see here that my grief patch account got
11:47 - in there with player 1 and with patch
11:49 - shooter has been assigned player 2 this
11:51 - is excellent so how about a more
11:53 - thorough test I'm going to ask some of
11:55 - my scratcher friends to join who will
11:58 - join me first then
11:59 - ah Thank You Lou ends p22 great to have
12:03 - you on this player - oh yes here is
12:06 - player three like a bow a nine this part
12:09 - is really getting going and Wow cool who
12:11 - is that
12:12 - Luke mania Studios grabbing the player
12:14 - for slot we have success we've maxed out
12:17 - all four player slots if we wait around
12:21 - now let's watch people leave
