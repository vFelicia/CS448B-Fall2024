00:00 - [Music]
00:02 - hello fellow scratchers today we are
00:05 - going to add the much anticipated
00:07 - animating World tiles to our RPG games
00:10 - animating water and campfires really
00:13 - help to bring our world to life also in
00:16 - this episode we'll take a look at
00:17 - improving our layout of the dungeon
00:19 - tiles lower down in our editor palette
00:21 - as they've always looked well let's be
00:24 - honest a bit of a mess when they should
00:27 - be looking like this so yeah we'll sort
00:30 - that out too so stay tuned for that but
00:34 - let's jump right into those animating
00:36 - tiles you may have already tried laying
00:38 - down some of these water tiles in your
00:40 - worlds but a word of warning to get them
00:43 - to animate you must select the first
00:46 - tile in the animation set that's the one
00:48 - on the left
00:50 - looks like I missed defining some
00:52 - Collision pins I shouldn't be able to
00:53 - walk over this water let me add them in
00:56 - on the first animated tile
00:58 - there we go sorted that pin editor is so
01:02 - cool
01:03 - now animating tiles how can we let
01:06 - scratch know which costumes need
01:08 - animating we could just use an if per
01:11 - tile number or make a list of tiles to
01:13 - animate but I did something a little bit
01:16 - more fun if you look at the name of the
01:19 - costume number 254 the first water edge
01:22 - costume you'll see I've added a greater
01:25 - than eight Chevron 8 to the end this
01:28 - means that the tile should be animated
01:30 - over the next eight costumes the
01:34 - following water tile has just the same
01:35 - greater than 8 added and the campfire at
01:38 - costume 427 that has a greater than five
01:42 - because well it only has five costumes
01:44 - in its animation not eight isn't that
01:47 - super easy to configure next we'll
01:49 - create a clock to keep track of which
01:51 - frames to display when we already have
01:54 - the tick variable counting up by one
01:56 - every game tick 30 times a second now we
01:59 - want one that loops around every eight
02:01 - frames
02:03 - make a new variable named tick 8 for
02:07 - this Sprite only
02:10 - set Tick 8 to
02:14 - the mod of eight animation frames and to
02:18 - slow the animation down to change
02:20 - costumes every four game ticks we divide
02:23 - tick by four
02:26 - rounding the result to the nearest whole
02:28 - number makes things clearer and drop
02:30 - that in to the left of the mod nice now
02:34 - pop that script at the top of the when I
02:36 - receive paint background receiver to
02:38 - ensure this is set before we begin
02:40 - painting the tiles
02:43 - a quick test of the project shows the
02:45 - tick 8 cycling around from 0 to 7 in a
02:48 - loop perfect
02:50 - but we mustn't forget those five frame
02:52 - campfires make another variable tick 5
02:55 - for this Sprite only
02:58 - and duplicate The Tick 8 script swapping
03:02 - tick 8 for tick 5 and modding by you
03:04 - guessed it five feel free to test that
03:07 - again and see that the second tick five
03:09 - variable also ticks up as expected
03:11 - cycling from zero to four
03:13 - so now to animate those costumes find
03:16 - the Define paint layer script and we
03:20 - need to scroll down to find the switch
03:21 - costume and stamp blocks here we need to
03:25 - check if the costume we switch to is an
03:27 - animating costume that is if the costume
03:30 - name contains a right Chevron a greater
03:33 - than symbol
03:35 - just make sure you do use the costume
03:37 - name and not the number okay
03:40 - great now this may seem
03:42 - counter-intuitive but next I'm going to
03:45 - duplicate this if nesting it within the
03:48 - first one only this time we are looking
03:50 - for the more specific greater than eight
03:53 - string instead an eight frame animation
03:56 - if it is then we switch costume to the
03:59 - correct animation frame that is the
04:02 - current costume number
04:07 - summed with the tick 8 variable
04:10 - and to account for the five frame
04:13 - animations too also check for greater
04:15 - than five and some with the tick 5
04:18 - variable perfect right you may ask why
04:22 - do I bother with this outer check at all
04:24 - it's simply for efficiency you see most
04:26 - tiles don't animate and doing one check
04:29 - first prevents us having to do the
04:31 - following two checks for most of the
04:33 - tiles on our screen making the scripts
04:35 - run faster now carefully drop the script
04:38 - in after switching costumes and before
04:41 - we actually do the stamping
04:43 - nice guys I think we are ready to test
04:46 - this baby out smash the green flag and
04:49 - find that water I'm dead excited to see
04:52 - this and here we are didn't I say this
04:54 - was going to be easy and the campfire is
04:56 - working fine too on its own shorter
04:59 - animation cycle it may be worthwhile
05:02 - quickly switching to turbo mode
05:03 - shift-clicking the green flag to see how
05:06 - fast our game engine is performing as
05:08 - you can see I can still speed around so
05:11 - we have plenty of power left over to
05:14 - continue adding to our game that is
05:16 - awesome I'll turn turbo mode back off
05:19 - right so next up we have some palette
05:23 - layout issues to attend to not only do
05:26 - we still see all the animation frames
05:28 - which would be better served hidden from
05:30 - our palette but the lower down dungeon
05:32 - tile set is not laid out as intended
05:35 - this is because while the top tile sheet
05:38 - was 18 tiles wide the dungeon tile sheet
05:41 - below was only 12 tiles wide so we
05:44 - somehow need to start wrapping this set
05:47 - around after only 12 tiles not the fixed
05:50 - 18 we are used to doing
05:53 - the easiest way to support both of these
05:55 - is to rethink the right hand palette as
05:58 - a small game map of its own to use a
06:01 - palette grid list to lay out the tiles
06:04 - in the palette any way we want the trick
06:07 - then is how to get the costumes into
06:09 - this new palette list in the first place
06:11 - now I have a little secret just like I
06:15 - already named the animating tiles so
06:17 - that we could easily pick them out with
06:19 - scripts so I also named some costumes in
06:23 - advance for helping us lay out the
06:25 - palette grid here we go costume number
06:28 - 19 is named dash dash dash 18 dash dash
06:33 - dash this is a dummy costume it's not
06:36 - used in our game and it simply means
06:38 - that the following costumes should be
06:39 - arranged in rows of 18 tiles
06:43 - so I assume we've created our new
06:46 - palette grid list and we would begin
06:48 - laying out the following costumes in
06:50 - rows of 18 tiles until we reach costume
06:54 - 270 where you'll see I've added another
06:57 - dummy costume named 12 dash dash dash
07:01 - this signals a change to the source
07:04 - Sprite sheet and that the following
07:06 - tiles should now be arranged in rows of
07:08 - 12 tiles so off we go laying out the
07:12 - tiles in Columns of 12. note that this
07:15 - will require us to pad the grid list out
07:17 - with extra blank tiles to keep the
07:19 - layout perfectly in line
07:21 - do you get the idea rather than hard
07:24 - coding scripts to do this work we can
07:26 - now code things up to build the palette
07:28 - grid directly from these costume names
07:30 - shall we give it a go yeah I'm going to
07:33 - add these new scripts at the far left of
07:35 - the tile Sprite as it will run first
07:38 - now make a new costume block scan
07:41 - costume names
07:43 - and run without screen refresh
07:46 - drop it in under the when green flag
07:48 - click script to ensure it does run right
07:51 - away
07:52 - so we'll need a grid list to store the
07:55 - palette tiles in name it palette grid
07:58 - and make it for this Sprite only since
08:00 - only the tile's Sprite needs to use it
08:03 - then delete all off palette grid to
08:06 - ensure it starts empty
08:08 - we want to begin scanning through the
08:11 - tile costumes but rather than start on
08:13 - costume 1 we'll begin on costume 10.
08:16 - I'll explain why in a moment to do this
08:18 - I use the addition block and just enter
08:20 - 10 but we could use a round or whatever
08:22 - you wanted
08:24 - next up I want to keep track of how many
08:27 - columns are expected in the current
08:29 - Sprite sheet make a new variable naming
08:32 - it palette Max or pmax for short for
08:36 - this Sprite only
08:38 - set pmax to zero until we know any
08:41 - different
08:41 - and now we repeat until
08:44 - costume number is less than
08:51 - the number we begin with 10. this will
08:55 - make sense in a moment and if else to
08:58 - check the current costume and follow
09:00 - that with our next costume block
09:03 - okay so this Loops from costume 10 all
09:07 - the way up to the last costume in our
09:09 - Sprite and then because next costume
09:12 - then Loops back to the First costume
09:14 - again at the end the costume number will
09:16 - once again be less than 10 and a loop
09:18 - will end
09:20 - great let's check for the special
09:23 - divider costume names the dash dash
09:25 - dashes if costume name contains
09:29 - dash dash dash
09:31 - okay watch out
09:33 - I used the wrong block there it should
09:36 - have been a costume name don't make the
09:39 - same mistake anyhow we'll handle the
09:42 - processing of the separator in a new
09:44 - custom block scan dash dash dash n n
09:49 - means two digits
09:51 - drop that into the if
09:53 - okay so this needs to look at the
09:56 - costume name again and pull out the next
09:59 - two digit numbers as this tells us the
10:01 - number of columns in the Sprite sheet
10:05 - set pmax to the fourth letter of the
10:10 - current costume name
10:12 - but we need the fifth letter too so set
10:15 - temp TMP to the fifth letter
10:20 - now we're going to join these together
10:22 - by setting P Max to the join of P Max
10:26 - and TMP temp it would be cool to give
10:30 - that a test somehow so temporarily drop
10:32 - in a stop all block to force the project
10:35 - to stop here and then click the green
10:37 - flag
10:39 - ah
10:40 - um so I was expecting pmax to read 18
10:43 - here but as previously stated I made a
10:47 - boo-boo looking back in my scripts yes
10:50 - here's the problem costume number should
10:52 - have been costume name
10:55 - such an easy mistake to make run the
10:57 - project again and whoop whoop a p Max of
11:00 - 18. it's joined the one and the eight
11:02 - Splendid we found the costume divider
11:05 - remove that stop or block
11:08 - the next trick is to keep track of where
11:11 - we found this divider in the costume
11:13 - numbers make a new variable name it next
11:17 - for this Sprite only
11:19 - and set next to the current costume
11:21 - number yeah I know next seems like the
11:25 - wrong name for this right now but soon
11:27 - its purpose will become more clear
11:29 - next up then we handle the costumes that
11:32 - are not separator tiles all the other
11:34 - tiles in other words and this is in the
11:36 - else Branch above
11:38 - a new custom block then scan next
11:41 - costume
11:45 - and drop it in the else
11:47 - I'll move the Define block down below
11:49 - so P Max we began by setting this to
11:53 - zero remember so if P Max is less than
11:56 - one
11:58 - then we stop this script skipping over
12:01 - this costume and not adding it to our
12:03 - palette
12:04 - next up we want to know if this is the
12:07 - first tile in a row if costume number is
12:10 - greater than next at this point the next
12:14 - variable was set to the costume before
12:16 - the current one so this is going to be
12:19 - true what we want to do then is ensure
12:21 - the palette grid is padded out with
12:23 - blank values such that we are about to
12:25 - start a new palette row will need a
12:28 - repeat
12:29 - adding empty items to pallet grid
12:34 - how many do we need to add mod
12:38 - by 18. that's the full width of our tile
12:41 - grid and on the left 0 subtract
12:46 - the length of palette grid
12:52 - hey look we can see this working pull
12:55 - out our repeat block and if we run it
12:58 - you'll see it does nothing because the
13:01 - palette list is empty so we are already
13:03 - starting a new row but if I add a few
13:07 - items and then run the script again
13:09 - you'll see that the list gets filled up
13:11 - to item 18. all padded out ready to
13:14 - begin the next palette row cool drop
13:18 - that script back into our if
13:21 - so we have the next palette row all
13:23 - lined up but after the next pmax tiles
13:26 - have been read we'll want to do the same
13:28 - again so change next by pmax
13:33 - only after we've added pmax tiles will
13:35 - this script run again to take us onto
13:37 - the next palette row great all that is
13:40 - left to do then is add the tiles to the
13:42 - palette list add to palette grid
13:46 - the current costume number yay believe
13:49 - it or not we can test that out smash the
13:52 - green flag and 630 items have been
13:55 - inserted into my palette grid list the
13:58 - first half of the list is choker block
14:00 - full but about halfway through you
14:03 - should start to find gaps appearing
14:04 - where the dungeon tiles needed padding
14:07 - out to realign them to the palette very
14:09 - promising
14:11 - so assuming this list is correctly
14:14 - populated the next step is to adapt our
14:16 - pallet stamping code to make use of the
14:18 - palette grid list find the Define paint
14:22 - palette script
14:25 - scrolling down here is where we switch
14:27 - costumes to the current palette's
14:29 - costume number gidx that is grid index
14:34 - but it would be a tad dangerous to
14:36 - change the meaning of grdx now as an
14:38 - offset into the palette grid as we've
14:40 - made assumptions Elsewhere for what this
14:42 - variable is used for instead then scroll
14:45 - up to where we first set grid index here
14:47 - and make a new variable
14:50 - palette index for this Sprite only
14:55 - and now replace the GI DX with the new
14:59 - palette index variable and now that we
15:02 - have the palette index we can set gidx
15:05 - to the item of palette grid
15:12 - palette index this can be dropped in
15:14 - within the inner repeat 5 here before we
15:17 - switch to the current palette tile
15:19 - costume of course we then need to also
15:22 - switch the change gidx for a change
15:25 - palette index so that we cycle through
15:28 - the pallet indexes and do the same for
15:31 - the second change gidx below to a
15:33 - palette index
15:35 - excellent that should do something right
15:38 - smash the green flag and see if the
15:40 - palette is looking good there it is cool
15:43 - and we can scroll around still but there
15:46 - is a problem I can't scroll to the top
15:49 - left as expected but the good news is
15:51 - that the dungeon tiles are looking a lot
15:53 - better so hmm what's up with this top
15:56 - left fencing oh guys here's the problem
15:59 - I left the pallet index being offset
16:02 - from 20. this was to skip to the first
16:05 - actual tile costume but now our grid
16:07 - lists take care of that we just need to
16:10 - begin at palette index one at the top
16:12 - left
16:13 - run that again
16:15 - and beautiful this looks much better
16:17 - scrolling down to the dungeon tiles and
16:20 - they're all there and lined up perfectly
16:22 - what's not to love let's try making use
16:25 - of a few of these tiles drop them into
16:27 - the level yeah working great how about
16:30 - the tile tracing feature using the space
16:32 - key yep that seems to be oh oh dear no
16:36 - left and right worked okay but up and
16:38 - down that doesn't work at all that's
16:40 - because we store the current brush as a
16:43 - costume number but we now need to store
16:46 - the index in our palette grid list
16:49 - make a new variable brush P idx for this
16:53 - Sprite only and when the mouse is down
16:55 - don't just set brush also set brush pidx
17:00 - palette index to the current palette
17:02 - index
17:04 - for this same reason we should also come
17:06 - down here a bit where we check whether
17:08 - this is painting the current brush ready
17:11 - to draw its little outline and rather
17:13 - than looking at the brush we now compare
17:16 - the current palette index with the
17:19 - selected brush palette index
17:21 - that will let us select even empty tiles
17:24 - in the palette grid you can see that
17:26 - working here if I click over to the
17:28 - right yeah
17:30 - okay next up we need to find the tile
17:33 - tracing scripts that's under the Define
17:35 - calculate brush position
17:38 - when we drag across the level we don't
17:40 - want to offset the brush costume now but
17:43 - the brush palette index change both of
17:46 - these and lastly we want to set the
17:49 - actual brush from this
17:51 - to item of palette grid
17:55 - and drop in the updated brush pidx
18:00 - that sounds about right so giving it a
18:03 - test
18:05 - yeah sweet we can trace in all
18:07 - directions now and the brush follows
18:09 - along I can actually begin painting the
18:12 - dungeon tiles right away so cool I
18:15 - really do look forward to exploring more
18:17 - of that in a later episode right now
18:19 - though I want to finish tidying up these
18:21 - palette Scripts
18:23 - if we come back up to the animating
18:25 - water costumes in the palette we still
18:28 - see all eight of the animation frames
18:30 - but we really only want to see the first
18:33 - ones no problem scroll right back over
18:36 - to the Define scan next costume script
18:39 - after we add a costume we want to skip
18:42 - over any animated frames we can luckily
18:45 - borrow some scripts we recently added to
18:47 - the paint layer script
18:49 - scroll down to find the check for
18:51 - costume name including a Chevron the
18:53 - greater than
18:55 - duplicate this and move it back into our
18:57 - scan next costume script of course we
19:00 - don't want the stamp or switch costume
19:02 - to Big from the bottom of there so Chuck
19:04 - those away okay so if we just added an
19:06 - animating tile we keep the first tile
19:08 - but want to skip over the rest to do
19:12 - that we just add eight no one less seven
19:16 - because we want the First costume but
19:18 - not the rest of them and if it's a five
19:21 - frame animation we skip over the
19:23 - remaining four costumes
19:26 - and we run the project look at this this
19:29 - we only see the single first costumes
19:31 - for the animating tiles so cool where's
19:34 - that campfire yep there it is what fun
19:38 - it's probably a good idea to lay down
19:40 - some real tiles and check out we haven't
19:42 - missed anything
19:45 - you do have to be careful with these
19:47 - bottom water tiles as they need to be
19:49 - placed under the edge tiles this takes
19:52 - up layers one and two so you can't place
19:54 - a tree trunk overlapping that you never
19:57 - have enough layers
19:59 - I'll just need to place the tree one
20:01 - tile lower down I guess
20:03 - and bridges over water
20:08 - but hold on hold on I have found a bug
20:10 - the E key should select the tile under
20:13 - the cursor as our current brush but that
20:16 - appears to be broken hmm we'll come back
20:20 - to that in a moment
20:21 - finishing my bridge by hand nice right
20:24 - now though we can't actually walk onto
20:26 - the bridge because the pin collisions
20:28 - are preventing us what a pain but
20:30 - something I am well aware of so don't
20:32 - worry we will fix that in a future
20:34 - episode but talking of fixes before this
20:37 - episode concludes we'll just sort a
20:39 - couple of things firstly the tile picker
20:41 - find the paint editor script at the
20:45 - bottom we test for the E key presses
20:48 - right we are setting the brush to the
20:51 - tile under the cursor but we must now
20:53 - also find the index of that tile in the
20:56 - new palette grid list set brush palette
20:59 - index pidx2 item hash of the palette
21:04 - grid and the tile we want to find is
21:07 - given by brush
21:09 - give that a test and check that the E
21:12 - key now is highlighting the correct
21:14 - tiles in our palette yes super so the
21:18 - other thing we need to fix well try
21:20 - scrolling the palette to the right that
21:23 - works great how about down to the bottom
21:25 - ah I see a problem we can no longer go
21:28 - down far enough to see all the tiles
21:30 - okay fine we need to find a Define
21:33 - scroll palette script
21:35 - and down here at the bottom we fixed the
21:38 - scrolling to the first 19 rows well now
21:41 - we know how many rows are in our palette
21:43 - grid so it's the length of palette grid
21:45 - divided by 18 of course the maximum
21:47 - number of tiles in a row
21:51 - drop that into both the palette d y is
21:54 - greater than and the set palette dy2
21:57 - blocks and we should be good to go oh
22:01 - boy yes we can go really far down now in
22:04 - fact a whole screen further than we
