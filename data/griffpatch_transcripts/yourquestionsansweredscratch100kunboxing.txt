00:01 - hello fellow scratchers we did it we
00:05 - made it to 300,000 subscribers and to
00:08 - celebrate this epic Milestone I'm
00:10 - finally going to unbox this my YouTube
00:13 - play button award and as promised I'll
00:16 - be answering your top questions in this
00:18 - special celebratory Q&A video and man
00:22 - did you guys have a lot of questions
00:24 - such as what was the first game I ever
00:27 - made even before scratch existed and
00:30 - does pineapple belong on pizza now that
00:33 - is a good one but before I unravel those
00:36 - tantalizing Mysteries I recently posed
00:38 - you guys a question why do you think I
00:41 - left it so long to open this exciting
00:43 - Black Box well with a strong majority
00:46 - 59% of you thought it was due to my fear
00:50 - of sticky tape seriously you think I
00:52 - have a fear of well yes I do who told
00:56 - you I really do hate sticky things in
00:58 - name labels sticking to my clothes
01:01 - get them away from me but as weird as
01:04 - that may be there isn't actually much
01:06 - tape on this packaging so that was a red
01:09 - herring surprisingly it was option two
01:12 - yes all along I had been planning to
01:14 - attempt to unbox this using nothing more
01:16 - than a spatula or spatulas spatula why
01:21 - hey too many questions what do you think
01:23 - this is a Q&A talking of which at the
01:26 - top of the list with a stoning 77 likes
01:29 - is this three parter by clld 21 Studios
01:33 - asking will you ever make tutorials for
01:36 - other engines or just scratch you know I
01:39 - am quite sure that I will yes having
01:41 - taught scratch for a number of years on
01:43 - YouTube I'm very aware that the majority
01:46 - of my subscribers will naturally move on
01:48 - from scratch seeking out more advanced
01:50 - platforms and yes I would love to
01:52 - continue the journey with you so let me
01:55 - reflect this back to you outside of
01:57 - scratch what would you be most excited
01:59 - to see me create tutorials 4 python go
02:02 - dot Unity drop me a comment under the
02:05 - video and let me know but gosh these
02:10 - spatular hey did I mention I play the
02:18 - drums do you have any older games pre-s
02:22 - scratch that you haven't revealed to
02:24 - your
02:25 - channel oh man as I grew up I created a
02:28 - whole bunch of cool games that I'd love
02:30 - to have shared with you guys but sadly
02:33 - they are all lost to time not making the
02:36 - transition from game console to PC
02:38 - floppy discs to CD to DVDs to hard
02:41 - drives so sad but on a happier note many
02:45 - of my old games have directly inspired
02:47 - my scratch games scratch napped tanks
02:50 - snail MMO platform and even orbital
02:53 - velocity to name just a few even then
02:56 - there are still a few games from old
02:58 - that I have yet to remake in scratch so
03:00 - maybe one of these days and perhaps by
03:03 - then I'll have finally opened this silly
03:06 - box spatulas whose crazy idea was
03:10 - that which scratch project of yours is
03:14 - your most favorite to play slither.io
03:17 - hands down if I had to limit myself to
03:20 - only playing one of my games this would
03:22 - be it because somehow it just never gets
03:24 - old I just love it playing online with
03:27 - other fellow scratchers is like amazing
03:30 - fun and it has this special gameplay
03:32 - balance where new players are not left
03:34 - overpowered by the larger snakes and you
03:37 - could choose to play it safe or head
03:38 - directly into the action and risk it all
03:40 - and man those frequent feeding frenzies
03:43 - are a real blast however uh technically
03:47 - my favorite project that I am most proud
03:49 - of would be um apple one of my most
03:51 - polished games and yeah getting over it
03:54 - technically very hard to recreate in
03:56 - scratch and I put it aside a number of
03:58 - times after each each failed attempt but
04:01 - persistence paid off and I'm dead proud
04:03 - of the final result gosh I even got a
04:05 - retweet of my post by the original
04:08 - author Bennett himself how cool is that
04:11 - right stuff that a close relative of the
04:14 - common spatula scissors now we are in
04:18 - [Music]
04:20 - business so with 63 likes here's a
04:23 - question from podcasts
04:25 - 379 why did you decide to start making
04:28 - scratch tutorials and what keeps you
04:31 - motivated well I began helping out
04:34 - scratchers on my profile very soon after
04:36 - joining scratch I got a lot of
04:37 - satisfaction from that but my follow
04:39 - account just kept growing and it became
04:42 - hard to keep up with the requests so
04:44 - instead of focusing on onetoone help I
04:47 - decided to put my efforts into making
04:49 - tutorials that I could then share with
04:51 - everyone firstly through my Griff patch
04:54 - tutor account on Scratch and then after
04:56 - I got up enough courage I moved over to
04:59 - YouTube
05:00 - and that was a huge move for me because
05:02 - I'm actually a huge introvert and have
05:04 - real trouble at living as is very
05:06 - obvious if you listen to my first video
05:10 - so let's just get uh scratchy to do
05:12 - something interesting um I'm just going
05:14 - to set him up uh to point to the right
05:18 - like he currently is well we all have to
05:21 - start somewhere right happily I worked
05:23 - on things and I pressed into my
05:25 - strengths and although it takes me a
05:27 - considerable amount of time to make a
05:29 - video
05:30 - I think they come over pretty well as
05:32 - for what keeps me motivated well this is
05:34 - just what I love to do and as long as
05:37 - you guys keep participating leaving me
05:39 - likes comments and Subs then that will
05:41 - keep this channel alive so I really have
05:43 - all of you to thank for
05:46 - that even the scissors are struggling
05:49 - with this bit of tape hold
05:52 - on there we go that's got it now this is
05:56 - exciting let's see what I've got inside
06:03 - another question with 59 likes art the
06:06 - gamer asks will you ever make a full 3d
06:10 - engine including a y level so we can
06:12 - jump and climb objects now you have seen
06:16 - my 3D laser tag gain I'm sure I shared
06:19 - it back in 2014 in the early days of
06:21 - scratch 2 and although it's not texture
06:23 - mapped it does support height we have
06:26 - stairs platforms and doorways but to
06:29 - achieve this level of performance I had
06:31 - to store the level data in Grid lists we
06:34 - can see this layout by opening the
06:36 - built-in level editor the design takes
06:39 - cues from Doom with each grid Square
06:41 - being assigned a different floor and
06:43 - ceiling height so yes I would love to
06:46 - continue to teach this in a more
06:48 - advanced raycasting tutorial and I just
06:50 - need to find the right time to do
06:54 - it now this is looking promising under
06:57 - the foam is an official letter
06:59 - and wow it's so thick like card that's
07:02 - so cool yay thank you
07:06 - YouTube O what's
07:09 - this it looks like another question this
07:12 - time from watermelon Dev yb7 YB what
07:16 - tutorial series do you have planned next
07:18 - are there any old ones you would like to
07:20 - continue oh I have so many planned off
07:24 - the top of my head a cookie clicker
07:26 - style tutorial a flappy bird that would
07:28 - be excellent for beginners and I really
07:30 - really would love to reboot my scrolling
07:32 - platformer series that was my first
07:34 - series I ever made and it's showing its
07:36 - age Good Old Scratch too right oh and I
07:39 - should also mention I want to make some
07:42 - kind of cloud shooter game too as for
07:44 - continuing old series there aren't any I
07:47 - wouldn't consider revisiting the only
07:49 - reason they pet her out is that I have
07:50 - yet to find a way to keep enough people
07:52 - engaged with the later episodes of those
07:54 - long running series that's a problem
07:57 - because this channel is funded by ads on
07:59 - videos and that is driven by the number
08:01 - of views therefore I have to make the
08:04 - videos that bring in the views it's a
08:07 - conundrum ah let me lift this out oh
08:12 - wait how do I even ah got it ooh now
08:17 - this looks so
08:19 - cool so a fun question from
08:23 - Freshies how did you find scratch and
08:26 - how long did it take to master it so I
08:29 - first encountered scratch 11 years ago
08:32 - when my kids joined a school scratch
08:34 - Club being the Curious thought I
08:36 - installed scratch on my PC yep it wasn't
08:39 - web based back then and I registered a
08:41 - new account for me and the family to use
08:44 - under the name Griff patch a patch for
08:47 - us to code in only instead I got hooked
08:51 - and the name stuck as for how long it
08:53 - took me to master it ha well anybody
08:56 - who's coded before will get off to a
08:57 - very fast start with scratch
08:59 - but scratch does have a few quirks that
09:02 - can throw even a season programmer it
09:04 - wasn't until I got to look at the
09:06 - scratch source code that things finally
09:08 - clicked and yeah I leared a few things
09:11 - then that changed forever how I went
09:13 - about coding my scratch games which
09:16 - feeds perfectly into our next question
09:18 - By Gast dude 589 asking would you be
09:22 - able to do some sort of video that
09:24 - handles General case use of scripts
09:26 - showing how to minimize lag
09:30 - yes absolutely I will and it's been on
09:32 - my mind for quite some time in some ways
09:35 - it's not that complicated but it does
09:37 - need to be set out just right to explain
09:39 - it well you know in the best Griff patch
09:42 - way but I know it's going to be a really
09:44 - cool video so make sure you have
09:46 - subscribed to this channel check the
09:48 - Bell icon and keep an eye out for
09:53 - that and here it comes the last layer
09:56 - and doesn't this look splendid presented
09:59 - to Griff patch for passing 100,000
10:03 - subscribers wow so shiny I'm just so
10:07 - honored by you guys thank you to
10:09 - everyone of my well 300,000 fellow
10:13 - scratchers that supported me thus far I
10:15 - wonder do you think we'll make it to a
10:17 - million and if so how long do you think
10:20 - it might take us ant NOS asks just
10:23 - curious have you ever discovered a
10:25 - random scratch project that looked
10:27 - better than yours
10:29 - man are you kidding all the time sure
10:33 - I've got some great projects but I get
10:35 - my enjoyment from making really fun
10:37 - projects in a cunning clever way and
10:39 - I'll often share them way way before
10:41 - they are finished I just love the
10:43 - journey you see so my projects are
10:45 - hardly ever polished or the best they
10:47 - could be no it takes a lot of dedication
10:50 - and time to finish and polish a full
10:52 - game and there are bucket loads of
10:53 - scratchers better at that than me by
10:56 - then I've often moved on to something
10:58 - new venomous snack asks are you going to
11:02 - continue the RPG series and if so will
11:04 - you add features such as shops NPCs mobs
11:07 - combat and even an optional hunger
11:09 - system I really love that RPG series too
11:13 - and I've got oodles left to share yes
11:15 - all those things you mentioned and more
11:18 - however whether I can do them all in the
11:20 - current YouTube format remains to be
11:22 - seen just because later episodes Don't
11:25 - attract new views an alternative might
11:27 - be to try crowd funding the series or
11:30 - perhaps release them through a dedicated
11:31 - membership site just floating ideas that
11:35 - could be awesome otherwise you'll just
11:37 - have to be patient and I'll work on it
11:39 - in between other things next up Cano
11:42 - weeny asks what got you into coding and
11:46 - what was your first game like if you
11:48 - want to know more about that then you
11:50 - should check out my scratch Story Remix
11:53 - linked under this video I lay it all out
11:55 - there from my Beginnings encoding at the
11:57 - age of eight on an acorn electron check
11:59 - it out and then why not tell me your
12:01 - scratch
12:02 - story just Moses 12 asks how long does
12:06 - it usually take you to make a scratch
12:09 - project gosh well it can be anything
12:12 - from a day to a few weeks but I always
12:15 - get too excited and generally release a
12:18 - first draft after a couple of days no
12:20 - matter what paper Minecraft was shared
12:22 - and then kept getting updates for a
12:24 - whole
12:26 - year syonic has two questions what keeps
12:30 - you motivated into not leaving coding
12:32 - and to keep teaching and what other
12:35 - things do you do in your free time other
12:37 - than scratch stop coding I can't even
12:40 - imagine that day coding is just such a
12:42 - joy for me as for teaching I almost love
12:45 - that as much I'll keep on doing that as
12:47 - long as there's fun topics to be covered
12:49 - outside of scratch I enjoy playing the
12:51 - guitar and piano not at the same time
12:54 - but I do love to sing along and then
12:56 - movies we love watching movies in our
12:58 - home all sorts too from old classics to
13:00 - action Adventures romcoms sci-fi dramas
13:03 - comedies animations manga and various
13:05 - series there's not much we don't enjoy
13:08 - it's super fun snail team Studios asks
13:12 - what is your favorite coding block SL
13:13 - feature in scratch now it has to be the
13:16 - custom block with its run without screen
13:18 - refresh feature that was introduced in
13:21 - Scratch 2 and that opened the doors to
13:23 - making some seriously good games and
13:25 - I'll give a special mention to the mod
13:27 - and abs blocks where would I be without
13:29 - them oh gosh I didn't think of cloud
13:32 - variables now that was a fantastic
13:34 - addition when it came in too on the
13:36 - flips side Alexander theion 1234 asked
13:40 - if there was one block you wanted to be
13:41 - added in scratch what would it be
13:45 - actually there's quite a few but perhaps
13:48 - a substring block having a really fast
13:50 - way of splitting up strings would be so
13:52 - useful but also have you seen the
13:55 - experimental text extension it's
13:57 - something I Champion many years back and
13:59 - I think it would be a game changer
14:01 - scratch team when do we get that I'm
14:04 - ready when you
14:05 - are Commander AKA asked what was your
14:09 - first project on scratch Pac-Man fochi
14:12 - wondered whether pineapple belongs on
14:14 - Pizza yes absolutely it does tfam gaming
14:18 - asked will you ever continue the ik
14:20 - spider legs devlog I really liked it I
14:24 - really hope so I love that one too only
14:26 - it turns out devlogs actually take more
14:29 - time than tutorials uh because they
14:31 - require such a lot of creative coding
14:33 - plus you need to make a video on top of
14:35 - that so yes it will return I'm sure but
14:38 - I just need to find inner peace
14:41 - first blob dude 19 asks Have You
14:44 - released any games apart from scratch
14:46 - like on Steam maybe now I have released
14:48 - a private beta on a Google app store it
14:51 - was a work in progress unity game and
14:53 - happens to be one of those games I may
14:56 - one day bring to scratch if you like
14:58 - puzzle games games then you will love
15:00 - it fite FR asked a great question how
15:04 - did you overcome
15:05 - disappointments the truth is we all have
15:08 - ups and we all have Downs life is like
15:10 - that some tasks just require
15:12 - perseverance so focus on what you're
15:14 - going to do next and keep at it also
15:16 - always try and enjoy the journey that
15:18 - way should things not turn out in the
15:20 - end you can still benefit from the
15:22 - experience you gained or even help out
15:24 - someone else who is going through the
15:26 - same problems you learn as serious lot
15:28 - from your mistakes I can tell you so
15:30 - don't get disheartened I am Sparta 7436
15:35 - says have you ever been recognized in
15:38 - public funnily enough no I have not but
15:41 - then I guess that's to be expected
15:43 - running a mostly faceless YouTube
15:45 - channel the closest I tend to get is
15:47 - when friends and acquaintances approach
15:49 - me saying you're famous after they got
15:51 - into conversations with their kids or
15:53 - their students somehow the connection to
15:55 - Griff patch is made that's always a
15:57 - laugh but no never face to face not yet
16:00 - anyhow and finally Jamie burru asks are
16:05 - you going to do a video where you play
16:07 - our scratch games now that is an
16:10 - interesting one because I would love to
16:12 - do that only if you've seen me try to
16:14 - talk while playing a game it's bad I
16:18 - don't have the gift however that's not
16:20 - to say I won't give it a go so that
16:23 - brings us to the end of this video thank
16:25 - you everyone who submitted a question I
16:27 - hope you learned something new perhaps
16:29 - you'll consider having pineapple on your
16:31 - next Pizza either way if you enjoyed
16:33 - this episode please show your
16:35 - appreciation by clicking that like
16:36 - button and subscribing to the channel so
