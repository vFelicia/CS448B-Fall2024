00:03 - scratchers welcome to part three of our
00:06 - tutorial creating an RPG game in scratch
00:09 - last week we ended on a bit of a
00:11 - cliffhanger managing to create a
00:13 - scrolling tiled map but at the expense
00:15 - of super lag but don't panic this was
00:20 - because we were painting the entire
00:21 - level each and every tick of our game
00:23 - Loop but today we are going to blow all
00:26 - those problems away and Achieve silky
00:28 - smooth scrolling goodness by
00:30 - implementing a viewport that is a
00:33 - scrolling window into the level where we
00:35 - only Stamp Those tiles that are actually
00:37 - on the screen we just need to be careful
00:40 - with our maths to ensure everything
00:42 - stays lined up and if all goes to plan
00:44 - well stick around to see what a
00:46 - transformation this will bring I'm so
00:49 - excited to get started come on guys
00:51 - let's get scratching
00:54 - load up your projects from episode 2 and
00:57 - while we're at it save them as a new
00:59 - copy for this is episode three
01:03 - we ended up setting the map size back
01:05 - down to a width and height of 32 tiles
01:07 - g-max of 32 however you will probably
01:11 - have noticed that this has issues of its
01:13 - own and we are still not able to scroll
01:15 - much further than
01:17 - yeah this
01:19 - not to worry though this too we will fix
01:21 - this episode
01:23 - so we'll Begin by clicking into the tile
01:25 - Sprite
01:26 - you can see the width and height of the
01:28 - grid of tiles being stamped is specified
01:30 - by g-max in these two repeat blocks so
01:34 - that's the entire grid width and height
01:36 - remove these so that we begin by
01:38 - reducing the view window back to 10 by
01:40 - 10 tiles
01:42 - but if we run the project now you'll see
01:45 - our level is looking rather messed up
01:47 - and that's because we are still assuming
01:49 - this tile is the one that follows this
01:52 - one and boy is this not true any longer
01:56 - to fix this we need to skip all these
01:58 - items how many is that it's a full row
02:02 - gmax subtract however any tiles we've
02:06 - already stamped so at the bottom of this
02:09 - Loop change gidx by
02:12 - and we subtract from G Max
02:17 - this number 10.
02:20 - do this right before we loop around to
02:22 - the next row
02:24 - and as if by Magic smash that green flag
02:28 - pow we are back in business but rather
02:32 - than a scrolling window into the level
02:35 - our window of tiles is not staying put
02:37 - it's just scrolling off with the tiles
02:40 - we need to keep Shifting the window back
02:43 - into view like we did with the original
02:45 - scrolling background remember how we did
02:48 - that
02:49 - where we previously subtract cam y we
02:52 - now replace it with Cam y mod 32.
02:59 - and similarly replace cam X with Cam X
03:03 - Mod 32.
03:05 - so what effect does this have on our
03:08 - running project
03:10 - what have we done this looks like a big
03:14 - step backwards Don't Panic the good news
03:18 - is that the stamped tile window is now
03:20 - staying in position and not scrolling
03:22 - away
03:23 - the bad news is that our window is
03:25 - restricted to the top quarter of the
03:27 - screen and we'll fix that later but more
03:30 - importantly we don't appear to be able
03:32 - to escape the bottom corner of our level
03:34 - no surprise there though after all we
03:37 - always begin painting by setting gidx to
03:40 - 1. now we need to ask scratch to begin
03:43 - painting from the tile we have scrolled
03:46 - across to well let's start with walking
03:49 - left and right how can we tell how many
03:51 - tiles across we walked
03:54 - we simply divide the X position by 32.
03:58 - the tile width
04:00 - let's see cam x divided by 32 is 1.4
04:06 - that's more than one tile and means I
04:08 - need to increase gidx to start painting
04:11 - from the next tile
04:13 - gidx needs to be a whole number though
04:16 - so bring in a floor block
04:19 - the floor of camex divided by 32 is 1.
04:23 - nice we rounded the number down so let's
04:26 - just add this to the initial grdx
04:28 - setting G idx to the sum of the original
04:30 - one and this new offset calculation
04:34 - time to give that a try
04:37 - if I walk off to the right yes I've
04:40 - escaped to the left edge of the level
04:41 - let's see if I can get back again oh
04:44 - cool loving that so how about up and
04:47 - down
04:48 - uh nope we are only accounting for the
04:51 - camex thus far bringing a change gidx by
04:57 - and we can duplicate the floor of block
04:59 - but we need to switch out the Chemex for
05:02 - a cam why
05:04 - but not so fast this will tell us we've
05:07 - scrolled up by one two three tiles but
05:10 - to start painting from a whole row above
05:13 - us we need to add not one but G Max
05:17 - right so multiply this floor value by G
05:22 - Max and put it all back together
05:25 - I'm excited to see this in action pump
05:28 - that green flag
05:30 - and yes we have it in the bag we can
05:33 - scroll up and down left and right and
05:36 - the viewport moves with us it's probably
05:38 - worth noting if we take a walk further
05:41 - left we begin to see our level wrapping
05:43 - around and that is expected and nothing
05:45 - to worry about our level Grid list wraps
05:48 - around after all and inevitably so does
05:51 - the stamping if we let it great I think
05:54 - it's time we expanded our scrolling view
05:56 - to fill the screen
05:58 - the 16 here is the vertical starting
06:01 - position we need to move it downwards by
06:04 - half of the screen height that's 180. so
06:08 - using a subtract block take the number
06:10 - 16 and subtract
06:13 - 180. pop that back into the set Y block
06:17 - and we do the same with the set X block
06:18 - 16 subtract but this time 240 that's
06:23 - half the width of the screen
06:25 - good run the project
06:28 - nice the level is offset from the bottom
06:31 - left corner now how many tiles wide
06:34 - should it be just to cover the screen
06:37 - 1480 divided by 32 is 15 but we always
06:41 - need one more for when the screen is
06:44 - mid-scrolled so 16 for the inner loop
06:49 - for the vertical we need 360 divided by
06:52 - 32 that's 11.25 well we round that up to
06:56 - 12 but add 1 for the extra tile and that
06:59 - is 13 tiles
07:04 - okay you'll note our level painting has
07:07 - gone awry again and that's because we
07:09 - have a 10 here that is supposed to be
07:11 - the viewport width we up this from 10 to
07:13 - 16 so change that here too popular 16.
07:19 - good that is looking sweet so nice to
07:23 - have the whole screen filled but hold on
07:26 - restart the project shouldn't we be
07:29 - starting standing at the bottom left of
07:31 - the level as before yes we should we
07:33 - shifted where we began drawing the tiles
07:36 - but we didn't shift what we were drawing
07:40 - that will require a change to the
07:41 - initial value of gidx our index into the
07:44 - level Grid list
07:46 - so if you look here gidx is calculated
07:49 - from cam X and Y
07:51 - that's the center of the camera view on
07:54 - our level map but we want to draw from
07:57 - this point
07:58 - we'll calculate this and store it in two
08:00 - new variables create them now GX for
08:04 - this Sprite only
08:08 - and gy also for this Sprite only
08:11 - then set GX to 240 less than cam X
08:16 - that is Chemex subtract 240.
08:24 - and set gy to
08:29 - cam y subtract 180
08:34 - brilliant this is our new starting point
08:37 - now we simply replace each Chemex below
08:40 - with a GX and cam y with a g y
08:49 - sweet guys it's Flag crushing time are
08:53 - we positioned back at the bottom left as
08:56 - expected
08:57 - and yes we are that is such good news
09:02 - of course this now amplifies the issue
09:04 - of the wrapping level so perhaps it's
09:07 - time to address that next
09:09 - click into the player Sprite and find
09:12 - the when I receive tick player script
09:15 - see this is where we set the Chemex and
09:17 - Y variables all we need to do is prevent
09:20 - these going out of bounds
09:23 - if
09:24 - cam X is less than
09:28 - now this should be half a screen from
09:32 - the left edge of the level that's 240.
09:36 - then we set kamex back to 240.
09:41 - now it can't go any further left than
09:43 - that run the project and note we have
09:46 - indeed begun right on the far left of
09:48 - the screen we can't see the wrap around
09:50 - level anymore scrolling only kicks in as
09:53 - we move further over to the right I'm
09:56 - loving that let's do the same for the
09:59 - bottom Edge
10:00 - if Cam y
10:07 - is less than 180 then set cam y to 180
10:13 - that's half a screen
10:14 - yep now we can't scroll down off the
10:17 - bottom of the level either that's
10:19 - beautiful
10:20 - there is of course the right and top
10:23 - margins to consider too
10:25 - okay if cam X is greater than
10:30 - so what is the full width of our level
10:32 - in pixels
10:34 - multiply
10:36 - gmax
10:37 - by 32 our tile width oh it's 1024 but we
10:43 - also need to subtract half a screen
10:46 - width from this so drop that in the left
10:49 - of a subtract and take away 240 from the
10:52 - total
10:54 - then set cam X to the same number
10:56 - duplicate the G Max times 32 all
10:59 - subtracted by 240 into there
11:02 - and does it work it sure does nice one
11:07 - last boundary to consider the top
11:09 - boundary duplicate that last if check
11:11 - and change the cam X4 cam y and 240 for
11:16 - a 180. the Chemex for a cam Y and again
11:20 - 240 for the 180. and we are really on a
11:25 - winner now great work I just love
11:28 - zipping around this level gotta say
11:30 - starting at the bottom corner is now
11:32 - looking a bit weird let's move them
11:35 - further out find the when flag clicked
11:38 - and set player X to 240 and player y to
11:43 - 180 and that should do the trick great
11:47 - wow this episode is nearly over but just
11:50 - before we finish I want to bring us back
11:52 - full circle you see how our bushes are
11:55 - missing any grass behind them a lot of
11:58 - the Overworld tiles need grass behind
12:00 - them to make them look complete and this
12:02 - is why we have a large background grass
12:05 - Sprite ready to go if we can display
12:07 - this behind everything then we can save
12:10 - ourselves drawing a whole screen of
12:12 - smaller grass tiles
12:13 - first click into the level store Sprite
12:17 - since this tile of 44 is a grass tile we
12:20 - can replace it with an empty tile all
12:23 - blank tiles will soon be replaced by
12:25 - grass anyhow
12:27 - so click back into the tiles right now
12:29 - what do you think will happen if we try
12:31 - to switch costume to an empty value from
12:33 - our list well it will fail so the
12:36 - costume will stay as the big costume
12:38 - which in our case just happens to be
12:40 - transparent so running the project this
12:44 - does actually work okay however it's
12:47 - much more efficient and that is fast if
12:49 - we don't stamp these blank costumes at
12:51 - all so bring in an if block and check if
12:55 - greater than
12:57 - and is this item of grid greater than
13:00 - the empty value
13:02 - we can place the change Y and change
13:04 - gidx blocks below the if
13:06 - and the switch costume stamp and switch
13:09 - costume back they all go inside this if
13:13 - there now we only do this extra work if
13:16 - the tile is not a blank tile
13:19 - this makes a scrolling engine hyper fast
13:21 - I mean really really fast all that's
13:25 - left is to bring back the large
13:27 - scrolling grass Sprite behind all of
13:29 - this
13:30 - for that to work we need to scroll up to
13:33 - the top of the paint script and remove
13:35 - this arrays all block otherwise this
13:37 - would just erase the background grass
13:39 - before drawing the tiles on top
13:42 - now click into the background Sprite you
13:46 - might wonder why we can't just make this
13:48 - background Sprite visible nope that
13:50 - won't work you see a Sprite always
13:52 - appears over the top of any stamped
13:54 - Sprites so our level will disappear the
13:58 - only way to get this behind the stamped
14:00 - costumes is to stamp the background
14:03 - costume too
14:04 - so drop a stamp block at the end of the
14:08 - paint background script oh yeah right
14:11 - away I can see that looks great but I am
14:14 - aware yours might not look the same and
14:17 - this is because if your background
14:18 - Sprite happens to be ordered behind your
14:21 - tile Sprite
14:23 - then the tiles get drawn first and this
14:26 - background is stamped on top so to
14:29 - ensure things work correct use a go to
14:32 - front to ironically paint the background
14:34 - first and have it appear behind the
14:37 - tiles drop that in to our green flag
14:40 - script for good measure
14:42 - right guys things are looking good but
14:46 - just how fast is this new engine we've
14:48 - built perhaps you'd like a comparison
14:50 - simple click back into the level store
14:52 - Sprite
14:55 - and put gmax back up to 100 tiles across
14:58 - and up yes that's a 10 000 tile map once
15:02 - more and you remember what happened last
15:04 - time
15:07 - we've run the project
15:09 - and wow yes it's not a problem anymore
15:12 - we can walk the level without a stutter
15:15 - what an improvement right
15:18 - in fact if we turn on turbo mode by
15:22 - shift-clicking the green flag then we
15:24 - can see just how fast this project can
15:26 - now run oh my word look at that I can
15:31 - run across the entire map in a second
15:33 - that is super fast what this means is
15:37 - that we have Oodles of processing power
15:39 - to spare which is great news of course
15:43 - you could argue that this is because our
15:45 - level is pretty sparse and we aren't
15:46 - drawing much yet well okay shall we
15:49 - Spruce it up just a little before we
15:51 - finish find our add to grid custom block
15:54 - this is where we are adding tiles to our
15:57 - map I want to drop in a few random
15:59 - bushes we can do this by randomly
16:02 - replacing any otherwise empty tile so
16:05 - bring in an if else condition around the
16:08 - ad block and while we are thinking about
16:10 - it duplicate that Adblock so that in
16:13 - both cases we will be adding to the grid
16:15 - list
16:16 - so that extra tile I want to add a bush
16:19 - and that'll be tile costume number 79 so
16:23 - pop that in there
16:24 - now for the condition to switch to the
16:26 - bush we need an and operator and the
16:30 - first condition is that the tile being
16:31 - inserted should have been an empty space
16:34 - the blank value
16:36 - but so as not to replace all empty space
16:40 - with bushes the second condition is to
16:42 - compare a random value
16:45 - between 1 and 10
16:47 - with the number one
16:50 - this means one in every 10 empty tiles
16:53 - will be replaced by a bush get it let's
16:57 - give it a run and see
16:59 - nice now we can see the scrolling map
17:01 - much clearer with all these bushes to
17:03 - keep us company you can play with the
17:05 - random number to add greater or fewer
17:07 - bushes to add more just reduce the 10
17:10 - down to three
17:13 - or two half of the three space is now
17:16 - bush but perhaps we'd like a little more
17:19 - variety than just these bushes if we
17:21 - check out the tile costumes I'm looking
17:24 - for the long grass blades ah here they
17:26 - are 76 and 77 just before the bushes in
17:30 - fact
17:31 - in the level store we can drop a pick
17:34 - random into the add to grid block itself
17:36 - and choose between 76 and 77.
17:43 - now that's cool it's fun just playing
17:46 - with these settings I wonder what you
17:48 - guys can figure out
17:50 - one thing we could do is extend all the
17:52 - way from 76 up to 79 and that would
17:56 - include the two bushes too yeah it's
17:58 - like we are in this huge Meadow if you
18:01 - really want to push this thing why not
18:03 - just fill the level with a completely
18:06 - random tiles from 20 to 400 and I mean
18:09 - every tile so one of one equals one
18:13 - ah crazy yet I love it this really shows
18:18 - what the stamping engine is capable of
18:20 - in fact why don't we test this with the
18:23 - turbo setting too
18:25 - oh yes look at this now it is slower
18:29 - than the previous test but well it's
18:31 - still way way faster than we need it so
18:34 - this is truly excellent great work
18:37 - indeed
18:38 - so we have a very robust and Speedy
18:42 - scrolling stamped child engine I hope
18:45 - you're as happy as me with these results
18:46 - I'll just return my level generator to
18:49 - its previous settings because this is
18:51 - the end of the video now but while you
18:53 - wait for episode 4 why not play around
18:56 - with the level generation code 2 it sure
18:58 - is a blast if you enjoyed watching then
19:01 - please smash that like button that's
19:03 - right smash it only carefully so as not
19:06 - to miss it and then make sure you're
19:07 - subscribed to the channel so as not to
19:09 - miss the next epic episode you know Bell
19:12 - icon and all because if you've seen the
19:15 - level editor I've got planned then you
19:17 - won't want to miss it indeed if you
19:19 - can't wait then you might consider
19:21 - joining the Early Access membership or
19:23 - even the Inner Circle membership to gain
19:25 - access to the projects themselves but on
19:27 - that note we must finish so thank you
19:29 - for watching have a great week ahead and
19:32 - scratch on guys
19:36 - foreign
19:42 - list wraps around after all
19:49 - and inevitably so does the stamping if
19:52 - we let it
19:56 - [Music]
