00:01 - hello fellow scratchers I'm Griff patch
00:04 - you remember me yeah it's been too long
00:08 - but over the next few weeks I'll be
00:09 - releasing a number of videos continuing
00:11 - my very popular classic platformer
00:14 - series do you still have that project
00:16 - kicking around I hope so because we have
00:18 - some great updates to add so many
00:21 - scratchers put in their requests and top
00:24 - of the list was that you wished that
00:26 - once an enemy Was Defeated that they
00:28 - stayed defeated but the rest of the
00:30 - level well no problem this shouldn't be
00:33 - too complex load up your platformer
00:36 - projects and blow off the dust guys
00:39 - let's get
00:41 - scratching now you may wonder why it is
00:44 - that when we dispatch an enemy they just
00:46 - keep coming back whereas if we collect
00:48 - an apple or a key the Collectibles are
00:50 - able to stay gone and do not return well
00:53 - that's because our Collectibles are
00:55 - created as clones that exist throughout
00:58 - the game only being hidden when we
01:00 - change scene whereas our enemies are
01:02 - deleted between scenes and get recreated
01:05 - on entering a new scene for this reason
01:07 - we are going to need another means of
01:09 - keeping track of when a given enemy has
01:11 - been squished the best way would be
01:14 - using a scratch list make a new one now
01:18 - naming it squished and ensure it's
01:20 - created for all Sprites that's very
01:23 - important so that it works across
01:26 - clones now we need to ensure we reset
01:28 - this list when the gate Begins the best
01:31 - event to hook this off is the setup
01:34 - event so in the enemy Sprite when I
01:37 - receive
01:42 - setup delete all the squished
01:46 - list but now we need a way to identify
01:49 - each enemy clone from one another
01:53 - looking under the when I receive change
01:55 - scene in the enemy Sprite we do specify
01:58 - the type of enemy
02:00 - but we don't give each one a unique ID a
02:03 - name that will identify them from one
02:04 - another so right click and edit the
02:07 - spawn custom block we'll add in a new
02:10 - label ID with a new input also named
02:15 - ID that means we can now assign each
02:18 - enemy a unique ID to identify it but we
02:22 - do have to be careful because if you
02:23 - remember these top two enemies are
02:26 - actually the same enemy we just pick one
02:28 - depending on which direction we need to
02:30 - spawn it in from so we're going to name
02:32 - them both I don't know R1 or red one or
02:35 - Bob it doesn't really matter as long as
02:37 - it's their name and no others then just
02:40 - give each other one a completely unique
02:43 - name okay scroll down to the Define
02:47 - spawn script we need to make a record of
02:50 - the past in ID make a new variable named
02:55 - yeah ID yet again this time making it
02:58 - for this Sprite only it's their ID and
03:01 - no one else's and we set ID to the input
03:06 - variable ID cool so that should now mean
03:10 - each enemy knows who they are and that's
03:13 - great because if this squished list
03:18 - contains our ID well then we don't want
03:22 - them coming back to life anymore do we
03:25 - stop this script and drop it in before
03:29 - we have chance to create any new enemy
03:32 - clone awesome the only thing missing is
03:36 - actually recording which enemies have
03:38 - been
03:40 - squished well this shouldn't be hard I
03:43 - wonder if you already know how you might
03:45 - do this we find the Define touching
03:48 - player script these top scripts trigger
03:51 - when the player squishes this enemy so
03:54 - we simply need to add an item to the
03:57 - squished list and that item is this
04:00 - enemy's unique ID variable and it can go
04:03 - somewhere near the top like when we are
04:06 - playing the squish
04:07 - sound guys smash that green flag and
04:10 - let's see if this does the job jumping
04:13 - on my first enemy and you'll see that
04:15 - their unique ID R2 has been added to our
04:19 - list perfect I'll avoid the second one
04:22 - for now and then return to see if R2 has
04:24 - respawned and they haven't excellent
04:27 - news so let's squish R2 as well great
04:31 - and wow suddenly our world feels so much
04:34 - more empty than before ha well it's the
04:37 - price you pay if you want to have
04:38 - despawning enemies it's your call some
04:41 - games do and some don't anyhow we will
04:43 - be able to balance this out by adding
04:45 - other types of undefeatable enemies and
04:48 - perhaps enemy generators later on in a
04:50 - further bonus
04:52 - episode well surprisingly this is the
04:55 - end of this short episode I told you
04:57 - this wasn't going to be too complex you
04:59 - I just want to double confirm that when
05:01 - we lose all our lives and then restart
05:04 - the game that all the enemies do in fact
05:06 - return as planned but apart from that
05:09 - yeah well done this is looking epic but
05:13 - I think you're going to love the next
05:15 - episode even more it's super exciting
05:18 - because guys we'll be adding lying
05:21 - enemies how cool is that so that is it
05:25 - for today I hope you enjoyed this little
05:27 - bit of fun have a great week ahead and
05:30 - scratch on guys
05:35 - [Music]
