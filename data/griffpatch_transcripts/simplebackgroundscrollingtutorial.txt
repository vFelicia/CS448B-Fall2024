00:00 - [Music]
00:02 - hello fellow scratchers
00:04 - do you want to know how to create
00:05 - scrolling backgrounds in your scratch
00:07 - projects
00:08 - i'm griffpatch and i can't wait to share
00:10 - with you how i would go about creating
00:12 - this cool effect
00:14 - now there are simpler ways to create
00:16 - side scrolling games in scratch
00:18 - but these don't adapt as well to
00:19 - projects that require more control over
00:21 - their scrolling
00:22 - like those that typically use a camera x
00:24 - and y or scroll x and y variables
00:27 - if you've ever followed any of my
00:28 - scrolling project tutorials then you'll
00:30 - know all about these
00:32 - but if you don't don't worry all be
00:34 - revealed
00:36 - so jump right in make a new sprite
00:38 - naming it background
00:40 - i'll choose a fill color of green with
00:43 - an outline
00:44 - of transparent or none we can draw a
00:47 - large rectangle
00:48 - filling the lower half of the drawing
00:50 - canvas
00:51 - make sure to slightly overlap the left
00:54 - right and bottom edges of the screen
00:55 - area
00:57 - switch to the reshape tool now and click
01:00 - on the top line
01:01 - to add a new drawing node these points
01:04 - default to a curve point so just click
01:07 - and drag them
01:08 - to begin shaping some nice mountains
01:10 - from this rectangle
01:12 - we can repeat this for the entire shape
01:15 - it will be useful to try and keep the
01:17 - left and right most points
01:18 - the same height you'll see why later
01:23 - now jump back to the code tab and make a
01:26 - new variable named
01:27 - camera x for all sprites
01:30 - with it still visible on the stage right
01:33 - click the camera x variable reporter and
01:35 - switch to the slider mode
01:37 - right click it again a second time and
01:40 - choose slider range
01:42 - changing the maximum value to be 2 000
01:46 - i'm now able to slide the camera x value
01:48 - all the way up to 2 000
01:49 - cool we'll use this to pan the camera
01:52 - across our scene
01:54 - so when green flag clicked we'll enter a
01:57 - forever loop setting the x position of
01:59 - the background sprite
02:00 - to zero subtract camera x
02:04 - so why the zero minus well
02:08 - as we move the camera to the right the
02:10 - background wants to move to the left
02:13 - so we need to invert the number to get
02:15 - the desired scrolling effect
02:17 - we'll also set the y position to zero
02:21 - okay run that i can now use the camera x
02:24 - to scroll the background
02:25 - nicely around but do you see how the
02:28 - costume is getting stuck on the edge
02:30 - and not scrolling off screen well
02:33 - there's a fix for that
02:34 - right away open the costume editor and
02:36 - select the brush tool
02:38 - and now because we are never going to
02:40 - scroll down below the bottom of the
02:41 - costume
02:42 - we can take the liberty of painting a
02:44 - small dot diagonally down from the
02:46 - bottom left
02:47 - and another diagonally down from the
02:49 - bottom right like so
02:51 - this will extend the distance the
02:52 - background can scroll off the screen
02:54 - give it a test nice it goes right off
02:58 - the screen now
03:00 - now we want to add another sprite to the
03:02 - right of the first
03:04 - so that the scene scrolls for longer
03:06 - before that
03:07 - we'd best do a little housekeeping in
03:09 - preparation for the use of clones
03:12 - separate off this forever loop and
03:13 - broadcast a new message of begin
03:16 - we'll bring in a matching when i receive
03:18 - begin to kick off the forever loop
03:24 - do you want to just grab and drag
03:25 - scratch cat on the stage to bring him in
03:27 - front of the background
03:28 - that's better okay make sure we are
03:31 - still in the background sprite scripts
03:34 - now to allow us to keep track of two
03:36 - different positioned backgrounds
03:38 - make a new variable naming it simply x
03:41 - and make sure to make it
03:42 - for this sprite only that's important
03:45 - this time to ensure that each clone does
03:47 - indeed have its own position
03:50 - set x to zero and then replace the zero
03:53 - in the set x position over here with the
03:55 - x variable
03:56 - this will offset each sprite by its own
03:59 - value of x
04:01 - so to add the new clone further to the
04:04 - right
04:04 - drop in a create clone block and right
04:07 - away
04:08 - change the x variable by 480.
04:11 - that's one entire screen width
04:14 - and run the project
04:18 - ah great the scene has apparently
04:21 - doubled in length
04:23 - this being due to the new clone and i
04:25 - could scroll back and forward with them
04:27 - both in view
04:28 - can you see the seam where the two
04:30 - sprites meet here
04:33 - we can improve the join now to make it
04:35 - look even better
04:36 - with the project still running and the
04:38 - costume join visible
04:39 - open the costume editor and with the
04:41 - reshape tool select the leftmost point
04:44 - now using the up and down arrow keys on
04:47 - your keyboard
04:48 - you can shift the position of this point
04:50 - up and down
04:52 - watching the scene between the two
04:53 - costumes in the project window
04:55 - until they line up perfectly there
04:58 - beautiful of course now we can no longer
05:01 - tell
05:02 - where one sprite ends and another sprite
05:04 - starts so duplicate the first costume
05:07 - and for the time being change the
05:08 - costume's color to make it a little
05:10 - darker
05:13 - we'll use the two costumes now for the
05:15 - two sprites by dropping in
05:17 - a next costume block after the first
05:19 - clone is made
05:21 - and oh yes we should also set the
05:24 - costume to costume one
05:26 - right at the top here to ensure we know
05:28 - which costume we are starting on
05:31 - give that a run yeah now we can easily
05:34 - see where the two sprite clones start
05:36 - end okay this is where things get a
05:39 - little
05:39 - more interesting we now want to create a
05:43 - loop in our scrolling background
05:45 - so that as one moves off the screen it
05:48 - reappears on the opposite side of the
05:49 - screen
05:50 - a cycle if you will we could do this
05:53 - with a number of if conditions and some
05:55 - bound checks but
05:56 - for us keen coders there is a better way
05:59 - let's ask scratchcat for some help at
06:01 - explaining this one
06:03 - in the scratchcat sprite add a when
06:06 - green flag clicked
06:07 - then a forever loop and get them to say
06:11 - camera x okay no problem there
06:14 - we already know the value of camera x so
06:17 - bring in
06:17 - a mod or modulo operator and apply it to
06:21 - camera x
06:22 - on the right we'll use the stage width
06:25 - of 480.
06:27 - now run the project and see what effect
06:29 - this has on the camera x
06:31 - nothing initially but as soon as camera
06:34 - x gets to 480
06:36 - the camera x mod 480 forces the number
06:38 - back
06:39 - down to zero again this process repeats
06:42 - as we keep increasing camera x cycling
06:45 - round and around again
06:47 - this is wonderfully useful operator to
06:49 - use in our projects
06:50 - as it represents exactly what we are
06:52 - trying to do with the exposition of our
06:54 - background sprites
06:55 - with the looping around and around
06:58 - however
06:59 - since we have two sprites of 480
07:02 - we need to loop for 480 multiplied by
07:05 - two now this loops all the way up to 960
07:10 - before resetting back down to zero
07:13 - perfect
07:14 - that will cover two screens
07:17 - let's make use of this in our background
07:19 - sprite
07:21 - housekeeping time first make a new
07:23 - variable named screen
07:24 - x
07:28 - and set it to x minus camera x from here
07:32 - then set the x position to screen x
07:35 - below
07:36 - and now we can use that mod on screen x
07:40 - and on the right 480 multiplied by
07:44 - 2. but if we run the project we can see
07:48 - we are not
07:48 - quite there yet the position of the
07:50 - sprites are
07:52 - all off appearing far too much to the
07:54 - right and never getting past the halfway
07:56 - point to scrolling further left
07:58 - to be on the left they would need a
08:00 - negative x position
08:02 - but the mod operator never returns
08:04 - negative numbers
08:05 - instead it moves the sprites further off
08:07 - to the right
08:08 - we need to compensate for this by
08:10 - subtracting 480
08:12 - from the result
08:21 - and oh yeah finally this is looking
08:23 - really good
08:24 - the sprites are cycling around perfectly
08:27 - so we could stop there but why stop now
08:31 - we can take this further and add in
08:33 - layers
08:35 - we'll start with the sky switch to the
08:37 - stage sprite
08:38 - and we'll add a blue sky rectangle
08:41 - and the yellow sun i'm holding down
08:45 - shift while drawing the sun to make it a
08:47 - perfect circle
08:48 - if we run this you can see that the sun
08:50 - does not move with the mountains
08:53 - this is just as i wanted it's called a
08:55 - parallax effect
08:56 - the things that are further away from
08:58 - the camera move slower than those
09:00 - that are closer to the camera in this
09:03 - case the sun
09:03 - is so far away that it apparently
09:06 - doesn't move at all
09:07 - which is fine this can be a really nice
09:10 - effect
09:11 - and we can go further with it by
09:13 - creating more layers of parallax each at
09:15 - a different distance from the camera
09:17 - we'll do this by adding a new variable
09:20 - named scroll
09:21 - speed for this sprite only
09:24 - set it to 0.25 after the when green flag
09:28 - clicked
09:29 - we want the mountains to scroll at a
09:31 - quarter of the speed of the camera
09:33 - as they are far off so multiplying
09:37 - not the x but just the camera x
09:40 - by scroll speed
09:44 - if you run the project now we find that
09:45 - the mountains do not scroll
09:47 - anywhere near as fast or far as they did
09:50 - before this change
09:53 - now for the fun bit duplicate the
09:55 - background sprite
09:56 - and name the duplicated sprite as
09:59 - foreground
10:02 - in the costume editor delete the second
10:03 - costume completely
10:06 - and then in the first costume i'm
10:08 - carefully removing
10:10 - the costume shapes but leaving in the
10:12 - two small dots we added
10:14 - for the off-screen scrolling
10:17 - next create a lighter green rectangle
10:19 - covering the lower third of the canvas
10:21 - to represent
10:22 - grass for scratch cat to walk on now
10:25 - running the project
10:26 - does not show up the foreground sprite
10:28 - at all
10:29 - my guess is it must be behind all these
10:31 - other sprites
10:32 - so stop the project now and then we can
10:35 - drag them about on the stage
10:37 - the last one moved always becomes the
10:39 - front most sprite
10:41 - so once i can see them all move the
10:43 - foreground sprite
10:45 - and then lastly the cat sprite and there
10:48 - now they should be in the correct order
10:49 - so run the project again
10:52 - yeah better we can see the grass
10:55 - before i continue i'll just delete the
10:57 - scripts in the cat sprite
11:01 - and hide all the variable reporters all
11:03 - except that is the camera x slider
11:06 - there okay let's add something
11:09 - more discernible to the foreground
11:11 - costume i'll make some cute little
11:13 - mushroom
11:14 - stone things with a nice highlight and
11:17 - an awesome little shadow
11:19 - to make them pop that's just the grass
11:21 - color
11:22 - but made a little darker then duplicate
11:25 - the entire costume
11:27 - and we'll create another page of the
11:28 - scene this time
11:30 - i'll make a nice tree
11:34 - but what color mushroom
11:38 - pink green
11:42 - i guess pink i'll run the project again
11:46 - yeah this is cool but as yet it's not
11:50 - got that neat parallax effect because
11:52 - the foreground and background mountains
11:54 - are moving at the same speed
11:57 - so we'll just change the scroll speed
12:00 - back up from 0.25 to 1 for this
12:03 - foreground sprite
12:06 - and now run the project again oh yeah
12:10 - what a transformation the parallax
12:12 - effect makes the whole scene just
12:14 - really pop it really feels like it has
12:16 - some depth now
12:17 - that always gets me really excited now
12:20 - you might have been looking at this
12:22 - project and wondering
12:23 - what if we want more than two costumes
12:25 - making up our scrolling scene
12:28 - that way they can be longer and more
12:30 - interesting
12:32 - well of course you might and there are
12:34 - two approaches to this depending on your
12:36 - project
12:37 - but i'll show you the quick and easy one
12:39 - for today
12:40 - first create your third costume
12:46 - then we change the 480 times 2
12:50 - to be times you guessed it
12:54 - three for three costumes finally
12:57 - we need to clone the extra third sprite
13:00 - we just duplicate these three blocks the
13:03 - crate clone
13:04 - next costume and change x by 480
13:07 - we might even consider putting all these
13:09 - in a repeat loop if we were to want even
13:11 - more costumes
13:12 - running that now and all three costumes
13:15 - are now in use in our scene
13:17 - super i know some people will have
13:20 - noticed
13:21 - so i'll bring it up now that the first
13:23 - costume you see when camera x is zero
13:26 - is actually the second costume not the
13:28 - first
13:30 - this may not be an issue or bother you
13:31 - but if it does then take a quick look at
13:34 - the maths
13:34 - we used here to position the background
13:36 - sprite
13:38 - we are subtracting 480 from the final
13:40 - position of the sprite to allow it to
13:42 - scroll off screen to the left
13:44 - but this is also scrolling our first
13:46 - costume off-screen
13:47 - right away so if you really want the
13:50 - first costume to appear first
13:52 - then simply compensate by adding 480 to
13:55 - screen x
13:56 - within the mod there and now the
13:59 - foreground is now showing the first
14:00 - correct costume right away so we can do
14:04 - the same in the background sprite too if
14:05 - you desire
14:06 - but otherwise that step can be skipped
14:08 - altogether
14:10 - so you may already have a project in
14:12 - mind to use with this scrolling
14:13 - background
14:14 - but to let you see it in action let's
14:16 - just add a better scratch cat sprite
14:19 - i've included a link under the video to
14:21 - a project that includes a sprite with
14:23 - the costumes for the new scratch cat
14:25 - where i created a full 16 frame run
14:27 - cycle for him
14:28 - you are absolutely free to backpack him
14:30 - and use them in your own scratch games
14:33 - i'm taking the third sprite the one
14:35 - without the rucksack
14:37 - drag the sprite into our new scrolling
14:39 - background project
14:41 - and we can get rid of the old scratch
14:42 - cat
14:44 - okay these scripts can be deleted and
14:47 - i'll set up a forever loop
14:48 - under a green flag block simply
14:50 - switching to the next costume
14:53 - so that looks really quite odd it's
14:56 - happening because there are more than
14:58 - just walking costumes in this sprite
15:00 - the walking ones start at costume seven
15:04 - and run until the end so if her costume
15:07 - number
15:08 - is less than seven
15:12 - then set the costume to run zero one
15:14 - that is the seventh costume
15:19 - much better that looks excellent
15:23 - so we can make the level automatically
15:25 - scroll along with scratch cat's run
15:27 - cycle by adding a change
15:28 - camera x by 16 to the loop
15:34 - yeah look at him go awesome
15:38 - perhaps i drew my costumes all a little
15:40 - too low down
15:41 - let me just tweak them up a bit there
15:45 - and so with this you should be able to
15:47 - add scrolling backgrounds to your own
15:49 - games
15:50 - for example here is the same scrolling
15:52 - background code used in my
15:54 - tile scrolling platformer tutorial you
15:57 - can look forward to seeing this
15:59 - very soon looking really good right
16:03 - you may notice that we also have a bit
16:05 - of up and down scrolling here too
16:08 - well this is not hard to script if we
16:10 - just look back at our scripts again
16:12 - we need to add in the camera y variable
16:15 - for all sprites
16:17 - then where we are setting the y position
16:19 - to 0
16:20 - we now set them to 0 minus
16:23 - camera y multiplied by scroll speed
16:31 - we do the same in the foreground sprite
16:34 - and we can make the camera y into a
16:36 - slider too
16:39 - then if you are following my example
16:41 - project here with scratch cat
16:43 - we should make a quick change to scratch
16:45 - cat's script to prevent him looking like
16:47 - he's flying off
16:49 - set their y position to negative 80
16:52 - subtract camera y
16:56 - now run that and it's actually a little
16:58 - hard to see the effect while scratchcat
17:00 - is hurtling sideways so fast
17:02 - hold on let me remove the change camera
17:04 - x so you can see better
17:09 - there now i can scroll up and down and
17:11 - you can see the parallax effects working
17:13 - much clearer
17:15 - so that's great and it can look even
17:18 - better
17:18 - when you have a game that already has a
17:20 - good scrolling script
17:21 - this is especially true for the vertical
17:23 - scrolling as seen in the clip of my
17:25 - mario game
17:26 - this technique will work in most
17:28 - projects though and can even be adapted
17:30 - to be used as the base for scrolling
17:32 - game levels themselves
17:34 - well i do hope that helped and i will be
17:36 - showing you exactly how i use this in my
17:38 - tile scrolling project very shortly
17:41 - in the meantime get this into your
17:43 - projects of your own
17:44 - and i hope you will create some
17:45 - fantastic some weird and wacky but
17:48 - all awesome landscapes for me to check
