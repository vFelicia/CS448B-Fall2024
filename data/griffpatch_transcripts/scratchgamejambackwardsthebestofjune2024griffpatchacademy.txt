00:00 - hello fellow scratchers I'm Griff patch
00:03 - and welcome to the results of yet
00:05 - another crazy awesome griffpatch Academy
00:08 - game Jam this month's theme was
00:10 - backwards and although that was perhaps
00:12 - quite a tricky theme we again got over
00:15 - 100 submissions and yes we played them
00:17 - all from the backward Shooters to code
00:21 - cracking from hero villain reversal to
00:24 - interactive stories from detective
00:27 - sleuthing to controlling a zombie horde
00:30 - they were all simply amazing but there
00:33 - can only be one winner well okay uh
00:36 - eight winners or something like that
00:39 - shall we see them now okay our first
00:42 - winner is the legend of the time Cavern
00:45 - by prabs a superbly polished scrolling
00:48 - platformer sluzzle game where the player
00:50 - can control the reversal of time
00:53 - literally taking you and your
00:54 - surroundings back in time undoing any of
00:57 - your mistakes so you can take another
00:59 - stab at the things however it doesn't
01:02 - stop there quite soon you discover the
01:04 - blue items in the game do not get
01:07 - affected by the reversal of time and
01:09 - then things get interesting so use your
01:12 - time power to solve each level collect
01:14 - the energy pieces and enter the end
01:16 - portal this project wins the award for
01:19 - best time control project great job
01:22 - prolabs excellent coding especially
01:24 - getting all that time reversal to look
01:26 - so smooth and work flawlessly that must
01:29 - have been quite f a
01:31 - challenge this next one is a simple word
01:34 - puzzle game but it has excellent visuals
01:37 - and appeal it's epit or type backwards
01:41 - by Cod and all we need to do is read the
01:44 - next word and type it in a letter at a
01:47 - time backwards seems simple but only if
01:50 - you can reverse years of muscle memory
01:52 - that tries to get you to type words
01:54 - forwards just three little mistakes and
01:57 - it's game over this isn't excellently
01:59 - presented game with a lot of replay
02:01 - value since at each play you do get a
02:03 - little better I really want to get the
02:05 - high score great job koder best
02:09 - backwards word puzzle award to
02:12 - you now this is fun 7 parat 7 has
02:17 - created a fun platformer mechanic in
02:19 - their game Shadow realm that allows you
02:21 - the player to flip on to the opposite
02:24 - side of the platform that you are
02:25 - standing on entering the shadow realm
02:28 - see how the whole SC changes style are
02:31 - you getting the stranger thing Vibes too
02:34 - very cool only to make things even more
02:37 - backwards you'll find that your left and
02:38 - right controls are also flipped in this
02:41 - state it's actually a little more
02:43 - confusing and leads to a lot of
02:44 - accidental death in my opinion but maybe
02:46 - that was a step two backwards however I
02:49 - think this is an excellent game and you
02:51 - get the best reversible platformer award
02:55 - congratulations 7even par 7
03:00 - and wow out of all the attempts to
03:02 - create a fully reversed shooter game
03:05 - entropy down by gamer me really went the
03:08 - full hog and even reversed the direction
03:11 - of the player projectiles making them
03:13 - appear at the edge of the screen and fly
03:15 - towards the player very clever and
03:18 - amazingly it all hangs together
03:20 - perfectly all this along with a
03:22 - believable backstory what can I say the
03:25 - most authentic backward shooter award
03:28 - goes to you game M well
03:32 - played oh what's this then Mango's Jango
03:36 - in this Splendid scrolling platformer
03:39 - had the idea to create a game where the
03:40 - player mustn't come face to face with
03:43 - the Enemy ghosts so instead you must
03:45 - always turn to face away backwards but
03:48 - gosh that's actually really hard to do I
03:51 - wish there was an option to walk
03:52 - backwards anyhow this is a game of skill
03:56 - so with a bit of practice I bet you'll
03:57 - be dashing through these levels mango
04:00 - Jango wasn't the only one to have this
04:02 - idea but they pulled it off with great
04:04 - style so best facing backwards award
04:07 - goes to
04:09 - you and Now for Something Completely
04:12 - Different backwards presented by Athena
04:16 - 24 and what a unique concept it's a kind
04:20 - of time defying detective game that
04:23 - begins with you witnessing a suspicious
04:25 - event all self-recorded by The Talented
04:28 - Athena 24 four I assume and it's creepy
04:32 - but fully scratch appropriate I'm glad
04:34 - to report they're only sleeping now to
04:37 - begin with I had no clue what I was
04:39 - supposed to do you can control the
04:41 - playback of the video and look for Clues
04:42 - by clicking and yeah it turns out the
04:45 - ball is a clock that lets you change
04:47 - time nice I shall not reveal more but
04:51 - just for the sheer uniqueness and
04:53 - overwhelming quantity of imported
04:55 - costumes I award you the most unique
04:58 - backwards project award congratulations
05:00 - Athena
05:03 - 24 and what is this hello Griff patch
05:08 - it's too late for you I've already
05:09 - destroyed the town some dude has blown
05:12 - up all the buildings in town and all
05:14 - we've got is oh time Ray awesome wait a
05:18 - minute you fixed it in a very wholesome
05:21 - turn of events pillow static lets us
05:23 - turn back time in Calamity fixer and let
05:27 - us put the world to rights combined that
05:29 - with a bit of Fun Arcade action and the
05:31 - odd forgivable bug I'm sure you'll get
05:33 - to the bottom of those this really is a
05:36 - clever and unique idea and I can't help
05:39 - but award you the most wholesome game
05:42 - Award with a special mention for fixing
05:44 - those unfortunate flowers I wish I had
05:47 - one of those ray guns myself so many
05:49 - good uses well done pillow static and
05:52 - keep up the good work and that brings us
05:55 - to our last winner for this Jam we have
05:58 - flower defense by Strider
06:01 - 2013 a tower defense game with the rolls
06:04 - reversed and a very entertaining back
06:07 - story these cheeky flowers so it's our
06:11 - job to spawn flowers and attack the main
06:14 - base only watch out for those turrets
06:17 - the only way to overpower them is with
06:19 - sheer numbers and this game includes a
06:21 - clever clicker element to collect money
06:24 - that then buys us more plant seeds then
06:27 - we can strategically grow more plants
06:29 - and use our temporary turret disabler
06:32 - very handy at just the right moment to
06:35 - allow the great horde to really get
06:37 - their petals dirty Splendid and very
06:40 - entertaining the best reverse Tower
06:43 - Defense award goes to Strider
06:47 - 2013 so well done to you and thank you
06:50 - everybody who entered a project I wish I
06:53 - could mention you all just as we close
06:55 - though can I give a special mention to

07:17 - I think the concept had such great Merit
07:20 - going back to clean up after the main
07:21 - game has finished I just wish it could
07:24 - have been pushed a little further into
07:26 - that backwards theme then there's recoil
07:29 - by not a school account another winner
07:31 - from last month's game Jam is showing
07:33 - their skills once more I really loved
07:35 - playing this and the backwards recoil is
07:37 - really smart perhaps the level is just a
07:39 - little too cramped but ha maybe that
07:42 - works for the better and then the last
07:44 - special mention goes to Bomberman 04 hwb
07:48 - with
07:49 - Backwoods clever name there a wonderful
07:52 - looking game based on our raycaster
07:54 - series I suspect I just love catching

07:58 - very tricky to find your way back to the
08:00 - chicken coop with this chicken stuffed
08:02 - in your face man I really do love the
08:05 - idea though and it looks great and that
08:08 - really is all we've got time for I hope

08:13 - entries and that they perhaps will give
08:15 - you some inspiration for projects you
