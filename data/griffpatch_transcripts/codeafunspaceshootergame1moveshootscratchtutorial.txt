00:00 - [Music]
00:02 - hello fellow lemons
00:04 - welcome to another mix it up monday
00:05 - tutorial i'm griff patch and today we
00:08 - are going to start a little project
00:09 - based loosely around the classic game
00:11 - asteroids but well far more over the top
00:17 - as you can see lemons have achieved
00:19 - interstellar capability and are
00:20 - attempting to take over the universe
00:23 - to tackle such a scenario we obviously
00:25 - need to fight back with rapid fire lemon
00:27 - bursting
00:28 - lasers so what's the coolest thing we're
00:32 - going to learn
00:32 - while making this game that would be how
00:35 - to handle
00:36 - loads of rapidly moving projectile
00:37 - clones on enemies
00:39 - and how to robustly handle the
00:40 - collisions between them
00:42 - as a bonus we'll also tack on some cool
00:44 - special effects including
00:46 - damage and explosion flashes and the
00:50 - much sought-after camera shake
00:52 - today we're going to cover the basic
00:54 - player design movement and shooting of
00:56 - laser projectiles towards the mouse
00:59 - i'm also interested to know how many
01:01 - times i can say the word
01:02 - lemon in one episode lemon lemon lemon
01:05 - were you counting okay let's get
01:10 - scratching we'll begin with the player
01:13 - spaceship sprite
01:14 - i'll politely discard my pal scratch cat
01:17 - and create a new sprite in its place
01:19 - we'll need to draw a ship that faces to
01:21 - the right that's the direction we almost
01:23 - always need to make our sprites face i
01:26 - often forget and end up drawing it
01:28 - facing up
01:29 - so we can use a rectangle holding the
01:32 - shift
01:33 - as we draw it to perfectly keep it as a
01:34 - square
01:36 - then switching to the shape tool select
01:38 - one corner node
01:39 - and click delete to make a perfect
01:41 - triangle
01:42 - now using the selection tool again i can
01:44 - rotate the triangle
01:45 - but again holding the shift key while
01:47 - dragging it so as to rotate by exactly
01:50 - 45 degrees okay next trick
01:54 - grab the top resize node and hold down
01:57 - the alt as you drag down
01:59 - this resizes the object around the
02:01 - middle very useful
02:03 - next i drag the triangle until it snaps
02:05 - to the center of the canvas
02:07 - it's important to do this so that the
02:09 - ship will rotate beautifully around its
02:11 - middle point
02:12 - but then once centered i then drag it to
02:15 - the right a little bit
02:16 - again while holding the shift key this
02:19 - lets it move
02:20 - without it allowing to go up and down so
02:22 - it stays snapped to the middle in the
02:24 - vertical
02:25 - okay and there's more tricks yet hold
02:28 - down the alt
02:29 - key again and then left click and drag
02:32 - the triangle to create a perfect
02:34 - duplicate but while still dragging hold
02:38 - down the shift key
02:39 - and power the shape is snapping to stay
02:41 - lined up with the previous shape
02:43 - i'll color it lemon yellow
02:47 - this ship is already looking cool i
02:49 - think i'll drop the border thickness
02:51 - down a touch
02:52 - right i didn't name the sprite so let's
02:55 - name it now
02:56 - player next we can make the background
02:59 - nice and dark by switching to the stage
03:01 - i'll convert it to a bitmap and fill the
03:03 - entire screen with a color that's
03:05 - almost but not quite black
03:09 - okay back to the player sprite and let's
03:12 - fill in some code
03:14 - it's going to be a basic game loop this
03:16 - time we'll set it up with a when green
03:18 - flag clicked
03:20 - bring the player to the front of all the
03:22 - other sprites
03:24 - and go to the center of the screen we'll
03:27 - want our ship to have
03:28 - smooth movement so we'll keep track of
03:31 - its momentum
03:32 - that is its speed make two new variables
03:34 - named speedx
03:35 - for this sprite only
03:38 - and speed y also for this sprite only
03:44 - and will be very good and set them both
03:46 - to zero before the game gets going
03:49 - always good to reset your variables like
03:51 - this at the start of the game
03:54 - now for the game loop bring in a forever
03:56 - loop
03:57 - so what shall we do first how about left
04:00 - and right movement
04:01 - we can do this in so many ways but the
04:04 - pattern is always very similar
04:05 - i'm going to make a new custom block
04:07 - naming it move
04:08 - x and adding in a numeric input of
04:11 - joystick x
04:12 - now people ask why do i use so many of
04:14 - these custom blocks
04:16 - the truth is you don't always need to
04:18 - but one huge advantage
04:19 - is that they break up your code into
04:21 - nice chunks and
04:23 - they give each chunk a rather nice name
04:26 - that can be a lifesaver
04:27 - when you come back to a project later
04:29 - and want to find something
04:30 - it's just so much more readable we'll
04:33 - use the move
04:34 - x block right away and i'm going to use
04:36 - the same key press trick we did in some
04:38 - other tutorials
04:39 - of putting the key press blocks inside a
04:41 - subtract operator
04:42 - like this either we can have right arrow
04:45 - press subtract
04:47 - left arrow pressed or as i'm going to do
04:49 - now
04:50 - key d pressed subtract key a pressed
04:53 - that's the was keys this beautiful
04:56 - little trick
04:56 - gives us a minus one for left a zero for
04:59 - no movement
05:00 - and a one for right that's really useful
05:03 - okay so the joystick x input here will
05:06 - now as we just said b minus one for left
05:09 - or one for right
05:10 - let's use this to change the player's
05:12 - speed x variable
05:13 - specifically by 0.9 multiplied by
05:17 - joystick x now the 0.9 here
05:20 - is the player's acceleration feel free
05:23 - to create a variable to hold the value
05:25 - if you prefer
05:26 - but i'm just being quick today next up
05:29 - we set speed x
05:30 - yeah not change this time set set speed
05:33 - x to 0.9
05:35 - multiplied by speed x this is not
05:38 - the same 0.9 as the one above this one
05:41 - is for
05:41 - air resistance to slow the player back
05:43 - down
05:44 - with the speed variable now updated we
05:47 - can change x by the speed x
05:49 - to get the player moving on stage
05:52 - let's give it a quick test run the
05:53 - project and press the left and right
05:55 - keys
05:56 - whichever you assigned there that's a
05:58 - nice feel
05:59 - cool we can do the same now for up and
06:01 - down
06:04 - make a new custom block move y with an
06:06 - input of joystick y
06:08 - this code will be just the same as for
06:10 - the left and right
06:12 - change speed y
06:16 - by 0.9 multiplied by joystick y
06:21 - and set speed y
06:25 - to 0.9 times by speed y
06:31 - and finally change y by speed y
06:40 - we can pop the new move y block into the
06:42 - forever loop and pass
06:43 - in the key w or up subtract key
06:47 - s or down
06:52 - let's test that again to check we have
06:54 - full movement now
06:57 - yeah beautiful all we need now is to
07:00 - rotate to point towards the mouse cursor
07:02 - this is going to be quite a fast paced
07:04 - game so i'm not going to limit the speed
07:06 - of turning
07:07 - so it's really easy
07:12 - just drop in a point towards mouse
07:14 - pointer and we're done
07:18 - yeah i like that a lot
07:22 - now we are facing the right direction we
07:24 - need to be able to fire those lemon
07:26 - bursting lasers
07:29 - make a new sprite naming it laser
07:32 - we can start by zooming in
07:36 - and drawing a long rectangle
07:40 - remembering to snap it to the center of
07:42 - the canvas again
07:44 - i think a fill color of white
07:47 - but with a lemon yellow outline looks
07:49 - neat
07:52 - next i'll round the ends of the laser
07:54 - beam with the shape tool
07:56 - just click to create new nodes on the
07:58 - top bottom and mid-right edges like this
08:01 - now we can click on the corner nodes and
08:03 - press the delete key
08:04 - to remove them leaving a not half bad
08:06 - rounded end
08:08 - do the same for the left end
08:16 - to finish it off i'm making the border a
08:18 - bit thicker
08:19 - size two and now to ensure the laser is
08:21 - correctly drawn
08:23 - i'm going to draw a completely
08:24 - transparent rectangle around the entire
08:26 - shape
08:27 - this is not crucial but it helps to
08:29 - ensure the laser's edges are nice and
08:31 - crisp
08:31 - and don't get cut off weirdly i'm sure
08:34 - the scratch bug will get fixed one day
08:38 - okay let's put some scripts together
08:40 - beginning with the initializing scripts
08:43 - when green flag clicked hide the laser
08:46 - only wants to be visible when cloned
08:49 - the original sprite should be hidden and
08:51 - in fact will never be used as a laser
08:53 - sprite at all
08:54 - this is common practice in scratch in
08:56 - fact if you do
08:57 - try to use the main sprite you can get
09:00 - into trouble because
09:01 - unlike all the clone sprites the delete
09:03 - clone will not work on the main sprite
09:06 - that can lead to bugs where one bullet
09:08 - suddenly appears on the screen and won't
09:10 - disappear like the others
09:12 - so yeah hide the main laser sprite
09:16 - we're going to hang all our game loops
09:18 - off of when i start as clone
09:19 - hat block this is very convenient for
09:22 - less complex games like this one
09:24 - as soon as the laser is cloned position
09:26 - it at the player's sprite location
09:29 - we are going to want to send it flying
09:31 - out in the direction the player is
09:32 - facing
09:33 - to match the player's direction we use a
09:35 - point in direction block
09:37 - yeah don't use the point towards player
09:40 - that won't work
09:41 - we could have used the point towards
09:43 - mouse that would surely work
09:45 - as we are present always facing towards
09:47 - the mouse but
09:48 - that may not be the case in the future
09:50 - so
09:51 - point in direction and then find the of
09:54 - block in the sensing category
09:56 - and switch the sprite name to be player
09:58 - now you can select the direction
10:01 - of player neat okay
10:04 - we need to show the cloned laser sprite
10:06 - and then we'll begin a repeat
10:08 - until loop
10:11 - repeating until the laser is touching
10:13 - the edge of the stage
10:16 - within the repeat drop in a move block
10:20 - and i'll change it to be 11 steps the
10:24 - bigger the number the faster the laser
10:25 - will travel
10:26 - so have a play with that this loop will
10:29 - finish
10:29 - when we hit the edge of the stage so
10:31 - then delete this clone to remove it from
10:34 - the game
10:35 - that all sounds good we just need a way
10:38 - to trigger the laser to fire
10:40 - now we may be tempted to use a when
10:42 - space key pressed hat block
10:45 - then we simply can create a clone of
10:47 - self
10:48 - now which of you knows why this is not
10:50 - such a great idea
10:52 - let's give it a test i can press space
10:56 - and a single laser fires out on first
10:58 - inspection this is working
11:00 - very nicely so the cloning and laser
11:02 - movement scripts are great
11:03 - but because i have scratch add-ons
11:06 - installed
11:07 - i can see how many clones are being used
11:09 - as i launch each laser
11:11 - and look at that how is it possible that
11:14 - i'm using all 300 clones at once
11:16 - with so few lasers showing up on screen
11:19 - any ideas
11:20 - okay let me explain this
11:24 - is a super common bug for scratchers who
11:27 - are new to using clones
11:28 - look back at where we added the crate
11:30 - clone block here it is
11:33 - whenever the space key is pressed we
11:34 - create a clone of ourselves
11:37 - seems harmless until you consider that
11:39 - this is being triggered on the laser
11:41 - sprite
11:42 - now tell me how many laser sprites are
11:45 - there at once
11:46 - well there's one sprite to begin with
11:49 - but as soon as i press the space
11:50 - we clone the sprite and then there are
11:53 - two laser sprites
11:54 - so when i then press the space again to
11:57 - fire the next bullet
11:58 - not just one laser sprite will trigger a
12:00 - space press script
12:02 - but two and both sprites the original
12:05 - and the clone
12:06 - will both create new bullet clones of
12:08 - their own
12:09 - of course because the clone creating
12:11 - script places the new bullets at the
12:13 - player
12:13 - all these new bullets appear on top of
12:15 - each other so we only see
12:17 - one even though there are two so that
12:19 - makes
12:20 - four bullet sprites even though we've
12:22 - only pressed space
12:23 - twice so now can you guess what happens
12:27 - if i press space a third time
12:29 - you guessed it four bullets becomes
12:32 - eight bullets and then 16 32 64 128
12:36 - 256 and pal we've exceeded the 300 clone
12:39 - limit
12:40 - it doesn't take long before all the
12:42 - clones are used up disaster
12:44 - because we'll need to keep all these
12:46 - clones available for all those
12:47 - lemons so the mistake we made was to
12:50 - have a key pressed
12:52 - on a sprite that is being cloned always
12:54 - remember if a sprite is cloned
12:56 - that all the clones will be receiving
12:58 - the keypress event
13:00 - ok much easier to trigger the clone
13:02 - event from the player sprite instead
13:05 - make sure to delete this when space key
13:07 - pressed hadlock
13:09 - click into the player sprite
13:12 - we'll make a new custom block named
13:14 - shoot
13:18 - and we'll use it right after pointing
13:20 - towards the mouse pointer
13:22 - down here now i don't want to trigger
13:24 - off the when
13:25 - key pressed because i don't fancy the
13:27 - player having to mash the space key that
13:29 - much
13:29 - instead i want a steady stream of lasers
13:32 - to fire out as soon as the key has held
13:34 - down
13:35 - so add in an if space key pressed
13:39 - or mouse down we might as well allow the
13:42 - mouse to fire too
13:43 - and then we'll use the create clone of
13:45 - and switch it to clone the laser sprite
13:48 - great shall we give that another test
13:51 - mash the green flag
13:53 - oh man yes look at that that's insane
13:56 - firepower
13:57 - lemons don't stand a chance against that
13:59 - yeah so
14:00 - i think we need to rein that back in a
14:02 - touch limit the rate of fire
14:06 - make a new variable to keep track of
14:08 - this naming it fire
14:09 - rate for this sprite only
14:13 - we need an if else block
14:16 - and check if the fire rate variable is
14:18 - larger than zero
14:23 - oh move the key pressed check into the l
14:26 - side
14:27 - we only want to allow firing of the
14:28 - laser when 5 8 has decreased to zero so
14:32 - yeah
14:32 - if the fire rate is greater than zero
14:34 - then change the fire rate by negative
14:36 - one
14:37 - then after creating a new laser set fire
14:40 - rate to
14:41 - 10 this will now not allow the laser to
14:45 - fire again until it has decreased back
14:46 - down to zero
14:48 - let's give that a test oh gosh that
14:51 - feels slow now
14:52 - a regular pulse of just three laser
14:54 - blasts per second that could work for
14:56 - early levels perhaps but it's not going
14:58 - to be a match for the number of lemons i
15:00 - have in mind
15:01 - no i'm counting on there being quite a
15:03 - lot of lemons indeed
15:05 - so perhaps let's try a setting 5 8 to 1.
15:11 - okay that's nice it's perhaps a little
15:15 - quick
15:16 - but i kind of like it it's a nice
15:18 - compromise and i'm feeling it will give
15:19 - us perhaps some chance of warding off
15:21 - even a somewhat excitable lemon invasion
15:25 - right guys this is the end of part one
15:28 - of this tutorial
15:29 - if you want any game assets then i've
15:31 - included a link to a scratch project in
15:33 - the info under this video
15:35 - i think you should take the time though
15:37 - to have fun and make the spaceship
15:38 - costumes yourself
15:40 - but there's also some cool sound effects
15:42 - in there for you to grab so
15:43 - have fun the next episode we'll build on
15:46 - this tutorial
15:46 - and we'll finally get those lemons into
15:49 - the game lots and lots
15:50 - of lemons yeah and that is where the fun
15:53 - really will begin
