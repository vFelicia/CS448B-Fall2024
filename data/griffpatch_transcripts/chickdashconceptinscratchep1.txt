00:02 - hi
00:03 - it's the Griff patch I'm just making a
00:06 - small screencast here to get some
00:09 - feedback really I've had some ideas for
00:12 - a new little game and I thought myself
00:14 - it'd be really cool to perhaps create
00:18 - some YouTube videos of the work in
00:21 - progress so I can like keep you up to
00:23 - date on how I go about building a
00:25 - project not quite sure if it will work
00:28 - whether you're interested or quite how
00:31 - deep to go but so here's a start I mean
00:34 - I can always do other ones so this is
00:37 - the idea I had chicken burn I'm not sure
00:40 - I like the name chicken run perhaps
00:42 - chicken - chick - who knows and yes I
00:46 - know it's Easter's past it just happens
00:48 - to be a cute idea and I don't really
00:50 - mind so what I do as I came up with this
00:54 - idea for a game where you have a hen
00:59 - sitting on her eggs and off she goes
01:01 - with other little chicks only leaving
01:03 - one egg behind and that's gonna be your
01:05 - character so you hatch without your mum
01:08 - around and you have to - to cross the
01:10 - level to try and catch up with her so
01:12 - that's the premise of it I thought that
01:14 - was quite a cool idea and in my thoughts
01:18 - I was kind of thinking of our games like
01:20 - Super Mario - or kind of that kind of
01:24 - gameplay Iraq a really simple dynamic
01:27 - where you get to run across a level and
01:30 - avoid obstacles and it's always smooth
01:33 - and fun so to begin that journey I had
01:37 - to draw a little little chick guy as you
01:41 - can see here's where I started off
01:42 - starting off with a more realistic chick
01:45 - shape and this process a pivot 'iv and
01:48 - then I started to change the idea - this
01:52 - guy here with a bit more retro pixelated
01:56 - I quite like the style of that wasn't
02:00 - quite what I was looking for getting
02:02 - closer this is getting very close to how
02:05 - I've ended up at the moment
02:07 - and I started playing with colors of
02:08 - legs shape of body colouring things like
02:12 - that
02:13 - and in the end this is the guy I've come
02:15 - up with which I like the most
02:17 - notice how I faded out his outline a
02:20 - little bit to make him fit in with his
02:22 - legs and quite nice it's twice as Pixley
02:29 - as it needs to be so you didn't scratch
02:31 - you can draw in between these pixels but
02:33 - to make it retro looking I've kept it to
02:35 - this grid size which i think is quite
02:37 - nice the animation for him I've put
02:41 - together here any five frames for his
02:43 - walk cycle
02:44 - his legs are bending backwards of course
02:47 - being a chick if you look at this one
02:49 - here his leg goes out backwards and then
02:51 - forwards and when they're fully stretch
02:54 - cuts a straight steel that was a bit of
02:56 - a challenge so you can see here let me
02:58 - stop the project it's still reading cuz
02:59 - then they can see the different frames
03:01 - so he pops up he'd like to turn around
03:04 - he comes down and then it goes back to
03:06 - start now I don't know whether I'm gonna
03:08 - have to add more frames or not but
03:11 - that's the that's the basic animation so
03:13 - look I play this you can see him run it
03:16 - through there we go yeah well that's
03:23 - quite a little running animation now of
03:26 - course you ever seen a little chick
03:27 - their legs go like the clappers they
03:29 - don't go slow like that at all so let me
03:31 - speed that up so you can see what it
03:33 - looked like sped up I don't worry about
03:36 - these scripts for now so if it's running
03:39 - at one frame a second one 30 frames a
03:42 - second it's like this so it's quite cute
03:47 - I can also put in some background
03:51 - surprise just to give you an idea what
03:53 - it looks like
04:06 - ah I know what's wrong there we go
04:17 - serious running on a scrolling little
04:21 - background now that might not actually
04:25 - be fast enough what I've done in these
04:32 - scripts down here if allowed me to
04:33 - change the speed of how fast he runs it
04:38 - is you might notice he ran backwards
04:41 - fast near and forward so now he goes
04:43 - like this
04:43 - so this legs are actually going faster
04:46 - than the frames that I've created so
04:49 - he's actually only showing two or three
04:51 - of the five frames as if cycles around
04:53 - but I might make a different one cycle
04:56 - for him depending on how I'm feeling and
04:57 - how the game pans out I've also made him
05:00 - little jump and double jump which might
05:06 - change the graphics to again but I like
05:08 - the idea of it now you jump twice you
05:10 - can't to each or anything so that's the
05:14 - idea I can also switch in some slightly
05:20 - different graphics for the floor there
05:25 - we go
05:26 - you can imagine what you might do with
05:29 - the graphics there so that's quite cool
05:34 - not you also see I'm shooting at them if
05:37 - I walk off the edge there's no actual
05:40 - collision detection with the flaw at all
05:41 - but that's the whole thing when you're
05:43 - starting to develop a game you don't go
05:44 - jumping in and do everything you just do
05:46 - bit by bit to get a feel of what what's
05:48 - working what isn't so there's a lot more
05:51 - to do and a lot more scripting to do I
05:52 - could back down from this and run the
05:56 - YouTube video from an earlier point and
05:58 - show how I've made the script so far for
06:00 - example this nice scrolling here where I
06:03 - can face the direction on it scroll so
06:05 - I'm got a lot of running space and I can
06:08 - see what's coming that's quite cool I'm
06:10 - like I'm sure to do that
06:12 - how to do the animating frame weights at
06:16 - the moment he cycles slower if he's
06:18 - running slow and he gets the faster he
06:19 - goes faster and all the little bits and
06:21 - pieces in here and the costs of jumping
06:23 - and double jumping so we'll see how this
06:25 - series goes really tell me what you
06:27 - think and yeah see you on scratch
