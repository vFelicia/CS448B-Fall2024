00:02 - hello fellow scratchers here's a
00:05 - question how do we make our games
00:07 - exciting and keep players hooked
00:10 - collectibles yes everyone loves to
00:12 - collect things no seriously we're
00:14 - addicted put a coin a lemon or an apple
00:17 - in our sights and even better temptingly
00:19 - jangle it up and down then my word we
00:21 - are simply driven to find a way to make
00:23 - it ours
00:24 - i'm griffpatch and in this part 9 of our
00:27 - classic platforming series we'll not
00:29 - only learn how to scatter delicious
00:30 - apples throughout our level but also how
00:32 - to add other enticing special items such
00:35 - as working keys
00:37 - that open actual locked doors how cool
00:41 - is that yep this is a real game changer
00:44 - now if you've been following along with
00:46 - this tutorial then don't panic that the
00:49 - game is suddenly looking different no
00:51 - you've not missed an episode did you
00:53 - catch last week's tutorial on pen
00:55 - special effects that make your game go
00:57 - pop well all i've done is followed that
00:59 - tutorial in the level sprite of this
01:01 - project and we've drawn the levels to
01:03 - make it fresh if you didn't catch that
01:05 - tutorial then i've included a link under
01:07 - the video that you can follow if you
01:09 - wish but don't feel you need to it won't
01:11 - make any difference if you decide to
01:13 - skip it and keep all your hard work just
01:15 - the same and unaltered everything will
01:17 - continue to work just fine
01:19 - as a quick overview here are my new
01:21 - level costumes they are really simple
01:24 - just plain filled shapes no outlines or
01:26 - anything i've gone for a much more
01:28 - chunky confined feel to the levels this
01:30 - time so that i can keep the player
01:32 - fenced in and give them direction
01:35 - my danger costumes have been upgraded to
01:37 - these exciting spikes filled with red
01:39 - and black gradient fills to contrast the
01:41 - purple of the level
01:43 - and as for the platform's bright i don't
01:45 - currently use any of these so i've
01:47 - disabled them by separating off the ifs
01:49 - within the change scene event here
01:52 - but don't delete the event receivers and
01:53 - scripts because we'll be using them
01:55 - later on in this episode to add a
01:57 - working locked door
02:00 - now back to the level sprite you'll see
02:02 - we have new scripts in here these are
02:05 - from the cool pen effects tutorial a
02:07 - link to which you can find under this
02:08 - video the only thing to notice is the
02:11 - pen effects are triggered here from the
02:13 - when i receive change scene block not
02:15 - from the when green flag click block
02:17 - okay
02:18 - cool and that's it so let's take this
02:21 - for a spin
02:22 - watch as we run the project and the pen
02:24 - stamping kicks in and makes our level
02:26 - design pop i love how the level is
02:28 - lifted off the stripy background when
02:30 - the outline and shadow effects are
02:32 - applied
02:34 - right then before we begin make sure to
02:36 - save this as a new copy of your project
02:39 - name it episode 9 and let's get
02:42 - scratching
02:44 - we'll start simple and then build things
02:46 - up
02:47 - first we want a nice new sprite to
02:49 - represent something we can collect a
02:51 - collectible i'm going to create a new
02:54 - sprite
02:55 - but for convenience and because i want
02:57 - an apple i'll pick from the scratch
02:59 - library using the magnifying glass here
03:02 - and there it is the apple sprite great
03:05 - there it is on our project stage so drag
03:07 - it to where we want it to appear
03:10 - it is however really very much too big
03:13 - poor scratchy won't stand a chance
03:15 - against this beast of an apple
03:17 - now we could size it down using the size
03:19 - block but this time i'm going to go into
03:21 - the costume editor and actually shrink
03:23 - it down as a costume edit
03:26 - the reason i just want to make all
03:27 - collectible costumes their actual sizes
03:30 - so that when we have other types of
03:32 - items to collect we don't have to keep
03:34 - using size blocks for each one
03:36 - oh dear
03:38 - did you notice the side of that apple
03:40 - has been cut off if you want to fix this
03:42 - then there is a trick to sort this just
03:44 - draw a rectangle around the entire
03:46 - sprite and make it transparent there
03:48 - that fixes it believe it or not
03:50 - okay to the code we want to set up this
03:53 - collectible to appear in the same place
03:56 - each time the game is run
03:58 - now ensure the project is stopped before
04:00 - we start coding
04:02 - when green flag clicked
04:05 - we switched costume to apple
04:08 - and go to xy now look because this
04:11 - project was stopped scratch has auto
04:13 - completed the x and y with the position
04:15 - of the sprite on the stage that's neat
04:18 - and it saves us time
04:19 - so next up with the costume positioned
04:22 - correctly we want to wait until it is
04:24 - touching the player
04:26 - this is great because as soon as the
04:28 - player touches it we want to collect it
04:30 - right the quickest way to show that
04:32 - would be just to hide it
04:34 - that we can do but you know i want to
04:36 - also play a sound click into the sounds
04:39 - tab
04:40 - oh yay the chomp sound is already here
04:43 - i wasn't expecting that as i don't often
04:46 - use preset sprites but scratches added a
04:48 - default sound of chomp for us how clever
04:51 - well that's perfect we'll use it
04:53 - so as well as hiding we'll now start
04:56 - sound chomp
04:58 - hit the green flag and we'll give it a
05:00 - go
05:01 - chomp the apple is gone
05:04 - did that seem too easy i hope so because
05:07 - if we start the project again
05:08 - ah no apple it's still collected not to
05:12 - worry we just need to make it visible
05:15 - again so here we are back with our apple
05:18 - but issue number two if we walk off
05:20 - screen
05:21 - the apple is also here on the second
05:24 - scene too we need to ensure the apple
05:26 - knows what scene it belongs to
05:29 - we want to trigger the visibility of a
05:31 - change of scene so when i receive change
05:35 - scene then with an if else block we
05:38 - compare
05:39 - the current scene variable to
05:42 - well for now this scene scene 1.
05:46 - if it is scene 1 we show it
05:49 - and if not we hide it run the project
05:52 - and voila the apple is showing on scene
05:55 - one but running onto scene two
05:58 - great it's gone very good indeed
06:02 - good enough to eat ha
06:04 - oh wait look the apple is back
06:08 - that's not how it's meant to work but it
06:10 - does make scratchy a happy cat oh no no
06:14 - it doesn't at all because he can't
06:16 - collect it i'm so sorry scratchy
06:19 - so what is going on here
06:21 - well look our collection code is running
06:23 - here on the green flag script so once
06:26 - collected we are never waiting for it to
06:28 - be collected again making that
06:30 - impossible but when we change scene
06:32 - again we do still show the hidden apple
06:35 - once more but as i said we are not
06:37 - waiting for collection any longer so
06:39 - that's exactly what we are seeing
06:41 - now i have a cunning trick to show you
06:44 - that fixes our problem i think you'll
06:46 - like it because this trick dates back to
06:48 - the very earliest days of computer game
06:50 - programming
06:51 - first make a new variable naming it my
06:55 - scene and make it for this sprite only
06:58 - we can use this to store the scene
07:00 - number the apple belongs to
07:02 - in which case we'll set it to 1 after
07:04 - the green flag is clicked
07:07 - that then allows us to use the my scene
07:09 - variable in place of the if scene equals
07:11 - 1 over here
07:13 - great so this should not have made any
07:16 - difference yet we can just test that
07:18 - yes indeed just the same
07:21 - but now we have a special trick up our
07:23 - sleeve drop in another set my scene
07:26 - block after the apple has touched the
07:28 - player here and
07:31 - set my scene to
07:32 - the empty value
07:34 - wow what does that mean what have we
07:37 - done to this poor harmless apple setting
07:39 - its scene to nothing
07:41 - well hit the green flag and we'll give
07:43 - it a test
07:44 - it appears as normal
07:46 - we can collect it my scene changes to
07:49 - empty you'll notice and now when coming
07:51 - back to scene 1
07:53 - the apple remains invisible superb what
07:56 - we have done is not delete the apple but
07:59 - we've sent it to a different place
08:02 - the null room yes a mythical storeroom
08:05 - outside of the level where all
08:06 - non-spawned items reside this is a very
08:09 - common technique for keeping track of
08:11 - items from a game that are not currently
08:14 - in play now when we change back to scene
08:16 - 1 the apple's my scene is not one
08:19 - anymore so it simply remains hidden
08:21 - problem solved
08:23 - so this is fabulous for a single
08:25 - collectible but the thing about
08:26 - collectibles is the more the better in
08:29 - this case we really need to branch out
08:32 - to using clones clones will allow us to
08:35 - place our collectibles all around the
08:37 - level and keep track of which ones have
08:39 - been collected
08:40 - the transition to using clones is not
08:43 - too difficult either
08:44 - bring in a when i start as a clone
08:48 - this is triggered for every new
08:49 - collectible clone that we create so it's
08:52 - perfect for us to move the wait until
08:54 - script stack into like this
08:57 - now each new collectible will wait to be
08:59 - collected independently from each other
09:02 - we just need to drop in a create clone
09:05 - of myself after positioning the sprite
09:07 - here to trigger a new clone copy of our
09:09 - collectable to appear and it will start
09:12 - waiting to be collected
09:13 - the only addition we also should make is
09:16 - to set my scene back to the empty value
09:19 - after making the clone to ensure that
09:21 - the collectible sprite the one that is
09:23 - not a clone is kept in that null room
09:26 - and is not visible we only want our
09:29 - clones to be showing up now
09:31 - okay sanity check test this should work
09:34 - identically if all i've told you is true
09:38 - yes sweet we have transitioned to clones
09:42 - all ready to ramp up production and
09:44 - spawn a whole load more apples for
09:47 - collecting
09:48 - but not so
09:50 - fast because some of you may find that
09:53 - your collectibles don't always appear
09:55 - now
09:56 - don't believe me well watch this
10:00 - here everything starts up fine and the
10:02 - apple looks quite delicious
10:04 - yum
10:05 - but
10:06 - if i happen to select and drag scratch
10:08 - cat on the stage not an uncommon thing
10:11 - to do right
10:12 - behold a disaster beyond your
10:15 - imagination has occurred the apple has
10:18 - gone
10:19 - what in the world right
10:21 - if i didn't know the reason then this
10:23 - would be so frustrating
10:25 - the apple reappears if i come back into
10:27 - the first screen too
10:29 - to get it working again i just make the
10:31 - apple visible and drag it around on the
10:33 - stage
10:34 - and now clicking the green flag again
10:37 - and we're back
10:38 - so this is not a satisfactory state for
10:41 - the game to be in it's too temperamental
10:44 - to solve it you need to first understand
10:46 - what is causing it
10:48 - firstly did you know that dragging a
10:50 - sprite on the stage like we did always
10:53 - brings that sprite to the front of all
10:55 - the others it's like clicking on the go
10:57 - to front block
10:59 - the second thing to know is that the
11:00 - order the sprites are in on the stage
11:03 - makes a difference to the order in which
11:05 - their scripts are run
11:08 - yeah
11:08 - the one at the front
11:10 - will run first be it from an event
11:13 - receiver or the green flag clicked
11:15 - this is a common source of bugs in games
11:18 - where the order of sprites is not always
11:20 - the same the first time the green flag
11:22 - is clicked
11:23 - in our case if this collectible sprite
11:26 - is the front sprite
11:27 - then this green flag script runs before
11:30 - all the others so we are able to create
11:32 - these apple clones first
11:34 - then the green flag on the player sprite
11:36 - runs which starts the game loop but also
11:39 - broadcasts a changed scene event as it
11:41 - sets up the first scene
11:43 - doing so will trigger the change seen
11:46 - here in the new clones and the apple
11:48 - clones appear
11:50 - so where does this go wrong if the
11:52 - player sprite is the front most sprite
11:56 - well if the player sprites green flag
11:58 - script runs first then the broadcaster
12:00 - change scene happens before the
12:02 - collectible green flag has run
12:05 - and therefore before the apple clone has
12:07 - been created that means that once the
12:10 - apple does get around to being cloned
12:12 - the when seen change script has been
12:15 - missed and the apple doesn't reappear
12:18 - right fixes
12:20 - what would you do about this
12:23 - well
12:24 - we need to take control of the order the
12:26 - scripts are running
12:28 - so let's remove the when green flag
12:30 - clicked from the collectibles initial
12:32 - script
12:33 - we'll replace it with a new event
12:34 - receiver
12:36 - when i receive
12:37 - and make a new event
12:40 - we'll call it setup
12:45 - then in the player sprite under the
12:47 - green flag script we'll add a broadcast
12:50 - and wait block for the new event setup
12:54 - we broadcast it before the reset and
12:57 - begin level block
12:59 - the important thing here is that the
13:00 - weight from the broadcast ensures that
13:02 - the collectible sprite has finished
13:04 - creating the clones before this script
13:06 - continues to run
13:08 - this should solve any ordering problems
13:10 - so let's give it a quick test
13:14 - looking okay so i'll drag the player
13:17 - sprite to bring it to the front and then
13:18 - we can click the green flag to see
13:21 - yes the collectible is still with us bug
13:24 - squashed well done
13:27 - phew with that out of the way let's push
13:29 - on with these collectibles click back
13:31 - into the collectible sprite
13:33 - what we want now is to bring more apples
13:36 - into play
13:37 - to make this easier i first click on the
13:40 - show icon here
13:42 - this makes the real sprite visible as
13:44 - well as the clone so i can drag the
13:46 - sprite on the stage it just so happens
13:48 - to be on top of the clone and i want my
13:51 - new apple to appear just here
13:56 - next we need a new go to xy and create
13:58 - clone block we need to type in the new x
14:02 - and y locations for me that's negative
14:05 - 27 and 43.
14:08 - then be careful to drop the two blocks
14:10 - before the set scene block
14:13 - and let's run the project now we are
14:16 - seeing two apples and i can collect them
14:19 - both nice
14:21 - if we test again i can also confirm the
14:23 - collection of one apple and switching
14:26 - screens shows only the uncollected one
14:28 - remains visible as we might hope that's
14:30 - perfect really great
14:33 - so what if we want an apple on another
14:36 - scene do you know what we need to do
14:39 - easy make the apple visible
14:42 - drag it to where it wants to appear
14:44 - but this time duplicate the scripts so
14:47 - that we have a set my scene a go to xy
14:50 - and a crate clone block
14:52 - i fill in the my scene value of
14:55 - 2
14:56 - followed by the x and y from the sprites
14:58 - x and y that's under the stage
15:01 - and pop the scripts above the set scene
15:04 - block
15:05 - a quick test
15:07 - scene one
15:10 - and now scene two yes there's our apple
15:13 - sorted so easy
15:16 - easy indeed but soon this setup script
15:19 - will begin to get too long
15:21 - being good coders we should notice that
15:24 - we are repeating the same actions over
15:26 - and over to make our new collectibles so
15:28 - this is a prime candidate for wrapping
15:31 - up in a custom block
15:33 - so make a new block
15:35 - naming it place
15:37 - since we are placing collectibles on the
15:39 - level then we need an input of costume
15:42 - name
15:44 - a label
15:45 - scene
15:46 - with a matching input of scene
15:49 - and then finally a label x y and two
15:53 - inputs x
15:54 - and y
15:56 - might as well tick the without screen
15:57 - refresh
15:58 - okay then so this block is going to do
16:02 - everything we need to create a new
16:03 - collectible all in one go
16:06 - that's these four blocks then
16:14 - now let's see how these values plug into
16:16 - a fresh new place block
16:18 - the first input is the costume name
16:21 - that's apple
16:22 - notice we use a lowercase a just like
16:25 - the costume name here
16:27 - then the scene is a1
16:30 - my x is 155 and my y is negative 25 just
16:35 - the same with that done let's plug in
16:37 - the blocks inputs in the custom block
16:39 - too
16:40 - costume name to costume name scene to my
16:44 - scene
16:45 - x to x y to y
16:47 - awesome
16:49 - then we have to do the same for the next
16:52 - two collectibles too duplicate the place
16:54 - block and fill in the scene and the x
16:57 - and y values
17:08 - there that's all three collectibles
17:10 - recoded to use the same custom block we
17:13 - just have one block left over this sets
17:16 - scene to empty value now we could pop
17:18 - this on the end of the setup script but
17:20 - i think it's cleaner to put it at the
17:22 - end of the place custom block itself
17:25 - that then means we don't have to
17:26 - remember to keep it at the bottom of the
17:27 - setup scripts and this makes our lives
17:30 - easier
17:31 - throw away the rest of these old junk
17:33 - scripts and we are ready for a test
17:36 - two apples on the first scene excellent
17:38 - news
17:40 - the second one
17:42 - yes all is well i am pleased so how
17:45 - about we add a new collectible apple up
17:47 - here using our place block
17:50 - just duplicate a new place block set the
17:53 - scene to 103 now since we've moved up a
17:56 - level to position it make our sprite
17:58 - visible and i'll place it
18:01 - up here so that you have to wall jump to
18:03 - get to it
18:04 - then fill out the x and y position into
18:06 - the place blocks x and y like so
18:12 - that's it even easier than before
18:14 - wonderful
18:16 - run the project
18:18 - oh man
18:19 - did you hear that munch sound as the
18:21 - game started does that give you the
18:24 - shivers too
18:25 - i have a feeling we have a bug i'm
18:28 - expecting that when we get to the upper
18:29 - room
18:30 - [Music]
18:32 - oh yes the apple is already gone so what
18:37 - happened there
18:38 - well as soon as we create a new
18:40 - collectible we start checking for
18:42 - collisions the collectibles are only
18:44 - hidden though once the scene changes so
18:46 - there is a moment when the game starts
18:49 - where these collectibles are visible and
18:51 - can possibly touch the player
18:54 - so to stop this we need to be more
18:56 - careful and ensure we hide the
18:58 - collectible sprites before we even start
19:01 - cloning
19:02 - there another potentially dangerous bug
19:05 - squished
19:06 - now we have the positioning of these new
19:08 - items sorted we should look more into
19:10 - making them look nicer somehow when you
19:13 - bob an item up and down it just becomes
19:15 - irresistible like you're saying come and
19:17 - get me
19:18 - so where will this animation script go
19:22 - well it has to occur while we are
19:24 - waiting for it to be collected that's
19:26 - here in the when i start as clone script
19:29 - so how about we replace the wait until
19:31 - with a repeat until touching player
19:34 - block
19:35 - now we can do an animation in here while
19:37 - we're waiting
19:39 - we want to change the y of the sprite
19:41 - gradually up and down for that we need a
19:44 - multiply here for say 0.5
19:48 - we can play with this value to give a
19:50 - bigger bobbin effect and then use the
19:52 - maths syn or sine operator to give us a
19:56 - nice smooth up and down motion
19:59 - now you might feel tempted to use a
20:01 - timer variable in the right hand side
20:03 - but just to warn you that would lead to
20:05 - your collectibles appearing in slightly
20:07 - different places than you intended so to
20:10 - be consistent i'll make a new variable
20:13 - frame for this sprite only
20:16 - and use that in our sign block
20:20 - next change frame by 5 this value
20:23 - indicates how fast our object will bob
20:25 - up and down
20:27 - and finally set the frame to 0 right at
20:30 - the start of the setup script
20:34 - cool we can take a look at what we have
20:37 - made
20:40 - yeah look at that bobbing that brings
20:42 - the level to life doesn't it and makes
20:45 - them so much more desirable to collect
20:47 - too i think to complete the effect we
20:49 - just need to add a collection animation
20:51 - too as they disappear
20:53 - so back in the when i start as clone
20:56 - let's add a repeat 20.
21:02 - and we'll change y by 2 so gradually
21:05 - moving it upwards
21:08 - but while we do that we'll also fade it
21:11 - out using a change effect block
21:14 - that's changing ghost
21:17 - by five
21:19 - that will be a hundred divided by twenty
21:21 - that's five
21:22 - stuff that in before the hide block and
21:24 - that should do the job
21:26 - let's see
21:29 - chop
21:30 - yeah that's nice
21:35 - oh but wait how many apples have we
21:38 - collected we don't know we need a count
21:40 - well that's easy make a new variable
21:42 - call it apples for all sprites
21:46 - now after we play the chomp sound change
21:49 - the apples variable by one
21:52 - we just need to be careful to reset it
21:54 - to zero when the game begins so for now
21:56 - up here in the setup script just set
21:58 - apples to zero
22:04 - test again
22:06 - yeah no problem that works as expected
22:09 - and it resets too so
22:12 - that brings us nicely to the most
22:15 - exciting part of the episode where we
22:18 - look at expanding our collectible items
22:20 - to include special items such as
22:22 - a key oh yeah baby let me find somewhere
22:26 - to place it and this looks like a fine
22:29 - spot we need a new costume so in the
22:32 - collectible sprite enter the costume
22:34 - editor and we'll add a new costume again
22:37 - from the library since we have it i'm
22:39 - looking for yeah a key this one is
22:42 - perhaps a little more detailed in
22:43 - depiction than i'd like but it'll do for
22:45 - now we need to click to make it visible
22:48 - on the stage
22:49 - oh oh that's far too big i'll just
22:52 - rotate and resize the actual costume in
22:54 - the editor
22:57 - and now we can drag it into position on
22:59 - the stage
23:01 - there
23:02 - next the costume name it says key
23:06 - that would work but i'm going to change
23:08 - it to key space one
23:11 - this is so if we wanted to extend the
23:13 - game to have more than one key for more
23:15 - than one door we still can
23:17 - then we could color them or something to
23:19 - tell which doors they opened yeah that
23:22 - would be cool
23:23 - right back in the code editor we can
23:26 - duplicate the last place block
23:29 - the costume must match our new keys name
23:31 - exactly it was key one with a capital k
23:35 - this time
23:36 - the scene remains as 103 like our last
23:39 - apple but the position is 192 by 4.
23:44 - there we go
23:45 - this is exciting time to give it a test
23:48 - rushing through the level
23:50 - and here we are and we have a key yeah
23:54 - can i collect it
23:56 - oh man what sort of sound was that for a
23:58 - key a munch no no this has to change
24:02 - the code for playing the chomp is here
24:05 - in under the when i start as clone in
24:07 - the collectible sprite
24:09 - let's find a new sound for the key in
24:12 - the sounds tab
24:13 - in the library search for want it may
24:16 - not be perfect
24:19 - but it's not half bad is it
24:22 - so separate off the chomp sound and the
24:25 - change apples by one these should only
24:27 - occur now for apples
24:29 - we'll bring in an if else block
24:31 - and we place the apple script in there
24:34 - the repeat can stay below to animate the
24:36 - collection for all items
24:38 - to detect if this was an apple we need
24:41 - to check the costume name
24:44 - if costume name equals apple great
24:48 - that leaves us with the else where it's
24:50 - not an apple but something far more
24:52 - wondrous something deserving of us
24:55 - starting the wand sound perhaps
24:58 - yeah that's great but let's not change
25:00 - apples by one since this is not an apple
25:03 - no we need a completely new way of
25:05 - keeping track of the other special items
25:07 - we have collected to do this how about
25:10 - we use a scratch list
25:12 - click to make a new list
25:14 - and we'll name it collected
25:16 - and mark it for all sprites so its data
25:19 - can be shared throughout the project
25:21 - what we'll do is add an item to this new
25:24 - list after playing the one sound
25:26 - and what we add must uniquely identify
25:29 - the object we've collected so why not
25:32 - use the costume name again
25:34 - shall we see what that does
25:36 - run the project
25:37 - [Music]
25:40 - ready
25:42 - oh yeah that's cool new sounds and more
25:46 - importantly a key one in our collected
25:50 - list that's beautiful as you can imagine
25:52 - this list can be allowed to get as many
25:55 - items in it as we collect so it's very
25:57 - flexible
25:58 - what we do need to remember is to clear
26:00 - it down when the project starts
26:02 - no we don't start with a key
26:05 - let's stuff that into the when i receive
26:08 - script here delete all of collected
26:11 - sweet
26:13 - so tell me what uses a key without a
26:16 - locked door well not very useful so i
26:20 - think we'd better get busy
26:22 - this looks like a prime position to
26:23 - place one don't you think
26:25 - now we made a door before at least sort
26:28 - of we did using a platform it just went
26:30 - up and down by itself
26:32 - we are just going to code this all over
26:34 - again though
26:35 - click into the platform sprite and let's
26:38 - make a new costume for this door
26:41 - before i forget let's give it its name
26:44 - now this may seem a little odd but go
26:47 - with it and we'll also name it
26:49 - key one
26:51 - now the nice thing about this is it will
26:54 - allow us to easily match it to the key
26:56 - that opens it
26:57 - so we can draw a nice yellow door
27:01 - and i'll make sure it has a little lock
27:04 - hole on it so the player knows that they
27:05 - need to find a key
27:08 - there that looks fine
27:10 - next we go into the code
27:13 - now if you remember under the when i
27:15 - receive change scene receiver i
27:17 - separated off all of the old scripts
27:19 - when i changed my level
27:21 - so unless you are also starting again
27:23 - just leave all your ifs as they are
27:26 - what's important is that you add a new
27:29 - if under here for the room with the door
27:31 - in it
27:32 - this is scene four for me
27:34 - so if scene equals four then
27:38 - now we need a new custom block to handle
27:40 - our doors
27:42 - name it
27:43 - door at with an input of x and an input
27:47 - of y
27:48 - and then a label of key
27:52 - and an input of key name
27:54 - don't tick the run without screen
27:56 - refresh though as we will be animating
27:58 - the door within this custom
28:00 - block now move this custom block into
28:03 - some space
28:04 - and i'll drop the new block inside our
28:07 - if here
28:08 - ah this leftover show can just be
28:11 - plonked in the custom block
28:14 - so door at
28:16 - we need a position first drag the door
28:19 - to the right place on the stage
28:22 - we can use this to fill out the x and y
28:24 - values as normal
28:28 - and the key input that wants to be key
28:31 - one with a capital k just the same as
28:33 - our item in the collected list
28:36 - great i'm just going to move this define
28:39 - block into some free space
28:41 - oh look i forgot i'd left this animate
28:43 - block in here this wasn't included in a
28:46 - tutorial but was just me trying some
28:48 - things out it animates a platform back
28:50 - and forth between two points but we
28:52 - don't need it so don't worry
28:54 - yes a door we begin by showing the
28:57 - sprite and then switch costumes
28:59 - remember we named the door as key one so
29:02 - well switch costume to the key name
29:04 - input easy
29:06 - positioning the door is equally
29:08 - straightforward
29:10 - use a go to xy block and pass in the x
29:12 - and y input variables
29:15 - now the action of opening the door wants
29:17 - to be repeatable over and over so bring
29:20 - in a forever loop
29:21 - we'll wait until the door is touching
29:23 - the player before we take any action
29:26 - what happens next depends on whether the
29:28 - key has been collected or not
29:31 - using an if else we can check if the
29:33 - collected list contains the key and
29:36 - since the key has the same name as the
29:37 - door costume we can use the input
29:39 - variable keyname here too
29:42 - so if we touch the door and have the
29:44 - correct key in our collected list then
29:45 - the door wants to open let's animate
29:48 - this by repeating for 24 frames
29:51 - and change y by four that will get our
29:54 - door sliding upwards nicely
29:57 - next we'll pause it at the top for one
29:59 - second wait one second
30:01 - before bringing it back down again for
30:03 - this we repeat 24 again but change y by
30:06 - negative 4 to reverse the direction
30:09 - completely
30:10 - excellent we should be able to test this
30:12 - right away
30:14 - if we run straight over to the door we
30:16 - should be unable to open it since we
30:18 - have no key in our collected list
30:21 - so let's get the key
30:23 - and here we go
30:24 - and now
30:26 - yes celebration that's right you dance
30:29 - scratch cat because this is awesome it's
30:32 - really fun how it opens and then closes
30:35 - and you can keep on walking into it to
30:36 - open it again
30:38 - i think this might benefit though from a
30:40 - little bit more sound and i know there
30:42 - are some nice sounds in the scratch
30:44 - library that we can use here
30:46 - so in the platform sprite sounds tab
30:49 - we'll search up some new sounds they
30:51 - have buzzwor
30:54 - we'll use this for the movement of the
30:55 - door as it opens and shuts
30:59 - crunch
31:01 - but click louder twice as otherwise it's
31:03 - too quiet this is for the door pounding
31:06 - closed
31:07 - and one more
31:10 - low squeak
31:12 - this one i'm choosing to indicate that
31:14 - the door is locked
31:17 - back in the code in the door at script
31:20 - drop in a start sound
31:22 - and we want the buzz were sound pop that
31:26 - before we begin the upwards animation of
31:28 - the door here
31:30 - and we want to play it again before we
31:31 - begin the downward animation after the
31:33 - second delay
31:35 - then as i said the crunch sound should
31:38 - play when the door hits the ground
31:40 - that's here before the last weight
31:43 - start crunch sound lastly the else
31:47 - condition down here we haven't used that
31:49 - that is for when we touch the door but
31:52 - we don't have the key
31:54 - now i want us to start playing the low
31:56 - squeak sound
31:58 - however do you spot the issue with doing
32:01 - it that way
32:02 - watch this or should i say listen to
32:05 - this
32:07 - ah
32:08 - nasty the sound is starting to play over
32:11 - and over in a fast loop which makes it
32:13 - sound awful we just want a single sound
32:16 - each time we touch the door
32:18 - for this we just need to wait until the
32:20 - player walks away from the door before
32:21 - continuing the loop
32:23 - wait until
32:25 - we are not
32:26 - touching the player
32:30 - there
32:31 - right testing that again
32:34 - ah now beautiful just a single squeak
32:37 - that's good feedback
32:40 - now let's grab that key and try out the
32:42 - opening and closing sounds
32:47 - [Music]
32:50 - oh yes loving that and the crunch at the
32:54 - end is so very satisfying indeed
32:56 - i'm noticing that the door is not
32:58 - feeling very responsive to being opened
33:00 - a second time it takes a while before it
33:02 - goes up again
33:04 - oh yeah that's because we duplicated
33:06 - this wait one second after playing the
33:08 - down crunch sound this was to hold the
33:10 - door up before it came down but we don't
33:13 - need to wait once the door is closed so
33:15 - let's remove that
33:17 - okay so now
33:21 - the door opens right away cool and if we
33:24 - stay next to the door
33:26 - it doesn't just open again but requires
33:28 - us to back away and try again that's
33:30 - perfect isn't that working great i bet
33:33 - you can't wait to get this into your
33:34 - projects and don't stop with this idea
33:37 - what else could you trigger using a key
33:39 - or the pass card or anything else so
33:41 - many possibilities
33:44 - oh no i got squashed and now i have to
33:47 - say that losing a life here is far too
33:50 - quiet after having all these doors and
33:52 - collectibles making sounds we must
33:54 - quickly address that before we draw to a
33:56 - close
33:58 - click into the player's sprite and the
34:00 - sounds tab and we'll choose a new sound
34:02 - from the library there's one called oops
34:06 - oh man look at this why does scratch
34:08 - think all these words match the word
34:10 - oops that's just not helpful
34:13 - well we'll have to find it by hand it's
34:15 - in the effects category luckily it's
34:17 - alphabetical
34:19 - there it is oops
34:21 - next back in our code find with me the
34:24 - when i receive lose life script
34:28 - and before we begin the fade out
34:32 - start the sound oops
34:37 - so here we go testing sharp pointy spike
34:40 - death
34:43 - boom we lost a life and we know it the
34:46 - sound is very confirming of that
34:48 - nice
34:50 - um so any more sounds we were missing
34:52 - well apart from maybe a nice thumping
34:54 - soundtrack the main one that might be
34:56 - missing is the jumping sound
34:58 - now this needs to play in the define
35:02 - controls up and down script
35:08 - there's two places to do this in here
35:10 - just look for where we are set jumping
35:12 - to one
35:14 - we start sound jump here above the set
35:16 - jumping to one this is for the wall
35:18 - jumping
35:19 - and then down below we do it again so
35:22 - start sound jump
35:24 - this is the standard jump
35:27 - well let's go jump jump
35:31 - the sound is perhaps a little too loud
35:32 - and over the top for me i'd get annoyed
35:34 - by this far too soon
35:38 - yeah let's tone it down a tad
35:40 - find the jump sound
35:42 - i'm going to start by clicking the
35:43 - softer button three times
35:46 - then i'm going to use the fade out
35:49 - button to shorten the sound
35:50 - [Music]
35:53 - there i think four times is good
35:55 - that's nice and crisp let's see how that
35:58 - plays
36:02 - yeah i think that works what do you
36:04 - think is that sounding and looking good
36:07 - and do you have any burning requests
36:09 - that you know we need next i suspect
36:11 - some enemies may be a good plan
36:13 - [Music]
36:16 - well as i wrap up i'm just going to add
36:19 - in a final huge apple to reward the
36:21 - player for getting through that door
36:23 - but as i do let me just say i really
36:25 - hope you enjoy this video they take a
36:27 - lot of work so please do smash the like
36:29 - button and if you can subscribe to the
