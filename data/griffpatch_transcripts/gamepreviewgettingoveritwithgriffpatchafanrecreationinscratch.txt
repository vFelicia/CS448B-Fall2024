00:02 - bursting to share with you this teaser
00:03 - video for my upcoming game scratch
00:05 - edition of getting over it with Bennett
00:07 - fadi although I started playing with the
00:09 - idea of this game a few months back I
00:11 - only really got down to working since
00:13 - Leon it over the last couple of weeks
00:14 - anyhow it's almost complete and so I
00:17 - thought I'd give his little teaser of
00:18 - where we're at in development so first
00:21 - off have you played the original game if
00:23 - you have then after you've watched the
00:25 - video leave me some comments and I'd
00:26 - love to hear what you think he was
00:28 - excited as me so you'll notice that the
00:31 - game is completely scratch themed it
00:33 - starts out appropriately I think on a
00:35 - heap of green flag hat blocks but once
00:38 - you reach the foot of the mountain
00:39 - you'll find that I've gone to town to
00:41 - recreate the original games mountain
00:42 - climb using only sprites sourced from
00:45 - the scratch costume library in getting
00:47 - over it you're climbing a mountain
00:49 - assembled from the assets from other
00:51 - games - I've had a lot of fun working on
00:54 - this project so I'm stoked to get this
00:56 - shared on scratch I've only got a few
00:58 - more areas to work on mainly the game
01:00 - monologue and tidying up the ending I'll
01:02 - need to add in a game time or two for
01:04 - those who managed to get good enough to
01:06 - begin recording speedruns okay enough of
