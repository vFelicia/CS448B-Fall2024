00:00 - [Music]
00:02 - hello fellow scratchers back for more
00:04 - Geometry Dash fun well after adding the
00:07 - game over explosion effect in episode 4
00:09 - we still left our players hanging around
00:11 - needing a green flag clip to restart our
00:14 - games therefore today we will be working
00:17 - on game continuity this will include
00:19 - automatically restarting the level after
00:21 - each failed attempt counter included but
00:24 - also we'll be creating a full title
00:27 - screen with these super authentic
00:29 - animated buttons which I think you'll
00:31 - find can be added incredibly easily into
00:33 - all your own scratch projects I know
00:35 - you're just going to love them so what
00:37 - are we waiting for open your projects
00:39 - from episode 4 and save them as a fresh
00:42 - new copy for this is episode 5. guys
00:46 - let's get scratching we'll Begin by
00:50 - triggering that level restart on game
00:52 - over that should be relatively
00:54 - straightforward so firstly in the player
00:56 - Sprite scroll down to our game over
00:58 - event receiver at this point the player
01:01 - has just died and explosion particles
01:03 - are still flying around so before we can
01:05 - meet at the level we must wait for 0.7
01:08 - seconds that's just a short time for the
01:11 - explosion to settle and now we want to
01:13 - reset we must bring back the player
01:15 - since they were ghosted clear graphic
01:18 - effects that ensures they are visible
01:20 - again and then we broadcast a new
01:22 - message
01:24 - named reset level
01:27 - excellent so the level reset is going to
01:30 - be actioned in the level Sprite itself
01:32 - so click in there now
01:34 - the simplest way to reset our level
01:36 - would be to rerun these initial green
01:38 - flag scripts again so separate the
01:41 - script off at the top and attach them to
01:43 - a new when I receive hat block for the
01:46 - reset level message and then drop in a
01:50 - broadcast to reset Level under the now
01:53 - empty green flag script that should
01:55 - ensure that the game kicks off just as
01:58 - before shall we give it a try smash that
02:00 - green flag
02:02 - okay looks good except hold on are you
02:06 - seeing what I'm seeing the level Sprite
02:09 - is now doubled up and of course it is
02:11 - because when the level resets we now
02:14 - create two new clones without first
02:16 - deleting the existing ones
02:18 - so when the level resets we must first
02:21 - delete this clone but sadly we then
02:24 - can't reattach the other scripts below
02:26 - well actually we can but first we must
02:29 - surround the delete clone with an if
02:31 - block and then force it to always run by
02:34 - dropping a not block in that if
02:36 - there and now yes that looks much better
02:40 - no doubling up of the level costumes and
02:42 - we can sit back and enjoy trying to beat
02:45 - our levels without the distraction of
02:47 - having to click the green flag of course
02:49 - what we are now missing is a simple
02:51 - counter to keep track of just how many
02:53 - times we've had to restart so click into
02:56 - the player Sprite and create a new
02:59 - variable naming it attempt
03:02 - leaving it for all Sprites
03:05 - when green flag clicked we can set
03:08 - attempt to zero to initialize it
03:11 - and each time we receive the game on we
03:15 - change attempt by one wow I wish
03:19 - everything was that easy
03:21 - attempt one
03:23 - attempt two attempt three and clicking
03:27 - the green flag starts us off all over
03:29 - again that's beautiful
03:32 - so the nice thing about no longer
03:34 - relying on the green flag for restarts
03:36 - is that it frees up the green flag to be
03:38 - used to display the main Geometry Dash
03:40 - game menu and about time I hear you say
03:44 - guys let's create a new Sprite for this
03:47 - naming it menu and just for clarity I'll
03:51 - move it to the top of the Sprite panel
03:52 - as it is the first thing we'll be seeing
03:54 - in game
03:55 - now first off we need a geometry dash
03:58 - light logo we could just use scratch's
04:01 - internal text tool the pixel font is
04:03 - closest and if we then duplicate it a
04:05 - few more times adding bigger and bigger
04:07 - outline widths of various colors then
04:10 - stacking them on top of each other gives
04:12 - us quite a cool effect however if you
04:15 - prefer something a bit more wizzy then
04:17 - you can Google Geometry Dash text and
04:20 - that leads us to GD codons Geometry Dash
04:22 - font generator I've added a link under
04:24 - this video
04:25 - then we just enter the text here scratch
04:28 - dash for example choose your font
04:31 - and then under extra settings reduce the
04:33 - width to 960 pixels that's great for
04:37 - scratch but having changed the width now
04:40 - our text has been wrapped over two lines
04:42 - and if you don't want that to happen
04:44 - then I discovered we can replace the
04:46 - spaces with tilled characters and that
04:49 - works a treat
04:50 - the same blank symbol can be found under
04:52 - the symbols menu under more
04:56 - here
04:57 - then for extra padding I added a tilled
05:00 - before and after the text like so
05:03 - looking good so we can click the
05:06 - download button and save the finished
05:07 - text to our computers as a transparent
05:10 - PNG naming it logo
05:13 - then back in scratch we can then upload
05:16 - the save file as a new costume
05:20 - and doesn't that look excellent thank
05:22 - you GD colon we won't be needing that
05:24 - other costume any longer
05:26 - click that green flag and yeah we need
05:30 - to stop the actual game from starting
05:33 - so click into the level Sprite and
05:36 - delete the when flag clicked script we
05:39 - added just a few moments ago sorry about
05:41 - that
05:42 - but now as well as stopping the game
05:44 - from starting we've also lost the
05:47 - Geometry Dash floor which I was really
05:49 - quite keen on keeping visible for use on
05:51 - the title menu oh well for now we'll
05:54 - fake it go into the level costumes and
05:57 - select the entire floor
05:59 - and then click copy
06:01 - then back into the menu Sprite what
06:04 - we're going to do first is switch the
06:06 - logo into Vector mode this will allow us
06:09 - to more easily move things around so
06:11 - while holding shift drag the title
06:14 - higher up the canvas
06:15 - now hit that paste button and the floor
06:18 - should pop in down at the bottom like so
06:20 - it's looking great in the costume editor
06:22 - but it needs a tension on the stage
06:24 - let's code
06:26 - when green flag clicked
06:28 - go to the front obviously the menu is in
06:31 - front of everything else
06:32 - then make sure it's shown
06:35 - and that we switch to the correct logo
06:37 - costume
06:38 - lastly reposition it with a go to XY
06:41 - block at 0 0.
06:45 - there looking good hold on we don't want
06:48 - that attempt variable showing up on the
06:50 - game menu we can hide it using a hide
06:53 - variable attempts first thing at the top
06:56 - here
06:57 - cool so next up we need a good
07:00 - old-fashioned Geometry Dash begin button
07:02 - right smack in the middle of the screen
07:04 - now I'm pretty sure you can find a good
07:06 - graphic on scratch or the web for use
07:08 - here but right now I'm going to draw my
07:10 - own so make a new costume and name it
07:14 - play that will be important later on so
07:17 - don't forget to name it that
07:18 - this is what I'm trying to copy so using
07:21 - mostly rectangles here goes nothing
07:25 - [Laughter]
07:27 - ta-da it's practically identical what a
07:30 - masterpiece just make sure that it's
07:32 - snapped to the center of the canvas as
07:35 - I've shown you many times before that's
07:37 - important so that it can grow and Shrink
07:39 - right back into the code
07:41 - we have another costume to display so
07:44 - we're gonna need to use clones
07:46 - duplicate these two blocks the first
07:48 - pair is going to be for the Clone so
07:51 - switch to the play button costume
07:54 - and then drop in a create clone of
07:57 - myself before we switch to the logo
07:59 - costume
08:01 - now if you hit the green flag now then
08:03 - both components of the main menu will
08:04 - now be visible great I think we should
08:07 - just move that play button up a touch
08:09 - though don't you I'll try a y position
08:11 - of 15.
08:13 - yeah that's better so now for the fun
08:17 - bit if we look at the real Geometry Dash
08:20 - menu check out how these sweet buttons
08:22 - animate with the mouse over oh wow that
08:26 - is awesome it's not the standard grow
08:28 - and Shrink effect it's got some punch
08:31 - this is called a bounce transition and
08:34 - is practically coded just like we code a
08:36 - bouncing ball in scratch only with size
08:39 - instead of the Y position
08:41 - anyway we'll build this up a little at a
08:43 - time firstly we need to detect when the
08:46 - mouse is over the button when I start as
08:49 - clone
08:50 - go to the front
08:53 - and then we'll begin a forever Loop now
08:55 - there are two possibilities using IF
08:57 - else block either this button is
09:00 - touching the mouse pointer
09:02 - and if so then we can set size to 125
09:05 - percent to make it grow bigger
09:07 - otherwise the button is not touching the
09:10 - mouse pointer so set the size back to
09:12 - 100 just like it began
09:16 - right then this is like the most basic
09:18 - representation of the animation it's
09:21 - crude it works but we can do a lot
09:23 - better
09:24 - I suggest we create a new custom block
09:27 - to help us with the next step
09:29 - name it bounce to size and we need a
09:33 - numeric input of Target size that's how
09:36 - big we want the button to grow to and
09:38 - then a text label Force
09:41 - followed by another numeric input also
09:44 - named Force now this is the direction of
09:47 - growth bigger or smaller
09:49 - and for starters we'll only replace the
09:52 - top set size with our new block that's
09:55 - the growing step
09:57 - the size we want to reach is again 125
10:00 - and this time we apply a growing force
10:03 - of 2.
10:06 - to keep track of how fast this button is
10:08 - growing we're going to need a new
10:09 - variable name it speed ensuring it's
10:13 - created or this Sprite only got that now
10:17 - this pattern is one we use a lot for
10:19 - animating gravity so set speed to
10:23 - and firstly we multiply the current
10:25 - value of speed by 0.9 this is simulating
10:29 - air resistance it stops the object from
10:32 - accelerating out of control
10:34 - then to this we add the new Force
10:37 - remember this is two when the button is
10:39 - growing
10:40 - and pop that all into the set speed
10:43 - block
10:44 - cool
10:45 - finally we change the button's actual
10:47 - size change size by and drop in that
10:51 - speed variable like so
10:53 - oh I feel tingly run the project and
10:56 - hover over that button whoa whoa whoa
10:59 - that's crazy and we are growing out of
11:02 - control we need to put a limit on this
11:04 - if
11:06 - greater than
11:07 - so if the size of the Sprite becomes
11:10 - greater than
11:12 - the supplied Target size that's 125 then
11:16 - we simply set the size back to yeah
11:19 - Target size that will stop it in its
11:22 - tracks click the green flag and hover
11:25 - yes that's it
11:27 - I just have to point out though that as
11:30 - it is now it only works the first time
11:32 - after clicking the green flag as we are
11:34 - not resetting the speed variable but
11:36 - don't worry that will come because now I
11:39 - want to add in that awesome bounce
11:40 - effect when we hit the target size set
11:44 - the variable speed to a multiply block
11:48 - of negative 0.8
11:52 - multiplied by speed that will send it
11:55 - bouncing back in the direction it came
11:57 - only with a little less power than
11:59 - before did you see that that is so cool
12:02 - it really looks like it's popping out
12:04 - and bumping into something haha yeah I
12:07 - could keep doing this all day oh but no
12:09 - we must continue and add the Reverse
12:12 - Falling animation when the button is
12:13 - released uh back up here then and
12:16 - duplicate the bounce block into the else
12:18 - branch
12:19 - the target size is going to be 100. and
12:23 - the force that will be negative two so
12:26 - that the button reduces in size
12:29 - but ah man obviously there's a little
12:32 - bit more to do here my button is
12:34 - shrinking teeny weeny small I can only
12:37 - just get my mouse over it and then pow
12:40 - up they pop well the problem is located
12:44 - in this if condition when growing that
12:47 - is when force is greater than zero we
12:50 - know we have exceeded the target size
12:52 - when size is greater than Target size
12:55 - but when shrinking the opposite is now
12:58 - true we have exceeded the target size
13:00 - when size is less than the small Target
13:04 - size or written another way when size is
13:08 - greater than Target size is false equals
13:12 - false
13:13 - well that is a simple comparison is it
13:15 - not compare the true false result of
13:18 - sizes greater than Target size with the
13:21 - true false result of force being greater
13:24 - than zero this is now true when the left
13:27 - and right sides are both true
13:29 - or both false I'm not sure I'm
13:33 - explaining that very well but do take
13:34 - some time to think about it here we go
13:37 - let's see if it worked
13:39 - and wow yes it did that looks so good
13:42 - almost exactly like the real thing I'm
13:46 - very pleased and yet if I had to be
13:48 - pedantic I might say that the bounce can
13:51 - go on a little too long we could just
13:53 - round that off to be sure
13:55 - if less than
13:58 - use the absolute value if the ABS of
14:01 - speed
14:03 - is less than four then we set speed back
14:06 - to zero to remove any micro bounces
14:10 - and we can test again and gosh at least
14:13 - with my screen recorder running I can't
14:15 - really tell if it's better or not but
14:17 - anyhow it's certainly not worse so we
14:20 - are almost there we just need to make
14:22 - this button clickable
14:24 - when this Sprite clicked
14:27 - now careful we could have clicked any
14:29 - Sprite let's make sure it was the play
14:31 - button not the logo if
14:34 - the costume name equals
14:37 - if the costume name equals play
14:42 - then great this is the right button for
14:45 - safety's sake we wait until
14:47 - the mouse button is released that's not
14:51 - Mouse down
14:54 - and then we broadcast
14:57 - reset level
15:01 - testing that
15:03 - and oops the game starts but we forgot
15:06 - to hide the menu well that's easy when I
15:10 - receive reset level
15:13 - the menu Sprite and its clones will all
15:15 - receive this so stop other scripts in
15:18 - this Sprite we don't want any other menu
15:20 - Sprites to keep on running their Scripts
15:23 - then hide all the menu Sprites
15:27 - and end by deleting all the button
15:29 - clones that should do the trick ing the
15:33 - play button
15:34 - and yes it does fabulous we're almost
15:38 - done for this episode only before we go
15:40 - why don't we add a nice bit of music to
15:43 - our start menu and yes if we search in
15:46 - scratch for Geometry Dash menu music
15:49 - then you'll find someone will have
15:51 - uploaded it yeah here we go this project
15:53 - by Circle illusion
15:56 - funky nice one but it's the music that
15:59 - we're after so find the track and it's
16:01 - this second track menu music so I'm
16:04 - going to backpack that thank you very
16:06 - much
16:07 - and returning to our menu Sprite in our
16:09 - project
16:10 - go into the sound tab and drag that
16:13 - track in from your backpack and all we
16:16 - need to do for this to play is from the
16:18 - code tab drop in a new when flag click
16:21 - tap lock
16:22 - and then in a forever Loop
16:25 - we want to play the sound until done
16:29 - selecting that menu theme cool let's
16:32 - take that for a spin
16:34 - yeah nice to hear that familiar tune
16:38 - yeah the button animation is still
16:40 - Flawless loving it so let's click and
16:43 - the menu music stops and the game begins
16:45 - now that is really cool and to get back
16:48 - to our menu we just click on the green
16:50 - flag and there we go beautiful with the
16:52 - music and I'm loving it oh hold on we
16:56 - lost our attempt counter oh we can fix
16:58 - that just pop into the player Sprite and
17:01 - in the game on script drop in the show
17:04 - variable block for our attempt counter
17:07 - simple
17:09 - and with that we have come to the end of
17:12 - another episode if you've enjoyed what
