00:02 - hello fellow scratchers I've been crazy
00:05 - busy working on an epic scratch RPG
00:08 - project and I'm dead excited because
00:09 - it's destined to be a truly amazing
00:11 - tutorial series what you're seeing here
00:14 - is my current working progress build
00:15 - still far from complete but I thought it
00:18 - would be fun to share with you some of
00:20 - the journey that got me to where I am
00:21 - now you just wait until we talk about
00:24 - the level editor oh man I love this
00:26 - thing please guys do join in the
00:28 - conversation in the comments below this
00:30 - video I'd love to know what you like or
00:33 - dislike or if you see potential for
00:34 - improvements you guys can help direct
00:36 - how this project develops just so cool
00:39 - but let's start at the beginning how did
00:42 - this all begin
00:44 - a month ago I submitted a poll on my
00:47 - YouTube Community tab to gauge the
00:49 - popularity of a handful of possible
00:51 - tutorials an RPG a Sonic game puzzle
00:54 - game rhythm game we had over 8 000
00:57 - responses and more than half of them
00:58 - voted for an RPG wow exciting now the
01:03 - world of RPGs is very diverse but I had
01:06 - my suspicion that the most popular would
01:08 - be in the style of Zelda A Link to the
01:10 - Past or perhaps undertale a quick Post
01:13 - in the community Tab and my suspicion
01:15 - was confirmed the majority responded
01:17 - very positively to the Zelda theme well
01:20 - okay where do we start looking over a
01:23 - Zelda Wiki page we can find the
01:25 - Overworld map and we could see that the
01:28 - level is huge but this huge map is
01:31 - broken into smaller Square regions and
01:34 - these regions will scroll and are made
01:36 - up of a simple grid of tiles similar to
01:39 - our tile scrolling Mario game tutorial
01:42 - but the time miles oh man the tiles they
01:46 - are So Glorious so detailed and there's
01:49 - so many of them just look through the
01:52 - tile sheets in the wiki and gives you a
01:54 - flavor of what's involved to make this
01:56 - game look as good as it does and this is
01:59 - where things might get tricky how are we
02:02 - going to make our scratch RPGs look as
02:05 - good as this okay we have the scratch
02:09 - paint editor all we need to do is draw a
02:12 - super awesome tile set of our own like
02:15 - in the Legends of Zelda just draw it
02:19 - yeah scrap that what can I find on the
02:22 - internet
02:22 - the open game art site is a great place
02:25 - to start full of pre-made Sprites by
02:27 - talented Bots but I have to be careful
02:30 - that it doesn't feature too many tiles
02:32 - as the tutorial wants to stay simple
02:35 - really minimalist something simple that
02:37 - doesn't use a lot of tiles something
02:40 - exactly like this yes tiny16 by charm
02:45 - the perfect tile set for testing out
02:47 - some ideas in scratch it even comes with
02:50 - a cool adventurous Sprite useful
02:53 - the only problem is that Sprite sheets
02:55 - tend to come as single large image files
02:58 - like this one if I imported to scratch
03:00 - then well poop that's not very useful at
03:04 - all
03:04 - to be able to use these individual tiles
03:07 - we need to split them up one costume per
03:10 - tile now sometimes with small tile sets
03:14 - we can do this by hand
03:16 - but with lots of tiles even 10. this
03:19 - takes way too long and there are better
03:22 - ways for example this website I found
03:25 - easygif packed full of useful tools one
03:28 - of which is a tile splitter found under
03:32 - the split Tab and Sprite sheet cutter
03:34 - sub tab we can just upload the Sprite
03:38 - sheet that we downloaded
03:40 - and then set the tile size these ones
03:43 - are 16 by 16 and then cut now don't
03:46 - worry if you miss any of this I'll be
03:48 - going over it again in the official
03:50 - tutorial later on but yeah all the tiles
03:53 - are now separated into their individual
03:55 - files
03:56 - we download them as a zip and extract
03:59 - the files into a new folder
04:01 - and finally upload them in bulk into
04:04 - scratch
04:08 - boom all the tiles perfectly laid out
04:11 - ordered and ready to rock what a time
04:14 - saving tip so with a set of tiles all
04:17 - ready to go what kind of tile engine
04:19 - should we build
04:21 - last year we used bright clones to make
04:24 - the Mario tile stroller and this worked
04:27 - really well and there'd be no issue
04:29 - reusing it for her RPG but I never
04:32 - passed up the chance to teach you
04:34 - something new what do you know about
04:36 - tile stamping so instead of building the
04:40 - visible level from hundreds of tile
04:42 - Sprite clones we ditched the Clones all
04:45 - together instead having just one tile
04:47 - Sprite and then actually paint the
04:50 - screen manually by moving the tile
04:52 - Sprite into position and stamping the
04:54 - costume in place using the pen extension
04:57 - and then we move it and stamp again
05:00 - repeating to fill the entire screen
05:03 - the end results should look identical so
05:06 - the question is is there an advantage to
05:08 - doing it this way
05:10 - well using less clones is always good we
05:14 - can only ever have 300 at most and these
05:17 - get used up right away in a clone engine
05:20 - but also we have a bit more control over
05:23 - how our screen draws being able to
05:25 - choose exactly when and how to draw each
05:27 - title indeed we can quickly draw more
05:30 - tiles without needing to clone any new
05:32 - Sprites which will be super useful when
05:34 - making the level editor for example a
05:37 - possible downside is that stamping
05:39 - historically has proven to be much
05:41 - slower than using clones
05:43 - but I have a suspicion that this may no
05:45 - longer be the case there's only one way
05:47 - to be sure I got scratching and knocked
05:50 - up a test project stamping out a simple
05:53 - grid of tiles so I could time how
05:55 - quickly scratch could draw each frame
05:58 - and wow the performance of sprite
06:01 - stamping in scratch has seriously
06:03 - improved over the last couple of years
06:05 - indeed it's tripled in speed bringing it
06:08 - right up to the speed of the cloning
06:10 - engine that is amazing news for us thank
06:14 - you scratch development team for your
06:16 - continued work making scratch perform so
06:18 - well
06:19 - cool it's settled then we'll be learning
06:21 - how to create an efficient tile stamping
06:24 - engine in scratch how exciting but
06:28 - before I can teach you guys I still have
06:30 - a lot of work ahead of me to build the
06:32 - project myself this Avatar Sprite was
06:35 - included in the tile set so I added a
06:37 - player and then got to work building a
06:39 - minimalist level editor always a
06:41 - priority as it's hard to build levels
06:43 - without one and here we are a simple
06:46 - top-down scroller is coming together
06:48 - it's amazing what you can do with just
06:50 - four tiles isn't it these are the four
06:53 - dungeon tile costumes and then up here
06:56 - we have an Overworld Zone showing off
06:58 - the path grass and flower tiles it's all
07:01 - very simple but it gets the job done the
07:04 - level editor is accessed using the zero
07:06 - key her favorite of mine and since we're
07:08 - using stamping I was able to quickly
07:10 - code up a simple tile selection user
07:12 - interface across the bottom of the
07:14 - screen sweet but this is going to get so
07:18 - much cooler you just wait
07:22 - I'm concerned it's the second week of my
07:25 - RPG Dev work and I'm worried about how
07:28 - much work is ahead of us I decided to
07:31 - share my concerns about yet another long
07:33 - tile scrolling tutorial with the
07:34 - community was this really the way to go
07:38 - oh you guys your optimism always gives
07:41 - me a boost okay okay the majority of you
07:43 - were pretty confident that tiles were
07:45 - indeed the way to go perhaps a change of
07:48 - Avatar could spice things up this guy is
07:51 - more chunky and he has an attack
07:52 - animation too yeah I was a bit worried
07:55 - about how I was going to add that to the
07:58 - other guy who didn't come with one cool
08:00 - I like it but what about the other tiles
08:03 - picking a simple tile set was a winner
08:05 - for simplifying the tutorial but I am
08:07 - now worried that everywhere in the level
08:09 - will look the same and how will we add
08:12 - houses and rooms like in Zelda
08:14 - okay so I need a break to think about
08:17 - things so I did something completely
08:19 - different and wrote a new game in
08:21 - scratch eat the level you may have seen
08:24 - it and that was such a blast I just got
08:26 - my creative juices flowing and now it's
08:29 - week three and I'm back on the RPG
08:31 - thinking about text engines all RPGs
08:35 - need these for narrative and dialogue
08:37 - there are plenty of cool looking bitmap
08:39 - fonts available if you Google for them
08:41 - and I found a few candidates sadly since
08:44 - they are not fixed widths like the tiles
08:46 - they need splitting up by hand
08:49 - even so I got away without having to
08:52 - line them up all by hand instead
08:54 - building an automatic Sprite measuring
08:57 - script to the letters into the
08:59 - right positions for me this is awesome
09:02 - as it supports variable width lettering
09:04 - and handles word wrapping as standard do
09:07 - you smell a backpackable tutorial coming
09:09 - your way oh boy yes so watch out for
09:12 - that
09:13 - now I've had an idea perhaps if I could
09:16 - bring in a larger Sprite costume as an
09:20 - entity or prop that sit on top in front
09:23 - of the base layer of tiles this would
09:26 - allow us to add larger buildings or
09:28 - trees into our world
09:30 - this one is just manually placed to get
09:32 - a feel of how it might work and you know
09:34 - it's not that bad of course we'd need to
09:38 - now add Sprite ordering to handle being
09:39 - able to walk behind these props but we
09:42 - have my clone layering tutorial for that
09:44 - right
09:46 - week four now and I've decided this
09:49 - simple tile set and props they've got to
09:52 - go if we're going to the effort of
09:54 - creating a huge RPG series we might as
09:57 - well do things right and Go the whole
09:59 - hog with a far more epic RPG tile set
10:03 - with a bit more Googling I stumbled
10:05 - across this little gem the top-down
10:08 - Adventure Pack by oh Lobster he's posted
10:11 - it on hio and it's available for
10:13 - download to everyone for as little or as
10:15 - much as you want to donate to him and
10:17 - for those who can't afford to pay well
10:19 - that's okay too and I tell you his work
10:22 - is Top Notch very similar to the Zelda
10:26 - style we are after so huge credit to oh
10:28 - Lobster what a champion and oh my word
10:32 - there are a lot of cool tiles here I use
10:36 - Easy gift to split them up and oh wow
10:38 - the Overworld tile cheater loan accounts
10:40 - for an astonishing 250 costumes
10:43 - ouch that's a tad more than our previous
10:45 - 10 tile costumes our level editor is
10:48 - going to need a serious upgrade luckily
10:52 - I already have a plan you'll notice how
10:55 - beautifully the original tile sheet is
10:57 - laid out this makes it so easy to see
10:59 - how the tiles are intended to fit
11:01 - together it would be a shame to lose
11:03 - this layout after bringing them into
11:05 - scratch so I'm thinking we try to borrow
11:08 - the same layout as a tile picking
11:10 - palette my first idea was to have a key
11:13 - press toggle between the level editor
11:15 - and a full screen tile picker
11:18 - but that would have soon become
11:20 - laborious switching back and forth
11:22 - constantly to choose the next tile
11:23 - costume
11:25 - so instead I opted to split the screen
11:28 - leaving a five tile wide platform docked
11:31 - to the right
11:32 - of course now the tile pallet would need
11:35 - to be scrollable to access the entire
11:37 - tile set pretty cool right and boy would
11:40 - this have been far harder to achieve
11:42 - using clones can you imagine I'm really
11:45 - appreciating the freedom that stamping
11:46 - brings us and I'm looking forward to
11:48 - teaching you all about it too so yeah I
11:52 - wanted to keep this devlog relatively
11:54 - short so I'll stop right there but do
11:57 - join me next time to learn how I propose
11:59 - we tackle complex Collision regions
12:01 - between tiles what to do about tile
12:03 - layering with buildings and trees do we
12:06 - even consider over and under collisions
12:08 - and layering and what about tile Auto
12:11 - arranging or is there perhaps a better
12:13 - way to handle this considering the huge
12:16 - RPG tile set we are using well if you
12:19 - enjoyed this video then please smash
12:21 - that like button it would mean a lot to
12:23 - me and don't forget to subscribe to this
12:25 - channel now so as not to miss the next
