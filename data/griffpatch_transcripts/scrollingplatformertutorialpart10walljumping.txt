00:00 - hi guys this is Griff patch welcome back
00:02 - to part 10 of our scrolling platform or
00:04 - tutorial for scratch in this episode
00:06 - we're looking at adding the much
00:07 - requested feature wall jumping luckily
00:10 - for us this is really quite easy to
00:12 - script mainly because we added in player
00:14 - momentum in the previous episode that
00:16 - was part 9 of this series right let's
00:19 - begin by moving over to the change
00:21 - player X by custom block then scroll
00:24 - down till you see the change Y by minus
00:28 - 12 okay we're going to add in an if/else
00:31 - block and in the top part we're going to
00:36 - add in if key pressed for the up arrow
00:41 - or ever key you're using for jump then
00:43 - we want another if-else in here and then
00:46 - check greater them and check the speed X
00:52 - it's greater than zero now we need a set
00:57 - and we're going to set speed X to be
01:02 - minus 16 and then below that in the else
01:07 - set it to 16 and we also underneath this
01:12 - if want to set in err to 0 now in the
01:17 - else we want to set speed X to 0 now
01:23 - drag this in just below the change Y by
01:27 - minus 12 like so just clean up these
01:31 - scripts ok so what's happening here this
01:35 - is in the change player X by custom
01:36 - block this is called when we move the
01:38 - player left and right so if we're
01:41 - touching a platform when we move left
01:42 - and right and we try first to see
01:45 - whether we can just move up and down
01:46 - which is if we're walking up a slope if
01:48 - it doesn't manage to do that so in other
01:51 - words we've hit a wall then we go back
01:53 - to where we were but then now when we
01:56 - hit a wall we're allowing us to wall
01:58 - jump so we checked if we're pressing up
02:01 - for a wall jump so if we've hit a wall
02:03 - and we press the up key we see which
02:07 - direction we were moving in if we were
02:09 - moving to the right we now jump to the
02:12 - left
02:13 - so reach yet set a speed to the left
02:14 - here if we were moving to the left we
02:17 - now set the speed to the right so we'll
02:19 - bounce to the right at the same time we
02:22 - set to say that we are now have been in
02:25 - the air for nothing which means we're
02:27 - actually starting a new jump and lastly
02:29 - if we're not jumping we set the speed to
02:32 - zero say we've hit a wall we don't want
02:33 - it to be moving in a direction and then
02:36 - we do the normal collision detection to
02:37 - push us out of the wall again so that
02:40 - should in theory be it let's give it a
02:43 - go so before we can do that we need to
02:45 - just make the level a little bit more
02:46 - interesting so we can actually do some
02:47 - wall jumps let's go into the main
02:50 - costume and let's make a new platform
02:54 - I'll make a wall that goes up here like
02:58 - so okay let's run that so here's my
03:04 - character's normal the wall and look at
03:09 - that we have basic wall jumping simple
03:14 - as that huh so with this wall jumping
03:20 - using course go completely wild and
03:22 - design this level exactly as you want it
03:24 - to be we can make it a bit more
03:26 - interesting and add in another wall up
03:31 - here like this let's try that now okay
03:36 - so now we go yeah that could be quite
03:42 - fun now let's see if I can reproduce
03:47 - something that people have noticed on
03:48 - this flat forming engine if I can jump
03:50 - high enough it's not sure you can see it
03:52 - but I can actually go slightly through
03:54 - the floor here in fact if I get fast
03:57 - enough I will actually be able to jump
03:59 - right through the floor which is
04:01 - obviously not a very good idea I don't
04:05 - think I'm going quite high enough at the
04:06 - moment to see that let's see if I can
04:08 - make the level even higher
04:13 - you
04:14 - okay let's try that okay here I go
04:20 - and we're going down there we go so what
04:24 - happened there was I actually was able
04:26 - to go right through the bottom of the
04:29 - level and it got very confused okay so
04:32 - we can solve that because the problem is
04:33 - we're going travelling so fast that it
04:35 - can't detect the platform as we go
04:37 - through it and that's easy to fix
04:39 - simply by going to the tick custom block
04:43 - here it is here we are we're changing
04:46 - speed Y by minus 2 this is we're adding
04:50 - gravity in all we need to do is add an
04:54 - if around that change s why I like this
04:56 - and then check to see that speed Y is
05:00 - greater than minus 20 this means if
05:05 - speed Y if it gets less than minus 20 it
05:08 - won't fall any faster
05:10 - so let's just try that again that's good
05:17 - brilliant and one more fix to make while
05:22 - we're still at it and this is actually a
05:24 - scratch three issue is that we can speed
05:28 - up our scripts quite a bit simply by
05:31 - adding a new sprite which we'll just
05:34 - call blank or that doesn't need we call
05:37 - that and then you just move that that's
05:40 - the very first sprite in the game there
05:43 - we go completely blank we could add a
05:45 - comment saying this is blank scratch
05:49 - three feature if you go back to the
05:52 - player sprite here what happens when
05:54 - you're playing a game is you'll see that
05:55 - here this right here has the yellow
05:58 - board around it showing that it's
05:59 - running and it takes scratch a bit of
06:02 - time to actually draw that yellow border
06:04 - and if your sprite that are your Coney
06:06 - selecting is the first sprite even if
06:08 - you're not playing it in the project
06:09 - editor like this the game runs slower
06:12 - because it's time to draw these yellow
06:13 - borders so by having a blank sprite I
06:16 - selected there's no scripts that need to
06:18 - be highlighted and the game runs as fast
06:20 - as it possibly can and you might find
06:21 - that as she helps speed up some of your
06:23 - games I have to go through a load of my
06:25 - old projects adding them into blank
06:26 - sprites and it helped me a lot so that's
06:29 - it have fun with that wall jumping and
06:32 - I'll see you next time for another
06:34 - tutorial subscribe to the channel like
06:36 - the video and physically fetch thanks
06:38 - for watching bye
