00:02 - hello fellow scratchers i'm griff patch
00:04 - and today we are adding vertical scene
00:06 - switching to our classic platformer game
00:09 - yes that not only means you'll be able
00:11 - to walk off the left and right hand
00:12 - edges of the screen but also the top and
00:14 - bottom edges too this allows us to build
00:17 - much larger more exciting
00:19 - multi-dimensional levels not only is
00:21 - this super useful for platform games
00:23 - like this one but also for rpgs or other
00:26 - games that you might like to have a go
00:27 - at coding oh yeah the same basic code
00:30 - can be used for both
00:32 - right though before we begin just
00:34 - quickly make sure to save your projects
00:36 - as a copy and name it episode 6.
00:39 - okay let's get scratching
00:42 - we need to begin by expanding our level
00:45 - scenes
00:46 - click into the level sprite
00:48 - now you'll remember that the scene
00:49 - switching is coded around each costume
00:52 - being named scene and then a number
00:55 - as we move across the level we go from
00:57 - scene 1 to scene 2 then scene 3 and so
01:00 - on
01:01 - now i want to add a new scene not to the
01:04 - left or right but directly above scene
01:07 - 1.
01:08 - what we can do is use the number square
01:10 - technique by saying each upward movement
01:13 - doesn't add a 1 but adds
01:15 - 100 to the scene number
01:18 - that would make the scene above scene 1
01:20 - as scene
01:22 - 101
01:23 - then the scene to the right of scene 101
01:26 - is of course 102 then 103 and so on
01:32 - okay so duplicate the costume for scene
01:34 - one
01:37 - and i'm going to flip it upside down for
01:39 - now to match up with the scene below
01:42 - but you can draw this in any way you
01:44 - like
01:45 - cool
01:46 - then go to down and make it look great
01:48 - i'll add a walkway here
01:54 - now don't forget to name this new scene
01:57 - this is the scene above scene 1 so
01:59 - adding 100 that's scene 101 with a
02:03 - capital s
02:05 - now with the scene drawn and named
02:07 - correctly we need to code up this new
02:09 - scene change
02:10 - click into the player sprite and scroll
02:12 - down to the when i receive show tick
02:15 - last script
02:16 - this is already handling the player
02:18 - moving off the left and right hand sides
02:20 - of the screen it makes sense then to
02:22 - extend it to look for movements of the
02:24 - bottom and top too
02:26 - but look this costume block begins scene
02:28 - hash only has an input for an x position
02:31 - we are going to need a y position for
02:33 - this to work
02:34 - right click on the block and we'll edit
02:36 - it
02:38 - change the text label from x to be x and
02:41 - y
02:42 - and then add a new numeric input naming
02:45 - it
02:46 - y
02:47 - okay so the y inputs should be blank and
02:50 - that's the way we are going to keep them
02:52 - so don't fill in a value even of zero
02:55 - more on that in a moment
02:57 - so duplicate the two if block stacks and
02:59 - pot them right below
03:01 - we need to adapt these for changes in y
03:04 - position rather than x so remove the
03:06 - exposition blocks and in their place use
03:08 - the y position block
03:12 - the maximum height of the screen is
03:14 - different to the width it's 180 pixels
03:17 - from the middle to the top edge so we
03:19 - look for y bigger than 180
03:23 - that is off the top of the screen
03:25 - mirror that below with a check for y
03:27 - position being less than -180
03:31 - c hash plus one no now we move up a
03:34 - scene we do as we said we would and add
03:36 - 100 to the scene
03:38 - then for the down script use negative
03:41 - 100.
03:42 - that leaves the x and the new y inputs
03:46 - well the x ones we can blank out as we
03:48 - don't want to change the player's x
03:49 - position when moving up or down a scene
03:52 - but we do want to change the y position
03:55 - when we move off the top of the screen
03:58 - we must position our player back at the
04:00 - opposite edge so a new y of minus 180
04:04 - and for moving off the bottom a new y
04:07 - value of 180.
04:10 - so that's the theory we just need to
04:11 - modify this begin scene to make it work
04:17 - here's the set x block
04:19 - but now this x input may be blank we
04:23 - need to be careful not to change the x
04:25 - when this is the case
04:27 - if x is greater than blank
04:35 - then set x to the x input good
04:38 - now we can do the same for the y inputs
04:40 - by duplicating that if block
04:44 - switching the x inputs for y inputs
04:48 - and making sure to use the position
04:50 - block
04:51 - set y2
04:53 - and pop in the y input okay nearly there
04:58 - scrolling down a touch do you remember
05:00 - this very useful custom block we created
05:03 - fix collisions in direction
05:06 - the direction at the end is important
05:08 - here when moving scenes left or right
05:11 - the zero allows scratch to look up and
05:14 - down in case the player is stuck in the
05:16 - ground after the change of scene to get
05:18 - them free
05:21 - in the case where we change scene by
05:22 - moving off the top or bottom of the
05:24 - screen we don't want to search up and
05:26 - down for collisions but instead left and
05:28 - right
05:35 - we'll use an if else block
05:39 - pop a fixed collision block in each
05:43 - and then grab the x is greater than
05:45 - block from up here and we'll use that as
05:48 - the condition
05:50 - when we are setting an x position we
05:51 - want to search up and down as normal for
05:54 - a collision so leave that one as is
05:56 - but otherwise we'll assume this is a
05:58 - change of scene up or down so replace
06:01 - the second zero with a 90 degrees
06:04 - that will search first to the right and
06:06 - then to the left to get us out of
06:07 - collisions
06:08 - perfect
06:11 - shall we dance smash the green flag and
06:15 - up we go jump jump oh no oh man let's
06:18 - try that again
06:20 - if i can just time it right oh it's a
06:23 - bit tricky it turns out
06:24 - but the good news is without thinking
06:26 - about it the scene is of course
06:28 - switching correctly up and down so
06:29 - that's really great oh gosh come
06:32 - on i just need to hold right as i wall
06:35 - slide to keep attached to this tricky
06:37 - right wall yes there phew
06:40 - little celebration
06:42 - now question
06:43 - what happens if i walk off to the right
06:47 - ouch it's scene 102 but of course we
06:51 - haven't yet designed that costume so the
06:53 - costume stays on scene 101 and we get
06:56 - trapped in the wall
06:58 - i think we know what to do though right
07:01 - click into the level sprite and we'll
07:03 - duplicate scene 101
07:05 - the numbering is not quite so automatic
07:07 - anymore since we have introduced the new
07:09 - 100s it appears as scene 6 but we want
07:13 - this to be scene 102
07:17 - that's one to the right of scene 101 of
07:19 - course
07:20 - i'll do my flip horizontal trick
07:22 - repositioning the entire scene in the
07:24 - canvas
07:25 - then making sure to unselect all the
07:28 - graphics let's give that a test
07:31 - i'm holding my breath for this climb
07:34 - oh cool i think i've got the hang of it
07:36 - now and then off to the right we have
07:38 - scene 102
07:41 - success
07:42 - indeed we can switch back and forth
07:44 - between scenes 101 and 102 with ease
07:48 - perhaps i could drop down to scene two
07:50 - oh bother i added a roof to scene two so
07:53 - that's problematic as you can see you do
07:56 - have to think your levels through a lot
07:57 - more carefully when you add in up and
07:59 - down scene changes too
08:01 - we can just quickly adjust scene two
08:04 - pulling back the roofer to leave a gap
08:07 - now test test test test test here we go
08:11 - and drop down
08:14 - woohoo
08:15 - super now everything is pretty good here
08:18 - it wasn't the hardest change to add
08:20 - because luckily weird being quite
08:22 - forward thinking and most of the ideas
08:24 - were already in place from episode 2.
08:27 - before we finish this small episode
08:29 - though can i just suggest one small
08:31 - change to our vertical scene changes
08:34 - let me just re-architect scene 3 to add
08:36 - a nice vertical wall jump area making
08:39 - heavy use of holding the alt key to drag
08:41 - in a new duplicate of an existing shape
08:44 - now i'm going to duplicate the entire
08:46 - scene costume
08:50 - naming it scene 103 so it's directly
08:53 - above the previous scene and then i'll
08:55 - flip it vertically
08:57 - now i'll clean it up i want to keep the
09:00 - wall jumping area in the same place
09:03 - great
09:04 - now watch this if i get to the area on
09:07 - the level and now jump up here oh i do
09:10 - love this wall jumping
09:11 - what you should notice is that when i
09:13 - jump onto the new screen i'm often very
09:16 - close to the bottom and can slide off
09:18 - really quickly back to the previous
09:20 - screen this is okay but it does make the
09:23 - game a bit fiddly you may prefer like me
09:26 - to actually move the player a little
09:27 - further up when they enter the scene
09:29 - above
09:30 - and it's easy to do
09:32 - click into the player sprite
09:34 - and find that when i receive tick last
09:36 - script here is where the player moves
09:38 - off the top of the screen
09:40 - so instead of positioning us down at
09:42 - minus 180 that's really low down swap
09:45 - that for say minus 160.
09:49 - that's 20 pixels higher up
09:53 - let's see if we could see the difference
09:55 - jumping up here
09:59 - yes so now as we enter the next scene
10:01 - our player is positioned just a little
10:03 - bit higher up giving us more time to
10:05 - wall jump again and see what's going on
10:08 - i think that's better don't you
10:11 - well okay then so this is a shorter
10:14 - episode not so much to cover but there
10:16 - is plenty more to come very shortly but
10:19 - before i close i'm going to just come
10:21 - back to my scratch profile and show you
10:23 - a few of the amazing projects that have
10:25 - been submitted to the classic platformer
10:27 - studio from the previous episode okay so
10:30 - here we are in the mega classic

17:12 - cat platformer
17:16 - look at that it's a beautiful blue level
17:20 - and it's all contained which i really
17:21 - rather like
17:24 - in which direction i need to go in it's
17:25 - like a maze oh look it is a maze i'm
17:27 - just trapped in this maze
17:29 - work out which direction to go in get
17:31 - out
17:34 - ah i didn't take the bottom route which
17:35 - is very lucky because i would have been
17:38 - stuck
17:39 - a very tight wall jump oh yes that was
17:42 - fun
17:43 - and oh no oh oh dear i think that's the
