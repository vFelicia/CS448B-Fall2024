00:02 - hello fellow scratchers and have i got
00:05 - another epic scratch tutorial for you
00:07 - today you requested it and here it is
00:10 - health bars featured in practically all
00:12 - of our favorite games health bars are
00:15 - perfect for conveying health damage
00:17 - giving the player a sense of how they
00:18 - are doing and where to concentrate their
00:20 - focus to win their battle
00:22 - our game lemonoids is a great case in
00:24 - point these large lemons take a lot of
00:26 - damage but you can't tell how much or
00:29 - little health they have until that is
00:32 - they explode so the aim of this tutorial
00:34 - will be to create a reusable
00:36 - backpackable sprite that can be dropped
00:39 - into any scratch project to let us
00:41 - quickly add health bars to any given
00:43 - sprite or clone oh yeah challenge
00:46 - accepted let's get scratching
00:49 - to help us develop our health bars let's
00:52 - start a new project and throw together
00:54 - the most basic of games scratchy you
00:57 - have a role to play you will stay we'll
00:59 - just rename you as cat
01:01 - i want three cat clones to wander around
01:04 - the stage so when flag clicked we hide
01:07 - yes this is one of those clone factories
01:09 - i've talked about before where the
01:11 - original sprite stays hidden away
01:14 - now repeat three and create a clone of
01:16 - myself
01:17 - these three cat clones will be created
01:19 - so we need to do something with them
01:22 - when i start as a clone we'll begin by
01:25 - using a go to random position block each
01:28 - clone will then appear in a different
01:29 - location
01:30 - then point in direction
01:33 - to get a random direction we use a pick
01:35 - random with the values minus 180 to 180
01:40 - great finally we have to remember the
01:43 - sprite was originally hidden so pop in a
01:46 - show block
01:47 - cool
01:48 - let's just give that a test
01:50 - oh sweet each click of the green flag
01:52 - has our three cats randomly scattered
01:54 - around the screen pointing in all sorts
01:56 - of directions but just to make this a
01:59 - good test we might as well add some
02:01 - motion too
02:02 - after the show block drop in there
02:04 - forever loop
02:06 - then we move in steps
02:09 - perhaps three steps will do
02:11 - and just to save time we'll use an if on
02:14 - edge bounce block
02:16 - simple
02:17 - and yet that does the trick this will
02:20 - make a great test bed for our health
02:23 - bars
02:26 - okay we want the health bars to be
02:29 - backpackable right
02:30 - so click the paint a new sprite button
02:33 - and we'll name this sprite
02:35 - health bar
02:37 - we need some kind of health bar costume
02:39 - to get us started i'm going for a green
02:42 - fill
02:43 - with no outline
02:46 - i'm going to draw a rectangle but first
02:48 - zoom right in like so
02:50 - you want to be quite accurate here so
02:53 - we'll use these grid squares as our
02:55 - guide
02:56 - starting at the center of the canvas
02:58 - count five squares to the left and one
03:01 - square up
03:02 - so we will begin drawing from here click
03:05 - and drag a rectangle
03:07 - 10 squares across and one square high
03:12 - once drawn your costume should read 40
03:15 - by 4 pixels
03:17 - now using the selection tool we can drag
03:19 - the rectangle so that it snaps perfectly
03:22 - to the center of the canvas
03:24 - there we go
03:26 - and now with the shape still selected
03:29 - up the outline width to 4
03:32 - but i'm going to change the color to
03:34 - gray
03:36 - next step is to copy the shape by
03:38 - clicking the copy button
03:39 - and then right afterwards click paste
03:43 - now we have two copies of the same shape
03:45 - great set the second rectangle's outline
03:48 - back to transparent and then drag it
03:50 - back till it snaps again to the center
03:53 - of the canvas over the first rectangle
03:56 - whoa that may have seemed like a bit of
03:58 - overkill to get us to where we are but
04:00 - i'm just trying to ensure that we can
04:02 - all get this looking beautiful and
04:04 - aligned for the final project
04:06 - this looks fine we'll come back to these
04:08 - costumes again later but this is enough
04:10 - to get us started
04:12 - so now for the initial coding okay
04:14 - navigate to the coding tab
04:16 - first we set up this sprite
04:18 - when flag clicked and this is another
04:21 - cloning factory so hide this sprite
04:24 - now let's assume that each cat sprite
04:26 - will clone its own health bar
04:28 - in which case we can drag in a when i
04:30 - starters clone to trigger for each new
04:33 - health bar we display
04:34 - first thing we'll need to do then is
04:36 - position the new health bar on top of
04:38 - the cat that's cloning it
04:42 - go to
04:43 - cat
04:44 - yeah right no this isn't going to work
04:47 - we have three cat sprites and scratch
04:50 - doesn't let us select which of these
04:51 - three we are trying to go to
04:54 - this is a problem we will have to find
04:56 - another way of getting the position of
04:58 - the cat sprite that cloned us inevitably
05:00 - this almost always entails using a
05:03 - scratched list in some way or other as
05:05 - we will need to support passing a number
05:07 - of bits of information between sprites
05:10 - like the x and y position of each cat
05:12 - for example
05:13 - so let's make this new list naming it
05:17 - healths
05:18 - and this is important make sure it's
05:20 - created for all sprites we need this
05:24 - list to be shared between all sprites so
05:26 - that the health bar can see the values
05:28 - put in the list by another sprite
05:31 - now before we move away from this sprite
05:33 - it's good practice to always initialize
05:35 - your variables and lists when your
05:37 - project starts pop a delete all of
05:40 - healths here under the green flag script
05:44 - if you don't do this you may find you
05:46 - get unintended and hard to explain bugs
05:48 - down the line ever seen those projects
05:50 - that say press this green flag twice to
05:52 - play yeah not initializing variables at
05:55 - startup is often the cause
05:58 - great click back into our cat sprite
06:02 - we're going to begin by creating those
06:04 - health bar clones so find some free
06:06 - space and drop in a create clone of
06:09 - block
06:10 - but rather than cloning ourselves now we
06:13 - will clone a new health bar sprite
06:17 - but we want to somehow tell this clone
06:19 - where the cat is on the screen this
06:22 - information we will simply add to our
06:24 - new list starting with the x position of
06:26 - this cat
06:29 - and then we do the same for the y
06:31 - position
06:34 - there do you see what we are doing if we
06:36 - click these ad blocks to run them you'll
06:38 - see the x and y positions get added to
06:40 - this empty list like so
06:42 - and this happens before we then create
06:45 - the new health bar clone that means that
06:48 - the new clone will be able to pick up
06:50 - these values when it gets created and if
06:53 - we happen to have more than one health
06:55 - bar cloned at once click the add block
06:57 - again then we get another set of x and y
07:00 - positions added to the list that's
07:02 - perfect
07:03 - let's not leave these scripts hanging
07:05 - around we'll wrap them in a custom block
07:08 - make a new block and name it show health
07:12 - or show health bar if you don't mind it
07:14 - being more verbose i don't like long
07:16 - lines of code in scratch so i'll keep
07:18 - mine shorter run without screen refresh
07:21 - and okay and we simply attach the define
07:24 - block to our new health bar spawning
07:26 - script down here yeah this is going to
07:29 - work great our next decision is where in
07:32 - the cat sprite scripts should we use
07:34 - this new show health block
07:37 - well since it's cloning a new health bar
07:40 - we might assume it should do so before
07:42 - the main movement forever loop begins
07:44 - here
07:45 - yeah we'll run with that idea now each
07:47 - of the three cloned cats will spawn its
07:50 - own health bar but if we click back into
07:52 - the health bar sprite we now need to use
07:55 - the x and y positions in the health's
07:57 - list to position each clone
08:00 - right so throw away the old go to cat
08:03 - meh
08:04 - and we'll replace it with a set x2
08:10 - and a set y2 block
08:13 - the x position is the first item in the
08:16 - health's list
08:21 - and the y position the second item
08:24 - set y to item
08:26 - two of healths
08:29 - okay that's fine but if a second health
08:31 - bar sprite is cloned
08:33 - it will need to read positions three and
08:35 - four right
08:37 - well it would except after reading in
08:39 - these two items we are now going to
08:41 - delete them from the list to tidy up
08:44 - delete one of health's
08:46 - that is delete item one of health
08:48 - and with that item gone all the other
08:51 - items shift up
08:52 - so to delete what was item 2 we actually
08:56 - just delete item 1 again job done
08:59 - so with the new health bar positioned we
09:01 - should make sure it is shown
09:03 - start with a go to front layer to ensure
09:06 - it's displayed in front of everything
09:08 - else
09:08 - and then show
09:11 - wonderful because that means we are in a
09:13 - good place to give this project a test
09:15 - punch that green flag and let's see what
09:18 - we have made
09:20 - okay first for the positives we are
09:22 - successfully cloning one health bar per
09:24 - cat and what's more the health bars do
09:27 - initially appear where each cat spawns
09:30 - clicking the green flag over and over
09:31 - shows this to be true
09:33 - but the problem we face is that the
09:35 - health bars stay where they are and the
09:37 - cats move off we need to somehow tie
09:40 - these sprites positions together
09:43 - let's jump back into the cat sprite
09:45 - so we initially show and thus clone our
09:48 - health bars here this is after the cat
09:50 - sprite itself is cloned but before it
09:53 - starts to move around and therein lies
09:55 - the problem to keep the health bar
09:57 - tracking around with the cat we'd need
09:59 - to somehow keep feeding the healths list
10:02 - with the up-to-date positions of each
10:04 - cat
10:05 - it's a problem because that generally
10:06 - would mean quite a lot of coding to
10:08 - manage creation linkage updates and
10:11 - deletion of the list data and their
10:13 - respective clones but this is supposed
10:16 - to be a simple tutorial so i have a most
10:19 - interesting alternative
10:22 - simply move the health bar block from
10:24 - above the forever loop to be the last
10:26 - block inside the forever loop instead
10:30 - now before you scream but that will
10:31 - clone loads of health bars
10:34 - don't panic run the project
10:36 - that will create loads of health bars
10:39 - wow funky
10:41 - the good news here is that the health
10:43 - bars are following the cats it's just
10:45 - that doing so is at the cost of creating
10:47 - a new clone each time and well
10:50 - all these clones left behind
10:53 - as soon as a new clone is created the
10:55 - old one is superfluous and it needs to
10:57 - be deleted
10:59 - well to do that we need to return to the
11:01 - health bar sprite
11:03 - so what we are saying is right after the
11:05 - health bar is cloned
11:07 - we want to delete it again
11:09 - well that's not quite right because if
11:11 - we run that you'll see that the clones
11:13 - are deleted so quickly that we never
11:15 - even get to see them on the screen no
11:16 - that is too soon
11:18 - what we need is to wait until scratch
11:21 - has displayed the clone and then delete
11:24 - it
11:25 - this trick you've probably seen before
11:27 - we just drop in a weight block but wait
11:29 - for a very suspicious zero seconds
11:33 - how will that help well no matter how
11:35 - long you wait for in scratch using a
11:37 - weight will always pause long enough for
11:39 - the screen to refresh
11:41 - thus our health bar will appear
11:44 - before right away being deleted ready
11:46 - for the next frame
11:48 - run the project
11:50 - oh yeah baby now we are rocking you
11:53 - would never know that these health bars
11:55 - were in fact not moving but that we are
11:57 - continually cloning new ones the timing
11:59 - is such that it appears as a perfect
12:01 - single tracking animation i just love it
12:04 - we can hide the health list now no need
12:07 - to keep that in view
12:09 - so with the health bars moving around
12:11 - correctly we can focus on getting them
12:13 - to function like real health bars
12:15 - showing different health levels
12:16 - depending on the current health of each
12:18 - sprite
12:20 - but just before we do that i just want
12:22 - to add in one more tweak it doesn't
12:24 - really apply to this three cat test game
12:26 - but sometimes the sprites with health
12:28 - bars might move off the screen if that
12:31 - happens we don't want to be displaying
12:33 - this health bar any longer so
12:35 - if
12:37 - not
12:38 - touching edge
12:44 - if not touching the edge we are on
12:46 - screen
12:47 - this is the good case
12:48 - then we can do the go to front show and
12:50 - wait but if not then we will drop
12:53 - through and just delete the health bar
12:55 - right away
12:58 - just test that it still looks okay
13:00 - yep just the same great
13:03 - so let's check out the health bar
13:05 - costume
13:07 - at present we have only one costume and
13:10 - it represents a full health
13:12 - but as the sprite gets damaged we will
13:14 - need to show this health bar depleting
13:17 - okay
13:18 - let me step you through how i would draw
13:20 - these costumes
13:22 - we'll begin by preparing this initial
13:24 - costume select the inner green rectangle
13:27 - and then click the copy button
13:30 - then right away hit paste and we end up
13:32 - with two rectangles there
13:34 - we can select the first one again and
13:36 - change its fill color to black
13:39 - that's the depleted health color
13:41 - now grab that nice green rectangle and
13:43 - snap it back to the center of the
13:45 - drawing canvas it should then fit
13:47 - perfectly over the black one
13:50 - right the first costume is going to
13:52 - represent minimal health
13:54 - drag the right hand edge of the green
13:57 - bar to the left until it covers just one
14:00 - grid square that looks good but it would
14:03 - be even better if we colored it red
14:06 - oh yes that's more like it so on we go
14:10 - duplicate the costume and we'll expand
14:12 - the red rectangle by another grid square
14:16 - not only that but we'll also shift the
14:19 - color to the right just a bit
14:22 - the idea is that we'll slowly bring it
14:24 - back across to the green color when
14:26 - health is full
14:28 - and we repeat this process duplicating
14:30 - the costume stretching across by another
14:33 - grid square and shifting the color over
14:35 - and over keep doing this until we
14:37 - approach a full health bar and the color
14:40 - should reach fully green you should find
14:43 - this happens at costume number 10
14:46 - splendid but don't stop there we
14:49 - actually need one more costume
14:52 - the costume 11 will be for our fully
14:55 - empty health bar so just select the
14:58 - green bar and delete it all together
15:01 - so why did we add the empty costume to
15:03 - the bottom here wouldn't it make more
15:05 - sense to have it at the top so that all
15:07 - the costumes were in order from empty to
15:09 - full
15:10 - yeah we could do that but one little
15:13 - scratch quirk can make this order work
15:15 - better we all know that sprite costumes
15:18 - begin at costume number one well an
15:21 - empty health bar surely would make more
15:23 - sense at costume zero don't you think
15:26 - well
15:27 - watch this
15:28 - if we switch costumes and i'll just pop
15:30 - in an edition block so that i can use
15:32 - numbers in here
15:34 - we switch to costume number one
15:36 - there we go the first costume appears
15:39 - but it just so happens that when you
15:40 - switch costumes to costumes less than
15:43 - one scratch wraps around and start
15:46 - cycling back from the last costume again
15:49 - well that means costume zero is actually
15:52 - the last costume in our list of costumes
15:54 - so ta-da by having the empty costume as
15:58 - the last costume we literally have also
16:00 - got it as costume02 and that will make
16:03 - scripting really nice and easy clever
16:06 - trick right
16:07 - okay return that back to the normal size
16:10 - and we'll add the switch costume block
16:12 - to the right after we position the
16:14 - health bar here
16:17 - we are going to tell this sprite how
16:19 - much health the cat sprite has
16:21 - and we'll do this in the same way we
16:23 - tell it the position using the health's
16:25 - list
16:27 - this will be item 3 of health's yeah
16:30 - another item means we need a third
16:32 - delete block still only deleting item 1
16:35 - though but before we make use of this we
16:38 - should consider how health bars work
16:41 - here is a little weedy enemy he's got
16:43 - full health that's fine but look here
16:46 - comes a boss and boy they have oh so
16:50 - much more health so do we draw his
16:52 - health like this
16:54 - no of course not we draw the health bar
16:57 - just the same for both enemies it's just
17:00 - that the weedy enemies bar will go down
17:01 - a lot faster so health bars are really
17:05 - health percentage bars at 100 they are
17:08 - full and at zero well they are empty we
17:11 - can represent empty as zero and full as
17:14 - one
17:16 - so what does this mean for our change of
17:18 - costume here
17:19 - it means a health of one should display
17:22 - costume number ten
17:23 - and that's the full health costume so we
17:26 - just need to multiply item three by
17:29 - ten
17:30 - of course if you want to use more or
17:32 - less costume levels for your health
17:33 - sprite then just adjust this number
17:35 - accordingly
17:36 - great quickly now click back into the
17:39 - cat sprite i am dead excited to get this
17:42 - health working
17:43 - okay the define show health script
17:46 - we need to add the third item this will
17:49 - be the cat's health but we don't yet
17:51 - have a health to set
17:53 - well let's think ahead right click on
17:56 - the define block and choose edit
17:59 - we want to show the health at a given
18:01 - level so add a new input named
18:04 - health
18:05 - but rather than have each cat pass this
18:07 - in as a percentage we'll simplify this
18:09 - by adding the label of
18:11 - and another input for max that is max or
18:15 - total health
18:17 - and while we are here let's also add in
18:20 - some more features
18:22 - the label offset y
18:26 - and an input of y
18:28 - this will be used to bring the health
18:30 - bar above or below the cat sprite rather
18:32 - than being splatted right in the middle
18:34 - yeah that was never looking good so
18:36 - first off let's sort out the health
18:39 - we need a divide block to calculate the
18:41 - sprite's health as a percentage we
18:43 - simply divide the input health
18:46 - by max health
18:48 - and that will always give us one for
18:50 - full health and zero for no health and
18:52 - this y-offset input we're going to just
18:54 - add this to the y position of the sprite
18:57 - like so
18:59 - of course we now need to fill in the
19:01 - show health block over here with some
19:03 - input values
19:04 - for starters we'll assign each cat 10
19:07 - out of 10 for health and try an offset
19:10 - upwards of 40 pixels
19:13 - right this is it pummel that green flag
19:16 - oh yes so right off we can see that the
19:19 - health bars have moved up above each cat
19:21 - that's cool but of course if you want
19:23 - the bar below then you might just switch
19:25 - to use an offset of say -40 instead
19:29 - there yay
19:30 - just play around with that until the bar
19:32 - is positioned where you want it
19:34 - next let's try reducing the health by
19:36 - half to five out of ten
19:40 - oh yeah so cool oh zero out of ten it's
19:44 - game over for these cats this is
19:46 - wonderful we can stuff in any health
19:48 - values here and a health bar's update to
19:50 - reflect the cat's health levels
19:53 - so we are almost there let me just show
19:55 - you how we can use this in a game
19:58 - to begin with we need a health variable
20:02 - make a new variable health and it must
20:05 - be for this sprite only so that each cat
20:07 - has its own health level
20:09 - then when the cat is cloned we set
20:12 - health to let's say three
20:14 - so a cat can take three hits max
20:17 - then we pass the health variable in as
20:19 - the first input to the show health block
20:21 - like so and make sure to change the of
20:24 - to reflect the fact that the max health
20:27 - is now three
20:28 - so they start with three out of three
20:30 - health
20:31 - to represent the cats getting damaged
20:33 - when this sprite's clicked
20:35 - just change health by minus one
20:40 - shall we give that a test oh you're in
20:42 - for it now cats click you and again
20:46 - and again
20:47 - now that worked just as planned three
20:49 - clicks and they are all out of health
20:51 - i guess it would make sense at this
20:53 - point to delete the clone yeah why not
20:55 - if health is less than one
21:00 - delete this clone
21:04 - click click click
21:06 - click click click
21:07 - click click click i win yay
21:10 - well you get the idea right so we have a
21:14 - really cool working health bar system
21:16 - going on here and the aim was to make
21:18 - this a really easy to backpack sprite so
21:21 - that it could be brought into any game
21:23 - well we're almost there the only issue
21:25 - is that this show health script is not
21:28 - in the health bar sprite so if we were
21:31 - to backpack it now we would be missing
21:33 - an important part of the scripts
21:35 - well no problem drag a copy of the
21:38 - define block into the health bar sprite
21:42 - now if you look at the finished health
21:43 - bar sprite everything is contained and
21:46 - ready for backpacking and although this
21:48 - show health bar script is not used in
21:50 - this sprite really it is now easy to
21:52 - drag it out into whichever sprite we
21:54 - need to use it in
21:56 - to demonstrate what i mean let's take
21:58 - the health bar drag it into our backpack
22:01 - and we'll add the health bars to
22:03 - lemonoids
22:04 - brilliant we are ready to go load up
22:07 - your lemonoids project and if you
22:09 - haven't followed that tutorial yet then
22:11 - no worries it's only three episodes so
22:13 - you could catch up otherwise just strap
22:15 - in and enjoy the ride take it all in and
22:17 - try adding these to your own games in a
22:19 - similar fashion so at present the player
22:22 - doesn't have health a bit of an
22:23 - oversight perhaps we'll have to come
22:25 - back and remedy that in another episode
22:28 - however these unfortunate lemons they do
22:30 - have health so we'll start there and add
22:32 - health bars to the lemons
22:34 - our first job is to open up our
22:36 - backpacks and drag the health bar sprite
22:39 - into the game
22:42 - next we need to take the define show
22:44 - health block and drop it into the lemon
22:48 - sprite
22:50 - cool
22:51 - now you can drop this script into as
22:53 - many sprites as need health bars it
22:56 - doesn't have to be just one
22:58 - let's click into the lemon sprite
23:01 - just need to tie that up a bit
23:03 - there that's better now we need to
23:05 - locate the main lemon movement scripts
23:08 - find with me the when i start as clone
23:10 - script
23:11 - here it is a forever loop containing all
23:13 - the movement blocks so if we scroll down
23:16 - to the bottom the best place to bring in
23:18 - our show health block would be right
23:20 - here after all the movement is complete
23:23 - the health bar is straightforward as we
23:25 - already have the health variable for
23:27 - this purpose
23:29 - the max health is a little bit more
23:30 - tricky we don't have one yet and what's
23:33 - more different size lemons have
23:36 - different amounts of health so to get
23:38 - around that we'll make a new variable
23:40 - named
23:41 - max health
23:43 - and of course it's for this sprite only
23:47 - we can drop it in on the right of the of
23:50 - health of max health that's right we
23:53 - just need to be careful to actually set
23:55 - max health don't we just before we do
23:58 - though let's also set the offset y to
24:01 - negative 30 so the health bar appears
24:03 - below the lemon
24:05 - okay so scroll up to the define new
24:08 - enemy script
24:10 - this is where the lemon clones are being
24:12 - created we also set the health to 15
24:15 - right here
24:16 - so right after that set max health to
24:18 - match it 15. or better still just use
24:22 - the health verbal
24:24 - wow that wasn't so hard shall we give it
24:26 - a test
24:27 - yeah hey
24:28 - look at that the lemon is looking very
24:31 - tough and with its own health bar and
24:33 - shooting it reduces its health nicely
24:36 - let's destroy it
24:38 - and now this is something do you see a
24:40 - problem each small lemon is showing us
24:42 - having very minimal health right away
24:45 - now you may like this but my intention
24:48 - is that their health bars reset back to
24:50 - full
24:51 - the reason they are showing low is that
24:53 - even the smaller lemons currently have a
24:54 - max health of 15.
24:57 - so where do we split these lemons
24:59 - find the define enemy hit script
25:02 - scroll right down until you see the
25:03 - delete this clone
25:05 - this is the point where the lemon splits
25:07 - into smaller lemons health has already
25:09 - been set to the reduced amount just
25:11 - above so we can just set max health to
25:16 - the newly assigned health value
25:20 - testing again
25:21 - and now after they split each lemon's
25:23 - health resets and we have a better
25:25 - representation of lemon health
25:27 - ah but perhaps having the health bar on
25:30 - every lemon is a little ott
25:32 - some games like to hide the health bar
25:34 - when the enemy is on full health or we
25:36 - could do that but i quite like seeing
25:38 - the health bar on all the powerful
25:40 - enemies so instead find the when i start
25:43 - as a clone script
25:45 - and wrap our show health block in an if
25:47 - block
25:50 - and will only show the health bar on
25:51 - enemies with a max health greater than
25:54 - 1. that is lemons that need more than
25:56 - one hit to be destroyed
25:59 - play testing again here we go
26:04 - and now this this is a nice compromise
26:08 - the larger lemons have health bars and
26:09 - the smaller lemons don't
26:11 - brilliant all that's missing now is to
26:14 - add a health bar under the player 2. do
26:17 - you think you know how to add that
26:20 - well if not don't worry because i'll be
26:22 - making the official episode 4 soon
26:23 - enough and that will surely be a feature
26:26 - but i do hope you don't stop here i want
26:28 - to see these health bars in all sorts of
26:30 - other projects it's just too easy now
26:33 - for you to include them you'll find a
26:35 - link to the scratch studio for this
26:36 - tutorial in the video description so you
26:39 - simply must submit your game so that i
26:41 - can check them out that would be amazing
26:44 - let me know in the comments how you get
26:45 - along whether the cunning clone spamming
26:47 - approach is working for you or if you
26:49 - have any problems because there's so
26:51 - many ways to go about these things and
26:53 - i'm quite up to explaining other
26:54 - approaches in the future
26:56 - but for today that's all we've got time
26:59 - for if you've enjoyed the video smash
