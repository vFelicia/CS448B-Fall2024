00:00 - hello in this video we're going to take
00:03 - a look at installing eclipse which is a
00:06 - integrated development environment so
00:10 - hopefully by now you've installed the
00:12 - Java SDK and what you need is some kind
00:17 - of editor to work in because Java
00:20 - programming is basically about creating
00:23 - text files and in those text files
00:26 - instead of writing in a human language
00:28 - for example like English you write in
00:31 - the Java programming language and then
00:33 - the software development kit that you've
00:36 - already installed will behind-the-scenes
00:38 - turn those into actual Java programs now
00:43 - you can write Java code in any kind of
00:48 - text editor even in sort of Windows
00:51 - notepad or Mac TextEdit or whatever you
00:55 - like but there is specialized software
00:59 - designed to make it easy to work with
01:01 - Java code so one option would be one
01:07 - good option for example would be to use
01:10 - a an editor that's actually designed for
01:15 - programmers to work with like a
01:17 - programmers editor and at the moment I'm
01:20 - here at the end of 2019 Visual Studio
01:24 - code is actually a great option but we
01:28 - won't be using it in this course and I
01:29 - will explain why well if you search for
01:32 - Visual Studio code so this this is not
01:36 - Visual Studio Visual Studio is a is what
01:40 - we call an IDE an integrated development
01:43 - environment but we're not going to be
01:46 - using that either although I think you
01:47 - can so if you search for Visual Studio
01:49 - code you'll find that there's a this is
01:55 - actually a an open-source programmers
01:58 - editor from Microsoft and it's really
02:02 - really good it's really excellent I
02:03 - highly recommend it and you can install
02:06 - all kinds of plugins in it that make it
02:08 - work with various languages including
02:10 - Java
02:11 - now the problem with using a code editor
02:15 - to do your programming is that you've
02:19 - still got to somehow compile your
02:21 - programs that is you've got to take the
02:23 - text that you write and turn it into an
02:26 - actual piece of software and then
02:28 - actually run it so one thing that
02:33 - probably a fair few Java programmers
02:35 - actually do is they will use a
02:39 - programmers text editor like Visual
02:42 - Studio code like Emacs or even vim
02:44 - something like this and then they'll on
02:48 - the command line they'll actually
02:49 - compile and run their programs I'm not
02:54 - going to be using the command line in
02:57 - this course I don't think and a reason
02:59 - for that is that I'm using a Mac and you
03:02 - may be using Windows or Linux or a Mac I
03:06 - don't know and the actual sort of
03:09 - command line commands that you would
03:11 - need to write in a console to compile
03:14 - your Java programs would be slightly
03:16 - different between different operating
03:18 - systems I want to make this course in a
03:20 - way that it's good for anyone
03:22 - using any operating system within reason
03:25 - and another reason that I'm not going to
03:28 - be using a command line is that most
03:30 - professional Java Java programmers do
03:34 - actually use a thing called an IDE now
03:38 - IDE stands for integrated development
03:40 - environment and that's a fancy way of
03:43 - saying a text editor that specialized
03:47 - for usually for a particular programming
03:50 - language and it will also have buttons
03:52 - to do things like compile your programs
03:55 - in other words take take the text and
03:57 - turn it into a program an actual piece
03:59 - of software and run the programs so that
04:03 - we don't have to mess around with the
04:05 - command line at all and one that we are
04:07 - going to use in this tutorial is a very
04:10 - excellent very popular completely free
04:13 - IDE called Eclipse so I'm going to ask
04:17 - you to search for Eclipse for Java
04:21 - developers because that's what what we
04:24 - will be
04:24 - using Eclipse you can use it to write
04:27 - code in various programming languages
04:30 - and of course we want the one there
04:32 - specifically configured to develop Java
04:35 - programs so if you search for the
04:38 - Eclipse IDE for Java developers and go
04:41 - to that at eclipse.org and then download
04:45 - the one for your operating system I can
04:47 - see here it says a newer version of this
04:50 - is available is available here so I'll
04:52 - just click on that link get latest
04:54 - version of it you really want the
04:56 - absolute latest in this case and
05:01 - download the version for your operating
05:03 - system and install that and then all you
05:09 - have to do is start it up sometimes
05:12 - people find that there are error
05:15 - messages when eclipse starts Eclipse
05:19 - does depend on you already having
05:20 - installed the Java SDK so you have to do
05:24 - that first if you've done that and then
05:27 - you install eclipse and you get an error
05:28 - message again don't be afraid to put
05:31 - that error message into Google so if it
05:34 - says you know no matter how obscure it
05:36 - is if it says something like cannot find
05:38 - Java then type into Google Eclipse
05:42 - cannot find Java or whatever the error
05:44 - message says and see what the solution
05:47 - to it is this this initial few steps up
05:51 - is particularly frustrating or they can
05:54 - be hopefully everything will go smoothly
05:56 - but some people are going to find that
05:58 - this doesn't go smoothly and at that
06:01 - stage it's really easy to just give up
06:02 - and say I don't know what's going on
06:04 - here it's too confusing it's normal to
06:07 - feel confused at this stage especially
06:09 - if you do encounter an error message but
06:11 - you just have to get through this
06:13 - particular bit and once we got to the
06:15 - point where we can actually run run
06:18 - Eclipse write a program and run the
06:20 - program and that's all working then
06:22 - we'll have a lot smoother journey so
06:24 - just this initial bit that's a bit
06:26 - tricky so after you've installed Eclipse
06:29 - start it up
06:31 - and you should see something that looks
06:33 - like this and Eclipse usually starts up
06:37 - with with the scream that looks similar
06:40 - to this when eclipse starts it might ask
06:44 - you to set your workspace directory and
06:48 - what that is it's just a folder where
06:51 - eclipse is going to put your code so you
06:53 - can create that folder in advance if you
06:56 - like put it in your your Documents
06:59 - folder or whatever call it workspace
07:02 - call it anything you like it doesn't
07:04 - matter and then you have to just tell
07:06 - eclipse to put your code in that folder
07:10 - so in other words you set your Eclipse
07:12 - workspace to that folder and if you
07:14 - change your mind later in one of the
07:17 - menus here in the file menu there's this
07:20 - option to switch workspace and you can
07:24 - use that option to switch to a different
07:26 - folder by default it will be called
07:28 - workspace but it doesn't have to be
07:30 - that's that's not important at all so
07:32 - you can set that to wherever you like
07:35 - because I'm on a Mac here my directory
07:39 - structure looks like this it starts with
07:41 - a slash on windows it will probably look
07:43 - a little different but that does that
07:46 - doesn't matter okay so hopefully you can
07:51 - get to this point where you can see
07:53 - Eclipse running and then we don't need
07:55 - this we don't need this whole screen
07:58 - here so I'm just going to close it with
08:01 - the sort of cross in the corner here or
08:04 - however you close windows on your system
08:07 - and then we'll see something that looks
08:09 - like this quite intimidating but as
08:12 - you'll see it's not so bad we're going
08:14 - to learn it bit by bit
08:15 - and by the end of this course you'll
08:18 - feel I think fairly familiar with using
08:22 - Eclipse Eclipse has an absolute ton of
08:25 - features and you can even install more
08:27 - fire plugins but we won't need most of
08:30 - those features so there's no need to be
08:32 - frightened of it it is a bit
08:34 - intimidating when it starts up but
08:36 - you'll see it it's not so bad ok in the
08:39 - next video we will look at actually
08:41 - creating a Java program and until then
08:44 - happy coding
