00:00 - in this video we're going to look at
00:01 - Loops in Python we're going to see how
00:04 - we can run code repeatedly specifically
00:07 - we're going to look at for Loops for
00:10 - Loops are called for Loops because they
00:13 - usually use the keyword for in most
00:16 - programming languages and python is no
00:19 - exception so supposing I have some code
00:22 - like this I want to write hello but I
00:25 - want to print hello multiple times okay
00:28 - I can duplicate it and if we run this we
00:32 - know what that's going to do we get
00:34 - hello printed three
00:35 - times but now supposing I decide I want
00:38 - it to print something different like
00:41 - goodbye then well now I've got to change
00:44 - all of them and I'm already getting
00:47 - frustrated this is
00:50 - boring but now we've done
00:53 - it in fact repeated code is usually a
00:58 - sign that you're doing something wrong
01:00 - there's usually a better way to do it if
01:02 - you've got the selfsame code repeated
01:05 - multiple times whether it's one line of
01:07 - code or whole blocks of code that are
01:10 - repeated you want to avoid that in
01:13 - general let's get rid of this and
01:16 - instead of doing that I'm going to write
01:20 - for
01:21 - I in range and this is actually a
01:25 - function and I'm going to pass the value
01:28 - three to the function and at the end of
01:30 - this we have a
01:31 - colon and underneath that indented I'm
01:34 - going to write print hello and if we run
01:39 - this it prints hello three times now
01:42 - there's a lot to remember here when you
01:44 - first encounter this but the secret to
01:46 - remembering it is just to type it out a
01:49 - few times yourself and experiment with
01:52 - it of course you can change this number
01:55 - to whatever you like and have python
01:59 - print hello or whatever you prefer
02:02 - multiple times as many times as you like
02:04 - we can break this down a bit further so
02:07 - what's this I what's that doing there
02:10 - well that's actually a variable it's the
02:13 - name of a variable that I just made up
02:16 - in general we want variable names to be
02:20 - more than one letter we usually want
02:22 - them to describe what their purpose is
02:26 - we want to ER on the side of having
02:30 - excessively long variable names if
02:31 - anything that's preferable usually to
02:34 - having variable names that are too short
02:37 - and too cryptic we want them to be
02:39 - descriptive but in the context of Loops
02:42 - it's common to give a variable a onlet
02:46 - name and the most common choice is I so
02:50 - this actually does create a variable
02:53 - called I now this range function creates
02:57 - a range object which is used by this
03:02 - four syntax to obtain the values 0 1 2
03:07 - and three in this particular case and it
03:09 - sets I to each of those values in turn
03:14 - so we could print I out here as
03:17 - well let's maybe put a space there and
03:21 - would like to do something like this
03:23 - except I of course is an integer and
03:26 - this is a string so let's cast I to a
03:29 - string
03:30 - like
03:32 - this and now if we run
03:34 - this it prints hello 0 hello one hello 2
03:38 - hello
03:40 - 3 so this for Loop syntax is running
03:44 - this code block which at the moment
03:45 - consists of only one
03:47 - line repeatedly four times and every
03:51 - time it runs I is set to a different
03:53 - value it's set to the values 0 1 2 and
03:57 - three the four here you might think that
04:00 - specifies how many times the loop should
04:03 - run and in these simple cases you can
04:06 - think of it like that but really it's
04:09 - specifying the end of the
04:11 - range so the range is going to start by
04:14 - default at zero and it's going to go up
04:17 - to but not including whatever number you
04:20 - write here so this is basically creating
04:23 - a range of numbers 0 1 2 and 3 and we're
04:26 - setting I equal to each of the numbers
04:28 - in that range that's why in is there one
04:31 - after the other and then we can do what
04:33 - we want with I one possibility is we can
04:36 - just print it so try this out for
04:38 - yourself you can experiment with it a
04:41 - little bit I always recommend that you
04:43 - can try adding more lines in
04:46 - here you can try printing different
04:48 - things you could print the value of I
04:50 - just by itself without the hello you
04:52 - could even try doing arithmetic with I
04:55 - if you're feeling really adventurous but
04:58 - the main thing is just to type this out
05:00 - a couple of times and verify for
05:03 - yourself what this actually does there's
05:05 - actually a lot in this small bit of
05:08 - syntax and we will explore it more later
05:11 - on but for the moment you just need to
05:14 - get a little bit used to using this so
05:17 - that you know how to execute a block of
05:19 - code repeatedly a specified number of
05:22 - times hello you've been watching a free
05:25 - sample from my Python and machine
05:27 - learning for complete beginners course
05:29 - course I'm uploading enough videos from
05:31 - the start of the course to get you
05:34 - started with python and machine learning
05:36 - the full course is absolutely massive if
05:38 - you're interested in it please click the
05:40 - link in the description the complete
05:43 - course covers not only basic python but
05:45 - also some fairly Advanced python even
05:48 - some desktop programming stuff and then
05:51 - goes on to machine learning and
05:53 - artificial intelligence until next time
05:56 - happy coding
