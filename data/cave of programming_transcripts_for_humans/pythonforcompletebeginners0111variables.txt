00:00 - in this video we're going to take our
00:02 - first look at variables which are one of
00:05 - the fundamental building blocks of
00:07 - computer programs so the first thing I'm
00:09 - going to do is just make a copy of this
00:11 - file let's copy this by one means or
00:15 - another here I'm going to use the CPU
00:17 - command which works on my computer
00:19 - probably works on yours too if you're
00:21 - using Powershell or have macro Linux and
00:25 - I'm going to create variables.pi
00:30 - then I can close this and open that now
00:33 - what I can actually do here is I can
00:36 - associate this text for example with a
00:39 - name and then I can use the name instead
00:42 - of a text
00:44 - so let's try it
00:46 - I can type really anything I want here
00:49 - it's important to follow some coding
00:52 - convention though and the coding
00:54 - convention I'm following involves giving
00:57 - variables names with lowercase letters
01:00 - you can use numbers just not at the
01:02 - beginning you can't use spaces and you
01:05 - can separate different words
01:08 - using underscores if you want so let's
01:11 - for example say greeting
01:13 - and don't worry about memorizing this
01:15 - stuff
01:17 - you'll gradually pick it up if you
01:19 - continue practicing and working through
01:21 - the course let's say greeting equals
01:24 - and set it equal to this which I'm going
01:26 - to take out of here
01:30 - notice that we have to have quotes
01:32 - around text to denote it as text we can
01:36 - actually use single quotes or double
01:38 - quotes it doesn't matter in Python now I
01:41 - can use greeting where previously I used
01:45 - this text
01:47 - so if I run this now
01:52 - you can see it works exactly the same as
01:55 - before let's maybe have another variable
01:58 - let's call this I don't know a question
02:00 - we should try to give variables
02:03 - names that are as meaningful as possible
02:05 - but it is a bit difficult to make up
02:07 - really meaningful names in just a demo
02:11 - so let's say question equals
02:14 - this text here
02:18 - and let's output that question
02:24 - just going to rearrange this a bit I'm
02:26 - going to use a blank line here to
02:28 - separate these two blocks of code to
02:29 - make them look a bit nicer
02:31 - and we'll try running it and there we go
02:34 - it works just as before I am going to be
02:36 - hitting you with some lingo but again
02:39 - don't worry about memorizing that you're
02:41 - going to get used to it if you continue
02:43 - to go through the course
02:45 - so this we call a string most often we
02:50 - could also call it a string object
02:53 - we'll talk about objects later on and we
02:57 - could call it a string literal meaning
02:59 - it's something that I've literally typed
03:01 - directly into the program
03:03 - these we can call both of these
03:06 - variables we could call them even string
03:08 - variables because they refer to Strings
03:11 - but we can make them refer to something
03:14 - else later on if we want
03:16 - they're not permanently fixed at
03:18 - referring to their corresponding strings
03:21 - we can change them which is why we call
03:23 - them variables
03:25 - this is what we call the assignment
03:27 - operator so it's an equal sign and I
03:32 - think one thing that confused me when I
03:34 - started computer programming is that I
03:36 - had been used
03:37 - to equations in mathematics and in
03:40 - mathematics this would say this is equal
03:45 - to this
03:46 - now it's true that it they are somehow
03:49 - equivalent to each other now that I've
03:51 - done this
03:54 - but
03:56 - really the meaning of this operator a
03:58 - single equal sign which we call the
04:01 - assignment operator is to in some sense
04:04 - assign this value to this so it takes
04:08 - what is on the right of it and assigns
04:12 - it to what is on the left of it now this
04:14 - may sound complicated but all you need
04:16 - to take away from this video is how to
04:20 - create simple string variables like this
04:22 - and then output them with print later on
04:25 - so try this out for yourself create some
04:28 - variables and then output the values of
04:31 - those variables with print really all
04:35 - we're doing is giving these bits of text
04:38 - a name that we can then use later in the
04:40 - program and the way I've arranged this
04:43 - is not important
04:44 - the only things that are important is we
04:46 - can't have space on the left hand side
04:48 - here we can put blank lines in wherever
04:51 - we like though
04:52 - and we have to
04:55 - we say declare a variable before we use
04:59 - it so if you imagine that the python
05:01 - interpreter is going to read this
05:03 - program starting at the top and going
05:05 - downwards
05:06 - it has to have seen this before we can
05:09 - do this otherwise it's not going to work
05:12 - so this
05:14 - will have to be above this so The
05:17 - Interpreter reads it as it works
05:19 - downwards through the file so do try it
05:22 - out for yourself
05:24 - and we're going to be getting gradually
05:26 - more and more sophisticated in our use
05:28 - of variables but if you practice the
05:30 - basics like this then that will stand
05:32 - you in good stead when things get more
05:34 - complicated later on this is a free
05:38 - video from my course Python and machine
05:41 - learning for complete beginners I'm
05:43 - releasing the first couple of chapters
05:45 - of this course completely for free on
05:48 - YouTube to get you started with python I
05:51 - plan to upload new videos here to
05:53 - YouTube every Monday and every Thursday
05:56 - for at least a couple of months if
05:59 - you're interested in the complete course
06:01 - which teaches you python from scratch
06:04 - and eventually progresses to things like
06:07 - creating graphical user interfaces and
06:09 - using neural networks principal
06:12 - component analysis cluster analysis all
06:15 - that stuff and much more besides then
06:18 - you can find a link in the description
06:20 - or just go to this URL on the screen
06:23 - right here if you finish the whole
06:25 - course you'll be able to write all kinds
06:27 - of general purpose programs in Python
06:29 - and use Python to do machine learning
06:32 - and artificial intelligence as well
06:34 - thank you for watching until next time
06:37 - happy coding
