00:01 - hello this is John from cave of
00:03 - programming calm in this tutorial we're
00:05 - going to look at inner classes in Java
00:08 - so I've created a basic class in Eclipse
00:13 - that has a main method and I'm going to
00:16 - create a new class here and we're going
00:17 - to give this new class some inner
00:19 - classes so I'm going to right click my
00:22 - package here and go to new class and
00:27 - I'll call this class robot just to have
00:30 - some kind of an example to work with
00:32 - click finish
00:35 - I don't want the main method in it
00:36 - actually and I'm going to give robot
00:39 - some instance data and just just again
00:42 - it's just as an example I'm going to
00:43 - give it a private private static no not
00:49 - private not static sorry private int ID
00:52 - that'll do so every robot has an ID and
00:56 - I'm also going to implement a
00:57 - constructor so that we can set the ID
00:59 - and to do that I'm going to right click
01:03 - and go to source and generate
01:08 - constructor using fields tick ID and
01:11 - click OK so I could have just type this
01:13 - myself but I was quicker I got rid of
01:15 - soup here because that's not call to
01:17 - super is not needed so the constructor
01:19 - just takes an ID and sets this private
01:22 - field using the ID passed in so now of
01:26 - course we can create robots already
01:29 - let's give this one more method actually
01:32 - let's give it a public void start method
01:38 - and in start I'll just put a sisal and
01:41 - I'll say starting robot plus ID there so
01:51 - now I can use that by going to my main
01:55 - method here and creating a robot so they
02:00 - equal to a new robot our possibly ID
02:02 - seven and then click do robot start like
02:06 - that ok so that's all pretty
02:09 - straightforward starting robot seven
02:12 - now let's take a look at inner classes
02:15 - so there's this three main kind of cases
02:21 - here that I can think of we've we've
02:23 - already looked at anonymous classes in
02:26 - this series of tutorials and anonymous
02:29 - classes are a kind of inner class we're
02:31 - going to look at three more cases here
02:35 - so in Java you can declare classes
02:38 - actually pretty well anywhere and we've
02:41 - seen in previous tutorials that you
02:42 - could declare class here or here the
02:45 - only rule is that you can only have one
02:46 - public top-level class in each file and
02:51 - the name of this got matched the name of
02:52 - the file sis is robot in robot Java but
02:56 - I can create a I'm going to Claire a
02:58 - class within the robot class and let's
03:01 - look first at non static in their
03:05 - classes or nested classes they're also
03:08 - called so I can declare class here and
03:11 - say class let's say brain like this and
03:17 - this class will now have access to add
03:23 - the instance data of the robot class so
03:27 - let's give this maybe one method public
03:29 - void think sort of brain thinks and we
03:34 - could have a cyst out in here and say
03:37 - robot plus ID plus is thinking so I'm
03:49 - accessing here I could give class
03:52 - instance data itself but the point I'm
03:55 - trying to make is that I'm accessing
03:57 - non-static and accessing instance data
04:01 - of the outer robot class CA within this
04:04 - in a class and then I could do stuff
04:07 - like in my start method of robot I could
04:10 - say for example brain brain equals new
04:14 - brain and brain dot not Brian as my
04:20 - brother's name actually brain dots think
04:24 - now if I run this let's go to aperture
04:27 - and run it says robot seven is thinking
04:32 - so this this is a nested class row and
04:37 - in a class and classes like this what
04:40 - they're what they're probably most often
04:43 - used for is just logically grouping bits
04:46 - of outer classes like here the robot
04:48 - might be made a pervert you might have a
04:50 - brain and legs and heart and so on I
04:52 - don't know about heart but different
04:55 - parts of it anyway and we can we can
04:58 - group those different parts if we want
04:59 - to using inner classes and I can I can
05:02 - use the access modifiers like this
05:05 - probably should be private and that
05:07 - would work just fine now I actually you
05:10 - can also I'm going to show you something
05:12 - here that's a little bit weird but if
05:14 - you've understood what I'm saying so far
05:16 - basically that's that's the end of it
05:18 - really and in fact you can find a really
05:21 - good example of using an inner class if
05:24 - you look at in in this series of
05:28 - tutorials I've got a I've got a video on
05:32 - implementing the iterable interface in
05:35 - collections and if you're watching this
05:37 - on youtube you can find that by going to
05:40 - the cave of programming channel and
05:43 - looking for my collections videos if
05:45 - you're watching on udemy or somewhere
05:47 - else I think on udemy calm I've
05:49 - incorporated the collections videos as
05:51 - part of Java for beginners and you can
05:53 - find the link to the udemy course by
05:55 - going to WWE programming comm but in
05:59 - under the collections section of this
06:03 - series I've got a video on implementing
06:06 - iterable and that uses a inner class
06:09 - like this to implement an iterator which
06:12 - then can iterate through the data of the
06:15 - enclosing class the instance data of the
06:19 - enclosing class and that's a classic
06:21 - example of this and if you want to test
06:23 - your skills with this you could try
06:25 - implementing the iterable interface in
06:28 - Java
06:28 - maybe after watching that video now you
06:31 - might wonder if you can create separate
06:34 - classes of this brain here
06:37 - from outside the robot class and the
06:40 - answer is yes but I've I don't think
06:42 - I've ever seen anyone really do that the
06:45 - most common it is common to use in a
06:48 - classes like this outside of the class
06:51 - that they are declared in but then
06:53 - usually you'll have a method that would
06:55 - create a instance of your inner class
06:59 - and return it and you can see that if
07:02 - you implement iterable for example there
07:04 - isn't another weird syntax I'm just
07:06 - going to show you for the sake of
07:07 - completeness here which is that if we
07:09 - were to make this public like that in a
07:13 - table here we've got an instance of
07:15 - robot here and we could in fact do this
07:18 - we could say robot brain so robot brain
07:23 - is the type here we've got robot with
07:27 - the inner class brain let's let's call
07:30 - this variable brain equals and now we
07:33 - need an instance of the robot class
07:36 - robot dot and we say robot new brain I
07:42 - think I've got that right and I've never
07:45 - actually seen anyone do this so is you
07:48 - don't really I won't really worry about
07:49 - it I just wanted to show you for
07:51 - completeness and then we can use this
07:54 - brain outside of robot so I click run
07:57 - and it says robot seven is thinking
08:00 - again now once again you'll notice that
08:03 - when you create an instance of robot you
08:06 - do not automatically create an instance
08:08 - of the inner classes you have to do it
08:10 - explicitly somewhere and that's pretty
08:12 - much always done within the class itself
08:15 - within some method but you can as you
08:18 - can see do it outside the class with
08:20 - this weird syntax here and but I've just
08:23 - never seen anyone actually do that I
08:25 - don't really know why you'd need to do
08:27 - it and it's much more common to make the
08:31 - inner classes like private or just not
08:34 - give an access specifier in which case
08:36 - they'll default to a guest package level
08:39 - access so this is only going to work
08:44 - if the brain was declared public so
08:50 - let's save that and so yeah so that's
08:56 - that's inner classes and that they're
08:57 - normally used like this within the
09:00 - enclosing class and you might have a
09:02 - method that returns for example brain in
09:04 - this case this could return brain that
09:06 - would also be pretty typical now a
09:08 - second client kind of in a class are
09:11 - static in a classes which are pretty
09:14 - simple actually so we could have here
09:17 - for example let's say battery we could
09:21 - have a a static static class battery and
09:28 - that put brackets in and I could have a
09:33 - method that say public void charge it
09:36 - charges the battery and let's just say
09:38 - in here whoops get rid of that don't on
09:42 - that and that should be I do on that
09:46 - yeah there we go
09:47 - okay so probably void charge and it's
09:49 - just cuts this out in here and just say
09:51 - battery charging now because this is
09:56 - static we can't refer to this ID and by
10:01 - all means type this code up for yourself
10:03 - and and try out chapter that is the case
10:06 - but I could not do for example plus ID
10:08 - here
10:09 - that would give me an error unless they
10:12 - were to declare ID static and a static
10:14 - in a class can access static instance
10:16 - variables of and in closing out a class
10:19 - but what you usually use static in a
10:22 - classes for are it's just a it's just a
10:26 - way of grouping
10:27 - classes together so let's say in this
10:30 - case you've got robots and they can have
10:36 - interchangeable batteries so you might
10:37 - want to create a robot battery outside
10:40 - of this class and then pass it to
10:42 - whatever robots need that charge battery
10:45 - so we could do here outside and a robot
10:49 - class we could say robot battery battery
10:54 - equals new row
10:56 - battery and this syntax unlike this
11:00 - syntax this syntax is actually pretty
11:03 - typical and very common in Java or
11:05 - pretty pretty common and then we can
11:07 - save battery charge and then let's run
11:11 - this and it says battery charging so
11:16 - non-static inner classes are used where
11:19 - you need to group together some
11:20 - functionality and you need the class to
11:23 - have access to the instance variables of
11:26 - the enclosing outer class static inner
11:29 - classes are used let's make this public
11:32 - to be explicit static inner classes are
11:36 - used basically where you just want a
11:39 - normal class that isn't associated with
11:43 - instances of the enclosing outer class
11:45 - but you want for some reason you want to
11:48 - group it with the outer class so you
11:51 - could have robot battery robot dot CPU
11:55 - whatever you like but the point is it's
11:57 - grouped with robot and other than that
11:59 - apart from that it's really just a
12:01 - normal class so the static inner classes
12:04 - are like normal classes that just happen
12:06 - to be grouped with other classes and you
12:08 - use this kind of dot syntax now there is
12:13 - finally one last thing that should tell
12:16 - you about which is that you can declare
12:18 - classes even within methods and so I
12:21 - could say yeah like class temp I don't
12:23 - know maybe like that and this word have
12:30 - access to ID so let's give it a method
12:33 - public void do something like that and
12:40 - we could say here Sissel ID is plus ID
12:50 - it would also have access to stuff we
12:54 - declare in here so if I say a string
12:57 - name equals Robert Robert the robot and
13:03 - we could say yes it's out
13:06 - and my name is plus name save that and
13:17 - the error will surely go away what we're
13:21 - done oh yeah
13:26 - and but I forgot this will work but this
13:30 - this has to be final and this follows
13:32 - the same rules for like anonymous
13:35 - classes that if you have a method in an
13:39 - anonymous class and we've seen this
13:40 - before it can only refer to local data
13:43 - if it's final but it can refer to
13:45 - instance data absolutely fine and then
13:48 - so we haven't got an instance of this
13:50 - class yet but we could create one by
13:53 - saying ten attempt equals new ten that's
13:56 - creating instance and then we can say
13:59 - temp dot do something and when we run
14:05 - this start method of course now we are
14:09 - going to do all this we're going to
14:11 - create this temp type and declare an
14:15 - instance of it and run the do something
14:16 - method so I'll run this like this
14:19 - battery-charging there we go
14:21 - my name is Robert all that stuff so
14:25 - again this is sometimes useful it's not
14:29 - completely uncommon maybe it's most
14:34 - often useful if you need a instance of a
14:37 - class to pass to another method and and
14:41 - for some reason you don't want to use on
14:42 - an anonymous in a class which is which
14:45 - you could do I you just want to you just
14:48 - want to Matt you just want a class that
14:50 - you only want to use in this method
14:52 - crate instance of it only in this method
14:54 - because you can't refer to this now
14:56 - outside this method and you can't make
14:59 - it private or public or protected or
15:01 - anything either because the scope of
15:05 - this type as well as these of course the
15:08 - variables is between these brackets here
15:11 - is scoped to this method so that Sena
15:15 - classes in Java this is actually it's
15:18 - actually relatively
15:19 - simple and if it seems confusing that's
15:22 - just because you haven't practiced it
15:23 - and I'd recommend typing out some code
15:26 - and trying to think of some little
15:29 - scenario yourself and create create a
15:32 - class of each different type the nested
15:36 - class like this the static in a class
15:40 - like this and I kind of I'm not sure
15:43 - what to call this but kind of a local
15:44 - class as well and you'll soon get the
15:48 - hang of it and if you want some advanced
15:50 - practice try implementing iterable in
15:52 - Java and you can watch my video on that
15:54 - as I said before that's it for this
15:58 - tutorial and there's going to be more
16:01 - tutorials in this course of course of
16:04 - course it'll be more tutorials in this
16:06 - course certainly and I plan to tackle
16:09 - enum and serialization and stuff like
16:12 - that so stay tuned and you can always
16:15 - find out what my latest videos are by
16:19 - going to WWF of programming comm and
16:26 - you'll find all my latest stuff on there
16:29 - so let's save this time and until next
16:31 - time happy coding

Cleaned transcript:

hello this is John from cave of programming calm in this tutorial we're going to look at inner classes in Java so I've created a basic class in Eclipse that has a main method and I'm going to create a new class here and we're going to give this new class some inner classes so I'm going to right click my package here and go to new class and I'll call this class robot just to have some kind of an example to work with click finish I don't want the main method in it actually and I'm going to give robot some instance data and just just again it's just as an example I'm going to give it a private private static no not private not static sorry private int ID that'll do so every robot has an ID and I'm also going to implement a constructor so that we can set the ID and to do that I'm going to right click and go to source and generate constructor using fields tick ID and click OK so I could have just type this myself but I was quicker I got rid of soup here because that's not call to super is not needed so the constructor just takes an ID and sets this private field using the ID passed in so now of course we can create robots already let's give this one more method actually let's give it a public void start method and in start I'll just put a sisal and I'll say starting robot plus ID there so now I can use that by going to my main method here and creating a robot so they equal to a new robot our possibly ID seven and then click do robot start like that ok so that's all pretty straightforward starting robot seven now let's take a look at inner classes so there's this three main kind of cases here that I can think of we've we've already looked at anonymous classes in this series of tutorials and anonymous classes are a kind of inner class we're going to look at three more cases here so in Java you can declare classes actually pretty well anywhere and we've seen in previous tutorials that you could declare class here or here the only rule is that you can only have one public toplevel class in each file and the name of this got matched the name of the file sis is robot in robot Java but I can create a I'm going to Claire a class within the robot class and let's look first at non static in their classes or nested classes they're also called so I can declare class here and say class let's say brain like this and this class will now have access to add the instance data of the robot class so let's give this maybe one method public void think sort of brain thinks and we could have a cyst out in here and say robot plus ID plus is thinking so I'm accessing here I could give class instance data itself but the point I'm trying to make is that I'm accessing nonstatic and accessing instance data of the outer robot class CA within this in a class and then I could do stuff like in my start method of robot I could say for example brain brain equals new brain and brain dot not Brian as my brother's name actually brain dots think now if I run this let's go to aperture and run it says robot seven is thinking so this this is a nested class row and in a class and classes like this what they're what they're probably most often used for is just logically grouping bits of outer classes like here the robot might be made a pervert you might have a brain and legs and heart and so on I don't know about heart but different parts of it anyway and we can we can group those different parts if we want to using inner classes and I can I can use the access modifiers like this probably should be private and that would work just fine now I actually you can also I'm going to show you something here that's a little bit weird but if you've understood what I'm saying so far basically that's that's the end of it really and in fact you can find a really good example of using an inner class if you look at in in this series of tutorials I've got a I've got a video on implementing the iterable interface in collections and if you're watching this on youtube you can find that by going to the cave of programming channel and looking for my collections videos if you're watching on udemy or somewhere else I think on udemy calm I've incorporated the collections videos as part of Java for beginners and you can find the link to the udemy course by going to WWE programming comm but in under the collections section of this series I've got a video on

a classic example of this and if you want to test your skills with this you could try implementing the iterable interface in Java maybe after watching that video now you might wonder if you can create separate classes of this brain here from outside the robot class and the answer is yes but I've I don't think I've ever seen anyone really do that the most common it is common to use in a classes like

need an instance of the robot class robot dot and we say robot new brain I think I've got that right and I've never actually seen anyone do this so is you don't really I won't really worry about it I just wanted to show you for completeness and then we can use this brain outside of robot so I click run and it says robot seven is thinking again now once again you'll notice that when you create an

this case this could return brain that would also be pretty typical now a second client kind of in a class are static in a classes which are pretty simple actually so we could have here for example let's say battery we could have a a static static class battery and that put brackets in and I could have a method that say public void charge it charges the battery and let's just say in here whoops get rid of that don't on that and that should be I do on that yeah there we go okay so probably void charge and it's just cuts this out in here and just say battery charging now because this is static we can't refer to this ID and by all means type this code up for yourself and and try out chapter that is the case but I could not do for example plus ID here that would give me an error unless they were to declare ID static and a static in a class can access static instance variables of and in closing out a class but what you usually use static in a classes for are it's just a it's just a way of

whatever robots need that charge battery so we could do here outside and a robot class we could say robot battery battery equals new row battery and this syntax unlike this syntax this syntax is actually pretty typical and very common in Java or pretty pretty common and then we can save battery charge and then let's run this and it says battery charging so nonstatic inner classes are used where you need to group together some functionality and you need the class to have access to the instance variables of the enclosing outer class static inner classes are used let's make this public to be explicit static inner classes are used basically where you just want a normal class that isn't associated with instances of the enclosing outer class but you want for some reason you want to group it with the outer class so you could have robot battery robot dot CPU whatever you like but the point is it's grouped with robot and other than that apart from that it's really just a normal class so the static inner classes are like normal classes that just happen to be grouped with other classes and you use this kind of dot syntax now there is finally one last thing that should tell you about which is that you can declare classes even within methods and so I could say yeah like class temp I don't know maybe like that and this word have access to ID so let's give it a method public void do something like that and we could say here Sissel ID is plus ID it would also have access to stuff we declare in here so if I say a string name equals Robert Robert the robot and we could say yes it's out and my name is plus name save that and the error will surely go away what we're done oh yeah and but I forgot this will work but this this has to be final and this follows the same rules for like anonymous classes that if you have a method in an anonymous class and we've seen this before it can only refer to local data if it's final but it can refer to instance data absolutely fine and then so we haven't got an instance of this class yet but we could create one by saying ten attempt equals new ten that's creating instance and then we can say temp dot do something and when we run this start method of course now we are going to do all this we're going to create this temp type and declare an instance of it and run the do something method so I'll run this like this batterycharging there we go my name is Robert all that stuff so again this is sometimes useful it's not completely uncommon maybe it's most often useful if you need a instance of a class to pass to another method and and for some reason you don't want to use on an anonymous in a class which is which you could do I you just want to you just want to Matt you just want a class that you only want to use in this method crate instance of it only in this method because you can't refer to this now outside this method and you can't make it private or public or protected or anything either because the scope of this type as
