00:00 - hello in this section of the course
00:03 - we're going to take a bit of a look at
00:05 - strings and then after that we'll be
00:07 - able to get on to actually doing loops
00:11 - and things like that so it will start to
00:12 - look more like a real computer program
00:16 - strings are are used for dealing with
00:20 - text basically so says the name the word
00:23 - string in programming lingo means some
00:27 - text it's like a string of letters you
00:30 - could say let me show you a slightly
00:32 - quicker way of creating a new project
00:34 - first so I'm going to go to file new
00:36 - Java project I'm going to fill in the
00:39 - name let's call it strings and I'm just
00:41 - going to click finish straight away so
00:44 - the Java version is set to my default
00:46 - anyway and that's what I want
00:48 - click finish because we're using Java 11
00:51 - here it asked me if I want to create a
00:52 - module and we're not going to use that
00:54 - for the moment softly don't great and
00:57 - there we've got our project so I can do
00:59 - the same as usual right click go to new
01:02 - class call it app put it in a package
01:05 - which I'll make up a name for our caller
01:07 - application as usual and say that I want
01:11 - public static void main finish okay so
01:14 - we just missed out one screen but it's a
01:16 - slight time saver so we've seen that you
01:19 - can write things like int yeah cats
01:25 - equals seven or we could write double
01:28 - height equals a 5.3 so these are just
01:38 - variable names that we make up and these
01:40 - are primitive data types
01:42 - int and double used for storing whole
01:45 - numbers and floating-point numbers
01:47 - respectively both of them can store
01:49 - positive or negative values and they
01:52 - both have a sort of minimum minimum or
01:54 - maximum value that you can store using
01:57 - them and you can find out what that is
01:59 - if you just search for Java primitive
02:02 - data types and look at that page what if
02:06 - we want to use text with text we use a
02:10 - variable type called string
02:12 - and this has a capital has an upper case
02:16 - first case it has an upper case first
02:19 - letter let's say string and I'll call it
02:23 - name so again this is just the name of a
02:26 - very bond making it up I'm calling it
02:28 - name and I'm going to set I'm going to
02:30 - assign that the value John because
02:35 - that's my name so let's let's get rid of
02:38 - these
02:40 - why does string have an upper case first
02:44 - letter here instead of lower case well
02:46 - the answer is string is not a primitive
02:49 - datatype it's actually a thing in java
02:52 - that we call a class and in that respect
02:55 - is similar to app app is a class we're
02:57 - creating ourselves string is a standard
03:00 - class that's part of the Java API or
03:04 - application programming interface it's
03:07 - part of Java essentially so string is a
03:11 - class and it's a variable type here so
03:16 - it's a type of variable string alright
03:18 - so we can output that with this out
03:21 - assistant out of print line let's output
03:24 - name and let's just run that and it says
03:29 - John as you might expect there are lots
03:32 - of things that we can do with strings
03:34 - and we'll start looking at those in the
03:37 - next video until next time happy coding

hello in this section of the course we're going to take a bit of a look at strings and then after that we'll be able to get on to actually doing loops and things like that so it will start to look more like a real computer program strings are are used for dealing with text basically so says the name the word string in programming lingo means some text it's like a string of letters you could say let me show you a slightly quicker way of creating a new project first so I'm going to go to file new Java project I'm going to fill in the name let's call it strings and I'm just going to click finish straight away so the Java version is set to my default anyway and that's what I want click finish because we're using Java 11 here it asked me if I want to create a module and we're not going to use that for the moment softly don't great and there we've got our project so I can do the same as usual right click go to new class call it app put it in a package which I'll make up a name for our caller application as usual and say that I want public static void main finish okay so we just missed out one screen but it's a slight time saver so we've seen that you can write things like int yeah cats equals seven or we could write double height equals a 5.3 so these are just variable names that we make up and these are primitive data types int and double used for storing whole numbers and floatingpoint numbers respectively both of them can store positive or negative values and they both have a sort of minimum minimum or maximum value that you can store using them and you can find out what that is if you just search for Java primitive data types and look at that page what if we want to use text with text we use a variable type called string and this has a capital has an upper case first case it has an upper case first letter let's say string and I'll call it name so again this is just the name of a very bond making it up I'm calling it name and I'm going to set I'm going to assign that the value John because that's my name so let's let's get rid of these why does string have an upper case first letter here instead of lower case well the answer is string is not a primitive datatype it's actually a thing in java that we call a class and in that respect is similar to app app is a class we're creating ourselves string is a standard class that's part of the Java API or application programming interface it's part of Java essentially so string is a class and it's a variable type here so it's a type of variable string alright so we can output that with this out assistant out of print line let's output name and let's just run that and it says John as you might expect there are lots of things that we can do with strings and we'll start looking at those in the next video until next time happy coding
