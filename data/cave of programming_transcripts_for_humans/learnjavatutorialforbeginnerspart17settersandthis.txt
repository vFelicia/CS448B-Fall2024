00:17 - hello this is John from cave mob
00:20 - programming calm and this is a tutorial
00:23 - on setters onset methods in Java
00:25 - sometimes known as mutators and we're
00:29 - also gonna look at that this keywords a
00:31 - little bit so I'm in eclipse I've got my
00:34 - main program already set up here and I'm
00:36 - gonna create a class up here which I'll
00:38 - call frog just to give it a name I'll
00:41 - give frog a string name and int age and
00:46 - we've seen in previous tutorials how to
00:48 - create get methods so I'm gonna give it
00:52 - a get name which returns the name and
00:55 - I'm gonna give it a get age which
00:59 - returns the age like this
01:06 - and your notice I've declared these
01:08 - public and we've not gone into I
01:10 - explicitly yet but basically you type
01:12 - public in front of your methods you
01:15 - won't go wrong so just stick that public
01:18 - keyword in there and I'm gonna create a
01:22 - frog object now so I'll say I'll create
01:24 - a variable called frog one and I'll set
01:26 - it equal to a new frog so I've got my
01:28 - frog object and previously what I've
01:32 - been doing is this I've been saying frog
01:35 - one name he calls it's calling Bertie
01:37 - and frog one age equals one let's say
01:42 - and then later on I can access this data
01:46 - using the get method so I could say frog
01:48 - one name like that and if I run that
01:53 - it's gonna say Bertie
01:57 - so now the idea is that to try to hide
02:00 - away these variables from outside the
02:04 - class so here we're using the Frog class
02:07 - but we're accessing the variables
02:09 - directly and that means that if you use
02:11 - this class you have to know what
02:13 - internal variables it's got and that's
02:16 - undesirable it does complicate things in
02:19 - more complex situations than this so
02:22 - what we want this like we've got some
02:25 - get methods we want to have set methods
02:27 - that allow you to set that data and then
02:30 - all you have to know is what methods
02:31 - frog classes you don't have to worry
02:34 - about its internal variables so let's
02:38 - create a method here that as it doesn't
02:43 - return anything and it's called set name
02:45 - and it accepts one parameter of type
02:47 - string which I'll call new name and what
02:50 - I'll do with this method is I'll simply
02:52 - set the instance variable name equal to
02:54 - new name and that's a setter that's what
02:57 - a setter is because now instead of
02:59 - saying frog one dot name equals Bertie
03:01 - unsafe frog one set name and pass it the
03:05 - value Bertie
03:06 - like that and I've done here the same
03:08 - thing as this
03:10 - and it's really important though not to
03:12 - confuse these two because of course here
03:14 - I'm setting an instance variable with
03:16 - the equals sign whereas here I'm calling
03:20 - a method so here I'm actually making
03:25 - some code run but it just so happens
03:27 - that what all the code does is to take
03:30 - the parameter that I pass it and assign
03:33 - it to the instance variable name and
03:35 - that's what's called set name of course
03:36 - and I could also define a set age so
03:40 - public for you to set age and age and I
03:45 - can say I just I'll call it new age
03:47 - because otherwise I'll have to ages new
03:49 - age I could call it like so age equals
03:54 - new age these are just arbitrary choices
03:56 - and names I could call it the age or you
03:58 - know her age or you know other name
04:02 - whatever I like I just decided to call a
04:04 - new name new age and I can use that down
04:08 - here so I'm safe frog one frog one set
04:12 - age set it to one so now I've avoided
04:16 - referring to that for instance variables
04:19 - in my in another class you know it might
04:22 - not class here and instead I'm just
04:25 - working with frog using its methods set
04:28 - is set methods and it's get methods and
04:30 - I could use any other methods that it
04:31 - happens to have so i've encapsulated the
04:35 - data this is called encapsulation
04:36 - because you're hiding away the kind of
04:39 - instance data here and to enforce that
04:41 - if you want to stop because of the
04:43 - moment I could still type that if I
04:45 - wanted to I can't still access the
04:46 - variables directly if I just put the
04:49 - keyword private in front of them like
04:50 - this and you'll see the arrows coming up
04:54 - so now I can no longer access them
04:55 - directly outside of the class but inside
04:58 - the class is no problem and that's what
05:00 - private does
05:02 - so you could always bond private in in
05:06 - to enforce encapsulation to hide these
05:09 - variables away and one more thing I want
05:13 - to show you here maybe a couple more
05:15 - things actually well see here I've given
05:20 - the parameter a different name to the
05:22 - instance variable because I didn't want
05:23 - to have two names in the same scope so
05:27 - if I call this name now it's between
05:30 - these curly brackets in other words in
05:32 - this scope to use the technical language
05:35 - I've got two names there's there I could
05:38 - access this the instance name and
05:41 - there's this a local variable name and
05:44 - if you just use like name like that if I
05:47 - just use that without any kind of prefix
05:50 - or anything it means the one that's the
05:52 - closest to it basically which is this
05:54 - one so local variables or parameters
05:57 - they they mask the kind of instance
06:00 - variables if they have the same name but
06:04 - if I want to actually refer to the
06:06 - instance variable it's very simple I
06:08 - just prefix it with this dot this dot
06:11 - name means this name up here it means
06:14 - the instance variable the one that
06:16 - belongs to the the object or the class
06:18 - if you like and if I just use name by
06:22 - itself right here name by itself means
06:26 - they're the kind of local variable or
06:28 - the argument or parameter is this in
06:30 - this case so by saying this store name
06:34 - equals name I'm setting this name which
06:37 - is up here equal to name which is here
06:41 - so it's actually pretty simple really
06:44 - if use name by itself it means the means
06:48 - this one and this dot name means the
06:50 - instance variable that's pretty simple
06:52 - and I could do the same with a each here
06:55 - I could change this to age and then to
06:58 - disambiguate because you can't you
07:01 - obviously can't have a equals age that
07:03 - would just be selling this variable
07:04 - equal to itself so I need to say this
07:06 - that age equals
07:08 - and if you wonder what this is this is
07:12 - doesn't really matter at this stage to
07:15 - be honest but what it is is just a kind
07:19 - of reference to the object that you're
07:20 - in so here I've got frog Juan this
07:23 - refers to a particular frog particular
07:25 - object and I'm calling methods using
07:27 - frog juan and within the actual object
07:30 - itself you can use this to refer to the
07:33 - same thing this refers to the object
07:34 - itself so it's basically the same as
07:38 - frog Juan or if I had frog - it'll be
07:41 - the same as frog - whenever this ran
07:45 - within the context of the Frog - object
07:48 - but don't worry about that the really
07:50 - important thing is to get used to this
07:51 - pattern because this is a really
07:53 - important pattern for setters set
07:55 - methods you have like typically public
07:58 - void set something and then a type and
08:01 - then something and then inside the
08:05 - method you say this something equals
08:08 - something and just type that out a few
08:10 - times with different parameters and also
08:12 - gradually sink in your head and you'll
08:13 - get used to just typing out you know
08:15 - public void set age brackets int age
08:18 - this by 8 equals age there just kind of
08:20 - rattles off your tongue and you don't
08:23 - have to worry about it now beginners
08:25 - often make the mistake of using this all
08:28 - over the place I think even on some
08:30 - university courses they tell you to do
08:32 - that but it's not necessary if I had for
08:34 - example a public void set info and that
08:41 - took like a name and age like this if I
08:47 - wanted to I mean I've got the option
08:49 - here I could call obviously I can work
08:52 - with name and age directly or I could
08:54 - also do set name name and set page age
08:59 - like that so what I want to point out is
09:02 - that here you see well actually here I'm
09:08 - accessing the name instance variable
09:11 - directly I don't need this prefix
09:12 - because there's no ambiguity within this
09:14 - go
09:14 - between these two brackets there's no
09:17 - parameter here within these two brackets
09:19 - the only visible variable is this name
09:23 - here because variables are limited to
09:26 - the brackets that they're declared kind
09:29 - of in or these parameters are limited to
09:32 - the scope of the brackets just after
09:34 - them curly brackets here so between
09:37 - these two there is only one name and
09:40 - that's this instance variable here and
09:41 - scope of this it's these two brackets
09:44 - here the class ones so bottom line here
09:50 - you don't need any kind of this because
09:52 - there's only one name and it's this one
09:54 - and similarly when you call methods from
09:57 - within other methods this is a method
09:59 - under calling another method set name
10:01 - you don't need to say this stop you can
10:04 - if you want like that but it's
10:05 - completely superfluous you don't need it
10:07 - and you only need this pretty much 99%
10:11 - of the time it's only called for when
10:14 - you've got ambiguity like that you've
10:16 - got two variables for the same name in
10:17 - the same scope and once an instance
10:19 - variable and you want it pick out the
10:21 - instance variable so that's enough for
10:24 - this tutorial I think and in the next
10:26 - tutorial we will look at and
10:28 - constructors so join me again for that
10:30 - one and if you're watching on YouTube
10:32 - too clip click the subscribe button and
10:35 - you can find this code on cave of
10:38 - Programming TOCOM which is all one word
10:40 - so i'll catch you next time and until
10:46 - [Music]
10:56 - you
