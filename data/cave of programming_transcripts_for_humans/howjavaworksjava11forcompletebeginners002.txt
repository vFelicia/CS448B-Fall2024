00:00 - hello in this video we're going to talk
00:03 - a little bit about how Java works and
00:06 - once again don't stress there's no need
00:09 - to really memorize this but you'll you
00:12 - will gradually become familiar with
00:13 - these ideas I think as you continue to
00:15 - use Java so I've already said that Java
00:19 - is a compiled programming language we
00:22 - take text files written in the Java
00:24 - language we turn them into binary files
00:27 - and that's called compilation we combine
00:30 - them together if there's multiple files
00:32 - this is called building and then we run
00:36 - them on a computer as a computer program
00:39 - but actually it's a little bit even more
00:43 - interesting than that because Java does
00:46 - something rather interesting that many
00:49 - programming languages don't exactly do
00:51 - and that is this is thing called the
00:55 - Java runtime environment or JRE and what
00:59 - this does this is it's some software
01:01 - that creates effectively kind of like a
01:04 - simulated computer on your computer and
01:07 - your Java program runs on that simulated
01:11 - computer now I'm simplifying a bit
01:14 - various optimizations mean that Java
01:17 - doesn't precisely run like that bits of
01:21 - Java code run kind of almost directly on
01:25 - your computer but basically to simplify
01:30 - a bit it's as though your Java programs
01:33 - are running on a simulated virtual
01:37 - computer which runs on your computer and
01:39 - that simulated computer is created by
01:42 - the JRE the Java runtime environment
01:45 - now the advantage of this is that Java
01:47 - is a compiled once run anywhere
01:50 - programming language so with some
01:53 - computer languages like C++ you compile
01:57 - your your source code the code that
02:00 - you've actually written and then it will
02:03 - only run on one particular type of
02:05 - computer if you want to run it on a
02:07 - different type of computer you have to
02:09 - recompile it and maybe you even have to
02:12 - change it a bit
02:13 - to run on a different type of computer
02:15 - the idea behind Java is that you compile
02:18 - it once and that will run on any kind of
02:21 - computer that's running a java runtime
02:23 - environment so the java runtime
02:25 - environment gives the java program a
02:28 - kind of consistent environment to run in
02:31 - regardless at the underlying type of
02:33 - computer this is a very clever idea so
02:37 - if you want to run a java computer a
02:39 - java program on your computer then you
02:42 - need to have a JRE installed we will
02:46 - need to specifically install this
02:48 - because later on we're going to install
02:50 - a Java development kit the Java
02:53 - development kit includes a JRE a Java
02:56 - runtime environment so you can run
02:58 - programs once it's once this is
03:00 - installed but also if it allows you to
03:03 - develop Java programs yourself and all
03:06 - of these things are free completely free
03:09 - so we're going to move on to be to
03:13 - install a Java development kit among
03:15 - other things because we'll also need
03:18 - something to write our java code in okay
03:21 - that's it for this video until next time
03:24 - happy coding
