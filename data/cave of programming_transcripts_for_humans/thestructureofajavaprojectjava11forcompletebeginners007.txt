00:01 - hello in this and a next video I'm just
00:04 - going to talk a little bit about what
00:06 - we've actually created and I'm not going
00:09 - to be able to explain all of it at the
00:11 - moment because there's just too much
00:13 - going on here for you to understand at
00:16 - this stage in the course you will
00:17 - understand it later on but for now I
00:20 - just want to talk a little bit just to
00:22 - familiarize just just to sort of
00:24 - familiarize you a little bit with what's
00:26 - going on here so you'll feel hopefully a
00:28 - little bit less confused and if you've
00:30 - actually created your own program here
00:33 - and you've run it and it says hello
00:35 - world or whatever then that's really a
00:37 - great achievement so you should be proud
00:40 - of that that's a fantastic start ok so
00:44 - let's take a look at what eclipse is
00:46 - generated in this video so if you click
00:52 - your project and you you right-click it
00:57 - so I should say
00:59 - click click the project name in the
01:01 - package Explorer here and then right
01:04 - click it and go to properties and if on
01:10 - this dialog if you've got resource
01:12 - selected on the top left here then where
01:15 - it says location that will show you
01:18 - where your project is located and of
01:20 - course it's located in whatever folder
01:23 - you set the workspace to be so actually
01:29 - let's take a look at that on the disk so
01:31 - we'll go to it and my workspace folder
01:35 - is this I called it workspace and you
01:37 - don't have to but I did
01:39 - and in though we've got a folder for the
01:41 - project and it's called hello world
01:43 - it's named after a project we click on
01:46 - that and in there we've got a bin and a
01:48 - source folder now you don't have to have
01:51 - these folders in the Java project so if
01:53 - you have decided for some reason to
01:56 - follow this using for example visual
01:58 - studio code and you're you've looked up
02:01 - how to compile and run Java programs on
02:04 - the command line
02:05 - then maybe you haven't created these it
02:07 - is good practice to create them bin and
02:10 - source but they're not a part of the
02:13 - java language that more like a sort of
02:15 - traditional standard in Java the bin
02:19 - folder is were Eclipse puts your
02:22 - compiled programs so when you take text
02:25 - files that contain text written in a
02:29 - programming language and you turn them
02:31 - into a program some software does that
02:34 - and the software is in your Java
02:37 - development kit that process of turning
02:40 - text files into an actual runnable
02:42 - program that your computer understands
02:45 - is called building the program or
02:49 - compiling the program these these are
02:51 - technically different but for the moment
02:54 - we'll just talk about compiling the
02:57 - program so you're taking text files
02:59 - turning them into an actual computer
03:01 - program and that stuff gets put in the
03:04 - bin folder and you can look at it if you
03:05 - want and you'll see an app dot class
03:08 - file in there that's what's actually
03:10 - being run when you run your program now
03:15 - in the source folder here that's where
03:19 - we put our source code the source code
03:21 - is the stuff that we're writing and in
03:24 - there there's a folder called hello
03:26 - the reason I've got a folder called
03:27 - hello is because I called my package
03:32 - hello when I created this app dot Java
03:35 - class which is what this is this app dot
03:39 - Java is a class I put it in a package
03:42 - called hello so there's a folder called
03:45 - hello don't worry about these terms at
03:47 - the moment I'm just beginning to use
03:50 - them so you get a feeling of familiarity
03:52 - with them but you don't need to know
03:53 - exactly what they are at the moment is
03:55 - ok so if we go into the hello folder
03:58 - there's my app dot Java text file that's
04:01 - what we've actually written and that's
04:03 - this text file here ok so what we've got
04:09 - is we've got a project located in the
04:11 - workspace the project has one package in
04:15 - it called hello so that that's in its
04:17 - own folder and inside that folder is a
04:21 - text file at Java and a text file
04:25 - Java code in it that defines a class and
04:29 - that that at Java gets turned into a
04:35 - class file which is located in our bin
04:40 - folder so it's worth having a look at
04:42 - that in Windows Explorer or Mac finder
04:45 - or whatever you're using your file
04:46 - explorer just have a look at this just
04:49 - to feel a bit more familiar with it in
04:51 - the next video we'll talk a little bit
04:53 - about the code that we've actually
04:54 - written and all of this stuff I'm just
04:58 - giving you a very rough overview you
05:00 - don't have to really understand what I'm
05:02 - saying in any depth I'm just beginning
05:04 - to familiarize you with it
05:05 - but we will be going over a lot more in
05:07 - the rest of the course okay so until
05:10 - next time happy coding
