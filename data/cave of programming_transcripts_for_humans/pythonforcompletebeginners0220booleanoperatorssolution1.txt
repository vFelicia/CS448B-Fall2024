00:00 - in this video we're going to look at the
00:02 - first of two possible solutions and
00:04 - there are others actually to this
00:06 - exercise now this is quite a difficult
00:08 - exercise if you haven't done anything
00:11 - like this before but what I would say is
00:14 - that firstly if you try to do it that's
00:18 - really the practice that you need the
00:20 - object is not necessarily to be able to
00:23 - do this at this stage the object is that
00:26 - you should practice and try to figure
00:29 - out how to do these kinds of things it
00:31 - is that trying that will cause you to
00:34 - gradually make progress whether you
00:36 - actually get the answer in the end or
00:37 - not secondly if you've tried to do this
00:40 - exercise and you couldn't manage to do
00:42 - it correctly you might feel at some
00:44 - point during this video that you've now
00:47 - got enough knowledge that you could
00:49 - actually do it maybe that won't even
00:50 - happen till the end of the video and
00:53 - it's a good idea then to pause the video
00:55 - at that point and have another go at it
00:58 - so first of all we've got to ask the
01:00 - user if they're a student if they have
01:02 - pets and if they
01:04 - smoke so let's do that here so let's
01:08 - call this
01:09 - student and say that's equal to input
01:13 - are you a student question mark and
01:17 - let's put y/n as a hint and we'll have a
01:20 - little sort
01:22 - of character here let's use a colon for
01:25 - a prompt
01:27 - symbol I'm going to duplicate this
01:32 - and we want one for
01:34 - pets and we want one
01:37 - for smoking so let's say
01:42 - here do you have
01:45 - pets
01:46 - [Music]
01:47 - and do you
01:50 - smoke so now when we get these answers
01:53 - back they're not going to be Boolean
01:55 - variables we need to convert whatever
01:57 - the user types to a Boolean Ian variable
02:01 - so let's create some Boolean variables
02:03 - let's say is student equals the
02:08 - answer equal
02:11 - to Y so if they enter
02:15 - y then this will evaluate to true and we
02:18 - assign that value to is
02:20 - student we could also use the same
02:22 - variable again we could put student here
02:27 - and there's nothing wrong with using the
02:29 - VAR aable to get some value and then
02:32 - assigning that value back to the same
02:35 - variable converting student itself into
02:38 - a Boolean value but for clarity here
02:41 - I'll just use a different
02:42 - variable now we need to do that for the
02:45 - others so let's say here has
02:49 - pets and does smoke and now here we need
02:55 - pets and here we need smokes now I
02:58 - always recommend
03:01 - if you're a a beginner especially but I
03:03 - also do this to an extent as a
03:05 - professional or at least I was a
03:07 - professional developer in the past these
03:10 - days I largely make videos but I always
03:13 - recommend that you develop a bit of the
03:16 - program and then test it out by printing
03:18 - the values of variables because
03:21 - otherwise if you just write a whole
03:23 - program and run it and it doesn't work
03:25 - that's quite an unpleasant experience
03:27 - and it can sometimes be hard to figure
03:29 - out where the problem is it's much
03:31 - better to develop it bit by bit as you
03:33 - go along so let's print is
03:37 - student and we'll print these others as
03:40 - well so has pets and does
03:45 - smoke let's try it so we'll run the
03:51 - program are you a student let's say yes
03:54 - do you have pets I'll say no do you
03:56 - smoke let's say no so we've got true
03:59 - false false so that seems to be correct
04:01 - so far now the tricky bit is so one way
04:06 - we can approach this exercise is by
04:09 - combining all these into a single
04:12 - Boolean
04:13 - value and then we can print the answer
04:15 - as to whether or not they're allowed to
04:17 - rent this
04:19 - property and there are multiple ways to
04:21 - do this even using this particular
04:24 - approach combining
04:26 - booleans so I'll try to pick something
04:29 - that's comparatively easy so first let's
04:33 - take the case where they are a student
04:37 - let's create a variable student can rent
04:43 - equals now how could we set this to true
04:46 - or false using the information that
04:49 - we've
04:50 - got well we want to ask if there a
04:52 - student so is student and then we want
04:55 - to say and some other conditions are
04:57 - also true so for this person to be a
05:01 - student who is allowed to rent this
05:03 - property well that has to be true and
05:06 - some other conditions have to be true
05:09 - what are the conditions if you're a
05:10 - student you can only rent the property
05:12 - if you don't have pets and you don't
05:15 - smoke so let's say here and not has pets
05:23 - and not does smoke so I think that word
05:30 - decide whether they can rent or not and
05:33 - are a student so let's say print student
05:37 - can rent Let's test this out so I run
05:40 - this are you a student that should be
05:44 - are you a student are you a
05:47 - student okay so I'm going to say yes I
05:49 - am a
05:50 - student and do I have pets yes do I
05:53 - smoke no can't rent it
05:57 - sorry okay so are you a student yes do
06:01 - you smoke wait do you have
06:05 - pets let's say no do you smoke yes still
06:10 - can't rent it are you a student yes do
06:14 - you have pets no do you smoke no true
06:18 - you can rent it and if I say I'm not a
06:21 - student shouldn't really matter what I
06:23 - type after that it's going to come back
06:26 - false because they're not a student that
06:29 - is allowed to rent the place because
06:31 - they're not a
06:32 - student let's tackle the other case
06:35 - where they are not a
06:37 - student so non student can rent
06:45 - equals not is student so they're not a
06:49 - student okay so if you're not a student
06:52 - you're allowed to rent this property if
06:54 - you smoke or you have pets but not
06:58 - both so let's say not is student and
07:03 - not does smoke and has pets so this will
07:10 - only be true if both of these things are
07:13 - true and then we turn that to fults for
07:16 - a
07:17 - not so we're
07:20 - saying there a non- student who who is
07:22 - allowed to rent this property only if
07:25 - they're not a student to start with and
07:28 - it's not true
07:30 - that they both smoke and have pets as
07:33 - well so let's say
07:35 - print non- student can rent so now let's
07:39 - run this and try it out and see if this
07:41 - bit works the second bit so if I say I
07:46 - am not a student let's say I am a
07:48 - student to start with I am a student and
07:51 - I don't have pets and I don't smoke
07:53 - second bit should be false because this
07:55 - is only for non- students let's try it
07:58 - again and say say I'm not a
08:00 - student do you have pets yes do you
08:04 - smoke no true I'm allowed to rent are
08:08 - you a student
08:10 - no do you have pets no do you smoke
08:14 - yes then I'm allowed to rent but if I
08:17 - say I'm a non- student not a
08:21 - student and I have pets and I also smoke
08:25 - I'm not allowed to rent so I think the
08:27 - second bit works and now we can combine
08:30 - them into a single variable let's say
08:32 - can rent equals student can rent or non-
08:36 - student can rent so if either of those
08:38 - are true then we're fine now let's print
08:41 - this out so print can
08:46 - rent and if I run this okay actually I'm
08:52 - going to get rid of these CU we don't
08:53 - need these
08:55 - anymore okay let's try
08:58 - this so are you a student let's say I am
09:02 - and I don't have pets or smoke then I
09:05 - can rent be nice if I got some text here
09:09 - actually can rent
09:12 - colon and let's just convert this to a
09:17 - string okay let's run
09:20 - this so are you a student yes and I
09:24 - don't have pets and I don't smoke I can
09:26 - rent but if I say I am a student
09:29 - and I have
09:32 - pets but don't smoke can't rent if I'm a
09:38 - student I don't have pets but I
09:41 - smoke can't rent what about if I'm a non
09:45 - student and I have pets and I smoke I
09:49 - can't rent what about if I'm a non-
09:53 - student and I have pets but I don't
09:56 - smoke I can
09:57 - rent and if I'm a non student I don't
10:02 - have any pets I do smoke I can also
10:08 - rent I think this works pretty
10:13 - well seems to be okay if I type see here
10:17 - I type y y by mistake that's going to
10:19 - end up being considered false because of
10:23 - the way I've done this
10:24 - comparison let's just try that again so
10:28 - I want to put in here that I'm not a
10:32 - student I do have pets and I do
10:34 - smoke not a student I have pets and I
10:39 - smoke can't rent I think this
10:43 - works this is complicated right it's
10:46 - pretty complicated I don't think most
10:49 - programming is even as complicated as
10:51 - this to be honest and this isn't the
10:54 - only way to do this so I could have set
10:57 - can rent in a single line by combining
11:00 - all of these conditions together without
11:02 - using these intermediate student can
11:04 - rent and non-student can rent variables
11:07 - and there are other ways of doing it I
11:08 - could have broken it down further I
11:10 - could have maybe combined this into a
11:12 - single variable and so
11:15 - on so hopefully you see the general idea
11:19 - of this approach you've got an idea of
11:21 - how this approach works so if you
11:24 - haven't already written this program I
11:26 - would suggest having another go it now
11:29 - you've seen how I approached it if you
11:32 - find yourself just tearing your hair out
11:34 - eventually and you get sick of it and
11:37 - just leave it you might come back to it
11:40 - later on even in six months or something
11:42 - after more
11:44 - practice but it it's definitely worth
11:46 - having a serious go at trying to do this
11:49 - because you'll learn a lot about Boolean
11:51 - variables and how to think in a Boolean
11:55 - logic type of a way but at the end of
11:57 - the day if it's just too frustrating
11:59 - don't sweat it the important thing is to
12:02 - just spend some time practicing whether
12:04 - you get the answer in the end or not
12:08 - eventually you'll be able to write
12:10 - programs that work but that can take
12:12 - some practice so while that's always the
12:16 - aim at this stage if you can't do that I
12:19 - wouldn't beat yourself up about it just
12:23 - practice and your skills will gradually
12:27 - improve hello you've been watching a
12:30 - free sample from my Python and machine
12:33 - learning for complete beginners course
12:35 - I'm uploading enough videos from the
12:37 - start of the course to get you started

12:41 - full course is absolutely massive if
12:43 - you're interested in it please click the
12:46 - link in the description the complete
12:48 - course covers not only basic python but
12:51 - also some fairly Advanced python even
12:53 - some desktop programming stuff and then
12:56 - goes on to machine learning and artif
12:58 - IAL intelligence until next time happy
