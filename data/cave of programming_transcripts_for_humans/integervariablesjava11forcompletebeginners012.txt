00:01 - hello in this video we're going to start
00:03 - looking at variables and variables are
00:07 - one of the most important basic building
00:10 - blocks of computer programs so we'll get
00:13 - started with them here I've created a
00:15 - project called integer variables I've
00:17 - given it a a class called app which has
00:21 - a main method and I put one statement in
00:24 - there it just says hello so you should
00:27 - try that yourself and check it you can
00:29 - run it and then let's add some more code
00:33 - to this so what I'm going to do is I'm
00:35 - going to actually click after the
00:38 - opening bracket here and hit return a
00:41 - couple of times just so that I can get a
00:43 - couple of blank lines above this
00:45 - statement and after the opening curly
00:49 - bracket and here I'm going to type well
00:52 - we need a name for our variable and we
00:55 - need to think about what it's actually
00:57 - going to refer to a variable is it's
01:01 - kind of a way of referring to some sort
01:05 - of value or some sort of entity that can
01:08 - change as your program progresses and
01:11 - that's why it's called a variable
01:12 - because it varies let's imagine that you
01:16 - keep cats and you've got some quantity
01:20 - of cats in your house so what we want is
01:25 - a variable that can hold the number of
01:27 - cats we've currently got maybe maybe
01:31 - sometimes your friend takes some of them
01:33 - or you know you you require more cuts so
01:37 - the number of cats that you've got can
01:39 - change okay so I'm gonna write here int
01:43 - and in a space and in cats and then a
01:46 - semicolon so what's going on here well
01:53 - first of all let's deal with this yellow
01:55 - warning so you see this yellow
01:57 - underlining here and in the margin
02:01 - there's a little yellow icon it's like a
02:04 - light bulb with a exclamation mark in
02:06 - this version of Eclipse if I hover over
02:08 - it it says the value of the local
02:10 - variable cats is not used
02:13 - what it's telling me is that I've
02:14 - created a variable a thing called a
02:17 - variable and I'm not using it and that's
02:20 - true
02:21 - so warnings are things that you might
02:24 - want to pay attention to in your program
02:26 - you don't really want to have any
02:29 - warnings in your program when you run it
02:31 - but unlike an error a warning won't stop
02:34 - your program actually running so I can
02:36 - actually run this program still it does
02:39 - actually run so if you see a red icon
02:44 - here all this red underlining that's an
02:47 - error and an error is a problem it will
02:50 - stop your program compiling you won't be
02:53 - able to run it but this is just a
02:54 - warning so he can run it okay now what
02:59 - have we done here well this is a
03:00 - statement finishes in semicolon and
03:02 - we've essentially said that it's a bit
03:06 - like creating a sort of bucket in this
03:08 - case it's a bucket big enough to hold
03:13 - numbers and it's the right type of
03:16 - bucket for holding numbers if you wanted
03:19 - to hold text or something we'd need
03:21 - something different so int is we call it
03:27 - the type of the variable and int is a
03:30 - primitive data type we call it in Java
03:33 - and cats is just a name I've made up to
03:37 - it's like sticking a label on a bucket
03:39 - and writing caps on it so we've got our
03:43 - bucket which can hold numbers because
03:45 - we've used the keyword int and we've
03:48 - stuck a label on that bucket called and
03:50 - written cuts on it int is short for
03:53 - integer and integers integer just means
03:56 - a whole number it can be positive or
03:58 - negative but it's a number so we can
04:02 - assign a value to that let's do this so
04:04 - I'm going to go to maybe the next line
04:06 - and write cats equals seven semicolon
04:12 - what have we done now well we've taken a
04:16 - number seven and we've stored it in this
04:19 - variable or we we say that we've
04:21 - assigned the value seven to this
04:24 - variable and it's like taking the number
04:26 - seven
04:27 - putting it in our bucket this is going
04:30 - to sing confusing at first but after you
04:32 - after you practiced it a bit it won't be
04:33 - and finally let's output this value so
04:37 - I've got a system dot out dot print line
04:40 - here and I'm gonna get rid of this text
04:44 - so get rid of the stuff in the speech
04:46 - marks so it looks like this and then
04:50 - between these round brackets I'm going
04:52 - to type cats
04:54 - so we're saying display the value of
04:57 - this variable
04:58 - let's click run and then it says there
05:03 - in the console it says seven so just to
05:07 - go through that again quickly we wanted
05:10 - a variable that can refer to a number
05:12 - and we've written int that's short for
05:16 - integer because we want to create some
05:20 - space in the computer's memory
05:21 - essentially that can hold a number and
05:24 - this this process here we call it
05:26 - declaring a variable and really it's
05:30 - like creating a bucket of the right size
05:33 - and type to hold a number and then
05:35 - sticking a label on it and writing caps
05:37 - on that label here we've assigned the
05:40 - value to the variable and that's a bit
05:42 - like taking the number seven and putting
05:44 - it in this bucket so we say that we've
05:47 - assigned I've assigned a value to the
05:50 - variable cats and it's we that value is
05:54 - 7 that we've assigned and then finally
05:57 - we printed the value so that comes out
06:00 - on a console try this for yourself and
06:04 - the order matters you've got to have
06:06 - these in a right order and check that
06:09 - you can get this to work and then we'll
06:10 - see what we can do with variables so
06:13 - until next time happy coding
