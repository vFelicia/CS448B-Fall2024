00:00 - hello in this video we're going to talk
00:03 - a little bit about the code that we've
00:05 - actually created now there are a lot of
00:09 - concepts packed into this short piece of
00:12 - code it's very cryptic looking even
00:15 - though it's a basic sort of what we call
00:17 - a hello world type of program you won't
00:21 - understand all of these concepts until
00:24 - you've gone through more of the course
00:26 - so what I want to do here is just run
00:29 - through it quickly so you have a vague
00:31 - idea about it just to try to make you
00:33 - feel a little bit less confused it's not
00:36 - important to remember or memorize what
00:39 - I'm saying here because my entire object
00:42 - is is really not to teach you stuff at
00:44 - this point but to reduce the confusion
00:47 - more like okay so let's just talk about
00:50 - this a little bit so Java code is
00:54 - organized into packages we we create
00:58 - text files with the extension Java and
01:01 - we group them together in what we call
01:03 - packages we created one package called
01:06 - hello and that's why the this app dot
01:10 - Java file starts with the statement
01:12 - package hello it finishes in a semicolon
01:16 - and that's very important many
01:19 - programming languages use a semicolon to
01:22 - end a statement and a statement is kind
01:26 - of it's like a sentence in English it's
01:29 - a little bit of computer code that does
01:30 - one particular thing and it ends in a
01:33 - semicolon following that we've got a
01:37 - definition of a class a class is like
01:41 - the basic unit of Java code you can have
01:43 - multiple classes in one text file but
01:47 - usually most of the time you create one
01:50 - class per text file in Java and usually
01:54 - the class has to have the same name as
01:58 - the file that it's in so that's why
02:00 - we've got a class here called
02:01 - app and it's in a file called app Java
02:05 - capitalization is also very important
02:07 - class has to have an uppercase first
02:10 - letter and so does the text file
02:12 - that it's in you can't have spaces or
02:15 - weird punctuation in it or anything like
02:17 - that so we've got a class here and curly
02:21 - brackets define what we call the scope
02:24 - of the class they define the contents of
02:27 - the class within the class we've got a
02:29 - single subroutine that's a block of code
02:32 - that contains a bunch of statements that
02:35 - actually accomplish something now this
02:39 - is a subroutine called main and in Java
02:43 - subroutines sort of collections of lines
02:47 - of code are called methods so what we
02:50 - here what we have here is a main method
02:54 - and the main method is where your Java
02:59 - program starts is where it starts
03:01 - running from this this has string array
03:06 - hogs we'll be looking at all of this
03:08 - stuff later so don't worry about it at
03:10 - the moment but this would allow us to
03:12 - pass in information from the command
03:15 - line if we are running this program on
03:17 - the command line it's a collection of
03:20 - bits of text essentially but it doesn't
03:22 - matter for the moment so we've got this
03:25 - main method this main subroutine and the
03:29 - scope of diced again defined by two
03:30 - curly brackets so it's a method called
03:34 - main and then we've got some content of
03:36 - it that goes between two curly brackets
03:39 - and all of that is nested inside this
03:41 - class definition and what is the actual
03:45 - content of our main method here well
03:48 - it's one single statement and this has
03:51 - system dot out dot print line print in
03:57 - programming terminology means to display
04:00 - on the console so when we talk about
04:03 - printing texts and we don't mean we
04:06 - don't mean anything to do with an actual
04:07 - printer we just mean display it on the
04:10 - console print it so we printed hello
04:13 - world on the console down here so if you
04:17 - can see that down here there we go now
04:21 - we printed that text
04:23 - the text that we wanted to print is
04:26 - enclosed in double quotes here so this
04:29 - is just normal ordinary human readable
04:32 - text the well the only the only one the
04:35 - only unusual thing about it is that
04:37 - there are some things you can't put in
04:39 - there because they have a special
04:40 - meaning in Java so for a moment just
04:43 - stick to ordinary text but you can have
04:44 - spaces and things in because between
04:47 - these double quotes it's just ordinary
04:49 - text and that because this is a
04:53 - statement this bit here it finishes with
04:55 - a semicolon a system dot out dot print
04:58 - line println it says yeah it's a
05:03 - mouthful and we'll look at you'll
05:06 - understand more about what that is later
05:08 - on but just understand for a moment that
05:12 - this is how we display text on the
05:14 - console in a Java program that's all it
05:17 - is this actual text is called an
05:23 - argument to this method print print line
05:27 - so that's that's some terminology for
05:30 - you and it's a maybe it gives you a very
05:32 - vague idea about what this program does
05:34 - or maybe not maybe you just feel even
05:37 - more confused than to start with either
05:39 - way that's okay that's all right what
05:42 - we're going to be doing in the next few
05:44 - videos and for quite a while probably is
05:47 - just adding more text here we're going
05:49 - to add more lines in so that we can do
05:52 - more stuff and we're going to look at
05:54 - the real basics the real fundamentals
05:56 - there are nuts and bolts of computer
05:58 - programming and we're going to gradually
06:00 - build up your skill level and hopefully
06:02 - you'll gradually feel less confused it
06:05 - is really important to type this out
06:06 - though you have to type stuff because
06:09 - just watching the video won't be enough
06:11 - okay so until next time happy coding
