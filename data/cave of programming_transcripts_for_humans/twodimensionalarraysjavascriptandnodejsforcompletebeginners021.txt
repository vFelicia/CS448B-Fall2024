00:00 - hello this is John from cave of
00:03 - programming comm and this video is on
00:06 - two-dimensional arrays continuing my
00:09 - course on nodejs and JavaScript for
00:13 - beginners so a two-dimensional array is
00:17 - like a table we've already seen
00:19 - one-dimensional arrays that's like a
00:22 - list of things but we can create
00:24 - multi-dimensional arrays and of those 2d
00:29 - arrays are by far the most common so we
00:31 - write here you strict as usual and let's
00:35 - create a 2d array a 2d array is
00:39 - basically a normal array a
00:42 - one-dimensional array like the one we've
00:44 - already seen it's going to clear this
00:46 - console except that in a 2d array each
00:52 - of the elements in the array are
00:54 - themselves arrays so I'll create a
00:57 - variable let's call it animal table and
01:01 - I'm going to set it equal to some
01:04 - animals it's going to be a 2d array of
01:07 - animals so to initialize it with values
01:11 - here I'm going to create an array but
01:16 - the thing is now let's create some blank
01:18 - space here I'm going to create I'm going
01:22 - to the elements that I'm going to put in
01:25 - this array are themselves going to be
01:27 - arrays so this is this is very much like
01:30 - a table so for the first row we have
01:33 - square brackets to denote another array
01:36 - and in there I'm going to put dog and
01:40 - cat and then let's have another row in
01:44 - here let's have some exotic animals on
01:47 - the second row so let's have exotic I
01:51 - mean for someone like me who comes from
01:52 - England so giraffe elephant and rhino
01:59 - maybe so what is this it's like a table
02:04 - of animals and we call it a
02:05 - two-dimensional array and you'll see why
02:07 - shortly so how do we access
02:11 - elements in this two-dimensional array
02:14 - or table well we need two subscripts to
02:18 - refer to each element and that's why
02:20 - it's called a two-dimensional array
02:22 - dimensions just refers to basically the
02:25 - number of indexes that you need to
02:30 - specify the position of an item in an
02:34 - array so let's do console.log now if I
02:41 - write animal table and we use one index
02:45 - we're going to be referring to elements
02:48 - so the elements in this outer array here
02:51 - all themselves are raised this is an
02:53 - array its element 0 element 1 here
02:56 - that's an array as well
02:57 - so if I output element 0 only let's run
03:02 - it we get dog and cat an element one
03:08 - would be giraffe element rhino but
03:15 - because so this value is an array we can
03:20 - use another and other index to get
03:23 - particular items out of this array so if
03:26 - we stick with maybe element one that's
03:29 - this thing here supposingly one elephant
03:32 - well within within this sub array this
03:37 - is element 0 this is element 1 this is
03:41 - element 2 there's help for element 1
03:44 - so let's write 1 again here and then
03:48 - we've got elephant elephant if we try to
03:54 - within that second array we've got rhino
04:01 - and by the way something that I don't
04:04 - think I mentioned in my video on 1d
04:07 - arrays is that you can set elements in
04:10 - the array after you've created it in
04:12 - fact it's common to do that we'll be
04:14 - looking at more of that later on but for
04:16 - example supposing I want to change this
04:21 - rhino element to some other animal I
04:25 - do it like this so he have animal table
04:28 - and we want to go to the that's row 0
04:32 - that's row 1 so we want row 1 so we put
04:36 - 1 in square brackets and then with in
04:38 - Row one we want element 0 1 2 so we put
04:42 - 2 in square brackets and we can set that
04:46 - with an equal sign with the assignment
04:48 - operator to something else so we could
04:52 - put in here let's say capybara hopefully
04:56 - I'm pronouncing that right one of those
04:58 - giant friendly rat like creatures now
05:01 - let's do console dot log animal table 1
05:08 - & 2 so Row 1 column 2 basically and now
05:17 - we can see that we've changed rhino to
05:19 - capybara so we declared a variable and
05:23 - we set it equal to an array so we've
05:26 - initialized the variable with a 2d array
05:28 - and we output this value here which was
05:32 - rhino at Row 1 column 2 or in other
05:37 - words it's the first teller it's the
05:41 - element 1 within this outer array so
05:43 - that's element 0 element 1 and it's the
05:47 - second
05:48 - it's element Saurus element at index 2
05:51 - within this so 0 1 2 which is rhino we
05:57 - output that and we get rhino then
06:00 - remember the interpreter is working
06:02 - downwards through our program the node
06:05 - interpreter so then we change it to copy
06:08 - para and we output the value of that and
06:11 - we get capybara so you can do this as
06:16 - well we Wandy arrays you can change the
06:18 - values within them how would we actually
06:21 - output the whole of a two-dimensional
06:25 - array well that's a little bit
06:27 - complicated at least if you're a
06:29 - beginner so I think we'll look at that
06:31 - in the next video but the thing to do
06:34 - now is practice creating 2d arrays
06:39 - and accessing elements within them so
06:42 - don't forget you can also use you can
06:46 - also get the elements out and store them
06:48 - in variables so we could write for
06:49 - example here let's animal equal like
06:55 - this just storing the value in a
06:57 - variable and then if we want to we could
07:00 - output console dot log animal so it does
07:04 - the same thing as before so if you're a
07:08 - beginner definitely you want to practice
07:09 - this practice creating two-dimensional
07:14 - arrays so you can have as many rows as
07:16 - you like and within each row you can
07:19 - have as many columns as you like some
07:22 - languages would force you to have the
07:24 - same would force you to have the same
07:27 - number of elements in each row but in
07:32 - JavaScript you can create what we call
07:34 - jagged two-dimensional arrays well the
07:37 - different rows have different lengths
07:39 - it's not a problem
07:40 - so you want to practice that with
07:42 - different numbers of rows and columns
07:44 - and check that you can get the elements
07:47 - out you can access them or dereference
07:49 - them and check you can set elements
07:53 - correctly and if you practice that for a
07:57 - little bit it will start to make sense
07:59 - to you and then I think in the next
08:02 - video we'll look at how you'd actually
08:04 - write loops that could output the whole
08:08 - content of a two-dimensional array and
08:11 - we'll look at nested loops

Cleaned transcript:

hello this is John from cave of programming comm and this video is on twodimensional arrays continuing my course on nodejs and JavaScript for beginners so a twodimensional array is like a table we've already seen onedimensional arrays that's like a list of things but we can create multidimensional arrays and of those 2d arrays are by far the most common so we write here you strict as usual and let's create a 2d array a 2d array is basically a normal array a onedimensional array like the one we've already seen it's going to clear this console except that in a 2d array each of the elements in the array are themselves arrays so I'll create a variable let's call it animal table and I'm going to set it equal to some animals it's going to be a 2d array of animals so to initialize it with values here I'm going to create an array but the thing is now let's create some blank space here I'm going to create I'm going to the elements that I'm going to put in this array are themselves going to be arrays so this is this is very much like a table so for the first row we have square brackets to denote another array and in there I'm going to put dog and cat and then let's have another row in here let's have some exotic animals on the second row so let's have exotic I mean for someone like me who comes from England so giraffe elephant and rhino maybe so what is this it's like a table of animals and we call it a twodimensional array and you'll see why shortly so how do we access elements in this twodimensional array or table well we need two subscripts to refer to each element and that's why it's called a twodimensional array dimensions just refers to basically the number of indexes that you need to specify the position of an item in an array so let's do console.log now if I write animal table and we use one index we're going to be referring to elements so the elements in this outer array here all themselves are raised this is an array its element 0 element 1 here that's an array as well so if I output element 0 only let's run it we get dog and cat an element one would be giraffe element rhino but because so this value is an array we can use another and other index to get particular items out of this array so if we stick with maybe element one that's this thing here supposingly one elephant well within within this sub array this is element 0 this is element 1 this is element 2 there's help for element 1 so let's write 1 again here and then we've got elephant elephant if we try to within that second array we've got rhino and by the way something that I don't think I mentioned in my video on 1d arrays is that you can set elements in the array after you've created it in fact it's common to do that we'll be looking at more of that later on but for example supposing I want to change this rhino element to some other animal I do it like this so he have animal table and we want to go to the that's row 0 that's row 1 so we want row 1 so we put 1 in square brackets and then with in Row one we want element 0 1 2 so we put 2 in square brackets and we can set that with an equal sign with the assignment operator to something else so we could put in here let's say capybara hopefully I'm pronouncing that right one of those giant friendly rat like creatures now let's do console dot log animal table 1 & 2 so Row 1 column 2 basically and now we can see that we've changed rhino to capybara so we declared a variable and we set it equal to an array so we've initialized the variable with a 2d array and we output this value here which was rhino at Row 1 column 2 or in other words it's the first teller it's the element 1 within this outer array so that's element 0 element 1 and it's the second it's element Saurus element at index 2 within this so 0 1 2 which is rhino we output that and we get rhino then remember the interpreter is working downwards through our program the node interpreter so then we change it to copy para and we output the value of that and we get capybara so you can do this as well we Wandy arrays you can change the values within them how would we actually output the whole of a twodimensional array well that's a little bit complicated at least if you're a beginner so I think we'll look at that in the next video but the thing to do now is practice creating 2d arrays and accessing elements within them so don't forget you can also use you can also get the elements out and store them in variables so we could write for example here let's animal equal like this just storing the value in a variable and then if we want to we could output console dot log animal so it does the same thing as before so if you're a beginner definitely you want to practice this practice creating twodimensional arrays so you can have as many rows as you like and within each row you can have as many columns as you like some languages would force you to have the same would force you to have the same number of elements in each row but in JavaScript you can create what we call jagged twodimensional arrays well the different rows have different lengths it's not a problem so you want to practice that with different numbers of rows and columns and check that you can get the elements out you can access them or dereference them and check you can set elements correctly and if you practice that for a little bit it will start to make sense to you and then I think in the next video we'll look at how you'd actually write loops that could output the whole content of a twodimensional array and we'll look at nested loops
