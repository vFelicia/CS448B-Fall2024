00:00 - hello this is John from cave of
00:03 - programming calm welcome to my my sequel
00:06 - course this is a course that takes you
00:08 - right from the absolute basics of my
00:10 - sequel all the way up to pretty advanced
00:13 - so hopefully whether you you are
00:15 - learning this from scratch and you just
00:18 - have some basic computing knowledge or
00:20 - whether you already know some my sequel
00:22 - and you want to improve your knowledge
00:24 - and maybe learn about transactions and
00:27 - store procedures and that sort of thing
00:28 - hopefully this is the course for you so
00:31 - in this introductory video I just want
00:33 - to talk a little bit about what my
00:35 - sequel actually is so my sequel it's
00:41 - technically it's a database management
00:44 - system although we often refer to it as
00:47 - just a database but really it's a
00:49 - database management system and it's is
00:51 - some software that can manage a
00:53 - collection of databases so sequel it is
00:59 - actually it actually stands for
01:01 - structured query language so structured
01:04 - query that's a very unhelpful spellcheck
01:08 - I've got a structured query language and
01:14 - sequel is the language that you use to
01:17 - issue commands to relational databases
01:20 - like my sequel so in the next video
01:24 - we're going to be look at what looking
01:25 - at what you have to download but if I
01:28 - search for my sequel downloads here and
01:31 - let's maybe check this page my sequel
01:34 - community downloads we're going to be
01:36 - installing the my sequel community
01:38 - server and we're also going to be
01:40 - installing something called the my
01:42 - sequel workbench and they're
01:44 - cross-platform
01:45 - I'm using a Mac but fine on Windows or
01:48 - Linux as well so why is it called a
01:51 - community server well a database is is
01:56 - actually a collection of tables so in a
01:59 - database you store data in tables at
02:02 - least this is true in a in a relational
02:04 - database like my sequel so my sequel is
02:08 - this database management system that
02:10 - manages a bunch of different
02:12 - bases each one you can give a name to
02:14 - and you can add tables to it and add
02:17 - data to those tables but the database
02:21 - management system needs some way of
02:23 - allowing you to communicate with it so
02:27 - what happens is it runs there's some
02:30 - software that runs continuously
02:32 - is what we call a server in fact if I
02:34 - look at my installation in my sequel I
02:36 - can see down here somewhere we've got a
02:39 - program called my sequel D and that's a
02:42 - program that's now running continuously
02:45 - on my system and it's a server which
02:49 - means that if I go to a URL let's go to
02:52 - localhost and a default URL is lo is the
02:57 - name and a machine that the server is
02:59 - running on and the port 3306
03:03 - so via this URL we can communicate with
03:06 - the database if I actually go to it we
03:09 - don't get anything useful in my cases
03:12 - seems to have downloaded something
03:13 - that's because the server's is not
03:16 - producing data in a format that my
03:19 - browser my web browser understands it's
03:23 - it's producing data and accepting data
03:26 - in a format that's understood by what we
03:29 - call clients of my sequel clients that
03:33 - connect to this server which is a
03:35 - database management system so an example
03:38 - of a my sequel Kline would be that PHP
03:42 - myadmin
03:42 - program which you you may be familiar
03:44 - with and we've also got another example
03:46 - of such a program right here
03:48 - it's the my sequel program so in here in
03:52 - my installation in my sequel is a
03:54 - program that's just called my sequel and
03:56 - that's a program that I can use on a
03:58 - command-line if I want to to connect to
04:01 - my running server my running database
04:04 - management system and I can use this
04:06 - program to issue commands to my sequel
04:09 - in a language called sequel structured
04:13 - query language now in this course we're
04:17 - going to be using a client called the my
04:19 - sequel workbench and this is a really
04:21 - nice sort of fully feature tool that as
04:24 - we'll see it also
04:25 - allows you to design databases visually
04:27 - but one thing we can do is we can just
04:30 - connect and then we can see what
04:32 - databases we've got already so I've
04:34 - already created a date a bunch of
04:36 - databases at this point and we can use
04:38 - particular databases and we can see what
04:42 - tables are in those databases don't
04:44 - worry about memorizing these commands
04:46 - because we're going to see them as we go
04:47 - through the course and I can see what I
04:51 - can see what data is in these tables and
04:55 - this command is an example of sequel
04:58 - structured query language and we'll be
05:00 - looking at that in this course so in a
05:04 - nutshell we've got this program which is
05:07 - database management system it manages
05:10 - databases which are collections of
05:11 - tables containing data and it's also a
05:14 - server and the factor is the server
05:17 - allows client programs like the my
05:19 - sequel workbench here to communicate
05:21 - with it and we can then issue commands
05:24 - using sequel structured query language
05:28 - ok so in the next video we'll look at
05:30 - what we have to install to get started
05:32 - with all this stuff my sequel is a great
05:36 - database to learn you can install it
05:38 - even on a you know a small old laptop it
05:41 - will run pretty well usually it's so
05:45 - it's relatively lightweight you can
05:47 - store like huge amounts of data in it as
05:49 - long as you've got disk space and enough
05:51 - memory to cope with all this software
05:54 - which most computers will have and
05:58 - because it's free because the Community
06:01 - Edition is free it's not restricted in
06:04 - any way and it's very powerful because
06:06 - of that probably in the majority of
06:09 - websites in the world to use my sequel
06:11 - to store their data like it's something
06:14 - like a utility company or a bank is
06:16 - going to stump up a lot of hard cash for
06:19 - probably for Oracle and also for like
06:23 - life support with Oracle so something
06:28 - that's got to be ultra secure may not
06:31 - use my sequel but then again there's no
06:33 - reason probably why it couldn't it's
06:36 - just a matter of
06:37 - maybe getting some support with I recall
06:39 - that Oracle is just the established kind
06:41 - of big database in the field but my
06:44 - sequel is used for all kinds of things
06:47 - you know all kinds of needs for online
06:50 - applications if you want to make a
06:52 - social network or you know you want to
06:55 - just have a like a WordPress website or
06:59 - something that just stores data my
07:01 - sequel is that is a really good choice
07:02 - of database very very widely used okay
07:06 - so I'll shut up and we'll get on in the
07:08 - next video to actually installing some
07:10 - software here so until next time happy
07:12 - coding
