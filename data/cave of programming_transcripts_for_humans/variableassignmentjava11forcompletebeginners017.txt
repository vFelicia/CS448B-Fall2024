00:00 - hello in this tutorial we're going to
00:04 - look at assigning values to variables so
00:08 - I've written a comment here actually and
00:10 - it's a multi-line comment so if you want
00:13 - to have one line of comments like this
00:17 - that's just text on one line the next
00:21 - line wouldn't be a comment any more and
00:23 - that starts with two slashes but you can
00:25 - also have multi-line comments with slash
00:27 - star and they end in star slash these
00:31 - stars are just decorative we don't
00:34 - actually need them they just look nice
00:35 - but that's where Clips put them in but
00:39 - this video is about assigning variables
00:41 - so if you want to have comments on
00:43 - multiple lines you can just think those
00:45 - them with slash star and finish them
00:48 - with star slash okay so let's declare
00:51 - some variables here I'm going to have
00:52 - int dogs equals 8 and int cats equals 3
00:58 - and we can output those values so we can
01:01 - say dogs is that and the number of cats
01:08 - we're going to have cats cats and if we
01:14 - run that we should see what we expect
01:16 - this check so yes it says down here dogs
01:20 - eight cats three okay now we can change
01:24 - variables as we go along so underneath
01:27 - this so underneath the system dot out
01:29 - dot print lines underneath those let's
01:33 - set the number of dogs equal to the
01:36 - number of cats so I'm going to do that
01:39 - by saying dogs equals cats and we'll
01:44 - output them again let's try this and see
01:48 - what it does so if I run this now we sit
01:55 - we see that the the number of dogs has
01:57 - been set to what the number of cats was
01:59 - set to which is three this can be very
02:02 - confusing for beginners so to start with
02:06 - we have eight stored in the variable
02:08 - dogs and we have three I should say I'll
02:11 - use the proper language I've got
02:13 - three assigned to the variable castes
02:16 - and later on we say this this is saying
02:20 - here take whatever number is in cats and
02:24 - assign that value to the variable called
02:27 - dogs and then we display them again
02:29 - remember your your programs working
02:31 - downwards so it does this it does this
02:34 - then we output those values and then
02:37 - we're changing the value in dogs and
02:39 - then we're out putting the values again
02:41 - and this looks perhaps confusing because
02:45 - it reminds people of an equation for one
02:48 - thing it looks as though we're saying
02:50 - the number of dogs and the number of
02:52 - cats is the same but that's not what
02:54 - we're doing here
02:55 - this is assigning a value to the dog's
03:00 - variable when we write a variable and we
03:03 - write equals and then some value we
03:05 - assign a value to the variable we're
03:08 - actually changing the value in this
03:10 - dog's variable using this assignment
03:12 - operator technically it's not an
03:15 - equality operator it's an assignment
03:17 - operator here this equals and the value
03:22 - that we're giving dogs is whatever value
03:24 - cats as and that's three because we
03:27 - assign the value three to it so we end
03:29 - up with cats is unchanged it's still
03:31 - three and a number of dogs is eight by
03:35 - the time we run the program let's try
03:37 - this again so there we go with a both
03:39 - three now these variables don't know
03:44 - about each other
03:45 - they don't it's not like they they're
03:48 - not it's not like the number of dogs is
03:49 - forever linked to the number of cats so
03:52 - if I write here cats equals ten what
03:56 - have I done now
03:57 - well the value of cats was three I set
04:01 - the number of dogs to the number of cats
04:04 - I set it to three then I changed the
04:06 - number of cats to ten the number of dogs
04:09 - is still three so we should have dogs
04:12 - equals three and cats equals ten let's
04:15 - run this and that's what we've got dogs
04:18 - three and cats ten often I want to
04:22 - output the values of variables multiple
04:25 - times as I go through my program
04:27 - for example when I'm debugging and I
04:29 - like to just put numbers on those so
04:31 - here I could say 1 and this is 1 and
04:35 - let's say this is 2 and this is 2 makes
04:39 - it just a little bit clearer I think
04:42 - what's going on so it looks like this
04:45 - try that out for yourself so declare
04:49 - some variables you can have 2 3 however
04:51 - many you like display them try assigning
04:55 - new values to them and try assigning the
04:58 - value in one variable to another and
05:00 - display them again and if you like you
05:03 - can carry on change the values again
05:05 - output the values again in your console
05:08 - it's really worth doing this so you may
05:10 - be watching thinking that you can just
05:12 - memorize this and you can up to a point
05:14 - but you'll quickly lose the thread of
05:17 - what's happening if you don't practice
05:18 - it's very important to practice this try
05:21 - it out practically the more you do that
05:23 - the better okay so have a go at this
05:26 - yourself try declaring variables
05:28 - outputting them changing the values
05:31 - outputting them again and I'll catch you
05:34 - in the next video until then happy
05:36 - coding
