00:00 - in this video we're going to talk a bit
00:02 - more about this program and we're going
00:04 - to talk about buil-in
00:05 - functions so again there will be a lot
00:08 - of
00:09 - lingo a lot of technical terminology in
00:12 - this video but you don't have to
00:13 - memorize it or even fully understand it
00:17 - you'll get used to it gradually as you
00:19 - go through the course so the first thing
00:22 - that we do in this program is we declare
00:24 - a variable and assign this string to it
00:29 - in other words we create this variable
00:31 - and we attach this value to
00:34 - it if you've used a different
00:36 - programming
00:38 - language like Java or Pearl or C++ or
00:42 - whatever you may have got used to using
00:45 - some kind of word there on the left of
00:48 - the
00:49 - variable to say look I'm declaring a
00:52 - variable but python doesn't have any
00:55 - such word to declare a variable in
00:57 - Python you simply assign a value to it
01:02 - so in C++ you might type this in Java
01:06 - you might type this with a capital
01:08 - letter in JavaScript VAR in Pearl my and
01:12 - so on in Python there is no special
01:16 - keyword for declaring
01:19 - variables then we use this print
01:22 - function to display the text enter your
01:25 - name what actually is a function a
01:28 - function is just a block of code that
01:30 - you can run via its name we then use the
01:34 - input
01:35 - function to get some text from the user
01:39 - and we assign that text to this variable
01:43 - called name now functions in Python can
01:46 - be passed values so they can they can be
01:49 - passed values either by giving a literal
01:53 - value to them or giving them some
01:55 - variable that refers to the values you
01:58 - want to pass to them in other words we
02:00 - can send some data to a function when we
02:04 - call the function when we run the
02:07 - function which the function can then do
02:09 - stuff
02:10 - with so here's an example where we are
02:13 - passing a string literal to the print
02:17 - function we are giving the print
02:19 - function some data to work with namely
02:22 - this and we call these bits of data that
02:25 - we passed to functions function
02:28 - arguments now here we can see an example
02:30 - of a function returning some value to
02:34 - the main program where it was called so
02:38 - not only can you pass values to
02:40 - functions you can get values back from
02:45 - functions we say that functions can
02:47 - return values and here the input
02:51 - function returns whatever text the user
02:54 - types and we then declare and assign
02:58 - another variable
03:01 - and then we're just joining some strings
03:02 - together and printing them out with the
03:04 - print
03:05 - function now we can change this program
03:08 - a bit if we take this string here and
03:11 - I'm going to cut it from there and paste
03:14 - it into the round brackets of input
03:17 - let's get rid of this print and if we
03:20 - run this now it does the same thing as
03:23 - before except I can now type my name on
03:26 - the same line as this text so if you
03:30 - pass a string to input it will print
03:33 - that text before waiting for the user to
03:36 - enter
03:37 - input and you're going to get
03:40 - both the stuff that input
03:43 - prints and the stuff that the user Types
03:46 - on the same line so it behaves more like
03:48 - a sort of a shell apart from that this
03:51 - program works exactly the same as before
03:54 - so definitely try this out if you
03:55 - haven't already try the program out and
03:58 - try doing this
04:00 - and you might want to see if you can get
04:01 - a program to do something a bit
04:03 - different like for example can you get
04:06 - it to ask the users's age after it asks
04:09 - for their name and then output the age
04:12 - along with their
04:14 - name anything you can do to practice at
04:17 - this stage is going to be very
04:21 - useful so input and print are built-in
04:25 - functions in Python they're built into
04:28 - python
04:31 - we can create our own functions as well
04:34 - and we're going to look at that later
04:36 - you might wonder what other built-in
04:39 - functions there are in Python let's go
04:42 - to a web browser and search in buil-in
04:46 - functions I'll search for python.org
04:50 - because that's the most authoritative
04:54 - place to find this list I think here we
04:58 - go so so these are all of Python's
05:01 - built-in functions and again you don't
05:04 - have to memorize this by the end of the
05:07 - course you will have seen and used
05:09 - almost all of these functions so do try
05:12 - playing around with this a bit and see
05:15 - what you can make it
05:16 - do this is a free video from my course
05:20 - Python and machine learning for complete
05:23 - beginners I'm releasing the first couple
05:25 - of chapters of this course completely
05:28 - for free on YouTube to get you started
05:30 - with python I plan to upload new videos
05:34 - here to YouTube every Monday and every
05:37 - Thursday for at least a couple of months
05:40 - if you're interested in the complete
05:42 - course which teaches you python from
05:44 - scratch and eventually progresses to
05:47 - things like creating graphical user
05:49 - interfaces and using neural networks
05:52 - principal component analysis cluster
05:55 - analysis all that stuff and much more
05:58 - besides then you can find a link in the
06:00 - description or just go to this URL on
06:03 - the screen right here if you finish the
06:05 - whole course you'll be able to write all
06:08 - kinds of general purpose programs in
06:10 - Python and use Python to do machine
06:12 - learning and artificial intelligence as
06:15 - well thank you for watching until next
06:17 - time happy coding

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we're going to talk a bit more about this program and we're going to talk about builin functions so again there will be a lot of lingo a lot of technical terminology in this video but you don't have to memorize it or even fully understand it you'll get used to it gradually as you go through the course so the first thing that we do in this program is we declare a variable and assign this string to it in other words we create this variable and we attach this value to it if you've used a different programming language like Java or Pearl or C++ or whatever you may have got used to using some kind of word there on the left of the variable to say look I'm declaring a variable but python doesn't have any such word to declare a variable in Python you simply assign a value to it so in C++ you might type this in Java you might type this with a capital letter in JavaScript VAR in Pearl my and so on in Python there is no special keyword for declaring variables then we use this print function to display the text enter your name what actually is a function a function is just a block of code that you can run via its name we then use the input function to get some text from the user and we assign that text to this variable called name now functions in Python can be passed values so they can they can be passed values either by giving a literal value to them or giving them some variable that refers to the values you want to pass to them in other words we can send some data to a function when we call the function when we run the function which the function can then do stuff with so here's an example where we are passing a string literal to the print function we are giving the print function some data to work with namely this and we call these bits of data that we passed to functions function arguments now here we can see an example of a function returning some value to the main program where it was called so not only can you pass values to functions you can get values back from functions we say that functions can return values and here the input function returns whatever text the user types and we then declare and assign another variable and then we're just joining some strings together and printing them out with the print function now we can change this program a bit if we take this string here and I'm going to cut it from there and paste it into the round brackets of input let's get rid of this print and if we run this now it does the same thing as before except I can now type my name on the same line as this text so if you pass a string to input it will print that text before waiting for the user to enter input and you're going to get both the stuff that input prints and the stuff that the user Types on the same line so it behaves more like a sort of a shell apart from that this program works exactly the same as before so definitely try this out if you haven't already try the program out and try doing this and you might want to see if you can get a program to do something a bit different like for example can you get it to ask the users's age after it asks for their name and then output the age along with their name anything you can do to practice at this stage is going to be very useful so input and print are builtin functions in Python they're built into python we can create our own functions as well and we're going to look at that later you might wonder what other builtin functions there are in Python let's go to a web browser and search in builin functions I'll search for python.org because that's the most authoritative place to find this list I think here we go so so these are all of Python's builtin functions and again you don't have to memorize this by the end of the course you will have seen and used almost all of these functions so do try playing around with this a bit and see what you can make it do this is a free video from my course Python and machine learning for complete beginners I'm releasing the first couple of chapters of this course completely for free on YouTube to get you started with python I plan to upload new videos here to YouTube every Monday and every Thursday for at least a couple of months if you're interested in the complete course which teaches you python from scratch and eventually progresses to things like creating graphical user interfaces and using neural networks principal component analysis cluster analysis all that stuff and much more besides then you can find a link in the description or just go to this URL on the screen right here if you finish the whole course you'll be able to write all kinds of general purpose programs in Python and use Python to do machine learning and artificial intelligence as well thank you for watching until next time happy coding
