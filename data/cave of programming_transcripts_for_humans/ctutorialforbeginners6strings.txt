00:17 - hello this is John from Cave of
00:20 - programming. comom in this tutorial uh
00:22 - in C++ for complete beginners we're
00:25 - going to look at strings so I hope you
00:27 - had a go at um playing with integer
00:30 - variables from the last
00:33 - video otherwise this is going to
00:35 - gradually go over your head hopefully
00:36 - you've played around with that a bit and
00:38 - I'm going to create a new project here
00:40 - let's create a new C++ project select
00:43 - hello world C++ project and I'm going to
00:45 - call this
00:48 - strings so a string in C++ is um it
00:53 - means uh like a bunch of letters like
00:55 - some text basically let's get rid of
00:57 - this C out in the main program
01:01 - and uh we saw in the last video that you
01:03 - can type things like int uh value you
01:06 - can call it what you like equals six and
01:09 - then you can do stuff like SE
01:11 - out and uh value another Chevron and end
01:15 - BL
01:17 - semicolon uh one one thing that I want
01:19 - to point out here well a couple of
01:21 - things don't forget semicolons on the
01:23 - end of lines uh because it's really easy
01:25 - to forget those and if you uh don't put
01:28 - them in it won't work
01:31 - also um bear in mind that the compiler
01:34 - is going to read line by line starting
01:36 - at the top and moving down the file so I
01:41 - can't do this I can't put C out value
01:44 - here and int value equals six underneath
01:46 - it because when it gets to here it
01:48 - hasn't seen value it doesn't know it
01:50 - exists it only we only Define um value
01:55 - down
01:57 - here uh so um what I want to show you in
02:00 - this tutorial is you can do a similar
02:03 - thing with text so if you want to work
02:06 - with text and C++ instead of saying int
02:10 - value you could say
02:12 - string value and now we don't want to
02:14 - say equals six we want to give it some
02:17 - text so we put we always put um what we
02:19 - call string literals bits of text in
02:22 - double quotes so I'm going to put hello
02:25 - this is a string
02:30 - so it's just some literal text and we've
02:32 - assigned it to this
02:34 - variable now actually um this variable
02:38 - value is is not quite the same as the
02:42 - integer variables that we saw in the
02:44 - last video not only is it not the same
02:47 - type it's a string instead of an integer
02:50 - but this is technically what we call an
02:52 - object in C++ and string is technically
02:56 - a class whereas int is a primitive type
03:01 - and that won't make much sense at the
03:02 - moment but I just want to mention it cuz
03:04 - I'm going to keep going over these
03:05 - Concepts and gradually you'll see what I
03:08 - mean uh so if we just do this we we we
03:11 - could call it value we could call it
03:12 - whatever we want um let's call it I
03:14 - don't know text or maybe text one that's
03:17 - that's
03:18 - good so if we if we run this program now
03:21 - let's run it might have to build it
03:23 - first let's go to project build project
03:27 - and click run
03:31 - and yes I want I want to save it and it
03:33 - says down here hello this is a
03:36 - string so we could have another string
03:39 - here let's say string text 2
03:42 - equals um well let's make this let's
03:46 - make the first one hello space and the
03:49 - second one I'm going to put Fred in
03:53 - there and the reason I want to do that
03:55 - semicolon is because I want to show you
03:57 - that you can also concatenate strings
03:59 - with join them together so we could put
04:01 - here see
04:03 - out
04:04 - text
04:06 - 2 endler so we've got two bits of text
04:09 - two
04:10 - strings and let's run that and see if it
04:13 - works so it says hello
04:16 - Fred and um we could also do what we've
04:19 - seen in a previous tutorial we could say
04:21 - text to and another Chevron here and get
04:24 - rid of the second one now so we could
04:26 - output them both with one see out
04:28 - statement so so if I run this that will
04:31 - also
04:32 - work now before I I show you um
04:36 - concatenation I just want to point out
04:38 - that strings are one of the things that
04:40 - are not completely standard between
04:43 - compilers so if you try this program and
04:45 - it doesn't work and you're absolutely
04:47 - sure that your program looks the same as
04:49 - mine and you've got everything correctly
04:51 - in it if you're using a different
04:54 - compiler that may be why you might have
04:58 - to do something a bit different on
05:00 - visual C++ I don't know but if you're
05:02 - using a different compiler you might
05:03 - have to do something like uh put
05:07 - include string at the top here possibly
05:11 - I don't know um or you might even need
05:14 - to give the string a uppercase first
05:16 - letter which doesn't work with my
05:18 - compiler but with yours it
05:20 - might string isn't a C++ keyword it's uh
05:25 - something that's kind of added onto C++
05:28 - an extra kind of thing
05:31 - so bear that in mind if your if this
05:33 - program doesn't work on your compiler
05:34 - but hopefully it will so we've seen that
05:37 - you can add integers together and you
05:39 - might wonder can I add strings together
05:42 - and the answer is yes let's create
05:44 - another string string text 3 set that
05:47 - equal to text one plus text
05:52 - 2 so this looks like addition but
05:55 - technically it's concatenation
05:57 - concatenate an ordinary English word
06:00 - that we just don't use much normally but
06:02 - it's the right word to use in a
06:03 - programming context to concatenate one
06:06 - string with another means to add it on
06:08 - to join it on to the um first string so
06:12 - we're concatenating this to this and a
06:15 - resulting string we storing in this text
06:17 - 3 variable so let's output text 3 here
06:21 - see
06:22 - out text
06:25 - 3 endler and now we'll have two lines
06:28 - we'll have this line
06:30 - and we'll have this line and hopefully
06:31 - they'll both look identical they'll both
06:33 - be hello Fred and I put a space there so
06:36 - we've got space between the words let's
06:37 - try that so I'll save it and run it and
06:42 - there we go we've got two hello
06:44 - Freds so have a play around with this
06:46 - try declaring some strings try
06:49 - concatenating them try outputting them
06:51 - in in various different ways uh make
06:53 - sure that you can get the hang of this
06:56 - and in the next tutorial probably what
06:57 - we're going to do is we're going to look
06:59 - I don't know possibly getting input I'll
07:02 - think about that but yeah probably cuz
07:04 - it's interesting and we want to try to
07:06 - do as much interesting stuff as quickly
07:08 - as possible so that's it for this
07:10 - tutorial and until next time happy
07:12 - coding

Cleaned transcript:

hello this is John from Cave of programming. comom in this tutorial uh in C++ for complete beginners we're going to look at strings so I hope you had a go at um playing with integer variables from the last video otherwise this is going to gradually go over your head hopefully you've played around with that a bit and I'm going to create a new project here let's create a new C++ project select hello world C++ project and I'm going to call this strings so a string in C++ is um it means uh like a bunch of letters like some text basically let's get rid of this C out in the main program and uh we saw in the last video that you can type things like int uh value you can call it what you like equals six and then you can do stuff like SE out and uh value another Chevron and end BL semicolon uh one one thing that I want to point out here well a couple of things don't forget semicolons on the end of lines uh because it's really easy to forget those and if you uh don't put them in it won't work also um bear in mind that the compiler is going to read line by line starting at the top and moving down the file so I can't do this I can't put C out value here and int value equals six underneath it because when it gets to here it hasn't seen value it doesn't know it exists it only we only Define um value down here uh so um what I want to show you in this tutorial is you can do a similar thing with text so if you want to work with text and C++ instead of saying int value you could say string value and now we don't want to say equals six we want to give it some text so we put we always put um what we call string literals bits of text in double quotes so I'm going to put hello this is a string so it's just some literal text and we've assigned it to this variable now actually um this variable value is is not quite the same as the integer variables that we saw in the last video not only is it not the same type it's a string instead of an integer but this is technically what we call an object in C++ and string is technically a class whereas int is a primitive type and that won't make much sense at the moment but I just want to mention it cuz I'm going to keep going over these Concepts and gradually you'll see what I mean uh so if we just do this we we we could call it value we could call it whatever we want um let's call it I don't know text or maybe text one that's that's good so if we if we run this program now let's run it might have to build it first let's go to project build project and click run and yes I want I want to save it and it says down here hello this is a string so we could have another string here let's say string text 2 equals um well let's make this let's make the first one hello space and the second one I'm going to put Fred in there and the reason I want to do that semicolon is because I want to show you that you can also concatenate strings with join them together so we could put here see out text 2 endler so we've got two bits of text two strings and let's run that and see if it works so it says hello Fred and um we could also do what we've seen in a previous tutorial we could say text to and another Chevron here and get rid of the second one now so we could output them both with one see out statement so so if I run this that will also work now before I I show you um concatenation I just want to point out that strings are one of the things that are not completely standard between compilers so if you try this program and it doesn't work and you're absolutely sure that your program looks the same as mine and you've got everything correctly in it if you're using a different compiler that may be why you might have to do something a bit different on visual C++ I don't know but if you're using a different compiler you might have to do something like uh put include string at the top here possibly I don't know um or you might even need to give the string a uppercase first letter which doesn't work with my compiler but with yours it might string isn't a C++ keyword it's uh something that's kind of added onto C++ an extra kind of thing so bear that in mind if your if this program doesn't work on your compiler but hopefully it will so we've seen that you can add integers together and you might wonder can I add strings together and the answer is yes let's create another string string text 3 set that equal to text one plus text 2 so this looks like addition but technically it's concatenation concatenate an ordinary English word that we just don't use much normally but it's the right word to use in a programming context to concatenate one string with another means to add it on to join it on to the um first string so we're concatenating this to this and a resulting string we storing in this text 3 variable so let's output text 3 here see out text 3 endler and now we'll have two lines we'll have this line and we'll have this line and hopefully they'll both look identical they'll both be hello Fred and I put a space there so we've got space between the words let's try that so I'll save it and run it and there we go we've got two hello Freds so have a play around with this try declaring some
