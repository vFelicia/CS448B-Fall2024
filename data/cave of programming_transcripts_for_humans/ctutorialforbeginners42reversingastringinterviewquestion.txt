00:16 - hello this is John from cave of program
00:20 - intercom in this tutorial we're going to
00:22 - look at reversing 8 primitive strings
00:25 - C++ in place in other words we're going
00:28 - to take a string like this so star test
00:33 - equals hello and we're going to reverse
00:38 - it without actually copying it to a new
00:40 - array or actually gonna traverse this
00:42 - particular array the reason this is
00:46 - important is well for one thing is it's
00:50 - just something that you you probably
00:52 - should be able to do if you've got a
00:54 - good grasp of how arrays work but also
00:59 - it comes up a lot as an interview
01:01 - question and I once got a job just
01:03 - because I could do this question I think
01:05 - I even messed it up a bit but because I
01:08 - could at least explain what I was doing
01:10 - and hopefully it was clear that if I'd
01:13 - been able to test the code as I went
01:14 - along I would have got a right answer
01:16 - because of that I got the job so it's
01:19 - well worth knowing how to do this so if
01:22 - you've seen the the previous tutorials
01:24 - and or at least if you know your way
01:26 - around pointers and arrays in C++ then
01:29 - it's worth having a go at this just to
01:32 - see how far you get this is actually
01:34 - kind of more intuitive to do using a for
01:38 - loop and working just with arrays and
01:40 - just leave the pointers out of it but
01:43 - just for fun here to get some more
01:45 - practice with pointers I'm gonna show
01:47 - you how to do this using pointers and
01:50 - the way that I show you is just one way
01:51 - of doing this there are lots of ways of
01:54 - doing this but let's have a look at an
01:56 - example of how we could tackle this so
02:00 - firstly I'm gonna declare a pointer to
02:02 - the start of the array let's say char
02:05 - pointer P I'll call it P star equals
02:11 - although we actually are going to move
02:13 - this pointer equals test select now
02:16 - points to the start of the array to the
02:17 - letter age let's also declare a pointer
02:20 - to the end and to get this I need to
02:23 - know how long the array
02:25 - is so let's say here int land in other
02:31 - words length and length of the array
02:32 - equals equals size of text now because
02:40 - each char is one byte size of the whole
02:44 - array will give me the number of
02:46 - characters in the array in the whole
02:48 - string except that we've got a null
02:51 - terminator character here that doesn't
02:52 - print they're just marks where the end
02:54 - of the string is that's padded by the
02:57 - double quotation marks so to get the
03:00 - number of characters if you want to say
03:01 - and chars we will have to do the size of
03:05 - negative one like that now we can say
03:09 - char pointer Pete end and now supposing
03:12 - you want to point this to the last
03:13 - character in the array if we did equals
03:17 - text plus n chars so number of choice
03:23 - should be 5 that's the number of visible
03:26 - characters in the string if the star
03:28 - here this is a star was pointing our age
03:32 - and we added 5 we go to one going to be
03:35 - here two is the L 3 is elegant four is
03:38 - zero
03:39 - Sarris oh and the fifth will be off the
03:43 - end of the array so if we want to point
03:45 - this to the last character in the array
03:48 - we're gonna have to take the star plus
03:51 - the number of characters negative one
03:54 - like that so no need to put brackets
03:59 - around any of this because it doesn't
04:01 - matter what or that we do the plus and
04:03 - minus in in any case so now you can
04:06 - check it if you want but let's let's
04:08 - just do that just to prove it so the
04:11 - thing pointed to by the PN's now will be
04:14 - the last letter which which is o in in
04:17 - this case in this string let's run this
04:20 - and I think those warnings you know got
04:24 - unused variable P starts here in
04:26 - problems but we see there's a letter O
04:29 - there which is what we wanted and now
04:32 - what we can do is we want we I'm gonna
04:34 - point one pointer to the first
04:37 - let's at one pointer to the last letter
04:39 - and I swap those two characters around
04:42 - then I'm going to move the start point
04:44 - of forward to the next character and the
04:47 - end pointer back to the second to last
04:49 - character swap those around and keep
04:51 - going until start at what keep going as
04:54 - long as start is pointing to a lesser
04:57 - point in the string then the end so to
05:01 - do that I can say while P star is less
05:06 - than end because remember we're allowed
05:08 - to compare pointers like that this is
05:11 - saying well start points to a memory
05:13 - location smaller than what end points to
05:17 - and I'm gonna in this while loop I'm
05:20 - gonna increment start so star plus plus
05:23 - and I'm gonna increment I'm gonna
05:25 - decrement and so I'm gonna say and minus
05:29 - minus now we want to swap before we do
05:32 - that we want to swap the thing pointed
05:34 - to by start with the thing pointed to by
05:36 - end so I can faith say thing pointed to
05:39 - by star P star equals the thing pointed
05:46 - to by P end and that's taken whatever
05:49 - character PN pointed out and moved it
05:52 - into that memory location pointed out by
05:55 - this star pointer here but when we do
05:58 - that we overwrite what's in start and we
06:00 - want to put what ever start putting
06:02 - stuff in wherever end points so let's
06:05 - save were and the character the end
06:09 - points are let's say char save equals
06:12 - thing pointed to by the end pointer then
06:16 - we set star sorry by the start pointer
06:19 - cuz that's the one we're overwriting
06:21 - here so let's say we've saved that
06:24 - character the star pointer to resets we
06:27 - set whatever was at a star location here
06:31 - we've set that to whatever was at the
06:33 - end location so we'll swap we'll take in
06:37 - this case start point set H
06:41 - to start with so we saved the age
06:43 - character here and then we set that
06:47 - memory location to whatever endpoints
06:49 - are which is going to be O and then
06:52 - finally we can say point whatever
06:55 - endpoints at the end
06:57 - set it equal to the character we saved
06:59 - from the starts and our set
07:01 - wherever the end point and the end
07:03 - memory location which is this memory
07:05 - location put the age in there that star
07:10 - originally points that so we've swapped
07:13 - the two characters around we started
07:15 - start pointing at age and end pointing
07:18 - at own and then we've swapped those two
07:21 - characters around and this syntax is
07:23 - very common if you want to swap two
07:25 - things you have to remember to save the
07:28 - thing you're swapping because otherwise
07:31 - you'll overwrite it when you do the
07:32 - first swap so you need to set this set
07:39 - the first thing look the first things
07:42 - memory location equal to that anything
07:44 - but first save that start of thing then
07:47 - you set the end thing to the start thing
07:49 - this is something that again feeling
07:51 - explaining it that you might only get
07:55 - this when you really look at yourself
07:57 - and maybe put some C outs in to see
08:00 - what's happening here but I think that
08:02 - should work
08:03 - what's this warning here I'm curious it
08:06 - says unused variable stop but I think
08:08 - that's just because we haven't built a
08:10 - program that's hangover from the last
08:12 - build
08:12 - now let's output C out text and see if
08:17 - it's worked let's run this so we'll run
08:21 - this and we've got hopefully a reverse
08:24 - string so things to check also you want
08:28 - to check what happens if there's nothing
08:30 - in this string so if it's like that does
08:32 - the code crash and we hope not and we
08:36 - haven't got crash here so then size of
08:39 - is going to be 1 it's still gonna be 1
08:42 - because we've got the North terminator
08:44 - in there remember size of minus 1 is 0
08:46 - so that 0
08:48 - and here the end is going to be pointed
08:51 - to the start plus zero minus one so it's
08:55 - actually going to be pointing before the
08:56 - start so the loop will never execute I
09:00 - think that's correct at least it seems
09:02 - to work and let's put an eighteen-year
09:04 - so what if we got one character now size
09:07 - up will be 2h plus the null terminator
09:11 - minus 1 is going to be 1 so the end
09:15 - points to the start plus plus 1 minus 1
09:21 - so it points the same point as a start
09:24 - pointer so again the loop doesn't
09:26 - execute at all because start is not less
09:29 - than end and we leave the string
09:31 - unchanged and if you've got two
09:33 - characters then it works just fine
09:36 - small T in the H there and it should
09:39 - work for Strings of any size basically
09:43 - so this is one solution I think if you
09:47 - undo this sort of for loop don't use
09:49 - pointers just use array syntax it does
09:52 - look a bit more elegant and there are a
09:54 - lot of other ways of doing this so to
09:57 - practice this I'd say try reversing your
10:00 - own string first either like go through
10:03 - this code and try to understand it
10:05 - thoroughly puts the else in it if
10:07 - there's anything you don't understand
10:08 - and print what you actually see at that
10:10 - particular point you can also try
10:13 - writing your own code just using for
10:14 - loop and you can start using yeah it
10:18 - could be a for loop and array sort of
10:21 - syntax instead of pointers you can
10:24 - google for code if you go before C++
10:27 - reverse string in place you'll get lots
10:30 - of example code as well and try try
10:34 - getting something to work and then also
10:36 - try writing in a different way see if
10:38 - you can think of a different way to do
10:39 - this and again it's a really really good
10:42 - drill with arrays and if you use
10:44 - pointers it's a good drill with pointers
10:46 - as well and this question if you go for
10:50 - an interview with a C++ job for a C++
10:53 - job you might well face this exact
10:55 - question
10:56 - so it's really worth it's really worth
11:00 - getting your head around okay so that's
11:02 - it for this tutorial and until next time
11:04 - happy coding
11:16 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello this is John from cave of program intercom in this tutorial we're going to look at reversing 8 primitive strings C++ in place in other words we're going to take a string like this so star test equals hello and we're going to reverse it without actually copying it to a new array or actually gonna traverse this particular array the reason this is important is well for one thing is it's just something that you you probably should be able to do if you've got a good grasp of how arrays work but also it comes up a lot as an interview question and I once got a job just because I could do this question I think I even messed it up a bit but because I could at least explain what I was doing and hopefully it was clear that if I'd been able to test the code as I went along I would have got a right answer because of that I got the job so it's well worth knowing how to do this so if you've seen the the previous tutorials and or at least if you know your way around pointers and arrays in C++ then it's worth having a go at this just to see how far you get this is actually kind of more intuitive to do using a for loop and working just with arrays and just leave the pointers out of it but just for fun here to get some more practice with pointers I'm gonna show you how to do this using pointers and the way that I show you is just one way of doing this there are lots of ways of doing

actually are going to move this pointer equals test select now points to the start of the array to the letter age let's also declare a pointer to the end and to get this I need to know how long the array is so let's say here int land in other words length and length of the array equals equals size of text now because each char is one byte size of the whole array will give me the number of

quotation marks so to get the number of characters if you want to say and chars we will have to do the size of negative one like that now we can say char pointer Pete end and now supposing you want to point this to the last character in the array if we did equals text plus n chars so number of choice should be 5 that's the number of visible characters in the string if the star here this is a star was pointing our age and we added 5 we go to one going to be here two is the L 3 is elegant four is zero Sarris oh and the fifth will be off the end of the array so if we want to point this to the last character in the array we're gonna have to take the star plus the number of characters negative one like that so no need to put brackets around any of this because it doesn't matter what or that we do the plus and minus in in any case so now you can check it if you want but let's let's just do that just to prove it so the thing pointed to by the PN's now will be the last letter which which is o in in this case in this string let's run this and I think those warnings you know got unused variable P starts here in problems but we see there's a letter O there which is what we wanted and now what we can do is we want we I'm gonna point one pointer to the first let's at one pointer to the last letter and I swap those two characters around then I'm going to move the start point of forward to the next character and the end pointer back to the second to last character swap those around and keep going until start at what keep going as long as start is pointing to a lesser point in the
