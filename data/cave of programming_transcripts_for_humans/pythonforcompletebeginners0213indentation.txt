00:00 - at this point I thought it was probably
00:02 - worth inserting a video on something
00:05 - that to me seems obvious but I think for
00:08 - a beginner programmer is not necessarily
00:11 - obvious by any
00:13 - means so supposing you've got a
00:15 - loop or some other construct like an if
00:18 - statement let's use a loop to illustrate
00:21 - this so I'm going to say for I in range
00:26 - three
00:27 - column now we know that we have to
00:30 - indent whatever goes in the body of the
00:33 - loop the indentation of normally four
00:37 - spaces is what defines whether the lines
00:41 - that we write after this are still part
00:44 - of this Loop or not so if I want to
00:46 - write something here like just print out
00:49 - the loop
00:50 - variable then we have to indent it
00:54 - otherwise if I try to write stuff here
00:56 - that's not indented this is not part of
00:59 - the loop Loop code anymore in fact I'm
01:02 - not sure whether it will work I think my
01:05 - bet is it will work let's just try
01:10 - it yeah and we can see that it does
01:13 - print I so you can still access this
01:15 - Loop variable down here outside of the
01:18 - loop and it just has the variable two
01:21 - that's the last variable that it was set
01:22 - to but this line does not get repeated
01:25 - only this line gets repeated only this
01:28 - is part of the loop because it's
01:31 - indented let's get rid of that now
01:33 - supposing you want to have some other
01:36 - statement within the loop that has its
01:38 - own indentation like for example an if
01:41 - let's say if I equals 2 column now the
01:47 - code that goes in here will get indented
01:49 - by eight spaces let's do
01:52 - print I is
01:56 - 2 because we have to indent this four
02:00 - spaces to say that it's part of this if
02:02 - statement it's the code block that the
02:05 - if statement applies to but that itself
02:08 - is already indented for spaces so this
02:11 - is going to have to be indented a total
02:13 - of eight spaces and when I hit the
02:15 - return key here actually Visual Studio
02:18 - code automatically puts my cursor in the
02:21 - right place so a lot lot of the time you
02:24 - don't really need to think about this I
02:26 - have come across professors of computer
02:29 - science who believe you should use an
02:31 - editor as a beginner that helps you as
02:34 - little as possible and there are some
02:36 - editors I know for a fact for example
02:38 - for Java that seem to put the cursor
02:41 - deliberately in the wrong place even
02:43 - never mind the right place or never mind
02:46 - being neutral about
02:49 - it I personally don't recommend that at
02:52 - all I think that beginners are better
02:55 - off using the equipment that profession
02:59 - profs would use such as Visual Studio
03:02 - code I don't think an unhelpful editor
03:04 - helps beginners at all in my experience
03:07 - you're better off trying to make the
03:09 - learning experience as smooth as
03:11 - possible using professional tools and
03:13 - getting used to them rather than using
03:15 - some kind of tool for beginners or some
03:17 - sort of thing that's not intended for
03:20 - programmers like Windows notepad or
03:21 - something I don't agree with that
03:23 - philosophy but each to their own anyway
03:25 - the main point of this video is just
03:28 - that you can end up needing multiple
03:33 - indents if you've got constructs within
03:36 - constructs once you start to get to the
03:39 - point where you've got constructs like
03:41 - this indented constructs within
03:43 - constructs within constructs so if for
03:45 - example I had a a for Loop that was part
03:48 - of this if block or another if within
03:50 - this if well you can do that but once
03:53 - you get up to three levels of indent you
03:57 - should probably start thinking about
03:58 - restructuring your code using typically
04:02 - functions or methods which we're going
04:04 - to look at later on and certainly I
04:07 - would say probably if you get up to four
04:09 - levels of indent that's just probably
04:11 - too much and a code probably needs
04:14 - rewriting however there may be
04:16 - exceptions to that it depends exactly
04:18 - what you're doing the aim is always to
04:20 - write clear elegant code hello you've
04:23 - been watching a free sample from my
04:26 - Python and machine learning for complete
04:28 - beginners course I'm uploading enough
04:31 - videos from the start of the course to
04:33 - get you started with python and machine
04:35 - learning the full course is absolutely
04:37 - massive if you're interested in it
04:39 - please click the link in the description
04:42 - the complete course covers not only
04:44 - basic python but also some fairly
04:46 - Advanced python even some desktop
04:49 - programming stuff and then goes on to
04:51 - machine learning and artificial
04:53 - intelligence until next time happy
04:56 - coding

Cleaned transcript:

at this point I thought it was probably worth inserting a video on something that to me seems obvious but I think for a beginner programmer is not necessarily obvious by any means so supposing you've got a loop or some other construct like an if statement let's use a loop to illustrate this so I'm going to say for I in range three column now we know that we have to indent whatever goes in the body of the loop the indentation of normally four spaces is what defines whether the lines that we write after this are still part of this Loop or not so if I want to write something here like just print out the loop variable then we have to indent it otherwise if I try to write stuff here that's not indented this is not part of the loop Loop code anymore in fact I'm not sure whether it will work I think my bet is it will work let's just try it yeah and we can see that it does print I so you can still access this Loop variable down here outside of the loop and it just has the variable two that's the last variable that it was set to but this line does not get repeated only this line gets repeated only this is part of the loop because it's indented let's get rid of that now supposing you want to have some other statement within the loop that has its own indentation like for example an if let's say if I equals 2 column now the code that goes in here will get indented by eight spaces let's do print I is 2 because we have to indent this four spaces to say that it's part of this if statement it's the code block that the if statement applies to but that itself is already indented for spaces so this is going to have to be indented a total of eight spaces and when I hit the return key here actually Visual Studio code automatically puts my cursor in the right place so a lot lot of the time you don't really need to think about this I have come across professors of computer science who believe you should use an editor as a beginner that helps you as little as possible and there are some editors I know for a fact for example for Java that seem to put the cursor deliberately in the wrong place even never mind the right place or never mind being neutral about it I personally don't recommend that at all I think that beginners are better off using the equipment that profession profs would use such as Visual Studio code I don't think an unhelpful editor helps beginners at all in my experience you're better off trying to make the learning experience as smooth as possible using professional tools and getting used to them rather than using some kind of tool for beginners or some sort of thing that's not intended for programmers like Windows notepad or something I don't agree with that philosophy but each to their own anyway the main point of this video is just that you can end up needing multiple indents if you've got constructs within constructs once you start to get to the point where you've got constructs like this indented constructs within constructs within constructs so if for example I had a a for Loop that was part of this if block or another if within this if well you can do that but once you get up to three levels of indent you should probably start thinking about restructuring your code using typically functions or methods which we're going to look at later on and certainly I would say probably if you get up to four levels of indent that's just probably too much and a code probably needs rewriting however there may be exceptions to that it depends exactly what you're doing the aim is always to write clear elegant code hello you've been watching a free sample from my Python and machine learning for complete beginners course I'm uploading enough videos from the start of the course to get you started with python and machine learning the full course is absolutely massive if you're interested in it please click the link in the description the complete course covers not only basic python but also some fairly Advanced python even some desktop programming stuff and then goes on to machine learning and artificial intelligence until next time happy coding
