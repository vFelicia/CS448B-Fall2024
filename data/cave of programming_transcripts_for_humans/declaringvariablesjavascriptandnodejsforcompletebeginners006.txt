00:00 - hello this is John from cave of
00:02 - programming comm and this is another
00:04 - video in the JavaScript to note note is
00:08 - for complete beginners course so in this
00:10 - video we're going to look at declaring
00:12 - variables in the last video we saw how
00:15 - you could create variables so what we're
00:17 - doing here is here I've got a variable
00:21 - called message and we say that I'm
00:23 - assigning it the value hello world
00:25 - notice that text is in quotes because
00:27 - it's what we call a string and then
00:29 - later on after outputting that on a on
00:32 - the console
00:33 - after printing hello world I create
00:36 - another variable and assign it value 7
00:39 - notice the 7 is not in quotes and that's
00:42 - because it's a number
00:44 - we don't put numbers in quotes when we
00:46 - want to use them actually as a number so
00:50 - if I want to add and subtract things or
00:52 - whatever with this day's value down we
00:55 - don't put it in quotes so again we've
00:58 - got here we've got a while here we've
01:00 - were signing assigning the value 7 to a
01:03 - variable called days and were outputting
01:06 - it now we're going to be looking at this
01:09 - and if you're a complete beginner you'll
01:11 - probably this is you know and this is
01:12 - totally new to you it might seem
01:14 - confusing probably it will but you
01:16 - develop fluency with it just by using
01:18 - these ideas and it will become clearer
01:21 - later on what I want to show you here is
01:24 - we want to start off using best practice
01:27 - and there's a problem with what we did
01:29 - in the last video so supposing I wrote
01:33 - message equals hello we can use double
01:38 - quotes or single quotes it doesn't
01:40 - matter it's just switch at whichever you
01:41 - prefer there's no difference between
01:43 - them in JavaScript hello world let's
01:47 - write that and console log message
01:54 - notice variables don't get put in double
01:57 - quotes either as a mistake beginners
02:00 - sometimes may only text values get put
02:04 - in in quotes here all right
02:09 - so later on in my program I might write
02:13 - message with only one s as a mistake and
02:18 - I might say equals I don't know how are
02:24 - you and then write console dot log
02:30 - message let's run this program or maybe
02:38 - clear my console it's my least less
02:40 - confusing all right so this kind of does
02:43 - what you expect really
02:45 - this second variable with the
02:48 - misspelling is a completely different
02:51 - variable to this one now if you've got a
02:56 - big program and it can be very easy to
03:00 - misspell a variable name so it might
03:03 - have been my intention here to change
03:06 - the value of this variable which you can
03:08 - do you can give it a different value
03:11 - later on but what I've done instead is
03:13 - I've basically created and completely
03:16 - new variable with a different name just
03:18 - because I misspelt it so it perhaps it
03:22 - was my intention to do this just to
03:26 - change the value of this variable which
03:29 - you can do but because I miss spelt it I
03:33 - created an entirely new variable now the
03:36 - the upshot of this is that it's not good
03:41 - practice to simply create variables by
03:44 - directly assigning a value to them like
03:46 - this there are two things that we should
03:48 - do so we're going to do this in every
03:53 - JavaScript program that we create
03:55 - firstly at the top we're going to write
03:58 - this in double or single quotes we're
04:02 - going to write use space strict and then
04:06 - a semicolon at the end of it now if we
04:11 - write message equals let's say hello and
04:16 - then try to output message console.log
04:21 - message let's try this we get an error
04:29 - and that's actually a good thing what
04:33 - you straight forces is to do is it
04:35 - forces us to use a keyword to declare
04:38 - our variables on a keyword that we
04:39 - usually use is let so I say let's
04:43 - message equal hello and then I output
04:46 - message and if we run this program now
04:50 - it says hello it actually works okay so
04:57 - if you've been using JavaScript for a
05:01 - while and you're not a beginner then you
05:03 - will have also seen the keyword var so
05:06 - we could also also use var like this VAR
05:09 - message equals hello var you might guess
05:11 - is short for variable and this also
05:14 - works what's the difference between them
05:17 - well let is kind of a later introduction
05:21 - to JavaScript we're going to be using
05:24 - that for various reasons I'll go into
05:26 - later on but for now you just have to
05:31 - know that when we create a variable we
05:32 - should write let so let's message equals
05:35 - hello and you can change it later if you
05:38 - want to let's take a look so I can later
05:40 - I can say message equals how are you
05:44 - question mark and now let's output it
05:49 - again to see how it's changed console
05:53 - dot log message and we'll run it and it
05:59 - says how are you so if we look at this
06:04 - what we've done here when we say let
06:07 - message we call this declaring a
06:09 - variable now you can put comments in
06:12 - your JavaScript if you want a single
06:15 - line comment if you write two forward
06:18 - slashes like this everything that you
06:20 - write after that will be a comment
06:21 - so let's write here declare the variable
06:27 - message and assign
06:32 - the value hello to it alright and then
06:39 - what we're doing here is were print the
06:44 - variable let's write print let's just
06:49 - write print message and here what we're
06:53 - doing notice is no let keyword here
06:55 - we've declared the variable and we only
06:58 - have to declare the variable once in our
07:00 - program here what we're doing is just
07:02 - assigning a new value to an existing
07:04 - variable so here we're saying assign a
07:10 - new value to the variable message so we
07:21 - declare a variable we assign a value to
07:24 - it with the assignment operator equals
07:26 - we display it will print it on the
07:29 - console later on we assign a different
07:31 - value to it to the same variable how are
07:35 - you and we print that again on the
07:37 - console and if we run this program it
07:40 - does this so don't worry about this too
07:45 - much again if you are a complete
07:47 - beginner this will be confusing I've
07:50 - seen people try to learn programming by
07:53 - writing loads and loads of notes and
07:55 - that's the wrong way to learn it in my
07:57 - view the right way is just to practice
07:59 - it so the thing to do now is type this
08:02 - program out of yourself if you're a
08:04 - beginner especially and get it working
08:07 - and run it and don't sweat too much over
08:09 - what it's doing but look at it and think
08:12 - is it's the only way you could change
08:13 - this that wouldn't break it and if you
08:16 - can think of any way then try that out
08:18 - I'm sure you can think of some changes
08:21 - at least that you can make to this
08:22 - program that wouldn't break it have a go
08:26 - see if you can change this without
08:28 - breaking it once you've got it working
08:29 - but get this working first so type it
08:33 - out get it working and then try to
08:34 - experiment with it and see how you get
08:37 - on and you'll find that as you keep
08:39 - typing stuff and experimenting with it
08:42 - gradually your confusion will go away
08:45 - and your
08:45 - nc will build up and it will all begin
08:48 - to make sense but really learning
08:51 - programming I always say it's kind of in
08:53 - the fingers you got a type stuff and
08:57 - experiment with it it's it's useless in
08:59 - my view to make loads of notes and to
09:02 - really stir it something and agonize
09:05 - over it and try to understand what it
09:06 - means a lot of the time that's useless
09:08 - it's much better to actually type it out
09:11 - and practice it and play around with it
09:13 - okay so we'll leave it there for this
09:15 - video until next time happy coding
