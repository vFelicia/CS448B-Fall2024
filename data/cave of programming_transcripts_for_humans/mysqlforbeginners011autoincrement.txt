00:00 - hello this is John from kof programming
00:03 - do.com in this tutorial we're going to
00:05 - take a look at Auto incrementing primary
00:08 - keys so I'm going to drop my users table
00:11 - again get rid of it and uh I've got to
00:14 - actually write drop table users in there
00:17 - and now I'm going to recreate the table
00:19 - similar to what we had before so what we
00:21 - had before was something like this
00:23 - create table
00:25 - users and the columns are ID int which
00:29 - is the primary key we've got name text
00:34 - and
00:35 - email text but actually for the purposes
00:39 - of this tutorial let's just let's just
00:41 - have a name in there because it'll save
00:43 - a little bit of
00:44 - time um so um the the the only sort of
00:48 - problem with this uh which is a sort of
00:51 - problem is
00:53 - that the ID field here um we have to
00:56 - invent a unique value for it now
00:58 - sometimes that's what you want
01:00 - sometimes you're running some software
01:02 - or something and you naturally get an ID
01:05 - uh when a user creates a a new account
01:08 - let's say on your system and you want to
01:10 - insert that ID into the database and uh
01:13 - there are ways of of course of doing
01:15 - queries and checking that the new idea
01:17 - is unique this sort of thing but
01:20 - sometimes it's nice if you can just get
01:22 - my SQL to invent an ID for you and you
01:26 - can do that by making the primary key
01:28 - autoincrement
01:29 - so let's let's drop this users table
01:32 - again I'm going to go back to the stuff
01:35 - that I just
01:36 - typed and I'm going to after primary key
01:40 - so before the comma I'm going to type
01:42 - Auto uncore increment so this is a very
01:47 - MySQL specific keyword and what it does
01:50 - is it means that you can do inserts
01:53 - without specifying an ID and the ID that
01:55 - will be assigned to each row will just
01:57 - be incremented or increased from
01:59 - whatever the last value that was used
02:01 - was and it's going to start at one so
02:04 - let's create that table now and we'll
02:06 - say insert into users and now I won't
02:09 - specify an ID so I'll just specify the
02:12 - one column we've got now which is at the
02:14 - moment it's just the name column and
02:16 - we'll say values and by the way I did a
02:19 - bit of checking and apparently um
02:22 - although I've always mixed double and
02:23 - single quotes except where I was using a
02:26 - database that really wouldn't accept one
02:28 - one or the other apparent single quotes
02:31 - are considered a kind of default
02:33 - standard thing to use in SQL but my sqls
02:36 - seems to be just fine with double quotes
02:38 - anyway let's insert something into there
02:40 - let's insert
02:41 - Bob that's the quotes around your um
02:44 - text values your string
02:46 - values so we'll insert that and we'll do
02:49 - a select star from users
02:53 - select star from
02:56 - users and we can see that we've inserted
02:58 - Bob and even though we we didn't specify
03:00 - an ID this time and even though it's a
03:02 - primary key so it has to have a value we
03:05 - can see that because it's autoincrement
03:06 - it's automatically assign Bob the value
03:09 - of one and of course if you insert
03:12 - another value let's insert another one
03:15 - then it's going to go to two as you
03:17 - might
03:18 - expect so let's take a look here and now
03:22 - it's two uh now my SQL won't allow zero
03:26 - in an autoincrement column so let's take
03:29 - a look at that uh supposing we do
03:31 - specify the ID and we specify it let's
03:34 - say as three or Any number greater than
03:37 - two that's going to work and we can do
03:41 - the select now and we see that the ID
03:44 - value of three which we have specified
03:46 - for this Auto inrent column now it my
03:49 - SQL will accept that just fine it's
03:51 - going to accept any valid value here
03:53 - which is going to be anything other than
03:55 - zero or some value that we've already
03:57 - got in this column or some value that's
04:00 - too big to fit in there which would be a
04:02 - really big number but if we um if we try
04:05 - to insert zero we get different results
04:09 - now um this depends on your settings I'm
04:12 - pretty sure that in the past I've tried
04:14 - to do this and it just hasn't run the
04:16 - query so I'm sure that's configurable
04:19 - but if we just run this now and we do a
04:21 - select on it with the settings that I've
04:23 - got here which is pretty much the yeah
04:26 - it's just the outof thee boox settings
04:29 - that it came with
04:30 - what happens is if you specify zero for
04:32 - an autoincrement column as we just did
04:36 - just right here then um it just kind of
04:39 - ignores the zero and it proceeds as
04:42 - though you hadn't specified any value
04:44 - for it so it will give us give it the
04:46 - next available ID in the
04:49 - sequence okay so that's it for this
04:50 - tutorial have a go yourself create a
04:52 - table with a primary key if you want to
04:55 - that is try inserting into it and also
04:58 - see what happens if if you try to insert
05:00 - zero on your your system maybe it won't
05:03 - run the query or maybe it will just
05:05 - ignore it and insert an auto incremented
05:07 - value in any case so until next time
05:10 - happy coding

hello this is John from kof programming do.com in this tutorial we're going to take a look at Auto incrementing primary keys so I'm going to drop my users table again get rid of it and uh I've got to actually write drop table users in there and now I'm going to recreate the table similar to what we had before so what we had before was something like this create table users and the columns are ID int which is the primary key we've got name text and email text but actually for the purposes of this tutorial let's just let's just have a name in there because it'll save a little bit of time um so um the the the only sort of problem with this uh which is a sort of problem is that the ID field here um we have to invent a unique value for it now sometimes that's what you want sometimes you're running some software or something and you naturally get an ID uh when a user creates a a new account let's say on your system and you want to insert that ID into the database and uh there are ways of of course of doing queries and checking that the new idea is unique this sort of thing but sometimes it's nice if you can just get my SQL to invent an ID for you and you can do that by making the primary key autoincrement so let's let's drop this users table again I'm going to go back to the stuff that I just typed and I'm going to after primary key so before the comma I'm going to type Auto uncore increment so this is a very MySQL specific keyword and what it does is it means that you can do inserts without specifying an ID and the ID that will be assigned to each row will just be incremented or increased from whatever the last value that was used was and it's going to start at one so let's create that table now and we'll say insert into users and now I won't specify an ID so I'll just specify the one column we've got now which is at the moment it's just the name column and we'll say values and by the way I did a bit of checking and apparently um although I've always mixed double and single quotes except where I was using a database that really wouldn't accept one one or the other apparent single quotes are considered a kind of default standard thing to use in SQL but my sqls seems to be just fine with double quotes anyway let's insert something into there let's insert Bob that's the quotes around your um text values your string values so we'll insert that and we'll do a select star from users select star from users and we can see that we've inserted Bob and even though we we didn't specify an ID this time and even though it's a primary key so it has to have a value we can see that because it's autoincrement it's automatically assign Bob the value of one and of course if you insert another value let's insert another one then it's going to go to two as you might expect so let's take a look here and now it's two uh now my SQL won't allow zero in an autoincrement column so let's take a look at that uh supposing we do specify the ID and we specify it let's say as three or Any number greater than two that's going to work and we can do the select now and we see that the ID value of three which we have specified for this Auto inrent column now it my SQL will accept that just fine it's going to accept any valid value here which is going to be anything other than zero or some value that we've already got in this column or some value that's too big to fit in there which would be a really big number but if we um if we try to insert zero we get different results now um this depends on your settings I'm pretty sure that in the past I've tried to do this and it just hasn't run the query so I'm sure that's configurable but if we just run this now and we do a select on it with the settings that I've got here which is pretty much the yeah it's just the outof thee boox settings that it came with what happens is if you specify zero for an autoincrement column as we just did just right here then um it just kind of ignores the zero and it proceeds as though you hadn't specified any value for it so it will give us give it the next available ID in the sequence okay so that's it for this tutorial have a go yourself create a table with a primary key if you want to that is try inserting into it and also see what happens if if you try to insert zero on your your system maybe it won't run the query or maybe it will just ignore it and insert an auto incremented value in any case so until next time happy coding
