00:00 - hello this is John from cave of
00:02 - programming calm in this tutorial we're
00:05 - going to look at a my sequel setting
00:07 - that effects how inserts are allowed to
00:10 - run when the insert is trying to insert
00:13 - into a table with not null volumes so
00:17 - we're going to look at another useful
00:18 - setting option to know about and in this
00:21 - course we're probably going to see at
00:23 - least one more very useful my sequel
00:26 - specific setting that you should know
00:29 - about so there's this setting called
00:33 - sequel mode and settings in my sequel in
00:38 - general can have global and local values
00:41 - so let's take a look at what that
00:44 - actually means and to start with I'm
00:46 - going to say select and this this
00:49 - following syntax is very very specific
00:51 - to my sequel so it's not a general
00:54 - sequel thing but I'm going to type to
00:56 - kind of add signs and let's put in here
01:03 - global dot sequel underscore mode so if
01:10 - we take a look at the value of this we
01:11 - see it set to strict all tables so if
01:15 - you want to read about what this
01:16 - actually does and I will explain in just
01:19 - a moment excuse me
01:21 - then we can search let's say in google
01:24 - for my sequel sequel underscore mode and
01:28 - in the first document that's linked to
01:32 - here you get there my sequel
01:34 - documentation page and there you can see
01:37 - various ways of setting the sequel mode
01:39 - and you can see the most important
01:42 - sequel modes and just general various
01:45 - things you can set it to you can also
01:47 - see how to set it how to set this value
01:50 - in your configuration file to set it
01:53 - sort of permanently so we'll take a look
01:58 - at what this actually does in a minute
01:59 - and we'll see that it can affect how our
02:01 - queries run but I also want to mention
02:04 - that there is also a session sequel mode
02:07 - so let's take a look at that and I
02:10 - appreciate that it is going to
02:12 - a bit cryptic at the moment but all will
02:14 - become hopefully clear shortly so let's
02:17 - say 2 up signs and a session sequel mode
02:22 - so we can run this select statement with
02:25 - multiple values as long as they're
02:26 - separated by commas and if we run this
02:29 - we find that my global and sequel global
02:36 - and session sequel modes are actually
02:38 - set to different values and that's just
02:41 - because I've been playing around with it
02:43 - a bit so when I when I installed my
02:46 - sequel the default for both of them was
02:48 - no engine substitution now the global
02:54 - version of any setting in general that's
02:57 - that's going to set the value for any
02:59 - connection that's made to the server so
03:03 - if someone else connected to the server
03:05 - or you you ran an app that also
03:07 - connected to the server in addition to
03:09 - this my sequel workbench if you've set
03:11 - the global mode that's going to affect
03:14 - these other connections as well whereas
03:17 - if you set the session mode that's only
03:19 - going to affect this particular session
03:20 - in other words it's going to affect this
03:22 - connection that you've made now and if
03:24 - you drop the connection in the workbench
03:26 - and start it again then the session
03:29 - sequel mode is going to default back to
03:31 - the global sequel mode so there's
03:33 - sessions here but are also global values
03:36 - that you can step for any connection
03:38 - that's made your server if you restart
03:41 - the server you're going to lose both of
03:42 - these and they're going to default
03:44 - either to the default values or to
03:46 - whatever you set in the config file so
03:49 - if you want to set a variable like one
03:51 - of these permanently you need to set
03:54 - high in the config file so this will be
03:56 - sequel mode equals such-and-such so what
04:00 - actually are these values so the session
04:03 - sequel mode is the one that's it's
04:05 - actually going to affect this session
04:07 - and I've got it set to no engine
04:08 - substitution which was the default when
04:11 - I run my sequel now according to the
04:13 - documentation what this value actually
04:16 - does no engine substitution is that if
04:19 - you specify when you create the table if
04:21 - you specify an engine
04:23 - we saw in the last tutorial but you
04:25 - misspelled the engine or something or
04:27 - you specify an engine that's not
04:28 - available then if this variable is not
04:33 - set my sequel is going to substitute
04:36 - some available engine whatever the
04:38 - default engine is set to for that
04:41 - misspelled unavailable engine if this is
04:44 - if this is set it's not going to do that
04:47 - so if you specify an engine that doesn't
04:49 - exist then it's not going to substitute
04:52 - it with some default value so if we do
04:54 - for example crate let's get rid of this
04:57 - asset grades table test long ID int
05:03 - engine equals some gobbledygook if no
05:09 - engine substitution is set then it's not
05:12 - going to execute that query now the one
05:17 - what we're really interested in here is
05:19 - setting a mode called strict or tables
05:23 - and let's see what effect that actually
05:25 - has so if I I've got less let's go to
05:30 - use tutorial one I'm already using this
05:32 - database we're just want to show you
05:34 - from beginning case case it's confusing
05:36 - one out so we're gonna say use the
05:38 - tutorial one database
05:39 - I'm gonna say show tables these are
05:41 - commands that I do use a lot and we see
05:43 - regardless users table in here I don't
05:45 - actually need this test table so I'm
05:48 - just gonna do drop table test while I
05:52 - think about it and now if we do show
05:56 - tables the test table will have
06:00 - disappeared we just got users let's do
06:02 - desk users and we can see that we
06:06 - created this table so that both of the
06:08 - fields can't be null now with the
06:13 - default setting at least the default
06:14 - setting I got when I installed my sequel
06:17 - out-of-the-box and that this is
06:19 - something that you should try for
06:20 - yourself if we do insert into users and
06:24 - set into our table we only specify one
06:26 - column in there so we don't specify all
06:30 - of the columns that are not null
06:33 - now we say values let's specify for this
06:38 - just nine or something and we run this
06:41 - and we look at a query it has actually
06:43 - run but with a warning and so if we do
06:47 - select star from users we see that we've
06:51 - inserted that row and my sequel has
06:54 - inserted a default value for username
06:56 - which for a string type a text type is
06:59 - an empty blank string so it's not know
07:02 - but my sequel has made up a value for it
07:05 - which is the default value now that may
07:08 - be the behavior you want and in this
07:10 - tutorial I'm going to just carry on like
07:12 - that I'm gonna stick with this option
07:14 - because I want to try to use the
07:16 - settings that you most likely got out of
07:18 - the box and this is how my version of my
07:22 - sequel came to me when I just installed
07:24 - it this time around but sometimes you
07:28 - might want to change that you might want
07:29 - to say okay if I've got not null values
07:32 - in my table values that can't be no if
07:35 - someone tries to do an insert on that
07:37 - table and they don't specify your value
07:39 - for the nominal columns for all of the
07:42 - Naughton or columns then the query
07:46 - should fail you might want to say that
07:47 - rather than let my sequel make up a
07:51 - default value for it and if you want to
07:53 - do that you can change the sequel mode
07:54 - so we could do for example set let's say
07:59 - global set well--that's sessions may be
08:03 - the most useful let's say set session
08:06 - sequel mode equals and we could set it
08:10 - to some value in here and you can see
08:16 - the most important values in the my
08:18 - sequel document but an easy way to do
08:23 - this we've set both the local and global
08:25 - values of a setting at the same time in
08:28 - this case the sequel mode setting is
08:30 - just to say set sequel on the school
08:33 - node equals and I'm going to set this to
08:35 - I set it to strict
08:39 - or tables I'm using single quotes here
08:43 - but in sequel it doesn't matter so that
08:46 - I could just use double quotes and
08:48 - should be fine let's run this and we see
08:51 - that the query I don't like not so much
08:53 - a query but a statement ran successfully
08:55 - and now let's do select in fact I'll
08:59 - just bring up this query that I used
09:02 - previously so we'll look at the global
09:04 - and session values of this sequel note
09:08 - variable and we see they've both been
09:10 - set to strict or strict or tables if I
09:13 - now try to insert into a table and I
09:16 - don't specify a value for one or more of
09:19 - the columns that are not allowed to be
09:22 - null let's try this with the value 10
09:24 - for ID and I won't give a value for
09:27 - username which is not null let's run
09:29 - this now we see that it gives an error
09:31 - and although errors don't seem like a
09:34 - good thing sometimes that's what you
09:36 - want if you have a program that's
09:38 - executing sequel statements it can be
09:42 - really bad if they run silently but they
09:44 - and they appear to succeed but they
09:45 - don't actually do what you want so if
09:48 - you run a sequel statement in your
09:49 - program it's good practice to check
09:51 - somehow that that hasn't run and created
09:55 - an error and the same applies kind of if
09:58 - you run a sequel statement by hand like
10:02 - we're doing here sometimes it can fail
10:05 - silently you think it's work but it
10:07 - hasn't actually done what you want so
10:09 - sometimes you want to make sure that
10:10 - queries fail when you do something that
10:14 - you don't really want them to do and by
10:17 - setting this equal mode variable we've
10:19 - made sure that we have to specify values
10:22 - for all the fields that are specified as
10:25 - not null in our table so it's worth
10:30 - having a go at this yourself take a look
10:32 - at your global and local session modes
10:36 - like this see what they're set to they
10:39 - should be set to the default to both the
10:42 - same thing you know unless you change
10:44 - one of them they should be set to both
10:45 - the same thing
10:46 - and you you might want to try changing
10:52 - sequel mode as I just did so that's this
10:55 - one too strict or tables and then try to
11:00 - insert into a table as I just did not
11:04 - specifying a value for it and not not
11:07 - column and check that it it does fail if
11:09 - you set strict or tables but I'm gonna
11:12 - set this back to no engine substitution
11:17 - for the purpose that this purposes of
11:19 - this tutorial
11:20 - although really if I was running some
11:22 - sort of production database that
11:24 - actually really mattered I probably
11:26 - would like to turn strict or tables on
11:29 - just to give me a bit of extra sort of
11:32 - error checking and also if you just stop
11:36 - your server and restart it then you'll
11:37 - get whatever default values are
11:39 - specified in your configuration file and
11:42 - a couple of little things I just want to
11:44 - mention one thing is that if you didn't
11:46 - find a configuration file in your my
11:48 - sequel directory install directory at
11:52 - all I should have mentioned this in the
11:54 - last tutorial really you can just Google
11:56 - for like a default one on the internet
11:59 - and just copy that or even just write it
12:02 - out yourself just Google for what should
12:04 - be in a typical my sequel configuration
12:07 - file remember you have to put it in the
12:10 - right location if you actually want to
12:12 - use it and you have to restart your
12:13 - server but my download of my sequel did
12:17 - include a dummy sort of default
12:22 - configuration file my dot CNF or it
12:25 - could be my top any on Windows it's just
12:27 - that it wasn't in the right place and
12:28 - also with queries in general because I
12:32 - use different databases from time to
12:35 - time even though I've been using my
12:37 - sequel for a very long time I can still
12:40 - get confused because sequel syntax does
12:42 - vary between different databases and
12:44 - also if you don't if you don't use a
12:46 - particular database for a few months
12:48 - things can start to get confused in your
12:51 - mind and you forget the exact database
12:54 - the syntax for sequel queries so one
12:57 - good place to look is certainly the my
13:01 - sequel documentation but often this is
13:04 - sort of a little bit cryptic and often
13:07 - it's easier just to do something like my
13:09 - sequel select query query example so if
13:16 - you forget for example how to do a
13:18 - select query then you can pretty easily
13:21 - find just examples of what that actually
13:24 - looks like that concrete examples and
13:26 - that's sometimes better than looking at
13:28 - the documentation okay we'll leave it
13:31 - there for this tutorial do have a go at
13:33 - selling strict tool tables and see what
13:35 - effect that has for you on your system
13:37 - and check what mode you're currently
13:40 - using as well so until next time happy
13:42 - coding

Cleaned transcript:

hello this is John from cave of programming calm in this tutorial we're going to look at a my sequel setting that effects how inserts are allowed to run when the insert is trying to insert into a table with not null volumes so we're going to look at another useful setting option to know about and in this course we're probably going to see at least one more very useful my sequel specific setting that you should know about so there's this setting called sequel mode and settings in my sequel in general can have global and local values so let's take a look at what that actually means and to start with I'm going to say select and this this following syntax is very very specific to my sequel so it's not a general sequel thing but I'm going to type to kind of add signs and let's put in here global dot sequel underscore mode so if we take a look at the value of this we see it set to strict all tables so if you want to read about what this actually does and I will explain in just a moment excuse me then we can search let's say in google for my sequel sequel underscore mode and in the first document that's linked to here you get there my sequel documentation page and there you can see various ways of setting the sequel mode and you can see the most important sequel modes and just general various things you can set it to you can also see how to set it how to set this value in your configuration file to set it sort of permanently so we'll take a look at what this actually does in a minute and we'll see that it can affect how our queries run but I also want to mention that there is also a session sequel mode so let's take a look at that and I appreciate that it is going to a bit cryptic at the moment but all will become hopefully clear shortly so let's say 2 up signs and a session sequel mode so we can run this select statement with multiple values as long as they're separated by commas and if we run this we find that my global and sequel global and session sequel modes are actually set to different values and that's just because I've been playing around with it a bit so when I when I installed my sequel the default for both of them was no engine substitution now the global version of any setting in general that's that's going to set the value for any connection that's made to the server so if someone else connected to the server or you you ran an app that also connected to the server in addition to this my sequel workbench if you've set the global mode that's going to affect these other connections as well whereas if you set the session mode that's only going to affect this particular session in other words it's going to affect this connection that you've made now and if you drop the connection in the workbench and start it again then the session sequel mode is going to default back to the global sequel mode so there's sessions here but are also global values that you can step for any connection that's made your server if you restart the server you're going to lose both of these and they're going to default either to the default values or to whatever you set in the config file so if you want to set a variable like one of these permanently you need to set high in the config file so this will be sequel mode equals suchandsuch so what actually are these values so the session sequel mode is the one that's it's actually going to affect this session and I've got it set to no engine substitution which was the default when I run my sequel now according to the documentation what this value actually does no engine substitution is that if you specify when you create the table if you specify an engine we saw in the last tutorial but you misspelled the engine or something or you specify an engine that's not available then if this variable is not set my sequel is going to substitute some available engine whatever the default engine is set to for that misspelled unavailable engine if this is if this is set it's not going to do that so if you specify an engine that doesn't exist then it's not going to substitute it with some default value so if we do for example crate let's get rid of this asset grades table test long ID int engine equals some gobbledygook if no engine substitution is set then it's not going to execute that query now the one what we're really interested in here is setting a mode called strict or tables and let's see what effect that actually has so if I I've got less let's go to use tutorial one I'm already using this database we're just want to show you from beginning case

need this test table so I'm just gonna do drop table test while I think about it and now if we do show tables the test table will have disappeared we just got users let's do desk users and we can see

I don't like not so much a query but a statement ran successfully and now let's do select in fact I'll just bring up this query that I used previously so we'll look at the global and session values of this sequel note variable and we see they've both been set to strict or strict or tables if I now try to insert into a table and I don't specify a value for one or more of the columns that are not allowed to be null let's try this with the value 10 for ID and I won't give a value for username which is not null let's run this now we see that it gives an error and although errors don't seem like

table so it's worth having a go at this yourself take a look at your global and local session modes like this see what they're set to they should be set to the default to both the same thing you know unless you change one of them they should be set to both the same thing and you you might want to try changing sequel mode as I just did so that's this one too strict or tables and then try to insert
