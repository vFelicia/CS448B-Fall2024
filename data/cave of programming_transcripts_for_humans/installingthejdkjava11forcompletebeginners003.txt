00:00 - hello to get started with writing Java
00:04 - programs you're gonna need two things
00:06 - you're gonna need the Java software that
00:10 - actually creates your programs and
00:12 - you're gonna need some sort of editor to
00:15 - work in so in this video we're going to
00:17 - take a look at installing the software
00:19 - that actually will take the text files
00:22 - that you're going to write in the Java
00:24 - programming language and turn them into
00:26 - actual Java programs and what you need
00:30 - is the Java standard edition as se a
00:35 - software development kit SDK so I'm
00:38 - going to search for Java SC SDK download
00:42 - in this course we're using version 11 of
00:48 - the development kit at least to start
00:50 - with so if I click on this link here
00:54 - that says Java SE development kit 11
00:57 - then we go to the oracle downloads page
01:01 - on this page you have to be sure to
01:05 - check accept license agreement and then
01:09 - you need to download the correct
01:12 - installer for your platform so I'm
01:16 - actually using mark so I would I would
01:19 - download this OSX version I'd use the
01:25 - 64-bit version so if you're using
01:28 - Windows download the windows director
01:30 - installer and you've got options for
01:32 - Linux as well so you need to download
01:35 - that and install it you probably won't
01:39 - encounter any problems as long as you
01:42 - have admin rights on your computer if
01:45 - you do encounter any strange error
01:47 - message messages or anything like that
01:48 - don't be afraid to type the error
01:51 - message out into Google or into some
01:54 - search engine and just Google the error
01:58 - message basically and find out what
02:00 - comes up because other people will have
02:03 - had the same problems but basically you
02:05 - shouldn't you shouldn't really encounter
02:06 - any problems most of the time so you
02:09 - just need to install the latest version
02:11 - of Java it
02:13 - there's a later version out by the time
02:14 - you're watching this so version 12 is
02:18 - actually already out and the reason I'm
02:19 - not planning to start off using that is
02:21 - because there are relatively minor
02:25 - changes in version 12 of Java compared
02:28 - to version 11 and it's not always the
02:34 - case that all the software you use will
02:36 - be compatible with the absolute latest
02:39 - version so it's often not a bad idea to
02:42 - hang back a little bit from upgrading
02:45 - your version of Java because otherwise
02:48 - you may run into incompatibility issues
02:50 - so I'm following a policy here in this
02:54 - course of using a fairly recent version
02:57 - at the actual time that I'm making this
03:00 - video so if you're watching this and
03:02 - version 14 is out or whatever you can
03:05 - use version 14 but I'm gonna stick with
03:08 - jar 11 at a moment even though version
03:11 - 12 is already out okay so try to install
03:15 - that get that installed and I'll see you
03:17 - in the next video
