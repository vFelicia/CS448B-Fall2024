00:16 - hello this is John from Cave of
00:19 - programming. comom this is a beginners
00:23 - tutorial for Java and we're going to be
00:27 - creating a hello world Java program in
00:32 - this which is the free Eclipse
00:34 - integrated development environment for
00:38 - Java I'm going to assume that you've
00:40 - already installed the jdk the JRE and
00:43 - Eclipse
00:45 - itself go to the workbench which is
00:48 - where we'll do our
00:50 - work appropriately enough and go to
00:55 - file new Java project and give your
00:59 - project a a name I'm going to call this
01:02 - tutorial one but you can call it
01:04 - anything you like click
01:07 - next and we can accept the defaults
01:10 - again on this screen click
01:12 - finish and now we've got this tutorial
01:16 - folder here and you can see that you've
01:19 - got the the Java system libraries
01:22 - included and you've got this empty
01:24 - Source
01:26 - folder if you right click on the the
01:29 - project folder you can then go to new
01:34 - class and we need um a class here that
01:37 - will be the only class that our hello
01:39 - world program
01:42 - contains and um I'm going to you can
01:44 - call it anything you like but I'm going
01:46 - to call it
01:49 - application and here you can
01:52 - see a box which you can tick to get
01:56 - Eclipse to create a main method for you
02:01 - that will be the the actual starting
02:04 - point of our program the entry point and
02:08 - um you need to have one of these in in
02:10 - every program that you create
02:13 - somewhere so I'll take this box just to
02:15 - save as a bit of typing and then click
02:19 - finish and now we've got our our class
02:23 - it's called
02:25 - application and we've got a main method
02:30 - standard main method which every program
02:33 - has and which will fire off your program
02:37 - code if you look at this stuff this is
02:40 - um this is just a Java comment this is
02:44 - actually formatted for the Java do pro
02:47 - program but you don't need to worry
02:48 - about that just get rid of it for the
02:51 - moment and I'll get rid of this comment
02:54 - as
02:55 - well um just by hitting the back
03:00 - key and here I'm going to type sis out
03:04 - and press control
03:06 - space and Eclipse autoc completes and
03:10 - you can see here I've got
03:12 - a print Ln method um which is Java's way
03:17 - of writing to the
03:20 - console in there I'm going to type uh
03:22 - two speech
03:25 - marks speech marks so double
03:28 - quotes what is going on with my computer
03:32 - okay there we
03:33 - go um and uh I'll just put some text in
03:37 - there hello world which is
03:41 - traditional and this this blank line
03:43 - under there I'm going to get rid of by
03:45 - selecting it and pressing contrl D which
03:48 - is a handy
03:49 - shortcut and this is a finished Java
03:53 - program and I can run it by clicking the
03:55 - Run button this green button here it
03:59 - Eclipse might ask you if you want to
04:01 - save your files and of course say yes
04:04 - and then you can see the output down
04:05 - here hello
04:08 - world if this is your first Java program
04:12 - then congratulations you are now a Java
04:16 - programmer and uh I hope you find this
04:19 - useful you can find more tutorials and
04:21 - information on Cave of programming.
04:25 - comom and until the next tutorial happy
04:28 - coding
