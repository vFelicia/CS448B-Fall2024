00:00 - the next step is now going to be to make
00:03 - sure you've got a recent version of
00:05 - python installed on your system now this
00:08 - is one step that I'm not going to give
00:10 - you explicit instructions for because it
00:13 - does vary from platform to platform I'm
00:16 - using a Mac but if you're using Windows
00:19 - you can probably install python
00:22 - just by
00:23 - opening the windows console and typing
00:26 - python
00:28 - and then you just have to click through
00:30 - to confirm the whole process
00:34 - if you're using a different platform
00:37 - then you probably will need to go to
00:40 - python.org
00:42 - and download the latest version and
00:44 - install it from here
00:47 - your aim is to get to a point where you
00:50 - can open a console on your system
00:53 - so here's the terminal program for mac
00:56 - and you can type
00:58 - some command
01:01 - that will invoke Python and hyphen
01:03 - hyphen version and it comes back with a
01:07 - reasonably recent version of python now
01:10 - you can see here
01:12 - if I do this on my Mac I get an old
01:14 - version of python
01:17 - python at the moment is up to version
01:19 - 3.11 and throughout most of this course
01:22 - I'm using python 3.10
01:26 - but if I type here Python 3 hyphen
01:29 - hyphen version
01:31 - I do get the right version of python so
01:34 - you need to be able to type some kind of
01:37 - python command you might have to even
01:39 - include a whole directory string in
01:42 - there
01:44 - and put hyphen hyphen version after it
01:46 - and you want to see that you've got the
01:49 - latest version of python running and
01:52 - installed and how you go about that will
01:54 - depend on your platform but there are
01:57 - plenty of instructions available
01:59 - so if you search for install python
02:05 - 3 let's say windows
02:08 - then you're going to find instructions
02:10 - for it pretty easily and the same for
02:12 - mac and the same for Linux
02:16 - you've just got to be able to invoke it
02:19 - like this from the console even if you
02:21 - end up having to type some long string
02:24 - to specify exactly where the python has
02:26 - installed to
02:28 - that's fine we're gonna fix that later
02:30 - but you've got to be able to run the
02:33 - latest version of python that you've
02:34 - installed
02:35 - from some kind of console on your system
02:38 - from the windows console the Mac
02:40 - terminal whatever you use on Linux and
02:44 - so on
02:48 - so I'm assuming a certain level of
02:50 - computer knowledge here to the extent
02:52 - that you need to be able to find the
02:54 - console on your system and
02:57 - figure out how to install things and so
02:59 - on but even if you're relatively new to
03:02 - using a computer which you're probably
03:03 - not you will be able to figure this out
03:06 - it's just it may take a little bit of
03:08 - persistence to get to this point and
03:11 - once you've done it I can guide you
03:13 - through most of the rest of the stuff
03:16 - that you're going to need to do this is
03:19 - a free video from my course Python and
03:22 - machine learning for complete beginners
03:24 - I'm releasing the first couple of
03:26 - chapters of this course completely for
03:29 - free on YouTube to get you started with
03:31 - python I plan to upload new videos here
03:35 - to YouTube every Monday and every
03:37 - Thursday for at least a couple of months
03:40 - if you're interested in the complete
03:43 - course which teaches you python from
03:45 - scratch and eventually progresses to
03:48 - things like creating graphical user
03:50 - interfaces and using neural networks
03:53 - principal component analysis cluster
03:56 - analysis all that stuff and much more
03:58 - besides then you can find a link in the
04:01 - description or just go to this URL on
04:04 - the screen right here if you finish the
04:06 - whole course you'll be able to write all
04:08 - kinds of general purpose programs in
04:10 - Python and use Python to do machine
04:13 - learning and artificial intelligence as
04:16 - well thank you for watching until next
04:18 - time happy coding
