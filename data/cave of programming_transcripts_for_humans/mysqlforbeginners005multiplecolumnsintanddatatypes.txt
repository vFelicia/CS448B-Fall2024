00:00 - hello this is John from cave of
00:02 - programming calm in this tutorial we're
00:04 - going to learn creating tables with
00:07 - multiple columns and we're also going to
00:09 - look at a new data type int so at the
00:13 - moment I've got a table called users if
00:15 - I do desc users we can see that table
00:19 - that's just got one column in at the
00:22 - moment one thing to note at this point
00:24 - is that if you're using the my sequel
00:26 - workbench you can click on the commands
00:28 - in this output pane right at the bottom
00:31 - right click them and go to replace
00:34 - sequel with selected items and that will
00:36 - actually override what's currently in
00:40 - the sequel pane query pane and replace
00:43 - it with that query you selected so it's
00:45 - a really useful feature if you want to
00:48 - reuse some sequel that you read that you
00:50 - executed previously and if you're using
00:53 - a command line often command lines have
00:56 - a feature where you can just press the
00:58 - up arrow to get back to previous queries
01:01 - usually a command line will give you
01:03 - some way of doing that even if you you
01:06 - have you might have to configure
01:07 - something sometimes to get it to work
01:10 - okay so let's take a look at this I'm
01:12 - going to actually drop this table in
01:14 - other words delete it I'm going to say
01:16 - drop table users and let's let's just
01:21 - check let's do a double check let's do
01:24 - show tables we can see that the users
01:26 - table is now gone so obviously you have
01:28 - to be careful with this query and I'm
01:31 - going to say create table users so we're
01:33 - going to recreate it and I'm going to
01:36 - create it with two columns I'm going to
01:38 - say ID that's going to be the name of
01:40 - the first column and I'm going to make
01:41 - it an int and an int is a numerical
01:45 - value in my sequel it can store integers
01:49 - and so not floating-point numbers you
01:51 - know with a decimal point in them just
01:53 - integer values and we'll put a comma in
01:55 - and make the second column now use the
01:58 - name Tex
02:00 - so now we've got two columns ID and
02:03 - username so in this in this statement
02:07 - here where you specify the columns at
02:09 - the table you can provide a comma
02:10 - separated list with there can be lots of
02:13 - columns in there to add multiple columns
02:15 - to your table let's execute this and
02:19 - where are we in fact if you guys
02:22 - selected that and executed it which only
02:25 - executes a part of it by one the whole
02:26 - thing so deselect that run again and yes
02:30 - it's run fine now and let's do a desk
02:33 - users so though we've got two values
02:38 - they are both allowed to be null at this
02:41 - point I'm going to look at that a bit
02:44 - more shortly let's just insert some data
02:46 - in there
02:46 - so this you can probably guess how this
02:49 - works in fact if you want to pause the
02:51 - recording pause the video and have a go
02:54 - at yourself you can probably figure it
02:56 - out let's try it say insert into users
02:59 - ID user name values and we'll put in
03:04 - let's put in one for the ID and the text
03:08 - goes in quotes the text values have to
03:11 - be in quotes and let's say username Bob
03:14 - so once again we can we can just replace
03:17 - where we previously had a single column
03:19 - we can replace it with comma separated
03:21 - list we'll run that and let's put
03:25 - another one in if it run okay which I
03:26 - see that it did
03:27 - let's put Vicki in run that and now
03:31 - let's do select star from users so we've
03:36 - got Bob and Vicki so that's it for this
03:40 - tutorial do have a go at like yourself
03:42 - you can even create tables with multiple
03:45 - columns you can have multiple pets
03:47 - columns multiple integer columns
03:48 - whatever you like and then one thing
03:51 - probably that's worth mentioning already
03:53 - at this point is if you search in Google
03:56 - or your favorite search engine for my
03:58 - sequel types you can find a list of the
04:02 - different data types that you can use
04:03 - we've seen int and text so far but
04:06 - there's a lot of different types here if
04:07 - we go to numeric types for instance and
04:10 - then we go to integer types so we can
04:12 - see that an in
04:14 - it can store integers between these two
04:17 - big values but sometimes you want
04:20 - smaller integer value it's better to use
04:22 - a smaller one if you know you're only
04:24 - going to small store small values of
04:27 - integers because that takes up less
04:29 - space in your database so you might use
04:30 - small in tinyint or conversely
04:33 - if you need a really massive integer in
04:36 - there you might want to use big int okay
04:40 - so that's it for this tutorial have a go
04:42 - to that because we're going to build on
04:43 - it in the next tutorial so until next
04:45 - time happy coding
