00:00 - by the end of this section of the course
00:02 - you'll be able to write programs like
00:04 - this one here first let me demonstrate
00:06 - the program to you so I'll run it and it
00:10 - asked me to enter my password if I enter
00:13 - the password incorrectly it says
00:15 - incorrect password and it will do that
00:18 - for a maximum of three times after which
00:21 - the program terminates and it says
00:24 - access
00:25 - denied if I enter the password
00:27 - correctly hello 1 2 3
00:31 - it says greetings Professor
00:34 - Falcon I chose this just because a long
00:36 - time ago there was a film and a book
00:39 - called war
00:40 - games and according to my memory which
00:43 - is dubious at the best of times there's
00:46 - a computer in that owned by the United
00:48 - States military and a boy hacks into it
00:52 - please don't do that and when he logs in
00:55 - successfully as a hacker it says
00:57 - greetings Professor Falcon because it's
01:00 - Professor Falcon who usually uses it and
01:02 - designed it so in the course of learning
01:05 - how this program works we're going to be
01:07 - learning about conditionals those are
01:10 - things that can execute code selectively
01:13 - depending on whether some condition is
01:15 - true or not and also Loops which enable
01:19 - us to run a block of code multiple times
01:23 - and by the end of this section of the
01:25 - course you will understand everything in
01:28 - this little program so let's set to work
01:31 - figuring out how this is put together
01:33 - hello you've been watching a free sample
01:35 - from my Python and machine learning for
01:38 - complete beginners course I'm uploading
01:40 - enough videos from the start of the
01:42 - course to get you started with python
01:44 - and machine learning the full course is
01:46 - absolutely massive if you're interested
01:48 - in it please click the link in the
01:51 - description the complete course covers
01:53 - not only basic python but also some
01:56 - fairly Advanced python even some desktop
01:59 - programming stuff and then goes on to
02:01 - machine learning and artificial
02:03 - intelligence until next time happy
02:06 - coding
