00:17 - hello this is John from kave of
00:19 - programming. comom and in this tutorial
00:22 - we're just going to look at the concept
00:24 - of encapsulation in Java and I'm also
00:28 - going to um Talk little bit about using
00:30 - the um Java API
00:33 - documentation so um if you're already
00:36 - like a fluent programming programmer in
00:38 - C++ or something you'll probably want to
00:40 - skip this tutorial but um this is for
00:43 - you if you um don't really understand
00:47 - what the point of public private and
00:49 - protected is um and that sort of thing
00:51 - so I've already covered um public
00:53 - private and protected in previous
00:55 - tutorial but actually neglected to
00:57 - mention why we even use these keywords
01:01 - and uh let's take an example here so um
01:04 - if you create a class let's call it uh
01:08 - let's call it
01:09 - plant and
01:12 - um now your class usually it's going to
01:15 - have some methods and it's going to have
01:16 - some instance
01:18 - variables and um usually your instance
01:23 - variables for example if I have a string
01:26 - name you always try to make them private
01:30 - if you can now the idea behind
01:33 - encapsulation is that you encapsulate
01:35 - the inner workings of that class within
01:38 - the class in other words you stop people
01:41 - outside the class um getting at the kind
01:44 - of guts of that class and you just
01:47 - expose a kind of public API just some
01:50 - certain methods for people to use
01:53 - outside the class so if you've got um a
01:55 - string name um if you just want to use
01:58 - this in a class that's fine
02:00 - and if you want to use it U if you want
02:02 - to let people set it or get to it from
02:05 - outside the class then we use the gets
02:08 - and Setters that you declared that we
02:10 - saw in a previous
02:12 - tutorial um gets and Setters are methods
02:14 - that let you access this otherwise
02:18 - private data and of course you can
02:19 - create those by right clicking going to
02:22 - Source override Implement methods oh
02:25 - sorry no that's the wrong one um and
02:27 - this this again we covered in a previous
02:29 - tutorial but I go to Source uh generate
02:32 - gets and Setters and just tip the thing
02:35 - that I want to generate gets and sets
02:37 - for here we've generated public methods
02:41 - so these public methods can be used from
02:43 - outside the class as we saw in the
02:45 - tutorial on public private and protected
02:48 - um and the idea is um I could change
02:50 - this now if I wanted to and as long as
02:53 - these methods didn't change then anyone
02:56 - who uses this class wouldn't have to
02:58 - worry about the fact that the inner
03:00 - workings of class have changed and
03:02 - that's um a large part of the point of
03:06 - encapsulation um so um if you um now
03:10 - sometimes you you do make um the kind of
03:15 - class data members uh public but usually
03:19 - in that case it's only when they are
03:21 - final so you say like public and usually
03:24 - they static as well public static
03:26 - final um like um we could call this I
03:30 - don't know like a ID or something equals
03:33 - 7 so final means that um this can't be
03:37 - changed and uh let's make this a int
03:41 - there we go so if you do expose a um
03:46 - instance variable um well this isn't
03:49 - instance variable actually this is the
03:51 - class variable it's static then usually
03:54 - that's just cuz it's a constant and you
03:56 - just want to be able to say plant. ID
03:58 - but you can't change it from outside the
04:02 - class um and uh if you have a method
04:06 - that's just used by the class itself
04:07 - let's say you have some
04:09 - public um get data method for example
04:15 - and that gets you data about your plant
04:18 - maybe it returns who knows could return
04:20 - a string or some complex some object of
04:23 - some complex class or
04:25 - something um then um if suppose this
04:29 - uses um some kind of method that's only
04:33 - used by the class internally like it
04:35 - could we could have a um a
04:39 - public um int um get no actually maybe
04:45 - let's say
04:46 - calculate uh
04:48 - growth growth forecast something like
04:51 - that so the idea is that this is not
04:53 - intended to be used outside the class
04:56 - it's just um within the class I'll just
04:59 - return nine for the moment to return
05:01 - something um in that case I want to make
05:04 - this private again I want to encapsulate
05:06 - it prevent people using it from outside
05:09 - and here I could say just to just to
05:11 - complete this string uh data equals some
05:16 - some stuff and plus let's say calculate
05:21 - growth
05:23 - forecast so um and let's just return
05:27 - that now the idea is is that um you want
05:32 - to make everything you can private if
05:35 - you can make it private make it private
05:38 - if it needs to be accessible in a child
05:40 - class then make it protected and finally
05:44 - um the stuff that you actually want your
05:46 - end user to be able to use um make that
05:50 - public but try not to make any um data
05:53 - public except for constants so make
05:56 - everything as private as you can keep
05:57 - everything hidden within the class
06:00 - um and the idea is to reduce um one of
06:02 - another part of the idea is to reduce
06:04 - cross linkages in your um project so you
06:07 - don't want one class kind of getting
06:09 - into another class's stuff and using it
06:12 - and you don't you want to avoid creating
06:14 - a kind of Tangled Rat's Nest you just
06:16 - want to have a few methods that are
06:18 - defined public um and that are clearly
06:21 - documented and that don't change um very
06:25 - often and the rest of the stuff should
06:27 - be kept within the class so that's the
06:29 - idea behind
06:31 - encapsulation uh and as I say the
06:33 - advantages are that you um you hide away
06:36 - the implementation details within your
06:38 - class and just provide a public API
06:41 - application programming interface in
06:43 - other words just some public methods and
06:45 - you also reduce you also prevent classes
06:48 - being tightly coupled which means uh two
06:51 - classes are tightly coupled if they're
06:52 - calling each other stuff all the time
06:54 - and you want to you don't want that at
06:56 - all because you'll just create a
06:57 - horrible tangle
06:59 - uh so um I I hope that helps and I'm
07:02 - just going to show you an example of
07:03 - that now by kind of looking at um the
07:06 - Java API so let's say you want some
07:08 - documentation on a standard Java class
07:11 - if you go to Google um and you say um
07:16 - let's say I want the documentation for
07:18 - the string class I could type Java 7
07:21 - which at the moment is the latest
07:23 - version of java and string and hit
07:26 - return and I can go to the first link
07:29 - here
07:30 - and here's the API page and there's the
07:32 - name of the class there's the package
07:34 - that it's in this shows you um the
07:38 - parent object of string which in this
07:40 - case is it's just got one parent um
07:43 - object and I can click on that if I want
07:45 - to see the documentation for object here
07:47 - are all the interfaces that the string
07:50 - class
07:51 - implements and underneath that we see
07:54 - some information about the class and
07:57 - often you see here examples of using it
07:59 - which is great and then when you go down
08:02 - now these are all the public fields and
08:04 - you'll notice there's only one bit of
08:07 - public data so this is like um this is a
08:11 - um like a class variable like um like
08:14 - this thing here and you'll notice
08:17 - there's as few of them as possible just
08:18 - one in the case of string and it's in
08:21 - uppercase which indicates by convention
08:24 - that it's final so if I click on that
08:26 - and I go to the full documentation you
08:28 - can see it's declared as public static
08:30 - final so you call it via the string
08:32 - class you'd say string. case and
08:35 - sensitive order and it's final meaning
08:37 - it can't be changed and you you only
08:40 - have if possible you only expose your um
08:44 - your um class variables if they are
08:48 - final and they're constant now
08:50 - underneath of that we've got all the
08:52 - different Constructors that a string has
08:55 - um and you can use the different
08:57 - Constructors by saying new and then
08:59 - supplying different kinds of parameters
09:01 - in Brackets and that will call up the
09:03 - appropriate Constructor for those
09:05 - parameters and then later on we've got
09:07 - the method summary here and um these
09:10 - methods here um they're not like all the
09:14 - methods that you have in the in the
09:18 - string
09:19 - class um in fact um these I think I
09:25 - think I'm right in saying that these are
09:26 - all the um public methods just take a
09:29 - look at one so um this declared public
09:33 - and the point is that okay string might
09:34 - use all kinds of protective private
09:37 - methods internally uh actually I think
09:39 - string doesn't have any protective
09:41 - methods but I'm sure it has private
09:43 - methods but when you look at the API the
09:46 - application programming interface
09:49 - document you um you don't you don't want
09:52 - to know about the private methods um
09:54 - because you can't use them and you
09:56 - shouldn't try to use them you want to
09:58 - know about the methods declared public
10:01 - because that is the public interface of
10:03 - the class it's the stuff that is
10:05 - designed for public consumption and
10:07 - that's s these methods here the methods
10:09 - that you can actually use um outside of
10:12 - the string
10:13 - class and we can also see here some
10:16 - methods inherited from the parent
10:17 - classes this is one parent class in this
10:20 - case and uh if you click on any one of
10:23 - those it will jump down to like the more
10:26 - detailed
10:27 - information um about about this and
10:29 - there's also you know references to
10:31 - other stuff that you might want to know
10:32 - about so that's just a brief
10:35 - introduction to encapsulation which is
10:37 - really a pretty simple idea and to the
10:39 - API um documentation in Java I hope that
10:42 - helps and in the next tutorial we're
10:46 - probably going to look at um casting
10:49 - numerical types and then we're going to
10:51 - go on to look at upcasting downcasting
10:53 - and then probably that
10:55 - generics so uh join me again next time
10:58 - and by tell time

Cleaned transcript:

hello this is John from kave of programming. comom and in this tutorial we're just going to look at the concept of encapsulation in Java and I'm also going to um Talk little bit about using the um Java API documentation so um if you're already like a fluent programming programmer in C++ or something you'll probably want to skip this tutorial but um this is for you if you um don't really understand what the point of public private and protected is um and that sort of thing so I've already covered um public private and protected in previous tutorial but actually neglected to mention why we even use these keywords and uh let's take an example here so um if you create a class let's call it uh let's call it plant and um now your class usually it's going to have some methods and it's going to have some instance variables and um usually your instance variables for example if I have a string name you always try to make them private if you can now the idea behind encapsulation is that you encapsulate the inner workings of that class within the class in other words you stop people outside the class um getting at the kind of guts of that class and you just expose a kind of public API just some certain methods for people to use outside the class so if you've got um a string name um if you just want to use this in a class that's fine and if you want to use it U if you want to let people set it or get to it from outside the class then we use the gets and Setters that you declared that we saw in a previous tutorial um gets and Setters are methods that let you access this otherwise private data and of course you can create those by right clicking going to Source override Implement methods oh sorry no that's the wrong one um and this this again we covered in a previous tutorial but I go to Source uh generate gets and Setters and just tip the thing that I want to generate gets and sets for here we've generated public methods so these public methods can be used from outside the class as we saw in the tutorial on public private and protected um and the idea is um I could change this now if I wanted to and as long as these methods didn't change then anyone who uses this class wouldn't have to worry about the fact that the inner workings of class have changed and that's um a large part of the point of encapsulation um so um if you um now sometimes you you do make um the kind of class data members uh public but usually in that case it's only when they are final so you say like public and usually they static as well public static final um like um we could call this I don't know like a ID or something equals 7 so final means that um this can't be changed and uh let's make this a int there we go so if you do expose a um instance variable um well this isn't instance variable actually this is the class variable it's static then usually that's just cuz it's a constant and you just want to be able to say plant. ID but you can't change it from outside the class um and uh if you have a method that's just used by the class itself let's say you have some public um get data method for example and that gets you data about your plant maybe it returns who knows could return a string or some complex some object of some complex class or something um then um if suppose this uses um some kind of method that's only used by the class internally like it could we could have a um a public um int um get no actually maybe let's say calculate uh growth growth forecast something like that so the idea is that this is not intended to be used outside the class it's just um within the class I'll just return nine for the moment to return something um in that case I want to make this private again I want to encapsulate it prevent people using it from outside and here I could say just to just to complete this string uh data equals some some stuff and plus let's say calculate growth forecast so um and let's just return
