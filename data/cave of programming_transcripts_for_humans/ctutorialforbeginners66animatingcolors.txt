00:16 - hello this is John from cave of
00:20 - programming calm in this tutorial we're
00:22 - going to take a look at animating colors
00:25 - the reason that I want to do this here
00:28 - is because of moment we've got a nice
00:30 - block of purple on our screen and we've
00:34 - put together all the essential elements
00:37 - for rapidly updating the screen we've
00:40 - got a loop that that can do that and
00:42 - it's I want to change the colors of the
00:46 - pixels as we go along so we're going to
00:49 - end up with some particles kind of
00:52 - bouncing around the screen which are
00:55 - gonna slowly change color but it's a lot
00:58 - easier to see the color of an entire
01:01 - block than it is of an individual pixel
01:03 - so for that reason I thought well we've
01:06 - got a block of color on the screen let's
01:08 - take a look at sorting out there the
01:11 - color change that were ultimately going
01:13 - to apply to our particles so the moment
01:17 - we've got a purple screen with a single
01:19 - white pixel right in the center there if
01:22 - you can see it so I'm gonna get rid of
01:25 - that white pixel delete that and I'm
01:29 - gonna work on changing these colors that
01:32 - we fill the entire screen with so to do
01:36 - this let's let's pick one color to start
01:38 - with let's maybe animate say green so
01:43 - it's let's set green 2 to 5 5 and set
01:45 - that you red and blue to zero for the
01:48 - moment and just chapter that looks okay
01:54 - and why don't what actually want to do
01:57 - is change the colors smoothly now that
02:01 - the the ideal thing to do here will be
02:03 - to look up an algorithm for mapping RGB
02:07 - red green blue colors to something like
02:10 - HSL hue saturation lightness the hue is
02:14 - the particular shade of color red or
02:18 - green or whatever and if we had an
02:21 - algorithm that could take a number and
02:25 - into a hue we can cycle through all
02:27 - possible hues and see all the colors of
02:29 - the rainbow but since that algorithm
02:31 - will be quite long and involved I'm
02:33 - going to take a shortcut here I'm gonna
02:35 - animate all three colors I'm gonna make
02:38 - them smoothly wax and wane I grow and
02:43 - fade and I'm gonna make them all three
02:46 - colors do that out of synchronization
02:49 - with each other so that we end up with a
02:51 - range of different combinations so to
02:54 - start with that the challenge is just to
02:56 - smoothly animate one color make it wax
03:00 - and wane make it gradually increase to
03:03 - maximum intensity and then slowly
03:05 - decrease to minimum and to cycle through
03:08 - that so to do that I'm gonna use the
03:12 - trigonometric function I'm gonna use
03:14 - sine so to use the sine function you
03:19 - need to include math by age up here
03:21 - which is maybe already included in STL
03:24 - but I'll include it explicitly it's
03:27 - possible that this might just be called
03:28 - math on your system or - master age a
03:31 - lot of these dates or fixes were dropped
03:34 - from standard had a slight bias stream
03:38 - for example there's still header files
03:40 - but the dyed suffix was was dropped to
03:44 - make it look nicer basically at some
03:47 - point you might need to include using
03:49 - namespace standard as well to use
03:52 - functions from master H now sign I'm not
03:57 - going to get into the details of
03:59 - trigonometry but we can think of sine as
04:01 - a function which takes a number and it
04:06 - Maps that number in other words it
04:08 - returns a number in the range minus 1 to
04:11 - plus 1 so if we supply sine with an ever
04:15 - increasing number it will return to us a
04:19 - value in a range minus 1 to plus 1 and
04:23 - if I'll you that it returns as we
04:25 - increase the argument that we supply to
04:27 - it will smoothly bounce up and down
04:31 - between minus 1 and plus ones there are
04:33 - no abrupt changes that
04:37 - so what what we want is to supply sign
04:39 - with some volume that increases as the
04:41 - program continues to run and to do that
04:45 - we can use a function called STL
04:49 - underscore get tix and this returns the
04:53 - number of milliseconds since the program
04:54 - started so let's say int elapsed equals
05:02 - STL get tix I'm going to supply that
05:07 - value to my sine function and sine is
05:10 - gonna return a value let's call this
05:15 - green between minus 1 and plus 1 so we
05:20 - could just start plot that and for the
05:22 - moment just to see what it looks like so
05:28 - if I if I run this now and don't just
05:32 - let it run for a bit and then quit it in
05:35 - a console here oh yes we're seeing
05:37 - zeroes because I forgot of course that
05:39 - the return value is a doubles no use
05:41 - using an empath let's try this again so
05:45 - I run this let it run for a bit quit it
05:48 - and then we can see that every time the
05:51 - loop is executed we've supplied a an
05:54 - increased volume to sign the number of
05:57 - milliseconds since the program started
05:59 - running and sign has returned here a
06:02 - value in the range of minus 1 to +1
06:04 - which it's not easy to see here because
06:06 - quite a lot of milliseconds are passing
06:08 - in between each iteration of this loop
06:11 - but it does actually arrange smoothly
06:15 - between minus 1 and plus 1 it changes
06:18 - gradually maybe we can see and maybe we
06:23 - can slow down the change if we multiply
06:26 - elapsed by some small number here
06:29 - because here were jumping quite a lot
06:31 - like from minus not goodnight up all the
06:34 - way up to nor Polly 3 which is not a
06:36 - smooth change because because we're
06:39 - supplying a much bigger value to sign
06:43 - from one iteration of the loop to the
06:46 - next so a lot of milliseconds
06:49 - passes between one iteration of this
06:52 - loop and the next iteration let's
06:54 - multiply it ups by some small number
06:56 - like naught point naught naught 1 and
06:59 - see what we've got then and see if the
07:01 - return value is appearing to change any
07:04 - smoother so this looks a lot better now
07:07 - we can see we can see that it is a
07:09 - smooth change
07:11 - we've got point naught point nine five
07:14 - then point nine five well it's point
07:16 - nine five put nine six basically at
07:19 - point nine five point nine four point
07:22 - nine three nine point nine three five so
07:25 - you see this this file is smoothly
07:26 - changing it and it will bounce up and
07:28 - down between the minimum and maximum
07:31 - value minus one and plus one what we
07:33 - wanted to do is bounce up and down
07:35 - between the minimum and maximum possible
07:37 - values of green which will be naught and
07:40 - 255 in decimal so first of all if we add
07:44 - one to sign that will give us a value in
07:47 - the range not too let's let's run this
07:50 - again put it take a look so now I values
07:56 - range from naught all the way up to - we
07:58 - haven't got many values here and but it
08:01 - will in fact range from north up to two
08:04 - now if we take that and multiply it by
08:08 - half of the maximum value that we want
08:10 - it to reach and off of we cut one half
08:14 - of off of 255 I guess will be one
08:17 - hundred and twenty seven point five but
08:20 - lets us maybe multiply it by one to
08:22 - eight and see what that looks like so if
08:26 - I run this just sort of leave it for a
08:30 - bit and then quit and take a look so now
08:36 - hopefully the maximum value of this will
08:38 - be 255 point something so to actually
08:44 - get the value to point nor from sign
08:45 - would have to supply it with exactly -
08:48 - exactly
08:49 - well for sign it will be exactly PI over
08:55 - two I think that's right or three times
09:00 - pi diff
09:01 - by two if I remember my trigonometry
09:03 - correctly yeah
09:05 - sine of 90 degrees is 1 so therefore I
09:11 - think I'm right in saying that well we
09:14 - could we could try that actually we
09:16 - could use we could supply this with math
09:19 - dot actually I think there's a constant
09:23 - in math core and underscore PI divide
09:28 - let's divide that by 2 see if that runs
09:31 - much if I remember this correctly so now
09:35 - if we look at that yeah we get 256 but
09:40 - if we're supplying this not with exactly
09:43 - PI over 2 pi is 3.14 1 4 1 5 9 2 etc if
09:50 - we don't supply it with exactly PI ever
09:53 - then we're we're not gonna get exactly
09:59 - it's not going to return exactly one
10:02 - ever so it's always gonna be some number
10:05 - that's slightly less than one so for
10:09 - that reason I think this would never
10:11 - give us quite 256 it would always give
10:15 - us 255 point something we don't want it
10:18 - to be 256 because that's outside the
10:21 - maximum range of green so let less let's
10:27 - maybe try we could try running it for a
10:30 - bit and getting the maximum by you a
10:31 - green here just to see what it is
10:33 - let's change green now to add in so we
10:36 - can discard the we can discard the by
10:41 - the numbers of the decimal point here
10:43 - let's declare a variable here max which
10:46 - I'll say equal to a low number like zero
10:48 - and let's say inside the loop if green
10:51 - is greater than max then max equals
10:56 - green with a with a if statement usually
11:00 - use brackets but if you've only got one
11:01 - line that you want to execute after the
11:05 - if you can omit the brackets but common
11:08 - source of error errors is to omit the
11:10 - brackets in if-then to imagine the stuff
11:13 - after
11:14 - after the if statement will also be
11:16 - included within the within the the code
11:20 - block of the if statement but and if
11:22 - without brackets without the curly
11:24 - brackets will only apply to the next
11:26 - line so for that reason I usually pull
11:29 - it brackets in but let's just try this
11:31 - temporarily and at the end let's say
11:35 - after the loop finishes let's say see
11:36 - out max and map service I wanted to show
11:43 - you this because this is a really handy
11:44 - thing to do to get them you can get a
11:46 - minimum value in a similar way as well
11:48 - of a variable if you're doing animation
11:51 - often you want to know what the minimum
11:52 - and maximum values of some number are so
11:57 - let's leave it just for a little while
11:58 - and then quit it
12:00 - take a look so the maximum value is 255
12:05 - what I'm going to do is as a extra kind
12:07 - of bit of security here let's let's
12:09 - remove this max thing and I'll remove
12:13 - the output of green and remove this and
12:16 - this is and I'm gonna store the green in
12:20 - an unsigned char so if this did happen
12:25 - to return 256 then it would simply map
12:32 - to some number within the range not to
12:35 - 255 because that's all an unsigned char
12:38 - can store you would see like a student
12:41 - jump in the color which doesn't matter
12:43 - too much for this program it's not like
12:45 - when animating the figure on the screen
12:47 - with this so I think that's alright but
12:50 - if you do see if we do see sudden jumps
12:52 - in our color that we might suspect that
12:55 - somehow we've supplied a value to sign
12:57 - here that actually is and causing it to
13:00 - produce the maximum possible value of
13:02 - 256 and then maybe would once made this
13:05 - one hundred and twenty seven point five
13:08 - or something just to ensure that can't
13:10 - happen by I think this is probably all
13:12 - right now let's supply green in here and
13:17 - and by the way and C++ doesn't seem to
13:20 - care if I and it doesn't care about the
13:23 - fact that I've got a double here and an
13:25 - unsigned char here it just puts
13:27 - the file you into the unsigned char
13:30 - whatever part of it fits which should be
13:33 - all of it in this case and discard stuff
13:36 - after the decimal point but if you want
13:38 - to make it clearly you're doing I'm a
13:40 - cast you can and put in in prac in
13:44 - brackets before the value yet I'll run
13:47 - the opt-in with brackets as well on sign
13:49 - char just to make it clear what you're
13:51 - doing here
13:52 - now that's one less and see how it looks
13:54 - now I suspect on your video this might
13:58 - look quite rubbish because the video may
14:00 - not reproduce colors very accurately but
14:04 - I can see here on my computer that we're
14:07 - getting a really nice very smooth change
14:09 - and as smooth as you can with 256
14:12 - possible values from black all the way
14:16 - up to maximum green intensity and then
14:17 - down again and up again so that looks
14:20 - like is breathing it's a little bit fast
14:22 - though so I'm gonna change this a little
14:26 - bit put an extra Norton there and it's
14:29 - take another look at it let's run this
14:35 - there we go now it's changing very very
14:38 - slowly quite slowly from black up to
14:41 - maximum green then down slowly again to
14:44 - blacken it up again and so on so that
14:47 - that's why you use the sine function
14:49 - because if it can produce this nice
14:51 - smooth looking sort of change at times
14:55 - at the moment I can barely discern it
14:57 - changing but if I watch for a bit longer
14:59 - I can see that it is in fact changing it
15:03 - might be too slow but I've seen let's
15:06 - change
15:07 - now let's let's change red and green in
15:09 - the same way so I'm gonna copy this
15:11 - paste a couple in and let's have a red
15:14 - yeah sorry red and blue
15:16 - let's have a red and blue and I'd like
15:19 - these colours to change I want to
15:21 - combine them all but I want them to
15:23 - change different rates so let's let's
15:27 - change this constant here let's add this
15:29 - no nor nor - and this not not not three
15:33 - just to make them change out of
15:35 - synchronization so that when we combine
15:37 - them we should get various hues of the
15:39 - different
15:40 - colors and I'm gonna put red in here and
15:43 - blue in here let's run that and see how
15:47 - that looks should be interesting so now
15:50 - it's sort of gray in purplish again
15:53 - probably looks a bit rubbish on your
15:54 - video but yeah but it's sort of pink and
15:58 - now it's sort of yellowish now we're
16:00 - going through to full yellow now green
16:03 - and sort of yeah it's really some
16:08 - screen now it's getting a bit blue I
16:10 - think that looks quite nice except that
16:15 - I'm not wild about this pink colour at
16:19 - the beginning maybe it's alright well we
16:22 - could try and see how it looks you could
16:23 - also use a cosine function which is
16:25 - exactly the same except that and cosine
16:29 - will start for a value of zero it starts
16:31 - it and it's maximum value of 1 I'm just
16:35 - curious how that would affect it and it
16:37 - starts up a little greenish color that's
16:40 - maybe well you could play around this
16:43 - with this indefinitely really so I'll
16:48 - leave you to that to investigate that as
16:51 - you wish I think that I think they're
16:55 - fine they're awesome
16:58 - wasn't bad let's stick with that see how
17:00 - that looks so now we've got a nice color
17:03 - changing algorithm and I'm ultimately
17:05 - going to apply that to animated
17:09 - particles that are going to bounce
17:10 - around my screen but I'll leave it there
17:12 - for this tutorial so as always i'd
17:15 - recommend having a go at out of yourself
17:17 - and get it working and the great thing
17:20 - about this is now it was starting to get
17:22 - into territory worrying sort of
17:23 - encourages you to play around with it
17:26 - encourages you to to try different
17:29 - values in here try you know try cosine
17:33 - if you like and you can get creative and
17:36 - anything that springs to mind any way
17:38 - that you can think of to change the
17:40 - colors that might be interesting you can
17:43 - try them and it's well worth having a
17:46 - play around with this and seeing what
17:49 - results you can get
17:51 - so in the next tutorial I'm not sure
17:54 - what we'll do possibly we'll start
17:55 - looking at particles because we've got
17:58 - to get around to that soon so until next
18:00 - time happy coding
18:13 - you

hello this is John from cave of programming calm in this tutorial we're going to take a look at animating colors the reason that I want to do this here is because of moment we've got a nice block of purple on our screen and we've put together all the essential elements for rapidly updating the screen we've got a loop that that can do that and it's I want to change the colors of the pixels as we go along so we're going to end up with some particles kind of bouncing around the screen which are gonna slowly change color but it's a lot easier to see the color of an entire block than it is of an

so the moment we've got a purple screen with a single white pixel right in the center there if you can see it so I'm gonna get rid of that white pixel delete that and I'm gonna work on changing these colors that we fill the entire screen with so to do this let's let's pick one color to start with let's maybe animate say green so it's let's set green 2 to 5 5 and set that you red and blue to zero for the moment and just chapter that looks okay and why don't what actually want to do is change the colors smoothly now that the the ideal thing to do here will be to look up an algorithm for mapping RGB red green blue colors to something like HSL hue saturation lightness the hue is the particular shade of color red or green or whatever and if we had an algorithm that could take a number and into

the program continues to run and to do that we can use a function called STL underscore get tix and this returns the number of milliseconds since the program started so let's say int elapsed equals STL get tix I'm going to supply that value to my sine function and sine is gonna return a value let's call this green between minus 1 and plus 1 so we could just start plot that and for the moment just to see what it looks like so if I if I run this now and don't just let it run for a bit and then quit it in a console here oh yes we're seeing zeroes because I forgot of course that the return value is a doubles no use using an empath let's try this again so I run this let it run for a bit quit it and then we can see that every time the loop is executed we've supplied a an increased volume to sign the number of milliseconds since the program started running and sign has returned here a value in the range of minus 1 to +1 which it's not easy to see here because quite a lot of milliseconds are passing in between each iteration of this loop but it does actually arrange smoothly between minus 1 and plus 1 it changes gradually maybe we can see and maybe we can slow down the change if we multiply elapsed by some small number here because here were jumping quite a lot like from minus not goodnight up all the way up to nor Polly 3 which is not a smooth change because because we're supplying a much bigger value to sign from one iteration of the loop to the next so a lot of milliseconds passes between one iteration of this loop and the next iteration let's multiply it ups by some small number like naught point naught naught 1 and see what we've got then and see if the return value is appearing to change any smoother so this looks a lot better now we can see we can see that it is a smooth change we've got point naught point nine five then point nine five well it's point nine five put nine six basically at point nine five point nine four point nine three nine point nine three five so you see this this file is smoothly changing it and it will bounce up and down between the minimum and maximum value minus one and plus one what we wanted to do is bounce up and down between the minimum and maximum possible values of green which will be naught and 255 in decimal so first of all if we add one to sign that will give us a value in the range not too let's let's run this again put it take a look so now I values range from naught all the way up to we haven't got many values here and but it will in fact range from north up to two now if we take that and multiply it by half of the maximum value that we want it to reach and off of we cut one half of off of 255 I guess will be one hundred and twenty seven point five but lets us maybe multiply it by one to eight and see what that looks like so if I run this just sort of leave it for a bit and then quit and take a look so now hopefully the maximum value of this will be 255 point something so to actually get the value to point nor from sign would have to supply it with exactly exactly well for sign it will be exactly PI over two I think that's right or three times pi diff by two if I remember my trigonometry correctly yeah sine of 90 degrees is 1 so therefore I think I'm right in saying that well we could we could try that actually we could use we could supply this with math dot actually I think there's a constant in math core and underscore PI divide let's divide that by 2 see if that runs much if I remember this correctly so now if we look at that yeah we get 256 but if we're supplying this not with exactly PI over 2 pi is 3.14 1 4 1 5 9 2 etc if we don't supply it with exactly PI ever then we're we're not gonna get exactly it's not going to return exactly one ever so it's always gonna be some number that's slightly less than one so for that reason I think this would never give us quite 256 it would always give us 255 point something we don't want it to be 256 because that's outside the maximum range of green so let less let's maybe try we could try running it for a bit and getting the maximum by you a green here just to see what it is let's change green now to add in so we can discard the we can discard the by the numbers of the decimal point here let's declare a variable here max which I'll say equal to a low number like zero and let's say inside the loop if green is greater than max then max equals green with a with a if statement usually use brackets but if you've only got one line that you want to execute after the if you can omit the brackets but common source of error errors is to omit the brackets in ifthen to imagine the stuff after after the if statement will also be included within the within the the code block of the if statement but and if without brackets without the curly brackets will only apply to the next line so for that reason I usually pull it brackets in but let's just try this temporarily and at the end let's say after the loop finishes let's say see out max and map service I wanted to show you this because this is a really handy thing to do to get them you can get a minimum value in a similar way as well of a variable if you're doing animation often you want to know what the minimum and maximum values of some number are so let's leave it just for a little while and then quit it take a look so the maximum value is 255 what I'm going to do is as a extra kind of bit of security here let's let's remove this max thing and I'll remove the output of green and remove this and this is and I'm gonna store the green in an unsigned char so if this did happen to return 256 then it would simply map to some number within the range not to 255 because that's all an unsigned char can store you would see like a student jump in the color which doesn't matter too much for this program it's not like when animating the figure on the screen with this so I think that's alright but if you do see if we do see sudden jumps in our color that we might suspect that somehow we've supplied a value to sign here that actually is and causing it to produce the maximum possible value of 256 and then maybe would once made this one hundred and twenty seven point five or something just to ensure that can't happen by I think this is probably all right now let's supply green in here and and by the way and C++ doesn't seem to care if I and it doesn't care about the fact that I've got a double here and an unsigned char here it just puts the file you into the unsigned char whatever part of it fits which should be all of it in this case and discard stuff after the decimal point but if you want to make it clearly you're doing I'm a cast you can and put in in prac in brackets before the value yet I'll run the optin with brackets as well on sign char just to make it clear what you're doing here now that's one less and see how it looks now I suspect on your video this might look quite rubbish because the video may not reproduce colors very accurately but I can see here on my computer that we're getting a really nice very smooth change and as smooth as you can with 256 possible values from black all the way up to maximum green intensity and then down again and up again so that looks like is breathing it's a little bit fast though so I'm gonna change this a little bit put an extra Norton there and it's take another look at it let's run this there we go now it's changing very very slowly quite slowly from black up to maximum green then down slowly again to blacken it up again and so on so that that's why you use the sine function because if it can produce this nice smooth looking sort of change at times at the moment I can barely discern it changing but if I watch for a bit longer I can see that it is in fact changing it might be too slow but I've seen let's change now let's let's change red and green in the same way so I'm gonna copy this paste a couple in and let's have a red yeah sorry red and blue let's have a red and blue and I'd like these colours to change I want to combine them all but I want them to change different rates so let's let's change this constant here let's add this no nor nor and this not not not three just to make them change out of synchronization so that when we combine them we should get various hues of the different colors and I'm gonna put red in here and blue in here let's run that and see how that looks should be interesting so now it's sort of gray in purplish again probably looks a bit rubbish on your video but yeah but it's sort of pink and now it's sort of yellowish now we're going through to full yellow now green and sort of yeah it's really some screen now it's getting a bit blue I think that looks quite nice except that I'm not wild about this pink colour at the beginning maybe it's alright well we could try and see how it looks you could also use a cosine function which is exactly the same except that and cosine will start for a value of zero it starts it and it's maximum value of 1 I'm just curious how that would affect it and it starts up a little greenish color that's maybe well you could play around this with this indefinitely really so I'll leave you to that to investigate that as you wish I think that I think they're fine they're awesome wasn't bad let's stick with that see how that looks so now we've got a nice color changing algorithm and I'm ultimately going to apply that to animated particles that are going to bounce around my screen but I'll leave it there for this tutorial so as always i'd recommend having a go at out of yourself and get it working and the great thing about this is now it was starting to get into territory worrying sort of encourages you to play around with it encourages you to to try different values in here try you know try cosine if you like and you can get creative and anything that springs to mind any way that you can think of to change the colors that might be interesting you can try them and it's well worth having a play around with this and seeing what results you can get so in the next tutorial I'm not sure what we'll do possibly we'll start looking at particles because we've got to get around to that soon so until next time happy coding you
