00:00 - hello in this video we're going to take
00:03 - a look at doing calculations so let's
00:07 - say I've got some people and their
00:10 - average height is one point let's say
00:15 - six seven meters so double height equals
00:20 - one point six seven now let's say I want
00:23 - to know I've got seven of these people
00:25 - and they're they're performing acrobats
00:27 - and they're going to all stand on each
00:29 - of those shoulders and I want to know
00:31 - how high seven of them will be standing
00:34 - on each other's shoulders so I could
00:36 - just write this out height times seven
00:41 - or if I if I like I could write seven
00:43 - point naught here it makes no difference
00:45 - and if I run that I find that the answer
00:48 - is seven of them on top of each other
00:51 - are going to be eleven point six nine
00:52 - meters high now what I could also do is
00:56 - I could write double let's say result
00:59 - equals height times seven and then I
01:04 - could output the result let's run this
01:09 - and we should get the same well the same
01:11 - result okay now there is one thing that
01:16 - beginners often tend to do which is a
01:19 - bad idea which is that beginners are
01:22 - liable to give variable names really
01:24 - short letters like are occasionally
01:29 - that's appropriate typically when you're
01:31 - using mathematical equations and a
01:33 - convention is that you would use for
01:35 - example an X or a Y then it makes sense
01:38 - to just use one letter but most of the
01:40 - time don't give variables one letter
01:42 - names because it gets very confusing
01:45 - another thing is in general don't give
01:48 - variables vague names so here I've
01:51 - written result what does that mean it
01:53 - really tells me nothing about what I'm
01:58 - actually doing here so it will be better
02:00 - to give it a more specific name give it
02:02 - the most meaningful name that you can
02:05 - you can also even use multiple words in
02:08 - your variables so I could create a
02:11 - variable called total
02:12 - Haight and what I do is by convention in
02:16 - the convention that Java usually uses
02:20 - the first word in your variable has a
02:23 - lowercase first letter so the variable
02:25 - starts with a lowercase first letter but
02:28 - any word after that has an uppercase
02:30 - first letter so total height will be
02:33 - written like this that makes it easy to
02:36 - read and it's also meaningful so it if
02:43 - okay if you don't know exactly what
02:45 - you're calculating and just kind of
02:47 - making something up to see how it goes
02:48 - then it might make sense to write result
02:51 - here but if you possibly can give your
02:54 - variable and meaningful name it's better
02:56 - to make it excessively long than to make
03:00 - it excessively cryptic by making it too
03:03 - short and too meaningless
03:04 - it makes your programs a lot easier to
03:06 - read okay so we're we're here creating
03:11 - the total height of seven people stood
03:13 - on top of each other now supposing they
03:16 - also have a flagpole the height of the
03:19 - flagpole are defining another variable
03:21 - so like this double flagpole height
03:25 - let's call it equals let's say the
03:31 - flagpole is two meters high I'll write
03:34 - to point naught and in fact this height
03:39 - here well that's not very meaningful
03:41 - because now I've got multiple Heights in
03:43 - my program I want to change it so that
03:47 - we have this site and this site wherever
03:50 - I've used height I want it to say person
03:53 - height rather than do that by hand since
03:56 - I've got multiple versions of it I'm
03:59 - going to right click and I'm going to go
04:02 - to source and I'll go to no sorry I'm
04:09 - going to go to refactor so right click
04:11 - it go to refactor rename and type a new
04:14 - name so I'm going to type here person
04:18 - height and it corrects all of all of my
04:24 - variables that are called height it
04:26 - it corrects the specific variable that I
04:29 - want to change okay so we've got the
04:31 - height of a person we've got a flagpole
04:34 - height we're calculating the total
04:36 - height of seven people on top of each
04:38 - other and I also want to add the height
04:41 - of the flagpole on toques I want to know
04:43 - how high the whole thing is seven people
04:45 - on top of each other and the top on is
04:47 - waving a flag pole holding it presumably
04:50 - by the very end of it using his or her
04:53 - fingertips let's run this I've got to
04:56 - save it first and so this this is what
04:59 - we originally have at eleven point six
05:01 - nine so if I add the flagpole height we
05:04 - should get thirteen point six nine let's
05:07 - add that in plus flagpole and to save me
05:12 - typing out the variable I can hold down
05:15 - control and press space and then it
05:18 - brings up a list of suggestions and I
05:21 - can hit return to select the first one
05:24 - okay let's let's run this and now we get
05:28 - thirteen point six nine one last thing I
05:32 - want to bring to your attention is that
05:34 - this looks ambiguous this expression
05:37 - because does it mean person height times
05:39 - seven and then add the flagpole height
05:42 - or does it mean person height times 7
05:46 - plus the flagpole height so you could
05:49 - add 7 to the float pole height and then
05:52 - multiply the person height by that or
05:54 - you could add 7 to person height and
05:56 - then add the flagpole height there are
05:58 - things there are rules called operator
06:01 - precedence rules which we're going to
06:04 - talk about a bit but for now when you
06:07 - have an expression like this and this is
06:08 - really good practice anyway put round
06:11 - brackets in to make it less ambiguous so
06:14 - if I put round brackets around this part
06:16 - that makes it clear that I'm adding
06:19 - multiplying the person height by 7 and
06:21 - after that I'm adding the float pole
06:23 - height hopefully you understand what I
06:25 - mean because the other the other thing
06:28 - that we could have done instead is I
06:31 - could add 7 to the flagpole height and
06:34 - multiply the person height by that but
06:36 - that gives us something else it's not
06:38 - what we want in this
06:41 - here we get 15 point zero three but what
06:44 - I want is to add the person hi what
06:50 - sorry multiply it by seven and then add
06:52 - the flagpole height let's run this okay
06:57 - soon I'm going to give you an exercise
06:58 - with this but there was a lot in that
07:01 - video
07:02 - so what I would recommend is that type
07:07 - this out yourself and run it and get it
07:08 - working and then make up your own little
07:11 - program think of something you could
07:13 - calculate no matter how silly we're not
07:16 - standing on pride here it's good to
07:18 - experiment with silly ideas think of
07:20 - something you could calculate and try to
07:23 - calculate it and let's put a comment on
07:25 - here in here with two slashes and I'm
07:29 - gonna write calculate height of seven
07:33 - people plus a flagpole there we go okay
07:40 - try it out for yourself and then try to
07:42 - make up a little program that does a
07:43 - calculation and see how you get on and
07:46 - until next time happy coding

hello in this video we're going to take a look at doing calculations so let's say I've got some people and their average height is one point let's say six seven meters so double height equals one point six seven now let's say I want to know I've got seven of these people and they're they're performing acrobats and they're going to all stand on each of those shoulders and I want to know how high seven of them will be standing on each other's shoulders so I could just write this out height times seven or if I if I like I could write seven point naught here it makes no difference and if I run that I find that the answer is seven of them on top of each other are going to be eleven point six nine meters high now what I could also do is I could write double let's say result equals height times seven and then I could output the result let's run this and we should get the same well the same result okay now there is one thing that beginners often tend to do which is a bad idea which is

will be written like this that makes it easy to read and it's also meaningful so it if okay if you don't know exactly what you're calculating and just kind of making something up to see how it goes

flagpole the height of the flagpole are defining another variable so like this double flagpole height let's call it equals let's say the flagpole is two meters high I'll write to point naught and in fact this height here well that's not very meaningful because now I've got multiple Heights in my program I want to change it so that we have this site and this site wherever I've used height I want
