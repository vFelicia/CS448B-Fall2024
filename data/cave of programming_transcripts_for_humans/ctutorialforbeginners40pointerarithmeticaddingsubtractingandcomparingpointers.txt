00:17 - hello this is John from Cave of
00:20 - program.com in this tutorial we're going
00:21 - to look at pointer arithmetic in
00:25 - C++ so I'm still thinking about how I'm
00:27 - going to organize the videos in this
00:29 - course but I'm probably going to put
00:31 - this video after one on pointers and
00:35 - arrays uh and if you have seen that
00:37 - video already then you'll you will have
00:39 - seen some of the stuff that we're going
00:41 - to do here but um whether you have or
00:44 - not this this stuff is worth going
00:46 - through a couple of times and I'm going
00:49 - to go through some stuff here that I
00:51 - haven't shown you in any other video in
00:53 - any
00:54 - case um and it's it's import it's quite
00:57 - important stuff to know as well you do
01:00 - use it I have used this in actual
01:02 - programs believe it or not so I've got
01:04 - here a um I've got here an
01:08 - array yes so I'm definitely going to
01:10 - have to put this after the video on
01:11 - pointers and arrays let's create a
01:13 - pointer to the start of this array so
01:16 - I'm going to say string pointer P text
01:21 - equals
01:22 - text so that you'll hopefully remember
01:25 - will now point at the first element in
01:27 - the array and we could do see out D
01:30 - reference the pointer so thing pointed
01:33 - out by
01:34 - PEX and that's going to give us the
01:36 - first element in this Five Element array
01:38 - which is going to be the string one
01:41 - let's just run this and check so it says
01:45 - one um I'm actually going to I'm going
01:48 - to put the number of elements in here
01:50 - cuz I I think I want it later on so
01:52 - we've got five elements one 2 3 4 5 so
01:56 - the number of items in the array we can
01:58 - specify there although it's optional
02:00 - when you initialize an array like this
02:03 - and actually I'd like I'd like to be
02:05 - able to use that number later so I'm
02:07 - going to say int um elements equals
02:13 - 5 and I'm going to put this here
02:17 - elements uh now a common thing to do is
02:20 - if you've got something like this um an
02:22 - INT which you or any value which you
02:24 - don't want to change in your program you
02:26 - don't want it to ever change cuz if if
02:29 - we change the this now it wouldn't be
02:30 - the number of elements in the array
02:32 - anymore then um you can put const in
02:35 - front of it and that means that I I now
02:37 - can't change elements so if I set
02:39 - elements equal to seven now and I try to
02:43 - compile the program uh it will give me a
02:46 - compiler error it just wouldn't compile
02:48 - which is what I want that's like a
02:50 - safety check to make the Cons make sure
02:53 - that this now can't change it's also
02:55 - quite common if You' got a constant to
02:57 - put it all in capital letters so so
02:59 - let's say um n strings meaning number of
03:03 - strings you can put an underscore there
03:06 - if you want but this looks quite funky
03:08 - so let's just use this and let's put
03:10 - that there so we now we now know that
03:12 - that's fixed and it's the number of
03:14 - elements in this
03:16 - array so um so the program works uh so
03:22 - um one thing we can do here is um we can
03:26 - do addition with
03:27 - pointers we've seen this in the video on
03:31 - pointers and arrays but if we
03:34 - incremented P text like this P Tex uh if
03:38 - we add one to it which we can do the
03:41 - shortest way is to say Plus+ we could
03:44 - say equals P
03:46 - Tex + one let's do that first just to
03:49 - see it and then let's do a c out on
03:52 - thing pointer 2 by CeX
03:57 - endler and run this
04:01 - then we get two so um the the shorthand
04:05 - way of doing that again we could do plus
04:07 - equals 1 that would also
04:10 - work or we could just
04:13 - do
04:17 - Plus+ um or for that matter we could do
04:20 - plus equals 3 and then uh so it started
04:24 - pointing here and we add one two and
04:28 - three now it's going to point point at
04:30 - the uh at the string that says four so
04:33 - we can add numbers to pointers and that
04:36 - will move it forward the number of
04:39 - blocks of memory corresponding to one
04:43 - unit whatever one unit is so in this
04:45 - case it's a pointed to a string so it's
04:47 - going to move forward by one string if
04:49 - it was appointed to a Char it would move
04:52 - forward by one by three chars in this
04:54 - case in other words three bytes forward
04:58 - because the Char is one bite
05:02 - um we can also we can do subtraction as
05:05 - well quite happily we can say
05:08 - PX negative
05:11 - equals um 2 so if we move forward three
05:14 - to four and then we go to back one two
05:17 - we expect it to now be pointing at two
05:22 - let's try that so I'm going to run that
05:25 - and it says two
05:29 - we can uh compare pointers as well so um
05:35 - we can
05:36 - say uh let's say string pointer P end
05:41 - equals and let's set it equal to the
05:44 - let's set it to point at the last
05:45 - element in Tex so
05:48 - Texs uh n strings and remember the
05:52 - number of the the last element in the
05:54 - array will be at the position which is
05:58 - the number of elements in the string
06:00 - min-1 so it's going to be index four not
06:03 - five and that's because um we start
06:07 - numbering at zero so if we started
06:09 - numbering at one we'd have 1 2 3 4 5 and
06:13 - The Fifth Element would be at five which
06:15 - is the number of strings in the array
06:16 - but because we start at zero we've got 0
06:19 - 1 2 3 4 so we have to subtract one from
06:23 - the number of elements in the array to
06:26 - get at the last element and it's very
06:28 - very important to remember that
06:31 - especially since the compiler probably
06:33 - won't warn you if you put a stupid
06:35 - number in here by mistake and it's a
06:38 - common source of errors in
06:42 - C++ um so now we've got a pointed to the
06:45 - end we can compare these pointers so as
06:48 - we saw in the uh video I think we saw
06:52 - this in the in the video on um arrays
06:54 - and pointers but we can do stuff like
06:57 - this while uh P text is not equal to P
07:05 - end we can say see
07:08 - out thing pointed to by P
07:13 - text
07:15 - endler and P text
07:20 - Plus+ if if we do that um we're going to
07:24 - get uh whoops let's just see we've got
07:27 - an error here somewhere oh yeah I forgot
07:30 - to take the address of it so yeah that
07:32 - that would actually give us the last
07:34 - element and the array but we need the
07:35 - address of that element and because this
07:38 - is a pointer so let's just put the
07:40 - address symbol in there and now we'll
07:43 - try that again and hopefully that will
07:45 - work uh so we get now um 2 3 4 well this
07:50 - is a little bit confusing because um uh
07:56 - PEX doesn't point to the beginning let's
07:57 - just do that PEX
08:00 - equals and let's use this syntax again
08:03 - just to make it really clear and set
08:05 - that equal right to the start
08:08 - here now we're not going to Output the
08:10 - last element here we've got 1 2 3 4 and
08:13 - the reason for that is when it actually
08:15 - gets to the last element the loop stops
08:18 - here if we wanted it to point to the
08:21 - last element we could actually do
08:24 - this and that would work so let's run
08:27 - that 1 2 3 4 5
08:30 - so um whatever you do don't try to write
08:34 - the value here and don't read it either
08:36 - because it will be garbage reading it
08:38 - will give you garbage writing it will
08:40 - potentially screw up your operating
08:43 - system and you'll have to restart your
08:44 - computer or something in the worst case
08:47 - um but as long as you remember that you
08:50 - mustn't read or write that um I mean you
08:52 - mustn't read or write the value here
08:54 - nevertheless you can point the pointer
08:57 - off the end of the array with which in
09:00 - this situation is quite useful so you
09:02 - can point the pointer wherever you like
09:04 - it's fine it's not going to give you a
09:05 - warning or an error just remember that
09:08 - if it's pointing somewhere where you
09:10 - haven't allocated memory then you
09:12 - mustn't start reading or writing that
09:14 - memory but sometimes this is actually
09:17 - quite
09:18 - useful we could we could also do pointer
09:22 - subtraction we we could um yeah so if I
09:25 - do um let's say uh let's let's
09:30 - do this again set it back to the
09:33 - beginning okay I'll put a comment in
09:35 - here set P text back to
09:39 - start so if we set it back to the start
09:42 - then we could do um p n netive
09:50 - P1 now the result of this um should be a
09:54 - pointer but the pointer that would be
09:56 - the result of doing this wouldn't be any
09:58 - use to it
10:00 - it would point at some memory location
10:03 - uh like memory location five I suppose
10:06 - uh because we're pointing this just off
10:09 - the end of the array and this points to
10:10 - the beginning so the difference between
10:12 - the two will be 1 2 3 4
10:15 - 5 and um that's no use as a pointer we'd
10:19 - have a pointer pointing to memory
10:20 - location five there's nothing
10:22 - interesting in there but we could do int
10:26 - uh elements let's say equals
10:31 - and let's output elements see our
10:34 - elements so if we subtract one point
10:37 - from another we can store that in a um
10:42 - in an integer
10:44 - whoops I should have called that
10:46 - elements let's say
10:48 - elements except that it probably should
10:51 - really be long um but in this case um I
10:56 - know that this is going to be a small
10:59 - number number so um I can successfully
11:02 - do
11:03 - this
11:05 - uh it could yeah pointers they're
11:08 - actually if I remember rightly they're
11:10 - actually um like a long type um more
11:15 - than in so you could store really big
11:17 - numbers in them um I believe uh and so
11:22 - maybe it makes a little bit more sense
11:24 - to do this that makes it a little bit
11:27 - clearer what's happening so we use long
11:29 - cuz we're dealing with pointers and also
11:32 - we'll put everything in Brackets and
11:34 - cast to a long just to really just to
11:38 - make it clear what's what's happening
11:40 - although it worked fine without that and
11:43 - that's going to give us the number of
11:44 - elements of course in the array because
11:48 - uh the difference between the memory
11:50 - location of the first element and a
11:52 - memory location of the element after the
11:54 - end of the array is going to be five so
11:57 - if if we take this first pointer here
12:00 - and we add five to it 1 2 3 4 5 we get a
12:05 - pointer that's just off the edge of the
12:07 - array so in other words if we subtract
12:10 - end from start yeah we're going to get
12:13 - the number of elements in the
12:15 - array I think that's all I I want to
12:17 - cover in this tutorial well there's one
12:20 - more little thing which is going to come
12:22 - in useful a bit later on uh which which
12:26 - is that suppose we want a pointer to the
12:29 - middle of the array we could do
12:31 - something like um let's set pext back to
12:34 - the
12:36 - start
12:38 - and then let's say p
12:42 - text plus
12:45 - equals we'll do Pex Plus
12:48 - equals n strings divide by
12:53 - two and then let's do c out of P texts
12:58 - so C out
13:00 - p
13:04 - t well this is going to give us well
13:08 - let's take a look um it's going to give
13:10 - us a memory location cuz I forgot to put
13:12 - the I forgot to dreference the pointer
13:14 - with a star let's do this again so we're
13:18 - getting three so we've got the the
13:20 - middle of the array so what's happened
13:23 - is um we've done end strings divide by
13:25 - two because we're doing integer division
13:27 - it discards the remainder so the answer
13:29 - to that 5 IDE by two because they're
13:32 - both integers we're just going to get um
13:35 - two we're going to discard the remainder
13:37 - it's not going to be 2.5 just two and
13:40 - then when we add two to PEX so PEX is
13:43 - there one two we get the middle element
13:48 - in the array uh and this kind of thing
13:52 - either this or something very similar uh
13:55 - is going to be very useful in an
13:56 - exercise which I'm going to give you in
13:58 - a future tutorial
14:00 - so um I will give you an exercise that
14:02 - will help you with this later on but um
14:05 - just for the moment uh if you have the
14:08 - uh motivation and energy it's definitely
14:11 - very worthwhile just to practice this a
14:12 - little bit declare a pointer to an array
14:14 - and practice going backwards and
14:16 - forwards in the array so practice
14:18 - addition with pointers practice
14:20 - subtraction practice comparing pointers
14:24 - um just make up some example for
14:26 - yourself and check that it works as you
14:28 - expect
14:29 - and uh see what happens when you
14:31 - subtract pointers get a result in an INT
14:34 - and if you do that to make it really
14:36 - worthwhile think about everything
14:38 - carefully as I've done as I've gone
14:40 - through this tutorial and make sure
14:42 - everything's exactly what you what you
14:44 - expect probably will catch you out um
14:46 - the first time you do this you probably
14:48 - get something unexpected but if you
14:50 - think carefully about why you've got the
14:52 - result that you have you should be able
14:54 - to figure it out so it's a bit of a
14:56 - puzzle there but just make up your own
14:58 - example
14:59 - just like I've done here and go through
15:01 - each of those different possible cases
15:03 - and also see uh check that you can get a
15:06 - pointer to the middle of an array as
15:08 - well that'll give you a really good
15:09 - workout with pointer arithmetic so
15:12 - that's it for this tutorial and until
15:14 - next time happy coding

Cleaned transcript:

hello this is John from Cave of program.com in this tutorial we're going to look at pointer arithmetic in C++ so I'm still thinking about how I'm going to organize the videos in this course but I'm probably going to put this video after one on pointers and arrays uh and if you have seen that video already then you'll you will have seen some of the stuff that we're going to do here but um whether you have or not this this stuff is worth going through a couple of times and I'm going to go through some stuff here that I haven't shown you in any other video in any case um and it's it's import it's quite important stuff to know as well you do use it I have used this in actual programs believe it or not so I've got here a um I've got here an array yes so I'm definitely going to have to put this after the video on pointers and arrays let's create a pointer to the start of this array so I'm going to say string pointer P text equals text so that you'll hopefully remember will now point at the first element in the array and we could do see out D reference the pointer so thing pointed out by PEX and that's going to give us the first element in this Five Element array which is going to be the string one let's just run this and check so it says one um I'm actually going to I'm going to put the number of elements in here cuz I I think I want it later on so we've got five elements one 2 3 4 5 so the number of items in the array we can specify there although it's optional when you initialize an array like this and actually I'd like I'd like to be able to use that number later so I'm going to say int um elements equals 5 and I'm going to put this here elements uh now a common thing to do is if you've got something like this um an INT which you or any value which you don't want to change in your program you don't want it to ever change cuz if if we change the this now it wouldn't be the number of elements in the array anymore then um you can put const in front of it and that means that I I now can't change elements so if I set elements equal to seven now and I try to compile the program uh it will give me a compiler error it just wouldn't compile which is what I want that's like a safety check to make the Cons make sure that this now can't change it's also quite common if You' got a constant to put it all in capital letters so so let's say um n strings meaning number of strings you can put an underscore there if you want but this looks quite funky so let's just use this and let's put that there so we now we now know that that's fixed and it's the number of elements in this array so um so the program works uh so um one thing we can do here is um we can do addition with pointers we've seen this in the video on pointers and arrays but if we incremented P text like this P Tex uh if we add one to it which we can do the shortest way is to say Plus+ we could say equals P Tex + one let's do that first just to see it and then let's do a c out on thing pointer 2 by CeX endler and run this then we get two so um the the shorthand way of doing that again we could do plus equals 1 that would also work or we could just do Plus+ um or for that matter we could do plus equals 3 and then uh so it started pointing here and we add one two and three now it's going to point point at the uh at the string that says four so we can add numbers to pointers and that will move it forward the number of blocks of memory corresponding to one unit whatever one unit is so in this case it's a pointed to a string so it's going to move forward by one string if it was appointed to a Char it would move forward by one by three chars in this case in other words three bytes forward because the Char is one bite um we can also we can do subtraction as well quite happily we can say PX negative equals um 2 so if we move forward three to four and then we go to back one two we expect it to now be pointing at two let's try that so I'm going to run that and it says two we can uh compare pointers as well so um we can say uh let's say string pointer P end equals and let's set it equal to the let's set it to point at the last element in Tex so Texs uh n strings and remember the number of the the last element in the array will be at the position which is the number of elements in the string min1 so it's going to be index four not five and that's because um we start numbering at zero so if we started numbering at one we'd have 1 2 3 4 5 and The Fifth Element would be at five which is the number of strings in the array but because we start at zero we've got 0 1 2 3 4 so we have to subtract one from the number of elements in the array to get at the last element and it's very very important to remember that especially since the compiler probably won't warn you if you put a stupid number in here by mistake and it's a common source of errors in C++ um so now we've got a pointed to the end we can compare these pointers so as we saw in the uh video I think we saw this in the in the video on um arrays and pointers but we can do stuff like this while uh P text is not equal to P end we can say see out thing pointed to by P text endler and P text Plus+ if if we do that um we're going to get uh whoops let's just see we've got an error here somewhere oh yeah I forgot to take the address of it so yeah that that would actually give us the last element and the array but we need the address of that element and because this is a pointer so let's just put the address symbol in there and now we'll try that again and hopefully that will work uh so we get now um 2 3 4 well this is a little bit confusing because um uh PEX doesn't point to the beginning let's just do that PEX equals and let's use this syntax again just to make it really clear and set that equal right to the start here now we're not going to Output the last element here we've got 1 2 3 4 and the reason for that is when it actually gets to the last element the loop stops here if we

this first pointer here and we add five to it 1 2 3 4 5 we get a pointer that's just off the edge of the array so in other words if we subtract end from start yeah we're going to get the number of elements in the array I think that's all I I want to cover in this tutorial well there's one more little thing which is going to come in useful a bit later on uh which which is that suppose we want a pointer to the middle of the array we could do something like um let's set pext back to the start and then let's say p text plus equals we'll do Pex Plus equals n strings divide by two and then let's do c out of P texts so C out p t well this is going to give us well let's take a look um it's going to give us a memory location cuz I forgot to put the I forgot to dreference the pointer with a star let's do this again so we're getting three so we've got the the middle of the array so what's happened is um we've done end strings divide by two because we're doing integer division it discards the remainder so the answer to that 5 IDE by two because they're both integers we're just going to get um two we're going to discard the remainder it's not going to be 2.5 just two and then when we add two to PEX so PEX is there one two we get the middle element in the array uh and this kind of thing either this or something very similar uh is going to be very useful in an exercise which I'm going to give you in a future tutorial so um I will give you an exercise that will help you with this later on but um just for the moment uh if you have the uh motivation and energy it's definitely very worthwhile just to practice this a little bit declare a pointer to an array and practice going backwards and forwards in the array so practice addition with pointers practice subtraction practice comparing pointers um just make up some example for yourself and check that it works as you expect and uh see what happens when you subtract pointers get a result in an INT and if you do that to make it really worthwhile think about everything carefully as I've done as I've gone through this tutorial and make sure everything's exactly what you what you expect probably will catch you out um the first time you do this you probably get something unexpected but if you think carefully about why you've got the result that you have you should be able to figure it out so it's a bit of a puzzle there but just make up your own example just like I've done here and go through each of those different possible cases and also see uh check that you can get a pointer to the middle of an array as well that'll give you a really good workout with pointer arithmetic so that's it for this tutorial and until next time happy coding
