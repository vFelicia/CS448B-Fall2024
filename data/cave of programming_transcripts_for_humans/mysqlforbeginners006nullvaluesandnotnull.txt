00:00 - hello this is John from Cave of
00:02 - programming. comom in this tutorial
00:04 - we're going to take a look at null in my
00:06 - SQL that's Nu LL null so null is a
00:10 - special value that means that a field in
00:12 - your table doesn't have any value if we
00:16 - look at the table we've got now the
00:17 - users table if we do a desk on it desk
00:20 - users we see it has two columns and we
00:23 - see in the results grid here that they
00:26 - are they are both allowed to be null
00:28 - that's cuz we created them in the
00:30 - default way which would allow them
00:32 - normally to be null so we can do the
00:35 - following for example we can say and
00:37 - let's actually just bring up a uh a
00:40 - query that I already run here
00:43 - um so let's let's insert a row into the
00:47 - table I'll give it an idea of two but
00:50 - for the username I'll specify null and
00:53 - that means that for the username there's
00:54 - not going to be any value for this row
00:57 - so I'm going to insert that and yeah yes
01:00 - it went okay we can see down here and
01:02 - I'll do a select and run that so now we
01:05 - can see we've got a row with the IDE of
01:07 - two but I set the username to null it
01:11 - has no value we can do the same thing
01:13 - with the other column as well because
01:15 - that's also allowed to be null and we
01:16 - could even if we wanted make them both
01:19 - null like this and now if we do a select
01:23 - star from users we see we've got a row
01:26 - with two null values in it now often you
01:29 - don't don't want that often what you
01:32 - want is to specify that a particular
01:36 - value in a
01:37 - particular uh field it can't be null so
01:41 - you want to say that all the values in a
01:43 - certain column can't be null so we'll
01:46 - look at how to do this but first let's
01:49 - just take um let's try something a
01:52 - little bit different so I'm going to I'm
01:55 - going to do another insert into this
01:57 - table let's try this and this time in my
02:01 - Fields list here the list of columns I'm
02:05 - only going to specify one one column so
02:07 - I'm going to delete username just as a
02:10 - random choice and I'm going to specify
02:12 - the value three for that column so we
02:14 - can easily see which which column it is
02:17 - so here I'm doing an insert where we're
02:18 - only inserting a value for one
02:21 - particular column and if I run this and
02:24 - then I do a select star from users what
02:27 - we see is that we've inserted a row with
02:31 - the ID equal to three but again we've
02:33 - got null for the
02:36 - username uh so you don't have to specify
02:39 - all the columns when you do an insert if
02:41 - you've got columns that are allowed to
02:43 - be null which they are if you create
02:45 - them in a default way you don't have to
02:47 - specify those columns when you do an
02:49 - insert and then the value will be null
02:51 - it will have no value for the row that
02:53 - you
02:54 - inserted sometimes we want to as I say
02:57 - we want to say that um values in the
02:59 - common can't be null this is really
03:01 - common uh it's probably the the most
03:04 - frequent case because um often we don't
03:07 - want data with sort of missing values in
03:10 - our
03:11 - database let's drop this table let's say
03:13 - drop table
03:15 - users so that's going to delete the
03:17 - table and the table should be gone we
03:19 - can check with show tables if we like
03:22 - and we see there's no tables in this
03:24 - database and let's recreate it so I'm
03:26 - going to say uh create table
03:30 - users let's say ID um we'll just use the
03:34 - same as before ID is going to be a int
03:38 - and let's make a username field which is
03:40 - going to be text a username column I
03:43 - should say so if we create a table like
03:47 - this both of the columns are allowed to
03:49 - be null but we can put not null after
03:52 - any column to say that it can't be null
03:56 - so you can do that on any of the columns
03:58 - that you want to not be null
04:00 - all Let's uh let's try it with let's try
04:05 - it with both of them I think we'll make
04:08 - both of the columns not null and then if
04:10 - we do a desk
04:12 - users we see that now they're not
04:15 - allowed to be null so now if I try doing
04:17 - stuff like let's bring up an insert
04:20 - here um so I let's
04:23 - try well we'll try this let's just run
04:25 - this this is going to give an error we
04:27 - can't insert null values for either of
04:29 - the either of these columns now even if
04:31 - I specify an ID because I said also
04:35 - username not null when I created the
04:37 - table this went wrong because even the
04:40 - username by itself can't be null so
04:42 - again we get an error down here now it's
04:45 - interesting to see what happens if you
04:48 - insert um a if you try to insert a row
04:52 - in a table with fields that are not
04:53 - allowed to be null but then you don't
04:55 - mention those names in your insert so
04:57 - let's try it um
05:00 - I will try getting rid of username here
05:04 - and I'll try to insert a row with the
05:06 - IDE of nine now if I run this on this
05:10 - particular version of my SQL uh
05:12 - configured the way it is what I find is
05:15 - that I get a warning icon down here and
05:19 - if I do now a so it's not an error that
05:22 - SQL has run it's just giving me a
05:23 - warning if I do select star from users
05:27 - we see that what's happened is we did
05:29 - insert the row the username appears to
05:32 - be blank so the username is is not null
05:36 - it does have a value but this value is
05:38 - actually a blank string uh that's the
05:41 - default value for a text type I'm
05:44 - calling it a string because this is kind
05:47 - of a technical lingo for some characters
05:50 - you know a piece of text we call it a
05:52 - string so the default value for a text
05:56 - type is is a is a blank string a string
06:00 - of zero length which is not the same as
06:02 - null if you try this on your database
06:05 - you might find that you get different
06:07 - results and we're going to talk about
06:08 - that a bit in the next tutorial let's
06:10 - just try this again so this time what
06:13 - I'll do is I will try missing out the ID
06:18 - in the field list and just specify
06:21 - username which I'll set to um someone I
06:26 - don't know can't think of a name let's
06:28 - let's just run this so now again we've
06:30 - got a warning icon down there at the
06:32 - bottom in the output um Pane and if we
06:36 - try doing a select now we see that we've
06:40 - inserted a value we've inserted a row
06:42 - where the username is someone as I
06:44 - specified and again ID has a default
06:48 - value for its type and since ID is an
06:51 - INT it the default value for an in is
06:55 - zero now this this Behavior you might
06:58 - get different Behavior with your version
07:00 - of MySQL or it might be just that you if
07:03 - someone else installed it especially or
07:05 - if if the MySQL developers decide to
07:08 - change the default options you might
07:10 - find that you can't do this that it
07:12 - won't let you uh not specify a value in
07:16 - an insert when the when the value is
07:20 - we've said it's not null when we create
07:22 - a table and we're going to look in the
07:24 - next tutorial at some configuration
07:26 - options that affect this so uh to
07:29 - practice this um certainly give this a
07:32 - go try creating a table with two or more
07:35 - columns and make some or even all of
07:37 - them not null and then try doing inserts
07:40 - in there try inserting explicitly
07:43 - inserting null values as I did near the
07:45 - beginning of the tutorial and try also
07:48 - just missing those fields out of your
07:51 - field list in your insert statement um
07:54 - miss miss them out so try to insert a
07:57 - row where you're only speing specifying
07:59 - values for certain columns and see what
08:02 - results you get with not null Fields
08:05 - does my SQL insert a default uh value
08:09 - for a field that you haven't specify a
08:11 - value for or does it do something else
08:14 - does it throw an error do have a go at
08:17 - that and then in the next tutorial we'll
08:20 - look at some config options so until
08:23 - next time happy coding

hello this is John from Cave of programming. comom in this tutorial we're going to take a look at null in my SQL that's Nu LL null so null is a special value that means that a field in your table doesn't have any value if we look at the table we've got now the users table if we do a desk on it desk users we see it has two columns and we see in the results grid here that they are they are both

be any value for this row so I'm going to insert that and yeah yes it went okay we can see down here and I'll do a select and run that so now we can see we've got a row with the IDE of two but I set the username to null it has no value we can do the same thing with the other column as well because that's also allowed to be null and we could even if we wanted make them both null like this and now if we do a select star from users we see we've got a row with two null values in it now often you don't don't want that often what you want is to specify that a particular value in a particular uh field it can't be null so you want to say that all the values in a certain column can't be null so we'll look at how to do this but first let's just take um let's try something a little bit different so I'm going to I'm going to do another insert into this table let's try this and this time in my Fields list here the list of columns I'm only going to specify one one column so I'm going to delete

for one particular column and if I run this and then I do a select star from users what we see is that we've inserted a row with the ID equal to three but again we've got null for the username uh so you don't have to specify all the columns when you do an insert if you've got columns that are allowed to be null which they are if you create them in a default way you don't have to specify those columns when you do an insert and then the value will be null it will have no value for the row that you inserted sometimes we want to as I say we want to say that um values in the common can't be null this is really common uh it's probably the the most frequent case because um often we don't want data with sort of missing values in our database let's drop this table let's say drop table users so that's going to delete the table and the table should be gone we can check with show tables if we like and we see there's no tables in this database and let's recreate it so I'm going to say uh create table users let's say ID um we'll just use the same as before ID is going to be a int and let's make a username field which is going to be text a username column I should say so if we create a table like this both of the columns are allowed to be null but we can put not null after any column to say that it can't be null so you can do that on any of the columns that you want to not be null all Let's uh let's try it with let's try it with both of them I think we'll make both of the columns not null and then if we do a desk users we see that now they're not allowed to be null so now if I try doing stuff like let's bring up an insert here um so I let's try well we'll try this let's just run this this is going to give an error we can't insert null values for either of the either of these columns now even if I specify an ID because I said also username not null when I created the table this went wrong because even the username by itself can't be null so again we get an error down here now it's interesting to see what happens if you insert um a if you try to insert a row in a table with fields that are not allowed to be null but then you don't mention those names in your insert so let's try it um I will try getting rid of username here and I'll try to insert a row with the IDE of nine now if I run this on this particular version of my SQL uh configured the way it is what I find is that I get a warning icon down here and if I do now a so it's not an error that SQL has run it's just giving me a warning if I do select star from users we see that what's happened is we did insert the row the username appears to be blank so the username is is not null it does have a value but this value is actually a blank string uh that's the default value for a text type I'm calling it a string because this is kind of a technical lingo for some characters you know a piece of text we call it a string so the default value for a text type is is a is a blank string a string of zero

someone as I specified and again ID has a default value for its type and since ID is an INT it the default value for an in is zero now this this Behavior you might get different Behavior with your version of MySQL or it might be just that you if someone else installed it especially or if if the MySQL developers decide to change the default options you might find that you can't do this that it won't let you uh not specify a value in an insert when the when the value is we've said it's not null when we create a table and we're going to look in the next tutorial at some configuration options that affect this so uh to practice this um certainly give this a go try creating a table with two or more columns and make some or even all of them not null and then try doing inserts in there try inserting explicitly inserting null values as I did near the beginning of the tutorial and try also just missing those fields out of your field list in your insert statement um miss miss them out so try to insert a row where you're only speing specifying values for certain columns and see what results you get with not null Fields does my SQL insert a default uh value for a field that you haven't specify a value for or does it do something else does it throw an error do have a go at that and then in the next tutorial we'll look at some config options so until next time happy coding
