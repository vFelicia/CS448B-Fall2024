00:00 - in this video I'm going to give you an
00:02 - exercise which you can try if you want
00:05 - the exercise is to write a function that
00:08 - calculates and Returns the factorial of
00:11 - a number so what is the factorial of a
00:16 - number well factorial of a number this
00:19 - is something that only applies to
00:22 - positive integers so we're only going to
00:25 - be passing positive whole numbers to the
00:28 - function that we write
00:30 - and the mathematical definition of it
00:33 - goes something like this let me explain
00:35 - this firstly we would read this as n
00:38 - factorial so let's say n is 3 we write
00:41 - three factorial like this we just put an
00:44 - exclamation mark after the whole
00:46 - positive
00:47 - number and we read that as 3 factorial
00:50 - or five factorial or whatever the number
00:52 - is and the definition of the factorial
00:55 - of a number is that it's the number
01:00 - multiplied successively by all the
01:02 - numbers that are one less than a current
01:06 - number so for example 3 factorial is
01:11 - defined as being equal to 3 * 2 * 1 5
01:16 - factorial is equal to 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
01:21 - so 4 factorial will be 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 I
01:25 - think you get the idea
01:27 - right now there is a bit of a twist
01:30 - which is the factorial of0 which you
01:33 - might expect to be zero is actually
01:36 - defined as being equal to one so your
01:39 - function is going to have to take that
01:41 - into account so you need to write a
01:44 - function which you could call
01:46 - factorial and you want to be able to
01:49 - pass a whole integer positive number to
01:53 - that function and it will return the
01:56 - factorial of that number
02:00 - and then use your function to calculate
02:02 - the factorial of seven now since this is
02:05 - quite a difficult problem at this stage
02:08 - I'm going to give you a hint about how
02:10 - to do
02:11 - this I would recommend using a loop this
02:14 - is not the only way to do this but
02:16 - that's what I would recommend at this
02:18 - stage and you're going to want to create
02:20 - a variable so declare a variable before
02:23 - the loop starts and then the loop needs
02:26 - to repeatedly modify the number that
02:29 - that variable refers to so I think even
02:32 - with the hint it's a bit of a tricky
02:34 - exercise but I would recommend having a
02:37 - go make sure you understand the
02:39 - definition of factorial hopefully it's
02:41 - pretty
02:42 - clear and then see how far you can get
02:45 - with writing a function that calculates
02:48 - and Returns the factorial of a number
02:51 - you're going to want to have
02:53 - practiced defining functions with
02:56 - parameters and returning values from
02:58 - functions before you attend this for
03:00 - sure and if you find you get stuck and
03:02 - you just feel you can't do it don't
03:04 - worry because we're going to look at a
03:06 - possible solution in the next video but
03:08 - I strongly
03:10 - recommend at least doing as much as you
03:12 - can of this exercise before going on to
03:15 - the next video so try to do as much of
03:18 - this as you can maybe you'll get the
03:20 - solution in the end or maybe you won't
03:23 - but have a go at it and I just want to
03:26 - give you a quick justification for why
03:28 - this factorial thing exists the
03:31 - factorial of a number is actually the
03:33 - number of ways you can arrange that
03:36 - number of objects and when I say object
03:38 - I mean object in the ordinary everyday
03:41 - sense of the word so for example
03:43 - supposing we have three letters a b and
03:45 - c how many different ways can you
03:48 - arrange those letters well we can
03:50 - arrange them like this ABC we could have
03:53 - ACB we could have B A or BCA and we
03:58 - could have c a and
04:00 - CBA that's all the different number of
04:03 - ways I can arrange these letters there
04:05 - are six different ways and notice that 3
04:08 - factorial is six so the factorial of a
04:12 - number actually gives us the number of
04:14 - different ways we could arrange that
04:17 - number of
04:19 - objects and that kind of explains why
04:21 - zero factorial is defined as one because
04:24 - how many different ways can you arrange
04:26 - nothing arguably there's only one way to
04:30 - arrange nothing you could quibble about
04:33 - that but that's kind of justification
04:35 - for
04:37 - it have a go and see where you get and
04:39 - remember that the important thing at
04:41 - this stage is just to be practicing and
04:44 - trying to do things if you don't get it
04:46 - in the end don't tear your hair out
04:48 - we'll look at it in the next video hello
04:50 - you've been watching a free sample from
04:52 - my Python and machine learning for
04:55 - complete beginners course I'm uploading
04:57 - enough videos from the start of the
04:59 - course to get you started with python
05:01 - and machine learning the full course is
05:03 - absolutely massive if you're interested
05:05 - in it please click the link in the
05:08 - description the complete course covers
05:10 - not only basic python but also some
05:13 - fairly Advanced python even some desktop
05:16 - programming stuff and then goes on to
05:18 - machine learning and artificial
05:20 - intelligence until next time happy
05:23 - coding
