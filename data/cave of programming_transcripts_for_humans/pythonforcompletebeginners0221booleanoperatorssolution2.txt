00:00 - in this video I want to show you another
00:02 - approach to this exercise which some
00:04 - people might find simpler and clearer
00:09 - obviously you have to be a bit practiced
00:10 - with Boolean logic to be able to dash
00:13 - this stuff off quickly but there is
00:16 - another way we could tackle this that
00:18 - may be more intuitive to some people
00:20 - let's get rid of this logic bit here and
00:22 - leave in place only the code that
00:24 - acquires the Boolean inputs that we need
00:27 - then I'm going to say at the start can
00:29 - rent equals false so we have that
00:32 - already declared and assigned a value
00:36 - and now we just want to figure out if
00:38 - that should be changed or how it should
00:39 - be changed so we can break this down
00:42 - into two cases as before either they're
00:44 - a student or they're not and different
00:46 - rules apply for students than non-
00:48 - students in this exercise so let's say
00:51 - if is student
00:53 - colon and then I'm going to say okay
00:56 - well
00:57 - students cannot rent the property see if
01:00 - they smoke or have
01:02 - pets so let's say here and I I have a
01:05 - nested if if does smoke or has
01:11 - pets in that case can rent
01:15 - equals false which is the default
01:20 - anyway
01:22 - else can rent equals
01:27 - true so we solved the same problem for
01:30 - the case where they're a student I've
01:32 - just used if statements in here I've
01:34 - used a nested if statement nested within
01:36 - the other if
01:38 - statement let's tackle the case where
01:40 - they're not a student so that's going to
01:42 - be
01:44 - else because there's nothing else they
01:46 - can be other than a student if they're
01:49 - not a student then we put them in the
01:51 - general category of person and the rules
01:54 - that apply then are they can rent the
01:57 - property if they smoke or have pets but
02:00 - not both so then we can say if does
02:04 - smoke and has
02:07 - pets can rent equals
02:12 - false else so in this case they're not a
02:16 - student and it's not true that they
02:19 - smoke and have pets as well so in this
02:21 - other case we can say can
02:25 - rent equals
02:28 - true and there we've solved the problem
02:31 - right and I've simply used more if
02:34 - statements and less sort of concentrated
02:37 - Boolean logic it is ultimately still the
02:40 - same logic it's just written in a
02:42 - different way using nested
02:45 - ifs so let's see if it
02:49 - works are you a student let's say I am a
02:52 - student do you have pets yes and then do
02:57 - you smoke no so I can't rent in that
02:59 - that case so what if I'm a student and I
03:04 - don't have pets but I do smoke still
03:07 - can't rent if I'm a student I have to
03:10 - answer no to both of these questions
03:12 - before I can rent it now if I'm not a
03:15 - student if I have
03:18 - pets and I don't
03:20 - smoke it's
03:23 - fine if I'm not a student and I don't
03:27 - have pets but I do smoke
03:31 - it's
03:32 - fine if I'm not a student I have pets
03:35 - and smoke then it's not fine so you
03:39 - can't do
03:40 - both if you're not a
03:44 - student what about if I'm not a
03:47 - student and I don't do either of those
03:49 - things then of course I can rent it so
03:51 - it
03:52 - works and I would suggest if you haven't
03:55 - already written your program in this way
03:58 - then put this code way and see if you
04:00 - can write it like this yourself it
04:02 - requires a little bit of
04:04 - thought but that's good for you so
04:07 - basically the more time you spent
04:09 - thinking about this stuff and trying out
04:12 - Solutions the better that's what's going
04:15 - to make you a good programmer ultimately
04:18 - but if you're already bored with this
04:20 - particular
04:21 - topic there's no harm in just moving on
04:24 - from it but it is a good idea to be
04:27 - practicing this stuff at some stage
04:30 - somehow hello you've been watching a
04:33 - free sample from my Python and machine
04:35 - learning for complete beginners course
04:38 - I'm uploading enough videos from the
04:40 - start of the course to get you started
04:42 - with python and machine learning the
04:44 - full course is absolutely massive if
04:46 - you're interested in it please click the
04:48 - link in the description the complete
04:51 - course covers not only basic python but
04:54 - also some fairly Advanced python even
04:56 - some desktop programming stuff and then
04:59 - goes on to machine learning and
05:01 - artificial intelligence until next time
05:04 - happy coding
