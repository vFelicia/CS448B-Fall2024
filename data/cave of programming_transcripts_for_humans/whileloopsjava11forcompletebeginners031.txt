00:01 - hello in this video we're going to look
00:03 - at while loops in java so
00:06 - looping is where we really start to
00:09 - leverage the power of programming
00:11 - to change what would otherwise be
00:14 - extremely repetitive or even impossibly
00:16 - repetitive tasks
00:18 - into something we can just get the
00:19 - computer to do
00:21 - automatically so uh what i'll do here
00:24 - since i'm using eclipse and since i
00:26 - don't want to see all these projects
00:28 - um i've created a new project called
00:31 - while loops for this video
00:33 - i'm just going to click this little down
00:35 - arrow by the package explorer
00:37 - go to select working set
00:41 - i'm going to select projects 2 which
00:44 - doesn't have any projects in it at the
00:45 - moment this is what i created
00:48 - in the last video click edit
00:52 - and i'm going to say that i want while
00:55 - loops
00:55 - in this working set click add for that
00:58 - click finish
00:59 - and i just want to see the projects two
01:01 - working set
01:02 - so i click ok and there we go that's
01:05 - cleared things up a lot
01:06 - okay so i've got a blank project here
01:10 - and i'm gonna output some text
01:13 - so sis out control space
01:17 - and hello
01:21 - and let's run this project so it just
01:24 - says
01:24 - hello nothing spectacular there
01:27 - now a while loop looks like this so
01:31 - i use a java key word a reserved word
01:34 - so it's a special word in the java
01:36 - language and there aren't all that many
01:39 - reserved words in the java language but
01:41 - this is one of them and we can already
01:42 - see some others for example public and
01:44 - class
01:45 - and package so let's type while
01:48 - and next we've got two round brackets
01:51 - like this
01:53 - and then we've got an opening curly
01:55 - bracket on the same line
01:57 - uh it's on the same line because because
02:00 - of the
02:00 - code formatting convention that i'm
02:02 - using you could be using a different one
02:04 - but i wouldn't recommend it
02:06 - and then hit return and eclipse is
02:08 - actually put in the closing curly
02:10 - bracket for me
02:11 - now what what's this going to do well
02:14 - we're going to put stuff between these
02:16 - curly brackets so in this
02:17 - code block between these two curly
02:19 - brackets we're going to put statements
02:22 - that we want to run repeatedly over and
02:25 - over again
02:26 - and we have to have some way of saying
02:29 - how many times
02:30 - we're going to run them repeatedly and
02:32 - in this case what i'm going to do
02:34 - is something that you uh you don't
02:36 - usually do
02:37 - in a computer program but we're just
02:39 - learning here so it's fine
02:41 - i'm gonna make it run forever or rather
02:45 - until we stop the program and to do that
02:48 - i'm going to say while
02:49 - and in the round brackets i'm going to
02:51 - put true
02:53 - what's true well it's um
02:58 - that's a good question you know what
02:59 - we'll we'll tackle that in a future
03:01 - video
03:02 - but we have a primitive type
03:05 - in java called boolean and it can take
03:08 - the values true and false so like an
03:10 - integer can take the values
03:12 - we can take whole number values boolean
03:15 - the boolean type boolean types of
03:17 - variables
03:18 - can take these values true or false
03:21 - just one of these two values and here
03:23 - we're using true
03:25 - so that's saying while true is true
03:28 - in other words keep looping and the
03:31 - value true is always true
03:33 - so it will loop forever don't worry too
03:36 - much about this if this sounds baffling
03:38 - i'm almost managing to confuse myself
03:40 - don't worry about it for the moment
03:42 - but we'll be looking at much more
03:43 - sophisticated
03:45 - while loops later on for some reason
03:48 - i've got an aeroplane going past
03:51 - it always happens when i make videos
03:53 - okay so what i'm going to do here is i'm
03:55 - going to
03:55 - select this system.out.printline hello
03:58 - and i'm
03:58 - gonna just cut it so ctrl x
04:02 - or command x on the map and i'm gonna
04:04 - paste it between these curly brackets
04:09 - that didn't go so well let me try again
04:12 - there we go and just to make sure the
04:14 - formatting is okay
04:15 - i'm going to run the auto format ctrl
04:18 - shift f
04:20 - okay that removed a few plant lines
04:24 - so we're saying while true is true in
04:28 - other words while forever
04:30 - um output hello and if we run this
04:33 - little program now
04:35 - then it outputs hello over and over
04:38 - again it's going to keep doing that
04:39 - until i
04:40 - stop it and probably my computer fan
04:43 - will start going pretty quickly because
04:45 - it's going to be using up
04:47 - too much processing power i'm going to
04:49 - stop it by clicking this red button in
04:51 - the console
04:52 - that stops your programs so it's it's
04:55 - now
04:56 - stopped and i don't know if you can hear
04:59 - it but my computer fan is kicking in
05:01 - so it's not good to let these programs
05:04 - run for too long
05:05 - better if you just look for the sort of
05:08 - grayed out
05:09 - run terminate button in the console
05:12 - there
05:13 - and run it and then quickly stop it
05:16 - again
05:19 - i'm not actually sure if this can be
05:21 - stopped if i click in the console
05:25 - no i do control c in a normal con
05:27 - console
05:28 - typically control c might stop that
05:31 - program but here it's doing nothing
05:33 - so i'm just going to click use the
05:34 - terminate button
05:36 - okay so uh try that out for yourself
05:40 - um try creating this little program
05:43 - and before you run it so you don't end
05:45 - up having to
05:47 - forcibly quit eclipse or something uh
05:50 - make sure you can see
05:51 - this gray it's grayed out at the moment
05:54 - terminate button in the console and then
05:58 - when you start seeing hello being output
06:01 - hit that terminate button because you
06:03 - don't want to
06:03 - you don't want this to overheat your
06:04 - computer
06:07 - okay try that out for yourself and
06:10 - verify it works
06:11 - and we'll be looking at some more stuff
06:14 - relevant to this
06:15 - in the next video okay so until next
06:17 - time
06:18 - happy coding
