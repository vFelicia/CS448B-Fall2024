00:00 - hello this is John from cave of
00:03 - programming calm in this tutorial will
00:05 - kind of look at what you need to install
00:07 - to get started with this tutorial so I'm
00:10 - in Google here and for reasons that I
00:12 - don't fully understand I've got
00:13 - Hungarian version of Google but the
00:17 - first thing we need to install is the my
00:19 - sequel community server this is a free
00:23 - database which you can install and which
00:27 - will sort of enable you to create tables
00:30 - and store data in there and do all kinds
00:32 - of things like that so if you search for
00:34 - the my sequel community server just go
00:37 - to the download link and most of the
00:39 - time all you have to do is select your
00:41 - operating system download the right
00:43 - installer and just run it like any
00:46 - normal installation program let's just
00:49 - click this download link they do have
00:51 - this slightly sneaky thing where they
00:53 - try to get you to create an account but
00:55 - at the moment of these fails that give
00:57 - you this no fence just start my download
00:59 - option here so you can do that so
01:02 - download the version for your operating
01:04 - system and install it they have versions
01:06 - for for Linux for Windows I'm using Mac
01:10 - but you can install it on more or less
01:12 - any reasonable desktop computer if the
01:18 - installation program asks you to enter a
01:21 - password for your root user which is as
01:25 - we'll see later on this is the user that
01:27 - you'll be connecting us initially it's
01:30 - really important that you remember the
01:32 - password that you entered it's very
01:34 - important but in my just not ask you
01:36 - this installation program used to be a
01:39 - bit flaky and a long time ago that
01:42 - didn't even used to be a program but now
01:46 - usually and that installers for the
01:49 - various platforms they pretty much work
01:52 - out the box if you do run into any
01:55 - problems then we'll make sure you are
01:58 - running the installer and not a zip
02:00 - download and don't be afraid to Google
02:04 - for further information if you have to I
02:06 - can't show you the installation for your
02:08 - platform because it depends on your
02:09 - platform and it even depends on
02:11 - version of my sequel and the version of
02:14 - the Installer but if you run into any
02:17 - problems don't be afraid to Google for
02:19 - that like can't install my sequel
02:22 - windows 7 or whatever and if any error
02:24 - messages come up don't be afraid to copy
02:27 - those and or just type them out paste
02:29 - them into Google do a search and see
02:31 - what comes up there because probably
02:33 - other people have encountered your
02:35 - problem as well if you have a problem if
02:38 - you really get stuck with this you can
02:40 - just search for online my sequel
02:42 - database something like that and you
02:46 - will find versions that you can use on
02:49 - the Internet and some of these are just
02:51 - meant for learning my sequel and others
02:54 - require you to create a account and
02:57 - maybe create a database with a few
03:00 - clicks and possibly even pay but you can
03:03 - find various free versions on here that
03:06 - you can use to practice your sequel if
03:08 - you really run into problems now in this
03:10 - tutorial we'll focus on using the my
03:14 - sequel workbench which is another free
03:16 - tools that you also need to install that
03:18 - for your system search for my sequel
03:20 - workbench and go to that and install
03:24 - that so again all the same things apply
03:28 - it's probably going to install pretty
03:30 - smoothly if you run into any problems
03:32 - don't be afraid to Google if you if you
03:36 - want to use an online my sequel database
03:38 - instead should be no problem because we
03:41 - won't be getting too tied up with the
03:43 - work bench here I'm gonna focus on
03:45 - learning my sequel of the sort that
03:48 - you'd also type on a command-line if you
03:50 - wanted to but this is a really handy
03:52 - tool to have because it just makes it
03:54 - much easier and nicer to work with the
03:56 - my sequel database when you've installed
03:59 - it you'll you will well you probably
04:03 - have a choice between running the my
04:05 - sequel server when you when your
04:08 - operating system starts thought when
04:09 - your computer starts which is the
04:11 - easiest option that's gonna run your app
04:13 - at your database itself when it starts
04:15 - and then you can start the my sequel
04:17 - workbench to connect to it or you cannot
04:20 - to start it via some kind of tool that
04:23 - they supply
04:24 - so for example in my mug here if I go to
04:27 - my mark system preferences I've got this
04:31 - my sequel administration tool and there
04:34 - so I'm gonna now that I've installed
04:36 - this I've installed my sequel I can
04:39 - click start my sequel server and I've
04:41 - just got a and to my operating system
04:44 - password to start that usually again it
04:47 - will start up pretty smoothly might also
04:49 - want to restart your computer if you
04:51 - have any problems and then when you've
04:53 - done that you should be able to run the
04:55 - my sequel workbench let's try to run
04:58 - that and you should be able to open a
05:00 - connection so this is how it looks at
05:01 - the moment it does change from version
05:03 - to version
05:04 - but you should be able to figure out how
05:05 - to create a new connection I've created
05:07 - one already here but I'll create a new
05:09 - one click the plus sign by my sequel
05:12 - connections this could be slightly
05:13 - different in your version and it's
05:16 - already prefilled in the details here I
05:18 - didn't say a password my Newser name is
05:20 - root which is a default this host name
05:23 - means basically just the computer
05:25 - whether my sequel server the database
05:28 - itself is running and this 3306 is the
05:31 - default port for my sequel so then i can
05:34 - click the test connection and it says
05:37 - successfully made the my sequel
05:39 - connection so you want to get to that
05:40 - point where you can see that your my
05:42 - sequel workbench can successfully
05:45 - connect your server don't forget you
05:47 - might have to start your server via your
05:50 - control panel or preferences or whatever
05:53 - you're using if you didn't select target
05:56 - start when you start your computer when
05:59 - you installed it okay so that's it for
06:02 - this tutorial
06:02 - good luck with that and as I say if you
06:05 - run into any problems google it and as a
06:06 - last resort
06:07 - you can use just an online my sequel
06:09 - database to follow this tutorial and in
06:12 - the next tutorial we'll look at actually
06:14 - setting up a connection and issuing
06:16 - commands so until next time happy coding
