00:00 - hello in this video we're going to take
00:02 - a look at another type called double so
00:07 - you might wonder what you're supposed to
00:09 - do if you have a floating point value so
00:13 - instead of having seven or five or 1329
00:18 - or whatever you have something like
00:19 - let's say at 8 2.3 something with a
00:22 - point in it and for that there's another
00:24 - type that you can use called double in
00:27 - fact there are at least two different
00:30 - types well in a way there are a number
00:32 - of different types you can use to do all
00:34 - of these things but we're we're just
00:37 - covering the most some of the most basic
00:39 - most common most fundamental types here
00:41 - and incidentally before I get started I
00:44 - just want to point something out which
00:46 - I'm going to return to later which is
00:49 - that if you have multiple projects like
00:52 - this then you you want to make sure that
00:56 - you're always running what you think
00:58 - you're running it's a bit easy to get
01:00 - into the habit of clicking that Run
01:01 - button and then running the wrong thing
01:03 - by accident and to be sure and select
01:06 - the class so app Java in this case
01:10 - containing your main method before you
01:12 - hit the Run button and if you want to be
01:14 - absolutely sure select it right click it
01:17 - go to run as java application and then
01:21 - you absolutely know what you're running
01:23 - otherwise you can get quite confused
01:25 - quite easily also by the way you can not
01:30 - only can you sort of contract projects
01:32 - like this but you can right-click them
01:34 - and close them like this go to close
01:37 - project and then you can open them again
01:39 - later
01:40 - when you want to we're going to look at
01:42 - this stuff more later on anyway I just
01:44 - wanted to mention that
01:45 - okay so doubles if you want a floating
01:49 - point value you can't use a type int so
01:52 - I can't write int what should we have
01:57 - here maybe height equals 1.8 so that's
02:04 - not going to work we get an error here
02:06 - and if I hover over the error it says
02:08 - type mismatch cannot cannot convert from
02:11 - double to int so this is a
02:14 - what we call a literal value here it's
02:16 - some we can also say that it's
02:18 - hard-coded it's a value that have
02:20 - actually coded into my computer program
02:22 - a literal hard-coded value and
02:26 - intrinsically by default it has the
02:28 - double type because it's got a point in
02:31 - it we need to use a double type just to
02:34 - store it incidentally in the USA and the
02:39 - UK and some other places we use a point
02:42 - so we say one point eight that sort of
02:44 - thing to indicate fractional values like
02:46 - point eight large parts of Europe
02:50 - apparently use a comma so but we don't
02:53 - do that in Java as far as I know or all
02:57 - versions of Java are the same we use a
02:59 - point to indicate a fractional value
03:01 - okay so let's write here double now
03:04 - we've got something that will actually
03:05 - work now we've only now we've we've just
03:08 - got a warning which is saying that we're
03:11 - not using it and we can output that out
03:14 - just as we did with integers so let's
03:19 - say height is plus height and let's try
03:26 - running that there we go height is 1.8
03:33 - we're going to start doing some stuff
03:36 - with this but I'm going to leave it
03:37 - there for this tutorial try that out
03:39 - check you can declare double values you
03:41 - can always put more of them in the same
03:43 - program as long as you give them
03:44 - different names but do have a go at it
03:47 - and we're going to look later on also at
03:51 - some general tips that you should use
03:53 - when programming and some tips are
03:55 - following this course but at the moment
03:57 - I'm just concentrating on getting you
03:59 - started with the most important things
04:01 - okay so until next time happy coding
