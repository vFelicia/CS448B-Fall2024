00:00 - hello in this video we're going to take
00:02 - a look at Auto format which is really
00:05 - important and very very useful so
00:08 - hopefully by now you've created a
00:10 - program yourself with three lines in it
00:13 - or more however many like and we'll use
00:15 - that to talk about formatting so we've
00:20 - seen that if you have curly brackets
00:23 - like this an opening and closing curly
00:25 - bracket that's known as a code block so
00:29 - we have a code block here and there's
00:31 - another code block here now when we put
00:36 - one code block inside another so this
00:39 - code block is inside this code block and
00:42 - here we have statements within a code
00:46 - block and when you put when you put code
00:50 - inside a code block or you put yeah one
00:53 - code block inside another it's really
00:56 - important to indent it so you see that
00:58 - all the code within these curly brackets
01:01 - is indented by one tab and all the code
01:06 - within these curly brackets is indented
01:09 - by another tab and that's that although
01:13 - that's cosmetic so the program works
01:15 - without it let's try this it's
01:19 - nevertheless extremely important to get
01:22 - this right because if you don't have
01:27 - correct formatting in your code it will
01:29 - be very very difficult to read it will
01:31 - look a mess
01:32 - so always strive to to format your code
01:36 - nicely and pay particular attention to
01:40 - indentation make sure that you indent
01:42 - one block of code within another like
01:45 - this you might have seen a American TV
01:49 - series called Silicon Valley and in that
01:53 - the protagonist is a computer programmer
01:57 - and at one point he has a girlfriend
01:59 - who's also a computer programmer and
02:02 - they they have an argument and they end
02:05 - up sort of splitting up because they
02:08 - can't agree about whether it's better to
02:10 - use spaces or tabs
02:13 - to indentation so twin indent some code
02:17 - within a code block let's take this as
02:20 - an example you could use four spaces
02:22 - typically or before one two three four
02:25 - and you can also use a tab like this I
02:30 - just press the tab key there there are
02:33 - pros and cons to both of these so it can
02:36 - get annoying to have to keep typing
02:39 - spaces and even hearing people typing
02:43 - spaces you know that can get quite
02:47 - annoying by itself but spaces tend to
02:51 - have a consistent appearance across
02:54 - different editors this is probably less
02:57 - important now than it used to be in the
02:59 - past blur I think it's still true that
03:00 - spaces give you better consistency when
03:04 - you write code in one editor and load it
03:07 - into another on the other hand they're
03:09 - annoying to type and that's why I
03:10 - greatly prefer tabs because just one tab
03:13 - can indent your code so this will be
03:16 - indented two tabs because it's within
03:20 - two code blocks it's within that and
03:22 - within that so I recommend using taps to
03:27 - indent your code but if you're working
03:29 - with a team of programmers and they were
03:31 - all using spaces you should use spaces
03:33 - instead because the worst thing you can
03:36 - do is mix tabs and spaces and that tends
03:40 - to mean that when you load code written
03:43 - in one editor into another editor it
03:47 - will it will lose its formatting and it
03:49 - will get out of line so pick one of
03:52 - these four four spaces or a tab to do
03:55 - the end into indentation and stick to it
03:59 - many editors these days will allow you
04:02 - to change spaces into tabs if you want
04:04 - so I'm sure you can conflict configure
04:06 - that in Eclipse you can make it change a
04:08 - tab into a space and also into four
04:13 - spaces sorry
04:14 - and also Eclipse helps you so if you
04:17 - type a line so if I'm at the end of this
04:20 - line here and I hit return it puts the
04:23 - cursor in the right place
04:24 - so that we don't have
04:26 - worry too much about indenting so that's
04:32 - very helpful
04:33 - now here's the most important sort of
04:36 - takeaway message for this video you can
04:40 - automatically format your code so let's
04:42 - put maybe a bracket in the wrong place
04:44 - here and put excessive spaces in and
04:47 - maybe indent this too much if I write if
04:53 - I select Java right-click it and go to
04:55 - source and irori
04:59 - source and format it automatically
05:04 - formats my code for me it will take out
05:08 - duplicated blank lines and it will line
05:12 - up brackets and stuff like that and
05:14 - that's incredibly helpful not only
05:18 - because it makes the code a lot easier
05:20 - to read but also because if you made a
05:23 - mistake there so if you've maybe missed
05:25 - off a bracket and you try to format it
05:29 - then it will it won't format or the
05:33 - formatting will go a bit strange and
05:36 - that's that's really helpful for
05:39 - spotting where you've gone wrong let's
05:41 - pull out bracket in again also you can
05:44 - see an arrow down there there's a red
05:46 - arrow marker that appears if you've done
05:49 - something wrong this says insert and
05:52 - brackets a complete class body in this
05:55 - particular case let's pull that back in
05:58 - now you can also format using a keyboard
06:02 - shortcut I strongly recommend that you
06:05 - memorize this shortcut and you use it
06:07 - constantly some people think that
06:10 - beginners are better off using a text
06:14 - editor that doesn't have Auto formatting
06:16 - and the reasoning is that that forces
06:20 - people to really learn to do the
06:22 - formatting themselves but in my
06:24 - experience if beginners use auto format
06:27 - a lot they gradually become used to the
06:30 - formatting I think that's the quickest
06:32 - way to learn it so I'm going to be
06:34 - suggesting that you auto format your
06:38 - code constantly
06:40 - do it all the time and the way that we
06:41 - do it as we've seen we could right click
06:43 - and go to source format but it's quicker
06:46 - to use a keyboard shortcut and on the
06:49 - Mac that's command shift F and on the
06:51 - windows on Windows it's ctrl shift F so
06:57 - here I'm using a Mac so I'm gonna with
07:00 - one hand my left hand I'm gonna hold
07:02 - down command and shift and with my right
07:05 - hand I'm gonna just press F and that's
07:08 - formatted my code for me let's try that
07:10 - again
07:11 - so control shift F or command shift F on
07:14 - the Mac great so it's important to do
07:19 - that all the time do it constantly try
07:23 - to write code in the first place that's
07:25 - formatted nicely but also use auto
07:30 - format constantly to check that your
07:32 - formatting is OK and eventually this
07:34 - will become second nature to you because
07:37 - you'll be doing it all the time and that
07:39 - really really helps to make code that's
07:41 - easy to read and it really really helps
07:44 - to keep basic errors out of your code ok
07:48 - so until next time happy coding
