00:00 - in this video we're going to look at
00:02 - setting up something called a python
00:04 - environment and although this is
00:07 - strictly speaking optional it will make
00:09 - your life so much easier if you do it so
00:12 - I really strongly recommend that you do
00:15 - follow me and set up a python
00:18 - environment and they always work in a
00:21 - python environment
00:25 - so to do this firstly you need to be
00:28 - able to type that python command that
00:30 - will run the latest version of python
00:33 - so if I type
00:36 - Python 3 hyphen hyphen version
00:40 - I get back the version of python that I
00:43 - installed
00:46 - you need to be able to do this before
00:48 - you can set up a python environment
00:51 - once you've done that
00:53 - type the command
00:55 - that you use to run the version of
00:58 - python you've installed and then type
01:00 - hyphen m space
01:04 - vnf
01:08 - and then a space and type vmf again
01:12 - this is going to set up a python
01:14 - environment
01:18 - so The Hyphen m is actually saying load
01:21 - this thing called a module which has the
01:24 - name vmf and this is actually a
01:26 - directory name that's where we're going
01:28 - to put the python environment related
01:30 - stuff so if I run this
01:34 - it may take a few minutes to set up
01:41 - okay that was actually pretty quick
01:45 - and if I check what's happened if I list
01:47 - the content of this directory
01:50 - using LS or using whatever command you
01:52 - use on your system I can see that there
01:54 - is now a VM directory in there
01:59 - let's take a look at what's in the VMS
02:01 - directory
02:03 - so I type LS or whatever command you use
02:06 - and
02:08 - Vie EnV
02:09 - which is the folder that I put it in and
02:11 - we can see in there there is a bin
02:13 - subdirectory
02:15 - if I type LS VM
02:18 - slash bin I can see what's in the bin
02:22 - subdirectory it used to be the case on
02:24 - Windows I think it still is that here
02:26 - you would have to use the the other
02:27 - slash the one that slopes the other way
02:29 - I think
02:31 - Powershell will accept this forward
02:33 - slash even on Windows
02:35 - but of course you can type whatever you
02:37 - want as long as you can figure out how
02:39 - to list the contents of directories like
02:41 - this
02:43 - and we can see in here there are various
02:45 - these are actually programs they're
02:48 - scripts small programs called activate
02:50 - and to activate the python environment
02:56 - we need to use the right one for our
02:58 - platform now since I'm using Powershell
03:01 - I can use this activate dot PS1 so I
03:05 - need to type the name of that program to
03:07 - run it from the current directory let's
03:10 - try typing VM slash bin this may also be
03:15 - in a scripts folder I think it used to
03:18 - be but now it seems to be in a bin
03:20 - folder
03:23 - at least on my platform and then
03:25 - activate
03:28 - and in fact Powershell is not case
03:31 - sensitive if I type part of the file
03:33 - name and hit tab it actually Auto
03:35 - completes it for me then I'm going to
03:37 - have to put in dot P hit tab again and
03:41 - that's that's what I want
03:43 - notice this dot at the beginning that
03:46 - may not appear on Windows on Linux and
03:49 - Mac generally if you want to run a
03:51 - program you have to type
03:54 - a DOT which stands for the current
03:56 - directory and then the directory names
03:59 - relative to that that that may not be
04:02 - necessary on Windows I don't know but
04:06 - either way you just need to run this
04:09 - activate.ps1 program and Powershell does
04:12 - need to be running this is a Powershell
04:13 - script right
04:15 - so if you're using Powershell this is
04:17 - the one you need to run if you're using
04:19 - something else then maybe you need to
04:22 - run one of these others
04:25 - so let's try this
04:26 - I run this and we can see that
04:30 - Powershell is still running and we're
04:32 - running a python
04:34 - virtual environment
04:37 - which is what VM stands for virtual
04:39 - environment
04:43 - now what's the good of this well here it
04:46 - is
04:47 - if I type python now remember previously
04:50 - that was giving me the wrong version of
04:52 - python on my system but now
04:55 - it actually starts the right version of
04:57 - python this has actually started up a
04:59 - python shell I'm just going to quit that
05:01 - by typing quit and some round brackets
05:04 - if I type python
05:07 - hyphen
05:09 - hyphen version
05:11 - then we can see this is running the
05:13 - right version of python so one thing
05:16 - that this does for you is it means you
05:18 - can definitely type just python by
05:20 - itself and it will run the right version
05:23 - and the other thing which is perhaps
05:24 - more important is that now if we install
05:27 - extra python code which we call packages
05:31 - and we'll look at those later on they
05:33 - will install
05:35 - in the right place
05:38 - whereas otherwise it if you don't use a
05:40 - virtual environment or you don't set one
05:43 - up
05:44 - and you install a python package it may
05:47 - well install for a different version of
05:48 - python that's hanging around on your
05:50 - system and it won't work for the version
05:53 - that you're using so this python virtual
05:56 - environment tremendously simplifies the
05:58 - business of working with python and
06:01 - that's why I strongly strongly recommend
06:03 - it so I'm going to assume for the rest
06:05 - of the course
06:06 - that you have a console that you like
06:09 - using and you know basically how to
06:12 - navigate it maybe with a lesson CD or
06:15 - other commands and I'll assume you've
06:17 - got Powershell running if you haven't
06:19 - that's okay as long as you know what
06:21 - you're doing and I'll assume
06:24 - that you have an active
06:26 - python virtual environment running
06:29 - because this will simplify things a lot
06:32 - this is a free video from my course
06:35 - Python and machine learning for complete
06:38 - beginners I'm releasing the first couple
06:41 - of chapters of this course completely
06:43 - for free on YouTube to get you started
06:46 - with python I plan to upload new videos
06:49 - here to YouTube every Monday and every
06:52 - Thursday for at least a couple of months
06:55 - if you're interested in the complete
06:57 - course which teaches you python from
07:00 - scratch and eventually progresses to
07:02 - things like creating graphical user
07:04 - interfaces and using neural networks
07:07 - principal component analysis cluster
07:10 - analysis all that stuff and much more
07:13 - besides then you can find a link in the
07:15 - description or just go to this URL on
07:19 - the screen right here if you finish the
07:21 - whole course you'll be able to write all
07:23 - kinds of general purpose programs in
07:25 - Python and use Python to do machine
07:28 - learning and artificial intelligence as
07:30 - well thank you for watching until next
07:33 - time happy coding

in this video we're going to look at setting up something called a python environment and although this is strictly speaking optional it will make your life so much easier if you do it so I really

the current directory let's try typing VM slash bin this may also be in a scripts folder I think it used to be but now it seems to be in a bin folder at least on my platform and then activate and in fact Powershell is not case sensitive if I type part of the file name and hit tab it actually Auto completes it for me then I'm going to have to put in dot P hit tab again and that's that's what I want notice this dot at the beginning that may not appear on Windows on Linux and Mac generally if you want to run a program you have to type a DOT which stands for the current directory and then the
