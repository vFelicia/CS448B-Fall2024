00:00 - hello in this video we're going to take
00:03 - a look at a worked example of converting
00:07 - temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit
00:10 - so generally these days in the UK we use
00:15 - Celsius to measure temperature so we
00:18 - consider room temperature to be about 21
00:21 - whereas in the USA as far as I know
00:24 - Fahrenheit is used and well what we're
00:30 - going to do is convert Fahrenheit to
00:32 - Celsius so I would suggest pausing the
00:37 - video at this point and having a go at
00:39 - it yourself if you go to Google and you
00:43 - type something like convert Fahrenheit
00:46 - to Celsius then you can find a formula
00:52 - for how to do it so what this is telling
00:55 - us is that you take the temperature in
00:57 - Fahrenheit subtract 32 from it then
01:01 - you've got to take that and multiply it
01:03 - by five divided by nine but don't forget
01:08 - that you can't divide one integer by
01:10 - another in Java or rather you can but it
01:13 - discards the remainder so you want to
01:15 - use doubles there
01:16 - okay so pause the video and have a go at
01:19 - yourself if you find yourself sort of
01:22 - struggling a bit that's actually good
01:24 - you know is obviously it's great if you
01:26 - can just write the program but if it
01:28 - takes you a little while you have to
01:30 - think about it that's good because all
01:32 - the while you're looking at this program
01:33 - and typing stuff and trying to get it to
01:36 - work you're learning so okay pause the
01:39 - video now all right so hopefully you had
01:44 - a go at that let's see how to do this so
01:51 - zoom out here and then here the first
01:55 - thing to do is we'll declare our
01:57 - temperature in Fahrenheit so double
01:59 - fahren height and let's set it to some
02:04 - temperature to start with so let's say
02:07 - we want to convert 91 Fahrenheit to a
02:10 - temperature in Celsius I don't know what
02:11 - that is
02:12 - feeling it's quite hot we'll see let's
02:16 - also have a variable for storing Celsius
02:19 - so let's say double Celsius and what
02:24 - Celsius going to be assigned what value
02:27 - will we assign it well we're going to
02:29 - take the temperature in Fahrenheit and
02:34 - we're going to subtract 32 from it now
02:38 - in order to make sure that we do the
02:40 - calculations in a right order here let's
02:42 - put that in round brackets because
02:45 - that's that's the first thing we want to
02:47 - do we want to take temperature in
02:49 - Fahrenheit subtract 32 and then we're
02:51 - going to work with that the next thing
02:54 - we want to do is we want want to
02:57 - multiply that by 5 divided by 9 so let's
03:02 - do that let's multiply it so that's an
03:06 - asterisk by and we can't say 5 divided
03:11 - by 9 that would be integer division it
03:13 - would discard the remainder so in this
03:16 - case that will give us 0 but we can say
03:19 - 5 point naught divided by 9 or we can
03:23 - also say 5 point naught divided by 9
03:25 - point naught or 5/9 point or as long as
03:29 - there's a double in there we get double
03:31 - division that should do the trick so now
03:34 - we can type this out and let's write
03:37 - temperature well actually let's write
03:41 - the whole thing out let's say far n
03:46 - height and I'm going to add to that some
03:49 - text concatenate some text Fahrenheit
03:56 - let's say so this is going to say that
04:01 - that's going to say so far like for
04:03 - example 91 so let's say 91 degrees far n
04:09 - height I think I should have a capital F
04:13 - naught on the variables because they
04:16 - have to have a lowercase the first
04:18 - letter
04:18 - so if 91 degrees Fahrenheit is plus
04:26 - Celsius plus degrees Celsius let's run
04:36 - that I think I had this street cleaner
04:39 - running past so sorry about the noise
04:42 - we'll try running this and there we've
04:45 - got 91 degrees Fahrenheit is thirty two
04:48 - point seven seven seven eight degrees
04:50 - Celsius so by British standards at least
04:54 - that's very hot a temperature we rarely
04:58 - encounter in fact so what have I done
05:00 - here well you see that I basically just
05:05 - join numbers and text together and when
05:08 - I when I join the text to the number I
05:10 - started off so inside the double quotes
05:13 - here I started off with his space and
05:16 - that gives us this nice space here so
05:23 - after is we've also got a space and
05:26 - that's that's this space here and so
05:32 - then we've got the temperature in
05:33 - Celsius and we've got finally some more
05:35 - text to finish it off and we've got a
05:37 - space there as well so the whole thing
05:39 - comes out nicely spaced one thing that
05:41 - isn't good is that we've got a lot of
05:43 - digits here and we're gonna look at how
05:47 - to deal with that in a next session when
05:49 - we take a look at strings and texts I
05:55 - don't think there's anything else to say
05:57 - about this
05:58 - it should be fairly straightforward but
06:00 - if you found it confusing you couldn't
06:02 - deal whatever don't worry too much but
06:04 - if you couldn't do the exercise
06:06 - definitely type this out yourself and
06:11 - try playing around with it a bit you
06:13 - know to see if you can change the
06:15 - formatting or whatever if there's
06:17 - anything in it that bothers you try to
06:19 - guess how it works and maybe make
06:21 - changes and see if your changes work as
06:24 - you expect you know just but definitely
06:27 - type it out whatever you do unless you
06:29 - successfully wrote the program okay
06:31 - we'll leave it there for now and until
06:34 - next time happy
06:35 - coding
