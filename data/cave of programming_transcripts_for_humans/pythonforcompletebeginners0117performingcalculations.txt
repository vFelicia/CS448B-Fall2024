00:00 - in this video we're going to write a
00:02 - program that does a calculation let's
00:05 - try to write a program that asks the
00:07 - user what their name is and then asks
00:10 - them how old they are and then tells
00:13 - them how many years they've got to live
00:16 - if they want to be 100 years old so how
00:19 - many more years would it take to reach
00:21 - 100 years
00:24 - old first let's get their name so name
00:27 - equals and I'll use input here and we'll
00:30 - apply some text to act as a prompt let's
00:32 - say enter your
00:33 - name and we'll have a colon and a space
00:36 - there and after I finish this I'm going
00:38 - to ask you to put the code away and see
00:41 - how much you can write yourself from
00:44 - memory and if you try that at this stage
00:48 - you would already want to run it I think
00:50 - already try that this bit Works before
00:53 - you go on the next bit and you could
00:55 - figure that out by doing print name and
00:58 - check that that works let's actually
01:00 - just try this and run
01:02 - it although being an experienced
01:05 - programmer I know that this does work
01:08 - okay so John and there you go it says
01:10 - John so that bit's working and that's
01:13 - how you'd want to proceed I think if
01:15 - you're new to this sort of line by line
01:18 - and keep testing running your program
01:20 - now let's say age equals
01:24 - input and enter your
01:28 - age
01:31 - now when we've got that age we want to
01:33 - do a calculation with it we're going to
01:36 - need a variable to store the result of
01:38 - that calculation let's call it years
01:40 - left and that's going to be equal to 100
01:44 - minus age so we can figure out how many
01:48 - more years the person has to live before
01:51 - they're 100 years old now notice that
01:54 - I've written all of these variable names
01:57 - in lowercase in this case I wanted to to
01:59 - use two words for the variable name so
02:02 - I've separated the two words by an
02:06 - underscore this is the convention that
02:08 - I'm using in this course for naming
02:14 - variables there are different
02:15 - conventions out there I think this is
02:18 - probably the most common convention to
02:20 - use underscores to separate different
02:22 - words in variable names and to make the
02:25 - variable names
02:28 - lowercase but you could also use a
02:30 - different convention the important thing
02:32 - is that you have to stick to a
02:35 - convention pick a convention and stick
02:37 - to it otherwise your code gets really
02:39 - confusing you don't want to mix
02:41 - different conventions some people might
02:43 - write years left so they capitalize any
02:47 - subsequent words after the first one in
02:49 - the variable
02:50 - name and that's fine as long as you
02:53 - stick to that
02:55 - convention if you're working in a team
02:57 - of people of course you have to follow
02:59 - what whatever convention the team uses
03:02 - and they will normally have some kind of
03:04 - set of coding conventions that you're
03:07 - supposed to
03:09 - follow okay now supposing we want to
03:11 - print this out so I say print let's
03:14 - maybe put their name and then comma you
03:20 - have plus
03:24 - years left plus
03:28 - years left before you reach 100 I'll get
03:34 - rid of this side panel so we can see the
03:37 - whole thing more easily so what I may be
03:40 - thinking at this point is this is going
03:42 - to print for
03:44 - example Sarah you have 12 years left
03:49 - before you reach 100 if someone called
03:52 - Sarah who's 88 uses the program now what
03:55 - do you think will this actually
03:58 - work in in fact it doesn't and can you
04:02 - guess
04:06 - why well let's try running it and see
04:10 - what it does so I run it and it says
04:13 - enter your name my name is
04:15 - John enter your age I'm 48 I don't know
04:19 - where the years have gone a lot of them
04:21 - went on programming let's run it and I
04:23 - get a trace back and what does it say
04:26 - well it says the problems occurring on
04:27 - line four of my file here and it says
04:31 - type error unsupported operan types for
04:36 - minus int and
04:39 - stra so minus is an operator and the
04:42 - things that we give to the operator to
04:44 - work with so this and this they're
04:47 - called operand and it's telling me you
04:50 - can't subtract a string from an
04:55 - INT so when input returns text it
04:58 - returns it as has a string so H here is
05:02 - actually a string it may look like a
05:04 - number but it's a
05:06 - string and then we can't do a
05:09 - calculation with a string we can't take
05:13 - 100 and subtract some text from it
05:15 - that's a
05:17 - problem what we have to do is something
05:20 - called casting we have to change
05:23 - this from a string to let's say an INT
05:26 - or a float I have to cast it from a
05:30 - string to an INT and we can do that by
05:33 - using the int built-in
05:35 - function so I just need to pass age to
05:39 - the int built-in
05:42 - function and that is going to convert
05:45 - this string to an integer and then I can
05:48 - subtract that integer from 100 however
05:51 - this program still doesn't work can you
05:54 - guess why let's try it and see what
05:57 - happens enter your next name
06:01 - John
06:04 - 48 now the error is at line
06:09 - six and it says can only concatenate
06:14 - stra not int two stra so the problem Now
06:19 - lies in
06:20 - here so we've got years left which now
06:24 - has the type
06:25 - int but we're trying to join it to
06:28 - Strings right right so we can add two
06:31 - integers together with plus and we can
06:35 - concatenate two strings with plus but we
06:39 - can't join an INT to a string with plus
06:45 - so this fails what we have to do is
06:49 - convert this years
06:51 - left to a string and then we can join it
06:55 - with other
06:56 - strings name is already a string so
06:59 - that's not a problem but what we want to
07:01 - do here is just join a bunch of strings
07:04 - and this is not a string as you can see
07:07 - if you use the type function to print
07:10 - its type so let's convert it to a string
07:14 - with the stra built-in
07:18 - function and now we'll try
07:21 - this enter your name John age
07:25 - 48 John you have 52 years left before
07:28 - you reach 100
07:30 - what a cheerful
07:33 - thought actually it's not bad 52 years
07:36 - I'm probably not going to live to be 100
07:38 - H who cares now it's pretty easy to
07:40 - break this program let's try and see if
07:43 - we can break it enter your name John
07:46 - enter your age 120 what does this do
07:49 - well it says you've got minus 20 years
07:51 - left before you reach 100 which I
07:53 - suppose if I was 120 would sort of be
07:58 - true let's let's
08:00 - try running it and entering something
08:03 - that can't be converted to an
08:07 - INT and now we get a trace back we get
08:10 - an
08:12 - error later on we'll see how we can fix
08:14 - those errors how we can handle them but
08:16 - for now it's enough just to be able to
08:18 - write little programs that do
08:21 - calculations so what I would suggest is
08:23 - that you put this code away and see how
08:26 - much you can write from memory if the is
08:29 - not very much that's fine then you're
08:31 - going to have to look at the code to be
08:33 - able to finish writing the rest of
08:37 - it but while I don't Advocate making a
08:40 - huge point of memorizing things I think
08:43 - it is good practice to try putting code
08:46 - away and seeing how much you actually do
08:49 - remember if you try to type it out and
08:51 - run it because that will tell you which
08:54 - bits you've forgotten and if the answer
08:56 - is all of it that's okay just look at
08:58 - the code but have a go see if you can
09:01 - write this yourself first from memory
09:03 - and then look at the program if you
09:04 - can't do that this is a free video from
09:07 - my Python and machine learning course
09:10 - I'm uploading some videos from the start
09:12 - of the course to get you started with
09:13 - python the full course is absolutely
09:16 - huge and teaches you Python and the
09:18 - basics of machine learning and
09:20 - artificial intelligence with a ton of

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we're going to write a program that does a calculation let's try to write a program that asks the user what their name is and then asks them how old they are and then tells them how many years they've got to live if they want to be 100 years old so how many more years would it take to reach 100 years old first let's get their name so name equals and I'll use input here and we'll apply some text to act as a prompt let's say enter your name and we'll have a colon and a space there and after I finish this I'm going to ask you to put the code away and see how much you can write yourself from memory and if you try that at this stage you would already want to run it I think already try that this bit Works before you go on the next bit and you could figure that out by doing print name and check that that works let's actually just try this and run it although being an experienced programmer I know that this does work okay so John and there you go it says John so that bit's working and that's how you'd want to proceed I think if you're new to this sort of line by line and keep testing running your program now let's say age equals input and enter your age now when we've got that age we want to do a calculation with it we're going to need a variable to store the result of that calculation let's call it years left and that's going to be equal to 100 minus age so we can figure out how many more years the person has to live before they're 100 years old now notice that I've written all of these variable names in lowercase in this case I wanted to to use two words for the variable name so I've separated the two words by an underscore this is the convention that I'm using in this course for naming variables there are different conventions out there I think this is probably the most common convention to use underscores to separate different words in variable names and to make the variable names lowercase but you could also use a different convention the important thing is that you have to stick to a convention pick a convention and stick to it otherwise your code gets really confusing you don't want to mix different conventions some people might write years left so they capitalize any subsequent words after the first one in the variable name and that's fine as long as you stick to that convention if you're working in a team of people of course you have to follow what whatever convention the team uses and they will normally have some kind of set of coding conventions that you're supposed to follow okay now supposing we want to print this out so I say print let's maybe put their name and then comma you have plus years left plus years left before you reach 100 I'll get rid of this side panel so we can see the whole thing more easily so what I may be thinking at this point is this is going to print for example Sarah you have 12 years left before you reach 100 if someone called Sarah who's 88 uses the program now what do you think will this actually work in in fact it doesn't and can you guess why well let's try running it and see what it does so I run it and it says enter your name my name is John enter your age I'm 48 I don't know where the years have gone a lot of them went on programming let's run it and I get a trace back and what does it say well it says the problems occurring on line four of my file here and it

error is at line six and it says can only concatenate stra not int two stra so the problem Now lies in here so we've got years left which now has the type int but we're trying to join it to Strings right right so we can add two integers together with plus and we can concatenate two strings with plus but we can't join an INT to a string with plus so this fails what we have to do is convert this years left to a string and then we can join it with other strings name is already a string so that's not a problem but what we want to do here is just join a bunch of strings and this is not a string as you can see if you use the type function to print its type so let's convert it to a string with the stra builtin function and now we'll try this enter your name John age 48 John you have 52 years left before you reach 100 what a cheerful thought actually it's not bad 52 years I'm probably not going to live to be 100 H who cares now it's pretty easy to break this program let's try and see if we can break it enter your name John enter your age 120 what does this do well it says you've got minus 20 years left before you reach 100 which I suppose if I was 120 would sort of be true let's let's
