00:17 - hello this is John from Cave of
00:20 - programming. comom in this tutorial
00:22 - we're going to start looking at the new
00:23 - operator in C++ and I'm going to split
00:26 - this into several tutorials CU there
00:27 - going to be quite a lot to cover here so
00:31 - I've got an object I've got a class that
00:32 - I created in a previous tutorial but
00:34 - I've also given it a Destructor so our
00:37 - animal class it has a name instance
00:39 - variable which is private it's got a
00:42 - Constructor and a copy
00:44 - Constructor uh a Destructor it's got a
00:47 - set name method and a speak method that
00:50 - just outputs the name and for the
00:52 - constructors and destructors I've just
00:54 - put some text in there uh in a see out
00:57 - so that we can actually see that they're
00:58 - running
01:01 - uh let's get rid of this for a moment
01:02 - I'm going to show you that um probably
01:04 - in the next tutorial so um this is how
01:07 - we've been creating an object from a
01:10 - class so far we declare a variable of
01:13 - the type class and we can call methods
01:14 - on it like this so if I run this now we
01:18 - get animal created that's the
01:20 - Constructor
01:21 - running up here we say animal. set name
01:25 - um animal.pak it's cat cat dops I called
01:28 - it cat but it's a type animal and then
01:31 - we get my name is Freddy that's coming
01:33 - from here then it says Destructor called
01:37 - because when we have a local variable
01:39 - like this it goes out of scope so it's
01:42 - no longer relevant no longer usable when
01:45 - we hit the closing curly bracket and
01:48 - when that happens with a uh with a
01:51 - variable of of a object with a variable
01:54 - of a class type so an
01:57 - object the memory associ with the object
02:01 - is deallocated uh that's true for any
02:04 - kind of variable type actually and with
02:06 - objects the destructor will be called
02:09 - like this so when we hit that closing
02:11 - bracket the variable goes out of scope
02:14 - just before the object is destroyed and
02:16 - a memory associated with it is
02:18 - deallocated the destructor runs and
02:21 - we've seen this
02:22 - before now there's another way of uh
02:26 - instantiating an object from a class and
02:29 - that is
02:30 - to use um the new operator so I'm going
02:34 - to change this to a pointer let's say
02:36 - animal pointer Pat one and I'm going to
02:39 - say equals new
02:41 - animal like this round brackets and I'm
02:45 - going to change these variables as well
02:47 - although this isn't going to work
02:50 - yet so the new operator allocates memory
02:54 - explicitly so this is memory that you
02:56 - actually manage yourself in this case
02:59 - it's ating memory for a single object
03:02 - here although as we'll see in future
03:03 - tutorials new is very flexible if I had
03:08 - arguments to the Constructor I could put
03:10 - them in these round brackets here but if
03:13 - if we are calling a Constructor that
03:15 - takes no parameters those round brackets
03:17 - are actually optional so we can put them
03:19 - in or not put them in but I will put
03:21 - them in just uh um CU this is probably
03:24 - the more common
03:26 - syntax now we can't call set name on a
03:29 - pointer we can only call it on an object
03:31 - so we can't do this dot thing even if we
03:34 - put um D reference syntax in here then
03:38 - um this isn't going to work so if I save
03:40 - this and go to project build
03:43 - project this is still not going to work
03:45 - because the dot operator has higher
03:47 - precedence than the star operator so C++
03:51 - is going to do all this stuff and then
03:53 - try to dreference the return value of
03:55 - set name which makes no sense
03:58 - here we could get this work by putting
04:00 - round brackets around the dreference bit
04:04 - like this so if we dreference the
04:06 - pointer first to get the object then we
04:09 - can use the normal dot syntax with the
04:11 - object if we build this it works but
04:16 - because this is such a horribly unwieldy
04:18 - syntax with these brackets and the Stars
04:20 - there's a special syntax just for
04:23 - working with pointers to objects in
04:26 - C++ let's get rid of these and that
04:29 - looks
04:30 - like this instead of a DOT we use an
04:33 - arrow That's The Hyphen and a right
04:35 - angle bracket and we've seen that before
04:38 - with the this pointer so now this will
04:42 - compile but it's missing something very
04:44 - important uh let's just run this we
04:47 - shouldn't really run this because it's
04:49 - not a good program we'll see why in a
04:50 - minute so it says animal created my name
04:53 - is Freddy but there's no Destructor
04:55 - called and when you allocate memory with
04:57 - new you must always always remember to
05:01 - to destroy that um object you must when
05:05 - you allocate memory with new you must
05:06 - always remember to deallocate the memory
05:09 - explicitly because C++ won't do it for
05:11 - you and in fact that bit of memory that
05:13 - I've just taken up with new is now
05:16 - probably hanging around in my operating
05:18 - system uh taking up Ram completely
05:23 - unnecessarily uh so what we have to do
05:25 - is we have to call delete and then the
05:28 - pointer very like that and when you call
05:31 - delete that will deallocate the memory
05:33 - that this pointer points at so if we run
05:37 - this now this works we get Destructor
05:39 - called so always call delete if you call
05:44 - new uh a common source of bugs in C++
05:48 - programs is that new sorry is that
05:50 - delete is not called for every call of
05:52 - new and that causes memory leaks in your
05:55 - program another source of bugs is that
05:57 - you might call delete on a pointer that
05:59 - hasn't been um set to point at anything
06:02 - with new in which case your program is
06:05 - liable to crash randomly uh also it's
06:08 - quite common to actually set pointers
06:11 - let's say like this pointer P Cat 2 to
06:15 - set them equal to
06:17 - null so null in uppercase letters as far
06:20 - as I know this is basically a synonym
06:22 - for zero we could use
06:24 - zero um I think it is anyway yeah but
06:28 - anyway this this is common thing to do
06:30 - yeah we see it's just the same as zero
06:32 - it actually tells us down here um and
06:35 - that is a way of saying look this
06:37 - pointer is not pointing at anything and
06:39 - then you can check to see if your
06:40 - pointer is null in your program and um
06:44 - respond accordingly so this is just a
06:46 - way of keeping note for yourself in your
06:49 - program and the fact that this point is
06:50 - not pointing anywhere at the moment but
06:53 - if you try to call delete on a null
06:55 - pointer again you're pretty certain to
06:57 - get a horrific crash when your program
06:59 - runs and that's another big source of
07:02 - bugs in your C++ program so you have to
07:05 - be very careful not to do that uh so
07:08 - there are special tools and also special
07:11 - programming techniques to try to help
07:14 - deal with these situations but for the
07:16 - moment you just need to make sure that
07:18 - wherever you call new you must call
07:21 - delete um so uh one one last thing I
07:24 - want to mention in this tutorial is just
07:26 - that uh I mentioned in a previous
07:28 - tutorial that if you subtract two
07:31 - pointers one from the other you should
07:33 - store the result in a long and that's
07:36 - because um on this platform at least and
07:39 - on most platforms the size of a
07:43 - pointer is actually the same as a long
07:47 - it's going to be 8 bytes in this case
07:50 - that's not necessarily going to be the
07:52 - same on all platforms but in this case a
07:55 - pointer has the same size as a long it's
07:59 - worth check cheing out on your platform
08:00 - just to see what if you do get
08:02 - eight so if you subtract one from the
08:04 - other you need to store it in a a long
08:07 - variable but anyway I'm going to I'm
08:09 - going to leave it there for this
08:11 - tutorial and we've got quite a lot more
08:13 - to look at with this but I've decided to
08:16 - split it up into several tutorials so um
08:19 - for this um tutorial just to practice
08:21 - this I'd recommend create a class that
08:24 - has a Constructor and a Destructor that
08:26 - outputs some text and just practice
08:29 - using using new and delete to create
08:31 - objects instead of using the syntax that
08:34 - we've seen before just practice using
08:36 - new and delete and this Arrow syntax to
08:39 - refer to the methods so that's it for
08:41 - this tutorial and until next time happy
08:44 - coding

hello this is John from Cave of programming. comom in this tutorial we're going to start looking at the new operator in C++ and I'm going to split this into several tutorials CU there going to be
