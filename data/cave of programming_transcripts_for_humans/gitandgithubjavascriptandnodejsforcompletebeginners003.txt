00:00 - hello this is John from cave of
00:02 - programming calm this is another video
00:05 - in my course on programming in
00:07 - JavaScript and note nodejs
00:10 - in this video we're going to do
00:12 - something that's completely optional you
00:14 - don't need it to follow the course but
00:16 - it's a really good thing if you do do it
00:18 - and that is we're going to set up a git
00:20 - repository on github and that's going to
00:23 - be where we're going to store our code
00:24 - so if you go to github calm so github is
00:35 - it's when you go to it you're gonna see
00:38 - something different to this I've already
00:39 - created an accounts on there but let's
00:42 - maybe see things and log out so I can
00:46 - see something more like what you'll see
00:47 - when you go to it so you'll see this
00:49 - create a free account on there now what
00:52 - is this well we're gonna use version
00:55 - control software called git you don't
00:57 - have to to follow this course but I am
01:00 - going to and get stores your code
01:04 - somewhere it's going to store it in what
01:07 - we call a remote repository and
01:09 - github.com allows you to create remote
01:13 - repositories for free so you can store
01:15 - your code and you can either make it
01:17 - public or keep it private completely for
01:19 - free at least at the time I'm making
01:21 - this tutorial so create a free account
01:24 - on there and sign into it and then you
01:29 - kind of want to create a new repository
01:31 - so your screen might look different to
01:34 - mine when you sign into geeks I've been
01:36 - using this for quite a while as you can
01:39 - see but somewhere you'll find a button
01:41 - to create a new repository and you need
01:43 - to click that ok you need to give it a
01:45 - name so I'm gonna call this node J s I
01:51 - think that will probably do the trick
01:52 - why not yeah and you can type a
01:56 - description of it if you want source
02:00 - code for JavaScript and node J s for
02:08 - beginners
02:11 - up to you what you put you can choose to
02:14 - make it public or private if you're
02:16 - embarrassed about people seeing your
02:17 - code you might want to make it private
02:21 - I'm gonna make mine public so that you
02:23 - can look at my source code examples here
02:26 - you can add a readme file if you want
02:29 - that's always a good thing to do I'm
02:31 - gonna tick to say yes I want a readme
02:33 - file in there you can always add it
02:35 - later and then this is get ignore file
02:37 - and what this is it's a file that
02:39 - contains lists of files that are going
02:42 - to be present in the directory that
02:44 - you're working in but you don't want to
02:46 - store them in your source code
02:47 - repository and there are various
02:49 - standard getting more files that we can
02:53 - use here I don't know if there is one
02:54 - for JavaScript now I don't know I
02:59 - thought it was actually yeah this one
03:01 - for node look so if you search for node
03:04 - and select that that's a good one
03:06 - license you can change that as well I'll
03:09 - use the MIT license which as far as I
03:12 - understand means anyone can use my
03:14 - source code for anything I'm not sure if
03:16 - they even have to attribute attribute me
03:17 - but I don't care here you can use my
03:20 - source code for this course as you see
03:22 - fit and then when you've done all that
03:24 - and decided on all that just click
03:26 - create repository and this doesn't
03:29 - usually take long here we go so this is
03:32 - a source code repository which we're
03:36 - going to check code into as we go along
03:38 - now I'm going to click this clone or
03:40 - download button I mean those copy this
03:46 - this URL here and I'm going to go to my
03:50 - terminal now we can actually do this I
03:53 - believe from within visual studio code I
03:57 - haven't looked up how to do that but to
03:59 - do what I'm about to do you don't have
04:01 - to use the command line you can use a
04:02 - variety of tools that you know gets user
04:06 - interfaces but I'm just going to do it
04:07 - on the command line here I'm using a
04:09 - bash terminal so if you're using a
04:11 - Windows console instead you want to
04:14 - probably spend a little bit just a
04:16 - little bit of time just checking how to
04:18 - use that sort of basic usage of it
04:20 - windows the windows console by default
04:23 - will tell you
04:24 - where you where you are it says like C
04:26 - colon slash whatever it tells you where
04:28 - you are in the directory structure and
04:30 - you're gonna need to just understand the
04:32 - directory structure thing to follow this
04:34 - course you know velocities basic sort of
04:36 - computing if you played with a computer
04:39 - for a while you'll know what a directory
04:40 - is and so on okay so in bash though it
04:44 - may or may not show you where you are by
04:46 - default you can find out by doing PWD so
04:50 - if you are using bash you can type PWD
04:52 - and it'll tell you where you're located
04:54 - in a directory structure to change
04:56 - directories in bash I think it's the
04:59 - same in Windows you just do CD space and
05:01 - the directory that you want to change
05:04 - into
05:04 - you always need that space in bash
05:06 - though I think windows lets you do CD
05:09 - dot to go to the directory above but
05:12 - that doesn't work in bash you need CD
05:15 - space dot pretty similar really that's
05:18 - changed directory so if you play with
05:20 - that for a bit you'll get used to it so
05:22 - I can go to the directory above in
05:24 - Windows I do dare if I remember rightly
05:27 - to see what's in here in a bash terminal
05:30 - I can do whether it's on Windows or not
05:32 - and do LS shows me where I am and I'm
05:34 - just gonna change into this directory
05:38 - here on bash usually you can use tab as
05:40 - well to autocomplete directory or file
05:44 - names alright so anyway I'm in I'm in a
05:48 - directory where I am I want to put my
05:51 - work and I've got get working in here so
05:54 - I can use git if I type git it actually
05:57 - does something and I want to do git
05:59 - clone clone and then paste in that URL
06:03 - hit return and this is going to take my
06:07 - remote repository and basically create a
06:11 - local version of it so if I do LS now or
06:14 - dare I suppose dir suppose it will be in
06:17 - Windows console now I can see that it's
06:20 - created this nodejs directory
06:22 - it's called node.js because that's what
06:25 - I just called it on github comm when I
06:27 - created that repository I can CD into
06:30 - this change directory and do an S order
06:34 - or whatever
06:35 - and you can see what files are in it at
06:38 - the moment this is where I'm going to be
06:39 - creating my source code so we'll create
06:43 - source code in the next video I thing
06:45 - and we'll also look at how to check it
06:47 - into get okay so until next time happy
06:51 - coding
