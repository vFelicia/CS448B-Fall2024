00:17 - hello this is John from Cave of
00:20 - programming. comom in this tutorial
00:22 - we're going to look at returning objects
00:24 - from methods in C++ and we're going to
00:27 - get a bit more sort of practice with the
00:29 - new
00:31 - operator so in a previous tutorial I
00:33 - showed you this class animal which very
00:35 - simply has uh Constructor copy
00:38 - Constructor Destructor set name method
00:41 - has a name instance variable and a speak
00:43 - method that outputs name and the
00:46 - constructors and destructors all output
00:48 - some text so we can see what's going on
00:50 - there and uh we've seen this little
00:53 - program before let's get rid of this
00:56 - which just uses the new operator to
00:58 - allocate memory for an animal object and
01:01 - it calls set name speak and then it
01:05 - deletes the um we call delete on the
01:08 - pointer to deallocate the memory
01:10 - associated with this object which means
01:12 - the destructor is
01:15 - called so
01:17 - um supposing you want to return an
01:19 - object from a method and this is a
01:22 - common thing to do in in
01:25 - C++ or let's say from a function um of
01:29 - course a method is just a function it's
01:31 - part of a class but let's create a
01:32 - freestanding function here I'm going to
01:34 - say animal let's call it create
01:40 - animal and um put the kellly brackets in
01:44 - there if I can remember where they are
01:46 - on this keyboard and in there we could
01:48 - we could instantiate a animal object
01:51 - like this let's call it
01:53 - a and a do set name
01:58 - berti and and return
02:01 - a now in our main program here let's say
02:06 - animal um frog equals create
02:13 - animal and of course we can call Frog
02:17 - dope now this this does work so if I run
02:21 - this it says animal created when we do
02:24 - that it says my name is Bertie when we
02:28 - do this and then destruct called when
02:30 - this variable goes out of
02:33 - scope now the funny thing is if if you
02:36 - understand a bit about how this works um
02:39 - we would expect this to be quite
02:41 - inefficient although it seems that on
02:43 - this system with this compiler it it
02:46 - actually
02:47 - isn't so what we'd expect to happen is
02:50 - here we're creating an animal it's a
02:51 - local variable calling set name when we
02:55 - when we return uh an object from a
02:59 - function
03:00 - we actually have to normally create uh
03:03 - normally C++ will create a temporary
03:05 - object just to return that um this
03:09 - object so it would actually copy this
03:11 - you'd expect to a temporary object just
03:14 - to have the return value in
03:17 - there and then when we do this when we
03:20 - assign this new object here to our
03:24 - temporary return value object here we'd
03:28 - expect that another copy would occur
03:30 - so what we would expect would be the
03:32 - Constructor would be called when we do
03:35 - return we create a temporary return
03:37 - object to return into this variable here
03:40 - in effect uh so we'd expect the copy
03:43 - Constructor to be called there and we'
03:45 - expect the copy Constructor to be called
03:47 - here when we do this as
03:50 - well in fact we're not seeing the copy
03:52 - Constructors here and that's because
03:54 - this particular compiler is optimizing
03:57 - out the two copies there so it realizes
04:01 - that we we don't want them we just
04:02 - basically want to have one animal here
04:05 - and it's it's optimizing away the extra
04:07 - copies nevertheless in theory this could
04:10 - be potentially inefficient if that
04:13 - optimization with some compiler or other
04:16 - didn't actually
04:19 - happen now uh we could think about how
04:21 - to make this more efficient and uh one
04:25 - kind of naive way of doing that would be
04:27 - to return a reference so we could change
04:30 - that to a reference and um and then we
04:33 - could think okay when we return it what
04:37 - what will happen is that we'll just
04:38 - return a reference to this animal in
04:40 - other words just an an alias to this
04:43 - variable and then we could maybe we can
04:46 - make this a reference as well like that
04:49 - then we can say okay this is just going
04:50 - to be an alias to
04:53 - this now this works as you'd expect with
04:56 - regard to references but the problem is
04:59 - that well let's just build it we get a
05:01 - load of warnings so I don't think we've
05:03 - got any errors in here it has actually
05:05 - built a program but the program is
05:08 - probably going to crash I'm not going to
05:09 - try running it but it's not a good
05:11 - program the reason for that is this
05:14 - variable here is scoped to these curly
05:16 - brackets when we hit this curly bracket
05:19 - the destructor is going to be called on
05:21 - this we
05:23 - expect and therefore we end up with a
05:25 - reference to an object that no longer
05:27 - exists so that um
05:30 - the if the kind of um sort
05:35 - of instance variables of that object is
05:37 - still present in memory it's purely by
05:39 - chance I imagine they won't be I'm I'm
05:42 - really not sure what would happen if we
05:43 - run this well ah let's just try it what
05:45 - the
05:47 - hell so um it seems to have worked it
05:51 - just say berti but that's really work by
05:55 - chance more than anything else just
05:57 - because I suppose um
06:00 - although this ends up referring to
06:02 - invalid memory that memory just happens
06:04 - to have the right stuff hanging around
06:06 - with it but anyway regardless of what
06:09 - whether this works or not this is a very
06:11 - very bad thing to do returning a
06:13 - reference to a local variable which will
06:15 - go out of scope is not a good idea your
06:18 - program will randomly
06:20 - crash so a common way to get around that
06:23 - is to use a pointer we could say here
06:26 - animal um let's say p animal equals new
06:33 - animal like that we need to put the star
06:37 - in there as well and then we can return
06:40 - a pointer here to that to this animal uh
06:44 - we can do a can do p animal arrow set
06:48 - name using the arrow syntax now cuz it's
06:51 - a pointer and then we can return P
06:55 - animal here in our main program we can
06:58 - say let's say
07:00 - P pointer P frog equal frog equals the
07:04 - return value of create animal and then
07:07 - we can say p
07:08 - frog
07:11 - Arrow Arrow speak like that but the
07:15 - thing that we mustn't forget to do is
07:17 - because this function did a new here we
07:20 - we must do a delete to deallocate the
07:22 - memory associated with this frog so we
07:24 - need to say delete P frog like that so
07:28 - even though new happened in a in a whole
07:31 - other method to this one sorry a whole
07:33 - other function I should say we still
07:36 - need to do the delete because we do have
07:38 - a new and we've got to deallocate in a
07:40 - memory that we allocated with new
07:41 - otherwise we'll have a memory leak let's
07:43 - save that and run it check that it works
07:46 - so now we've got my name is berti
07:49 - Destructor called we've got a
07:51 - Constructor being called and a
07:52 - Destructor and there are no copy
07:54 - Constructors cuz there's no copy um
07:57 - happening of the animal even without
07:59 - without compiler optimization there
08:01 - wouldn't be a copy here we're creating
08:03 - when we when we return the pointer we're
08:05 - creating a copy of the pointer but
08:07 - that's just copying like an 8 by memory
08:10 - address and similarly here when we get
08:13 - that temporary return value into P frog
08:16 - at least this is my understanding of how
08:17 - it works uh we're just copying eight
08:20 - eight bytes did I say bits we're copying
08:23 - eight bytes into um into this pointer
08:26 - variable here so even if even if this
08:29 - some one is huge and occupies you know
08:31 - like I don't know megabytes then we're
08:34 - not copying we're not creating copies of
08:37 - those megabytes even if the compiler
08:40 - doesn't optimize to get rid of the
08:41 - copies we're still not doing it CU all
08:43 - we're doing is passing around a pointer
08:45 - this is a much more efficient way of
08:47 - doing this uh we're returning an object
08:50 - from a function than if we try to do it
08:54 - without pointers and it also avoids the
08:57 - problem that we saw with references
09:00 - because um with if if we didn't have a
09:03 - new here then we'd end up with that
09:05 - animal being um destroyed at this point
09:08 - and we could end up returning a
09:10 - reference to a an animal that doesn't
09:12 - exist anymore or may not
09:15 - exist uh but with a pointer um that
09:18 - memory will not be deallocated until we
09:20 - do delete on it so this with new um you
09:24 - have to do delete to explicitly
09:26 - deallocate that memory and the memory
09:27 - will hang around so associated with this
09:30 - um the object that this pointer points
09:32 - to until we call delete so that's why
09:36 - this is safe to do it's just has the
09:39 - downside that you you don't see a new
09:42 - here in this function but there is a new
09:45 - there and you must do delete so this is
09:47 - not um the nicest thing to do but you
09:50 - see this a lot in actual production C+
09:53 - Plus Code because sometimes you just
09:56 - need to do this sort of
09:58 - thing so to practice this um just create
10:01 - your own function that uh that returns a
10:06 - pointer to an object and then use the
10:08 - object somehow and delete the memory
10:12 - associated with it and once you've done
10:14 - that that will help to make it stick in
10:17 - your memory uh there's there's one
10:19 - little thing that I should mention here
10:21 - which uh maybe we'll go over in a later
10:23 - tutorial CU it is important but uh there
10:26 - are two basic areas of memory in a C++
10:29 - program or at least um classically this
10:33 - is how we think of it and as far as I
10:35 - know it's uh it's it's basically true
10:39 - and that is this we have the stack and
10:41 - the Heap and the stack is an area of
10:44 - memory you can think of it like a stack
10:46 - of plates where you can put plates on
10:48 - the top and then take plates off the top
10:50 - except that what we're putting on the
10:52 - stack is memory associated with local
10:55 - variables like the pointer itself is a
10:57 - local variable uh in this case and also
11:01 - we put um the addresses of functions to
11:04 - be called onto the stack so that we know
11:07 - um uh how to call those functions in
11:10 - what order so um local variables and um
11:15 - function calls end up adding memory to
11:18 - the stack and the stack is a small area
11:21 - of memory if you um if you called a if
11:25 - you called a function from within itself
11:27 - over and over again so it ended up
11:29 - calling itself you know millions of
11:31 - times you can end up with a stack
11:33 - Overflow by exceeding the amount of
11:35 - memory that you've got on the stack but
11:38 - there's also an area of memory called
11:39 - the Heap and this is basically all the
11:41 - memory available to your computer and
11:44 - when you do new you're actually
11:46 - allocating memory on the Heap so um
11:49 - let's say you had an array with millions
11:52 - of entries in it you don't want to
11:54 - declare that as a local variable cuz it
11:55 - could overflow the stack you would want
11:57 - to use new to to allocate memory on on
12:00 - the Heap which is much bigger uh for
12:03 - that array and we're going to be looking
12:04 - at that in a future tutorial so I'll
12:07 - leave it there for now just try creating
12:09 - your own uh function if you like that
12:11 - returns a pointer to an object it
12:14 - creates with new and don't forget to
12:16 - delete it's very very important it's
12:18 - worth putting in your Constructors and
12:20 - destructors and put some text in them so
12:22 - you can verify that they are actually
12:24 - called so until next time happy coding

Cleaned transcript:

hello this is John from Cave of programming. comom in this tutorial we're going to look at returning objects from methods in C++ and we're going to get a bit more sort of practice with the new
