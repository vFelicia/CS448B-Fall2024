00:00 - hello in this video we're going to talk
00:02 - a little bit about the main method and
00:04 - we're going to add some more statements
00:07 - to our main method so far we've got this
00:11 - program here all it does is when you run
00:14 - it and output some text hello world in
00:17 - this case let's recreate that program
00:20 - and it's it's a really good idea to try
00:23 - yourself creating basic Java HelloWorld
00:26 - programs from scratch because you want
00:29 - to sort of drill that into your mind and
00:31 - memorize it so we go to file new Java
00:35 - project and give it a name let's call
00:38 - this main method so I'm going to check
00:45 - that I'm using Java 11 in this case
00:48 - click Next I don't need a module salt on
00:53 - tick this and we'll click finish then
00:58 - without even expanding that the project
01:03 - I can just right-click it and go to new
01:05 - class let's call the class app we can
01:10 - call it more or less anything as long as
01:12 - it's got a first case an upper case
01:14 - first letter and no spaces or
01:18 - punctuation or anything like that the
01:20 - package I'm going to call it application
01:22 - this has to have a lower case first
01:26 - letter and I'm going to tick to say that
01:29 - I want a public static void main and I'm
01:32 - going to click finish then finally I can
01:35 - add some code to my main method so
01:39 - between these two inner brackets here
01:41 - I'm going to delete the comment I'm
01:43 - going to type this out and I'm going to
01:47 - type well
01:50 - hello world again let's say so notice
01:56 - I'm indenting and the code within
01:59 - brackets so this code is indented within
02:03 - these brackets using a tab in this case
02:05 - and this this code here is indented
02:08 - within these brackets we're going to
02:10 - talk more about that in the next video
02:13 - let's just run it and check it works
02:14 - it's a good idea always to try running
02:17 - your java projects early on to make sure
02:20 - there's not some miss configuration or
02:22 - anything and there we go it says hello
02:24 - world just like the other program so
02:28 - let's have a look at this so I want to
02:31 - focus in this video on this the main
02:34 - method so a method in well in what we're
02:40 - doing here is object-oriented
02:42 - programming so Java is an
02:43 - object-oriented language and it's hard
02:46 - to understand what that is until you
02:48 - know what an object is so we'll leave
02:50 - that for a moment and tackle it later
02:52 - but in object-oriented programming
02:54 - languages subroutines are known as
02:57 - methods this is an example of a method
03:00 - it's a method called main and what a
03:05 - method is it's it's a block of code so
03:09 - it's a collection of statements like
03:10 - this one this is a statement in ends in
03:13 - a semicolon and in this case the main
03:16 - method is very special because it's
03:19 - where our Java program starts executing
03:22 - starts running in other words so when
03:25 - you run a Java program what gets run is
03:28 - the content of the main method now we
03:34 - can put more statements in here have a
03:37 - go this yourself
03:38 - maybe there pause the video or after the
03:41 - video let's add a new line and Eclipse
03:45 - helpfully puts the cursor in an
03:47 - appropriate place usually we want to
03:51 - make sure that the statements that we
03:53 - write here are lined up with this system
03:55 - dot out dot print line statement let's
03:57 - add another one so sysout controlspace
04:02 - this is another line of text don't
04:08 - forget those speech marks there so if
04:10 - you type one Eclipse puts in the other
04:12 - automatically usually and don't forget a
04:16 - semicolon either because it won't work
04:18 - without this semicolon at the end let's
04:21 - run that and we should get two lines of
04:24 - text
04:25 - like this here we are we can put more in
04:29 - let's put one more in that's right sisal
04:34 - and final line of text you can type what
04:41 - you want within reason really and we'll
04:44 - run that again
04:46 - so let's run it there we go and it looks
04:50 - like this try that out it might not seem
04:53 - like much but we're building up
04:56 - gradually and it's gonna get hard enough
04:58 - later on so you want to really get these
05:01 - basics down notice I've left a blank
05:05 - line there I don't have to we'll talk
05:08 - about that more in the next video but
05:10 - space within a Java program is not
05:12 - important we could also write it like
05:14 - this and that would that would work just
05:16 - as well let's run this
05:19 - so the important sort of takeaway
05:22 - message for this video is when your Java
05:26 - program runs and the the Java runtime
05:31 - environment will search for a main
05:33 - method a method called main and that's
05:35 - what this is in other words a subroutine
05:38 - which has the sort of correct syntax and
05:41 - is called main and then it's gonna run
05:45 - the statements within main and it's
05:47 - going to run them in the order that you
05:49 - see them and this this can get a lot
05:52 - more complicated as we'll see later on
05:53 - but for a simple program like this we're
05:57 - just going to step down the statements
05:59 - here they're going to get run one after
06:01 - the other so first that then that and so
06:04 - on in the sort of initial part of this
06:07 - course we'll stick with just writing
06:10 - code here and later on we'll see what
06:12 - else you can do with methods and classes
06:14 - and objects and all that sort of thing
06:16 - so try that for yourself
06:20 - try putting space in or no space have a
06:24 - go at it put some more lines in your
06:26 - main method and run it okay so that's it
06:30 - for this video in and until next time
06:32 - happy coding

Cleaned transcript:

hello in this video we're going to talk a little bit about the main method and we're going to add some more statements to our main method so far we've got this program here all it does is when you run it and output some text hello world in this case let's recreate that program and it's it's a really good idea to try yourself creating basic Java HelloWorld programs from scratch because you want to sort of drill that into your mind and memorize it so we go to file new Java project and give it a name let's call this main method so I'm going to check that I'm using Java 11 in this case click Next I don't need a module salt on tick this and we'll click finish then without even expanding that the project I can just rightclick it and go to new class let's call the class app we can call it more or less anything as long as it's got a first case an upper case first letter and no spaces or punctuation or anything like that the package I'm going to call it application this has to have a lower case first letter and I'm going to tick to say that I want a public static void main and I'm going to click finish then finally I can add some code to my main method so between these two inner brackets here I'm going to delete the comment I'm going to type this out and I'm going to type well hello world again let's say so notice I'm indenting and the code within brackets so this code is indented within these brackets using a tab in this case and this this code here is indented within these brackets we're going to talk more about that in the next video let's just run it and check it works it's a good idea always to try running your java projects early on to make sure there's not some miss configuration or anything and there we go it says hello world just like the other program so let's have a look at this so I want to focus in this video on this the main method so a method in well in what we're doing here is objectoriented programming so Java is an objectoriented language and it's hard to understand what that is until you know what an object is so we'll leave that for a moment and tackle it later but in objectoriented programming languages subroutines are known as methods this is an example of a method it's a method called main and what a method is it's it's a block of code so it's a collection of statements like this one this is a statement in ends in a semicolon and in this case the main method is very special because it's where our Java program starts executing starts running in other words so when you run a Java program what gets run is the content of the main method now we can put more statements in here have a go this yourself maybe there pause the video or after the video let's add a new line and Eclipse helpfully puts the cursor in an appropriate place usually we want to make sure that the statements that we write here are lined up with this system dot out dot print line statement let's add another one so sysout controlspace this is another line of text don't forget those speech marks there so if you type one Eclipse puts in the other automatically usually and don't forget a semicolon either because it won't work without this semicolon at the end let's run that and we should get two lines of text like this here we are we can put more in let's put one more in that's right sisal and final line of text you can type what you want within reason really and we'll run that again so let's run it there we go and it looks like this try that out it might not seem like much but we're building up gradually and it's gonna get hard enough later on so you want to really get these basics down notice I've left a blank line there I don't have to we'll talk about that more in the next video but space within a Java program is not important we could also write it like this and that would that would work just as well let's run this so the important sort of takeaway message for this video is when your Java program runs and the the Java runtime environment will search for a main method a method called main and that's what this is in other words a subroutine which has the sort of correct syntax and is called main and then it's gonna run the statements within main and it's going to run them in the order that you see them and this this can get a lot more complicated as we'll see later on but for a simple program like this we're just going to step down the statements here they're going to get run one after the other so first that then that and so on in the sort of initial part of this course we'll stick with just writing code here and later on we'll see what else you can do with methods and classes and objects and all that sort of thing so try that for yourself try putting space in or no space have a go at it put some more lines in your main method and run it okay so that's it for this video in and until next time happy coding
