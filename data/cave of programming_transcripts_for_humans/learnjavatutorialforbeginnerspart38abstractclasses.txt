00:01 - hello this is John from Cave of
00:03 - programming. comom and in this tutorial
00:06 - we're going to look at abstract classes
00:09 - in
00:10 - Java and Abstract classes are something
00:14 - that you can use when you want to start
00:17 - creating a class hierarchy but the base
00:21 - class is not is is not going to be able
00:25 - to do anything in itself it's only going
00:27 - to act as a base for other classes
00:30 - and let's let's take an example of this
00:33 - I I might decide that I want to have a
00:37 - base class called machine for my class
00:41 - hierarchy let's say so I'll create a
00:43 - machine
00:45 - class and I might have a bunch of
00:47 - different subclasses like for example a
00:51 - camera is a machine so I might say
00:54 - public class camera extends machine
01:00 - and a car is a a kind of machine so I
01:03 - could say new class
01:06 - car and I could also say that car
01:10 - extends
01:14 - machine now it may be that in whatever
01:19 - program it is that I'm creating both
01:22 - cameras and cars have some
01:25 - functionality in common let's say for
01:29 - example
01:30 - [Music]
01:31 - um it may be that both the cameras and
01:33 - the cars in my program have
01:38 - IDs so if if they have something in
01:41 - common that's common to all of the
01:44 - machines in my program then I could add
01:47 - that common functionality to the parent
01:50 - class which makes complete sense so I
01:53 - could say
01:54 - private let's say int
01:58 - ID and and I could rightclick and go to
02:02 - source and generate Getters and Setters
02:04 - and I could generate a getter and Setter
02:06 - for ID and then every machine that
02:10 - extends this class has an
02:12 - ID now so far this is a completely
02:15 - conventional class hierarchy and now I
02:19 - can do stuff like
02:20 - camera cam1 equals new
02:24 - camera and cam1 do set id5
02:30 - and the same for car like car car1
02:33 - equals new car and car 1. set
02:38 - ID for or whatever you get the
02:41 - idea but I might say well what what
02:46 - exactly would machine you know why why
02:48 - would I want to create a machine object
02:51 - like I might say machine machine one
02:53 - equals new machine but what the hell is
02:55 - this you know what would I use it for
02:58 - and I might decide that while there's a
03:01 - purpose in having a camera and a purpose
03:03 - in having a car there's there's never
03:06 - going to be any value in having a
03:07 - machine because all machine is is it's a
03:11 - base class that implements some common
03:14 - functionality that any machine has but
03:16 - there's no such thing in itself as an
03:19 - abstract machine I could decide that you
03:21 - know and in indeed in the real world we
03:24 - have cameras and we have cars but unless
03:27 - you go to like a modern art installation
03:29 - or something something you don't have a
03:33 - completely abstract machine you you only
03:36 - have specific
03:38 - machines so I could prevent the user of
03:41 - this class hierarchy from instantiating
03:44 - the machine parent class and to do that
03:46 - I just make it abstract so I say public
03:49 - abstract class
03:52 - machine and what that does is it means
03:56 - that now if I try to type
04:00 - machine machine one equals new
04:05 - machine I can't do it
04:08 - because machine is abstract and as it
04:11 - says I cannot now instantiate the type
04:14 - machine which is which is what I
04:18 - wanted now this this is an abstract
04:20 - class
04:22 - and Abstract classes can have abstract
04:27 - methods because let's say I now want to
04:30 - force all machines to have a method
04:33 - called start because I might think well
04:36 - every machine that I'm going to have in
04:37 - my program has got to have a start
04:40 - method to start it up somehow whether
04:42 - it's a car or camera or whatever it is
04:44 - and you know cameras these days are
04:46 - usually digital and you have to start
04:48 - them
04:49 - up so to do that I could have an
04:51 - abstract method and this this will be
04:53 - appropriate if I want to force all my
04:56 - child classes to have this method to
04:59 - implement it but I I don't want machine
05:04 - itself to implement it because the
05:06 - implementation is going to be completely
05:08 - different for every particular kind of
05:10 - machine then I can say public
05:15 - abstract and let's say that this is
05:17 - going to not have a it's not going to
05:19 - return anything and it's just going to
05:21 - be called start and then instead of
05:24 - having brackets here I just put a
05:25 - semicolon so it's exactly like the
05:27 - Declaration of a method in an
05:30 - interace and now I get an error here
05:33 - because I've got to implement start now
05:35 - in camera so if I click the error I can
05:37 - go to add unimplemented
05:39 - methods and the same for car here and
05:43 - they can have whatever
05:46 - implementation would make sense for this
05:49 - particular
05:51 - class and this is this is of course very
05:54 - much like using an interface and we're
05:58 - going to talk about that in just a
05:59 - second but first let's put in an
06:01 - implementation here for for car as well
06:05 - starting
06:07 - [Music]
06:09 - car and you you can even do stuff like
06:13 - um let's
06:14 - say let's say you've got a run method
06:17 - let's say that every machine has a run
06:19 - method public void
06:22 - run and I could I could even like call
06:27 - an abstract method here so I could say
06:29 - star in run like that if I wanted to
06:34 - and I could have more abstract methods
06:37 - here like public
06:41 - abstract do stuff public abstract void
06:44 - do stuff this is like a kind of
06:46 - ridiculous name but just to illustrate
06:49 - the principle and
06:50 - public
06:52 - abstract void
06:57 - shutdown and I could call all of these
07:00 - methods in run even though they're
07:03 - abstract here in machine so I could say
07:05 - stop do stuff and shut
07:09 - down which can be can be quite handy so
07:12 - I'm supplying quite a lot of the
07:15 - implementation in machine but it's just
07:17 - that the bits of implementation that I
07:20 - want to force the the child classes to
07:23 - handle I I just don't declare here I
07:25 - just I just make that um those methods
07:28 - abstract and Force the child classes to
07:30 - implement them so now we've got to
07:33 - implement some more methods in
07:38 - here and now of course I can call stuff
07:42 - I can do stuff like calling car1 do
07:46 - run and this is just going to say
07:49 - starting car because I didn't Supply
07:52 - actual any implementation for do stuff
07:54 - but I could do
07:56 - that and that's uh
08:01 - pretty much all there is to abstract
08:05 - classes but one one thing that I want to
08:08 - just talk about a little bit now let's
08:10 - say just yeah shut down car but you get
08:12 - the
08:12 - [Music]
08:14 - idea one thing that um often confuses
08:17 - people is because this abstract method
08:21 - is this is forcing the child classes to
08:23 - handle that and that's very similar to
08:25 - an interface when you implement an
08:27 - interface you force
08:30 - the user of that
08:32 - interface you force the the class that
08:34 - implements that interface to implement
08:37 - certain methods and for that reason
08:39 - people often get confused about when to
08:41 - use an abstract class and when to use an
08:46 - interface and uh there are several
08:49 - things to bear in mind and the the most
08:52 - key thing is that when you make a class
08:58 - the child of an abstract ract
09:00 - class by having the abstract parent
09:02 - class there you're really making a very
09:04 - strong statement about what the child
09:06 - fundamentally is so with an interface we
09:11 - could have like um I could have an
09:14 - interface called uh info for example
09:17 - with a method called show info and a
09:20 - machine could implement this show in
09:22 - info interface and so could a person or
09:26 - so could a building class any anything
09:29 - can Implement show info and we will be
09:32 - we would simply be saying that uh a
09:35 - class implements it has this
09:37 - functionality of being able to display
09:40 - information about itself let's say but
09:42 - when you say that a a child class
09:46 - fundamentally
09:48 - extends a parent class like this extends
09:50 - machine I'm really making a very strong
09:53 - statement and I'm saying that camera is
09:56 - a machine and I'm saying that car is a
09:58 - machine
10:00 - so the parent class determines it its
10:02 - fundamental identity and when you have a
10:07 - abstract class as the parent um class in
10:11 - hierarchy you you really have to make
10:13 - sure that the child classes they are
10:15 - going to be whatever that parent class
10:18 - is a car is a machine so an abstract
10:22 - class implementing extending an abstract
10:24 - class is a much stronger statement than
10:29 - simply implementing an interface and
10:32 - another thing to bear in mind is that
10:35 - a a class can Implement many interfaces
10:39 - but it can only have one parent class so
10:43 - it can only have one abstract class in
10:48 - hierarchy so you're you're only going to
10:51 - be able to extend one abstract class but
10:53 - you can Implement as many interfaces as
10:55 - you like which again kind of reflects
10:57 - the fact that extending abstract class
11:00 - is just a really a more fundamental
11:03 - statement about identity than simply
11:06 - implementing an interface it's as if the
11:09 - parent class determines what your child
11:11 - class is but implementing an interface
11:15 - just determines one thing that it does
11:17 - and it can Implement many interfaces
11:20 - meaning it can do many different
11:23 - things and another consideration is that
11:27 - you cannot have code in an interface
11:29 - but in an abstract class you can provide
11:32 - default functionality we can actually
11:34 - have real functionality in um in an
11:38 - abstract class like machine here but in
11:40 - an interface you're leaving the
11:42 - implementation completely up to the
11:44 - child
11:46 - class so you can't you can't put code in
11:49 - an interface and once again that that
11:51 - really has to do with the fact that if
11:53 - you extend a parent class you're really
11:57 - your child class had has the fundamental
12:00 - identity of the parent class and can
12:04 - even take functionality from it whereas
12:06 - in an interface it's completely up to
12:09 - the implementing class what
12:11 - implementation is in there it's um the
12:14 - interface purely only defines the form
12:18 - of um the methods that your class has
12:20 - and it doesn't provide
12:23 - implementation so that's it for this
12:24 - tutorial and uh abstract classes are a
12:27 - great tool to use when whenever you're
12:29 - starting a class hierarchy and it just
12:31 - makes no sense to have a actually
12:35 - implemented object of the root in that
12:38 - hierarchy so there're a thing that
12:40 - you'll use occasionally but uh probably
12:43 - not nearly as often as you will use
12:48 - interfaces you can find this code on
12:50 - Cave of programming. comom and until
12:55 - next time happy coding

hello this is John from Cave of programming. comom and in this tutorial we're going to look at abstract classes in Java and Abstract classes are something that you can use when you want to start

whatever program it is that I'm creating both cameras and cars have some functionality in common let's say for example um it may be that both the cameras and the cars in my program have IDs so if if they have something in common that's common to all of the machines in my program then I could add that common functionality to the parent class which makes complete sense so I could say private let's say int ID and and I could rightclick and go to source and generate Getters and Setters and I could generate a getter and Setter for ID and then every machine that extends this class has an ID now so far this is a completely conventional class hierarchy and now I can do stuff like camera cam1 equals new camera and cam1 do set id5 and the same for car like car car1 equals new car and car 1. set ID for or whatever you get the idea but I might say well what what exactly would machine you know why why would I want to create a machine object like I might say machine machine one equals new machine but what the hell is this you know what would I use it for and I might decide that while there's a purpose in having a camera and a purpose in having a car there's there's never going to be any value
