00:00 - so here's something we have never tried
00:01 - before motion capture a couple of months
00:04 - ago XM's reached out to us and asked if
00:07 - we wanted to try out their motion
00:08 - capture suit and I first thought was
00:10 - we're going to need a bigger studio
00:12 - however at a second glance we realized
00:14 - that the suit just uses on body motion
00:17 - sensors this is really high in hardware
00:20 - and so you can imagine we were pretty
00:21 - excited when we received this very team
00:23 - spawned looking suitcase in the mail
00:26 - [Music]
00:36 - but before we look at what's inside this
00:39 - shady box this video is sponsored by a
00:41 - Skillshare Skillshare is an online

00:49 - this really cool class on how to use pro
00:51 - builder in unity it will take you all
00:53 - the way from installing pro product to

01:17 - will receive their first 2 months for
01:19 - free so the first thing to do was of
01:21 - course open the box and figure out the
01:24 - ups and downs of all the included
01:25 - sensors wires battery packs and so on we
01:29 - were pretty overwhelmed with the amount
01:30 - of hardware packed together here the
01:33 - suit even came with a router for
01:34 - wirelessly connecting it to a computer
01:36 - and an action figure
01:38 - yes as for setup it wasn't without its
01:41 - difficulties accents had offered to set
01:44 - up a Skype call with us to help us get
01:46 - started
01:46 - and even with their help it took us
01:48 - quite a few hours to get everything
01:49 - working of course this process can be
01:51 - much faster if you know what you're
01:53 - doing the suit was fairly easy to put on
01:55 - we just had to place and link together
01:57 - all the sensors throw on a battery pack
02:00 - and the on suit computer and we were set
02:02 - since we have no prior experience with
02:04 - equipment like this we had some trouble
02:06 - getting the suit to connect to the
02:08 - computer in fact we ended up hardwiring
02:10 - this suit to a laptop in order to get it
02:12 - to recognize after that though
02:14 - everything worked flawlessly we
02:16 - calibrated the suit by getting Andreas
02:18 - to give us his best catwalk and voila
02:21 - the suit was tracking his motion in real
02:23 - time to a shocking degree of precision
02:25 - and pretty much without any input lag at
02:28 - this point we were pretty excited and
02:30 - dress broke out into a quick dance and
02:32 - oh oh we just recorded some quick
02:34 - movements to test out and with that it
02:37 - was time to import the movement into
02:39 - unity first the software did a
02:40 - processing pass by analyzing the
02:42 - movement and getting rid of
02:43 - imperfections as lat getting the
02:46 - animations into unity was as easy as
02:48 - exporting to an FBX
02:50 - in fact it was so easy that we didn't
02:52 - even try out the live link feature that
02:54 - allows you to see movements in unity in
02:56 - real-time so after setting up the write
02:58 - import settings in unity and downloading
03:00 - the Exxon's asset store package we
03:02 - managed to get the test character moving
03:04 - around the scene so we set up a quick
03:06 - example level and boom we had a dancing
03:09 - robot now we had the idea to search the
03:18 - asset store for free characters that we
03:19 - could try and apply this animation to in
03:22 - theory it should work as long as the
03:24 - character uses a humanoid rig and indeed
03:27 - it did in fact we had a crazy amount of
03:29 - fun quickly swapping out characters and
03:31 - I think it really shows the
03:33 - opportunities with using motion capture
03:34 - with an environment like unity it gives
03:37 - you endless amounts of opportunity to
03:39 - reuse animations across a wide range of
03:42 - characters so at this point we concluded
03:44 - that this suit works extremely well when
03:47 - it works and it's actually reliable when
03:49 - you start to learn the different tricks
03:51 - to making this software do what you want
03:52 - it to next up we wanted to try out on
03:55 - body recording so we enabled it through
03:57 - the software and when outside it was
04:00 - hilarious to watch andreas casually
04:01 - stroll down the street wearing well that
04:04 - we decided he looked like a mash-up
04:06 - between an eighties Joker and a
04:08 - superhero recording outside was really
04:11 - easy press a button to calibrate and
04:13 - then press the same button to record
04:15 - first we went to the bench where we had
04:17 - shot the intro for this video we wanted
04:19 - to see if the tracking could be precise
04:21 - enough to allow him to sit on a bench in
04:24 - virtual space without sliding around as
04:26 - you can see from the recording it wasn't
04:28 - perfect the suit tracking works
04:30 - extremely well with horizontal movement
04:32 - but moving the core of your body on the
04:34 - y-axis seemed to cost the suit to
04:36 - realign a bit however we later found out
04:38 - that this was due to our lack of
04:39 - knowledge of this software as you'll see
04:41 - later I think we managed to work around
04:43 - it by blending together the good parts
04:45 - of the animation to clean it up a bit
04:47 - now remember this is just using raw
04:49 - animations with fast processing if you
04:52 - want you can always open up the
04:53 - animation in a standalone software to do
04:55 - Corrections however for this test we
04:57 - couldn't be bothered and in general we
04:59 - recorded under nutso ideal conditions we
05:02 - didn't record on Flag
05:03 - around in fact most of the places we
05:05 - recorded were on a slope and we also
05:07 - tried jumping on and from things which
05:09 - didn't turn out so well we decided to
05:12 - stay clear of height differences going
05:13 - forward but apparently there are
05:15 - features in the software that allows for
05:16 - better height tracking we just didn't
05:18 - know at the time however one thing that
05:20 - the suit did really well right out the
05:22 - box was jumping we managed to track
05:25 - andreas doing a backflip which I think
05:27 - looked really really cool especially on
05:30 - a big sci-fi robot and we also had him
05:32 - jump over an obstacle in this case me we
05:35 - asked him what we should replace me with
05:37 - in the unity scene and he requested a
05:39 - goat so we went goat shopping on the
05:43 - asset store of course unfortunately
05:44 - there weren't any free coats available
05:46 - so instead we decided on a symbol barrel
05:49 - from the western props pack I think it
05:51 - ended up looking really cold and it's so
05:53 - fun to be able to spectate the movement
05:55 - from different angles we also wanted to
05:57 - try having two characters interact with
05:59 - each other this was of course a
06:00 - challenge since we had to use the same
06:02 - suit for both characters we quickly put
06:05 - together a fighting sequence and had
06:07 - Andreas reenact both sides of the fight
06:09 - with me as a sparring partner
06:10 - considering that we recorded everything
06:12 - in less than 10 minutes the result was
06:14 - pretty great however I think this would
06:16 - have been the perfect place to use live
06:18 - link to preview what the animations look
06:20 - like with a sword and a shield in hand
06:22 - finally we of course had to put together
06:24 - a tiny game and I don't think there's
06:26 - any game more animation dependent than a
06:28 - fighting game so we had a dress go
06:31 - through various fighting movements and
06:33 - loaded them all into unity and then
06:35 - programmed a symbol controller to make
06:37 - the character change animation based on
06:39 - player input and that's pretty much it
06:41 - of course adding colliders hit detection
06:43 - reactions and all the gameplay systems
06:46 - is for another day and that's pretty
06:48 - much all we had time to do in this video
06:50 - of course a big thanks to accents for
06:52 - reaching out and letting us borrow this
06:54 - really cool suit also don't forget to
