00:00 - version control is useful for so many
00:01 - reasons I use it mostly for singing
00:03 - projects between computers for
00:05 - collaborating on projects and for
00:06 - keeping backups I can easily revert back
00:08 - to in this video we'll have a look at
00:10 - how we can set up github and use it with
00:11 - unity I'm going to come to version
00:12 - control there's a lot of terminology
00:13 - being thrown around but here's the basic
00:16 - breakdown kit it's an open-source
00:17 - version control system github it's a
00:20 - website that makes it easy to host and
00:21 - control projects using git when you sign
00:24 - up on github you can create a repository
00:25 - a repository is a place where you can
00:27 - store your project after creating a
00:29 - repository or repo people can clone it
00:31 - to their computers that means creating a
00:33 - local version of the project that's
00:35 - sitting on your computer you can then
00:36 - make changes to the project and commit
00:38 - these changes to the repository on
00:40 - github and everyone will get notified
00:42 - about the change in order to easily
00:43 - commit changes and pull other people's
00:45 - changes people either use a command-line
00:48 - interface or a desktop client this is a
00:50 - touchy subject for many but for the sake
00:52 - of simplicity we'll be using github own
00:54 - client github desktop finally there are
00:56 - few things to think about when using get
00:58 - hub with unity specifically we'll get
00:59 - into those later alright enough with
01:01 - that let's get started so first we want
01:03 - to go to github calm here we're going to
01:05 - create an account already have one so
01:07 - I'm just going to log in we then want to
01:09 - hit start a project and here we can
01:11 - create our repository first we'll need a
01:13 - name I'm just going to call this example
01:14 - - game getup doesn't allow spaces in the
01:18 - repository name then we can input a
01:19 - small description
01:20 - [Music]
01:22 - and then you can choose whether or not
01:24 - you want the repository to be visible to
01:26 - the public now a free github account
01:28 - doesn't allow you to select private here
01:30 - currently you can upgrade for seven
01:31 - dollars a month but personally I haven't
01:33 - found a reason to do this yet I like the
01:35 - idea of the software I'm working on to
01:36 - be public we can then choose to
01:38 - initialize this repository with a readme
01:40 - we'll go ahead and check that and we'll
01:42 - see what this means in a second we can
01:44 - also choose to add a git ignore file a
01:46 - git ignore is basically just a text file
01:48 - that allows you to specify some files
01:50 - and folders that you don't want to
01:52 - include in your version control here's
01:54 - an example of a git ignore in here we
01:56 - ignore all files ending in calm dark
01:59 - class the DLL and so on I always
02:02 - recommend including a git ignore and
02:03 - that's actually a default one setup for
02:05 - unity this will make sure to ignore all
02:07 - the temporary files that unity creates
02:09 - finally you can choose to add a license
02:11 - but we'll just leave that blank we can
02:13 - then hit create repository and here's
02:15 - the repository for our example game you
02:17 - can see we currently only have two files
02:19 - we have the gate ignore file and we have
02:21 - the readme the readme is a markdown file
02:23 - which allows us to easily add text to it
02:25 - and by default it's displayed on your
02:27 - opening page here we can actually click
02:29 - on the readme and edit it inside of the
02:31 - browser so I'll just go ahead and add
02:32 - another line here if we then scroll to
02:36 - the bottom you can see that we can now
02:38 - commit this change by default it's just
02:40 - going to say update readme which is fine
02:42 - for me and we don't need much
02:43 - description on this one let's just hit
02:44 - commit Changes and now if you go back to
02:46 - our root folder we can see it's changed
02:48 - we also see that it's now updated here
02:50 - and says two commits if we click on this
02:52 - we can see the history of the project
02:54 - currently there is only two versions the
02:56 - initial one with the default readme and
02:58 - the one we just made with the updated
03:00 - one you can always click on a commit in
03:02 - order to see what's changed so now we're
03:04 - ready to clone our project but to do
03:05 - that we'll need to install a git client
03:07 - if you go to desktop github comm github
03:10 - has their own client to use and this
03:12 - client recently got remade and so the
03:15 - new version is in beta however it seems
03:17 - a lot better than the old one and I
03:18 - haven't had a single issue yet but in
03:20 - case something doesn't work for you you
03:22 - can always scroll to the bottom here to
03:23 - download the old version we'll just hit
03:25 - download for Windows and yes there is a
03:27 - Mac version as well well then click on
03:29 - the Installer hit run and you should now
03:31 - see a github icon on your desktop let's
03:33 - double click on it and the first time
03:34 - you open it
03:35 - it will ask you to sign in as well as
03:37 - put in the name and an email that you
03:38 - want to be associated with your commits
03:40 - I recommend using the same email add to
03:42 - your github account you can always edit
03:44 - this by going to file options here you
03:47 - can sign in to a github account I'm
03:49 - going to sign in here now you can also
03:51 - go and do get to fill out your name and
03:53 - mail let's say that and now we have
03:55 - three options we can create a new
03:56 - repository locally we can clone an
03:58 - existing one from github or you can add
04:00 - a local repository that you might have
04:02 - lying around
04:03 - we'll hit clone repository and here we
04:05 - need a URL to get that we'll simply go
04:07 - into our repository a clone or download
04:09 - and copy this URL I'm just going to hit
04:11 - copy to clipboard and paste it in we can
04:14 - then choose a path for our project I'm
04:16 - going to put mine inside of my projects
04:17 - folder let's then hit clone and you
04:20 - should now see that if you open up your
04:21 - folder your repository will be there and
04:23 - inside it is our kid ignore and I read
04:26 - me now we can go ahead and add and edit
04:27 - all files we want inside of this folder
04:29 - let's try putting a unity project in
04:32 - there so open up unity that's it new I'm
04:34 - going to call it example game project at
04:37 - the location I'll choose our repository
04:39 - that's called example game that's a
04:42 - create project so it's an empty scene
04:44 - let's just save that as main and if we
04:46 - now go to our github client we see all
04:48 - the different files that were added to
04:50 - our repo but before we commit these we
04:52 - want to set up a few things in unity we
04:54 - want to go edit project settings editor
04:56 - and here we want to make sure that under
04:58 - version control we've selected visible
05:00 - meta files for each asset inside of your
05:03 - project panel unity will create a meta
05:05 - file associated with that object the
05:07 - meta file stores information such as
05:08 - what settings we have on that object and
05:10 - wedge used in our project we want to
05:12 - make sure that these are visible so they
05:14 - will get picked up by our version
05:16 - control will also go into asset
05:17 - serialization and set that to force text
05:21 - that will make a lot of the files
05:22 - created by unity a lot more readable we
05:24 - now go to our client and before we
05:26 - couldn't preview this file but now we
05:28 - can see all of the different values that
05:30 - make it up that's because if the force
05:32 - text attribute we now want to commit
05:33 - this project let's make sure that all of
05:35 - the files are selected and in the
05:37 - summary we'll just right add empty
05:39 - project and before we commit to master
05:42 - that's one more thing we want to fix you
05:44 - can see how it says 164 change files
05:47 - here a lot of
05:48 - files are actually meta files and you
05:50 - might think what why didn't I get
05:51 - ignored get rid of these well if you ask
05:53 - me that's according to a mistake in the
05:55 - kid ignore file that github sets up for
05:56 - unity the reason why is if we go into
05:59 - our project and open up our gate ignore
06:01 - we can see all the files that it tells
06:02 - us to exclude however it does this based
06:05 - on the impression that the root of our
06:07 - project will also be the root of the
06:08 - repository and we put our project in a
06:11 - subfolder which i think is just better
06:13 - practice anyways so to fix that we can
06:15 - go in and delete all the slashes in the
06:17 - beginning of the folders here and if we
06:19 - save that and go into our client we can
06:21 - see the number of files now have changed
06:22 - to 19 and you can also see the changes
06:25 - we just made to our gate ignore I'll
06:26 - make sure to link you to a better get
06:27 - ignore for unity in the description
06:29 - let's then hit commit to master and
06:31 - wallah we can now go into the history
06:32 - tab to see a new commit but this commit
06:35 - it's only sitting on our computer let's
06:36 - make sure to push it to the server
06:38 - let's click the push origin button and
06:41 - there we go if we now visit a repository
06:43 - in the browser we can see our project
06:45 - has been added and now we can go on
06:46 - creating our game and when you've made
06:48 - some changes simply go back into the
06:49 - client and add a new commit and of
06:51 - course make sure to push it if you make
06:53 - changes to a project on another computer
06:55 - it will prompt you to pull those guess
06:57 - what you do that using the same button
06:58 - here let's pretty much it for this video
