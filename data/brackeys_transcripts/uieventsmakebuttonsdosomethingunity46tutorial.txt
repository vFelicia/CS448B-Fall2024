00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello
00:04 - everyone and welcome to the second
00:06 - tutorial covering the all new unity GUI
00:08 - system introduced with unity 4.6 again
00:12 - this is in a public beta so in order to
00:15 - download this please head over to the
00:18 - unity website and you can download the
00:20 - free beta there awesome so before we get
00:23 - started today with creating some buttons
00:27 - that will actually do something whenever
00:29 - you press them I just want to quickly
00:31 - mention that you can of course head over
00:33 - to forum break is calm if you have any
00:37 - questions or if you make something cool
00:39 - please post about it there there are
00:42 - many people here to help and chat with
00:44 - you so cool let's dig right into today's
00:47 - subject so as always I've opened up
00:50 - unity and you can see that I again have
00:52 - a basic scene here are not much to it
00:55 - it's just if we take a look at it here
00:57 - in 3d space it's just this Sun that I've
01:01 - made using a sphere and some particle
01:04 - systems and then I have set up this
01:06 - purple background here then I've created
01:09 - a very basic UI which I showed you how
01:13 - to make in the last video which is of
01:16 - course available at the YouTube channel
01:18 - and if we dig under the canvas here you
01:21 - can see that we have one change scene
01:23 - button so let me just focus on that and
01:25 - that's it right here I've done nothing
01:28 - other than changing the color a bit and
01:30 - changing the text down here and that's
01:34 - basically it so we are ready to go ahead
01:36 - and make this button do something
01:38 - because right now when we hit play and
01:40 - hover over this and click nothing
01:43 - happens so I thought what we could do is
01:46 - is make something really simple which is
01:48 - just changing the scene whenever we
01:51 - press the button so in order to do this
01:54 - we are going to go ahead and create a
01:56 - script that has a function where we will
01:59 - change our scene so we could put this on
02:03 - the button itself or we could put it on
02:05 - the camera or any other object for that
02:08 - matter I'm just going to go ahead and
02:10 - create an empty game object by pressing
02:12 - ctrl shift and
02:13 - Oh going up here in the menu and I'm
02:16 - going to rename this to let's say
02:18 - underscore manager just because in most
02:21 - most of my games I like to have a game
02:24 - object dedicated to doing stuff like
02:26 - changing scenes adjusting settings and
02:31 - spot instantiating things and all that I
02:34 - like to have this manager object that
02:36 - takes care of kind of managing the play
02:39 - session so I'm just going to zero out
02:42 - the position just for good practice
02:44 - let's hit add component new script and
02:47 - let's make this of type C sharp though
02:50 - this will of course also work with
02:52 - JavaScript not much conversion needed
02:54 - here and let's go ahead and call this
02:57 - our change scene now let's that look
03:02 - like this to open it up in monodevelop
03:03 - and it's just going to open up here oops
03:07 - mine is actually opening in Visual
03:10 - Studio now well that's just fine you can
03:13 - of course use monodevelop also by the
03:16 - way the new the new integration with
03:19 - unity and Visual Studio is really
03:22 - awesome it's something that you should
03:23 - check out I know of unity posted a lot
03:25 - about it on that blog just search for
03:28 - unity vs and you should totally check it
03:31 - out it's it's really cool so not much
03:34 - needed here we actually can just delete
03:36 - the start function and then instead of
03:39 - the update here we are going to rename
03:42 - this to let's say change the change to
03:50 - scene and let's give this a parameter so
03:57 - let's give it a string value no actually
04:01 - let's give it an integer so let's do
04:03 - integer and let's call this scene to
04:08 - change to and then in here we're simply
04:12 - going to do application dot load level
04:16 - and inside of this we are going to give
04:20 - it this scene - change - and when we
04:25 - just write it like
04:26 - this unit is expecting an integer value
04:29 - meaning just a number which is the index
04:33 - of the scene we could also do a string
04:36 - like this and then maybe do scene 1 but
04:40 - when we set it up like this we can call
04:43 - this function and then we can just give
04:45 - it an integer and then we can put it in
04:48 - here so that means that if we have
04:51 - multiple buttons maybe changing two
04:53 - different scenes we simply we can simply
04:56 - call the same function and then it will
04:59 - vary the scene that it changes to you
05:01 - based on the argument that we give it
05:04 - one thing that we will have to do in
05:06 - order to call this from our button is
05:08 - make this a public void like that and
05:13 - that is very necessary or we're not
05:15 - going to be able to do this now let's
05:18 - save this let's hit back into unity see
05:21 - if we have any errors looks like it's
05:24 - fine now we can go ahead and find our
05:28 - button let's just check on the manager
05:30 - yeah it's there now we can go ahead and
05:32 - find our button under the canvas then we
05:35 - can go down here and under the on click
05:38 - we can hit the plus sign to make
05:41 - something happen whenever we click it
05:43 - now we're going to reference our manager
05:45 - object so simply drag it in there and
05:47 - then we have a list of all of the
05:49 - different functions that sits on that
05:52 - object and by default we have some stuff
05:55 - under the game object we have some stuff
05:57 - under the transform and then we've
05:59 - created a script called change scene and
06:02 - now we have all of the different stuff
06:04 - inside of the change scene and we of
06:07 - course just want to select the change to
06:10 - scene and you can see that it takes an
06:12 - integer so we simply click that and now
06:15 - we have the ability to just select the
06:18 - integer value here so right at the scene
06:21 - that we are right now is going to be
06:23 - called scene 1 and that's just going to
06:26 - have an index of 0 what we want to
06:29 - change to you is scene 2 and we're going
06:31 - to give that an index of 1 so we're
06:33 - going to set this to 1 now this should
06:37 - theoretically work but
06:39 - say we want to set this up with a string
06:42 - value instead well then we simply head
06:44 - into our script instead of an int we
06:47 - type in string here and then we simply
06:51 - put this interchange to you again now we
06:54 - save and we're going to wait for unity
06:57 - to update then we are going to go under
06:59 - here you're going to select change scene
07:02 - change the scene and then we can give it
07:04 - a string instead and we're simply going
07:06 - to call this scene to you so now it
07:08 - doesn't matter what index it actually
07:10 - has now remember whenever we want to
07:14 - change between scenes we need to add
07:17 - them to our our build so let's go in the
07:20 - build settings or press control shift B
07:23 - let's hit add current to add scene one
07:26 - and let's also drag in scene two now you
07:30 - can also see the indexes to the right
07:32 - and you can change the index by simply
07:36 - dragging cool so now when we hit play
07:40 - and click the change scene button you
07:45 - can see that we change scene to scene
07:47 - two
07:48 - hooray we've finally made it and that's
07:51 - the basics of adding scriptable events
07:53 - or adding clickable events to buttons so
07:58 - this technique can also be applied to
08:01 - sliders so you can change values
08:04 - depending on a slider value so if that's
08:07 - something you want to see or anything
08:09 - else in general please leave it as a
08:11 - comment and I'll make sure to cover it
08:13 - also I'm very sorry that I've been away
08:16 - for so long but I've been working on
08:18 - some really cool projects that I will
08:20 - hopefully soon be able to share you so
08:22 - as always thanks for watching
08:24 - and if you have any questions about
08:26 - today's video head over to farm table
08:28 - Rockies to come and simply create a
08:31 - thread so thanks for watching and I'll
08:33 - see you in the next video
