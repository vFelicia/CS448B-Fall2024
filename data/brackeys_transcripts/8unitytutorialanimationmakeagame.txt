00:00 - thanks for tuning in at
00:03 - braies hello everyone and welcome to
00:05 - video number eight in make a game a cool
00:08 - series on making a video game in unity
00:12 - today's subject is animation so we're
00:14 - going to do everything in the animation
00:16 - window and we'll go into that in just a
00:19 - sec but before then uh what you're
00:21 - seeing is today's featured project uh
00:24 - it's called moonwalk and it's made by
00:26 - Jacob games using these tutorials uh
00:30 - very well done uh if you want to get
00:32 - featured next week uh or have a chance
00:35 - to get featured you can uh write to me
00:38 - at brey's tweet on Twitter that's also
00:40 - on the screen or if you want to know
00:42 - more about moonwalk you can click the
00:44 - link uh or The annotation on the screen
00:47 - and and see the video and download the
00:49 - game it's it's very well done
00:50 - congratulations Jacob games Okay so
00:53 - let's dig right into today's subject uh
00:57 - first off let's go ahead and just sort
01:00 - some of these uh things out I think we
01:04 - have a little too many objects here so
01:06 - in the project pane so let's right click
01:09 - hit create folder and let's make a
01:12 - material folder so we're going to call
01:14 - this
01:15 - materials try again there so and select
01:18 - all of the materials using holding down
01:21 - control I'm pretty sure it's command on
01:23 - a Mac and then drag them onto the
01:25 - materials folder just to clear up some
01:28 - space cool what we're going to be
01:30 - animating today is the coin object we
01:32 - made in the last video basically we want
01:35 - this to rotate all the time um until it
01:39 - gets picked up and then it disappears
01:41 - you can see what we laid make made last
01:44 - um basically when we roll into it it
01:46 - just disappears uh in the next video
01:50 - we're going to do some particles that
01:51 - makes it look really cool whenever we
01:54 - pick it up but before we go ahead and
01:56 - animate it let's just select the ball
01:58 - and I really want to bump up the
02:00 - rotation speed I think it's simply too
02:02 - slow so I'm going to double that up to
02:04 - 200 hit play and see if this feels right
02:07 - yeah it's much more responsive now and
02:10 - and feels uh a lot more fun to
02:14 - control great well basically uh there
02:17 - are multiple ways to do animation in
02:20 - unity and the three ways I can think of
02:22 - right now are uh first of which through
02:25 - scripting so basically instead of
02:28 - animating it V ually you can go in and
02:31 - make a script that says for example if
02:33 - we wanted to rotate that it should
02:35 - rotate a little bit each frame on a
02:38 - certain axis though that's too
02:41 - complicated for what we're going to do
02:42 - now it's much easier to just make an
02:44 - animation so that's what we're going to
02:46 - do but you could also make an animation
02:49 - in another program and then use unity's
02:53 - new uh animation system called mechanim
02:56 - and that's using the animator here which
02:59 - is now grade out and uh that's also a
03:02 - more complicated thing you use that if
03:04 - you want to like animate characters and
03:06 - such but that's really difficult so
03:08 - we're not going to get into that if you
03:10 - want to know more about that you can
03:11 - watch our Survival Games tutorial series
03:15 - but basically what we're going to uh do
03:17 - today is use the basic animation
03:19 - component so we can just select the coin
03:22 - go to add
03:24 - component go to miscellaneous and hit
03:28 - animation not animator but
03:32 - animation click that and now we can add
03:36 - an animation clip but in order to do
03:38 - that we'll have to first make a clip so
03:42 - let's go to
03:44 - window animation or press control
03:48 - 6 to open it up and this is how it looks
03:51 - I really like to duck the animation
03:53 - panel down here by the project and then
03:57 - just drag it up quite a bit what we we
03:59 - can do now is we can make our game view
04:02 - sit by the side of our scene view by
04:04 - simply dragging it over and dark it by
04:07 - the side here so we can see changing in
04:10 - both the game View and the scene
04:13 - view okay great uh so basically what
04:16 - we're going to be doing now is we're
04:18 - going to be changing the transform of
04:21 - the objects and there is a new animation
04:24 - system coming in 4.3 this is version 4.2
04:28 - so things might have changed just a bit
04:31 - since then but basically what we're
04:33 - going to need is the
04:35 - transform component here there's going
04:37 - to be a add um add animation thing uh
04:41 - button right here and what you need to
04:42 - add is the transform that's all we need
04:44 - to change is the
04:47 - transform great so what we're going to
04:49 - do is we're going to pre press this red
04:51 - button and that's going to allow us to
04:54 - create an animation call it whatever we
04:56 - want and we're going to call this um
04:59 - coin
05:02 - rotates like that and now you can see we
05:05 - can start changing the different
05:07 - variables here and the animation editor
05:10 - is really cool because you can change
05:13 - pretty much any
05:15 - value uh under the uh stored on the game
05:19 - object so that could be a we could
05:21 - change the trigger or we could change a
05:23 - light or we could change yeah we can
05:25 - change anything you can also go down to
05:27 - the CH uh Children of the object and and
05:31 - change some of them but again we're
05:33 - going to do the transform here and what
05:35 - we want is the rotation why and the
05:38 - reason why is because this uh Green
05:42 - Arrow here that's the Y you can also see
05:44 - it up here in the right hand of the
05:45 - scene View and uh and basically if we
05:49 - rotate around that use that as a pivot
05:52 - it will uh rotate around this way so if
05:56 - we go ahead and try to just change the Y
05:58 - over here on the right hand side in the
06:00 - inspector we can see it rotating the
06:02 - right way but uh yeah so basically this
06:06 - need to start at zero so let's make sure
06:09 - that the rotation y is at zero and then
06:12 - you can see this little thing this
06:14 - little uh key that you can press on the
06:17 - right hand side of the Y let's just
06:19 - press that and hit add
06:22 - key now that we have done this it's made
06:25 - what is called a key frame and that's
06:27 - basically saying that when we are at
06:30 - this point in time the rotation should
06:32 - be this variable and you can see now
06:35 - here that we can change a timeline here
06:38 - so we can scrub through time and you can
06:41 - see that this is 1 second I'm pretty
06:44 - sure that's 1 second we can go ahead and
06:45 - play it there um so right now we don't
06:50 - have any movement because it always
06:52 - States at zero but let's go ahead and
06:55 - just zoom out to two seconds here you
06:57 - can zoom using the alt and scroll wheel
07:00 - so zoom out to 2 seconds and let's now
07:03 - change the rotation wi to 360 so
07:08 - 360 and now we can scrub through this
07:11 - and see our coin rotating and once it
07:14 - gets to this point it will stop so
07:16 - basically we can hit play and see
07:19 - rotating and right now it's actually
07:21 - looping but let's just make sure that
07:23 - it's looping correctly by use going down
07:25 - here A W say default and selecting Loop
07:29 - so now select
07:31 - Loop and let's hit play and I think the
07:34 - rotation looked just fine um maybe we
07:37 - should just make it a little bit more
07:39 - slow so let's do something like
07:42 - 2.4 try again but this is really up to
07:45 - do I think this looks just perfect so
07:49 - let's go ahead and stop the recording
07:52 - here and now we just need to add it to
07:55 - the object so let's just drag in this
07:59 - Cor rotate wherever you saved it in the
08:01 - project and drag it onto the nonan
08:03 - animation clip here to add it and now
08:07 - when we make sure that it says play
08:10 - automatically and again that if we
08:12 - select it it says Loop not default we
08:15 - can go ahead and hit
08:16 - play Let's just bring up the game view
08:20 - here go ahead and hit play and we can
08:23 - see the coin rotating infinitely so this
08:27 - looks really awesome and that's Bas the
08:29 - that's the basics of using the animation
08:32 - window in
08:34 - unity I hope you enjoyed this video and
08:37 - I look forward to seeing what every
08:39 - project you're making thanks for
08:41 - watching and I'll see you in the next
