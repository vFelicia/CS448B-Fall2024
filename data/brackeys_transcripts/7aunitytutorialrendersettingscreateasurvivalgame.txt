00:03 - hello everyone and welcome to the
00:06 - seventh tutorial in our survival game
00:09 - series done by Black Keys I am the CEO
00:11 - of Rockies and today we are going to
00:14 - take a look at something very exciting
00:16 - we are going to take a look at something
00:18 - called particle systems and these can
00:22 - make spells and magical effects and
00:25 - explosions and fire look so damn cool
00:29 - and we also going to take a look at
00:32 - something a little more practical which
00:35 - is render settings okay so if we go
00:39 - ahead and open up a unity I've already
00:43 - done this this scene is exactly as we
00:47 - left it this time which is also why I
00:50 - want to make some quick changes so first
00:54 - of all I just want to delete all of
00:56 - these animations these animations were
00:59 - for my last my previous maze and not for
01:04 - the new mine and that I made so I'm
01:06 - going to delete these and just drag the
01:11 - new animation I made in to that folder
01:14 - at some point I will do these animations
01:17 - again okay um and I also want to make a
01:22 - new folder called GUI
01:25 - and just drag the crosshair in there and
01:29 - yes this should pretty much get us
01:32 - started
01:33 - yes also I want to drag this maze and
01:37 - this sword out into the assets so if we
01:43 - go back here we can now see that the two
01:45 - prefabs store here so I want to
01:47 - right-click and again make a new folder
01:50 - called prefabs I suggest that you do
01:54 - this - it's a good way to organize
01:56 - everything you could also make
01:58 - subfolders like weapons and stuff but I
02:00 - won't do this until it gets clouded with
02:03 - everything and also I have forgotten to
02:07 - click on the sword and then
02:09 - remove the animator component oh I can
02:12 - see that
02:13 - the maze that I have here in my prefab
02:15 - it's not actually a prefab it's just an
02:18 - import so I'll go ahead and drag this
02:21 - back into our input folder and then just
02:26 - select the maze and I'm my scene and
02:28 - then drag this down so we have that as a
02:32 - preset I'm prefab sorry okay so first of
02:38 - all let's go ahead and change the
02:40 - settings this is the boring part
02:42 - although this can change a lot so go to
02:44 - the edit button above and go down to
02:50 - render settings and in here you can do
02:53 - stuff like farc and ambient light these
02:57 - two are the most important settings
03:00 - so what farc is is basically it will
03:05 - blur out objects in the distance with a
03:09 - certain color so if i just go ahead and
03:13 - quickly make some objects and drag them
03:18 - out into the distance and put a light
03:22 - over them so that we can see what they
03:25 - actually are so you can see them there
03:28 - and I'll just maximize the game view a
03:31 - little bit so if we go ahead under the
03:35 - render settings again and then enable
03:38 - the FAC you can see that they get
03:40 - blurred with a greyish color while
03:43 - nothing happens to the foreground and so
03:46 - you can adjust this color you could make
03:48 - it red issue some orange if you are in a
03:52 - desert you could make it light bluish if
03:56 - you are close to the sky or in a snowy
04:00 - environment you could make it darker if
04:02 - you were making a horror game and so you
04:05 - can play around with this this can add a
04:07 - cool depth without putting too much
04:10 - pressure on the graphics card in
04:13 - processor so um but for now I'll just
04:16 - keep this disabled I just wanted to give
04:18 - you the do you the opportunity and once
04:22 - we start creating
04:23 - our landscape then I will re-enable this
04:27 - probably um ambient light and this is
04:30 - something that I had people ask me
04:33 - because they say oh I want to make a
04:36 - room that is completely dark except for
04:39 - the one light that I have and I can't do
04:43 - that and why is that this is because of
04:46 - the ambient light so right now you can
04:48 - see that this is just this is set to a
04:51 - greyish dark gray color and so this is
04:57 - the darkest color that can be shown in
05:00 - your scene so even if you don't have any
05:02 - lights this is set so if you want to
05:06 - make a horror game I recommend that you
05:07 - drag this all the way down now you can
05:10 - see that all the parts of my scene that
05:12 - is unlit cats
05:14 - um or flown with this color so generally
05:18 - you don't want to have things that isn't
05:21 - lit at all you want some kind of
05:24 - lighting else every single piece of
05:27 - detail that you made will just disappear
05:29 - but for something like an adventure game
05:33 - or a survival game or a RPG you
05:36 - generally want things to be pretty well
05:39 - lit so for now we'll just keep this at
05:42 - the grayish color also okay so go up to
05:46 - edit and then project settings and then
05:49 - quality and this is actually what you
05:54 - also call from the render settings so
05:58 - you can see that we have the different
06:00 - levels this is just presets of settings
06:03 - that unity has set up for us and the
06:07 - green little Mark's here means that this
06:11 - is what the different platforms so this
06:13 - could be web the PC the Mac it could be
06:16 - iPhone and all these different platforms
06:20 - will use by default so first of all
06:24 - let's go ahead and say that this will be
06:26 - fantastic for all of them by simply
06:29 - using the smaller downward pointing
06:33 - arrows here and
06:36 - let me just get closer to Mike and so
06:40 - let's go ahead and click on the
06:42 - fantastic level and then let's crank up
06:45 - some of the settings so the pixel light
06:48 - count is basically how many lights you
06:51 - can see reflecting off one surface so if
06:55 - I add if just I just set this to 1 and
07:00 - then add a whole bunch of lights I'll
07:04 - just go ahead and delete the stuff I
07:11 - made in the background here so this was
07:14 - the duplicates like that and delete the
07:17 - line okay
07:18 - so if we make a whole bunch of lights
07:21 - and put in in different places on the
07:26 - surface you can't seem to be able to see
07:30 - any difference it might get lighter but
07:34 - as soon as we crank it up so practic
07:38 - settings quality and then change this to
07:42 - maybe 5 you can start to see specularity
07:45 - and also in the game view so this is
07:49 - basically how detailed you want the
07:52 - lighting to be and I think that we want
07:56 - the lighting to be a whole lot more
07:59 - detailed than just 4 because this
08:04 - actually doesn't take off that much
08:07 - power it's not even that heavy so let's
08:10 - just set this to 100 for now this is a
08:13 - heavy number and we won't be using that
08:15 - much it's just to set say don't cut it
08:19 - down texture quality definitely want
08:22 - this to be full rest this simply may
08:24 - make the textures you can simply make
08:28 - the textures look worse and therefore it
08:30 - take less power to render and and it's
08:37 - to drop pick textures you should leave
08:40 - this set forced on this is fine I won't
08:42 - explain what it actually does
08:44 - anti-aliasing anti-aliasing is
08:50 - is simply a smoothing of the edges so if
08:53 - we go ahead and disable this and you
08:56 - take a look at some of the edges here
08:58 - you can see that they are not so smooth
09:01 - again and if I crank this up to 8 they
09:05 - all the pixel errors just get completely
09:10 - cut off so you want this as high as
09:13 - possible but this is pretty heavy so for
09:17 - now we can just leave this as 4 because
09:19 - I'm recording meanwhile but generally
09:22 - the fantastic setting in a game should
09:25 - leave this at 8 but for now let's leave
09:28 - it at 4 no no you know what
09:31 - let's leave the fantastic level at 8 and
09:33 - then just test at the beautiful level
09:35 - that will create in a second so soft
09:40 - panicles you want this and you can play
09:43 - around the shadows though this only
09:45 - matters when you have unity Pro and this
09:49 - you can just leave alone so go under the
09:52 - beautiful and now just quickly type some
09:55 - things in so this will be 75 full rest
09:58 - forced on four times and serializing
10:02 - shadows distance will be let's say 100
10:05 - and again for cascades and the good
10:12 - should be 50 and then hmm yes still full
10:17 - res per texture though anti-aliasing to
10:21 - soft particles still and the shadows
10:25 - look fine symbols should be about 25 and
10:29 - then full rest per texture disabled no
10:33 - soft particles and the shadows look fine
10:36 - fast should be a bout 10 full rest no
10:46 - and isotropic textures no enticing those
10:50 - soft particles we can still have some
10:53 - shadows maybe that's your call call and
10:56 - fast it's fast its fastest pixel I count
11:02 - five
11:03 - half rest no no now disable shadows and
11:07 - you'll be good to go alright so let's
11:10 - leave that this ad beautiful while we
11:13 - are testing so you can go ahead and save
11:15 - a ctrl s and go back to the assets
11:18 - folder and while we're all waste we have
11:22 - already spent 12 minutes so okay this is
11:26 - the ends of this part in the next part
11:29 - we'll cover the particles I'm sorry that
11:31 - I have to cut this up so thank you for
11:35 - watching
