00:00 - so while back we did a video on my top
00:02 - ten favorite unity tips well we see the
00:04 - 10 and we ratio by 90 that's right we're
00:08 - kicking off the New Year with 100 cool
00:10 - you needed tips and tricks that
00:11 - hopefully is going to make your life a
00:12 - whole lot easier about 100 bits easier
00:16 - to be exact
00:17 - also a huge thanks to all of you who've
00:19 - been checking out line of code to those
00:21 - of you who don't know we just launched a
00:23 - game dev clothing store and we're just
00:25 - really excited about it so if you
00:26 - haven't checked it out yet head on over
00:28 - to the line of code IO let's of course I
00:30 - think for that in the description all
00:32 - right 100 unity tips here we go so first
00:36 - tip you can change back to the old
00:37 - selection outline by going on the gizmos
00:39 - and turning on selection wire next you
00:41 - can use the pixel perfect camera
00:43 - component to get super crisp pixel art
00:45 - make sure to first install the package
00:46 - in the package manager
00:48 - you can sort sprites based on their
00:49 - y-value by going to the graphics menu in
00:51 - the project settings and setting the
00:53 - transparency sort mode to custom axis
00:55 - and the Y value to one if you want to
00:57 - destroy a game object but would like to
00:59 - wait a few seconds you can insert a
01:01 - delay as a second parameter if you right
01:03 - click on a shader and create a material
01:05 - it will create a material based on that
01:06 - shader and name it accordingly you can
01:08 - use runtime initialization onload method
01:11 - to execute code in your scripts without
01:13 - having to create an empty game object
01:15 - with a mono behavior copy components
01:17 - while in play mode and paste them back
01:19 - when not playing to save changes to
01:21 - randomly get a variable that is either
01:23 - true or false simply use this short
01:25 - statement consider using structs instead
01:27 - of classes when storing just a few
01:29 - variables because they can live in the
01:30 - stack which eliminates garbage
01:32 - collection right the beginning of the
01:33 - statement in your script and double
01:35 - press tab to generate the rest start a
01:37 - quarantine within another co-routine
01:39 - using this code snippet the animation
01:41 - window can be used to animate pretty
01:43 - much everything the cool thing is that
01:44 - this includes parameters in your own
01:47 - custom scripts you can use control a to
01:49 - select everything in the animation
01:50 - window and then F to frame it all you
01:53 - can use C to toggle curve view and K for
01:55 - keyframe in the animator you can reverse
01:57 - an animation by setting the speed to
01:59 - minus 1 when comparing a distance
02:01 - don't use vector three the distance
02:03 - instead subtract the two points and use
02:05 - square magnitude then square the number
02:07 - you want to compare with this saves a
02:09 - square root call which is really slow
02:11 - use text mesh instead of the fall
02:13 - text objects to get way more control and
02:16 - much crisper text at all sizes mark
02:18 - private variables with serialized field
02:20 - to make them appear in the inspector
02:21 - while still being private if you want to
02:23 - hide a public variable without making it
02:25 - private market with hiding the inspector
02:27 - use the formerly serialized as attribute
02:30 - to rename a field without losing its
02:32 - serialized value you can add folder
02:34 - shortcuts into your unity project to
02:35 - easily be able to open folders that you
02:37 - often use focus on an object by
02:40 - selecting it and pressing F first F
02:42 - twice if you want to follow the object
02:43 - around match the game camera to the
02:45 - scene view by selecting the camera in
02:47 - the hierarchy and pressing control shift
02:48 - F when comparing two tags try to avoid
02:51 - the double equals it's more performant
02:53 - to use the compared tag method you can
02:55 - use empty game object as dividers in
02:57 - your hierarchy to help organize your
02:59 - objects if you want to find all objects
03:01 - with a particular component just search
03:03 - for it in the hierarchy in project
03:05 - search
03:06 - t : scene shows only scenes T :
03:09 - textures shows only textures and so on
03:12 - pretty cool for quickly finding objects
03:13 - of a certain type use alt + arrow up and
03:17 - down to quickly move lines without
03:19 - having to copy and paste quickly
03:21 - navigate to the documentation for a
03:22 - component by hitting the book in the
03:24 - upper right corner do you need to know
03:26 - when something changed and how then go
03:28 - to the documentation versions to get
03:30 - links to termination for all previous
03:32 - unity versions hold down alt while
03:34 - expanding an object in the hierarchy to
03:36 - expand all child objects as well the
03:39 - same applies to collapsing unity is
03:41 - completely customizable you can move
03:43 - around windows until you're happy then
03:45 - save your settings as a new layout by
03:47 - going to edit preferences color you can
03:49 - adjust editor colors including the
03:51 - background color of the scene view you
03:53 - can also make the editor change color
03:54 - when playing the game by adjusting the
03:56 - play mode tint this is great so you
03:58 - don't forget that the game is running
03:59 - you can choose what effects to show in
04:01 - the scene view by going under the
04:03 - landscape drop-down at the top want to
04:05 - be able to quickly call a certain
04:06 - function simply use the menu item
04:08 - attribute to assign a function to a new
04:10 - menu item at the top of the unity editor
04:12 - and use the context menu attribute to do
04:14 - the same thing but adding the function
04:16 - to the context menu instead split up
04:19 - your object into layers to easily be
04:20 - able to toggle them on and off in the
04:22 - scene you can also lock layers to avoid
04:24 - accidentally moving objects that you
04:26 - don't want to select
04:27 - when creating layers or tax you can use
04:30 - a slash to create submenus to make it
04:32 - easier to organize your project use
04:34 - project settings player other settings
04:36 - and then scripting defined symbols to
04:38 - add global c-sharp defined to your
04:40 - project these can be used to omit or
04:42 - include code when compiling you can use
04:45 - the color picker to get colors outside
04:47 - of unity itself and copy-paste works on
04:50 - colors use Shift + space to maximize a
04:52 - window use the system that serializable
04:55 - attribute to be able to see an edit
04:56 - classes and structs in the inspector
04:58 - change which layers collide with which
05:01 - by going under physics and changing the
05:03 - collision matrix also this is how
05:05 - different colliders interact when all on
05:07 - the same layer if I had to get something
05:09 - to - down my body this might be it you
05:11 - can do math calculations inside of
05:13 - number fields in the inspector no need
05:15 - to bring out a calculator unity also
05:17 - allows you to lock the inspector this is
05:19 - especially useful if you open a second
05:21 - inspector because it allows you to copy
05:23 - values between two objects really
05:24 - quickly well set the 50 mark I think it
05:28 - was that calls for a sip of water well
05:37 - let's continue the drop down menu at the
05:39 - top of the inspector has a debug mode
05:41 - option when enabled this will display
05:43 - all variables including private ones
05:45 - when you sync debug that lock you can
05:47 - add a game object as a second attribute
05:49 - this will highlight the game object in
05:51 - the scene when clicking on the lock you
05:53 - can use simple styling in debug logs to
05:55 - spider up your console messages
05:56 - sometimes when you have a variable that
05:59 - changes over time it would be great if
06:01 - you could just see it on a graph luckily
06:03 - we can use animation curves to achieve
06:05 - this fairly easily using this code
06:06 - snippet you can quickly add a new script
06:08 - by pressing add component typing the
06:11 - name of the script and hitting Enter
06:12 - twice unity can read save files from
06:15 - programs such as Photoshop or blender
06:17 - and Maya no need to export to another
06:19 - format first to keep individual
06:21 - Photoshop layers when importing into
06:22 - unity simply save as a PSP file instead
06:26 - this does require you to install the PSD
06:28 - importer from the package manager assign
06:30 - gizmos to objects using the inspector
06:33 - choose your own custom gizmos by
06:35 - selecting other enable and disable
06:37 - gizmos categorically from the scene view
06:39 - you can do this for the game view as
06:41 - at the top the code hell plus au plus
06:44 - space plus world creates a lot of
06:46 - strings and memory garbage use string
06:48 - builder for concatenating multiple
06:50 - strings more effectively create your own
06:52 - editor objects using scriptable objects
06:54 - this is great for organizing game data
06:56 - like items or achievements in the
06:58 - Preferences window you can choose what
07:00 - happens when the script changes while
07:01 - playing pretty cool since a lot of the
07:03 - time weird stuff happens when you just
07:04 - continue playing you can easily extend
07:06 - the unity editor to add your own custom
07:08 - windows with tools and overviews we have
07:11 - a video on this I recommend you watch if
07:12 - you've never tried it out it's a lot of
07:14 - fun and if you don't want to create a
07:16 - whole new window you can simply create a
07:17 - custom inspector this way you can change
07:19 - how you display components in the editor
07:21 - to add buttons display more information
07:22 - and so on we of course have a video on
07:25 - that as well you can use the qwe rnt
07:28 - keys to click the swap between tools and
07:30 - you can actually use the rect transform
07:32 - tool to scale 3d objects it's perfect
07:34 - for scaling from bounce instead of
07:36 - around the pivot holding ctrl while
07:38 - moving an object snaps to position to
07:40 - full world units for more snapping
07:42 - options go to edit snap settings hold me
07:44 - to grab and drag objects by their
07:46 - vertices as well snap them to other
07:48 - vertices reduce C sharp compile-time by
07:51 - creating your own managed assemblies
07:52 - right-click in the project select
07:54 - assembly definition and move it to the
07:56 - folder you want now all scripts inside
07:58 - that folder will be compiled to this
07:59 - assembly yield return new waitforseconds
08:01 - one will never stop if time that time
08:04 - scale is set to zero to change this use
08:07 - wait for seconds real time instead you
08:10 - can store references to components that
08:11 - you're going to be using a lot in
08:13 - private variables to save on performance
08:15 - this is called caching never use camera
08:18 - main it literally does this behind the
08:21 - scenes oh the horror
08:22 - if you're using a lot of non-changing
08:24 - strings in your code you can use static
08:26 - read-only string to avoid allocating a
08:28 - bit of memory each time they're quite a
08:30 - few attributes that make your inspector
08:32 - life a lot easier here the ones that I
08:34 - use the most range allows you to create
08:36 - a slider that goes between the min and
08:37 - Max value space adds an empty space
08:40 - hello creates a tiny bit of text tooltip
08:42 - changes the tooltip when hovering over a
08:44 - variable now when visiting the asset
08:46 - store you can do so both using a web
08:48 - browser or from within the editor you
08:50 - can drag and drop one scene onto another
08:52 - to merge them easily duplicate
08:54 - an object by hitting ctrl D we also use
08:57 - the same command to duplicate array
08:58 - items you can use presets to save
09:00 - configurations for your components
09:02 - simply use the sliders in the corner to
09:04 - choose between presets or create a new
09:06 - one to loop over all direct children of
09:08 - an object use this code snippet use
09:11 - transform that set sibling index to
09:13 - change the order of objects in the
09:14 - hierarchy by a script save your current
09:16 - selection by going edit selection and
09:19 - choosing a number you can then load back
09:21 - the selection from the same menu or
09:23 - using the shortcut use regions to create
09:26 - collapsible sections in your code watch
09:28 - out this is a slippery slope that leads
09:30 - to very long scripts you can pause the
09:32 - editor at a specific moment during
09:33 - runtime by setting editor application
09:35 - that is passed to true the frame skip
09:38 - button next to pass can be used to
09:40 - proceed one frame at a time use the game
09:42 - stats window for a quick overview over
09:44 - your game statistics for more in-depth
09:46 - look at performance use the profiler
09:48 - window and you can use this code snippet
09:50 - to measure the execution of a function
09:52 - in the profiler get a closer look at
09:54 - what you are inspecting by
09:55 - right-clicking on the upper part of the
09:57 - preview to undock it and it will then
09:59 - act as any other window need a quick
10:01 - break from your games audio simply hit
10:03 - the mute button in the game view
10:04 - monobehaviour that invoked repeating
10:06 - does not stop repeating on the activated
10:09 - game objects go to window frame debugger
10:11 - to see a breakdown of how each frame is
10:14 - rendered you can also visualize physic
10:16 - shapes using the physics debugger it's
10:18 - great for spotting errors in colliders
10:19 - and finally for tip number 100 don't
10:23 - make an MMORPG
10:25 - seriously don't there you go that's 100
10:29 - unity tips now there are of course a lot
10:31 - more actually I don't think there is I
10:34 - think we covered all of them but I'm
10:36 - sure you guys can think of more so
10:38 - please do share them in the comments and
10:39 - of course don't forget to check out line
10:41 - of code using the link in the
10:42 - description and that thanks for watching
10:44 - and I will see you in the next video
10:46 - let's do outtakes begin
10:58 - so yeah just happen well we see the 10
11:05 - and we raised you by 9 gee thanks of the
11:22 - awesome patreon supporters who donated
11:23 - in November and special thanks to make a
