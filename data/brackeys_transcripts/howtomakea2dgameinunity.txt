00:00 - So, a question we get asked a lot is how to make a 2D game?
00:03 - Of course, this is a huge question to answer.
00:05 - But, hopefully, this video should help point you in the right direction.
00:08 - And this is actually filmed on our brand-new video camera.
00:11 - So, I hope the quality is all right.
00:12 - Apparently, this camera has a pretty narrow lens.
00:15 - So, we had to do this crazy setup to make it work.
00:19 - Luckily, making 2D games in Unity has gotten so much easier over the last couple of years
00:25 - Ever since they introduced the new 2D features in version 4.3
00:28 - We've seen a bunch of cool features and workflows for different aspects of working with 2D in Unity
00:34 - Now, 2d games, of course, come in a variety of different art styles and genres.
00:39 - And the tools that are right for you are going to completely depend on the game that you're making.
00:42 - But, in general, we can split Unity up into two primary workflows.
00:46 - Tile based.
00:47 - And sprite based.
00:48 - The tile based workflow is meant for games that are build on a grid
00:52 - As the name suggests
00:52 - You create environments by placing tiles.
00:55 - Which makes it pretty fast and easy to create and modify levels.
00:59 - The sprite based workflow, on the other hand, gives you more control
01:02 - As it simply means that you place object freely in the world
01:06 - As a result of this you can create more detailed and dynamic environments.
01:09 - But it might not be as quick.
01:11 - And, on top of that, Unity is also working on some tools for vector graphics
01:15 - In case you are really fond of illustrator.
01:17 - But, regardless of what workflow you choose
01:20 - We first have to create a project.
01:22 - So, to create a new project, we go "new"
01:24 - And your UI might look a tiny bit different here
01:26 - But that's because I'm using Unity hub
01:28 - Which is still in beta
01:29 - But the idea should be the same
01:31 - We then select a name for our project
01:33 - I'm just gonna call mine "2D Game Example".
01:36 - We then select a Unity version.
01:38 - I'm gonna be using 2018.2
01:40 - Then we chose a save location
01:41 - I'll just use my projects folder
01:43 - And, finally, as our template, we want to make sure that we select 2D.
01:47 - Let's then hit create project
01:49 - And Unity is going to open up a new empty project.
01:54 - And, now, we can see we have this empty scene
01:57 - With only a main camera in it.
01:59 - And because we made sure to select 2d as the template
02:02 - Unity has set up some different settings on our camera
02:05 - And in our editor
02:06 - To work well with 2D.
02:08 - Awesome!
02:09 - Now, when starting with an empty project
02:10 - I really recommend visiting the Unity Asset Store to find some assets to use for your game.
02:15 - Of course, if you want you can always replace them with your own custom assets later.
02:19 - Luckily, there are some really great free assets available that we can use.
02:23 - I've gone ahead and compiled a list of some of my favorites.
02:26 - If you want to check them out you can use the link in the description.
02:28 - In here we have a pack for putting together cool pixel art caves
02:31 - They say picks up platformer pack
02:34 - As well as some more toony assets
02:36 - All these are based around tiles
02:37 - And so will fit perfectly with the tile based workflow.
02:40 - If you want to use the sprite based workflow
02:42 - There's also an incredibly detailed art pack
02:45 - As well as a top-down dungeon pack that would work great for that
02:48 - Some of these also include characters
02:49 - But I've gone ahead and added a few separate ones just in case.
02:52 - Now, once you've picked something that you like
02:54 - We have to get it into Unity
02:56 - The way that we do this, it's by opening up the asset store window.
02:59 - So, we'll go window
03:00 - We'll go under "General" and select the "Asset Store".
03:03 - You can also press "Control 9".
03:05 - We'll then navigate to the package that we want to download.
03:08 - I'm just gonna get the free platform game assets.
03:11 - It's right here.
03:12 - So we'll click on that.
03:13 - And once you find the asset, you can simply click this red button to first download
03:17 - And then import it.
03:18 - We'll then get this window
03:19 - Where we can see all of the different assets that are included in the pack
03:23 - And if there's something in particular that you don't want
03:26 - Let's say, you already have a character
03:28 - And don't need this one
03:29 - We can simply uncheck it,
03:31 - But I'd like to import everything. So I'm just gonna a select everything and hit import.
03:34 - This one is called BayatGames
03:36 - And under here we have the free platform game assets
03:39 - And you can see a bunch of different subfolders with the different aspects of our pack
03:43 - And most packs will also come with some kind of a demo scene.
03:46 - In this case, there's a demo folder right here.
03:49 - If we open that up and double click on the scene to open it.
03:52 - We then go into the scene view
03:53 - And we can see this nice example of how you can combine the different elements to create a level.
03:58 - You can, of course, select the 2D Rect Tool at the top here.
04:01 - The shortcut for this is the T key
04:03 - And if you also make sure that you're in 2D mode at the top of our scene view.
04:07 - We can then go in and simply click and change different elements around.
04:11 - We can, of course, move them.
04:13 - Rotate them.
04:14 - And scale them, as well.
04:15 - And so you can quickly start modifying these levels to make them your own.
04:19 - But, of course, we want to create our own custom level.
04:21 - So we'll go back to the default sample scene
04:24 - And we can now start dragging in assets to use them.
04:27 - And how you go about this is going to depend on the pack that you're using.
04:30 - This pack here splits up all the sprites into individual images.
04:34 - So, if we're going to say "Tiles" and then "PNG"
04:37 - We have some different sizes available here.
04:38 - I'm gonna go under 256.
04:40 - I'm gonna select the "grass platform" and drag it in.
04:43 - And that works right away.
04:45 - We have all of our different assets and each one of them is a separate image.
04:49 - So, we can simply drag in some different images to sketch out a level.
04:53 - But what most 2D packs do is that they used a tile set
04:57 - And a tile set is basically just a very large image
05:00 - With a bunch of sprites laid side by side
05:03 - For example, if we go to the asset store and download the sunny land
05:08 - And open up the folder here
05:09 - We can see that on the artwork
05:12 - And then environment
05:13 - In here, we can see that there is indeed a file called tile set
05:17 - And if we have a look at this
05:18 - We can see that it's basically just a bunch of smaller sprites in one larger image.
05:23 - Now, if you want to learn how to create your own tile sets
05:25 - And set them up in Unity.
05:26 - We have a tutorial that I suggest you check out
05:29 - But, luckily, this package has done all that for us.
05:32 - If we just select the tile set sliced here
05:34 - We can see that they've actually gone in and marked all the different tiles that make up this tile set
05:40 - And if we expand this arrow here
05:42 - We can actually see each individual tile in our tile set.
05:46 - Pretty cool!
05:46 - And just like any other image we can take any one of these.
05:49 - And simply drag them in to the editor.
05:52 - Now, this one is a lot smaller, but you can see it works just fine.
05:55 - So, now that we know how to work with sprites.
05:58 - Let's try and build out a quick level here.
06:00 - So, we already have this grass platform here.
06:02 - That's great. I'm just gonna place it here.
06:04 - Let's also add a background.
06:05 - So, I'm gonna go under new background.
06:08 - Under PNG.
06:09 - I'm just gonna select the lowest version here
06:11 - Under background
06:12 - And here we have another file.
06:14 - Let's simply drag that in, as well.
06:16 - And we can see this looks nice in our camera.
06:18 - But we can also see that it's overlaid on top of a grass.
06:22 - And, of course, we want our background to be behind it.
06:26 - For this we use something called sorting layers
06:28 - So, to the right in our inspector here
06:30 - Under the Sprite Renderer
06:31 - We can see the setting called the sorting layer
06:33 - If we click this, we can add a new sorting layer.
06:36 - This takes us to another menu
06:38 - Where we can hit the plus sign to create a new layer
06:40 - Let's call this one "background"
06:42 - And if we want this to be behind the default layer
06:45 - We actually need to put it on top
06:47 - That's because this actually represents the drawing order
06:51 - In other ways, we first draw our background
06:53 - And then we draw the default layer on top
06:56 - Let's just go in and add another one here called the "foreground"
06:59 - In case you want to have some foreground  elements as well.
07:02 - So, now we can go into a new background
07:04 - And we can change the sorting layer here to background.
07:07 - And "voilà"!
07:08 - A grass platform appears.
07:10 - We can also maybe add a coin to our game
07:13 - To do that we'll go under the coin animation.
07:15 - Let's go into PNG again
07:16 - And let's just select the small version here
07:18 - And as you can see this has a bunch of different images
07:21 - And if we go through these quickly
07:23 - We can see that they make up an animation.
07:26 - So, to add these as a single animated object.
07:29 - We simply select the first one
07:30 - Hold down shift
07:31 - And select the last one
07:33 - And we then drag all of them in
07:35 - Unity is going to notice that we are dragging in a bunch of images
07:38 - And so it's gonna ask us to create a new animation with these images.
07:42 - I'm gonna make a new folder for this
07:44 - I'm gonna store all of our animation in here.
07:47 - Let's open it up.
07:48 - And let's call this the "coin animation".
07:51 - Let's hit save
07:52 - And inside of our animation folder
07:54 - Unity is now going to create both a animation file
07:57 - As well as an animator controller
07:59 - And this is currently named after one of our images.
08:02 - I'm just gonna rename this to "coin animator".
08:05 - And now if we select our coin
08:07 - We can see that it has an animator component as well
08:10 - If we go to the animation window
08:12 - Which you can always find on the window
08:14 - Animation
08:15 - We can actually go through each individual image in this animation
08:19 - If we hit play
08:20 - We can play through it
08:22 - Or if we simply hit this button to play the game
08:24 - We can see that the animation plays and repeats by default.
08:28 - So, now we have an animated coin in our game
08:32 - We can, of course, move this around
08:34 - Put it anywhere that we would like
08:36 - And just like when creating any game in unity
08:37 - We can then add components to our different game objects in order to make them do different things
08:43 - Say, for example, that we wanted this coin to have physics applied
08:46 - Well, then we could go ahead and add a new component.
08:49 - We can go under physics 2D
08:51 - And here, we have a bunch of different components for adjusting 2D physics on our game object.
08:56 - I'm just gonna select the Box Collider 2D
08:59 - If we then go into the Scene view and select our coin and hit F to focus on it
09:04 - We should be able to seeing that there's actually a green line surrounding our coin.
09:08 - It might not be too visible from the screen recording, but it is there.
09:12 - I'm just gonna give it a size of 1 on the X
09:15 - This way we can kind of see it more clearly
09:17 - And the Y is just fine as it is.
09:20 - But adding a Collider is not enough.
09:22 - If we want this to fall onto our platform
09:24 - We also have to apply physics to it
09:27 - To do this, we'll go add component
09:28 - And we'll search for rigidbody 2D
09:31 - This will apply it physics to our coin
09:33 - And if we now hit play
09:35 - We should see that immediately our coin falls.
09:38 - However, because we don't have a collider on our grass,
09:42 - It's just gonna fall right through on platform
09:44 - So, that's here go and add a box Collider 2D.
09:48 - And we can go in and edit the collider here
09:51 - And I'm just gonna drag the top a bit down
09:54 - So, that it looks like our coin is landing at the center of our platform
09:58 - I'm also going to take the platform and drag it down a bit
10:01 - And if we now hit play once more
10:03 - We can see that the coin falls and lands on a platform
10:06 - We also see that we have this weird issue
10:08 - Where sometimes our coin is behind a platform
10:11 - And sometimes it's in front
10:13 - And that's because they're currently on the same sorting layer
10:16 - And not only that they have the same order within that layer
10:19 - To change that we can go to our coin here
10:21 - And we can increase the order in layer
10:24 - So, if we set this to any value greater than 1
10:26 - It will be drawn on top of our platform
10:28 - I'm just gonna set it to something like 10
10:30 - And now when we hit play
10:32 - Our coin always appears on top of our platform.
10:35 - So, that is kind of the very basics of working with 2D objects in Unity,
10:39 - And currently we're just using the default sprite workflow
10:42 - We can take any of these objects and drag it around freely.
10:45 - In other words, we aren't restricted to a grid.
10:48 - However, because this platform actually has a bunch of different tasks in it.
10:52 - It would work great with the tile based workflow.
10:55 - So, let me just give you a quick preview of how that would work.
10:58 - If you want to learn more about using Tile Maps in Unity,
11:00 - We have a tutorial dedicated to that. So definitely check that out.
11:03 - So, for now I'm just gonna take these two objects and remove them
11:06 - And instead I'm gonna right-click in our scene and I'm gonna go to the object
11:10 - And create a new tile map
11:12 - This creates an object in our scene called grid
11:14 - And as you can see this does overlay a grid on top of our scene.
11:18 - I'm gonna set the cell size of this grid to 2 by 2
11:21 - This way it's a bit larger
11:23 - And under this grid, we have the tile map.
11:26 - We can also go and open up the tile set window
11:29 - So we'll go window
11:30 - 2D
11:31 - And select the Tile Palette
11:33 - Let's dock this to the side of our Scene view
11:36 - And the tile palette is basically just the window where we add all of our tiles
11:40 - And then we can select between them in order to paint them into our scene.
11:44 - So, I'm gonna create a new palette here
11:46 - Let's just name it something like "Grass Platform palette".
11:51 - I'm gonna hit create
11:52 - And I'm just gonna store it in the base folder here
11:54 - So, it's select folder
11:55 - And now we can simply drag sprites in here in order to add them to our palette
11:59 - Of course, we have a bunch of tiles right here
12:01 - So, I'm just gonna select all of them and drag them right in.
12:05 - And it's going to ask us where we want to generate all the tile assets
12:08 - I'm gonna right click and create a new folder for this.
12:10 - Let's call it tiles
12:12 - And it's it that folder
12:14 - It's then gonna generate all of our tiles
12:16 - And voilà!
12:16 - We can now see all of our tiles inside of this window
12:19 - And we can select any one of them by simply clicking on it
12:22 - And by selecting the brush tool at the top here
12:25 - We can then start painting them into a scene.
12:27 - We can also see that they don't quite line up with our grid
12:31 - To change that, we need to select all of our sprites.
12:33 - And to the right here, we'll change the pixels per unit
12:36 - And each of these sprites is 256 by 256
12:40 - And we want each one of them to be two units wide
12:43 - Because we set our grid to 2 by 2
12:46 - And so we simply need to take this value and half it
12:49 - And that makes 128.
12:51 - So, we'll set the pixels per unit to 128.
12:54 - And if we then apply that
12:55 - We can see that they snap right into place
12:57 - So I'm just going to use the paint brush and erase the two two a quick level here
13:04 - Awesome!
13:05 - Again, I really suggest you check out our tutorial on tile maps
13:07 - If this is the workflow that you want to use.
13:10 - So, hopefully, that should give you an idea of what tools you have at your disposal
13:14 - When starting to make 2D games in Unity.
13:16 - Of course, this is only the beginning
13:18 - And we'll be releasing new videos on the different aspects of making 2D games going forward
13:22 - Starting with player movement
13:24 - If there are any particular subjects that you would like to see
13:26 - Like enemies, one-way platforms or shooting
13:30 - Definitely let us know in the comments
13:32 - Until then I recommend just playing around with Unity
13:34 - And having some fun sketching out your own levels
