00:00 - making an RPG in unity might seem like a
00:02 - pretty big challenge I produce often
00:04 - both system and content heavy however in
00:06 - this series we will try to boil it down
00:08 - to a few key subjects that are central
00:10 - for almost any RPG and to keep things
00:12 - simple we've split the videos up into
00:14 - two categories gameplay and graphics
00:16 - I'll be handing the gameplay side here
00:19 - we'll learn how to create stuff like
00:20 - player and camera movement interactable
00:22 - x' and items an inventory system
00:24 - equipment character stats enemy AI and
00:27 - combat but the graphics side of things
00:29 - I've teamed up with Sebastian lake with
00:31 - a fellow tutorial creator hello I'll be
00:33 - sharing how to model break and animate a
00:35 - simple character in blender complete
00:37 - with a basic set of armor and a weapon
00:40 - I'll also be showing how to take these
00:42 - graphical elements and integrate them
00:44 - with the gameplay so in these
00:46 - integration episodes we'll be writing
00:48 - code to trigger the correct animations
00:50 - as well as to interface with Becky's
00:52 - equipment system to have the equipment
00:53 - graphics actually show up on the
00:55 - character and animate correctly along
00:57 - with them now since some of you may be
01:00 - interested exclusively in the coding
01:02 - side of things or others perhaps
01:04 - exclusively in the graphics the series
01:06 - will be split into two separate
01:07 - playlists gameplay and graphics the
01:10 - gameplay playlist will contain all of
01:12 - Becky's coding videos as well as my
01:14 - videos on integrating the graphics with
01:16 - the code while the graphics playlist
01:18 - will just contain my blender videos make
01:21 - sure to subscribe to Sebastian's channel
