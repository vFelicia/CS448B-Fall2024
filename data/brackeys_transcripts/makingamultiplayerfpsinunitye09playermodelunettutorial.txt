00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello and
00:04 - welcome to video number nine on making a
00:06 - multiplayer FPS in unity in today's
00:08 - video we're going to take a look at
00:10 - adding some cool graphics to our game
00:12 - most particularly we're going to be
00:14 - adding a player model so that's going to
00:16 - be really awesome before we get started
00:18 - I just want to talk about what's going
00:20 - on with this so if you haven't seen my
00:22 - latest 2d platformer video you don't
00:24 - know that I've changed this video format
00:26 - so I hope you like it as it is now
00:29 - and also I've made a survey where people
00:33 - could answer some questions about how
00:35 - they would like the practice video
00:36 - format to be in the future future and
00:38 - I'm going to make a forum post about
00:42 - that which will be in the description
00:43 - and we can see some of the results on
00:46 - what people have voted for but
00:48 - definitely most people voted that I
00:50 - should keep the face cam so that's what
00:52 - you're going to be seeing in this video
00:54 - so I hope you can bear with me if it's
00:56 - not something of your liking but the
00:58 - people have spoken sort of see so I'll
01:01 - really try and have it so that the face
01:04 - cam is not too distracting or doesn't
01:07 - cover anything up so with that said
01:09 - let's go into today's video all right so
01:12 - you can see um I have this player model
01:15 - folder and I haven't really decided
01:16 - where I want to upload this yet but a
01:19 - link to download it will definitely be
01:21 - in the description and this is an
01:23 - awesome robot model made by semina iDEN
01:26 - and a link to him is also in the
01:28 - description he does client work and he's
01:30 - just great to work with I've done so
01:32 - multiple times and he has great prices
01:36 - and is really experienced so definitely
01:39 - check him out but anyway so we can just
01:42 - import this entire folder you can see it
01:44 - has an FBX file that's a model file and
01:48 - that can be basically opened in pretty
01:51 - much any 3d modeling application if you
01:53 - want to change something we then have
01:55 - the textures for the parts of the robot
01:58 - and for the body which is just a sphere
02:01 - here so you can see we have the
02:03 - different textures in there and the
02:04 - model file itself so what we want to do
02:07 - is simply take this player model folder
02:09 - and drag into a unity just like that and
02:12 - unity will start import
02:14 - all of the different assets this might
02:16 - take a little wild depending on your
02:18 - computer speed I'm recording here so
02:20 - okay it actually wasn't too bad and then
02:23 - it's going to give you a warning here
02:25 - that says it can calculate tangents this
02:28 - can just be ignored that's because we
02:29 - have an empty object within the model
02:32 - hierarchy which we're simply going to
02:35 - delete so it doesn't matter that that's
02:37 - giving us a warning there so you can see
02:40 - we have the player model here and I just
02:41 - want to start by dragging this into the
02:43 - scene and you can see it there and of
02:46 - course make sure the transform is reset
02:48 - and you can see it's way too large so
02:51 - let's go into the play model import
02:53 - settings and scale this down to 0.1 and
02:56 - then hit apply and also now that it has
02:59 - imported the materials we can go ahead
03:02 - and uncheck that and then we can see we
03:05 - have some tangents here we want to
03:08 - calculate those and import the normals
03:10 - so that's perfect hit apply on that we
03:12 - can go into the rig make sure it's set
03:14 - to none and animations and just disable
03:16 - that because there are no animations
03:19 - with this model we're going to create
03:20 - them on our own so you can see now we
03:23 - have the body and parts those are just
03:25 - textures and then we have the materials
03:27 - folder and it's automatically created
03:29 - two different materials for us and
03:31 - that's not quite how we want it set up
03:33 - because if we just move this guy up a
03:35 - bit and our shadow quality is currently
03:37 - awful you can change that under the
03:40 - project settings quality I'm just going
03:42 - to keep it because I'm recording whilst
03:44 - doing this so we can bump it up later so
03:48 - again we can select these different
03:50 - materials and if we just take the body
03:52 - one and color this black you can see
03:54 - that it isn't applied because we lost
03:56 - that connection when we told you not to
03:58 - import the materials so we can go ahead
04:00 - and apply this to the sphere there and
04:04 - then the insides here let's just rename
04:08 - this two parts I'm just using these
04:11 - materials you can go ahead and create
04:12 - them on its it's basically the same
04:14 - thing let's just make this red and we're
04:17 - going to add that to this and to the
04:22 - thrusters those are the pipes and then
04:25 - we can create a three
04:27 - one material and this is going to be the
04:30 - highlight and we can just make this blue
04:35 - and drag it on to there good just so we
04:40 - can know what is what here and then we
04:42 - can expand the player model hierarchy
04:44 - and delete the first object here that
04:46 - one is empty but the rest we are going
04:48 - to need so this is going to be our armor
04:51 - or parts or whatever your armor this is
04:55 - going to be our thrusters this is going
04:59 - to be our body and our eye light so all
05:06 - of these naming and how you choose to do
05:08 - materials it's completely up to you you
05:10 - can take this model and do whatever you
05:11 - want with it but sameen has provided
05:14 - some really awesome materials so let's
05:16 - set those up so let's stop by the with
05:18 - the body here change that to a complete
05:20 - white because we're going to be using a
05:22 - texture to define the old video channel
05:24 - and that's the build body color version
05:27 - here so simply click that and that looks
05:29 - alright but the magic happens when we go
05:33 - in ahead and choose a texture for the
05:36 - metallic setting also because you can
05:38 - drag this around and all that but if we
05:41 - have it defined by a texture things
05:43 - start looking really awesome so simply
05:45 - select the body metal here and you can
05:47 - see what kind of cool shiny look that
05:50 - gives us then we select a normal map
05:52 - that's the body normal and you can see
05:55 - that it's not marked as a normal map we
05:57 - can simply click fix now or you can go
06:00 - ahead and find it and choose normal and
06:02 - then we want a height map and that's
06:05 - going to be our body height and yeah
06:08 - that settings going to be just fine so
06:09 - you can see that is a very nice shiny
06:12 - material that we have there of this kind
06:15 - of well used robot I mean it's not
06:20 - exactly factory new so it's it's well
06:23 - worn good and then we can have some
06:26 - textures for the parts here so again
06:28 - let's change this to white going to the
06:31 - albedo and select parts color then undo
06:37 - metallic and select parts metal
06:40 - and under the normal map and select
06:42 - parts normal and again fixed now and you
06:45 - can see that that gives us this awesome
06:47 - looking texture it's a hand-painted cool
06:53 - so I'm actually really satisfied with
06:55 - that however I want to change the slide
06:57 - just a bit instead of changing the
06:59 - albedo I want that to be some kind of
07:01 - gray and then do an omission instead and
07:05 - we're just going to make this a light
07:08 - blue something like that and you can
07:13 - play around with these settings to make
07:15 - it look even better but I think that
07:17 - gives a really nice impression that this
07:19 - is kind of glowing from the robot we're
07:23 - also going to add some thruster
07:25 - particles at some point but I don't know
07:27 - if we'll be doing that in this tutorial
07:28 - we have a lot of stuff to cover so now
07:31 - that we have this set up and you can say
07:33 - just throw sin that morning again we can
07:36 - just clear that now that we have this
07:38 - set up we can go ahead and add this to
07:40 - our player object so let's drag our
07:43 - player into the scene let's drag our you
07:47 - can see under graphics here we have a
07:48 - player model let's just drag our new
07:50 - player model under there delete the old
07:53 - one continue we are going to lose our
07:56 - prefab connection and then reset the
07:58 - transform on this one and then we can
08:01 - simply hit apply again here to bring
08:03 - back the prefab connection here and you
08:06 - can see that the thrusters are made in
08:08 - such a way that we can actually tilt
08:11 - them in order to simulate the player
08:18 - moving because of force applied from the
08:20 - thrusters so that's kind of the
08:23 - animation that we're going to have some
08:25 - when he's idle we are going to have the
08:26 - thrusters pointing downwards when he's
08:29 - moving forward we're going to have them
08:31 - pointing backwards and when he's moving
08:33 - backwards we're going to have them
08:34 - pointing forwards so that's going to
08:38 - look really awesome but you will also
08:39 - see that he's currently rotated by 180
08:42 - degrees so we're going to flip him over
08:44 - so let's just take the entire player
08:47 - model here and we could just scale him
08:49 - on a negative one on the Z here or we
08:53 - could
08:54 - Tatom I mean this is simply a matter of
08:56 - preference I'm just going to do a 180 on
08:57 - the Y and that's going to work just fine
09:01 - I don't think it's going to have any
09:03 - influence on well anything great so that
09:08 - already looks really awesome and we
09:11 - apply these changes and delete the
09:13 - player we can already take him for spin
09:15 - and these changes will be applied to the
09:18 - actual game or to the network so he will
09:23 - spawn with a cool player model you can
09:26 - see some issues appear however you can
09:28 - see that when we spawn we are actually
09:32 - able to see our own player model and
09:34 - that might be fine for some things but
09:38 - if we have this huge huge piece of armor
09:42 - blocking our screen that's not really
09:46 - something that we want to see so we are
09:48 - definitely going to have to set up some
09:50 - kind of system for disabling that I mean
09:53 - if we go under our player here drag it
09:56 - in here and go under the components to
09:59 - disable but there's nothing nothing
10:02 - really telling this that the Koenen
10:04 - components that we want to disable
10:06 - should be on this object it could be
10:10 - components on other objects and
10:12 - therefore we might just go around and
10:13 - disable renderers on other objects so we
10:16 - can simply add some to this and that's
10:19 - maybe something that we want to do for
10:20 - now so let's just change that so we have
10:23 - room for one more and then find let's
10:27 - lock this and then add a tab inspector
10:31 - add another inspector have this over
10:34 - here that one is locked this one is not
10:36 - then we find our armor and take the mesh
10:41 - renderer on that and drag it know that
10:45 - can actually not be disabled here so it
10:48 - seems that the mesh renderer is not
10:51 - actually a behavior okay it's definitely
10:57 - a component but it's not a behavior so
11:01 - that's fine and that that's definite is
11:04 - something that we can take care of I
11:05 - mean we can add another list
11:07 - here we can add a custom mesh renderer
11:09 - we could have a list that disabled
11:12 - objects or we could add a mask to the
11:15 - camera we have so many options for
11:18 - getting this to work however what I want
11:20 - to do now is simply ignore it so let's
11:23 - just see when we'll have time for that
11:25 - it's an easy fix when we get to it but
11:27 - right now I have some other stuff that I
11:29 - want to focus on so let's just close
11:32 - that tab there and we'll come back to it
11:34 - a bit later so what I wanted to have a
11:38 - look at now is synchronizing is is
11:41 - animating these thrusters and then
11:44 - syncing that over the network and unity
11:47 - has some awesome ways I'm syncing
11:49 - animations and they have what is called
11:52 - a network if we go and here a network
11:54 - animator which requires a normal
11:57 - animator as in a variable slot and then
12:01 - you are able to choose what properties
12:03 - you want to sing over the network
12:05 - however that doesn't smooth anything out
12:08 - so if you want smooth rotation which is
12:12 - something that we want smooth blending
12:15 - that doesn't really work so what we're
12:18 - going to do is we're going to rotate
12:19 - these locally and then add a network
12:22 - transform child to sync their rotation
12:24 - over the network because that will
12:26 - actually apply smoothing so it's maybe
12:28 - not the best way but it's definitely
12:30 - going to work just fine so let's do that
12:33 - let's start by adding some animation so
12:36 - let's find our animation window it's
12:38 - under window animation or press control
12:41 - 6 and in here if we select our player
12:45 - we're able to create a new animator and
12:47 - animation clip let's set create go onto
12:50 - our player model make a new folder
12:52 - called animation go under that folder
12:57 - and in here we are going to let's make
13:01 - the idle animation first and we can
13:05 - simply make sure that this is red and
13:07 - those are red and then we can go on to
13:09 - graphics player model thrusters simply
13:12 - select those again make sure to click
13:15 - this
13:17 - and now we are recording so that means
13:19 - that we can actually change our rotation
13:22 - here so these are actually a bit offset
13:24 - I don't know if you want to start with
13:26 - those offsets let's just disable the
13:28 - animation there and try and reset this
13:32 - no because we want them to be scaled
13:34 - let's just zero that out zero that and
13:39 - that out no it doesn't look good okay
13:44 - so we'll just keep all of these settings
13:45 - and then only change this that's fine so
13:48 - let's hit record again and when we're
13:51 - not moving well we want to change those
13:53 - so they are pointing downwards and the
13:56 - anchor here is not perfect so let's just
13:58 - do about negative 40 that should make
14:01 - them point downwards yeah just by
14:04 - measurement of the eye and just to make
14:08 - sure that this is working let's copy
14:09 - these keyframes move over with one
14:11 - second and paste them again so we're
14:13 - just going to have this animation state
14:15 - here it's not going to do any animation
14:17 - on the timeline we instead going to be
14:19 - blending using the speed of our object
14:22 - but you'll see that in a sec so let's
14:25 - now create a new clip let's call this
14:28 - one move forward and again select the
14:35 - thrusters make sure we're recording find
14:39 - the rotation parameter and I believe
14:42 - we're simply going to set this to
14:44 - negative 90 that looks right and let's
14:50 - copy those over to one second great
14:54 - let's create the last clip here and this
14:56 - is going to be move backward and again
15:04 - select the thruster record and let's
15:06 - simply select zero here copy that for
15:10 - one second stop recording and that was
15:13 - it that was all we needed to do to make
15:15 - our animations and we can just close
15:17 - those off now let's go into the project
15:20 - go and do the pom pom pom pom pom player
15:24 - model animation and find our animation
15:29 - controller here called player
15:31 - just going to call this player
15:33 - controller or play your animation player
15:37 - and them controller there we go let's
15:40 - stop a click that to open it up in the
15:42 - animator and let's just make some room
15:44 - for the animator here and you can see
15:47 - that we have three animation states we
15:49 - have an idle and move forward and a move
15:51 - backward and they each have their
15:53 - associated animation so idle move
15:57 - forward and move backward but we should
16:01 - just go ahead and delete these because
16:03 - we don't want to transition between them
16:05 - by using some kind of boolean state or
16:08 - whether or not we are passing some kind
16:13 - of requirement and then we transition no
16:16 - we want to transition fluently so we
16:17 - want making them the unity animation
16:20 - system to blend between them and
16:22 - therefore we can create what is called a
16:25 - plain tree so right click create state
16:27 - from new plan tree and we can go ahead
16:31 - and rename this to move because it's
16:33 - basically all of our movement in one
16:36 - state and if we then double click on
16:40 - this we open up the move blend tree and
16:43 - you can see this have has a blend
16:45 - parameter and currently that goes
16:47 - between 0 & & 1 and that is kind of that
16:52 - that is the value that will blend
16:54 - between the animations so that's going
16:56 - to be represent our forward speed so we
17:00 - can go ahead and rename this to forward
17:03 - and I was going to say speed here but
17:06 - senses can both be a negative and
17:08 - positive for forward and backwards
17:10 - movement I'm going to say forward
17:12 - velocity and but currently this goes
17:16 - from 0 to 1 and I'm going to show you
17:18 - how to change that so over here in the
17:19 - right hand side we want to add our three
17:22 - motions or 3 animation Clips so let's
17:24 - create add motion field add motion field
17:27 - add motion field in the middle we're
17:30 - going to put our idle at the beginning
17:33 - we are going to put our forward and down
17:37 - here we're going to put our backward
17:39 - then we uncheck automate thresholds and
17:43 - then we say okay
17:44 - when we're moving forward we want to
17:46 - this to be a one when we are standing
17:49 - still we want our speed to be zero and
17:51 - when we are moving backwards we want our
17:54 - speed to be negative one so we have this
17:57 - value clamp between negative one and one
17:59 - and the animation will be will blend
18:03 - using this value so if we now select our
18:07 - player and select our blend tree we can
18:10 - actually preview this down here it's
18:13 - currently set to zero if I okay so this
18:15 - is a place where my FaceCam is probably
18:18 - blocking everything let me just move
18:20 - this up a bit here I promised I wouldn't
18:24 - let it block anything so here you can
18:27 - see it just add a a forward velocity of
18:34 - zero if we then move this up you can see
18:37 - that the thruster is go backwards and if
18:40 - we move it down we can see that they
18:43 - turn forward here so that's perfect so
18:46 - we can easily blend between this in a
18:49 - very nice and fluent way so I'm going to
18:53 - move this back down because we're not
18:55 - going to be needing it anymore there we
18:57 - go and we can basically start applying
19:02 - the forward velocity using a script so
19:04 - we can just drag this back here there we
19:07 - go then we can select our player make
19:10 - sure that we have our player and
19:12 - controller here and that everything is
19:13 - looking great which it is then we can go
19:16 - in and find a script where we can change
19:19 - this so I suggest we do that inside of
19:21 - the player controller because this is
19:23 - what where we calculate our velocity
19:25 - where our speed variable is which we are
19:28 - going to be needing in order to make
19:29 - sure let's clamp between minus 1 and 1
19:32 - and all that stuff so in here let's add
19:36 - a new serialized field private animator
19:42 - which we are just going to call animator
19:46 - and then in this start method here
19:49 - actually let's not make this a serialize
19:52 - field let's require this so let's we
19:56 - require
19:59 - component of type animator let's move
20:06 - this down here where we cash out
20:10 - components so this is component caching
20:17 - and then here we simply add it so
20:21 - animator equals get component and mater
20:25 - there we go
20:27 - now we're sure it's there because again
20:29 - animator nut animation because we
20:32 - required a up there so for some reason
20:36 - the recording cut out here and it's
20:37 - lacking some audio but I'll just quickly
20:39 - tell you what we did first off we
20:42 - removed the dot normalised but we kept
20:45 - the parentheses you see me adding them
20:46 - back in there then we change the two
20:48 - input lines from get access raw to
20:50 - simply get access that makes the input
20:53 - much more smooth we could smooth that
20:55 - ourselves but unity does it it does a
20:57 - great job actually next up you can see
21:01 - me making a comment here because we are
21:03 - now animating our movement we do this by
21:05 - calling set float on our animator the
21:07 - float we want to change is forward
21:09 - velocity and we want to set it to this
21:11 - set movement and just clear out some
21:16 - warnings here those are just from the
21:18 - new update and they're definitely not
21:20 - important so we won't be looking at
21:22 - those right now and this should now be
21:27 - working locally so let's try and remove
21:30 - that after having applied the changes
21:33 - play the game going to land host and we
21:35 - can maybe zoom out here so we can see
21:37 - what's going on land host yeah it's
21:40 - working so you can see how this is
21:42 - smooth the movement is now much smoother
21:45 - and I think it's a nice amount of smooth
21:48 - it's not overdone and you can see how
21:51 - the thruster is down here change as we
21:55 - move cool
21:59 - so that actually looks very nice and I
22:01 - think it helps give the impression that
22:03 - this robot is actually moving for reason
22:07 - not just adding forces out of thin air
22:11 - next up is sinking this over the network
22:14 - and that might sound really difficult
22:16 - and I definitely had some trouble
22:17 - figuring out the best way to do this but
22:20 - once you know how it's really easy so
22:22 - let's just search for chat transform and
22:24 - then add the network transform child
22:26 - component we've already added one of
22:29 - those up here and we're going to add one
22:31 - with basically the same settings except
22:33 - this time if we drag the player into the
22:36 - hierarchy we're going to go into the
22:37 - graphics player model and instead of
22:40 - having the are having the camera
22:43 - transform we're going to have our
22:45 - thrusters as the target and the movement
22:49 - threshold is going to be the same here
22:51 - again in turbulent movement it's going
22:53 - to be zero this is final point three and
22:56 - we only want to sink our X so it's all
22:59 - of the same values as up here but
23:01 - remember to change the target then we're
23:03 - going to apply this and we can again
23:08 - remove this from the scene and I think
23:11 - we are ready to build this actually so
23:12 - whoops some kind of null reference
23:16 - that's caused by unity I think I don't
23:19 - think we need to worry about that so
23:21 - let's just make sure yeah we have a
23:24 - target here and our animated looks fine
23:26 - I can't see any issues with this so
23:28 - let's try and build this control V or
23:30 - command B and see if it's working so
23:39 - this is taking an odd amount of time
23:41 - here okay great
23:44 - and hit plane here actually I'm just
23:48 - going to wait for it to calculate the
23:50 - lighting here there we go and you can
23:54 - see here that this is waiting so let's
23:56 - make this the host and make this decline
23:59 - and watch this guy now as we start to
24:02 - move no okay so this is not working and
24:08 - I know why do you know why think about
24:11 - this okay so if we take a look at our
24:15 - player here actually I should have
24:17 - waited and taking a look at the other
24:19 - guy so in here we have an animator we
24:22 - have a player mode and a player
24:24 - controller
24:25 - the animator uses the animation
24:29 - controller to every frame check for
24:32 - different values and then transition the
24:34 - animation depending on those values and
24:36 - those values are the properties or the
24:39 - parameters up here and this starts it's
24:43 - a value of 0 so we have a starting
24:45 - forward velocity of 0 unless it's
24:48 - changed by the player motor or the
24:51 - player controller however under our
24:55 - player setup we have this array of
24:57 - components to disable we disable the
24:59 - player motor and all of a bunch of stuff
25:01 - we also disabled the player controller
25:04 - so that's me that means that for all
25:06 - clients which are not the local client
25:09 - the arm or for all players which is not
25:13 - the local player the player controller
25:18 - is going to be disabled and therefore
25:19 - the animator is never going to
25:22 - experience a property of forward
25:25 - velocity other than zero so it's always
25:27 - going to have a forward velocity of zero
25:29 - there's nothing there to change it and
25:30 - that will overwrite whatever information
25:33 - we sync using our network transform
25:36 - child so if we stop this now and find
25:39 - our player we can actually simply expand
25:43 - our player setup go into components to
25:46 - disable add room from one more and drag
25:50 - in our animator and I think that will do
25:54 - it so I think that will basically be it
25:56 - so now we can build this one more time
25:58 - oops hit the wrong key there let's build
26:01 - this one more time and hopefully this
26:05 - time it's going to work
26:08 - let's have that there and this is why
26:10 - net debugging over the network is so
26:13 - difficult because you can have stuff
26:15 - overriding each other without giving any
26:17 - errors and it's K can be such a pain to
26:21 - debug so again let's observe here let's
26:27 - drag this over here client again look
26:30 - over here yes so now it's working that
26:34 - was indeed the error and it actually
26:36 - looks very very smooth
26:38 - with these physics here we have going on
26:41 - it really looks like he's floating on
26:43 - some thrusters so I think that's just
26:45 - perfect and you will notice that if we
26:48 - give it a bit too much force here and
26:50 - drop down you can see the thruster
26:52 - simply clip through the ground but I
26:54 - don't think that's an issue right now I
26:55 - think we have other stuff to look at so
26:58 - that looks really really cool
27:01 - what the heck let let's add some
27:04 - particles so now if we drag our player
27:07 - in here we can we can add some player
27:13 - thruster particles down here so in order
27:16 - to do this let's right-click go import
27:22 - package particle systems because if I
27:25 - remember correctly unity has some really
27:28 - cool default thruster particles we're
27:30 - not going to be spending too much time
27:32 - on this that would be kind of silly but
27:34 - I definitely think that we should add
27:35 - some of them did I not hit particles
27:38 - here we have all kinds of control stuff
27:42 - don't want any of that
27:44 - none okay so that's like none here and
27:46 - just find the ones that we want so the
27:48 - standard assets no input all of the
27:51 - particle systems of the prefabs don't
27:58 - think we're going to be needing any of
28:00 - the scripts let's just keep them shaders
28:04 - textures none of the utility none of
28:08 - this other stuff okay so that's all
28:10 - we're going to be using here so let's
28:12 - import that this might take a little
28:16 - while okay that was actually quite
28:17 - speedy again let's go into the console
28:21 - just clear those warnings and now we can
28:24 - go into standard assets particle systems
28:26 - now you can see we have some different
28:28 - stuff in here let's find a cool prefab
28:30 - so let's find the afterburner one this
28:33 - was exactly the one that I wanted to
28:35 - find so you can see this is a quite a
28:38 - huge particle system but I think it
28:42 - looks really really cool and it gives
28:44 - this subtle but awesome looking effect
28:47 - of an afterburner
28:49 - so let's definitely keep this but just
28:51 - change it a bit
28:52 - so we definitely want this to be smaller
28:56 - in any kind of way possible so we have
28:59 - this glow here it's that just that's
29:01 - another particle system and the
29:05 - afterburn itself so the glow okay it's
29:09 - just a centered glowy effect there let's
29:12 - just take this one at a time so let's
29:13 - start by looking at the afterburner and
29:20 - this is currently really long so let's
29:23 - start by changing the last lifetime on
29:25 - this to something like 0.1 and maybe
29:29 - bump down the start speed a bit too so
29:31 - let's set this to 20 think that looks a
29:37 - lot better and definitely we want the
29:40 - size of these to be much smaller too so
29:43 - let's try 0.2 and to 0.4 that is better
29:52 - but we definitely want the speed to be
29:55 - lower 10 looks pretty decent but we
30:01 - might want to spawn more or set this
30:05 - lifetime a bit longer because currently
30:08 - we can see between these so the rate
30:10 - here is 80 and that's already a pretty
30:13 - high spawn rate but we can set it to 120
30:16 - that's not going to matter and this is
30:20 - starting to look like something that we
30:22 - can add to the first edge here so let's
30:26 - just take this now going to player
30:28 - graphics player model thrusters and
30:30 - let's add the afterburners here so let's
30:32 - go on to thruster let's reset the
30:34 - transform on this let's drag this out
30:39 - down here try and position these as
30:43 - accurately as possible yeah that's not
30:48 - far off so let's drag it down a bit
30:50 - something like that and we also need to
30:54 - rotate this to point the right way
31:02 - almost correct oops
31:08 - something like that looks like a great
31:11 - starting point awesome
31:14 - it's not totally even we can do better
31:21 - that looks pretty great awesome so you
31:26 - can see here it's still a pretty long
31:28 - effect so I think we can actually just
31:31 - make the speed lower again so let's
31:33 - change this to 5 yeah that looks much
31:36 - better and we can even move it a bit up
31:38 - in the tube that's fine and then we need
31:41 - to rotate it a bit in widths actually we
31:46 - can do a bit more something like that
31:51 - that's might maybe a - a bit too much
31:55 - yeah that looks really great and move it
31:58 - over a bit awesome and you can fill it
32:01 - around with this as much as you want I'm
32:04 - just going to keep it like this for now
32:06 - and then we can add the globe back in
32:08 - and this is going to be probably a too
32:10 - big a bit too big now you can see just
32:15 - how large that is it goes all the way
32:18 - through the ground so let's just change
32:21 - the speed of this on to four and it's
32:26 - going to limit it whoops I don't know
32:31 - why it zoomed out so far there we go see
32:36 - just how launched these particles are so
32:38 - the stat size here is going to be
32:40 - something like 0.5 to 0.6 looks better
32:48 - and the lifetime 0.3 smaller point one
32:55 - point two two point four three two
33:01 - that's pretty I actually really like the
33:05 - look of that for some reason it goes out
33:09 - really far when I try to focus on it so
33:11 - let's try and simulate that that looks
33:13 - awesome okay so I'm really happy with
33:16 - that effect
33:18 - I think we can just go ahead and add
33:19 - this to the other side as well so this
33:22 - this is going to be afterburner one we
33:26 - can duplicate this and do afterburner
33:28 - two actually let's make this left and
33:31 - right so this is going to be afterburner
33:37 - underscore it left and this is going to
33:43 - be afterburner underscore right and
33:47 - we're going to look from the direction
33:48 - of the player here so we are going to
33:50 - inverse the x-axis like that and then we
34:02 - are going to be can maybe just scale it
34:04 - on the X as well that's doing negative
34:07 - here no that doesn't work so we have to
34:10 - inverse on the rotation here as well so
34:13 - let's the up-and-down that's going to be
34:16 - fine
34:16 - so the Y here should be shifted a bit
34:24 - and I think that looks pretty great yeah
34:34 - so let's go ahead and see how that looks
34:36 - in the game so close that close that
34:39 - then and that let's hit apply
34:42 - remove the player save and let's hit
34:47 - play LAN host whoops okay so we are
34:53 - definitely flying something is happening
34:55 - here maybe I forgot to remove some
34:57 - script or some swords on these so the
35:00 - thrusters are here you have to burn it
35:03 - yeah there we go
35:05 - they have a physics force and a Collider
35:07 - we want none of that so let's delete
35:10 - them both the physics force and the
35:15 - collider they were adding some kind of
35:16 - force we don't want that to happen so
35:21 - that's it applied to that again say that
35:24 - going and hit play land host it says the
35:29 - reference script on this game
35:31 - behavior is missing so again there is
35:36 - something so let's just move out here
35:38 - find our player graphics play model
35:41 - thrusters it's like both glow objects
35:45 - and let's remove that not that it
35:47 - matters but it's nice to just remove a
35:50 - unnecessary warning that also always
35:53 - feels good so let's apply that delete
35:56 - the player let's try this one last time
35:58 - so let's say play LAN host and now you
36:03 - can see the thrusters are looking great
36:05 - so we can of course get those to vary
36:08 - depending on what we are doing for now I
36:10 - just want them to be a constant thing
36:13 - give the impression that something is
36:16 - holding us up we can definitely also do
36:18 - some hover bouncing or something but
36:22 - we'll see with all of that so that was
36:24 - basically all I could come up with for
36:27 - this tutorial
36:28 - next time will probably take care of the
36:30 - stuff that is currently blocking our
36:32 - screen maybe do something about the
36:34 - environment - I don't know so we'll have
36:36 - a see in the next video but thanks for
36:38 - watching I hope you enjoyed it and I'll
36:40 - see you in the next video
