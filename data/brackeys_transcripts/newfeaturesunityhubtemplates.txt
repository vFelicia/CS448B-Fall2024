00:00 - so unity has released a new launcher
00:01 - called unity hub and along with it some
00:04 - cool templates that you can use as a
00:06 - starting point for new projects and they
00:08 - are actually really exciting unity hub
00:11 - and the templates are currently in
00:12 - preview you can try them out by using
00:14 - the link in the description now let's
00:16 - begin by having a look at unity hub at
00:18 - first glance it looks pretty similar to
00:20 - the old one you can view all your latest
00:22 - projects as well as open or create new
00:24 - ones but there's actually a lot of new
00:27 - functionality packed into it as well one
00:29 - of the most important things for me is
00:31 - that it's a standalone program which
00:33 - means that it's not installed together
00:34 - with the editor if you like me and use
00:37 - unity a lot you probably have a folder
00:38 - that lurks something like this which
00:41 - isn't pretty
00:42 - luckily the launcher can now be used as
00:44 - a central place to keep track of your
00:46 - unity versions it also makes it easy to
00:48 - find and download the latest releases
00:50 - including beta versions which is just
00:53 - really nice for people like me who want
00:54 - to try out new features to open a
00:57 - project with a particular version all
00:59 - you have to do is click the icon to the
01:00 - right and select the version you want
01:02 - you can also now have two versions of
01:04 - unity oven running at the same time
01:06 - however make sure not to open the same
01:08 - project twice that will probably lead to
01:11 - errors now let's dive into the real meat
01:13 - of the changes templates using templates
01:16 - you can choose between different default
01:18 - configurations of unity we've had this
01:20 - for a while in terms of the 2d and 3d
01:22 - modes which change a few things with
01:24 - lighting camera and the scene view and
01:26 - these templates still exist in much the
01:28 - same way as before
01:29 - however there are now four more
01:31 - templates to choose from all these
01:33 - templates will create a new project
01:35 - which includes
01:36 - a readme with a short description as was
01:38 - the same basic example seen you can use
01:41 - this to see how lighting materials and
01:43 - post-processing can be set up if you
01:45 - don't want the example content you can
01:47 - delete the example as its object from
01:49 - the hierarchy and the folder from the
01:50 - project this should give you an empty
01:52 - scene to start working in now what is
01:55 - the difference between these templates
01:56 - and which one should you choose well
01:59 - because of the templates use the same
02:01 - example scene we can easily compare the
02:03 - visual differences between them let's
02:05 - start with 3d with extras this time that
02:08 - is a great starting point for new users
02:10 - or people who want to start with the
02:11 - basic proven to work settings
02:13 - the template uses the buildin render
02:15 - pipeline it has a linear color space it
02:18 - tweaks the lighting up in and add some
02:20 - simple post-processing effects so
02:21 - actually it pretty much does the same
02:23 - thing as shown in our how to get good
02:25 - graphics video I imagine I'll be using
02:27 - this a lot now the lightweight render
02:29 - pipeline template is all about
02:30 - performance and therefore it has the
02:32 - lowest graphical fidelity this template
02:35 - targets lower end hardware so it's great
02:37 - for mobile or people who are making
02:38 - games with limited lighting needs of
02:40 - course this template uses descriptive
02:42 - already ring pipeline because of this
02:44 - you can always go to project settings
02:45 - then graphics
02:47 - to further customize your graphic
02:48 - settings the template comes with three
02:50 - example quality levels moving on to the
02:53 - lightweight virtual reality rendering
02:55 - pipeline template this time that is very
02:57 - similar to the normal lightweight one
02:59 - except it's even more optimized and
03:01 - geared specifically towards VR it also
03:04 - comes with an X R rigged so you can
03:06 - start moving around right away finally
03:09 - the high definition render pipeline
03:11 - template is where you will get the
03:12 - highest amount of graphical fidelity
03:14 - this template is intended for high end
03:16 - hardware only and office the full
03:19 - rendering capability unity has to offer
03:21 - with SRP this is meant for developers
03:23 - who want to create photorealistic games
03:25 - and take advantage of the latest and
03:27 - greatest rendering features now what
03:29 - this means in practice is for another
03:31 - video but this template does come with
03:33 - stuff like a new light editor new
03:35 - materials including option for
03:36 - subsurface scattering real-time area
03:39 - lights and honestly much more so that is
03:42 - the difference between them now all the
03:44 - templates also come with a camera script
03:46 - that allows you to fly around the scene
03:48 - while in play mode as well as a number
03:50 - of presets that might make your life
03:51 - easier for example when importing a
03:53 - texture fun that we can expect to see
03:56 - more features added to unity hub in the
03:58 - future this mainly includes an activity
04:00 - feed as well as some stuff aimed at
04:02 - making it easier for newcomers and maybe
04:05 - more importantly we can expect to see
04:06 - more templates being added in fact unity
04:09 - is currently working towards allowing
04:10 - users to create and share their own
04:12 - templates which is definitely exciting
04:14 - so again if you want to get your hands
04:17 - on unity hub and the new templates
04:18 - simply use the link in the description I
04:20 - also just want to give a quick shout out
