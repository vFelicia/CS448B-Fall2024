00:00 - - So Unity 2019.3
00:01 - is just around the corner.
00:03 - In fact, it's currently in public beta
00:05 - and it's looking really cool.
00:07 - So let's have a look at
00:08 - what's new in Unity 2019.3.
00:11 - But first this video is sponsored
00:12 - by popcore.com.
00:14 - Popcore is an exciting gaming startup
00:16 - based in Berlin
00:17 - that creates engaging hybrid casual games.
00:19 - The games have been downloaded
00:21 - more than 100 million times,
00:23 - and if you're an avid gamer
00:24 - you have likely already stumbled
00:25 - upon their top charting games,
00:27 - such as Sandwich, Wrecking Ball
00:29 - and Marvellous 3D.
00:31 - Right now, they're hiring
00:32 - ambitious Unity developers
00:34 - and artists,
00:35 - who are eager to work
00:35 - with the latest technology
00:37 - and build unique experiences
00:38 - that entertain millions of fans every day.
00:41 - So if you're not afraid
00:41 - to take ownership
00:42 - and create games within a few days,
00:44 - instead of months or years,
00:46 - definitely click the link
00:47 - in the description
00:48 - to check out their current job openings.
00:50 - Now, let's jump right into it,
00:52 - and talk about the new
00:53 - full Editor UI redesign.
00:55 - Overall the UI is a lot more flat
00:57 - and modern,
00:58 - so far I think it has potential.
01:00 - Of course as always,
01:01 - Unity is encouraging feedback
01:03 - so I'll just mention a few tweaks
01:04 - that I personally feel
01:05 - could make it even better.
01:07 - Overall I think it's very boxy,
01:08 - which is fine,
01:09 - but I feel it adds
01:10 - some unnecessary complexity
01:12 - when just looking at a blank editor.
01:14 - I think the asset icons
01:15 - in the project panel
01:16 - aren't very clear.
01:17 - The distance between the letters
01:18 - in the font is a bit too smaller,
01:20 - and some of the text elements
01:21 - seem inconsistently sized.
01:22 - I also think that the way
01:23 - the buttons in the scene view
01:25 - are separated is a bit messy
01:27 - and that the icons in the console
01:28 - don't really fit.
01:29 - But then again,
01:30 - isn't it always this way
01:31 - with new UI,
01:32 - the package manager
01:33 - has also gotten some improvements.
01:35 - You can now instal packages
01:36 - from a Git repository via URL,
01:39 - which is really cool.
01:40 - It's also getting more integrated
01:42 - with the Asset Store
01:43 - and you can now quickly instal
01:44 - Asset Store assets
01:45 - you've used before.
01:46 - Now, when it comes to tools for artists,
01:49 - the effects graph is out of preview,
01:50 - and it's getting better integrated
01:52 - with shader graph
01:53 - to allow the two systems
01:54 - to talk more fluently together.
01:56 - And yes, it's finally here,
01:59 - with the new update
02:00 - to the terrain system,
02:01 - you can now paint holes
02:02 - in your terrain.
02:03 - Wooo!
02:04 - With animation rigging,
02:05 - you can now use the timeline to preview
02:07 - and key frame animations
02:08 - on rich characters.
02:10 - The good thing about this
02:11 - is that it enables
02:12 - multi-track layered animation
02:14 - to be edited easily with the timeline
02:16 - so you can create cinematic sequences
02:18 - with multiple characters, props,
02:20 - and cameras
02:21 - while modifying animation clips.
02:23 - And one of the really big changes
02:24 - of 2019 0.3 is the UI builder.
02:28 - This is now available
02:29 - as a preview package.
02:30 - And while I haven't gotten much time
02:32 - to play around with it,
02:33 - I think it has the potential
02:34 - to be a really powerful tool.
02:36 - That being said,
02:37 - it still seems very early.
02:39 - And the overall feel of the tool
02:40 - is a lot different
02:41 - than what I'm used to
02:42 - when working in Unity.
02:43 - I'm curious to see how the tool
02:45 - will evolve from here
02:46 - and when it's good to start using this,
02:47 - instead of the current uGUI.
02:49 - In terms of graphics,
02:51 - HDRP is now out of preview
02:53 - and Unity 2019.3 is the version
02:56 - where the lightweight render pipeline
02:58 - is being renamed
02:59 - to universal render pipeline.
03:01 - This is now the standard render pipeline
03:02 - to use in Unity,
03:04 - as it runs on all platforms
03:05 - and can still produce
03:06 - really beautiful results.
03:08 - With this change,
03:09 - post-processing has been revamped
03:10 - and it's integrated directly
03:12 - into the pipeline.
03:13 - It currently has all the effects
03:14 - you would expect,
03:15 - and it now supports the volumes,
03:17 - which is definitely needed.
03:18 - Also the light limit has been increased
03:20 - from 32 to 256,
03:22 - and it can now shape
03:23 - up to eight lights
03:24 - on the same object.
03:25 - And talking about the lighting,
03:27 - the progressive light mapper
03:28 - has gotten some speed improvements
03:30 - leading to smoother
03:31 - editor interaction when baking.
03:33 - It also has a new AI denoiser
03:35 - that allows you to get away with
03:37 - using fewer assembles
03:38 - to get the same results.
03:40 - Overall, it looks like
03:41 - the GPU light mapper
03:42 - is getting closer and closer
03:43 - to being the main tool to use.
03:45 - In terms of Physics,
03:47 - the PhysX library has been upgraded
03:49 - from 3.4 to 4.1.
03:51 - This comes with
03:52 - some accuracy improvements,
03:53 - especially for handling joints
03:55 - and better performance.
03:56 - Personally, I think this is a bit hard
03:58 - to get excited about
03:59 - since Unity has already introduced
04:00 - a whole new DOTS-based physics system,
04:03 - as well as support for a havoc.
04:05 - So that's mostly
04:05 - what I'm looking towards.
04:07 - Unity's support for STADIA
04:08 - is now production ready,
04:09 - including features like DOTS
04:11 - and HDRP.
04:12 - In terms of 2D,
04:13 - a lot of packages
04:14 - are now coming out of preview,
04:15 - they are on the screen now,
04:17 - and the timelines now
04:18 - also support 2D lights.
04:19 - As of 2019.3,
04:21 - the new asset import pipeline
04:23 - is the default for new projects.
04:25 - It aims to save time
04:26 - with faster platform switching
04:28 - and lays the foundation
04:29 - for faster imports.
04:30 - Unity is also making
04:31 - the asset pipeline scale better
04:33 - for very large projects.
04:35 - And in other great news,
04:36 - the Unity distribution portal
04:38 - is now in beta.
04:39 - This enables you to distribute your game
04:41 - to multiple app stores
04:42 - through a single hub.
04:44 - Currently, I see that
04:44 - they're still lacking support
04:45 - for a lot of large game stores
04:47 - like the Apple Store
04:48 - and Google Play,
04:49 - but it looks like
04:50 - more are planned to come.
04:51 - Also Unity as a library
04:53 - allows you to embed Unity
04:55 - as its own library
04:56 - inside of native apps.
04:57 - The new accelerator speeds up working
04:59 - on remote projects.
05:00 - Version control is getting an overhaul,
05:01 - including improved merging,
05:03 - and you can now into play mode faster
05:05 - by choosing how Unity handles script
05:07 - and seeing changes.
05:08 - Because if you don't need
05:09 - to reload the entire scene,
05:11 - you can enter play mode so much faster.
05:13 - Just take a look at
05:14 - some of these results.
05:15 - Finally, the device simulator
05:17 - allows you to simulate your game
05:18 - running on another device.
05:20 - This will not just resize the game
05:22 - to fit a certain screen format.
05:24 - It will actually trick the editor
05:25 - into thinking that the game
05:26 - is running on the device
05:28 - to help you test more in depth,
05:29 - such as if assets are loading correctly.
05:32 - Now, this video simply had
05:34 - too many features to cover
05:35 - in this video.
05:36 - Here's a list of some of them.
05:38 - Finally, 2019.3 comes with a number
05:41 - of smaller changes
05:42 - and bug fixes.
