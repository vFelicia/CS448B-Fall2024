00:00 - [Music]
00:03 - hello everyone and welcome to day and
00:06 - night cycles in our unity survival game
00:09 - series done by Brad keys I am the CEO of
00:12 - Brad keys and this is video number 22 in
00:15 - which we are going to cover again making
00:18 - the skyboxes blend implementing a
00:23 - day/night cycle in that the light will
00:26 - change both the direction and the
00:28 - intensity and we will have both a moon
00:32 - and a Sun orbit across the sky so that's
00:38 - going to be really really awesome
00:41 - so in this video we are not going to
00:43 - create the script ourselves and we're
00:47 - not going to create the different assets
00:49 - either but I will help you understand on
00:52 - first of all how to implement these
00:54 - things and make it really nice and also
00:58 - giving you're giving it your own touch
01:00 - and also helping you understand how some
01:04 - of these techniques actually work so
01:08 - again this is a beginners tutorial so I
01:10 - won't go too much in depth but that's
01:13 - what game making is about if I had to
01:16 - type out every single script I used for
01:20 - different projects I would never ever
01:24 - get anything done because sometimes you
01:26 - just have to reuse things cool so as
01:30 - always I've opened up unity and let me
01:33 - just give you a quick demo of what we
01:35 - are going to be making so I fired up a
01:38 - scene here and when I start out it's
01:41 - nighttime and I have set up the speed a
01:44 - bit and you can see the moon there going
01:46 - down and light starts to come on and now
01:49 - we should see the Sun rising there so
01:52 - the light gets really red and as the Sun
01:57 - gets higher up we will see the light
01:59 - being more and more intense and as it
02:05 - starts going down again it shifts back
02:08 - to the reddish tint and now the
02:11 - intensity should
02:13 - start going away and the moon rises in
02:17 - the other side of the map and so this
02:20 - will just loop into infinity and we can
02:24 - change the point of day with this slider
02:26 - in the left hand corner for testing
02:29 - purposes we are going to leave it here
02:31 - for quite a while so it's really nice to
02:34 - have both so we can quickly see what
02:38 - time of the day it is not only by
02:40 - looking up and also so that we can
02:44 - change out the environment and feel and
02:46 - different models in different lighting
02:49 - so cool let's hit stop playing and now
02:53 - this DNC I'll just keep the scene there
02:57 - if that's something we need to
02:58 - cross-reference but this is just what I
03:01 - used for the day/night cycle
03:03 - preview here we are going to go ahead
03:07 - and just take the advanced di the
03:09 - respawn menu and the player stats all V
03:12 - 2 version 2 and just drag them under the
03:15 - scripts folder because we're not going
03:17 - to be needing that and then we're going
03:20 - to take the stay and night cycles folder
03:23 - which I have just made and we can just
03:25 - go ahead and delete that and actually
03:28 - let's just go ahead and delete this
03:30 - scene also and now we can open up our
03:34 - usual main scene and we are back so when
03:38 - you will notice that here there is a
03:41 - test folder lying here and this is just
03:43 - because I'm testing out some mechanics
03:45 - with some arms in which we are going to
03:47 - implement later and once we have them in
03:50 - place we will also start taking a look
03:52 - at stuff like picking up weapons and so
03:56 - but that's in the future for now let's
04:00 - go ahead and see how you can implement
04:02 - this day/night cycle all right so if we
04:06 - go to the desktop here the the things
04:12 - you'll need will be included in our
04:13 - survival assets pack which you can again
04:16 - download from our website and we have a
04:18 - bonus video if you don't know how to
04:20 - extract them and use them so once you
04:23 - have extracted Streck to them you should
04:25 - see them here
04:27 - and if we double-click there will be a
04:29 - unity package file arm called day/night
04:34 - cycle and you can just go ahead and
04:36 - simply take this drag it into unity into
04:40 - the project pane release and then hit
04:44 - import and this won't do anything to
04:47 - your project other than input 1 folder
04:49 - code day/night cycle there we have it so
04:54 - it won't mess anything up
04:55 - don't worry and that won't be placed
04:57 - files all over it that will just be
04:59 - enough new folder in the assets called
05:01 - day/night cycle now we can go ahead and
05:06 - implement the most important part of
05:09 - this day/night cycle with which is the
05:12 - prefab called time of day or Tod so if
05:17 - we open up our hard folder and and four
05:22 - things will appear with a material
05:24 - folder which you don't need to change
05:26 - this just contains the different sky
05:29 - boxes and some properties that will
05:32 - allow them to blend this contains a
05:35 - shader which will help with just that so
05:38 - this will help transition fade and blend
05:42 - these sky boxes together and since
05:45 - shading is completely new I won't
05:47 - explain exactly how this works then we
05:50 - have the time of day script which you
05:52 - are of course fully allowed to change
05:55 - just play around with it and make it how
05:58 - you want to be and then we have the
06:00 - actual prefab and for now the image here
06:04 - is just the moon but it also has a Sun
06:07 - in it and so on this is just because I
06:09 - made the moon a child object of the Sun
06:12 - but you'll see how everything works in
06:15 - just a minute so if we first of all go
06:17 - ahead and drag this into our hierarchy
06:19 - you can see that the lighting on the
06:22 - maize starch changing and we could go
06:26 - ahead and disable the directional light
06:28 - we have completely though this would
06:30 - make everything but the lamp here
06:35 - completely dark at nighttime and I still
06:38 - want to allow
06:39 - some lighting there so I'm just going to
06:42 - go ahead and change the intensities of
06:43 - something like 0.05 maybe even less than
06:49 - that we'll just go with this for now and
06:52 - one very neat feature that unity
06:56 - announced in there in that unite keynote
07:01 - speech is that the directional light
07:06 - shadows real-time shadows will be free
07:10 - very soon so we can start having some
07:13 - real-time shadows but until then let's
07:16 - again move on with the tutorial so under
07:21 - here if we click our time of day prefab
07:23 - we can see we have the time of day
07:26 - script and this script will do many
07:29 - things for us if we just go ahead and
07:32 - hit play as is you can see that our
07:36 - skybox
07:37 - is really looking weird so right now it
07:41 - should be night but we just have these
07:45 - clouds and yeah
07:47 - this is not what we want so what you
07:49 - want to do is you want to select our
07:51 - play then go down to a main camera and
07:54 - delete the skybox component because
07:56 - everything will be handed through our
07:59 - time of day script and so we could also
08:02 - go ahead and boost the lighting of this
08:04 - make it a little more realistic sky kind
08:07 - of color so I would go with something
08:09 - like that
08:10 - and now when we help play you can see
08:13 - that this looks a lot lot smoother and
08:17 - it fits the time of day better so again
08:21 - select the time of day prefab and if we
08:25 - hit play you can see that the slider
08:28 - here slowly goes up and will eventually
08:32 - reach one and then it will start living
08:36 - this slide it too will follow it upwards
08:40 - and then at a certain point which is 0.5
08:43 - it will start to decrease again the hour
08:47 - is what is the hour of the day so this
08:50 - will go up to 25 at 4:00
08:53 - and then it will loop back back to zero
08:56 - we have the Sun which is just the
08:59 - directional light that actually emits
09:02 - the light down on the scene this is just
09:05 - a light game object then we have the
09:08 - speed so if we change this to like ten
09:11 - you can see everything changing really
09:14 - fast or if we change it to something
09:17 - more realistic like I don't know 2000
09:21 - you can see it going really slowly so I
09:25 - recommend that you choose a number when
09:28 - we are done testing out at about I don't
09:31 - know 600 would be good because then it
09:36 - won't change all the time but again you
09:38 - won't get stuck in just the dark fall
09:42 - and you don't you don't know what to do
09:45 - because it's dark and you're scared and
09:47 - very kidding but yeah 600 is pretty much
09:52 - a good amount all right and below the
09:56 - speed we have all kinds of different
09:59 - color settings and I think they're
10:01 - pretty self-explanatory the farc
10:04 - is like the mist the morning
10:08 - so we have different kind of four colors
10:11 - we have the night to ask morning midday
10:13 - then we have the ambient light and all
10:16 - of these are just tint properties so
10:18 - these will just determine the the color
10:22 - of it and the feeling then we have the
10:25 - ambient light which is the light that is
10:28 - going to be spread all over the scene
10:30 - and instead of having this directional
10:33 - light as at just a low intensity we
10:35 - could go ahead and disable that and you
10:37 - then just boost denied ambient light
10:40 - though I think having a directional
10:43 - light it improves the experience and so
10:47 - we have the night tins with dusk tins
10:50 - and so on then we have the two skybox
10:54 - materials on which we have in there and
10:57 - then we have this Sun night and the Sun
11:00 - day just the whole feeling of these two
11:04 - so all of these probabilities will be
11:08 - set at a pretty good property already
11:12 - when you just import it maybe except for
11:15 - the speed that is something you'll have
11:17 - to play around with you're on you're
11:19 - under our time of day prefab we have the
11:23 - Sun and if we just go into our scene
11:27 - view and hit F actually there we have it
11:33 - so that's our Sun so if we go ahead and
11:36 - boost the speed a bit to something like
11:41 - 50 we should be able to see it start
11:46 - rotating let's see if we can get it to
11:52 - rotate for some reason it's not updating
11:59 - maybe yeah there we go so you can see
12:02 - the actual rotating off the object and
12:05 - if we zoom out even more you can see
12:08 - that the moon goes around as well so
12:11 - there we have the moon so that's how it
12:15 - works and remember when it's pointing
12:18 - this way the light is emitting from up
12:21 - here so that that's it so this will
12:25 - always be projecting light right at the
12:28 - moon okay cool and by parenting this
12:31 - moon to the directional light we'll just
12:35 - make sure that it's always in sync with
12:37 - the Sun which is made by the skyboxes
12:41 - and the flare and the moon itself it's
12:46 - not that exciting so if I just start
12:49 - that and zoom in on the moon it's just a
12:51 - small sphere with a mesh renderer where
12:55 - I have made a material that is set to
12:58 - self-illuminated diffuse and a basic
13:01 - texture to wrap around it so that's how
13:05 - everything is pieced together now let's
13:07 - take a look at the time of day script so
13:12 - double-click it to open it up in
13:14 - monodevelop
13:17 - and inside of here we have a lot of
13:23 - variables but we have already went over
13:26 - the these everything is handled in the
13:30 - function on GUI because we are basing
13:33 - this on a slider the one in the left
13:36 - hand corner I've added a couple of
13:39 - things to make this work better and one
13:43 - of them is that if the slider is less
13:45 - than or equal than or equal to one set
13:50 - it to zero and so this will just repeat
13:52 - so every property like time of day our
13:56 - slider two and so on is based off this
13:59 - slider value and and therefore you can
14:03 - control everything with just that slider
14:06 - so let's just quickly go with the most
14:09 - important parts of this code so we have
14:12 - the GUI slider here and you can go ahead
14:16 - and resize into it whatever you want
14:18 - with that then we have the hour and time
14:20 - of day which are set using this slider
14:23 - and the slider to then we have the Sun
14:27 - that rotates then we have some then we
14:33 - have the movement on this of the slider
14:36 - using the speed variable and making sure
14:39 - that it doesn't change depending on the
14:41 - frame rate then we have the color
14:44 - looping so that the Sun will change its
14:48 - colors then we have then we set some
14:54 - more values for the slightly two then we
14:56 - have the Sun intensity that will change
14:58 - depending on the slider too and all of
15:02 - these variables these numbers here you
15:04 - can go in and just change them and play
15:07 - around with them so if you think that
15:08 - the Sun is too bright at as although
15:13 - just a daytime you can go under and find
15:16 - the Sun intensity and then maybe say
15:19 - let's time it with 1.4 or 3 instead so
15:25 - that it won't be just as powerful
15:27 - then we have the if time of day is less
15:32 - than four then it is night so the time
15:35 - of day is used to determine what what
15:40 - time is it it is inside of the code here
15:42 - and so if it's night we can have we have
15:47 - the skybox being the skybox material one
15:50 - and we set these guy bugs to float blend
15:54 - and then the so they will fade together
15:57 - we tended adjust the ambient light
16:00 - adjust the fog color and so on and we do
16:06 - this depending on these different if
16:08 - statements so a cool thing that you
16:13 - could do with this is you could go in
16:15 - and make a GUI element called our GUI
16:20 - for example and just have it sit in a
16:24 - corner and display what our it is so
16:27 - that the player knows just what time of
16:31 - data is you could also just have him
16:34 - orient using the position of the moon
16:37 - and or the Sun so if you want to go
16:41 - ahead and adjust the different tint
16:43 - value so the different tinting of off
16:48 - stuff like ambient light I suggest you
16:51 - go ahead and change the speed to
16:53 - something like 100 here and then you
16:56 - wait for the time of day actually it
16:58 - might be an even better idea to just set
17:00 - it really high so it almost wasn't won't
17:05 - change and you can set the time you want
17:09 - to adjust using the slider so I'm going
17:10 - to set it to night and now I can just go
17:15 - ahead and adjust and see how it changes
17:19 - so it could take for example the night
17:21 - ambient and play around with that and
17:24 - when I have something I think works
17:27 - remember that when you're in play mode
17:29 - and then and then cancel out all of
17:34 - these change changes will go back to
17:37 - normal so you might want at egg and
17:40 - right
17:40 - down the slide a values here so the our
17:43 - RGB that is pretty much it for today's
17:47 - video guys I hope you enjoyed it and
17:49 - I'll see you in the next one
