00:00 - so we recently held the third official
00:01 - practice game jam an event where you get
00:03 - one week to make a game from scratch and
00:06 - we were so overwhelmed with how many
00:07 - people participated in the jam over
00:10 - 2,800 people joined and we got more than
00:12 - 700 submissions which is over twice as
00:15 - many as the second jam and almost five
00:17 - times the first Jam it's always super
00:19 - fun to see what you guys can make in
00:20 - such a short amount of time and this Jam
00:22 - was actually kind of special because
00:24 - it's the first time that we've allowed
00:25 - people to use pre-made assets and I'm
00:28 - extremely impressed with how well
00:29 - everyone was able to utilize this in a
00:32 - unique and creative way so before we get
00:34 - into it a huge thanks to everyone who
00:36 - participated in the jam and helped make
00:38 - it a success over the past few weeks
00:40 - we've been playing a bunch of the games
00:41 - and while all of them are cool in their
00:43 - own way we've chosen a few we'd like to
00:45 - show in this video so without further
00:47 - ado let's have a look at some awesome
00:48 - games from the breakfast game Jam
00:50 - but first this video is sponsored by V
00:52 - game the game is a music and sound
00:54 - effects library especially made for game
00:56 - developers the goal is to help minimize
00:58 - the time it takes to find exactly the
01:00 - right sound for your game what makes me
01:01 - game different from a normal music
01:03 - library is that it lets you search by
01:05 - video game categories and then download
01:07 - specific parts of the soundtrack like
01:09 - drum and bass stingers bumpers and stems
01:11 - to vary the soundtrack so that it fits
01:13 - these specific parts of your game
01:15 - besides this they even allow you to
01:17 - search based on music key level of
01:19 - intensity mood and much more the game
01:22 - offers a wide selection of tracks from
01:23 - composers and sound designers around the
01:25 - world starting at only $3 - more
01:27 - high-end tracks made by Grammy and gang
01:29 - Award winners who've created music for
01:31 - games like god of war so if you're
01:33 - looking for music or sounds for a game
01:35 - you're working on I definitely recommend
01:36 - to check out V game will of course have
01:38 - a link to their site in the description
01:39 - along with a guide on how to most
01:41 - efficiently start using V game so the
01:43 - theme for the jam was holes and holy
01:46 - moly did we get a lot of cool different
01:49 - takes on that theme some of you took it
01:51 - very literally
01:52 - for example in feed a hole where you
01:54 - literally play as a whole and in this
01:57 - pit trying to swallow as much as it can
01:59 - I was surprised how engage the gut in
02:01 - this simple gameplay for some reason I
02:03 - just found it so satisfying to watch
02:04 - stuff fall into the pit especially the
02:07 - small red cubes at the start other games
02:09 - had a more abstract interpretation of
02:11 - the theme in
02:13 - the whole truth for example you're a
02:14 - detective trying to figure out what
02:16 - happened at a crime scene and in which
02:18 - order in other words the case has holes
02:20 - and you're trying to fill them you walk
02:22 - around the scene and gather clues that
02:24 - you can put together to create events
02:25 - these events have to be put in the right
02:27 - order to solve the case
02:29 - the game itself is very intuitive and
02:30 - the UI felt great to navigate and the
02:32 - fact that you can move the clothes
02:34 - around as you see fit is a very nice
02:36 - touch and it makes it way easier to
02:37 - organize in a way that makes sense to
02:39 - you next up we have manhole man in this
02:42 - first person manhole shooter your job is
02:44 - to cover up the open sewers with walled
02:47 - manholes to keep the aliens from rising
02:49 - into the world from the underworld let
02:52 - me be honest this game was weird but in
02:55 - a good way and oddly amusing somehow
02:57 - especially the newspaper menu was very
02:59 - well thought out and a nice addition to
03:01 - the game in order to win however you had
03:03 - to fight the alien boss on the highest
03:05 - building by surfing to the top and let's
03:07 - just say that my surfing skills are
03:09 - quite rusty so I never made it
03:11 - apparently thousands of hours in sea a
03:13 - source wasn't enough and now that we are
03:15 - in the subject of aliens in whole me not
03:18 - you play as planet Earth your main
03:21 - objective to escape an evil alien race
03:23 - that's trying to poke holes in you
03:25 - however with every hole you get a weapon
03:27 - appears making it easier to kill aliens
03:30 - but of course more risky because you
03:31 - have fewer lives the goal is to get an
03:33 - upgrade three weapons which means that
03:36 - you intentionally have to lose lives in
03:38 - order to win this makes for a really
03:40 - interesting mechanic where you
03:41 - constantly have to decide between
03:42 - staying safe and adding more firepower
03:45 - on top of that all sprites are hand
03:47 - drawn on paper which gives the game a
03:49 - very unique art style and on the topic
03:51 - of poking holes and stuff
03:52 - fluffy flight is a physics-based puzzle
03:55 - game where you have to transport an egg
03:57 - to safety and you could say that this
03:58 - game is pretty extraordinary
04:01 - of course the egg is strapped to a
04:04 - balloon that you can control instead you
04:06 - have to poke holes in the side of the
04:08 - balloon so that the air pressure will
04:09 - push it in the opposite direction
04:11 - however the balloon only contains a
04:13 - limited amount of air and if you lose
04:16 - too much it pops
04:18 - but luckily you have three bandages so
04:20 - that the holes can be patched back up I
04:22 - must say that this mechanic really blew
04:24 - me away get it because the arias book
04:27 - anyway you can also refill your air by
04:30 - flying into air bubbles oh and I forgot
04:32 - to mention that there are spikes
04:33 - everywhere just waiting to poke some
04:35 - holes in our fragile balloon making some
04:37 - of the levels quite difficult
04:39 - fluffy flight is a nice take on the
04:41 - theme it has great gameplay level design
04:43 - audio and all this together it just
04:45 - makes the game pop okay I promise this
04:49 - was the last one I don't want to
04:50 - exaggerate now one of the most stunning
04:57 - games of this gem is obliterator in fact
05:00 - we will completely blown away by the
05:02 - amazing graphics shader effects and
05:04 - overall atmosphere I mean just look at
05:07 - this however obliterator is just as
05:10 - beautiful as it is frustratingly hard
05:13 - it starts off all peaceful you just
05:16 - cruise around in your spaceship soaking
05:18 - in the view and suddenly buzz music
05:20 - starts playing and black holes start
05:22 - flying to what you to avoid them hitting
05:24 - you you have to stun the black holes
05:26 - with asteroids by using your gravity gun
05:29 - however it's not as easy as it sounds
05:32 - controlling the spaceship gets
05:33 - exponentially harder the slower your
05:35 - flying if you're going backwards it's
05:37 - just impossible for me at least but
05:40 - despite my lack of skills I played this
05:42 - game for way too long
05:43 - however I think it's good to remember
05:45 - that you don't need high fidelity 3d
05:47 - graphics to make a good looking game a
05:49 - good example of this is hole punch this
05:52 - is a game that despite its simple
05:54 - graphics still manages to look good and
05:56 - on top of that it's just crazy fun in
05:59 - hole punch you're a very strong guy that
06:01 - can slice up any part of the level with
06:03 - a single punch the goal is simple get
06:05 - from start to finish while collecting
06:07 - keys or coins along the way how you get
06:10 - to the finish line though is completely
06:11 - up to you you can play cautiously
06:13 - considering every slice but as I did for
06:16 - the last few levels furiously clicking
06:18 - to destroy absolutely everything as fast
06:20 - as possible the game is very polished
06:22 - and has quite a lot of levels the
06:24 - controls feel good both working and
06:26 - punching and the soundtrack had me
06:27 - completely invested the entire time
06:32 - it's good right now next up we have
06:35 - entered the diction which is a 2d puzzle
06:38 - game the goal is to dig through the
06:40 - level to get to the exit without getting
06:41 - shot by arrows it sounds simple but
06:44 - these few mechanics can create some
06:45 - pretty challenging levels and I overall
06:47 - really enjoyed it and staying on the
06:49 - topic of mining in piti piti
06:51 - you also play as a miner who's trying to
06:53 - take his way down a pit to gather
06:55 - precious metals while having to avoid
06:57 - the gloomy enemies who try to stop you
06:59 - along the way one of the really cool
07:01 - things about this game is how the menu
07:02 - is set up at the top of the game when
07:04 - learning the controls you have the
07:06 - opportunity of controlling game
07:07 - variables by digging your way to the
07:09 - different option buttons very cool way
07:11 - to merge gameplay with an options menu
07:13 - and combine this with a well-executed
07:15 - NES pixel art style and P deep it
07:17 - definitely stands out now many of the
07:21 - games were weird or had some weird
07:23 - mechanics but portholes hid a whole new
07:27 - level I'll just let it speak for itself
07:29 - I can't believe how many times I've
07:31 - watched this crap it's so confusing and
07:34 - weird and the music is just I love it
07:39 - thank you for submitting this
07:40 - masterpiece now in wormholes you only
07:43 - have two actions placing into and exit
07:45 - portals with the left and right mouse
07:47 - buttons the game instantly reminded me
07:49 - of a top-down portal so of course I
07:52 - liked it a lot
07:53 - plus it was just fun watching the little
07:55 - men fly across the screen regardless if
07:57 - they hit the right spot or not and
07:58 - another game about portals is room below
08:01 - a puzzle game where you have to guide
08:03 - robots safely through the levels by
08:05 - using portals room below has a decent
08:07 - amount of stages along with different
08:09 - portals and obstacles and it is
08:11 - surprisingly good at introducing the new
08:13 - mechanics so that I never felt lost or
08:15 - confused oh and it's a nice touch with
08:17 - the collective of breakfast game jam
08:19 - jars and staying in the puzzle game
08:21 - genre we have a whole lot of colors this
08:26 - is a really solid puzzle game that gets
08:28 - quite challenging pretty fast I really
08:30 - like the setting and the backgrounds
08:31 - serving as an in-game tutorial was a
08:33 - very nice touch
08:35 - however I must admit that it took me
08:36 - embarrassingly long to realize that you
08:38 - could combine colors oh and that thump
08:41 - sound when you go through a gate
08:43 - that is satisfying next up we played
08:46 - realm of holes in this game you're
08:48 - caught in the realm of holes and in
08:50 - order to escape you need to gather all
08:51 - the cosmic holes in the realm a very
08:53 - unique gameplay element in this game is
08:55 - the fact that it has warp holes
08:57 - scattered all around the realm just like
08:59 - normal portals you can enter one and
09:01 - come out of another
09:03 - however some holes will warp parts of
09:05 - the realm itself in practice this means
09:07 - that the entire level rotates so that
09:10 - you get to explore the environment in a
09:12 - new way and discover new areas
09:14 - throughout the game you slowly learn
09:15 - where the different warp holes lead you
09:17 - how they alter the realm and how you can
09:19 - use this to your advantage
09:20 - the game is also filled with secret
09:22 - passages that often feature hidden
09:24 - riddles that will help you get through
09:26 - certain stages of the game later on and
09:28 - that's pretty much all the games we had
09:31 - time to cover in this video of course
09:33 - there are so many amazing games that we
09:35 - haven't talked about so I definitely
09:36 - encourage you to go play them yourself
