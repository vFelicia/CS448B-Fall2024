00:00 - serious what's new engine ad 5.6 the
00:02 - beta start already and the full version
00:03 - will be released to 31st this month a
00:05 - lot of exciting stuff so let's get into
00:07 - it so the first improvements are three
00:08 - features that will definitely speed up
00:10 - the lighting workflow the light Explorer
00:11 - is a brand new window that gives an
00:13 - overview of all the lights in the scene
00:14 - you know how light can either be baked
00:16 - into a light map or updated in real time
00:18 - well now you know this reintroducing mix
00:20 - mode and mix between faked and real-time
00:22 - lighting for static objects the light is
00:24 - baked into the light map but dynamic
00:25 - objects to cast real-time shadows
00:27 - progressive light mapper energy now
00:29 - quickly breaks a low resolution light
00:31 - map for the part of the scene you're
00:32 - looking at this allows you to see
00:33 - changes almost immediately and then the
00:35 - light map increases in quality until
00:37 - it's fully baked this feature is not
00:38 - part of the beta but will be out with
00:40 - the full release flex 5 pence extra set
00:42 - out to improve AI pathfinding with a
00:43 - rework navmesh system from now on you
00:45 - can have multiple math measures in the
00:47 - scene and orient them in any given
00:49 - direction in addition the path can now
00:50 - be updated in real time which is great
00:52 - for dynamic terrain or procedurally
00:54 - generated levels of course 5.6 also
00:56 - comes with a bunch of graphical
00:57 - improvements such as GPU instancing and
00:59 - metal compute shaders along with a
01:01 - performance increase for the particle
01:02 - system oh and unity finally got support
01:04 - from Vulcan looking at the graphics API
01:06 - that is really efficient at taking
01:07 - advantage of multiple CPU cores which
01:10 - means that it can free up processing
01:11 - power on some platforms Vulcans will run
01:13 - on Android Windows Linux and Titan the
01:15 - video player has been rebuilt from
01:17 - scratch to play 4k videos which is great
01:19 - for 360 VR a debug view for physics
01:21 - geometry has been added features that
01:23 - improve 2-d game making include access
01:25 - distance sort which helps solves the
01:27 - access sorting problems by enabling you
01:29 - to set the transparency sort mode to a
01:31 - custom access you can use the sort
01:32 - include component to render a set of
01:34 - objects separately from others on the
01:36 - same sorting layer 2d physics
01:37 - improvements where the biggest one for
01:39 - me is probably the composite Collider 2d
01:41 - which allows you to merge different
01:42 - types of kaleidos into one in real time
01:44 - and to the duty artists rejoice we now
01:47 - have nine slice if you don't know nine
01:49 - slice is a technique for stretching or
01:50 - repeating defined areas of the sprite
01:52 - this means that we can create very small
01:54 - textures that can be easily manipulated
01:56 - and resize the graceful platform
01:58 - other than that the beta now includes
02:00 - Google daydream and cardboard VR support
02:02 - you also be able to deploy your projects
02:04 - to the new Facebook game room desktop
02:05 - app for Windows or to facebook.com using
02:08 - your movies WebGL support unity
02:09 - collaborate is unities relatively new
02:11 - cloud base
02:12 - that allows small teams to sing and
02:13 - share project it's basically just unity
02:15 - sound version control system and so far
02:17 - it's been lacking but they are now
02:19 - introducing partial publish and the
02:20 - ability to roll back changes it probably
02:22 - won't get me to leave gate just yet but
02:24 - we're getting closer finally and this is
02:26 - something that I'm super excited about
02:27 - unity is working on implementing the
02:29 - public editor extension text mesh pro
02:31 - into unity as an avid txt much pro user
02:33 - it's great to see unity accepting that
02:35 - their text editing tools are really
02:37 - support also text most Pro is now free
02:39 - on the App Store that's pretty much it
02:40 - for version 526 along with a bunch of
02:42 - smaller changes and bug fixes of course
02:44 - however unity has also teased two new
02:46 - features that will be coming sometime in
02:48 - 2017
02:49 - the first one is timeline its cinematic
02:51 - sequence it's all timeline allows you to
02:53 - easily create interactive cutscenes or
02:55 - scripted events with access to some
02:57 - really nice camera tools so far timeline
02:59 - looks really interesting and well done
03:01 - the second feature is something that has
03:02 - only been discussed pretty vaguely it's
03:04 - a fully multi-threaded job system
03:06 - enabling better use of multi-core CPUs a
03:08 - lot of unanswered questions on this one
03:10 - I'm excited to see where unity will take
03:12 - it it could definitely lead to some
03:14 - really nice performance improvements if
03:15 - you want to read more about 5.6 timeline
03:18 - or anything else i've talked about in
03:19 - this video I will have links in the
03:21 - description this video is of course a
03:22 - bit different from the usual tutorial so
03:24 - please let me know if you like it and
03:25 - want to see more thanks for watching and
03:27 - I will see you in the next video thanks
03:29 - of the awesome people who donated in
03:30 - February and a special thanks to Derek
03:32 - huge jerk face bone marrow 5 James
03:34 - Callaghan and Jason Latino if you want
03:36 - to become a picture in yourself you can
03:37 - do so a pitching becomes less Preki
03:39 - thanks a lot guys
