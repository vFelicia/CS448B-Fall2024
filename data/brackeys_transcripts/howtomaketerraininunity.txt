00:00 - one of the most fun parts about creating
00:01 - levels for a game is making your own
00:03 - terrain luckily unity has tools designed
00:05 - specifically to sculpt paint and detail
00:08 - terrain within the unity editor and
00:10 - these tools have recently been updated
00:11 - with a lot more features now we're
00:13 - making this video fairly early on in the
00:15 - development process of these features
00:17 - since we think it's a nice way for you
00:18 - guys to try out the tools and help
00:20 - improve on them in fact after we did a
00:22 - video on the new input system we talked
00:24 - to some folks at Unity and they've
00:26 - really taken a lot of the feedback from
00:27 - the comments section and are already
00:29 - implementing a lot of it into the next
00:31 - version which is just super cool so
00:33 - without further ado let's start making
00:35 - some terrain also this video is
00:37 - sponsored by unity now let's get to it
00:39 - so first of all you need to make sure
00:40 - that you're using unity 2019 point 1.5
00:43 - or later now with that we can go to
00:45 - window and open up the package manager
00:48 - here we need to make sure that we have
00:50 - all packages selected and go under
00:52 - advanced and select show preview
00:54 - packages at the time of recording this
00:56 - video the terrain system is still in
00:58 - preview and we should be able to search
01:00 - for it here and find terrain tolls as
01:03 - you can see I'm using version 1.1 point
01:05 - 4 now let's go ahead and install this
01:08 - unity is going to import the package and
01:10 - that's pretty much all the setup we need
01:12 - to do however unity has also created a
01:14 - package on the asset store with some
01:16 - sample terrain assets in fact that's
01:18 - what they're linking to right here now
01:21 - I'm not gonna click this instead I'm
01:22 - just going to go directly to the asset
01:24 - store tab remember you can always find
01:26 - this under window asset store and I'm
01:28 - simply going to search for the terrain
01:30 - sample assets the package right here as
01:33 - you can see it's free I'm simply going
01:35 - to download that and the cool thing
01:37 - about this pack is that it features more
01:39 - brushes that you can use while sculpting
01:41 - and painting as well as some cool sample
01:43 - textures that we can try out now let's
01:46 - hit import and import again and we are
01:48 - now completely set up as you can see in
01:51 - our assets here we now have a folder
01:52 - called samples with all of the terrain
01:55 - tools including brush textures terrain
01:57 - brushes layers and so on super cool so
02:01 - now it's time to create a new terrain
02:03 - and we can do this really quickly by
02:05 - simply right-clicking a hierarchy going
02:07 - 3d object and selecting terrain and
02:10 - right away this is going to spawn in a
02:12 - huge piece of terrain into our scene now
02:16 - I'm just gonna go ahead and disable the
02:17 - example assets in our sample scene here
02:19 - since we're not gonna be needing them so
02:21 - that is one way to very quickly create
02:23 - terrain however there is another way if
02:26 - we delete this piece of terrain and
02:28 - instead go to window terrain we can use
02:32 - the terrain toolbox and the terrain
02:35 - toolbox is a new window that allows us
02:36 - to easily set up terrains with specific
02:39 - settings change settings on multiple
02:41 - existing terrains at once and just
02:43 - overall smooth out the process of
02:45 - working with terrain so I'm simply going
02:47 - to take this and dark it next to the
02:49 - inspector over here as you can see we
02:51 - have some parameters here for the width
02:52 - length and height of our terrain you can
02:54 - set these to whatever you want I'm just
02:56 - gonna leave these as is and remember
02:58 - everything can be changed later so let's
03:01 - go ahead and hit create and as you can
03:03 - see right away it creates the terrain
03:04 - within our scene I'm gonna go back to
03:06 - the inspector here and let's have a look
03:08 - at what has happened here so if we go to
03:10 - a project first of all we now have a
03:11 - terrain folder and within this we have a
03:14 - terrain data object this stores all the
03:16 - information about our terrain such as
03:18 - where there are hills and slopes and
03:20 - what textures we apply you can also see
03:23 - that it's gone out and created an object
03:24 - in the hierarchy in fact it's both
03:26 - created a two-ring group and within this
03:28 - a terrain object this object has two
03:31 - components the terrain component which
03:33 - is used to configure our terrain and
03:35 - used to change our sculpting and
03:36 - painting settings as well as a two-ring
03:39 - Collider which creates a Collider so
03:41 - that physics objects will interact with
03:42 - our terrain so at this point we are
03:45 - ready to start sculpting our terrain I
03:47 - really recommend that when you're
03:48 - working with your terrain you go to the
03:50 - top of the scene here and make sure to
03:52 - disable fog so you can see everything
03:54 - clearly and that you also go to lighting
03:55 - and make sure that auto generate light
03:57 - Maps is turned off so with that let's
04:00 - get painting so the first thing that you
04:01 - want to do is go ahead and select the
04:03 - paint terrain tool here and with that
04:05 - selected we get a bunch of options first
04:08 - of all we want to make sure that we have
04:09 - raise or lower terrain selected here we
04:11 - can choose between all of the different
04:13 - brushes that we can use I'm just gonna
04:15 - choose an ordinary soft brush and if I
04:17 - just hover over my terrain now and try
04:19 - and press we can see that I can start
04:22 - sculpting to the right here you can
04:24 - change brush settings such as strength
04:26 - and
04:26 - sighs or you can do so using shortcuts
04:28 - the shortcut for strength is a so if I
04:31 - hold down a here I can adjust how much
04:33 - strength
04:33 - I want to apply with my brush in other
04:35 - words how much do I want to sculpt the
04:37 - terrain by holding down my mouse I can
04:40 - also adjust the size of my brush by
04:41 - holding down s and simply dragging here
04:44 - now I have a much larger brush and can
04:46 - make much larger changes to the terrain
04:49 - let's try out a bit more of an
04:50 - interesting brush here and if we hold
04:52 - down D we can also rotate it in any way
04:55 - that we'd like you can see just how easy
04:57 - it is to add in detail with brushes like
04:59 - these and of course all these shortcuts
05:01 - can be changed using this shortcut
05:03 - editor another cool thing is that if we
05:05 - hold down ctrl we can invert which
05:08 - allows us to lower it the terrain I'm
05:10 - gonna go ahead and reduce the size of my
05:11 - brush here and if we go ahead and change
05:13 - the spacing we can change how much
05:15 - distance we want between each individual
05:17 - brushstroke we can also use scattering
05:20 - to add random scatter to our brush which
05:22 - can lead to some pretty interesting
05:23 - effects now all of this is just by
05:26 - raising and lowering the terrain we also
05:28 - have other paint modes here such as set
05:30 - height which allows us to set the
05:32 - terrain to a certain height down here we
05:34 - can see the height that we're setting to
05:35 - let's try and change this to something
05:37 - like 90 let's do a soft brush let's
05:40 - increase the size of this brush as you
05:42 - can see we're now setting everything
05:43 - that we paint to this height really cool
05:46 - we also have another mode called smooth
05:48 - height this can also be accessed from
05:50 - other tools by simply holding shift
05:52 - because it's something that you use
05:54 - fairly frequently and it simply allows
05:56 - us to well smooth out parts of our
05:59 - terrain now this here is pretty extreme
06:01 - we can of course adjust the brush
06:02 - strength as with anything else to reduce
06:05 - the impact but it will definitely smooth
06:07 - out the terrain really cool
06:09 - another cool mode is undo sculpt and
06:11 - it's called
06:12 - noise and as the name suggests this
06:14 - simply allows us to paint noise onto our
06:17 - terrain we can go ahead and adjust
06:19 - settings for the noise down here most
06:22 - importantly we can adjust the scale of
06:24 - our noise let's translate it to
06:25 - something like 20 by 20 by 20 and as you
06:28 - can see I can now start to paint in this
06:31 - noise on top of our terrain this really
06:34 - easily allows us to add cool detail to
06:37 - our terrain especially if we go ahead
06:39 - and ink
06:39 - the strength of it you can see just how
06:41 - easy it is to create interesting results
06:44 - in fact under these modes you have a lot
06:46 - of really cool options to achieve
06:48 - certain effects so just add life to your
06:50 - terrain for example under sculpt here we
06:52 - also have the bridge mode which allows
06:54 - us to control click on a start point
06:57 - let's choose this one and then click on
06:59 - another place of our terrain to create a
07:01 - bridge across it this is super easy for
07:04 - creating world bridges or roads and can
07:07 - lead to some really interesting effects
07:09 - another cool thing is Terrace which as
07:12 - the name suggests will divide our
07:13 - terrain into terraces or layers when
07:17 - adjust the terrace count in order to
07:19 - change the appearance of this effect but
07:21 - it's definitely really handy if this is
07:22 - the look you're going for there are also
07:24 - some really cool brushes called erosion
07:26 - brushes you can see there's hydraulic
07:28 - thermal and wind I'm gonna select
07:30 - hydraulic here which erodes the terrain
07:32 - according to fluid simulation you can of
07:34 - course change some settings about that
07:36 - simulation down here but if I just go
07:38 - ahead and paint you can see how this is
07:40 - kind of smoothing and flattening out the
07:42 - terrain just like it would be if it was
07:44 - exposed to water over a longer period of
07:47 - time really cool and this is just some
07:50 - of the modes honestly there are so many
07:52 - more that I definitely recommend you
07:53 - play around with now if you're working
07:55 - on the terrain and realized some of your
07:56 - settings are off well you can always go
07:59 - to the last card tab here which is the
08:01 - terrain settings you can adjust a bunch
08:04 - of different things including our mesh
08:06 - resolution again the width length and
08:08 - height of our terrain and in fact one
08:11 - thing that I recommend is scaling your
08:13 - terrain to be larger while working on it
08:16 - in fact I've found bumping up your
08:17 - resolution on the width length and
08:19 - height to over 2000 while working on the
08:21 - terrain is really really nice and then
08:23 - you can always go ahead and decrease it
08:25 - later and it will still keep a lot of
08:27 - the detail remember if you need to
08:29 - adjust settings on multiple terrains you
08:31 - can always use the terrain toolbox to do
08:33 - that you don't have to go to each one
08:34 - individually now another cool thing
08:36 - about the terrain system is that it
08:38 - allows us to string together multiple
08:40 - terrain tasks this is cool because you
08:43 - don't always want your terrain to be
08:44 - completely square so if we go to the
08:47 - first button here we can create neighbor
08:49 - terrains and we do this simply by
08:52 - clicking and I
08:53 - you can see the really cool thing about
08:55 - this is that height data is going to
08:57 - transfer seamlessly onto the terrain in
09:00 - fact we can go ahead and create neighbor
09:02 - terrains on all sides here and if we go
09:05 - in here we can now start to paint across
09:08 - all of these different terrains so if
09:10 - you're just going and race and lower the
09:12 - terrain you can see that I can do so on
09:14 - multiple terrains at once awesome now
09:18 - for this to work you need to make sure
09:19 - that all of your terrains are sharing
09:22 - the same group ID as you can see all of
09:24 - these terrains have a grouping ID of
09:27 - zero and they also all need to have the
09:30 - same resolution just a heads up so I'm
09:33 - gonna go ahead and delete all these new
09:34 - terrains here and just try and focus on
09:37 - this thing of one so the next part of
09:39 - the process is painting and we also do
09:42 - that of course using the paintbrush but
09:44 - we need to change the mode to paint
09:47 - texture and when painting onto terrain
09:49 - we are working with what is called
09:51 - terrain layers and as you can see
09:53 - currently there are no layers here so
09:55 - let's go ahead and hit edit terrain
09:56 - layers and here we can either create a
09:58 - layer or add an existing layer let's try
10:01 - and create one this is going to open up
10:03 - a panel where we can select a texture
10:05 - I'm just gonna go it and select a symbol
10:07 - of dirt texture this is from the terrain
10:09 - samples pack I'm gonna double click on
10:11 - it and right away you can see that it's
10:13 - added this texture as a terrain layer
10:14 - you also see that we now have an object
10:17 - in a project called new layer let's go
10:19 - ahead and call this one dirt layer and
10:21 - in here we have settings such as the
10:24 - diffuse map we can also input a normal
10:26 - map so I'm gonna go ahead and input the
10:28 - dirt normal here as well as a mask map
10:30 - where I'm gonna put the third mask we're
10:33 - gonna just stuff like metallic Ness and
10:35 - smoothness in here and you can see it
10:37 - applies to our entire terrain and of
10:39 - course also texture tiling and if we
10:41 - zoom in we can see that the texture is
10:44 - actually here it's just being tiled a
10:46 - whole bunch so we can go ahead and of
10:48 - course adjust the tile size here to kind
10:51 - of change that around but of course
10:54 - right now we only have a single layer
10:56 - let's go ahead and add some more so I'm
10:58 - gonna hit add layer here and I'm gonna
11:00 - select some of the ones that are already
11:01 - in this sample assets I'm gonna select
11:03 - rock I'm also going to add a sand
11:06 - lair Squealer let's add some snow and
11:10 - some moss and at this point we're ready
11:12 - to just start painting so I'm gonna
11:15 - increase the size of my brush here you
11:17 - can play around with the opacity and I'm
11:19 - gonna start adding rock to my mountains
11:22 - I'm also going to add some moss in here
11:24 - just kind of scatter it around again
11:27 - guys this is not gonna be pretty just
11:29 - showing off the tools I'm gonna add a
11:31 - tiny bit of screen here let's add some
11:34 - sand along the sides don't ask me why
11:36 - this end on the top and finally we're
11:38 - gonna paint in some snow just a tiny bit
11:41 - at the top of these slopes here in fact
11:43 - I'm gonna go ahead and use a different
11:44 - brush so that we can kind of scatter
11:46 - this around again not going for any
11:48 - awards here and there you go it's that
11:50 - easy to start sculpting and painting it
11:53 - terrain with these tools as you also
11:55 - mentioned that the unity environment
11:56 - team is working on a brush pack for
11:58 - texturing that is scheduled for 2019
12:00 - point two so we'll have more cool
12:02 - brushes and I know I haven't touched on
12:04 - these two icons here they are for
12:07 - painting trees and foliage onto your
12:09 - terrain now this is for another video
12:11 - just know that the option is here and
12:13 - that it works very similar to painting
12:14 - textures and finally I just want to show
12:17 - you one of my favorite features which is
12:19 - the ability to create a terrain from a
12:21 - height map now if you don't know what a
12:23 - height map is I have an example of it
12:26 - right here as you can see it's a
12:27 - black-and-white image that stores height
12:29 - information white parts are high black
12:33 - parts are low and there are a lot of
12:36 - free height maps online I would
12:38 - definitely recommend just doing a quick
12:39 - search for height map and just by going
12:41 - to images you can see just how many are
12:43 - readily available here now the format of
12:46 - your heart map needs to be dot raw you
12:48 - can use a photo editing software like
12:50 - Photoshop or to export this raw in
12:52 - case you find a JPEG or PNG or any other
12:55 - format in Photoshop it's as easy as
12:57 - going file save as and selecting
13:00 - Photoshop wrong in fact I've gone it and
13:02 - prepared a height map draw right here
13:04 - let's simply drag this into unity to
13:07 - import it we then go to the terrain
13:09 - toolbox let's create a new terrain but
13:11 - let's do so by importing a height map so
13:14 - I'm gonna check this checkbox right here
13:16 - I'm gonna select a height map file
13:17 - simply clicking this I'm gonna browse to
13:20 - the height
13:20 - unless you can see we can change the
13:22 - height resolution this doesn't have to
13:24 - be the same as the height map you can
13:25 - make it a greater resolution if you want
13:27 - I'm just gonna keep it at 512 we can
13:29 - then remap our height map in any way
13:31 - that we'd like I'm just gonna make it
13:33 - less tall here so I'm going to decrease
13:34 - the max we also need to make sure that
13:36 - we aren't creating this in the same
13:38 - grouping ID as our previous terrain so
13:40 - I'm gonna set this to 1 and let's now
13:42 - try and hit create and as you can see
13:44 - it's going to spawn this right on top
13:46 - but we've now created a terrain based on
13:49 - that height map and I think it looks
13:51 - really really cool and hard maps are
13:54 - just really great to use they are really
13:56 - easy to get inspired by and just gives
13:58 - you a really solid base to work off of
14:00 - finally what you've created the terrain
14:02 - that you'd like simply go back into
14:04 - lighting and re-enable Auto generate and
14:06 - it's then going to generate a light map
14:08 - for your terrain awesome that's pretty
14:10 - much it for this video if you liked it
