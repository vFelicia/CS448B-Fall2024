00:00 - serious what's new in unity mm 17.3 as
00:03 - of recording this video it's still in
00:04 - public beta but I expected to be out
00:06 - sometime in December all right let's see
00:08 - what it has to offer
00:09 - the first feature worth mentioning is
00:11 - the panoramic 2d and 3d video this
00:13 - allows for playback a full 360-degree
00:15 - video onto the scene skybox especially
00:18 - cool fall of the VR enthusiasts in 2017
00:21 - point 3 unit is also introducing a new
00:23 - transform tool the new tool combines the
00:25 - functionality of the standard transform
00:27 - controls this means that you can easily
00:29 - move rotate and scale game objects using
00:31 - the same tool personally I've been using
00:33 - the keyboard shortcuts for quite a while
00:35 - now but I think the new tool could be
00:37 - really nice for beginners with the new
00:39 - version we also seeing the introduction
00:41 - of assembly definition files this might
00:43 - sound really scaring but it's actually a
00:45 - really cool feature for anyone working
00:47 - on a larger game project you see
00:49 - normally unity automatically defines how
00:51 - scripts compiled to manage the
00:53 - assemblies this means that code in your
00:54 - scripts gets outputted to files defined
00:56 - by unity typically as you add more
00:58 - scripts it will take longer for the
01:01 - editor to compile these files this can
01:03 - lead to annoying wait times as your
01:04 - project gets bigger now however you can
01:06 - define your own managed assemblies this
01:09 - means that you can choose which scripts
01:10 - compile to what file this way only the
01:12 - required assemblies are rebuild when
01:15 - making changes to a script and this can
01:17 - greatly reduce the amount of time you
01:18 - need to wait for combination as always
01:20 - with the view update comes some nice
01:22 - improvements to the particle system the
01:24 - velocity over lifetime module now
01:25 - contains a new setting which modifies
01:27 - the speed of the particles over time
01:29 - this makes it much easier to control
01:31 - particle speeds without affecting their
01:33 - direction on top of that you can now
01:35 - also create ribbon eyes particle trails
01:37 - using the particle system this allows
01:39 - particles to be connected based on their
01:41 - age instead of each particle leaving a
01:43 - trail behind it this is cool because we
01:45 - can now add effects between the
01:47 - different particles but the biggest
01:48 - change to the particle system is
01:50 - probably the brand new standard particle
01:52 - shaders unity is releasing two standard
01:54 - shaders for use with particles surface
01:56 - and unlit these shaders provide all the
01:58 - core particle functionality that you
02:00 - would expect but using an interface
02:02 - similar to the existing standard shader
02:04 - this makes it easy to configure stuff
02:06 - like blend modes alpha thresholds soft
02:08 - particle settings and so on and finally
02:10 - we're seeing some nice changes to the
02:12 - particle editor
02:13 - this includes the ability to preview
02:14 - other looping effects instead of just
02:16 - the selected one the profiler is also
02:18 - getting an update most of its internal
02:20 - but the changes should make the system
02:21 - more scalable and performant and a side
02:23 - effect of the changes include the added
02:25 - ability to profile custom threads using
02:27 - a c-sharp API the cloth component has
02:30 - also been improved
02:31 - we finally have cloth soft collision you
02:33 - can now paint constraints onto the cloth
02:35 - using a brush based method and with the
02:38 - new update you can also enable inter
02:39 - collision to have different cloth
02:41 - effects collide with each other I really
02:43 - can't explain to you how happy I am that
02:44 - someone did that for me they're really
02:46 - way too many changes to cover in this
02:48 - video here's a list of some of them
02:50 - finally mm 17.3 of course comes with a
02:53 - number of smaller changes and bug fixes
02:56 - you can download the beta today using
02:57 - the link in the description and if you
