00:03 - hello everyone and welcome to the 24th
00:06 - video in our Survival game series done
00:08 - by Braes I am the CEO of Braes and in
00:11 - this video we're going to take a look at
00:13 - expanding on our time of day script to
00:16 - allow us to change the color of the
00:18 - water so it can fit in with the time of
00:21 - day so uh when it's night we're going to
00:24 - have like a dark water not that
00:27 - saturated and when it's bright uh or
00:30 - daytime we're going to have bright and
00:33 - uh colorful
00:34 - water so uh if we open up Unity you can
00:39 - see that a lot of things has changed
00:41 - here wow um I am currently working on a
00:46 - video where I do some time lapsing and
00:49 - then slow down uh certain parts of the
00:52 - video to show you what I've done here
00:54 - but basically I've just made a new
00:57 - terrain and uh don't worry every thing
01:00 - will be shown in the video it's going to
01:01 - be called uh Survival game level design
01:05 - uh 01 I think um so but I have sculpted
01:10 - and painted a new terrain uh I've added
01:13 - some water uh from the standard assets
01:17 - pack I've also made a path and I've
01:21 - included some of the uh different
01:24 - objects uh that we uh imported in the
01:27 - last tutorial so I've put some of them
01:30 - together and Chang them up a bit and
01:32 - I've also added some particles and some
01:34 - lights and some colliders here and there
01:37 - and so uh everything I've done here will
01:41 - again be explained in a future video so
01:45 - that's going to be really really awesome
01:48 - but for now let's just take a look at
01:50 - how it it looks so hit
01:54 - play and we can see it looks much better
01:57 - now we have much more detail we actually
02:00 - uh are starting to see a level uh
02:04 - shape uh type deal going on here uh so
02:07 - if we walk down to the water and and
02:09 - this is of course not the finished
02:11 - result uh the the level design video is
02:15 - probably going to be a whole series uh
02:17 - showing how I'm uh what I'm doing to
02:21 - expand on the level so if we walk down
02:23 - to the water uh right now it's it isn't
02:26 - looking too bad keep in mind that this
02:28 - is done with the free version of unity
02:31 - and so the water will never get to look
02:34 - really really awesome but uh we can make
02:37 - it look more awesome than this because
02:39 - if we change the slider to nighttime and
02:41 - look at the water it's almost like it's
02:44 - glowing and that's not really something
02:47 - we want and if we change it to like
02:51 - midday we can see that the water is then
02:54 - too dark so uh I just had to go uh with
02:57 - a property in between there so now let's
03:00 - actually modify our time of day script
03:03 - to allow us to change the color of the
03:07 - water so now let's go ahead and double
03:09 - click on our time of day
03:11 - script and so now let's go ahead and
03:13 - change this so um let me just bring my
03:17 - copy of this up on the other screen so I
03:19 - can see what we're doing okay
03:22 - so uh at the botton of the variable
03:25 - declaration here I want to create
03:27 - several new variables but first of I
03:30 - just want to type out some quick
03:31 - comments saying that this was added in
03:36 - tutorial
03:39 - number
03:42 - 24 it
03:46 - allows uh for
03:48 - changing the
03:50 - color that
03:52 - reflects
03:54 - of a water
03:58 - object and and just one more comment
04:01 - saying that
04:03 - uncheck include
04:06 - water if you are not
04:10 - interested in using this so basically
04:15 - what we're going to do now is we're
04:16 - going to create a variable that will
04:18 - store uh our water game object we are
04:21 - going to create a variable that will
04:23 - allow the user to decide or or rather
04:26 - you guys uh to decide whether not you
04:30 - want to actually use this feature so you
04:32 - can enable and disable it and uh then
04:35 - we're going to create two variables one
04:37 - that would will Define the W night color
04:40 - and one that will Define the W day so
04:43 - now let's go ahead and just do that so
04:45 - VAR v
04:48 - v uh game
04:52 - objects and so myON another one
04:56 - called uh include
04:58 - water
05:02 - it's going to be equal to false by
05:05 - default so you have to enable this
05:06 - feature as we will get a null reference
05:09 - if we haven't uh assigned anything to
05:11 - the game object and so it will just give
05:14 - us a bunch of Errors so uh the user or
05:17 - you guys have to decide whether not you
05:20 - want to use this before you assign
05:22 - stuff uh then we're going to have one
05:24 - called water KN which is going to be a
05:27 - type color and then a order day which is
05:31 - also going to be a type
05:34 - color so now save this out and now we
05:37 - should be able to go back into unity and
05:41 - see some variables appearing at the
05:43 - button here so we have the Warrior game
05:45 - object we have a checkbox if we want to
05:47 - include the water and we have then two
05:50 - color properties which you can just
05:52 - click and set or use the uh Color Picker
05:56 - here to choose anything from the
05:58 - scene
06:00 - so uh let's actually go ahead and set
06:03 - this up so let's drag in the start area
06:07 - water here so that's just the warrior
06:09 - object and of course you can make
06:12 - multiple of these variables and just
06:13 - assign it to all of them if you have if
06:15 - you have more than one uh uh water place
06:19 - or C or whatever uh so time of day and
06:24 - then drag in the start area water to the
06:27 - water variable hit the include water
06:30 - and uh now let's change the water night
06:33 - night to completely black and the water
06:36 - day to something
06:38 - like a bright blue I would say so
06:41 - something like
06:42 - that and again you can just go ahead and
06:45 - change uh change it to whatever you want
06:47 - uh that's completely up to
06:49 - you now let's go down to where uh
06:54 - actually let's go
06:57 - down to right under the sun. color
07:01 - equals color. lope and make some space
07:05 - and let's
07:07 - type uh let's actually com uh copy these
07:10 - comments down also so just so we're
07:14 - completely clear that people are
07:16 - understanding this and so
07:19 - if uh include
07:24 - water is equal to
07:28 - true
07:30 - then we want to do something
07:32 - here
07:35 - oops get a hold of the bracket keys
07:38 - there we go and what we want to happen
07:41 - is we want to take our
07:43 - water do
07:45 - renderer so the one that stores stuff
07:47 - like materials shaders and so on do
07:51 - material we want to access the material
07:54 - and we want to set a color for it so set
07:58 - color
08:00 - and then open up a parentheses and this
08:03 - is where we're going to access a Shader
08:06 - property and we have never talked about
08:09 - uh shaders and and scripting custom
08:11 - shaders and so on before but basically
08:14 - what a Shader property is is um it's a
08:20 - uh it's a variable for the Shader
08:23 - basically so it uh just like we can have
08:27 - um a checkbox and color stuff going on
08:31 - here we can have a property in a Shader
08:35 - called for example color or um blend
08:40 - amount
08:41 - reflectivity amount uh transparency and
08:45 - so on so uh we are simply going to type
08:47 - start
08:49 - parentheses and then
08:51 - underscore
08:53 - Horizon
08:56 - color comma and now we want want to set
08:59 - it so this is what it's called for the
09:02 - Shader that basic water uses and uh we
09:05 - can go ahead and find this inside of
09:07 - unit so we can go under our assets our
09:10 - day night no on our standard assets and
09:14 - this is where I have imported the uh
09:16 - water by press right clicking hitting
09:19 - import package and then water basic and
09:23 - if we import the water Pro we can see if
09:26 - this uses the same kind of Shader so if
09:29 - we just hit import on
09:34 - that and wait for it to import
09:38 - correctly should see it being done in a
09:41 - sec um so I really recommend that if
09:44 - this is not working for you you go ahead
09:46 - and check whether or not the property is
09:49 - called the same so if we go under the
09:50 - water basic select the day uh daylight
09:53 - symbol water we can see that it is using
09:56 - the water symbol shape
10:00 - and so under sources and under shaders
10:02 - we can see here the effects were symbol
10:06 - and there's a uh a category here called
10:10 - properties and the first one is indeed
10:12 - called Horizon color and we can see that
10:16 - it's a type color so if we go back uh we
10:21 - can see that the nighttime uh symbol
10:24 - water uses the same one and we can also
10:27 - see that if we go under our Pro
10:30 - and hit the daylight water it uses the
10:33 - effects water so if we go under sources
10:36 - here under shaders hit the effects water
10:41 - it is here called the let's see Horizon
10:45 - color there so that's also called
10:48 - Horizon color and uh we also have the
10:52 - water for and so on so you can go ahead
10:55 - and find it by doing this so go under do
10:57 - the different kinds of water here and
11:01 - changing that
11:02 - up so here I don't know if it's called
11:06 - Horizon but uh you can I'm sure you can
11:09 - find it on your
11:12 - own so let's delete out the water
11:16 - Pro go back to the water
11:20 - basic go under our time of day and now
11:23 - let's just uh finish the script up so
11:26 - Horizon
11:28 - color comma color.
11:34 - Lop parentheses water night comma water
11:42 - day comma slider 2 *
11:48 - 2 -
11:51 - 0.2 end up the parentheses and end with
11:54 - the
11:55 - semicolon so I won't go into too much
11:58 - detail here here but basically this line
12:01 - allows the color to lurp or fade between
12:05 - the water night and the water Day based
12:07 - on our slider
12:09 - values so now if we go in back into
12:13 - Unity hit the play
12:17 - button I can see we have an error so
12:20 - let's check that
12:21 - out vo base editor this is something to
12:25 - do with the word Pro which we en we
12:29 - import it so let's just go ahead and
12:30 - delete the editor version there too so
12:35 - go under the editor hit delete that so
12:40 - now that that's done we should be able
12:42 - to play the
12:44 - game indeed we are and if we walk down
12:47 - to the
12:49 - water and maybe change the speed
12:52 - variable of our time of day so go under
12:54 - our time of day and change this to
12:56 - something like 30 so we can see changing
12:58 - quickly
13:01 - you can see that the color of the water
13:03 - now fits the day much more nicely and
13:07 - everything Blends together it's not like
13:09 - it's shining and um and glowing so
13:14 - that's pretty much it for this video
13:16 - guys I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see
13:18 - you in the next
13:28 - one yeah
