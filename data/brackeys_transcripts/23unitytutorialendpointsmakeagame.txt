00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello and
00:04 - welcome to video number 23 and make a
00:06 - game Aiken series on making a video game
00:09 - in unity in today's video we'll take a
00:12 - look at making an end scene
00:14 - which would be displayed once we've
00:16 - completed all of our levels we'll also
00:19 - have a look in that context at scene
00:21 - switching and we'll also do some GI work
00:26 - to update how our score it is displayed
00:29 - so here's the plan for today we'll start
00:31 - out by making the graphics for our end
00:33 - point but before we can start it I just
00:37 - click the mana mention that if you have
00:38 - any questions go to forum to practice to
00:41 - come and also if you want to support
00:43 - practice or just want some cool motion
00:48 - dice you can go to breaki Spreadshirt
00:51 - dive net the link will also be in the
00:53 - description and I will probably have
00:55 - some kind of annotation on the screen
00:57 - and here you can buy all kinds of
00:59 - breaking breccia smashing dice there's
01:01 - also an IM developer t-shirt and I've
01:05 - kind of redesigned the story here so if
01:07 - you want to support brackets and not own
01:10 - it you can do that by of course donating
01:12 - or going here and getting something cool
01:14 - for yourself okay so that was enough
01:18 - self-promotion for one video I think so
01:20 - let's get started by opening up a unity
01:22 - and you will see that nothing really has
01:25 - changed here however you will notice
01:27 - that I'm currently using the tag theme
01:29 - but again everything we are going to be
01:31 - doing will be completely available to
01:34 - you using the personal Edition which is
01:37 - of course free cool so the first thing
01:40 - we'll do here is making the graphics for
01:43 - our end point so currently we have these
01:45 - invisible checkpoints and our end point
01:48 - will work somewhat like those so first
01:52 - off let's go to game objects let's go
01:54 - under and and create a particle system
01:58 - let's drag this over here actually let's
02:00 - reset the transform to make it our reset
02:03 - under the drag it up a bit and over here
02:06 - so we can see what we're doing
02:07 - we'll also make a 3d object sphere and
02:11 - we'll rename this
02:13 - - let's just rename this to endpoint
02:16 - make sure to check is trigger on the
02:19 - sphere Collider because we're going to
02:21 - be using it as a trigger later we'll
02:23 - then drag the particle system under our
02:26 - in endpoint and reset the transform on
02:28 - that and reset the transform on our
02:31 - endpoints this way we can simply drag
02:34 - both of them and things should look
02:38 - pretty awesome
02:39 - and now inside of this endpoint here
02:42 - this is kind of B this is going to be
02:44 - kind of our core and so I just want this
02:47 - to be kind of an additive material so
02:50 - we'll right-click create material and
02:53 - we'll simply call this let's do simply
02:58 - endpoint matte maybe I will figure that
03:01 - out as we go but I want to go under the
03:05 - particles additive and the texture is
03:07 - just going to be the default particle
03:09 - one and that should be imported with any
03:11 - unity project and we'll simply leave the
03:15 - tint color as is here and drag it under
03:17 - there just to give it this cool-looking
03:21 - glowy core um once we get some particles
03:24 - in here this will look much better you
03:27 - can of course change the tiling here on
03:29 - to make to adjust kind of how it will
03:33 - look but for now this should be pretty
03:35 - fine so actually yeah let's just call
03:40 - that the end point Matt and I will
03:41 - duplicate this and make this the end
03:44 - point particles alright or maybe
03:49 - particle whatever you want to name that
03:50 - and that's going to be the material for
03:52 - our particles and so now we can go into
03:55 - our particle system and we can go on to
03:57 - the renderer and we can drag in our
04:00 - endpoint particles and now we can adjust
04:04 - that material down here for example we
04:08 - can tint the color in a kind of orange
04:11 - looking color there and I'm actually
04:14 - going to go all in with that for now I
04:16 - think that looks pretty nice and because
04:19 - we are using the additive blend mode you
04:21 - can see that it looks super cool
04:23 - depending on what the background is
04:26 - awesome so let's go into the shape here
04:29 - and change that to a sphere let's just
04:32 - drag this out and by the way this video
04:34 - might be a bit longer than usual but
04:37 - we'll just see as we go I might need to
04:41 - split it up into multiple parts cool so
04:44 - let's just drag this out a bit and
04:45 - basically the effect I'm going for here
04:47 - is this kind of wojtek's where our
04:50 - particles are getting drawn towards our
04:53 - center here so in order to do that I
04:56 - want to emit only from the shell and
04:58 - instead of letting the particles kind of
05:00 - flow out
05:01 - let's inverse their speed to something
05:04 - like minus 1 and that might be a bit too
05:08 - much so let's change this to a random
05:11 - between two constants and let's do minus
05:14 - 0.3 maybe and minus 0.5 so you can see
05:20 - that they are moving in which and we can
05:22 - change the lifetime to maybe 3 and you
05:25 - can see now that they are getting sucked
05:27 - towards the center and we can also
05:30 - change the status signs just bump that
05:32 - down for now so we can see more clearly
05:35 - what's going on you can see right now
05:37 - this lifetime is actually too short or
05:41 - too long because they are moving past
05:43 - the center and then continuing so let's
05:46 - just change the lifetime to let's try 2
05:48 - and that actually looks pretty accurate
05:52 - I kind of want them to pile up in the
05:54 - center here what we can do is we can
05:57 - change the velocity over a lifetime
06:00 - simply limited over lifetime actually to
06:03 - make them slow down as they reach the
06:05 - center and we can do that by what is it
06:09 - we need to change the speed here by
06:17 - using a curve yeah okay so go over here
06:20 - and select curve and we will simply make
06:22 - that fall off so you can see they slow
06:25 - down as they reach the center and should
06:27 - start piling up in there and now we can
06:30 - just bump up the lifetime again and
06:32 - we'll be sure that they don't go too far
06:35 - so that looks pretty good
06:36 - next up I want to
06:39 - kind of make them grow as they reach the
06:42 - center so in order to do that we are
06:45 - going to set the size size of a lifetime
06:48 - so the size here will simply drag I'm
06:53 - just going to choose one of these
06:54 - presets with a curve here so I'm going
06:56 - to change this to everyone
06:58 - and I'll just bump up the live the slab
07:00 - size a bit so that they are not entirely
07:04 - invisible once they spawn and I think we
07:09 - can bump up the overall size a bit to
07:13 - something like that looks a lot better
07:15 - and we can maybe also rein them - so
07:18 - let's - use random between two constants
07:21 - and let's do 0.4 and 0.6 maybe just so
07:27 - that doesn't look too uniform and it's
07:29 - also bump up the emission amount let's
07:32 - try a 30 now that's starting to look
07:35 - really awesome and yeah I'm actually
07:39 - quite satisfied with that
07:40 - let's also fade them in and out so let's
07:43 - go into color over lifetime bump that
07:45 - down and up here we'll simply choose an
07:48 - FF 0 here we'll choose it an alpha of
07:51 - max which is 255 and just get that quick
07:55 - fade out there and do the same up here
07:57 - something like that and I think that
08:00 - looks really smooth and cold so let's
08:03 - see that in the game and I want this to
08:05 - be a kind of concentrated effect I can
08:08 - see that they start out a bit too large
08:14 - the
08:15 - looks a bit cooler and I also want to
08:18 - bring this in a bit which means that
08:21 - we'll have to bump down our lifetime
08:23 - here to let's say two and I also want to
08:28 - simply scale down our endpoint graphic
08:33 - there a bit whoops that actually scaled
08:35 - our particle system too and so one thing
08:39 - we might want to do is simply remove
08:41 - this vehicle ID from this create an
08:44 - empty game object instead which is going
08:48 - to be our end point we can then rename
08:51 - this to let's say mesh or graphics or
08:57 - whatever you want to do I'm going to
08:58 - call this one graphics and I'm going to
09:01 - have the particle system here also so
09:03 - particles and then this way we can
09:07 - control all of these separately so we
09:09 - can simply scale down this without
09:13 - affecting the rest you can see that
09:15 - gives us a cool-looking core especially
09:17 - if we go into this material here and
09:20 - change the color to something more
09:24 - orangey and we can also rotate this so
09:30 - that the highlight points towards our
09:32 - camera I think that looks really cool
09:34 - and now we can add a sphere Collider
09:39 - here change the trigger and simply bump
09:42 - in the radius so that it fits and we are
09:46 - going to reset these on on the transform
09:51 - whoops that reset everything so we are
09:54 - simply going to reset the position so 0
09:56 - 0 0 and 0 0 0 yeah that looks really
10:03 - awesome
10:04 - and now we can reset that one drag it up
10:07 - drag it over and you can see that
10:10 - everything is what is actually working
10:12 - now so once we hit play now we should
10:18 - see this core here which we can bump
10:20 - into you will however notice that it
10:22 - starts out looking a little bit weird
10:24 - and that's because we have to pre warm
10:25 - our particle system in or
10:28 - for it to look cool right from the
10:30 - beginning or else it's going to start
10:32 - spawning particles from when we play the
10:35 - game you can bump up the size a bit on
10:38 - these particles if you want the effect
10:39 - to be more crazy or maybe do a bit more
10:43 - particles something like this but I
10:46 - think this looks good for now and of
10:47 - course you can always do more tweaking
10:49 - so let's drag this into a prefab and
10:52 - plate place it onto the prefabs folder
10:55 - now on this we're going to create a
10:58 - script that will switch scenes once we
11:01 - collide with this trigger
11:02 - so in here we'll simply create an
11:05 - endpoint script and of course we want
11:09 - this to be of type JavaScript now let's
11:12 - double click this to open it up in
11:13 - monodevelop oops come on there we go and
11:18 - it's opening up and in here I'm just
11:21 - going to assume may not appear on the
11:22 - code here basically all we want to do is
11:25 - we want to have a function call on
11:30 - trigger enter and make sure to spell it
11:33 - the exact same way that I've done
11:34 - because remember this is a method that a
11:38 - unit is set to call whenever something
11:40 - enters our trigger and we're going to
11:44 - collect some Collider info and that's
11:46 - going to be of type Collider and that
11:49 - Collider info is going to allow us to
11:52 - check for a tag and we're going to check
11:55 - if that's equal to player and this is
11:59 - all something we've been over before
12:01 - then if it is actually the player we are
12:04 - colliding with we want to call a method
12:07 - that we are storing on our game master
12:09 - and that's going to be the load next
12:11 - level method and we're going to create
12:13 - that in a second but we're simply going
12:15 - to call it for now so we're going to
12:17 - make a game master reference here type
12:20 - game master and then in here we're
12:25 - simply going to do game master dot load
12:27 - next level this way our game master will
12:32 - take care of everything once we are
12:33 - loading a next level such as storing the
12:36 - score and what level we want to load and
12:40 - everything like
12:41 - cool so now we can simply save this
12:43 - script and it is going to give us some
12:45 - error because some errors because
12:47 - currently we don't have this method
12:48 - actually it's not but it is going to do
12:52 - that once we play and enter yeah there
12:56 - you can see that we aren't
12:59 - oh yeah that's because we haven't set up
13:01 - the reference so we can do that to
13:03 - simply drag in the TM there and that
13:06 - should be working now you can see that
13:09 - it couldn't load this level because it
13:13 - wasn't added to the build settings
13:14 - that's actually kind of we okay I see
13:17 - why it wasn't give us and giving us an
13:19 - error now that's because I've changed
13:21 - the script just to practice out what
13:23 - we're going to be doing today let's now
13:25 - have reverted those changes and you
13:28 - should see that yeah okay that there is
13:30 - no load next level on the game master so
13:33 - now it's actually complaining like it
13:36 - should ok sorry about that never mind it
13:38 - so basically what we want to do is go
13:41 - into the game master script and in here
13:44 - we want to add oops we want to add a
13:48 - method a function called dot next level
13:53 - and it's not going to take in in any
13:57 - parameters however it is going to simply
14:04 - load up oops
14:06 - application dot load level and the level
14:10 - that we are going to load is simply
14:12 - going to be the next level in our build
14:14 - settings so you could do it some kind of
14:17 - a variable that shows what level to load
14:20 - here you can load using a name so simply
14:23 - if you want to want it to load an int
14:26 - level if we've made that you can do that
14:29 - using a simple string but I'm simply
14:32 - going to do application that loaded
14:35 - level so it's going to take the current
14:36 - level by an index and then through a +1
14:41 - in order to make it load the next level
14:43 - in the series so if we do this and save
14:48 - this out will actually have complete
14:50 - control over what level is loaded inside
14:53 - of our file
14:54 - build settings in here we can simply add
14:57 - scenes and it's simply going to load the
14:59 - next one so suddenly the build settings
15:02 - order is going to be very important
15:03 - because you can see over here we have
15:06 - the index so if we on level one it's
15:08 - going to try and load one plus one which
15:11 - is level two and that also means that if
15:14 - you don't add a level here it's going to
15:16 - give us an error so make sure that
15:18 - you've dragged in the you drag in the
15:21 - gamemaster here and hit play and you can
15:23 - see that this is going to give us an
15:24 - error and the error is that level two
15:28 - couldn't be loaded because it has not
15:30 - been added to the build settings that's
15:32 - actually a very good error because it
15:34 - tells you exactly what you need to do
15:36 - awesome so basically what we want to do
15:40 - now is we want to make another level and
15:42 - we can simply make a quick taste test
15:44 - level here you can have as many levels
15:47 - such as you want so I'm simply going to
15:49 - duplicate level one and make it level
15:52 - two here instead whoops I haven't saved
15:55 - it so it didn't give store all the
15:58 - changes let's load up level one here
16:00 - make sure we have an end point and let's
16:03 - also apply our check and change this on
16:05 - that save the scene and now we duplicate
16:07 - the level
16:08 - it's going to automatically rename it to
16:10 - level two and just to show that this is
16:13 - another level I'm going to add in some
16:15 - kind of object here just a cube so we
16:18 - can see the difference on the two levels
16:20 - that has a cube right there and I'm
16:22 - going to save that and when we now go
16:24 - into our main menu
16:25 - let's just play from the beginning hit
16:28 - play game go in here it's going to lead
16:30 - load up whoops
16:32 - of course we need it we need to add it
16:34 - to the build settings so build settings
16:35 - and drag in level two you here and let's
16:38 - try that again
16:39 - hit play play again
16:42 - go in there and it's going to load up
16:44 - level two now let's say that we wanted
16:47 - to have an end scene which displays our
16:50 - final score and I find the score is
16:53 - simply going to be a sum of all of the
16:56 - amounts of coins we've collected
16:58 - throughout our levels but currently we
17:00 - only have a system that actually
17:03 - remembers the score that we have for the
17:07 - current level because if we go into our
17:09 - game master script you will see that we
17:13 - have this static variable called current
17:15 - score and remember static variables will
17:18 - persist between scenes so this is going
17:22 - to be remembered but it's reset every
17:25 - time we restart the scene so basically
17:28 - we want to have another static variable
17:31 - called the final score and this is also
17:34 - going to be of type integer and default
17:37 - to zero then what we can do with this is
17:39 - we make sure not to reset it every time
17:42 - but every time we load a next level and
17:45 - you don't want to do this inside the
17:47 - restart level we only want to do this if
17:50 - we've actually completed the level then
17:53 - we want to add on to the final score so
17:55 - we want to say final score plus equals
17:58 - the current score so this way the final
18:04 - score will be stored between levels if
18:06 - you actually quit the game or restarted
18:09 - in the editor and the progress is going
18:11 - to disappear so if that's something you
18:14 - want to change you might want to look
18:16 - into player preferences but if you just
18:20 - play from start to end this is going to
18:23 - work just fine so if if that's not good
18:27 - enough for you you're going to look have
18:29 - to look into some kind of saving system
18:30 - unity has a very easy one called player
18:33 - prefs I believe I teach that in in the
18:38 - unity survival course but if not there's
18:40 - plenty of tutorials out there and if you
18:44 - want to get very serious you need to do
18:46 - some kind of binary civilization or
18:48 - something like that
18:49 - they're also assets on the asset soil
18:51 - story to help you with this but I do
18:53 - thing we're going to be going into it
18:55 - here cool so now that we have that let's
18:58 - simply save that out and now we know
19:00 - that we have the static variable
19:02 - remembering our score however we are
19:05 - currently not displaying this variable
19:07 - so right now I want to go ahead and
19:11 - create an end scene because we've had a
19:14 - look at our endpoint graphics so we can
19:16 - delete that we've done scene switching
19:18 - we can delete that now it's time to
19:20 - probably end our game so let's duplicate
19:25 - our main menu I think that's going to be
19:27 - a good starting point for this and let's
19:29 - call this the end level let's load it up
19:32 - and actually I want to keep pretty much
19:36 - everything inside of this scene however
19:41 - I do want to delete our music and
19:43 - instead add in a game manager so under
19:47 - prefabs I'll drag in the GM object and
19:51 - place it at the top because I like to
19:52 - have it there and we'll just leave the
19:55 - player as none and the game over sound
19:57 - as none because we're not going to be
20:00 - using it because we're not actually
20:02 - playing our game here this is just a
20:05 - menu of sorts and then inside of our
20:08 - canvas let's go under the 2d mode here
20:11 - and zoom in on that I want to delete
20:14 - everything and instead create some text
20:17 - objects the first one is going to be a
20:19 - yeah of course UI text and this is going
20:22 - to say game completed and I'm simply
20:28 - going to use the Arial font I would
20:30 - recommend you get something more
20:31 - original but that's going to be fine for
20:33 - now you can simply import files by
20:35 - dragging them into the project and
20:37 - selecting them here the plenty on the
20:39 - asset store and that fund that way every
20:41 - you want to use then we're going to
20:44 - change the type to bolt we're going to
20:46 - Center it on the x and y and we're going
20:49 - to definitely bump up the size here
20:51 - quite a bit
20:53 - want to make this really huge
20:57 - and we're going to change the color here
20:59 - to white you will however notice that
21:01 - this makes it blend with the background
21:03 - so let's also add a shadow simply search
21:06 - for shadow and this effect should be
21:09 - very quickly applied and that just gives
21:10 - it this cool shadow edge it's not a soft
21:15 - shadow for that you will have to find
21:16 - again another way but this is going to
21:20 - work just fine for our use so I'm simply
21:24 - going to drag it up a bit here maybe
21:26 - just a bit more something like that and
21:29 - under that I want to add a score so
21:32 - that's called this the game completed
21:35 - text let's just duplicate that call this
21:40 - the score text and let's make this a lot
21:46 - smaller something like 28 is going to be
21:50 - fine for now let's also make the actual
21:53 - object smaller let's drag this down
21:55 - change it to score and then we'll just
21:59 - put in a temporary number which is going
22:01 - to be let's say 20 just to see how this
22:04 - will look and basically we can just use
22:07 - all of the same settings however I want
22:09 - to snap it to the left and drag it over
22:12 - a bit here also just a bit to the top
22:14 - left corner something like that and I
22:17 - think that it's going to be looking
22:20 - pretty great I will just make this a bit
22:25 - less tall and just drag it up here to
22:29 - make it closer to the text and I think
22:31 - that looks pretty nice you can of course
22:33 - play around with this more to get it
22:36 - looking exactly how you want cool so now
22:40 - we want to change the score text
22:42 - depending on what our score actually is
22:44 - and also while we remember it let's add
22:48 - this level to the build settings so
22:50 - simply drag in the end level here
22:53 - cool so now let's create a script on
22:57 - discord text that will link up with the
23:00 - DM object to get its current score or
23:03 - the final score I should say so let's
23:05 - call this the score GUI script and let's
23:12 - make it of type JavaScript and basically
23:15 - I want to have this a score GUI script
23:18 - access rgm object and then I wanted to
23:22 - change the text component that we
23:27 - reference so in order to do this we
23:30 - simply need to access the final score
23:34 - which is a static variable so we don't
23:36 - need any references to our game master
23:38 - script and this way we can simply go
23:42 - we'll do this in the function start and
23:46 - in here we'll simply say that our okay
23:53 - we need a reference and we need a
23:55 - reference to our kuia object so we'll
23:58 - call this the score text and it's going
24:01 - to be of type text or you will notice
24:03 - that this doesn't work unless we import
24:06 - the unity GUI system so we need to
24:09 - import unity engine which is the unity
24:12 - namespace daunt UI this way on the text
24:18 - type will actually be imported and now
24:22 - we can simply say score text and to
24:25 - access this string that this hosts we
24:28 - need to do dot text and we need to set
24:31 - that equal to game master and remember
24:34 - this is capital because it's a static
24:37 - method or a static variable that we are
24:40 - trying to access and then a final score
24:43 - and this should work just fine this way
24:48 - we can go in here and if we wait a bit
24:51 - whoops cannot convert into string that's
24:54 - because we are currently setting the
24:57 - string score text text equal to the
25:00 - integer of final score and one way to
25:04 - get rid of this is good to do dot
25:06 - to string like this or we could simply
25:11 - just and this is something we need to do
25:13 - anyways say score like that
25:16 - Plus game mastered final score because
25:19 - we wanted to say score we don't only
25:21 - want to display the number so we're
25:23 - going to do that clear that and you can
25:27 - see that we can now drag in our text
25:29 - which is going to be the same object
25:30 - that it's currently sitting on and now
25:33 - we can simply hit play and this should
25:35 - change to a zero cool you will however
25:38 - notice and this is the other thing we
25:41 - have to change up here it says score
25:44 - zero we don't want this to this be
25:46 - displayed on our end level and actually
25:51 - we don't want it to be displayed
25:53 - anywhere else I don't think this graphic
25:55 - is very pretty I think we should be
25:57 - using the new UI system instead and
25:59 - that's the final point is updating the
26:01 - score display so just like we've done it
26:04 - here where this shows the final score on
26:07 - stat we want to create an object up here
26:10 - on all of our levels that stores our
26:13 - current score on update mmm cool so
26:19 - let's actually implement that so inside
26:22 - of our our method here we'll simply
26:25 - create a boolean because I think we
26:31 - should whoops that's not the correct
26:33 - syntax I think we should make this
26:35 - squeeze script both be able to be used
26:39 - on the actual actually let's just make a
26:43 - separate script we'll do that so this is
26:46 - going to be our final score GUI let's
26:53 - rename that make sure that it still sits
26:56 - on the score text here the final score
26:58 - GUI you might need to close it in
27:01 - monodevelop to make sure it's synced up
27:02 - and let's make another script
27:06 - of type JavaScript and this is going to
27:09 - be our current score GUI and this is
27:13 - going to update every time we draw a
27:16 - frame because we don't know when it will
27:18 - be changing we could make a method or a
27:21 - function for actually updating this text
27:25 - object which we could then a call every
27:28 - time we collect the coin but for
27:30 - simplicity's sake we're simply going to
27:32 - be updating inside of the update
27:34 - function so very similarly we are going
27:36 - to be doing almost the same we're going
27:39 - to import the GUI system so import Unity
27:43 - engine it's the namespace GUI and we're
27:48 - going to store a reference to our score
27:51 - text of type text and we are simply
27:55 - going to set our score text equal oak
27:59 - text equal to score or maybe we should
28:05 - say coins or something like that we
28:08 - could also say I
28:10 - I think I'm actually going to say coins
28:12 - collected + and then we're going to do
28:18 - game master dot current score it should
28:25 - be that simple hopefully this will be
28:27 - working now we need to simply load up a
28:29 - level hit save on that and we need to
28:34 - change the game master script here to
28:37 - not display the ugly GUI that we've
28:41 - currently been using so simply remove
28:43 - that GUI method there and we can also
28:46 - delete the size X and size and all of
28:49 - this offset code because that's just for
28:52 - messing around with the GUI instead
28:54 - we're going to be using the pretty new
28:56 - GUI system and in here I simply want to
28:59 - create a UI text and you will notice
29:03 - that it automatically creates the canvas
29:05 - - and let's just call this GUI let's do
29:11 - blue canvas and that's I'll rename this
29:15 - to score text
29:17 - and let's sit this onto the game up GM
29:21 - object I think that would be a pretty
29:24 - good idea because this way we can simply
29:27 - know because that way it's going to be
29:29 - displayed everywhere so let's make this
29:31 - into a separate object and simply have
29:34 - that sit on all levels that we create
29:36 - and in here we are simply going to
29:38 - rename our score text to coins collected
29:43 - and then let's just insert 20 again here
29:48 - and let's make this a lot better bigger
29:51 - Center it bump up the font size let's do
29:58 - something like 20 bring it up here
30:04 - let's also snap it to the top or anchor
30:09 - it to the top so that when we the screen
30:12 - is resized
30:13 - it will move with the top here as you
30:17 - can see and let's change this to white
30:20 - and add a shadow again see how that's
30:25 - looking I think that's pretty great and
30:28 - now we simply want to make this actually
30:31 - update we could make a tiny background
30:35 - for this and that's kind of up to you if
30:37 - that's something you want to do you
30:39 - could also change it to black and add a
30:41 - white outline you could do lots of
30:45 - things here you can see how that looks
30:47 - in black we might just want to keep that
30:49 - in black I definitely want it to be bold
30:52 - actually and let's bump it up even
30:55 - higher maybe that's even better I don't
30:59 - know why I actually like the white
31:00 - whoops divided with a black shadow but
31:04 - we can make the shadow a bit bigger so
31:08 - we can do two here and minus two and
31:12 - maybe also make it less transparent
31:15 - something like that looks pretty fun
31:19 - actually
31:19 - cool so of course play around that and
31:23 - now we simply need to drag on our final
31:29 - score script
31:31 - to that object no oh no not our final
31:33 - score our current score script to that
31:36 - object and simply drag in the text onto
31:40 - the score text awesome now we can simply
31:45 - drag this into the prefabs folder and we
31:47 - can make sure that it's added to level
31:49 - two also so let's load up level two and
31:52 - drag in the presets here the Google
31:55 - canvass and just drag it up here and now
32:01 - when we play in the main menu hit play
32:07 - game cards collected zero coins
32:10 - collected one we go on to the next level
32:13 - oh it resets to zero because that's
32:17 - dependent on the level it's going to say
32:21 - one here we're going to load the final
32:24 - level and it's going to say score is two
32:27 - so that's exactly what we needed and
32:30 - frankly that's the end of a very long
32:33 - tutorial this was wow this was actually
32:36 - pretty long I think it's enough to
32:40 - barely fit into one video so that's
32:43 - awesome and yeah that's pretty much all
32:45 - I wanted to show today I know this was a
32:48 - lot of coding and back and forth and we
32:51 - did some graphics and everything sir I
32:53 - hope you caught it and if not you can
32:54 - simply copy my steps and you will
32:57 - understand that some some point don't
32:59 - worry but yeah thanks for watching the
33:01 - video again if you have any questions
33:03 - about this go to farm to breakfast to
33:06 - come and also check out the new store at
33:08 - brackish that Spreadshirt dotnet cool so
33:12 - that was everything for this video I
33:14 - hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in
33:16 - the next one
33:18 - you
