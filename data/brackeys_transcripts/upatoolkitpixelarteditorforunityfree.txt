00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello and
00:04 - welcome to maybe the most exciting video
00:06 - I've done in quite some time
00:08 - so the last couple of weeks I've been
00:10 - working on an editor extension for unity
00:13 - and it just went live on the unity asset
00:15 - store the editor extension is called
00:18 - unity pixel art toolkit and it makes it
00:21 - fast and easy to create pixel art
00:23 - sprites without leaving the comfort of
00:26 - unity so if you need to efficiently and
00:29 - and quickly create some pixel art now
00:32 - you don't even have to leave unity you
00:34 - can just do it inside of unity itself so
00:38 - you whoops
00:39 - UPA toolkit is currently available for
00:42 - free on the unity asset store and it
00:46 - currently requires unity 4.6.1
00:48 - or higher and that's the current version
00:51 - as of the recording of this video but
00:53 - I've just submitted a update that makes
00:59 - it compatible all the way back to unity
01:01 - 4.3 so once that gets approved it should
01:04 - be updated here and then you guys with
01:08 - with a lower version can use it too but
01:11 - enough set for now I will also quickly
01:15 - say that it's available on github and
01:16 - encourage you to leave a review because
01:19 - it really helps out with getting noticed
01:22 - on the asset story if you guys leave a
01:25 - hopefully positive review but that's of
01:28 - course up to you any review is better
01:30 - than and nothing so I've rambled on way
01:34 - too much let's get started so if you
01:36 - click on the link in the description or
01:38 - just go to the asset store and search
01:41 - for uph toolkit you can see browse to it
01:44 - and open up in unity simply click that
01:47 - button there and I've already imported
01:49 - it and all that it won't take long it's
01:52 - it's under one megabyte the entire
01:54 - toolkit so it's very fast to download
01:57 - once you've downloaded it you will
02:00 - notice that you have this new folder you
02:02 - paid to a kit and inside of this is the
02:03 - entire extension we have a readme that
02:06 - dark with some documentation on how to
02:08 - get started and some some
02:13 - some stuff about the get up page and
02:15 - also the shortcuts if you want to move
02:19 - faster throughout the UI and then also
02:22 - all of the c-sharp scripts and the
02:25 - toolkit is written entirely in c-sharp
02:26 - and all the code is of course publicly
02:29 - available so you can just change
02:31 - anything you want and if you want to
02:34 - redistribute or help me develop this
02:39 - this at this extension I suggest you
02:42 - check out the github page and have a
02:45 - look at the license file there is also a
02:47 - a guide on how to contribute to the
02:50 - project if you want me to improve on
02:52 - this because there are of course still
02:54 - improvements to be way made this is
02:56 - still version 1.0 I'm showing you so
03:00 - keep that in mind
03:02 - cool now let's get started with creating
03:04 - a pixel art sprite so to do this let's
03:08 - go to window and you will notice that
03:10 - that is now a new tab called pixel ID
03:12 - editor or simply press ctrl shift P
03:15 - you're going to click that and let's
03:17 - just dark this up here by the scene and
03:20 - game tabs and you can see that I've made
03:25 - my UI ready for painting so we have this
03:27 - huge area for painting which is really
03:30 - nice then I'm going to go ahead and
03:32 - click a new image it's going to pop up
03:36 - with a dialog where I can change the
03:38 - resolution width it's going to be 16 and
03:41 - the height is also going to be 16 now we
03:44 - create and you can name and place your
03:47 - image anywhere you want this is not the
03:50 - final image file this is the project
03:54 - file sort of say and I'm going to name
03:56 - this mushroom because I'm going to be
03:58 - creating the mushroom from Mario that we
04:01 - all love now hit save and you can see
04:04 - that it opens up this canvas here on
04:07 - this empty canvas that where the eye
04:10 - almost entirely white cells represent
04:12 - what is currently transparent and you
04:16 - can see we have this toolbar where we
04:18 - can zoom in and out or using these
04:21 - buttons we can open other images or
04:25 - create new ones or expert
04:26 - when we done select the color we have
04:29 - three tools paint erase and you will
04:32 - notice if we click box fill this is
04:34 - currently in development I'm working as
04:36 - hard as I can on that then we can use
04:39 - WASD or the up and down arrow keys to
04:44 - navigate if that's what you want is
04:46 - simply centered on the view and then we
04:49 - can switch between black and white
04:51 - gridlines so if you're making something
04:53 - that is quite black you can change this
04:58 - to white cool so I'm just going to go
05:01 - ahead and quickly paint on some stuff
05:04 - here and I'm going to speed through it
05:06 - and I'll see you when I'm done
05:15 - you
05:17 - okay so I'm done with creating my
05:19 - mushroom here I think it looks quite
05:21 - like the Mario games and now I can
05:23 - simply hit export up here it's going to
05:27 - select itself then we can change the
05:29 - save as type notice that if you save as
05:32 - a JPEG you will lose transparency and
05:34 - this also requires 4.5 to work so most
05:39 - of the time I don't see in the reason
05:40 - why you wouldn't use PNG but the option
05:42 - is there and then we have the texture
05:44 - type where you can simply change between
05:46 - a sprite which the four-point-three
05:49 - system uses where texture if you want to
05:52 - apply it to a game object now we can
05:55 - simply hit export and we can change
05:58 - where we want to save this or whatever
06:01 - I'm simply going to save it under the
06:02 - assets folder and I call it mushroom now
06:06 - it's save and you will notice that our
06:07 - mushroom appears down here and it set up
06:11 - all the import settings so it works with
06:13 - pixel art you can of course change the
06:16 - pixels per unit the pivot point on that
06:18 - if you're not satisfied one thing you
06:20 - will have to do in this current version
06:22 - is change it from compressed to true
06:25 - color just to make sure that the colors
06:28 - I write if not they might look a bit odd
06:31 - and that's something I'm going to change
06:33 - it to do automatically of course in a
06:36 - version to come so now we can simply go
06:39 - into the scene view and the project here
06:43 - I mean is the one from the 2d platformer
06:45 - series so check that out if you're
06:47 - interested and then we can simply drag
06:49 - it into our scene and there you go
06:51 - you've created a pixel add sprite that
06:53 - you can use inside your scene like any
06:56 - other object we could maybe add a fixed
06:59 - physics component here rigidbody and a
07:01 - circle Collider and he'll play and you
07:04 - will notice that it simply just works it
07:07 - will fall to the ground here we could
07:09 - push it over and it's part of the scene
07:12 - and if we want to make any changes and
07:14 - this is where the system here becomes
07:17 - incredibly useful we simply go back to
07:19 - the pixel art editor make the change we
07:22 - want let's say we want something in here
07:24 - to be blue don't know why we would do
07:27 - this but we're doing it like
07:32 - we can simply hit export again export
07:34 - and just override it and now it's
07:38 - updated in the scene view and it will
07:40 - wake so it's so so fast and easy to do
07:43 - of course if you want to do more
07:45 - advanced stuff you can also use this PNG
07:49 - just open it up in Photoshop if you want
07:51 - to do if you think a tool is missing or
07:55 - something but really if you have any
07:57 - features you want to request go to the
08:00 - brackets forum go to the github page I
08:03 - should be possible to reach and I really
08:07 - want to know what you guys would like
08:09 - this tool to be and how you would like
08:11 - to see it grow in the future
08:13 - so thanks for watching this introduction
08:15 - video to UPA toolkit version 1.0 I hope
08:19 - you enjoyed it and please again leave a
08:23 - review it helps out a lot I've shared
08:27 - this asset for free in hopes that it
08:29 - will reach as many people as possible
