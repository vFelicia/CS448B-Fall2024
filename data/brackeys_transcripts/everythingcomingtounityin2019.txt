00:00 - so we promised to make a video about all
00:01 - the stuff that is coming to unity in
00:03 - 2019
00:04 - and the amount of features is frankly
00:06 - overwhelming so buckle up your info
00:09 - right but first this video is sponsored
00:11 - by sin T Studios sin T Studios is a
00:14 - leading acid story publisher that makes
00:16 - super cool stylized art packs for it
00:19 - game developers the packs are easy to
00:21 - use great for beginners and fun for
00:23 - prototypes and jams and frankly they are
00:26 - just gorgeous since he has over 70 art
00:29 - packs on the asset store with themes
00:30 - like City sci-fi fantasy and many more
00:33 - so no matter what theme you're going for
00:35 - these packs will help you get started
00:37 - for a limited time you can get 25% off
00:39 - using the code sent to practice 25 and
00:42 - this even includes their latest pack
00:44 - polygon sci-fi space I mean just look at
00:47 - those colors if you want to check out
00:49 - their stuff that's of course a link for
00:50 - that in the description so unity just
00:52 - held their official GDC keynote and here
00:55 - we got some exciting news one of the
00:57 - things that I was most excited to see
00:59 - was the new demo from the atom demo team
01:01 - it's called the heretic and it looks
01:03 - absolutely amazing never mind the fact
01:06 - that I had to look up what heretic means
01:07 - now I just can't wait to talk about this
01:10 - one so I'm gonna jump straight into it
01:11 - unity has partnered up with havoc which
01:14 - is an amazing physics engine to create
01:16 - an all new physics engine for unity
01:18 - called unity physics it's based on dots
01:21 - which probably means that it's going to
01:23 - be really performant and lightweight and
01:25 - it's built with networking in mind and
01:28 - on top of that they've also added
01:29 - integration with the havok physic's
01:31 - engine also using dots which means that
01:33 - we can now get to choose between unity
01:36 - physics and havok physic's depending on
01:38 - the needs of your game having been
01:40 - really great for more complex physics
01:42 - simulation also on another note
01:44 - real-time ray tracing is now a thing in
01:46 - unity with an experimental build
01:48 - available on April 4th the demo for this
01:51 - was just stunning
01:52 - personally I'm still a bit confused as
01:54 - to when this super realistic looking
01:55 - technology will be usable in actual game
01:58 - scenarios so I'm just looking forward to
02:00 - trying it out and seeing what it will do
02:02 - to future unity games also and I called
02:05 - it at the beginning of the stream your
02:06 - cube did wear the pink shirt once again
02:08 - that man never disappoints why did he in
02:11 - terms of features he talked
02:13 - about dots which is the new name for ECS
02:15 - the C shop job system and the burst
02:17 - compiler combined this entire tech stack
02:20 - is insanely powerful and he showed that
02:22 - it's starting to get more integrated
02:24 - into the editor which makes it much
02:26 - easier to start wrapping your head
02:28 - around also huge congratulations to
02:30 - everyone involved with the AR demo this
02:32 - time it went really well
02:34 - and I think we all know how
02:35 - nerve-racking a live AR demo can be good
02:38 - job but the real Meade as always was in
02:41 - the roadmap talk that was held at the
02:43 - booth later that week here they gave a
02:45 - really good overview of what to expect
02:47 - from unity in the coming year which is
02:49 - also why I don't understand why they
02:51 - don't make this a main event luckily we
02:53 - went there and here's what they showed
02:55 - with version 2019 point 1 unity has
02:58 - quick search I think this is actually a
03:00 - really big deal since it's such a useful
03:02 - tool for beginners and it's one of my
03:05 - favorite parts about using blender so
03:07 - it's really nice to see this coming to
03:08 - unity as well as for project tiny it's
03:11 - currently in preview you can try it out
03:12 - now using the package manager timeline
03:15 - is getting markers that allows you to
03:16 - jump to a certain part of the timeline
03:18 - and signals which is basically like
03:20 - event triggers so that's really nice the
03:23 - SRP core and lightweight are production
03:26 - ready for 19.1 yay and it has the
03:30 - ability to create custom render passes
03:32 - through the editor which allows you to
03:33 - create really cool effects without
03:35 - writing code like you see here on the
03:37 - characters on the screen here is all the
03:39 - new stuff coming to HDR P in 19.1 that
03:43 - is just a lot and I can't wait to play
03:45 - with it
03:45 - shader graph is now getting production
03:48 - ready and it has nested sub graphs which
03:50 - makes it so much more usable in larger
03:52 - projects the effects graph is coming to
03:54 - light weight over version nineteen point
03:56 - one and point two post-processing has
03:58 - now been integrated into HDR P along
04:01 - with some improved effects 2d and light
04:03 - weight is slowly getting more integrated
04:05 - with a specific 2d renderer for light
04:07 - weight and a 2d master node for shader
04:09 - graph and at this point they mentioned
04:11 - text mesh Pro and judging by what they
04:13 - showed here there are no real plans to
04:15 - integrate it further into the editor and
04:17 - haven't replaced the current system
04:19 - instead of what it is right now which is
04:21 - basically like a new system beside the
04:23 - old one personally I'm a bit confused by
04:25 - this move and we liked
04:27 - see tex-mex pro just completely replaced
04:29 - the old system the cinema sheen team is
04:31 - as always providing some solid updates
04:33 - throughout the year and cloth is back in
04:35 - the engine
04:36 - good to see you cloth you've been missed
04:38 - in the roadmap they also mentioned
04:40 - something called runtime animation
04:42 - rigging apparently this is some kind of
04:44 - in editor rigging I don't know but it
04:47 - sounds pretty cool of course they went
04:48 - over a lot of stuff that we've heard
04:49 - about before here's a list of when you
04:51 - can expect to see it the new input
04:53 - system is also finally being released as
04:55 - a package in 2019 point 1
04:58 - I really wonder why this wasn't part of
05:00 - the keynote since it feels like such a
05:02 - huge improvement
05:03 - now finally we got some more information
05:04 - about the new multiplayer system in fact
05:07 - they showed this graph of the tech stack
05:09 - it looks pretty much as you would expect
05:10 - but the cool thing about the new
05:12 - networking system is that it's based on
05:13 - dots and as you can see from this slide
05:16 - it's still very much being built what
05:18 - I'm really interested to see is how this
05:20 - will be built into the editor will we
05:22 - see a similar component based approach
05:24 - as we did with unit or something else in
05:26 - terms of hosting it's powered by
05:28 - multiplayer which is also the tech
05:30 - behind apex legends titanfall and rocket
05:32 - League so I imagine they know what
05:34 - they're doing they also talked a bit
05:36 - about matchmaking but it seems to still
05:37 - like a lot of needed functionality like
05:39 - groups latency based matchmaking and the
05:42 - ability to join in progress but kudos to
05:44 - unity for being so transparent on this
05:46 - one also unity has partnered up with
05:48 - vivix for in-game communication which is
05:51 - free for up to 5,000 users so that's
05:53 - pretty nice
05:54 - now unity collaborate is also being
05:56 - improved which was definitely needed
05:58 - version 2.0 is out as a package for 19.1
06:02 - with a lot of important functionality
06:04 - like branching coming in nineteen point
06:06 - three you can now also add notes to game
06:08 - objects and acids which sync over the
06:11 - cloud so that's pretty cool visual
06:13 - scripting has been moved to 2020 dot one
06:16 - of course it's too bad that will have to
06:17 - wait since the more here about this
06:19 - feature the more excited I get it's
06:21 - built for dots which means that it's
06:23 - going to be super fast and everything
06:25 - about it just looks delicious and so
06:27 - those of you who watched Google's
06:28 - announcement on stadia unity will be
06:30 - supporting it latency only time will
06:33 - tell so as you can see there are quite a
06:35 - bit of new features coming in 2019 these
06:38 - days a lot of features are being
06:40 - introduced
06:40 - used in a previous state which i think
06:42 - is really great because we get to try
06:44 - them out early and help improve on them
06:46 - however one thing that I've noticed with
06:48 - a couple of features is that after the
06:50 - initial launch development seems to slow
06:52 - down which is too bad because they only
06:54 - need the final 10% to be really their
06:56 - text much pro pro builder poly brush the
06:59 - new input system and the navmesh
07:01 - components have all been introduced a
07:03 - while back but I'm still waiting on them
07:05 - to be completely finished either in
07:06 - terms of UI or functionality I think the
07:09 - most important thing that got me to fall
07:10 - in love with unity was how everything
07:12 - felt like it was designed to fit
07:14 - together as one simple as can be tall
07:16 - and I think finishing these features
07:18 - would make sure the engine keeps being
07:19 - coherent and easy to use for example
07:22 - when you want to create a piece of text
07:24 - for your UI do choose text or a text -
07:27 - text mesh pro most beginners would
07:29 - probably choose the ordinary text object
07:31 - but at this point as far as my
07:32 - experience goes text much pro is pretty
07:34 - much better in every way not just to be
07:37 - totally clear I love all these new
07:38 - features and I think they are really
07:40 - great which is also why I think it's so
07:42 - important that we give them the time and
07:43 - attention that they deserve
07:45 - hashtag terrain love please because
07:47 - ultimately for me at least what got me
07:49 - to choose unity over other alternatives
07:51 - like unreal wasn't the amount of
07:53 - features or this state-of-the-art
07:54 - rendering it was the intuitiveness and
07:57 - simplicity of the tools and I think it's
07:59 - these qualities that has made unity so
08:01 - popular because they allow beginners and
08:03 - teams with fewer resources to make
08:05 - really cool and unique games however
08:07 - unity is giving plenty of love to a lot
08:09 - of features shader graph and the effects
08:12 - graph are outstanding and getting better
08:14 - every day the shuriken particle system
08:16 - team continues to amaze me
08:17 - cinema Sheen has been improved on so
08:19 - much since released and nested prefabs
08:21 - is just a really solid and great to work
08:23 - with system so keep it up unity now
08:26 - there of course a bunch of features that
08:27 - we haven't talked about if you want to
08:29 - learn more we'll have a link to the
08:30 - keynote as well as the release note for
