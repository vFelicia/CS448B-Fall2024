00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello and
00:04 - welcome to video number six in the how
00:07 - to make a 2d platformer course wow it's
00:10 - been quite a while since the last one
00:11 - I've been having a bunch of audio
00:14 - problems but they should soon be over
00:18 - with I've come up with a temporary fix
00:20 - until I get them solved and also if you
00:24 - want to follow my progress in making
00:26 - videos and should something come up
00:28 - always write on Twitter so please go
00:30 - ahead and follow me at Brad key Street
00:32 - for more updates so let's get into
00:35 - today's video as you can see we're going
00:38 - to be doing a bunch of fixes first off
00:41 - we are going to fix the characters
00:42 - colors because there something wrong
00:44 - with those then we're going to change
00:46 - the pivot of the arm then we're going to
00:49 - set up the parallaxing to work with our
00:50 - tiling script which a lot of you have
00:52 - been been writing me about it should be
00:55 - an easy fix and then we are going to fix
00:57 - the problem with collision where we get
01:00 - stuck on certain colliders so all of
01:05 - this we are going to do in the visual
01:07 - editor we're not going to be scripting
01:08 - today so it should be pretty easy to
01:11 - follow along cool so let's get started
01:14 - let's first off open up unity and fix
01:17 - the characters colors so if we have a
01:20 - look at the character here select the
01:22 - player and focus on them you can see
01:24 - that some of the colors here are not as
01:26 - they should be
01:27 - they're pretty washed out and that's
01:30 - because last time when I did a video I
01:32 - forgot to change what is called the the
01:36 - color compression here the color format
01:40 - to 16-bit so let's select the astronauts
01:43 - bright sheet and instead of hitting
01:45 - compressed let's change this to 16 bits
01:48 - this will be pretty accurate
01:53 - representation of the colors but if you
01:55 - want them to be completely accurate you
01:57 - can always do true color but I think 16
02:01 - bits is going to be just fine for this
02:03 - character so now you can see it looks
02:05 - much better already
02:07 - we could do a go ahead and do this with
02:09 - the environment also we can see how it
02:11 - looks so change this to 16-bit
02:13 - and now it's actually a bit more
02:17 - accurate than before again we can zoom
02:20 - in on the environment here and maybe
02:22 - compared so this is 16 bits and this is
02:25 - compressed so it's really up to you what
02:28 - you like the most we can also try to
02:29 - color and compare that to 16 bits
02:34 - actually I think I like true color on
02:37 - this quite a lot let's try and compare
02:40 - that to compressed mmm the difference is
02:44 - not big I think the 16 bits here is just
02:46 - a bit too vibrant in its colors I would
02:49 - like them to be just a bit watch washed
02:51 - out so I think I'm just going to leave
02:55 - it at compressed actually because the
02:58 - difference is not that big but you can
03:01 - leave it at true color if you want to of
03:03 - course compressed is going to be smaller
03:06 - in file size cool so now we can go ahead
03:10 - and move on to point number two which is
03:12 - changing the arm pivot because right now
03:15 - when we hit play you can see that our
03:18 - arm rotates towards our mouse cursor but
03:23 - it does so with a wrong pivot so let's
03:26 - have a look at our arm here zoom in on
03:30 - it so right now the pivot is all the way
03:32 - back here where the shoulders rotational
03:36 - pivot its anchor point would maybe be
03:39 - more like here so let's go ahead and
03:41 - change this we can set up what is called
03:43 - a custom pivot so let's select the
03:47 - astronauts bright field again and let's
03:50 - go ahead into and open the sprite editor
03:53 - let's zoom in on the arm here and
03:57 - instead of left pivot we're going to do
04:00 - custom and now we can adjust the X and
04:05 - the y to to Center the pivot where we
04:09 - want so we're simply going to take the X
04:11 - here and slide it over a bit and maybe
04:15 - bump up the wire bit so the X is going
04:17 - to be pretty much 0.18 and let's try 0.6
04:23 - for the Y that's actually pretty good I
04:26 - think
04:27 - going to do five seven that looks just
04:30 - perfect so now that we've set that up we
04:33 - can hit apply in the top right always
04:35 - remember to hit apply in this window and
04:37 - then we can exit out and now when we
04:41 - select them you can see that it's
04:42 - centered where this shoulder actually is
04:46 - so now we can again Center this on the
04:48 - player to be where we like and when we
04:53 - go in game now and rotate the arm it
04:55 - looks a lot more realistic it looks like
04:57 - it's actually rotating around a fixed
05:00 - shoulder that's really awesome maybe we
05:04 - want to push this over just a bit there
05:07 - see how this looks yeah that's better
05:10 - cool so now that we have this fixed
05:13 - let's move on to point number three
05:15 - which is setting up the parallaxing with
05:17 - tiling this is pretty much what we've
05:19 - been waiting for right so what we can do
05:21 - here is it's actually quite simple so
05:26 - right now the problem is that when we
05:28 - turn on tiling under our GM object or
05:31 - parallaxing I'm sorry you can see that
05:34 - once we get over here to Wed start to
05:37 - tile on the tiles don't move with each
05:40 - other and the reason why is that when we
05:43 - are automatically spawning new tiles
05:46 - they aren't added to the backgrounds
05:49 - list so they won't actually be affected
05:53 - by the parallaxing script and we could
05:56 - do this by adding them to the list
05:58 - through code but instead of doing all
06:02 - that it's really easier to just have
06:05 - groups of objects that will all move
06:08 - together so instead of adding the
06:11 - background Mountains blue for example
06:12 - directly here adding the single object
06:15 - we're going to create a container which
06:18 - is just going to be an empty game object
06:20 - where all our background mounts and blue
06:23 - objects are going to be parented to and
06:25 - this way when remove the empty game
06:29 - object they will all move at the same
06:31 - time so let me just show you what I mean
06:34 - here so right now you can see that this
06:37 - isn't working
06:38 - over here they are
06:40 - overlapping but what we're going to do
06:43 - is we are going to create an empty
06:44 - object so command shift N or
06:47 - control-shift-n
06:49 - if you're on a Windows like me and then
06:52 - we're going to name this background
06:55 - mountains blue and then maybe we're
07:01 - going to change this to singular instead
07:05 - of plural so we have a difference so we
07:07 - can differentiate between the container
07:11 - and the single element and then we're
07:15 - going to just zero this out
07:17 - just for good practice so make sure it's
07:19 - centered and then what we're going to do
07:22 - is we're going to give this the same Z
07:25 - position as deep background Mountain
07:28 - blue because remember our parallaxing
07:31 - script will parallax the objects
07:34 - depending on the Z value so we have to
07:36 - make sure that this is the same Z value
07:39 - as the mountains blue in order for it to
07:42 - parallax correctly so in order to do
07:45 - this we're simply going to select the
07:46 - background mount in blue and then we're
07:49 - going to copy over the Z value and paste
07:52 - it into the background Mountains blue
07:55 - our container so now that they have the
07:58 - same D position we can simply parent the
08:02 - Hmong background mounts in blue to the
08:05 - background mountains blue simply drag it
08:08 - under there and now when we hit play oh
08:12 - yeah we also have to add the container
08:15 - here to the list so instead of adding
08:17 - the background Mountain blue this single
08:20 - element you're going to add the
08:22 - background mountains blue so we're going
08:25 - to add the container there we could also
08:29 - instead actually let's just do instead
08:32 - of mountains blue it's simply too
08:34 - similar so let's do background mountains
08:38 - blue container it's a really long name
08:42 - and then let's just change this back to
08:44 - mountains I think this naming is going
08:47 - to be a little better so instead of
08:49 - adding the background mountains blue
08:50 - we're going to add the background
08:52 - mountains blue contain
08:53 - so just drag that on there to replace it
08:56 - and now the blue background should
08:59 - actually tile correctly now when we jump
09:01 - over here you can see that they are
09:03 - perfectly tiling and the reason why this
09:06 - is working is because if we open up our
09:10 - parallaxing script and monodevelop so
09:13 - just double click it to open it up we're
09:16 - going to wait for it here while it's
09:19 - opening I can just quickly talk about
09:21 - the unity editor changes so one thing
09:25 - you will notice over here in the new
09:27 - version of unity which is always that
09:30 - unity 4.5 I'm going to get this wrong
09:34 - where this is it it's you can always
09:38 - view this by going to edit I believe
09:41 - nope window nope help and yeah about
09:47 - unity and you can view your version
09:48 - number here so this is 4.5 and they've
09:51 - added the ability to sort things in the
09:53 - hierarchy so you don't like you don't
09:57 - have to do this underscore GM methods
09:59 - anymore to get them in top of the
10:00 - hierarchy you can simply drag them
10:02 - around and and sort them yourselves so
10:05 - that's pretty awesome but anyway let's
10:08 - go back into monodevelop here and that
10:10 - was not the script I wanted I wanted the
10:12 - parallaxing script here and what you
10:14 - will notice is that we if we search for
10:16 - parent know oh it's not the parallaxing
10:23 - script we want we want the the tiling
10:26 - scripts so let's find the tiling here
10:28 - that's what I wanted so if we look at
10:31 - the tiling here and we search for parent
10:33 - you will notice that whenever we are
10:35 - creating a new tile or a new body we are
10:39 - setting its parent to the same as the
10:42 - other tile and that's why we can simply
10:45 - just parent it to the blue container
10:48 - because all the other tiles will
10:51 - automatically be parent it to the same
10:53 - object and we can see this when we hit
10:55 - play if we disable maximize on play and
10:59 - then hit play we can see that if we run
11:03 - over here
11:05 - when it creates a clone it's also
11:07 - parented to the blue container so now we
11:10 - can simply use on the same methods for
11:12 - all the other tiling elements so let's
11:16 - just go ahead and create a new object
11:19 - again let's throw this out let's call
11:22 - this background mountains purple
11:30 - container
11:31 - let's drag under the background
11:34 - mountains purple let's just drag this up
11:37 - here so we have all of the background so
11:40 - we have all of the containers at the
11:42 - same place and yeah that was yeah of
11:46 - course we also oh we have to adjust the
11:49 - Z position of the container here so
11:52 - first off let's just drag out the object
11:55 - again so we can copy over the Z position
11:57 - so take the background mountains purple
12:00 - copy the Z position to the background
12:03 - mountains purple container hit enter and
12:06 - now we can parent it so there we go
12:09 - and then again in the GM object instead
12:12 - of having the background Mountains
12:14 - purple we're going to drag in the
12:16 - background mountains purple container
12:18 - like this cool then we can do the last
12:22 - thing with the foreground dirt so let's
12:25 - do command shift n let's rename this to
12:29 - foreground dirt container let's zero it
12:37 - out let's select the foreground dirt
12:42 - copy over the Z position to the
12:45 - foreground dirt container and let's
12:48 - parent the foreground dirt to the
12:50 - foreground dirt container let's drag it
12:52 - up here so we have them all in the same
12:54 - place and then let's select the GM
12:58 - object and drag on the foreground dirt
13:01 - container cool so now whenever you want
13:06 - to adjust the parallaxing of these
13:09 - elements make sure to select the entire
13:12 - container and not the individual objects
13:16 - awesome so now when we hit play all of
13:20 - our elements are correctly tiling and
13:24 - parallaxing as needed so that was
13:27 - awesome so that was the third a third
13:32 - pint here now we're going to go ahead
13:33 - and fix the collision so right now when
13:35 - we hit play and we jump into a Collider
13:39 - here and just keep on holding in the
13:41 - direction we are jumping here you can
13:44 - see that we get stuck and then when I
13:45 - really release the key it just waits
13:48 - like a half a second or something and
13:50 - then it falls and that's of course not
13:52 - something we want we don't want to get
13:54 - stuck to objects in this way and the fix
13:57 - is actually quite simple we're going to
14:00 - use what is called a physics what's
14:04 - called a physics object it's a physics
14:08 - material here so you're going to make a
14:10 - physics 2d material so right click in
14:12 - the project pane go to create physics 2d
14:16 - material and let's rename this
14:19 - two-player mature player physics fish
14:26 - mat let's do that player first mat and
14:28 - then the friction we're going to change
14:32 - this to zero so whenever you've zero out
14:35 - the friction you will make sure that we
14:37 - don't get stuck on walls so now when we
14:40 - select our player find the rigidbody
14:43 - component and then no actually not the
14:47 - rigidbody I mean the collider component
14:49 - the Box Collider here we can drag under
14:52 - the player physics and we are going to
14:56 - do the same to the circle Collider so
14:59 - now that our player frisomat is selected
15:02 - in both the circle Collider and the Box
15:04 - Collider when we hit play you will
15:08 - notice we behave just as before but when
15:11 - I jump into a platform we won't get
15:14 - stuck and of course you can adjust this
15:16 - effect if you bump up the friction just
15:18 - a bit something like 0.2 it will
15:23 - actually hang on completely now that
15:26 - make sense okay so you have to just
15:29 - throw this out completely because the
15:32 - friction it doesn't matter when you have
15:33 - a constant pole so make sure the
15:36 - friction is set to zero and that problem
15:38 - will be solved
15:40 - cool so that was basically it for
15:44 - today's video I know we didn't code in
15:47 - this one but we got a lot of stuff done
15:49 - and the game is now a little more
15:51 - enjoyable to play it just makes more
15:54 - sense so sometimes you just have to get
15:57 - the boring stuff done and just get the
16:00 - fixes out of the way so you can continue
16:02 - adding new stuff in the next video I
16:05 - think we'll delve into some character
16:07 - animation and then hopefully we'll soon
16:10 - get on to some shooting so that's going
16:13 - to be really awesome so thanks for
16:15 - watching again if you want more updates
16:17 - on when I post videos and what I'm
16:21 - working on and all that cool stuff you
16:23 - can follow me on twitter at Braca street
16:25 - or find me on facebook at facebook.com
16:28 - slash brakus so that was basically it
16:32 - for today thanks for watching and I'll
16:34 - see you in the next video
