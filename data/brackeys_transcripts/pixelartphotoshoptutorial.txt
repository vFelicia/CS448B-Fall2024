00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello
00:04 - everyone and welcome to this Photoshop
00:06 - tutorial today we are going to be taking
00:08 - a look at pixel art so configuring
00:10 - Photoshop to easily create a pixel art
00:14 - configuring a grid all that kind of neat
00:17 - stuff not so much in the drawing
00:21 - technique but more in how to actually
00:22 - make pixel art in Photoshop and we're
00:26 - going to be making a small coin and the
00:28 - reason why I'm suddenly making Photoshop
00:30 - tutorials is because unity the game
00:33 - making tool is soon coming up with some
00:35 - awesome 2d features and so I thought I
00:38 - would prepare you guys on how to create
00:40 - 2d acids for when I'm going to start
00:43 - making tutorials for the 2d games so
00:45 - that's going to be really awesome but
00:47 - this can also be used for many other
00:49 - things great so let's open up Photoshop
00:53 - and first off let's go ahead and make a
00:55 - new document so go to file new or press
00:59 - ctrl n you're going to rename this to
01:01 - coin and go to custom set the width to
01:06 - 20 pixels the height to 20 pixels the
01:10 - resolution is fine at 72 and the rest we
01:13 - are just going to ignore so let hits
01:15 - let's hit OK and zoom a bit in on the
01:19 - white background here and you know
01:22 - whenever you Photoshop makes a
01:24 - background for us it's locked meaning
01:27 - that we cannot edit it so to unlock this
01:30 - layer we can go over here on the right
01:32 - hand side let's this background and
01:34 - double click it and now we get to give
01:37 - it a name let's just call it BG and hit
01:40 - OK so now we can actually edit this
01:42 - layer now let's set up you photoshop so
01:46 - we can make our pixel art first off what
01:49 - we are going to be using are three basic
01:51 - tools the first of which is the pen tool
01:54 - you get this by going over here on the
01:57 - left hand side to where the brush tool
01:59 - is holding down on it and selecting the
02:02 - pencil now it's very important that you
02:06 - use the pencil tool and not the brush
02:08 - tool or we will not get the pixel effect
02:12 - then go up here make sure the size is
02:15 - set to one pixel and the hardness is set
02:18 - to 100 what we also need to do is go on
02:22 - to the eraser when we need to erase
02:24 - things select that and go up here where
02:27 - it says brush and set the mode to pencil
02:30 - instead so this will make sure that we
02:32 - erase with a hard pencil and again set
02:36 - the size of this to 1 and the hardness
02:39 - to 100 so now you can see we get this
02:42 - pixel and the last thing is of course
02:45 - the the Paint Bucket tool which we can
02:50 - just leave as is great so basically what
02:54 - we're going to do now is we are going to
02:56 - set up a grid so we can see what pixels
02:58 - we can paint on so go to view show and
03:03 - make sure that grid is selected but we
03:06 - will also need to change the way the
03:09 - grid is set up because right now it's
03:11 - drawing a grid that is the size of the
03:15 - screen and we want to we wanted to draw
03:18 - a grid with the size of 1 pixel so let's
03:22 - go to edit preferences guides grids and
03:28 - slices and here we can set the grid line
03:31 - to be every pixel and then make sure
03:34 - it's one-to-one and now it should be
03:40 - working so if we select our brush tool
03:42 - and start painting you can see that it
03:46 - paints on to each of these pixels so we
03:48 - have an idea of where to paint and of
03:51 - course you can enable and disable this
03:53 - by going to view show grid great so now
03:58 - that we have gotten this far we need to
04:01 - do one more adjustment and that is going
04:03 - to edit preferences general and up here
04:07 - where it says image interpolation we
04:10 - need to change this to nearest neighbor
04:11 - that this means that Photoshop will make
04:15 - sure that when we have hard edges it
04:18 - won't blow them to make them look a
04:20 - higher resolution we want that pixely
04:22 - harsh edge type look so let's select
04:25 - nearest neighbor and finally hit okay
04:28 - and we can start painting so let's just
04:31 - go to the bucket tool I'll select it
04:33 - with the G key change the color in the
04:36 - right-hand side to something more
04:39 - neutral like gray just so we have
04:41 - something more neutral to paint on then
04:43 - make a new layer down here in the right
04:45 - hand side create a new layer and select
04:49 - the pencil tool or again press B and the
04:53 - color we are going to be going after is
04:55 - something orange yellowish so a pretty
04:59 - saturated color is something like this
05:01 - and now we can simply start painting
05:04 - away so I'm going to make a square here
05:06 - I'm going to paint onto that whoops
05:09 - like this just keep on painting and we
05:16 - might make an even larger here and then
05:19 - I'm just going to round it off a bit to
05:21 - make it look more like a coin so go like
05:25 - this and like this and let's see if we
05:31 - can get this to look just right and it's
05:39 - starting to shape up and I think this is
05:41 - pretty great so okay so now it's looking
05:43 - like a round shape but to make it look a
05:46 - little more 3-dimensional I know you
05:49 - really can't win its pixel art but let's
05:52 - make it look a little more 3-dimensional
05:54 - go select a little brighter of a yellow
05:58 - core color not so saturated and let's
06:01 - make just a square of three pixels or
06:04 - four pixels here to give it that glowy
06:07 - kind of look so we we have some light
06:09 - actually shining upon it now I'll
06:13 - actually want to disable the gridlines
06:15 - to see how this looks so go to view show
06:18 - grid and select off and this is looking
06:21 - pretty great already what we can do now
06:23 - is we can double click it on the layer
06:25 - here to bring up all of the layer styles
06:29 - and in here we can add we're very simple
06:32 - effects such as a glow effect which is
06:36 - really great so let's go down here to
06:37 - outer glow
06:39 - and hit the checkmark and select it and
06:41 - first off we have a bunch of settings
06:44 - but here go to the color and let's just
06:47 - use the color picker tool to make it as
06:50 - the same as the coin itself so just
06:53 - press the coin and hit OK and now we can
06:56 - adjust the size of this just to how we
07:00 - want it I think that there looks pretty
07:03 - great somewhere around there there and
07:08 - then bring down the opacity because we
07:11 - don't want it to be that much of an
07:12 - effect or something like 60 and hit OK
07:15 - and we can zoom out and see how our
07:17 - creation looks so far I think it looks
07:20 - pretty great so what we can do now is we
07:23 - can trim we can trim this window so that
07:27 - we won't get all of this gray space so
07:30 - we are going to first off Rini rename
07:33 - this to coin and then we are going to
07:36 - disable the BG layer go to edit no image
07:42 - trim and then select transparent pixels
07:46 - and select okay and now the image has
07:48 - been trimmed to the pixels drawn so we
07:51 - won't get all of this empty space now we
07:54 - can turn back on the BG and see how it
07:57 - looks fairly simple texture but it's
08:00 - going to do fine when we import it into
08:02 - unity so what we can do now is we can
08:05 - again disable the BG layer go to file
08:08 - save as let's just save it on the
08:12 - desktop and as a PNG so select PNG and
08:17 - just hit save and now we have created
08:20 - our first pixel art sprites so we can
08:23 - see it here we can double click it to
08:26 - open it up in Windows Photo Viewer and
08:28 - there we have it so it's ready for
08:31 - importing into a game or using in some
08:33 - concept art whatever you want to do ok
08:37 - so that's pretty much the ending of this
08:39 - video to those of you interested in the
08:41 - new 2d tutorials just hang around for a
