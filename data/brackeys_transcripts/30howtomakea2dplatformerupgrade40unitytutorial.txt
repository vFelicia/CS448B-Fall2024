00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello
00:04 - everyone and welcome to the last video
00:05 - where we're going to be focusing on our
00:07 - upgrade menu within a 2d platformer
00:09 - course so today we are going to be
00:11 - finishing off the system by adding some
00:13 - audio to it we are also going to be
00:15 - adding a way for us to actually spend
00:17 - money and we are also going to be adding
00:20 - a way for us to earn money by killing
00:22 - enemies so they will have some kind of
00:24 - money drop so that's going to be very
00:26 - exciting but we'll actually start off by
00:29 - fixing a small bug with our enemies
00:32 - still spawning whenever we have the
00:34 - upgrade menu open so that's the first
00:36 - thing we are going to do also if you
00:38 - haven't seen the latest videos I've
00:40 - published
00:41 - I'm non patron I've gone full time with
00:43 - brackets so if you want to support me in
00:46 - making these videos along with the other
00:48 - courses you can go there and donate any
00:50 - monthly amount and it really helps out a
00:54 - lot so check that out if you want to and
00:56 - without further ado let's dig right into
00:58 - today's video so you can see that I'm
01:00 - pure unity and the first thing that I
01:02 - want to do is go to our armed UI overlay
01:06 - and then upgrade menu and double click
01:08 - this to open it up in visual studio and
01:11 - basically we've already implemented this
01:14 - static int variable that sits on our
01:16 - game master object that stores our
01:18 - current amount of money so all we need
01:20 - to do within this here is simply edit
01:22 - that amount so under our upgrade health
01:25 - and upgrade speed which are called
01:26 - whenever we press the two buttons we
01:29 - will simply go in and say money or a
01:32 - game master dot money and then subtract
01:36 - that by some amount and this amount I
01:38 - want to be specified by a variable up
01:40 - here you can of course have different
01:42 - amounts depending on what you want to
01:44 - upgrade but in our sake for simplicity
01:47 - I'm just going to have one fixed amount
01:48 - you can make multiple variables if
01:50 - that's something you desire so I'm going
01:52 - just going to have a private int which
01:54 - is going to be the upgrade cost and set
01:56 - that to a default of 50 then we can go
01:59 - down here and say the amount we want to
02:02 - subtract is the actual upgrade cost and
02:05 - we can then duplicate this statement
02:07 - there to put it down here and now we're
02:11 - subtracting money and if we go into our
02:13 - game
02:13 - year we can actually see that this
02:16 - should work so if I press you here and
02:19 - now I'm just going to wait a second
02:21 - because you can see down here it says
02:23 - that if spawn some enemies and if we
02:24 - wait you can actually hear those hitting
02:27 - our player and that's definitely an
02:29 - issue and you can hear there that we
02:32 - died and we are now respawning so that's
02:34 - actually what I really wanted to fix
02:36 - before moving further with the upgrade
02:38 - menu however you can see that we've
02:40 - already made some progress now we can
02:42 - spend money but we can also go below
02:44 - zero so there's some stuff here that we
02:47 - need to clear up so let's just save this
02:49 - and leave the upgrade menu itself for
02:52 - just a moment and let's find the place
02:54 - in our game master code where we are
02:57 - enabling and disabling this upgrade menu
03:00 - so that we can enable and disable the
03:02 - wave spawner as well so if we open up
03:04 - our game master here and find the place
03:07 - that says toggle upgrade menu you can
03:10 - see here that we are toggling whether or
03:12 - not the upgrade menu objects should be
03:14 - active and then we are invoking a
03:16 - delegate method that will call a
03:18 - different bunch of different methods
03:20 - subscribe to that delicate and make sure
03:22 - that stuff like the enemies stop moving
03:25 - and on the player cannot shoot anymore
03:28 - or move anymore however this doesn't
03:31 - include enemies that have not yet been
03:33 - spawned and since enemies keep spawning
03:36 - well then they are going to move and
03:39 - then kill us while we're in pass mode
03:41 - and that's really annoying so what we
03:42 - want to do is simply add some kind of
03:44 - reference up here and this is going to
03:47 - be another serialized field oops
03:49 - didn't meant to delete that so this is
03:51 - going to be another serialized field and
03:53 - we can call this a private and let's
03:56 - just make it a let's make it a game
03:59 - object actually let's just do the wave
04:02 - spawner here so a private wave spawner
04:05 - and we're just going to call this one
04:06 - wave spawner and we can take this here
04:09 - and put it down here on a new line and
04:13 - set wave spawner dot enable to be equal
04:16 - to the opposite of our current act of
04:19 - grade men use active self so if our
04:22 - upgrade menu is enabled we want our wave
04:25 - spawner to be disabled and
04:27 - in the same the other way around so
04:29 - let's try and save that and let's
04:31 - remember inside of unity to actually
04:34 - drag in the wave spawner we could also
04:35 - use getcomponent but these might sit on
04:38 - different objects so it's good just to
04:40 - do this it's very simple and when we hit
04:42 - play now and we press upgrade here you
04:46 - can see that our wave spawner gets
04:48 - disabled and nothing is happening in the
04:50 - background and when I now press this
04:51 - again you can see continues counting
04:53 - from where it left off that is however a
04:56 - smaller problem with this and that is if
04:58 - we are so unlucky as to pause right when
05:02 - the wave has started spawning but it um
05:06 - and and the countdown timer has reached
05:09 - zero well then it will actually continue
05:11 - you can see here if I pause right now
05:15 - actually that was a big too quick so
05:17 - right now you can see it spawns an enemy
05:20 - why I'm in the upgrade menu and the
05:21 - reason for this is that disabling an
05:24 - object will not stop if I just find our
05:27 - wave spawner here this labeling an
05:30 - object will not spawn or stop any
05:33 - corrode teens that is currently going on
05:35 - that object and that's what we have here
05:37 - we have this Kuro teen with a for loop
05:40 - that simply yields and waits for a
05:43 - certain amount of seconds between
05:44 - spawning each enemy and you might go in
05:47 - here and add some custom code that
05:49 - checks whether or not it should spawn an
05:52 - enemy and if it shouldn't it might
05:54 - either just wait or add it to some queue
05:57 - that is then spawned in afterwards but I
06:00 - think that would be too much for this
06:02 - video right now I've just showed you
06:03 - what kind of problem we have going on
06:06 - here and I think it would be a great
06:07 - challenge for you to solve that on your
06:10 - own if you can figure it out I
06:11 - definitely recommend you check out the
06:13 - forum that's definitely going to be a
06:16 - thread on there explaining how to do
06:18 - this stuff so without further ado let's
06:20 - continue with our upgrade menu now that
06:23 - we've fixed this issue so let's save
06:27 - this and on let's find our create menu
06:30 - again and we are now subtracting money
06:32 - however we are actually able to spend
06:34 - money that we don't have it's almost
06:36 - like real life right so
06:39 - can go up here we can add an if
06:40 - statement that says if our current
06:43 - amount of money which is gamemaster done
06:45 - money is less than the upgrade cost well
06:49 - then we shouldn't be able to spend
06:51 - anything so we are going to hit return
06:52 - and right above that we are going to add
06:55 - in some kind of sound that's there's
06:58 - something about the money not being
07:01 - there you could say need more money or
07:03 - anything have a voiceover it could just
07:05 - make some kind of sound that gives off
07:08 - the impression that something isn't
07:09 - working so that's what we're going to do
07:12 - here and let's actually add in these
07:14 - sounds right now so I'm going to call
07:17 - our audio manager here dot instance and
07:22 - then dot play sound and remember we've
07:25 - done this a lot of times before in some
07:28 - of the earlier videos and this audio
07:30 - manager we of course made ourselves and
07:32 - we know that it takes in a string with
07:34 - the name of the audio sound that we want
07:36 - to display or it to be played of course
07:39 - and I'm going to we haven't made this
07:42 - sound yet but I'm going to call this ah
07:44 - no money and then we can also play a
07:48 - sound for when we are successful so on
07:51 - upgrade complete we can call this one or
07:55 - we could just call it something like
07:58 - money actually let's just call this one
08:03 - money and then we'll have some kind of
08:04 - generic sound you could also call it
08:06 - bonus or upgrade or something but we're
08:09 - actually going to have the same sound
08:10 - played for when we upgrade and for when
08:13 - we gain money from an enemy so let's
08:15 - just call that one money and we can do
08:18 - the same down here so we can add the if
08:20 - statement down here like that and we can
08:23 - actually add the money sound as well and
08:27 - now we can go into unity and we can find
08:30 - our audio manager and we can add two new
08:32 - slots here and the first one is going to
08:35 - be um no money and the second one is
08:39 - going to be money and then we can find
08:42 - some audio clips that we want to use on
08:44 - your audio folder and if there isn't one
08:47 - that you would like to use you can go
08:49 - ahead and find our to see 2d assets pack
08:51 - which is downloadable
08:53 - from practice calm and you can go on the
08:55 - audio and find the bonus and click audio
09:00 - files I really liked those two and let's
09:02 - drag those under unity here and we can
09:05 - just preview them quickly so this is a
09:07 - bonus so and this is our click so our
09:12 - bonus is going to be the money sound and
09:15 - you don't need to rename these and our
09:17 - click is going to be the no money sound
09:19 - so if we have our audio manager we can
09:23 - drag the no money under no money and the
09:26 - money under money and then we can maybe
09:29 - turn down the volume just a bit on these
09:32 - sounds especially on the money sound
09:34 - that's a bit loud and you don't want
09:35 - this to be too crazy and you can of
09:38 - course adjust the pitch randomness and
09:40 - all that so that's going to be fine for
09:41 - now
09:42 - and on that should indeed be working so
09:45 - if we hit play here bring up the upgrade
09:47 - menu and upgrade we are going to hear
09:51 - that going up and our money is not zero
09:53 - so now we are going to be hearing the
09:55 - known money sound great so that is
09:59 - working and we should see actually that
10:01 - when we spend some money and then go out
10:05 - of this view the money our amount here
10:08 - will have updated as well and what we
10:11 - can do now is simply allow us to gain
10:13 - some money from the enemy so we'll add
10:16 - some kind of money drop so if we find
10:18 - our our enemy script on the scripts and
10:23 - then enemy double-click to open this up
10:26 - we're going to add a new variable here
10:28 - just like we have the public string
10:30 - death sound name we're also going to
10:32 - have a public end which is going to be
10:35 - the money drop and I'm going to set that
10:38 - as a default to ten and you can of
10:41 - course randomize this and then we can go
10:43 - on to the GM object on our game master
10:46 - and we can find the place that says kill
10:50 - enemy here and we want of course the
10:52 - local kill enemy and it takes in an
10:55 - enemy so why not use the money drop on
10:58 - that enemy you could of course just have
10:59 - hard-coded the value in here but instead
11:02 - I'm going to say money
11:05 - plus equals and then enemy dot money
11:09 - drop and this way different enemies can
11:11 - drop different amounts of money which is
11:13 - definitely something that you want to do
11:15 - for your game
11:16 - remember again I'm just using a single
11:19 - enemy because I don't have time in this
11:21 - tutorial to sit here and play around
11:23 - with different enemies that stuff yet
11:24 - that you can play around with yourself
11:27 - and that I definitely recommend you play
11:29 - around with yourself but on the idea is
11:32 - here so the infrastructure is right
11:35 - there for you to use so we're going to
11:36 - gain some money and we are going to do
11:41 - this with of course a sound so we're
11:43 - going to have our audio manager and we
11:45 - actually have a reference to it here so
11:47 - we don't need to do that instance or
11:48 - anything and then dot play sound and the
11:51 - sound that we want to play is money and
11:53 - again I'm hard coding this in if you
11:55 - want to be really really clean in your
12:00 - code you should make a varial for it
12:02 - above but this is what happens you you
12:05 - are really clean with all your code and
12:08 - then you get into the project and you
12:10 - start being a bit more messy but that's
12:12 - alright so let's say that and let's
12:14 - clear the lock here and the scripts and
12:17 - everything looks great let's hit apply
12:19 - in the GM object we haven't done that in
12:20 - quite a while and I actually also want
12:23 - to bring up the health regen rate to
12:25 - something a lot higher and let's
12:27 - actually hit play now and I actually
12:31 - want to do this in full-screen mode
12:33 - so play and we can move around here and
12:38 - some enemies spawn in and we should see
12:41 - that when we kill these enemies we can
12:43 - hear the sound and it the money amount
12:45 - goes up by 10 for each enemy so in our
12:48 - case that was 20 and we can kill some
12:51 - more in these
12:52 - I'm going to try not die here and you
12:56 - can see here is the upgrade menu and I'm
12:58 - now able to upgrade my character but not
13:01 - below the amount of zero there so there
13:03 - we go and that's basically on the last
13:06 - part of our upgrade system you should
13:09 - definitely go ahead and add more
13:10 - properties for the player upgrade you
13:13 - should definitely go ahead and actually
13:15 - we can just do that so on a UI overlay
13:17 - and our upgrade menu I just want to add
13:20 - the core the cost of the upgrade to the
13:22 - text here so just select the two text
13:24 - object and add a parentheses and then 50
13:27 - and you can of course fetch that from
13:29 - the script if you want to you can insert
13:31 - that by simply reference referencing the
13:35 - text object and then changing the text
13:37 - but since it's just a two buttons and a
13:39 - single value we can just change that by
13:41 - hand so now it states that more clearly
13:44 - but play around with this system add
13:46 - more enemies add more waves at different
13:49 - possibilities for spending money and
13:51 - this game should already be a lot of fun
13:53 - to play so that was basically it for
13:56 - this video I think we are coming near
13:58 - the end of this series I still have a
14:00 - few things I want to show you so I'm
14:03 - excited for on getting this finds in the
14:06 - series if you have any things that
14:07 - you're dying to see please let me know
14:09 - and without further ado thanks for
14:11 - watching this video and I'll see you in
14:13 - the next one so I'm going to start
14:15 - mentioning patreon supporters the
14:16 - following month after they donate so
14:18 - that there won't be any difference from
14:20 - donating at the beginning of the month
14:22 - to the end of the month this way
