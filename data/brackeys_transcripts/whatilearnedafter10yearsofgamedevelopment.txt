00:00 - I've been making video games for around
00:01 - 10 years now 10 years and at the time of
00:05 - making this video I've worked with many
00:07 - different game engines created several
00:08 - hundred different unity projects
00:10 - participated in ten game jams and made
00:12 - over 400 videos on the subject so I'm
00:14 - not exactly new in the game pun intended
00:17 - and I think it's fair to say that I
00:18 - should have learned a few things by now
00:20 - at least I should so in this video we'll
00:27 - take a look at my game development
00:29 - journey and see if there's anything we
00:30 - can learn from it or you can just laugh
00:32 - at my mistakes it's up to you but first
00:34 - this video is sponsored by hosting er
00:36 - during my years in game development I've
00:38 - often had to set up different web pages
00:39 - for many different purposes I've even
00:42 - tried programming one from scratch and
00:44 - hosting it on my own but boy oh boy is
00:46 - that a lot of work this is why hosting
00:48 - are such a great solution for all your
00:50 - web hosting needs they're extremely fast
00:52 - very affordable and just so easy to set
00:54 - everything up with and most important of
00:56 - all they take care of all the backend
00:57 - for you with hosting or you can set up
00:59 - your own domain get VPS hosting and they
01:01 - even offer cloud hosting plans which is
01:03 - just great for storing game and use the
01:05 - data we have personally set up a website
01:07 - with them and everything just runs very
01:09 - smooth get 15% off for all web hosting
01:11 - plans using coupon code break ease and
01:13 - get a domain included with any premium
01:15 - plan simply click the link in the
01:16 - description and get started also we have
01:18 - a really exciting announcement later in
01:20 - this video so stay tuned I think you'll
01:23 - really like it
01:23 - so when I first started out I was using
01:25 - blender yes blender has a game engine
01:28 - and back then it was actually pretty
01:29 - popular in the community the main reason
01:31 - being that it had a simple visual
01:33 - scripting solution I made my first games
01:35 - without touching a single line of code
01:37 - just using this here's my very first one
01:40 - it's split screen physics based shooter
01:42 - I think it's fun to go back and see just
01:44 - how little has actually changed I'm
01:46 - still in love with rigid body physics
01:48 - and I love the games I make now are
01:50 - based around local multiplayer so after
01:52 - using blender for a while I noticed a
01:54 - new interesting engine pop up it had
01:56 - been around for a while but was only
01:57 - starting to gain more for following I'm
01:59 - of course talking about unity so teamed
02:01 - up with some friends and we decided that
02:03 - together we would make a game using
02:04 - unity it was called awake an atmosphere
02:07 - based horror platformer similar to that
02:09 - of limbo which was new at the time so we
02:12 - got started creating game design
02:13 - documents art assets and I was learning
02:15 - unity following the few tutorials that
02:17 - were available back then however despite
02:19 - our best efforts we didn't get past the
02:21 - first half of the first level and of
02:23 - course instead of learning from our
02:24 - mistakes we drew up an even more complex
02:27 - idea a game where the player gets to
02:29 - create his own levels and shared them
02:30 - with others the title of the project was
02:33 - your game and this time we got further
02:35 - our 3d artist created a cool character I
02:37 - started to get into programming in
02:39 - c-sharp and making icons in Photoshop we
02:42 - created UI for the game with a bunch of
02:43 - cool assets and overall we felt much
02:45 - more confident of course it failed just
02:47 - as hard as the first one but that wasn't
02:49 - important because we were getting better
02:51 - in fact I was feeling confident enough
02:53 - to try and program my own game so I
02:55 - created kill pill be fast paced FPS that
02:58 - challenges to play to stay alive as long
02:59 - as possible
03:00 - shortly after that I followed up with
03:02 - the sequel kill pill tropic Island yes I
03:05 - misspelled tropical however this game
03:07 - had nicer graphics even though there
03:08 - overexposed here for some reason a more
03:10 - condensed map and power-ups after having
03:13 - spent a lot of time on projects that
03:15 - never got finished it was incredibly
03:17 - satisfying to see these two games
03:18 - complete and it taught me my first
03:20 - important lesson don't try to make
03:22 - everything perfect in the beginning
03:24 - you're a beginner it won't be instead I
03:26 - recommend trying out different things
03:27 - and mixing things up for me this helped
03:30 - me figure out what parts of the process
03:31 - I like and what I don't and this was
03:33 - around the time when I started making
03:35 - videos uploaded my first video December
03:37 - 25th 2012 hello welcome to the first
03:41 - tutorial done by Brian Jones it was the
03:43 - first of many on making a survival game
03:45 - in unity and holy wow did I improve a
03:47 - lot from making them and he should think
03:49 - that I'd learned my lesson by now and
03:50 - chosen a project that I could
03:52 - realistically finish however even after
03:54 - 37 videos the game was nowhere near
03:56 - complete and I decided to move on this
03:59 - time more determined than ever to finish
04:01 - a project I created to make a game begin
04:03 - a course where we would create a ball
04:05 - rolling game not the most exciting thing
04:07 - in the world but I finished it with only
04:09 - 27 videos alongside the videos I worked
04:12 - on a variety of projects I created a
04:14 - free inventory system and published it
04:16 - on the unity asset store later I made
04:18 - another editor extension for drawing
04:20 - pixel art inside the unity editor it's
04:22 - still in the asset store today but it
04:23 - hasn't been updated in quite a while but
04:25 - for every project I finish
04:27 - and published in this way there were at
04:29 - least ten projects that I scrapped after
04:31 - just a few days or weeks some were just
04:33 - quick tests where would try out a
04:35 - certain feature I experimented with stub
04:37 - motion stick-figure ragdolls swarm
04:40 - simulation voxel terrain generation RTS
04:43 - style unit movement and even space
04:45 - simulation just to name a few and each
04:47 - time I got just a little bit better at a
04:49 - certain task and a lot better at
04:51 - troubleshooting other projects were more
04:54 - serious for example I created a 2d
04:56 - puzzle platformer called squid soul I
04:58 - was really proud of this project and
04:59 - actually managed to create quite a few
05:01 - levels unfortunately I lost a huge
05:03 - amount of progress to corrupted project
05:05 - files which caused me to drop it
05:07 - lesson learned make backups I also
05:09 - created and finished a top-down shooter
05:11 - called wave incoming together with a
05:13 - friend of mine he made the art and I
05:15 - implemented everything in unity
05:16 - the game was simple but we managed to
05:18 - implement multiple characters a settings
05:20 - menu and a shop where you could upgrade
05:21 - your character some of you might know
05:23 - that I'm a huge fan of Gary smart and
05:25 - that it's one of the main reasons why I
05:27 - decided to try out game development that
05:29 - and Warcraft 3 World Editor of course
05:31 - and I've never understood why Gary smart
05:33 - was kind of the only game if you could
05:35 - call it that of its kind so I wanted to
05:37 - try recreating Carrie smart but with
05:39 - unity and I made three attempts at it
05:41 - first time I just had a few physics
05:43 - cubes that could be controlled by
05:44 - shooting different projectiles the
05:46 - second time I'd learned about UI and
05:48 - modeling so you could spawn in different
05:51 - objects manipulate them around and even
05:53 - put thrusters on them that could be
05:54 - assigned to a keyboard key the third
05:56 - time I'd learned a lot more about
05:58 - particle effects post-processing
05:59 - lighting and UI I got just about as far
06:03 - as the first time but this time at least
06:04 - everything looked much better and at
06:07 - this point I felt like trying something
06:08 - else have you ever done something really
06:11 - pointless in your life I have I tried
06:13 - making a game engine from scratch using
06:15 - C++ and this is how far god with this
06:18 - much code such safe to say that most of
06:21 - the projects were not only fairly
06:22 - ambitious they were also often clones of
06:24 - already existing games and most of the
06:27 - time I had to create projects that were
06:28 - built as examples to use in the videos
06:30 - which I couldn't just finish in a
06:32 - weekend this was the time that I
06:34 - discovered something that changed
06:36 - everything I participated in Ludum dare
06:38 - a 36
06:40 - Jemm where you get 48 hours to create a
06:41 - game from scratch the only goal to
06:44 - actually finish it for this Jam I
06:46 - created Dickon and I had an insane
06:48 - amount of fun not only was it incredibly
06:50 - satisfying to complete the game in time
06:52 - with graphics audio and programming it
06:55 - was also amazing to see other people
06:56 - play the game afterwards and get
06:58 - feedback and inspiration from other
06:59 - developers since then I've participated
07:01 - in a bunch of jams and created anything
07:04 - from stick figure games to racing games
07:05 - to crafting games games that require
07:07 - teamwork in games that require aim and
07:10 - talking about game jams earlier I
07:12 - mentioned that we have an exciting
07:13 - announcement we are hosting a community
07:15 - game jam it's a huge game Jam event that
07:22 - will take place over a week at the end
07:23 - of August and the cool thing is that
07:25 - it's not only organized by us it's
07:27 - something that we're doing together with
07:29 - a bunch of other cool guys so far psycho
07:31 - black thorn Pratt Danny and Jibril's are
07:34 - all helping put together this event and
07:36 - we'll all be participating with the
07:37 - purpose of showing how game development
07:39 - can bring people together across our
07:41 - different sub communities so if you are
07:43 - a content creator I really encourage you
07:45 - to make a video saying that you will be
07:46 - participating in the jam and encouraging
07:48 - others to do the same we will all be
07:50 - showing our process of working on our
07:52 - entries afterwards and I'm personally
07:53 - really looking forward to seeing how
07:55 - we're each going to be approaching the
07:56 - theme so regardless of who you are if
07:59 - your content credit or not if your ever
08:01 - participated in a jam or not or if
08:03 - you've even just picked up the hoppy I
08:05 - formally invite you to join us in the
08:06 - community game jam in fact black thorn
08:09 - prod has put together a short trailer
08:10 - for the event that I just have to show
08:12 - you so let's roll the footage a game jam
08:17 - paints until your brush breaks dream up
08:24 - ideas so great so you'll make people
08:26 - face cold like a maniac into the sky
08:30 - turns sound music just focus on having a
08:38 - ton of fun this Jam is organized by some
08:41 - of the top and game dev channels on
08:43 - YouTube with the goal of bringing the
08:45 - entire game dev community together the
08:48 - challenge is to make a whole game in
08:50 - just one week and it's coming up on the
08:53 - last week of August 2009 see so if
08:56 - you're interested make sure to join the
08:58 - jam or just learn more by using the link
09:00 - in the description also it's of course
09:01 - allowed and in fact I encourage you to
09:03 - join the jam as a team and special
09:06 - thanks to the practice discord staff for
09:07 - helping put everything together
09:09 - and with that said what have I learned
09:11 - after 10 years of game development well
09:13 - thing it's safe to say that I've worked
09:15 - on a lot of different projects and only
09:17 - managed to finish a few of them and
09:19 - while that might seem inefficient and
09:20 - frustrating I don't regret it one bit
09:23 - going through all these past projects
09:25 - have made me realize just how much I've
09:26 - learned from them and how proud I am of
09:28 - even the ones that never got past the
09:30 - first level I think it's pretty common
09:31 - advice in the game dev community to not
09:33 - start out with something too ambitious
09:35 - and in some regards I agree with this
09:37 - you can be incredibly hard to keep
09:39 - scrapping projects because of getting
09:40 - stuck or losing interest but at the same
09:43 - time I think it's pretty much
09:44 - unavoidable for beginners to take on too
09:46 - much simply because it's so hard to
09:48 - grasp what's easy to do and what's not
09:50 - and personally whether ended up
09:52 - scrapping a project or not I've always
09:54 - gotten better with everyone I think the
09:56 - most important thing is that you don't
09:57 - lose interest not in a single project
09:59 - but in game development in general
10:01 - because at the end of the day and that's
10:03 - you're really serious about game
10:04 - development and have turned it into a
10:05 - job it's all about having fun and
10:07 - challenging yourself especially when
10:09 - just starting out and whatever makes you
10:11 - go that could be fun to try I say go for
10:15 - it no matter if it's something you can
10:16 - realistically finish or not and if you
10:18 - find yourself having a hard time
10:19 - finishing things participate in a jam
10:21 - once in a while it's honestly my
10:23 - favorite part about being a developer
10:25 - and it just can't recommend it enough so
10:27 - sign up for the community Jam today no
10:29 - but seriously doesn't matter which
10:31 - just tried and just one other thing
10:34 - don't be afraid to ask questions or use
10:36 - Google for answers copying other
10:38 - people's code and modifying it is an
10:40 - amazing way to learn and it's something
10:42 - I've done so incredibly much in fact I
10:45 - think that half of being a good
10:46 - programmer is knowing how to Google and
10:48 - that's pretty much it for this video
10:50 - also I just want to let you know that we
10:52 - will be taking a bit of vacation time
10:53 - over the summer and so we're skipping
10:55 - the next two videos
10:56 - don't worry we'll of course be back on
10:58 - schedule and motivated as ever before
11:00 - long also don't forget to check out
11:01 - hosting out for fast web hosting
