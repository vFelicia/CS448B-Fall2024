00:00 - We're rolling? Awesome!
00:01 - Decals!
00:02 - Andreas gave me this for Christmas. *laughs* (nice)
00:05 - Decals are a great way to add a detail to your level and help tie everything together.
00:10 - You can think of decals like a projector that will overlay an image on top of a surface.
00:15 - This makes it super easy to add details like grunge, dirt, and different kinds of weathering.
00:20 - You can also use it while the game is running to create dynamic effects like bullet holes.
00:24 - So, today we will have a look at how to do all that.
00:26 - But first, this video is sponsored by Skillshare.
00:29 - Skillshare's an online learning community with more than 25,000 q u a l i t y classes on game development, tech, and more.

01:09 - Now before we get started, I just want to mention that Andreas and I were on a PODCAST!
01:13 - *Makes weird chicken noises and flaps wings* PO - PO - PO - PO - PO - PODCAST!
01:15 - *Laughs*
01:17 - The podcast is called Game Dev Unchained and the guys who make it are REALLY cool.
01:20 - And we had a lot of fun being on the show!
01:22 - So if you wanna learn a bit more about us and what goes on behind the scenes,
01:26 - definitely check it out using the link in the description.
01:28 - Alright! Let's jump right into decalification...ization(?)
01:32 - *Smiles awkwardly*
01:32 - of things. *awkwardness continues*
01:34 - So the first thing that we want to do is make sure that we're using the HD render pipeline.
01:37 - To do this, let's go edit -> project settings, and under graphics,
01:41 - We can check whether or not we have an "HDRenderPipelineAsset" configured.
01:46 - If not, you need to either set this up for a project, I'll make sure to have a link on how to do that in the description,
01:51 - and you can of course always create a new project with HDRP as the template.
01:56 - So once that's done, creating your first decal is actually insanely easy.
02:01 - Let's go to the hierarchy and right click and let's create a new rendering -> decal projector.
02:07 - And this is going to spawn this box structure into our scene.
02:11 - I'm just gonna move it over and place it on a piece of open ground here.
02:15 - And right now you can see not much is happening.
02:18 - That's because in order to display a decal, we need to create a material for that decal.
02:23 - So inside of our project, let's go create - and let's create a material.
02:27 - Let's name it something like "LogoDecal" and at the top here let's change the shader
02:32 - by going under HDRenderPipeline and selecting the decal shader.
02:36 - Now the decal shader is fairly simple.
02:39 - The options you're gonna be using the most is the base color, where we can input a texture,
02:43 - we can also input a normal map for that texture, and then we can adjust the opacity for our decal.
02:49 - Let's try and give it a texture here.
02:50 - So I've gone ahead and imported a few textures that we can play around with.
02:54 - One of them is the Brackeys logo, so I'm simply going to take this, and drag it into the base color slot.
03:00 - I'm also going to select our decal projector object, and now drag our local decal material into the material slot.
03:07 - And right away we can see that the Brackeys logo is being projected onto the ground surface.
03:11 - You'll notice that we have this wide arrow here which shows which way we are currently projecting onto the surface
03:18 - This means that, just like any other object, we can rotate our projector,
03:22 - and we see that we are now projecting this at an angle.
03:24 - We can also scale the projector to size it up and down,
03:27 - and we can do this individually on the different axes as well.
03:31 - And the cool thing is that if we go ahead and move this over other objects,
03:35 - we can see that it changes to fit onto these objects.
03:38 - And this applies to all objects in our scene.
03:41 - We can also project it onto the workbench here just as well.
03:44 - And if you want your decal to be more visible, we can of course adjust the opacity.
03:49 - To do this we go under the material, and we can just do that from here, and adjust the global opacity.
03:55 - And you can see just what an effect that has.
03:57 - We can also see that if we move this over now, its not showing on our ground
04:02 - That's because our ground is not within this box.
04:05 - If you want to show a decal on an object, you need to make sure that it's within this bounding box.
04:10 - So, we could either go ahead and stretch it on the y (axis) to make it actually appear,
04:15 - Or we could move our decal down, which has the same effect.
04:18 - So now that we know how to insert decals into our scene,
04:21 - Let's have a look at how this can be useful.
04:22 - So, if we go ahead and ignore our local decal here and create another decal projector,
04:28 - so that's right click, go rendering -> decal projector.
04:31 - And let's call this something like "Dirt Decal."
04:34 - Of course we need again to create a new material for this, so we'll go to the project, hit create, go material.
04:38 - Let's call it "DirtDecal" as well.
04:41 - Again, we'll change the shader to HDRP, and decal.
04:45 - And now for this one, I'm going to input this dirt grunge texture that I found online
04:50 - Notice how in the preview here it's stretched, and also the transparent parts are currently black.
04:56 - D o n ' t   m i n d   t h i s   a t   a l l .
04:58 - If you wanna show transparency, you can check alpha is transparency and hit apply,
05:02 - but this is not at all needed for the decal.
05:05 - In fact if I go ahead and turn it off, and we then input it into our texture on the dirt decal here,
05:10 - and then go to our dirt decal projector and input the material into the material slot,
05:16 - well then we can see that it works just fine!
05:19 - The dirt decal is still right here.
05:20 - Let's go ahead and rotate it, and we can clearly see it!
05:23 - So I'm gonna go ahead and rotate this box here by 90 degrees to make this white arrow face towards our wall.
05:30 - So I'm going to hold down control to snap this, and now it's rotated by 90 degrees.
05:34 - We can move it over to our wall, and let's also scale this up a bit.
05:38 - We then move it up and place it where we want it to be on our wall.
05:42 - I think something like that looks pretty cool!
05:45 - We then of course go into our dirt decal material and adjust the opacity.
05:49 - So you can see just how easy it is to add grunge, dirt, and other kinds of weathering effects to your scene.
05:55 - These kinds of details can really help tie together objects where there are scenes,
05:59 - or to help break up tiling in your textures.
06:02 - It's just a really great tool for making your levels come together.
06:05 - But we can of course also create decals at runtime,
06:08 - which means that they're super useful for doing stuff like bullet holes.
06:11 - I've gone on and created this bullet hole scene, which is pretty much the same scene but without all the clutter,
06:16 - and I've placed a main camera that kind of faces this wall.
06:20 - On this main camera I have a shoot script, and if we open this up we can see that it's really simple.
06:26 - We simply check if the player presses the fire button, and if he does, we're going to call the fire method.
06:30 - Here we're going to cast out a ray from our cursor's current point on the screen,
06:34 - and if it hits something, we're going to instantiate a tiny hit effect.
06:39 - This is just some simple particles that I've created.
06:41 - So, just to demo this let's hit play *unity crashes*, and that was NOT supposed to happen *laughs*.
06:46 - *Pretends like nothing happened* So just to preview this let's go ahead and hit play.
06:49 - And as you can see, I can click on this wall here, or on the ground for that matter, the sphere,
06:54 - or these wooden planks, and it's going to spawn a tiny particle effect.
06:58 - However, we're not currently seeing any damage being done to these objects.
07:03 - In other words, we need to add bullet holes.
07:05 - So to do this, we are going to use the exact same method as before.
07:09 - Right click -> rendering -> decal projector
07:13 - We'll rename it to "Bullet Hole Decal," we'll create a new material for it
07:19 - so create -> material. Again, "Bullet Hole Decal," change the shader to HDRenderPipeline -> decal,
07:26 - and for the texture here I've gone ahead and found a bullet hole texture that we can use as well.
07:31 - So I'm simply going to throw that in there.
07:33 - When it comes to bullet holes, I definitely recommend using a normal map as well for the increased realism.
07:38 - However, since this is just to show the general idea, I haven't included one.
07:42 - Now let's select our projector and drag in our material,
07:46 - let's move up our projector here,
07:48 - And we can now see a HUGE bullet hole on our ground.
07:51 - Let's focus on this, and the first thing that we wanna do is probably scale it down.
07:56 - So I'm just gonna use the scale tool and make it quite a bit smaller.
07:59 - Something like that definitely seems more reasonable.
08:02 - We then go into our material and increase the global opacity.
08:05 - You could set this to 1, but I found that sometimes it's pretty good to just have a tiny bit of the background seeping through.
08:11 - So I'm gonna set mine 2.9.
08:13 - And that looks pretty decent.
08:15 - We then take this object and turn it into a prefab.
08:18 - So let's simply click and drag it into our project panel.
08:22 - And it's now a prefab.
08:23 - Let's remove it from our scene by hitting delete,
08:26 - and the only ting that's left to do is spawn this through script whenever we hit something.
08:31 - So let's go into our shooting script.
08:33 - And again this code is super simple.
08:35 - We cast out a ray, if that ray hits something, we'll go ahead and create a hit effect.
08:41 - So right underneath this line we can go ahead and create the bullet hole.
08:44 - And of course in order to instantiate it, we need to first reference it.
08:49 - So we'll go to the top here. Right under where it says "effectPrefab,"
08:52 - we'll create a public game object, and this one we'll call "decalPrefab."
08:56 - Then down here we can instantiate that decal prefab, and the position where we want to spawn it is going to
09:02 - be the same one as our effect, which is just the point that we hit.
09:06 - And remember, whenever you're working with raycasts like this, it's really easy to get some info
09:11 - about what you hit. And I've stored mine in this "hitInfo" variable.
09:15 - So I'll simply write: "hitInfo.point," which is the point that we hit,
09:19 - and then we need to give it a rotation. For this we'll use "Quaternion.FromToRotation,"
09:24 - which allows us to create a rotation from a certain direction to another direction.
09:30 - And the direction we want to give here is "Vector3.up," and the to direction is going to be "hitInfo.normal."
09:37 - If you don't exactly know how to visualize this, I completely understand.
09:42 - Visualizing directions and especially rotations can be quite difficult.
09:46 - Just know that we are doing this to make sure that our decal is going to point to the surface that we hit.
09:52 - If we hit this wall, for example, we want the decal to be rotated in such a way that the
09:57 - white arrow points towards this wall.
10:00 - And to do this, we're using the normal vector which
10:03 - is the arrow that points out from the given surface that we hit.
10:07 - I totally understand if that's a bit confusing, but it should work.
10:12 - So if we now go and save our script, go into Unity, select our main camera, we now have a decal prefab slot.
10:18 - And here we just drag in our bullet hole decal prefab.
10:22 - And now, when we play - and if we now go ahead and click on the wall here,
10:27 - you can see that it spawns both our hit effect as well as this bullet hole decal.
10:32 - Now the effect is definitely a bit exaggerated here - it's a bit to large - we could definitely shrink it.
10:38 - But it  i s  w o r k i n g .
10:39 - And we can go ahead and create as many of these as we'd like,
10:42 - and also hit around and it's going to work just as fine.
10:46 - We can do the same thing for our wooden planks over here,
10:48 - and notice how the decal even wraps on weird angles like this.
10:52 - And this is the really cool thing about using projectors for decal,
10:55 - is that it's going to actually wrap onto whatever you hit.
10:59 - So in the case that we have a curved surface like this - a sphere here, we can still do it safely -
11:06 - because it's simply going to project itself onto the surface of the sphere -
11:10 - which is great, because if we were just using a plane with a transparent texture,
11:15 - well then it would start to look really weird when we tried to put that plane on something that curved like a sphere.
11:23 - And right now it doesn't! So, awesome!
11:25 - And we can also see here why using a normal map for this will definitely be great
11:29 - because then we will have the light actually bend to show that there was a hole here.
11:34 - Right now it looks a bit too two dimensional.
11:36 - But that's just a matter of dragging in a normal map into the slot here.
11:41 - Awesome!
11:41 - That's pretty much it for this video!
