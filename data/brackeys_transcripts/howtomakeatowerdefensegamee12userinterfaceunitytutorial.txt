00:06 - thanks for tuning in at brac ease hello
00:11 - everyone and welcome to this video in
00:12 - creating a tower defense game in unity
00:13 - today we'll be working on the UI I have
00:16 - some really exciting stuff that I want
00:17 - to show and also some stuff that I
00:19 - really want to try out so we'll begin by
00:22 - editing the hover color for our nodes to
00:24 - reflect whether or not we have enough
00:25 - money to actually buy the turret we'll
00:27 - also be adding a arm money calendar
00:30 - which shows the current amount of money
00:32 - that we have along with the price for
00:34 - each turret and we'll also show the
00:36 - countdown timer in a bit different way
00:38 - that will look a lot cooler and finally
00:41 - we'll be adding some built turret
00:44 - particle effects so whenever we build a
00:46 - turret we want to have some kind of cool
00:49 - effect in there to show that something
00:51 - awesome has just happened so that is the
00:53 - plan for today and without further ado
00:55 - let's jump right into it
00:56 - so as you can see I've created a list or
00:58 - with the different things I want to do
00:59 - today and I want to begin by editing the
01:01 - hobby color for our notes so let's find
01:03 - our node script under scripts and then
01:05 - node and double click that to open it up
01:07 - in visual studio then scroll down to
01:09 - where we say on Mouse enter and you can
01:11 - see here that we edit the material color
01:13 - by going rent material color and setting
01:17 - it equal to hobby color all we really
01:19 - want to do here is create an if
01:21 - statement that checks whether or not our
01:23 - current amount of money is greater than
01:25 - or equal to the cost of the turret that
01:27 - we have selected and in case it's not we
01:29 - don't want to set it equal to hobby
01:30 - color we want to set it equal to some
01:32 - alarming color say just a red color
01:35 - indicating that we need to get more
01:37 - money before we can build there so um
01:39 - what I really want to do is I want to
01:42 - add this functionality into our build
01:44 - manager because our build manager is the
01:46 - one who takes care of what we want to
01:48 - build next and therefore knows the cost
01:50 - of that turret so let's find our build
01:52 - manager again under scripts and open
01:54 - that up as well and you can see here
01:56 - that we've already created a property
01:58 - called can build let's just create
02:00 - another property called has money and
02:02 - it's simply a boolean check here so
02:05 - let's just duplicate that and let's
02:07 - rename this to has money and instead of
02:10 - returning whether or not we have
02:11 - something to build
02:13 - let's return whether or not player stats
02:16 - dot money is greater than or equal to
02:18 - deterred to builds cost there we go
02:22 - so if we don't have enough money this is
02:25 - going to return false and if we do have
02:27 - enough money or more money it's going to
02:29 - return true so what we can do is simply
02:32 - use this inside of our node so we can go
02:34 - if and then we can say build manager dot
02:37 - um has money then we want to set rent
02:45 - material dark color equal to have a
02:47 - color and in case it has not so let's
02:49 - create an else statement here then we
02:52 - can say R in material dark color equals
02:56 - to say colored red or we can create
02:58 - another variable for this so not enough
03:00 - on money color for example I can name it
03:06 - whatever you want let's go up here and
03:08 - actually create this variable so public
03:11 - color and we'll just call this the not
03:14 - enough money color then what we can do
03:16 - is we can hit inside of unity we can
03:18 - find a node prefab here and we can edit
03:21 - this color so let's make sure to set the
03:23 - alpha all the way up and set it to some
03:25 - kind of red color now you should see
03:28 - them if we hit play and place a few
03:30 - turrets you can see it's normal now
03:32 - until we don't have any more money and
03:35 - then it turns red indicating that we
03:37 - can't build there anymore so on that is
03:40 - all I wanted to do with the hover over
03:42 - color and you can definitely do more
03:44 - with that if you want to so we can
03:47 - scratch that off the list next up is our
03:51 - countdown plus money counter so the
03:53 - countdown is up here but I don't think
03:55 - it looks very good and also we don't
03:57 - have any way to display our current
03:59 - among amount of money so what I really
04:01 - wanted to do is first off go ahead and
04:03 - find a new fund on the web so let's go
04:06 - here open up our browser and let's go
04:09 - Google Fonts and what I'm going to be
04:12 - using here is the one called Roboto it's
04:14 - a very used fund I believe it's
04:17 - developed by Google actually and if we
04:19 - select this fund you can see it says
04:22 - family selected and then you could go
04:23 - here and press the download button which
04:26 - is going to die
04:27 - unload and zip file containing all of
04:29 - the different things that we want you
04:32 - can see there is a black black italic
04:34 - bold and so forth so on and so far and
04:37 - so on and then we simply extract all of
04:40 - this so we use extracted into a folder
04:43 - and then you can select all of the fonts
04:45 - you don't need to include the license
04:47 - and then we can go into unity here and
04:49 - create a new folder called fonts and
04:52 - then we can just click and drag all of
04:55 - these funds in there you can of course
04:58 - find your own fonts if you don't want to
05:00 - use these you can also jump on the asset
05:01 - story there are three ones and some paid
05:03 - ones as always yeah it's really as easy
05:06 - as that but unity should definitely
05:08 - accept most TTF files so if you find a
05:11 - font with that format you can just
05:14 - include it of course make sure that it's
05:16 - not copyrighted in some way so what we
05:19 - can then do is we can simply use this
05:22 - inside of the editor now and the idea
05:24 - that I had is instead of just overlaying
05:27 - the UI like this when it comes to
05:29 - displaying text let's have the text be
05:32 - part of the scene so let's have the
05:33 - numbers be shown down here at the bottom
05:36 - of our map and we can also have things
05:37 - on the side and on the top if we want to
05:39 - and then we can um as we pan the camera
05:43 - around and zoom in and stuff this zoom
05:45 - the text will follow those are
05:47 - transforms so I think that would look
05:50 - pretty cool with this kind of
05:52 - minimalistic square setup so let's find
05:54 - our canvas here and just disable our
05:56 - wave countdown timer for now so that it
05:58 - won't get in the way let's then create a
06:00 - new canvas by going UI and then canvas
06:03 - and let's change the render mode here
06:06 - from screen space overlay to world space
06:09 - what we can then do is we can um play
06:13 - around with this a bit because if you
06:15 - are going to t2d mode and focus on this
06:17 - it's freaking huge so we need to
06:20 - definitely scale this down so let's do a
06:22 - scale of point zero five point zero five
06:25 - and point zero five and that's
06:27 - definitely better let's then on center
06:30 - the X&Y so zero zero zero there we go
06:34 - and we can go out of 2d mode now let's
06:37 - then rotate it 90 degrees on the X
06:40 - find the rotation can go 90 on the X and
06:44 - we can then move it down here so that we
06:48 - will have it right at the bottom of our
06:51 - map and move it over and then we can
06:54 - switch to use the 2d tools here of the
06:56 - rectangle tool and we can then scale it
06:58 - out here so it fits the entire bottom of
07:01 - our map something like that looks pretty
07:03 - nice and we can maybe scale it up here
07:06 - so that um we don't go too far off the
07:10 - screen and then we can add some text
07:11 - elements to it so we can right click
07:13 - here go UI and then text and you can see
07:16 - that there is definitely some text here
07:17 - but it's very small and very grey so
07:20 - let's just um first off make the area
07:23 - here larger actually let's just make it
07:25 - fit the entirety of our canvas by
07:28 - descending when to stretch there hold
07:30 - down alt and press in the bottom right
07:33 - corner there and then we can bump up the
07:37 - font size and you can see now that our
07:38 - text appears let's make the color
07:40 - completely white and let's also go to
07:42 - fine font and that opens up the fun
07:46 - window and I want to go Roboto thin I
07:49 - think that looks super cool and then we
07:52 - can change this to say a dollar sign
07:55 - that's the Euro so a dollar sign and
07:58 - then some amount of money here so we'll
08:00 - have let's say 356 dollars here and I
08:08 - think that looks pretty neat already
08:10 - I want the font size to be around these
08:12 - 125 say um you can definitely make it
08:16 - bigger actually let's say 150 I actually
08:20 - like that better so I think that looks
08:22 - pretty nice and you can of course play
08:24 - around with that more than I do here and
08:26 - you can also maybe make it blend in with
08:28 - the environment a bit better here also
08:31 - maybe choose a color that isn't quite as
08:34 - wide but I actually think I like it
08:37 - completely white and then what we can do
08:39 - is we can add a shadow to this so just
08:41 - go add component search for shadow and
08:43 - we can add this with an effect distance
08:46 - of 5 and negative 5 and then we can
08:48 - maybe bump down the opacity on this just
08:51 - a bit so that will just make it blend a
08:53 - bit
08:53 - nicer and what you will notice now
08:55 - because our canvas is a world canvass is
08:58 - if we go in here and hit play now and
08:59 - zoom in you can see that it follows to
09:02 - transform of our camera and that makes
09:04 - it look super cool and very organic and
09:07 - part of the map so I really like that
09:10 - effect
09:11 - hmm scuse me cool so we can now rename
09:14 - this to our money and we can duplicate
09:17 - it and what I'll do is I'll snap this to
09:19 - the right corner here and we can have
09:21 - this be our time so you could definitely
09:23 - write time here or wave if you want to
09:27 - do that I'm just going to put in some
09:29 - number here which is just going to be
09:31 - nineteen point two five for example to
09:34 - indicate our current amount of seconds
09:36 - until the next wave but you can really
09:38 - style this in any way that you want to
09:40 - cool so um we can now rename this as
09:44 - well and call this our timer or our wave
09:47 - countdown timer if you want to be very
09:49 - specific so what we can do now is we can
09:51 - hook these two up to a script so first
09:54 - off if we find our canvas here wave
09:57 - countdown timer and delete that and then
10:00 - select our game master and go to wave
10:02 - spawner you can see that we have a wave
10:04 - countdown text and all we want to do is
10:06 - just drag our new timer object into that
10:09 - and that should actually update that for
10:12 - us but I don't think it's formatted very
10:15 - very well and by the way just ignore the
10:18 - warnings down here it's just a unity
10:20 - annoying bug it's it's nothing to worry
10:22 - about at all so let's double click on
10:25 - the wave spawner now and it's format
10:27 - this um text a bit better also let's set
10:29 - the time between waves to something more
10:31 - say 20 so let's find our update method
10:34 - here and you can see this is where we
10:36 - set wave countdown text and what I want
10:39 - to do is first off I want to do
10:41 - something that I should have done
10:42 - earlier which is clamping this value so
10:45 - I want to set countdown equal to math
10:48 - dot clamp between and I want to clamp
10:51 - countdown between 0 and math dot
10:55 - infinity just to make sure that no
10:57 - matter what countdown will not be less
10:59 - than zero and therefore a negative
11:01 - number and therefore show in some weird
11:03 - way and then when it comes to formatting
11:06 - this I actually
11:07 - want some tests decimal places so we're
11:09 - going to go string dot format and we're
11:11 - going to create a string here with the
11:13 - format and we do this by going 0
11:15 - indicating that the first variable that
11:18 - we put right after this one which is
11:20 - going to be comma our countdown so zero
11:23 - here represents our countdown we want to
11:26 - display that with the format of zero
11:28 - point zero zero actually I want to do
11:31 - see rows zero point zero zero so you
11:34 - will see what that does in a second and
11:36 - we can close that off with the curly
11:37 - brackets and remember to put a what is
11:42 - this a parenthesis closing parenthesis
11:45 - in there as well so let's save the wave
11:47 - spawning now and let's hit play and you
11:50 - should see that this is formatted in a
11:52 - very cool way where it get gets this
11:55 - very hectic dramatic effect where it
11:57 - counts down super quickly I really like
11:59 - that so that is now part of our map and
12:02 - I'm pretty satisfied with that so let's
12:05 - make sure to do the same with our money
12:07 - and we could of course add some kind of
12:10 - update method inside of our players
12:13 - stats or we could do it on the money
12:15 - itself and I'm just going to do it on
12:17 - the money itself so let's just do money
12:19 - UI add a new component here which is
12:22 - going to be c-sharp and all we need to
12:25 - do here is go in to the update method
12:28 - and we then want a reference to our D
12:31 - text object here and we can just either
12:33 - use get component or just reference it
12:36 - which we are going to do so let's make
12:38 - sure to import Unity engine that UI
12:41 - whenever we do anything with the UI
12:43 - let's make them let's make a public text
12:47 - variable with our money text and then
12:50 - all we need to do is set money
12:52 - text text equal to player stats dot
12:57 - money and we can do a two string on that
13:01 - and also make sure to put a dollar sign
13:04 - in front of that to make it look cool
13:07 - and make it very clear that this is our
13:09 - money
13:10 - so let's now hit play on this and you
13:12 - might say do we really need to update
13:14 - this every frame no we definitely do not
13:17 - but I think really doesn't matter
13:19 - because we're only changing
13:20 - one text variable and also it's
13:23 - canonized that the money updates are
13:25 - immediately after we change or after we
13:29 - kill an enemy or whatever or say
13:32 - spawning and turret so now we have the
13:34 - money text of course we need to
13:35 - reference that as well so let's just
13:37 - drag it in there
13:37 - notice I dragged in the game object you
13:39 - can also drag in the text component
13:41 - directly and now hit play and we should
13:43 - be error free except for those two
13:45 - annoying ones we can say it says 400
13:48 - here and if we now spend some money it's
13:50 - going to subtract from that so that's
13:53 - perfect and totally working cool so
13:57 - let's see what we have on the program on
14:00 - next so that was the countdown and money
14:03 - counter then we have a turret cost and
14:05 - this is actually going to be a fairly
14:07 - long video I hadn't expected that but I
14:09 - guess that's fine now some things that I
14:11 - also want to add is some kind of
14:13 - notification or toaster or toast or
14:17 - whatever is some way of displaying
14:18 - messages are for the user say when you
14:21 - are unable to build or win a new wave of
14:24 - has spawned so will definitely do
14:26 - something with that and yeah cool so
14:30 - let's continue with to the next thing
14:33 - which is turret cost so let's delete
14:35 - this from the list and add that and that
14:37 - is as easy as just adding a little bit
14:40 - of UI inside of our shop here so let's
14:43 - find our standard turret item and let's
14:46 - just delete the text here and instead
14:48 - let's go in and go UI and then let's go
14:53 - um panel there we go focusing on this
14:58 - switch to 2d mode let's now scale this
15:01 - panel down quite a bit something like
15:03 - that looks fine and let's drag this up
15:07 - just a bit position it where we want it
15:09 - I think that looks pretty good right
15:10 - there let's change the color of this on
15:13 - the to maybe use somewhat full opacity I
15:17 - want it to be kind of transparent
15:19 - actually and some blue color
15:22 - I think light blue something like that
15:24 - looks pretty nice and this is going to
15:26 - be the backdrop for our money amount so
15:28 - this is going to be our cut or our cost
15:31 - amount so this is going to be our cost
15:33 - gee and then we can right-click go UI
15:35 - text and this is going to be our cost or
15:38 - price or whatever you want to call it
15:40 - and here we want to change our font to
15:43 - Roboto I'm going to go with light I then
15:47 - want to coarse scale this to fit our
15:49 - cost BG so let's go send you here or
15:52 - click on the anchor presets here and go
15:57 - again bottom-right corner while holding
15:59 - down alt there we go and then let's set
16:02 - the font size to say 21 that might be
16:05 - too too much and let's make this wide so
16:07 - we can see let's try
16:09 - 18 there and that's changing the text
16:12 - here and that's also input of course our
16:15 - dollar sign there we go so this is a
16:18 - cost of 300 and right now we'll just
16:20 - hard code the same you can of course add
16:22 - some functionality on the shop that
16:24 - references the object and sets and this
16:27 - text variable to whatever the cost is
16:29 - but I really think that that unnecessary
16:31 - for now we can just change this manually
16:33 - so that is what we're going to do so
16:36 - let's actually take these oh wait this
16:39 - element let's delete the other one here
16:40 - and recreate that in a second let's take
16:42 - this element and scale it up to
16:44 - something like 130 by 130 and let's also
16:48 - of course take our sharp here and scale
16:53 - that up as well so that the object won't
16:56 - be squished and that definitely did
17:00 - something weird to our panel here so
17:01 - let's just reformat that let's also make
17:05 - sure that our text snaps to the Centers
17:07 - on x and y that makes it a bit easier to
17:10 - see how this will turn out and I
17:13 - definitely want this text size to be
17:15 - larger so let's try 21 there and I think
17:18 - that is definitely better and let's try
17:21 - and make this panel just a bit bigger
17:23 - and position it some rare around there
17:26 - and I actually really like the look of
17:30 - that so I think we're going to go with
17:31 - that and actually I want to position it
17:33 - maybe a tiny bit higher yeah I am
17:38 - starting to be pretty satisfied with
17:40 - that and then what we can do is we can
17:43 - duplicate this and change it to fit
17:47 - actually let's hit apply on this first
17:48 - so we can duplicate this and change it
17:50 - to fit our auditory as well so we'll
17:53 - change the icon huge to missile launcher
17:55 - we'll change the function here to shop
17:58 - select missile launcher will change the
18:01 - preferred width and height and this is
18:03 - actually where we might have forgotten
18:05 - to do something in that is the panel
18:07 - here we don't want that to stretch we
18:08 - want that to be centered let's just edit
18:11 - that and apply that and I think that
18:14 - should apply there as well yes that is
18:16 - now centered and now we can select our
18:18 - standard turret and change the preferred
18:21 - width and height to 110 because the icon
18:24 - is a bit larger here but that should be
18:27 - fine to do there we go that looks great
18:29 - and then of course change the cost
18:31 - amount to what we set it to which I
18:34 - believe was 250 definitely was there we
18:38 - go and we're going to rename this to our
18:40 - missile launcher item again so now we
18:44 - have two nice-looking buttons here where
18:47 - we can easily add more where we have a
18:49 - price variable as well and you can see
18:52 - that these should definitely work inside
18:54 - of the game cool so we run out of money
18:58 - for these turrets we only have 50 left
19:01 - awesome so the next thing that we are
19:05 - going to look at and that was a fast one
19:07 - definitely is the filtered particles and
19:10 - we are going to make those very quickly
19:12 - as well but I definitely think that it
19:13 - will just add a little cool effect to
19:15 - the game so whenever it comes to doing
19:18 - UI I definitely recommend that you spend
19:20 - a lot of time making it as clear as
19:23 - possible what is happening so whenever
19:25 - you place a turret let's add some visual
19:28 - feedback other than the chart just
19:29 - appearing that you just build that but
19:32 - you just did something that was good
19:34 - also what I recommend you do is add some
19:36 - kind of animation whenever we spend
19:38 - money that shows um let's say it you can
19:43 - just add a text that subtract that
19:45 - amount of money on the screen and then
19:46 - floats away or fades away that could be
19:49 - one thing to do you could also add a
19:50 - sound effect that's definitely a way but
19:53 - having visual cues in there is good as
19:55 - well we might add something they do and
19:57 - definitely when are killing enemies it's
19:59 - great to have some
20:00 - visual feedback that that is giving you
20:03 - some money back which it currently isn't
20:05 - in our game budget that is to come
20:09 - so yeah so where were we a build chart
20:12 - particle effect so let's actually just
20:15 - use down here the prefabs bullet impact
20:17 - effect as kind of a template and let's
20:20 - rename this to mmm build effect and I
20:25 - think we'll just have a global one for
20:26 - all kinds of turrets you can definitely
20:29 - create different ones for the different
20:30 - turrets and let's drag that into the
20:32 - prefabs folder and what I want to do
20:35 - here is I want to copy the particle
20:37 - system remove it and then I want to
20:39 - reset the transform on this build effect
20:42 - let's go out of 2d mode and let's just
20:45 - drag it up a bit here so we can see it
20:47 - better let's then create a new empty
20:49 - game object on that with a reset
20:51 - transform and this is going to be our
20:53 - particle system so let go particle or
20:57 - particles and then we can paste the
21:00 - component backing as new and this will
21:03 - just allow us when we change the shape
21:04 - here to hemisphere instead of sphere and
21:07 - bump up the radius to then rotate this
21:09 - Hemisphere without rotating on the route
21:13 - our on the anchor of a transform so
21:17 - let's now rotate this by negative 90 on
21:20 - the X and this will make sure that it
21:22 - will shoot upwards when we hit simulate
21:24 - cold and what we can then do and the
21:28 - radius here just need that to be one I
21:30 - think it set this to loop so we can
21:32 - definitely see what is going on a bit
21:34 - better
21:34 - let's also actually change
21:38 - I think the emission is fine and the
21:40 - shape is fine now but let's definitely
21:42 - change the gravity modifier to negative
21:45 - one so that it starts floating instead
21:47 - which is pretty cool in general whenever
21:49 - something really positive happens
21:51 - creating some kind of floating upwards
21:53 - effect it's um it's often used for level
21:56 - ups it's used for when you successfully
21:59 - build stuff
22:00 - positive spells stuff like that it
22:03 - creates some feeling of a nice floaty
22:06 - magical yeah it's rewarding it's what
22:09 - I'm trying to say so um we can then
22:11 - disable the collision arm
22:13 - I actually don't even know what these
22:16 - are called the coalition controls the
22:19 - coalition sub particle thing I don't
22:22 - know
22:23 - so we'll just just disable collision and
22:25 - what we can then do is create a new
22:29 - material here and we'll just use the
22:30 - bullet impact again as a template so
22:32 - this one is going to be our build effect
22:36 - and I basically just want to take the
22:39 - albedo here and make it some kind of
22:41 - brighter blue I think that will look
22:45 - pretty good and then inside of our
22:47 - particles we can go to the renderer and
22:49 - we can substitute that ah effect there
22:52 - or that material and I really like the
22:54 - look of that that is definitely nice and
22:57 - it's very visible in the scene then what
22:59 - we can do is we can maybe bump up the
23:01 - size on these so let's change the size
23:03 - to something like point 5 to 0.75 so we
23:07 - want them to start really large but I
23:10 - definitely want a much quicker fall on
23:12 - Fallout on the arm size here so let's
23:15 - just change the size curve to begin
23:18 - reducing right away here so let's just
23:21 - use that curve right there I think that
23:24 - looks really cool and we can maybe just
23:27 - bump down the lifetime a tiny bit here
23:30 - to say 1.5 I think that looks a bit
23:33 - better yeah I really like the look of
23:37 - that and we can also maybe increase the
23:40 - speed a tiny bit so let's do between 2
23:42 - and 8 cone so something is really
23:47 - happening here so I actually really like
23:49 - the look of this effect so let's disable
23:51 - looping let's hit apply on the prefab
23:55 - here let's remove that prefab let's very
23:58 - quickly add this in code so we simply go
24:01 - to our game master we find our build
24:03 - manager and wherever we build a turret
24:06 - on a node we want to just add in a
24:08 - prefab that we will specify here so this
24:11 - is going to be a public game object and
24:12 - it's going to be our build effect oops
24:17 - my cat is stepping on the keyboard as
24:19 - always so a build effect here and we'll
24:22 - go down here and we'll instantiate that
24:25 - so let's go instantiate
24:27 - and we want to instantiate the build
24:29 - effect and we want to instantiate it add
24:31 - note dot get build position and you
24:34 - could get that only once and then store
24:36 - it in a vector e or we could just get it
24:38 - twice with just what we're going to do
24:40 - and then we can use quaternion whoops
24:42 - not quality level we can use catonian
24:44 - dot identity - not rotate it at all
24:47 - basically and we can of course store it
24:49 - in a temporary variable so we can get
24:51 - rid of it again so let's do that game
24:53 - object effect and set that equal to the
24:56 - instantiated object and we want to cast
24:58 - it into a game object and then we can go
25:01 - destroy that not debug we want to
25:04 - destroy that effect after say five
25:07 - seconds just to be on the safe side and
25:09 - to clean up the hierarchy afterwards so
25:12 - now if we close that down and remember
25:14 - to actually reference our build effect
25:16 - under our prefabs here so we have the
25:18 - build effect and now everything should
25:22 - work so if we hit play we should see a
25:25 - cool-looking effect here so let's try
25:27 - and build something and I definitely
25:30 - like the look of that you could
25:31 - definitely also add more celebratory
25:33 - colors have the particles be different
25:36 - colors might be cool and one thing that
25:39 - is really exciting is that on the next
25:42 - version of unity unity 5.5 comes with a
25:45 - lot more controls when it comes to doing
25:47 - random colors and all that kind of stuff
25:49 - it really has a lot of new particle
25:53 - effect to play around with so that is
25:55 - really exciting if you're really excited
25:57 - about that you can grab the 5.5 beta
25:59 - which is public so just wanted to
26:02 - mention that as well and without further
26:04 - ado I think that was pretty much all
26:05 - that I wanted to show for this video so
26:08 - I hope you enjoyed it and yeah thanks
26:10 - for watching and I'll see you in the
26:11 - next video I also forgot to mention that
26:14 - I will be live-streaming on Thursday the
26:16 - 29th so if that is something you're
26:19 - interested in definitely check it out
26:21 - this is going to be the second brackets
26:23 - live stream and this last one was just
26:26 - so much fun so I definitely hope to see
26:28 - you there and I will make sure to update
26:30 - on Facebook and Twitter and maybe also
26:33 - upload a video right on before we start
26:36 - to let you know but I just wanted to
26:38 - mention it so you can set time aside in
26:40 - your Cal
26:40 - so follow me on those kind of things if
26:43 - you're interested and I hope to see you
26:45 - there bye thank you so much to all of
26:47 - the awesome patreon supporters who
