00:00 - thanks for tuning in at
00:03 - braies hello everyone and welcome to
00:04 - this video on creating a tower defense
00:06 - game in unity today we are going to be
00:07 - creating a level selector so some kind
00:10 - of menu that will display the amount of
00:12 - levels that we have in our game and then
00:14 - the user can click on them to go to that
00:16 - level we still don't transition between
00:18 - levels so if you complete one level it
00:20 - won't actually take you to the next one
00:22 - that's something we'll add in a future
00:24 - video and also all of these um levels
00:27 - are unlocked immediately we still have
00:29 - to do some way of maybe unlocking levels
00:31 - as we go that could be something really
00:33 - fun to add and of course we also need
00:35 - more levels but I thought we would start
00:37 - with the level selector and then work
00:39 - from there so let's just jump right into
00:41 - unity and what I want to do is just base
00:44 - this off one of the already existing
00:46 - scenes that we have whoops don't want to
00:48 - save this one and I thought we would
00:50 - just work off the main menu because it
00:52 - has this background and that feels nice
00:55 - and also we only have the scene fader
00:57 - and not a lot else in here so let's just
01:00 - duplicate the main menu and let's rename
01:02 - this to level
01:04 - selector and or select or whatever I'm
01:06 - just going to do level select actually
01:09 - and uh let's double click on level
01:11 - select so you can see that's the one
01:12 - that's opened up now and we want to
01:15 - delete pretty much everything in here we
01:16 - want to remove the standard turret we
01:18 - want to uh remove well we can actually
01:21 - keep this background here to use as a
01:24 - background for our UI and then just
01:26 - build our UI on top of that or we could
01:28 - have a flat color that's totally to you
01:30 - I think I'm just going to leave it in
01:31 - here and uh just remove the main menu uh
01:35 - object so that we don't have the
01:36 - functionality for our main menu in our
01:38 - level select uh
01:40 - script cool so now we can just save that
01:42 - and we can go ahead and start building
01:44 - the UI so let's right click create UI
01:47 - canvas and we want to rename this to
01:49 - something like UI Canvas OR overlay
01:52 - canvas something like that I think we
01:54 - want to change the UI scale mode to
01:56 - scale with screen size so that when we
01:58 - scale this up our UI is going to scale
02:00 - with it and um I don't want to
02:03 - necessarily select Pixel Perfect let's
02:06 - just go under the UI canvas in the scene
02:08 - view here focus on it so we can get a
02:10 - good view and make sure you're in 2D
02:11 - mode and let's right click go UI and
02:14 - let's start by maybe creating some kind
02:16 - of text that is going to say select
02:21 - level and uh we want to change this to a
02:24 - robotto maybe even the thin one and we
02:26 - definitely want to scale this up quite a
02:28 - bit I also want to Anchor it to the
02:31 - bottom here so the bottom left and let's
02:35 - bump up the font size here so we can
02:37 - actually see this in the game want to
02:39 - change the color here to White and we
02:41 - can maybe also add a shadow but for now
02:43 - we'll just leave it as is and then we'll
02:45 - see if that's necessary uh later so I
02:48 - think this already looks just fine and
02:50 - uh we can maybe just move this up a tiny
02:52 - bit to make room for our actual UI so
02:55 - this is going to be our title and then
02:57 - we can go here and go UI and then
03:00 - panel and I want to create kind of a a
03:03 - panel uh for all of our level buttons to
03:07 - be in so let's just uh make sure this
03:09 - doesn't stretch with the scene I wanted
03:11 - instead to just be centered or anchored
03:14 - in the middle so just click there no
03:16 - holding down Al or anything and we can
03:18 - simply just scale this whole thing down
03:20 - so I wanted to scale down on the Y here
03:24 - want it to go kind of far down something
03:26 - like that and I want it to be about the
03:28 - same size or have the same starting
03:31 - point as our text so something like that
03:34 - looks fine for now and remember we can
03:36 - always tweak this later what I also want
03:39 - to do is definitely change the color to
03:41 - a black color and we can see what that
03:43 - looks like in the game and I actually
03:45 - want to bump down the alpha even more so
03:47 - something like that I think that looks
03:49 - quite decent and uh it's definitely um
03:53 - usable so this here is going to be our
03:57 - levels and uh this is the actual
04:00 - background for our levels I also want to
04:03 - have an object that is responsible for
04:05 - laying out all of our level buttons so
04:07 - some kind of grid I also want to have
04:10 - another object that's responsible for
04:12 - allowing us to scroll through levels so
04:14 - let's say we have more levels that we
04:16 - can show on the screen I want to use a
04:18 - scroll Rec so that we can um actually
04:20 - scroll through and we'll also add a
04:22 - scroll bar over here for displaying the
04:24 - rest of them so um this is our
04:27 - background so now we can go ahead and
04:28 - create a new um empty object under that
04:32 - background and we can just reset that
04:34 - and we also want this to we actually we
04:37 - want this to scale with our parent
04:40 - object so we'll just um you know hold
04:42 - down alt here and click in the bottom
04:45 - right and this here is going to be kind
04:48 - of our
04:50 - scroll uh our scroll rect and uh we can
04:54 - Jo maybe just give it a tiny bit on the
04:58 - left here so like 20
05:00 - on the left top right and bottom just so
05:03 - we kind of separate it out from our
05:05 - background I think that's going to look
05:06 - pretty nice and um then we can go ahead
05:09 - and create a new empty object under that
05:12 - as well and this here is going to be our
05:15 - actual Grid or we could also just call
05:17 - it the content so um we'll have to link
05:21 - all of these up in a moment and it's
05:22 - kind of confusing that you have to
05:23 - create the hierarchy in this way but
05:25 - after having done it a few times you're
05:27 - going to get used to it and yeah it's
05:29 - with every as with everything else in
05:31 - unity they have their standards of doing
05:33 - things and on you once you get used to
05:35 - them uh it shouldn't really be an issue
05:38 - so what we can do now is maybe um create
05:41 - a bottom uh button for our content so
05:44 - let's just size it up here and this is
05:46 - going to be automatically sizing to fit
05:48 - our content so that's why I don't really
05:50 - care about the size here I just wanted
05:52 - to make it a bit larger so that we can
05:54 - see our button that we now are going to
05:57 - create and uh let's just just make this
06:00 - say 100 by a 100 and uh actually that
06:04 - doesn't matter because what we'll go
06:06 - ahead and do right away is add a grid
06:08 - layout to this content so we'll go in
06:11 - here and we'll say we want a grid layout
06:13 - group and that now allows us if we
06:16 - duplicate this spot in here I'm just
06:18 - going to make a bunch of them you can
06:20 - see that it automatically lays them out
06:23 - so that's a really really handy feature
06:25 - in un and what we'll do is we'll um just
06:29 - again and anchor this to scale with our
06:31 - scroll W just to see how that looks and
06:34 - you can see that already looks pretty
06:36 - nice and what we can do is maybe keep
06:38 - the cell size at 100 but definitely add
06:41 - some spacing so I want something like
06:43 - maybe 13 on the X maybe a bit less I do
06:47 - want there to be another row so maybe 11
06:51 - on the X there and let's do the same
06:53 - thing on the Y so that already looks
06:57 - quite decent and what we can then do to
06:59 - our content here is we can add a um
07:02 - content size fitter and what this will
07:06 - do and it will only do it in just a
07:07 - second is it will automatically resize
07:10 - this object to fit of the button so in
07:13 - our case it would resize to fit like
07:16 - this and then if we uh remove the buttom
07:19 - button here uh it would automatically
07:22 - just bump up here so that's really
07:24 - really handy because our scroll R will
07:28 - um Orient this content here um and uh
07:32 - depending on the size of the content so
07:34 - if the content is larger than the size
07:36 - of our scroll R it's going to uh of
07:38 - course allow us to scroll through that
07:41 - so it's really really neat that we can
07:42 - get our content to resize to uh fit the
07:45 - actual size of all of the buttons
07:47 - together so in order to make it do this
07:50 - first off I want to take the Anchor
07:52 - Point here and bump it up to one on the
07:54 - Y just to make sure that it will Orient
07:57 - itself from the bottom um
07:59 - um Cent or from the upper Center so that
08:02 - it will scale in this way and not scale
08:05 - and both down and up at the same time oh
08:09 - and unity is messing around here I think
08:11 - uh the unity UI system is really really
08:15 - awesome but sometimes you just get weird
08:17 - Behavior Like These Warnings here and
08:19 - they're not actually dangerous because
08:21 - they won't actually do anything inside
08:24 - of the game but you can see just how
08:26 - much they're messing everything up right
08:28 - now so let's just disable our content
08:29 - size fitter Let's uh try and scale this
08:32 - up and you can see Unity is just going
08:34 - completely crazy here so I might have to
08:37 - restart and it's a really really
08:39 - annoying thing that this is happening I
08:41 - I really hope they're working on it it
08:43 - looks like it kind of stopped Ming up
08:45 - there cool so yeah it's just unity's UI
08:49 - system what are you going to do so what
08:51 - we can do now that we've anchored it up
08:53 - here is reenable the content size fitter
08:56 - and on the vertical fit we now want to
08:59 - put preferred size and you can see now
09:02 - that it automatically rescales so if we
09:04 - delete this one it's going to snap up
09:06 - there indeed it does cool so that's
09:09 - already working so what we want to do
09:11 - now is of course go in and make these
09:13 - buttons a bit more interesting and to do
09:16 - that um let's just remove all of them
09:18 - except for one and let's rename this to
09:21 - something like level button and um we
09:25 - can definitely mess around with some of
09:27 - these settings um the first thing that I
09:28 - want do is change the text object here
09:32 - to not say button I wanted to say the
09:34 - number of our level so this is going to
09:36 - be our first level and we can go in here
09:38 - and bump up the font size quite a bit
09:41 - and also want to change that to robotto
09:43 - thin I like that look something like
09:46 - that looks pretty good already actually
09:48 - and you can definitely just use white
09:50 - and black in here but I also thought it
09:52 - could be fun if we maybe uh tinted this
09:54 - uh button here in uh in some kind of
09:57 - color but it might just be
10:00 - yeah it it doesn't look better I think
10:02 - we should just stick to the very
10:03 - minimalist theme but as always I really
10:06 - recommend that you spend some time on it
10:08 - play around with it get it to look
10:10 - exactly the way that you want it to so
10:13 - I'm also going to go into our level
10:14 - button here and add a
10:17 - shadow and just to give it a tiny bit of
10:22 - a 3D feel here to make it stand out and
10:25 - I'm definitely going to decrease the
10:27 - alpha on that that channel so you can
10:29 - see that looks uh a little better it
10:32 - just gives a tiny more detail so it
10:34 - doesn't look too simple and dumb so yeah
10:38 - I I really like that and one thing we
10:40 - can also do uh is maybe change the hover
10:43 - animation and click but we can do that
10:45 - in a second so now let's turn turn this
10:48 - button here into a prefab by going under
10:50 - the prefabs folder and dragging it in
10:53 - there and now we can just freely
10:55 - duplicate it as many times as we want
10:58 - because now when we change of course our
11:00 - level button down here uh they are all
11:02 - going to update so that's really handy
11:05 - and I thought we could um maybe just see
11:09 - how this looks when we hit play at
11:10 - moment so um you can see that they are
11:12 - currently extending Beyond uh the um
11:16 - confines of our scroll wct and we aren't
11:18 - actually able to drag them anywhere we
11:20 - can click on them but nothing will
11:21 - happen and also um you can see that it
11:25 - doesn't cut off here we want some kind
11:27 - of masking to happen so that they won't
11:30 - just well uh be shown in places that
11:33 - they shouldn't be shown so that's maybe
11:36 - the first thing that we should add is go
11:38 - to a scroll right here and add a Syle
11:41 - mask and we can make this a wrecked um
11:44 - mask 2D just to make it simply Square um
11:48 - and you can see that just cuts
11:49 - everything off that is without the
11:51 - confines of the scroll re scroll wck so
11:55 - you can see there it cuts everything off
11:56 - here it's just a very very simple effect
11:59 - but it looks quite cool and then what we
12:01 - can do is add some actual scrolling so
12:04 - if we go to a scroll R and add a well
12:07 - you guessed it a scroll wck uh we should
12:10 - be able to now drag in our content and
12:14 - uh for the viewport that's going to be
12:16 - the same as the scroll Rec component so
12:18 - we'll just drag in our scroll re here
12:21 - and everything else we should be able to
12:22 - leave as is we might want to disable
12:25 - horizontal scrolling because we only
12:27 - want to do that on the vertical so now
12:29 - you should see that when we go in here
12:31 - we should be able to click and drag on
12:34 - these buttons and you can even see how
12:35 - smooth that feels so a really really
12:38 - simple uh and easy to make effect and we
12:41 - can still click on all the buttons to
12:43 - activate them so that's really cool and
12:46 - you can even see a bit of hover
12:47 - animation in there so the next thing
12:50 - that I wanted to do was maybe spice off
12:52 - our spice up our hover animation a tiny
12:55 - bit because I think the ending looks a
12:57 - bit boring so luckily in some of the
13:00 - earlier videos we created this cool
13:02 - hover animation for our buttons and we
13:04 - can just go ahead and reuse that so all
13:06 - we need to do is go to transition and of
13:08 - course I've selected our prefab to
13:10 - change all of them at the same time so
13:12 - go to transition and select animation
13:15 - and we want to turn off navigation and
13:18 - under um and we want to go down and hit
13:21 - add component and add in an animator and
13:24 - this is where we created the controller
13:26 - from earlier called button
13:29 - and this is basically a very very simple
13:32 - uh controller all it does is it has a
13:35 - normal um animation with a scale of 111
13:40 - then it has a highlighted animation U
13:42 - with a scale of 1.05 and we also have a
13:46 - tiny bit of hover animation in there so
13:48 - you can see that it actually does a bit
13:50 - of pulsating but you can just put a
13:52 - single key frame here for the uh
13:55 - 1.05 and we do the same thing when we
13:58 - press it so we wanted to go back to
14:01 - 111 cool so yeah that's pretty much all
14:04 - that is so you can quickly recreate that
14:06 - or go back and watch the earlier videos
14:08 - if you want to see how we did that so
14:09 - you can see already that that looks just
14:12 - much much better and feels much smoother
14:15 - much smoother
14:16 - cool so um next up what we can do is uh
14:21 - link these buttons so that they will
14:24 - actually transition to a new level
14:26 - because currently nothing happens when
14:28 - we click condom and in order to do that
14:31 - let's go ahead and create a script that
14:33 - we want to act as the central place for
14:36 - doing logic when it comes to selecting
14:38 - different levels in the beginning it's
14:40 - just going to have a very simple public
14:42 - method called something like uh select
14:44 - or load that takes in the name of the
14:46 - level that we want to load and then we
14:48 - tell the scene fader to fade into that
14:51 - level um but in the future it can handle
14:54 - stuff like looking at what levels are
14:57 - locked and showing a locked graphic
14:59 - checking if you can actually play that
15:01 - level it could also dynamically load all
15:04 - of the levels that you have available
15:06 - from an array or something and put them
15:08 - in here so you don't have to add a new
15:10 - button every time you make a new level
15:12 - it can do a lot of stuff but for now
15:14 - we'll just have it be really really
15:15 - simple so let's create an empty object
15:18 - let's reset the transform and let's call
15:20 - it a level
15:22 - selector and we can go in here and add
15:24 - component level
15:27 - selector and we can double click on that
15:30 - to open it up in visual studio and
15:33 - that's actually the first scripting
15:34 - we're going to do for this video so I'm
15:37 - excited I'm just going to have a sip of
15:39 - water there awesome so what we can do in
15:41 - here is just remove system do
15:43 - Collections and system. collections.
15:45 - generic we're not going to be using
15:47 - those and we'll go in here and create a
15:49 - public
15:51 - void called let's just call it select
15:54 - actually and the function is going to
15:57 - take in a string with the level name
16:00 - that we want to select or the name of
16:02 - the level that we want to select and um
16:05 - we could just go in here and use uh
16:07 - Unity engine. scen manager do um load
16:11 - level and then uh load the level
16:14 - directly but let's just utilize the fact
16:17 - that we do have some functionality for
16:19 - fading between scenes so in our case we
16:22 - want to get a reference to our scene
16:24 - fader and we can just call this fader
16:27 - and then we can use fader do Fade 2 and
16:31 - then put in the level name here so
16:34 - that's just going to look a bit nicer
16:36 - and now all we need to do is find our
16:38 - level selector and drag in our scene
16:41 - fader into the fader um field there and
16:44 - we can maybe just drag up our level
16:46 - selector to organize that at the top so
16:49 - now we can go into our different buttons
16:52 - and believe it or not that was all the
16:53 - scripting that we needed to do for this
16:55 - video so we can go into our first button
16:57 - for example we can can go down here and
16:59 - add an on click event and all we need to
17:02 - do is drag in the level selector go on
17:05 - uh the level selector script and select
17:08 - choose select and the uh and we get a
17:12 - string here that we can input and the
17:14 - level that we want to load is something
17:15 - like level one and we can do the same
17:18 - one for the second one except for this
17:20 - one we want to change the text to two
17:23 - and we want to go in and add an on click
17:25 - event drag in our level selector go on
17:28 - the level selector script and choose
17:31 - select and let's input now level two so
17:35 - it's really really really simple and we
17:37 - can maybe just delete all of the
17:39 - remaining levels so that we don't have
17:41 - some that will not work uh they were
17:43 - just for testing and uh what we can do
17:47 - now is create these levels so we
17:49 - currently have our main level let's
17:51 - rename this one to level one and uh if
17:55 - we duplicate this level it will aut
17:57 - automatically Ally name it level two and
18:00 - if we now just jump into level two I
18:02 - thought we would just quickly change
18:04 - something about this level so that we
18:06 - can easily see that um it's different so
18:10 - for this level let's just go in and
18:12 - change our start lives from one to 10 so
18:16 - on level one our start lives are going
18:18 - to be one and on level two our start
18:21 - lives is going to be 10 so uh that
18:25 - should just give us a clear idea of what
18:27 - level we're currently on so now if we go
18:29 - back into our select level hit play we
18:33 - should be able to go to level
18:35 - one and indeed it says one lives here
18:39 - and if we then restart here and select
18:42 - level two it's going to go to level two
18:46 - no and here we get an error and that's
18:48 - because we haven't added level two to
18:50 - the build settings and this is something
18:52 - you need to do for all scenes just you
18:54 - need to drag them under the build
18:56 - settings so let's go to build settings
18:58 - and let's drag in level two let's also
19:01 - drag in level select because we're going
19:03 - to be transitioning to that in just a
19:05 - moment so I'm just going to drag it up
19:07 - here but the order really doesn't matter
19:09 - for us so we can hit save again hit play
19:12 - and transy select level two now and it's
19:15 - going to transition and it's going to
19:16 - say 10 lives so now we you can just go
19:19 - completely nuts create as many levels as
19:22 - you want to and add them in here and uh
19:25 - yeah you're going to have a lot of
19:26 - replay value so that's awesome
19:29 - of course we also want to have a way of
19:31 - going to or transitioning to this level
19:33 - select level scene um and we want to do
19:37 - that from our main menu so I thought
19:38 - when we hit play here instead of just
19:40 - playing from level one let's just load
19:43 - up the level select and then the user
19:45 - can choose for himself what he wants to
19:46 - play so let's under our main menu
19:48 - instead of uh having our main level as
19:51 - the level to load let's go in here and
19:54 - have level select so now when you go and
19:57 - hit play you start start at the main
19:58 - menu you hit play it transitions to our
20:02 - level select and then you can uh choose
20:05 - either one or two I'm going to select
20:07 - two and it transitions uh further and
20:09 - you can even go back here if you're at
20:11 - Escape go to the menu hit play again we
20:15 - can select maybe level one this time and
20:17 - it's going to go in there instead so you
20:19 - can see how nicely these scenes are tied
20:22 - together the last thing that I wanted to
20:25 - show you is under our level select and
20:28 - what I wanted to do was just add a very
20:30 - simple scroll bar in case you don't like
20:33 - this uh dragging around of the objects I
20:37 - kind of like it but maybe it's not too
20:39 - intuitive if people have never really
20:40 - seen it before I mean on phones it's
20:43 - it's really common but doing it with a
20:45 - mouse is not really standard so what
20:48 - we'll do instead is go in and uh let's
20:50 - just create a bunch of test buttons here
20:53 - so let's just duplicate this one a bunch
20:55 - of
20:55 - times and let's also go under our
20:59 - levels this main object which has our
21:02 - background let's go UI and then create a
21:05 - scroll
21:07 - bar and of course this is currently
21:09 - centered to the horizontal a axis so
21:12 - let's go down here and change from uh
21:15 - the direction from left to right and
21:17 - then instead have it be bottom to top
21:20 - and it's going to automatically rescale
21:22 - it here and then what we can do is maybe
21:25 - move it over here somewhere there looks
21:28 - just fine we can also scale it up like
21:32 - that I think that looks a lot better and
21:34 - of course we need to reference this so
21:36 - we need to go into our scroll rect and
21:38 - drag our scroll bar into the vertical
21:41 - scroll bar field and now you can see it
21:43 - repositions itself and resizes itself in
21:47 - such a way that it will fit on our
21:51 - content and when we then scroll to the
21:52 - bottom here you can see our content
21:54 - Scrolls up and even we can still drag
21:57 - like this
21:58 - and it's just going to uh move the
22:01 - scroll bar so they are both interl and
22:04 - will uh interact with each other so
22:06 - that's awesome and we can even make our
22:08 - scroll bar a bit prettier because I yeah
22:12 - this is not too good and we can maybe
22:14 - take our this is our background so we
22:17 - can take that and make it kind of black
22:19 - and very very
22:21 - transparent something like that just
22:23 - very seethrough and then we can find our
22:27 - sliding area and then the handle and we
22:29 - can change the color on this also to be
22:32 - black but um add a bit more of opacity
22:36 - to that one so now we should be able to
22:39 - hit play and you can see that looks just
22:42 - a little bit better I think and we can
22:43 - also even use our scroll wheel uh to U
22:46 - change it so that's awesome and
22:48 - everything is working we can go ahead
22:50 - and delete all of our buttons here and
22:53 - you can see that when it's not needed
22:54 - it's just going to be this um uh this um
23:00 - what should we call it uniformly colored
23:02 - bar that you can really interact with
23:04 - you can of course add a script if you
23:06 - want it to fade out when it's not needed
23:08 - but I like it being there like this so
23:11 - that was pretty much all I wanted to
23:14 - show you in this video I hope you
23:16 - enjoyed it let me know what you want to
23:17 - see next I want to do more with levels
23:20 - definitely have some kind of way of
23:22 - transitioning to a new level once you've
23:24 - U mastered the uh the previous one and
23:27 - also Al some way of unlocking levels
23:30 - which will give us a handy way of
23:31 - talking about uh saving data inside of
23:34 - unity so I thought that's pretty
23:36 - exciting but of course let me know if
23:38 - I'm going off on a tangent and no no one
23:41 - really wants to see this so yeah thanks
