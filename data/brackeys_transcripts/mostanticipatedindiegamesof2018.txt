00:00 - with the beginning of a new year and
00:01 - luckily that means there is a bunch of
00:04 - new indie games waiting to come out and
00:06 - of course as a fellow developer it's
00:08 - always great to see what others are
00:09 - working on in this video I want to share
00:11 - the indie games that I'm most excited
00:12 - about in 2018 so let's jump into first
00:16 - up we have Griff Lance this is one of
00:19 - those games that you take one look at
00:20 - and you immediately want to play made by
00:23 - the people behind don't starve the art
00:25 - style of gift lands is pretty similar it
00:27 - has an extremely put together look Griff
00:29 - dance is a turn-based RPG taking place
00:32 - in a bracket sci-fi world and with
00:34 - fighting animations like these I'm
00:36 - definitely excited about it
00:37 - next we have manifold garden manifold
00:40 - garden is a first-person exploration
00:42 - game and it's actually made by a friend
00:44 - of mine William sure inspired by this
00:46 - real architecture of MC Escher
00:49 - manifold Gardens level design is a short
00:52 - force stretching as far as the eye can
00:54 - see and then some manifold garden just
00:56 - looks inherently interesting so yeah I'm
00:59 - looking forward to this one another
01:01 - beautiful game is the last night all the
01:04 - sprites are incredibly detailed and
01:06 - paired with the strange beauty of the
01:08 - dystopian backgrounds this game's
01:10 - atmosphere looks amazing the last night
01:13 - revolves around storytelling and making
01:15 - the players decisions count it's always
01:17 - interesting to see developers try and
01:19 - give their players real influence on the
01:20 - game also the cute 2d platformers bill
01:24 - donkey is finally getting a sequel the
01:26 - trailer doesn't give much away but if
01:28 - it's anything like the original it's
01:29 - definitely going to be worth playing now
01:32 - as some of you might know I'm a huge fan
01:34 - of Ori and the blind forest which is why
01:36 - I was absolutely stoked to find out that
01:38 - there's going to be a sequel
01:44 - orientable of the wisps has much to live
01:47 - up to since I consider the original the
01:49 - greatest platformer ever made judging by
01:51 - the trailer will if the wisps looks just
01:53 - as beautiful but of course when it comes
01:55 - to the gameplay we'll just have to wait
01:57 - and see this is definitely the game that
01:59 - I'm looking forward to the most this
02:01 - year also getting a sequel is the
02:03 - much-loved classic Super Meat Boy back
02:06 - when it came out Super Meat Boy
02:07 - pioneered a new era in indie titles and
02:10 - help show how popular indie games could
02:13 - become as for its sequel Super Meat Boy
02:15 - forever would be an adventure to
02:17 - translate market debate just like the
02:19 - original this game will be focused on
02:21 - fast paced gameplay and is probably
02:23 - going to be crazy hard but we all know
02:26 - which game is truly the most anticipated
02:28 - in the title of 2018 I'm of course
02:31 - talking about call of duty known among
02:34 - indie devs as the mother of indie games
02:36 - can can add another title to its range
02:38 - this year being a small studio I'm
02:40 - personally impressed that tragus able to
02:42 - publish a game so shortly after their
02:44 - last one
02:46 - all right on a more serious note I wanna
02:49 - mention Frost Punk made by the creators
02:52 - of this war of mine frost Punk gives you
02:54 - the power to rule over a population in a
02:57 - bleak frozen future you might even say
03:00 - that this game looks seriously cold
03:02 - frost Punk is definitely going to test
03:05 - your moral compass and your ability to
03:07 - prioritize so sign me up a game I'm
03:10 - personally really excited about it's
03:11 - octahedron a 2d platformer with an
03:14 - absolutely amazing color palette the
03:16 - soundtrack is also found to be awesome
03:18 - as its partially made by the artist
03:20 - behind the music for super hexagon which
03:22 - is an old favorite of mine and just like
03:25 - super hexagon I expect octahedron to
03:27 - rely heavily on its music
03:29 - this game is made by the one-man studio
03:31 - demi-monde a and is to be released in
03:33 - January lastly I want to mention a fun
03:36 - game that's also created by a friend of
03:37 - mine nor nor isn't as much a game as
03:41 - it's a tool that enables you to do
03:43 - something very important play with your
03:45 - food I'm definitely looking forward to
03:47 - playing around with it so that pretty
03:49 - much sums up my most anticipated in the
03:51 - games of 2018 actually there's so many
