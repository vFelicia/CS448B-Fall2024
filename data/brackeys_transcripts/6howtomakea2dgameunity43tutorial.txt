00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello
00:04 - everyone welcome to episode number six
00:06 - in going to Dee today we are going to
00:09 - reset and restart our ball whenever the
00:13 - player scores and also just do a few
00:15 - cool fixes here and there to make the
00:17 - game better these are things we need to
00:20 - get out of the way before we can start
00:22 - doing sound work which will we'll
00:24 - probably do in the next episode so as
00:27 - always I've opened up unity and if we go
00:30 - in here let's first off select the ball
00:32 - and just Center it because it does noise
00:35 - me that it needs to be all the way up
00:36 - there now that we have this ball
00:39 - centered we can go ahead and take a look
00:43 - at what happens right now when the ball
00:44 - goes out of the screen we can see that
00:47 - our score it goes up but the ball
00:51 - doesn't reset and also another thing
00:54 - that that is not like it should be is
00:57 - that these two numbers it might be hard
01:00 - to see are a little bit to the right and
01:02 - the reason why is because whenever you
01:05 - are Center something in unity it centers
01:08 - from an anchor point and when it comes
01:11 - to DUI like text that our anchor point
01:14 - is by default in the top left corner so
01:18 - what we need to do in scripting is we
01:19 - need to subtract about half the width of
01:23 - the both the 0 and the 1 here so that it
01:27 - will be actually centered so if we go
01:30 - ahead and find out GM object go under
01:33 - the game manager script so double click
01:36 - it to open it up in game monodevelop
01:39 - we can go down here where we create our
01:41 - labels and then here we subtract 150
01:45 - from the center but we also need to
01:48 - subtract half the width and I've played
01:51 - around with this a bit and it lies about
01:53 - 12 points so that should be just fine in
01:56 - here because we say plus 150 we still
02:00 - need to say - because it's still
02:03 - oriented in the left hand corner so just
02:05 - do - 112 - hundred and 12 on both of
02:09 - them so let's see and now these are
02:14 - centered so that might have been hard to
02:17 - see but if we moved up our ball in the
02:20 - center you could see that they were not
02:22 - perfectly aligned cool so what we can do
02:26 - now is we can take care of the ball
02:28 - resetting and restarting so to do this
02:31 - let's open up the game manager know the
02:36 - that's the ball script we need to take
02:38 - care of here so go on the ball then ball
02:41 - control and we can see right now
02:44 - whenever we start the game we just do a
02:47 - random function that will make it shoot
02:51 - out to either side and first thing I
02:54 - want to change here is because I think
02:56 - it's a little bit slow as is so I want
02:59 - to change this to something like 100 or
03:01 - 110 you can of course go ahead and make
03:04 - a variable for this actually let's just
03:06 - go ahead and do that so let's call this
03:08 - bar ball speed make it a float value and
03:13 - make it equal to let's say 100 by
03:16 - default then in here instead of 80 we're
03:19 - just going to write ball speed and here
03:23 - in negative 80 we're just going to do
03:26 - minus 1 times ball speed actually I'm
03:30 - pretty sure you can just do - ball speed
03:32 - let's see if you can do that so let's
03:35 - save it out and we get no errors
03:38 - hopefully no we don't and now the ball
03:41 - speed is 100 and that's just a little
03:42 - faster cool umm yeah so what we could do
03:48 - here is instead of just having it start
03:50 - right when the game opens because that
03:54 - it gets pretty hectic and most of the
03:56 - time the ball just goes flying off
03:58 - before you get to react and let's put a
04:01 - little bit of a yield statement in here
04:03 - a little bit of a wait so one let's move
04:06 - all of this code into another function
04:08 - that we can call when we want to so
04:10 - let's control X that or command exit so
04:13 - let's cut it and then down here write a
04:16 - function called function let's do go
04:20 - ball and here open up some brackets
04:25 - an inside of this function we can simply
04:29 - paste all everything we copied before so
04:32 - that's all this function needs needs to
04:34 - do and so up here in the function start
04:37 - we can simply say yield wait four
04:39 - seconds so this will delay the next
04:43 - action by two seconds because we've
04:45 - inputted the number two and again you
04:48 - can make this into a variable if it's
04:49 - something you want to tweak and then
04:52 - then let's do COBOL
04:54 - so now when we play the game if we save
04:57 - this and go back into unity we will play
05:00 - it it will wait two seconds and then
05:02 - launch the ball which is just perfect
05:05 - for just getting your fingers ready on
05:06 - the keyboard and such great so next
05:10 - thing is we need to be able to reset our
05:13 - ball whenever we want so let's do
05:15 - another function called reset ball and
05:21 - oops there and then the brackets and
05:27 - inside of here we are first off going to
05:31 - yeah let's first just and make the
05:34 - velocity zero so that okay let me just
05:38 - show you this actually if we just used
05:41 - to transform that position dot X and set
05:43 - that to zero and then use the transform
05:46 - that position that Y set that to zero on
05:49 - the problem one right now is that when
05:52 - we call the reset ball it will be
05:54 - centered but it will fly out immediately
05:58 - and the reason for this is that it still
06:01 - has the velocity that is it's generated
06:04 - so if it's traveling at a velocity of a
06:07 - hundred it will just teleport back here
06:10 - but still fly out so what we need to do
06:13 - is we all need to also reset the
06:15 - velocity so before the transform that
06:18 - position we need to say rigidbody2d dot
06:23 - velocity dot y equals zero and just the
06:28 - same with the x value - so ready to body
06:30 - - d dot velocity dot x equals zero and
06:36 - what we then want to do is we want to
06:38 - put in a yield
06:39 - and because we are currently playing and
06:43 - we already have our hands on the
06:45 - keyboard and such we'll just do
06:46 - something like 0.5 seconds and then say
06:50 - go ball and so once we call the reset
06:53 - ball function we it will Center
06:57 - everything wait for half an second and
06:59 - then shoot out the ball so that's all we
07:01 - need to call from our sidewalls
07:04 - so now let's go into our side wall
07:05 - script you can find it under GM and then
07:10 - left wall and then double click it and
07:12 - in here right after we bump up the score
07:16 - we need to say reset ball so we simply
07:19 - call this by first off using our
07:22 - reference to the ball and that's the
07:24 - hidden foe because we have collected
07:27 - some info about what's hit this Collider
07:29 - we've called this info hit info we've
07:33 - checked if this Collider this actual
07:36 - lead the ball and so now we can assume
07:38 - that inside this if statement hit info
07:41 - is our ball so we can simply do hit info
07:44 - that game object and this is more
07:46 - efficient than searching for the object
07:48 - or referencing it through a value
07:50 - variable because then you have to make
07:52 - sure that that variable so always stay
07:55 - connected and such so hit info that game
07:58 - object and then we can do that send
08:02 - message and then we need to open up a
08:07 - parenthesis and in here we simply write
08:11 - the name of the function which is reset
08:13 - ball and whenever you need to write
08:15 - something in strings it will probably
08:17 - not throw an error if it's wrong so it's
08:20 - just a good idea to go in copy the
08:23 - function name inside of the strings here
08:26 - just to avoid errors enter then just
08:29 - close this up and it will call the
08:32 - function reset ball whenever we hit a
08:34 - wall so now when we hit play and the
08:38 - ball just flies out it resets wait for
08:41 - half and second and then goes back so
08:44 - now you can see this is working just how
08:46 - we want it and if we start if I start at
08:48 - actually playing here we can see that
08:51 - our game is is quite
08:53 - fun to play great of course if you want
08:57 - to make this game harder you can add
08:59 - some randomness to whenever it hits a
09:02 - player so that you can't quite predict
09:04 - the X velocity and you can do this
09:07 - inside of the Impala control script here
09:11 - with the on collision enter you can
09:13 - simply add some random Y velocity using
09:18 - random range so that's your challenge
09:20 - for you to figure out and please if you
09:23 - can get it to work
09:24 - write it in the comments so that other
09:26 - people can can use it also great so
09:30 - that's pretty much it for the first part
09:33 - of this video that's just actually the
09:36 - whole video let's just first off when we
09:39 - hit play now because the velocity is is
09:43 - higher it can sometimes looks like it
09:46 - looked like the ball is going through
09:48 - our players especially if we bump it up
09:51 - even more it really depends on your
09:53 - frame rate and my frame rate is not too
09:55 - great because I'm recording but if we
09:58 - just try to bump up the ball speed by
10:00 - selecting the ball and changing the ball
10:03 - speed to let's say 130 and now hit play
10:06 - let's see if I can catch it we can see
10:10 - that it looks like the ball is colliding
10:12 - all kinds of weird ways and really with
10:16 - a good frame weight it should look like
10:17 - the ball is coming in and then going
10:20 - right past and then bouncing off so just
10:23 - to avoid these weird kinds of collisions
10:26 - I'm going to first of all keep the ball
10:29 - speed at about 100 you can go up to 130
10:32 - if needed but I'm also going to select
10:34 - the player here both players and then
10:38 - I'm going to take the Box Collider
10:41 - exercise and I'm just going to bump this
10:44 - up a bit so just bump it up to something
10:46 - like 0.45 let's do 4 3 and that just
10:54 - makes the collider more solid and it
10:56 - will just give an overall better results
10:58 - so when we now play it's just more solid
11:02 - and it reacts better to the bowl that's
11:05 - something to play around with
11:06 - until it works for you again it really
11:09 - depends on the framerate the size of
11:11 - your game all that's weird stuff so
11:14 - that's basically it for this video I
11:17 - know it was pretty short compared to
11:19 - many others but next time we can go
11:22 - ahead and do some sound break so if you
11:25 - just want a quick teaser maybe you can
11:29 - see here in the 2d assets pack I've
11:31 - found some audio I found some game over
11:34 - audio which have made a bonus audio and
11:37 - a hit audio so I'm not going to play it
11:39 - but that's for next time so thanks for
11:41 - watching and I'll see you in the next
11:43 - video
