00:00 - [Music]
00:02 - hello everyone and welcome to the 10th
00:05 - video in our survival game series done
00:08 - by practice I am the CEO of Brad keys
00:10 - and today we are going to take a look at
00:12 - the tree generation tool in unity and
00:17 - all just pimping up the terrain so if we
00:21 - go ahead and open up unity let's start
00:25 - out by simply making our project pane
00:29 - look a little better so right click
00:33 - create folder and we could call this
00:38 - materials and select all of the
00:45 - materials and simply drag them and we
00:49 - could also make one for the textures
00:53 - again new folder and call it textures
00:57 - and drag each and every one of the
01:00 - textures right so on if we go ahead and
01:04 - right-click in the project pane and then
01:07 - import asset and then import the tree
01:13 - creator it's going to go ahead and
01:16 - import everything we need this can take
01:22 - a little while depending on the
01:24 - complexity of your project right so now
01:30 - we are pretty much ready to get started
01:32 - so first of all you can see that we have
01:37 - a new option under the terrain called
01:40 - refresh tree and detailed prototypes and
01:43 - if we go ahead and inspect the folder
01:46 - that is now in our project pane so
01:49 - double click the standard assets you can
01:51 - see that we have a folder called tree
01:54 - creator and in here is a big tree which
01:59 - is already generated so if I drag this
02:01 - in you can see looking pretty good and
02:04 - if we select it you can see how it was
02:07 - built in the right hand side in the
02:09 - hierarchy
02:10 - I'll go ahead and delete this once again
02:16 - and if we go back into the tree creator
02:22 - you can see our different sources the
02:25 - materials some leaves and some textures
02:29 - alright so we could go ahead and simply
02:34 - make a new tree so go to game object
02:37 - create other and then tree and now you
02:43 - can start to see all of the detail we
02:46 - can change all of the attributes that we
02:50 - can simply change inside of unity and
02:53 - the tree will react in the scene so if
02:57 - we go ahead and drag this out a bit and
03:01 - soo-min on it by selecting it in the
03:04 - scene view and hitting F so we get a
03:08 - good look first of all in the right hand
03:14 - side in the inspector window we have a
03:17 - slider called the tree seed and you can
03:21 - see the value here is pretty huge that's
03:25 - because this is simply on the number
03:29 - that defines which kind of randomly
03:33 - generated tree we are going to use so if
03:37 - I just drag this along unity is going to
03:41 - create all the different kinds of trees
03:43 - that can emerge from the randomized
03:46 - settings that we have set so if I take
03:50 - the if I mess with some of these
03:55 - settings then this will also change so
04:01 - this is simply the seed that is going to
04:03 - change once we create a lot of different
04:07 - trees alright so um you can go ahead and
04:11 - manipulate some of these settings now I
04:16 - will leave them be the interesting parts
04:19 - come when we start to select the branch
04:22 - itself
04:24 - so this is a branch group and here's the
04:29 - branch note itself so if we select this
04:34 - and look over in the scene view you can
04:38 - see this purple line going through the
04:41 - tree and these different squares on the
04:44 - way the squares are waypoint for the
04:49 - generation of the tree so simply these
04:53 - can be moved these can be selected and
04:56 - dragged so and by doing this we can
05:00 - create our own kind of shape so you can
05:04 - simply manipulate these as you would
05:07 - with any other game object and we can
05:09 - create trees all on our own
05:12 - so again we have a group seed we have a
05:16 - frequency of how many trees are going to
05:19 - be spawned inside of the if we select
05:24 - the other you note the tree root node
05:28 - inside of the area spread so simply how
05:32 - many trees are going to be spawned
05:34 - inside of this variable so that's the
05:37 - frequency and let's pump it up so we can
05:42 - get something like a group of smaller
05:46 - branches the distribution meaning how
05:54 - they are going to be planted whether
05:57 - it's going to be completely random
05:59 - really it's going to be on a straight
06:01 - line if it's going to make cross a cross
06:06 - or other kinds of shapes so that is
06:11 - something again to play around with the
06:13 - growth scale simply is how long the
06:18 - different trees are going to get the
06:22 - growth angle as you can see simply
06:26 - rotates the trees based on their lowest
06:31 - point the little circle
06:33 - all right so I'm moving on we can we
06:38 - have the geometry category and if we
06:42 - crank up and down the LOD multiplier see
06:46 - if I can get this working I'm not really
06:49 - I guess this will do then you know what
06:57 - let's leave this as is for now so let's
07:05 - go ahead and move on to the material so
07:08 - here I have just loaded up some of the
07:11 - basic some of the materials in my scene
07:16 - in my project pane let's try them with
07:19 - the big tree branch this comes with the
07:23 - tree generator and you can create some
07:25 - on your own or download some from the
07:28 - asset store so as you can see this
07:32 - creates a texture and a material and it
07:37 - is completely tileable so it will figure
07:40 - out the UV itself so that's pretty handy
07:46 - the break material will ignore that for
07:49 - now the length the length of the
07:52 - branches without affecting the max point
07:57 - we have the relative length so that
08:04 - changes the way they scale and if we
08:07 - just drag out some of the arrows we can
08:10 - change how big the difference between
08:13 - how big they can get that's simply
08:18 - simply the difference right so remember
08:22 - all these settings are based on the fact
08:24 - that these are randomly generated the
08:28 - radius how wide are the trace gonna play
08:31 - and the cap smoothing how smooth the
08:38 - crink Glynnis the twirling the sikh son
08:47 - I think that this is going to help them
08:50 - yes assembly point towards the Sun a
08:54 - little bit uh curliness and the noise
08:59 - against whirling and the scaling of the
09:03 - noise and we have the break chance so
09:10 - this was will help out if your computer
09:13 - is having difficulty and the wind if you
09:17 - want to apply wind zones but for now
09:21 - we'll leave this be so that's basically
09:27 - the generate a general idea of creating
09:31 - trees and branches now let's go ahead
09:33 - and create some leaves so if we take
09:37 - down the frequency but bring up the
09:41 - scale so the overall length and the
09:46 - width let me see the radius here you can
09:51 - get some bigger trees that might have
09:53 - leaves and if we go into at the top of
09:58 - the higher you can create a leaf group
10:04 - so just let the computer thing for a
10:07 - minute and there you go so we can select
10:12 - our leaves and we can go down and give
10:18 - them a material so go under the
10:21 - materials and then select a leaf
10:26 - material this one is all right we can go
10:31 - ahead and increase the size or what the
10:40 - size
10:41 - hmm I'm how I'm having some trouble
10:48 - convert to procedural yeah okay so the
10:52 - groups were inputs procedural I might
10:55 - have edited them by hand
10:58 - by mistake so if you get that simply
11:00 - click that you want them to be
11:02 - procedural so now we can change the
11:04 - frequency to create more leaves and we
11:06 - can go ahead and change the material to
11:08 - make them look pretty there you go and
11:16 - okay this will need some tweaking so if
11:21 - again all hand editing should not be we
11:26 - can distribute them just like the trees
11:29 - in different ways I'll just choose where
11:35 - and them though and we can change the
11:39 - size of the leaves the alignment and the
11:48 - wind it's the turbulence of the leaves
11:53 - all right so that's how you create
12:01 - leaves so Panna
12:05 - for now I'll go ahead and delete these
12:07 - leaves once again by selecting them in
12:10 - the hierarchy and pressing the trashcan
12:16 - and now we can go ahead and create a new
12:21 - branch group like this so this allows us
12:29 - to create branches on the base of our
12:31 - tree and we'll select again the branch
12:35 - big tree branch material working with
12:42 - the cheat tree generator can be a little
12:45 - slow though
12:46 - okay so let's play around with the
12:50 - frequency I want this to be pretty low
12:52 - and the distribution I think this could
12:57 - be random yeah this this looks pretty
13:03 - good
13:05 - the length again play around with this
13:09 - and again all these settings are not the
13:13 - same except there are emitting from the
13:17 - branch the main branch itself so we
13:23 - could go ahead and select our arms these
13:29 - circles and move the branches up and
13:32 - down this way so we can get them to be
13:35 - at the top of the tree like this and
13:41 - this allows us to if we go ahead and OH
13:48 - convert to the procedural bump up the
13:51 - frequency a bit make the make them point
13:58 - upwards so play around with the
14:01 - different kinds of spread at the button
14:05 - to make it look better and pull and the
14:09 - krinkle nests these seek Sun we can make
14:15 - them point upwards and yeah this looks
14:20 - pretty good so now we could go ahead and
14:22 - edit them by hand so we won't have all
14:27 - the branches at the bottom right so now
14:33 - on top of this we can create a leaf
14:36 - group and now we can crank up the
14:44 - frequency quite a bit to change the
14:49 - material and there we go so now the
14:57 - trees look a lot better play around with
15:00 - it until you find something you really
15:02 - like and and there you go that's how to
15:07 - use the tree generator in unity I hope
15:11 - you enjoyed this tutorial if you haven't
15:14 - already checked out our website it's
15:18 - looking really good
15:21 - I'll just open it up so you can see it
15:23 - so we have a lot of different things
15:26 - here there are still some minor box that
15:28 - needs to be fixed
15:30 - basically it syncs with everything our
15:32 - Facebook our Twitter so it's a good
15:34 - place to stay in stain shield we I have
15:38 - a block going well right about some of
15:41 - the news on our site and our Learning
15:44 - Network in general also some of the news
15:47 - on our games and there you can all all
15:51 - already download all of our games if we
15:56 - go to the portfolio you can see you can
15:58 - download kill pill and see now is the
16:00 - game
16:01 - and also if we go under the create a
16:05 - survival game tutorial series you can
16:08 - read about it you can watch it and you
16:11 - can of course download all the assets
16:14 - that I create outside of the videos the
16:17 - scripts that are typed
16:19 - also so everything that we use that
16:22 - isn't created inside of unity itself and
16:25 - isn't as and is a script or a model or
16:33 - anything like that
16:34 - you can download it as a raw file and
16:37 - simply use it for whatever you want it's
16:42 - completely free so go ahead and do that
16:44 - if you have trouble keeping up and also
16:47 - we have added a donate function if you
16:50 - want to just buy me a cup of coffee so
16:54 - I'm that was it for now thanks for
16:57 - watching the video and I'll see you in
16:59 - the next one
17:00 - Oh
17:07 - [Music]
