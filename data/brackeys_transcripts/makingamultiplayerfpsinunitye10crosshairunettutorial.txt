00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello and
00:04 - welcome to video number 10 on making a
00:06 - multiplayer FPS in unity in today's
00:08 - video we're going to have a look at
00:09 - creating three different things so first
00:11 - up will be disabling the graphics for
00:14 - our look local player so that they want
00:17 - going through front of the camera and be
00:19 - annoying so that's kind of an important
00:22 - fix to make second we are going to be
00:25 - adding our first player GUI element
00:27 - which is going to be a crosshair and
00:29 - third we are going to be removing the
00:31 - warn warnings that has been displaying
00:34 - in the console since we last updated
00:36 - unity so the version of unity that I'm
00:38 - going to be using today is five point
00:40 - three point one and at the end of this
00:43 - tutorial we should be warning free so
00:45 - that's awesome
00:45 - another thing that's awesome is that
00:47 - this is already video number ten I'm
00:49 - really enjoying making this series I
00:51 - hope you're enjoying watching it too if
00:53 - you are you know what to do so let's
00:55 - jump right into today's video cool so
00:58 - you can see here that I've already
00:59 - opened up unity five point three point
01:01 - one and pretty much everything is as we
01:05 - left at last and you can see that we
01:07 - have these annoying console warnings so
01:10 - I just don't bother look to look at them
01:13 - right now what we are going to bring our
01:17 - attention to at first is the disabling
01:20 - of this annoying graphic here so when we
01:24 - go and host this you can see that our
01:26 - player graphics are in the game which is
01:28 - great but we can also see them for our
01:31 - local player which is kind of not so
01:32 - great so we want to kind of disable
01:35 - these and the method that I want to be
01:37 - using in order to do this is by using
01:40 - the building culling mask functionality
01:43 - of the unity camera so if we go onto our
01:45 - player here and go to the camera object
01:47 - you can see that there's a property here
01:49 - called culling mask and it's currently
01:51 - set to everything what this allows us to
01:54 - do is we can add a layer and add certain
01:58 - game objects to that layer and then
02:00 - uncheck that layer from this list and
02:02 - then it won't be drawn simply none of
02:06 - the shadows will be drawn on
02:08 - none of the graphics or particles
02:10 - anything on that layer won't be drawn so
02:14 - that's really really easy to do and it's
02:16 - going to function quite well so let's
02:19 - start by adding a new layer so let me go
02:21 - to add layer here and the layer that we
02:24 - want to add we're simply going to call
02:26 - it don't draw it's very easy make sure
02:29 - you spell this correctly throughout the
02:31 - tutorial that's very important of course
02:33 - then we can go to the camera go into the
02:36 - culling mask and simply disable don't
02:38 - draw and now everything is going to draw
02:41 - except what is on the don't draw layer
02:43 - you can of course also disable up this
02:45 - stuff here too ah great so what we then
02:50 - need to do is you might think well let's
02:52 - go into the graphics and change the
02:54 - layer here to don't draw no because then
02:57 - when we spawn in the player fall of the
02:59 - difference are clients that are
03:02 - connected none of the graphics are going
03:05 - to draw because it's going to spawn with
03:07 - the don't draw layer associated to it
03:10 - so what we're going to do instead is
03:11 - we're going to set this through script
03:13 - only if we are the local player and a
03:16 - pretty relevant and place to do that
03:19 - would be in the player setup script so
03:21 - let's double click that to open it up in
03:23 - visual studio and we'll just add a few
03:25 - lines of codes to this and so show you a
03:28 - pretty nifty way to do it then we add a
03:32 - serialize field here and this is going
03:34 - to be a string and that's of course
03:36 - going to store the name of our layer you
03:40 - could just hard code this in but I'm
03:41 - going to stick to the convention that
03:43 - we've made here where we have the layer
03:46 - names available in the inspector so this
03:48 - is going to be the don't draw layer name
03:52 - and that's simply going to default to
03:54 - don't draw there we go and next up I
03:59 - simply want a slot here serialized field
04:02 - which is going to be a game object and
04:05 - this is going to be a reference to our
04:07 - player graphic so player graphics there
04:11 - we go
04:12 - then in the start method you can see
04:13 - that we check if we are not the local
04:16 - player well then we want to disable some
04:17 - components that we only want to
04:20 - the local player to have enabled such as
04:22 - movement but this is quite the opposite
04:24 - so we go down into the else statement
04:25 - here where we disabled our scene camera
04:28 - and just below that we can arm disabled
04:34 - player graphics for local player and the
04:41 - way that we do this is by making a
04:43 - method ourselves which is going to be
04:46 - the arm set layer recursively so we're
04:50 - going to add this in recursively I think
04:54 - that's how you spell it and it's going
04:57 - to beg oh we're going to pass in our
05:00 - player graphics and the layer but we're
05:05 - going to pass in the layer as an integer
05:07 - so to convert it we go to layer mask dot
05:11 - name to layer that will take in the
05:14 - string and find it and return the index
05:17 - as an integer so we simply pass in here
05:20 - the don't draw layer name and close that
05:23 - off and a semicolon so we haven't
05:26 - actually created this method yet but
05:28 - it's very very easy and handy so this is
05:31 - the first recursive function that we've
05:34 - made and what is a recursive method I
05:39 - don't want to go into too much technical
05:41 - 'ti with this but basically we're making
05:43 - a method that is calling itself so we
05:46 - are making itself referring our method
05:49 - and that sounds very scary and you
05:52 - definitely have to be careful because if
05:54 - you you can very easily get into an
05:57 - infinite loop and if you do that inside
05:59 - let's say the update method or then the
06:02 - next frame is never going to be reached
06:04 - and therefore your game is going to
06:06 - crash
06:06 - so recursive methods are definitely
06:08 - dangerous but just think about them very
06:11 - hard before you actually implement them
06:14 - in the game or at least test them out so
06:17 - we're going to make a void method here
06:18 - and it's simply going to be called set
06:21 - layer recursively there we go and it's
06:25 - going to take in the game object objects
06:27 - and then the layer which is going to be
06:32 - an integer and that's going to be the
06:33 - new layer here so what this method will
06:37 - do is it will of course change the layer
06:40 - of the object that we've set here but it
06:44 - will also change the layer of all of the
06:48 - child objects because unity doesn't
06:51 - actually have a good way of doing this
06:53 - and that's why we are making this method
06:56 - so what we first wanted to do is change
06:58 - the object layer here so simply say oh
07:01 - btw eight that layer equals new layer
07:04 - then we want to loop through all of the
07:07 - different child objects and do the same
07:09 - for those so we're going to say for each
07:12 - and then we're going to say transform
07:15 - we're going to call it child in obj
07:19 - transform so that's going to go through
07:21 - all of our different child objects and
07:24 - refer to them as child and you might be
07:29 - thinking well then we simply say child
07:30 - dot game object dot layer equals new
07:35 - layer and that's fine if you only want
07:38 - to loop through all of the different
07:40 - child children and set them equal to a
07:44 - new layer this is not a recursive method
07:46 - and the problem with this is that it
07:48 - won't affect children of children or our
07:52 - children further down the hierarchy so
07:54 - this will only go through the first
07:57 - children that it finds and that's a
07:59 - problem because we wanted to change all
08:01 - of the stuff under our graphics object
08:04 - so what we do instead and some of you
08:08 - might have figured this out is we call
08:10 - the set layer recursively function so we
08:13 - call the method inside the method and we
08:16 - pass in child dot game object and again
08:21 - just the new layer so the first time
08:24 - that and we go through this it takes the
08:27 - player graphics call set an object sets
08:30 - it equal to the layer that we've passed
08:31 - in here then it goes through all of the
08:34 - children off the player graphics object
08:38 - and it calls the same method here so for
08:42 - the first children child it's going to
08:44 - set the layer
08:46 - it's going to look at all of those
08:47 - children and do the same and you can see
08:49 - it very quickly branches out through the
08:52 - hierarchy so if you have a lot of
08:53 - different nested objects this is going
08:55 - to require a lot of processing so it
08:58 - might not be the cheapest method but
09:01 - it's going to work just fine for our
09:02 - purposes because we're only doing this
09:04 - in the start method and frankly we don't
09:07 - have that many game objects so that's
09:09 - going to be just fine and that's
09:12 - basically all we needed to do I think so
09:14 - let's jump back into unity here you can
09:16 - see that I'm getting some weird errors
09:17 - here and I think you can just ignore
09:19 - those and those are errors from unity so
09:25 - now if we simply hit play I think we
09:28 - should be able to try this out so let's
09:30 - go into land host and no of course we
09:34 - forgot to reference on the player
09:36 - graphics here so expand that prefab go
09:39 - on the camera and drag that in there
09:41 - excuse me I'm just going to have a sip
09:43 - of water here and we can keep going good
09:48 - so make sure you reference the camera
09:51 - and that this layer name is correct and
09:53 - let's try this again so I play LAN host
09:57 - and something is not working let's go
10:02 - through here and see okay so these
10:05 - aren't actually being set for some
10:08 - recent unities throwing a bunch of
10:10 - errors here and I'm kind of afraid that
10:12 - that's the reason that this is not
10:15 - working so you know what I'm going to do
10:17 - I'm just going to quickly restart unity
10:20 - here and I will be right back with you
10:22 - so just give me one second and I'll be
10:25 - back
10:25 - okay so I've looked at bit around here
10:27 - and also done some searching on the
10:29 - internet and I actually found out what
10:31 - was wrong with our game so the reason
10:35 - for these errors is something that I has
10:38 - been wrong with the unity editor for a
10:39 - little while now concerning certain
10:42 - particle systems that are set up and the
10:45 - behavior is really weird and only
10:46 - happens on some systems and I'm
10:49 - definitely going to write out a back
10:50 - report but it's not something that
10:52 - actually breaks the game so I think
10:54 - we're just going to be continuing here
10:56 - and the reason why the other stuff
10:58 - wasn't working
10:59 - it's because I forgot that it's not the
11:01 - camera that we need to drag in here it's
11:03 - the graphics object there we go so now
11:05 - it works and the last thing that I
11:08 - decided to do here was that I was
11:10 - messing around with ways to get these
11:12 - are warnings to disappear and I found
11:15 - out that of course was the particle
11:17 - systems under the thrusters that we're
11:20 - causing the problem and then I had a
11:23 - look at this this model once again and I
11:25 - actually decided that I liked it better
11:27 - without the thrusters I kind of liked
11:29 - the way it looks here just as this round
11:32 - bowl thing so that's what I'm going to
11:34 - be going for for now at least until
11:37 - unity fixes this error if you want me to
11:40 - look into this more I can of course do
11:42 - so and then I suggest you leave a
11:44 - comment or go to the forums and they'll
11:46 - definitely help you out but it's not
11:48 - something that we have time for on to
11:51 - look more into in this video and frankly
11:54 - not something that I might be able to
11:55 - solve it if it's a deep problem within
11:58 - unity so I'm just going to be disabling
12:00 - those now and you can disable the
12:01 - particle system so we try and mess
12:03 - around with them there's plenty of
12:05 - information on this on the phone if you
12:07 - are getting the same warnings or errors
12:09 - cool so I'm just going to hit apply on
12:11 - this guy now and delete him and we
12:14 - should be seeing this working so we go
12:17 - under then host you can see and then of
12:20 - course it doesn't so wait I must have
12:22 - screwed something up if we go into the
12:24 - camera here yeah of course I uncheck the
12:27 - don't draw there I believe I check that
12:29 - back on when experimenting so now you
12:31 - can see that everything is drawing in
12:34 - this scene and this is how it will
12:35 - appear to other players but inside of
12:39 - the local view here you see nothing
12:41 - nothing is obstructing the camera and
12:44 - you can see that the shadow is also gone
12:46 - which I kind of like so that was
12:49 - actually fairly easy at some point we
12:51 - might make a separate method for drawing
12:53 - the gun if say you don't want the shadow
12:55 - down here or two in order to fix our
12:58 - clipping issues like these it's not too
13:02 - bad with this gun but it might get worse
13:04 - with others and will maybe have a look
13:06 - at that at some other point but that's
13:08 - going to be fine for now
13:09 - so onto point two of this we
13:12 - which was making the cross here so let's
13:16 - start by actually making the asset I'm
13:18 - going to be using Photoshop for this I'm
13:21 - going to of course include it in both
13:23 - the github project which you can
13:25 - download and in the assets pack which
13:27 - you will find on the practice website
13:31 - under this project of course and you can
13:35 - also find your own on the internet it's
13:37 - very easy to make this kind of stuff or
13:39 - find it and there's much of lots of
13:42 - royalty-free
13:43 - on the cross hairs on the internet so
13:46 - I'm just going to call this crosshair
13:48 - and there are a bunch of ways to design
13:50 - a crosshair first off double click on
13:52 - the background rename this BT and let's
13:55 - fill that out with a gray color and yeah
14:01 - let's just quickly add something in here
14:03 - so let's go and do the ellipse tool here
14:07 - and let's set the radius here to
14:09 - something like 10 pixels the color is
14:14 - going to be white and let's try and drag
14:16 - something out here um I'm also going to
14:19 - whoops I want that to still be there but
14:21 - drag down some guidelines so we can find
14:24 - the center of our canvas and that looks
14:29 - actually kind of decent might need to
14:32 - move that in a bit or some be scale that
14:35 - in here so that we have room for a
14:38 - stroke around it later it's actually too
14:42 - much scaling there we go I'm simply
14:44 - going to duplicate this and move it over
14:46 - here also select these to duplicate them
14:50 - again I'm using ctrl J to duplicate them
14:52 - and simply rotate them around here and
14:56 - in order to rotate them I'm using shift
15:00 - or first off I press ctrl T and to bring
15:04 - up the transform controls and then shift
15:06 - and rotate so that's kind of how I was
15:09 - doing that and this looks very decent
15:12 - except that we have a off by one pixel
15:16 - here so I think that we are going to
15:18 - give this canvas one more pixel to work
15:21 - with I know that this is kind of
15:23 - forbidden
15:25 - but it's going to be good don't worry
15:29 - so there we go and that kind of
15:33 - introduce some artifacting so let's do
15:36 - that let's find the different pieces
15:40 - here that's that one we're going to move
15:42 - that one over and these have course not
15:45 - correct anymore so that's the center
15:47 - there and that's the center there and
15:50 - this is already looking better so now we
15:54 - can take the bottom one and move that
16:00 - down and for some wheat reason this is
16:05 - still looking kind of wrong can't quite
16:09 - put a finger on what it is something is
16:12 - still off here so it might be the bottom
16:17 - crosshair that we need to move up
16:18 - actually yeah that was was that was what
16:23 - was wrong and we can take yeah so this
16:29 - whole thing is not going to be exactly
16:31 - centered on the image but that's alright
16:33 - because now we're going to be adding a
16:35 - stroke so let's just add a group for
16:38 - these just call this crosshair add all
16:42 - of these to the crosshair group and
16:45 - double click on that go on this stroke
16:47 - and I'm just going to add a simple black
16:50 - stroke here that's going to be fine and
16:52 - this already looks kind of decent so
16:55 - that's cool and we can of course just
16:59 - crop this image to fit there we go so
17:04 - hide the guidelines pressing ctrl H hide
17:07 - the background and let's save this so
17:10 - I'm just going to save mine under
17:14 - projects multiplayer FPS multiplayer FPS
17:18 - assets and then make a folder called GUI
17:22 - and it's save it just as a crosshair you
17:26 - remember you can save Photoshop files
17:27 - directly into unity and it's going to
17:29 - work just fine so we have the crosshair
17:31 - here that's changed the texture type to
17:33 - sprite and UI and
17:37 - let's hit true color bilinear apply cool
17:42 - so now we can go inside of the hierarchy
17:45 - right click go on the UI then select
17:48 - image go into the canvas make sure you
17:50 - select pixel perfect go back to the
17:53 - image we set that you can focus in on
17:57 - this change the 2d mode so we've reset
18:01 - that you can also Center it by holding
18:03 - down alt and clicking here and then we
18:06 - want to set the native size after we've
18:10 - dragged in the crosshair there so
18:13 - dragging the crosshair hit select native
18:15 - size and you might be thinking that this
18:17 - is a bit too big and so what we can do
18:20 - is simply scale this down so we can go
18:21 - and do the image size and we can bump
18:25 - this down to whatever you would like to
18:27 - so I'm trying 24 something like that hit
18:34 - set native size and I actually think
18:36 - this looks pretty damn good so let's try
18:39 - and hit play here going to land host and
18:42 - you can see just how that looks this
18:45 - might actually be a bit too large for me
18:48 - so what we can do instead is we can take
18:51 - some of these simply scale them down a
18:54 - bit so there we go there we go and I'm
18:59 - not going to be spending forever on this
19:01 - you might want to correct it so that
19:03 - this is actually a complete square with
19:11 - equal sides and all that it's not
19:14 - something that I'm too worried about
19:17 - right now at least I think this is going
19:20 - to be fine and you can see this and this
19:22 - one for some reason looks a bit off
19:24 - compared to the others so this is the
19:27 - kind of stuff that you should definitely
19:29 - sit down and get working when you make
19:36 - this so okay so I'm actually kind of
19:38 - satisfied with this we could try just
19:40 - point filtering it doesn't make it a
19:43 - huge difference so I'm just going to
19:45 - stick with bilinear for now good
19:48 - so let's rename this to crosshair
19:51 - and the canvas here to play you I and
19:56 - what we can do is we can add a small few
20:02 - or a few lines to the setup script that
20:05 - will spawn this in once the player
20:07 - spawns and again remove it once he
20:10 - disconnects so let's go under our player
20:14 - setup script double click that open it
20:15 - up in Visual Studio once again and this
20:19 - is very easy so what we're going to do
20:23 - here is add a new field serialize field
20:27 - and this is going to be a game object
20:30 - and it's going to store the player UI
20:35 - prefab then we are going to have a
20:38 - private game object which is going to be
20:42 - the player UI instance there we go then
20:46 - in the start method if we are the local
20:50 - player down here after we disable the
20:53 - player graphics well then we want to us
20:56 - create player UI
20:59 - we do that by simply instantiating it so
21:03 - instantiate and we want to instantiate
21:06 - the player UI prefab there we go and
21:10 - it's just going to be 0 0 0 position
21:12 - scale and all that our scale is going to
21:15 - be vector 3 that one of course and then
21:18 - we can set the player UI instance equal
21:23 - to that instantiation so that's going to
21:26 - work just fine and if we want we can
21:29 - also say that player UI that instance
21:32 - dot name should be equal to player UI
21:37 - prefab dot name that way we get rid of
21:41 - the clone pattern that's not something
21:43 - that looks very pretty in the hierarchy
21:45 - and then down here on disable when we
21:47 - are cleaning up we enabling the scene
21:49 - camera and unregistering the player we
21:52 - can also of course
21:54 - destroy the player UI again so we're
21:58 - simply going to say player or destroy
22:02 - player UI in
22:04 - since pain and that's all we need to do
22:08 - so let's try and hit play here we are
22:11 - not going to be seeing oops we are not
22:15 - going to be seen any crosshair when we
22:18 - begin because we need to remove this I
22:21 - always give a few steps apparently so
22:23 - I'm just going to remove the clip play
22:25 - that so let's make a prefab out of this
22:27 - do we have a prefabs folder we do not
22:30 - yet and delete it then we are going to
22:33 - go into the player and that's going to
22:36 - be a new field under the player setup
22:38 - where we can drag in our player UI now
22:40 - we have play and there's no crosshair we
22:43 - join a game and there it is it's that
22:46 - easy and when we hit stop again
22:50 - the crosshair disappears so that's kind
22:55 - of dynamic and nice and we're just going
22:57 - to stick with that we can drag this
22:59 - player UI under the GUI folder for now
23:02 - we might have it in a prefab folder
23:04 - actually I want to create a prefabs
23:06 - folder I think that's a better idea so
23:07 - that let's just do that right there
23:11 - going to GUI get that bag in there and
23:14 - then into the prefabs folder that's much
23:17 - much nicer stay organized cool so now
23:20 - that we have all this functionality
23:21 - working all we need to do is clear up
23:23 - the console well now right now the
23:25 - console isn't exactly appearing so
23:28 - that's just quickly and this is a bit of
23:30 - a hacky way of doing things create an
23:32 - error here remove that error let unity
23:36 - recompile things and there we go the
23:38 - console warnings are back
23:40 - so on the first now once that you can
23:43 - see here on the ones that we have
23:45 - actually our cost and that's on to the
23:51 - player controller and that's because it
23:53 - used to use this kind of stupid thing
23:59 - called the join drive mode what this can
24:01 - actually just be deleted now so we are
24:03 - just going to completely remove that and
24:05 - also down here remove that mode it's
24:08 - save and boom all of those warnings
24:12 - disappear next up we actually have some
24:16 - warnings for
24:18 - the standard acids which for some reason
24:21 - iron appearing right now I can go ahead
24:24 - and just quickly restart the project
24:26 - here if some of you know a nicer way to
24:29 - get the warnings to appear I know you
24:31 - can be important but that takes a while
24:33 - I just like resetting the project if
24:38 - that actually would cause them ok for
24:40 - some reason there aren't displaying at
24:43 - the moment that might because because of
24:46 - some recent update but anyways some of
24:50 - these are actually also casting causing
24:53 - errors and I remember all warnings I
24:55 - remember which one of them it is so the
24:58 - event system checker and that's
25:01 - something that I want to get rid of
25:02 - let's just read out that and close that
25:05 - there we go oh here they are
25:08 - okay so here we can see all of them so
25:11 - we have the touch input okay so this is
25:15 - on the scripts mobile that's
25:16 - cross-platform we have a bunch under the
25:18 - utility here so we have the forced reset
25:22 - let's just find that forced reset there
25:25 - I'm just going to delete them
25:27 - I'm simply deleting these files because
25:29 - we aren't actually using them and then
25:31 - we have the time object activator that's
25:35 - this one not the destructor we also have
25:40 - recorded the console we also have the
25:43 - particle system destroyer there we go of
25:46 - course if you are using these you should
25:49 - go in there and clean up the code but
25:51 - since we aren't or I am not using these
25:53 - I'm simply going to delete them because
25:54 - they're just using space anyways you can
25:58 - always always reemployed these and
26:00 - therefore just want them out of my
26:02 - project it was annoying enough to have
26:04 - them there when they weren't causing
26:05 - errors and then we can go under our
26:07 - standard assets particle systems scripts
26:10 - and we should find the water hose
26:14 - particle script let's delete that and
26:17 - finally if we go under cross-platform
26:20 - scripts and then find the mobile control
26:25 - rig and let's delete that too so now we
26:29 - have a working project we have
26:31 - project where we can see our own player
26:34 - model which is great we don't get any
26:37 - warnings and we have introduced the
26:39 - first player UI element so that was
26:42 - basically all I had to show for this
26:44 - tutorial I hope you liked it and I'll
26:46 - see you in the next one
