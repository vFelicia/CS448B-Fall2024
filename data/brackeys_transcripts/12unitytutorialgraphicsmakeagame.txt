00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello
00:04 - everyone num will come to video number
00:05 - 12 and make a game a cool series on
00:08 - making a video game in unity today we
00:11 - have a bunch of things to do
00:14 - so here's the to-do list we have to fix
00:16 - a bunch of things just tweak some
00:18 - settings and we're going to add some
00:21 - cool visuals so I've made a model and
00:23 - some edit some normal Maps so we're
00:27 - going to talk about all that this video
00:30 - might be pretty long but we're just
00:31 - gonna have added and if it gets too much
00:33 - I'll split it up into parts but before
00:36 - we get started I want to quickly plug
00:39 - something I've made because a lot of
00:41 - people always ask me well you have a
00:43 - donate function but I don't have any
00:45 - mind money and I want to support
00:47 - brackets so what can I do and to help
00:50 - you support me what I've done is I've
00:53 - made a wallpaper pack like the one you
00:57 - see here and you can download them at
01:02 - breaky Starcom slash wallpapers if you
01:05 - want to spread the word about braggy so
01:07 - just plain show-off and there are a lot
01:10 - of cool wallpapers here you can see some
01:11 - of them here and you can download all of
01:14 - the HD versions so please go ahead and
01:17 - do that and set them as your desktop
01:18 - background I'm sure it will help spread
01:21 - the word so cool now that we have the
01:24 - introduction out of the way let's go
01:26 - ahead and open up a unity so first thing
01:30 - on our list is the ball control script
01:32 - and this is because we have some kind of
01:36 - clunky logic in there that I just want
01:39 - to clean up in the last video I went
01:42 - ahead and did something that was way
01:45 - more difficult than it had to be and
01:47 - that was because I was experiencing some
01:50 - problems with the on collision enter
01:54 - function but those problems are fixed
01:57 - now so we can go ahead and clean up the
02:00 - script cried a bit so first thing to do
02:04 - is we want to get rid of all of this
02:07 - play once umm no another one yeah that
02:11 - one too so that yeah first off that's
02:13 - clean now
02:13 - the audio I think that'd be best so we
02:16 - can just get it rid of this play once
02:18 - variable because instead of doing all
02:21 - this play once checking we can go ahead
02:24 - and and use the on collision entry so
02:27 - delete the variable delete all the
02:30 - places that it's used also the play ones
02:33 - true function so delete that delete the
02:38 - function itself down here and delete the
02:42 - if statement here and there we should be
02:46 - good to go
02:47 - and now we take all of this audio logic
02:51 - here and we just cut it so control X or
02:54 - command X if you're on a Mac and then we
02:57 - make another function call function on
03:01 - collision enter and we open up some
03:08 - brackets and in here we'll just copy all
03:12 - of this and if you select all of it and
03:15 - do shift tab you can move everything
03:17 - backwards so now this will just be much
03:21 - simpler we don't need to call all kinds
03:23 - of different functions it will simply
03:25 - play the sound whenever it collides with
03:28 - them with something cool now in the on
03:34 - collision stay we are gonna change this
03:38 - because on collision stay is not always
03:41 - that reliable and the problem right now
03:44 - with jumping is that if we for example
03:49 - let's say if we go into unity here and
03:52 - hit whoops
03:53 - oh we I forgot oh yeah so there is to
03:58 - play once we need to delete that also so
04:00 - just delete every trace there is left of
04:03 - the play ones variable we don't need it
04:05 - but if we go in now and hit play and we
04:09 - jump up to a side so I might not be able
04:13 - to hit this but if we just collide with
04:16 - the side of the ground we're able to
04:18 - jump again like this and that's not
04:21 - really something we want we want to be
04:23 - make sure that our player stands on the
04:25 - ground when he's able to jump
04:28 - so good way to do this and this is also
04:30 - pretty easy is just to delete this
04:34 - function on collisions day
04:36 - delete the is falling variable again
04:39 - delete all traces and the variable up
04:42 - here and instead of that let's make a
04:45 - new variable so we're going to call this
04:47 - dist to ground so that's for distance to
04:52 - ground and it's just going to be of type
04:55 - float so it's just going to be a number
04:57 - with decimals and this how we're going
05:02 - to declare that in the function start so
05:05 - let's make a function start here and
05:08 - instead of this we're going to write
05:10 - dist to ground
05:13 - equals Collider bounds dot extends dot y
05:22 - so basically what we're doing here is we
05:25 - are getting the distance from the center
05:28 - of our object to the outer boundaries of
05:32 - our Collider and this way we can check
05:35 - if we by sending out a array by sending
05:39 - out a line downwards we can check if
05:42 - this line hits something within or over
05:46 - the hour distance to the ground so we
05:50 - can basically say how far are we from
05:52 - the ground and so therefore determine if
05:55 - we're standing on it
05:56 - so if that all sounded too complicated
05:59 - I'm sorry just follow along here and it
06:02 - might make sense in that in a bit so
06:04 - we're just going to say here that we are
06:06 - getting the distance from the center to
06:13 - the ground that's what we're doing there
06:18 - cool so let's go ahead and make a
06:22 - separate function down here and let's
06:26 - call this function is grounded so this
06:32 - function is something we want to call
06:33 - whenever we are checking if if we are
06:39 - standing on the ground
06:41 - so just close off the parentheses and
06:44 - then do of type boolean so that's what
06:46 - we're going to return so that will allow
06:49 - us to check if we are grounded by
06:51 - calling this function and then let's
06:54 - open up the brackets here and then we
06:58 - want to write what we are going to
07:00 - return so just write which n and then
07:03 - we're going to do physics that raycast
07:06 - and then transform that position whoops
07:10 - that's a small T transform dot position
07:19 - comma minus vector three dot up so we're
07:27 - just going to shoot downwards that's why
07:29 - we have the minus comma this to ground
07:34 - and then we're just going to do plus
07:37 - something small just like zero point one
07:40 - because then we are going to make sure
07:41 - that we accounting stuff like rounding
07:48 - errors and such so we're just going to
07:50 - make sure that it will it will actually
07:54 - return the right value so cool basically
07:58 - what we're going to do we are doing here
08:00 - and I know it looks pretty weird but all
08:04 - you need to understand is that we are
08:06 - making a function called is grounded and
08:08 - we can call this to check if we are
08:11 - standing on the ground and what we're
08:13 - doing is we are sending a line down from
08:16 - the center of our ball so if I just
08:19 - browse back into unity here we are
08:23 - sending a line from the center here and
08:26 - then down and just checking if we if
08:31 - whatever it hits is inside of the
08:35 - boundary here so that's not simply all
08:37 - we're doing and so if it is it will
08:41 - return true and if it's not it will
08:45 - return nothing so what we can do is up
08:49 - here instead of and is falling is equal
08:53 - to false we can simply say
08:55 - and this grounded like this and then to
09:03 - parentheses and that's it so now when we
09:06 - go in hit play we can see that it
09:11 - working it's working just like before
09:13 - but now when we hit the sides and stuff
09:16 - we are not going to be able to jump and
09:18 - it's just a wall better practice to do
09:22 - it this way cool so now that we've
09:24 - cleaned that up I hope it wasn't too
09:27 - confusing but it's just a good way to do
09:31 - it and I just wanted to show you the the
09:33 - correct way of doing things per se so if
09:36 - we're just going to write let's say a
09:38 - little description here we're just going
09:40 - to check if we are on the ground return
09:47 - true if we are else return null cool so
09:56 - what we can do now is we can go ahead
09:58 - and find the next thing on our list so
10:02 - here yeah so next is the ball scale I
10:06 - just think that our ball here is a
10:09 - little bit too small when we get play
10:11 - it's just pretty small on the screen and
10:14 - this is a matter of preference but I
10:15 - would just like to bump it up to
10:17 - something like zero point 3 comma 0.3
10:21 - 0.3 so and now we might fall through now
10:27 - we are actually we didn't but I'm just
10:28 - going to move it up a bit so we are sure
10:31 - if never falling through the ground and
10:33 - yeah I just think that looks a little
10:35 - cooler and and that was basically it so
10:39 - that was a fast one next up is that
10:42 - we're going to apply new materials now
10:46 - the material we are using right now
10:48 - let's just go ahead and find it for a
10:51 - ball this the ball a wood and there's
10:54 - nothing wrong with this material it's
10:56 - just a simple diffuse material and of
10:59 - course we are using a diffuse because if
11:01 - we use the specular we would get these
11:04 - glowing effects and that not that
11:07 - doesn't really appear
11:08 - or in wood what is very diffused so we
11:13 - are using the right shader but we are
11:16 - only using one image and that's the
11:19 - normal color map or diffuse map but what
11:23 - you can do for added realism is you can
11:26 - use multiple images and for example you
11:31 - can use what is called a normal map and
11:33 - that's basically the same image but with
11:37 - different colors that tells the computer
11:40 - what is high and what is low so it will
11:44 - help light bounce off the object in a
11:48 - more realistic way because right now
11:50 - light bounces off the same way no matter
11:53 - where on the object but you know there
11:57 - are some things that are higher and
11:59 - something that are lower on this image
12:02 - so if we convert this into some data the
12:06 - computer can more realistically
12:07 - calculate lighting so what we can do is
12:10 - we can add this normal map and it's
12:13 - something that you can generate with a
12:15 - bunch of different programs I've gone
12:18 - ahead and made some in Photoshop here
12:20 - using Nvidia invidious tool the normal
12:25 - map filter so you can go ahead and
12:27 - download that if you're using Photoshop
12:28 - there are also some free alternatives
12:31 - for or if you want to generate some
12:33 - really easily you can buy a plugin like
12:37 - crazy bump or in do2 if I'm not
12:41 - mistaking something like that but just
12:44 - go ahead and write whatever solution
12:46 - you're using and there will be a guide
12:49 - showing you how to make these normal
12:51 - Maps but I of course generated some
12:55 - force so if we go into the Mac assets
12:58 - and these of course available at
13:00 - brackets calm we can go under the
13:03 - textures and now there is both the
13:06 - medieval bricks and a medieval bricks
13:09 - normal and so also one for the rough
13:11 - wood so let's just go ahead and import
13:15 - both these at the same time import them
13:18 - into unity
13:21 - and let's go ahead and apply this so
13:23 - first off let's find the material here
13:26 - on the ball the ball would and instead
13:29 - of diffuse we're going to change it to
13:30 - bumped diffuse so that's going to take
13:33 - in a normal map now you can see there's
13:34 - an extra slot and you need to make sure
13:38 - that the tiling on these are the exact
13:41 - same so I've already gone ahead and set
13:44 - the tiling to the same if they're not
13:46 - things are going to look very weird so
13:48 - just make sure that they're the same
13:50 - cool and now we can drag in our rough
13:53 - wood texture and you can see that right
13:56 - now it looks really weird and that's
13:59 - because our texture is not marked as a
14:02 - normal map and it will also tell us this
14:04 - down here so you can either hit fixed
14:06 - now which we are going to do I'll go
14:08 - into the rough wood and change the
14:10 - texture type to normal map but let's
14:12 - just take it fixed now and unity will do
14:15 - it for us so now we can see that light
14:18 - bounces off a little more realistically
14:21 - especially down here in the shadowed
14:24 - parts and you can go ahead and change
14:26 - this on and off if you want to see the
14:28 - effect on or off and how I'm sorry um
14:34 - how effective this method is depends on
14:39 - how you make your nominal map so you
14:42 - don't want it to be too apparent but
14:45 - it's I mean it's a matter of preference
14:48 - and I've generated this to be pretty
14:51 - subtle but let's just change it to
14:53 - diffuse and you can see things are a lot
14:55 - more smooth and if we change the back
14:58 - light is a little more realistic cool so
15:03 - now that we have that done let's
15:05 - continue to the next part so we're also
15:08 - going to add the medieval bricks but we
15:11 - are going to add them to the new ground
15:13 - model I made so that's next point that's
15:15 - the new ground model so again if we go
15:18 - under the mag assets and then go under
15:23 - models we can see that we have a model
15:26 - here called the platform and we have
15:29 - this in both the FBX version and a
15:33 - blender version so
15:34 - unless you have know what Blender is and
15:36 - have it installed we can just simply
15:38 - import the FBX version if you are
15:41 - familiar with blender and maybe want to
15:43 - make some changes I've just included it
15:46 - so you can play around with play around
15:48 - with the file basically how I made this
15:52 - and I'm going to very quickly show you
15:54 - this in blender just because it's so
15:57 - easy is first off when you open up you
16:00 - delete the camera and the Sun then you
16:02 - take the cube you go into edit mode by
16:04 - hitting tap then you scale it by
16:07 - pressing X s and then Y to only scale on
16:12 - the y axis drag it out and click then
16:15 - scale and then that to scale it down on
16:18 - this set axis here and then what we can
16:23 - do is now that we have the overall shape
16:26 - we can go to the right hand side under
16:28 - the massive fire panel hit add modifier
16:31 - then bevel and this will give it these
16:34 - cool rounded edges but we're just going
16:36 - to bump down the with a bit to something
16:39 - like that and then we're going to set
16:42 - the shading over in the left hand side
16:44 - to smooth then add another modifier
16:47 - called
16:48 - edge split and then apply both modifiers
16:51 - from the top to the button button there
16:54 - and then the last thing you want to do
16:57 - is you want to unwrap the UVs and we can
16:59 - do this without adding any seams because
17:01 - the model is so simple so simply go into
17:04 - edit mode and hit you and then unwrap
17:06 - and now we can add a seamless texture so
17:09 - that was basically how I made it and I
17:11 - just wanted to really quickly walk you
17:14 - through it so you know the different
17:16 - steps awesome so let's just import the
17:20 - FBX version here so let's just maybe we
17:24 - should make a separate folder for this
17:26 - yeah that will be pretty good I think so
17:29 - let's make a folder called models and
17:32 - inside of this we are just going to
17:34 - import the FBX click and drag and there
17:37 - it is you're going to change the scale
17:39 - factor to 1 and then we are going to
17:44 - disable import materials and
17:47 - yeah that should be pretty good
17:50 - everything looks nice if you're going to
17:52 - generate a light map you need to check
17:55 - the generate light map UVs
17:57 - but we're not going to do that and we're
18:00 - going to add colliders ourselves so hit
18:02 - apply under the rig we want to set this
18:05 - to none and hit apply and under the
18:07 - animations that will be disabled when
18:09 - you set the rig to none so now we can go
18:13 - ahead and drag this into our scene and
18:15 - you can see that it already looks really
18:18 - nice so what we can go ahead and do is
18:21 - we can make a material for it so let's
18:23 - disable the other ground here let's just
18:26 - delete that so we can work with this
18:29 - let's position it correctly something
18:33 - like there looks pretty good and what we
18:37 - can do is we can go ahead and find our
18:40 - material our ground bricks
18:43 - let's also delete the other grounds here
18:48 - so just get rid of all of them and then
18:51 - let's just drag the ground bricks on
18:54 - here but as you can see this the texture
18:57 - is pretty stretched and that's because
18:59 - our tiling is currently at 5 on the X
19:03 - and 0.5 on the Y so we're just going to
19:06 - make that one 1 but now you can see that
19:09 - the texture is way too big so instead
19:12 - let's do something like 5 comma 5 that
19:15 - should give the it the effect you're
19:18 - looking for yeah that looks pretty good
19:21 - and then we can go ahead and change this
19:24 - into a pumps diffuse so let's now find
19:27 - the normal map and drag it in here hit
19:31 - fix now and we can see that this looks
19:33 - really cool so now that our ground looks
19:37 - much better we can delete the old ground
19:40 - prefab and drag the new platform
19:43 - interpret fab here so we can distribute
19:46 - it all over our scene making the game a
19:50 - lot more fun to play so let's just
19:52 - duplicate this move it over just going
19:57 - to quickly make a few copies here
20:01 - and and we'll call it that see we could
20:10 - maybe do something like this just make
20:17 - sure that they all have the same set
20:20 - value and if you forgot to change it you
20:23 - can just select all of them and and
20:25 - input zero so there this looks pretty
20:31 - cool so let's go ahead and hit play and
20:33 - what shot whoa what happens
20:36 - so of course we need to add a Collider
20:39 - and this is where it gets really great
20:41 - that we made it into a prefab because
20:44 - now we can just select one of them hit
20:46 - add component physics box Collider and
20:51 - then everything looks nice so we can
20:54 - just hit apply and all of them are going
20:57 - to have box colliders so now when we add
20:59 - play we're not going to fall to our
21:02 - death we are going to be able to play
21:04 - this and everything works and this is
21:08 - actually quite fun
21:09 - so of course you should do something
21:12 - more exciting with your level that I
21:14 - have here but it's a start and it's just
21:17 - to show you the overall principles cool
21:20 - so that was pretty much it for this
21:22 - video we're just going to wait with the
21:25 - last thing here the music reset fix it's
21:29 - not that important and yeah we are
21:31 - running out of time so that's pretty
21:34 - much it let's just for the last thing
21:37 - let's make the GM object in to a prefab
21:39 - by dragging it down here that's just
21:42 - something that has been bothering me a
21:43 - bit so yeah that's it for this video
21:46 - thanks for watching and I'll see you in
21:48 - the next video
