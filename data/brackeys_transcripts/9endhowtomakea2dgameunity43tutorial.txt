00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello and
00:04 - welcome to the last video in going to
00:08 - Dee today we are going to export our
00:10 - game after just a few fixes and changes
00:14 - here and there and I'm going to
00:17 - basically show you how to export it both
00:19 - to the web and to a standalone that
00:23 - basically means Linux Windows and Mac
00:27 - cool so before we get started today I
00:30 - just quickly want to talk about why it's
00:32 - taking me so long to put out a video I'm
00:35 - sorry but I've been sick
00:37 - I hope you can't hear it on my voice
00:40 - anymore nothing serious but that letter
00:42 - slowed things down and more importantly
00:45 - I've been working on tin our games so as
00:49 - you see the wallpaper here I
00:50 - participated in the event I'm hosting
00:53 - cold 10 our games and basically what it
00:56 - is is it's not a competition but a way
00:59 - for people to get cracking on whatever
01:01 - game they want to make so it's more of a
01:03 - concept or a challenge if you will so a
01:07 - lot of cool people have already entered
01:09 - some games but I'm going to keep the
01:12 - event going for long in for for a long
01:15 - time and I would like to see more
01:18 - they're there room for many many more
01:21 - creations so please go to breakage to
01:22 - calm / 10 hour games to watch the video
01:25 - and read about it it's really awesome
01:27 - and I am looking forward to seeing what
01:31 - you come up with cool so now let's get
01:34 - started with today's video so as always
01:37 - I've opened up unity and if we go in
01:40 - here there's just a quick fix I want to
01:42 - do and that's whenever you play on full
01:44 - screen the ball has quite a bit of space
01:49 - to travel on and so I think the game
01:51 - just becomes a little bit too easy so
01:55 - what I want to do is I want to select
01:56 - the player prefab down here so I will
01:59 - change for them both at the same time
02:01 - and I want to bump down down the wire
02:04 - scale to something like 0.8 just to make
02:08 - the players a bit smaller and so it will
02:11 - be hard
02:11 - for them to hit the ball go so that was
02:15 - just a a quick gameplay fix of course
02:17 - that's something you should play around
02:18 - with to get it working for your game
02:22 - awesome so now we're going to go to file
02:26 - no yeah file and then build settings or
02:29 - press ctrl shift B we're not ready to
02:32 - build and run yet so in here we can
02:35 - first off make sure that we have added
02:37 - our scenes to the build I've already
02:39 - added the main level here so if not it
02:42 - will just be blank and you can hit add
02:44 - current and it will add the scene so
02:47 - that it will load up when you build the
02:49 - game then you can see currently we have
02:52 - PC Mac and Linux standalone selected if
02:55 - you want to select something else like
02:57 - the web player just to simply select and
03:00 - hit and hits which platform and then
03:03 - unity will re-import things and
03:05 - rearrange it so it works for that
03:07 - platform but let's do PC Mac and Linux
03:11 - first so first off let's select the
03:14 - target platform I'm just going to show
03:16 - you how to do this on Windows and then
03:19 - the architecture you can choose between
03:21 - 86 and 64 and 86 basically means 32 so
03:27 - I'm on a 64-bit system so I'm going to
03:30 - export to that and if you are doing a
03:34 - development build meaning that this is
03:36 - not the final export or not something
03:38 - that you're going to roll out to
03:39 - customers you can select that and it
03:41 - will basically say it in the corner that
03:44 - it's a development build also let's hit
03:47 - player settings to change some things in
03:49 - the inspector first off we make sure
03:52 - that you're under the standalone tab and
03:54 - let's first change the company name or
03:58 - that could be just your name if you
04:00 - don't have a company but I'm just going
04:03 - to do break ease here and the product
04:05 - name is going to be pong tutorial then
04:10 - the default icon I've gone ahead and
04:12 - created a very simple and again very
04:16 - simple icon for this game your feel free
04:19 - to use it if you want so that's of
04:22 - course in the assets pack so if you go
04:24 - to break
04:25 - calm you can download it it you can
04:28 - download it there and by the way I've
04:29 - made the site much faster now done a
04:32 - bunch of optimizations so it should just
04:35 - work really nicely but I'm just going to
04:39 - find it on my local hard drive here on
04:41 - the 2d assets pack under pong and icon
04:47 - here so again very simple but it works
04:51 - so let's drag this into the unity editor
04:54 - and drag it into the project pane and
04:57 - then select it make sure to select GUI
05:00 - and hit apply try again there and then
05:05 - go back to the player settings and we
05:07 - can set it as the default icon so let's
05:09 - just drag it in there
05:10 - the default cursor we're going to leave
05:12 - that and the same with the cursor
05:15 - hotspot now in the resolution and
05:18 - presentation because this is such a
05:20 - casual game I want to change the default
05:23 - is fullscreen to off so that I mean the
05:27 - game just simply doesn't require a full
05:30 - screen you can do stuff while you are
05:32 - playing and such so I think it's better
05:34 - if it's just windowed by default the
05:37 - default screen width and height and
05:39 - that's in pixels I'm just going to leave
05:42 - that I think that's quite fine and the
05:45 - rest of this we can pretty much leave I
05:47 - mean the icon is fine the splash image
05:51 - we're not going to mess with that the
05:53 - other render settings are for mode man
05:55 - advanced stuff so we're just going to
05:57 - leave everything and now we are ready to
06:00 - build our game so simply hit built and
06:03 - then we can select a destination and I'm
06:08 - just going to call this pong tutorial
06:11 - build and then it's always good to do a
06:15 - version number so I'll just do version
06:20 - let's do 0 1 then we hit save and it's
06:27 - going to just make sure that you save
06:28 - and then as an exe there are not in all
06:31 - files and hit save so now unit is going
06:35 - to go ahead and build out our game and
06:37 - it's just going to
06:39 - take a quick moment and now we are done
06:41 - so now on our desktop we should have a
06:45 - first off an exe file with the icon I
06:49 - know it's not pretty and a folder called
06:54 - the icon name and then underscore data
06:57 - and this is where many people get
07:01 - confused because I mean they think that
07:06 - whenever they build they just get an
07:07 - install file and you can go through the
07:10 - installation and then there's a shortcut
07:11 - on your desktop and all that good stuff
07:13 - but that's not really true
07:15 - I mean unity builds it out as a
07:17 - standalone but that doesn't mean that
07:19 - you have an installation yet so what we
07:23 - have here is an exe file with some data
07:26 - and we can now run the game as you can
07:29 - see and we can select everything just
07:31 - how we wanted actually the graphics
07:34 - quality well that's really annoying
07:35 - right now the graphics quality you have
07:37 - all kinds of settings and I don't really
07:40 - think that's required so let's just go
07:43 - back into unity and this is why we put
07:46 - version numbers in there so let's go
07:49 - back into unity let's go under the
07:51 - project settings quality and in here we
07:54 - can delete some of all those graphics
07:58 - settings so because we don't really need
08:00 - this much so let's delete everything but
08:03 - good actually so let's just delete that
08:06 - and that that that and that
08:08 - so we only have good and we can just set
08:12 - that as default for all the different
08:14 - platforms if you wanna I'm just going to
08:17 - clean it clean it up there and then
08:18 - we're going to say standard or if you're
08:25 - feeling cocky you can do awesome I'm
08:28 - just going to do standard and then the
08:32 - pixel light count that doesn't really
08:33 - matter we in a 2d game we don't have any
08:36 - lights so just leave it full rest sounds
08:39 - good
08:40 - per texture is fine until icing we're
08:43 - not going to do any of that and yeah
08:45 - basically just leave all the settings
08:47 - here so now we should be good to go so
08:50 - if we go ahead and Bill
08:53 - the game once more so going here and hit
08:55 - built and we're going to just do let's
08:58 - just overwrite this so yeah and it's
09:02 - going to go ahead and build the game one
09:03 - more time and there we are so now if we
09:10 - go in here and we double click on this
09:12 - we can see that we only have one
09:14 - graphics level and that's the standard
09:16 - you can't go ahead and customize this
09:19 - configuration thing I'm not going to go
09:22 - into that this is just the easy way and
09:24 - it works I mean I've never heard anyone
09:26 - complain about the launcher so let's hit
09:29 - play and you can see that our game
09:31 - launches it says powered by unity some
09:34 - people asked how to get that away you
09:36 - have to buy unity Pro in order to
09:38 - scratch that and we can see that this is
09:41 - working just how we wanted and we're
09:43 - gonna press reset and everything should
09:46 - be working yeah this cool so now let's
09:50 - close that down and we can go ahead and
09:53 - talk a little bit about how to make this
09:56 - into an installable so for that you will
09:58 - need an a dedicated program and there
10:01 - are free programs out there but most of
10:04 - them have limitations so just go ahead
10:06 - and find the one right for you there's
10:11 - one called
10:12 - was what is it actual installed err I've
10:16 - used this once for a kill pill it's
10:19 - quite all right I mean it the ICI
10:22 - version does what is is is needed but
10:26 - there are many alternatives to this just
10:28 - check it out search for it searched for
10:30 - make installable unity and you will get
10:33 - plenty of comparisons and all that to
10:37 - pick which one is right for you and and
10:40 - it's pretty easy you just select the exe
10:43 - file and the data and it will make
10:45 - everything for you so that's something
10:48 - you want to consider if you want to
10:49 - deploy to many systems awesome so that
10:52 - was it for this standalone version now
10:55 - let's go ahead and do the web player so
10:57 - let's say switch platform and let's just
11:00 - check out the player settings to make
11:03 - sure everything is ok and then here we
11:05 - can do it
11:06 - default screen width and height I think
11:09 - this is okay it's in the smaller size
11:11 - but that's alright and I'm just going to
11:15 - leave the default template here as white
11:18 - and the icon we are not going to change
11:21 - any of this so that is pretty much fine
11:23 - and we can go ahead and build again so
11:26 - hit build and let's go to the desktop
11:29 - here and let's make a new folder for
11:33 - this called pong web build and inside of
11:42 - this yeah we can select folder and it
11:44 - will start building so we'll just wait
11:48 - for it to finish awesome
11:53 - so now on our desktop we have a folder
11:56 - called pong web build and inside of this
12:00 - we again have two files one is the HTML
12:04 - file this stores all the information
12:06 - about how the unity Web Player is
12:09 - integrated into your browser so in here
12:14 - you can change how it looks what the
12:17 - title of the web player is all of that
12:20 - so if you have a program like notepad
12:24 - plus plus or any other other code editor
12:29 - you can go in and and change things
12:32 - around with this file and then we have
12:36 - the unity3d which basically stores all
12:39 - of the game information so this is the
12:41 - game itself and this what you would
12:43 - upload if you want to upload to a site
12:46 - like congregate and don't want to host
12:48 - it yourself so here comes again a bunch
12:51 - of information there basically three
12:53 - ways of getting your what days four ways
12:57 - of getting your Web Player out there so
13:00 - either you can build it like this and
13:02 - then maybe turn this into an RAR file
13:07 - and then upload it so people can
13:09 - download it and then they will have to
13:11 - just run both files but that would be
13:14 - stupid because then you can just use the
13:17 - normal standalone file
13:19 - so instead you want this somehow
13:21 - uploaded to the internet so that people
13:24 - can play it in their browser without
13:26 - downloading anything except the unity
13:29 - plugin and you can do that three ways
13:33 - you can do that either using Dropbox
13:35 - which is a pretty cool feature that I'm
13:38 - going to show you and that's what we are
13:40 - going to do in this video or if you have
13:43 - a website that you host yourself there
13:45 - are guides on the Internet it's not
13:47 - exactly easy there are often
13:50 - complications but there are plugins to
13:52 - help you and plenty of guides so just
13:54 - search embed unity Web Player game or
13:59 - something and there will be plenty of
14:01 - guides there and then lastly there is
14:05 - the alternative to just go to a site
14:10 - like congregate that will upload the
14:13 - game for you and you can also have ads
14:17 - on it or something I'm pretty sure but
14:19 - they will take a piece of the cake ban
14:21 - but yeah they and then people can go
14:25 - there to their side and play your game
14:27 - so in that case you're just going to be
14:30 - needing the unity3d file in our case
14:34 - we're going to be needing both right now
14:36 - we can double click on this unity Web
14:38 - Player thing and if you have the plug-in
14:40 - just select run now and it will load up
14:44 - and it works so now we are playing in
14:46 - the browser and that's already really
14:48 - awesome but what we will do is we will
14:52 - make sure to throw other people a link
14:55 - to this the problem right now is that
14:57 - you might be saying well it's on the
15:00 - internet it's in the browser it's not
15:02 - really if you give this link up here to
15:05 - anyone it's not going to work because
15:07 - this is just a file path to the local
15:10 - file on your system so what we're going
15:12 - to do instead of E is we're going to
15:14 - install Dropbox if you haven't already
15:17 - just go to Dropbox calm install it an
15:19 - account is free and you have I think
15:22 - it's 5 gigabytes it might only be 2 I
15:27 - can't remember you have a couple of gigs
15:29 - for free and it works
15:31 - really
15:32 - okay so we are going to go ahead and
15:34 - open up my Dropbox folder here once you
15:39 - have installed it of course and let's
15:41 - just find the folder called public in my
15:44 - case I've deleted it it should be there
15:47 - when you first install Dropbox but then
15:49 - you can just go ahead and say new folder
15:52 - and just make one just public there you
15:56 - go
15:57 - double click that and it's important
15:59 - that you do this inside the public
16:00 - folder and then simply drag our pong web
16:04 - build folder into this right click on it
16:08 - of course we're just going to wait for
16:10 - it to sync up and now it has with the
16:13 - check mark there right and now we're
16:15 - going to double click on that and then
16:17 - right click on the HTML file and we're
16:22 - going to say copy public link and that
16:25 - was basically it so now if we open up a
16:28 - browser here and paste in this link and
16:31 - you can do this to all your friends it
16:34 - will run the HTML file and you can say
16:37 - run now and the game will play from the
16:41 - Dropbox server and if you're wondering
16:44 - if that's going to be lag on the game
16:45 - itself it is not because the game is
16:47 - locally run so this is just a final turn
16:50 - ative if you don't want to go through
16:52 - all the hosting stuff it works and I
16:56 - think that Dropbox will keep on
16:57 - supporting this functionality hopefully
17:00 - so thanks for watching and that pretty
17:03 - much concludes this series so thank you
17:06 - very much for watching all the way to
17:07 - the end I hope you enjoyed it leave
17:11 - suggesting suggestions for what you want
17:14 - to do next many people have asked me
17:16 - whether or not the survival game
17:19 - tutorial series is completely scratched
17:22 - but it it's not I will continue with it
17:26 - at some point I have some things I want
17:29 - to do but there's just been so much and
17:32 - there's been much more demand for other
17:35 - tutorials so I don't know if that's what
17:37 - I'm going to continue with now we'll
17:40 - have to see I'm also working on some
17:44 - interesting stuff for the make a game
17:45 - tutorial
17:46 - I'm not going to tell you anything about
17:47 - it specifically because it's not totally
17:50 - planned out and I would love to do
17:53 - something like a 2d platformer tutorial
17:57 - at some point because I'm pretty much in
18:00 - love with the 2d tools so that's going
18:04 - to be interesting we have some GUI soon
18:06 - coming out from unity so that's going to
18:09 - be really awesome been looking forward
18:10 - to that for like yea years and I'm
18:15 - definitely going to do something on that
18:18 - and yeah unity 5 has been announced so
18:22 - all so much stuff there to cover so yeah
18:25 - it's going to be a busy time so thanks
18:27 - for watching this video and and the
18:30 - series in general hope you enjoyed it
18:32 - and I'll see you in the next video
18:37 - [Music]
