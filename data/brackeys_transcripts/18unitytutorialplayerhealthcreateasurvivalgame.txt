00:02 - hello everyone and welcome to the 18th
00:05 - video in our survival game series done
00:08 - by practice I am the CEO of Brack ease
00:10 - and in this video we're going to take a
00:13 - look at applying damage to our play
00:15 - through the enemy so allowing our enemy
00:19 - to actually attack all play and also
00:23 - making him disappear from the scene so
00:27 - actually killing him we won't be adding
00:30 - stuff like a menu that pops up and loved
00:34 - effects or anything like that will just
00:37 - make the code so that we can check with
00:39 - a nut here stat and so that we can apply
00:42 - damage to him so let's go ahead and open
00:46 - up unity I've already done this and you
00:49 - can see that everything is exactly like
00:53 - we left it the last time and first of
00:57 - all I just want to drag this door logic
01:00 - script under our scripts folder because
01:02 - we aren't going to be using that in this
01:05 - tutorial and then I want to find my
01:08 - enemy so select him and hover the mouse
01:11 - over the scene view and press F to focus
01:13 - in on him and I want to just drag him
01:17 - over so that we can test some stuff out
01:21 - with him without having to run from one
01:23 - point of the map to the other so I'm
01:27 - okay cool first of all I want to make
01:32 - some changes to the advanced AI script
01:34 - if you're using the AI simple script you
01:39 - would have to watch our tutorial number
01:41 - 15 to actually get an idea of how to do
01:46 - the advanced AI because it was in that
01:48 - tutorial we we implemented the attacking
01:52 - and so you could either go ahead and
01:55 - watch that or just download the scripts
01:57 - from our wits website but for now I want
02:00 - to remove the AI simple because we are
02:03 - not going to be using that either so
02:06 - double-click the advanced AI to open it
02:09 - up in monodevelop
02:10 - and what I want to do here is I want to
02:13 - make some
02:13 - a variable containing the damage and
02:16 - this I have already done and you can
02:19 - call it whatever you want and you can
02:21 - apply whatever parameter you want I'm
02:26 - just going to go with something like
02:29 - let's say 40 and say and if we scroll
02:37 - down under the function attack you can
02:40 - see that we have made a debug block
02:43 - saying that we should insert an attack
02:46 - here and we can go ahead and keep this
02:49 - but change it to the enemy attacked or
02:55 - the enemy the enemy has attacked and so
03:02 - whenever the enemy attacks us if we hit
03:05 - play we will get a message in the
03:12 - console saying that the enemy has
03:14 - attacked that's just to remind us and
03:18 - keep a good lookout for what's happening
03:21 - in the scene you could go ahead and
03:24 - delete it it's completely optional now
03:27 - right under this I'm going to type or
03:30 - actually write over it because says that
03:33 - it has already attacked so we'll make
03:35 - the attacking right above now let's
03:39 - write target that's the name of our
03:42 - target variable whatever the enemy is
03:45 - chasing that send message open
03:50 - parenthesis then we want to type the
03:55 - name of the function that we are going
03:58 - to be calling on the player that will
04:00 - make him actually lose damage so this
04:04 - can again be whatever you want I'm going
04:06 - to type damaged play
04:13 - and close this up or actually just make
04:17 - a comma and now we'll have to include
04:21 - the damaged variables to type the
04:23 - damaged comma and now let's do one last
04:31 - thing we are going to type send message
04:33 - options that don't require receiver and
04:38 - close everything up alright so what
04:43 - we're doing here is we are referencing
04:44 - the target variable which we've made up
04:47 - here and the target variable which will
04:51 - change depending on what our enemy is
04:53 - chasing so what the enemy is chasing
04:57 - that sent message and this means that we
05:01 - will send a message to the player in
05:05 - this case that we wants to want to
05:07 - damage him with the damage this is the
05:11 - amount we want to damage him and the
05:14 - send message options that don't require
05:16 - receiver simply means that if the target
05:21 - is equal to null if we aren't chasing
05:25 - it's not going to return an error but
05:28 - you can include this you also couldn't
05:31 - I'm going to go ahead and delete it I
05:33 - just wanted to explain that that's a
05:37 - pretty handy feature now that's it for
05:40 - changing the advanced AI script so we
05:42 - can go ahead and close out of that and
05:45 - this script that we are going to be
05:47 - making on the player is for now going to
05:49 - be much like the one that is sits on our
05:51 - enemy the enemy health so if we go into
05:55 - the enemy health double-click it to open
05:59 - it up in monodevelop we can have a look
06:02 - at how this works so again we have a
06:05 - function called apply damage this is
06:07 - what we in our advanced e is called
06:10 - damage play we could also call it apply
06:14 - damage then we say that actually this
06:19 - just may name it the same so let's call
06:21 - this one apply damage instead of damage
06:24 - player
06:26 - now you can see that we are applying
06:29 - damage with the the damage variable and
06:33 - we are going to say that health - the
06:37 - damage so health
06:39 - - equal damage and if health health gets
06:43 - low enough our enemy is going to die so
06:50 - one thing I'm going to do to optimize
06:52 - the script and I didn't do this in the
06:57 - previous tutorials because this was
06:59 - easier for me to explain but I'm just
07:02 - going to go ahead and take this if
07:03 - health is equal to or less than zero
07:07 - then we should call the dead function
07:09 - I'm just going to go ahead and delete
07:11 - that copy it and delete it and delete
07:15 - the whole function update and then paste
07:19 - it right beneath the health - equals the
07:23 - damage because then we can inside of the
07:27 - apply damage function check if our enemy
07:30 - is going to die and this is just a
07:33 - little bit less tact a little less
07:36 - taxing on the computer because we are
07:40 - not checking if the health is less than
07:43 - zero every frame we're just checking it
07:45 - when it actually loses health so go
07:49 - ahead and save that now we can copy this
07:52 - functionality all of this code and paste
07:55 - it into a new script which we which
07:58 - we're going to do now but first I want
08:00 - to go into the advanced AI because I
08:03 - have noticed that the damage variable
08:04 - was built with a large T with a capital
08:08 - T so we'll change that and go up and
08:11 - change the variable itself also it's
08:15 - good to be consistent with those kinds
08:17 - of things because then if it would would
08:20 - like the enemies to battle each other
08:22 - this would still work just as well
08:26 - all right so copy all of this code and
08:30 - go back into unity select our player hit
08:36 - the add component
08:39 - script language is going to be
08:43 - JavaScript and we could call this
08:46 - anything I'm just going to call this
08:47 - play play logic or play your stats I'm
08:53 - going to call it play your stats because
08:55 - I want the script to contain more than
08:58 - just the health in the future I would
09:00 - like it to also contain how variables
09:03 - that define how long he gets can sprint
09:05 - and you know stuff like that
09:08 - so let's hit the create a net now
09:11 - double-click it to open it up in
09:13 - monodevelop and here we go so you can go
09:17 - ahead and select all of this and replace
09:19 - it with what we just copied so paste
09:22 - this in and here we have a functioning
09:27 - script already so this should actually
09:31 - work so if we go ahead and save this and
09:34 - go back into unity we can see that we
09:38 - can change the health of our player I'm
09:41 - going to set this to let's just do a
09:44 - hundred for now and then we can change
09:46 - it when we know it's working so we have
09:50 - the player stats on our player which is
09:53 - going to take care of our players health
09:55 - and make sure that he can die on the
09:59 - player we have the advanced AI which
10:02 - will send out the damage which is now
10:05 - set to 40 so that's it let's go ahead
10:09 - and test it out so hit play and get
10:14 - nearer nearer to the enemy one two and
10:18 - three and there we go our player was
10:22 - deleted we have lost the game so it
10:25 - seems to be working we can check in the
10:27 - console view how many times was that how
10:32 - many times the enemy attacked before we
10:35 - died one two three times and then it
10:39 - returns an error saying that there are
10:40 - no audio listeners in the scene and
10:42 - that's because our audio listener was
10:47 - attached to the player in the final game
10:49 - we are not going to delete our
10:52 - we'll play you whenever we die all right
10:56 - we are going to do something else
10:59 - instead we're going to pause the game
11:00 - and allow our the one playing to
11:05 - actually replay or go to the main menu
11:11 - so I will have some GUI pop up for now
11:15 - I'll just go into the player stats and
11:18 - I'll make it so that we don't destroy
11:21 - the game object but instead we're going
11:23 - to use a deeper clock so delete the
11:26 - destroy game object pod and type debug
11:30 - lock and then play your dart and ended
11:40 - up with a semicolon and that's pretty
11:45 - much it for the video guys remember that
11:47 - you can always select the player and
11:50 - change the health of him so we're going
11:53 - to change it to I would say 200 and you
11:56 - can also go into the enemy and change
11:58 - the damage of the enemies and you can do
12:02 - that for each individual one so if I go
12:05 - ahead and duplicate this enemy and drag
12:08 - him over there I would recommend that
12:09 - you first make them a prefab by dragging
12:12 - them down but we're going to do that in
12:14 - another tutorial but if i duplicate him
12:16 - and change this variable you can say
12:19 - that the variable of the other enemy
12:22 - states the same so that you can have
12:23 - enemies that are more powerful than
12:26 - others now I hope you enjoyed the video
12:29 - and I'll see you in the next one
