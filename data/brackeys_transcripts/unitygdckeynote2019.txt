07:41 - magically please oh my goodness yes so
07:45 - tell me about it
07:46 - magic is on the unity booth this week
07:48 - showing off their mixed reality game
07:50 - dr. gourd bot it's been announced at GDC
07:53 - this week that they're bringing
07:54 - multiplayer to this mixed reality
07:55 - experience so let's take a little look
07:58 - at a trailer before we speak to mr. Yu
08:02 - [Laughter]
08:32 - [Music]
08:37 - so we are joined her by mr. Yu who is
08:40 - actually a great board mark their
08:42 - director I would thank you so much for
08:45 - joining us it's so great to meet you
08:48 - very nice to meet you and thank you for
08:50 - having me of course so dr. Claude book
08:52 - mr. Lee's last year on magical eat one
08:55 - single-player experience just tell us a
08:58 - little bit more about wetter and you
09:00 - working with magically to create this
09:02 - awesome experience yeah so I'm from
09:04 - where to workshop as people might know
09:05 - it's a physical affection workshop
09:07 - famous for doing film and so on so we're
09:08 - not a place known for doing games but
09:10 - during our travels we met this Chet
09:12 - brownie above its who is the CEO of
09:14 - magic leap and he and caught wind of
09:16 - this dr. blood-bought swore that I was
09:18 - creating and asked me if he would if we
09:20 - would come and make a game for him for
09:22 - this crazy new system he was imagining
09:23 - where you basically would better put the
09:25 - virtual things in the real world play a
09:26 - game literally in your own space and for
09:29 - me personally that was super exciting so
09:31 - we jumped into their adventure with him
09:32 - straightaway and made our first game
09:34 - draft of robots invaders so before we
09:36 - get into the multiplayer what's the
09:38 - single-player experience like so the
09:39 - single-player game like I said is a game
09:41 - that takes place in your own home the
09:42 - medical device is astonishing it can
09:44 - scan your house and then we on the game
09:47 - end we examine that and we build nav
09:49 - measures and we've replaced basically
09:50 - robots in a whole robot world into your
09:53 - own home with you and the fun part of
09:56 - that as well as I wanted to really bring
09:57 - characters to life and this because I
09:58 - think this medium is amazing for
09:59 - storytelling so we have Stephen Fry
10:02 - playing dr. broad board we have Rhys
10:04 - Darby playing gimble our AI companion
10:06 - and we have Lucy Lawless featuring at
10:08 - the end of the game as well who's one of
10:10 - our sort of characters that leads on
10:11 - into the future of what happens with
10:12 - this story so what happens when you take
10:14 - that single-player experience to
10:15 - multiplayer what do people see when
10:17 - they're interacting together yes so even
10:19 - at the tail end of developing the game
10:21 - we were we started to realize that we
10:23 - really wanted to explore multiplayer and
10:25 - have people share their experiences
10:26 - because on the medically one you're kind
10:28 - of you still in the real world you can
10:29 - still see everything around you but you
10:31 - are having this unique experience and no
10:33 - one else can see it so we wanted to
10:34 - solve that problem immediately yeah so
10:35 - we're showing off at the unity booth
10:37 - broad battle which is a very early
10:39 - prototype sort of a glimpse into the
10:41 - potential future of what shared
10:42 - experiences and multiplayer can be and
10:44 - mixed reality in spatial computing and
10:46 - in this particular experience you
10:48 - you get to customize yourself choose a
10:50 - character and then you well literally
10:51 - I'm gonna say but virtually transform
10:53 - yourself you see yourself as another
10:54 - character you're customizing your head
10:56 - and you can see where you're looking yes
10:58 - so we you look your character's eyes
11:00 - look when you talk your character's
11:01 - mouth moves okay it's quite a surreal
11:03 - transformative experience and so we're
11:05 - really excited to show people because I
11:06 - think it sort of signposts something
11:07 - really exciting for the future of
11:08 - spatial computing so then people can
11:11 - come to the booth and try this you're
11:12 - going to be holding some Tech Talks
11:13 - write about the development business
11:15 - so Thomas Hall one of our amazing
11:18 - engineers who's actually the lead on
11:20 - multiplayer he's talking about what he's
11:22 - done with unity to bring multiplayer
11:24 - into that and James Everett one of the
11:27 - lead game designers and producer is
11:29 - talking about the entire games
11:30 - experience and sharing that tomorrow at
11:32 - the RDC great thanks so much for coming
11:36 - I just wanted to mention there's a hard
11:41 - thing to talk about but in New Zealand
11:43 - just in the last few days we had a
11:44 - horrible horrible event that's stunned
11:47 - us all and left us feeling raw and sorry
11:50 - it's it's hard to talk about but I just
11:52 - wanted to direct people anyone who cares
11:54 - or wants to help there's a New Zealand
11:56 - website called give a little code on E&Z
11:58 - you can go there and and try and support
12:00 - the people who've been directly affected
12:01 - so it's not super funny but I think it
12:08 - really matters so yeah please reach out
12:10 - and help if you can okay so we have an
12:20 - advisory panel also at GDC bit weird
12:23 - segue but here we are but maybe you'd

12:36 - advisory panel during GDC week yep so

15:35 - it's it's very very pretty and it has I
15:44 - mean I can't spoil it but there's also a
15:47 - real-time ray tracing demo which you can
15:50 - take a look at on our social channels as
15:51 - well if you look on Facebook or YouTube
15:53 - or Twitter we've done a demo with BMW
15:56 - it's beautiful it's amazing and it's
15:58 - it's real time rate racing inside of
16:00 - unity which is pretty cool and mentioned
16:02 - previously our CTO yochem is gonna be
16:04 - here to show us the latest innovations
16:06 - in the data oriented tech stack so stay
16:08 - tuned get comfortable get a drink so
16:11 - speaking of things are made with unity
16:12 - yeah because I always have the IGF and
16:16 - game developers Choice Awards are of
16:18 - course up honestly
16:19 - and we wanted to call out just a few
16:21 - games that are made with unity that are
16:23 - nominated for these awards that we think
16:25 - are extra core so Liz you were telling
16:27 - me about return of the Oh burden right
16:29 - yes it's absolutely fantastic so you'll
16:36 - hear a lot of people talking about its
16:38 - incredible art style it's very is
16:41 - gorgeous but it's so much more than that
16:43 - it's a really smart detective game where
16:45 - you're trying to find out with limited
16:47 - resources what happened to the crew and
16:48 - I just really recommend it
16:50 - congratulations to Lucas Pope for the
16:53 - nominations for this
16:55 - and as if to create a complete contrast
16:57 - to over 10 I've been playing a lot of
17:00 - beat Sabre by beat games beat Sabre is
17:03 - it's just a joy like I mean I I drum not
17:07 - very well I would add and so I play this
17:09 - uneasy but it's so much fun it's it's
17:12 - the best experience and also just come
17:14 - to PlayStation VR as well it's on
17:16 - PlayStation 4 and regardless of platform
17:19 - I am terrible at it on all platforms
17:24 - speaking of platforms I've been playing
17:27 - a platformer so Chris Bynum at a studio
17:33 - is this beautiful like painterly
17:35 - platforming exploration experience I
17:39 - can't really explain it it's kind of
17:40 - like a personal journey that feels like
17:43 - it's about love and loss and all these
17:45 - kind of incredible things well it sounds
17:50 - like it will make me cry much like
17:52 - Florence which is another nominee so
17:54 - yeah performance by mountains you've
17:57 - been playing that haven't you been
17:59 - playing it you get through it very
18:00 - quickly that's a short experience but
18:02 - it's this beautiful just story of a
18:04 - couple meeting and getting together and
18:06 - I'm not gonna spoil what happens but
18:08 - you've really just got our experiences
18:09 - it's just like it's like when you see a
18:11 - really great like indie rom-com and kind
18:14 - of thing and it just sort of like tugs
18:15 - at the heartstrings so you've gotta try
18:17 - it on iOS go and get it florence by
18:20 - mountains and congratulations to all of
18:22 - the nominees and you're all winners to
18:26 - us so so of course all of those games
18:30 - were made with unity and we're here to
18:32 - celebrate all of that tonight with some
18:34 - great new tech and also to see some of
18:36 - the games that are coming up and just to
18:39 - remind you number 2019 of unity is
18:43 - actually ready to go so we have 20 19.1
18:46 - in beta so you or beta I should say
18:48 - because I'm in America beta you can go
18:51 - and download the beta from the unity hub
18:53 - and just install it and try it out and
18:56 - we've got a whole bunch of new stuff
18:57 - exciting stuff for you to try out so how
19:00 - about the editor first there's a lot of
19:02 - great editor functionality here one of
19:05 - the things that I think is super useful
19:06 - really exciting is improvements to the
19:08 - so so we now have a clickable stack
19:10 - trace and there's also search
19:12 - functionality so you can really drill
19:13 - down to whatever it's causing you
19:15 - there's problems yeah so if you suck at
19:17 - programming like I do you can find out
19:18 - where you've gone wrong there's also a
19:21 - shortcut manager which is like it's it's
19:23 - a godsend it's a really obvious thing to
19:25 - have a shortcut manager in some software
19:27 - a little bit behind on that one but it's
19:29 - here now it's great you can bind
19:31 - anything to whatever you need to you can
19:33 - find conflicts between keyboard
19:36 - shortcuts and you can even share maps so
19:39 - if you want to have your whole studio
19:40 - working on the same keyboard shortcuts
19:41 - it's super super useful is great it
19:48 - basically allows you to group things if
19:49 - you're working on a big scene with all
19:51 - kinds of different stuff and you really
19:52 - want to just focus on in one area you
19:54 - can just group things without having to
19:56 - switch off game objects was just really
20:02 - wonderful things is timeline signals so
20:06 - if you've been wanting to trigger events
20:07 - from certain frames in your timeline you
20:09 - now can do so and if you want to find
20:11 - out more about this we actually have a
20:13 - talk on the booth on Thursday at 1:00
20:15 - p.m. that one of our evangelist Shiro is
20:17 - going to be doing so please come in
20:20 - check that out yeah and there's the new
20:22 - yes new input system okay that's super
20:26 - useful so so thank you to everybody who
20:28 - has been jumping on the beater and
20:30 - trying out so far it's it's really great
20:33 - that you give us all of these bug
20:34 - reports and help make unity better and
20:35 - this the sooner you try it out the
20:37 - sooner won't be battle tested and ready
20:39 - to rock so I'm being told that the
20:41 - keynote is going to start very very
20:44 - shortly that's true so make sure you've
20:47 - got your drink make sure you're
20:48 - comfortable make sure that you're ready
20:50 - to go that you've ramped up and you're
20:51 - excited because it's not much time left
20:53 - I'm excited so what we got quick

22:24 - it was a mess like none of us knew what
22:26 - we were doing oh my god it was horrible
22:28 - but worth it making games is a hard
22:35 - craft on its own it is probably
22:38 - intimidating is challenging it's really
22:40 - hard but you have this whole community
22:42 - that can help you out with anything
22:43 - there are a lot of other people you can
22:45 - draw on you'll have created an entire
22:46 - world even if it's a small world you'll
22:48 - have created a living world that didn't
22:50 - exist before and there's nothing more
22:52 - powerful than that I really want to make
22:54 - game stats that have amazing performance
22:57 - that look beautiful but making it easy

26:09 - product people who care deeply about you
26:11 - the game developer we invested our
26:14 - technology and our services and our
26:16 - workflows to empower your game ideas and
26:19 - successes today we solve or try to solve
26:22 - hard problems so that you can focus on
26:24 - the content the creativity and the
26:26 - imagination it takes to bring a game to
26:28 - life we're not here to make games we
26:31 - have no interest in creating experiences
26:33 - that compete with your hobbies or your
26:36 - businesses and we're here to build the
26:39 - unity platform and services for you the
26:42 - developer now up on the wall behind me
26:46 - there's a list of some of the larger
26:48 - developers that use unity and we're
26:50 - super proud of this group people but we
26:53 - wouldn't be who we are today and where
26:54 - we are today without the support of the
26:57 - indie community take a look at some of
26:59 - the amazing Studios in attendance with
27:01 - us here tonight and I really thank you
27:03 - for showing up and being here
27:09 - and what a success you've had 45% of the
27:16 - top thousand mobile games today are made
27:19 - by developers using unity that's all of
27:21 - you more than a third and people don't
27:24 - always know that what are the third of
27:26 - all PC and console games are built in
27:28 - unity in seven out of ten of the top
27:32 - games on iOS and Android right now are
27:35 - made with unity and we serve the
27:38 - developer community in three ways I'm
27:40 - going to talk you through all three I
27:41 - want to start with create now first we
27:44 - help you create the best product we
27:47 - allow you to work efficiently across
27:49 - teams worldwide and with developer and
27:52 - artist workflows that support you
27:53 - through the process now right now unity
27:56 - is undeniably the best development
27:58 - platform platform for mobile but today
28:01 - we have line of sight so that unity will
28:03 - be the best high end performance
28:06 - platform for PC and console we're making
28:09 - seriously powerful advancements with the
28:12 - entity component system the c-sharp job
28:14 - system and other technologies that make
28:16 - up part of our data oriented technology
28:19 - stack and because of unities modularity
28:21 - you can use the tech you want when you
28:24 - need it without being burdened to adapt
28:26 - to new technologies before you need them
28:28 - just think in many ways you'll be in
28:31 - control and being able to use unity to
28:33 - create your own game engine to carry
28:35 - only the technologies you need for the
28:37 - game you're building now we'll talk a
28:39 - lot more about this super powerful idea
28:42 - around power and flexibility throughout
28:44 - 2019 but with all that flexibility and
28:48 - power you also have the confidence of
28:50 - knowing that your games are optimized
28:52 - for over 25 platforms maybe even a
28:57 - platform of tomorrow you don't yet know
28:59 - about now we're excited to be partnering
29:01 - with Google on their cloud games
29:03 - initiative and I'd encourage you all to
29:05 - tune in tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. and watch
29:07 - what they have to share it is absolutely
29:10 - spectacular
29:11 - now the second area we do after you
29:14 - create the game you have to operate it
29:15 - and we help you operate your game in the
29:18 - real
29:18 - world with services today that welcome
29:21 - all creators because at unity our
29:24 - operate tools work with unity games and
29:27 - game was built on other game engines and
29:29 - these services have powered the
29:31 - operation of the two most defining
29:33 - moments in gaming so far in 2019 now
29:37 - some of you probably know I'm talking
29:38 - about fortnight's marshmallow concert
29:40 - millions of people talking in real-time
29:42 - ^ unities v vox voice service and then
29:46 - there's apex legends millions of users
29:49 - playing simultaneously through the power
29:51 - of unities multi play back-end hosting
29:54 - service now let's take a look at both of
29:56 - these a little closer and how they can
29:57 - help you agnostic of what game engine
30:00 - your product is built on a V box is the
30:03 - most recent addition to the Unity family
30:05 - and is the leading provider of voice and
30:07 - text chat and the proven go-to solution
30:10 - for linking hundreds of the hundreds of
30:12 - millions of players together in some of
30:15 - the biggest multiplayer online games
30:17 - ever products like fortnight and pub G
30:20 - and League of Legends in fact today it
30:22 - was announced that V box will be
30:24 - available inside of the unity of the
30:27 - unreal ecosystem so you can get VIP Vox
30:30 - voice services without a separate SDK
30:32 - download and then there's multiplayer
30:34 - the leading online game server hosting
30:37 - solution it's also a unity service
30:40 - available to all developers regardless
30:42 - of development choice and multiplayer
30:45 - has helped deliver resilient scalable
30:47 - solutions for some of the industry's
30:48 - most battle-tested online experiences
30:51 - like titanfall one of my favorites
30:53 - rocket League and a game you've probably
30:55 - heard just a little bit about these last
30:57 - few weeks
30:58 - apex legends now this is a rocket apex
31:03 - Legends reached 1 million unique users
31:05 - in the first eight hours 10 million
31:09 - players in the first 72 hours including
31:12 - 2 million concurrent players in the
31:13 - first weekend and ultimately 50 million
31:16 - players in the first month these are
31:19 - huge numbers and the backend service
31:22 - that supported this that helped make it
31:23 - possible his unity zone multiplayer and
31:27 - what you get you get an optimal blend of
31:30 - three things a large
31:32 - cost-effective infrastructure in
31:34 - bare-metal the ability to spin up
31:37 - thousands of servers in a second with
31:39 - the Google cloud platform and an
31:41 - operating team at multiplayer providing
31:44 - the backend operating service that most
31:46 - developers could only dream to realize
31:49 - it's great to see apex legends achieving
31:52 - such success worldwide but then what is
31:56 - worldwide for many of you the biggest
31:59 - game market in the world can be hard to
32:00 - penetrate and that's China
32:02 - and here at unity we have deep
32:05 - experience and expertise in China two
32:08 - great examples arena valor the number
32:12 - one mobile game in the world boasting
32:15 - over a hundred million registered users
32:17 - is built on unity as is king of Avalon
32:20 - with 60 million registered players both
32:23 - massive games operating ax Cale both of
32:26 - which are built on unity and today we're
32:29 - announcing a new partnership that'll
32:30 - help you operate your games in the
32:32 - world's largest gaming market $0.10 and
32:35 - unity we're announcing that $0.10 cloud
32:37 - is unities connected games partner in
32:40 - China with the largest gaming community
32:43 - base but it's no secret that $0.10 is an
32:45 - expert empowering the best and the
32:47 - brightest and the most successful in
32:49 - China and I've got some great news for
32:51 - all of you you can start using the unity
32:54 - $0.10 cloud service this year not today
32:57 - but later this year so we could help you
33:00 - get started in ways you never could
33:01 - before now we look forward to working
33:05 - closely with $0.10 in bringing unity
33:07 - games to the masses of passionate gamers
33:09 - in China but now we've covered create
33:13 - and operate I want to shift gears and
33:15 - talk about something that is near and
33:18 - dear to your heart
33:18 - the third way we can show up and help
33:21 - you support your game in the marketplace
33:23 - this is monetize it maybe near to your
33:26 - heart I know it's near and dear to your
33:28 - wallet now we all know you create games
33:31 - not everyone to make money some it's
33:33 - just a hobby but we have the technology
33:36 - and services to ensure maximum player
33:38 - enjoyment engagement and monetization
33:40 - we're way more than an ad network we've
33:44 - created some truly innovative tech
33:46 - technologies and products that ensure
33:49 - that your maximized player enjoyment and
33:52 - engagement and not just going
33:54 - exclusively for the dollars and our
33:57 - tools make optimal use of data and
33:59 - machine learning to ensure you get the
34:00 - right ads served at the right time and
34:03 - importantly when it's better not to
34:05 - serve it out at all then no ad is served
34:07 - now Unity's Unified auction offers a
34:11 - fair and unbiased chance for all
34:13 - advertisers to win the bid for the ad in
34:16 - kind of regardless of who they are
34:18 - driving higher bids faster ad serving
34:21 - and ultimately more revenue for you now
34:24 - we've also got technologies delighted
34:25 - mix it up a bit
34:27 - innovations like AR advertising that
34:30 - allow you bring your creations into the
34:32 - physical world now
34:34 - unity helps you with the most revenue
34:35 - while delivering a great player
34:37 - experience and this is nothing short of
34:39 - breathtaking here's an interesting thing
34:41 - that you might not know the ads team has
34:44 - done such a great job of taking all
34:46 - these factors into account and making
34:48 - unity the third largest video ad network
34:50 - behind only Google and Facebook our
34:54 - network is also engine agnostic in fact
34:57 - even our friends at epic use the unity
35:00 - network to acquire users for fortnight
35:02 - and to give you some sense of the scale
35:04 - in the last month alone we Reese ever
35:08 - 1.7 billion unique devices with unity
35:11 - ads and we served over 10 and a half
35:15 - billion ads in virtually every month in
35:18 - the last six months this is a massive
35:20 - opportunity for reach and it will help
35:22 - you monetize your game that a scale that
35:24 - perhaps you haven't been thinking now we
35:29 - help you create we help you honor
35:31 - operate and we help you monetize now
35:33 - tonight many folks in the Unity team
35:36 - some of our brightest minds are going to
35:38 - talk to you about other innovations
35:40 - we're going to talk about mobile
35:42 - leadership highlighting the performance
35:45 - that you can get with a lightweight
35:46 - render pipeline the C sharp job system
35:48 - the burst compiler the AAA our
35:50 - foundation framework then we're going to
35:53 - talk about the tech of tomorrow I'm
35:55 - going to do that in two parts
35:56 - performance and graphics we'll discuss
35:58 - how our new performance features
36:00 - the entity component system make up the
36:03 - technology stack that can help you move
36:05 - forward and we're gonna talk about
36:07 - graphics and we'll give you an extended
36:09 - look at our real-time ray tracing demo
36:12 - which was just unveiled and Nvidia is
36:14 - GCC conference a few hours ago and we're
36:16 - gonna unveil the newest demo for the

40:25 - talking 60 frames per second low latency
40:28 - and super silky and responsive controls
40:31 - to fully realize Call of Duty on mobile
40:33 - we sought out the best development
40:36 - partners using the best technology for
40:38 - the job so you start with Call of Duty
40:41 - the number one selling console game
40:43 - franchise in the US for 10 consecutive
40:46 - years and 10 cent with their incredible
40:49 - experience building some of the most
40:51 - successful mobile shooters on the entire
40:53 - planet and built in unity this has given
40:56 - us the performance and the visual
40:58 - fidelity and also the flexibility to
41:00 - capture that authentic call duty
41:02 - experience onto mobile for call duty and
41:05 - mobile this is a perfect match now to
41:08 - take a closer look at the game help me
41:10 - welcome $0.10 director of technology
41:12 - shadow goooo let's start by taking a
41:20 - look at the material system we use the
41:23 - physics base rendering using unity
41:25 - shader systems which has made it really
41:27 - easy for us to set up our own render
41:29 - pipeline all the visible elements are
41:31 - fully physically based and support
41:34 - advanced features that you would only
41:35 - expect to see on game consoles like full
41:38 - image based lighting and specular
41:39 - occlusion using bent normal the physics
41:43 - base render pipeline is used for scene
41:45 - elements and then we use unity sprite
41:47 - light probes which are placed
41:49 - procedurally as you can see here for
41:51 - dynamic global illumination we also use
41:55 - reflection probes for metallic
41:58 - enhancements so lighting features are so
42:00 - important for scene rendering and to
42:02 - achieve that immersive call duty look we
42:04 - combine static shadow masks with dynamic
42:07 - cascaded shadow maps and the combined
42:10 - lighting results are something you would
42:11 - never expect to see on a mobile device
42:13 - now let's talk about animation so we've
42:16 - been able to achieve some really awesome
42:18 - animation effects and called dirty
42:20 - mobile we start with unities animator
42:22 - controller which has provided excellent
42:25 - flexibility so the programmers and
42:26 - animators can get exactly what they want
42:29 - in addition the team was able to build
42:32 - upon
42:33 - Unity's built-in physics and as you can
42:35 - see from these test dummies we've built
42:37 - our own custom and verse kinematic and
42:39 - ragdoll system now what's great about
42:41 - this is for our animators they don't
42:43 - have to worry about key framing every
42:45 - little keyframe now we can just work on
42:48 - the really important animations and let
42:50 - the procedural systems do the rest to
42:52 - work when it all comes together it just
42:54 - looks awesome Thank You shadow
43:00 - we've seen just a small slice of call
43:03 - duty mobile there's so much more to show
43:05 - and we look forward to sharing it with
43:07 - you soon the place has seen is going
43:09 - great we really couldn't be happier with
43:11 - how it's shaping up now beginning today
43:13 - you can pre-register for the game at
43:16 - call of duty com / mobile we're going to
43:20 - be launching a public beta so sign up to
43:22 - be among the first to know I really hope
43:24 - you enjoyed this exclusive first look at
43:26 - called duty mobile and we wish you a
43:28 - great GDC thanks please welcome Stephen
43:37 - Sullivan
43:42 - welcome to kingdoms of heckfire an
43:44 - impressive realtime strategy game by a
43:46 - stinking ape there are successful mobile
43:48 - game studio from Vancouver Canada with
43:51 - millions of lifetime players imagine if
43:54 - you wanted to build a game like this
43:55 - without their resources not only would
43:58 - you have to figure out how to make your
43:59 - game fun and truly unique you'd also
44:01 - have to build a number of
44:02 - labor-intensive boilerplate game systems
44:05 - I've worked as an engineer and producer
44:07 - so I know this problem all too well in
44:10 - this industry every day matters I regret
44:15 - that I spent many of those days building
44:18 - things like inventory currency
44:19 - management virtual stores and player
44:21 - progress instead of working on the
44:24 - experiences I really wanted to create
44:27 - almost all these gameplay systems are
44:29 - common for every successful game so if
44:31 - you want to make mobile games you have
44:33 - to build and rebuild game system after
44:36 - game system after game system after game
44:40 - system after game system so now my team
44:45 - wants to enable you to save time to
44:47 - focus on what matters
44:48 - making your game truly unique and fun we
44:52 - got this idea because we've built this
44:53 - before with the unity in-app purchase
44:56 - plugin we saved the headache of worrying
44:59 - if your transactions would work on ten
45:01 - different platforms and we removed this
45:03 - nightmare for thousands of developers
45:05 - that reach over 800 million Mau as a
45:09 - result we saved each developer days of
45:12 - development time and now we want to save
45:15 - you weeks or months of engineering time
45:17 - with game foundation game foundation
45:21 - gives you common components for building
45:24 - game systems in the editor you can use
45:26 - the UI or API directly instead of
45:29 - worrying how you're going to name things
45:31 - and what parameters to use from scratch
45:35 - game foundation gives you pre-built
45:37 - libraries let's see an example here
45:41 - we're gonna add an awesome dragon bundle
45:43 - to our game once you have the bundle add
45:46 - in your the name description and then
45:49 - you decide which things you're gonna pay
45:51 - out when somebody buys it what you'll
45:53 - notice is the currencies
45:54 - that you've predefined are already wired
45:57 - into this system so then all you have to
45:59 - do is add a payout amount for each next
46:03 - you need to add a little magic from your
46:04 - art team to make sure it's a good
46:05 - purchase experience and then you're
46:08 - ready to launch the game so here we see
46:12 - the game world and you can see your
46:13 - bundle show up in your store and then
46:17 - the player makes a purchase the nice
46:18 - thing is this system's already pre-wired
46:21 - together your new gems are added to the
46:23 - players State on disk currencies are
46:26 - deducted and all the items are added to
46:28 - the inventory so you can see how quick
46:31 - and easy it is to create and change your
46:33 - games at the vaults and that's not all
46:36 - with this system you also get automatic
46:39 - data instrumentation which helps drive
46:41 - deep insights without having to write
46:43 - any additional code what used to take 30
46:48 - days or I don't know 4 to 3200 minutes
46:52 - now can be done in an hour
46:54 - or 60 minutes just think about what you
46:58 - could do with the extra 43,000 minutes
47:00 - you could build something like a
47:02 - thinking ape did you could focus on the
47:04 - unique stuff that makes your game fun
47:06 - and one-of-a-kind game foundation will
47:10 - be available as a unity package in q2
47:12 - thank you
47:17 - please welcome IRISA scoff
47:25 - last year we introduced great new
47:28 - graphics functionality into preview this
47:30 - year you're gonna see a lot of amazing
47:32 - tech being moved into being production
47:34 - ready let's take a look at two of the
47:37 - most exciting features coming out of
47:39 - preview in 2019 dot one lightweight and
47:42 - shader graph shader graph is a simple
47:46 - yet powerful node based system that
47:48 - allows artists to author shaders
47:50 - visually without having to write any
47:52 - code you can drag and drop nodes in real
47:55 - time and see the results immediately
47:56 - which speeds up experimentation
47:58 - iteration the instant feedback makes
48:01 - debugging and tuning simple artists are
48:04 - empowered to create or freely and
48:06 - intuitively and one of the game-changing
48:09 - features that's coming in 2019 dot one
48:11 - are nested sub graphs so a sub graph is
48:14 - a visual solution for making a custom
48:16 - node that you define directly in shader
48:18 - graph now that sub graphs are nest of
48:20 - all that makes them a versatile solution
48:22 - for defining a custom content library
48:24 - for your project or studio this gives
48:27 - your technical artists the ability to
48:29 - have non-destructive control over your
48:32 - entire shader pipeline empowering your
48:34 - artists to work freely and safely light
48:38 - we render pipeline has been signed from
48:40 - the ground up to offer the most scalable
48:42 - solution for unity graphics it's
48:44 - available as a c-sharp package making
48:46 - the rendering code completely
48:48 - customizable to get the results you need
48:50 - to make a beautiful looking game it's
48:52 - lean and optimized so that allows for
48:55 - peak performance at a variety of
48:56 - platforms and we now have a custom
48:58 - renderer system which replaces callbacks
49:01 - and command buffer injection but with
49:03 - the ease of being set up entirely
49:05 - through editor UI no code required you
49:08 - can always dig in it's amazing to have
49:10 - this level of control best of all these
49:13 - are both available now and production
49:15 - ready with 20 19.1 so let's take a look
49:17 - at these features in action
49:23 - please welcome Jake beagle
49:30 - disruptive games is an indie studio
49:33 - based right across the bay in downtown
49:35 - Berkeley we're a small team of 12 very
49:38 - passionate developers with decades of
49:40 - experience working to places like
49:42 - insomniac Activision and Electronic Arts
49:45 - our first game megalith released earlier
49:48 - this year on playstation vr since then
49:52 - we were looking at ways to expand our
49:53 - audience and even at platforms beyond VR
49:57 - when Unity approached us with a
49:59 - challenge to create a mobile demo we
50:01 - jumped at the chance because of this we
50:05 - had a lot to do we had to change engines
50:08 - change platforms and we even just
50:10 - switched our perspective from first
50:11 - person to third person and we had to do
50:13 - it in a very short amount of time
50:15 - luckily using unities lightweight render
50:18 - pipeline and their powerful tools we're
50:20 - able to create a demo that our team is
50:22 - very proud of and I'm gonna show you a
50:23 - slice of today
50:37 - [Applause]
50:43 - now I'd like to introduce our studio art
50:45 - director Jed Melnick and Lucas Myers
50:47 - from you need technology to walk you
50:49 - through how this demo was possible thank
50:51 - you everyone
50:54 - hey Jed welcome thank you so lightweight
51:00 - render pipelines going out of preview
51:01 - with 2019 at 1:00 and you've been using
51:04 - it to create this again that's right can
51:07 - you talk us through what you did to make
51:10 - this thing come to life
51:11 - yeah well coming into the project there
51:13 - was a lot of concern about lighting and
51:14 - performance I had worked on mobile
51:16 - devices before and a lot of the times
51:18 - there's a lot of trickery involved and
51:20 - we have to do a lot of pre baking to get
51:23 - the light to really work on mobile but
51:25 - with the lightweight render pipeline it
51:27 - just came out of the box working
51:29 - dynamically across the whole scene you
51:32 - can see here that we have real-time
51:34 - shadows across the entire scene and you
51:37 - can any light lips here which know like
51:40 - all these shadows are that's all this is
51:41 - all working all all direct light is is
51:44 - dynamic what's what are all these red
51:47 - lights on the right side so the red
51:49 - lights this is our little light show
51:50 - platform here you can see hello and it's
51:55 - all working using per-pixel lighting
51:56 - across the entire environment what it's
52:00 - a lot of reflections on the ground how
52:01 - did you how did you make those so those
52:03 - are pre baked cue maps that we that
52:05 - again out of the box very easy for us to
52:08 - use the Sun as well that's right yeah
52:11 - the Sun as well the sun's dynamic so you
52:13 - can see the per pixel specular gliding
52:15 - over it right there and these these
52:19 - laser towers are they they're just
52:20 - shooting real-time lights yeah so that's
52:23 - just using the out of out of the box the
52:25 - effects editor and you just attach a
52:27 - light to one of the particle effects and
52:28 - they just send it down the row great did
52:31 - you have to do any special material work
52:34 - and that for this project yeah so shader
52:36 - graph was huge for us we use it across
52:38 - the entire map you can see this little
52:40 - red ring kind of booming at the base
52:42 - right here look that's all done in
52:45 - shader graph by one artist so it just
52:47 - takes a day for an artist to do it
52:49 - and this is a huge difference for us
52:51 - because back in the day it used to be an
52:53 - artist and an engineer working together
52:54 - and they had to kind of sync up their
52:57 - visions and it took a lot of time but
52:59 - now we just have an artist working on it
53:01 - directly and it exactly what they need
53:03 - it to be well what kind of hardware does
53:05 - this require this is originally we were
53:08 - targeting high-end mobile devices but
53:11 - this is just I phone 8 so for me I have
53:14 - an 1/8 and it just works great did you
53:17 - use the shadowgraph for anything else uh
53:19 - yeah so let me look around here real
53:23 - quick so you can see that there's a
53:25 - gradient across the entire environment
53:27 - so you can see the what do you mean sand
53:29 - enos down here and you can see kind of
53:31 - the more burnt orange towards the top
53:33 - that's that's all dynamic so you can
53:36 - take this rock and you can kind of move
53:38 - it up and down and it's all done
53:40 - worldspace gradient in the shader by an
53:43 - artist yeah and all very performant the
53:45 - other part that's great about the shader
53:47 - graph is we got wind in there without a
53:49 - problem you can see right here on the
53:51 - leaves you can see a lot of kind of
53:52 - dancing around over here you can see
53:55 - more foliage and that's all just done
53:57 - with shader graph by an artist very easy
54:00 - to do and very short amount of time
54:02 - that's great I really love this example
54:04 - of a project that uses lightweight
54:06 - render pipeline and shader graph to
54:08 - bring these kinds of graphics to mobile
54:10 - let's take a look at another mobile game
54:12 - Thanks
54:13 - [Applause]
54:48 - please welcome Kevin summers
54:55 - Disney sort of arena conjures up a world
54:58 - where players unleash Disney and Pixar
55:00 - characters onto strategic battlefields
55:03 - players build custom teams of champions
55:05 - and villains from a deep vault of
55:07 - collectible characters each with their
55:09 - own unique abilities let's check out
55:11 - some gameplay here we are entering the
55:15 - final encounter of a battle where your
55:17 - squad is facing off with Captain Hook as
55:19 - you can see the team really captured
55:22 - each character's unique style and
55:24 - personality each character was hand
55:26 - drawn by our artists and while inspired
55:30 - by the classic Disney art style our game
55:32 - features a detailed angular and
55:34 - cel-shaded look we've stayed up-to-date
55:39 - with unity throughout our development
55:41 - recently they've released features that
55:44 - were critical in bringing Disney sources
55:45 - arena to life we've used cinema sheen
55:48 - and nested prefabs to quickly and easily
55:51 - build our environments but the
55:54 - lightweight render pipeline was the real
55:56 - star for us as it helps us reach 60
55:59 - frames per second on a wide range of
56:01 - mobile devices some more than two years
56:02 - old and it wasn't just about performance
56:05 - the lightweight render pipeline also
56:07 - granted us access to unities new shader
56:09 - graph feature which really gave our
56:12 - artists a lot more control and
56:14 - flexibility and for me as an engineer
56:16 - this meant less time that I need has
56:18 - been building and maintaining custom
56:20 - shaders win-win Disney source of arena
56:23 - is currently in beta but Franz and Lucas
56:25 - are going to show you how our team
56:26 - utilize shader graph thank you
56:33 - hey Fras hey Lucas look at that all
56:37 - these Disney characters in my favorite
56:38 - tool I think that's so cool I'm so happy
56:40 - we have this game you're on stage you
56:43 - were the visual effects editor correct
56:45 - or designer what is it designer artists
56:48 - yeah on this project can you take us
56:51 - through some of the tricks you use to
56:53 - make this game come together sure so
56:55 - let's dive into Ariel's water effects
56:58 - over there so this was the cool piece of
57:00 - concept art that we started out with and
57:03 - with this as our target I was inspired
57:05 - by a few techniques that I'd write about
57:07 - and shada graph was pretty instrumental
57:09 - in bringing this into the game it looks
57:12 - like a render yeah so let's actually
57:15 - look at how water material so up here on
57:17 - the left you can see I have a few
57:19 - parameters that I can mess around with
57:20 - colors to change and but these two
57:23 - textures do a lot of the heavy lifting
57:25 - so I like I see the waters rotating is
57:28 - that like a rotating masher does that
57:30 - all come from the material that's all
57:32 - done in the shader yeah so like yeah I
57:35 - can like you know make it like more
57:38 - flowy and so on can we take a look at
57:40 - the graph yes so I'll show you a simple
57:42 - trick that we use to tense stuff in the
57:44 - game so I sample the texture over here
57:47 - that you see at the bottom and then you
57:50 - know one with the green and red exactly
57:52 - and then like I take the green Channel
57:53 - multiply that by a color take the red
57:55 - Channel do the same and add them
57:57 - together and then we can tint it to
57:59 - whatever colors we want a game that
58:02 - sounds really confident you just use a
58:04 - water texture good question versatility
58:06 - so if we look at this quad it has the
58:09 - exact same material on it so what I'm
58:11 - gonna do is just change the noise
58:14 - texture to be something a little bit
58:17 - more Fiolek and change the colors to be
58:21 - a little bit orange maybe and you can
58:24 - already start seeing you know the water
58:29 - tone into something a little bit more
58:30 - like a two style dial you're using the
58:33 - same graph for different effects exactly
58:35 - actually over here I have a few more
58:38 - effects that I made using the same
58:41 - technique like I even use it with a
58:42 - particle system out there Wow
58:44 - looks cool thanks did you use
58:46 - yes actually this on Haiti's hair and I
58:51 - came there all the time yeah he was
58:53 - hanging out in the background and in in
58:56 - game when he gets angry like we changed
58:57 - his hair to a fiery red and he goes into
58:59 - a rage yeah you changes the run time
59:01 - yeah hey you've been doing this job for
59:05 - a very long time how would you approach
59:07 - making effects like these before you had
59:09 - shader graph it was a bit more of an
59:11 - involved process where I'd have to work
59:13 - with an engineer like Kevin oh yeah
59:18 - shader graph is so flexible and as an
59:20 - artist it's really empowered me to like
59:22 - you know get the creative look envision
59:24 - that we really want in the game well
59:26 - great I think it looks really great and
59:27 - I'm really thanks France it's amazing
59:35 - and for us at unity it's such a big
59:39 - important step up to make sure that the
59:41 - visual control of what your material
59:44 - don't mind me these guys look at me that
59:47 - the visual control of what your material
59:50 - looks like what your game looks like is
59:52 - in the hands of artists like Franz and
59:55 - like Jed where it belongs
59:57 - now we've been looking at a few mobile
59:59 - titles that use the lightweight render
60:01 - pipeline but the lightweight render
60:03 - pipeline is also the thing that powers
60:05 - our AR and VR features so let's take a
60:08 - look at some of those
60:15 - please welcome
60:17 - Brittany Edmund and Dan Miller
60:22 - a dim when they told us to make
60:27 - ourselves at home up here I don't think
60:29 - they meant to bring our living room huh
60:31 - well might as well take advantage of it
60:32 - I guess it's an exciting time for
60:35 - augmented reality with new features and
60:38 - technology being released for both
60:40 - handheld and wearable platforms and
60:42 - people are getting used to the idea of
60:44 - using their phones for more from using
60:47 - them to take pictures with dinosaurs at
60:49 - the park to visualizing what furniture
60:51 - could look like in their homes before
60:53 - they purchase it we're really just
60:55 - starting to scratch the surface of the
60:57 - potential of this technology in a unity
61:00 - we want to give you the resources to
61:01 - stay on the bleeding edge of augmented
61:03 - reality today we'll be talking about a
61:06 - our foundation we built a framework
61:09 - specifically for a our creators that
61:12 - gives you the ability to build your
61:13 - application once and deploy a crossbow
61:15 - with a our kit and a our core enabled
61:18 - devices we've also included additional
61:21 - features to help you overcome some of
61:23 - the other common challenges of era
61:25 - development from anchoring your digital
61:27 - object in the real world to the visual
61:30 - fidelity of those digital objects and
61:32 - more we've taken assets from the FPS
61:35 - sample and converted them from the HD
61:37 - render pipeline to the lightweight
61:38 - render pipeline since we're targeting
61:40 - mobile devices and in playing with these
61:42 - assets we're going to show you some of
61:44 - the features that you can take advantage
61:46 - of with a our foundation by
61:48 - demonstrating how you can take assets
61:50 - that you've already created for your non
61:52 - AR project and use them to create an AR
61:55 - project that looks great run smoothly
61:58 - and is available on the 1 billion mobile
62:01 - devices that are AR enabled around the
62:03 - world today an enabling era foundation
62:06 - in your editor is as easy as going to
62:08 - the package manager since we've already
62:10 - done that we can go ahead and hop in
62:11 - today I'm going to be using a feature
62:13 - called AR remote which allows me to
62:15 - connect an AR enabled mobile device to
62:18 - the unity editor from here we can start
62:21 - placing content in the world and
62:22 - building iterating and developing
62:25 - without having to compile it to the
62:26 - device every single time Dan is able to
62:30 - place content directly onto planes in
62:33 - the real world by clicking his mouse in
62:35 - the editor
62:36 - seeing these types of changes in real
62:39 - time will save you a ton of time as
62:41 - you're working I'm using something
62:44 - called a our foundation samples which is
62:46 - a collection of assets and resources
62:48 - already put together so that you can
62:50 - start building in augmented reality
62:51 - today let's go ahead and replace those
62:54 - spheres with an instance of our
62:55 - terraformer character and see what she
62:57 - looks like on the stage now restarting
63:00 - the remote is as simple as hitting the
63:02 - play button and is dance working you're
63:06 - noticing the blurriness in the camera
63:08 - feed in the editor this is because we're
63:10 - using something called the downscale
63:12 - factor which lowers the resolution of
63:14 - the camera but on the flip side it gives
63:16 - us a little more performance as we
63:18 - continue to iterate and our character is
63:21 - looking good but she's not fully
63:22 - matching the lighting that we have going
63:24 - on on stage to solve this we can use
63:26 - light estimation which is a fundamental
63:28 - technology of air kit and air core but
63:31 - they both do it a little bit differently
63:32 - because we're using air foundation we
63:35 - can simply enable this once and have it
63:37 - work across both platforms let's go
63:40 - ahead and look at what she looks like
63:42 - now you can see now she's a little bit
63:46 - brighter because of the stage lights and
63:48 - if they did then she gets a little bit
63:51 - darker too and I want to make sure that
63:56 - you don't miss that dan has been working
63:59 - directly in the unity editor because AR
64:02 - is just another build platform for unity
64:05 - and all of the workflows and the
64:06 - features and the new tech that we're
64:08 - building from the lightweight render
64:10 - pipeline to the entity component system
64:12 - all work for mobile AR and you can see
64:16 - how seamless of a process it was to take
64:18 - assets you've created in unity and bring
64:20 - them into augmented reality and we
64:22 - spiced up this demo a little bit more
64:24 - than just placing a character in the
64:25 - scene so Brittany once you go and grab
64:27 - it the iPad and show them what we made
64:29 - absolutely so we created a custom
64:31 - sequence using timeline that allowed us
64:33 - to add in a couple these extra cool
64:35 - moments but Dan just referenced and one
64:37 - thing I want to highlight is that
64:38 - Brittany is now using an AR kit enabled
64:41 - iOS device before we're developing on an
64:44 - AR core enabled Android device switching
64:46 - between air kit and AR core is as easy
64:48 - as switching build targets and
64:50 - unity a our foundation does all the
64:52 - heavy lifting huh what we got going on
64:56 - up stage you know I just thought it
64:58 - would be a nice touched if we added a
65:00 - couple plants from our terraformers home
65:02 - planet before we welcomed her on just to
65:04 - make her feel a little bit more welcome
65:07 - so now what come on whoa she's a little
65:17 - bit taller than I expected
65:18 - do you want to see something cool sure
65:23 - whoa where'd she go oh she's still here
65:27 - notice that even though she's
65:29 - transparent you can still tell where she
65:31 - is on the stage because of the way that
65:34 - her body warps the digital and the
65:36 - physical objects behind her also I want
65:39 - to point out her shadow when she's
65:40 - transparent she doesn't have one but if
65:43 - we bring her back notice that not only
65:46 - does she have a shadow but it's a shadow
65:48 - of her actual body it's not just a blob
65:51 - unity gives us the power to make these
65:54 - seemingly tiny creative decisions but
65:56 - actually have a big impact on making our
65:59 - terraformer feel like she's actually in
66:01 - Dan's living room with us it'll be
66:04 - perfectly honest I don't really know how
66:05 - to program shaders this effect was all
66:08 - created using the visual node editor
66:10 - available in shader graph since we're
66:12 - using lightweight render pipeline and AR
66:14 - Foundation we're able to easily pull in
66:16 - the camera feed into a node to create
66:18 - many cool visual effects like this and
66:20 - more and whoa those are the spaceships
66:23 - from mega city rendering an AR how many
66:26 - have 3,000 4,000 5,000 6,000 7,000 to
66:36 - land here is that the reason why we're
66:38 - able to get so many spaceships working
66:40 - in AR is because we're taking advantage
66:43 - of the data-oriented tech stack which
66:45 - also allows us to really take advantage
66:47 - of the hardware that were using that's
66:50 - pretty impressive over 7000 unique
66:53 - entities all rendering in AR at a solid
66:55 - 60 frames a second I think you can tell
66:58 - that with the power of unity and AR
67:00 - foundation you can build some really
67:02 - cool stuff some
67:03 - really cool stuff
67:06 - [Applause]
67:22 - please welcome Sarah Levantine as you've
67:32 - seen we've been building amazing
67:34 - features to help you take advantage of
67:36 - advancements in mobile hardware but we
67:39 - also understand that you want to
67:40 - maximize your player base which means
67:43 - broad range of device support games that
67:45 - can scale from the low end to the high
67:47 - end
67:49 - unlike PC or console building for mobile
67:53 - platforms requires a delicate balance I
67:55 - was a game developer myself in a past
67:57 - life so I get that one of the biggest
67:59 - challenges you face is building games to
68:01 - look beautiful and run smoothly but that
68:03 - don't overtax the hardware this is what
68:08 - happens to your framerate when your
68:11 - device is throttled it's super painful
68:13 - to deal with and really frustrating
68:14 - today there's a couple ways we can
68:17 - handle this problem on the one hand you
68:21 - can focus on just a small subset of
68:22 - devices at the high end the problem with
68:25 - that though is that it really limits
68:27 - your audience instead what most
68:30 - developers end up doing is pulling back
68:32 - on their game design sacrificing
68:35 - graphics fidelity lowering your target
68:37 - framerate reducing the scope of your
68:39 - game so they can still run well on
68:41 - low-end devices we don't want you to
68:44 - have to sacrifice we want to give you
68:47 - the control not the hardware through
68:50 - thermal management you can build games
68:52 - that run smoothly with sustained
68:54 - performance over longer periods of time
68:58 - we've built adaptive performance a new
69:03 - feature giving you unprecedented data
69:05 - about device thermal trends including
69:07 - information about whether your game is
69:09 - CPU or GPU bound at runtime the data
69:14 - this feature provides will enable you to
69:15 - adjust your game dynamically and
69:17 - proactively to best utilize the hardware
69:20 - the result is decreased thermal build-up
69:24 - a more predictable frame rate enabling a
69:27 - much better player experience and we
69:31 - tried this out with megacity the massive
69:34 - streaming world project
69:36 - you may have heard of the we unveiled
69:38 - last year with millions of entities
69:43 - built with scalability in mind this was
69:45 - the ideal testbed for our new
69:47 - performance feature by starting at lower
69:50 - CPU and GPU levels increasing them
69:53 - gradually to eliminate our bottlenecks
69:54 - we're able to keep energy consumption
69:56 - low if we detect we're getting narrow
69:59 - throttling state we can adjust the game
70:02 - right there to stabilize the temperature
70:03 - in our case we chose to lower the level
70:06 - of detail as you can see the results are
70:10 - impressive giving you the power to
70:12 - stabilize your framerate over extended
70:14 - time this simple was measured over 20
70:17 - minutes which is already impressive but
70:19 - check this out
70:19 - we started up megacity left it running
70:22 - overnight came back in the morning and
70:24 - it was still humming along righted it's
70:26 - a target framerate it was amazing by
70:36 - keeping a closer eye on devices thermal
70:38 - trends we can adjust performance
70:40 - on-the-fly
70:40 - and avoid throttling altogether with
70:44 - this kind of dynamic adjustment we can
70:46 - find that balance between maximum
70:48 - quality maximum performance on a range
70:51 - of devices we're working with the
70:55 - world's largest Android device
70:57 - manufacturer to make this happen first
70:59 - on some of the most popular devices our
71:02 - partnership with Samsung will enable you
71:05 - to use adaptive performance on Galaxy
71:08 - devices like the new flagship Galaxy S
71:11 - 10 galaxy fold and coming soon to many
71:14 - existing Samsung devices already in
71:17 - players hands around the world and this
71:20 - is just the beginning we're going to
71:22 - continue to invest in adaptive
71:24 - performance adding new features and
71:26 - rolling out to even more devices this
71:29 - year and beyond
71:32 - [Applause]
71:35 - please welcome Warren Spector
71:42 - hey everybody I'm Warren Spector I'm the
71:45 - creative director on System Shock 3 in
71:48 - case you haven't guessed by now I'm here
71:50 - to announce that the other side Austin
71:52 - team is building System Shock 3 with
71:55 - unity system shot games from a narrative
72:00 - standpoint are set in the world that's
72:02 - part cyberpunk a little bit space opera
72:04 - but more important to me is that from a
72:07 - gameplay standpoint we call them
72:09 - immersive simulations what that means is
72:12 - we merged a variety of genres which
72:14 - drives marketing guys crazy which I love
72:16 - anyway sister shock is part first-person
72:20 - shooter part role-playing game and part
72:23 - survival horror game but most important
72:26 - about the immersive simulations is the
72:28 - idea that they empower players to create
72:30 - their own stories to craft their own
72:33 - unique experiences in System Shock 3 we
72:37 - want players to feel alone in a strange
72:39 - and dangerous place a station on the
72:42 - outskirts of our solar system it's a
72:45 - world that was once alive with activity
72:47 - but is now controlled by a rogue AI
72:50 - named showdown living on this station or
72:54 - on living on this station are only
72:56 - robots mutants and the dead now with
73:01 - that in mind with that description
73:03 - having been said you can probably expect
73:05 - that there are some key things that
73:06 - we're trying to achieve fear feeling of
73:10 - horror feeling of dread we've got a
73:13 - bunch of gameplay systems in mind that
73:15 - we're absolutely not going to talk about
73:17 - today but from a visual standpoint we
73:21 - needed a setting that was kind of a new
73:25 - are like dominated by deep dark
73:29 - problematic disturbing shadows and
73:32 - punctuated by areas of intense focused
73:35 - light but that's about all I can say
73:37 - right now in a minute we're gonna have
73:41 - Elizabeth Liu grow and Lucas come back
73:44 - out here and tell you how we achieved
73:46 - that look but for now let's take the
73:50 - first ever sneak peek at System Shock 3
73:53 - in its current pre-alpha state
74:16 - and everything you do
74:24 - [Music]
74:34 - all right we are gonna switch gears away
74:38 - from mobile on to desktop and away from
74:41 - the lightweight render pipeline on to
74:43 - our high-definition render pipeline
74:45 - Elizabeth you are the graphics
74:47 - programmer on System Shock right yeah
74:49 - that's right show us some of your
74:51 - favorite shots well so I really love
74:53 - this shot here and you can see in this
74:56 - shot we have Steve in one of our vacuum
74:57 - sealed body bags pretty gnarly scene but
75:01 - one thing that this really highlights is
75:03 - HDR piece unified lighting model what
75:07 - that essentially means is we don't have
75:08 - to fake all these kind of special edge
75:10 - cases for light so for instance on this
75:14 - body bag here you'll see we're getting
75:15 - this awesome
75:16 - specular reaction and if I take this
75:19 - light here and I actually move it down
75:21 - you'll see we're even getting the
75:23 - subsurface through that vacuum bag is
75:27 - that like a custom shader you have to do
75:29 - know so that's the built-in HD RP
75:31 - materials HD lit shaders can we mess
75:35 - around with that a little bit yeah so I
75:37 - can remove the base map here I can make
75:41 - this a little bit more red I can turn
75:44 - down the Alpha all of it's just working
75:47 - dynamically I love that shot I love that
75:49 - time the what else you got
75:51 - so because we're using a sharpie and the
75:54 - unified lighting model we also get
75:55 - volumetric lights which are super cool
75:58 - and kind of that the same Steve yes that
76:01 - is the same Steve for Beth Dale and one
76:06 - thing that's really great about this is
76:07 - as I turn up this light here you'll
76:11 - notice we're getting brighter
76:12 - volumetrics as well as getting an
76:14 - increased subsurface response here on
76:16 - the volumetrics that's like the sort of
76:19 - dust in the air right in front of the
76:20 - light right and then we and then you
76:23 - also see like his feet light up right
76:25 - yeah so that's the unified parts that
76:28 - all these sort of lighting features work
76:30 - together right so what's really cool
76:32 - about that is we didn't have to create a
76:34 - special kind of edge case light here
76:37 - it's doing kind of a fake effect
76:39 - or have to kind of tweak the shader here
76:41 - for Steve to make it respond better it
76:44 - all just worked kind of out in the bag
76:46 - hey before the show we were talking
76:48 - about decals and how you use them
76:50 - extensively yeah can you show us those
76:52 - so we use decals in the number of
76:54 - different ways just to kind of highlight
76:56 - how much they're doing here let me go
76:58 - ahead and turn them off and on so you
77:02 - can see they're doing a lot gotcha
77:05 - so we're using projection decals kind of
77:07 - for these splashes of color like the
77:09 - blood here as well as the yellow stripes
77:11 - here and then we're using mesh decals to
77:14 - really add a lot of detail to the scene
77:15 - what's going on with that decal on the
77:17 - right there where like changes how the
77:19 - how the light hits the floor right so
77:23 - one of the great things about deferred
77:25 - decals is we can really change the
77:26 - underlying geometry so right there we're
77:30 - changing the metalness of the floor here
77:33 - we're changing the normals diffuse and
77:35 - just really kind of bringing out a lot
77:37 - of added detail that we normally
77:38 - couldn't do gotcha hey we've seen both
77:42 - fronts and Jed use shader graph 2 for
77:45 - some custom material work on their
77:46 - lightweight render pipeline games has
77:49 - shader graph been any help on this HDR
77:51 - peeve title yeah so in that scene you
77:54 - might have seen we were actually using
77:56 - shader graph here to kind of animate
77:58 - these vertex positions and kind of give
78:00 - this this there's no mesh animation here
78:03 - this whole thing is driven purely by the
78:05 - material right so I can modify this
78:07 - around a little bit I can change the
78:10 - speed here and I can really just kind of
78:14 - start to fiddle around with what what
78:16 - does the graph look like for a shooter
78:17 - like that I like this oh it kind of
78:21 - looks like the monster yeah yeah so
78:26 - we're you know getting a lot of use out
78:28 - of that Wow I think it looks really
78:31 - great and I think this is great to have
78:33 - an example like this of the kind of
78:36 - graphics quality that the HDR peopIe
78:38 - plan can bring through a title so thanks
78:40 - a lot of Lizabeth thank you so much
78:43 - [Applause]
78:49 - please welcome
78:51 - Lauren laning
78:56 - hi everybody it's great to be here today
78:58 - and we're showing a glimpse of oddworld
79:01 - soul storm it's a brand new game in the
79:04 - out world series an insole storm we
79:06 - wanted to break new ground big visual
79:09 - and cinematic leaps were important to us
79:11 - and so as a storyteller I need to stay
79:15 - focused on the things that bring that
79:17 - narrative to life and in this case this
79:19 - is where unities breath of real-time
79:21 - lighting and technologies and the
79:24 - amazing teams working with us around the
79:26 - world are making this possible so today
79:28 - we're showing you a sneak peek of a
79:31 - cinematic from the game that
79:33 - demonstrates some of unities latest
79:35 - rendering techniques then when that's
79:38 - done Benny Thierry executive producing
79:41 - partner on the project is going to show
79:43 - you how unity has elevated the graphical
79:46 - quality of oddworld soul storm thank
80:52 - now
80:54 - I think you need to see this
81:21 - hello everyone it's an honor to be here
81:23 - with you today building our cinematics
81:25 - is a global endeavor through unity our
81:28 - teams of talented creatives and
81:29 - engineers are collaborating in real time
81:31 - when you are as distributed in unity as
81:35 - we are the tools are a critical
81:37 - component and how we produce economy CG
81:39 - unity provides a sandbox of powerful
81:42 - cinematic tools to choreograph the
81:44 - narrative and polish our visuals called
81:46 - timeline and post process stack in our
81:49 - scene breakdown the process starts
81:50 - simple but very quickly grows in
81:52 - complexity in engine parallel workflow
81:55 - is the key to reducing production costs
81:58 - and increasing the quality of CG that we
82:00 - produce instead of waiting hours to
82:03 - render our iteration speed from review
82:05 - to direct an approval happens in real
82:08 - time for oddworld the richness and our
82:11 - visuals and imagery imagery is very
82:14 - important to us as creatives when we
82:16 - started Sol storm three years ago the
82:18 - team focused on how far we could elevate
82:20 - that bar utilizing the built in renderer
82:23 - which is still used in many components
82:25 - of our production today our characters
82:27 - like the shaman have significantly
82:29 - improved since their last IP new and
82:32 - tasty as a team we aspire to reach
82:34 - further built in rendering while great
82:37 - wasn't designed for the types of heavy
82:40 - graphical complexity and realism that
82:42 - our creative director had envisioned for
82:44 - the cinematics the team wanted more
82:46 - control to refine the visuals and give
82:48 - the shaman that stylized odd world look
82:51 - high definition rendering pipeline in
82:54 - unity 2019 is a huge leap in graphical
82:58 - realism and ease of use and our split
83:00 - screen tests the differences are
83:02 - immediately apparent
83:03 - the shaman doesn't feel so flat and
83:06 - washed out the way light behaves while
83:08 - interacting with the shaman skin and
83:10 - features is more physically accurate
83:13 - we're able to color grade the image in
83:15 - engine and in real-time which gives our
83:18 - visual a more cinematic right
83:19 - out-of-the-box look but light doesn't
83:22 - just touch the surface it goes deeper
83:25 - right scattering before it returned
83:27 - back to your eye HD rp+ subsurface
83:30 - scattering was the solution that we gave
83:32 - for the shaman to give that rich
83:34 - oddworld style we explored these
83:37 - opportunities to make our characters
83:39 - feel like they were a part of you the
83:41 - work that unity is done to mature its
83:43 - rendering technology is outstanding
83:45 - please follow us at audible.com thank
83:48 - you so much
83:49 - [Applause]
83:56 - we are very hard at work at our data
84:00 - oriented technology stack it consists of
84:04 - the c-sharp job system that we shipped
84:07 - last year the burst compiler and the
84:11 - entity component system now the most
84:14 - unconventional piece of that stack is
84:16 - definitely the burst compiler because it
84:18 - takes c-sharp code and turns it into
84:21 - assembly code now you wouldn't quite
84:25 - think that she sharp would be the most
84:27 - obvious choice to write the low-level
84:30 - parts of your game engine in but what
84:33 - makes burst work is that we don't use
84:35 - all of the features of c-sharp we take
84:38 - out things like the garbage collector
84:41 - like reflection and we don't allow any
84:44 - virtual calls in your job code and what
84:48 - burst does is it takes programs written
84:51 - in that subset of c-sharp and turns it
84:53 - into a highly optimized assembly code
84:56 - take a look here this is an image of the
84:59 - burst inspector I love everything about
85:03 - this image I do I love the verse
85:06 - inspector here on the left is a list of
85:09 - all the jobs in this project I selected
85:12 - my simple calling job a calling job that
85:16 - is the inner loop of our calling code of
85:19 - the renderer if calling is not fast we
85:22 - could all go home it has to be fast and
85:25 - here on the right side you see the
85:28 - machine instructions that the burst
85:30 - compiler generated interleaved with the
85:35 - original she sharp code the source code
85:37 - of that job so if you're the kind of
85:39 - developer that really wants
85:41 - to get down to the metal and really
85:43 - understand exactly what is going on you
85:46 - want to understand what the compiler
85:47 - does why it does it and you want to
85:49 - verify if it did a good job no pun
85:52 - intended you can take a look here and
85:57 - you can see that it actually did do a
85:58 - good job these specific machine
86:00 - instructions they're vectorized so they
86:02 - operate on for calling planes at the
86:03 - same time the burst compiler is going
86:08 - out of preview with unity 20 19.1 and we
86:13 - have a burst one that'll release
86:15 - candidates available for you today now
86:24 - before you all run out and go download
86:26 - it I see a few people hanging onto their
86:31 - sheet we're gonna have the person who
86:35 - started this whole data oriented tech
86:38 - stack initiative at unity we're gonna
86:40 - have him take it for a spin here we go
86:52 - well my name is Jeff him and my relate
86:58 - well well I founded it together with two
87:02 - other guys I knew I wants to make
87:04 - computer games I didn't really pay that
87:06 - much attention to high school that was
87:11 - not that was not what my parents wanted
87:13 - for me for sure back in the day most
87:15 - game engines were just so like a bunch
87:17 - of source code that you had to compile
87:19 - in and you could make a game out of it
87:21 - there wasn't really that many good
87:23 - options back there we basically said
87:25 - okay we want to eventually ship
87:28 - game engine a tool with which you can
87:31 - make computer games the reason we want
87:32 - to rep is because it felt like what we
87:34 - had actually built to make these these
87:36 - types of games was actually really
87:38 - flexible and really easy to use and we
87:41 - just wanted to make something that's
87:42 - really affordable so that you know like
87:44 - for people that that were like us we
87:46 - build unity on on that collaboration
87:50 - with those customers
87:53 - [Music]
87:56 - making a game is is hot it's hard work
88:02 - I really want to see this transition to
88:05 - to making unity the absolute most
88:08 - performant engine and enabling people to
88:10 - make games that have amazing performance
88:13 - that look beautiful but making it easy
88:16 - to do that dream version of unity is
88:21 - that we stick to our values it's just
88:23 - about being there for our community that
88:27 - we always listen to what they need and
88:29 - then build exactly dad thanks for I just
88:37 - really love making game engines I'm
88:40 - having just a blast these days actually
88:42 - just doing that so and see why not
88:45 - [Music]
88:53 - [Applause]
89:01 - thank you a couple months ago at unite
89:05 - we showed the megacity demo and it's
89:09 - been really important for us to stress
89:11 - test the data our enter text stack
89:13 - proving that we can stream simulate and
89:17 - render massive amounts of content in a
89:20 - dynamic world let's check it out
89:52 - so today we're releasing the megacity
89:57 - project let's see what is included gonna
90:01 - go to a editor demo so I'm gonna I'm
90:06 - just going to open up the megacity scene
90:09 - here so we can check it out and in this
90:12 - scene we have four point five million
90:15 - renderers and they're all getting loaded
90:17 - in the background in the editor and
90:20 - that's of course important because we
90:22 - love great runtime performance but it's
90:26 - equally important that workflows are
90:28 - efficient when you're working
90:30 - particularly in such big scenes check
90:33 - out all of this detail here that we have
90:35 - just hanging around everywhere in the
90:37 - megacity and all of these buildings
90:41 - every single one is made of around
90:45 - 200,000 separate entities you can really
90:48 - see how crazy that looks when just
90:51 - flying up these buildings because their
90:53 - detail is just not on the level of the
90:55 - camera it's just everywhere now when I
91:02 - click on that building I can select it
91:06 - and I can just click on edit here when I
91:09 - do that I can use the sub scene feature
91:13 - to get back to a very familiar object
91:16 - representation here we have our game
91:18 - object I can move them around I have my
91:21 - transform component my lot groups my
91:23 - modern behavior I can move them around
91:25 - and change whatever I like and I can do
91:28 - that in the context of the whole world
91:33 - and then I can select some of these
91:38 - shacks and the megacity the building
91:43 - block of it is really these nested
91:45 - prefabs you can see here this this
91:50 - prefab of these shacks it is made out of
91:53 - further smaller pieces and different
91:55 - variants put together and that was
91:58 - really important first actually be able
92:00 - to build this kind of scene with this
92:04 - massive
92:04 - of content because we we had two artists
92:08 - working on it for just a couple of weeks
92:10 - now when I'm done editing I can just
92:16 - close the scene I can save it and what
92:21 - you see then is we are saving the scene
92:27 - to disk the game objects but we're also
92:29 - saving the entity optimized
92:31 - representation and we can actually load
92:34 - and unload the different parts these
92:37 - different sections so here you can see
92:39 - the low resolution detail with just a
92:43 - couple of renders just representing the
92:44 - shell of the building but then when I
92:47 - load the rest of the scene in I can I
92:51 - can do that for streaming just getting
92:53 - more detail when I'm close up and in the
92:56 - distance you have to shell but look at
92:59 - how fast add loads that is the power of
93:02 - a runtime ready data format now
93:09 - everything that you have just seen
93:11 - including the content the game code and
93:14 - the tools is available today
93:21 - [Applause]
93:26 - so with the data into text second we
93:30 - want to empower you to create the most
93:32 - rich interactive and dynamic worlds and
93:35 - to do that you need physics so we
93:40 - decided to partner with a company that
93:43 - has defined the gold standard in physics
93:46 - simulation for games and for the last
93:49 - couple of couple of months we had an
93:52 - amazing collaboration with the havoc
93:54 - team and so I'd like to welcome all of
93:57 - our strong from havoc on stage Hey
94:04 - I'm super happy to be here
94:07 - Veon havoc always have been impressed by
94:10 - the creativity of the unity games and VI
94:14 - excited to show how unity and havoc have
94:19 - worked together to push physics to the
94:21 - next level and there is a couple things
94:26 - that we wanted to achieve together we
94:30 - want to give control of the physics
94:32 - simulation back to the developer
94:34 - something that is fast easy to
94:37 - understand and easy to modify actually
94:40 - events were very similar experience in
94:43 - havoc our first engine is an
94:45 - object-oriented approach but after years
94:49 - of painful iterations we ended up with
94:52 - some data centric approach very similar
94:56 - to dots and our users laughed it they
95:01 - found that removing those extra
95:03 - abstractions made it easier to
95:05 - understand and that gave them the
95:07 - control they needed indeed our
95:10 - collaboration with unity we were able to
95:12 - take that experience and create a data
95:15 - protocol in c-sharp which describes
95:18 - physics in a clean and simple way and we
95:23 - want unity to become the best game
95:26 - engine for creating Network games and in
95:30 - our experience physics is often what
95:34 - makes or breaks a network game so we
95:37 - worked with the have
95:38 - team on designing physics specifically
95:40 - for networking yeah network games are
95:44 - already quite complex so the key here is
95:47 - reducing complexity the tent design goal
95:51 - in mind we created something which is
95:53 - lightweight doesn't require internal
95:55 - caches and is easy to understand and we
96:00 - call that unity physics it is written
96:03 - completely in sushar using the burst
96:06 - compiler and c-sharp jobs so
96:09 - specifically for performance how did
96:11 - that actually work out for you I mean
96:13 - Rhian Heric are obsessed by performance
96:16 - and using the burst compiler was
96:19 - actually a great experience it was easy
96:22 - to use we didn't have to write
96:23 - platform-specific code and moody
96:25 - threading just worked out of the box and
96:27 - we did a very detailed analysis of the
96:30 - burst compiler output and we were
96:32 - surprised to find that it actually
96:34 - matches hand optimized assembly and this
96:37 - is super important because it allows us
96:40 - to write high-performance code in the
96:43 - same language as a game logic and for me
96:47 - personally that this is possible it's
96:50 - just absolutely amazing just incredible
96:54 - now unity games use physics for all
96:58 - kinds of different purposes and so in
97:00 - some cases a lightweight and stateless
97:03 - physics engine is not the right fit but
97:06 - fortunately for the last 20 years that
97:09 - havoc team has built and fine-tuned a
97:12 - sophisticated physics engine and its
97:15 - performance and quality powers the most
97:17 - ambitious Triple A games so we also want
97:21 - to offer that full power of Havok
97:23 - physics inside of unity and the data
97:26 - centric approach was key to making this
97:29 - possible
97:30 - it made a trivial to integrate havok
97:33 - physic's so with a simple switch you can
97:37 - go from unity physics simulation to
97:40 - havoc engine and because the data
97:44 - protocol is the same you user content
97:47 - can stay the same even your scripting
97:49 - logic
97:50 - so you talk a lot so now check out a new
97:54 - unit of physics written in c-sharp in
97:56 - axial live demo so you are him please so
98:05 - what any physics engine needs is
98:07 - collision parameters so we started with
98:10 - spheres boxes and capsules capsules are
98:14 - needed for rectals but from the very
98:16 - start we also wanted to include convex
98:19 - meshes comics meshes are important
98:22 - because it allows the artist to take a
98:26 - graphical mesh and just wrote into the
98:28 - physics engine without authoring
98:30 - specialized physics proxies and every
98:34 - physics engine also needs physics
98:36 - materials so we have this kind of iron
98:39 - object which has a very low friction so
98:41 - you see you are him kind of slides that
98:43 - a heavy iron object over the floor like
98:46 - it would be is another physics material
98:50 - property bounciness so we created those
98:52 - tires and very happily bounce around in
98:56 - a scene so yeah him stop having fun you
99:01 - have to move to the next theme alright
99:04 - ok so the next section here we have to
99:07 - have a board and this hoverboard is
99:09 - really driven by a bunch of game code
99:12 - and you can see when I pick it up here
99:15 - underneath it there's a bunch of queries
99:18 - there's these ray casts and they are
99:20 - what makes it have a board actually
99:23 - hover above the ground and so it's super
99:27 - important in a physics engine to have
99:29 - really efficient queries and shape casts
99:33 - and so on and the physics and havoc team
99:35 - spend a lot of time optimizing that code
99:38 - to be really really fast and then
99:41 - another set of features in the physics
99:43 - engine we call constraints constraints
99:45 - are holding to gated bodies together in
99:47 - this case we created a row fridge out of
99:50 - hinge constraint so as it x actually
99:53 - behaves quite naturally and those
99:56 - constraints are used for a number of
99:57 - reasons you can do platforms in game
100:00 - build machines they actually use it for
100:02 - ragdolls or even simple
100:04 - giggles so the next feature is also
100:08 - interesting we call it trigger volumes
100:09 - the shiny cylinders actually a rigidbody
100:12 - but instead of colliding it changes the
100:15 - material property of the object in this
100:17 - case the gravity so if this kind of
100:19 - slider which allows us to control the
100:21 - gravity form positive to be negative in
100:24 - the course is throwing as robots up and
100:27 - down they're getting dirty so if they
100:30 - get dirty we need to wash them so we
100:32 - have so we have this kind of nice little
100:35 - washing machine actually what it is we
100:38 - call it robot testing facility because
100:40 - we can stress test our physics engine
100:43 - so you see all kind of features here
100:45 - coming together we have constrained
100:47 - system your spheres we have balls
100:49 - different materials
100:51 - even though rotating mesh and that
100:54 - allows us to see the stuff scalable or
100:57 - the behavior it's just actually a lot of
101:08 - fun playing with this stuff so it's
101:12 - really amazing seeing all of this come
101:15 - together and this is all written with
101:18 - the C sharp Unity physics engine and the
101:22 - best part is this unity physics physics
101:25 - engine is available as a preview package
101:27 - today
101:30 - [Applause]
101:34 - and havok physic's will be available
101:38 - later in the summer and together this is
101:47 - a complete physics solution for creating
101:50 - rich and interactive worlds for dots
101:52 - thank you please welcome
102:01 - Natalia to torture
102:05 - [Music]
102:08 - in the past few years at Unity we focus
102:11 - a lot of investment in graphics
102:13 - resulting in exponential leap forward in
102:16 - rendering quality and we're just
102:18 - starting to build momentum
102:20 - we're future proofing our technology
102:22 - through a combination of partners talent
102:25 - and innovation we work closely with
102:28 - partners to bring you the best and
102:30 - latest workflows like substance
102:32 - I told uniformly loved by artists but
102:35 - today is available in beta on the asset
102:37 - store and that is coming out of beta in
102:39 - spring substance and unity will support
102:42 - HD and lightweight scriptable render
102:45 - pipelines was simple intuitive workflows
102:48 - for both of the pipeline's as well as
102:50 - the shader graph and you'll be able to
102:52 - easily live added substance material
102:55 - parameters for real-time texture updates
102:57 - whether you are any editor or at runtime
103:00 - for quick artist workflows and many
103:03 - thanks to the substance team for all of
103:04 - their hard work on this this is what a
103:06 - lot of artists have been craving to get
103:08 - at unity will also invest in people this
103:12 - includes hiring the best to help you
103:14 - achieve your aspirations the unity
103:16 - graphics team is full of world-class
103:18 - talent I'm lucky to work with them on
103:21 - the architecture of our workflows and
103:23 - rendering pipelines but today I'm happy
103:27 - to welcome graphene to the Unity family
103:31 - [Applause]
103:35 - graffia pioneers virtual texturing
103:38 - inefficient texture streaming and with
103:40 - ever-increasing device resolution and
103:43 - complexity of scenes that is rising
103:45 - steeply we need higher density textures
103:47 - and more of them more than ever now and
103:51 - graphene will help us boost our
103:53 - architecture and provide best-in-class
103:55 - artist workflows for comprehensive
103:58 - virtual texture streaming welcome
104:00 - graphene mauve graphics innovation comes
104:07 - from our extensible and configurable
104:10 - script Ola render pipeline architecture
104:11 - as well as our artists workflows we want
104:15 - to make sure to give you the right tools
104:16 - for the right job
104:18 - last year we harness the power of
104:21 - real-time ray tracing for accelerating
104:24 - lighting workflows through a real time
104:26 - path tracer to be lighting with our GPU
104:28 - progressive light mapper which is now
104:30 - available in preview but this is just
104:33 - the beginning of our real-time ray
104:35 - tracing journey we needed to make
104:37 - amazing offline quality professional
104:40 - graphics accessible to all of our users
104:44 - in real time frame rates so that they
104:46 - could take full advantage of the ray
104:48 - tracing technology and with real-time
104:51 - ray tracing interactive graphics which
104:53 - is new levels of realism which allows
104:56 - for truly dynamic global rendering
104:59 - effects possible at realistic game level
105:04 - fast frame rates let's take a look at
105:06 - what our real-time ray tracing
105:07 - technology can accomplish
105:17 - invent yourself and then reinvent
105:21 - yourself don't you swim in the same
105:25 - Slough invent yourself and then reinvent
105:30 - yourself
105:31 - and stay out of the clutches of
105:33 - mediocrity
105:35 - yourself and then reinvent yourself
105:39 - change your tone handshape so often that
105:42 - so they can never categorize you
105:45 - big array to yourself I'd accept what is
105:48 - which only
105:50 - that you have invented we self-taught
105:55 - every invent your life because you must
106:03 - and its history and the present
106:15 - I'd say this looks pretty sweet this was
106:19 - a huge accomplishment done in
106:21 - partnership with Nvidia BMW light and
106:24 - shadows and many groups at unity truly
106:26 - this was an effort where we were in it
106:28 - together
106:29 - Montreal Copenhagen Paris Detroit
106:32 - Seattle and San Francisco but what did
106:35 - you just see a beautiful car yeah there
106:39 - are 22 sequences in this video in total
106:42 - half of them are filmed on location with
106:45 - a real-world car and half of them are a
106:48 - CG vehicle yeah what's the big deal
106:51 - car commercials these days pretty much
106:53 - everybody around their stuff in CG yes
106:56 - but they take a couple of hours per
106:58 - frame to do that this CG car in the
107:01 - video is rendered in unity in 4k and
107:05 - interactive frame rates using the power
107:07 - of real-time ray tracing in HD RP on
107:10 - NVIDIA r-tx GPU and in several of the
107:14 - shots the CG car is seamlessly
107:16 - transitioned to the live film car do you
107:20 - know which one is real it's pretty hard
107:22 - to tell and that's exactly the point
107:24 - I'll tell you a funny story so we're
107:27 - working on a demo and we were providing
107:29 - feedback on the shots to keep improving
107:31 - I put together a set of notes on a
107:33 - particular shot and Danny one of the
107:36 - artists on the team who was working on
107:38 - demo very gently pointed out that that
107:41 - specific shot was in fact film well
107:44 - there's not much we're gonna change
107:45 - about that in many of the shots the CG
107:48 - objects are flawlessly integrated in the
107:50 - complex real-world scenes with objects
107:53 - people lighting environment now we want
107:57 - to take a deeper look under the hood at
107:59 - what's happening in this VFX sequence
108:01 - and to do that I'm going to invite
108:03 - Natalie Burke lead technical artist to
108:06 - help me
108:10 - hey everyone in the high-definition
108:14 - render pipeline we are already
108:17 - performing physically accurate
108:18 - computations for lighting and shadowing
108:21 - but in a rasterization world we operate
108:24 - on small local parts of the scene
108:27 - these are clever approximation the
108:29 - screen space approaches that run fast on
108:32 - console hardware but a trained eye can
108:34 - easily spot when the techniques break
108:37 - down when they don't match reality and
108:39 - if you don't see the object in the frame
108:41 - you won't see the results of that object
108:44 - the reflections on the screen yeah where
108:47 - are the wheels SSR to get good-looking
108:52 - results with rasterization technique you
108:54 - often have to do very complicated shot
108:56 - specific setup and making these work
108:59 - reliably across camera changes dynamic
109:01 - world is really hard with ray tracing
109:04 - however it operates on the whole scene
109:07 - with you lighting and shadowing globally
109:09 - for far more accurate rendering do you
109:12 - see the wheel reflections now that yeah
109:14 - I do and you can see when I toggle this
109:17 - button on and off that the reflections
109:19 - are much more clear when we're using ray
109:21 - tracing and that's precisely the point
109:24 - of course this means you might need to
109:25 - consider it in your game or in your in
109:27 - production but now everything is present
109:29 - the content is easy to set up it just
109:32 - works
109:33 - and it's far more robust for camera
109:35 - changes or any other dynamic elements
109:37 - you truly get accurate global
109:40 - reflections or full scene lighting
109:42 - bounce and it doesn't matter if
109:44 - something is or is not visible in the
109:46 - frame you still get to see its impact
109:49 - its reflection shadows whatever it is
109:51 - and we give you ability with our
109:53 - solution to render primary race either
109:56 - with rasterization for best performance
109:58 - or retracing for highest quality like it
110:01 - with a full path tracer and with that
110:04 - you can get proper refractions from
110:07 - multi-layer transparent materials you
110:09 - can kind of see some of us here or
110:13 - dynamic shadows that are globally
110:15 - accounting for the whole environment or
110:19 - really robust occlusion we're now in a
110:22 - global space where
110:23 - all there and you also get the full
110:28 - gamut of HD materials to play with
110:30 - opaque transparent alpha tests a double
110:33 - sided with full shader graph support so
110:36 - the artists are free to create more and
110:38 - of course dynamic real-time global
110:41 - illumination is a key part of delivering
110:44 - a fully ray tracing have ready solution
110:46 - let's look at the lighting now our
110:57 - retracing tech is built on top of each
110:59 - DRP in c-sharp scripts and shaders which
111:02 - is quick to reload and iterate in fact
111:05 - it took us about a day to build our
111:07 - global ambient occlusion solution it was
111:10 - that easy we provide a wide variety of
111:13 - ray traced effects for you to play with
111:15 - but if you wanted to create your own
111:17 - with a hybrid HDR P you get the full
111:20 - access to all of the runtime resources
111:22 - and you can choose between rasterization
111:24 - or ray tracing at any time object camera
111:27 - material as you wish you are in a driver
111:30 - seat nice you get great shadows from all
111:36 - of the objects in the scene from these
111:38 - huge textured area lights like the
111:40 - screen that you see here this is
111:42 - something that is tremendously difficult
111:43 - to do with rasterization despite all the
111:46 - research that's happening in this domain
111:47 - oh and this is running at game rate
111:51 - rates on a single consumer Invidia GPU
111:56 - pushing rate racing at about 13 Pollock
111:59 - million polygons scene with all of these
112:05 - huge textured lights and GI and
112:08 - occlusion and shadows and textures and
112:10 - so forth on a mobile form factor as you
112:15 - can see real-time ray tracing is pretty
112:18 - damn exciting but it needs to be done
112:20 - right and what I mean by that is this
112:22 - high fidelity content is really the
112:26 - biggest bottleneck for creating and for
112:28 - graphics today creating it as hard it's
112:30 - time-consuming without retracing
112:33 - solution we want to empower artists to
112:35 - create content once and
112:37 - use it both for raster and ray-tracing
112:39 - for a truly scalable solution and this
112:43 - is actually easy using the shader graph
112:45 - technology because ray tracing becomes
112:47 - an LOD and when we're on a restoration
112:50 - we use the regular shader and on
112:52 - retracing we use that best quality at
112:55 - best performance automatically and
112:58 - because our solution is built on a
113:01 - hybrid rendering pipeline this doesn't
113:03 - require any edge case it's a special
113:05 - case it's easy best of all we're
113:09 - delivering production focus ray tracing
113:11 - with a full preview coming in HD RP in
113:14 - fall 2019 this will include an early
113:17 - preview of a full frame path tracer even
113:21 - better you can start playing with our
113:23 - experimental HDR P build on github on
113:26 - April 4th experiment away please welcome
113:36 - Sylvia Rossi Bob
113:42 - you've known the work of unity is demo
113:45 - team for several years we are usually
113:49 - here to tell you all about the different
113:51 - ways in which we have improved and
113:54 - customized and extended various graphics
113:58 - features of unity all in the pursuit of
114:01 - making them better but this time our
114:04 - production feels very different from
114:06 - before it now feels that unity is
114:10 - already giving us a solid foundation
114:12 - that we can comfortably rely on and that
114:16 - made us confident enough to take upon
114:17 - some new challenges and some more
114:20 - unconventional subject matter we have
114:23 - had our graphics programmers unleash
114:25 - their imagination and work on creating
114:28 - essential elements of our storytelling
114:31 - it feels more and more like we can
114:34 - afford to experiment and to try new
114:37 - things with unities high definition run
114:40 - the pipeline and the new generation of
114:43 - post-effects we now have a fully
114:45 - featured production already working
114:47 - environment and we don't have to worry
114:50 - about visual quality because it just
114:51 - comes out of the box artists don't even
114:54 - need to have a deep understanding of
114:57 - what exactly is happening under the hood
114:58 - but there is a lot going on that
115:01 - contributes to the visuals being what
115:02 - they are and Natasha will be back to
115:04 - break it down for you afterwards but for
115:06 - now let me give you a glimpse into the
115:09 - new story that we're working on this
115:11 - build was just made an hour ago and I
115:14 - hope it works
115:15 - bear with me because it will play in
115:19 - real time thank you
115:22 - [Applause]
115:40 - go take a look
115:57 - yeah okay here we go
116:37 - so exactly this guy you're kidding
116:42 - they're a fairy tale Buster don't be an
116:45 - idiot
117:10 - I see
117:28 - open it
117:30 - wait
117:43 - do it
118:28 - [Music]
118:40 - I can't believe this place is actually
118:42 - real this makes no sense to me Boston
118:47 - but he might have me right
118:50 - [Music]
119:00 - I gotta be honest with you I get chills
119:11 - watching this especially here now
119:15 - Sylvie just said this was hot off the
119:17 - presses she wasn't lying so we're gonna
119:19 - try something a little nuts I'll tell
119:21 - you I'm a little antsy about it since
119:24 - the demo just finished we're gonna try
119:25 - to go and break it down and look what's
119:27 - happening under the hood in the editor a
119:31 - little so what I deeply love about
119:36 - unities demo team truly is that they're
119:39 - always pushing the frontiers of
119:42 - real-time graphics for the industry at
119:43 - large not just about what's happening
119:46 - with graphics at Unity and in fact some
119:49 - of you who know me well know that one of
119:51 - the reasons I joined unity is for the
119:53 - chance to work together with a creative
119:56 - team that is our demo team now sometimes
120:00 - I'm always awed by their vision but
120:03 - sometimes they come to me and discuss
120:04 - where they want to push their ambition
120:05 - and they Blanche like really they tell
120:11 - me what they want to push and together
120:13 - we work we push the graphics on our end
120:16 - they push the specific effects and as a
120:19 - result we're really living it together
120:21 - you know together as a true production
120:24 - this was a perfect example of that so
120:26 - for me it was a tremendously exciting to
120:29 - hear that they're finally feeling free
120:32 - to focus on all the special cases the
120:34 - magic for their creative vision and
120:37 - leading creators do their thing truly is
120:41 - what I came to unity for now The Heretic
120:45 - is not only packed to the brim with a
120:47 - ton of graphics features from HD and
120:50 - many bespoke effects
120:52 - it's a visually gripping experience that
120:54 - is actually running steady 30fps on a
120:57 - consumer-grade off-the-shelf gamer PC
121:01 - and that's possible because of the
121:03 - latest optimizations across the board
121:06 - for the HD graphics features such as
121:09 - heavily tuned volumetric slots of VG PR
121:12 - magic there
121:13 - optimized from scratch ADHD
121:15 - post-processing stack fast real-time
121:18 - area lights and so much more and the
121:22 - team relied on a visual effects graph to
121:24 - create abundant volumetric ambience
121:27 - constructing compelling atmosphere with
121:30 - detailed visual effects and now the fast
121:34 - performance of GPU particles in the VFX
121:36 - is what allowed them to amp up the
121:38 - richness of their scenes while
121:40 - maintaining solid framerate and it was
121:43 - easy for the team to create this with a
121:45 - powerful art excentric tool lighting is
121:49 - at the core of visual storytelling with
121:52 - well crafts like crafted lights you
121:54 - create suspense or you can diffuse a
121:56 - tense situation yet often complex
121:59 - lighting takes hours to create long
122:02 - baking steps can make any story
122:04 - iteration tenuous with HDR P performance
122:07 - rich and high quality lighting types for
122:10 - the first time the demo team was able to
122:13 - express their creative vision for this
122:15 - particular experience for a complex
122:19 - cinematic quality world entirely with
122:21 - real-time lights now light layers
122:24 - enabled a lot of custom setup for key
122:27 - parts of the scene for example like
122:29 - lighting the main character or putting
122:31 - particles and separate layers enabling
122:34 - cinematic control for the creators this
122:36 - is actually how live-action films are
122:38 - made HD lights in particular are
122:42 - physically based with real-world units
122:44 - what this means is it allows artists to
122:46 - use their experience from real world to
122:49 - guide the lighting setup you know the
122:51 - light bulbs you know the Sun and you
122:54 - don't have to translate your exposure
122:56 - units into arcane units it just works
122:59 - with highly detailed contact shadows
123:02 - we're able to pick up a lot of micro
123:05 - details of complex surfaces that's what
123:08 - allows us to actually have the eyelashes
123:10 - cast proper shadows on the face in the
123:13 - performant manner that's something
123:16 - that's really hard otherwise and all of
123:18 - this came with really fast iteration for
123:20 - artists they maintain their high visual
123:22 - lebar expectations and still they were
123:25 - able to achieve
123:26 - stellar runtime performance the HD
123:29 - pipeline also gave the demo team a lot
123:31 - of Legos to build the digital humans
123:33 - appearance all of the organic materials
123:36 - for skin hair fabrics are available as
123:40 - HD masternodes and a shader graph the
123:43 - dama team took them push them to 11 and
123:46 - really customize the heck out of them to
123:49 - create a truly realistic human the
123:53 - cinematographers lens directs our
123:55 - attention it drives the viewer focus in
123:59 - the camera properties can intensify our
124:01 - emotions or with a focal length change
124:04 - can rapidly build a sense of surprise in
124:07 - film this is controlled entirely through
124:10 - actual physical properties of the lens
124:12 - itself with the new HD post-processing
124:15 - stack vests the creative director of The
124:17 - Heretic achieved the filmic look by deep
124:21 - use of physical camera that's fully
124:23 - supported with a new HD post tag in this
124:26 - stack is the next level revolution for
124:29 - post-processing its unity upgrade it
124:31 - rewritten from scratch from maximal
124:34 - integration with HDR P for example the
124:38 - new HD bloom effect is fully energy
124:40 - conserving with a much more natural look
124:42 - it's stable for all ranges of values and
124:45 - it's also aided by pre exposition to
124:48 - help with high physical values it also
124:51 - supports a wide range of scene exposures
124:53 - what does that mean that means that for
124:56 - creator they don't longer have to fight
124:58 - with sudden overblown hot spots from
125:01 - bloom it behaves consistently and
125:03 - predictably personally I'm actually
125:07 - really excited about our new algorithm
125:09 - for depth of field some of you who've
125:11 - seen the graphics updates or jar of
125:13 - Awesome as I call it probably have seen
125:15 - this excitement for me this algorithm
125:17 - uses resolution independent scalable
125:20 - parametric bouquet shape with proper
125:23 - aperture control it accurately supports
125:25 - anamorphisms it also recreates the cat
125:28 - eye effect of the camera which occurs
125:30 - when a light enters camera at an angle
125:32 - now these physical imperfections
125:34 - they bring completely new level of
125:36 - naturalness to the resulting frame and
125:38 - for me
125:40 - that actually truly makes the felt the
125:42 - the frame feels cinematic but that's not
125:45 - all of course the HD post-doc includes a
125:47 - completely new motion blur far better
125:50 - quality faster performance wider and
125:54 - more precise blurs and also no halo
125:56 - artifacts there is a new film grain for
125:59 - HD that makes you really feel like a
126:02 - perfect cinematic grain quality and
126:05 - there's a really good reason for it
126:07 - because we relied in a high resolution
126:08 - reference grain but artists can't eek
126:11 - scanning the grains and make it their
126:14 - own now there's one more component to HD
126:18 - post-processing stack that I personally
126:19 - find very handy
126:20 - it's the panini projection which is a
126:23 - mathematical rule for constructing
126:24 - perspective for very wide fields of view
126:28 - it's not named after sandwich it is in
126:31 - fact named in honor of John Paul a
126:33 - panini an 18th century Roman painter and
126:36 - a professor of perspective this obscure
126:39 - mathematical formula integrated to the
126:41 - new HD Poe stack enables creators to
126:44 - work with a wide variety of display form
126:46 - factors you set it up in a minute and it
126:49 - doesn't matter if you display it on a 16
126:52 - by 9 on a phone screen or on an ultra
126:54 - wide display at a keynote it just works
126:56 - and I want to thank again to the amazing
127:00 - demo team to interpret introducing us to
127:03 - this beautiful world of The Heretic
127:05 - and I also want to thank Nathalie
127:15 - that's a wrap for our show tonight we
127:18 - covered a lot of ground from
127:20 - demonstrating why unity is the platform
127:22 - for mobile game developers to showing
127:25 - you how much progress we've made with
127:27 - performance and graphics and we look
127:30 - forward to launching 2019 dot one with
127:32 - you this spring thank you and of course
127:36 - have a fantastic GDC
127:45 - I was back oh my goodness what did you
127:48 - think of that Liz what what to end on
127:51 - like The Heretic is just insane and I
127:53 - get chills every time I see it like
127:55 - we've seen bits internally and now that
127:57 - it's done veiled we've had it spoiled
127:59 - but you just got it for the first time
128:01 - you're amazing thank you I can't help
128:05 - but feel that maybe we've sport people a
128:07 - little bit too much tonight with with
128:09 - with too much unity goodness oh one
128:12 - thing sorry that I will say is the
128:13 - heretic is on the booth so heretic and
128:16 - ECS is on the booth we're going to be
128:18 - demoing it if you want to see this more
128:20 - in-depth come we can't wait to show you
128:24 - yeah and also the the ray-tracing demo
128:27 - the BMW thing I think we made the same
128:30 - mistake I thought the other car was the
128:33 - specular was super-high I was like
128:34 - that's the fake one no you go to unity
128:40 - 3d comm slash ray - tracing you can
128:44 - check out that demo properly and get
128:45 - really in-depth with it I think that's
128:47 - on the booth as well I'm not entirely
128:48 - sure it might be but you can also check
128:51 - out the heretic you can watch it again
128:53 - on youtube keep watching it back keep
128:55 - seeing all those tiny amazing details
128:57 - what else did you enjoy tonight this it
129:00 - was great to see so many titles using
129:02 - lightweight render pipelines laughs -
129:04 - that was awesome I loved the aerial
129:06 - water shader effect yeah and like the
129:09 - usability of it to create other kind of
129:11 - systems and that's yeah I'm looking
129:14 - forward to playing around with the whole
129:15 - nested sub crafting I really love to a
129:22 - our foundation as well audience
129:29 - interaction and don't forget Jo said
129:32 - maybe you should watch the Google
129:34 - keynote tomorrow go and check out and I
129:39 - am they're unveiling things we can't
129:41 - talk about but it's really cool yeah
129:43 - subscribe to our YouTube channel keep
129:45 - watching us keep tracking us and you'll
129:47 - see a whole lot of this stuff everything
129:49 - from GDC will be there and you'll get it
129:51 - all first so thank you thank you indeed
129:55 - thank you all for watching
129:57 - we'll see you next time at unite in
129:59 - September and Copenhagen but for now
130:01 - good night have a great GDC right
