00:00 - [Music]
00:03 - hello everyone and welcome to video
00:05 - number 27 in our Survival game series
00:08 - done by breis I am the CEO of breis and
00:11 - in this video we are going to dig into
00:15 - mechanim uh so mechanim was launched
00:18 - with unity 4 and it's basically the
00:21 - animation system of unity so uh mechm is
00:26 - is really powerful and you can do a lot
00:30 - of things with this but make sure you
00:32 - have your Unity updated or else you
00:34 - won't be able to do these things so uh
00:38 - we are going to look at a pretty basic
00:41 - uh mechanism
00:43 - setup and uh and here we have the a
00:47 - picture I just quickly threw together uh
00:50 - which explains uh kind of the setup we
00:52 - are going to use uh this is not the
00:55 - exact blend tree we're going to be using
00:58 - but it's just uh to show you you how you
01:00 - could uh set things together so on our
01:04 - player we have our main camera and under
01:06 - our main camera we have our
01:08 - arms on them we have the animated
01:10 - component storing a controller and
01:14 - that's really what we're going to focus
01:16 - on in this video if you want to know how
01:18 - to set up these arms and import them
01:21 - correctly uh watch tutorial number 25 I
01:26 - believe uh where we do just that that's
01:28 - two videos ago
01:31 - um but basically the controller the
01:34 - mechanim controller is what allows us to
01:37 - add animation and blend between them
01:40 - depending on variables which we can then
01:43 - declare in a script and that's a really
01:45 - long sentence uh and you might not
01:48 - understand this yet but I will expl
01:51 - explain a lot of things so uh don't
01:54 - worry about
01:55 - that okay so this is basically how a uh
01:59 - me controller could look and uh it
02:02 - stores different animations in here we
02:04 - have three different animation we have
02:06 - standing we have jump and we have
02:09 - punch so uh if we just zoom in on this
02:14 - we might be able to yeah so we have the
02:17 - standing we have the jump and we have
02:18 - the punch and from the different
02:21 - animations to the other we have
02:24 - Transitions and these transitions uh do
02:28 - several things there information about
02:30 - how we want to blend between
02:34 - animations uh so how they should
02:36 - physically uh move between and and how
02:40 - long of a fading time that should have
02:42 - and and so on uh but they also store
02:45 - information about when to um to
02:49 - transition so for example if we would
02:51 - determine whether or not we are running
02:53 - uh we would do this depending on a speed
02:56 - variable or if if we want to determine
02:59 - whether or not we're jumping we would do
03:01 - it using a Boolean which is a true or
03:05 - false okay so let's now actually dig
03:08 - into unity and uh apply
03:11 - this so here we have our arms and if we
03:15 - go under our uh and find them in our
03:18 - project pane there we can see we have
03:21 - the animations set up so they are
03:24 - working just fine and now we want to
03:27 - apply them in
03:28 - game and last video we uh or the last
03:32 - video where we made animation we covered
03:35 - uh how to add the controller so this is
03:38 - how our controller looks so far and this
03:40 - is just basically one single state which
03:44 - is the idle using the idle motion or the
03:48 - idle animation clip and it's playing
03:51 - with a speed of one and the reason why
03:54 - this is Orange is because because it's
03:56 - the default clip it's going to play so
03:59 - if we right cck click on it and hit the
04:01 - uh make set as default we can make this
04:04 - the default
04:06 - clip so uh so that's really useful and
04:10 - that's usual the idle animation you want
04:12 - to be set as
04:14 - default uh next up we have this and this
04:17 - is just included in any uh controller in
04:20 - mechm uh by default this is called the
04:24 - Nate and this allows us to just blend
04:27 - into uh animation no matter what state
04:31 - we're in so normally you have uh you
04:34 - make transitions from states to States
04:36 - but this will allow us to blend into uh
04:39 - an animation from any state meaning that
04:42 - if we would for example want to include
04:44 - an animation uh where we die so if our
04:48 - player dies we want to be able to do
04:51 - that whether or not he's running or
04:53 - hitting something or idling whatever we
04:56 - want to be able to go to the dying and
04:59 - so so we would have an animation set
05:01 - from the any State uh it's really
05:04 - important though that you remember to
05:06 - make an if uh on the transition so that
05:09 - it won't just die all the time okay but
05:12 - that's not what we are going to focus on
05:13 - now I'm getting ahead of myself so uh
05:16 - let's just really focus on this so let's
05:18 - add in some more animation clips and uh
05:21 - the next one I want to make is uh the
05:23 - WEA the idle animation so we could go
05:27 - under our arms and then select our anim
05:29 - clip and just drag it in so let's do
05:31 - that so under our arms expand that and
05:34 - then have the idle with uh weapon uh
05:38 - select select it and then just drag it
05:41 - in and here we see it so let's just move
05:45 - these over here so we can have a good
05:48 - view so basically uh we want to uh play
05:52 - the idol by default but if we then equip
05:55 - the weapon we want this to be playing so
05:58 - let's just turn off the fot I okay and
06:01 - let's make a
06:02 - transition and you do this by right
06:04 - clicking from where you want to
06:06 - transition hitting make transition and
06:08 - then clicking to where you want to
06:11 - transition and uh let's now H click on
06:14 - this
06:16 - transition uh and so you can see we have
06:19 - quite a few things going on this up here
06:22 - is not what something we want to focus
06:24 - on so we can just ignore that we want to
06:27 - turn turn off the at
06:31 - here then we want to set a condition so
06:36 - the condition uh is the if statement
06:40 - basic basically so this was will allow
06:43 - us to have a mechan him check whether or
06:46 - not something is true before actually um
06:51 - transitioning so let's make a new one so
06:54 - let's make a plus well actually let's
06:57 - just change this one by default you have
07:00 - the uh condition called exit time and
07:03 - this allows you to just transition back
07:06 - whenever the animation is done playing
07:08 - so if you want to just transition back
07:10 - when you have played it once for example
07:12 - in an attack animation you can use the
07:14 - exit
07:16 - time but uh before we can make a
07:19 - condition we want to add a parameter and
07:20 - a parameter is basically a variable so
07:23 - hit the uh plus Down Under the
07:25 - parameters and then uh select the
07:28 - Boolean we want to uh call this weapon
07:33 - is
07:36 - on and uh or we could call it equipped
07:39 - let's just leave it at on so we don't
07:40 - have to type all that much and now we
07:43 - can click back back on the transition go
07:46 - under conditions change it to weapon is
07:50 - on and then true so if we put on our
07:53 - weapon it will transition to the idle
07:55 - with
07:56 - weapon and this is a timeline
07:59 - so here you can scrub through your
08:01 - animation and you will see it changing
08:03 - in your preview so if we just expand on
08:06 - this just a bit we can see it playing
08:10 - here whenever we change the
08:13 - slider and so we can go in and zoom in
08:17 - here and use alt to navigate
08:21 - around and then we can go to this point
08:23 - where the idle with weapon starts and we
08:26 - can see that it's fading down here
08:29 - so let's just hit play and see if this
08:31 - is is
08:33 - fitting I want that to be just a bit
08:36 - quicker the closing of the hands so what
08:39 - we can do is we can zoom it in even more
08:42 - so now we can really see the
08:44 - transition and then we can take the end
08:46 - of the
08:47 - transition and just close that in or you
08:50 - could take the start and close that in
08:53 - but we are just going to go with the end
08:55 - here so bring in the end a bit there we
08:59 - go and if you want uh this idle with
09:02 - weapons to start right at the transition
09:04 - you can just drag it all the way to the
09:06 - right and it will snap back now let's
09:08 - hit
09:09 - play and the fingers close closes really
09:13 - fast so hit play and that looks great so
09:16 - that's how it will blend and uh when
09:19 - we're satisfied with that I am now uh we
09:22 - can go ahead and make the transition
09:24 - back again to the idle so hit on idle
09:26 - with with weapon then hit make
09:29 - transition and go back to the
09:32 - idol uh and so now under the conditions
09:35 - we want weapon is on to be false and if
09:39 - we zoom in we can adjust the
09:42 - transitioning here so let's hit play and
09:45 - that's really too slow again so let's
09:47 - just drag this
09:49 - in that's a bit too fast this is really
09:53 - a matter of
09:55 - preference that's really great so uh you
09:58 - could have an animation uh that will
10:01 - actually pick up or switch the animation
10:04 - here uh so so we could have him pick it
10:07 - up from the back or uh from the ground
10:11 - but for now we're going to go with the
10:12 - simplest so just have it um open and
10:15 - close and then the uh weapon will later
10:18 - just spawn in on his hand but that's
10:20 - something we're going to cover again the
10:22 - inventory system is on its
10:24 - way okay great so next uh next up let's
10:29 - create uh just a state for running uh so
10:32 - under the parameters here we can have
10:34 - the uh speed variable uh and for now
10:38 - let's just set it to something like
10:40 - three so under here the parameters hit
10:43 - the plus sign make this a float change
10:46 - this to
10:48 - speed and let's just have that at
10:50 - default at uh zero actually let's just
10:54 - start out by having this a Boolean so we
10:56 - can quickly test it out so make that a
10:58 - Boolean instead call it speed and uh now
11:03 - we can just uh or is running let's call
11:05 - it that so is running uh and now we can
11:08 - just have a state with the running uh so
11:11 - now we can just quickly test it out and
11:13 - then later in the script we will have it
11:15 - be a a float so that we can uh determine
11:18 - the speed inside of meing them if you
11:21 - didn't get that that's all right uh but
11:23 - let's drag in the Run animation onto
11:26 - mechm and hit the foot K turn that off
11:31 - and uh the Run animation is basically
11:33 - something we want to be able to shift to
11:36 - uh from both the idle and the idle with
11:39 - with weapon uh we don't want it in the
11:41 - any state because we don't want to
11:43 - switch to run while uh while hitting uh
11:47 - something um you could do do that some
11:51 - uh games do that but I don't want this
11:53 - game to do
11:54 - that uh so now let's hit the idle hit
11:57 - the make transition and then click on on
11:59 - run now select the
12:01 - transition and the condition should be
12:03 - changed to is running and that should be
12:07 - true and now let's go down to where it
12:11 - fades zoom in on this try toit
12:16 - play and that actually looks pretty
12:21 - good yeah I'm satisfied with that um we
12:24 - could make it just a bit
12:27 - slower
12:29 - yeah I like that uh and now let's make
12:32 - the transition back again so run make
12:35 - Transition then idle and let's again set
12:38 - the condition to is running equals
12:41 - false and let's zoom in on the
12:43 - transitioning
12:45 - play and that looks great already I
12:49 - think sweet now let's do the same with
12:52 - idle with weapon so make transition and
12:55 - then click on run the condition should
12:58 - be is running equals
13:00 - true let's have a look at how it behaves
13:05 - so hit
13:07 - play that's pretty great a little bit of
13:10 - sudden movement maybe we could have this
13:13 - extended just a
13:17 - bit that's really great that was maybe a
13:21 - bit too
13:23 - much that's perfect and now let's make
13:26 - the transition back again and uh
13:29 - and that set this to is running equals
13:33 - false and let's see if this
13:35 - works that looks
13:38 - great yeah okay so um you might think
13:43 - that this would work though we have one
13:46 - problem with the setup we have now and
13:49 - that is if we take a look at our
13:51 - transitioning back from the run so the
13:54 - two back transitions here to the idle
13:57 - and to the idle with with weapon
13:59 - they have the exact same
14:02 - conditions and so this would make run
14:05 - confused whether or not it should
14:07 - transition to the idle or the idle with
14:09 - weapon if it's no longer running so on
14:13 - this we want to add another condition so
14:16 - from the run to the idle select the
14:18 - transition hit plus and then say weapon
14:21 - is on equals false so we want to
14:23 - transition back to the idle if the
14:26 - running is false and the weapon is on is
14:29 - false then select the other transition
14:31 - from the run to the idle with weapon add
14:34 - another condition weapon is on should be
14:37 - true so if it's not running but it has
14:40 - the uh weapon
14:42 - equipped it should transition back to
14:44 - the Idol with with weapon let's see if
14:47 - this is working so we could drag down
14:50 - our animator to our project
14:52 - pane maybe drag it up a bit so this is
14:56 - how it looks let's select the game and
14:59 - hit
15:02 - play remember that whenever we don't see
15:05 - something animating down here all we
15:07 - have to do is Select our
15:09 - arms and then hit the apply root Mo
15:12 - motion you really just have to turn this
15:15 - on and off it's a bug with unity and
15:18 - something I haven't found out how to
15:20 - solve yet but let's hit the play now and
15:24 - we can see it animating we can see the
15:26 - little progress bar down here and now
15:29 - you can go down to the mechanim
15:31 - window and we can hit the weapon is
15:34 - on and now it changes and it Loops
15:39 - perfectly now we could change to is
15:42 - running so we see the arms
15:45 - running if we then unequipped our weapon
15:48 - while we're running so change the weapon
15:50 - is on to
15:52 - false and then turn off the is running
15:55 - it goes back to the idle animation and
15:57 - so we can play around with these things
16:00 - to see how they transition back and
16:02 - forth and this looks overall really
16:05 - fluent and uh it's a great setup so
16:09 - far uh so that's it for this part of
16:12 - this video um I am sorry I have to split
16:15 - it up but else I would go uh just ramble
16:19 - along for too long I think uh but in the
16:22 - next one we're going to set up hitting
16:25 - uh so we are going to get in our
16:26 - animation Clips uh with the uh swing
16:29 - animations and the punch animations and
16:32 - that's going to be really awesome after
16:34 - that we'll take look at inventory
16:36 - systems weapon switching and so on and
16:39 - so forth I hope you enjoyed the video
16:41 - guys and I'll see you in the next
16:43 - [Music]
16:52 - one
