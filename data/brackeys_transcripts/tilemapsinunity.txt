00:00 - making your game art in tiles can be
00:02 - beneficial in a lot of ways because
00:04 - tiles are so modular talipes make it
00:07 - easy to create new levels and modify
00:09 - existing ones some good examples of
00:11 - games that utilize star maps really well
00:14 - of course classics like Mario and
00:16 - Pokemon but also a lot of newer indie
00:18 - games like spelunky and stardew valley
00:21 - take advantage of this art style so in
00:23 - this video we'll have a look at how to
00:25 - use unity spilled in town map system
00:27 - also special thanks to Judy Minh passio
00:29 - infinity PBR yo Rio myrrh and hence Huff
00:32 - tuned for their support on patreon and
00:34 - with that let's get started so just open
00:36 - up unity and currently we have nothing
00:38 - in here but in order to start creating
00:40 - tile maps we need to have a tile set I
00:42 - went online and found this pretty cool
00:44 - tile set by Leonard Papen as you can see
00:47 - there are a bunch of different elements
00:48 - like rocks dirt grass and water and if
00:51 - we have a look at the ground tiles only
00:54 - this is what we see of course if you
00:56 - want to learn how to create your own
00:57 - tile sets I have a tutorial on how to do
01:00 - that in Photoshop but there are really a
01:02 - bunch of towels in here and there are
01:04 - even multiple tile sets for the
01:06 - different elements in the scene so just
01:08 - to keep things simple for this tutorial
01:10 - I've gone ahead and created a simpler
01:12 - version of the tile set and I'll of
01:14 - course have a download link for that in
01:15 - the description let's take this file and
01:17 - import it into unity let's click on it
01:20 - and you can see here I've just selected
01:21 - the most basic ones now first we want to
01:24 - make sure the texture type is set to
01:25 - sprite 2d and you I will then change the
01:27 - sprite mode from single to multiple
01:29 - because we have multiple sprites in here
01:31 - we'll also change the pixels per unit to
01:34 - 32 the reason why is that the size of
01:37 - each tile in my tile map is 32 and I
01:40 - want one tile to be one unit big then
01:42 - because we're dealing with pixel art we
01:44 - want to set the filter mode to point so
01:46 - it doesn't get blurred out and we can
01:48 - also go down here and disable
01:49 - compression now if we apply these
01:51 - settings we can open up the sprite
01:53 - editor and here we want to define each
01:55 - individual tile luckily we don't have to
01:58 - do all this by hand we can simply use
02:00 - the slice option up here change from
02:02 - automatic to grid by cell size because
02:05 - we know the size of each tile that's of
02:07 - course 32 by 32 units with no offset and
02:11 - no padding and we can just go ahead and
02:12 - hit slice
02:13 - and you can see it actually
02:14 - automatically registers all of our tasks
02:17 - I definitely recommend you go through
02:19 - and see if everything is here it
02:21 - certainly looks like it
02:22 - with that we can simply hit apply and if
02:25 - we now close down our sprite editor we
02:27 - can drop down this menu on our object
02:29 - and here we have each individual tile as
02:32 - a sprite so next what we want to do is
02:34 - create a tile map to do that we go to
02:37 - the hierarchy right click go to the
02:40 - object and select tile map and you can
02:42 - see it automatically creates this object
02:44 - called a grid that's because all-time
02:47 - maps in unity are rendered using a grid
02:49 - so if we go to the scene view we can see
02:51 - all of the grid lines and of course in
02:54 - each of these grid cells we can now play
02:56 - styles if you've ever used the UI system
02:58 - think of the grid just like a UI canvas
03:01 - we can of course configure stuff like
03:03 - cell size and gap here but in most cases
03:05 - you probably just want to leave those be
03:07 - then we can expand this object and under
03:10 - here we have our tile map now you can
03:12 - consider a tile map in unity kind of
03:14 - like a layer if we want multiple tiles
03:16 - on top of each other we simply want to
03:19 - create multiple tile map that we can
03:21 - draw onto so this here is our first tile
03:24 - map layer and so we can call it
03:25 - something like tile map on the score
03:28 - base just to those soaps know what we
03:30 - want to paint onto here and our Tama has
03:32 - two components a tile map which has
03:34 - configurations for the layer an atomic
03:37 - renderer where you can configure stuff
03:38 - like what material to use but we just
03:41 - want to leave all that by default and
03:43 - instead we want to go window and bring
03:45 - up our tile palette and this window is
03:47 - where we find all of our tile painting
03:49 - tools we can go ahead and dock this to
03:51 - the right of our scene view and maybe
03:53 - also give it a bit more space now as you
03:56 - can see we have a bunch of different
03:57 - tools at the top I'm gonna show you what
03:59 - each of these do in a second first we
04:01 - want to create a palette and a palette
04:03 - is basically just a collection of tiles
04:05 - that you can choose from at any given
04:07 - time so we want to go ahead and create a
04:09 - new palette and we'll call this palette
04:11 - something like ground Taos we just
04:13 - wanted to be a rectangular grid and
04:15 - we'll set the cell size to automatic and
04:17 - now we can hit create now each palette
04:19 - is stored as an object in your project
04:21 - so we could go and create a new folder
04:24 - here for all of our palettes so I'm
04:26 - gonna call this pal
04:27 - it's and we can go into the folder and
04:29 - hit select and there we go we now have
04:31 - an object in here called ground Taos and
04:34 - you can also see it's selected right
04:36 - here and in fact it already tells you
04:37 - what to do drag tile sprite or sprite
04:40 - text your assets here in order to add
04:42 - them so we can go to our tile set
04:43 - example and select each one of our
04:45 - sprites
04:48 - and then simply drag them into a
04:50 - tarpaulin a unit is going to generate a
04:53 - tile asset for each sprite and since we
04:55 - have quite a few sprites this means
04:57 - quite a few assets so you probably want
04:59 - to go ahead and create a subfolder for
05:01 - this we can call it Taos and just to
05:03 - stay very organized inside of this will
05:05 - create another folder called ground Taos
05:08 - let's hit select and unity will go
05:10 - through and generate all the appropriate
05:11 - tile assets and as soon as it's done we
05:14 - should see all of them in our tile
05:15 - palette you can also see on the left
05:17 - hand side here that if we go under our
05:19 - tiles folder and underground tiles all
05:21 - of our tile assets are here and if we
05:24 - select one of them we can either change
05:26 - the sprite that the tile asset uses we
05:29 - can tinted a certain color or miss with
05:31 - the Collider type but again for now
05:33 - we'll just leave all those as is and
05:35 - this is where we get to the most
05:37 - annoying part of using tiles using the
05:40 - current Tao system because you'll notice
05:42 - that our tiles are laid out in a very
05:45 - chaotic way
05:51 - so now we're actually ready to start
05:53 - painting using our tasks to do this I
05:56 - want to switch to the brush mode the
05:58 - shortcut for this is of course B and now
06:01 - we can start selecting tiles inside of
06:03 - our tile map so say we want to select
06:05 - the corner right here and then simply
06:07 - move our mouse into the scene view in
06:09 - order to start placing these you can
06:11 - also select multiple tasks if you want
06:13 - to paint more at a time so I'm going to
06:16 - start painting away on a tiny level
06:21 - you'll notice if I switch to the game
06:24 - view now I have these weird ugly lines
06:27 - the reason why is we need to go to edit
06:29 - project settings and then quality and in
06:32 - here we'll make sure to disable
06:33 - anti-aliasing anti-aliasing is meant to
06:36 - play out edges in three-dimensional
06:38 - graphics but since we want very hard
06:40 - edges here in order to not see between
06:42 - the top apps we definitely want to have
06:44 - this disabled so I've laid the
06:46 - foundation of my tile map here and I
06:48 - want to move it kind of into the
06:49 - vicinity of my camera so I'll take the
06:51 - selection tool select the entire tile
06:54 - map select the move tool and then move
06:56 - it over some of the tools that are handy
06:58 - is if you're using the brush tool and
07:00 - want to erase we can simply hold down
07:02 - shift in order to do that we can also
07:04 - select the box tool using this we can
07:07 - fill a rectangular part of the map you
07:10 - can also select a tile by using the mark
07:12 - tool I normally just use this by holding
07:15 - down control and picking the tile that I
07:17 - would like to paint with and finally we
07:19 - can use the bucket tool the one on the
07:21 - far right by hitting G and this will
07:22 - fill out holes using the selected tile
07:25 - so think I'm gonna paint some water into
07:27 - my scene here I'll see you in a second
07:31 - I'm also going to surround it with some
07:34 - grass
07:35 - [Music]
07:37 - so now I'm satisfied with the based of
07:39 - my tile map but I definitely want to
07:42 - overlay some objects on top of this
07:44 - especially they want to add some rocky
07:46 - parts to my level and you'll notice if I
07:48 - just select this and start painting on
07:50 - top of what I've already made it looks
07:52 - really weird and the reason why is that
07:55 - parts of these time-lapse here aren't
07:57 - transparent so we need the base layer to
08:00 - still be underneath luckily we know that
08:02 - each tile map act as a layer so all we
08:06 - need to do is go into a grid right click
08:08 - go into 2d and create another tile map
08:10 - and we can now rename it to tile map
08:13 - underscore rock we also want to make
08:16 - sure to set the ordering layer for this
08:18 - to be greater so that all of the tiles
08:20 - that we paint appear on top I'm just
08:22 - gonna set it to 1 you can of course also
08:24 - put it on a separate sorting layer now
08:27 - we'll switch to our tile palette we
08:29 - still want to paint using our ground
08:30 - tiles but we want to change the active
08:32 - tile map from tile map base to tile map
08:34 - Rock and now if we switch to the brush
08:37 - tool you can see that we can easily
08:38 - start painting away with these rock
08:40 - sprites there we go so finally I'll just
08:47 - take my camera here and zoom it out a
08:50 - tiny bit so we can see more of the level
08:52 - and we've now created our first level
08:54 - using tile Maps in unity of course
08:57 - there's still so much you can add to
08:58 - this but as a base that looks awesome so
09:01 - other than the stuff that unity has
09:02 - currently built into the editor they've
09:04 - also created a bunch of tile map
09:06 - features which aren't yet integrated you
09:09 - can actually find these on the unity
09:10 - github on the 2d extras I'll of course
09:12 - have a link for this in the description
09:13 - if you want to use these yourself simply
09:16 - hit clone or download and you can
09:17 - download it as a zip file and open it
09:19 - right up in unity in fact they also have
09:22 - another repository called to detect
09:24 - demos I'll have a link for this as well
09:26 - and this includes all the extra features
09:28 - along with example scenes so if there's
09:30 - something you want to learn how to do
09:32 - you can check out how unity recommend to
09:33 - you to do it so that's really cool and
09:35 - let me just go ahead and show you what
09:37 - some of this stuff is so I've opened up
09:39 - the to detect demos and I've created an
09:41 - in T palette here and if I now go to the
09:44 - project and right click I can go into
09:45 - create and I still have an option called
09:47 - tile here but at the very bottom I also
09:50 - options for animated tiles pipeline
09:52 - tiles random tiles and a bunch of others
09:55 - let's just try out the animated tile
09:58 - we'll call this one waterfall base and
10:00 - this of course allows us to create tiles
10:02 - with animation so in here we can define
10:05 - the number of animated sprites that you
10:07 - want to have in your animation let's set
10:09 - this to 5 and now we get 5 sprite
10:11 - let's take the first one here let's
10:13 - search for waterfall let's select the
10:16 - first one here let's go through and do
10:18 - that until we've selected all of them
10:20 - all 0 through 4 here and the rest of the
10:23 - things we could leave as is if we now
10:25 - drag this into the tile palette you can
10:27 - see that nothing really happens but if
10:29 - we then take our paintbrush and make
10:32 - sure to create a tile map over here in
10:34 - the hierarchy so right click to the
10:36 - object tile map we can select our
10:38 - waterfall and paint it into our scene
10:41 - and if we now hit play you can see our
10:43 - waterfall animating of course it's
10:45 - currently doing so really slowly to
10:48 - change that we can go under grid under
10:50 - the tile map and change the animation
10:52 - frame rate let's bump this up to
10:53 - something like 15 and now when we hit
10:56 - play we have an animating waterfall I'm
10:58 - gonna go ahead and duplicate this one
11:00 - and rename it to waterfall foam and I'm
11:03 - going to go through each sprite here and
11:05 - change it to the bottom of the waterfall
11:07 - so
11:10 - there we go we now drag this into a town
11:13 - map as well select our brush tool
11:15 - selected inside of our tile palette and
11:18 - suddenly we can paint with it
11:22 - if we now hit play we can see that we've
11:24 - added a waterfall to our game and this
11:27 - is just one example of the extra
11:29 - features another one is the ability to
11:31 - set up rule-based tiles if we go into
11:33 - the scene view and erase what we have we
11:35 - can instead change our palette to one of
11:37 - the included ones here I'm gonna go
11:39 - under terrain tiles I'm gonna select one
11:42 - of the tiles in our terrain here and I'm
11:44 - simply going to start painting and you
11:46 - can see automatically unity recognizes
11:49 - what tiles are nearby and inserts the
11:52 - appropriate one of course we could do
11:54 - all of this by hand but having a simple
11:56 - system like this just makes everything
11:58 - much much quicker and if we go inside of
12:01 - our tile map folder under tiles and
12:03 - terrain tile we can open up the example
12:06 - scene for this to see how unity has laid
12:08 - this out and we can also go under tile
12:10 - assets and select one of the assets and
12:13 - here you can see all the different
12:14 - sprites that make up this asset so the
12:16 - left here our rules
12:17 - in other words how the tile should be
12:19 - designed and to the right here we
12:21 - specify a sprite that is - signed in
12:23 - this way
12:24 - so we have a filled one we have one with
12:26 - three sides we have one with two sides
12:28 - on the corner we have one with just two
12:30 - adjacent sides two opposite sides and so
12:33 - on if you want to set this up yourself
12:34 - you of course need to create all the
12:36 - appropriate sprites in that case I would
12:39 - definitely recommend basing it off of
12:40 - the sprites that you need to have
12:42 - created for this example so that should
12:44 - definitely be enough to get you started
12:46 - and if you're hungry for more features
12:48 - just check out the unity github repos
12:50 - there's some nice hidden gems there
12:52 - that's pretty much it for this video if
12:53 - you want to learn how to create your own
12:55 - tile sets I have a tutorial on how to do
12:57 - that in Photoshop that you can check out
12:59 - also if you like these videos and want
13:01 - to support them you can do so over at
13:03 - patreon with patreon you can make a
