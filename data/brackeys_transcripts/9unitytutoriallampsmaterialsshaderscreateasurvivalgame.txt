00:03 - hello everyone and Welcome to our ninth
00:06 - video in our survival gam series done by
00:08 - brais I am the CEO of brais and today we
00:11 - are going to take a quick look at
00:13 - creating um materials and textures to
00:16 - and applying them to objects and uh also
00:20 - creating um some cool lighting some uh
00:23 - some point lights and some glowing
00:25 - effects and uh stuff like this um so
00:30 - first of all go ahead and over up Unity
00:32 - it looks exactly like it did before and
00:35 - uh I'm going to go ahead and rename this
00:37 - terrain to um
00:40 - grassy
00:42 - terrain if we're going to have multiple
00:44 - levels or it's going to persist of
00:46 - different kind of terrains and first of
00:49 - all something that annoyed me is just
00:51 - how much green uh this terrain has um so
00:55 - let's uh go ahead and create a road that
00:58 - leads up to our house so um we can uh go
01:02 - ahead and select the brushes and then
01:05 - open up our browser uh and look for a
01:10 - texture Road texture um and I'm sure
01:14 - that if you search for Rog texture it
01:17 - could be hard to find something we could
01:20 - try it out um yes it's it's going to
01:23 - look something like this and we could
01:25 - make it out of concrete um but I won't
01:30 - something more like gravel gravel
01:34 - texture
01:37 - seamless um yeah I think this actually
01:41 - is pretty good um could try that out uh
01:46 - this one is not bad
01:49 - either um actually let's uh get this a
01:53 - try so um save it up and uh drag it into
01:56 - unity and once again rename it we going
02:00 - to rename this to gravel
02:03 - texture
02:05 - 01 and uh we're going to uh simply
02:09 - select our terrain also one thing I
02:11 - forgot in our project pane go down and
02:15 - rename the terrain that lies here so
02:17 - this is basically the backup data for
02:19 - the terrain that is in our scene and
02:21 - let's uh name this exactly the same so
02:24 - grassy terrain now select our Terrain in
02:28 - the scene go to edit t textures add
02:30 - texture and then just drag in our gravel
02:35 - and uh the size is going to be let's
02:37 - start out by 10 by 10 and add select it
02:44 - and we can then go ahead and just simply
02:47 - paint it out so um I'll select a brush
02:52 - that is a little more rough in it its
02:56 - edges maybe that one and and uh bring
03:00 - the brush size down something like this
03:05 - and then simply uh start painting
03:08 - so it'll just go
03:11 - around like this and where ends up with
03:16 - the mountain might not look that good uh
03:20 - might not look that good either here but
03:23 - this is basically where I want a small
03:25 - City or Village to be so I'll just make
03:29 - something like this for now very classic
03:32 - RPG type game um looking something like
03:36 - this let's go ahead and preview this in
03:39 - game um so I think that the texture is
03:42 - too big uh generally the the textures
03:45 - are too big so um I guess we'll just
03:48 - leave that and adjust those later um not
03:51 - the best textures that I've chosen um
03:54 - but um this just applies some detail
03:58 - it's nice all right so um you can go
04:01 - ahead and save this um and let's now
04:05 - look at uh creating some textures for
04:08 - the walls so let's just choose some kind
04:11 - of wooden walls um if we are uh using
04:16 - maces and swords you might not have made
04:19 - the those out of bricks so let's
04:23 - type plank texture
04:28 - seamless see see if anything comes up
04:31 - yes this one is not
04:34 - bad looks like something that could have
04:36 - stood outside so save this and drag it
04:40 - into unity and you probably know the
04:43 - procedure so far so um planks texture 01
04:50 - also you don't have to put texture um on
04:54 - in every every name just use your own
04:58 - system right so um the input settings
05:01 - looks
05:02 - fine uh now let's go ahead and create a
05:05 - new material so um the terrain basically
05:08 - doesn't need it material it handles sort
05:11 - of this lighting properties and that
05:13 - itself so uh but a object does so let's
05:18 - hit the um let's right right click in
05:21 - our assets hit create material and then
05:26 - uh call this planks
05:30 - and drag in our texture the main color
05:33 - still needs to be white um it's going to
05:36 - be a diffuse texture and then we can
05:39 - just go ahead and drag it on to our
05:42 - different
05:43 - walls and uh something that has been
05:47 - annoying me a bit is the fact that these
05:52 - um are not actually
05:56 - on the wooden plate so um let's just go
06:00 - ahead and adjust the
06:03 - transform to make
06:08 - them a
06:11 - little more
06:14 - precise no need to be perfect um again
06:17 - this should be done in other
06:19 - applications I'm just showing you how to
06:20 - do
06:21 - this especially the modeling part the
06:24 - texturing can be done in unity just
06:26 - using seamless but um come on guys I'm
06:30 - sure you can figure something out all
06:33 - right so um this looks better if we go
06:35 - ahead and preview it in game I can see
06:39 - that we might want to uh tile these one
06:43 - more time so this is done by selecting
06:46 - the material and go on tiling and then
06:49 - hitting 2 two let's try that yeah this
06:53 - looks better actually maybe
06:56 - two or uh 3 two
07:00 - so it tiles one extra down the middle I
07:04 - think this uh this looks good kind of a
07:07 - highr texture so um one thing uh I I
07:11 - want to change now is that this is just
07:13 - a diffuse Shader I want to apply some
07:15 - more lighting detail um there no needs
07:19 - for you to do this but um at some point
07:22 - I think we should go into normal mapping
07:25 - and uh bump mapping and all these
07:28 - different kind of kinds of techniques so
07:31 - um if if you are way ahead you can go
07:34 - ahead and download Crazy bump and uh see
07:37 - if you can figure it out yourself but
07:39 - for now uh let's create a model that can
07:42 - act as our lights so uh or lamp so let's
07:47 - go ahead and go under game object create
07:51 - other and then hitting this feere and 0
07:56 - z0 bringing it up a bit
08:00 - hitting F to zoom in game object create
08:03 - other and then
08:06 - cylinder scaling it
08:09 - down this is a
08:13 - mount on the
08:16 - wall uh so this will act as a
08:20 - mount
08:23 - and scale it
08:25 - [Music]
08:26 - down create yet another game object this
08:30 - is going to be a cube track it down
08:32 - scale it down make it
08:36 - longer this is actually the part that is
08:39 - going to be mounted on the wall and
08:43 - bigger on
08:45 - some axis scale it down to look like a
08:51 - plank there you go this is pretty
08:55 - decent not
08:57 - amazing but it'll do for now now so this
09:00 - is our lamp that we can mount on our
09:02 - wall so we can go ahead and rename the
09:05 - sphere to
09:07 - lamp and we can go ahead and make this
09:10 - our
09:12 - Mount you know what lamp
09:18 - Mount drag that under lamp and we can
09:22 - select our cylinder and do lamp mount
09:28 - mount do uh lamp
09:31 - cylinder this is fine and just drag it
09:33 - on the lamp also so um now we can go
09:37 - ahead and um position
09:40 - it on the
09:44 - wall there and I want to bring it up
09:48 - might be uh too big in general so just
09:51 - scale it
09:53 - down not in general over all and um so
09:57 - that's that is on the wall
10:00 - and you can adjust all all you want
10:03 - um I'm going to leave it at this and uh
10:07 - so I'm going to select different parts
10:10 - and give them different kinds of
10:12 - materials and textures so the light
10:15 - itself the bulb itself which is pretty
10:18 - uh huge here um is going to have a
10:21 - glowing material the lamp cylinder is
10:24 - going to have yet another material and
10:27 - the lamp Mount is going to have a third
10:29 - material so uh I think that the lamp
10:33 - Mount we could probably just apply
10:36 - planks to that one and it will look all
10:38 - right remember the tiling is different
10:40 - so if I apply this and go ahead and
10:43 - change the
10:44 - tiling um it will affect both of them so
10:49 - just keep that in mind that you have to
10:51 - create multiple materials if you want
10:53 - different uh tiling
10:56 - properties so uh let's go ahead and
10:58 - right click can create yet another
11:00 - material and this one is going to be
11:02 - called just uh gray no uh dark
11:07 - gray or gray dark if you want to do it
11:11 - that way and just the main color just
11:13 - drag this down to a almost black
11:17 - and there you go so that's it for the
11:21 - mount what I'm going to scale this Mount
11:25 - down the cylinder there
11:30 - this is
11:31 - better
11:33 - um so that looks better
11:37 - um and now let's go ahead and create the
11:40 - uh the glowing so right click new
11:44 - material call this
11:46 - glow and um there are not really any
11:51 - wonderful ways to make an object glow in
11:54 - unity without spending some money on a
11:57 - plugin so I'm just going to to show you
11:59 - one of the ones that I use uh it could
12:03 - be self-illuminated or unlet whatever
12:07 - you think uh I like the unlit
12:09 - transparent so drag that on uh on there
12:13 - and you can have a texture over it um
12:17 - maybe the
12:18 - self-illuminated
12:20 - diffuse so you can go in and you can uh
12:23 - you can change the color of the light
12:26 - and uh make some illuminated and even
12:29 - make the light mapper itself emit but uh
12:33 - play around with
12:36 - these um again that's not really an
12:39 - awesome way to do it um maybe the self
12:43 - Illuminator um I'm I'm pretty sure that
12:46 - one of these actually have a transparent
12:49 - mode uh you could do the reflective to
12:53 - make it reflect the uh whole
12:56 - environment um so so just
13:00 - play with it you might find something
13:03 - you like at the
13:06 - end
13:10 - um you could also do stuff like uh on
13:13 - the particles you can do
13:15 - additive um Tex uh materials this will
13:20 - only work though if you also apply a
13:24 - texture of course it shouldn't be this
13:27 - texture but something in that
13:31 - order um but okay for now I'll just go
13:33 - ahead and change this to
13:36 - self-illuminated
13:37 - theuse and make the
13:40 - color
13:42 - a orange white is so that looks all
13:48 - right uh I'll go ahead and drag out
13:52 - these two objects so I can scale it down
13:54 - a bit it might be too huge anyway um and
13:57 - then just drag them back in
13:59 - so yeah this is better um now let's go
14:03 - ahead and actually create what will emit
14:06 - the light so go to game object and
14:08 - create other and then choose the point
14:11 - light and um you can see that it already
14:15 - looks much better um this will just be
14:19 - centered in the middle of our sphere and
14:21 - we can go ahead and adjust some of the
14:23 - settings maybe um if we select
14:27 - it uh the the
14:31 - light it's that one and drag it under
14:33 - our lamp we can call this lamp light and
14:38 - um we can go ahead and play around with
14:40 - some of the settings so make it more
14:45 - orange uh bump up the range to maybe 30
14:50 - 20
14:52 - 30 we do 30 and then down the
14:56 - intensity of the light
15:01 - something you like you know what I'll
15:03 - I'll keep this is at
15:06 - 0.5 so um this already looks uh pretty
15:10 - good um if you want it to look like it's
15:13 - glowing a little bit more you can do
15:15 - something that is called haloing so um
15:20 - we could go ahead and hit the
15:23 - component and then go to rendering and
15:27 - hit the
15:30 - where is it the skyx
15:34 - flare cusion uh maybe
15:39 - miscellaneous wow I'm not sure now um oh
15:42 - so it's under effect and then
15:45 - Halo and if we go ahead and adjust
15:48 - it so um I put it this on the lamb
15:52 - itself so if we go ahead and change the
15:55 - size of
15:56 - it you can see what it's actually about
15:59 - so it creates
16:02 - this spher soft object around the object
16:07 - itself so if you just make this a tiny
16:11 - bit
16:12 - bigger than the glowing sphere itself so
16:17 - something like
16:18 - 0.5 and then change the color to maybe
16:21 - something brighter I don't know um for
16:24 - sure make it more orange though then we
16:27 - can actually make something that looks
16:29 - like it grow it glows a
16:32 - bit it's not perfect but it uh it will
16:36 - do the job so there you have it and this
16:39 - light is dyamic dynamic so should you
16:42 - choose to make it rigid body and fall
16:44 - around the scene or animated um
16:46 - everything will animate with it will not
16:49 - do light mapping just yet that's how you
16:52 - create uh some textures um apply them to
16:56 - objects um materials and uh glowing
17:00 - effects I hope you enjoy this tutorial
17:03 - and go ahead and visit our website uh
17:06 - you can play some of our games and soon
17:08 - you can download the uh scripts that I
17:11 - type in the videos and some of the
17:13 - assets that I create so you don't have
17:14 - to create everything yourself if you
17:17 - don't want to or you can just generally
17:19 - buy me a cup of coffee um for now the
17:22 - models and scripts are free you can
17:24 - donate if you want to all the money goes
17:27 - to something like this it goes to new
17:29 - sound gear uh more more plugins maybe I
17:33 - could do some tutorials on Unity Pro
17:35 - once I get the money um so um but you
17:39 - don't have to you can just keep on
17:41 - watching for free I enjoy making these
17:43 - and uh it makes me happy if if you can
17:46 - learn something from it so um thank you
17:49 - for watching
