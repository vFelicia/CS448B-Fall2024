00:02 - hello everyone welcome to the eleventh
00:05 - tutorial in our survival game series
00:08 - done by practice I am the CEO of Brack
00:10 - ease and I just got back from skiing
00:12 - ready to do some more tutorial stuff
00:15 - today we are taking a look at how to
00:17 - switch weapons in unity so we are going
00:20 - to be scripting bats so as always I have
00:24 - already opened up the unity and so I
00:29 - have opened up unity and first of all I
00:33 - just want to get rid of the ground plane
00:36 - object in our scene because that we
00:38 - won't need anymore now that we have such
00:41 - a fine terrain alright so basically what
00:47 - we're going to do and we are going to
00:50 - open up the player prefab and under the
00:54 - main camera will find our melee empty
00:57 - game object which is start currently
01:00 - starring our maze and our sort objects
01:03 - so basically you want to put both
01:06 - weapons in there the weapons that you're
01:08 - going to be switching between and the
01:12 - one that you want the character to start
01:14 - out with that one you're just going to
01:16 - leave enabled the other one you're just
01:18 - going to disable and make sure that they
01:20 - are correctly positioned and lined up
01:25 - with the cameras or anything looks good
01:27 - alright so I'll go ahead and disable the
01:31 - sword again so I want the character to
01:33 - start out out with having the mace
01:36 - equipped and for now maybe we'll take a
01:40 - look at how to make animations that
01:42 - switch between the two
01:44 - maybe not depends on how much time this
01:48 - is going to take but okay let's go ahead
01:51 - and create the script so you go ahead
01:53 - and select the melee empty game object
01:56 - you click Add component new script and
01:59 - of course you're going to program this
02:00 - in JavaScript and by the way a lot of
02:04 - people have asked me why we are starting
02:06 - out with the JavaScript well basically I
02:10 - think that JavaScript is a little easier
02:13 - learn in the future we might do some
02:16 - c-sharp programming in general c-sharp
02:20 - is a lot broader of a programming
02:23 - language but for beginners JavaScript
02:25 - can do exactly what you need so we'll
02:29 - just call this weapon switching you know
02:33 - what will D capitalize that so weapon
02:38 - switching create an ad and open it up in
02:43 - monodevelop perfect okay so we can go
02:51 - ahead and delete the function start we
02:54 - won't be needing that and let's start
02:57 - out by creating some variables okay so
03:00 - it has been some a little wider since we
03:04 - created our last script so might be a
03:07 - little rusty but as always we'll start
03:10 - with the variables and we'll call the
03:12 - first one bar and then weapon one so
03:18 - I'll capitalize that and Sue a one a
03:22 - colon and then it's going to be a type
03:25 - game object next one is we are going to
03:30 - do the exact same we call this just
03:33 - going to call this weapon two and again
03:35 - a type game object all right so this is
03:41 - the variables that are going to store
03:43 - our two weapons so in our function
03:46 - update we want to call the weapon
03:50 - switching when something happens more
03:53 - specifically we want to check if we get
03:57 - an input and you can make this whatever
04:00 - you want I'm just going to say if input
04:03 - dot get key down and then I'm going to
04:07 - do a key code so key code dot capital Q
04:13 - so we're going to switch weapons using
04:16 - the Q key then we want something to
04:21 - happen so we want to swap
04:25 - our weapons and you could exclude them
04:32 - but I'm just going to go ahead and make
04:34 - the brackets also after all that is our
04:39 - name so it should look like this and
04:46 - whenever you see a piece of code just do
04:49 - this so a name and then just the the the
04:54 - end the ending signs it means you're
04:58 - calling a function so parenthesis start
05:03 - and end and then a semicolon means
05:05 - function so we are going to go ahead and
05:09 - have to create the function so we'll
05:11 - make a new function call it swap weapons
05:15 - and it's a good idea to always create
05:19 - functions with capital letters all the
05:22 - way through so I'm swap weapons and the
05:28 - parentheses I'm going to leave them
05:30 - empty and then we're going to start the
05:34 - bracket and of course end it also ropes
05:41 - it up Tibor there you go
05:43 - and inside of here we're going to check
05:46 - if the weapon 1 dot active this equal to
06:01 - true and if that
06:06 - do this alright so on what we have here
06:11 - is we have a piece of code starring two
06:13 - game objects these two weapons we have a
06:17 - function update checking if the player
06:19 - presses the Q key code the Q key on this
06:23 - keyboard and if he does then just call
06:26 - this function swap weapons once this
06:29 - function will check if the weapon one is
06:32 - active so the first that weapon is
06:35 - currently equipped and if it is we're
06:40 - going to switch to the second weapon so
06:42 - the code is going to look like this
06:44 - weapon 1 dot set active recursively it's
06:54 - going to be false in parentheses
06:58 - semi-colon and weapon 2 dot set active
07:04 - recursively it's going to be true in
07:09 - parenthesis so let's simply make sure
07:14 - that if the weapon 1 is currently
07:18 - equipped then it will equip weapon 2
07:22 - instead and disable the weapon 1 now we
07:27 - want to make the opposite case so we go
07:31 - down until the closing bracket of the if
07:34 - statement and type else so else is
07:38 - called if if the if statement doesn't
07:41 - meet its requirements so if the weapon
07:44 - sir one isn't active then it's going to
07:49 - do whatever we put inside of the else
07:52 - statement so Elle's weapon 1 dot set
08:01 - active recursively it's going to be true
08:04 - and yes you guessed it weapon 2 that's
08:09 - set active recursively is this time
08:13 - going to be false
08:16 - and this way we can simply switch
08:20 - between our two weapons so let's go
08:23 - ahead and try it out open unity back up
08:29 - you can see that the two variables need
08:32 - to have something stored in them so we
08:36 - can drag our mace under the weapon one
08:38 - another sort under the weapon - I'll go
08:43 - ahead and maximize and hit play and when
08:47 - I click the cue it switches to my sword
08:50 - I'm going to click it again it switches
08:53 - back to my mace this way this is pretty
08:59 - much the simplest way to do weapon
09:01 - switching I guess if I have to do the
09:06 - animations also this would take too long
09:09 - so I'll go ahead and cut off the video
09:11 - right here but I heard I hope you learn
09:14 - something from it and I'll see you in
09:17 - the next video
