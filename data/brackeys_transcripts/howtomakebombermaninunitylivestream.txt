00:00 - hello everyone and welcome to this live
00:02 - stream tutorial in this video we are
00:04 - going to be creating a replica of
00:06 - bomberman inside of unity and it's going
00:09 - to look something like this once we're
00:12 - done so if I go ahead and hit play here
00:14 - we should be able to use our mouse and
00:17 - ignore this error it has something to do
00:19 - with the editor not the game I should be
00:21 - able to use on the mouse here to click
00:23 - and place bombs on different tiles and
00:26 - the bombs will then recognize where it's
00:28 - placed and create an explosion so that
00:30 - it doesn't overlap with the walls that
00:33 - it cannot destroy but it should also go
00:35 - ahead and dynamically destroy the
00:37 - elements that it can destroy so just
00:39 - like in the original Bomberman game and
00:42 - it should be really easy for you to go
00:44 - in and add a character controller here
00:46 - that goes around and places bombs
00:49 - instead of using the mouse because our
00:52 - entire environment is actually set up
00:54 - using the unity town map system so we
00:57 - are basically just modifying that at
00:59 - runtime and as you can see we do have a
01:02 - Collider in here so all of the wall
01:04 - elements and all of the destroyable
01:08 - elements here should have colliders and
01:11 - so right away if you go ahead and place
01:13 - a rigidbody in here in fact we can go
01:16 - ahead and try that but it's just try
01:17 - creating the rigidbody in here at
01:19 - runtime this is probably gonna go wrong
01:21 - but I'm just gonna do it anyway so I'm
01:23 - gonna create a 2d object sprite here and
01:26 - I'm just gonna select some kind of
01:27 - sprite let's just do a bomb whoops
01:32 - everything is not working there we go
01:34 - and we can move up the bomb here which I
01:36 - now called W let's just call it bomb and
01:39 - we place it at the top and we add a
01:43 - Collider to it so we're going to do a
01:46 - circle Collider we should actually be
01:49 - able to see this collide with our
01:51 - environment and this is not tested guys
01:54 - that I hope this will work but we're
01:55 - going to add a 2d rigidbody and there
01:57 - you go as you can see it kind of lands
01:59 - on the floor here and as you can see it
02:01 - kind of falls down and yeah so
02:03 - everything is set to work up with
02:04 - collide work with colliders and if we go
02:07 - ahead and say destroy part of the
02:08 - environment here you can see these
02:11 - colliders get removed okay that example
02:14 - it turned out way better than I thought
02:16 - it would so about that
02:18 - but yeah so let's don't dive right into
02:21 - the tutorial also towards the end we'll
02:23 - do a Q&A so make sure you to watch the
02:25 - video all the way through because we're
02:27 - going to be answering questions at the
02:29 - end like we always do so now we can go
02:33 - file open project because I've actually
02:35 - gone ahead and prepared kind of a
02:37 - starter project the reason why is I
02:39 - wanted to just include all the sprites
02:42 - I'm going to be using to have all the
02:45 - tiles set up appropriately also because
02:49 - I'm using rule tiles and I'm going to
02:51 - show you what this is in a second and
02:53 - I'm going to refer you to a video as
02:55 - well as a place where you can download
02:57 - this started project so don't worry you
02:59 - can learn all about it there's no black
03:01 - magic in this it's just for convenience
03:03 - I've gone ahead and created this project
03:05 - as you can see I already have mine
03:07 - sitting on my computer here but if you
03:10 - want to download it yourself I do have a
03:13 - link for that and for the people
03:15 - watching on YouTube there will of course
03:17 - be a link in the description and to the
03:20 - people watching on twitch I have a link
03:22 - that you can check out in the chat right
03:24 - there and I would ask the admins to go
03:28 - ahead and copy it and have it ready if
03:30 - people ask at a later point because I'm
03:32 - not going to be able to focus on pasting
03:34 - that in different places but yeah there
03:37 - is a link to the started project and
03:39 - this is what the started project looks
03:41 - like as you can see we just have a
03:44 - completely empty scene there's nothing
03:47 - in here other than a main camera but I
03:49 - also have a tile palette set up called
03:51 - Bomberman and if this window isn't open
03:54 - for you you can always go window and
03:55 - select tile palette and that should open
03:58 - it up and in here I've configured a few
04:01 - different tasks and you can see those
04:02 - under the tiles folder right here we
04:05 - have the wall tile that's that one right
04:07 - here just a static tile with a sink
04:11 - single sprite we have the destructible
04:14 - that's that one right here the same
04:16 - thing just a simple tile with a single
04:19 - sprite and then we have the dirt and
04:21 - wall filler and these are more
04:23 - complicated as you can see because these
04:25 - are what we call rule tars
04:27 - this allows these allow us to set up
04:30 - rules for how our tiles should look
04:32 - depending on how we paint with them
04:34 - depending on what tasks are nearby and
04:37 - this allows us to really easily paint
04:39 - good-looking environments where the
04:41 - tiles correspond to each other I've
04:44 - talked about how to set up tiles and how
04:46 - you can get rule tiles because it's not
04:49 - um included with unity by default and
04:52 - all that stuff and how to use tile Maps
04:54 - in general in a video I just created
04:56 - called tile Maps and unity so if you
04:59 - want to learn more about how to paint
05:01 - with tile maps and set all that stuff up
05:03 - I would definitely recommend you check
05:05 - out that video of course also have a
05:08 - link to that in the description so with
05:11 - that we can actually go out and create a
05:13 - tile map now so in order to create a
05:15 - tile map we go to the hierarchy we
05:17 - right-click we go to the object and we
05:19 - select tile map and this creates a grid
05:22 - where we can configure the size of the
05:23 - grid as well as a tile map object and as
05:27 - I've explained in the video I did a tile
05:30 - map is basically like a layer in
05:32 - Photoshop so we can go ahead and paint
05:35 - stuff onto a tile map and we can create
05:37 - multiple tile maps and layer them on top
05:39 - of each other if we want to have depth
05:43 - sort of say in our tabs so this tile map
05:47 - we can actually go ahead and paint on
05:49 - two right away we do that by selecting
05:51 - the brush tool here and hitting B we
05:53 - want to select the appropriate palettes
05:55 - here I only have one called the
05:56 - Bomberman which is included in the
05:58 - project and I'm gonna go ahead and
06:00 - select say the dirt here to the left now
06:04 - as you can see this is a rule tile and
06:07 - this means that if I go ahead and paint
06:09 - with it you can see that it
06:10 - automatically chooses a sprite that is
06:13 - appropriate for the position or for the
06:17 - on tile depending on the nearby tiles so
06:21 - that's pretty cool instead of us having
06:23 - to go in and select a corner like this
06:25 - I'd select a filler and all that stuff
06:28 - that you would normally do in order to
06:29 - create kind of corresponding tasks so
06:33 - we'll go ahead and use this to sketch
06:35 - out our level and I'm gonna make this
06:37 - fairly wide here something along these
06:39 - lines and I'm actually just going
06:41 - to make it completely square is this
06:45 - completely square this is not completely
06:47 - square this is completely square I
06:49 - believe there we go
06:51 - I'm going to hit G in order to fill out
06:53 - the entire thing there we go and and
06:57 - click with my mouse and then switch back
06:59 - to be in order to change back to brush
07:02 - mode I'm just going to make sure that
07:04 - the size of this is correct so if we
07:06 - imagine that we have walls all the way
07:09 - round here and we then go ahead and
07:11 - place one two three four wall pieces and
07:15 - then we have another wall so this is the
07:17 - correct size of the level that I want to
07:19 - make then we can select the wall filler
07:21 - this one here and I'm just gonna fill
07:24 - out with this all the way round here I'm
07:28 - actually going to do ain't no other
07:30 - patch add that just so that it isn't
07:34 - completely empty around our level so if
07:36 - we go ahead and look in the game view
07:37 - whoa for some reason our main camera is
07:41 - a bit zoomed in here and it isn't really
07:44 - positioned in a way that I'd like so I'm
07:47 - just going to take the main camera I'm
07:48 - going to move it over here by 0.5 on the
07:54 - X in order to be exact I'm also just
07:56 - going to change the size of the camera
07:58 - here in order to kind of zoom it out and
08:01 - we can also move it down by 0.5 or
08:03 - negative point 5 on the Y here just to
08:08 - Center it on our level and that actually
08:11 - looks pretty decent I'm actually going
08:13 - to zoom it in a bit more something
08:16 - around there um we can definitely go in
08:19 - here and add more wall filler in order
08:22 - to make sure that no matter what screen
08:26 - size we use that we are going to fill
08:31 - everything out with sprites so that it
08:34 - doesn't look weird angle Ichi there we
08:36 - go so now we should see that our level
08:39 - looks just fine and this is kind of the
08:41 - background of a level this is kind of
08:43 - what we want everything else to be
08:45 - painting painted on top of so we can go
08:48 - ahead and select our tile map and rename
08:50 - it to tile map underscore and I'm gonna
08:52 - call this background
08:55 - and because this is a background we are
08:57 - going to set the ordering layer for our
08:59 - talib render 2-1 so now it's going to be
09:02 - drawn underneath everything else now we
09:05 - can right click on a grid sirico 2d
09:08 - object and select tile map again and
09:10 - we've now created another layer and this
09:13 - one is going to be time app underscore
09:15 - gameplay this is where all avoid
09:17 - gameplay tiles the ones that actually
09:19 - affect our players are going to be and
09:22 - this is of course the destructible
09:24 - environment and the walls so let's start
09:27 - by painting some walls here I'm still I
09:30 - still have the brush selected but do
09:32 - note that you don't need to select the
09:34 - time app in the hierarchy instead you
09:36 - need to go under active tile map and
09:39 - choose the one that you want to paint to
09:40 - so I'm gonna change this to tile map
09:42 - game play select the wall and now I
09:46 - should be able to paint with the wall so
09:48 - I'm gonna go ahead and paint some walls
09:51 - whoops and if you missed and miss click
09:54 - or something you can always hold down
09:56 - shift in order to remove there we go and
09:59 - I'm gonna place in all of the walls
10:03 - inside of our level square here and
10:06 - there we go this now looks like a
10:08 - completely typical Bomberman level cool
10:12 - so now we've actually kind of created
10:15 - the whole base for our game this is how
10:19 - incredibly simple it can be to create
10:21 - levels using this tile map system the
10:25 - next thing that we want to do is make
10:26 - sure that all of our levels are sort or
10:28 - all of the elements in our level are
10:31 - sort of interactable in other words we
10:33 - want to add colliders to each of these
10:36 - wall pieces so that if we go ahead and
10:39 - create say a player character he will be
10:42 - able to collide with them so let's go
10:45 - ahead and hit add component and in here
10:48 - we're going to create a tile map
10:49 - Collider 2d and as you can see this goes
10:53 - ahead and actually creates you can see
10:55 - it out or outlines each one of these
10:59 - elements with a green line and this is
11:01 - of course a Collider you can also see it
11:04 - creates lines between each one of these
11:07 - elements and that's because it's
11:09 - creating a box Collider for each element
11:12 - which is not very performant so instead
11:15 - what we want to do is actually go in
11:18 - here and add another component that will
11:21 - automatically combine all these
11:24 - colliders in an effective way and this
11:27 - is what we call a I've actually forgot
11:30 - forgotten what it's called here let's go
11:33 - into physics 2d and it select the scene
11:38 - here composite Collider yes so the
11:40 - composite Collider 2d and this
11:43 - automatically creates a rigidbody and
11:45 - this doesn't mean that we need our tile
11:47 - map in to move in any way we can simply
11:49 - set the body type to static and now it
11:51 - really is as F or is as if the rigid
11:57 - body wasn't there it's not going to
11:59 - apply any forces or anything it knows
12:01 - this object is not going to move and
12:03 - then we can go to the Tom F Collider and
12:05 - we can hit used by composite and right
12:08 - away you can see all the green lines
12:11 - between the different parts disappear
12:13 - and we now have one uniform line going
12:16 - all the way around for the wall tiles
12:20 - that are next to each other and this is
12:22 - actually happening at runtime so if at
12:25 - runtime we were to change our tile map
12:27 - our composite Collider will change the
12:30 - way that it generates really cool and
12:33 - this also means that we can go ahead and
12:35 - now paint more elements so if we want to
12:37 - paint with the destructive tile here we
12:40 - can actually just go in here and as you
12:41 - can see right away the collider update
12:44 - so I'm just gonna paint a bunch of
12:47 - destructible elements in here so that we
12:51 - can see it working later and it will
12:53 - look really cool and I'm just gonna
12:55 - scatter these throughout this is not
12:58 - really about creating an interesting
12:59 - level as much as it is a demo but there
13:03 - we go we now have some elements in here
13:05 - and as you can see the collider again
13:08 - has updated for all of these one thing
13:11 - that you do need to know about when
13:13 - creating our Collider is for your tile
13:15 - map is that you need to set up what sort
13:18 - of Collider you want each town to have
13:21 - so if we go to our say
13:23 - wall here we can actually change the
13:25 - collider type of our wall and as you can
13:28 - see I've set mine to grid if you select
13:31 - none
13:31 - no colliders are going to be generated
13:34 - for this element and as you can see if I
13:36 - select it now all of the wall elements
13:38 - are ignored by our Collider this is
13:40 - definitely not what we want
13:41 - if you select sprite it's going to
13:44 - generate a Collider based on the sprite
13:46 - so for example for this destroyed wall
13:50 - part here or this destructible part it's
13:52 - actually going to generate a Collider
13:54 - that goes around all the details of the
13:56 - sprite we don't want that we simply want
13:59 - a square Collider and so we choose grid
14:02 - this simply creates a Collider that is
14:05 - completely Square and it's the same size
14:07 - as the grid element and this is what I
14:09 - want for both the wall and the
14:10 - destructible and then for the dirt and
14:13 - the wall filler not that we have are
14:16 - applying any colliders on these elements
14:18 - because they are on the background but I
14:20 - do definitely want to go ahead and
14:22 - simply set those to none I don't want
14:24 - any collision on these elements
14:26 - whatsoever so that's how you can
14:29 - configure it for individual tiles so now
14:32 - that we have set up our environment in
14:34 - the way that we want it's time to start
14:37 - actually doing things through script and
14:40 - the first thing that we want to do is
14:42 - being able to spawn in bombs
14:45 - so let's actually create a bomb to do
14:48 - that we'll go under the sprites here and
14:50 - let's take the bomb that is included in
14:54 - the project and let's drag it right into
14:56 - our scene ash oops something weird
15:02 - happened there created a material game a
15:06 - bit kind of disappeared did it make a
15:10 - tile out of it that was weird
15:13 - I have no idea what just happened
15:19 - do any of you guys it seems that the
15:21 - tile map renderer for some reason took
15:23 - on the material created for the bomb
15:26 - here okay so we are probably just gonna
15:29 - go ahead answer the experts default for
15:31 - that one and everything is back to
15:32 - normal that was very weird I have no
15:35 - idea what happened but instead
15:37 - of dragging it in here we can probably
15:39 - just drag it into the heart yes okay so
15:42 - now I created our bomb and we can see it
15:45 - in our game we also want to make sure
15:46 - that our bomb is always overlaid on top
15:48 - of our gameplay layers so let's go ahead
15:51 - and set the order in layer two one here
15:53 - then we can actually move our element
15:55 - here whoops I'm going to switch into 2d
15:58 - mode here and just that's place it at
16:01 - the center of our scene here this is
16:02 - kind of how it's going to look like or
16:04 - go to look it's this is kind of how it's
16:07 - going to look like when we create a bomb
16:09 - and the main thing that we want to
16:12 - happen for this bomb is that after a
16:15 - little while we of course want it to
16:17 - explode so we're going to have some kind
16:19 - of explosion component on our bomb
16:22 - but let's create that later for now
16:23 - let's just take this bomb and turn it
16:25 - into a prefab so let's create a folder
16:27 - inside of our project for prefabs and
16:29 - let's drag it right in there
16:33 - there we go so now we can remove it from
16:36 - our scene and we can go ahead and create
16:39 - a bomb spawner so let's right-click in
16:42 - our hierarchy create an empty object and
16:44 - this is where we'll put a bomb spawner
16:46 - let's reset the transform and call it
16:48 - bomb spawner and then we can add
16:51 - component and we're going to create a
16:53 - bomb spawner script of type C sharp and
16:56 - let's say create an ADD and now we can
16:58 - double click this to open it up in
16:59 - Visual Studio and while it's waiting or
17:04 - booting up here I'm just gonna have a
17:06 - look at the chat to see if everything is
17:08 - working looks like it that's awesome and
17:13 - yeah let's just go ahead and continue
17:15 - with the video that so the first thing
17:17 - that we want is because we are going to
17:20 - be working with Tom Maps we're going to
17:22 - be using unity engine dot tar maps you
17:27 - always always want to do this when you
17:30 - want to use tar or work with tar maps in
17:33 - scripting in unity we can however delete
17:36 - the two top namespaces there we're not
17:39 - going to be using those we can also
17:41 - remove the start function we won't be
17:43 - using that either but what we want is a
17:46 - reference to our tile map game play
17:49 - layer the reason why is that
17:51 - we go ahead and create a bomb let's say
17:55 - that we go ahead and unit is lagging out
17:59 - here so let's say that we go ahead and
18:01 - click and want to place a bomb right in
18:03 - the middle here on this tab we don't
18:06 - want the bomb to actually appear right
18:07 - where our mouse clicked that way if we
18:10 - click that in the corner here it would
18:11 - actually overlay some of the other tiles
18:13 - no we want we want it to snap to the
18:16 - center of the town that we clicked on so
18:18 - even though we click in the corner of
18:20 - the tile it should snap right to the
18:21 - center to do this we of course need a
18:24 - reference to a tile map in order to
18:25 - determine where the center of the given
18:27 - tile is so let's create a public tile
18:30 - map and this is going to be our tile map
18:34 - we can just call it bad we're also going
18:37 - to want a public game object which is
18:40 - going to be of course a reference to our
18:42 - bomb prefab what we want to actually
18:45 - spawn then inside of our update mode
18:47 - let's check if we get a mouse button
18:50 - down so if we get a mouse button press
18:52 - to do that we use input dot get mouse
18:56 - button down and the mouse button that we
18:59 - want to check for is just the left mouse
19:01 - button which is index of zero so if we
19:05 - press our left mouse button well um
19:07 - actually I just need to rearrange
19:08 - something on my other screen here one
19:10 - second okay cool so um if we press our
19:14 - mouse button we want to go ahead and
19:16 - first of all get the position that we
19:19 - pressed so we can use camera dot Maine
19:23 - dot screen to world point in order to
19:28 - convert input dot mouse position into
19:32 - world coordinates so input that Mouse
19:33 - position gives us the position of our
19:35 - mouse in screen coordinates which is the
19:38 - amount of pixels on the X and the y from
19:42 - the I think it's upper right upper left
19:45 - corner but it could be lower left corner
19:46 - but I'm pretty sure its upper left
19:48 - corner and we convert that into a well
19:51 - position by using this function then we
19:54 - can store this position as a vector
19:56 - three so we'll create a vector three
19:57 - call it world position and set it equal
20:00 - to that then we want to go ahead and
20:03 - take this world position and couldn't
20:05 - into a cell in other words what tile and
20:09 - we referred to a tile on a grid as a
20:12 - cell
20:13 - so what cell did we press well to do
20:17 - that we used another handy function
20:19 - called tile map dot world to sell this
20:23 - takes just in our ordinary world
20:25 - position and converts it to a cell
20:28 - position and a cell position is actually
20:31 - also stored oops my phone going off now
20:33 - a cell physician is actually also stored
20:36 - as a vector3 but not a normal vector
20:40 - three so we can go ahead and write back
20:42 - the three here and call it sale and set
20:44 - it equal to our map dot world to sell
20:48 - but the cell here is can actually okay
20:53 - can be stored in a vector three but what
20:55 - we normally use here is a vector three
20:57 - int and the reason why is that cells or
21:01 - cell numbers are always referred to in
21:04 - whole numbers in integers we cannot have
21:07 - a half cell so this using this data type
21:12 - here is simply faster it's simply easier
21:14 - to store because we don't need to store
21:17 - decimal places for each of the three
21:19 - numbers they all integers that's the
21:21 - only difference here and finally we need
21:24 - to get the center position of the cell
21:26 - so now we've determined on our grid here
21:28 - on our grid that we have which cell on
21:34 - this grid did we press and now we need
21:36 - to find say we press the center here now
21:39 - we need to find the center position of
21:41 - this cell and to do that we simply need
21:44 - to go tile map dot get cell center world
21:48 - and here we input again a position of
21:51 - the cell so this cell here and this is
21:54 - going to again be a vector3 and for this
21:57 - we of course want to have decimal places
21:59 - so it's going to be a normal vector
22:00 - three and we'll call this the cell
22:02 - center position all right so now we've
22:07 - chewed through kind of all the
22:08 - calculations that we need to do first
22:10 - converting from our screen space which
22:14 - is where our mouse position is to a
22:16 - world position that's what we do here
22:19 - then converting from a well position to
22:21 - a cell defining the right cell then
22:24 - converting from the cell to the center
22:27 - well position of that cell and finally
22:29 - we can go ahead and instantiate our bond
22:31 - so we can instantiate a bond prefab add
22:34 - these cells Center position with no
22:37 - rotation so catonian dot identity and if
22:40 - we now say this and go into unity and
22:43 - hit play we should see that we have no
22:48 - errors fingers crossed
22:50 - okay so I clicked play twice so it
22:53 - actually unplayed but now if I click OK
22:57 - I know that we're gonna get an error now
22:59 - because we didn't actually refer it to
23:01 - the bomb prefab so there we go but it is
23:04 - working I promise you so we can go back
23:07 - into a bond spawner we need to reference
23:09 - first of all our tile map which is going
23:11 - to be Tama up gameplay and then under
23:14 - prefabs we're going to reference or bomb
23:16 - prefab there we go and if we now it play
23:19 - I am try and place a bomb yes so you can
23:24 - see no matter where I press on some of
23:26 - these tiles a bomb is actually going to
23:28 - be pressed of course it doesn't explode
23:29 - yet but that is kind of an introduction
23:32 - to working with some of these positions
23:33 - when it comes to toss how do you place
23:37 - game objects on tiles how do you kind of
23:39 - refactor some of these positional data
23:42 - so yeah that I think that was a pretty
23:44 - important thing to learn when working
23:47 - with on tile Maps you will also note
23:49 - that we can place bombs on pretty much
23:51 - all tiles in our entire tile map so
23:54 - we're not really doing any checking to
23:56 - see if the place is bomb compatible and
23:59 - you could definitely do that but I don't
24:02 - think it's important here because the
24:03 - only thing that's going to be placing
24:05 - bombs is your character and he's never
24:07 - going to be able to move to these
24:09 - locations so yeah you might do that if
24:12 - you want to go all in but I don't think
24:15 - it's necessarily something you need to
24:18 - do cool so now that we are placing bombs
24:22 - in the right positions it's time to go
24:23 - ahead and make these bombs explode and
24:26 - of course in order to make them explode
24:29 - we need to have some kind of a countdown
24:30 - timer but right before we create that
24:32 - I'm just going
24:33 - have a look in the chat here and see if
24:35 - I'm still streaming or if I'm just
24:36 - talking to myself okay so things things
24:40 - are going good
24:41 - awesome the next thing that we will do
24:45 - is create a bomb script so we'll go to
24:47 - our prefabs bomb and we'll create
24:50 - another component here and this is going
24:52 - to be the bomb script oops
24:56 - bomb and will it create an ad and we'll
24:59 - double click it to open it up in Visual
25:01 - Studio and this is definitely going to
25:03 - be this simplest script that we'll be
25:05 - riding today the only thing that we want
25:07 - to do is replace the start method with
25:10 - some kind of public float which we'll
25:13 - call our countdown and will default this
25:16 - to say two seconds then inside our
25:18 - update method so every frame we want to
25:21 - go ahead and reduce our countdown by
25:23 - time.deltatime in other words each
25:27 - second we're going to reduce a countdown
25:29 - variable by one and so this is going to
25:32 - count down for two seconds and we can go
25:35 - ahead and check if countdown gues
25:38 - reaches zero or goes below zero well
25:42 - then we actually want to go ahead and
25:44 - explode but before we do that we
25:48 - actually need some way of having the
25:51 - bomb explode so right now let's just
25:53 - write a debugger lock saying boom as
25:58 - well as a destroy call oops
26:02 - I did not improve the correct symbol
26:05 - there as well as a destroy hold that is
26:08 - going to remove this game object so
26:10 - right after we say boom in the console
26:13 - we're going to destroy the bomb game
26:15 - object and it's going to be no more cool
26:18 - so let's say that and let's make sure
26:20 - that it's applied to a prefab and
26:22 - everything and that we get no errors yes
26:28 - and then we can hit play and now we
26:31 - should be able to see that if I click
26:34 - wait two seconds it says boom and the
26:37 - bomb is gone perfect so now we have the
26:41 - kind of timing of the bombs are
26:43 - perfected and the only thing
26:45 - left really now is creating the actual
26:48 - map destroy a script and I'm just gonna
26:52 - go ahead and place this on the grid but
26:54 - you can really place it anywhere that
26:56 - you'd like let's call it map destroyer
26:59 - destroy your and let's say create an ad
27:03 - and it's double-click it to open it up
27:05 - and this is going to be a bit longer
27:08 - this script but it's not necessarily
27:10 - going to be more complicated than what
27:12 - we've already done so the first thing
27:16 - that we want to do is get rid of both of
27:18 - functions we're not going to be using
27:19 - any of the default unity functions we'll
27:22 - also go ahead and use unity engine you
27:26 - guessed it dart tar maps and finally
27:31 - we're going to get a reference a public
27:33 - tile map to a tunnel and we can just go
27:38 - ahead and call that town map as well
27:40 - because we are going to be modifying our
27:42 - gameplay tile map so we need a reference
27:44 - to our gameplay tile map and now we need
27:48 - a couple of functions let's create a
27:51 - public void which we'll call explode and
27:55 - this is going to take in a vector two
27:58 - with the position where we want to
28:02 - explode and this is going to be a
28:05 - position in world coordinates so we
28:08 - could also just call this world pause
28:10 - just to be a tiny more tiny bit more
28:14 - specific that's probably a good idea and
28:16 - the first thing that we want to go and
28:18 - do is convert this world position that
28:21 - gets inputted into this function into a
28:25 - cell the cell of the origin of the
28:28 - explosion so we'll create so we'll use
28:31 - tile map dot world to sell in order to
28:34 - find the right cell will input the world
28:37 - position that was passed in and we'll go
28:40 - ahead and store this as again a vector3
28:42 - int called the origin cell which just
28:47 - looks or sounds so incredibly cold
28:51 - origins cell it sounds like something
28:53 - taken right out of the matrix we've
28:55 - achieved the origin cell and we're ready
28:57 - to proceed all right
28:59 - okay that's probably the most nerdiest
29:01 - thing I've said today but it will
29:02 - continue so with this origin cell we
29:05 - need to go ahead and of course explode
29:07 - the cell that the bomb is on but we also
29:10 - want to explode the I'm gonna go ahead
29:13 - and show you this we of course going to
29:16 - explode the cell that the bomb gets
29:18 - placed on but we also want to explode
29:20 - the two cells above this bomb the two
29:23 - cells to the right of this bomb two to
29:26 - the two down and two to the left so
29:30 - let's create a function for exploding a
29:33 - particular cell and then simply call
29:35 - that function with a tiny bit of offset
29:38 - from the origin cell so one one offset
29:41 - on the X to offset on the x one offset
29:43 - on the y to offset on the Y and so on so
29:45 - let's go ahead and create a public
29:47 - another function in here this doesn't
29:49 - need to be public we can just call it
29:51 - make it of a void private void
29:55 - call it explode cell and this is of
29:59 - course going to take in the cell that we
30:01 - want to explore it so a vector3 int
30:03 - called sale and here we go ahead and
30:10 - explode your appropriate cell and the
30:13 - way that we want to do this is first to
30:15 - convert this position or this cell
30:18 - number into an actual top so we need to
30:23 - figure out the data of the cell that
30:26 - this that we're trying to explode so to
30:31 - 'try to achieve the town with a certain
30:34 - cell index what we do is use tom ab get
30:38 - tau and here we feed it simply the cell
30:43 - so simply the position of the top we
30:46 - also need to make sure to convert this
30:48 - because by default this is going to give
30:51 - us what is called a table base so this
30:54 - is going to give us a tall base and a
30:57 - table base is basically just the class
31:00 - that all tile types derive from so by
31:04 - default right now unity just comes with
31:06 - a single tile that derived from tower
31:09 - base and that's just called tau it's the
31:12 - basic table it has the
31:13 - stride a collider that's pretty much it
31:16 - and you can place it in your tile map
31:17 - but I think with time unity is going to
31:19 - be adding multiple kinds of tasks such
31:22 - as ruler tiles which I've included in
31:25 - this project here and you can get from
31:27 - from a github repository that unity has
31:30 - made animated tasks terrain tiles all
31:34 - that kind of stuff as well as you can
31:37 - also create your own tiles that derive
31:39 - from tile base so that's all good but
31:43 - Todd base doesn't actually give us a lot
31:47 - of information about the tile in fact
31:49 - the only thing that it gives us is kind
31:50 - of just a name and the ability to get
31:53 - some more data but that's all very
31:54 - complicated instead what we want to do
31:57 - is actually retrieve the top so we want
32:00 - to be more specific and say hey we just
32:02 - we don't just want to get any tile
32:04 - deriving from tile base we want to only
32:07 - get a top as in the tile that we've gone
32:11 - ahead and created here the destructible
32:12 - and wall this is not gonna work for rule
32:15 - tile because rule tiles are also derived
32:17 - from tile base but their rule tiles not
32:20 - just tasks I know this is very confusing
32:22 - but we want to get the destructible and
32:25 - wall tiles and so we want to be specific
32:28 - that we want to get a tower and so we
32:30 - can actually specify that right here we
32:32 - want to get a tile of the type tile and
32:36 - if you wanted to get a rule tile you can
32:37 - get a ton of the tithe rule tile so this
32:42 - is where you specify what you want to
32:43 - get so we want to get a towel
32:45 - and we'll call it tile and it's going to
32:47 - be of type tile tile tile tile so now
32:55 - that we've gotten the towel at the right
32:57 - position what we want to do is do some
33:01 - checking on this we want to check is
33:03 - this a wall tile in which case we want
33:05 - to stop the explosion right there is
33:07 - this a destructible tile in which case
33:10 - we want to go ahead and well destroy it
33:12 - and we can even check if the towel
33:15 - simply doesn't exist so in order to do
33:19 - that what we want to do is simply go up
33:22 - here and create a few references we want
33:25 - to create a reference to the
33:28 - destructible tile as well as the wall
33:31 - tile so that we can compare the tile
33:33 - that we want to explode to those two and
33:35 - check if they're the same so here we can
33:37 - create a public towel and we'll call
33:40 - this all tile as well as a public tile
33:44 - that will call destructible tile and
33:48 - then down here we can simply check if
33:50 - the town that we're looking at so if
33:52 - tile is equal to wall tile well then we
33:57 - don't want to do anything because we
33:58 - cannot destroy walls so we simply going
34:01 - to return out of the function we also
34:03 - check if the tile is equal to a
34:05 - destructible tile in which case we are
34:09 - going to go ahead and actually change
34:11 - the tile to remove or in actually we're
34:15 - not just going to change it we're going
34:17 - to remove the top I'm going to show you
34:19 - how to do that in a second
34:21 - then finally if it's not a wall tile but
34:25 - if it's a destructible tile or there is
34:27 - no tile well then we want to go ahead
34:29 - and create an explosion on the top and
34:34 - then we can simply empty function so
34:38 - this is how we would kind of construct
34:40 - it this is how we can get a towel and
34:42 - find out what tile we're working with
34:44 - and in the case that we want to destroy
34:47 - the tile what we do is using tile map
34:52 - dot set tile and this is pretty much the
34:56 - equivalent of the function up here here
34:58 - we get a towel at the certain position
35:00 - here we set a towel at a certain
35:02 - position at first we give it the
35:03 - position so cell and then we give it the
35:07 - new tile that we wanted to be so here we
35:09 - could set it to a wall tile if we wanted
35:11 - to we could set it to a destructible
35:13 - tile any other tile if you reference it
35:15 - or we could simply set it to null in
35:18 - order to remove it and that's what we
35:20 - want to do here so if we say this we
35:25 - should actually be able to call this
35:27 - function and let's actually just try and
35:29 - do that so for now we can maybe just
35:32 - call it on the origin cell so up here we
35:34 - can say explode cell and we just want to
35:37 - explode our origin cell if we now save
35:40 - this and
35:41 - and we select our grid and under our map
35:46 - destroyer we should get to three fields
35:48 - here the first one is we need to
35:50 - reference our town map gameplay the
35:52 - second is we want a reference to a wall
35:54 - tile as well as the destructible tile
35:56 - and if we now play we should see that if
36:01 - I place a palm here right on top of some
36:06 - dirt it should remove that dirt don't
36:10 - know why it didn't remove that dirt oh
36:11 - because we also need to of course call
36:13 - this function I'm being stupid so we
36:16 - actually also need to go into our bomb
36:18 - and instead of just debug dead logging
36:21 - boom we need to call this explode
36:24 - function and for now we can just use
36:27 - find object of type map destroyer in
36:31 - order to get a reference to this script
36:34 - and then simply use dot explode and then
36:38 - we'll give it our current position so
36:40 - transform dot position of course I would
36:44 - recommend you to use a singleton here
36:46 - instead I've shown you how to create
36:48 - very simple singleton patterns before if
36:50 - you want to know more about what
36:51 - Singleton's are I love also have a link
36:54 - for that in the description if you're
36:55 - watching on YouTube but it's basically
36:57 - just a more efficient way of getting a
36:59 - reference to a script that is only that
37:02 - only exists once inside the scene and
37:05 - it's a very complicated sentence but
37:07 - basically it just is more performant
37:09 - than this line of code right here so I
37:13 - would recommend you add that but this is
37:15 - not what the video is about so we're
37:17 - just going to do it this way and find
37:18 - the object each time so now we called
37:21 - explode on the map destroyer every time
37:24 - our bomb is ready to explode if we save
37:28 - that and hit play we should now be able
37:32 - to do this thing that I was trying to do
37:33 - before which is place a bomb on top of
37:36 - some destructible piece of environment
37:38 - and it should remove it if we pray place
37:41 - it on some dirt nothing happens and if
37:44 - we place it on a wall nothing happens so
37:47 - it only destroys destructible tiles
37:49 - that's because inside of our function in
37:52 - the map Destroyer it checks if the tile
37:54 - is
37:55 - distractible town and if it is it
37:57 - removes it so it says something about
38:00 - this working let's also go ahead and
38:02 - create an explosion each time just to
38:04 - make this more visible and it I think
38:06 - it's going to help us when we try and
38:08 - explode more cells so to create an
38:11 - explosion we really just need a
38:13 - reference to a prefab that we can spawn
38:16 - in and we can go ahead and create that
38:18 - here so we'll create a public game
38:19 - object and we'll call it explosion
38:22 - prefab and then down here when we want
38:26 - to create the explosion we first want to
38:29 - change the cell here to a world position
38:33 - so we can use Tom app dot cell to world
38:38 - and we'll give it our cell here and then
38:42 - we can we actually also need to offset
38:45 - this a little bit and before we use this
38:49 - let me find it here this gets tells
38:52 - Center world and I think we need to use
38:54 - that also here actually instead so let's
38:56 - use dot get cell Center world yes yes
39:04 - this is what we need to use and here we
39:06 - simply input this cell cool that's the
39:10 - right function because this will get the
39:12 - center of the cell and this is where we
39:14 - want to instantiate our explosion so
39:16 - this is going to be a victor three that
39:18 - will called
39:19 - position what's that equal to the result
39:22 - there and then we can instantiate an
39:24 - explosion prefab add the position with
39:27 - no rotation so quaternion identity let's
39:31 - save that go into unity select our grid
39:35 - wait for it to refresh here there we go
39:40 - now we can drag in a prefab but of
39:43 - course we need to create this explosion
39:45 - prefab and I've gone ahead and imported
39:47 - some sprites for the explosion here as
39:50 - well by the way all these sprites here
39:52 - the dirt explosion and mold are also
39:55 - included in some of the unity example
39:57 - scene so they are created by unity so in
40:01 - here we can go to the sprite editor and
40:03 - as you can see it's automatically laid
40:06 - out all the individuals rights
40:08 - for this explosion so whoops and if we
40:13 - close this right editor we can see each
40:15 - of them here and in order to make an
40:18 - animation out of these we simply need to
40:20 - select all them by holding down shift
40:22 - and drag them into our hierarchy and
40:25 - this is going to prompt us to create an
40:27 - animation let's create a new folder for
40:29 - this which we'll call animation and
40:32 - let's call it the explosion animation
40:36 - let's save and now it creates this
40:40 - explosion on this course zero object
40:42 - we're simply going to rename this to
40:44 - explosion there we go and if we go into
40:49 - the animation window we can go window
40:51 - and image animation there we go we can
40:57 - now scrub through and see the animation
41:00 - asset place and we can just hit play
41:02 - here if you want to preview it in real
41:04 - time so now we have an animation I just
41:07 - want to make sure that at the end here
41:09 - we add a final key frame that gets rid
41:11 - of the smoke so that when it plays all
41:13 - the way through it disappears so I'm
41:15 - just gonna hit record here go place it
41:19 - right at the end of our animation and go
41:22 - ahead and set the sprite to none and so
41:25 - now it should insert so that if we play
41:27 - through the animation and it ends here
41:29 - there we go it's gone and finally we can
41:32 - go under the animation here and select
41:34 - the clip explosion on our arm there we
41:38 - go explosion and we want to disable loop
41:40 - time so now our animation won't loop it
41:43 - will just play once and then it won't be
41:46 - visible anymore so now we have our
41:48 - explosion and we can actually go out and
41:51 - make a prefab out of this as well and we
41:54 - can remove it from our scene and now if
41:57 - we go under our grid and drag in our
42:00 - explosion prefab that we just created
42:02 - hit play and place it place a bomb
42:08 - somewhere in our scene we should see
42:09 - there we go
42:10 - we now have an explosion effect and of
42:13 - course it's currently only right on top
42:15 - of the bomb but we can simply go ahead
42:17 - and call the same explode so function
42:21 - just like we do
42:22 - and then simply offset it to the up to
42:26 - the right to the left and down in order
42:28 - to create more explosions of the same
42:29 - kind and we can do this really easily
42:32 - but first I just want to have a look at
42:35 - the chat here to see how everyone is
42:38 - doing looks good I hope I hope you guys
42:41 - are able to to follow along I know this
42:44 - down video is kind of all over the place
42:46 - right now but the Talmud system is all
42:48 - new and interesting and I thought I
42:50 - would cover it as much as possible
42:54 - really don't mind it if if you aren't
42:59 - able to follow along with with
43:00 - everything you'll learn with time this
43:02 - is really just an introduction but yeah
43:05 - it looks like everything is good in the
43:07 - chat so we can go ahead and continue and
43:10 - so I wanted to go ahead and call the
43:13 - explode cell here and then simply offset
43:15 - it to go up and to the right and down
43:17 - and to the left and to do this we can
43:19 - simply copy this experts a call and then
43:23 - simply add a tiny
43:26 - offset on to our origin cell position so
43:30 - we'll do plus new vector3 int and here
43:35 - we can then offset it on the x y&z so
43:39 - and of course first we want to go ahead
43:42 - and offset it by 1 on the X 0 on the Y
43:46 - and 0 on the Z and we can go ahead and
43:49 - copy this a bunch of times so then we
43:53 - want to go to on the X then we want to
43:58 - go 0 on the X and 1 on the y then we
44:02 - want to go 0 on the X and 2 on the Y and
44:07 - you're kind of getting the system here
44:09 - however we don't want to offset it on
44:11 - the Z because we're not really working
44:13 - with depth in that way instead what we
44:15 - want to do is offset it by negative 1
44:17 - and negative 2 on the X and then do the
44:21 - same thing on the Y here so negative 1
44:25 - on the Y and negative 2 on the Y in
44:28 - other words plus 1 plus 1 on the Y plus
44:33 - 1 plus 2 on the X negative 1
44:36 - negative 2 on the Y negative 2 1
44:39 - negative 2 on the X so that's how we are
44:41 - getting this pattern and we should now
44:44 - see actually that if we just say this
44:47 - and go in and play and place a bomb it
44:50 - should work right off the bat so if we
44:52 - place a bomb here now we get this lovely
44:55 - explosion effect it removes the part of
44:57 - the environment that we want whoops I
45:00 - shouldn't place it on top of that but
45:01 - you can see it working the only problem
45:03 - with this is that if we place it
45:05 - somewhere where it should actually be
45:07 - blocked by a wall say here you can see
45:11 - that the explosion doesn't actually
45:13 - trigger on the wall but it goes through
45:16 - to the other side and this is of course
45:20 - not something we want you want walls to
45:22 - be able to accept like an explosion so
45:26 - how do we do that well we can actually
45:28 - do it fairly simply we can do it by
45:31 - using a return type to this function in
45:34 - other words instead of returning nothing
45:36 - we'll go ahead and return a ball and
45:39 - this pool is going to indicate it's
45:43 - going to indicate whether or not on the
45:46 - explosion was blocked by a wall so in
45:50 - the case that we hit a wall tile we're
45:53 - going to return false because the
45:56 - explosion didn't happen here and so we
45:58 - don't want it to continue in the case
46:01 - that we didn't in other words we reach
46:03 - this point in the code we're going to
46:05 - return true because the explosion did
46:08 - happen and we didn't hit a wall and so
46:10 - we want the explosion to continue so
46:12 - this pool here is just do we want to
46:15 - continue our explosion in the given
46:17 - direction and we can then use that up
46:19 - here so this actually gives a ball now
46:21 - we can use collect it in or we can store
46:25 - it as a pool variable called should
46:28 - continue and set it equal like that and
46:33 - then we can use an if statement but we
46:35 - don't actually need to store each one of
46:37 - them in a variable instead we can simply
46:39 - do a if statement and then wrap the
46:42 - explosion in that and I know it looks
46:45 - kind of confusing but this actually does
46:47 - the same thing so right here we are
46:48 - calling the
46:50 - load cell and we're saying that if it
46:53 - returns true well then we want to go
46:55 - ahead and explode the next cell in the
46:57 - same direction and we want to go ahead
47:00 - and do that for each given direction so
47:02 - if explode cell on the Y here it's true
47:07 - well then we want to explode this second
47:09 - cell on the Y and we just go through and
47:12 - do this for each one of them so if
47:14 - whoops don't want to manually write this
47:16 - when you can do that if explode cell on
47:20 - negative x here we'll want to explode
47:24 - the second one and if explode cell on
47:26 - the first negative Y well then we want
47:31 - to explode this second cell on the
47:33 - negative Y there we go and that should
47:37 - actually do all of the appropriate
47:40 - checking for us of course you could use
47:42 - Ray casts and colliders and complicate
47:44 - yourself in all kinds of ways but this
47:46 - does the exact same thing and sometimes
47:48 - this is what you have to do if you're
47:49 - used to working with unity and kind of
47:52 - thinking about these problems in an
47:54 - abstract three-dimensional ways such as
47:56 - we need to determine if something is
47:58 - blocking this explosion we send out a
48:00 - ray to determine this much of this stuff
48:03 - can be avoided if you just take a step
48:05 - back and look at the problem and say
48:08 - well everything is on a grid and that
48:11 - just simply simplifies so many things so
48:14 - here we got away by using not using ray
48:17 - casts and simply writing out of some of
48:19 - this code and it's actually very
48:21 - effective because we're only returning a
48:24 - boolean here so it shouldn't really cost
48:26 - too much
48:27 - performance-wise yeah as you can see I'm
48:30 - pretty satisfied with this piece of
48:31 - course so let's go ahead and hit play
48:35 - and now we should see that if we place
48:38 - it say here it should get blocked here
48:41 - and indeed it does if we place it
48:43 - between two walls the explosion doesn't
48:46 - go through and that's actually the end
48:48 - of what I wanted to show you we can now
48:50 - place bombs all over the place and they
48:53 - should interact appropriately you can
48:55 - also see that the bomb right now doesn't
48:58 - trigger if an explosion hits it you can
49:00 - have some bombs trigger other bombs it's
49:02 - that if that
49:03 - something you want we can also just
49:05 - change the order so it doesn't look bad
49:07 - as it does right now so in here the palm
49:10 - county has an ordering layer of one
49:12 - let's go ahead and set the explosions
49:14 - over in the year two three so now the
49:15 - explosion overlays all of the objects
49:18 - and we should see that if we placed two
49:20 - bombs next to each other it looks a bit
49:22 - better when they explode so yeah that's
49:25 - just a tiny fix really from here it's up
49:27 - to you to go ahead and add some kind of
49:29 - character controller and you can you
49:31 - make him rigidbody enabled because
49:33 - everything is set up to work with
49:34 - colliders it's about adding power-ups we
49:38 - have a video on YouTube that we did
49:42 - recently on creating power-ups for games
49:44 - so if that's something you want to add
49:46 - to your game definitely check out that
49:48 - video and if you have any more questions
49:50 - about tile maps I also did a video
49:53 - specifically on creating and modifying
49:55 - tar maps unity and creating your own
49:57 - custom tiles importing tile sets so if
50:00 - you want to use your own sprites and not
50:01 - my example project here definitely check
50:04 - out that video as well so I think that's
50:06 - pretty much all the video shoutouts that
50:07 - I could think of right now and yeah I
50:10 - hope you guys enjoyed this video I think
50:12 - it was a pretty exciting little project
50:14 - to make and it's something that I've
50:16 - been wanting to do ever since I heard
50:17 - unity was working on a tile map system I
50:19 - thought Bomberman this will be the bomb
50:22 - no pun intended
50:24 - so um cool yeah that's pretty much the
50:27 - end of the road for the tutorial I think
50:31 - we are ready to go to the Q&A so hello
50:36 - everyone in chat I am all ready to do
50:39 - more talking luckily I've got some water
50:44 - with me and at this point you are or
50:47 - completely free la can't talk anymore
50:51 - feel free at this point to ask questions
50:54 - I will do my best to answer them
50:56 - anything at all try and avoid duplicate
51:00 - questions twine about try and avoid ants
51:03 - spamming them in fact don't spam at all
51:07 - but yeah just ask away
51:11 - I'm here cool so I'm gonna take it to
51:14 - the water
51:17 - and all of you guys have some questions
51:19 - for me they can be technical
51:21 - non-technical personal why are you using
51:26 - Victor 3 and instead of Victor - int
51:29 - that's a good question the reason why is
51:31 - that inside of the art or using the time
51:37 - app API things actually come back with
51:40 - the C position as well and I think this
51:42 - has to do with ordering for different
51:44 - tasks on the same layer I think you are
51:45 - able to do something along those lines
51:47 - I'm not completely sure but for some
51:50 - reason it does return a vector3 and with
51:52 - the Z position in our example everything
51:54 - is at zero so I'm sure that you could
51:56 - use vector to end and it would
51:58 - automatically convert it to that just
52:01 - didn't see a reason - how should I start
52:04 - at learning low poly modeling in blender
52:06 - well actually do have a tutorial series
52:09 - on creating a low poly model that is
52:12 - came ready in blender so you can check
52:14 - that out but really it's just about
52:16 - start starting to create some of these
52:18 - things just downloading blender open it
52:23 - up being complete idiot and don't know
52:26 - where anything is and just take it from
52:29 - there it's about practice really but
52:31 - there are some really good blender
52:33 - tutorials online not only this series
52:35 - that I did
52:37 - hey Braga's do have some good links
52:39 - about the API of unity networking sorry
52:44 - not off the top of my head know what is
52:46 - your call and using interfaces in a
52:48 - unity game I use them for some of my
52:52 - games
52:53 - I think interfaces for me is for I
52:59 - should wear this differently I normally
53:01 - only use interfaces very rarely and the
53:05 - reason why is that when I make a game
53:09 - most of the time it's smaller projects
53:11 - and it's game jam projects or tutorial
53:13 - projects and in those it's not often
53:15 - that I need the functionality of
53:16 - interfaces because most of what
53:19 - interfaces are used for our writing
53:22 - solid code especially if you have a
53:25 - large code base or if you're working
53:27 - multiple people on a project
53:29 - often doesn't make sense if you're
53:30 - trying to do something as quickly as
53:31 - possible and so I don't often use them
53:33 - but they can be really really useful
53:35 - they can also be a trap so they're great
53:39 - if you know what you're doing
53:41 - would you like to create a video
53:43 - tutorial on photon multiplayer maybe at
53:45 - some point I heard photon is great are
53:48 - you going to make a chess game in the
53:50 - next live stream because I think it's an
53:51 - easy thing to make chess could be fun
53:55 - I've never thought of it as easy but I
53:59 - guess with this time app system it
54:01 - wouldn't be that hard that's actually a
54:04 - very good idea I will write it down no
54:09 - promises but I'll write it out do you
54:11 - make an Android tutorial I try not to
54:13 - make platform-specific tutorials too
54:14 - much do publish games
54:16 - I don't publish finished games no I do
54:18 - create smaller projects for tutorials
54:20 - and game jams if you want to check out
54:22 - my games you can go to the aloo Matar a
54:24 - website or just search for brekkie
54:26 - student diary and they should appear how
54:29 - about footprint tutorial that could
54:30 - definitely be exciting creating some
54:32 - kind of custom shader for that could be
54:33 - fun they're going to make some Android
54:35 - tutor again same thing as before can you
54:38 - make a bazooka to talk Wow
54:40 - bazookas could be cool I really want to
54:42 - do that I don't think I think it's a bit
54:46 - too close to something I've done before
54:47 - I've created a tutorial on creating
54:49 - grenades in unity that actually destroys
54:51 - part of the environment so I think you
54:55 - could check that out and then simply
54:57 - instead of having a grenade model just
55:00 - have a missile model that just threw a
55:05 - shoot through the level with some
55:06 - particles and something I've pretty much
55:08 - the same thing do you have any idea to
55:13 - do tutorials on an open-world game no
55:17 - that is simply too complex and requires
55:19 - way too much asset creation will you do
55:23 - some tutorials and databases if I was
55:25 - better at databases I probably would
55:27 - however I mean anything can they depends
55:30 - on if you mean local and network
55:31 - databases anything networked is
55:33 - something I suck at local database is
55:36 - there a bunch of stuff that you can do
55:37 - there with JSON and XML or scriptable
55:41 - objects I will
55:42 - have a tutorial on scriptable objects
55:43 - that I suggest to check out if you want
55:44 - to create a local database or just easy
55:48 - way of storing or creating data objects
55:54 - in unity you can check out my scribble
55:56 - objects video but networks probably not
55:59 - right now can you do some advanced 2d
56:01 - tutorials I don't know about you guys
56:05 - but I thought this was fairly advanced I
56:07 - know that there's a lot more that you
56:09 - can do with the Tal map system but it's
56:12 - probably just because I've never used it
56:13 - before but I was researching this and I
56:16 - was confused at some points mostly with
56:19 - the relationship between tiles and and
56:22 - how you're supposed to go about
56:23 - everything but yeah but I would love to
56:27 - do some more advanced stuff at some
56:28 - point do you have any idea to make basic
56:31 - copy protection for unity games nope
56:33 - sorry why gravity not working with
56:36 - animated component if you're over I
56:41 - don't know this this completely depends
56:44 - on the setup of your project but if you
56:46 - are overriding positions of a game
56:48 - object then physics aren't going to work
56:52 - you can physics enable your animation so
56:56 - that physics get applied on top of your
56:58 - animations you shouldn't be modifying
57:00 - the brute position of your object
57:02 - anyways through animation that is my
57:05 - answer
57:06 - can you do a 2d tutorial in the style of
57:08 - Castle Crashers don't starve slash don't
57:11 - starve where there is some depth not
57:17 - completely sure what you mean but those
57:19 - games are awesome and I could maybe do
57:22 - something along those lines
57:24 - yeah what is the best way to make in
57:28 - this run and spawned objects pose yes
57:31 - object pools are basically made for
57:35 - endless runners they are the best
57:37 - example of where you could use object
57:39 - pools so definitely check out my new
57:41 - video on object pooling yay and if you
57:44 - want to learn about some of the other
57:47 - stuff on creating it this runner check
57:49 - out the how to making video game series
57:50 - which shows that can you test our games
57:54 - we
57:55 - actually talking about doing a
57:56 - livestream earlier today after Ludum
58:00 - dare a where I play your games an entire
58:02 - livestream reserved for Christians and
58:05 - answers and just having fun and playing
58:07 - some of the games that you guys create
58:09 - that is something that I really want to
58:11 - do so I'll try to make Ori to set that
58:16 - up only if you guys want to see it if
58:19 - you let me know actually right now is
58:21 - that something you would like to see
58:22 - where we just take some time an hour or
58:24 - so where we sit down and chill and you
58:27 - guys send me some of the games that you
58:29 - make and I can maybe give some feedback
58:31 - and try them out and suck at them live
58:33 - and embarrass myself go cry in the
58:35 - corner now that I think about it it
58:38 - sounds great
58:40 - do you want to create a shaded tutorial
58:43 - series
58:43 - yes especially with the new shader graph
58:45 - I've never been a technical artist per
58:49 - se and so my shader writing knowledge is
58:52 - limited and you know some stuff but not
58:55 - all of it definitely and I would love to
58:58 - cover the new shader graph because
59:00 - they're going to I think it's going to
59:01 - be pretty much the standard standard of
59:04 - how people are going to make be making
59:06 - shaders in unity soon yeah I don't see a
59:10 - lot of people scripting their own
59:14 - shaders with this new tall vegetation
59:20 - and realistic environment on unity and
59:22 - that's something that could be really
59:23 - interested doing something some of this
59:26 - photogrammetry stuff in unity showing
59:28 - off stuff like mega scans or doing a
59:33 - video one on PBR and and some of those
59:35 - rendering techniques but a lot of this
59:38 - stuff is happening to unity right now
59:40 - especially with the scriptable render
59:41 - pipeline so I wouldn't want to go too
59:43 - much into detail before we know kind of
59:46 - how it's RP is going to turn out and how
59:49 - the new graphics workflow and unity is
59:51 - going to be things are still kind of
59:54 - unknown because things are in early beta
59:56 - and so um do you have any
60:01 - recommendations for someone someone
60:04 - wanting to study in Denmark coming from
60:06 - Portugal
60:09 - recommendations yeah I think what I
60:15 - would probably do is is try and go to
60:18 - people in order to make friends because
60:21 - we Danes we tend to kind of not be too
60:24 - good at being the ones that has the
60:27 - incentive to you know actually go and
60:30 - talk to people we tend to kind of shield
60:32 - ourselves and only talk to the ones that
60:34 - we know I know when you talk to
60:35 - ourselves if we are weird like I am and
60:37 - then but but really most people if you
60:40 - just come and talk to them they enjoy it
60:43 - we do enjoy it we just don't do it I
60:46 - don't know why so that would probably be
60:48 - the main thing is just go and talk to
60:51 - people that way you're going to have
60:53 - friends because otherwise yeah and go to
60:57 - social events try and find some mom some
61:01 - circles of people that you think could
61:04 - be like-minded I think that's probably
61:07 - the main thing moving to another country
61:08 - is try and build a network what do you
61:13 - recommend for learning more about
61:14 - shaders right now there are of course a
61:19 - bunch of good resources for shader
61:21 - writing I would mostly recommend stuff
61:25 - like cat like so cat like coding Ellen's
61:28 - Taccone and making stuff look good on
61:32 - YouTube there was some I three can you
61:36 - make us a turtle for survival games I
61:38 - already have a huge series on creating a
61:41 - survival game in unity guys come on
61:42 - it's like 35 videos long or something
61:45 - but and I'm not gonna touch it anymore
61:47 - I'm sorry it's it's too old it's
61:49 - outdated and I think it's more exciting
61:51 - to do different kind of projects you can
61:53 - go watch that to get some inspiration at
61:55 - least I'm sorry that it's old and in
61:57 - JavaScript but yeah but really a
62:02 - survival game is in much way in many
62:07 - ways the same as kind of it kind of a
62:09 - mix between a first-person shooter and
62:12 - an RPG so you can check out my
62:15 - multiplayer first tutorial and my RPG
62:18 - tutorial and try and combine the two in
62:21 - a way that
62:22 - sex that would probably be my
62:24 - recommendation what games to play
62:26 - yourself I play a lot of games I don't
62:28 - have time to play them but I try and
62:31 - play a lot of games this is what I
62:33 - should say so right now or for a long
62:38 - time now my big passion has been csgo
62:41 - Counter Strike global Offensive it's
62:43 - just so fun and I often I'm kind of a
62:47 - social game and most of the time when I
62:48 - play it with friends and it's such a fun
62:50 - competitive game so we play that a lot
62:52 - historically I've played a huge amount
62:55 - of World of Warcraft
62:56 - what if I was able to take all the hours
62:58 - that I put into World of Warcraft and
63:00 - put them into a actually useful skill I
63:02 - would be the world's best guitarist but
63:07 - yeah those are two that I've spent a lot
63:10 - of time on but I also try and play
63:13 - smaller games I just replayed a super
63:17 - meatboy which was really fun I haven't
63:19 - played that for a very long time and
63:22 - recently I played all the way through
63:24 - Ori and the blind forest which is such a
63:28 - good game I couldn't recommend it enough
63:30 - and I'm looking so much forward to full
63:31 - of the wisps on this the second one and
63:34 - also I just picked up the new Dragon
63:37 - Ball game
63:38 - fighter is with the Z that's that's
63:43 - really really fun actually it's it's the
63:45 - best one in a while I think and I really
63:47 - love the way that they've shifted to
63:49 - kind of a locked 2.5 T perspective much
63:54 - in the same way that the old fighting
63:56 - games like Street Fighter work because I
63:58 - thought before the 3d element didn't
64:01 - really work for me I liked it to be kind
64:03 - of simple and it is now and it's just
64:05 - yeah incredibly fun and competitive so
64:07 - check that out which one is better pixel
64:10 - art or low poly 3d completely depends on
64:13 - the game that's the pretty much all
64:16 - there is to say
64:18 - are there going to be any more blender
64:20 - tutorials if you guys want them is there
64:25 - something similar to C++ custom header
64:27 - files in unity c-sharp
64:35 - No
64:37 - can you make a video about game
64:39 - optimization some best practices that
64:41 - would be really fun and it's something
64:43 - that I've had on my list for a long time
64:48 - it's something yeah yeah I would love to
64:53 - do like top five performance or
64:55 - optimization tips and unity and just
64:58 - delve into some different things that
65:00 - normally can be can be apply or some
65:05 - techniques that can normally be applied
65:07 - to most projects in order to make them
65:09 - run better that would definitely be fun
65:11 - one of the big ones is of course object
65:13 - pooling that I just covered in a
65:14 - separate video
65:15 - but also just kind of naming some of
65:17 - these things yeah I would love to do
65:20 - that why don't you apply for a job at
65:22 - unity because I don't really want to
65:25 - work at unity not that it doesn't seem
65:27 - like a great place to work but because I
65:29 - really want to keep doing this and this
65:30 - is really fun and I like the
65:32 - independence so being able to do this at
65:37 - home with some awesome people like
65:40 - Sophie and Thomas is it's really just
65:42 - the biggest gift so yeah why not use a
65:45 - for loop for the explosions in the
65:46 - bomberman tutorial I don't that's
65:53 - probably some way to do that but I don't
65:56 - really see it being simpler because we
65:59 - have to offset them in different ways
66:02 - yeah yeah I know so those of you guys
66:07 - talking about a discord server there is
66:09 - an unofficial discord created by some
66:12 - guys from the forum that is really
66:13 - awesome and we are talking about kind of
66:15 - promoting it some more so if you guys
66:17 - want to hang out and do some real-time
66:18 - chat with the game development community
66:20 - definitely go there I'm sure that the
66:23 - awesome admins will put a link in the
66:26 - chat right now that would be great just
66:29 - yeah a lot of awesome developers there
66:32 - all right so I think they're going to be
66:34 - wrapping up questions now because my
66:36 - throat is getting sore and I do have
66:38 - more stuff to do on today unfortunately
66:41 - work awaits
66:43 - but yeah so final questions and we'll go
66:46 - and wrap this up so do you have a team
66:49 - development or do you do it solo we are
66:51 - three people I of course do all the
66:54 - recording stuff as you can see but we
66:58 - also have Thomas and which is our main
67:01 - video editor he does most are close to
67:05 - all of our video editing and he's become
67:07 - really really good at it I hope you guys
67:10 - recognize that as well the videos
67:12 - require way more editing now especially
67:15 - the ones that are pre-scripted with
67:16 - b-roll and everything so he pretty much
67:19 - does all that and then we have Sophia
67:21 - which does all the video planning she's
67:23 - also used to do a bunch of editing and
67:25 - has been doing that for very long time
67:28 - now but yes she does all the planning
67:31 - she sets up sponsorship deals stuff like
67:35 - that I don't know if you guys have
67:37 - noticed it but we have been having a few
67:40 - sponsors lately and she's able to fund
67:42 - find really good one once it's always
67:45 - tech related we had some sponsorships
67:48 - with with udemy with unity with
67:52 - Skillshare and yeah more coming so
67:55 - that's really awesome and and yes it
67:58 - just kind of you know makes Thomas and I
68:00 - follow the schedule so everything with
68:05 - you know crumble and and yes um
68:08 - sometimes they also soufiane Thomas also
68:11 - held in in scripting videos so yeah we
68:14 - have three people at at the moment and
68:16 - which is really fun because doing
68:18 - something alone is fun doing it with
68:20 - friends even more fun can you do a
68:24 - website game tutorial maybe at some
68:28 - point can you make a tutorial an RTS
68:31 - game with a simple I I've talked about
68:37 - RTS before it's too complicated I do
68:39 - want to go ahead and create some kind of
68:44 - RTS related videos because some of the
68:46 - things are interesting but creating an
68:47 - entire RTS game is way too complicated
68:49 - for a Totoro series turn-based castle
68:51 - game that sounds really fun have you
68:53 - ever thought of doing a 2d top-down
68:55 - shooter I have done one it was fun it's
68:58 - called waving coming it's on my
69:00 - github so if you want to check it out
69:01 - it's there I hate spamming please tell
69:03 - me how to market games free and paid I
69:09 - actually have no idea my way of
69:11 - marketing my game when I was making
69:13 - games and thought it that I wanted to be
69:15 - a game developer was creating a YouTube
69:17 - channel and doing tutorials so I don't
69:19 - the the tutorial part turned out pretty
69:22 - well the game part not so much so and
69:24 - now I'm here so I wouldn't really know
69:26 - too much about that but it's really
69:28 - about figuring out where is your
69:30 - audience and trying to tap into those to
69:33 - the streams available for that audience
69:36 - so in my case I thought my audience
69:38 - because my game was about making games
69:40 - thought would be game developers and so
69:42 - I thought I would try and tap into unity
69:45 - users and with the turtles so that's
69:48 - kind of how I got rolling so that's my
69:50 - thought process at least why Facebook
69:53 - post Twitter but not Instagram because I
69:55 - just don't use Instagram I don't know
69:57 - how it works I've never used it it's
69:59 - good
70:01 - did you create any games with mechanics
70:03 - like in these sim series not really can
70:06 - you make a meditation tutorial and unity
70:08 - yes that would be fun
70:09 - will you make it to turn on mobile game
70:11 - controls I try not to do too much
70:12 - platform specific stuff but maybe mobile
70:16 - game controls could be fun there are a
70:18 - lot of great also free assets for that
70:23 - can you make an advanced 2d platformer
70:25 - character controller not right now it's
70:28 - not on the roadmap they're a bunch of
70:29 - stuff in the asset store check that out
70:31 - do you plan to do a video about the new
70:33 - co-op job system and entities components
70:35 - they seem to be awesome if I'm able to
70:37 - figure them out if they when they come
70:39 - out yes
70:41 - otherwise I might just leave that to
70:43 - your Kim so yeah okay can you make a
70:47 - tutorial to create portal I have a
70:48 - portal 2 tutorial on the YouTube I'm
70:51 - creating this called portal effect not
70:53 - the entire game but I'm sure you can
70:54 - figure something out based on that
70:55 - slowstar send real-time displacement
70:57 - tutorial that sounds fun a lot of
70:59 - graphic stuff guys I would love to do
71:00 - some more graphic stuff especially with
71:02 - the new shader editor and I think we are
71:05 - going to close it here alright questions
71:09 - are up we are closing it it's a wrap
