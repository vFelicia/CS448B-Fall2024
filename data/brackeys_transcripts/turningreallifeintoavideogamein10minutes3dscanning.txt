00:00 - so traditionally 3d art for games has
00:02 - been created manually artists have been
00:04 - using specialized 3d modeling software
00:05 - to create everything from scratch these
00:08 - programs allow you to model sculpt and
00:10 - paint props and environments that you
00:12 - can then import into a game engines such
00:14 - as unity for creating realistic looking
00:16 - models and textures is actually a really
00:18 - complicated process and it requires the
00:21 - combination of artistic skills and
00:22 - technical know-how that is pretty hard
00:24 - to get Plus making something that looks
00:26 - real is just incredibly time-consuming
00:28 - because turns out real life is pretty
00:30 - detailed and adding all this detail by
00:33 - hand that's a challenge so over the last
00:36 - few years a new trend has been taking
00:38 - over the gamedev industry I'm of course
00:40 - talking about 3d scanning this is a
00:42 - process where you go out into the real
00:43 - world with some specialized camera
00:45 - equipment and record geometry and
00:47 - material data that you can then take
00:49 - back into your virtual world and at the
00:51 - forefront of this technology has been a
00:53 - company called
00:54 - quick soul they've built a huge library
00:56 - of assets and materials by going out and
00:59 - painstakingly making thousands of scans
01:01 - around the world but so far this process
01:03 - has been pretty complicated and it
01:05 - requires a lot of special equipment so
01:07 - not much luck if you want to do it
01:09 - yourself
01:09 - but recently ubiquity six reached out to
01:11 - us about a service they'd been working
01:13 - on called display land and how they're
01:15 - trying to make the power of 3d scanning
01:17 - available to everyone now display land
01:19 - is a free app that you download and it
01:22 - allows you to create 3d scans just using
01:24 - the built in camera of your phone so
01:26 - just to be completely transparent this
01:27 - video is sponsored by display land but I
01:30 - will say that we were completely blown
01:31 - away with how well this technology
01:33 - actually works and even crazier just how
01:35 - easy it is to use so for the first scan
01:38 - we try creating a scan of our office and
01:40 - dress walked around the room while
01:42 - filming everything he saw then once he
01:44 - felt like he'd captured everything in a
01:46 - good amount of detail we hit upload and
01:48 - the scan went to the cloud for
01:49 - processing and after a little while it
01:51 - was ready to view on the phone in fact
01:53 - display land is a social app as well and
01:56 - from here it allows you to share scans
01:57 - as well as follow other creators but for
02:00 - this test we just send it to the
02:01 - computer and opened it up in a browser
02:03 - and getting it into unity was just as
02:06 - easy
02:06 - we simply exported it as an obj and
02:09 - dragged it in I created a material
02:11 - assigned a texture and
02:13 - it was of course the scan itself does
02:15 - have the lighting of our office built
02:17 - into the texture but I found that even
02:19 - with that it reacted pretty well to the
02:21 - lighting conditions of our scene so I
02:23 - added a few point lights to where there
02:25 - were lights in the office as was dragged
02:27 - in a few example assets and it's pretty
02:29 - amazing how well they fit the scene out
02:31 - of the box they instantly looked like
02:33 - they were part of the room and this is
02:35 - when I realized if the scan has actual
02:37 - geometry and it actually looks pretty
02:39 - clean we can probably have physics
02:41 - objects interact with it and sure enough
02:42 - after adding a mesh Collider and a
02:45 - sphere with a rigidbody we had physics
02:47 - in fact I got so excited I created a
02:49 - quick script that would spawn spheres
02:51 - over time which ended up looking pretty
02:53 - cool
02:53 - it definitely answered the question of
02:55 - how our office would look if it got
02:56 - flooded by red balls in a weird way it's
02:59 - kind of beautiful so for this first test
03:01 - under the belt we were ready to do some
03:03 - more scanning but how does this process
03:05 - actually work well this plane and
03:07 - essentially creates 3d captures using a
03:09 - process called photogrammetry it uses
03:12 - many images of the same geometry but
03:14 - taken from different perspectives to
03:15 - create a 3d reconstruction of the scene
03:17 - it's the same reason why animals have
03:20 - two eyes you need two different
03:22 - perspectives in order to determine depth
03:24 - which is also why if you close one eye
03:26 - it gets pretty hard to tell how far away
03:28 - things are so after taking a video with
03:31 - some different perspectives on the thing
03:32 - you want to scan the video as well as
03:34 - some sensor data gets sent to the cloud
03:36 - where it gets turned into a 3d model
03:38 - some scans take just a few minutes to
03:40 - process while larger scans can take up
03:42 - to a few hours and we actually slowly
03:44 - started to figure out what makes a good
03:46 - scan in fact it's something you really
03:48 - get better at with practice generally
03:50 - you want to shoot in fairly even
03:52 - lighting conditions and move the camera
03:54 - at a slow and steady pace it's also a
03:56 - good idea to scan from as many different
03:57 - angles as possible and to avoid any
04:00 - reflective surfaces and scanning objects
04:02 - with lots of texture definitely helps
04:04 - the tracker a lot for example take a
04:06 - look at these props we scanned these
04:08 - outside on a fairly cloudy day and all
04:10 - of them have a good textured but non
04:12 - reflective surface of course sometimes
04:14 - the Sun peeks through the clouds but the
04:15 - tracker actually managed to handle that
04:17 - quite well in fact we thought they
04:19 - looked so realistic that we might be
04:20 - able to use them together with regular
04:22 - 3d models in other words could we take
04:24 - these scans and put them into an
04:26 - otherwise
04:26 - virtual environment without them
04:28 - standing out so transit that question I
04:30 - went to the unity asset store and found
04:32 - this free industrial environment I
04:34 - imported everything into unity played
04:36 - around with the lighting and materials a
04:37 - bit and added a first-person controller
04:39 - and voila we had a tiny game where we
04:41 - could move around and interact with the
04:43 - environment so far so good
04:45 - now for the scans and this was actually
04:47 - just a cc I downloaded each scan and
04:49 - open it up in blender to cut off any
04:51 - unnecessary geometry I then reacts
04:53 - ported to direct the model and texture
04:55 - into unity and assigned a simple little
04:57 - and right away it looked amazing I'd
05:00 - expected the scans to stand out like a
05:01 - sore thumb but as soon as unity did its
05:03 - rendering magic the concrete table
05:06 - blended in perfectly
05:07 - of course the scans aren't optimized to
05:09 - use a simple geometry as possible
05:11 - there's inevitably going to be a lot of
05:12 - extra vertices on these models so if
05:15 - you're looking to use them in a
05:16 - commercial game I would recommend doing
05:17 - some work in order to try and reduce the
05:19 - amount of polygons but the cool thing is
05:21 - that you can utilize the fact that you
05:23 - have a very detailed version of the
05:24 - model by simply baking all this detail
05:27 - into a normal map so next up I tried
05:29 - importing these statues and they were
05:31 - even more impressive in fact you could
05:33 - actually read some of the writing on
05:35 - them so I created a tiny gallery for the
05:37 - player to explore finally I thought the
05:39 - tree stump was just too good a scan not
05:41 - to include but I didn't really have any
05:43 - way to put it in the level since it
05:45 - didn't have any greenery so I turned the
05:47 - play into a tree which ended up looking
05:49 - more disturbing than expected but of
05:51 - course the real test was still to come
05:54 - could we make a game with a level that
05:56 - was entirely 3d scanned so we went out
05:58 - into our courtyard to see if we could
06:00 - scan a larger environment and while we
06:02 - had good success on the buildings it
06:04 - wasn't really a fair fight for the
06:05 - scanner considering the amount of
06:07 - clutter and bicycles reflecting light
06:09 - everywhere plus it was raining that day
06:11 - which of course makes everything shiny
06:13 - and while just scanning some buildings
06:14 - is cool we thought wouldn't it be even
06:16 - cooler if we took some commonplace items
06:18 - lying around the office and put them
06:21 - together to make a level in real life
06:23 - that we could then load up into unity
06:25 - and play on so that's exactly what we
06:28 - did we immediately got started setting
06:30 - up a nice playing surface and placing
06:32 - objects that our player could work on
06:34 - and after a quick scan of the table we
06:36 - hopped back on the computer I cut off
06:38 - some geometry loaded it into
06:40 - unity created a ground cube for it to
06:42 - stand on and the level was ready of
06:44 - course we still had to build the actual
06:46 - game our idea was to create a top-down
06:49 - shooter where the player has to fight
06:50 - through a series of enemies so I set up
06:53 - a quick prototype scene and immediately
06:55 - got to work on creating the basic
06:56 - mechanics I started with movement and
06:58 - making the player aim to what's the
07:00 - mouse I then made him shoot added some
07:02 - enemies to shoot at as well as some
07:04 - particles for bullets and explosions and
07:06 - at this point I was ready to put
07:08 - everything inside of our level so I
07:09 - imported the player added a rotating
07:11 - camera and placed around a few enemies
07:13 - and pecking the navmesh for this was
07:15 - extremely easy I just played around with
07:17 - the slope and step height a bit and the
07:19 - enemies were moving appropriately around
07:21 - the level of course they're currently
07:23 - did nothing to damage the player so I
07:25 - made them shoot and stop when they got
07:26 - close enough I also implemented spawning
07:28 - in case the player died and made the
07:30 - enemies spawn randomly throughout the
07:32 - level at a slowly increasing rate
07:33 - finally I made some boundaries around
07:35 - the levels so that the player wouldn't
07:37 - fall off and with that we had a game
07:40 - it's nothing fancy but it actually plays
07:42 - pretty well considering how quickly we
07:44 - put it together and everyone at the
07:45 - office had a blast playing it some
07:48 - conclusion while we can never get the
07:49 - highly optimized triple-a quality scans
07:51 - that you can with specialized equipment
07:53 - display then actually makes it possible
07:55 - to start bringing the real world into
07:57 - your game personally I just had a blast
07:59 - playing around with this technology if
08:01 - you want to check out display man for
08:02 - yourself and make some cool-looking
08:04 - scans it's completely free and available
08:06 - on the App Store as well as Google Play
08:08 - we'll have links to both in the
08:09 - description and that's pretty much it
