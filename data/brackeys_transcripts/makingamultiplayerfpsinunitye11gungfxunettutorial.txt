00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello
00:04 - everyone and welcome to this video on
00:05 - making a multiplayer FPS in unity today
00:08 - we are going to have a look at importing
00:10 - a cool gun model into the game and we'll
00:13 - also have a look at setting up a proper
00:15 - camera to a render the camera or its
00:18 - render the weapon so we can control
00:20 - stuff like field of view for the weapon
00:22 - only and also prevent clipping through
00:25 - other objects so that's going to be
00:26 - quite exciting and the model that we are
00:29 - going to be using today is from sameen
00:32 - i've been a good friend of mine links to
00:35 - her mind description and you can see
00:38 - here that I've downloaded the
00:40 - multiplayer FPS assets those are
00:42 - downloadable through brackish comm or
00:44 - you could just download the entire Brown
00:46 - project of github against all the links
00:49 - are in the description so if you want
00:52 - more of this these kinds of assets you
00:53 - should definitely check out some mean he
00:55 - does client work for very cheap and he's
00:58 - just great to work with let's get
01:00 - started so I'm going to open up this
01:02 - multiplayer FPS assets folder which you
01:05 - get in a sip file if you download it and
01:08 - under weapons we now have a sci-fi
01:10 - automatic and here we have an FBX file
01:14 - which is the model itself and we also
01:16 - have some textures oh I should also
01:18 - mention that the reason why I don't have
01:20 - the intro screen and all that fancy
01:22 - stuff in the FaceCam is because I'm
01:24 - quite in a hurry but it will be back in
01:26 - the next video so let's just take this
01:28 - sci-fi automatic and drag it into our
01:31 - unity project just the entire folder and
01:34 - we'll wait for it to import the
01:35 - different images some of these textures
01:38 - are quite high resolution and they're
01:41 - all hand-painted so that's very nice
01:43 - then let's go ahead and make a new
01:45 - folder here and let's just call this one
01:47 - actually want to make one called models
01:49 - now and we can just drag the sci-fi
01:51 - automatic into that folder we could
01:54 - maybe also make a subfolder called
01:55 - weapons but not unless we have more than
01:59 - one weapon so for now this will be fine
02:01 - then what we will do is we will take our
02:03 - player prefab and drag it into the scene
02:05 - so we have something to use as a
02:07 - reference and I just noticed that the
02:12 - collider here seems to be a
02:13 - bit off compared to our graphic I
02:17 - actually don't know why that is so maybe
02:20 - we should take our player model and just
02:22 - move him back bit there just to Center
02:25 - them a bit on the collider itself good
02:28 - so maybe it's decliner that's offset no
02:31 - that should be centered that is centered
02:34 - yeah so that just looks a bit better
02:36 - good so if we go into our camera we
02:39 - currently have our gun here instead of
02:41 - just having our gun directly under the
02:44 - camera I want to create an MT which we
02:46 - are going to call the weapon holder
02:50 - object and this will just allow us to do
02:53 - some transformation for all of the
02:55 - different weapons so we can just move
02:58 - this and all the other weapons will move
03:00 - with it and let's just keep the gun here
03:03 - for a second then let's go under our
03:06 - models sci-fi automatic and drag in the
03:10 - gun and let's drag it under the weapon
03:12 - holder and we can see that this is
03:14 - currently gigantic and that's because we
03:16 - have a pre applied scale here if we
03:18 - reset that it quickly shrinks down to be
03:22 - very very tiny and let's now drag the
03:24 - weapon hold it over to kind of where we
03:28 - want all of our weapons to be somewhere
03:32 - like here and then we want all of them
03:34 - to be rotated about negative 90 on the X
03:38 - to come for plant a blenders weird
03:41 - rotation and then we can select our
03:44 - model and we can bump up the scale
03:46 - factor to something like 10 and hit
03:48 - apply we can also disable animations no
03:51 - rig and all of the other stuff should be
03:54 - just fine and I think this is a pretty
03:56 - good scale to work with it might be a
03:58 - bit too large compared to the model but
04:01 - that depends on kind of the look you are
04:03 - going for if you're going for kind of a
04:04 - comedic look that I am here with these
04:08 - funny-looking robot thingies trying to
04:10 - shoot each other well then a large gun
04:13 - could be kind of fun
04:15 - so I'm just going to keep this for now
04:17 - at least great so I think that this gun
04:21 - is almost in position we can go ahead
04:23 - and drag the weapon hold it down a bit
04:26 - something like that
04:27 - and we don't want this to be colliding
04:29 - with our models so we can maybe drag
04:32 - this out you will of course also have to
04:34 - kind of make it look good in terms of
04:37 - when viewed from the camera but I'm
04:39 - going to show you a trick in a moment
04:41 - that will allow us to kind of zoom in on
04:43 - the gun here without actually changing
04:46 - its position in world space because we
04:48 - want this to kind of not collide with
04:52 - our graphics themselves and we can also
04:55 - go ahead and maybe move this even more
04:57 - even further back to kind of avoid that
05:00 - good so now that we have that set up
05:04 - something like that yeah we can go ahead
05:08 - and delete our temporary gun it's not
05:11 - something that we're going to be needing
05:13 - and we can also add some materials to
05:18 - our Starfire automatic so you can see
05:20 - that that it already has three materials
05:24 - applied it's only one mesh with three
05:27 - materials and let's just begin with the
05:30 - main one if we go and just lock the
05:33 - inspector here we can go under the
05:35 - textures and we can select them and
05:38 - actually view their full names down here
05:40 - so let's find the one that says Maine
05:43 - albedo transparency that's going to go
05:45 - up here under albedo and let's make that
05:48 - completely white to go with it then we
05:50 - have a sci-fi automatic Maine metallic
05:53 - smoothness that goes under the metallic
05:55 - slide and then we finally we have a
05:57 - normal map which goes there and then we
05:59 - hit fixed now and that should give us a
06:02 - cool base to work with and then we can
06:05 - go collapse that and go under the
06:07 - magazine and that's this one so again
06:11 - albedo transparency and make that
06:13 - completely white then we have the
06:15 - metallic Ness drag that under there and
06:18 - finally the normal map which we will hit
06:21 - fix now on and then finally we have our
06:24 - grip which goes Obito transparency
06:28 - white we have the metallic Ness and
06:31 - finally we have the normal map good
06:35 - apply and now we can actually view our
06:37 - model textures and materialized
06:41 - and I think this looks really really
06:44 - awesome so great-looking model there and
06:47 - if there's something you want to change
06:48 - like the color you can of course change
06:50 - all of these in Photoshop if you want or
06:53 - you can simply temp that tint them a bit
06:55 - so if you want it like a a red a colored
06:58 - gun you could just do that in here and
07:00 - it's actually going to look just fine so
07:03 - you could also do kind of a purple or
07:06 - maybe a kind of blue color which I
07:10 - actually kind of dig I mean this light
07:13 - blue here actually looks somewhat badass
07:17 - so I'm just going to go with that for
07:18 - now and that we can always change it
07:20 - later so yeah let's go with that so that
07:25 - just shows you just how customizable
07:27 - these weapons are because they are set
07:29 - up probably properly in every kind of
07:32 - way and yeah so let's now hit apply on
07:36 - this player model it looks like we lost
07:42 - our prefab connection Oh No
07:44 - unlock that and then hit apply cool and
07:48 - everything should be set up right
07:51 - only a few things aren't because right
07:54 - now if we were to delete this player and
07:57 - go and hit play we would see land host
08:01 - that first of all this gun model I mean
08:06 - it's a bit far off this is not how you
08:08 - hold a gun it would be much closer to
08:11 - the eye to feel natural also if we look
08:14 - down it clips through the ground also if
08:18 - we go over here it will clip through the
08:21 - ground and that's not something we can
08:23 - prevent when viewed from other players I
08:25 - mean here in the scene view we cannot
08:27 - prevent it from going through the ground
08:28 - unless we want to like limit how far
08:32 - down we can view which is maybe
08:34 - something we want to do but one thing is
08:37 - for sure and that is we don't want it to
08:39 - happen on this screen so in order to do
08:43 - this what we actually do is we create a
08:46 - separate camera that is in charge of
08:49 - only drawing the gun so if we got a
08:53 - camera here and we
08:54 - right click and then go camera to create
08:57 - a new one we can then call this the
08:59 - weapon camera and we need to configure
09:02 - this in a few ways the first is we need
09:06 - to remember to go to a player under
09:08 - player setup and add a 7th slot here for
09:13 - disabling the weapon cameras let's just
09:15 - drag that in and that is something we
09:17 - want to disable if we're not the local
09:20 - player or we are going to have multiple
09:22 - weapons drawn over the screen and it's
09:24 - going to look super weird the next part
09:27 - is setting the clear flags to depth only
09:30 - this way we don't get stuff like sky
09:33 - boxes or with solid colors or anything
09:35 - like that we want the projection
09:37 - projection to stay at perspective even
09:40 - though you can change that I actually
09:44 - know that would up
09:46 - ok and then the depth should be 1 and
09:48 - this is because we want it to be drawn
09:50 - on top of the other camera so if the
09:52 - other camera has a depth of 0 we want a
09:55 - depth of 1 or above so the value here is
09:59 - completely arbitrary it just needs to be
10:01 - greater than the default camera then the
10:04 - rendering path is going to be fine
10:06 - occlusion culling all that we don't need
10:08 - to change any of these settings only we
10:12 - need to change the culling mask and this
10:14 - is again what layers will be drawn for
10:17 - this camera and currently we want to set
10:19 - this to nothing and then through script
10:21 - we want to set our weapon if we are the
10:25 - local player to a layer of let's say
10:29 - weapon and then we want to add that to
10:31 - be drawn in here so let's go ahead and
10:33 - add in a layer let's add the layer
10:36 - weapon there and I'm not assigning this
10:39 - to any object I'm not assigning it to
10:41 - the weapon camera or the weapon holder
10:42 - or the weapon itself I'm instead going
10:44 - to assign this through script so we can
10:46 - make sure that it's only the local
10:48 - client that will have this layer assign
10:50 - so in here under the culling mask we are
10:53 - going to go down and select weapon and
10:55 - this way this camera is only in charge
10:59 - of drawing the weapon then we can delete
11:02 - the flare layer the cuy layer and the
11:07 - audio listener
11:08 - and you'll apply on that then we can
11:10 - select our default camera and this is
11:12 - where we want to turn our third laser so
11:14 - we want to turn off the WebP and we
11:17 - don't want it to be drawn here or else
11:18 - it's going to be drawn two times and on
11:21 - top of itself and that's going to lose
11:24 - super-weird and be stupid so let's not
11:26 - do that let's just hit apply on that and
11:29 - again if we go at it and play now and
11:33 - nothing is going to have changed and
11:36 - we're still clipping through because
11:37 - we're not actually changing the layer of
11:40 - our weapon so in order to do that let's
11:42 - go in and find our player shoot script
11:45 - let's double click that and we're just
11:48 - going to make a fairly temporary
11:49 - solution for this because in the future
11:52 - I really want to have some kind of way
11:54 - of doing a weapon switching or at least
11:57 - a better way of setting up a weapon
12:00 - pairing it with some graphics and then
12:02 - moving on I mean right now graphics is
12:06 - something we do under the player and the
12:08 - weapon here the name and the damage is
12:10 - completely separate from that I would
12:13 - much rather have this unified idea of a
12:16 - weapon where we have graphics we have
12:18 - stats and the name and all of those
12:20 - different kinds of stuff and then we
12:22 - just call a method that says equip
12:24 - weapon and it will load all of that in
12:26 - but that's in the future especially when
12:28 - doing networking that kind of stuff can
12:30 - be tedious so that's not for this video
12:33 - hopefully for a future one let me know
12:36 - if that's something that you're really
12:37 - wrong I want to see that stuff is coding
12:41 - intensive so yeah the name here we are
12:45 - going to now rename that to sci-fi
12:48 - automatic we should really come up with
12:51 - a better name also if you have a good
12:53 - name leave it in the comments we could
12:55 - do something like this shredder or
12:57 - blaster can annoy something and the
13:00 - damage is 40 and the range is 100 that's
13:02 - fine and this is an automatic weapon and
13:05 - therefore we want to in the future add
13:07 - the option to do automatic shooting but
13:10 - I don't think that's something that we
13:12 - can be covering in this video it's not
13:14 - too difficult but we also want some
13:16 - shooting graphics and in the video where
13:19 - we add those we are probably
13:21 - going to make it automatic - okay so we
13:24 - have the scripting in Visual Studio and
13:26 - all I want to do here is maybe first off
13:30 - change this to a private player weapon
13:33 - on and let's see realize that and also
13:37 - making now allow another serialize field
13:40 - and this is going to be a private and
13:45 - then it's going to store a reference and
13:48 - we want that reference is the layer
13:50 - under the transform or the game object I
13:52 - actually believe it's on the game object
13:54 - whoops not game manager game object and
13:57 - this is going to be a reference to the
13:58 - weapon weapon graphics so we are simply
14:00 - going to do weapon GFX and then in the
14:04 - start method we simply say weapon GFX
14:07 - dot our layer equals our layer mask dot
14:15 - name to layer and the name that we want
14:18 - here is something that we will probably
14:21 - also specify up here so a private
14:24 - constant string and this is not going to
14:26 - be the player tag this is instead going
14:28 - to actually I kind of want to make this
14:31 - available so we'll do a in sterilize
14:33 - field instead and this is going to be a
14:35 - private string and it's going to say
14:39 - weapon layer name and we are going to
14:45 - fold that to weapon easy as that and
14:49 - then we want to take that and put it in
14:52 - here that's going to take in the string
14:54 - return an index that is paired with the
14:58 - layer and that will set that in here it
15:01 - should really be that easy and because
15:03 - we're only calling this this start
15:05 - method on the local client because we
15:07 - are remembering to disable this through
15:10 - script if not you can see up here under
15:13 - the player setup we have the player
15:16 - shoot right here so we are disabling
15:18 - that so therefore it will only be called
15:21 - on a local client and therefore only the
15:23 - local weapon will be set to that layer
15:27 - and everything works out so now on the
15:30 - weapon graphics we want to
15:32 - add reference there so let's just drag
15:34 - this in go in the camera
15:36 - weapon holder sci fi automatic find up
15:39 - player drag that in their weapon layer
15:43 - name weapon and apply boom cool let's do
15:54 - that let's hit save let's just try this
15:56 - on the local client first LAN host so
15:58 - now you can see no clipping yay
16:01 - celebrate and we can still view it in
16:03 - the scene here of course in a moment you
16:05 - can see it's the clips there that's not
16:07 - something that we can prevent right now
16:09 - and we can see that if we move over to
16:13 - the box here there is no clipping on the
16:15 - screen so our technique is actually
16:17 - working and that's awesome another thing
16:20 - that you will notice here is without
16:22 - changing the position of the gun here or
16:25 - without limiting our field of view we
16:29 - can limit the field of view of the
16:31 - camera that draws our gun and this way
16:33 - we can zoom in on this gun make it feel
16:36 - like it's actually closer onto the robot
16:39 - without limiting how much we can see of
16:42 - our surrounding so if we're going to
16:43 - play a 1 camera then weapon camera we
16:47 - can drag in the field of view here and
16:50 - now it looks much more like an actual
16:53 - FPS where we have our hands on the grip
16:55 - and the gun is much closer to the eye so
16:59 - this looks much much better if you ask
17:02 - me and again we haven't changed the
17:04 - position of a camera at all or how much
17:07 - we are able to see actually what we can
17:09 - do is we can go in I'm just going to
17:12 - change the clipping planes here to
17:14 - something like point 1 just to be sure
17:16 - if we can go in and select the other
17:18 - camera and we can actually make the
17:20 - field of view much larger here so if you
17:22 - wanted the ability for the player to see
17:25 - much more you could actually do that and
17:27 - I'm going to bump this up to 70 because
17:30 - I like games with a bit higher field of
17:33 - view so you can just see how much
17:35 - control this actually gives us and yeah
17:39 - so let's start stop playing
17:41 - drag in the player here and just
17:43 - recreate those changes because we made
17:46 - them
17:46 - while we were in play mode so let's set
17:48 - the field of view here to something like
17:49 - 30 the near clipping plane 2.1 and apply
17:54 - on that and the cameras field of view
17:56 - 270 and let's hit apply on that too so
18:00 - now that we have those things there
18:02 - let's fly
18:04 - delete the player let's build this out
18:08 - to a separate client just so we know
18:13 - that this works on the network and not
18:15 - just in on the local instance here which
18:19 - is also the host so let's build this
18:22 - here wait for the lighting to regenerate
18:25 - in unity there we go let's hit play here
18:27 - goal and host and you can see that 30
18:31 - might have been a bit too much actually
18:34 - and what I also want to do is I probably
18:36 - want to move this over a bit more to the
18:39 - left but this is something we can tip
18:40 - back on the local client what we want to
18:43 - see is whether or not it shows up when
18:46 - we join with another client here and
18:47 - indeed it does so we can see the weapon
18:50 - there we can see it here you can see it
18:52 - updating and you can see that it looks
18:54 - just fine when we aim around and also
18:57 - observe just how shiny these weapons
19:00 - actually are I mean they look really
19:03 - really great so that was basically all
19:06 - for what we want to do today actually
19:10 - it's quite a short and to the point
19:13 - tutorial if I must say so too much
19:15 - myself and also again I just want to
19:19 - tweak these settings a bit so the weapon
19:22 - holder let's just drag it over a bit and
19:26 - on the weapon camera just try that 40
19:31 - instead let's see if that works as well
19:35 - planned host yeah and just ignore that
19:39 - camera that's because I didn't want to
19:41 - disable or remove the other player here
19:43 - and that's not something that's supposed
19:45 - to happen so there we go you can see
19:47 - here that this actually looks much
19:49 - better and of course you can tweak that
19:52 - how anyway you want next up is probably
19:54 - adding some particles when we shoot
19:55 - maybe a line renderer
19:57 - from where we shoot and maybe even some
20:00 - bullet impacts also I really want to fix
20:03 - this bug where we can really jump on top
20:05 - of objects without it bucking out so
20:07 - that's definitely also a priority and
20:10 - again this back here only happens
20:12 - because we're giving one player control
20:14 - of multiple players which we really
20:16 - really shouldn't so as soon as we delete
20:18 - that the bug is fixed and everything is
20:21 - working so that was basically it for
20:22 - today's video I hope you enjoyed it and
20:24 - I'll see you in the next one
