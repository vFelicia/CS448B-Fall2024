00:00 - in this video we'll go through all the
00:01 - different image effects in the new
00:02 - post-processing stack we'll talk about
00:04 - what they do and how we can use them
00:06 - this video is also the first sponsored
00:07 - video on this channel however today's
00:09 - sponsor is actually something that I
00:11 - personally use and love it's called
00:13 - Skillshare it's an online learning
00:14 - community and it's a place where you can
00:16 - go to learn all sorts of creative skills
00:18 - I've been using it to them more about
00:19 - graphics programming actually they found
00:21 - this really cool course on making
00:22 - generative art it's really in-depth and
00:32 - the author is a super funny guy so a lot
00:34 - of you guys have been asking me to do
00:35 - procedurally generated stuff well go
00:38 - check that out skill chair has over
00:39 - 15,000 classes for you to choose from
00:41 - and that's especially love cool design
00:43 - stuff like illustrated tips and app
00:45 - design using sketch 3 Premium Membership
00:47 - begins around $10 a month for unlimited
00:48 - access but I have a link for you in the
00:51 - description where you can get two months
00:53 - for free I like free stuff too alright
00:55 - enough about Skillshare let's get into
00:57 - it so first off we want to import the
00:58 - post processing stack I imagine this
01:00 - will be integrated into the editor very
01:02 - soon but for now logistical window asset
01:04 - store let's search for post processing
01:07 - and let's select the post processing
01:08 - stack I'll also have a link to this in
01:10 - the description it's now hit import when
01:12 - this window pops up we'll hit import
01:14 - again and you should now see that a
01:15 - folder called post processing has
01:17 - appeared in your project panel now in
01:19 - order to get this working inside of our
01:20 - game we have to select our main camera
01:22 - we're gonna add a new component and the
01:24 - component we want to add is the post
01:25 - processing behavior we need this on
01:27 - every camera that we want to apply post
01:29 - processing effects to and this takes in
01:31 - a post processing profile a profile is
01:34 - basically just a data pic where we can
01:35 - adjust our effects so we'll go into the
01:37 - project panel right click create I will
01:39 - select post processing profile I'm just
01:41 - gonna call this one CC for color
01:43 - correction and you can see that when we
01:45 - select this object we have all of these
01:46 - different effects available to us
01:48 - remember to also select the camera and
01:50 - drag in the profile you just created now
01:53 - we're actually ready to apply effects
01:55 - however there are a few settings on our
01:56 - camera that I recommend you said if you
01:58 - want to get the most quality out of your
02:00 - game the first one is the rendering path
02:01 - we can change this from forward to
02:03 - deferred this will give us a lot more
02:05 - lining fidelity but it is also harder on
02:08 - the hardware and not supported on some
02:09 - platforms whenever we select deferred
02:11 - here we also have to disable modes
02:13 - anti-aliasing we'll have a look at
02:15 - anti-aliasing in just a second on top of
02:17 - this we'll also go under edit project
02:19 - settings quality and in here make sure
02:21 - to disable anti-aliasing we'll add this
02:23 - through an image effect in just a second
02:25 - and finally we can go to a camera and
02:27 - select allow HDR HDR stands for high
02:30 - dynamic range and it's a way of packing
02:32 - more color data into your image this
02:34 - gives us greater control over the look
02:35 - of the scene when we start applying
02:36 - image effects and helps us avoid
02:38 - clipping where you lose color
02:39 - information in very bright or dark spots
02:42 - now that all of our camera settings are
02:43 - correct we can go to a cc object and
02:45 - start messing around with the image
02:47 - effects let's begin at the very top here
02:49 - with anti-aliasing anti-aliasing is the
02:51 - process of reducing jagged edges
02:53 - it adds interpolation to try and smooth
02:55 - out stair-step like lines let's enable
02:58 - it and you can see immediately what this
02:59 - does to our edges it really helps smooth
03:01 - them out now here we actually have the
03:03 - ability to choose between two methods
03:05 - the fast approximate with the temporal
03:07 - fast approximate is faster but a bit
03:10 - lower quality and temporal is of course
03:12 - the opposite higher quality but also
03:13 - more expensive I find that a very rarely
03:15 - used to timbrel anti-aliasing but it is
03:18 - here and offers a lot more settings
03:20 - however you need 5.6 I have found that
03:22 - it sometimes causes some weird behavior
03:24 - normally you just have to kind of enable
03:26 - it rename it maybe change some settings
03:28 - until it drops right well now I'll be
03:30 - sticking to the fast approximate and in
03:31 - here you also have the ability to choose
03:33 - between quality and performance so next
03:35 - is ambient occlusion ambient occlusion
03:37 - dark and serious were two surfaces
03:39 - intersect to create shadows and places
03:41 - where light would have a hard time
03:42 - escaping from this can be done very
03:44 - precisely by breaking the lighting into
03:46 - a light map on the flight with
03:47 - post-processing using a technique called
03:49 - SSAO screen space ambient occlusion
03:51 - let's enable it and you can see the
03:53 - shadows being applied here to the places
03:55 - where two surfaces meet now this is a
03:57 - good one to adjust a bit the intensity
03:58 - is pretty self-explanatory I like to
04:00 - keep this pretty high when I'm setting
04:02 - all the other settings just to make
04:03 - everything visible then we have the
04:04 - radius this is how close we want the
04:06 - shadows to be so if we decrease this we
04:08 - can see that we are kind of shrinking in
04:10 - the shadows and we can of course also
04:11 - increase them for this game here I'm
04:13 - gonna set them to something like point
04:14 - one two maybe I think that looks alright
04:16 - actually they might bump it up to point
04:18 - two then we have the sample count this
04:19 - is the number of ambient occlusion
04:21 - samples for each pixel on the screen and
04:23 - determines the smoothness of the
04:24 - rendering I find the medium
04:26 - often works pretty well you can see the
04:28 - difference too high here but since we
04:30 - assumed in so far I actually think I'm
04:32 - gonna increase hi in this case gets rid
04:34 - of some of that weird banding we can
04:36 - also disable down sampling down sampling
04:38 - we'll have the resolution of the effect
04:40 - in order to save on performance what I
04:41 - find you can just gain so much visual
04:43 - fidelity by disabling it you will
04:45 - however have a big cost on performance
04:47 - here so it's always a matter of what you
04:48 - can do for your King and the platform
04:50 - you're targeting now I almost never use
04:52 - the next settings here so I'm just gonna
04:53 - bump down the intensity here and we can
04:55 - move on next up a screen space
04:56 - reflection this effect computes
04:58 - reflections based on the surface
04:59 - roughness it cannot make materials feel
05:01 - more lifelike because they actually
05:03 - reflect the surrounding environment so
05:04 - in a current scene here we don't really
05:06 - have any objects that would be
05:07 - influenced by screen space reflection if
05:09 - we enable it you can see it doesn't make
05:11 - too much of a difference let's just for
05:13 - fun take our ground here and add some
05:15 - kind of reflective material to it I've
05:17 - just gone ahead and created a material
05:18 - here with a fairly high metallic value
05:20 - and a fairly high smoothness and you can
05:22 - see now that our ground is indeed
05:24 - creating reflections from the objects in
05:26 - our scene if we go and select our color
05:28 - correction object and go into the screen
05:29 - space reflection tab you can see there's
05:31 - a lot of settings here here's how it
05:33 - looks without you can definitely play
05:34 - around with a lot of these most of the
05:36 - time you'll probably want
05:37 - physically-based reflection you can set
05:38 - the quality between high and low I find
05:41 - that lowest often good enough you also
05:42 - have the max distance until you cannot
05:44 - see reflections anymore most of the time
05:46 - the duration count is fine as is same
05:48 - thing with the step size and width
05:49 - modifier here you can decide how much
05:51 - you want to blur out different flexions
05:52 - you can choose whether or not you want
05:54 - to reflect back faces I would leave this
05:56 - off in cases where you use mostly
05:57 - horizontal surfaces but enable it if you
06:00 - have a lot of vertical reflections the
06:01 - reflection multiply allows us to boost
06:03 - the reflections the distance at which
06:04 - the reflection should start fading and
06:06 - then we have the fernell fade you can
06:08 - see these two sliders adjust how the
06:09 - reflections look the further we get away
06:11 - from the surface then we have depth of
06:13 - field this effect simulates the
06:15 - properties of a real camera lens meaning
06:17 - that it applies focus only to objects
06:19 - with a certain distance from the camera
06:21 - the rest of the image is blurred and
06:22 - bright spots get highlighted with
06:24 - circular artifacts which we refer to as
06:26 - bouquet let's enable that and in our
06:29 - case we can't actually see this effect
06:31 - yet that's because we have to adjust
06:32 - some settings here now a lot of people
06:34 - really get confused about what these
06:35 - terms mean at least if you're not really
06:37 - into photography the focus distance is
06:39 - fairly Suffolk's
06:40 - territory this is the distant from the
06:41 - camera where we put our focus point over
06:43 - the aperture and focal lengths are bit
06:45 - more technical our focal length and
06:47 - camera terms represents the distance
06:49 - between our lens and the film a creative
06:51 - focal length means more blurring this is
06:53 - also why you get more blur when you zoom
06:55 - in with the camera than when zoomed out
06:57 - so if we go ahead and bump this up to
06:58 - something like 70 we can't actually see
07:01 - too much growing yet that's because
07:02 - there's another value that has effect on
07:04 - how much we blur that's the aperture or
07:06 - often referred to as f-stop this is
07:08 - effectively how much we open our lens in
07:11 - order to let light in the lower the
07:12 - value the wider we open the lens and the
07:15 - wider we open the lens the more blurry
07:17 - we get so if we just decrease this we
07:19 - can see that we should start blurring
07:21 - things in our scene of course we don't
07:23 - want to go overboard with this but we
07:25 - can easily put it at around say 1 we can
07:27 - then take our focus distance and
07:29 - decrease it to place it around our
07:31 - barrel and wheels so I think that looks
07:33 - pretty decent if we want this kind of
07:35 - macro shot we could also go out and
07:37 - increase the f-stop if we want to see
07:38 - more of the background or decrease the
07:40 - focal length
07:41 - I think these settings look pretty fine
07:42 - for now then we have motion blur motion
07:44 - blur well blur its motion in real life a
07:47 - camera takes in light over small periods
07:49 - of time if the camera moves during these
07:51 - periods the image gets stretched out
07:52 - creating motion blur I think it's pretty
07:54 - much a must-have effect for fast-moving
07:56 - games so to test out our motion blur
07:58 - I've gone ahead and added an FPS control
07:59 - the Torah's scene this way we can move
08:01 - around and see the motion blur in action
08:03 - if we then enable motion blur under our
08:04 - color correction it should actually
08:06 - already be working just fine if I go
08:08 - ahead and hit play we can see that when
08:10 - I move around the image indeed gets
08:11 - blurred and it makes everything look
08:13 - much smoother especially if you turn it
08:15 - off in comparison the two main slides to
08:17 - worry about here is the shutter angle in
08:18 - the sample count the higher the shutter
08:20 - angle the more the motion blur I'm just
08:21 - gonna put this to something like 300 the
08:24 - higher the Sam account the more smooth
08:25 - the motion blur gets this will also have
08:27 - an impact on performance so I think
08:29 - leaving it at 10 is fine for most cases
08:31 - you can also use the multiple frame
08:32 - blending this is mostly used for
08:34 - artistic purposes if you want to get the
08:36 - drunk effect let me go and turn it up to
08:38 - one here so you can see what that looks
08:40 - like
08:40 - we also have eye adaption this effect
08:42 - adjust the exposure of the image as the
08:44 - game is running creating the illusion of
08:46 - an eye adjusting itself to a lighting
08:48 - environment at the time of making this
08:50 - video the iadapt ation documentation is
08:52 - pretty sparse
08:53 - don't want to just assume what the
08:54 - different parameters mean for me to work
08:56 - fine so far without having to tweak
08:57 - anything I'll have a link to the
08:59 - documentation in the description as well
09:00 - now we have an effect that can really
09:02 - help make your game pop which is also
09:04 - why it's so overused
09:05 - it's called bloom bloom makes light from
09:07 - a bright source bleed into surrounding
09:09 - objects in other words it allows us to
09:11 - add glow to bright spots let's enable it
09:14 - and you can see immediately that it
09:15 - really helps spring a fire to life the
09:17 - effect gives us a few settings the first
09:19 - one is the intensity and this is just
09:21 - the brightness on the stuff that we want
09:22 - to bloom I think a value of 0.5 is
09:24 - pretty okay here then we have the
09:26 - threshold this defines how bright a
09:27 - pixel should be in order to be
09:29 - registered by the effect so if we set
09:31 - this to a very low number you can see
09:32 - that we bloom pretty much the entire
09:33 - scene and if we increase it only the
09:35 - brightest of bright spots will get
09:37 - bloomed I think in our case a value of
09:39 - around 1.4 is going to be cried all
09:42 - right the soft needs how it blends from
09:43 - things under the threshold to things
09:45 - over the threshold you can see what that
09:47 - does here I normally just leave that at
09:49 - 0.5 we didn't have the radius this is
09:51 - how much we want to go ahead and blur
09:52 - the lighting from the original pixels
09:54 - kind of the size of the effect be
09:56 - careful not to overdo this one sometimes
09:58 - when you have a moving camera you can
10:00 - get some really weird flickering if you
10:01 - check the anti flicker it will help
10:03 - prevent that finally you can also apply
10:05 - a dirt texture on top of the camera the
10:07 - post-processing stack comes with a few
10:09 - ones that you can try out I normally
10:11 - don't use these too much the next one is
10:12 - really important it's color grading
10:14 - color grading is without a doubt the
10:16 - largest of the effects because it allows
10:18 - us to control the overall look of our
10:20 - image in terms of exposure color and
10:22 - contrast let's check it and you can see
10:24 - immediately that it really flattens out
10:26 - our image that's because it's currently
10:28 - using the tone mapper now I want to be
10:30 - explicit about this you only want to use
10:32 - the tone mapper meaning having this set
10:34 - to neutral or filmic if you're using HDR
10:37 - if you have HDR unchecked you should go
10:39 - ahead and select none the neutral tone
10:41 - map is going to layout your colors and
10:43 - brightness values so that they look
10:45 - really flat this allows you to apply
10:47 - very hard color correction on top of
10:49 - that it just makes sure that we don't
10:50 - loose a lot of color data so that we can
10:52 - pretty much go in any direction with the
10:54 - image that we want then go ahead and
10:55 - adjust some of the settings for the tone
10:56 - mapper here but I'm actually pretty
10:58 - satisfied with this some instead going
11:00 - to go down and apply some color
11:01 - correction first up we have the exposure
11:03 - this is the overall brightness of the
11:05 - scene then we have stuff like
11:06 - temperature 10
11:07 - hue shift saturation contrast I want to
11:09 - apply a bit of contrast here probably
11:11 - also bump up the exposure a bit I think
11:13 - I'm gonna leave the temperature and
11:15 - maybe tend it slightly magenta we can
11:16 - also shift the hue here which gives a
11:18 - pretty dramatic change and the
11:20 - saturation I think I'm pretty much just
11:22 - gonna leave as is we then have the
11:23 - channel mixer here which allows you to
11:25 - change properties for the different
11:27 - colors and you can also use the
11:28 - trackball switch I like to do I'm gonna
11:30 - give it a bit of red in the high end
11:32 - here some more green in the mid and some
11:34 - blue in the darks if you right-click one
11:37 - of these it's going to reset it we also
11:38 - have a curves adjustment here if you
11:40 - want to go in here you can add keys in
11:42 - order to bump up say the brightness here
11:44 - and maybe decrease it a bit on the low
11:46 - end we can go in and select another
11:48 - channel say the red channel here add a
11:50 - key here and you can change that around
11:52 - as well so it's really easy to do color
11:55 - adjustments in here I'm satisfied with
11:57 - the look of this you can see what it
11:58 - looks like before and after instead of
12:01 - doing the color grading in the engine
12:02 - itself you can also use the use a lot
12:05 - lot stands for lookup texture it's an
12:07 - optimized way of performing color
12:08 - grading because you grade your image
12:10 - beforehand in another program such as
12:12 - Photoshop and then export the color data
12:14 - into a lot that is then read by unity if
12:16 - that's something you want to use you put
12:18 - in the texture here and you can also
12:19 - adjust the blending factor here but
12:22 - we'll just be using the building color
12:23 - grading then we have some of the more
12:24 - niche artistic effects the first one is
12:26 - chromatic aberration this filter
12:28 - stimulates chromatic distortions at the
12:30 - edges of the screen chromatic aberration
12:32 - is often seen in lower quality camera
12:35 - lenses if we enable this and bump up the
12:37 - intensity we can immediately see the
12:39 - effects actually they think it's pretty
12:40 - cool to have in here but this is way too
12:42 - much let's leave it at around 0.15 you
12:45 - can also set a spectral texture which is
12:47 - going to shift the hue of the chromatic
12:48 - aberration by default it generates one
12:50 - for you but there also some available
12:52 - under textures spectral lots and we can
12:55 - just try out one of the other ones here
12:56 - say the blue red we bump up the
12:58 - intensity now you can see that looks a
12:59 - bit different I actually like this one
13:01 - even better but then of grain this
13:03 - affects some the adds a layer of grain
13:04 - to simulate filmic noise let's enable
13:06 - that I don't think this particularly
13:08 - suits our scene here but we have an
13:10 - intensity slider we have the size of the
13:12 - grains and how much they should be
13:14 - affected by the luminance of our scene
13:16 - you can also choose whether or not you
13:17 - want them to have color I'm just gonna
13:18 - disable this 4rc
13:20 - we have a vignette a vignette can be
13:22 - used to darken the edges and corners of
13:24 - an image this is often visible when
13:25 - lenses assumed in and can be used to
13:27 - great dramatic effect if we enable this
13:29 - we can see that by the default the
13:31 - effect is pretty strong I definitely
13:33 - like this far as seen because it helps
13:35 - draw attention to whatever is in the
13:36 - center but I think we should decrease it
13:38 - a little bit we're gonna just stuff like
13:39 - the center point the color of the
13:41 - vignette the smoothness the roundness
13:43 - which is easier to see if we go ahead
13:44 - and bump up the intensity and you can
13:46 - choose whether or not you want this to
13:47 - be rounded that means should it be
13:49 - completely circular or should it be kind
13:50 - of adjusted to fit the aspect ratio of
13:52 - our screen and see that on and off here
13:55 - you can also change the mode from
13:56 - classic to masked and this allows you to
13:58 - input your own black and white texture
14:00 - to use as the vignette this can be cool
14:02 - if you want to do stuff like dirt or
14:03 - blood on your screen I'm just gonna go
14:05 - with classic and I want to bump down the
14:07 - smoothness a tiny bit but also increase
14:09 - the intensity so I like that a lot
14:10 - finally we have dithering dithering is
14:12 - the process of reducing banding in
14:14 - gradient areas by introducing some
14:16 - controlled noise to the image we won't
14:18 - be using this effect here but here's an
14:20 - example of an image with and without
14:21 - diddling so that concludes all of the
14:23 - different image effects that you can
14:25 - apply to your game if we go ahead and
14:27 - hit play now we can see the effects of
14:28 - these as the game is running and if we
14:30 - select our main camera we can see what
14:31 - it looks like with and without so really
14:33 - a huge bump up in quality just by
14:35 - adjusting a few knots that's pretty much
14:37 - it for this video I hope you enjoyed it
14:38 - if you did make sure to subscribe so you
14:40 - don't miss your future video also to
14:42 - those of you interested in skill share
14:43 - click the link in the description I
