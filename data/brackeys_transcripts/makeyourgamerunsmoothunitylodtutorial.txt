00:00 - when making levels you of course want
00:01 - them to be as detailed as possible but
00:03 - just throwing a bunch of high quality
00:04 - models into a scene is not very
00:06 - performant especially if your scene is
00:09 - fairly large of course it makes sense
00:10 - for the models to be detailed when
00:12 - viewed up close but for objects far away
00:14 - this detail isn't very important this is
00:17 - where level of detail or LOD comes in
00:20 - here we basically create multiple
00:21 - versions of each model at varying
00:24 - quality and then swapping the right
00:25 - version depending on the view distance
00:27 - if done correctly this can be pretty
00:29 - much unnoticeable and make this scene a
00:31 - lot easier to render the cool thing
00:32 - about setting up lots in unity is that
00:35 - if you organize your assets in a certain
00:37 - way unity will pretty much do everything
00:38 - for you so first we'll go over how to
00:40 - create multiple levels of details for
00:42 - your assets in blender and that will
00:44 - bring everything into unity we go so as
00:47 - you can see I'm here in blender 2.78 and
00:49 - what we're going to be doing today is
00:51 - not particularly advanced but if this is
00:53 - the first time you're opening up blender
00:55 - I suggest you at least check out the
00:56 - first video in our blender basics course
00:58 - all right so first I want to select the
01:00 - camera then hold down shift and like the
01:02 - Sun and cube as well and hit X and press
01:06 - delete so now we have an empty scene of
01:08 - course you can go ahead and create
01:10 - whatever asset you want here but I'm
01:12 - just gonna go and create a monkey so
01:14 - let's say this is the game asset that we
01:16 - want to create multiple versions of well
01:19 - I think first of all we could create a
01:20 - level of detail that is even higher than
01:22 - this one so I'm gonna go to the
01:24 - modifiers and I'm gonna add a new
01:26 - modifier and I'm gonna choose
01:28 - subdivision surface so this adds a lot
01:30 - of subdivisions to our model I'm gonna
01:32 - go ahead and apply these and if we
01:33 - switch into edit mode by hitting tab we
01:36 - can see that there's quite a bit of
01:37 - detail on this model so this represents
01:40 - our base model our model in its highest
01:42 - quality we refer to this as lawd
01:45 - zero so I'm gonna go to the top here and
01:48 - find our model our monkey's name is
01:50 - Susanne that's right it's a girl so we
01:52 - can right-click on Susanne and go rename
01:54 - and we'll right underscore LOD for level
01:57 - of detail and then I'm gonna put a zero
02:00 - here
02:00 - and this is one of those unity specific
02:02 - things that we have to do this exact way
02:05 - judy is going to look for this
02:06 - underscore LOD and then an index and
02:09 - then recognize what it means so we can
02:11 - then go ahead and create alternate
02:13 - version
02:13 - offices and so I'm gonna duplicate her
02:15 - by hitting shift D and I don't want to
02:18 - move her around so I'm just gonna right
02:19 - click to snap her back to original
02:21 - position now this one I'm going to
02:22 - rename to LOD underscore one and I want
02:26 - to go and move this a SAN on to another
02:29 - layer to do that I'm gonna press M and
02:31 - I'm gonna select the second layer here
02:33 - and as you can see down here there are
02:35 - now two different dots on these two
02:37 - layers because there's an object on each
02:39 - one and we can switch between them of
02:41 - course we have the same model on each
02:43 - layer but we are now only viewing one of
02:45 - them at a time and we can always quick
02:47 - switch between layers by using the
02:49 - number keys so now we want to reduce the
02:52 - quality of this model of course the best
02:54 - way to do this is go in by hand and
02:56 - simply remove polygons but this is also
02:59 - very time-consuming often you can get
03:01 - away by simply adding a modifier so
03:03 - we're gonna go add modifier and we're
03:05 - gonna select decimate here we can adjust
03:07 - the ratio and right away you can see
03:09 - that we are slowly compressing our model
03:11 - I'm gonna set this to a value of 0.5 I
03:14 - think that's a fairly decent starting
03:16 - point and then I'm gonna hit shift key
03:18 - once more go to the top and renamed to
03:21 - LOD 2 and again I'm gonna hit em to move
03:24 - it on to another layer and I'm gonna
03:25 - select the third one then I'm gonna
03:27 - press 3 to move to that layer and I'm
03:30 - gonna reduce the ratio even more I think
03:32 - I'm gonna try a value of 0.2 again shift
03:35 - D to duplicate right-click go to the top
03:37 - and rename finally we'll call it LOD 3
03:40 - again move it to the fourth layer hit
03:43 - forward to focus on that layer and this
03:45 - time I'll bump the ratio down to say
03:47 - point 1 so now we should be able to use
03:50 - our number keys in order to see the
03:52 - transition between our different levels
03:54 - of detail of course this level of detail
03:56 - doesn't look too good but remember we'll
03:58 - be viewing it from very very far away
04:00 - and on top of that our model currently
04:03 - uses flat shading if we selected and go
04:06 - to the left here we can hit smooth and
04:08 - that definitely helps hide the
04:09 - subdivisions so I'm gonna do that for
04:11 - each one of our models and I'm also
04:13 - going to go through and apply each one
04:15 - of the modifiers so hit apply on the
04:17 - modifier go to the 3rd layer apply 2nd
04:21 - layer apply and of course our first
04:23 - layer does not have a modifier and that
04:25 - is actually all of this set up
04:27 - that we need to do if you want to
04:28 - preview how many triangle makes up each
04:30 - level of detail step you can see that at
04:32 - the top here so the first one is about
04:35 - 4k the second one is about half of that
04:37 - the third one is under a thousand and
04:39 - the fourth one is just under 400 so now
04:42 - we're ready to export this into unity to
04:44 - do that we'll go file export and we'll
04:46 - select FBX here we can browse to our
04:48 - project folder go under assets and I'm
04:50 - gonna save mine as monkey and let's hit
04:53 - export FBX now when we open up our unity
04:56 - project we can see right away that we
04:58 - have an FBX in here and under it we have
05:00 - the four different levels of detail and
05:02 - this is where unity is just so awesome
05:05 - because if we simply take the parent
05:07 - object here and drag it into the
05:09 - hierarchy right away it sets up
05:11 - everything for us because unity
05:14 - recognizes that this object has multiple
05:16 - sub objects that are all marked with a
05:18 - certain level of detail and so it goes
05:20 - ahead and creates this LOD group now
05:23 - before I show you how cool this is let's
05:24 - go ahead and drag our object up here so
05:26 - we can actually see it let's also look
05:28 - under the object here we can see all of
05:30 - our different levels of detail if we
05:32 - select all of them we can create a
05:34 - material for them so we'll go
05:35 - right-click create material we'll call
05:38 - this material red will set the
05:39 - smoothness to zero I'm gonna set the
05:42 - color here to a nice red and once again
05:44 - I'm gonna select all the objects and
05:46 - drag in the red material and if we then
05:48 - select the parent object it will clearly
05:50 - indicate in the scene view what level of
05:52 - detail we're currently looking at and as
05:54 - I start zooming out you can see this
05:57 - camera here is moving towards the right
05:59 - that's because it's showing us how much
06:01 - space our object is taking up on the
06:04 - screen and as we zoom out it takes up
06:06 - less in there space and in fact if we
06:08 - zoom out just a tiny bit more it's going
06:10 - to switch to LOD one if we zoom out even
06:13 - further LOD two and even further LOD
06:16 - three now we can't actually see this
06:19 - happening and that's of course a good
06:21 - thing if you want to see this happening
06:23 - more clearly we can go and switch to
06:25 - wireframe and here we might be able to
06:27 - see the amount of wires change as the
06:30 - level of detail changes but still that
06:32 - might not be completely clear so just to
06:34 - demonstrate we can go and select each
06:36 - one of our level of details and we can
06:38 - add a separate material to each one so
06:40 - the first
06:40 - here's gonna be red I've gone ahead and
06:42 - prepared a yellow material as well
06:44 - a green material as well as a blue
06:47 - material and now as we zoom out you can
06:49 - see that our object changes color super
06:52 - super cool we can also go ahead and
06:54 - select any one of these Elodie's and the
06:56 - LOD is going to show up down here it's
06:58 - gonna display the amount of renderers
06:59 - and materials as well as the number of
07:01 - triangles so we can go through and see
07:03 - the number of triangles here as well and
07:06 - this is also where you can set up your
07:07 - own renderer so in case we didn't have
07:09 - the right renderer we would go in and
07:10 - remove the one that we have instead he'd
07:12 - add and now we can go ahead and select
07:14 - any object here but of course we want
07:16 - the first one so how does this look
07:18 - within the game view well it looks
07:20 - pretty much the same if I go ahead and
07:22 - take my scene view here and target on my
07:24 - secondary monitor I can try zooming out
07:26 - with the camera and you should be able
07:28 - to see the exact same thing happening
07:30 - awesome that's pretty much it for this
