00:00 - remember guys you should never play with
00:02 - fire except for in unity of course in
00:04 - this video we'll create a fire and smoke
00:06 - effect using visual effect graph at the
00:08 - end you should have something that looks
00:09 - like this and the great thing about
00:11 - doing everything in VFX graph is that
00:13 - it's extremely easy to customize to fit
00:15 - the look of your game and also your
00:17 - vault getting burns also special thanks
00:19 - to friends who are upper and your cannon
00:21 - go alright armand john shannon alexander
00:23 - player and infinity PPR for their
00:25 - support on patreon also this video is
00:27 - sponsored by unity and with that let's
00:29 - make fire so as you can see I've created
00:34 - a fresh unity project now whenever we
00:37 - want to work with visual effect graph we
00:39 - want to make sure that we're using unity
00:41 - 2000 18.3 or later that our project is
00:43 - set up with HDR P and that we have the
00:46 - visual effect package installed in the
00:48 - package manager if you want help setting
00:50 - all this stuff up I recommend you watch
00:52 - our previous video on getting started
00:53 - with ratio effect graph let's of course
00:56 - a link for that in the description now
00:57 - at this point we are ready to start
00:58 - creating some particles I'm gonna go
01:00 - ahead and disable the example assets
01:02 - here and instead I'm gonna go to the
01:04 - project and hit create go into visual
01:06 - effects and select visual effect graph
01:08 - let's call it smoke effect we now see a
01:11 - preview of the effect down here to show
01:13 - it in our scene we can simply drag it
01:15 - into the hierarchy awesome
01:16 - now to edit the effect we can simply
01:18 - double click it in the project panel and
01:20 - it's going to open up in a separate
01:22 - window we can take this window and dark
01:24 - it anywhere we'd like right now I'm just
01:26 - gonna put it next to our scene view here
01:28 - so right now all we see here is the
01:30 - default system which is not very
01:32 - exciting so let's go ahead and configure
01:34 - some of the settings here at the top
01:35 - here we have this spawn rate we should
01:37 - be able to leave this at 10 that should
01:39 - be fine for smoke I do however want to
01:41 - increase the capacity a bit so that we
01:42 - can have more particles at the same time
01:44 - I'm gonna set it to 64 then for the
01:47 - random velocity here I'm just gonna go
01:49 - ahead and change the minimum Y to 0.8
01:53 - I'm also going to adjust the random
01:55 - lifetime to go between 5 and 9
01:58 - this way our particles will live for
02:00 - longer which is typical for an effect
02:02 - like smoke where you want it to kind of
02:04 - flow around in the air before
02:05 - disappearing right now you can also see
02:07 - that all of our particles are pointing
02:09 - in the same direction I think it would
02:11 - be a good idea to randomize this route
02:13 - to give our effect Morphin organic feel
02:15 - so I'm gonna go to the initialized
02:17 - module and hit space to bring up the
02:19 - context aware menu and we want to set
02:21 - the angle of these particles I'm gonna
02:24 - search for a set angle and choose the
02:26 - first one let's also make some space for
02:28 - this so I'm just gonna drag down the
02:29 - other context here for the channel I'm
02:31 - gonna select D so now we can adjust the
02:33 - Z angle by simply changing this
02:35 - parameter right here and you can see for
02:38 - newly instantiated particles they are
02:39 - now rotated by 67 degrees but of course
02:42 - I don't want to define this value I want
02:44 - it to be random so let's go ahead and
02:46 - select this block and now in the
02:48 - inspector we can choose the randomness
02:51 - which is currently set to OFF let's
02:52 - instead set this to per component and
02:55 - we've now changed this block so that we
02:57 - can choose between a minimum and a
02:58 - maximum value so I'm gonna set it
03:00 - between 0 and 360 and you'll now see
03:03 - that each individual particle has a
03:05 - random rotation awesome next up we can
03:08 - go down to the output and the first
03:10 - thing that we can do here is actually
03:11 - just get rid of it because this is
03:14 - currently just a quad output which means
03:16 - that our particles won't be affected by
03:18 - lighting let's hit delete on this and
03:20 - instead let's drag the update down to a
03:22 - not the output which is going to be a
03:24 - lit quad output and as the name suggests
03:27 - this is going to be affected by lighting
03:29 - so let's drag that up here and first of
03:32 - all we want this to use soft particles
03:34 - we also want to set the smoothness to
03:36 - zero and it's now time to define a smoke
03:39 - texture however kony we're just using a
03:41 - single image for each one of our
03:43 - particles which is just the default
03:45 - particle sprite however one thing that
03:47 - would make our smoke look much better is
03:49 - if we don't use just a static image but
03:51 - instead used a bunch of images and
03:53 - combine them to create animation this is
03:56 - what we call texture sheet animation you
03:58 - might have seen it used for characters
04:00 - and it's basically just where you pack a
04:02 - bunch of images into one big texture
04:04 - then show one image at a time quickly
04:06 - after each other to create the animation
04:08 - so the texture that I'm gonna use here
04:10 - is called wispy smoke and if I just
04:12 - bring it up here we can see that it's
04:14 - just a collection of images in fact this
04:17 - texture sheet here has 8 by 8 images if
04:20 - you want to download this and use it as
04:21 - well now of course have a link to it in
04:23 - the description now what we can do is we
04:25 - can tell visual effect
04:27 - that this is a texture sheet and that it
04:29 - split up into an 8x8 grid and the
04:31 - effects graph is then going to take care
04:33 - of everything for us
04:34 - so to do this will change the UV mode
04:37 - from simple to flipbook blend we're
04:40 - gonna see that we get a flipbook size
04:42 - this is going to be 8 on the X and 8 on
04:44 - the Y and for our base color map we'll
04:47 - now simply drag in the wispy smoke now
04:49 - the particles are currently a bit too
04:51 - small to see so let's go ahead and add a
04:52 - multiply size node here and let's just
04:56 - set it to 2 so now it's a bit clearer
04:58 - and as we can see it's not quite working
05:00 - yet the particles aren't animating the
05:03 - reason for this is that we also need to
05:04 - go to the update context and here we
05:07 - need to add a flipbook player what this
05:09 - is going to do is that it's going to
05:10 - update each individual particle over
05:12 - time and we can set a frame rate for
05:14 - this animation here I'm just gonna set
05:17 - it to something like 8 and as you can
05:19 - see the particles now change over time
05:21 - which looks much much better
05:23 - we should probably also make the
05:25 - particles face in the direction of our
05:27 - camera because currently when we rotate
05:29 - around our system while things start to
05:31 - look pretty weird to do this we'll go to
05:33 - a lit chord output hit space and we'll
05:36 - add an oriental ock more specifically we
05:39 - want to orient towards our camera
05:41 - position so we'll select that and the
05:44 - particles will now look the same no
05:45 - matter where we view them from awesome
05:48 - however we definitely still need to play
05:50 - with the size of these particles more
05:52 - specifically it would be nice if we
05:54 - could make it so that the particles grow
05:56 - over time to do this we go to our output
05:58 - node hit space and search for size over
06:01 - life and let's choose the set size over
06:04 - live block let's also take this block
06:06 - and move it above or multiply size block
06:08 - and we now click on the size here to
06:10 - define our own custom curve I'm gonna
06:13 - select from the angled line down here
06:14 - and that already looks much better but I
06:16 - think that the particles are starting
06:18 - quite small so I'm gonna go ahead and
06:20 - increase that to something like 0.5 to
06:23 - give a more natural look and I think
06:24 - it's definitely starting to look like
06:26 - smoke now however one thing that would
06:27 - really help sell the effect is if we
06:29 - added some forces to our particles to do
06:31 - this that's go to update and let's first
06:34 - add a force block we'll set the mode to
06:36 - relative and the velocity to say- point
06:40 - you two point five and zero for the drag
06:44 - we can leave that at one and as you can
06:46 - see because of the drag which is
06:47 - basically air resistance or smoke is
06:50 - starting to clump together a lot more
06:51 - and because we've added this velocity
06:53 - over time it looks like our smoke is
06:55 - slowly being affected by it some kind of
06:57 - wind you can definitely add more
06:59 - randomness to this by using stuff like
07:00 - turbulence but for now I think it's
07:02 - pretty good we can also add even more
07:05 - drag to our particles by adding a
07:06 - separate linear drag block I'm gonna
07:08 - make room for this and the cool thing
07:10 - about this block is that we can set it
07:11 - to use the particles size which means
07:14 - that as our particles grow in size they
07:17 - will be more affected by a drag so we'll
07:19 - definitely want to set that to true and
07:20 - we can set the drag coefficient to
07:22 - something like point 1 now the final
07:24 - thing that we can adjust with our smoke
07:26 - particles and maybe also the most fun is
07:28 - how they're rendered so let's go to a
07:30 - lit called output here and click on it
07:32 - and now in the inspector we get a bunch
07:34 - of settings for this output context on
07:36 - the lighting we can for example set the
07:37 - material type to translucent now this is
07:41 - definitely going to be less performant
07:43 - but it means that we are allowing light
07:45 - to escape through our particles which is
07:47 - really typical for smoke and currently
07:49 - our particles are using both the color
07:51 - value and the Alpha of the texture that
07:54 - we supplied however if you want more
07:56 - control over the look of your particles
07:58 - in the effects graph we can actually set
08:00 - it to only use the alpha part of our
08:02 - based color map this means that right
08:04 - now our particles are completely white
08:06 - because we aren't supplying them with a
08:08 - color but we can then go in here and add
08:09 - blocks that do this for example if we
08:12 - want to change the color over life we
08:14 - can add a block to do that let's hit
08:15 - space let's search for a color over life
08:18 - and let's choose the set color over life
08:20 - block now by default this is going to
08:22 - have a really nice gradient that simply
08:24 - quickly fades the particles in and then
08:26 - slowly fades them out which definitely
08:28 - works for a smoke effect here now you
08:30 - could definitely go crazy with this and
08:32 - add all kinds of colors over the
08:34 - particles lifetime as you can see you
08:35 - can go pretty nuts with this or you
08:37 - could simply leave it white and then
08:39 - combine it with a multiply Colin arrowed
08:41 - which is going to allow us to adjust the
08:44 - color of the entire smoke with just one
08:46 - color parameter so we can make it red or
08:49 - for the case of standard smoke we can
08:52 - make it a dark brown
08:53 - in fact if you want to be able to reuse
08:55 - this particle system to create different
08:57 - kinds of effects around your game then
08:59 - we could create a parameter to control
09:01 - this that we can adjust inside of the
09:03 - inspector to do this let's just hit the
09:05 - plus sign here and let's create a color
09:07 - parameter let's right click and rename
09:10 - it let's just call it color we want to
09:12 - make sure to mark it as exposed let's
09:14 - drag it down here and connect it to our
09:16 - color input and now we can adjust the
09:18 - value from right here or we can go to
09:21 - the individual smoke effect and override
09:23 - it now the last thing that we can do to
09:25 - our particles here to really make them
09:26 - pop and give them more of a
09:28 - three-dimensional effect is to add a
09:30 - normal map to do this we want to select
09:32 - our output context and under used normal
09:35 - map we want to set that to true this
09:37 - will give us a texture input here for a
09:39 - normal map and I'm simply going to drag
09:41 - that in and right away we can see that
09:43 - our smoke looks way more 3-dimensional
09:45 - now let's add a point light to the
09:47 - bottom of our smoke effects let's right
09:49 - click on it go light and create a point
09:51 - light and this is both going to create
09:53 - the illusion that there is some fire at
09:54 - the bottom of our smoke and it's also
09:56 - going to create a really nice lighting
09:58 - effect up through our smoke we're gonna
10:00 - adjust the color of this I'm gonna
10:01 - tinned it a bit more orange now we can
10:03 - also increase the intensity to say 700
10:06 - lumen that already looks much better if
10:08 - we can also go in and play with the
10:09 - gradient here I think currently it's
10:11 - getting a bit dark towards the end so
10:13 - I'm gonna simply take the color here and
10:15 - make it wider and the cool thing is that
10:16 - since we made our color a parameter we
10:18 - can then take the smoke effect and
10:20 - duplicate it and move it over and let's
10:23 - say that we want this one to be ordinary
10:24 - smoke but we want this one to be an
10:26 - emergency flare so we can go in here and
10:28 - make it kind of a light red for an
10:31 - emergency's flare look we'd also make it
10:33 - green for another kind of look and you
10:36 - can see just how easily we can change
10:37 - this effect to give it a different
10:39 - visual appearance if we make it
10:41 - completely white it looks like steam and
10:43 - if we make it really dark it looks like
10:44 - we're burning something that is not
10:46 - supposed to burn so from here sweetie up
10:48 - to you to use these same techniques to
10:50 - tweak the effect and add more detail you
10:52 - could for example create an extra system
10:54 - that also uses an image sequence to make
10:56 - flames at the bottom of the smoke you
10:58 - could create another system that makes
11:00 - flying sparks or Emperors in fact then
11:02 - we really quickly show you how to go
11:04 - about doing that so in the same smoke
11:05 - effect here we can actually
11:07 - a separate system so I'm gonna hit space
11:09 - let's create a swarm particle system and
11:12 - this is definitely not what we're going
11:14 - for so let's adjust this a bit we'll set
11:15 - the spawn rate to 10 the capacity to a
11:18 - hundred we still wanted to spawn in a
11:20 - sphere but let's set the radius of the
11:22 - sphere to 0.2 I'm just going to zoom in
11:24 - a bit so you can see it more clearly
11:25 - let's set the lifetime between 2 and 4
11:28 - inside the update here we can remove the
11:30 - vector field force instead we can go
11:32 - over to the left here and copy the set
11:34 - velocity random from our other smoke
11:37 - system and simply paste that into a new
11:38 - system here I'm gonna make a bit of room
11:40 - and I'm gonna make it a bit widest let's
11:42 - make it go between minus 0.5 and 0.5 for
11:45 - both X and Z we know sir go ahead and
11:48 - copy both the force and the linear
11:50 - dragged into the update of our new
11:52 - system this way it's going to follow the
11:55 - overall direction of our smoke inside of
11:57 - our output here we can go ahead and
11:59 - create a multiply color node and if we
12:02 - click on this we can of course change
12:04 - the colors of our particles but we can
12:06 - also adjust their intensity if we
12:08 - increase this intensity we can see that
12:09 - we can make them glow which is really
12:11 - nice for stuff like embers here let's
12:13 - also set the size to 0.25 and finally we
12:16 - can add a tiny bit of turbulence to
12:18 - these particles to give them randomness
12:20 - to that we go to the update
12:22 - that's it space search for turbulence we
12:24 - want to change the mode to absolute this
12:27 - way the turbulence is going to ignore
12:28 - any kind of drag and right now all the
12:30 - particles have the same turbulence
12:32 - that's because we need to go under field
12:34 - transform and adjust the position of the
12:36 - turbulence noise and we'll adjust it
12:38 - over time so let's go ahead and add a
12:40 - time node we'll select total time and
12:43 - let's drag this on to our position so
12:45 - now over time we're going to change the
12:47 - position of the turbulence and you can
12:49 - see now that the particles are indeed
12:50 - changing direction over time and we can
12:53 - simply decrease the intensity on this so
12:54 - let's set it to something like point 4
12:56 - and that's it we've now really really
12:58 - quickly by simply using a lot of the
13:00 - same techniques added flying embers to
13:03 - our smoke which definitely helps give it
13:05 - some nice detail yay that's pretty much
13:08 - it for this video if you enjoyed it
13:09 - makes us subscribe and also ring that
13:11 - notification bell so you don't miss the
13:12 - next one also definitely let me know if
13:14 - there are any other effects that you
13:15 - would like to learn how to make using
13:17 - visual effect graph and just letting you
13:19 - know that there won't be a
13:20 - video next week since we're taking a bit
13:22 - of vacation time at the office will of
