00:00 - so a while back we did a video on how to
00:01 - get good-looking Graphics in unity but
00:04 - since then there's been some major
00:05 - changes to how we work with Graphics in
00:07 - unity and at the center of these changes
00:09 - is a brand new rendering engine it's
00:12 - called the scriptable render pipeline or
00:14 - SRP for short SRP allows us to either
00:17 - choose a pre-made rendering pipeline
00:19 - provided by unity or to write our own C
00:22 - code to customize how things are
00:23 - rendered because SRP is so modular it
00:26 - can both be used for games that should
00:27 - run on lower-end devices and for games
00:29 - that Target AAA Hardware in this video
00:32 - we'll be working with hdrp or the
00:34 - highdefinition render pipeline we use
00:36 - hdrp whenever we want to achieve optimal
00:39 - rendering quality so in this video we'll
00:41 - turn this horrible looking scene into
00:43 - this just using hdrp also this video is
00:46 - sponsored by unity now before we get
00:48 - into it we've been working on some new
00:50 - designs for line of code and they are
00:53 - finally here woohoo
00:55 - wooho we work together with Blackthorn
00:58 - prod who is just an amazing art artist
01:00 - and game developer to create these four
01:02 - cool looking shirts I think my personal
01:04 - favorite is the hard one it's just so
01:06 - cute but that is not all we also have
01:08 - this really cool new design by Thea and
01:11 - a new game Jam one in collaboration with
01:13 - mm and on top of that we've gotten a lot
01:15 - of requests to bring these designs onto
01:17 - female fitted shirts so we've of course
01:20 - gone ahead and done that as well so
01:22 - simply visit lineof code. and use the
01:24 - coupon code shirt me up to get 10% off
01:27 - for the first week also if you're like
01:29 - me and absolutely love everything that
01:31 - black thornn Pro does he does have his
01:33 - own YouTube channel and it's even on em
01:36 - me with some beginner courses also
01:38 - before we get started special thanks to
01:39 - Jack jubert Andrew Keno John Shannon and
01:42 - infinity PPR for their support on Patron
01:44 - all right let's jump into the video so
01:46 - as you can see I've gone ahead and set
01:47 - up this simple example scene in here we
01:50 - have some models from the Mayan timble
01:52 - pack I'll of course have a link to where
01:53 - you can download these in the
01:54 - description I've also gone ahead and set
01:56 - up a few lights we have two directional
01:58 - lights as well as a few Point lights
02:00 - scattered around the scene and finally
02:02 - we have this door light which is just an
02:04 - emissive material also if I go ahead and
02:06 - hit play you will notice that the
02:09 - camera what the also if you go ahead and
02:11 - hit play you will notice that the camera
02:13 - rotates around our scene that's because
02:15 - I've gone ahead and created a turntable
02:17 - object here that has a script on it that
02:19 - will simply rotate the camera over time
02:21 - but of course currently our scene is
02:23 - looking really Bland so let's go ahead
02:26 - and modify it to make it look better the
02:28 - first thing we want to do is make sure
02:29 - that we have the hdrp package installed
02:32 - so we'll go to window and open up the
02:35 - package manager and as you can see I
02:37 - already have the high definition render
02:39 - pipeline here if you don't see it on the
02:40 - list make sure to go under Advanced and
02:42 - check Show preview packages simply find
02:45 - the package and install and updated I'm
02:48 - using version 4.9 and with that we're
02:51 - ready to start setting up hdrp and the
02:54 - first thing that we need to do is
02:55 - creating a render pipeline asset so
02:58 - we'll go to the project and right click
03:00 - we'll go create let's go under rendering
03:03 - and select high definition render
03:05 - pipeline asset let's just call this hdrp
03:08 - and with this asset selected we will get
03:10 - a bunch of rendering settings more
03:13 - specifically we get to choose what
03:14 - features we want to include in our
03:16 - render pipeline in here we have options
03:19 - for screen space ambient occlusion
03:21 - subsurface scattering volumetrics and so
03:24 - on for now we'll just leave these as is
03:26 - we then need to assign or render
03:28 - pipeline asset to our project to do that
03:30 - we'll go edit project settings and go
03:33 - under graphics and here you can see we
03:35 - have an empty slot for a render pipeline
03:37 - asset so let's go ahead and drag in our
03:40 - new asset and voila our project is now
03:43 - using hdrp however if we look in the
03:45 - game view we can see that we still have
03:47 - a few steps to go the first thing that
03:49 - we need to do is go to player go under
03:52 - other settings and rendering and here
03:55 - will change the color space from gamma
03:57 - to linear the color space determines the
04:00 - math used by unity when mixing colors in
04:02 - lighting calculations or reading values
04:05 - from textures changing the color space
04:07 - can have a drastic effect on the realism
04:09 - of your game a big advantage of using a
04:11 - linear color space is that the color
04:13 - supplied to shaders will brighten
04:15 - linearly as light intensity increases
04:17 - with the alternative gamma color space
04:19 - brightness will quickly begin to turn to
04:21 - wide as values go up which often leads
04:23 - to a very washed out looks so in other
04:25 - words for more lighting Fidelity we
04:26 - choose linear color space of course we
04:29 - can't really see has changed yet because
04:30 - all of our materials are currently
04:32 - appearing in this weird purple color the
04:35 - reason for this is that we need to
04:36 - update our materials to use an hdrp
04:38 - Shader so let's close down our project
04:41 - settings and let's find one of the
04:42 - materials in our scene I have a folder
04:45 - with mine here and I'm just going to
04:46 - select one of them and as you can see
04:48 - it's currently set to use the standard
04:50 - Shader so let's click on this let's go
04:52 - under hdrp and let's choose the lit
04:55 - Shader and right away we can see that
04:57 - all objects with this material assigned
04:59 - appear in our scene you could of course
05:01 - go through all materials in your project
05:03 - and update them one by one but if you
05:06 - have hundreds of materials that might
05:07 - take quite a bit of time luckily Unity
05:10 - has put in an option for exactly this if
05:13 - we go to edit render pipeline there's an
05:16 - option here to upgrade project materials
05:18 - to high definition materials let's
05:20 - simply click that let's hit proceed and
05:22 - voila it's gone ahead and change the
05:24 - Shader for each one of our materials
05:26 - awesome so the next step is to update
05:28 - all live to look good with hdrp so I'll
05:32 - go ahead and navigate to my lights here
05:34 - and let's go ahead and first disable all
05:36 - lights except our main light if we
05:39 - select this light we get a bunch of
05:40 - settings that allows us to configure it
05:42 - I'm going to go ahead and set the
05:43 - intensity of the light to three locks
05:45 - and I'll leave all the other settings as
05:47 - is now we can reenable all of our other
05:50 - lights and you'll see that we get this
05:52 - error in the console it says that
05:54 - Cascade Shadow atlasing has failed only
05:57 - one directional light can cast Shadows
05:59 - added time and this is a rule for hdrp
06:02 - but currently I have two directional
06:04 - lights the main light and the rim light
06:07 - and the rim light is also set to cast
06:09 - Shadows so I'm going to select it and go
06:12 - to shadows and simply disable Shadow
06:15 - Maps if we then clear our console we can
06:17 - see that the aror disappears and we now
06:20 - also have nice looking shadows in our
06:22 - scene I'll set the intensity of this
06:23 - light to three locks as well I'm also
06:25 - going to select all of our Point lights
06:28 - and set their intensity to 2,000 Lumen
06:31 - that definitely helps and brightens up
06:32 - the scene a lot so once we're happy with
06:34 - our lights we are ready to start
06:36 - configuring scene settings and to do
06:38 - this with hdrp we basically create an
06:41 - object with a volume settings component
06:44 - so inside of our hierarchy let's go
06:45 - create let's go under rendering and
06:47 - let's select the scene settings as you
06:50 - can see this creates an object called
06:51 - scene settings with a volume component
06:54 - and this component has a bunch of
06:56 - different settings let's go through this
06:58 - one by one so the first one is our HD
07:01 - Shadow settings this is of course
07:03 - responsible for showing high quality
07:05 - Shadows the main thing that we can
07:06 - modify here is the max distance which
07:09 - defines how far away we want to draw
07:11 - Shadows you can see if I set this to
07:13 - something like 40 it's only going to
07:15 - draw Shadows up to 40 units and then
07:18 - stop I'm just going to leave mine at 500
07:21 - next up we have the visual environment
07:23 - and this is where we choose two key
07:25 - Parts about our scene we choose what
07:28 - kind of Sky we want to use and what kind
07:30 - of fog we want to use as you can see if
07:33 - I disable this we just get a completely
07:35 - black environment with no fog or sky so
07:38 - for the Skype we have three different
07:40 - types we have a procedural sky this is
07:43 - generated to fit the scene and reacts to
07:46 - lighting changes in our scene this is
07:48 - the one that we're going to be using we
07:50 - also have an hdri sky this allows us to
07:53 - specify an hdri map which is basically
07:56 - just a very large texture for your sky
07:59 - finally we have gradient Sky which
08:01 - allows us to create a sky based on three
08:03 - colors so for now we'll leave this at
08:05 - procedural sky and you'll notice that we
08:07 - also have this procedur Sky module here
08:10 - where if we open this we can configure
08:12 - settings for our Sky I'm going to go
08:14 - ahead and disable the sun disc since I
08:16 - don't want any sun appearing in my
08:18 - environment we can also adjust the sky
08:20 - tint we could for example tinted red or
08:23 - any other color that you'd like I'd
08:25 - actually like to tint mine a tiny bit
08:27 - red we can adjust the ground color here
08:30 - let's for example make that blue we also
08:32 - have an option for exposure and so on so
08:35 - once you're happy with your Sky we can
08:36 - collapse this and next up is the fog
08:39 - type here we can choose between the
08:41 - default exponential fog we also have a
08:44 - linear fog and something exclusive to
08:47 - hdrp which is the volumetric fog this
08:50 - one is super cool let's go ahead and
08:52 - choose this right away you can see that
08:54 - our scene becomes black that's because
08:57 - we need to go ahead and remove our
08:59 - exponential fog here and instead we want
09:01 - to add another component override and
09:04 - here we choose the volumetric fog and
09:07 - for this we'll go ahead and change the
09:09 - base fog distance so I'm going to select
09:11 - that here and let's go ahead and update
09:13 - it to something like 80 we can also go
09:15 - in here and change the base height let's
09:18 - set that to one and the mean height
09:20 - let's set that to
09:22 - 4.5 and as you can see we are now seeing
09:25 - volumetric Lighting in our scene each
09:28 - one of our Point lights are now visible
09:31 - from within our scene you can see their
09:33 - Origins and if we go into the scene view
09:35 - we can see that really clearly around
09:37 - each point light we are seeing the light
09:39 - react to the fog in our scene and we can
09:42 - even start to see God Ray like shadows
09:45 - in our environment really really cool
09:48 - and just like with anything else we can
09:50 - of course change the color of this so if
09:52 - we go to the single scattering albo here
09:55 - we can even adjust the color of our fog
09:59 - so I'm going to set mine to this bluish
10:01 - color here I just think that looks
10:03 - really cool so the next thing that we
10:05 - can configure is our quality settings to
10:08 - do this we'll go to edit we'll open up
10:10 - our project settings once again we'll go
10:12 - under quality and here we have some
10:14 - different quality levels let's go ahead
10:16 - and bump this one up to ultra and you
10:18 - can see the most important thing that
10:20 - changed here was that our textures
10:22 - started to look much better that's
10:24 - because our texture quality is now set
10:26 - to full resolution and isotropic
10:28 - textures is now set to forced on which
10:30 - compared to per texture will avoid read
10:33 - stretching and blurring for your
10:35 - textures so that already looks much
10:37 - better the final big thing that we can
10:39 - add to our scene to really help tie
10:41 - everything together is of course post
10:43 - processing to add post processing to our
10:45 - scene we'll go to the hierarchy let's
10:47 - right click and create an empty object
10:49 - let's just reset the Transformer on this
10:51 - and let's call it post processing and
10:55 - here we want to add a post process
10:58 - volume
10:59 - let's set this to Global to make it
11:01 - affect our entire scene and we'll also
11:03 - go ahead and add a new profile where we
11:06 - can add effects to our volume in order
11:08 - to enable postprocessing we also need to
11:10 - find our camera and on here we need to
11:12 - add a postprocess layer component and on
11:15 - this component we need to choose what
11:17 - layers to search for postprocessing in
11:20 - so by default this is set to default
11:22 - let's go ahead and add a new layer
11:24 - called post processing let's select our
11:28 - post processing object and assign it
11:30 - this layer and let's go to our main
11:31 - camera and choose this layer also when
11:34 - we already have the main camera selected
11:37 - we can go ahead and add some
11:38 - anti-aliasing so anti-aliasing is the
11:41 - process of reducing Jagged edges it adds
11:44 - interpolation to try and smooth out
11:46 - stair step like lines and we have
11:49 - multiple modes to choose for this which
11:51 - one to choose depends on the result
11:53 - you're after I really recommend you
11:55 - experiment with these for your game in
11:57 - my case here I'm going to go ahead and
11:58 - select smaa and now if we go to our
12:01 - postprocessing object we can start
12:03 - adding effects so on this volume we can
12:06 - add all kinds of postprocessing effects
12:08 - to change the appearance of our game I'm
12:10 - not going to go in depth with each of
12:11 - these effects in this video but I'd love
12:13 - to do a dedicated video on it in the
12:15 - future but there's definitely one effect
12:17 - that I'd like to add here and that is
12:19 - color grading because one thing that is
12:21 - important to understand is the tone
12:24 - mapper so when using hdrp our cameras
12:27 - are automatically rendering in HD r or
12:29 - high dynamic range HDR allows us to
12:32 - store color data with much greater
12:33 - Precision which means that we won't lose
12:36 - detail in very bright or dark areas in
12:38 - other words bright things can be really
12:40 - bright dark things can be really dark
12:43 - and the details can be seen in both
12:45 - however we still have to Define how all
12:47 - this extra color data should be
12:48 - displayed on screen this is where tone
12:51 - mapping comes in we can either choose to
12:53 - configure the tone MPP ourselves or
12:55 - choose from a preset to do that we go
12:58 - under tone m mapping here enable that
13:00 - and as you can see there are two presets
13:02 - here and custom the neutral tone mapper
13:05 - as the name suggests gives a very
13:07 - neutral look with minimal impact on
13:09 - color Hue and saturation the aces tone
13:12 - mapper is more filmic and will produce a
13:15 - much more contrasted look as you can see
13:17 - here in my case here I'm going to go
13:19 - ahead and set it to Asus since I really
13:21 - like the look that this gives are seen
13:23 - I'm also going to go under tone and set
13:26 - the post exposure to one just to
13:29 - brighten the scene up a bit the next
13:30 - effect that I'd like to add is a bloom
13:33 - so I'm going to go under here and add a
13:35 - bloom postprocessing effect I'm also
13:37 - going to go in here and increase the
13:39 - intensity and as you can see this is
13:40 - going to add glow to Bright areas this
13:43 - is especially important for our emissive
13:46 - material if we go under the lights here
13:48 - and select the door light as you can see
13:50 - I have this glow material applied and
13:53 - under emission here we can configure the
13:55 - intensity of this emission so I'm going
13:57 - to go ahead and increase this and I'm
13:59 - also going to Tin it in a cool color
14:02 - like blue of course this is currently
14:04 - way too strong so let's go to our
14:06 - postprocessing and decrease the
14:07 - intensity there we go I think that looks
14:10 - really cool also think this thing could
14:12 - use a Viet so I'm going to go and add
14:15 - that as well again I'm going to override
14:17 - the intensity here and increase that a
14:19 - bit and finally because our scene is
14:22 - moving let's go in and add some motion
14:24 - blur and I think the default settings
14:26 - will work fine for this so if we now hit
14:29 - play we can see that we have a much much
14:31 - nicer looking scene and it's just by
14:34 - changing a few settings in unity awesome
14:37 - finally a really cool thing that I want
14:38 - to show you is the render pipeline debug
14:40 - window so if you go to window analysis
14:44 - and choose render pipeline debug we get
14:46 - this new separate window and we can use
14:49 - this to display all kinds of really cool
14:50 - information about lighting materials and
14:52 - rendering if for example we go under
14:54 - lighting here you can see that we have
14:56 - an option called lighting debug mode if
14:58 - if I go in here and change this to
15:00 - diffused lighting it's only going to
15:02 - show the diffused lighting happening in
15:04 - our scene we can do the same thing for
15:07 - specular lighting and many more if we
15:09 - set this To None we can also go in and
15:12 - override properties for our materials we
15:15 - could for example override the albo for
15:17 - all of our materials which means that we
15:19 - can just give all our materials a single
15:21 - color this is really cool because if we
15:22 - choose a neutral color like gray here we
15:24 - can see how lighting is affecting our
15:27 - scene without having to look at all the
15:29 - textures in fact we can also override
15:31 - other properties like smoothness if we
15:34 - want to see how our scene looks when
15:36 - it's really shiny I don't know when you
15:38 - would use this one but it's really cool
15:40 - so I definitely recommend that you check
15:41 - in with this debug window while you're
15:43 - building your scene to make sure that
15:45 - everything is looking good that's pretty
15:46 - much it for this video of course there
15:48 - is so much more to hdrp than what can be
15:51 - crammed into a single video from
15:53 - subsurface scattering to Reflections but
15:55 - hopefully you should now have a place to
15:57 - start exploring and and if you want to
15:59 - learn more about hdrp we'll of course
16:00 - have a link for that in the description
16:02 - also make sure to check out line of code
