00:00 - thanks for tuning in at
00:02 - braies hello everyone and welcome to
00:04 - this video on creating a tower defense
00:06 - game in unity today we're going to be
00:07 - creating a pause menu for our game not
00:10 - really much to say about that so let's
00:12 - just jump right into it so as you can
00:14 - see I'm here in unity and what I want to
00:15 - begin with is kind of sketching out the
00:17 - UI so let's find our overlay canvas and
00:20 - have a look at what we have in here we
00:21 - currently have our shop which sits at
00:23 - the bottom of our screen and the game
00:25 - over menu that we switch on and off as
00:28 - the game continues and I thought we
00:30 - should go ahead and create our pause
00:31 - menu in kind of the same style as the
00:33 - game over menu uses so what you could do
00:36 - is just duplicate the game over menu and
00:38 - modify to suit our needs or we could
00:40 - quickly recreate it let's do that
00:42 - because not everyone has watched the
00:43 - game over tutorial so let's just go
00:45 - right click UI and create a new panel
00:49 - and we basically just want to choose
00:51 - none for the source image so we can get
00:53 - rid of those roundings in the edges and
00:56 - this allows us to Simply choose a color
00:58 - and we can go ahead and choose the same
01:00 - color as the background image for our
01:02 - game over menu so let's actually just
01:05 - copy this entire image component and
01:07 - past it over
01:09 - here
01:10 - cool then what we want is are some
01:13 - buttons and we of course have some
01:15 - buttons inside of our game over menu and
01:19 - I'm actually just going to take one of
01:20 - these buttons copy it over here and just
01:23 - copy the main uh the menu button and
01:26 - just have a look at some of the settings
01:27 - so the image here we have again no
01:30 - Source image the color is completely
01:32 - white everything else is pretty much
01:33 - default values and we don't want this on
01:35 - click event and we can delete the canvas
01:37 - group so this is pretty much just a
01:39 - standard button and then if we look at
01:41 - the text you can see that we've put in
01:43 - menu here we have robotto Medium as the
01:46 - font the font size is at 40 and the
01:48 - color is kind of the same color as our
01:51 - background elements so you can just copy
01:53 - the hex here if you want to and all of
01:55 - the other settings so um now I've showed
01:57 - you uh those we can kind of continue
02:00 - here so let's move this to the center of
02:02 - our screen maybe a bit down and let's
02:04 - kind of widen it to fill up a bit more
02:08 - something like that looks pretty nice
02:09 - and let's go and write continue here
02:11 - instead so if we press this button of
02:13 - course the uh pause menu is going to
02:15 - disappear and we can continue with our
02:17 - game Let's also rename the game object
02:20 - itself to
02:22 - continue and everything else seems fine
02:24 - for now so let's now drag this to be a
02:27 - child of the panel that we created and
02:28 - let's rename our panel two pause menu
02:32 - now we can duplicate our continue button
02:35 - and what I basically want to do is
02:36 - create two buttons that are side by side
02:39 - here uh one for restarting and one for
02:42 - quitting and you could just do that like
02:44 - I did here but moving and positioning
02:47 - them uh individually but what I would
02:50 - rather do is uh whoops I went back a
02:53 - step too far there is create an empty
02:56 - object and we can kind of scale this to
02:59 - the side of our continue button and then
03:01 - move it down and this is going to just
03:03 - be a simple horizontal layout group so
03:08 - now we can take a few buttons say our
03:10 - first continue button here and the
03:11 - second one and you can see it scales it
03:13 - automatic for us however we need a bit
03:16 - of spacing so let's just bump our
03:18 - spacing up to say 8 pixels and I think
03:20 - that looks pretty great so we can call
03:23 - this one our two buttons and then we can
03:26 - call the first button
03:28 - retry and the second button we'll call
03:31 - this one menu and of course we need need
03:33 - to change the text elements as well so
03:36 - this one's going to say retry not retray
03:39 - and this one is going to say menu cool
03:43 - yeah so pretty simple UI but it does the
03:47 - job uh so what we can do further here is
03:50 - maybe just add a bit of contest uh
03:52 - context text up here which is probably
03:56 - just going to say PA so let's just
03:58 - create one big text element and again we
04:01 - can just copy our game over text from
04:03 - the game over menu here and let's have a
04:06 - look at some of the settings we have a
04:07 - font size of 85 the font itself is
04:10 - robotto medium I think we could easily
04:12 - change this to robotto bold and
04:15 - everything else is like this we have a
04:16 - bit of shadowing we can delete the
04:18 - canvas group and yeah that's it and then
04:21 - we can change the text here to um
04:25 - PST cool and what I want to do is kind
04:29 - of scale this in to be the same width of
04:31 - our buttons move it down until it kind
04:34 - of sits on top of them and let's maybe
04:37 - instead of having a fixed font size
04:39 - let's make this a best fit and that
04:41 - means that it will scale between these
04:43 - two sizes to fit uh this size as best as
04:48 - uh it possibly
04:50 - can and uh we can maybe widen this a
04:53 - tiny bit and you can see that it
04:55 - actually goes above 100 here so let's
04:57 - widen this to
04:58 - 130 and uh now we can take this a bit
05:02 - back there we go just to kind of make it
05:04 - the same WID as our buttons you could
05:06 - put a fixed font size in there or you
05:08 - could have it scal
05:10 - automatically let's also rename this
05:12 - object to P text and now I think if we
05:17 - just move these elements up a bit we're
05:19 - pretty much ready to make this an
05:21 - interactive menu so the first thing that
05:24 - we want to do is of course disable the
05:25 - menu itself this way we can enable it
05:28 - when we want to inside the game then we
05:31 - want to create a script and let's make
05:33 - this a script that sits on the game
05:34 - master because our game master is
05:36 - responsible for changing states in the
05:38 - game it's responsible for uh keeping
05:41 - track of important things as What wave
05:43 - we are on and what we should build so
05:45 - let's also have this pause our game and
05:49 - uh basically we're just going to create
05:51 - a script here
05:52 - called called pause menu let's do that
05:55 - so hit create an ad there and let's
05:56 - double click that to open it up in
05:58 - Visual Studio and that's just going to
06:00 - take a second to load here and it's
06:02 - going to pop up on my secondary monitor
06:04 - but I can quickly drag it over there we
06:08 - go um so what I want in here is
06:10 - basically a way for us to register if
06:13 - the user has pressed the Escape key I
06:16 - think the Escape key is going to be the
06:17 - only button that is going to tole
06:20 - actually we could add the p in there as
06:22 - well that's a very popular uh key for
06:24 - well pausing the game so let's create a
06:26 - update method and this can be used for
06:29 - checking for input so let's go if
06:32 - input. get key down and then we want to
06:35 - check for the key code. Escape key or
06:41 - and we use the two vertical bars here or
06:43 - in case we get the key down key code Dot
06:48 - and then we use P for
06:51 - pause awesome and in case this happens
06:53 - what we want to do is we want to call
06:55 - some kind of method called toggle where
06:58 - we will tole the pause menu either on or
07:01 - off depending on what it's already set
07:03 - to so we'll just invert its current
07:06 - state and we can delete the system.
07:08 - collections up here and we can go ahead
07:09 - and create this tarle
07:12 - method so at the moment we actually
07:15 - already have a bit of functionality for
07:18 - um kind of stopping our Mouse movement
07:21 - if you were uh remember when we
07:23 - implemented our camera controller here
07:26 - we made it so that if we pressed Escape
07:28 - we could disable that so right now I'm
07:30 - trying to move but it won't and then I
07:32 - hit escape again and we can move around
07:35 - once more so in order to kind of get rid
07:37 - of this code we got to go into the uh
07:40 - main camera under the camera controller
07:42 - and delete the variable called do
07:44 - movement and we also need to delete
07:48 - these two lines or these four lines uh
07:51 - that takes care of uh actually
07:53 - implementing that into the update Loop
07:55 - so now we can have this stuff only um
07:58 - kind of act in inside of our pause menu
08:00 - and uh not have two different things
08:03 - happen when we press Escape in this
08:05 - different
08:06 - places so basically what we want to do
08:08 - inside of the toggle here is we want to
08:11 - enable some kind of UI or disable it so
08:14 - we need a reference to that UI and in
08:16 - order to do that we'll just create a
08:18 - public game object up here called the UI
08:22 - and then down here we'll simply do ui.
08:25 - set active and we could either put true
08:27 - here if we want to enable it or false if
08:30 - we want to disable it and we just want
08:33 - to do the opposite so we want to flip it
08:36 - so we can get the current uh state of
08:38 - the UI by saying UI do um active self
08:43 - and this is going to be true if the uh
08:45 - game object is enabled and not true uh
08:48 - if it's disabled so we can just do the
08:50 - inverse of this by putting an
08:53 - exformation Mark here so in case it's
08:54 - enabled it's going to flip this to say
08:57 - false and then we're going to set it
08:58 - active false which means we're going to
09:00 - disable it so that's a pretty clever
09:02 - little piece of code but it's very
09:04 - efficient and uh totally easy to uh use
09:07 - I mean you save a lot of space by doing
09:09 - it this way instead of going if already
09:11 - enabled do this if not do that that I
09:15 - mean it essentially accomplishes the
09:18 - same thing and I don't think there's
09:20 - much difference performance- wise but
09:22 - this is just a lot
09:23 - cleaner so then we can go and say
09:27 - um uh and now we actually want to have
09:30 - an if statement in here so we can go if
09:32 - ui. active self now that we' flipped it
09:36 - so in case we just enabled our pass menu
09:38 - what we want to do is go uh and um
09:42 - freeze time so U we of course don't want
09:45 - our game running while the pause menu is
09:47 - enabled and therefore we can simply go
09:49 - time. time scale and set that equal to
09:52 - zero and what you might have heard is
09:55 - that when you ever whenever you change
09:57 - the time scale meaning the uh speed at
09:59 - which the game is running and one is
10:01 - normal time zero is uh still not running
10:04 - at all and two is double time um you
10:08 - might have heard that you should change
10:10 - time. fix Delta time uh as well so time
10:14 - do fixed Delta time here you can see
10:17 - that's both a get and a set variable and
10:19 - you definitely should in case you're
10:21 - creating some uh slow motion movement or
10:24 - speeding up the game but when just
10:26 - setting time.time scale to zero it's a
10:29 - essentially freezing the uh fixed Delta
10:32 - time um behind the scen so it's actually
10:34 - not running the loop at all and
10:36 - therefore you don't need to change fixed
10:38 - Dela time so just in case some of you
10:41 - were wondering don't you have to do that
10:43 - you actually do not and in case um we
10:46 - haven't just enabled our pause menu in
10:48 - case we actually just disabled it we
10:50 - want to return to our normal time scale
10:52 - which is one so we want to just have the
10:55 - game back up and running as it would
10:57 - normally so we we should actually
10:59 - already see this happening and if we go
11:01 - into our UI scene here or our Unity
11:04 - scene here and find our game master we
11:06 - can now reference the UI element which
11:08 - is going to be our pass menu that we
11:09 - just created and let's hit play and
11:12 - let's try and freezing time and you can
11:15 - see the timer stops there's no enemy
11:17 - appearing everything else looks fine and
11:20 - we can hit escape again and the game
11:22 - continues and one nice thing is that you
11:25 - can see our hover animations are
11:27 - actually still working these are not Ed
11:29 - by the freeze time um and this is
11:33 - because this is just a simple recoloring
11:34 - and the way Unity does it is independent
11:37 - of uh the current time scale if you're
11:39 - using some more sophisticated animations
11:42 - using an animator that will be affected
11:45 - unless you change a parameter on that
11:48 - animator and I'm going to show you how
11:49 - to do that in just a moment so basically
11:52 - what we need to do now is kind of hook
11:54 - these buttons up to our pause menu in
11:57 - order to actually make them do do
11:59 - something and that's super easy all we
12:01 - do is go into a pause menu and create
12:03 - some public functions one for each
12:05 - button so we'll create a public void
12:07 - here called continue maybe or we could
12:10 - actually just have it called the toggle
12:12 - function that we already have made
12:14 - public so we'll do that and then we only
12:16 - need one for the menu and one for the
12:18 - retry so let's create a public void
12:22 - retry and in here we want to reload the
12:24 - current scene and so we need to go up
12:26 - here and get Unity engine do scene
12:30 - management and remember this is how this
12:32 - is something that we need to access
12:34 - whenever we need to load a new scene or
12:36 - reload an already existing scene and
12:39 - then we go down here and go scene
12:41 - manager do get uh or. load scene and the
12:47 - scene that we want to load is the
12:48 - currently active scene so we just want
12:50 - to reload whatever we are already on and
12:53 - we do that by going scene manager. getet
12:56 - active scene and we kind actually just
12:58 - pass in the scene that this U returns we
13:01 - need to go Dot and then build
13:04 - index cool so that is the build index of
13:07 - the scene we're currently at which we
13:09 - are pausing into the load scene and it's
13:11 - just going to restart one thing that we
13:13 - also need to make sure is that we
13:15 - unfreeze time because when reloading a
13:18 - scene Unity doesn't actually change
13:20 - time. time uh scale back to whatever it
13:23 - was in the beginning so we actually need
13:25 - to manually go in here and say time.
13:27 - time scale equals 1 or we could just hit
13:31 - toggle which we I think we're going to
13:33 - do and then we just need another a third
13:37 - method here for uh the menu and we
13:40 - haven't implemented any kind of menu yet
13:42 - so for now we'll just throw a debug.log
13:44 - statement saying something like go to
13:46 - menu much in the same way that we did U
13:49 - with our game over screen cool so that's
13:53 - pretty much all of the programming that
13:54 - we needed to do in this lesson so we can
13:56 - just close down visual studio and we we
13:58 - can find our uh PA menu object over here
14:03 - we can find our continue button and we
14:05 - can add an on click event so let's just
14:06 - hit the plus sign there drag in our game
14:08 - master where our script is sitting find
14:11 - our script and find the correct method
14:14 - which is our tarle now we need to go
14:16 - into our two buttons first off the retry
14:18 - add an onclick event drag in the game
14:20 - master find the script and let's select
14:23 - retry and the same thing for our menu
14:26 - add onclick event drag and script or
14:29 - object find script and let's select the
14:32 - menu function so now they are hooked up
14:35 - and we'll call those methods and now
14:37 - when we hit play hit Escape continue go
14:40 - it goes back as it should cool retry
14:45 - it's going to restart the level as you
14:47 - can see it did that so if I can uh let
14:50 - this go up a bit and go over here and
14:52 - hit retry you can see it totally re uh
14:54 - restarts the level and the menu it
14:56 - should say go to menu so that's perfect
14:59 - so now we have a fully working pause
15:02 - menu and all I really want to do for the
15:04 - rest of of the tutorial since we have a
15:06 - bit of time left is just add a bit more
15:09 - sophisticated animation so basically
15:12 - what I want to add is just whenever the
15:14 - PA menu is opened I want it to kind of
15:16 - fade in I think it's nice that it just
15:18 - disappears as soon as you want it to but
15:21 - when it comes to animating UI elements
15:23 - onto the screen I like to have a tiny
15:25 - bit of Animation there and I'm just
15:26 - going to go with a standard but you can
15:29 - do some fancy UI things and uh also
15:32 - whenever we hover over the buttons I
15:34 - think this is a really really boring
15:36 - animation so instead let's create
15:38 - something where our um where our buttons
15:40 - actually pop out a little bit so in
15:43 - order to do this all we really need to
15:45 - do is find our pass menu and we need to
15:48 - add an uh some animation to this and we
15:51 - do that by going to our animation tab or
15:53 - window and hitting create and this is
15:55 - going to create an animator an anim
15:58 - animator and an
16:00 - animation so the name of our animation
16:03 - here is going to be just pause menu
16:06 - because we only have one animation so
16:08 - you can see it's created an animator
16:10 - called pause menu and an animation and
16:13 - really what we want to do is just kind
16:14 - of go forward uh a little bit of time
16:19 - and then we want to animate the opacity
16:21 - of our entire PA menu so let's just
16:23 - disable the animation window let's
16:25 - enable this so we can see what we're
16:27 - doing let's hit add component and add a
16:30 - canvas renderer oh I'm sorry a canvas
16:32 - group and this allows us of course to
16:34 - animate the alpha channel of this entire
16:37 - object so now we can go hit record again
16:40 - and we can go uh forward a few frames
16:44 - and change the alpha to zero and now of
16:46 - course it animates from totally visible
16:48 - to Invisible so we just need to flip the
16:50 - audio of these key frames so let's just
16:52 - go like
16:53 - this and you can see now that we have a
16:56 - nice fading in animation actually I kind
16:59 - of messed that up so in the beginning
17:01 - here it should be zero and then it
17:03 - should be one there we go so let's see
17:06 - yeah much better and of course this is
17:08 - currently looping so let's just find our
17:10 - pause menu animation not the controller
17:12 - and disable Loop time so now it won't
17:15 - Loop and um by default these kind of
17:18 - animators are set to play the animation
17:20 - right off the bat so as soon as the game
17:22 - object is enabled this pause menu
17:25 - animation is going to play so we really
17:27 - don't need to add any more code
17:29 - whatsoever it's just going to play as
17:31 - soon as we open it up so let's try that
17:33 - out and um okay so something weird is
17:37 - happening here and what is that well you
17:40 - can actually see that if we hit Escape
17:42 - here you can see that things are
17:44 - changing and the animator is actually um
17:47 - updated it says clip count one here and
17:50 - if we have a look at the animator in
17:53 - here you can see that it is animating
17:55 - it's just stuck at the very beginning
17:58 - and that's because we froze time
17:59 - remember time is Frozen and so this clip
18:02 - here stops at the very beginning and
18:04 - when we disable it of course it's not
18:06 - going to be playing anymore because the
18:08 - object is gone so what we need to do is
18:10 - make this animation independent of our
18:13 - current time. time scale and we do that
18:17 - by going into the pass menu onto the
18:19 - animator and changing the update Mo mode
18:22 - it's currently set to normal which most
18:24 - of these animators should be but we want
18:27 - to change it in our case to unscaled
18:29 - time so when we change the time scale
18:31 - this is going to just ignore that so
18:33 - when we now hit play and hit Escape you
18:37 - can see that our PA menu animates on
18:39 - with just a quick fade in which helps
18:41 - make thing look things look a lot nicer
18:45 - and finally to our buttons all we really
18:48 - need to do here is maybe just uh enable
18:51 - our pass menu just so we can see what
18:52 - we're working with finding our say
18:54 - continue button and you just need to
18:56 - choose one of them to start with and
18:58 - we'll apply the change to all of the
18:59 - others in a very easy way we need to
19:01 - change the uh transition here to
19:03 - animation and hit autogenerate animation
19:07 - and this is just going to uh well first
19:09 - create a uh animation controller and
19:11 - let's just call this one button really
19:13 - really General um maybe we should call
19:16 - it something no that's fine pause menu
19:19 - button let's do that no yeah let's just
19:22 - do button actually and let's hit save so
19:26 - what we can do here is now we have an
19:28 - animator automatically set up with the
19:30 - button controller and if we look down in
19:32 - our animation window we have four
19:35 - different animations the normal the
19:37 - highlighted the pressed and the disabled
19:39 - and we are not really disabling our
19:41 - buttons in any way so we can just focus
19:43 - on the first three when it's normal we
19:46 - want the scale up here to be 1 one one
19:49 - and so if we just quickly modify
19:50 - something here it inserts a key frame
19:52 - automatically and we can just set that
19:54 - back so now we have a key frame here
19:56 - where the scale is one 111 then we can
19:59 - go to our highlighted mode and we can
20:01 - maybe bump this up to
20:03 - 1.05 on the X and on the Y so you can
20:07 - see that just makes the button a tiny
20:09 - bit bigger bit bigger and let's go under
20:12 - pressed and do the same as with our
20:14 - normal mode so let's just quickly edit
20:17 - that and have it be at 111 we don't need
20:20 - to do any actual um uh key framing
20:24 - inside of the uh button States
20:26 - themselves because Unity is actually
20:28 - going to blend between these animation
20:31 - States for us and so it should already
20:33 - be working one thing that we could do is
20:35 - maybe when Hing some of these buttons we
20:37 - could create a tiny bit of um movement
20:41 - uh that could be pretty cool so inside
20:43 - of our highlighted here uh we could
20:45 - actually go a bit forward in time and
20:48 - animate it so we could have it maybe go
20:50 - down
20:52 - to
20:54 - 02 here and then back up up and then
20:59 - right click and select flat so it's it's
21:02 - kind of pulsating you could totally have
21:05 - that so let's now disable the recording
21:07 - here and this should actually already be
21:10 - uh working except again this animator
21:12 - update mode needs to be change to uncale
21:15 - time or else it will not work and then
21:17 - if we disable our pause menu and hit
21:19 - play we should actually see now that
21:22 - Unity does this nice blending and you
21:24 - can see we have our animation in there
21:26 - as well I actually kind kind of like
21:28 - that animation I think it's pretty funky
21:30 - so let's just keep it in
21:32 - here so the next thing that we want to
21:34 - do is just apply this to our other
21:36 - buttons as well and that's super easy
21:38 - all we need to do is copy the animator
21:40 - copy that component find our retry
21:43 - button change the transition type to
21:45 - animation and let's now U paste the
21:48 - component as new down here and we do the
21:51 - same thing with our menu again change
21:52 - the animation right click paste
21:55 - component as new so now when we hit play
21:58 - and this is probably our final
21:59 - playthrough so let's just maximize the
22:01 - game here so we can get a good view hit
22:04 - Escape you can see that we have a nice
22:06 - hover animation for all of our
22:09 - buttons and it seems super smooth and we
22:12 - can of course continue the game we can
22:14 - retry it or we can go to the menu or at
22:17 - least we will Implement that very soon
22:20 - so that was pretty much all I wanted to
22:21 - show you for this video I hope you
22:23 - enjoyed it I actually covered a lot of
22:25 - the stuff that I wanted to cover for
