00:00 - thanks for tuning in at
00:02 - braies hello everyone welcome to video
00:05 - number 26 in make a game a cool series
00:08 - on making a video game in unity so in
00:11 - today's video we're going to take a look
00:13 - at uploading to the web so this is the
00:17 - plan for today first up we are going to
00:19 - take a look at setting up uh the quality
00:22 - settings in unity there's also some
00:25 - player settings that we'll have to
00:26 - configure then we'll talk about uh using
00:29 - the Unity Web Player versus exporting
00:32 - for
00:33 - webdl uh and uh finally we'll uh
00:36 - configure the HTM uh HTML file meaning
00:39 - how your game is presented and then be
00:41 - uploading to either a site or our own
00:45 - site so I'll show you kind of uh your
00:48 - options on Distributing a web-based
00:51 - game cool so as always if you have any
00:54 - questions throughout this video head
00:56 - over to for. bra.com where I'm sure
00:58 - you'll get your questions answered
01:01 - awesome so the very first thing was
01:04 - quality settings so as always let let's
01:07 - open up unity and uh the player icon is
01:10 - not going to be important uh this time
01:12 - however we will have to go to edit
01:15 - project settings and then quality and
01:17 - you can see our different quality levels
01:19 - here I excluded them in the last video
01:22 - uh because I thought that the default
01:24 - settings uh were fine uh when it comes
01:27 - to uh Standalone player however I will
01:30 - give you the option to tweak this uh in
01:33 - uh a web player so you can see that we
01:36 - have the different build options here
01:38 - and we have the different quality levels
01:40 - uh that you can check for these and you
01:43 - can choose the default uh for each of
01:45 - them here and it will be highlighted in
01:48 - green so each level here has some
01:51 - different settings and you can see from
01:53 - uh for a web here it uses the medium
01:56 - quality you can also add a quality tier
01:58 - or a quality level
02:00 - and uh under the medium quality we see
02:03 - that we use a pixel light count of 30
02:05 - that means that we can have 30 lights uh
02:07 - in the seene scene at the same time at
02:10 - maximum and that's fine for us the
02:13 - texture quality is going to be full rest
02:14 - which is great uh anistropic uh
02:18 - anisotropic textures um is a a per
02:22 - texture uh you can set this to forc uh
02:25 - on if you want to get rid of this
02:27 - blurring when viewing textures from
02:30 - certain angles you can see that it it uh
02:34 - kind of what that looks like in the
02:35 - scene here when I change our point of
02:38 - view and that might be something that
02:40 - you will want to prioritize uh with this
02:42 - game because we're going to be viewing
02:44 - this from the side at all times but
02:47 - again I'm just going to leave it at per
02:49 - texture here uh so I'll make so that I'm
02:52 - sure it will run fine uh when I'm
02:54 - recording too antialising I don't REM
02:58 - commend going above uh for a multi
03:00 - sampling on this one um it's U if you
03:04 - don't know what anti alling does
03:07 - aliasing uh is it kind of uh make sure
03:10 - that you get these smooth smooth edges
03:13 - so if I just disable this you can see
03:15 - that we get this these um blocky lines
03:19 - here uh kind of pixelated and and harsh
03:22 - and if I bump this up to eight you can
03:24 - see that it Smooths uh that out
03:27 - completely so two is decent and uh I
03:31 - think it'll suit us fine you can turn on
03:33 - soft particle uh particles here um but
03:38 - that's not going to be needed for our
03:40 - game and the rest will just ignore here
03:43 - and when it comes to Shadows I think our
03:45 - settings are going to be fine I mean we
03:47 - are aren really viewing these Shadows
03:50 - from from any crazy angles and it uh
03:53 - does give us a hard and soft Shadows uh
03:56 - which is
03:58 - fine cool so now that we've kind of set
04:01 - those up we can also look at what
04:03 - settings it chooses for our webgl export
04:06 - here and those are more moderate uh
04:09 - currently it's set to half the
04:11 - resolution uh no ntl ising uh you'll
04:14 - notice the pixel light count is is very
04:16 - low this time but again that doesn't
04:19 - make a huge difference for us only if we
04:21 - have like a bunch of coins which all
04:24 - have lighted on them uh you'll you'll
04:26 - notice that and uh you can also see that
04:28 - the Shadows are two hard Shadows only
04:30 - but this is really about playing around
04:33 - um and uh you can of course read a lot
04:36 - about how you can optimize your game so
04:38 - you can bump up these
04:40 - settings cool so uh let's go to the
04:44 - player settings so let's go under
04:46 - project settings and then player and uh
04:49 - these can also be accessed under uh file
04:52 - build settings and then player settings
04:54 - from here so right now you can see that
04:57 - I've uh go ahead and changed build to
05:00 - webgl uh so the default one is PC Mac
05:05 - and Linux Standalone and if you want to
05:07 - switch platform you simply select the
05:09 - platform you want to switch to uh in my
05:11 - case I've selected webgl here and then
05:14 - click switch
05:15 - platform and uh it's that easy you can
05:17 - see I could do the same with the web
05:19 - player I've just gone ahead and done
05:20 - this before I restarted the recording
05:23 - because it can be a slow process
05:25 - especially if you have a lot of assets
05:27 - in your
05:27 - scene cool so uh you can see here we
05:31 - have a bunch of okay uh just while
05:34 - remember this make sure all of your
05:36 - scenes are uh in the scenes and buil
05:39 - list or they will not be loaded and
05:41 - you'll have errors cool so these are the
05:45 - settings for the webg export and again
05:47 - I'll talk about the differences in a
05:49 - second and here you can see you can
05:51 - adjust the resolution of the player and
05:54 - that's something you can also edit at a
05:56 - later time uh you can adjust well not
05:58 - you want this to be able able to run in
06:00 - the background and
06:02 - uh I think uh we'll just leave that on
06:06 - and then you can choose an HTML template
06:09 - and we're just going to use the default
06:10 - one here icon and uh Splash image uh can
06:14 - pretty much be ignored if you do uh I
06:18 - think this requires the pro version
06:20 - still uh but you can disable the unity
06:22 - uh splash screen that means the unity
06:25 - ion showing at startup and then we have
06:28 - some other settings here which which I
06:29 - think we'll just leave for now on the
06:32 - publishing settings you also have some
06:35 - configurational options but I think all
06:37 - of this is a bit too advanced still the
06:39 - default settings will work just fine for
06:42 - us so just check that your company name
06:44 - and product name is as you want it to be
06:47 - and that the resolution makes sense for
06:49 - your game then you can go ahead and hit
06:52 - build and run over here we don't want to
06:54 - check development build and then you can
06:56 - choose a place to build it I've gone
06:58 - ahead and make a builds folder under the
07:01 - mega game project folder where I have my
07:03 - Mac builds my windows builds and my
07:06 - webdl builds here and you can see that
07:08 - I've built this already because webdl is
07:11 - still in preview and therefore might
07:13 - take a quite a while and sometimes
07:16 - you'll even need to restart the editor
07:18 - because something goes wrong in the
07:20 - process so be aware that uh this is not
07:23 - really a final solution okay so I think
07:27 - it's time that we talk about whip player
07:30 - versus
07:31 - webgl and we'll take a look at the web
07:34 - player player settings in a second so uh
07:39 - up till quite recently uh Unity has been
07:42 - using a plug-in uh the Unity Web Player
07:46 - plugin uh that uh in order to support
07:50 - playing their games in a browser so you
07:52 - have this possibility to export to a web
07:56 - player and then you can uh upload it to
07:59 - any kind of a web server and uh all that
08:02 - the user needs to do in order to play it
08:04 - is visit the site and then uh download
08:07 - the plugin if it isn't installed
08:10 - already however uh this uh this Unity
08:15 - pluging uses a chrome API called the NP
08:21 - API uh whoops I wrote that wrong uh so
08:25 - I'll just write it here the NP API
08:30 - and uh the NP API is basically an API
08:34 - for programming uh plugins uh that
08:37 - Chrome has supported up until uh quite
08:41 - recently in 2013 they announced that
08:43 - this would be soon so would be
08:46 - deprecated and uh then entirely removed
08:50 - and that forced Unity to kind of redo
08:52 - and rethink how they wanted to do uh um
08:56 - Unity games on the web so what this
09:00 - means for us is that the web player
09:02 - currently works just fine on Firefox and
09:05 - Internet Explorer and other
09:07 - browsers but on Chrome it will not work
09:11 - you can go ahead and enable the NP API
09:13 - still even though it's deprecated but uh
09:17 - Google has said that they will entirely
09:19 - remove this feature uh in a uh near
09:24 - future so uh since most people are using
09:28 - Chrome uh the these days uh you it's
09:31 - worth considering doing something else
09:34 - and unity is doing so they are adding
09:37 - support for webdl based games if you
09:40 - don't know webgl is a graphics API or
09:44 - it's more than that now but it's another
09:47 - API for writing uh uh games or Graphics
09:52 - software um on the browser and uh there
09:56 - are a lot of uh good things about webgl
09:59 - for first off you D drastically uh
10:02 - reduce load times uh you don't have this
10:04 - loading bar it just jumps right in and
10:07 - uh also it's uh it's now of course
10:11 - supported on
10:13 - Chrome however webdl is still in preview
10:16 - and it's been so for quite a while now
10:19 - and uh it's fair to say that web deal is
10:23 - is pretty uh unstable at this point so
10:27 - let me just show you what this web
10:29 - build looks like in the browser you can
10:31 - see that this can be opened in Chrome
10:34 - I'll just go ahead and do
10:35 - so
10:36 - [Music]
10:38 - uh just a moment here so we'll open
10:43 - this in Chrome whoops it uh I get an
10:46 - error here just give me one second and
10:48 - I'll see what's
10:50 - wrong okay so I'm back and I just
10:53 - quickly read up on what was happening
10:55 - here uh well basically um I found this
10:58 - page in the documentation and i'
11:00 - completely forgotten about this because
11:02 - it's been a while since I've uploaded to
11:04 - uh webgl well uh if you go down here uh
11:09 - it will say that uh you can view your
11:11 - webgl player directly in the Firefox
11:13 - browser by simply opening the index.html
11:17 - file for safety reasons most other
11:20 - browsers Place restrictions on scripts
11:22 - open from a local file uh so this
11:25 - technique will not work when uh you go
11:29 - in and uh build your game using build
11:31 - and run and then open it um and set it
11:35 - to automatically opening Chrome however
11:37 - it will uh work because then it will
11:39 - temporarily set up an local server and
11:43 - uh it did so with me it set up this
11:45 - Local Host
11:47 - 54915 where I can access my game and
11:50 - this is going to be different for you uh
11:53 - but if it does so that's great and you
11:55 - can open your game here if not then I
11:58 - suggest you test it in Firefox well you
12:00 - can see our game is currently working
12:02 - here and I can roll back and forth and
12:05 - can uh change the music and I'll go
12:07 - ahead and play the game here and you can
12:09 - see that we can also uh maximize the
12:12 - game and uh the game is indeed working
12:15 - uh not as pretty as the web J uh player
12:18 - but it is indeed working so just go
12:21 - ahead and die here and you can see that
12:23 - that works just fine so again if it
12:26 - didn't set up that Local Host uh then I
12:29 - suggest just running it uh in Firefox
12:32 - when testing it locally like this um but
12:35 - know that it is supported in the Chrome
12:37 - browser you'll just have to host it in
12:39 - order for people to uh play it so I'll
12:42 - just open with Firefox here to show you
12:45 - that this indeed uh does work so you can
12:48 - see that I've opened it in Firefox here
12:50 - and we'll just wait for it to load and
12:53 - you can see that loading is much faster
12:55 - than it would be on a uh Web Player um
12:59 - using the plugin
13:01 - cool so that's it for
13:04 - webgl what do we do if we want to export
13:07 - to the much more stable web player I
13:09 - think this is the best option so far I
13:12 - know you're using losing a percentage of
13:14 - the market uh but a lot of people play
13:17 - uh Unity games uh on Firefox and
13:20 - Internet Explorer and that works just
13:22 - fine so if we want to build for web
13:25 - player all we have to do is change
13:27 - switch platform to the web
13:30 - player and it's just going to hold on
13:32 - for a second there and all of these
13:34 - settings we can leave as is then we'll
13:36 - go over here again we can change the uh
13:39 - screen width and Screen height and we
13:41 - can change the
13:42 - template again icon can be ignored the
13:45 - same with Splash image and all of these
13:48 - other settings can also be ignored now
13:51 - we'll go ahead and hit build and run uh
13:53 - actually I'll just hit build and uh then
13:56 - we can make a new folder and we'll call
13:58 - this
14:00 - um web
14:04 - player and we'll just hit select folder
14:07 - and it will start
14:09 - building so we'll just wake a wait a
14:12 - second here and if we open this up
14:14 - inside of our Explorer and open up the
14:17 - web player folder here we can just check
14:19 - out the folder structure that it will
14:21 - generate in a second or the file
14:23 - structure I should say so you can see
14:25 - here inside of web player it's created
14:28 - only two file files so you can see that
14:31 - exporting to webg creates this fairly
14:34 - complicated hierarchy of folders and
14:36 - files uh you have the compressed game
14:38 - you have an HTML file that you use to
14:41 - load the game in and uh all of this
14:44 - other data whereas on uh in the web
14:47 - player folder you only have two files
14:48 - you have the HTML file which shows your
14:51 - game and you have a Unity 3D file which
14:55 - is the game itself so you can also see
14:58 - the the uh size difference between these
15:01 - two so if we want to now run our game
15:05 - we'll just have to right click and open
15:06 - with Firefox and uh you can see that it
15:09 - now uh displays right there and it
15:12 - actually loaded really really quickly uh
15:14 - but I've also been loading this game
15:16 - before so that might be the reason why
15:19 - load times will uh often be much slower
15:22 - so you can see we can play our game here
15:24 - and it looks a whole lot better than the
15:25 - web player or the webgl version uh so
15:29 - far so the game is working cool but what
15:34 - we can do is we can edit this HTML file
15:38 - whoops we can edit the HTML five uh file
15:41 - to change uh the way that we present our
15:44 - game so in order to do this and this is
15:47 - very easy especially if you know HTML U
15:50 - we just need to right click on this HTML
15:52 - file and hit edit with notepad and this
15:56 - might look a bit frightening uh but uh
15:59 - with me here and you can do the same
16:00 - thing with uh the uh webgl
16:04 - export so we have an uh HTML structure
16:08 - then we have some JavaScript code we
16:10 - also have some CSS and uh then finally
16:13 - we have some more HTML so the first part
16:16 - here is all of the HML that shows uh
16:20 - above the actual player the JavaScript
16:23 - is responsible for loading the player in
16:26 - the CSS is responsible for styling all
16:28 - of the the elements in our HTML and uh
16:32 - the last HTML part here is responsible
16:35 - for what is shown after the actual
16:37 - plug-in and this also contains uh an
16:41 - error if the web player is not um
16:44 - supported in the browser isn't
16:47 - installed so we can actually just go
16:49 - ahead and change a bunch of things here
16:51 - so we for example change this from Unity
16:53 - Web Player Mega game to uh something
16:56 - else if you want to do that we can go
16:59 - down here and change the font size and
17:01 - weight and all of that uh or maybe um
17:04 - since this is a bre tutorial um we could
17:07 - add onto this so here it says that it
17:10 - was created with unity we could say
17:14 - and
17:16 - using uh the make a game tutorial
17:23 - series
17:25 - from uh from and then
17:31 - Braes and we'll change the title here to
17:34 - go to bra.com and we'll change the url
17:38 - here to bra keys.com so we can save this
17:43 - out and we can close this we can run
17:47 - this with
17:49 - Firefox and you can see that it loads in
17:52 - the game and down here it says created
17:53 - with unity and using the make a game
17:55 - tutorial series from brais and you can
17:58 - click that there and it will go to
18:00 - bre.com so you can change that file
18:03 - however you want uh it to
18:06 - be cool so now that you have your game
18:11 - you've chosen the option that you want
18:13 - to export it uh that you want to use
18:15 - when exporting you have chosen uh how
18:19 - you want it to display now you have to
18:21 - choose how you want it to be uploaded
18:24 - well before we have this uh possibility
18:26 - of uploading uh unity game using Dropbox
18:30 - but that has gotten pretty clunky lately
18:32 - and uh it's not even really an option
18:35 - for uh free uh Dropbox accounts that are
18:40 - free so instead we are going to have uh
18:43 - to look at two possibilities the first
18:45 - one is uploading to a site and if this
18:48 - is something you want to do well then
18:49 - you can just completely ignore your HTML
18:51 - file then you'll go ahead and upload
18:54 - this Unity 3D file and uh places to
18:57 - upload to could be congregate uh or uh
19:02 - you could also upload to something like
19:05 - um what's it called uh it's called new
19:09 - grounds or armor games uh there are a
19:12 - bunch of uh places that you can plays
19:15 - your game uh if you don't want to host
19:17 - it yourself so for example here you see
19:20 - uh the congregate website where you can
19:22 - go and uh you can see that I've uploaded
19:25 - a game here called kill quite a long
19:28 - time ago
19:29 - and uh you can go in here and simply up
19:31 - hit upload your game fill in some
19:33 - information and a category and then
19:36 - upload the unity 3D file and all that so
19:39 - that is definitely an option or if you
19:42 - want to host this
19:44 - yourself well uh then you can just uh if
19:47 - you're using Wordpress or whatever uh
19:50 - use some kind of uh FTP client so FTP
19:54 - stands for file transferring protocol
19:57 - I'm using the program called filea but
20:00 - this will require some hosting so you
20:03 - will have to uh kind of pay for a domain
20:07 - of course own bra.com so if I just
20:10 - quickly go ahead and connect to my
20:12 - website here there we go uh you can see
20:16 - all of the files that are on the bra.com
20:19 - domain uh on my hosting provider and uh
20:22 - I'm using Wordpress um but most or
20:27 - pretty much all um uh web file
20:30 - structures has a public HTML folder
20:33 - where you can place different files that
20:35 - you want to people to be able to access
20:38 - without requiring a password or getting
20:40 - through any kind of protection and uh in
20:43 - here we can then create a directory and
20:45 - we can maybe name this U make a
20:48 - game and uh we can double click that and
20:51 - uh then we can simply drag our two files
20:54 - into this so we'll maybe rename this to
20:57 - make a game
20:59 - uh web
21:01 - build and uh we'll rename this to the
21:04 - same drag those two in
21:09 - there and uh actually let's just make
21:13 - sure that
21:14 - we we probably need to yeah we need to
21:18 - edit the uh name of the unity file in
21:22 - here too so whenever you change the file
21:24 - there you need to change it there too
21:26 - because it initializes the plugin by
21:28 - loading uh this
21:30 - file uh so I think that's all we need to
21:34 - do uh hopefully let's just make sure
21:37 - that this is working by running it in
21:41 - Firefox yep that was all we needed to do
21:44 - uh and so we need to do the same thing
21:48 - here we can simply remove those
21:52 - two and drag in the new
21:56 - versions there we go and now you should
21:59 - be able to go
22:01 - to your domain so I'll type in bra.com
22:06 - SL make a game slash uh make a game web
22:13 - build.
22:15 - HTML and you can see that it says Chrome
22:18 - cannot run this app and uh if we do the
22:21 - same thing in
22:23 - Firefox if we open this
22:25 - up it should simply load the game game
22:28 - so you can now share this URL with all
22:31 - your friends and they will be able to uh
22:33 - load that up
22:36 - oops leave that cool so that's basically
22:40 - how you can uh export your game for the
22:42 - web you have some different options
22:45 - there and uh how you can upload it to a
22:48 - site of your choosing I know that Unity
22:52 - games on the web is kind of on a weird
22:54 - middle ground right now uh where it's
22:57 - it's in the process of transitioning
22:59 - from the web player to webdl but uh try
23:02 - and look at this at it as a lot of
23:05 - possibilities instead of a lot of
23:07 - restrictions uh which is uh sometimes
23:10 - can feel like so uh I hope you enjoyed
23:13 - this video and and found it
23:14 - informational and uh uh a lot of these
23:17 - uh things uh depending on what you
23:19 - choose is something that will require
23:21 - you to search up uh on how to upload to
23:24 - congregate or a guide on FTP uploading
23:28 - to a server and all of that because it's
23:30 - simply too much for me to cover in one
23:32 - video but you should get hopefully get
23:35 - an understanding on how this work from
23:37 - uh this video so that pretty much
23:39 - concludes the make a game course I don't
23:42 - have much more to show you when it comes
23:45 - to uh this game and uh I hope you've
23:48 - enjoyed the process and and learning
23:50 - some stuff with me and uh well from this
23:54 - point I suggest you check out some of
23:56 - the other courses that are available on
23:58 - the brei YouTube channel uh there are a
24:01 - lot of stuff on uh C programming uh both
24:05 - inside and outside of unity which I
24:07 - suggest you check out uh a cool uh thing
24:10 - to start doing now with maybe uh uh
24:13 - learning from the uh how to program in C
24:16 - course and then maybe uh using that
24:19 - together with the how to uh make a 2d
24:21 - platformer course uh in order to get a
24:24 - deep understanding of how to program in
24:26 - C and how to uh apply more advanced
24:29 - programming Concepts uh to game
24:32 - development in unity so that's really
24:34 - something I suggest you check out now
