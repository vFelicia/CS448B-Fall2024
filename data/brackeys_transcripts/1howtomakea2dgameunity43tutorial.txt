00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello
00:04 - everyone and welcome to the first video
00:06 - in this unity 2d short series so this is
00:10 - basically just going to be a a pretty
00:12 - short series where I'm going to show you
00:14 - how to use the new features introduced
00:18 - in unity 4.3 so here we have it
00:22 - 4.3 new 2d tools and they are great so
00:26 - go to unity 3d comm under the download
00:29 - section and make sure you have at least
00:31 - 4.3 downloaded and installed the type we
00:36 - of game you're going to be making is a
00:38 - pong type game and it's just old-school
00:41 - pong but with updated graphics and I'm
00:44 - going to walk you through the whole
00:46 - process but I've also made a 2d pack an
00:50 - acid pack which you can download from
00:53 - the brackish comm yem website and from
00:57 - there you get all kinds of different
01:00 - cool things to use in many different
01:02 - categories of 2d games so first off we
01:06 - have the the pong game here this is
01:09 - basically what we are going to be making
01:11 - at least some what it should look like
01:13 - this at the end and for that I also have
01:17 - the full Photoshop file where you have
01:19 - all the different layers named correctly
01:21 - different parameters you can tweak you
01:25 - get everything fully customizable and
01:27 - all of the different individual sprites
01:30 - exported as PNG files and ready for
01:33 - importing and then I also have the
01:36 - platformer temple here if you want to
01:39 - make like a 2d side-scrolling platformer
01:42 - and I also have a speed add of that
01:45 - coming up so when it's going to be done
01:48 - I don't know yet but it's definitely on
01:49 - its way and for that is the Photoshop
01:52 - and the sprites also then the top-down
01:54 - arcade start type game and this is some
01:57 - pixel art also and then we have some
02:00 - tower defense where you can plant towers
02:03 - and make up your own animation and such
02:06 - so you have quite a few things to play
02:09 - around with here and all of this should
02:11 - get you started
02:13 - and then we have a various folder which
02:15 - now only includes a coin but it that
02:18 - will probably get more in there and if
02:21 - you make something cool and want to
02:22 - share it with the world please write to
02:24 - me and I might include it in the assets
02:26 - pack great so now let's get started with
02:29 - today's lesson so let's start up unity
02:33 - and yank it going with this tutorial so
02:37 - let's open up unity and a cool little
02:41 - trick is whenever you open up unity and
02:44 - don't want it to load up the project but
02:47 - instead wanted to open this wizard so
02:49 - you can open another one or create a new
02:51 - project then you simply open up unity
02:54 - and right after you have clicked it then
02:56 - hold down alt and it needs to be right
02:59 - after and then this wizard should pop up
03:02 - that's just really annoying when you
03:04 - have to load up a whole project and then
03:07 - open up another so that's a great little
03:09 - trick now let's go under create new
03:12 - project let's browse for from my Dropbox
03:16 - folder he'll add a new subfolder and
03:19 - let's call this pawn and select folder
03:23 - so Dropbox pong that's perfect
03:26 - we are not going to import any packages
03:29 - but we are going to set the defaults for
03:32 - 2d games and this is really important
03:34 - you either need to do this right now
03:37 - while making the project but you can
03:39 - also do it later and I'll show you in a
03:42 - sec how to do that so let's hit create
03:44 - and it will open up a an empty unity
03:48 - project set up for the new 2d tools
03:52 - again if you've already made something
03:54 - and want to adjust it to the new 2d
03:57 - stuff so then you can just go to edit
03:59 - project settings and then editor and
04:02 - then the default behavior mode needs to
04:05 - be 2d and great so now that we have set
04:09 - up our projects we can go to the scene
04:13 - view and see that this looks all kinds
04:16 - of weird we can see that this is now a
04:18 - two dimensional grid and you can go up
04:21 - here at the
04:22 - top of the scene view and go back to
04:24 - three view so disable the 2d view and
04:27 - then switch back again so it's a very
04:30 - seamless workflow from 3d to 2d okay so
04:35 - let's go ahead and import our first
04:37 - sprite a sprite is basically a texture I
04:41 - know there's the difference but it's not
04:43 - that important so let's go under the
04:46 - individual sprites under our pong to the
04:48 - assets pack and let's just drag in the
04:52 - background we're gonna adjust that first
04:53 - and so just drag it in and it's now
04:56 - imported and because we have selected 2d
04:59 - s our defaults you can see a new texture
05:01 - type has been selected called a sprite
05:04 - and under here we get all kinds of
05:06 - different settings the first off is the
05:10 - sprite mode we want that to be single
05:12 - because there's only one object or
05:14 - sprite we want to show inside of this
05:16 - image sometimes you have a whole
05:18 - spreadsheet is what it's called where
05:20 - you have all kinds of objects in one one
05:23 - single image but right now it's single
05:26 - the packing tag just ignore that for now
05:29 - pixels to units that's important if you
05:31 - import something and think way this this
05:34 - is way too small or way too large then
05:37 - you can change the pixels to units so
05:39 - making this smaller will make it appear
05:41 - larger and the other way around the
05:44 - pivot we want that to be centered for
05:46 - our background that means that it will
05:47 - be centered our anchor point will be
05:50 - centered in the middle of the picture
05:52 - and the filter mode should be bilinear
05:56 - the max size I want to bump that up to
06:00 - 2048 and that's because this is a really
06:05 - high resolution image but if you are
06:08 - making something like a web player game
06:10 - where you don't have that much resource
06:12 - to go with I would go ahead and bump it
06:14 - down a bit you can easily do that and
06:17 - the format just leave it at compress
06:20 - even though it says it won't that's
06:22 - because it's not made in the power of 2
06:25 - and that's a longer to study discussion
06:27 - so let's just ignore this and hit apply
06:31 - great so now we can simply drag it into
06:34 - the scene view
06:35 - you will see it appear and we can drag
06:37 - it round and it works just right so
06:39 - that's just century our X and our Y and
06:43 - the Z should already be centered if not
06:45 - make it zero generally you want to work
06:49 - with your images in you know with as the
06:52 - directional axis of zero unless you
06:56 - really know what you're doing
06:58 - beforehand we used to sometimes sort
07:00 - images using the z axis but unity has
07:03 - made a new great way to do this called
07:06 - sorting layers and we're going to look
07:07 - at them in a sec first off you see this
07:10 - new component called sprite renderer
07:11 - this is where we can select the sprite
07:14 - also tinted in different colors and the
07:17 - cool thing about this color tint is it's
07:19 - no longer connected to the material so
07:22 - you can do it for individual objects and
07:25 - not have to create a new material every
07:27 - time now to the sorting layer so
07:30 - basically there are two things you need
07:32 - to remember for a sorting layer the
07:35 - first off is the sorting layer itself
07:36 - that's basically a group so there that
07:40 - could be a background sorting layer a
07:43 - middle and a foreground solid layer you
07:46 - could also split it up into enemies
07:48 - players but generally you have like a
07:51 - background and a foreground and then
07:53 - maybe some some more to split it up and
07:56 - then there's the order in layer and
07:58 - basically the higher this is the more on
08:01 - top it's going to get drawn so if this
08:03 - is higher than all of the other objects
08:06 - it's going to get drawn on top and this
08:08 - is basically a way to sort and different
08:11 - objects inside the same layer so let's
08:15 - go to the sorting layer hit at sorting
08:18 - layer and hit plus and let's change this
08:21 - to back ground and because we want this
08:25 - to get drawn beneath the default layer
08:27 - we're going to drag it above it that's
08:29 - not really logic to me but that's how
08:32 - the unity guys set it up there might be
08:34 - some really interesting research and its
08:36 - might it might be logic to you but yeah
08:38 - things that needs to be in the
08:40 - background needs to be on top so we'll
08:43 - just do that go back select the BG here
08:46 - and go and select our new background so
08:49 - layer and the ordering layer let's just
08:52 - that it would be fine to just set it at
08:54 - zero for now because we only have one
08:56 - thing in the background layer but I want
08:58 - what I want to do is I want to set this
09:00 - to something like whoops so something
09:03 - like minus ten and that's because we
09:06 - might have different background layers
09:08 - or objects in the background layer but I
09:12 - want this to be ultimately on the button
09:14 - this should be drawn after everything
09:17 - else meaning that we can simply just
09:19 - push it back a whole lot so we don't
09:21 - have to worry about it overlapping and
09:23 - where where did that sprite go oh it's
09:25 - beneath the background we're not going
09:27 - to get any of that one thing that can be
09:30 - extremely annoying whenever you are
09:32 - working with sprites in the foreground
09:34 - and have a large background um is that
09:39 - whenever you need to select it or drag
09:41 - it something in the foreground you
09:43 - sometimes get to select the background
09:45 - instead and oh no now it's all out of
09:48 - place and and it can it can be really
09:51 - frustrating so unity of course made
09:53 - something great we can use to take care
09:56 - of this problem that is the layer here
09:59 - so select the layer not deciding Lee at
10:01 - the normal layer hit add layer let's
10:05 - call this we can just do background you
10:07 - can call it something more specific if
10:09 - you want and then select our BG layer
10:12 - again and select the background layer
10:14 - there and well now you can see it's
10:17 - still not locked so we need to make sure
10:19 - that everything onto the background
10:21 - layer is locked to do this we go up to
10:24 - layers above the inspector and we can go
10:28 - down here under the background and we
10:30 - can actually see it is locked but you
10:32 - can disable it and enable it here so but
10:36 - this basically means once you have
10:37 - something selected you can still change
10:39 - it but if we deselect it
10:41 - we can't select it again we can do
10:43 - anything but we one will never select
10:45 - our background unless we go over to the
10:47 - hierarchy and selected there and then
10:49 - you can make changes so that's really
10:51 - awesome if you want to make much in the
10:53 - scene view and and don't want to select
10:55 - wrong things now let's set up our main
10:59 - camera so basically what I like to do is
11:01 - I like to Rin
11:02 - name this to main camera in one word and
11:05 - also you can see here this box is what
11:09 - will get rendered and you might think
11:13 - let's just drag this out so it just fits
11:17 - the background perfectly but that's not
11:21 - always a good idea because you're
11:22 - probably going to be publishing your
11:25 - game too many different kinds of
11:27 - platforms and therefore you're going to
11:29 - have many different screen sizes and
11:31 - resolutions and not only are they going
11:34 - to vary in size but then they're also
11:38 - going to change in the aspect ratio so
11:41 - some might be really long and some might
11:44 - be really tall and so you really need
11:47 - some space here so that so that if you
11:52 - have something really long this won't
11:54 - stretch out and you will get these blue
11:56 - ugly lines so we might just drag it up
11:59 - just a tad but watch out you don't go
12:02 - overboard and if you want to check this
12:04 - we can simply go to the game view and
12:06 - just drag this out to make a new window
12:09 - for it like this so untuck it and then
12:13 - we can just play around with the screen
12:15 - size and see we can go really really
12:18 - long before the blue starts appearing
12:20 - and what we can do even more than this
12:23 - is we can make sure the background is
12:25 - not and a color that you notice this
12:29 - much so we can change it from blue to
12:31 - something else so go to the background
12:33 - color on the camera go to the color
12:37 - picker and now we can go over here and
12:39 - select something more neutral a neutral
12:42 - grayish color and then just fine-tune it
12:45 - yourself until you get something you
12:47 - like and I think this looks just perfect
12:50 - so let's just drag that back the game
12:53 - view here let's just drag that into
12:55 - position and now our main camera has
12:58 - been set up great so this lesson is
13:02 - already coming to a close let's just
13:06 - quickly import our player so go to our
13:11 - individual sprites under the 2d assets
13:13 - pack and drag it into the project panel
13:16 - selected in the project panel make sure
13:18 - the pixels two units match so that this
13:21 - won't be huge and the other thing will
13:23 - be really small and all of the other
13:25 - settings are just fine now we can simply
13:28 - drag it on there and we can see it
13:30 - working because it's automatically under
13:32 - the default sorting layer so it will get
13:34 - drawn on top and we can press F to focus
13:37 - on it and see that we have some nice
13:39 - shadowing which I made in Photoshop and
13:41 - this looks just right we can move it
13:43 - just a bit out to the side here and see
13:46 - that it now looks just like in pong so
13:49 - of course we're going to be building
13:51 - more onto this we're going to be making
13:52 - some cool functionality I mean right now
13:54 - the game isn't exactly exciting and and
13:58 - it's going to be really awesome I'm
13:59 - looking forward to it and again if you
14:02 - want to get your some of your designs in
14:05 - the asset pack and contribute to this
14:07 - project then please write to me on
14:10 - Twitter at Brad keys suite that will be
14:14 - something on the screen right now
14:16 - indicating that it's Brad key suite and
14:19 - yeah so thank you for watching and I'll
14:22 - see you in the next video
