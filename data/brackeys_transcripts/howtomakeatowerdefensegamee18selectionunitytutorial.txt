00:00 - so when I open my computer today windows
00:02 - decided to do an hour-long update and
00:04 - what that did is mess up my mic so I
00:08 - just recorded a full video with no sound
00:11 - anyways here we go for a second try this
00:14 - video is brought to you by our own Metta
00:15 - thank you so much for donating if you
00:17 - want to support breakage yourself you
00:19 - can go to patreon.com/scishow Cheers
00:21 - thanks for tuning in at brac ease hello
00:25 - I want to welcome to this video on
00:26 - creating a tower defense game in unity
00:27 - today we'll be making some functionality
00:29 - for selecting turrets so whenever we are
00:32 - click on a chart on our map we'll have a
00:34 - cool UI pop-up right above that chart
00:36 - with some options for upgrading and
00:39 - selling the chart today we won't be
00:41 - making the actual functionality for
00:43 - upgrading and selling it will only be
00:45 - keeping track of what turret is
00:46 - currently selected and showing the UI in
00:49 - cool ways and then in future videos we
00:51 - can actually take a look at doing those
00:53 - two things the reason why I chose to do
00:56 - this video today is because in the last
00:58 - one I asked you what you wanted to see
00:59 - and an overwhelming amount of you said
01:01 - upgrades and a lot of you said selling
01:03 - as well so I thought this was a pretty
01:05 - important video to get out of the way in
01:07 - order to do all that stuff so without
01:10 - further ado let's just jump right into
01:11 - it so as you can see I'm here in unity
01:14 - and what I want to begin with it's just
01:15 - kind of sketch out the UI so I want to
01:18 - do this let's bring in a turret that we
01:19 - can use as a reference point so let's
01:22 - find our standard turd and just drag it
01:24 - into the scene and you can see a place
01:25 - to sit right here then let's create an
01:28 - empty object and we'll call this one our
01:31 - node UI so you could also call it select
01:35 - UI or turret UI whatever this is going
01:38 - to store our two buttons and you could
01:40 - definitely implement information about
01:41 - the turret here as well so if you want
01:43 - to be able to inspect turrets to see
01:45 - more about them such as health or cost
01:48 - or stuff like that you can implement it
01:50 - into this UI very easily so what we'll
01:53 - do is have this sit right on top of our
01:55 - turret so let's find our standard chart
01:57 - copy the transform component of that and
02:00 - paste it onto a new UI and the reason
02:03 - why is whenever we want to select
02:05 - different turrets will have this no UI
02:07 - move to the position of that turret so
02:10 - right now when building it we want to
02:12 - make sure it lines up with our
02:13 - reference awesome so what we can do now
02:16 - is pretty much just shift into 2d mode
02:18 - and create a child object of this and
02:21 - this is going to be a canvas and right
02:24 - now you can see our canvas is huge
02:26 - that's because it's currently in screen
02:28 - space overlay we want this to be part of
02:30 - the world space so let's change it to
02:33 - world space and it's also changed the
02:35 - scale to point zero seven point zero
02:37 - seven and again on the Z then we can hit
02:41 - F to focus in on it and you can see that
02:43 - current currently it's it's not really
02:46 - in the right place so let's just hit
02:48 - reset on the rect transform and that
02:50 - actually modifies our scale here so
02:52 - we'll just change that very quickly
02:54 - again here and I keep hitting eight
02:57 - there so point zero seven and point zero
03:00 - seven there we go so now hit F and you
03:02 - can see it's it's in the right place now
03:04 - let's move this up a bit to offset it
03:07 - let's also kind of make it not quite as
03:09 - tall and it's definitely widen it to
03:13 - something like 210 and I'm just going to
03:15 - write it out here so I actually kind of
03:18 - like the look at this we might need it
03:21 - to be a bit taller then what we can do
03:23 - is right click on this go UI and then
03:25 - panel and on this of course has an image
03:29 - and you can definitely keep this in case
03:30 - you want this panel to have some kind of
03:33 - background but since we'll only have
03:34 - like two buttons and then a arrow
03:37 - pointing to the turret I don't think
03:39 - it's necessary for us to have that so
03:41 - let's just disable the image for now one
03:43 - thing that we do want to add is another
03:46 - component here called the arm horizontal
03:49 - layout group and this will just nicely
03:52 - layout our two buttons when we create
03:54 - them we'll also make sure to rename this
03:56 - here to something like buttons
04:00 - so let's now right-click on this go on
04:02 - the UI and create our first button and
04:04 - let's create duplicate this by hitting
04:06 - ctrl D or command D if you are on the
04:08 - Mac so now you can see it easily scales
04:10 - these so let's set up the first one so
04:13 - let's go into text and let's make this
04:15 - upgrade and we can also put an amount in
04:19 - here so let's say that it costs $100 to
04:23 - upgrade it will of course make this arm
04:25 - change depending on what
04:27 - turd you have selected but that is
04:28 - probably for a later video so what we
04:31 - can do is then change the font here and
04:33 - I want to use the road bottle medium and
04:36 - what I also want to do is have this
04:37 - upgrade part be a lot more on or a lot
04:40 - bigger or fat or more clear than on the
04:45 - actual cost so in order to do that let's
04:47 - just make this as bold using these easy
04:51 - HTML tags inside of our text and you can
04:54 - see that will make only that text bold
04:56 - also right now focus on the scene view
04:59 - and don't look over at the game view
05:00 - it's looking a bit weird at the moment
05:02 - and that's because we haven't rotated
05:04 - the UI which I plan to do in a second
05:06 - it's just very much easier to build it
05:08 - out first on with it being just ended
05:11 - standard position with its zero rotation
05:13 - and then rotate it afterwards so now
05:17 - let's make this completely white and
05:18 - it's also change the font size to
05:20 - something like 18 and then let's change
05:23 - the background I want the background to
05:25 - be kind of grey blue and a bit
05:29 - transparent as well so we'll just add a
05:31 - bit of transparency there and I want it
05:33 - to be kind of like what you see down
05:36 - here but I don't want to just copy the
05:39 - colour you can do that but I want to be
05:41 - able to just fine-tune it here because
05:43 - you might need it to be more or less
05:45 - visible than what you have down here
05:47 - awesome so I kind of like the look of
05:49 - this so what we'll do is take our
05:51 - secondary button here delete it we call
05:54 - this one our upgrade button and we'll
05:56 - duplicate this that and call this one
05:58 - cell and we'll change the text in here
06:01 - to cell and the amount here to something
06:06 - like 50 so this is already looking
06:09 - pretty good what we can then do is find
06:13 - our buttons here and drag these up
06:15 - because I want to be very very clear
06:18 - that this UI relates to this particular
06:20 - turn so let's make a small little arrow
06:24 - that points down towards that turn to do
06:27 - this we go under the canvas right click
06:29 - go UI and then image and let's change
06:32 - the image here to the drop down arrow
06:35 - and this is included with unity by
06:38 - default you can also find your own arrow
06:40 - on Google just make sure that you are
06:42 - free to use it or you could of course um
06:45 - easily make this in Photoshop or
06:48 - I'm just going to be using the default
06:50 - one here but you can do whatever you
06:52 - want I think this works pretty great the
06:53 - only thing is it isn't super high
06:56 - resolution you don't it's only 40 by 40
06:58 - so if you're really soo-min on this
07:00 - you're going to notice that but I think
07:02 - for what we're doing here it's going to
07:03 - be just fine
07:05 - awesome so I like the look of that and
07:08 - then I just want to tinned it a bit blue
07:11 - something like that and make it a bit
07:13 - transparent as well just kind of in line
07:16 - with the a layer with the other elements
07:19 - awesome and I'm going to rename this to
07:21 - arrow and what we can do now is pretty
07:24 - much position this correctly inside of
07:27 - our world space so let's switch out of
07:29 - 2d now and let's rotate this so as you
07:33 - can see my cat is turning in here look
07:35 - say hi hello yeah the light is blinding
07:40 - her awesome um so what we can do here is
07:43 - rotate this over and move it so that
07:46 - it's kind of in this 35 degree angle and
07:50 - pointing towards our turret because at
07:52 - the moment you can see it doesn't look
07:53 - super great so to do this on we can go
07:56 - and select our canvas and rotate this by
07:59 - 35 degrees and then we can easily offset
08:02 - this canvas because I know you I will
08:04 - stay at this position we can do whatever
08:06 - we want with this so let's now just move
08:09 - it over and maybe move it down a bit as
08:11 - well
08:12 - this way it points nicely towards our
08:15 - turret and it looks a lot better inside
08:18 - of our game view especially when we zoom
08:20 - in here so it puts it inside of our
08:23 - world in a really awesome way so cool so
08:27 - what we can also do is maybe I actually
08:29 - want to rotate this pipe even more I
08:32 - think now 35 is better all right let's
08:35 - stick with 30 35 but you can choose
08:37 - whatever and of course fine-tune this
08:40 - stuff I just jump over it very quickly
08:42 - to demonstrate it so let's now delete
08:45 - our standard turret and let's take our
08:47 - no UI here and move it to the top just
08:49 - so we can easily find it let's also take
08:52 - our event system and move it to
08:53 - bottom now I think everything is nicely
08:55 - grouped and what we can do is of course
08:58 - make this interactive so what we want to
09:00 - do is have some place that keeps track
09:03 - of what turn is currently selected in
09:05 - fact I wanted to work in such a way that
09:07 - we can only either have a chart selected
09:11 - that we want to build or have a chart
09:13 - selected in the world we don't want to
09:16 - have both things at once because it
09:18 - could quickly complicate our code and
09:20 - maybe even make it confusing for the
09:22 - user so what we'll do is implement this
09:24 - into the place where we select or where
09:27 - we keep track of what turd we want to
09:29 - build and we do that inside of our build
09:31 - manager so let's double click on that
09:33 - turbinate up in visual studio and we
09:36 - just want to add a few things in here
09:38 - it's not too complicated so at the arm
09:43 - place where we declare our variables you
09:45 - can see that we currently have a private
09:47 - chart blueprint code the chart to build
09:49 - in here we want to create a private node
09:52 - as well called the selected node you
09:55 - could also call it the selected turret
09:57 - whatever you want to do but I'm going to
09:59 - select the actual node here and then
10:02 - down here at the bottom you can see we
10:04 - have a function called select chart to
10:06 - build we want to just make a separate
10:08 - one here called select node which
10:11 - instead of taking in a turret is going
10:13 - to take in a node and it's just going to
10:16 - say set select the node equal to that
10:19 - note that this one that was passed in
10:22 - however because we want to only be able
10:24 - to have either a load or turret selected
10:27 - at one point or a to build we can
10:31 - easily go in here and set chart to build
10:32 - equal to null and go in here and set
10:35 - selected node equal to null this way
10:38 - when we enable one we disable the other
10:42 - great so this isn't actually implemented
10:45 - into the UI but it is implemented
10:49 - into the build manager which means that
10:52 - if we go ahead and actually call this
10:54 - select node inside of our node we should
10:56 - be able to see this working in the game
10:57 - so to do that we find our node scripts
11:01 - so just find that in here and you can
11:04 - see under the function called
11:05 - onmousedown with
11:07 - check do we are are we currently
11:09 - clicking a UI amending which case we
11:12 - just want to ignore it if we're not well
11:14 - then we want to make sure that we can
11:16 - actually build their that our build
11:17 - manager is ready to build and this is
11:20 - what I want to move down because we only
11:22 - want to do this regardless if we only
11:25 - want to do this in case there is no
11:27 - turret there so if there's no turret
11:29 - there we want to try to build so we want
11:31 - to make sure to check if we can build
11:33 - and if we can be called build manager
11:35 - that build turned on and we pass in this
11:37 - node so we you tell a build manager to
11:40 - build a chart here however what we want
11:43 - to change is this if statement so we say
11:45 - if the chart is not equal to null
11:48 - meaning if there's already a turd
11:50 - sitting on this object or on this node
11:53 - well so far we've just returned and said
11:55 - we can't build there what we want to do
11:58 - instead is simply select that node so on
12:00 - we do build manager and just like on
12:04 - selecting or building charts down here
12:06 - we go build manager dot select node and
12:09 - we pass in ourselves so when we sit when
12:12 - we click on that node and if it has some
12:14 - sense something selected we're going to
12:16 - select that node awesome so the way that
12:19 - we can see this working in the game
12:20 - right away is if we hit play you can see
12:23 - currently right off the bat we don't
12:25 - have any hover animation if we then
12:28 - select one of these charts let's just
12:29 - select the first one we do have a hover
12:31 - animation and we can do we can keep on
12:34 - choosing these and it's the same with
12:36 - the other one so now we have this one
12:38 - selected we still have a hover animation
12:40 - but if I now select one of the charts
12:42 - say this one that harbor animation
12:45 - disappears and that's because we
12:47 - currently don't have a turret to build
12:48 - selected we have this node selected and
12:51 - the way that we can actually see this is
12:54 - if we just go over to our inspector
12:56 - select our game master and change from
13:00 - normal to debug mode on the inspector we
13:03 - can see that under our build manager the
13:05 - selected node it's in despite it being a
13:08 - private variable because we're inside of
13:10 - our debug mode we can actually see it
13:12 - and we can see that it points to node 37
13:15 - so if we now click that
13:18 - and go here you can see that is that
13:20 - turd and if we select a game master you
13:23 - can see that that are variable updates
13:25 - as we select the different turrets so it
13:28 - is actually working but it's not really
13:30 - being showed anywhere and this is where
13:33 - our UI
13:34 - comes in so what we want to do now is
13:37 - kind of create a script on a node UI
13:39 - that is responsible for while hooking up
13:42 - our upgrade and sewed buttons are at a
13:45 - later point but for now we want this to
13:47 - be able to move around the UI and hide
13:50 - it when it's not necessary so let's
13:52 - create a node UI script like this and
13:57 - let's double click this to open it up as
13:59 - well and I'm going to have to take a sip
14:01 - of water awesome and let's keep going so
14:08 - the first thing that we want is of
14:11 - course to keep track of what our current
14:12 - target is what is the node that is
14:14 - selected that we're displaying the UI
14:16 - for and to do that we just create a
14:20 - private variable here which we can call
14:22 - target and it's going to be of type node
14:25 - then we are going to have a public
14:27 - function a public board that is reserved
14:31 - for setting the target so we want to be
14:34 - able to call this on a build manager in
14:36 - here we want to whenever selecting a
14:38 - node we want to be able to have some
14:40 - kind of reference to our UI
14:41 - so we'll go something like on node UI
14:45 - and then we want to go dot and then on
14:49 - set target and then we want to pass in
14:53 - the node that is the time so in order to
14:56 - do this what we do is of course taking
14:58 - the parameter with that target and of
15:01 - course you don't want to call this
15:02 - target because then we don't know what
15:04 - is this target what is this target what
15:06 - you could do is then go this target
15:09 - which implies the field up here that is
15:11 - part of the class equals whatever passed
15:14 - in which is this one and this would work
15:17 - but what I like to do it instead is just
15:21 - rename this to underscore target so to
15:24 - make it very clear that this is passed
15:26 - in here and this is the variable that
15:28 - sits on the class just make sure you
15:30 - differentiate some people like
15:31 - doing really shorthand notation just
15:33 - writing tea there and you can do that as
15:36 - well
15:36 - just do whatever suits you awesome so we
15:40 - have now set that target and then we
15:42 - want to of course change our position so
15:44 - we can set our transform dot position
15:46 - equal to target dot and then get build
15:51 - position and the reason why we don't
15:53 - just use target that transformed up
15:55 - position is because that is the very
15:58 - center of our node and if we look at our
16:00 - notes here that is inside of the actual
16:02 - block and we don't want that we want it
16:04 - to be just at the top of a block where
16:07 - our actual turret is sitting so that is
16:11 - why we're using target dot get build
16:12 - position because that takes the center
16:14 - of a node and just offsets it with I
16:16 - believe it was point five cool
16:20 - so that should actually make our UI
16:23 - update and move around the screen so if
16:26 - we now go into a build manager and make
16:28 - a reference to this node UI and we are
16:32 - already calling the function here so we
16:33 - simply need to make this variable here
16:35 - accessible so let's go in here and
16:37 - create a public and we're going to make
16:42 - this of type node UI and call this one
16:44 - node UI
16:45 - and we can drag this in inside of the
16:47 - inspector we can reference that in the
16:49 - inspector so now no do I touch set
16:52 - target node it's going to go over here
16:54 - set the target and move the UI that's
16:58 - pretty much all we needed to do here so
17:00 - if we then go inside of our game master
17:03 - you can see we now have a field called
17:05 - node UI where we want to drag in our
17:07 - node UI cool and the selected node is
17:12 - assigned but it's not used not yet but
17:15 - it will be
17:15 - so let's now hit play and we should see
17:18 - that this just sits there for now but if
17:21 - we then go in here and build some
17:23 - different turrets and click on them the
17:26 - UI moves to show what what turret is
17:29 - currently selected and it does so
17:31 - beautifully so the next thing is of
17:34 - course disabling this UI whenever we
17:37 - have a turret to build selected then we
17:39 - want this to expire and what we also
17:42 - want to do is have some way of target
17:45 - this UI on and off because in case we
17:48 - have multiple charts like above each
17:49 - other the UI might get in the way and
17:52 - that's annoying so we want some way of
17:54 - toggling it off by plaguing clicking the
17:56 - turd once again in order to do this
17:59 - let's create a function in here called
18:01 - public void and then let's call that
18:04 - hyde and all we need to do here is have
18:07 - a reference to our canvas which sits
18:10 - under a node UI so that we can easily
18:12 - just enable and disable that it's the
18:15 - easiest thing to do so we'll have it be
18:17 - disabled by default and then we can go
18:19 - into a node you I create a I'll do this
18:22 - on top of everything else in public and
18:25 - we'll just make this a game object and
18:27 - we'll just call this UI what we then do
18:31 - in our height function is we go you I
18:33 - that's said active and we go false and
18:35 - inside of our set target of course we
18:38 - want to enable it again so we go UI
18:40 - that's it active and we go true awesome
18:44 - and then we need to call that height
18:45 - method inside of our build manager and
18:47 - if we of course do that whenever we
18:49 - select the chart to build so when we
18:51 - select a node we said we set a target
18:53 - and it's enabled again and whenever we
18:56 - select it to build we go node you i dot
18:59 - hide it's that easy so now we should see
19:04 - that we need to do that reference there
19:07 - so no do I and drag in the canvas there
19:10 - into the UI slot so if we now hit play
19:12 - we should see that it's disabled by
19:15 - default we do these three turrets and
19:17 - when we select one of them it appears
19:19 - and when we select one of the charts
19:21 - down here it is gone however we still
19:24 - have the issue where we can't really
19:26 - toggle it on and off and so the UI might
19:29 - obstruct the user from doing different
19:32 - things that he wants to do so in order
19:34 - to do that and that is a super thing the
19:36 - super simple thing is we just go in here
19:39 - and see if the note that we want to
19:42 - select so inside of a select method if
19:44 - the node passed in is equal to the
19:47 - already selected node well then we want
19:49 - to simply hide the UI and set the
19:52 - selected node equal to not so we say if
19:55 - our selected node node is equal to the
19:59 - that we passed in well then we want to
20:01 - deselect the note so we want to go
20:05 - deselect do you select node and then we
20:11 - turn out of that function and then we
20:13 - create our deselect node and I'm just
20:15 - going to make this public so that you
20:16 - can deselect notes from other places as
20:20 - well and we might want to do nodes here
20:24 - that's just two node so that if you have
20:28 - something that happens in your game say
20:29 - the user clicks on something else then
20:31 - you can easily go in here and deselect
20:33 - the node and all we want to do here is
20:36 - simply go selected node equals null and
20:40 - no UI dot
20:42 - hide and if you notice that's this exact
20:45 - same thing that we're doing down here so
20:47 - let's just turn that into this single
20:50 - function code so we'll just deselect the
20:52 - note awesome that that just makes
20:55 - everything really really simple um so I
21:00 - believe that was all we needed to do
21:03 - that was all the core functionality if
21:06 - we now just close that hit play we
21:11 - should see that if we go in here create
21:14 - some different turrets of different
21:16 - types that we're able to select these
21:19 - different turrets and if I double click
21:21 - of one of them it will hide it so I can
21:23 - toggle it on and off on the different
21:26 - turrets that's freaking awesome and we
21:28 - can go in here and build all the
21:30 - different charts and it will just work
21:31 - immediately because we are using the
21:33 - same central script which is our node
21:36 - script no matter what chart we're using
21:38 - and this is why I object oriented
21:40 - programming can be so strong it's
21:42 - because we can have this idea of
21:45 - different instances and different types
21:47 - even sharing another script sharing a
21:50 - type called the node awesome so on the
21:54 - last thing that I wanted to do is just
21:56 - create a quick little animation for
21:58 - whenever this UI element first appears
22:01 - so I think when it switches from one
22:03 - turn to another that's fine that it's
22:05 - just instant and when it's removed again
22:07 - I think it should be instant as well
22:09 - however when it is first introduced into
22:11 - the scene so the first time
22:13 - you select the chart or if you are say
22:16 - so here we have two turrets here we
22:19 - select one of them I want it to fade in
22:22 - and if we then go back in you can see
22:24 - it's removed again and then we select
22:26 - another one again I want it to fade in I
22:28 - don't want things to just magically
22:30 - appear so this is a very quick and easy
22:33 - thing to do all we need to do is utilize
22:35 - the fact that our canvas is only enabled
22:37 - um
22:39 - when all we want our UI to be on
22:41 - displayed so we simply create an
22:43 - animation here just in the exact same
22:46 - way that we did with our game over
22:47 - window that we'll play whenever this
22:49 - object is enabled so let's just enable
22:51 - it for now hit create go under your
22:53 - animation and let's rename this to node
22:57 - UI and all we need to do is add a canvas
23:01 - group add a canvas group here we'll set
23:04 - the Alpha equal and look she's
23:06 - disturbing again she wants to be on
23:08 - camera so Allah said so we have the
23:12 - canvas group here and let's move forward
23:14 - to say half saying actually I wanted to
23:20 - be there somewhere around here and so
23:23 - that's ten steps and we could do an
23:26 - alpha of zero and then we want to flip
23:29 - these two keyframes so that it will end
23:32 - at one and start at zero and then when
23:35 - we hit play now you can see that's just
23:36 - a very quick fading then we can find our
23:40 - animation find the node UI animation and
23:42 - just remove loop time so it doesn't loop
23:45 - let's also rename this from canvas to
23:47 - something more descriptive like node UI
23:50 - a canvas or just know you are is going
23:53 - to be fine
23:54 - awesome so I believe that was all we
23:58 - needed to do so now let's preview this
24:01 - in full-screen and hopefully it recorded
24:03 - my audio this time so oh of course we
24:06 - need to disable the canvas from the
24:08 - beginning here awesome you can automate
24:11 - that but it's fine I think we just do
24:13 - that ourselves so now we go in here we
24:16 - select some different turrets or build
24:19 - some different turrets here of different
24:20 - types we select one of them and you see
24:22 - it should seed quick defame it awesome
24:25 - it quickly shifts
24:26 - and then when it's removed again that's
24:28 - perfect and you can see it fades in once
24:30 - again the next time we do it
24:32 - so I think that is a really nice blend
24:35 - between snappy controls and a bit of
24:38 - animation in there just to make it look
24:41 - a bit cooler and I really like the fact
24:43 - that we have these opaque or if
24:45 - partially transparent buttons that
24:48 - allows us to see the action that is
24:50 - going on behind them as well so that is
24:54 - pretty much all I wanted to do the one
24:56 - thing that I kind of noticed here is
24:58 - just I want a bit more color in these
25:00 - two buttons here so let's just add that
25:03 - in just make them a bit brighter and I
25:06 - think that just looks a tiny bit cooler
25:08 - we want that really sci-fi a slick look
25:12 - which you only get by making things
25:15 - transparent and super vibrant awesome so
25:19 - that was pretty much all I wanted to
25:20 - show for this video I hope you enjoyed
25:22 - it and without further ado I will see
