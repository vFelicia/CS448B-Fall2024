00:00 - so everyone here's a video on making a a
00:02 - a replica if you don't know that that's
00:05 - a mobile game where you have to shoot
00:06 - out these pins in order to hit a circle
00:09 - and you can't hit your own pins because
00:11 - then you will die and the game will kind
00:13 - of start over this is a live stream
00:15 - recording and so I might pay attention
00:17 - to the chat once in a while but it's
00:19 - just a super fun little game and a lot
00:21 - of cool stuff to show so let me just
00:23 - show you how the game works here this is
00:25 - what we'll be making if I have play here
00:27 - we can see that we have this rotating
00:29 - circle and I can go ahead and shoot it
00:31 - to put these pins in it and it's
00:34 - basically just about putting it as many
00:36 - pins in here as possible
00:38 - and if you hit one of your own you can
00:40 - see what happens there so some some
00:43 - pretty fun effects and we might have a
00:45 - bit of collision error one once in a
00:47 - while but it's not the biggest thing we
00:49 - can talk about how to improve that later
00:50 - on in the stream so let's go ahead and
00:52 - create a new project queue to get
00:55 - started and I'm just going to go ahead
00:58 - and mark this as a 2d project put it in
01:00 - my projects folder where I have all my
01:02 - stuff it's very dear to me that folder
01:05 - and we can go ahead and name this
01:07 - something like a a replica and yeah I
01:12 - think that's going to be fine actually
01:13 - let's just put a space in there why not
01:16 - so a replica and we can go ahead and hit
01:18 - create project and it's just going to
01:20 - open up a totally empty unity project
01:22 - you're going to need basically nothing
01:24 - in order to follow this tutorial all
01:26 - you're going to need is a circle sprite
01:28 - if you wanted to look a bit better than
01:30 - using the standard knob which is very
01:32 - low resolution but I mean you can either
01:34 - make that yourself in Photoshop or
01:35 - or even paint actually because it's just
01:38 - a circle or go ahead and download one
01:40 - off the internet um also have a link in
01:43 - the description to the full project on
01:45 - github so now that we have our new
01:47 - project here let's go ahead and kind of
01:50 - sketch out what we want to happen in our
01:52 - scene first of all all we of course need
01:55 - a circle that is going to rotate all the
01:57 - time let's go ahead and create a new 2d
01:59 - object and make this a sprite let's
02:01 - reset the transform on that and this is
02:04 - where I'm going to be importing my
02:05 - circle so I'm just going to take my
02:07 - circle PSP here and that's just a simple
02:10 - Photoshop file you can use any kind of
02:12 - PNG just as long as
02:13 - has transparency you can see it's just a
02:15 - 256 by 256 white circle and that's all
02:19 - there is to it so I'm going to go in
02:20 - here and that's the sprite I'm going to
02:22 - then select that circle if you don't
02:24 - have a circle you can just use the knob
02:25 - but you will notice that it's very small
02:27 - and if you scale it up it's not going to
02:29 - look as good but I'm just going to
02:30 - select the circle here and this is 256
02:34 - so let's do point seven five on the X&Y
02:38 - just to scale it down a little bit we
02:41 - can also kind of move this up and let's
02:45 - change the background here to kind of a
02:48 - white a tiny bit of yellow actually just
02:52 - to make it feel a bit cuter than if we
02:54 - made it totally white that feels very
02:56 - cold so this is a bit better maybe even
03:00 - do it tiny bit more something like that
03:01 - looks pretty good then we can take our
03:04 - sprite here and make that totally black
03:07 - then we can rename this to something
03:09 - like rotator and by the way the
03:13 - shortcuts for renaming things and a lot
03:15 - of people don't know this on windows is
03:17 - f2 so I simply hit f2 there and I can go
03:19 - ahead and rename it it's a lot easier
03:21 - than right-clicking going rename or
03:23 - trying to double click on it or whatever
03:26 - and going over here just f2 use it all
03:28 - the time it works in the Windows
03:30 - Explorer as well and for Mac that's just
03:32 - space spaces renamed on Mac did I say
03:36 - space i man enter enter that space is
03:39 - not going to rename a thing cool
03:41 - so this is our rotator and of course a
03:43 - rotator it needs to rotate so in order
03:46 - to do that let's create a new component
03:48 - and let's go ahead and make this the
03:49 - rotator component we're going to program
03:52 - in C sharp here and let's just double
03:54 - click this to open it up in Visual
03:55 - Studio that's just a weird warning that
03:57 - I'm getting these days nothing to worry
03:59 - about it something with my settings that
04:01 - are being kind of weird actually just
04:04 - got done recording a video on on my
04:07 - different settings my setup with Visual
04:09 - Studio and unity so look up for that
04:11 - it's going to be out in like a couple of
04:13 - weeks I have a some other videos that I
04:16 - want to show first Oh like a single week
04:19 - is it yeah
04:22 - it's going to take a few weeks I'm sorry
04:23 - I have a full schedule ahead cool so
04:27 - what we can go ahead and do here now is
04:29 - we'll just believe it delete everything
04:31 - we'll create a public float and this is
04:34 - going to be our rotation speed we can
04:37 - just go ahead and call it speed and this
04:39 - is going to be degrees per second and
04:41 - we're just going to default that to
04:43 - something like 100 that means like
04:47 - pretty much a third of a rotation
04:49 - somewhere between a third and a fourth
04:51 - of a rotation per second and I think
04:54 - that's going to be fine then we can make
04:56 - the update method one more time here and
04:58 - in here we'll do something like trans
05:01 - transform
05:02 - dot rotate and we don't need to rotate
05:06 - around because the center of a circle is
05:08 - the center of a circle so it's just
05:09 - going to pivot around that and that's
05:11 - going to look fine
05:12 - and in here you can see there's a bunch
05:14 - of overrides for this we're just going
05:16 - to be using the one that allows us to
05:18 - specify three different or an angle on
05:22 - the three different axes so we'll do an
05:24 - X angle at Y angle and the V angle so
05:27 - we'll go through around the X zero on
05:29 - the Y and then around the Z we'll do
05:30 - speed and then multiply with time that
05:33 - Delta time because we're doing this in
05:34 - the update method and we have to make
05:36 - sure that it's not framerate dependent
05:38 - so that should actually already our work
05:41 - just fine so if we go ahead and hit play
05:42 - here now we should see that our model we
05:47 - can't really see it here because it's
05:48 - totally circular but if we select it we
05:50 - can see that it's indeed spinning and we
05:52 - can control the speed through this
05:54 - variable here so we can bump that up or
05:56 - slow it down cool so that is on the
06:00 - basis of our game that's kind of the
06:02 - pivot for everything so now we can go
06:04 - ahead and add a new component and this
06:06 - is going to be a circle Collider 2d and
06:08 - just make sure it's the same size as
06:10 - your graphic here which is going to be
06:12 - by default for me here I can see and I
06:16 - believe that's pretty much all we need
06:18 - to do for rotator we could also just go
06:20 - out and tag it as rotator on right away
06:23 - so on that we can easily check if that's
06:26 - what we hit at a later point so let's
06:27 - just go ahead and add a new tag here
06:29 - create a new tag called rotator and
06:32 - let's select it and tag it as that
06:35 - okay you're tagged there we go and I'm
06:38 - just going to save it here saying it
06:40 - save it as level one or main level I'm
06:42 - just going to do main level here oops
06:44 - yeah this is not where I want to save it
06:47 - there we go main level and it's save on
06:49 - that and you can see the period down
06:51 - there again you can of course make
06:54 - multiple multiple levels just have some
06:58 - way of keeping track of how many pins
07:00 - you want to have in each level and once
07:02 - all of them are in the rotator once all
07:05 - of them have hit the circle you can go
07:07 - ahead and transition to the next one
07:08 - we're just going to do it more high
07:10 - score based on this one so yeah cool so
07:15 - now we can go ahead and create our pin
07:16 - and in order to do that we'll
07:18 - right-click on your hierarchy code 2d
07:20 - object and then stripe and again we need
07:23 - to select some kind of source sprite
07:25 - here I'm just going to go for the circle
07:27 - and I'm going to make this quite a bit
07:29 - ah smaller so let's just take it here
07:32 - drag it down a little bit make sure it's
07:34 - zero on the X here and let's definitely
07:38 - scale this down quite a bit something
07:40 - like that actually looks pretty good and
07:43 - then we can go ahead and create another
07:45 - sprite beneath this so let's go again
07:47 - right click to the object sprite and for
07:50 - this one we're just going to select the
07:52 - UI sprite and this is just a square
07:54 - sprite but it actually looks just fine
07:57 - if we go ahead and kind of drag it up
07:59 - here in order to create whoops in order
08:02 - to create kind of a small sphere out of
08:05 - it I don't know the terminology that we
08:08 - should be using here but I think Spears
08:10 - just fine and we can go ahead and make
08:11 - this totally black as well so you can
08:13 - see what that does and we might need to
08:15 - just make it a tiny bit wider I think
08:19 - that looks a bit better just to kind of
08:21 - equal it to a one or two pixels
08:24 - something fairly simple I'm going to go
08:26 - ahead and drag this out as well
08:27 - something like that looks pretty good
08:31 - and we can always adjust the length of
08:33 - this and the size of the head and stuff
08:35 - like that at a later point when I will
08:37 - just have it somewhere around this so we
08:40 - call this one the sphere and we'll
08:42 - called the circle itself the pin and
08:45 - make sure that they are parented so that
08:47 - they will follow each other
08:49 - so that when we spawn up in our spear
08:51 - it's going to move a with it cold so now
08:55 - we can add some colliders so to our spew
08:57 - here we of course want to add some kind
08:59 - of box Collider 2d and we don't want
09:02 - this to collide with our with our circle
09:06 - on the pin on our spearhead here so what
09:09 - we want to do is go edit Collider and
09:11 - then simply drag this down a bit
09:13 - so that it doesn't collide and also drag
09:16 - this in so that it's right at the tip of
09:19 - our off my pin here cool so stop editing
09:23 - that colliding that looks good
09:25 - we can then take our pin here and add a
09:27 - circle Collider to this one as well
09:29 - there we go and I think that's pretty
09:33 - much all we need to adjust here we could
09:36 - go ahead and Mark some of this as on
09:38 - triggers and the question is whether or
09:41 - not we want to do that I think actually
09:43 - we might want to go ahead and do that
09:46 - but I'm just going to think about that a
09:48 - little bit we definitely want to add a
09:50 - rigidbody here so rigidbody 2d and we
09:53 - want to make this kinematic now so that
09:56 - it won't move on its own
09:58 - yeah I think that's it for our pin
10:02 - actually let's go ahead and mark this
10:03 - one as a trigger and let's actually do
10:07 - the same thing for our sphere here the
10:10 - thing that's going to be best
10:12 - so mark both colliders as triggers but
10:15 - we only want to tag our pin as a pin but
10:18 - we'll have a look at that in a second so
10:20 - now let's go ahead and create the
10:21 - functionality for kind of shooting this
10:24 - forward into our center circle and I'll
10:28 - just have a look in the chat here just
10:30 - to see if you guys are still out there
10:32 - yep everything's looking good awesome
10:40 - cool so let's go to a pin here let's
10:45 - create a new component and it's called
10:47 - it something like well we can just call
10:49 - it pin and hit create an ad make sure
10:52 - you selected C sharp again double click
10:54 - it and it's going to open up in Visual
10:55 - Studio so now we can go ahead and remove
10:59 - our two functions and again we'll have
11:01 - some public float
11:02 - with VP here and I'm just going to set
11:04 - this to something like it's actually
11:07 - hard um 20 probably something around
11:11 - that and we also want a reference to a
11:14 - rigidbody so we'll go ahead and create a
11:16 - rigidbody 2d and call it RB so these two
11:20 - things are configured in the inspector
11:21 - so we don't need to do any get component
11:23 - or anything like that then we can inside
11:25 - of our update method we can move our pin
11:28 - forward so we'll go ahead and say RB dot
11:31 - move position and this allows us to move
11:33 - the rigidbody to a new position while
11:36 - still checking for its physics so have
11:38 - we collided with something is there any
11:40 - kind of physics calculations that we
11:42 - need to do and if all that is it's cool
11:46 - it's going to go ahead and move the
11:47 - rigidbody so it's a lot better to use
11:50 - and transform the translate because
11:52 - that's not going to work well with
11:53 - collisions and of course it just shoots
11:56 - the object to the desired position so we
11:59 - need to move it a little bit at a time
12:01 - and that means that we'll have to take
12:03 - our current position which we can get by
12:05 - using our B dot position and then we
12:09 - want to add some vector onto that and
12:12 - the reason why I'm using our B dub
12:14 - position here is that this will actually
12:15 - return us a 2-dimensional vector you can
12:19 - see here in vector 2 storing our current
12:21 - position where the Z is just 0 however
12:23 - if we use transform that position this
12:26 - is going to give us a vector 3 that's
12:28 - not what we want we want to only work
12:29 - with make the twos here because we in a
12:31 - 2d coordinate system so we can go ahead
12:33 - and hit Plus here and we can say
12:35 - something like vector 2 dot up that's
12:38 - the direction we want to move in then we
12:40 - can multiply that with our speed how far
12:42 - do we want to move each frame is going
12:44 - to be determined how add by how big or
12:48 - speed is and then we can multiply with
12:50 - time.deltatime again to make sure that
12:52 - we even out differences in framerate so
12:55 - we can go ahead and save this now and
12:57 - then we should see and the way to test
13:00 - this is actually by okay so we need to
13:03 - drag in the rigidbody forgot about that
13:05 - we need to go out and hit play but if we
13:07 - just do that it's just going to kind of
13:09 - disappear and go right past a rotator
13:12 - and the reason for that is if we
13:15 - posited and hit play it's going to have
13:18 - time to kind of load everything in and
13:20 - then it's not going to lag right in the
13:22 - beginning gears you can see now much
13:24 - move the movement and that actually
13:25 - looks pretty good speed wise you can of
13:27 - course mess around with that so now we
13:29 - need to add an on trigger method that
13:32 - will kind of see if we've collided
13:34 - something check for a collision and if
13:37 - we have we're going to go ahead and
13:39 - we'll stop the pin right there
13:42 - because then we've hit our rotator and
13:44 - we want to parent it to a rotator so
13:47 - that it will both follow the rotators
13:49 - rotation so now if you go into visual
13:52 - studio will create a void on trigger
13:55 - enter 2d and we of course want to gather
13:59 - a bit of information about what we hit
14:01 - um so we'll go up here and say we want
14:05 - to have some information about our 2d
14:08 - collider that we hit we call this
14:10 - information coal and will say that if
14:12 - cold
14:13 - tag is equal to rotator so if whatever
14:17 - we hit has a tag of rotator then we can
14:22 - of course know that we should be pinned
14:24 - so we we've hit the circle and we want
14:27 - to stop our forward movement we want to
14:29 - parent it and everything is good so yeah
14:32 - so let's go up here and create some kind
14:34 - of private boolean and we will call this
14:37 - something like is pinned and will
14:40 - default that to false and we only want
14:42 - to move forward if we append so we're
14:44 - going here and say if we are not pinned
14:47 - so if is not pinned we will move our
14:50 - position this way to stop us from moving
14:54 - forward forward all we have to do is say
14:56 - is pinned equals true there we go so now
15:00 - we should actually stop moving and we
15:03 - should be able to see the effect of this
15:04 - immediately of course we need to pause
15:06 - it here and you can see that once we hit
15:08 - the circle it just stops so that's
15:11 - awesome the next thing that we need to
15:13 - do is also parented to a rotator and we
15:18 - don't need a reference to a rotator
15:19 - because if the tack or if the colliders
15:22 - tag is equal to rotator that means that
15:24 - our collider is indeed the rotator and
15:27 - so we can just go and say
15:29 - transform strands one dot set parent and
15:33 - the parent that we want is set it to is
15:35 - the cold dot transform there we go
15:39 - and it's actually that easy it's pretty
15:41 - impressive so now we can just say play
15:43 - again I'm just going to pause it right
15:44 - off the bat here to make sure it there's
15:46 - no lag then we can stop and you can see
15:48 - we already have the basic game mechanic
15:50 - in place it's going to hit the thing and
15:53 - rotate around with it so yeah really fun
15:55 - and easy thing to do cool so I'll just
16:02 - have a look in the chat here to see if
16:04 - everything's good
16:05 - hello everyone just joining that's
16:07 - awesome I think we are breaking like
16:09 - viewer rickets or something right now
16:11 - that's so much fun I'm really happy to
16:13 - see all of you guys in here um you're
16:15 - gonna have a lot of fun we only just
16:17 - just getting started no really that's it
16:20 - this is like most of it but don't I
16:23 - couldn't say that ignore that part stay
16:26 - tuned for the most awesome part which is
16:28 - probably the end screen actually that is
16:30 - really fun anyways I'm getting
16:32 - sidetracked here so so now we are kind
16:35 - of able to control our pin moving
16:39 - forward and we are able to kind of pin
16:41 - it to our circle but we still need to be
16:44 - able to spawn these at will so to do
16:47 - that we'll go back into unity and we'll
16:50 - kind of create a prefab out of this pin
16:52 - but let's actually also have a small
16:55 - graphic you displaying from where we're
16:57 - going to shoot this pin so let's just
16:59 - duplicate it and let's remove the sphere
17:01 - and let's also just make I kind of
17:04 - disabled this previous pin just for a
17:06 - second here let's rename this to
17:08 - something like pin spawn point and we
17:11 - can maybe bump down the Alpha a tiny bit
17:14 - something like that looks a bit better
17:16 - we can remove the collider the rigidbody
17:19 - the script is just going to be an empty
17:22 - object just a tiny bit of graphics to
17:25 - let us know that this is where our pin
17:27 - will shoot from so now we can take our
17:29 - pin from before we can drag it down into
17:31 - the project and boom we have a prefab
17:33 - out of it so we can delete it from our
17:35 - scene now and we can go ahead and add
17:37 - some kind of spawner excuse me so the
17:40 - way we'll do this is selectively
17:42 - in spawnpoint will hit add component and
17:44 - will create a spawner so that's double
17:48 - click that to open it up in Visual
17:49 - Studio and buying bang bang you're going
17:54 - to open reload all like an open come on
17:57 - there we go so in here we of course now
18:01 - need a reference to our prefabs that
18:03 - will create some public game object
18:05 - we're going to call this one or pin
18:08 - three Pat will also create like um let's
18:13 - see what else are we going to need I
18:15 - think that's basically all we're going
18:17 - to need actually so let's just go ahead
18:19 - and create a board update method and in
18:22 - here we'll check if the user has pressed
18:24 - whatever fire button you want
18:26 - so we'll just go if input get button
18:29 - down and the button that we want to look
18:31 - for if you want it to be spaced you'll
18:33 - type in jump like this that befall to
18:36 - space in unity if you want to use the
18:38 - mouse you can use fire one I'm going to
18:41 - do that so that's the left click and
18:43 - it's going to fire and in here we'll do
18:46 - something like spawn pin and then we'll
18:49 - go ahead and create that method of
18:50 - course so that means in here we'll say
18:52 - void spawn pin and to spawn it all the
18:56 - do is say instantiate what we want to
18:58 - instantiate is the pin prefab where do
19:01 - we want to instantiate it well our
19:03 - current position so let's transform top
19:05 - position and with our current rotation
19:07 - so transform dot rotation and that's not
19:12 - transform it's transform there we go so
19:15 - save that and it should actually be that
19:18 - simple it's almost too good to be true
19:20 - but yeah should be fine so let's go
19:24 - ahead and now take our pin prefab drag
19:27 - it into the slot hit play and now we
19:29 - should be able to spawn these things
19:31 - yeah it's looking like a game look
19:34 - that's awesome of course you have no way
19:37 - of dying yet and we have no score so
19:40 - it's a very boring game but it is a game
19:42 - I can see that everything looks to be a
19:44 - bit too far up so we'll just take our
19:46 - rotator and spawn point here and move
19:49 - both of them down a little bit something
19:51 - like that is probably going to be better
19:53 - we want it to be pretty close to the
19:55 - same
19:55 - in order to create the best effect I
19:57 - think and ways of making this harder is
19:59 - of course making this more narrow the
20:02 - larger you make it the more room there
20:04 - is you can also move this point here
20:07 - further away from the circle or make
20:09 - them shoot at a lower speed there's lots
20:13 - of stuff that you can adjust in order to
20:14 - vary the different levels or you can
20:17 - simply make it rotate faster which is
20:19 - always going to be more difficult so
20:20 - lots of fun variables that you can tweak
20:23 - here I mean we could just go ahead and
20:24 - move our spawn point here all the way
20:26 - down here and it's going to be much
20:27 - harder to time I say that and then I'm a
20:32 - god oh I hit that one yeah I was going
20:35 - to get cocky someone knew I was going to
20:37 - do that why can't all right so that's
20:42 - kind of beyond the base mechanics and
20:44 - then it's just about checking for your
20:46 - coalition doing an end screen and of
20:48 - course we also kind of want to vary the
20:51 - rotation a bit because right now it's
20:52 - just moving at a constant thing so um
20:56 - yes since I was a water have a look at
20:59 - the chat and for those of you I'm asking
21:07 - general questions I will go ahead and
21:09 - have a Q&A at the end of the stream so
21:11 - just hold on to those for just a moment
21:13 - and yeah did you do - every time you
21:21 - stick a pin in it it speeds up that's
21:23 - super easy to do every time you shoot it
21:25 - spins the opposite way that's just as
21:27 - easy to do all you really need to do for
21:29 - this is just one inside of our pin
21:33 - script here we can now go ahead and
21:34 - access the rotator script so we can just
21:37 - go Cole dot getcomponent
21:39 - and then get the rotator component here
21:42 - and then we can modify the speed
21:43 - variable directly so we could like say
21:46 - add 50 on to that and now it's going to
21:50 - move 50 degrees faster per second per
21:55 - pin so you can see here oh that's going
21:57 - to speed up quickly
21:58 - it's probably a bit too hard and if we
22:01 - wanted to like um if you wanted to make
22:05 - it move into the opposite direction we
22:07 - would simply do a times equal
22:09 - negative one so now we should be able to
22:12 - just slip it
22:14 - I believe my math and programming is
22:17 - correct here yeah there you go
22:18 - hey that's actually really fun it's a
22:22 - good one
22:24 - it confuses my brain so there's just so
22:27 - many ways to really really easily
22:29 - configure this I'm just going to go
22:30 - ahead and remove that because I have
22:31 - some other things planned with the speed
22:34 - that I'm going to show you in a sec
22:35 - which is really cool
22:38 - but first let's let's go ahead and
22:40 - create kind of the end screen thing also
22:45 - someone asks what's the meaning of the
22:47 - f' after the numbers so putting an f'
22:50 - after a number simply indicates that
22:52 - this number is a float and in most
22:55 - context this is not really going to
22:57 - matter for example here public float
23:01 - speed equals 20 we could just go ahead
23:03 - and remove the the F there and we've
23:05 - already written float so it knows that
23:07 - it's a float but some methods might need
23:10 - it if you're saying 20 / this is a bad
23:16 - example 3 divided by 2 now right now
23:20 - this is actually an integer division and
23:22 - that means this is going to come up with
23:24 - a whole number it's going to force it
23:26 - into a whole number but if we go and put
23:28 - an F here on these two numbers it's
23:30 - going to come up with a decimal place
23:32 - number so it's just a good habit of
23:34 - always putting an F whenever you want to
23:36 - deal with decimals just always do it and
23:39 - it's always going to work if you only do
23:42 - it sometimes you are eventually going to
23:44 - run into problems so that's why I'll
23:45 - just instantly put an F there cool yeah
23:51 - so yes that's great the end screen so in
23:55 - order to do that we need to register if
23:57 - we hit another pin and to do that we can
24:00 - simply mark our different pins with a
24:02 - tag and then inside of our
24:04 - ontriggerenter method check for that tag
24:06 - so first we check if the on tag is equal
24:09 - to rotator and then we can say else if
24:11 - so if it's if it's not equal to rotator
24:14 - we want to check if called that tag is
24:17 - equal to pin for example and then if it
24:20 - is well then we want to go ahead and end
24:22 - the game
24:23 - so we can create some kind of endgame
24:25 - mechanic here for now we'll just go
24:28 - ahead and through our debug the dog
24:29 - saying something like and game just to
24:33 - see if this is working then what we can
24:35 - do is go into unity here take our pin go
24:39 - to tag hit add tag add a new tag called
24:42 - pin and we're just going to add that
24:45 - here you don't want to change the speed
24:48 - there's really no reason to do that just
24:51 - a pin so now we can go ahead and hit
24:52 - play and we should see that if we hit
24:55 - two pins on top of each other
24:57 - boom it's going to say end game and it
24:59 - actually did that three times which I'm
25:02 - not sure why that's kind of weird so I
25:08 - see why it's doing it two times because
25:11 - both objects are going to be checking
25:14 - for it but three times this is a little
25:17 - weird
25:17 - might be just some coincidences for the
25:21 - way that it might be because these
25:24 - colliders are actually checking for it
25:26 - as well if we go ahead and and Mark are
25:29 - our spear here as a non trigger are well
25:33 - then it's not really going to yeah it's
25:36 - not going to work so but this is
25:38 - actually not too important well it does
25:40 - it one time or three times because we'll
25:43 - just implement some way of checking if
25:45 - the game is already ended and if it has
25:47 - we won't end it again sort of say so
25:50 - we'll just add a small mechanic there
25:52 - it's super simple so we won't worry
25:54 - about that but instead of ending the
25:56 - game in here it's better to separate it
25:58 - out in a game manager and to do that
26:02 - let's just go in here and let's put it
26:04 - on the main camera we could also put it
26:06 - on a separate object and we'll rename or
26:08 - name the script game manager and we'll
26:11 - double click it and this is going to be
26:13 - a very simple script really all it's
26:15 - going to do is the actual game ending so
26:18 - this is also where you would probably
26:20 - transition to a new level but in our
26:22 - case we'll just have some public void
26:24 - called
26:25 - end game and for now we'll just again
26:28 - throw a debug the log statements in here
26:30 - saying end game and we can call this
26:33 - through the
26:34 - script but of course you only want to do
26:35 - that one so in here we'll just create a
26:37 - private poll saying something like game
26:41 - has ended said that to default to false
26:45 - by default then in here we check if game
26:48 - has ended if it has we're just going to
26:50 - return out that method and not do
26:51 - anything else and if it has not has not
26:54 - will say well now the game has indeed
26:56 - ended so that will make sure that we'll
26:58 - only call this once then inside of our
27:00 - pin in order to access that method we
27:03 - could create a reference by using some
27:04 - kind of single singleton pattern and I
27:07 - do recommend you do that I should
27:08 - actually make a video on Singleton's now
27:10 - that I'm thinking about it but until
27:12 - then bear with me that's plenty of
27:14 - resources for creating Singleton's but a
27:18 - much easier way is just using fine
27:20 - object of type we want to find the game
27:22 - manager and then going dot endgame there
27:25 - we go super fast not as performant but
27:28 - really only going to be doing this once
27:30 - per I wait for a single frame and then
27:33 - the game is going to be start so it's
27:35 - totally alright so we'll just go in here
27:37 - and hit play and we should see now that
27:40 - we can end the game but only one so
27:42 - let's try this ah there we go so you see
27:45 - only one in-game call and no matter how
27:48 - many times they're doing now it's not
27:50 - going to work
27:50 - cool that's exactly what we wanted to do
27:53 - so the next thing is are disabling our
27:56 - rotator and spawner so that our circle
27:59 - stops rotating and so that we can't put
28:01 - in any more pins after the game is ended
28:03 - and the way to do that is well we just
28:05 - need a reference to those objects and we
28:07 - can disable them super easily so let's
28:10 - create a public rotator and call this
28:14 - one rotator let's also create a public
28:16 - spawner and call this one spawner and
28:19 - all we need to do when we end the game
28:21 - instead of writing a debug that log
28:23 - statement will say rotator dot enabled
28:27 - equals false and spawner dot enabled
28:30 - equals oh cool
28:33 - so that should pretty much be it and now
28:36 - we of course need to reference these so
28:37 - let's put in a rotator put in our pin
28:41 - spawn point and hit play and now we
28:44 - should see that if we go ahead and lose
28:47 - the game here bone everything stops and
28:51 - I can't click anymore
28:52 - the game isn't past it's still playing
28:54 - at the same time so that's awesome so we
28:56 - can still do cool animations or whatever
28:58 - we want to do GUI or whatever but
29:01 - there's no more real gameplay going on
29:04 - because our 2 gameplay controlling
29:06 - scripts are both or disabled awesome so
29:12 - the next thing that I wanted to show you
29:13 - is how you can display a cold animation
29:17 - that makes this feel a lot better
29:20 - because just stopping the game and then
29:22 - restarting it it's not too rewarding you
29:25 - want even though losing the game sucks
29:28 - if you want to leave how to have it suck
29:31 - in a cool way something that maybe swims
29:34 - in on the action lets you know what you
29:36 - did wrong maybe emphasizes on the motion
29:38 - and then restarts it so always make sure
29:43 - to give you a player really clear
29:45 - feedback on what's happening in the game
29:47 - especially on things that he could
29:49 - improve on so let's go ahead and create
29:51 - a public animator and this is because
29:55 - whenever we want to play an animation we
29:57 - need a reference to the animator and
29:59 - then on down here we'll go ahead and
30:02 - play something on that animator so we'll
30:04 - go animator dot set trigger and we
30:09 - haven't created this trigger yet but
30:10 - basically we'll create a trigger called
30:12 - something like and game there we go so
30:17 - let's go ahead and actually create this
30:19 - so you can see now of course on our main
30:21 - camera we now need a reference to the
30:23 - animator in order to do that let's
30:25 - create an animator and in order to
30:27 - create an animator we can just create an
30:29 - animation and the animator will be
30:30 - created for us so let's select the main
30:33 - camera and let's hit create a new
30:35 - animation if you don't have the
30:36 - animation window you can always go a
30:38 - window and then our animation there
30:42 - control six and hit create and let's
30:46 - actually make a new folder for this just
30:48 - a tiny bit organized call this one
30:50 - animation and let's
30:54 - called the atom itself something like
30:57 - idle or default or start or whatever and
31:01 - this is just going to have our default
31:03 - settings in our case that's going to be
31:05 - a kind of white sky box and let's create
31:08 - a pre for if a key frame with that you
31:12 - know what to do that I simply move
31:14 - forward my timeline a tiny bit I change
31:17 - it to a different color and I remove
31:19 - that keyframe and you can see it's
31:21 - created a keyframe down here with our
31:23 - beginning with our start settings so
31:25 - that's awesome we can also just move the
31:27 - size a bit here and we'll set it back to
31:29 - 5 and now those two things are now
31:32 - keyframed with a default of 5 and this
31:35 - whitish color then we can create another
31:38 - animation clip and this one will called
31:41 - in-game and in here we can go ahead and
31:44 - change the color so we'll do kind of a
31:47 - purplish red make it a bit more red than
31:50 - that something like that is it's kind of
31:52 - because that they use in the game and
31:54 - will also swim in on it so we'll have a
31:56 - size of something like 2.4 something
31:59 - like that just to cut off the spawn
32:02 - point here and really focus on what's
32:03 - going on with the circle and that looks
32:07 - a lot better I think and then what we
32:08 - can do is we can kind of scrub through
32:10 - the animation and then add say the zero
32:14 - thirty point here we can go ahead and
32:17 - move out the side so we'll just have it
32:19 - kind of zoom out again I think that's
32:21 - going to the code so we'll have
32:22 - something like that yeah that looks
32:25 - pretty neat and we can just go ahead and
32:29 - stop recording and of course right now
32:33 - we haven't created a transition between
32:34 - the two animations but the really cool
32:37 - thing about unities making them is that
32:39 - once you're adjusting parameters like
32:41 - this it'll just go ahead and blend them
32:43 - nicely on its own so it will actually go
32:46 - ahead and create a nice transition from
32:47 - our idle which looks like this to our
32:50 - end game which is like this without us
32:52 - touching anything so that's super cool
32:54 - so all we need to do in order to enable
32:57 - that is select our main camera go to the
32:59 - animator window and the animator is
33:02 - again found on a window
33:03 - and then animator and you need to make
33:06 - sure that your default our animation
33:09 - here is idle if the animations aren't in
33:11 - here you can just go ahead and drag them
33:13 - in like that I'm just going to delete
33:14 - that and if it's not set to default you
33:16 - can always right click and hit set layer
33:18 - as default state and you can see it
33:20 - turning orange so let's do that to our
33:22 - idle let's right-click hit make
33:24 - transition and um of course we don't
33:26 - want this to transition immediately we
33:28 - only wanted this to transition whenever
33:30 - a condition is met that condition being
33:33 - whenever the trigger endgame is set
33:36 - remember in our code we recalled set
33:39 - trigger and then we specified endgame so
33:42 - all we need to do now is go under our
33:44 - parameters here add a new trigger and
33:46 - call that one end game and make sure
33:49 - that you spell it the exact same way
33:50 - also with capital letters and stuff like
33:52 - that or it's not going to work then for
33:55 - a transition here we go ahead and add a
33:56 - new condition and make sure that you
33:59 - select the end game condition so now
34:01 - whenever this is triggered it's going to
34:04 - transition to the end game however right
34:06 - now it's going to wait for idle to
34:08 - finish its animation so let's just go
34:10 - ahead and click this and then disabled
34:12 - has exit time let's also take our end
34:15 - game animation and disable loop time
34:17 - because we don't want that to loop we
34:19 - only want it to play once now we should
34:21 - actually already be able to hit play go
34:24 - select our main camera and now in our
34:26 - animator just trigger it and you can see
34:29 - the animation playing and just how cool
34:31 - that looks
34:32 - however we of course also trigger this
34:34 - through script so let's just go ahead
34:35 - and hit play through the script here and
34:37 - now once we hit two of these together
34:41 - of course we need to also assign the
34:44 - animator so we'll just drag in the
34:45 - animator right there so we needed to do
34:48 - that's why we got in all your friends
34:49 - exception so let's try that one more
34:52 - time let's go ahead and die here and you
34:54 - can see how cool that looks actually
34:57 - wanted to zoom it out a bit more I think
34:59 - so that's going to our end game and game
35:01 - here have a kind of transition for a bit
35:04 - longer and it's also set the sides
35:06 - actually maybe just back to 5 I think
35:09 - it's going to look pretty cool let's see
35:11 - what that looks like
35:13 - and you can see just how easy it is to
35:15 - adjust the settings on this I think that
35:17 - looks really cool actually but I do want
35:19 - it to be faster I think
35:20 - 0:30 arm works better so I will just
35:24 - stick to that and as always spend more
35:25 - time on this stuff than I do so I'll
35:27 - take a sip of water now before I kill my
35:32 - voice completely let's have a look in
35:34 - the chat how are you guys doing um let's
35:39 - see
35:40 - why not stream on YouTube instead of
35:41 - twitch well I've considered streaming on
35:43 - YouTube because well I have a lot more
35:46 - followers there um and the thing is I
35:50 - really liked which I think twitch is
35:54 - just really nice I really like the
35:56 - community here and like a lot of the
35:58 - features I'm not a big fan of YouTube
36:00 - streaming features but if none of you
36:03 - guys want me to I definitely just go
36:05 - ahead and stream on YouTube it's it's
36:07 - not me who should decide it really so
36:09 - it's it's up to the people I guess and
36:11 - of course I always upload the video to
36:14 - YouTube as well so kinda doesn't make a
36:17 - difference because you'll get the video
36:19 - anyways but yeah just not reasoning on
36:22 - that uh yeah everything else is saying
36:26 - looking good awesome
36:29 - so um now that we have these gameplay
36:33 - elements in place it's really just about
36:36 - kind of fine-tuning it one thing that
36:40 - you would definitely want to do is as
36:42 - soon as we end our game and the
36:44 - animation stops playing we want to
36:46 - transition to either a new scene or the
36:50 - same scene in our case we just want to
36:52 - restart the level the player has failed
36:54 - and we want him to know that you could
36:57 - also go ahead and display the score here
36:58 - you could make him I don't know we try a
37:02 - different level to say high scores
37:06 - something like that we'll just go ahead
37:07 - and restart to see in order to do that
37:09 - let's go into our game manager and let's
37:11 - create another public method so public
37:14 - void and we'll call this something like
37:16 - restart level and all we need to do
37:19 - remember to restart a level is make sure
37:21 - that we have unity engine dot scene
37:24 - management included
37:26 - and then we need to go scene manager dot
37:29 - load scene and the scene we want to load
37:32 - is are currently active scene and we get
37:34 - that by saying scene manager dot get
37:37 - active scene and then dot build index
37:41 - whoops there we go
37:43 - so that should actually restart our
37:45 - level however we still need to call that
37:47 - function at the appropriate time one way
37:50 - would be to go in here and create a Co
37:52 - routine that waits X amount of settings
37:54 - before restarting the level so that we
37:56 - give the animated time to play but a
37:58 - better way is using a Unity animations
38:02 - events so Unity animation events
38:05 - basically allows us to specify any time
38:07 - during an animation whether it's created
38:10 - in unity or imported from some 3d
38:12 - modeling software where we want to UM
38:14 - call a function and in our case that's
38:18 - going to be right at the end where our
38:20 - animation has stopped playing to add an
38:22 - event simply set your timeline or your
38:24 - marker here to wherever you want to add
38:26 - it and then click the add event and then
38:29 - you can select the event here and change
38:31 - settings on it in our case we want to
38:33 - select the restart level function and
38:35 - you can see that this is accessible
38:37 - because it sits on the same object that
38:40 - are animated does make sure that it does
38:43 - that so now that we've selected this
38:45 - function unity should actually take care
38:47 - of everything for us so we can just go
38:48 - ahead and no put a few pins in this and
38:51 - boom it's going to reset the level and
38:54 - you could create some kind of cool
38:55 - fading whatever you want to do with that
38:58 - is totally up to you you can maybe have
38:59 - all of the pins like fly out and then
39:02 - back in but it's yeah we have that
39:06 - finished map cool so um yeah um let me
39:12 - see here I'm sorry I got distracted some
39:15 - motion going on over here my cats are
39:16 - crazy so yeah the next thing is probably
39:22 - just the rotation here because right now
39:24 - it's constant and that allows us to
39:26 - basically just play the game and then
39:28 - just sit and click away and we have a
39:30 - perfect stack of pizza that's actually
39:33 - kind of beautiful did you guys see that
39:35 - I'm really proud of this one I think I'm
39:37 - going to go ahead and take a screenshot
39:39 - look it's perfect it's the perfect
39:42 - circle like the distance between these
39:44 - are what's the odds let's go ahead and
39:46 - say that this is like a math teachers
39:50 - dream like here and I'm going to go
39:53 - ahead and mess it up there we go so this
39:56 - is of course way too easy so what we'll
40:00 - do instead is go onto our rotator and of
40:03 - course you can control our speed here in
40:05 - different ways we could I do have it as
40:07 - I showed earlier on the stream increase
40:10 - every time you put a pin in something we
40:12 - would have it kind of switch direction
40:14 - you could also control it using a unity
40:16 - curve or using some kind of coding where
40:19 - you suddenly switch some or some kind of
40:22 - time variable where in certain intervals
40:24 - you're going to switch the speed
40:26 - whatever there's plenty of opportunity
40:29 - for this but I found the easiest one and
40:32 - it's actually pretty fun the easiest one
40:35 - is to use the animator to click to edit
40:37 - or speed variable because one thing that
40:40 - a lot of people don't realize or easily
40:42 - forget is that the unity animation
40:44 - system can actually edit variables that
40:47 - you've created yourself and the cool
40:49 - thing about this is that we can now go
40:50 - here hit create animation go into our
40:53 - animation window and we can call this
40:55 - once a rotator but you can also make
40:59 - this easily into different levels this
41:00 - is the way that you would be able to
41:02 - very easily create different levels and
41:04 - we have this called level one have that
41:06 - play a certain animation then in level
41:08 - two you'll play another animation and
41:09 - you can just keep going so but this is
41:11 - going to be a rotator because we only
41:13 - have a single level and only need to do
41:16 - is in the beginning here we'll set the
41:18 - speed to something like a hundred then
41:21 - we can move forward say I don't know how
41:24 - long maybe a second or so we can we need
41:27 - to copy those keyframes over here
41:29 - something like that and we can actually
41:31 - have it speed up a little bit let's do
41:33 - that and in here we'll set the speed to
41:35 - something like 200 we can then copy
41:38 - these keyframes again and right before
41:40 - the two second mark we're going to make
41:42 - them go back here so we take this
41:44 - keyframe move over there this keyframe
41:46 - move back and move this at one
41:49 - two two second mark another arm I don't
41:52 - think we need any EC eating in or eating
41:55 - out on this one let's see what it looks
41:57 - like in the inspector or of course you
42:00 - can really see this on this way in the
42:01 - game so let's just go ahead and preview
42:03 - this actually lets the play put a pin in
42:06 - it and yeah that works and it brokes
42:10 - works really well you can see the reason
42:12 - why this went a bit further is again
42:14 - because we're using unity ordinary
42:16 - collision system and that might have a
42:18 - bit of error the only reason why it went
42:20 - that far is because again I shot it
42:22 - right after playing and unity always
42:24 - does weird stuff right when playing the
42:26 - game so just make sure to pause it and
42:28 - then play and they will all be on at the
42:31 - same place here so that's basically it I
42:33 - mean that allows you to just so easily
42:35 - go in here and edit the speed over time
42:38 - you can even go in and change the curve
42:39 - in order to adjust it if we wanted one
42:42 - that just increases a whole lot and then
42:45 - suddenly decrease it that could also be
42:47 - really fun to do so really really easy
42:50 - to control this sort of stuff using the
42:52 - animator so final thing is displaying
42:55 - the scores so let's go ahead and do that
42:57 - that's right click go UI and then text
43:00 - and we can just focus on this text here
43:02 - right now this canvas here is on just an
43:05 - overlay canvas and it's huge and we
43:08 - could just position our text to kind of
43:10 - line up with our circles but I think a
43:11 - much better way is making this into a
43:13 - world canvass so let's select the canvas
43:15 - change the render mode to world space
43:17 - and we can now scale it down because
43:19 - it's well gigantic so let's do something
43:22 - like point zero 1.0 1.0 one thats also
43:27 - reset the position on the X and the y
43:29 - it'd have to focus on that and you can
43:32 - see it's a lot better already
43:33 - then we can kind of maybe scale it down
43:36 - here because we don't need it to be that
43:37 - detailed and in kind of Center it on our
43:42 - on our circle here just moving it up on
43:45 - the Y then we can take our text object
43:47 - hit the anger presets here hold down alt
43:50 - and click in the bottom right corner in
43:52 - order to snap it to the entire arm to
43:55 - fit the entire canvas and we can then
43:58 - Center it on the X and on the Y we can
44:00 - change the text to something like
44:02 - one we can bump up the font size to
44:06 - something like 100 change the color to
44:08 - white and I don't like the fog I have to
44:12 - say I don't like the Arial fund I don't
44:14 - know why it's the default one in unity
44:16 - it's probably because well like all
44:18 - operating systems have has it and uses
44:21 - it but I don't like it I would prefer
44:24 - something like the latter fund something
44:27 - like to tell young text put Roboto would
44:31 - be pretty cool here just anything but
44:34 - Arial really pathetic I would actually
44:37 - do fine here or you could do with some
44:40 - something more classic anyways we can no
44:45 - doubt with the fonts forever but yeah
44:48 - just put anything else really and yeah
44:52 - but now we have the scores and I just
44:55 - colored picked it to fit the background
44:56 - instead of being completely white just
44:58 - so things feel a little better people of
45:01 - course spawning a spamming comic sense
45:04 - in the chat here I'm not going to do
45:06 - that I refuse and yeah so that looks
45:11 - good
45:12 - so then we're going to rename this
45:14 - texture to score we can go ahead and
45:16 - create a new component and we'll just
45:19 - name this our score component then
45:21 - inside of that will or double-click it
45:23 - to open it up first of all and in here
45:26 - we can create a static variable so we'll
45:27 - create a public static integer and this
45:30 - means that it's shared by all instances
45:32 - and so it's really easy to edit without
45:35 - needing in a reference to this
45:37 - particular object so we'll create public
45:40 - static int and we'll name it something
45:42 - like pin count and we'll set it to zero
45:47 - by default we'll also go down and create
45:49 - a start method in which we set the pin
45:52 - count to zero and that means that you
45:54 - don't have to default it up here but
45:56 - it's really important that you do this
45:57 - in the start method because when we
45:59 - restart the scene static variables are
46:01 - not reset and so you would just keep on
46:02 - counting and adding up on the score so
46:05 - make sure it's always reset that in the
46:07 - start method or when the level was noted
46:09 - or whatever that will go on into the
46:12 - update here and this is where we'll
46:14 - update our text so
46:15 - in order to do that we need to include
46:17 - unity engine dot UI then we can create a
46:21 - reference to our text so we'll create a
46:23 - public text object name that text then
46:26 - down here we can said text dot text in
46:28 - order to change the text of our text
46:30 - object equal to on pin count dot two
46:35 - strings boom there we go that was quick
46:39 - coding and then we can go into our pin
46:41 - whoops I pinch the pin so we'll select
46:45 - the pin here and in here we can say
46:47 - other than is pinned equals true and all
46:50 - that if we hit the rotator we can go
46:52 - ahead and set score oops
46:54 - score pin count to one to be one bigger
46:58 - so we'll just increase that by one and
47:01 - we do that by writing plus plus so
47:03 - everything else should work and if I
47:07 - haven't messed this up and we remember
47:09 - to import our text here if we now hit
47:12 - play and I'm confident enough to do this
47:14 - in full screen guys that means that it's
47:16 - getting good we have a counting score
47:18 - and if we die it resets it's almost too
47:22 - good to be true
47:23 - I think that was it so at this point I
47:27 - think I'm just going to go ahead and
47:30 - invite my lovely girlfriend you guys
47:33 - know who has Sophie bub
47:34 - you've probably seen her as a moderator
47:36 - in the stream onto the stage which is
47:40 - pretty much just a part of our living
47:42 - room and she can try it out so come here
47:45 - say hi we also have a cat click oh hi
47:51 - guys say hi this is Charlie guys oh it's
47:56 - really tired right now
47:57 - how's it going yeah welcome so thank you
48:01 - so let's just try yeah go ahead
48:05 - ok it's already playing oh yeah what's
48:11 - the reason for the wrist yep like so
48:16 - much as this game yeah is going to be an
48:19 - embarrassment I just know you can do it
48:21 - I can really mess you up but just being
48:23 - controlled actually I think that's an
48:24 - alternate yeah that's another key that's
48:27 - why I'm really amazed at how best you
48:29 - may
48:29 - excellent thanks yeah about an hour I
48:33 - guess yeah it's awesome I mean is really
48:35 - smooth yeah as long as it's over ten
48:38 - minutes we get enough ad revenue haha
48:40 - kidding so how much you things like the
48:45 - average number of pimp
48:48 - I don't know uh I think more than you
48:52 - are doing right now trollee yeah cool
48:57 - you like it it's really fun it has a
48:59 - great feel to it I think yeah right it
49:02 - is quite similar to the original yeah so
49:05 - I guess that's a good thing yeah okay we
49:07 - were aiming for yeah
49:09 - what is originality guys originality
49:11 - instead we're just doing the same things
49:13 - over and over anyway yeah I like it yeah
49:16 - awesome go sit over there
49:19 - yep so um they are asking if you're
49:24 - interested in making games or coding you
49:26 - can go ahead and take my microphone um
49:29 - yes I actually am but I also do quite a
49:33 - bit of editor work for ESCA um about
49:38 - editing the videos and just helping out
49:41 - on the back end of the YouTube channel
49:44 - yes it's been really awesome lately
49:48 - she's had a lot more time to help me out
49:49 - with the videos and I don't know if you
49:52 - guys have noticed but we have it we edit
49:55 - the videos a lot more heavily than we
49:57 - used to now and it's just so great
50:00 - because I can just throw her like the
50:01 - raw files and she actually does a lot of
50:04 - it so they are props to her so but yeah
50:08 - we've been doing some programming
50:10 - together it's it's really really fun
50:11 - it's a it's a it's a great thing to do
50:14 - together but yeah let's transition to
50:17 - the Q & A so let's let's go here and
50:23 - I'll do this and everything looks broken
50:25 - and there you go all right guys ask away
50:29 - let's uh I think we can be pretty happy
50:31 - about that thanks for the compliments
50:34 - guys you guys Rock we are yeah we've
50:37 - broken like the record switch viewer
50:40 - amount by far but that's awesome bye
50:43 - you guys so much I'm glad you liked this
50:45 - video how long since we met each other
50:48 - um well we've been together for I'm
50:52 - going to get this wrong and our four
50:55 - over five and a half years I think
50:56 - something like that we we made like in a
50:59 - eighth grade or something like that long
51:03 - time ago so yeah let's see um how did I
51:09 - start on ingenuity
51:11 - I wanted to make a game I guess um
51:13 - probably how much most people start had
51:16 - some good ideas
51:17 - I thought the the iOS app market was
51:20 - really interesting at the time I really
51:22 - don't anymore and I wanted to create
51:26 - kind of a a small game maker app
51:29 - actually and that's kind of how I picked
51:31 - opportunity because creating small
51:33 - sandboxes that are easy to tweak
51:35 - variables and them stuff is really easy
51:36 - within unity so again and I just kind of
51:40 - got in cept me obsessed with it is my
51:48 - cat a developer also not not yet we're
51:51 - getting there treating him some tricks
51:53 - he thinks he is sometimes you would you
51:56 - would think so at least considering the
51:58 - amount of times he walks over my
51:59 - keyboard and write something but most of
52:02 - the time it's pretty nonsensical you
52:04 - didn't miss the stream this is the best
52:06 - part of the stream this is where we hang
52:08 - out man but of course it will be up on
52:10 - on YouTube as well so don't worry about
52:13 - it then you can watch it immediately ask
52:14 - you on Detroit archives
52:17 - let's see you are going to upload
52:22 - another episode of how to make a video
52:24 - game in unity soon yeah and don't worry
52:27 - about it I mean this video is going to
52:28 - come out later today
52:29 - and the Han Omega video game is probably
52:32 - going to come out this wooden state
52:33 - remember I although Wednesdays and
52:35 - Sundays like every time and I try and
52:39 - make a how to make a video game video
52:40 - like every other week and then the other
52:43 - arm days I will kind of fill in with the
52:47 - standalone video something that I feel
52:49 - are some you guys have suggested most of
52:51 - the time and something that I feel would
52:53 - be interesting to do
52:54 - [Music]
52:56 - how did you get the visual studio
53:00 - solarized color scheme it's actually
53:03 - called mono kai and I just made a video
53:05 - actually on my visual studio settings my
53:08 - unity setting some cool tips and stuff a
53:09 - lot of you guys asked about that after
53:11 - the il-10 unity tips video and it's
53:15 - going to air in a few weeks so they all
53:17 - basically get my entire setup but I can
53:21 - throw your link closing wait if you just
53:24 - bear with me I'm going to show you a
53:25 - link in this twitchchat here to my
53:30 - visual studio settings because I've
53:31 - already I've already uploaded them so I
53:35 - think I should be able to do that pretty
53:37 - easily so bear with me while I try and
53:41 - figure this out so there we go something
53:43 - like this
53:44 - my keys settings lip I think yeah so if
53:50 - you guys just want to get all of my
53:52 - visual studio settings it's on the link
53:54 - right there you can just download that
53:55 - open it up you get to go um so let's see
54:00 - could you do a video about the unity
54:02 - animator it is confusing you a lot and I
54:04 - don't quite get everything in it yeah I
54:07 - understand that
54:08 - um the animator is pretty confusing it's
54:12 - actually a good idea I would love to do
54:14 - like a unity animated standalone video
54:16 - I'm going to have to write all this
54:18 - video that ideas down at some point I do
54:21 - but I can't really sit here write them
54:23 - down during the stream actually it's my
54:25 - live stream I can do what I want are
54:28 - going to write it down right away
54:29 - because I think it's a really good idea
54:31 - so I'm just going to do animator video
54:35 - but yeah the unity animator can be super
54:38 - confusing once you first start out I
54:39 - remember when unity first launched
54:41 - mekkin mi was so confused and some of
54:44 - the naming is just weird but once you
54:47 - get into it it's just it's crazy good I
54:50 - mean the ability to retarget animation
54:53 - as long as it's a human a model that
54:55 - somewhat fits their kind of rigging
54:59 - scheme it's just so powerful I mean you
55:02 - can have multiple different characters
55:04 - with using the same animations and
55:07 - you just swap things in and out and it's
55:09 - so easy to preview all that it's just
55:11 - it's amazing and it's also a really
55:14 - powerful state machine can you please
55:18 - teach us how to save and load your unity
55:20 - game I already have a few videos on
55:21 - serialization where we use player press
55:25 - but saving like an entire game state is
55:28 - totally going to depend on your game and
55:30 - I can see my which can kind of screwing
55:32 - around the kind of colors there you'll
55:34 - have to bear with that but yeah you can
55:36 - check some of those out to search for
55:38 - unity player prep it's probably the best
55:40 - place to start
55:43 - it's my income mostly YouTube or twitch
55:46 - or do you make games my income is
55:50 - definitely mostly YouTube not at all to
55:53 - it I switch I don't get anything from
55:55 - this whatsoever if you want to support
55:56 - me and these live streams you should go
55:58 - to patreon.com/scishow so it's
56:00 - patreon.com slash Trekkies it allows you
56:03 - to donate a monthly amount of your
56:05 - choosing and basically all of these guys
56:08 - goes into making these videos making
56:10 - live streams like this I spend a
56:13 - ridiculous amount of time considering my
56:17 - monthly payment I mean if I just had a
56:19 - fairly low hourly rate I would be a
56:22 - millionaire consider much time I spend
56:24 - on this stuff but yeah if you want to
56:26 - support it that's the way to go
56:28 - I don't make a lot of money elsewhere so
56:32 - ah yeah we are getting some patron hype
56:34 - in the chat that's awesome I'm just
56:36 - going to throw you guys a link to that
56:38 - as well so Gretchen calm slash varieties
56:41 - there you go if you go ahead and click
56:42 - that the amount is totally optional it's
56:45 - a monthly thing you can cancel it at any
56:47 - time I do have a few rewards and mostly
56:51 - it's just socializing it's so fun
56:53 - talking with the patrons and I'm getting
56:56 - to know you guys a bit better it's just
56:59 - awesome also if you have some problems
57:00 - it allows me to help out a lot better
57:03 - because I just get way too many
57:04 - questions to answer all of them so I
57:06 - look at at patron first I don't have a
57:10 - twitch Partnership turns out in order to
57:12 - get a pittance which partnership you
57:14 - have to like stream at least two times a
57:16 - week and I don't do that and they really
57:18 - want you to stream daily almost
57:20 - so yeah I said they don't do no
57:24 - programming in C++ I know a bit of C
57:26 - code to us I don't feel very much at
57:28 - home
57:28 - also because C++ is just such an immense
57:31 - language and there's so many things you
57:32 - can screw up but I feel like I can and
57:35 - understand most of it and and write some
57:38 - of it so that's fun
57:39 - I have had a go at making a few graphics
57:43 - rendering engine since it does to us
57:44 - that is always fun to do where am i from
57:49 - Denmark and why your program in c-sharp
57:53 - instead of JavaScript in unity that's a
57:55 - super good question I mean before I
57:58 - think the answer was a lot harder and
58:00 - came down to more personal preference
58:03 - but I think as of late c-sharp is really
58:06 - starting to look like just the best
58:08 - option without much arguing the thing
58:11 - about JavaScript is that it's really
58:13 - easy to read and if you don't have any
58:15 - prior programming knowledge whatsoever a
58:17 - lot of the words used in JavaScript in
58:20 - that syntax come from English and not
58:23 - another programming language instead of
58:25 - void your X function and things can have
58:28 - a function and realize instead of
58:30 - writing float goals in whatever instead
58:33 - of writing the datatype explicitly you
58:35 - simply write bar for variable and it's
58:38 - good to learn what a variable is and
58:40 - stuff like that so it's not as explicit
58:43 - and that's simply also just less syntax
58:46 - you start without a class you start our
58:47 - namespace and stuff like that so it's
58:51 - just cleaner in terms of reading it but
58:54 - I think c-sharp just is superior in
58:58 - unity at this point and it's because you
59:00 - want that explicitness if you're making
59:02 - it a larger game and also if you go on
59:05 - the forums if you go on to the unity
59:07 - scripting reference or the API whatever
59:10 - on the manuals all the examples pretty
59:13 - much you're going to be seeing up from C
59:15 - sharp and it just helps you so much also
59:17 - if you're going to be programming in a
59:18 - more professional setting they're
59:20 - probably like 99.9 percent of the time
59:23 - going to be using C sharp to do that so
59:25 - that's why it's good to learn and that's
59:28 - why I also use it also I love c-sharp
59:30 - it's just I love that language something
59:33 - about it I don't know let's see unity 4
59:38 - vs. Unreal Engine 4 in your opinion
59:40 - totally depends how big is your team
59:42 - what game is you are you making if you
59:44 - are less than 45 people always unity if
59:47 - you're making something other than a big
59:50 - shooter with really advanced graphics
59:52 - I'm pretty much always going to turn to
59:54 - choose unity if those two requirements
59:56 - are in place then I really start to
59:59 - think about it that's just my personal
60:01 - thing but really both awesome engines
60:04 - really and you can create amazing games
60:07 - of all types using both hmmm you some of
60:14 - you guys asking kind of what programming
60:16 - languages are better JavaScript c-sharp
60:19 - C++ just with the game engines it solely
60:21 - depends on what you want to do guys it's
60:23 - way too general of your question of a
60:25 - question you can say which one is better
60:27 - performance wise at this particular task
60:29 - and then we can start to talk about it
60:31 - but just comparing to programming
60:32 - languages that it's it's just too
60:35 - general it's just like tools yeah I mean
60:38 - what's best a screwdriver or a hammer
60:41 - well it kind of depends on if you want
60:42 - to knock something into the wall or
60:44 - screw it in so let's see when did you
60:49 - start programming um slowly about they
60:53 - mess it up six years ago something like
60:56 - that yeah ceelo's now do I know any AI
61:02 - stuff yeah do I have written a bit of
61:08 - custom artificial intelligence plugins
61:11 - just for my own using nothing pretty um
61:13 - I've used a star pathfinding for love
61:16 - projects it's really good I've also used
61:19 - a bit of rain from rain Indy from rival
61:23 - series so yeah a bit here and there
61:25 - that's not the video that I should
61:27 - probably go ahead and do soon it's some
61:29 - kind of a star path finding /ai video
61:33 - and it's now on the list as well when I
61:37 - make a video explaining navmesh
61:39 - navigation - on basically a navigation
61:41 - mesh is a mesh that you generate for
61:44 - your game where are
61:46 - basically an overview of where your
61:48 - artificial intelligence object is able
61:51 - to walk so you just create a mesh that
61:53 - avoids obstacles you have certain paths
61:56 - there might be links between jumps and
61:59 - stuff like that and that allows your it
62:03 - allows your artificial intelligence
62:06 - agent whatever you want to navigate
62:08 - around to not have to think about all
62:10 - this stuff he knows where you can walk
62:12 - and where he can't
62:13 - that's what nav meshes are but that is
62:15 - something that I would cover for doing
62:16 - and they I video probably let's see what
62:23 - else we have here
62:24 - [Music]
62:25 - I keep struggling working on a game
62:32 - because I think my scope is too big ah
62:34 - it went off the screen here wait let me
62:37 - just find the chat here wait no this is
62:42 - here we go the chat is going way too
62:45 - quick guys
62:47 - I started yeah it keep struggling
62:50 - working on a game it keeps disappearing
62:54 - I can't do it I'm sorry
62:56 - whatever the question is just it's going
62:59 - too fast I couldn't find it
63:01 - I'm so sorry did you use roblox in your
63:04 - childhood or ever actually did not which
63:07 - computer language should I learn and I
63:11 - don't know what these last oh hi yeah
63:14 - awesome okay yeah the programming
63:18 - language that it completely depends on
63:21 - your on your background if you're just
63:23 - starting out and you want to use unity
63:25 - c-sharp or JavaScript if you feel that C
63:28 - shock is too scary to JavaScript if you
63:30 - want to jump right into the hardcore
63:31 - stuff c-sharp and yeah pretty much
63:34 - depends on what you want to do if you
63:36 - want to learn something about the web
63:37 - there's so many languages probably start
63:40 - with HTML and a bit of CSS and then from
63:45 - there you can go to JavaScript to make
63:48 - your code interactive and then you can
63:49 - have a look at if you want to go to
63:51 - front face developers or back in
63:54 - developers but yeah really depends on
63:57 - what you want to do
63:59 - um let's see
64:03 - could I make it to turn on how to make
64:05 - GTA in unity I love Grand Theft Auto but
64:08 - I don't want to be making it that would
64:11 - take me alone and internally and even in
64:16 - a team that's way too hard so no I won't
64:18 - be doing that so we're too complicated
64:20 - what's my favorite games flash games
64:23 - that's a good question actually I feel
64:26 - like I've played a lot of different
64:27 - games when it comes to like smaller
64:29 - indie games
64:30 - um I think Thomas Thomas was alone this
64:33 - is really really good I played so many
64:39 - it's hard some of the big Triple A games
64:43 - I've already always been a huge fan of
64:45 - Ratchet and Clank mostly because of
64:47 - their humor the cutscenes some of the
64:50 - character work the art is amazing
64:52 - the gameplay is fine but I mean the
64:54 - level design is just amazing really
64:56 - really good work I also like the casual
65:00 - shooter I played a lot of close duty
65:02 - back in the day modern warfare 2 I have
65:03 - like 600 600 hours in that and I've
65:06 - played a lot of counter-strike
65:07 - I love csgo and all that it's really fun
65:10 - to do with friends I've said a huge
65:12 - amount of World of Warcraft the old
65:14 - Warcraft games were super fun
65:16 - yeah I've really played a lot of
65:18 - different games but I consider myself
65:20 - mostly a social gamers so most of what
65:22 - I've played is something that has played
65:24 - great friends and then once in a while
65:26 - an indie experience um probably is the
65:29 - only really big game other than Ratchet
65:31 - and Clank that was single-player on the
65:33 - PC is Skyrim i played the heck out of
65:37 - Skyrim just amazing world building
65:40 - really really well put together engine
65:43 - and game have a little played League of
65:46 - Legends over the 4 craft I played League
65:48 - of Legends like a few times I sucked so
65:50 - bad at it I rage quit I actually prefer
65:52 - smite if you're going to go in kind of
65:54 - the mobile direction I both suck at odor
65:57 - and League of Legends but yeah it's
65:59 - light a lot of World of Warcraft
66:00 - definitely way too much can you do more
66:09 - mobile tutorials well I actually try and
66:12 - aim most
66:13 - my tutorials on games that can easily be
66:15 - exported to either mobile or desktop I
66:18 - don't want to narrow it down too much
66:19 - unity makes it so easy to export stuff
66:22 - for both platforms and that's why I've
66:25 - tried and keep it really general of
66:26 - course you have to worry about
66:28 - performance and of course you need to
66:30 - have different controls so that's just
66:32 - such a tiny part of your game that I try
66:35 - not do that too much I might make a
66:37 - mobile series at some point but I think
66:40 - most people are requesting all those
66:43 - tiny little stuff but I'll definitely
66:45 - keep it in mind do did you do to you can
66:51 - I do another multiplayer FPS tutorial
66:53 - well this is something that I wanted to
66:55 - address both the multiplayer FPS series
66:59 - and the tower defense series are
67:01 - currently on hold the reason why is that
67:05 - I've again transition to a whole new way
67:07 - of making videos for me at least and I
67:10 - know this is a pretty drastic change and
67:13 - I'm sorry if you guys are disappointed
67:16 - to not see more videos in it right now
67:18 - the reason why is I saw a lot of you
67:21 - guys saying in the comments that you
67:24 - felt like this series was getting too
67:27 - long and you wanted to see all the
67:28 - topics and it was getting kind of boring
67:30 - also you were missing videos because you
67:33 - you got lost at video number 15 and
67:35 - never got to number 30 and I felt like I
67:38 - was covering the same things over and
67:39 - over but in a slightly modified way to
67:41 - fit that particular series and I thought
67:44 - that could be just done just so much
67:46 - better but what I do instead now is um
67:50 - try and make more standalone videos that
67:53 - cover a certain subject that you can
67:55 - then easily apply to whatever game
67:57 - you're working on so if you're making a
67:58 - multiplayer FPS or a tower defense you
68:00 - can hopefully apply a shattering effect
68:03 - or a whatever volumetric lighting
68:07 - something like that something standalone
68:08 - that you can easily just take and
68:10 - implement in your game I feel that's a
68:12 - lot better I've definitely seen a lot
68:15 - more views on those videos a lot more
68:17 - likes you guys seem a lot more engaged
68:19 - with those videos and of course that
68:22 - means that we can't go ahead and create
68:24 - these huge game projects but
68:26 - I mean in the end only like four or five
68:28 - times 5,000 people were watching those
68:31 - videos where in the beginning some of
68:33 - those series videos have hundreds of
68:37 - thousands of views so it really showed
68:39 - me that I'm doing something wrong here
68:41 - I'm not really captivating and keeping
68:43 - people watching these videos so yeah
68:46 - that's kind of why I've transition to
68:48 - this more standalone field um does that
68:51 - mean that I never will make another
68:53 - multiplayer FPS video not necessarily
68:55 - and the same thing with tower defense
68:57 - but I have to do something that I really
68:59 - feel is it's needed and necessary and I
69:02 - don't just want to sit there and grind
69:03 - out the same boring video again and
69:06 - again I want to make smaller videos and
69:09 - standalone videos so I hope you guys
69:11 - aren't bored with that so far the
69:13 - feedback I think has been really
69:15 - positive and I'm just so thankful for
69:16 - that because this is also so much more
69:19 - fun to me why am i underrated thank you
69:24 - so much as anyone ever hide you in the
69:27 - game industry yeah I've been hired to do
69:29 - client work um many times I haven't
69:32 - actually ever been in a full-time game
69:34 - developer on position for a game studio
69:37 - and the reason for that is in very much
69:41 - not that I can that I haven't been
69:44 - offered it especially since the YouTube
69:46 - channel it's gotten better bigger I've
69:48 - done a lot of offers because people
69:52 - recognize me and know that I'm kind of
69:54 - what I can do and such but I just really
69:58 - like this a lot more I don't like the
70:00 - idea of having a nine-to-five job and
70:02 - also I wouldn't be able to keep score
70:05 - with the YouTube channel and you guys
70:06 - and patreon and dev assets and all these
70:09 - things so I really hate having to do
70:12 - that at this point I enjoy this so much
70:14 - more can I do if FPS tutorial series
70:18 - already have won the multiplayer first
70:19 - tutorial series you can go check that
70:20 - out we'll be doing some more shooter
70:22 - oriented standalone video want to do one
70:24 - on shooting definitely some weapon
70:26 - switching at some point I'm sorry for
70:27 - just delaying it and delaying it but I
70:29 - have something that I want to get in
70:31 - place before showing you yeah so would
70:35 - you make a unity photon game photon is
70:37 - awesome maybe at some point
70:41 - where did I they learn a step past
70:44 - finding my enemies get start the in
70:46 - platforms just using that documentation
70:47 - actually but that can be kind of tricky
70:50 - to figure out if you don't have too much
70:53 - experience just learning you a ice and
70:56 - stuff alright new AP ice and stuff like
70:59 - that so yeah but there are some really
71:01 - good tutorials on YouTube actually just
71:03 - search for unity a star path finding
71:05 - tutorial and lots of great stuff is that
71:07 - especially it Sebastian League has done
71:10 - a lot with artificial intelligence
71:13 - all right I think we're going to do
71:17 - final questions here guys because my
71:18 - voice is slowly disappearing and I can't
71:21 - be clutch more so um yeah just shoot
71:24 - shoot in the twitch chat and we'll do
71:26 - this some final ones and we'll wrap up
71:27 - this was just so much fun
71:31 - will you do an advanced tutorial depends
71:36 - on if there's a subject that I really
71:37 - want to cover so yeah sure if a final
71:41 - good good subject um would you suggest a
71:47 - guy that can do good programming an art
71:49 - to go indie or try to get work in a
71:52 - company for an entry-level position
71:54 - totally depends on your situation if you
71:57 - go indie and try that out that can be
72:00 - really financially unstable whereas
72:03 - working in a bigger studio you have
72:05 - benefits so depends on what you want to
72:09 - do personally I would always prefer to
72:12 - do indie development with smaller teams
72:14 - if you have friends so we can get to
72:16 - know someone who want to make a game
72:18 - similar to what you want but of course
72:21 - that's always risky and you can never be
72:23 - guaranteed that people will actually buy
72:25 - it in the end you'll you need to have a
72:26 - good strategy before considering doing
72:29 - that because yeah financially that can
72:33 - be hard but that's always what I would
72:36 - aim for but when these sort of always
72:39 - take my advice with a grain of salt
72:41 - these sort of things because it totally
72:42 - depends and I don't just occur to you to
72:45 - go out and make an indie game and then
72:46 - after two years
72:49 - go broke tell me that hold am i I am 19
72:54 - years old soon to be 20 fairly soon like
72:59 - a month or so little over month huh
73:08 - please stop spamming questions I'll just
73:11 - go ahead and answer now so you can stop
73:12 - spamming - please stop anyways have you
73:14 - considered making and selling a game for
73:16 - extra income sure that could be a lot of
73:19 - fun but right now I suddenly have too
73:22 - much to do with YouTube channel I also
73:23 - launched dev assets of course if you
73:26 - guys want some cool 3d models for free
73:29 - is pay what you want go to devices
73:31 - comics aside I made together with some
73:33 - awesome artists and that's kind of the
73:36 - development project that I've been
73:37 - working on alongside the YouTube channel
73:40 - so I haven't really had time to think of
73:42 - it but at some point that would be that
73:44 - would be really fun but making a game
73:46 - and selling it does require a lot of a
73:48 - lot of work and when it's my birthday on
73:55 - 25th of March it's my birthday birthday
74:01 - often do you live stream these live
74:04 - streams are monthly thanks to patreon
74:06 - because we reach the monthly live
74:09 - streams go but yeah sometimes they go a
74:12 - few days overboard how do you expand
74:17 - coding knowledge fast practice just
74:19 - right and when I subtract this I don't
74:22 - mean keep writing on the same big
74:24 - project make lots of smaller projects
74:26 - like this one no it creates something
74:29 - that you know you're going to be able to
74:30 - finish in a day an hour a week not more
74:33 - than that and create that and then move
74:36 - on to the next thing the more smaller
74:38 - projects that you create the more you
74:40 - get to know and yeah it's really just
74:42 - about coding yourself into a wall then
74:45 - hitting that brick and just realizing
74:47 - that's something I have to learn hearing
74:49 - aware to keep going and then learning it
74:51 - I think that's pretty much the best way
74:53 - if you're already familiar with coding
74:55 - like the basics and able to code on your
74:58 - own yeah how am I
75:02 - and good thank you how are you and yes
75:05 - the livestream is going to get up go on
75:07 - YouTube and how unlikely is it to make
75:12 - money off your first game your very
75:13 - first game that's very unlikely and the
75:16 - thing that most indie developers do is
75:18 - they build up a bank of games and if
75:20 - they get more and more recognition each
75:23 - time and and and more and more revenue
75:25 - for each game in the bank and they of
75:27 - course you have to support the older
75:28 - games but it's very rare to be able to
75:30 - live off of a single release most people
75:33 - have at least three four five six games
75:36 - released that day then I live off of
75:39 - that's at least what I see is common in
75:41 - the industry for for standalone
75:43 - developers working in smaller teams so
75:47 - yeah all right guys I think that is
75:52 - pretty much it so thank you so much for
75:57 - the questions you guys Rock I had so
75:59 - much fun as always if you wanted to put
76:02 - these on live streams and these videos
76:04 - go to patreon.com slash blankies and if
76:09 - you want to download some cool looking
76:10 - models go to demo sitcom and of course
76:14 - go to youtube.com slash brackets if you
76:16 - want to see more videos lots of them
76:19 - more much more heavily edited than this
76:21 - one thankfully because I say a lot of
76:23 - crap and we have to clean that out and
76:26 - yeah so thanks so much guys had a blast
76:29 - you guys Rock and yeah I'll see you in
76:32 - the next video so bye guys thank you so
76:35 - much five thanks to the awesome people
76:37 - who donated in January and a special
76:38 - thanks to Derek since Kirk placed on
76:40 - mattify james callaghan robert Bonham
76:42 - Peter Locke and Jason dirty dough if you
76:44 - want to become a picture in yourself you
76:45 - can do so a pitcher intercom slash
76:47 - brekkie thanks a lot guys
