00:00 - thanks for tuning in at
00:03 - braies hello everyone and welcome to
00:06 - video number five in make a game a cool
00:09 - little series on making a video game in
00:12 - unity so in this video we are going to
00:15 - add some shadowing to our game we're
00:17 - going to add some real time Shadows uh
00:20 - we're also going toh talk a bit about
00:22 - lights and how they work uh and then
00:25 - we're going to move on to making our
00:27 - ball uh die or at least uh react uh
00:31 - whenever he falls down uh from his
00:34 - platform so whenever the player fails
00:37 - and uh and Falls to Infinity we're going
00:40 - to we're going to stop that and and make
00:41 - him maybe respawn
00:44 - instead so uh basically uh let's start
00:47 - out by adding the lights here so as
00:50 - always I've opened up unity and uh we
00:53 - left off last time uh with a ball
00:56 - rolling uh around a little bit more
00:59 - exciting level but uh as you can see
01:02 - once we roll up here uh there's there
01:05 - are no more lights and the reason why we
01:07 - are still able to see what's going on up
01:11 - here is because of what is called
01:13 - ambient light and ambient light is also
01:16 - called fill light and it's basically um
01:20 - how bright and what color the light is
01:23 - whenever we don't have a light uh so
01:26 - it's it's basically the color of the
01:29 - Shadows
01:30 - and uh and what we can do to adjust this
01:33 - is we can go up to the edit hit render
01:37 - settings and then you should see a
01:39 - setting called ambient light and if we
01:41 - click this and drag it all the way down
01:45 - we can make everything but the lit up
01:47 - parts black this won't affect the Skybox
01:50 - of course and this is great for horror
01:52 - games but not really in a moody fun
01:54 - little game like ours so let's just
01:57 - leave this this at a gray color uh like
02:00 - it was before but you can go ahead and
02:02 - play around with this you can also tint
02:04 - it a bit blue if you would want the more
02:07 - uh you want the color from the sky
02:09 - reflecting it I might tint it just a
02:12 - tiny bit to the blue side there and uh
02:15 - maybe make it a bit darker so we can
02:18 - have some more lights in there without
02:19 - it getting too blown up but uh now that
02:22 - we have adjusted this let's go ahead and
02:25 - look at how our light is set up so
02:28 - currently we only have one light in
02:30 - scene and that is a point light emitting
02:34 - um and you might have noticed that if
02:37 - you we go to the right hand side here we
02:39 - can set it to have shadows though once
02:41 - we do Unity will um will will tell us
02:46 - that we need the pro version and so uh
02:49 - we if we just going to consider that we
02:51 - don't have the pro ver version so let's
02:54 - just disable this light and if we now
02:56 - want some shadows in there uh in unity
03:00 - 4.2 uh they added real time Shadows to
03:04 - directional lights in the free version
03:07 - so that's really great it helps your uh
03:09 - game look much better and it's it's
03:11 - really an awesome feature so let's go
03:13 - ahead and go to game object create other
03:16 - and now directional light so we can get
03:18 - some shadowing in there and uh if we
03:21 - have a look at our Sky Box it looks like
03:23 - our sun is coming uh from somewhat
03:27 - behind us uh so we can just go ahead and
03:29 - play around with this until you find it
03:32 - looking good and um I don't think this
03:35 - is too bad you don't want to come in
03:38 - straight from the camera and this is not
03:40 - going to be our only light source um but
03:43 - let's just maybe bump down the intensity
03:46 - to something like 0.3 or four let's try
03:50 - four yeah this is looking pretty great
03:52 - now uh and we can go ahead and add
03:55 - Shadows so go under the shadow type and
03:59 - hit hard
04:00 - shadows and uh the string is fine at one
04:04 - and the resolution is is fine as is but
04:07 - what we can see now is we have a shadow
04:10 - on our ball this is not that apparent
04:13 - because it doesn't have that many
04:15 - objects to cast The Shadow upon so what
04:17 - we can do is we can make our ground a
04:20 - little wider and this is where it comes
04:22 - in handy that we have made the ground a
04:25 - prefab because we can now we can simply
04:28 - take the scale of this set axis and
04:30 - change this to two and then just hit
04:33 - apply and it will change all the other
04:36 - ground objects too so now when we play
04:39 - our game here we can see that we have
04:42 - some nice shadowing coming from the ball
04:46 - and uh and this looks much better so
04:48 - great now that we have this in place
04:51 - whoops uh we can go ahead and add some
04:54 - more things to our game uh one quick
04:57 - note is that if you think this gets two
05:00 - blown up from one side you can duplicate
05:02 - the directional light and rotate it to
05:05 - the other side and then just bump down
05:07 - the intensity and this will make it look
05:09 - a little more realistic because now we
05:11 - have some light on the other side too
05:13 - but for now let's just not include that
05:17 - uh let's just let the ambient light take
05:19 - care of it okay so let's rename this
05:21 - light to
05:23 - Sun and there we go one thing you can do
05:26 - is if you want something to be in the
05:28 - top of the high key and you know you're
05:30 - not going to be using it in a script you
05:33 - can just make two spaces and it will uh
05:36 - go right up there uh but I like to
05:39 - makeing an uh to make an underscore
05:42 - instead and it will also just be in the
05:45 - top of the hierarchy so you can always
05:47 - find it this is great for things that is
05:49 - always uh there and isn't changed um so
05:53 - so that's that's a a Nifty little
05:56 - feature great so let's save our scene
05:59 - file save scene and let's delete our old
06:02 - light there we
06:05 - go okay so what we are going to be doing
06:08 - now is we want to make uh make it so
06:11 - that our ball will respawn whenever it
06:16 - uh Falls from one of the platforms and
06:19 - we're going to do this by selecting our
06:22 - ball hitting add
06:24 - component going to new
06:27 - script and
06:30 - whoops uh whoops I added script without
06:34 - renaming it let's just try that one more
06:37 - time selecting the ball hitting add
06:41 - component new script and let's call this
06:45 - ball
06:49 - health of type JavaScript and hit create
06:52 - an ad now we can go ahead and duplicate
06:55 - uh double click this to open it up in
06:57 - Mano develop let me just explain because
07:01 - there are several ways to do
07:03 - this first off we could have uh let's
07:07 - see if I can drag this there we go the
07:10 - first option is to use what is called a
07:13 - trigger collider so a
07:18 - trigger and what a trigger does is it
07:22 - wow that's it's extremely bad but
07:25 - basically what a trigger does is it it
07:28 - uh normally uses a box collider so if we
07:31 - have a box here and uh what it does it
07:34 - is detects whether or not something
07:36 - enters the trigger so if something
07:39 - should enter this it won't collide with
07:41 - it it will just go straight through so
07:44 - if our ball enters this trigger we can
07:46 - use a script uh checking that called on
07:51 - trigger
07:54 - enter on trigger iner and uh and what we
07:58 - can do with this script
07:59 - is that we can uh use this to call some
08:02 - code so if something enters the trigger
08:05 - and if what enters is equal to a player
08:08 - or the ball then we want something to
08:11 - happen so on trigger is equal to the
08:15 - ball then uh we want something to happen
08:18 - then we can uh make something happen
08:21 - down here in code so we can place some
08:23 - code in
08:25 - here this is what we want to happen
08:28 - right um but but this has some faults
08:33 - because if our balling ball is falling
08:35 - so fast that um that the trigger won't
08:39 - detect it and that sometimes happens uh
08:42 - then we have a problem because then our
08:44 - ball will fall to Infinity so what we're
08:46 - going to be doing instead is we are
08:48 - going to be using the position of our
08:50 - ball and uh that's done by using
08:55 - transform.
08:56 - position transform dot position and uh
09:02 - and what this will allow us to do is
09:04 - we'll we'll uh just check for the Y
09:08 - position of the bow which means the up
09:12 - and down value so the up and down and if
09:17 - we can just check that
09:20 - if that value is equal to and then we
09:25 - can say let's say uh minus 10
09:30 - or less than so less than or equal to
09:33 - I'm sorry more than or equal to minus 10
09:36 - then we want something to happen so
09:38 - instead of of using a trigger and get
09:41 - this complicated setup we will just
09:43 - check for the position of the ball and
09:46 - see if it's below what we want it to and
09:48 - we can use a variable for this so what
09:50 - we're going to do now is we're going to
09:52 - go to our ball health and we're going to
09:55 - delete this function start we're not
09:57 - going to use that and then we are going
09:59 - to make a variable called uh let's say
10:03 - Max fall
10:06 - distance and uh this is going to be
10:09 - equal to let's say minus
10:11 - 10 now in our function update let's make
10:14 - some space and in here we can type
10:19 - if and then uh this script is going to
10:22 - be sitting on our ball so all we need to
10:25 - do to access it is type transform and
10:28 - then we will get the position and
10:30 - rotation and all of that on the uh on
10:33 - the object the script is sitting on so
10:35 - we are just going to be using
10:37 - transform then do
10:39 - position and Dot y because we only want
10:43 - to check for the y axis and if this is
10:46 - more than or equal to Max F
10:51 - [Music]
10:53 - distance then we
10:55 - want something to happen and then let's
10:59 - just first off check if this is working
11:01 - and we do that by typing in
11:04 - debug.log and then opening up some
11:07 - parentheses and in here we can type
11:11 - test and close it out and what this will
11:15 - allow us to do is if we go back in our
11:17 - game we should see a variable down here
11:20 - no
11:21 - errors and uh what it will do is if we
11:24 - go to the console window it will show
11:27 - this text this test text it will show
11:31 - test in here whenever that is called so
11:35 - we can check if it's working by hitting
11:37 - play and you can see just when starting
11:39 - out we get a bunch of tests and uh we
11:43 - really only want this to be called
11:45 - whenever we get below that distance and
11:47 - the reason why is because this should be
11:50 - more than or less than or equal to so
11:54 - like that so if we are minus 10 units
11:58 - down
12:00 - or
12:01 - less uh or more then we should call this
12:05 - debug. log uh test and the reason why we
12:09 - use the less than is because this is in
12:13 - negative numbers and that's why it can
12:15 - be confusing sometimes if you don't get
12:18 - this right away it's completely
12:19 - understandable just save this and we can
12:22 - hit
12:24 - play and if we hit clear here we can see
12:27 - there are no tests
12:29 - and if we now roll our ball down and
12:32 - wait for it and there you go the test
12:35 - variable is called so now once we get
12:37 - below the 10 units it calls the test and
12:42 - uh basically here we would uh make our
12:45 - ball jump back to whatever checkpoint we
12:48 - had reached but since we don't we
12:51 - haven't made checkpoints yet what we
12:53 - going to do is we're simply going to
12:55 - replay the level so we're just going to
12:57 - make it load up the same level and we do
13:01 - this by uh using
13:05 - application. load level and load level
13:09 - uh all this needs is the name of the
13:12 - level so we are just going to type I
13:14 - think I called it level one let's just
13:17 - check in the project pane yeah I called
13:19 - it level one so whatever you called it
13:21 - will just copy paste that in there and
13:25 - close it up so if this is still unclear
13:28 - what we're doing is we are making a
13:30 - variable which is uh the max F distance
13:33 - and this is equal to minus 10 because we
13:35 - don't want it to get more than 10 units
13:38 - down and uh then we check if we get
13:41 - below that distance and if we do we will
13:44 - reload the level we are on so now let's
13:47 - save this and uh this is not going to
13:50 - work but let's try it anyway so let's
13:52 - hit play and make our ball fall down and
13:56 - what's going to happen now is well
13:58 - actually actually this worked and that's
14:00 - uh that might be because uh this is our
14:03 - first level if this isn't working and
14:06 - it's saying that you have to assign this
14:09 - uh level then uh what you can do is you
14:12 - can go to the
14:14 - edit uh I'm sorry the file then build
14:18 - settings and what you have to do is you
14:21 - have to add the scene into the build
14:24 - settings here so just hit add current
14:27 - and uh this this does work because we
14:29 - only have one scene in there but if we
14:32 - had multiple levels it would throw an
14:34 - error so simply we just have to make
14:37 - sure that all our levels are added and
14:39 - if you add more than one you can just
14:41 - drag them around to change the order in
14:43 - which they're played so just hit add
14:45 - current and uh yeah we can see it
14:48 - working so now we can try out our level
14:50 - we can see it's beautifully lit up all
14:52 - the way and let's say we don't make this
14:54 - jump oh that's unlucky well then we can
14:57 - just replay
15:00 - great so that was pretty much this video
15:02 - I hope you enjoyed it I know it was a
15:05 - lot of scripting and we also got some
15:07 - light in there and it's looking much
15:09 - better so uh thank you for watching and
15:12 - also uh I would really like to see what
15:15 - you guys are making so please go ahead
15:18 - and tweet to me at
15:21 - bracket.com let me just write that to
15:24 - you here so you can get it on writing so
15:30 - brais treat not.com so at braist treat
15:33 - on Twitter I mean so write to me at brai
15:37 - Street on Twitter uh I would like to see
15:41 - pictures or updates on whatever game you
15:43 - are making and uh you can also get some
15:47 - feedback and uh it's fun for me to see
15:49 - what you're you're using the tutorials
15:51 - for so please if you're making a game it
15:54 - uh doesn't have to be finished just
15:56 - right working progress or whatever um
