00:02 - hello Anna welcome to video number 27
00:06 - Part B in our survival games series done
00:09 - by practice and the C of Brac E's and in
00:12 - this video we're going to continue with
00:14 - learning mechanism and getting our arms
00:17 - to work inside of our game this is Part
00:22 - B so you can just go ahead and click the
00:24 - screen to if you haven't watched part a
00:27 - you're probably going to need that in
00:30 - order to follow along with this tutorial
00:33 - okay so let's open up unity as always
00:36 - and we can see we have our arms under
00:39 - our player main camera arms and we have
00:43 - the arms controller so let's go under
00:45 - the assets under the arms folder and
00:48 - then double-click the arms controller
00:50 - this will bring up our animator window
00:53 - and let's just use the Alt key and the
00:57 - left mouse button to drag over to where
01:01 - we have set things up we could also just
01:03 - go ahead and select all of this and
01:05 - maybe bring it down a bit that's much
01:10 - better
01:11 - okay so now let's make the hitting and
01:15 - the punching and the swinging of the
01:18 - sword whenever we want to kill an enemy
01:22 - so to do this we start out by dragging
01:26 - in a new animation I'm just going to
01:29 - make a new state since I can't really
01:30 - drag in from the project pane right now
01:32 - so let's just right click on some empty
01:35 - space hit create state empty now select
01:40 - it rename this to hit 1 the speed is 1
01:49 - change the foot I K to none so uncheck
01:53 - that so go to motion and let's select a
01:57 - motion under the assets and this one is
02:00 - going to be punch right and let's see
02:05 - what which comes from it comes from
02:07 - there under arms arms 5 FBX that's
02:10 - exactly where we wanted
02:13 - now let's make some transitions for this
02:16 - so let's go down here and let's make a
02:23 - transition from the idle so right click
02:25 - on the idle it made transition and click
02:29 - on the hid one this transition needs to
02:32 - do to check for something but let's
02:35 - first make sure it blends correctly so
02:38 - uncheck the atomic go to the end of the
02:42 - idle animation hit play that actually
02:46 - wasn't too bad but we can try treating
02:48 - in a bit so soo-min using old all
02:52 - navigation is done in old now we can
02:57 - maybe try squeezing this in so there
02:59 - isn't so much blending that's a little
03:04 - better
03:04 - so we get more the harsh and quick punch
03:08 - I like that a lot
03:10 - so let's keep that the condition is
03:13 - something we want to change though so
03:16 - let's go ahead and make a new parameter
03:19 - so hit plus let's make this a boolean
03:23 - and let's call this hit zero one so
03:30 - let's go under the conditions select the
03:33 - hit one and make it true so if our hit
03:38 - one becomes true this will blend over to
03:41 - the hit 1 animation but we have several
03:45 - animation we both have one for the right
03:47 - arm and the left left arm and so I think
03:50 - we should get the hit two in here also
03:53 - so it creating a great state empty let's
03:58 - call this hit two let's uncheck the foot
04:04 - ok go into motion assets find the punch
04:10 - left from the arms 5 FBX double click
04:14 - that and now we have it in there so now
04:17 - we can go ahead and right click on the
04:19 - idle hit make transition and then click
04:23 - on the hit 2
04:26 - and here we can have the speed p1 and we
04:29 - can never have the punch left and so we
04:32 - can select our transition go and you can
04:36 - go under the atomic and uncheck that and
04:39 - now let's take care of the blending so
04:41 - if we zoom in some in some more maybe
04:47 - bring down this a bit let's see how this
04:49 - looks that was maybe a bit too quick so
04:54 - like that that was actually too slow so
05:01 - like that better and that looks awesome
05:05 - so now that we are happy with that let's
05:08 - change the condition so go down to the
05:10 - parameters and let's make one more so
05:14 - hit play or hit plus I should say rename
05:19 - it to hit to a type boolean and let's
05:24 - then change the condition to hit 2 and
05:27 - to be equal to true and so now we will
05:33 - play the hit 1 when the hit 1 parameter
05:37 - is set to true and we will play the hit
05:40 - - when the hit 2 parameter is set to
05:43 - true this will allow us to when we make
05:47 - the script to randomize what arm is
05:51 - going to hit something we could either
05:54 - randomize it or we could just make a
05:56 - change so it would be right left right
05:58 - left and intervals you can do whatever
06:01 - you want you can also make a series of
06:04 - numbers or boolean events it will cycle
06:08 - through so it will be right right left
06:10 - right right left left and then loop but
06:14 - that's all up to you
06:15 - we're going to take a look at that in
06:18 - the future so for now let's just get the
06:21 - setup right so when we hit play now and
06:26 - click Li the hit 1 it plays and then it
06:31 - just stops we need this to blend back
06:34 - and also I noticed one more thing we
06:37 - have some clipping going on in the right
06:39 - hand corner
06:40 - if we just play this one more time so
06:43 - let's just go ahead and adjust that and
06:46 - I'll show you this in a previous video
06:49 - so select our main camera go to the
06:52 - clipping planes and maybe bring those in
06:54 - even more so something like 0.01 let's
06:59 - see if it's working now if we could get
07:05 - this plane there it's still clipping so
07:09 - we might need to change up the scale and
07:13 - move them a bit since the clipping plane
07:16 - is already really really low so I can
07:20 - see it it looks like our right hand is a
07:23 - little bit much to the left so let's
07:26 - just move that a tiny bit see how it
07:30 - looks
07:31 - it still clips through so we can maybe
07:35 - bring them down just a bit and we can
07:39 - also scale them up or down depending on
07:44 - the result we want now they are a little
07:48 - more centered in the scene I actually
07:50 - want to bring them even more over to the
07:53 - right-hand side even though this looks
07:56 - weird so we might just want to rotate
07:58 - them a bit like that
08:06 - that looks better now that was maybe a
08:09 - little too much so we can bring it back
08:13 - here this is really just about tweaking
08:17 - it until you get the results you want so
08:20 - let's just see if we can get the hit
08:21 - animation to play again oops I can see I
08:25 - have renamed the hit too so I'll just
08:29 - name that back again that was non
08:31 - purpose so hit play and check the hip
08:36 - one and now we can see Dustin clip
08:38 - through so that's perfect that's exactly
08:40 - what we want so now we can go ahead and
08:43 - make the backwards transitions for the
08:46 - hit animations so let's select the hit
08:49 - one hit make transition and then click
08:52 - on the idle now you can click the
08:54 - transition and go under conditions and
08:57 - this time we actually want to leave it
08:59 - at the exit time this is because we want
09:02 - the hit animation to go back to the idle
09:06 - animation whenever it stops playing and
09:08 - this is done using the exit time so
09:12 - let's uncheck the atomic let's zoom in
09:15 - here and see if this works right so when
09:21 - this hits that's maybe a little bit too
09:25 - much blending so just bring that in a
09:27 - bit and I really like that so now
09:32 - whenever I whenever we hit something it
09:36 - will automatically go back when it's the
09:39 - exit time is done one thing you will
09:43 - notice is whenever you adjust this
09:44 - transition the exit time changes and the
09:50 - other way around so that's a really
09:55 - handy thing to know okay so let's do the
09:59 - same with the hit too so right click
10:00 - mate transition click on the idle click
10:03 - on the transition so we can make changes
10:05 - go into the exit time zoom in here and
10:09 - uncheck atomic hit play and we want to
10:13 - bring that down a little bit more like
10:16 - that and hit play
10:20 - and I like that let's just have another
10:23 - look it jumps a little bit so let's see
10:27 - if we can take care of that might be a
10:31 - little bit too smooth down that's
10:35 - perfect okay so the exit time is 0.82
10:39 - great so now we're that we are happy
10:41 - with that we can go ahead and sit test
10:43 - it in game so hit play
10:44 - check the hit one and it will
10:48 - automatically loop because the it's
10:51 - still set to true so we hit it goes back
10:54 - to the idle it recognizes that the hit
10:57 - one is still true and so it placed me
11:00 - hit one again and so loops but if we
11:03 - check the hit two and uncheck the hit
11:06 - one it will start playing the hit to
11:09 - animation and everything works and then
11:11 - the script we are going to have it so
11:12 - that it only becomes true for a very
11:16 - short amount of time so if I just
11:19 - quickly double tap this you can see that
11:22 - it works and the same with the hit -
11:25 - okay awesome now let's do the same with
11:28 - the swing animations so if our idle with
11:31 - weapon is true meaning that we have our
11:33 - weapon on we want to not play the hit or
11:37 - the punch animations but the swing
11:39 - animations so that makes them new let's
11:42 - make some new States and I'm going to do
11:43 - this rather quickly since I've already
11:45 - showed shown you the process so create
11:49 - state MC select the state rename this to
11:52 - swing one make the speed one uncheck
11:55 - food I Keiko and emotion go on the
11:57 - assets then go to the swing swing swing
12:01 - there we have it
12:03 - that one swing one and let's make some
12:07 - actually let's import the other swing
12:09 - animation too so create state MC rename
12:13 - this swing to uncheck foot okay motion
12:18 - assets and let's find the swing to that
12:22 - one
12:23 - let's import that so there we have it
12:26 - and now we can make some transitions so
12:29 - from the idle with weapon we want to
12:31 - right-click make transition to the swing
12:33 - one select the transition go under the
12:36 - hit one because we can use the same
12:38 - variables since mega nimble make sure
12:41 - that we have our weapon on and and so it
12:44 - won't play these hit animations over
12:47 - here so we can actually reuse these
12:49 - which makes it much much easier
12:52 - so if hit one is equal to true it will
12:55 - blend like this and let's see how that
12:57 - is that doesn't look too bad let's see
13:02 - that one more time pretty good let's
13:06 - just bring in the blending a bit and I
13:10 - really like that that's my phone going
13:12 - off sorry I'm just gonna have to pause
13:14 - this for a quick second okay sorry about
13:17 - that that was really unprofessional but
13:19 - let's just pretend it never happens so
13:22 - moving on so we selected our transition
13:25 - here and we unchecked atomic and now
13:29 - let's go and make sure it blends
13:31 - correctly so that looks fine and then
13:34 - condition should be hit is true let's do
13:37 - the same with our swing too so item with
13:41 - weapon to swing to select the transition
13:43 - turn off atomic make the condition hit
13:47 - to is equal to true and let's just
13:51 - adjust the blending here so not that one
13:55 - but that one and bring in that one and
13:59 - there we go and let's see if this is
14:01 - good that looks great
14:05 - and now let's adjust the backward
14:08 - transition so let's make them so right
14:10 - click make transition idle with weapon
14:13 - atomic exit time and let's see if it's
14:20 - feeling good so might be a bit too much
14:28 - that doesn't look too bad maybe give it
14:31 - a little more I was too much let's just
14:36 - leave it there and try with that and
14:38 - let's do it the same with the swing too
14:40 - so they're actually the swing one let's
14:44 - make that even smaller now think about
14:46 - it
14:47 - that looks better now select the swing
14:50 - to transition bring it in the fading
14:53 - just a bit the condition should be exit
14:57 - time and now check/uncheck atomic let's
15:00 - hit play and that looks smooth let's
15:03 - just watch that one more time and I'm
15:05 - pretty satisfied with that so now let's
15:07 - try and run the game and play around
15:10 - with these boolean parameters to see if
15:13 - they match up so check the weapon asan
15:17 - and we can see oops we have an error
15:21 - here in the blending and that is because
15:24 - we need to select our player on main
15:26 - camera and the arms and then uncheck the
15:30 - apply root motion remember whenever you
15:32 - something
15:32 - fades weird or doesn't show up that it's
15:35 - playing we just need to check on check
15:38 - the apply root motion it's a bug inside
15:40 - of unity making them ok so now we have
15:43 - our weapon on we hit the hit 1 and a
15:47 - place and something is not entirely
15:54 - right with the weight loops I don't
15:59 - really like that and in the hit - we
16:04 - have some clipping and a little jumping
16:07 - - so in the swing one let's just adjust
16:10 - it to have a little more of a fade curve
16:13 - and the same in this swing - and that's
16:17 - also go under the arms in the scene view
16:20 - and maybe bring them follow it a bit
16:23 - let's see what works because we have
16:26 - quite a lot of clipping going on still
16:29 - so that looks fine in-game and maybe we
16:33 - can bring them up also it might be too
16:39 - much this is really just about playing
16:42 - around so on let's see if we had play
16:45 - now and we have the weapon asan playing
16:48 - they are too far from the camera so
16:51 - let's stop playing bring them back a bit
16:56 - that was a little too much hit play
17:01 - I like that and now let's hit the hit
17:04 - one and that looks great so we have some
17:09 - nice blending there and you hit two you
17:14 - still have some clipping problems to
17:16 - wait on there and then the uncheck the
17:22 - weapon is on and hit the hit one you can
17:26 - see that working now we have some more
17:28 - clipping issues and the same with the
17:30 - hit too but the animation are working so
17:32 - now you just really need to move them
17:35 - around scale them around and rotate them
17:39 - until you're clipping issues disappear
17:42 - and remember you can also always adjust
17:45 - the clipping planes actually I know
17:47 - what's bothering us here the the main
17:52 - camera is what is drawing or everything
17:57 - except our arms I remember in the last
18:00 - tutorial we made it so that we have a
18:03 - separate camera called draw always with
18:07 - which would draw only our arms here and
18:10 - we didn't adjust the clipping planes on
18:13 - that so that's why we are having so many
18:14 - clipping issues so you can just go ahead
18:17 - and bump that down to syrup on 0-3 and
18:20 - let's see this working hopefully so now
18:24 - let's hit something there we go that
18:28 - looks awesome hit the other way it looks
18:31 - good
18:32 - turn off the weapon hit something that
18:35 - looks perfect and hit something and now
18:39 - everything is working perfectly together
18:42 - so hope you enjoyed this tutorial I know
18:45 - it was a lot of fiddling around but also
18:47 - there were some cool tips and tricks and
18:50 - yeah hope you enjoyed it and I'll see
18:52 - you in the next video
