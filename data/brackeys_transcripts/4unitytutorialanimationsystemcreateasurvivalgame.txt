00:00 - [Music]
00:03 - hello 1 and welcome to the fourth
00:05 - tutorial in the create a survival game
00:08 - series done by Brad keys I am the CEO of
00:10 - practice and today we are going to take
00:13 - a look at creating some animation for
00:16 - our character and this might be quite a
00:19 - long process so I don't know if I can
00:22 - fit it all into this tutorial but we'll
00:26 - see so I've opened up my unity project
00:30 - and before we get started I just want to
00:32 - fix a few things so first of all
00:35 - double-click on the standard assets
00:37 - folder double click on the character
00:38 - controllers and now go ahead and just
00:41 - delete the third person controller we
00:43 - don't really need this it's just taking
00:46 - up space and if you want you can go into
00:48 - the skyboxes and delete the skyboxes if
00:51 - you don't need I'm just gonna leave them
00:53 - there if I decide to change it later on
00:56 - we can delete them when we're done
01:00 - ok so I just want to make a some folders
01:04 - for our scripts and our animations to
01:07 - make it a little bit more organized so
01:09 - right-click in the assets window in the
01:13 - project panel and create folder and then
01:18 - I'm going to rename this to scripts and
01:22 - I'm going to drag the two scripts in
01:26 - that folder and make one more for the
01:31 - animation so animations I'm going to
01:34 - drag the attack into that folder ok
01:38 - great
01:39 - so first of all we'll need a idle
01:43 - animation so if we go under play and
01:45 - main camera and select our melee this is
01:49 - where the melee system script is hatched
01:52 - and under the melee is our maze and
01:56 - simply what we're going to do is we're
01:59 - going to place all the different
02:01 - animations on the different weapons
02:03 - because some some weapons might be
02:06 - heavier heavier and then neat
02:11 - others kinds of animation slower
02:13 - animations and stuff like that so
02:16 - individual animations for individual
02:18 - weapons and what we're going to do is
02:22 - we're going to open up the animation
02:24 - panel I have it down here in the project
02:27 - pane but you can go to window and then
02:30 - just hit animation or press control 6
02:33 - okay so now where it says attack you can
02:36 - click that and click create new clip and
02:39 - just call this for idle and then hit
02:44 - save and hit the record button and I'm
02:49 - going to make a curves in the position Y
02:53 - and I'm going to also in the yes in the
02:59 - position Y and I'm gonna drag this about
03:03 - 4 seconds into the timeline and you can
03:09 - just zoom out regularly so the 4 second
03:15 - mark there and I'm going to create yet
03:18 - another key and the same for the
03:21 - rotation a key and a key and I won't go
03:27 - into the difference between keys and
03:30 - curves you can look it up if you want
03:33 - but alright so I'm just gonna make sure
03:37 - that everything is keyframes properly
03:41 - yes that looks fine all right so I'm
03:45 - going to drag the slider into two
03:49 - seconds then I'm going to move it the
03:52 - mace it is a bit to the left and a
03:56 - little bit up a little bit and rotate it
04:00 - a little bit to the left also so if we
04:04 - just go ahead and preview this you can
04:07 - see that it creates creates this smooth
04:11 - looking motion and then it goes back and
04:15 - now I want it to continue on to the
04:18 - other side so I'll just zoom out a
04:21 - little more
04:22 - and just create again keyframes at the
04:25 - position eight and this way I am sure
04:28 - that will always return to the point we
04:30 - came form so add key and key at key and
04:36 - you guessed it at key add key and add
04:40 - key all right so you can also just shift
04:44 - select them all but for now this will do
04:48 - so all right so if we select them all
04:51 - and if hit F we can get a good log on
04:54 - what's going on now slide to six and
04:57 - then move it a little bit to the right
05:01 - rotate it a little bit to the right and
05:04 - move it upwards a little bit and now if
05:07 - we take a look this might be a pretty
05:09 - violent Idol yeah it's a bit too much
05:16 - really but this is the basics of it if
05:24 - we go ahead and select all the keyframes
05:26 - right click on them and say flat this
05:29 - was will smooth out the animations just
05:32 - a bit and if we let me see if we just
05:44 - select all of the keyframes we might be
05:48 - able to if we make a new keyframe at the
05:52 - value of 10 just add the keys and we
06:02 - then select all of these on the top and
06:08 - we hold down shift and we drag on this
06:10 - you can see that we can expand all the
06:13 - others wait this is not working we can
06:17 - okay try to delete this again and the
06:20 - animation system is unit in unit is so
06:23 - barky okay so we could you could go
06:26 - ahead and drag around with these and
06:28 - just make it a little bit longer so the
06:32 - movements won't be so quick
06:35 - and heavy make it a little bit more
06:42 - lights but yes play around with it I'm
06:46 - sure you'll find something you like so
06:49 - down here where it says default you can
06:51 - change this to loop because we wanted to
06:53 - live and you can turn off the recording
06:56 - okay so now we have an idle animation
07:00 - now we just simply want to add this to a
07:03 - script but first of all we need to get
07:06 - this in order so go to project and then
07:10 - drag in the idle where it says attack
07:12 - and this is just the default animation
07:14 - that it'll be playing so when we turn on
07:18 - the play automatically it won't just
07:20 - automatically attack it will
07:21 - automatically play the idol and then we
07:25 - can just if you want and shift up these
07:28 - so this gets to be idle and this gets to
07:33 - be attacked but that's just me it's not
07:37 - necessary okay so now go to the melee
07:40 - double click on the melee system script
07:43 - to open it up in monodevelop and in here
07:48 - you see that we have one line regarding
07:50 - the animation it's called the animation
07:52 - animation top play attack and if we just
07:56 - make a line above that we can go ahead
07:58 - and make these two lines and the dashes
08:04 - and we can just now make a comment so
08:08 - these two mean comments so everything I
08:11 - write here that gets marked with green
08:14 - won't have any effect on the script
08:16 - whatsoever it's just to organize so we
08:19 - can just write attack animation and we
08:26 - can go ahead and make a line onto and
08:28 - write attack function and we can go down
08:38 - here now
08:39 - I'll do the if let me just check here so
08:44 - we can go ahead and make a
08:48 - new line under the if statement under
08:50 - the closing bracket of the if statement
08:53 - and here we can go ahead and type that
08:56 - death the Mase if the maze maze dot
09:07 - animation that is playing is equal to
09:12 - false then we want something to happen
09:15 - so this line is really simple we just
09:19 - say that if the mace is not playing
09:21 - anything then we want something to
09:23 - happen and the thing we want to happen
09:28 - is simply that we want to make sure we
09:30 - are playing an idol because this is our
09:32 - default animation so the maze dot
09:37 - animation don't cross fate and then
09:45 - parenthesis idle and close it up so it's
09:53 - that symbol so if we go into unity now
09:55 - save this off and go into unity and
09:57 - check for errors no errors and then hit
10:02 - play you can see the idle animation
10:06 - playing and looping and when we attack
10:08 - it all go back so this is this is
10:12 - perfect by default so let's go ahead and
10:15 - create yet another animation and this
10:18 - will be our run animation so go into
10:24 - unity and go into the animation panel
10:27 - control six and now select on race and
10:31 - then wets this idle like that and create
10:35 - click create new clip and then name it
10:38 - to sprint and all right so now hit the
10:46 - record button and go to the beginning of
10:50 - the animation there you go and as always
10:54 - keyframe everything with the rotation
10:59 - and the position
11:01 - and I'm gonna do this really quick and
11:05 - go to the two second mark and just make
11:09 - some drastic changes maybe some rotation
11:12 - and then oh okay let's just quickly make
11:18 - sure that we get back first
11:22 - safely and without screwing everything
11:24 - up so create all the keyframes when you
11:27 - want the maze to be back in its default
11:30 - position and then in between we can do
11:33 - all the drastic changes changes so yeah
11:40 - something like that
11:41 - and same going to happen over here again
11:50 - please do this and other applications
11:52 - I'm just showing it off in unity because
11:54 - you can technically be done in unity but
11:58 - it's it's definitely not recommended so
12:01 - um go here and make it bounce up again
12:06 - and make it rotate so now if we select
12:10 - all of the frames have F right click on
12:13 - one of the points she was flat and then
12:16 - hit play and this is not cool for
12:21 - running and this should be faster so we
12:23 - can go ahead and drag these and if
12:27 - you're wondering what the difference
12:29 - between the keyframes in the top and the
12:31 - keyframes down here the keyframes in the
12:34 - top is simply when you select that you
12:38 - select all the keyframes at that current
12:40 - time and this is keyframes for different
12:42 - values so if you hit play yes this is
12:47 - much better I would like some more
12:49 - motion though would like it to go all
12:52 - kinds of crazy like this and maybe be
12:59 - even faster so halftime
13:07 - and the last one and they play yes this
13:14 - is this is cool some weird breaks and
13:17 - stuff you can take a look at those play
13:21 - around with them I won't do all of this
13:24 - now
13:25 - maybe select them and play around if
13:30 - they are smooth thing and stuff make it
13:32 - flat a broken other kinds of weird stuff
13:37 - but I'm sure you can get it to look all
13:40 - right
13:41 - even inside unity so I'm hit this the
13:44 - record button again to stop recording
13:46 - and now we could just simply implement
13:52 - this in our script so stop recording and
13:56 - then go back to my develop and now we
13:59 - are going to type F input dots get key
14:07 - and I'll just quickly explain the
14:11 - different get button get key okay so
14:14 - input dot get button or get button down
14:16 - or get button up is simply you refer to
14:22 - the presets that unity has set up so
14:25 - that could be fine one that could be a
14:27 - preset called jump and you can make
14:30 - presets yourself too and this is
14:33 - basically to ensure that it's not just
14:35 - the spacebar if you're on a PC it's also
14:39 - the B button on a Xbox or the X on a
14:45 - Playstation and stuff like that so it
14:49 - can scale but for now we're just going
14:52 - to type get ki and get ki is one
14:54 - specific key so if get ki and get ki is
15:00 - something that will be called all the
15:02 - time when you have the key down so it
15:06 - will get cold as long as the key is down
15:09 - and on the in the down the pressing down
15:14 - the key itself in pawtucket key down
15:17 - simply just called
15:19 - and that when is Dennis when the key is
15:22 - pressed and the gate key up explains
15:26 - itself it's the same part when you
15:28 - release the key are you so get key and
15:32 - then instead of typing this so typing
15:38 - shift you can't do that you have to type
15:41 - because unity doesn't recognize the key
15:44 - shift so you have to go go inside key
15:47 - code dot left shift and this way
15:54 - this way unity simply knows what key you
15:57 - mean and then close this off with
16:01 - another parenthesis and then curly
16:03 - brackets and some space and now you can
16:07 - go ahead and type the maze dot animation
16:11 - - crossfade and the difference between
16:16 - cross crossfade and play when you say
16:20 - that the animation needs to play and you
16:23 - have your character in a certain
16:26 - position it will just jump from that
16:29 - position to the beginning of the
16:32 - position of the other clip immediately
16:35 - so you can get these weird shifts but if
16:39 - you use that crossfade it will simply
16:42 - fade the movement so you won't get that
16:45 - harsh harsh shifting in transform okay
16:48 - so start cross-strait and now you can
16:51 - simply type sprints because we have
16:54 - named the clip sprint and then a
16:57 - semicolon but if we go into a unity
17:01 - hello unity and then press shift running
17:07 - and then stop you can see that the
17:10 - animation plays itself out before it
17:13 - stops and we don't want this so what we
17:17 - are going to do is we are going to make
17:18 - a new statement called F and and here we
17:24 - are going to type input dot
17:30 - get key up and then keycode don't sprint
17:39 - Oh that shift sorry and close this off
17:46 - come on monodevelop is hanging around so
17:51 - and stop messing with me okay so if we
18:01 - get the key up some when we release the
18:04 - instrument then we need the animation to
18:07 - be animation or they may start animation
18:10 - dot cross free idle so we go back to the
18:17 - idle and this way oh I'm in narrow Oh
18:24 - missing parentheses back to unity
18:28 - hopefully in our Irish yes and then
18:31 - equate so we can sprint and stops
18:36 - printing immediately and the position
18:38 - will go back to the default idle this is
18:41 - perfect
18:42 - you will notice though that you can hold
18:44 - down the shift to sprint while standing
18:47 - this is a little weird so we'll be doing
18:51 - some stuff with that later but for now
18:53 - this is the animation system that we'll
18:55 - be using just to get you started with
18:58 - some cool animation so thank you for
19:02 - watching this tutorial and I'll see you
19:05 - next time
19:06 - [Music]
19:27 - you
