00:30 - just a canvas with two buttons that will
00:32 - hover over any selected turret the first
00:35 - one is the upgrade button which we will
00:37 - make actually do something today and
00:40 - then in the next video we can do
00:41 - something with the sell button so um
00:44 - yeah before we get started with this I
00:46 - just want to fix a very quick uh little
00:48 - bug that I uh discovered when turning
00:51 - off the recording uh from the last video
00:54 - and that is if we currently have Play
00:56 - and play some turrets at the very top of
00:58 - our map here so let's just place some
01:00 - right here you can see if we try and
01:02 - place these at the very top of some of
01:05 - these nodes it's not going to give a
01:07 - hover animation and nothing happens when
01:08 - we presses it when we press it and also
01:11 - if we try to select one of these you can
01:13 - see that sometimes doesn't work it does
01:16 - if we click down here but not at the top
01:19 - so what is happening here well it's
01:22 - actually our top canvas that is
01:24 - currently overlaying our map a bit and
01:27 - because that has a graphic raycaster
01:30 - that will sometimes block uh any
01:32 - information about uh having clicked on
01:34 - an object so what we want to do is
01:36 - simply disable this graphic raycaster I
01:39 - believe you can just remove the
01:40 - component as well I'm just going to keep
01:42 - it there and that should actually fix
01:44 - that box so now if we go in here we
01:46 - should see that um everything if we
01:49 - select the chart everything highlights
01:51 - properly and that we can correctly shift
01:54 - between the different turrets much
01:56 - better awesome so what I want to begin
01:59 - with here is is our node script that
02:01 - sits on every node object in the game
02:03 - oops that's our enemy script our node
02:05 - script here and you can see quite a lot
02:08 - is going on in here and I actually want
02:09 - to add more stuff to this um because I
02:12 - think the current way that we are
02:13 - building turrets can be made made a lot
02:16 - more logical so if we have a look here
02:19 - we have a function called on Mouse down
02:21 - so whenever we press uh the node we
02:24 - check are we over any goey if we are we
02:26 - don't want to do anything do we really
02:28 - want to select this node in uh in that
02:31 - case then we want to do that uh can we
02:33 - build there if we can't then we skip out
02:36 - and if we pass through all of these if
02:38 - statement well then we're ready to build
02:39 - a turret and we do that by calling build
02:42 - turret on and then passing in the node
02:45 - and that uh function sits on the build
02:47 - manager I think it would be a lot more
02:50 - sensical to have this function sit on
02:52 - the Node itself because we have building
02:54 - on the Node so we might as well have the
02:56 - function on the Node also we're passing
02:58 - in an instance of uh of or a reference
03:01 - to this instance of the class and then
03:04 - we're changing stuff inside of our build
03:05 - manager if we go into our build manager
03:07 - here you can see that we are accessing
03:10 - turret under the node and changing that
03:12 - and there's no reason to do that using a
03:14 - reference when we can just do all of it
03:16 - locally so let's change this so let's go
03:18 - in here and create a separate function
03:20 - and we're just going to call this one
03:22 - build turret and instead of uh taking in
03:24 - a node we are going to take in a
03:26 - blueprint so we're going to take in here
03:29 - a turret blueprint containing the
03:31 - information about the turret that we
03:32 - want to build and let's just call this
03:34 - one
03:36 - blueprint whoops let me not mess up the
03:39 - parentheses there awesome so this is
03:42 - what we want to call down here so we
03:43 - want to go build turret and then we want
03:46 - to pass in some kind of blueprint and we
03:48 - will talk about where we get this from
03:50 - in a moment then inside of our build
03:52 - manager we can take all of this code
03:55 - copy it and delete it and delete the
03:58 - entire function save that and go into
04:01 - our node and paste that here so now we
04:05 - can use our blueprint instead of the
04:06 - turd to build so in here we go
04:08 - blueprint. cost um we go blueprint. cost
04:13 - there there as well we go instantiate
04:15 - blueprint. prefab and we want to use get
04:19 - build position but we don't need to
04:21 - reference it through a node now so you
04:23 - can see we are removing a lot of
04:25 - unnecessary references here so again we
04:27 - don't want to go node. turret and uh
04:30 - currently these are both called turret
04:32 - our turret up here and the temporary
04:35 - turret right here so let's just go ahead
04:37 - and rename this to underscore turret and
04:39 - do that there as well so we can
04:41 - distinguish between the turret we just
04:43 - instantiated and our local field
04:46 - variable up there then we have the
04:48 - effect here and we want to uh
04:50 - instantiate a build effect and we could
04:53 - either have this sit on the blueprint as
04:55 - well that would make sense because then
04:57 - you would be able to have different
04:58 - effects for different turrets when
05:00 - building them but since we don't want to
05:03 - create that let's just have this still
05:05 - sit on the game um on on the build
05:07 - manager so in that case we could simply
05:09 - go build manager. build effect and
05:13 - because this is a public variable that's
05:15 - totally accessible and again we our gu
05:19 - get build position here is just a local
05:21 - uh function so we don't need a reference
05:23 - and everything else looks fine I also
05:26 - want to remove this money left thing
05:28 - because we now have a money this counter
05:30 - so we can just display turet
05:32 - build cool so this function should
05:35 - actually work just fine now however we
05:37 - still need to pass in the correct
05:39 - blueprint and this of course sits on the
05:41 - build manager our build manager is
05:43 - responsible for figuring out what to
05:45 - build next so he has a variable called
05:48 - turn to build and instead of making this
05:51 - public which means that we could then
05:53 - also change it from outside of the
05:55 - script let's just have a function called
05:58 - um get tur to build so we simply go down
06:01 - here just like we have a select turr to
06:03 - build and again this is why we don't
06:06 - want to make it public publicly
06:08 - accessible that means that we would be
06:09 - able to change it without also
06:11 - deselecting nodes and we don't want to
06:13 - do that we want to always deselect our
06:15 - notes when we change the tur to bill so
06:18 - let's just make another public void here
06:20 - and actually it's not going to be a
06:21 - public void it's going to be a public
06:23 - turret blueprint called get turret to
06:28 - build
06:30 - and this is simply going to return the
06:32 - turret to build there we go it's that
06:34 - easy so inside of our node now we go
06:36 - build turret and then we go build
06:39 - manager. get turet to
06:42 - build cool so now things should be
06:44 - working and we can definitely try this
06:46 - out so let's just hit play and let's try
06:49 - building some turrets and you can see
06:51 - that works just fine so now that we have
06:55 - our code grouped a little more logically
06:57 - we can also go ahead and add a
06:59 - functionality as well so we have our
07:01 - build turret let's also make a public
07:04 - and this time I want it to be public
07:06 - because we want this to be called from
07:08 - without the class and this is going to
07:10 - be a public void called
07:12 - upgrade actually let's do upgrade turret
07:16 - just to be very specific on what's going
07:18 - on and in here we are essentially want
07:21 - to do a lot of the same stuff so let's
07:23 - just take off this code and then edit it
07:25 - a tiny bit so if player stats. money is
07:28 - less than blue print Dot and then we
07:30 - want to have an upgrade
07:33 - cost and uh if it's not well then we
07:36 - want to say not enough money to upgrade
07:40 - that and then return we also want to
07:42 - subtract our upgrade
07:46 - cost and we're going to be making this
07:48 - variable in a second and the thing that
07:50 - we want to build is no longer blueprint.
07:53 - prefab we want to instead build
07:56 - blueprint. um upgraded prefab
08:01 - and the same build position and
08:03 - everything we can also have a separate
08:05 - effect right now we're just using build
08:06 - manager. build effect we could also have
08:09 - a build manager. upgrade effect if you
08:11 - want that to look different but I think
08:13 - the build effect looks really cool and I
08:15 - think it would work fine for upgrades so
08:17 - far but you can definitely go in and
08:19 - change this and then we want to say
08:22 - debug.log turret
08:24 - upgraded however remember we currently
08:26 - have a turret there already so we can't
08:28 - just instance the upgraded turret then
08:30 - we are going to have two turrets sitting
08:32 - there we also need to get rid of the
08:34 - previous version so in order to do that
08:36 - we use the fact that we have a reference
08:38 - to that turret right up here and what I
08:41 - also want to do is I want to go in here
08:44 - and uh instead of having this as an
08:47 - optional uh optional variable I actually
08:49 - want to make this non-editable I want to
08:52 - hide this in the inspector and remember
08:55 - you can use this whenever you need a
08:56 - public variable that you can access from
08:58 - anywhere
09:00 - but that you don't want people to edit
09:02 - inside of the inspector and this is one
09:03 - of those and we're going to have
09:05 - multiple we're also going to have a
09:07 - public uh turd blueprint which is going
09:10 - to be our current turet
09:13 - blueprint and we also going to have an a
09:17 - third one which is going to be a public
09:20 - Boolean whoops public
09:23 - Boolean um saying whether or not the
09:26 - turret is upgraded so we're going to
09:28 - default that TOA
09:30 - and then we're going to switch it down
09:31 - here so let's first of all set is
09:34 - upgraded to True whoops this is inside
09:37 - of the build tet we want to do that down
09:39 - here we want to set is upgraded to True
09:42 - whenever we are done
09:43 - upgrading
09:45 - and okay so all of that is great and
09:50 - then let's see here we also want to get
09:53 - rid of the old turret and currently
09:55 - blueprint here um is actually called
09:58 - turret blueprint so let's just go ahead
10:00 - and change that so this is going to be
10:02 - turret
10:04 - blueprint there we go there we go and
10:06 - there we go and uh here before
10:09 - instantiating the new turret let's get
10:10 - rid of the old run so we just go destroy
10:15 - turret and it's already a game object so
10:17 - we can simply go like that so get rid of
10:21 - the old
10:24 - turret and here we
10:28 - are building a new
10:32 - one awesome so all we really need to do
10:36 - now is have some way of calling this
10:38 - function because it should totally work
10:41 - however we don't call it from anywhere
10:43 - and one thing we of course we run into
10:46 - is the fact that we haven't up uh added
10:48 - the upgrade cost added the upgrade cost
10:52 - and the upgraded prefa um variables to
10:55 - our turd blueprint so let's do that
10:57 - first so let's go and find find our
10:59 - third blueprint script and let's just
11:02 - add two new variables just the exact
11:04 - same way that we have our two previous
11:06 - one we are going to have a public game
11:08 - object which is going to be the
11:10 - upgraded upgraded prefab and we are
11:14 - going to have a public in with the uh
11:17 - upgrade
11:18 - cost there we go and you could
11:21 - essentially make a system for upgrading
11:23 - turrets infinitely by simply uh adding
11:26 - on to their um variables so we could
11:28 - just increase their damage by a fixed
11:30 - amount and the range by a fixed amount
11:33 - but I think that we're going to limit
11:34 - ourselves to have uh every turret have
11:36 - like two versions a non-upgraded and an
11:39 - upgraded you could also create an array
11:41 - or a list of turrets uh that you cycle
11:44 - through so first step you have the
11:46 - Second Step third step and um every and
11:50 - you can adjust the uh cost and uh edit
11:52 - every game object for each step and that
11:55 - would of course mean a fixed amount of
11:57 - upgrades but it would meaning uh mean
11:59 - that you have more than one I think
12:01 - we're going to stick to the simple
12:02 - approach because well we've done that
12:04 - all the way through and I think it's
12:06 - worked out just fine but that is
12:08 - something that you should definitely
12:09 - experiment on your own I believe with
12:11 - the tools that you've gotten from the
12:13 - series so far that you should be able to
12:14 - do that so um of course if you run into
12:17 - problems doing something like that you
12:19 - can always visit the um breis Forum at
12:22 - forum. bre.com uh where people really
12:25 - want to help you with that kind of stuff
12:27 - so uh yeah so now we can save this and
12:31 - uh we should get rid of those errors in
12:34 - here and we have so that's awesome so
12:37 - again we just need to call this upgrade
12:39 - tet function and when do we want to do
12:42 - that well we want to do that whenever we
12:44 - press the upgrade button so in case
12:46 - we've instantiated a turret we've
12:48 - selected it and we' pressed the upgrade
12:50 - button that is when we want this stuff
12:52 - to happen so let's uh create some
12:55 - functionality for this so let's find our
12:57 - node UI and let's um uh double click
13:01 - that to open it up in monu develop in
13:03 - Visual Studio I'm sorry and in here
13:06 - whenever we set the target we don't want
13:08 - to do anything we want to create a
13:10 - public void here called
13:14 - upgrade and we want to hook this up to
13:16 - our button so that whenever we press our
13:18 - button it will call this function right
13:21 - here and this is simply going to go
13:23 - Target do upgrade Target boom that's all
13:27 - we need to do while we can also do in
13:29 - here is hide the menu right after we do
13:32 - that so we simply go build manager.
13:34 - instance do um deselect node so that
13:39 - whenever we upgrade something the menu
13:42 - doesn't stay open it's just going to uh
13:44 - close it and we're good to go you could
13:47 - also just call the height function
13:49 - directly but that will actually mess uh
13:51 - things up a bit um because the node will
13:54 - still be selected but the UI will just
13:56 - be hidden so this is the way uh you want
13:58 - to do
14:00 - it uh yeah cool I believe that's all we
14:04 - need to do so now we just need to hook
14:06 - things up our node UI is fine but we
14:09 - need to go into our shop which is under
14:12 - the overlay Canvas Shop here and we need
14:15 - to find the place where we are uh
14:17 - setting up these different turret
14:19 - Blueprints and of course we need to add
14:21 - an upgraded prefab and an upgrade cost
14:24 - so um the upgrade cost here I'm just
14:26 - going to set to something like 60 and of
14:29 - course you should definitely try this
14:30 - out turny and balance it do some math on
14:33 - it what makes sense here um uh compared
14:37 - to just buying new turrets and stuff
14:39 - like that but I'm just pulling this uh
14:41 - number out of uh out of the eror and
14:43 - then we can see um what happens with it
14:47 - and then we have an upgraded prefab and
14:49 - we need to go in and create this so
14:50 - let's find our um standard turd preat
14:53 - let's duplicate this and let's call this
14:55 - standard turret uncore upgraded
14:59 - and uh we can just drag this into the
15:01 - inspector so we can have a look at it so
15:03 - I want to bump up the range to 20 I want
15:05 - to change the fire rate to something
15:07 - like
15:08 - 1.5 and I definitely also want to edit
15:11 - the bullet prefab so let's create a
15:13 - separate prefab here uh for the bullet
15:16 - here so this is going to be be the
15:18 - bullet
15:20 - upgraded and we can go in here and drag
15:23 - our bullet in there and uh hit apply on
15:26 - that we can find our bullet upgraded
15:29 - and I want to just bump up the damage on
15:31 - this a bit to something like 70 and bump
15:35 - up the speed to something like
15:37 - 80 cool and U what we can then actually
15:40 - I don't want to bump up the speed I
15:42 - think that's fine at
15:43 - 70 um cool and then we can create some
15:47 - separate materials to make this actually
15:49 - pop so let's uh draging our bullet here
15:51 - so we can see what's going on with it
15:53 - and where is it it's it's down there so
15:55 - let's just pull it over here so we can
15:57 - see what's going on awesome so let's go
16:00 - under our materials and let's find our
16:02 - bullet material again we want to
16:04 - duplicate this control D or command D
16:06 - and do bullet uncore upgraded drag that
16:09 - onto the bullet and then let's make this
16:12 - red to really make it pop it's awesome
16:16 - and we can delete that then we can uh
16:19 - edit the materials for our standard
16:21 - turet upgraded as well you can bring in
16:23 - a new model here no one's saying that
16:25 - you shouldn't do that you can also just
16:28 - have it look the exact same but I think
16:30 - you should make something different
16:31 - about it you could display the upgrade
16:34 - level using some kind of UI but we're
16:37 - just going to be modifying the material
16:38 - and making it a bit bigger so the scale
16:40 - here I want to do 1.2.
16:43 - 2.2 H apply on
16:45 - that and I also want to edit the
16:48 - material so let's go and find our
16:49 - Imports find the standard turd go new
16:52 - materials and you can see I've already
16:54 - created a folder here called materials
16:57 - upgraded and I just want to take all of
17:00 - these duplicate them and drag them in
17:03 - there awesome so this is going to be the
17:06 - uh turd uncore upgraded uncore barrels
17:10 - this is going to be the
17:12 - turd uh
17:14 - underscore upgraded uncore Main and
17:18 - finally we are going to have the turret
17:21 - underscore um upgraded uncore
17:25 - secondary cool and then we can edit
17:27 - these so uh of course we need to drag
17:29 - them in so let's select our standard tet
17:31 - upgraded here uh let's find our uh base
17:36 - no our pot to rotate find our head here
17:39 - and let's drag this in so we're going to
17:41 - have our upgraded barrels our upgraded
17:43 - Main and I upgraded secondary and hit
17:47 - apply and you can actually go in and
17:49 - edit the base as well but I think I want
17:51 - the base to stay the same and all I
17:54 - really want to do here is find our
17:55 - secondary color and make this red
18:00 - so just to know uh just to show the user
18:02 - that there isn't a variation on this
18:04 - turret I think this combined uh with the
18:07 - scale of the turret is going to make it
18:09 - very clear which turrets are upgraded
18:12 - and which turrets are not while still
18:14 - keeping the overall look and feel of the
18:17 - turret so you can see that this is just
18:19 - another version of that
18:21 - turret cool so uh now we can select our
18:24 - shop and we can drag our upgraded prefab
18:27 - in there so that's fine our standard
18:29 - turret underscore upgraded and drag it
18:32 - in there and we should be able to play
18:34 - the missile launcher and the laser
18:36 - Beamer will do in the next video I think
18:38 - um this one is already fairly long and U
18:41 - we're not completely done yet so in the
18:43 - next video we'll uh definitely hook
18:45 - those up so uh let's try and hit play
18:48 - and uh
18:50 - let's spawn in some turs here and you
18:53 - can see currently that our upgrade cost
18:55 - doesn't update um but it should be the
18:58 - appropriate cost here you can see we're
19:00 - currently on this much money and when
19:01 - hit I hit
19:03 - upgrade oh of course we need to hook up
19:05 - our buttons as well so uh we need to go
19:08 - and find our node UI find our buttons
19:11 - and then the upgrade button and uh we
19:13 - are just going to add an onclick event
19:16 - onto this so let's hit uh plus there and
19:18 - let's um drag in our node UI and go on
19:23 - node UI and then upgrade in order to
19:26 - actually call that method that we
19:27 - created uh whenever we uh we upgrade
19:30 - stuff so let's try that again so now
19:33 - we're going to go in here create some
19:36 - turrets and I'm going to hit upgrade and
19:39 - we have another reference exception so
19:41 - that's awesome let's find out what's
19:43 - going on all right so I figured out what
19:45 - the mistake was and that's just me being
19:47 - stupid so of course inside of our node
19:50 - whenever we are building the turret we
19:52 - also need to make sure that we are
19:54 - setting the Tet blueprint equal to the
19:57 - um blueprint that was passed in there we
20:01 - go so we're passing in the blueprint of
20:03 - the turret that we want to build and we
20:06 - need to also make sure to save that on
20:08 - the Node now it's done we made the
20:10 - variable accessible but we didn't
20:12 - actually change it in any way and that
20:14 - was why we were getting that no
20:15 - reference exception so let's try this
20:18 - one more time so let's uh build three
20:20 - turrets let's try upgrading and boom
20:22 - there we go awesome so that's working
20:25 - and it's looking super super cool
20:28 - cool and you can see the second time
20:30 - here I can actually keep upgrading these
20:33 - and that's a problem and also our UI is
20:35 - currently not updating uh to show um the
20:38 - actual cost of that so that's what we're
20:40 - going to be editing now and that's the
20:42 - last thing we're going to be doing in
20:43 - this video so let's very quickly have a
20:46 - look at how we can change this so if we
20:47 - go under a node UI let's begin by
20:50 - looking at how we can make the um
20:53 - upgrade cost actually update so let's
20:56 - enable our canvas and let's also so
20:58 - remove the rotation here while we edit
21:00 - it and let's go into 2D mode so you can
21:03 - see under our upgrade button we have a
21:05 - text variable and this is containing
21:07 - both the upgrade uh title and the uh
21:11 - cost let's split this up into two
21:13 - different variable so let's have this
21:15 - one be our text and duplicate that and
21:19 - this is what this one is going to be the
21:21 - actual uh cost or
21:23 - amount and uh let's rename that to cost
21:27 - then we you can simply take the text
21:29 - here drag that up to something like
21:32 - 30.25 is going to be fine and drag our
21:35 - cost down so we split it in half and
21:38 - then we take our cost here and angle our
21:40 - text to the top and we take our text and
21:42 - angle that to the bottom there we go so
21:45 - we have the exact same thing but now
21:48 - it's split up into two different objects
21:49 - and that just makes it easier to handle
21:51 - uh inside of um visual studio so uh what
21:55 - we're going to do is take our text here
21:57 - change that to upgrade without the um
22:00 - bold tags and we can simply go in here
22:02 - and now change this to robotto bold from
22:04 - the very beginning and uh everything
22:07 - else looks good of course we want to
22:09 - update this on the sell Button as well
22:11 - so what we'll do is simply go in here
22:14 - remove the sell button duplicate the
22:16 - upgrade button and we simply go in here
22:18 - and change the text to sell change the
22:21 - cost to I don't know let's just do 50
22:25 - here and let's change the uh button name
22:28 - to
22:29 - cell cool and of course we want to
22:31 - remove the on click
22:33 - event there we go so what we then do is
22:36 - go under our node UI double click that
22:38 - and we create a reference to our text
22:40 - object containing the cost so we go
22:42 - under uh up here and include Unity
22:45 - engine. UI so we can make a reference to
22:49 - a text object so we're going to make a
22:51 - public text here which is going to be
22:53 - the upgrade upgrade cost and then when
22:58 - we set a new Target meaning that well
23:00 - we've selected a turret we're going to
23:02 - move it and we're going to set the UI to
23:05 - active and we're also going to go
23:07 - upgrade cost. text is now equal to
23:11 - Target do turret blueprint do cost and
23:15 - of course we want to add onto this the
23:18 - dollar sign there we go that's all we
23:21 - need to do there and um yeah so that
23:25 - should actually update so if we just
23:27 - make sure to drag in the UI element so
23:29 - we drag in our um and we need to find
23:32 - that so let's select our node UI let's
23:34 - drag in not the text but the cost there
23:37 - and we disabled the canvas we should see
23:40 - this working already so if we go in here
23:42 - and create a tur and this should say 60
23:45 - now and it doesn't it says a 100 so why
23:50 - does it do that let's find out so let's
23:53 - go on our shop overl Canvas Shop and
23:57 - let's let's see the upgrade cost is
23:59 - currently 60 and that's why so we using
24:02 - cost and not upgrade cost awesome so now
24:05 - we should see this working and we can
24:07 - also go under the canvas and rotate this
24:09 - on 35° again just rotate it back to
24:13 - where it was before and now we should
24:15 - this see this update here so there we go
24:18 - and if we were to spawn in a missile
24:20 - launcher which currently has an a
24:22 - default upgrade cost of zero you can see
24:24 - that it says that as well so it does
24:26 - update depending on the turn awesome so
24:30 - uh the final thing that I wanted to do
24:33 - was just make it so that we can't
24:36 - upgrade um when multiple times so we
24:39 - have upgraded one uh time and otherwise
24:42 - it's just going to disable that button
24:44 - and all we really need to do here is go
24:46 - in and use the fact that we now have a
24:48 - variable under a Target called is
24:50 - upgraded so in case we already
24:53 - upgraded then we want to disable this
24:56 - button uh and we only want to uh change
24:59 - the upgrade text here in case we're not
25:01 - so we're going to go in here create an
25:02 - uh if statement saying if target. is not
25:06 - upgraded then we want to set the upgrade
25:09 - cost.
25:11 - text and all of that and if it is so if
25:14 - it's already upgraded then we want to do
25:17 - upgrade uh cost. text and set that equal
25:20 - to um done or upgraded or maxed out or
25:26 - whatever and what we also want to do is
25:29 - create a reference to the button itself
25:31 - so that we can make it non-interactable
25:33 - so let's have a button here and we'll
25:36 - just call this upgrade
25:38 - button and all we need to do is go down
25:40 - here and say button no upgrade button
25:45 - upgrade button there we go do
25:47 - interactable equals false or true in
25:51 - this case and false in the other
25:54 - case there we go and that will just kind
25:57 - of fade the button out a little bit and
25:59 - make uh remove any hover animations and
26:01 - also make sure that it doesn't call this
26:03 - function down here um in case it's
26:05 - already upgraded so now let's try
26:08 - actually doing that so let's try and
26:09 - going in here and uh dragging in our
26:13 - upgrade button and that should be it are
26:16 - you ready I'm ready let's try it let's
26:19 - hit uh maximize and if my system doesn't
26:23 - freeze here there we go wow nerves I
26:27 - have haven't saved there we go it'sit
26:29 - maximize let's hit play and let's try
26:33 - this out so let's create three turrets
26:36 - let's select one of them let's hit
26:38 - upgrade it upgrades we can select it
26:40 - again it says upgrade done you can see
26:42 - it's a bit faded out and we can't click
26:43 - it we can still click the sell but we
26:45 - can click the upgrade and it changes for
26:48 - the other one so you can see now that we
26:50 - have a really really nice upgrade system
26:53 - in here U and that makes it very clear
26:56 - on what's going on how it how much it's
26:58 - going to cost and allows you to change a
27:01 - bunch of different parameters from uh
27:03 - Graphics to um effects to uh damage
27:08 - range and all that kind of stuff on the
27:11 - different turrets so I hope you enjoyed
27:13 - this video I'm looking forward to
27:14 - implementing the next turrets along with
27:16 - some selling of stuff in the next one so
27:19 - I guess there's only one thing left to
27:20 - say which is upgrade complete and I will
27:23 - see you in the next video thanks to all
