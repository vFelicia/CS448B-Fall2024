00:00 - in this video we'll have a look at the
00:01 - basics of modeling and blender will be
00:02 - making this low poly barrel but you
00:04 - should be able to take the same
00:05 - techniques and apply them to a variety
00:07 - of different objects let's get into it
00:08 - so for now we're not going to be needing
00:10 - either our light or our cubes let's go
00:12 - ahead and remove those
00:13 - we can then add in a new cylinder and
00:15 - when we first add objects into a scene
00:17 - we have a few possibilities down here
00:19 - what I want to do is go ahead and change
00:21 - our vertice count to 16 this gives more
00:23 - of that low poly look and let's hit 5 to
00:26 - go into out of graphic mode now so far
00:28 - we've only been dealing with objects in
00:29 - object mode object mode is used to
00:32 - control properties for an entire object
00:34 - and to switch between objects however
00:36 - most of modeling is actually done inside
00:38 - of edit mode you can change between
00:40 - object mode and edit mode down here or
00:42 - you can toggle between them by using tab
00:44 - as you can see when we enter edit mode
00:46 - the mesh meaning the geometry of our
00:48 - object becomes visible our object is
00:50 - made up of vertices which are these
00:53 - points edges which is the lines between
00:55 - points and faces which is everything in
00:58 - between you can switch between selecting
01:00 - vertices edges and faces down here so if
01:03 - we go back to viewing everything from
01:05 - the front and we click on vertex select
01:07 - we can always deselect whatever
01:08 - recurring you have selected by hitting a
01:10 - and if you have nothing selected it's
01:11 - going to select everything so in our
01:13 - case here we want to go ahead and scale
01:15 - it up on the set axis so we'll hit s and
01:17 - then Li and drag it up a bit I want to
01:19 - make it so that our barrel is a bit
01:21 - wider at the center than at the top and
01:23 - bottom but we don't currently have any
01:25 - vertices that we can change here in
01:27 - other words we need to add more geometry
01:28 - to our mesh luckily you can easily
01:30 - subdivide our mesh further by hitting
01:32 - ctrl R and if we then use the scroll
01:35 - wheel we can choose how many
01:36 - subdivisions we want in our case that's
01:38 - just add 2 you can also just go ahead
01:41 - and press the 2 key if we then
01:42 - left-click we're able to slide these
01:44 - loops up and down on our model if you
01:46 - just want them to be on the center we
01:47 - right click so now we've added some
01:49 - extra geometry and we can go ahead and
01:51 - scale this up using the S key let's just
01:53 - scale it up a tiny bit let's then hit a
01:55 - to deselect and our barrel now looks
01:58 - much more like a barrel we can always go
01:59 - and adjust the shape of these loops
02:01 - afterwards to do that we could press the
02:03 - B key in order to back select and select
02:05 - all of these vertices
02:07 - however here is a common pitfall because
02:09 - if I now go ahead and rotate our view
02:11 - you can see that we've
02:12 - I only selected the visible vertices and
02:14 - not those on the other side that means
02:16 - if we were to go ahead and scale this we
02:18 - would get a really weird shape to get
02:20 - around this we go back to the front view
02:22 - and we change to wireframe we can
02:24 - actually toggle between solid and
02:26 - wireframe by hitting Z now if we were to
02:28 - select these edges again you can see
02:31 - that it selects all the way through to
02:33 - both sides and so we can select all of
02:35 - them and scale them up more if we wanted
02:37 - to next up I want to make the top and
02:39 - bottom of our barrel but specifically I
02:41 - want to extrude the top a bit inwards if
02:43 - we want to select all of the vertices
02:45 - along the top here we could shift into
02:47 - side view hit Z hit B and then select
02:49 - all of them and that definitely works
02:51 - but I find that an easier way is simply
02:53 - holding down alt and right clicking this
02:55 - way blender will automatically detect
02:57 - the loop and select all the vertices in
03:00 - it now you might think here that all we
03:01 - need to do is scale it inwards but you
03:03 - can see that doesn't give us the effect
03:05 - that we want instead we want to use
03:06 - extrude to extrude we hit the e key and
03:10 - now we've added some extra geometry at
03:12 - our endpoint here that we can then go
03:14 - and extrude out but we don't want this
03:16 - to exterior doubt we want this to
03:17 - extrude inwards so what we do is right
03:20 - click this doesn't cancel the extrude
03:22 - it's still there if we try and move it
03:23 - it just places it on top of the original
03:26 - face and if we now hit the S key and
03:28 - scale it in we can see that loop
03:30 - appearing if we then hit the e key once
03:32 - more and this time only extrude along
03:35 - the z-axis and then drag it down we get
03:38 - that barrel lurking lid of course we've
03:40 - currently only done this on the top and
03:43 - not on the bottom we could go down here
03:45 - and do it on the bottom as well if you
03:47 - want it to be totally symmetrical we
03:49 - could do them both at the same time or
03:51 - we could use mirroring now this is a
03:53 - pretty cool feature if we snap to the
03:54 - front view going to wireframe hit ctrl R
03:57 - to add a subdivision loop we only want
03:59 - to add a single one so let's left-click
04:00 - and let's right-click to add it in the
04:02 - center we then deselect it B to bug
04:05 - select the bottom ones X to remove them
04:07 - and we want to remove all of the
04:08 - vertices what we can now do is switch
04:11 - into object mode go over here to the
04:13 - modifiers panel hit add modifier and you
04:16 - can do all sorts of things to generate
04:18 - extra geometry or modify our model in a
04:20 - bunch of ways we'll select the mirror
04:22 - modifier and we want to mirrored a
04:25 - along the axis and will allow now any
04:27 - change that we make to our model in edit
04:30 - mode will be reflected on the other side
04:32 - and when you're satisfied with your
04:33 - model just go ahead and exit out of edit
04:35 - mode and hit apply now I also want to
04:37 - make some metallic rings to go around
04:39 - our barrel to do that that's it shift a
04:41 - to create a new mesh let's also make
04:43 - this a cylinder that's it these that we
04:45 - can see it in wireframe mode that's it
04:46 - tap to go into edit mode that scale this
04:48 - up so that it's just a tad bigger than
04:50 - our barrel and let's scale it down on
04:52 - the z axis
04:53 - to make it thinner we can then go ahead
04:55 - and grab this and move it up to the top
04:57 - of our barrel then we can duplicate it
04:59 - and move it down on the z axis to the
05:02 - bottom of our barrel now if we go back
05:03 - to object mode and to solid view we can
05:06 - see that we have two rings around our
05:08 - barrel now we created these in object
05:10 - mode and that means that they're
05:11 - currently subject objects from our
05:13 - barrel now this may be something that
05:15 - you want if you only want some barrels
05:17 - to have these then it's a good thing
05:18 - there is separate object by now case
05:20 - they're pretty integral part of our
05:21 - model and so it makes sense to combine
05:23 - them to do that we first click on the
05:24 - Rings hold down shift and click on the
05:27 - barrel and to join them we hit ctrl J as
05:29 - you can see in our outliner they are now
05:31 - just one object and we'll also go ahead
05:33 - and rename this object to barrel finally
05:36 - let's go under your material hit new and
05:39 - let's add a brown material to this
05:41 - something like that this is going to be
05:43 - of wood material we of course want our
05:45 - metal rings to be offer a separate
05:47 - material so what we'll do is go into
05:49 - edit mode let's select our two rings by
05:51 - holding down alt and shift to select all
05:54 - of the edge loops then going up here and
05:56 - adding a new material let's hit new and
05:58 - to assign this material to these
06:00 - vertices we hit the assign button
06:02 - now out of edit mode and we can choose a
06:04 - color for these metal pans and there we
06:07 - go we can switch back into perspective
06:08 - mode and have a look at our first barrel
06:10 - model and for good measures sake let's
06:12 - just rename this material to rings so
06:15 - congratulations let's say my files are
06:17 - going to file save as or hitting ctrl s
06:19 - I'm just going to call mine barrel and
06:21 - hit save as bender file that's pretty
06:22 - much it for this video if you enjoyed it
