00:00 - I think it's pretty common among game
00:01 - developers to be fond of particle
00:03 - effects and I am personally no exception
00:06 - that's just something inherently
00:07 - satisfying about watching these tiny
00:09 - particles float around the screen
00:11 - especially when you start to increase
00:13 - the number of particles and so it
00:15 - doesn't take long before you start to
00:16 - wonder how many particles can I actually
00:18 - get so let's put it to the test
00:21 - but before we get testing this video is
00:23 - sponsored by Jason Wyman he's the
00:25 - creator of the amazing unity 3d master
00:27 - class which takes you all the way from
00:29 - the very fundamentals of game dev to
00:31 - using unity on a professional level it
00:33 - will teach you the principles of solid
00:34 - code architecture and how to build a
00:36 - variety of game types he even offers an
00:39 - amazing the eye course that will teach
00:41 - you how to make your very own VR game
00:43 - throughout these courses you will get
00:44 - familiar with packages like cinema Sheen
00:46 - timeline and Pro builder but what's
00:48 - really awesome about these courses is
00:50 - that all students get one-on-one help
00:52 - from Jason himself throughout the course
00:54 - and you even get to customize share and
00:56 - showcase your work with other students
00:58 - sign up now and the first 50 people will
01:00 - get a free t-shirt from our merchandise
01:02 - shop line of code as well as a big
01:04 - discount and other bonuses on both
01:06 - courses simply click the link in the
01:08 - description and get started but we
01:10 - aren't completely done yet because right
01:11 - now we are launching a completely new
01:14 - limited edition design created by our
01:16 - own in-house artist Thea that will only
01:18 - be available for a week so if you're
01:21 - getting ready for your next crunch
01:22 - session at work or at home make sure to
01:24 - grab it while you can so unity will you
01:28 - blend at I mean break anyways I started
01:31 - by setting up a quick testing using
01:33 - lightweight and downloaded graph II
01:35 - which is a really solid asset store
01:37 - plugin for measuring performance I also
01:39 - made sure to turn off vsync to avoid my
01:41 - framerate getting capped at 60 and with
01:43 - that it was particle time
01:47 - so I started with shuriken unities
01:50 - cpu-based particle system and as I
01:52 - expected it handled 10,000 particles
01:54 - without breaking a sweat
01:55 - of course all these tests are going to
01:57 - depend on the hardware you're running my
01:59 - build is on the screen now
02:01 - next up I tried with 20,000 then 40,000
02:05 - still the average FPS was above 200 now
02:08 - just to clarify the particle system here
02:10 - is using the standard billboard
02:12 - rendering settings with no forces
02:13 - applied other than a start speed I also
02:15 - noticed that I was getting a huge
02:17 - performance increase when playing the
02:19 - simulation with the game view maximized
02:21 - probably because unity is removing a lot
02:23 - of engine overhead in this case so I
02:25 - continue doing this throughout testing
02:27 - next I doubled the number to 80,000 then
02:30 - 200,000 at this point the simulation was
02:33 - finally starting to slow down and at
02:36 - 400,000 my FPS had dropped to 25 so I
02:39 - decided that 400,000 particles might be
02:41 - enough so that's pretty much it for this
02:43 - week oh you want more well so did I so
02:47 - after putting together a quick graph to
02:49 - show the decrease in fps based on
02:51 - particle count I was ready for round 2
02:53 - the visual effect graph or you need is
02:56 - GPU based particle system first I
02:58 - installed the package and set up a quick
03:00 - graph based on the default swarm
03:01 - template as you can see here it uses
03:04 - simple quad rendering and the particles
03:05 - are moving using a vector field force
03:08 - block so here is 400 thousand particles
03:10 - running using the effects graph no
03:12 - problem the same thing can be set for 1
03:15 - million and two million and 5 million
03:19 - all-hail modeling graphics cards in fact
03:22 - the biggest problem was to get my screen
03:23 - recorded to capture all the detail
03:25 - without slowing down the computer too
03:27 - much at 10 million particles my
03:29 - framerate finally dipped below 25 at
03:31 - first I thought we have reached the end
03:33 - 10 million is the highest we'll get but
03:36 - then again maybe we could do something
03:37 - to optimize it so I started by
03:40 - simplifying the movement of the
03:41 - particles I tried making them completely
03:43 - static and just spawning them randomly
03:45 - within a sphere however to my surprise
03:47 - this had pretty much zero impact on the
03:49 - FPS at 2 million particles my frame rate
03:52 - increased from 117 to 118 not ideal next
03:57 - are tried spawning all the particles
03:59 - from a point
03:59 - and then applying a spherical velocity
04:01 - again no difference at this point I
04:04 - concluded that movement wasn't the thing
04:06 - slowing everything down so instead I
04:07 - moved on to rendering here mr. round
04:09 - with a bunch of settings like soft
04:11 - particles ways of setting color and
04:13 - different blend modes all with no
04:15 - significant change
04:16 - not until I tried making the particles
04:18 - opaque this immediately doubled my frame
04:21 - rate of course rendering opaque sprites
04:24 - at this size just makes everything look
04:26 - like tiny dots so I changed the renderer
04:28 - from quad two-point and all the sudden I
04:31 - could run ten million particles at a
04:33 - hundred and fifty fps this might be the
04:35 - time I've been most excited about
04:37 - optimization like ever
04:39 - of course discerning individual
04:41 - particles from each other is really hard
04:43 - with point rendering currently it just
04:45 - looks like one big black dot so to solve
04:47 - this I added a combination of vector
04:49 - field forces and turbulence and changed
04:51 - their color based on noise I think that
04:53 - definitely looks a lot better and as we
04:55 - discovered earlier these factors don't
04:57 - really impact framerate all that much so
04:59 - I increased the amount of particles yet
05:01 - again to 20 million and then 50 million
05:05 - and here it seemed like we'd squeezed
05:06 - out all the particles my computer could
05:08 - handle I also tried lowering the
05:10 - graphics settings disabling lights as
05:12 - well as post-processing all of which had
05:14 - no impact at all I even tried changing
05:16 - to HD RP which only made it worse
05:18 - finally I had the idea to try and create
05:21 - a build which would allow me to close
05:23 - the unity editor and run the simulation
05:25 - as a standalone with that and all the
05:28 - other performance enhancing settings I
05:29 - could think of I managed to squeeze out
05:32 - 80 million particles at around 20 fps it
05:35 - isn't pretty but I can tu they are
05:38 - they're so feeling pretty satisfied I
05:40 - showed all of this to andreas who slowly
05:42 - turned to me and said well that's all
05:45 - fine and dandy but can you make it rain
05:47 - we shared a telepathic moment I slightly
05:50 - raised my eyebrows and with a smug smile
05:52 - I replied yes yes I can and that's
05:55 - pretty much it for this video if you
05:57 - enjoyed it make sure to subscribe and
05:59 - ring that notification bell so you don't
