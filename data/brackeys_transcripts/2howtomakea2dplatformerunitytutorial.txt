00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello
00:04 - everyone and welcome to the second
00:06 - tutorial in the 2d platformer course
00:09 - today we're going to be taking a look at
00:11 - turning this relatively boring scene
00:14 - into something much more exciting like
00:17 - this keep in mind that the player is
00:20 - still placeholder art and that the
00:22 - platforms here are not so pretty so I'm
00:25 - probably going to change those but I
00:27 - really wanted to play them out with this
00:29 - a surrealistic kind of pixel odd-odd
00:32 - style I would like to do a lot of
00:35 - particle effects in this tutorial and
00:37 - look at some explosions or something to
00:40 - pimp things up so it doesn't get too
00:42 - boring but something with with lots of
00:45 - colors and and yeah you get the idea
00:48 - cool so that's what we are going to be
00:49 - doing today before we go ahead and get
00:51 - started with this I just quickly want to
00:53 - say that I am finally because you guys
00:56 - have requested it so much opened up a
00:59 - practice apparel store so if you go to
01:02 - brakus that Spreadshirt dotnet you will
01:06 - be able to buy different kinds of
01:08 - t-shirts with the logo also a mark if
01:11 - that's what you want and also I have
01:14 - made some cool designs like this one the
01:18 - right code one and as requested the I am
01:21 - a developer design so I might be a tad
01:24 - some more if if things goes well so
01:27 - please go ahead and check this out and
01:30 - yeah cool so that aside let's get this
01:34 - tutorial started so first off I'm going
01:37 - to open up the 2d assets pack and this
01:39 - is something you can download from
01:41 - brackish comm if you go to projects and
01:44 - then the 2d platformer course there will
01:48 - be a download button here where you can
01:50 - download the assets there of course
01:52 - completely free and once we open this up
01:55 - we get a bunch of different folders and
01:57 - this is the same pack used for the pong
02:00 - tutorial course so there's a bunch of
02:03 - different designs in here and you can of
02:05 - course use what you want just check out
02:08 - the readme because a very few amount of
02:10 - these things are licensed
02:14 - so under the 2d platformer we can see
02:17 - that I've made what is called an Tek
02:20 - texture Atlas also called a sprite atlas
02:24 - or a sprite map or a sprite sheet it has
02:29 - many names but it basically just means
02:31 - that you have different sprites or
02:33 - images in one big file so if I open this
02:38 - up in the image editor you can see that
02:40 - I have these four landscape things and
02:43 - then for different platforms in one
02:46 - image and first off it allows because
02:50 - it's it's completely rectangular this is
02:54 - 500 by 12 by 4 512 that means unity will
02:59 - easily compress the colors so it doesn't
03:02 - become as big as a file it will also
03:06 - make sure that it quickly loads up and
03:09 - yeah it will just well minimize the size
03:13 - of your game so it's it's generally good
03:15 - practice also if you're using Photoshop
03:17 - you can just directly import the
03:20 - Photoshop file and you can make changes
03:22 - directly so it's really fun and easy to
03:26 - add new designs then I have just a
03:29 - simple gradient blue background just so
03:31 - we don't get the boring unity blue color
03:34 - cool so I'm going to go ahead and import
03:38 - the Photoshop versions but you can of
03:40 - course follow along with the P and G's
03:42 - so I'll select both Photoshop files drag
03:46 - them into unity here into the project
03:48 - paint and pane and just release and you
03:52 - can see them appearing so first off
03:55 - let's set up the environment sprite
03:57 - atlas because there are a few things we
03:59 - need to change right now when we import
04:01 - this there are multiple things wrong
04:04 - first of which is that it's very small
04:06 - it's also not very pixely it's kind of
04:10 - blurred and everything is in one image
04:13 - so let's change all of this so let's
04:16 - delete this and select it in the project
04:20 - pane and under the texture type we still
04:22 - want this to be sprite but it
04:24 - but we want to change the sprite mode to
04:27 - multiple once we've done this let's
04:30 - change the pixels to units which means
04:32 - how many pixels makes up one unit in
04:35 - unity and we're going to set this to
04:38 - five I find that to be quite okay for
04:42 - the project we're making here then we're
04:45 - going to change the filter mode and this
04:47 - is really important this basically means
04:49 - how unity interprets the pixels and
04:52 - tries to smooth them or whatever does
04:56 - and we want this to be point meaning
04:59 - that there will be no smoothing
05:01 - whatsoever and that's important in pixel
05:04 - art because we want the edges to be very
05:06 - sharp then the max size we could set
05:11 - this to 512 by 512 but it's it's already
05:14 - there so why change it and then we can
05:16 - simply leave this at compressed if you
05:19 - want to go ultra small you can do 16
05:22 - bits but then some of your colors might
05:24 - not be perfect so let's just do
05:27 - compressed that's going to work fine for
05:29 - us then now let's hit apply and let's
05:32 - open up the sprite editor which is
05:34 - something I haven't shown you before so
05:36 - click sprite editor and it will open up
05:41 - a window here it's usually very small
05:44 - but you can just go ahead and maximize
05:46 - it and this is pretty cool because unity
05:50 - has what is called automatic sprite
05:52 - slicing and that basically means that
05:55 - instead of having to drag a rectangle
05:58 - rectangle around every sprite we've made
06:01 - consider we have maybe a hundred sprites
06:03 - if we're doing character animations or
06:06 - something like that that can get really
06:08 - annoying and it's very prone to errors
06:11 - so instead unity has made a cool
06:13 - automatic sprite slicing system for us
06:15 - and all we need to do in order to to
06:19 - utilize this is go to the left hand
06:21 - corner it says slice click there select
06:26 - the type automatic because we haven't
06:28 - set this up in a grid like fashion the
06:32 - minimum size I think that's fine at 4
06:34 - and the pivot we're just going to use
06:37 - Center by D
06:38 - fold these all default settings and you
06:40 - can change them individually after and
06:43 - then the method we're going to do delete
06:45 - existing so now hit slice and you can
06:49 - see that some rectangles appear around
06:52 - our platforms and around each of these
06:56 - elements here might be hard to see on
07:00 - camera but I promise you that once we
07:02 - select them here you can see that
07:03 - they're working actually this one is not
07:06 - so that's perfect because that means we
07:08 - get to go in and fix their error here so
07:11 - right now it interprets these two
07:14 - elements as being one sprite so what we
07:17 - can do to change this is we can simply
07:19 - take the first one here select it and
07:22 - just drag it up so that's going to be
07:24 - our first right that's going to be our
07:26 - tops right and just make sure that this
07:28 - is snapped correctly and and now it is
07:31 - you can also down here change the
07:36 - parameters to whatever you like actually
07:40 - we could go ahead and name these in a
07:42 - sec which I think they're going to do
07:44 - but if you want some some true position
07:47 - your precision on on your scaling you
07:50 - can you can just type in the numbers
07:52 - down here but now we want to add another
07:56 - sprite because right now the blue run
07:58 - here doesn't have a sprite assigned so
08:01 - what you do is you hold down control and
08:03 - you can see and then click and drag and
08:05 - you can see this green red rectangle
08:08 - appearing whoops that was only to show
08:12 - you I'm just going to delete this again
08:15 - by hitting delete so what we're going to
08:17 - do is we're going to hold down control
08:18 - and we're going to drag from up here all
08:21 - the way over here and of course if
08:24 - you've made mistakes you can still
08:25 - resize this to suit your needs and once
08:30 - we've done this we can go ahead and name
08:33 - this so let's start from the top here
08:35 - and call this background mountains
08:45 - let's do purple
08:51 - let's call this background mountains
09:01 - orange this one you guessed it it's
09:05 - going to be background mountains blue
09:11 - and the last one here we are just going
09:14 - to called ground maybe just for ground
09:18 - ground I'm just going to do ground even
09:22 - though we're not going to stand on it it
09:23 - it is just ground actually let's do for
09:28 - ground to it that just makes more sense
09:33 - and then the four platforms we're going
09:36 - to do platform one this is always really
09:42 - tedious but if you don't do it you will
09:44 - wish you had so let's do a platform to
09:50 - platform three and platform for awesome
10:00 - so I probably miss build half of these
10:03 - but which is can say okay so up in the
10:06 - right hand corner let's select apply
10:08 - awesome now we can close down the sprite
10:11 - editor and now when we open up our
10:15 - environment add less here we can see
10:19 - that we have all of the different
10:20 - sprites which we can select individually
10:23 - so this is really awesome
10:25 - if you just drag in the whole Atlas it
10:27 - will just select the first one but we
10:30 - are going to just get rid of this for
10:32 - now and let's just go up to file save
10:36 - scene and save project so to make sure
10:40 - that everything is working awesome so
10:44 - let me just check the time here so we
10:48 - yeah we have plenty of time left cool
10:51 - so what we're going to do now is first
10:53 - off I'm going to just select the camera
10:55 - here and I'm going to assume this out a
10:57 - bit because I think it's just a bit too
10:59 - focused on the the player here and want
11:02 - this to be kind of
11:03 - just paste and action like and that's
11:05 - not really nice when you almost can't
11:07 - see anything but the player so let's
11:09 - change the size here if we're still
11:12 - going to leave it in Auto graphic but we
11:14 - can assume out by pumping up the size so
11:17 - let's do something like maybe 15 it's a
11:22 - little extreme but I think it's going to
11:23 - work nicely for the game so we're just
11:27 - going to leave this for now and we can
11:28 - always go ahead and change it and the
11:30 - reason why we're leaving it in
11:31 - orthographic is we could change it put
11:34 - to perspective which would be easy when
11:37 - we are going to do parallaxing but it
11:39 - doesn't give us much control as to where
11:41 - elements are placed in the scene so I'm
11:44 - going to leave it on orthographic and if
11:46 - you don't know the difference between
11:48 - the two please just ignore what I said
11:50 - it's it's not going to be important for
11:52 - this course cool wow I'm doing a lot of
11:56 - talking today now let's let's do some
11:59 - action so first off let's delete the
12:01 - grounds it doesn't look pretty
12:03 - then let's drag in one of these
12:05 - platforms for our character to have
12:08 - something to stand out let's just do
12:10 - platform one so drag it in here let's
12:13 - move it down so let's Center it on the X
12:16 - and let's just do negative five let's do
12:21 - negative five point five on G the Y and
12:27 - let's go ahead and add a box Collider to
12:30 - this so hit add component physics to D
12:33 - and then box Collider 2d and it should
12:38 - automatically set things up and the
12:40 - reason why we're just adding a box
12:42 - Collider is we are probably never going
12:44 - to collide with the root here if you are
12:46 - making a game where you could collide
12:49 - with with the pillar itself then I would
12:52 - recommend going add component physics 2d
12:54 - and then polygon Collider where you can
12:57 - more accurately change the collision but
13:00 - for now we're going to stick with the
13:02 - box Collider 2d awesome so that was the
13:06 - first platform let's drag some more in
13:08 - here let's do platform 2
13:11 - same procedure so let's do 0 X and then
13:16 - five point five to make sure that these
13:20 - are positioned exactly the same here and
13:24 - we can drag them to make sure that they
13:30 - are lined on the x-axis too by the way
13:36 - when dragging and holding down shift you
13:38 - will constrain the dragging to one axis
13:40 - so right now I'm not holding down shift
13:43 - and right now our I am that's just a
13:45 - nifty little trick so cool there that
13:52 - looks nice and that's did we yeah let's
13:57 - add a box Collider to this also so add
13:59 - component for six 2d box Collider 2d
14:02 - let's go ahead and just add the last
14:05 - platform's also so let's do platform
14:07 - three and of course this is something
14:10 - you can position as you want you can use
14:12 - them however you like I just wanted to
14:14 - provide some basic assets though this
14:16 - one is not the one I'm the most proud of
14:18 - I must say they will do the job so let's
14:22 - drag it in here and just position it so
14:25 - it it works it's fine a little bit of an
14:30 - overlap is better than a bit of a gap
14:33 - because that leaves just ugly ugly
14:37 - anti-aliasing and such and then the last
14:40 - platform for actually that's a de box
14:42 - Collider to that one also there and the
14:45 - particle added to platform for while we
14:47 - are added yeah and let's position this
14:51 - at zero negative five point five and
14:54 - let's just drag it out to the right zoom
14:59 - in here we can get this right and
15:03 - there's going to be just fine for now
15:05 - cause now we have four platforms for our
15:08 - characters stand on them now when we
15:10 - play the game you can see that he is
15:12 - indeed standing on these you will autos
15:15 - also notice that they are currently
15:16 - floating you can get rid of this by
15:19 - moving up the camera you could do that
15:22 - by parenting setting the target of the
15:24 - camera to a empty game object on the
15:28 - player that is higher
15:29 - than the player himself so maybe with a
15:32 - y-value of like plus three and and that
15:36 - way we will make sure that the camera is
15:38 - also always raised a little higher than
15:40 - the exact center but that's not
15:42 - something we're going to do instead
15:44 - we're going to conceal this by having a
15:46 - foreground element in front of this as
15:49 - you can see on the picture here so
15:51 - that's going to work just fine
15:53 - goal so let's continue and now let's add
15:58 - some blue background here so let's drag
16:01 - in the blue background image actually
16:04 - all of the settings here we can pretty
16:06 - much just leave as is that they're going
16:09 - to work just fine so let's drag this
16:12 - under the main camera and let's see how
16:16 - this is position so let's make it sure
16:19 - it's n 0 0 0 let's also make sure that
16:22 - the scale is 10 and 10 actually let's do
16:30 - maybe 12 on the X just to make sure that
16:34 - we're not getting any weird clipping but
16:39 - we right now we're not seeing anything
16:41 - and that's because it's directly on top
16:43 - of the camera so let's just move this
16:45 - back a bed actually let's just move it
16:48 - completely out of the way into the
16:50 - distance here and then go back into 2d
16:53 - view and what we can do is we can lock
16:55 - this layer meaning that we will not be
16:58 - constantly selecting it because that can
17:01 - really be a pain so let's just lock this
17:04 - by going up here to layer let's hit add
17:08 - layer and make a background layer here
17:10 - so let's do background then select the
17:15 - object again and select the background
17:16 - layer and then up here under layers you
17:20 - can see that we have a layer called
17:23 - background you can lock that or you can
17:27 - just lock the sorting layer but I'm
17:29 - going to lock the background layer up
17:31 - here so just click the lock and now when
17:33 - we deselected we're not going to be able
17:35 - to select it so we can do stuff like box
17:38 - dragging and and all of that awesome
17:40 - stuff so we can really focus on making
17:42 - the
17:42 - fun instead of yeah you know selecting
17:45 - the background and all that kind of
17:48 - stuff being really annoying awesome so
17:51 - now when we hit play we can see that the
17:54 - background will follow us around and
17:56 - this is going to be just fine because I
17:58 - mean it's it's just a similar gradient
17:59 - you will notice that we have a bird of
18:04 - clipping here where the the sprite ends
18:10 - so let's just make sure to widen it a
18:13 - bit further maybe 2:15 that's pretty
18:17 - close to right screen ratio and and yet
18:21 - it's just much better so just go a bit
18:24 - of overboard with that and and it's not
18:26 - going to disturb you cool
18:29 - so now let's drag some more elements
18:31 - into the scene let's do a I'm actually
18:35 - let's do a foreground now let's do the
18:38 - foreground element here the foreground
18:40 - dirt let's drag this in and this is not
18:43 - going to need a Collider but let's
18:45 - Center it on the X and let's just drag
18:48 - it down on the Y here until it fits and
18:51 - one thing you probably want to do is you
18:54 - want to sort these things in sorting
18:56 - layers so let's select all the platforms
18:57 - and actually I just want them to be on
19:02 - the default layer but I can see that the
19:04 - default layer is beneath everything else
19:06 - so let's go ahead and edit the sorting
19:09 - layers and we can do this by just
19:10 - hitting add sorting layer it will bring
19:12 - up the sorting layers and let's just
19:15 - drag the default here above the
19:17 - background but under the player because
19:19 - we pretty much always want the player to
19:21 - be on top so yeah let's just arrange it
19:25 - like that so now everything by default
19:27 - will be above the background but beneath
19:29 - the player in the foreground and that's
19:31 - awesome so all of the platforms here we
19:34 - can just leave them at default but our
19:36 - foreground third let's make sure to
19:39 - select foreground for that so when we
19:41 - plug it and drag it over our player you
19:43 - can see that he will be hidden behind
19:49 - awesome
19:50 - maybe we should drag this down I didn't
19:53 - know let's see how this looks in the
19:55 - game view
19:56 - this looks pretty interesting on not too
20:00 - shabby maybe drag it down just a bit
20:03 - like this
20:05 - yeah that's pretty nice I really want to
20:07 - leave some room for just the deep blue
20:11 - sky and maybe even some clouds in the
20:14 - future but that's something we're going
20:16 - to mess around with awesome so now let's
20:19 - do some background mountains please do
20:24 - remember that right now when we are
20:25 - playing you will notice that the
20:27 - foreground and the platforms scroll at
20:31 - the exact same speed this is because we
20:33 - haven't implemented what is called
20:35 - parallaxing which is probably what we're
20:38 - going to do in the next tutorial I found
20:41 - a really cool way to do parallaxing
20:43 - without using a perspective camera
20:46 - simply by scripting in some position and
20:49 - it's gonna be really fun it's it really
20:54 - adds depth to the scene so that's for
20:57 - next time cool so let's go ahead and
21:00 - drag in some background elements shall
21:02 - we so let's select the let's do the
21:08 - purple one maybe or yeah that's one this
21:14 - one is going to be more into the
21:15 - distance so let's do the purple one drag
21:18 - it in here oops my phone's going off
21:20 - just a sec I'm gonna pause the video
21:22 - here and be back oh wow okay cool so I'm
21:26 - back I'm sorry about that that was not
21:29 - so professional
21:30 - but what we're going to do now is we're
21:32 - going to change the sorting layer to
21:35 - background and then of course it will be
21:39 - behind our blue background so let's make
21:42 - sure to select a blue background and
21:44 - change that sort layer to also
21:46 - background and then the ordering layer
21:48 - to something like Mound
21:50 - - just a thousand because we are never
21:53 - going to have anything behind the the
21:57 - blue background here so now the
22:00 - background mountains purple let's select
22:03 - this and Center it in the X and let's do
22:08 - a Y of
22:10 - who why'd I know let's see what looks
22:13 - great in game here so strike this down
22:16 - maybe that's actually not too bad with
22:19 - the just barely appearing above yeah
22:23 - else it's gonna cover too much I don't
22:25 - want it like right where the platform's
22:27 - begin because then they're going to be
22:29 - overlapping and it confuses the players
22:31 - so something like this looks pretty nice
22:34 - especially when we get that parallaxing
22:37 - effect this is going to be really
22:38 - awesome so I quite like this maybe just
22:41 - move it up just a tad so we ended up
22:44 - with with about minus seven seven on the
22:48 - Y and that's going to do just fine I've
22:51 - made sure to make both the dirt and the
22:55 - background mountains pretty long so you
22:58 - can go ahead and and just choose the
23:00 - part that fits best
23:02 - of course when again when we implement
23:04 - the parallaxing we do need them to be
23:07 - quite long and we might even need them
23:09 - to do some repeating and some
23:11 - instantiation but that's something we're
23:14 - going to look at so let's not get ahead
23:16 - of ourselves let's first off import
23:19 - another mountain layer so let's do the
23:22 - blue background here I think I'm just
23:25 - going to exclude the other ones here
23:26 - though or the the orange one though it
23:30 - is pretty cool no I'm gonna exclude it
23:33 - for now so let's try the blue background
23:35 - drag that in here and as you can see
23:38 - I've added a bit of a blur to this you
23:41 - might like you might not like I think
23:43 - it's okay because and that makes it just
23:48 - easier for the eye to focus on the
23:50 - foreground so I thought it was a little
23:52 - necessary so let's again put this in the
23:55 - background and let's do the Odin layer
23:57 - minus 1 so it will be behind our purple
24:02 - mountains and for this we can just maybe
24:05 - offset it a bit in some direction we
24:08 - could also invert the scale on the X so
24:13 - let's do minus 1 on the X and that will
24:16 - maybe hide the effect a bit and then at
24:18 - the same time offset it so now as you
24:20 - can see
24:22 - we'll be em it's not so apparent that
24:24 - it's basically the same layer of course
24:27 - you can go ahead and change this in
24:28 - Photoshop and move around pics and stuff
24:30 - to hide this I'm not going to go so
24:32 - in-depth because this is again just a
24:35 - tutorial but feel free to play around
24:38 - with anything and alter it the way you
24:40 - like it to so let's just move this down
24:43 - just a bit and I think we have something
24:45 - that looks pretty nice here I mean we
24:48 - have plenty of room for gameplay
24:50 - elements both going up or down and yeah
24:54 - so you can of course play around with
24:56 - these platforms and right now if we fall
24:59 - we will fall beneath behind the the
25:02 - foreground here so maybe we can make
25:05 - some some dying mechanics if you fall
25:07 - from a platform they don't need to be so
25:11 - close as I've made as close as I've made
25:14 - them here you can of course drag them
25:17 - out and make some some actual
25:20 - platforming instead of just walking on
25:22 - on one surface so that is actually
25:25 - something I'm going to do right now so
25:27 - I'm just going to move these up here
25:30 - just so we have a tiny tiny game to play
25:32 - um they're awesome
25:36 - so that was it for this tutorial what
25:39 - was this okay so this was a long one Wow
25:43 - time flies when you're doing graphics
25:45 - you can really get caught up in it but
25:47 - yeah so thanks for watching and I'll see
25:50 - you in the next video
