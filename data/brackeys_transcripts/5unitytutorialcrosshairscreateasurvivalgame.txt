00:03 - hello and welcome to the fifth episode
00:06 - of our survival gam series um done by
00:08 - brais I am the CE of brais and today uh
00:12 - is going to be a hopefully pretty quick
00:14 - tutorial cuz I'm in a hurry as always
00:17 - and it's going to be about how to
00:19 - implement crosshairs so that the player
00:22 - knows exactly where the center of his
00:24 - screen is um so let's go ahead and get
00:26 - started maybe even some materials and
00:28 - colors I don't know let's see how much
00:31 - time we have um okay so I've opened up
00:36 - Unity again again and then um yes so
00:40 - I've open up unity and we can just go
00:42 - ahead and drag the animation clips that
00:44 - we created in the last tutorial under
00:47 - our animations and um so save this
00:53 - and we can uh go ahead and create the um
00:59 - the cursor the Crosser so um what we
01:02 - need to do is we need to open up some
01:05 - kind of um photo editing program some
01:09 - kind of Graphics program um this could
01:12 - be that's a pretty cool um free
01:16 - alternative to photoshop that uh which I
01:19 - will be using um so open something like
01:22 - that up um if you don't know how to do
01:25 - this this will be pretty simple but then
01:28 - you can just find something online undo
01:30 - what's called um I think it's pixel art
01:34 - or something like that um which um
01:37 - you'll need some kind of image that does
01:39 - not have a white background else it will
01:42 - look weird so um okay so create a new
01:47 - new document and we can just call it
01:50 - this cursor and um it's going to be
01:55 - about 16 by 16 pixels but you can scale
01:58 - it down um um and it's just a really
02:02 - small square and um I'm going to double
02:07 - click on the background and call this BG
02:10 - and then just turn this layer off and uh
02:13 - then I'm going to create a simple round
02:16 - shape um it's nothing fancy and I'm not
02:19 - going to teach you anything in Photoshop
02:22 - it's just um really basic so and this
02:27 - this is going to be white you can make
02:30 - it whatever you want and I'm going to
02:33 - click and drag in the center holding
02:34 - down alt and
02:36 - shift and yes that looks about right and
02:41 - we can go ahead and take the opacity
02:43 - down to about um 70 and then we can go
02:47 - ahead and save else and then navigate to
02:51 - your Unity project so um minus undo my
02:56 - Dropbox um undo the D drive Ono the
02:59 - Dropbox Brack Keys No wait um survival I
03:03 - think it's called there it is and then
03:06 - assets and then here you can just save
03:10 - as a Photoshop file um because Unity
03:12 - recognizes this um else you can go ahead
03:16 - and save it as a PNG or a jpack
03:19 - everything will work also I think they
03:21 - use Tiff but I'm not entirely sure GIF
03:25 - is probably not allowed but you can try
03:28 - it out okay so um hit save and all right
03:33 - and then we can go back to Unity and
03:34 - that's the photo editing part of this
03:37 - tutorial now we can go ahead and create
03:40 - uh a new kind of game object so go to
03:42 - game object create other and then hit
03:45 - the gy texture bum bum bum and uh one
03:51 - very important part of the goey texture
03:53 - is that it always needs to you know need
03:57 - to know where it is at so um by default
04:01 - it's at the 0.5 0.5 and z and the set
04:07 - won't change everything uh anything I'm
04:10 - sorry uh the the Z won't uh change
04:14 - anything at all because this is all
04:16 - relative to your camera so if I go ahead
04:19 - and hit play this is always stuck on
04:23 - your camera this is a 2d element and it
04:26 - won't change you can it's not acting in
04:28 - the 3D space
04:30 - um so you can just go ahead and leave
04:33 - that at zero and if you want this type
04:36 - of graphic to be
04:38 - anchored uh in the corner then you can
04:41 - go ahead and type z0 and in will and it
04:44 - will be anchored in the left corner but
04:47 - this we want to be anchored in the
04:48 - center so um and what do you use to
04:53 - adjust it you use what is called pixel
04:57 - inset because um there are many forms of
05:01 - um guy um guy means graphical user
05:04 - interface and um there are many ways to
05:07 - do it but basically pixel
05:10 - inset is how far
05:13 - away this is from the Cent but it could
05:17 - be from the center it could be from the
05:19 - uh left side right side it could be from
05:22 - the corners in pixels the element should
05:26 - be so how far away from some point the
05:30 - um the the guey should be in pixels and
05:33 - this way it will always be the exact
05:36 - same distance um from some place no
05:39 - matter your screen resolution so this is
05:43 - what you'll need to be adjusting it else
05:45 - it will change when you maximize and
05:48 - minimize so um but for now we are going
05:52 - to uh change the texture first of all so
05:54 - you can go ahead and drag the cursor
05:57 - element uh in here and I don't know why
06:01 - I have named this cursor this should be
06:03 - cross her I'm a little out of my mind
06:07 - today and then you can change the
06:09 - texture to GUI down here in the import
06:13 - settings and this is really important
06:16 - because GUI is much higher image quality
06:19 - than texture this is
06:21 - important remember this gii is um so
06:26 - much better quality and can be um it it
06:30 - can it don't need to be perfectly Square
06:33 - um textures can only be 1,25
06:37 - 5002 um 64 32 16x 16 all this kind of
06:43 - stuff GUI elements can be anything you
06:46 - want so um the back size we'll just
06:49 - change this to 32 not that it will match
06:53 - it and then hit apply and then go into
06:55 - the unity Watermark small which is what
06:58 - our G is named and then you can change
07:02 - the width to 16 and the height to 16 and
07:06 - we can go ahead and zero out the pixel
07:09 - inset now this won't make it perfectly
07:13 - centered um this will make it centered
07:16 - from the corner of the guey element so
07:20 - we should go ahead and uh say um
07:26 - about
07:28 - eight and
07:30 - I think it's eight may might be minus 8
07:34 - I think this should be the sensory um
07:38 - but you can we can do some testing on
07:40 - this later for now we can just leave it
07:41 - at z0 it won't matter that much um so
07:46 - now we have this um element in the
07:50 - center of a screen and we can make this
07:52 - smaller we can make it bigger just
07:54 - adjusting the width and height or going
07:57 - into Photoshop and doing it um so let's
08:00 - rename this
08:03 - to
08:05 - cross
08:06 - hair and um yeah that'll be it um
08:11 - so that's it for this tutorial um I'm
08:15 - sorry that uh it's so quick but I
08:17 - haven't got time for anymore and um I'll
08:21 - see you next time thanks for watching
