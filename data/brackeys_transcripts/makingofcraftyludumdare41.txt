00:00 - so just finished my entry into Ludum
00:01 - dare 41 and it was a huge amount of fun
00:04 - to those of you who don't know um Daria
00:06 - is a massive game dev competition where
00:09 - you have 48 hours to create a game from
00:10 - scratch that means you do all the art
00:12 - code and sound yourself for this dunam
00:15 - diary we all decided to participate so
00:17 - we packed up all like gear and set it up
00:19 - in our friend's apartment we then went
00:31 - home for a good night's sleep and when
00:33 - we woke up the next day the theme had
00:35 - already been announced it was to combine
00:37 - two incompatible genres so naturally we
00:40 - started brainstorming genres on the
00:42 - whiteboard trying to figure out weird
00:44 - ways to combine them I'll be completely
00:46 - honest and say that I thought this was
00:47 - actually a really hard challenge
00:49 - finally I settled on the idea of
00:51 - combining a realism based crafting game
00:54 - with fantasy adventure elements the game
00:57 - feels a lot like a sandbox where you
00:59 - combine different real-life elements to
01:01 - create materials you then combine
01:03 - materials to create tools and use the
01:05 - tools to gather more materials but then
01:07 - out of the blue you stumble upon this
01:09 - weird magical substance and suddenly the
01:12 - game is all about figuring out this
01:14 - magical world and I don't want to spoil
01:16 - it but you do end up fighting bad guys
01:19 - with this idea in mind it was time to
01:21 - boot up unity I started by creating some
01:24 - basic UI elements trying to figure out
01:26 - how the crafting would work I decided to
01:28 - go with the simplest possible solution
01:30 - combine two things get a result i
01:33 - implemented drag and drop to move things
01:35 - around and it was already really eager
01:37 - to start adding some items however I
01:39 - knew that I had to first come up with a
01:41 - quick way to create items and item
01:43 - recipes that would make it easy to edit
01:45 - them later for this I decided to use
01:48 - scriptable objects which later turned
01:50 - out to be a wide choice basically I
01:53 - created two based scriptable objects one
01:55 - for items which contained a name as well
01:58 - as an icon and one for recipes which
02:00 - contained information about which items
02:02 - to combine in order to create a new one
02:05 - using this symbol structure it was
02:07 - pretty quick to get crafting working
02:09 - with the UI I also had in an inventory
02:11 - the keep track of all items the player
02:13 - has
02:13 - as the game progresses and at this point
02:16 - I was ready to start adding items but I
02:18 - still needed to figure out exactly what
02:20 - items I wanted in my game and more
02:22 - importantly which ones combined into
02:25 - what to help visualize this I started
02:27 - creating a graph of all the items that I
02:29 - wanted in the game and I think this is
02:32 - often something that is overlooked when
02:34 - talking about game making planning and
02:36 - visualizing tasks can be extremely
02:38 - useful and I can easily say that without
02:40 - this graph I would have never finished
02:42 - the game in time now finally I could
02:45 - start going through the list and
02:46 - creating icons for each of the items
02:48 - also quickly threw together some sprites
02:50 - to make the UI a bit nicer and once I
02:53 - was happy with it
02:54 - I threw it into the editor and voila I
02:56 - actually had something working I only
02:58 - had around 5 items but still the idea
03:01 - was there from here spend most of the
03:03 - evening creating lots of different icons
03:05 - for items I must say I really enjoyed
03:08 - this part most of the games I make are
03:10 - often really focused on gameplay and
03:12 - because of that I normally use most of
03:14 - my time programming but for this game
03:17 - everything revolved around having enough
03:19 - items to make it feel interesting and
03:21 - plentiful and it was also a great excuse
03:23 - to practice my pixel art skills even
03:25 - though I will admit I found inspiration
03:27 - in a few places
03:29 - well once I had some more items in place
03:31 - it was time to find a good way of
03:33 - introducing magic to the player for this
03:36 - I created a reward manager that would
03:38 - track the amount of items the player
03:39 - heads and give extra rewards such as man
03:42 - tegu once the player has progressed to a
03:44 - certain point and it was at this time
03:46 - that I started having my friends play
03:49 - test the game and man did I learn a lot
03:51 - from doing so I found out that rewarding
03:53 - the player with extra items worked
03:55 - really well and everyone got super
03:57 - excited when they found the magic goo so
03:59 - I started thinking of other rewards to
04:01 - give the player also learned that I
04:03 - definitely needed more items in the game
04:05 - and to avoid people from getting stuck I
04:07 - had to create multiple ways to craft the
04:09 - same items after updating the graph to
04:12 - reflect these thoughts I added some UI
04:14 - to highlight new items when they are
04:16 - discovered I also used this as a way to
04:18 - communicate story to the player and tell
04:21 - a few jokes along the way which ended up
04:23 - being a crucial part of the game and
04:25 - that was pretty much the end of day
04:27 - one next morning I felt pretty well
04:29 - rested and started to slave away at all
04:31 - the new items that I thought up the day
04:33 - before these were really fun to do
04:35 - because a lot of them were more
04:36 - interesting and magical which is great
04:39 - because it took pretty much the entire
04:41 - day
04:41 - I also added an item counter to help the
04:43 - playa keep track of his progress as well
04:46 - as some fancy UI animations to help tie
04:48 - everything together on that I've pretty
04:49 - much been the entire night doing lots
04:51 - and lots of play testing I asked my
04:53 - friends to play the game one by one to
04:55 - find out where they were getting stuck
04:57 - and between each I would go in and add
04:59 - or change items to smooth out the
05:01 - experience with the core game done and
05:03 - only a few hours to go I still wanted to
05:05 - add audio unfortunately at this time
05:08 - unity decided to stop working altogether
05:10 - and I had to reinstall meanwhile I had
05:16 - time to record some sounds and once
05:18 - unity was back up and running I quickly
05:20 - added them all together and created an
05:22 - icon for the game I also realized that I
05:25 - needed a name for the king at this point
05:27 - I felt like I was pretty much running
05:29 - out of good ideas so I went with me
05:30 - fairly unoriginal crafty I guess it
05:33 - works just fine and that was it as
05:36 - always I submitted just before the
05:38 - deadline this is me at 4 a.m. time to
05:41 - catch up on some lost sleep let's pretty
