00:00 - thanks for tuning in at
00:03 - braies hello everyone and welcome to
00:05 - video number six in make a game a short
00:08 - series on making a cool little video
00:11 - game in unity in this one we are going
00:14 - to take a look at quality settings or
00:18 - render settings inside of unity those
00:21 - two are often confused so I'm just going
00:23 - to clear that up and we're going to talk
00:25 - about stuff like
00:26 - aning and uh uh how many lights you can
00:31 - have in your scene and just overall the
00:34 - adjusting the quality of our game so
00:37 - let's dive right into it actually before
00:40 - we do I just have a very short sneak
00:42 - peek into the game I'm developing at the
00:46 - moment called squel and this is just a
00:49 - wallpaper I made for it you haven't seen
00:51 - anything yet and it's not coming soon uh
00:55 - in an alpha version to PC and mac and
00:57 - it's not called SEL so let's continue
00:59 - with the video here so um first off
01:04 - let's open up Unity as always and to get
01:07 - to the quality settings go to edit
01:12 - project
01:13 - settings and go to
01:15 - Quality and uh this is basically how
01:19 - advanced you want the graphics to be for
01:21 - your game and if you're making a a a
01:24 - game that you're serious about you
01:26 - really want the player to be able to
01:28 - select how good of a quality uh the
01:31 - graphics should be so that if they're on
01:33 - a computer who can handle that much uh
01:37 - they can change uh change it up to make
01:40 - it run better on the on the hardware so
01:44 - Unity have made a really really nice
01:46 - system for us to to adjust this and uh
01:51 - they use what is called levels and
01:54 - basically you can add some yourself and
01:56 - call them whatever you want but these
01:58 - are quality levels that you can switch
02:00 - between and you can standardize on
02:03 - different platforms and make available
02:05 - on different platforms so that once you
02:07 - release the game to a lot of platforms
02:09 - the users will be able to choose the
02:13 - quality um and uh let's just take a look
02:17 - at the prefabs they set up by default
02:19 - let's select the fastest one we can see
02:21 - now we don't have any shadows and uh the
02:25 - anti aliasing is completely off no an an
02:29 - isotropic textures and the texture
02:31 - quality is is horrible all of this is
02:33 - just turned off and if we go to
02:35 - Fantastic we can see some much more
02:37 - smooth edges still not that incredible
02:40 - uh we can see some detail shadows and
02:42 - and such so it it changes up the the way
02:47 - uh the graphics are rendered and uh and
02:50 - this is not that visible in our game
02:51 - because we don't have that many Graphics
02:53 - in there but once you start to get more
02:55 - it becomes very visible but basically I
02:58 - think there are way to too many levels
03:00 - for our game so let's
03:02 - delete uh let's delete delad first let's
03:07 - delete
03:09 - simple and let's delete beautiful so we
03:12 - have fast good and we have fantastic and
03:15 - uh let's rename the fastest to let's
03:19 - rename this to um
03:24 - fast uh or low quality let's just say
03:26 - low
03:28 - quality
03:30 - and let's adjust the settings here so
03:32 - basically this is going to run on the uh
03:36 - lowest quality
03:38 - devices and uh pixel light count is how
03:42 - many lights can be shown on one
03:46 - objects and uh this is actually not that
03:49 - taxing on the computer you can easily
03:51 - increase this to at least 10 on um on a
03:56 - a older desktop computer if you're on
04:00 - mobile devices you have to be a lot more
04:03 - careful uh then I would lower it by
04:06 - quite a bit but definitely for computers
04:09 - you can always stay above
04:12 - 10 uh the texture quality let's make
04:15 - that half
04:16 - resolution an uh an an isotropic texture
04:21 - is let's make that per texture an the
04:24 - alas thing let's say that's completely
04:28 - disabled so particles is something that
04:31 - we will just keep off Shadows I think we
04:34 - should enable Shadows since they add
04:36 - quite a lot to the game so let's make
04:38 - hard Shadows
04:40 - only and they should be medium
04:44 - resolution actually let's do low
04:47 - resolution this is really up to you and
04:48 - it depends completely on how much you
04:50 - have in the scene uh because our level
04:52 - is so simple we could easily bump this
04:54 - up but I'm just going to assume that you
04:56 - have made more than what I have here
05:00 - uh so okay so the low resolution stable
05:03 - fit is fine no Cascades and the shadow
05:05 - distance let's increase that to
05:07 - 30 uh and uh that's basically how far
05:11 - away you need or how close you need to
05:13 - be to the subject before the Shadow
05:15 - shows uh the resolution is how uh itchy
05:19 - this shadow looks so if we turn on the
05:21 - light here you can see here there are
05:24 - some jacked edges uh that is removed by
05:27 - increasing the resolution and hard and
05:30 - Sh soft Shadows um that's not something
05:33 - you need to worry about if you have the
05:34 - free version of
05:36 - unity now let's go back into the quality
05:38 - settings here and let's adjust the
05:41 - second layer let's call this medium
05:43 - quality not all these fanc terms and
05:47 - let's increase the light here to 50 and
05:51 - that's way more than you're going to
05:52 - need but that's okay uh we could also do
05:56 - 30 just to make it more realis istic uh
06:00 - the texture quality now we want it to be
06:02 - full resolution we want this to be per
06:04 - texture still anding I think we can
06:07 - easily bump that to at least two um
06:10 - maybe even four uh the Shadows both hard
06:14 - and soft Shadows definitely and medium
06:16 - resolution you could do high uh I'm just
06:19 - going to stick to medium and fantastic
06:22 - that's when we get to bump it up quite a
06:25 - lot so let's make this uh high quality
06:30 - and the pixel light count could be 100
06:34 - uh texture quality full resolution for
06:37 - done analizing bump that up to eight
06:40 - soft particles are fine uh the high
06:44 - resol very high resolution shadows and
06:47 - uh that all looks really great what you
06:50 - can do is add a um make this a little
06:55 - less expensive on the hardware and then
06:57 - make an ultimate quality or fantastic
06:59 - quality uh because there are there is
07:02 - quite a gap between medium and high
07:04 - quality um but it's it's really it
07:08 - doesn't make that great of a difference
07:10 - but whenever we play test you normally
07:12 - want to be in the highest quality so you
07:14 - can get all the detail right and then
07:16 - later play test in low quality uh
07:18 - settings and if you're you're you're lag
07:21 - spiking or something because you both
07:22 - have to run unity and the player uh you
07:25 - can bump it down to something like
07:27 - medium but that was basically it for the
07:30 - quality tab uh I also mened mentioned
07:33 - the render settings and these are often
07:36 - confused you get to them by going to
07:39 - edit render settings and now you can see
07:41 - we have been here before in one of the
07:43 - previous videos we just light the
07:46 - ambient light uh how we liked it and
07:49 - that's done under the r render settings
07:51 - whoops I jumped out there and this is
07:54 - where you can add stuff like you
07:56 - can change a default um Skye boxes
08:00 - default textures of different kinds uh
08:03 - flares and Halo you really don't need to
08:06 - tweak that uh this that much in in an a
08:09 - ordinary game you might add some FK not
08:11 - in in in our game yet at least um and
08:15 - you might add a default Skybox material
08:18 - but really you should just leave this be
08:21 - ambient light though is is very
08:22 - important and and you should definitely
08:24 - have a look at how you want the ambient
08:26 - light to
08:28 - be uh cool and one thing to mention the
08:31 - render settings are scene oriented so if
08:34 - I make a new scene and I want some fog
08:37 - in there I can just turn that on and the
08:40 - old scene will still have it disabled
08:42 - whereas the quality settings are for the
08:45 - whole
08:47 - game uh cool so now let's make some
08:50 - defaults uh on our different levels so
08:53 - let's just assume that we're going to
08:55 - run this as a stand alone that means um
08:59 - that you build it for PC and mac and uh
09:03 - let's set the uh default level here by
09:06 - pressing the arrow beneath the arrow
09:09 - which means Standalone and let's change
09:11 - this to high quality so now that's going
09:13 - to be selected by
09:15 - default and uh let's see the phone here
09:20 - uh that must be an iPhone let's change
09:23 - that to low quality the same with the
09:26 - Android phone let's change that to low
09:28 - the Blackberry definitely low uh Windows
09:32 - store apps that depends on where they're
09:35 - displayed let's say medium uh the
09:38 - wp8 uh the Windows Phone 8 low quality
09:42 - and uh that one that must be the OU Ouya
09:47 - uh don't know that much about its
09:49 - Hardware I'm not I don't think you're
09:51 - going to be publishing to that but uh
09:53 - let's just bump that up to high and then
09:55 - for the web player let's make that
09:57 - Medium quality by
09:59 - default and uh oh they follow along oh
10:03 - they're both web right so let's just
10:05 - make that a medium quality and that was
10:08 - pretty much it for this tutorial I hope
10:10 - you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the
10:12 - next
