00:00 - [Music]
00:04 - hello everyone and welcome to the sixth
00:06 - tutorial in our Survival game series
00:08 - done by brais I am the CEO of brais and
00:11 - today we are going to take a look at
00:13 - importing assets including materials and
00:17 - um and UV data texturing and um models
00:23 - um primarily game weapons um I'm going
00:27 - to be using Maya and import from that um
00:32 - I won't show the process in Maya um but
00:36 - um the Unity part I will show you so um
00:39 - let's open up Unity I've opened up Unity
00:42 - as always and the scene is just like
00:46 - before except for one thing I've made a
00:49 - new folder called Imports so if we go
00:52 - ahead and double click on this you can
00:53 - see that I have imported quite a few
00:56 - things now um primarily we're going to
00:59 - take a look look at this maze what I did
01:02 - was I went into Maya and I created a
01:04 - model and this was just a simple uh
01:08 - sphere from where I extracted some faces
01:13 - and then collapsed the outer point so
01:16 - that they created these spikes and then
01:19 - from the bottom I just extracted out a
01:22 - cylinder and what I later did um is that
01:25 - I UV mapped it meaning that I I told
01:29 - told Meer how it should um put on the
01:34 - texture that I later
01:35 - created um Myer can do this
01:38 - automatically there are also pro
01:41 - programs for it um this UV map in
01:44 - particular is really really bad um but I
01:49 - am not a uh 3D designer so bear with me
01:53 - here and um after that I I did the uh
01:58 - Textures in Photoshop
02:00 - and then I just saved it as a Maya file
02:04 - justrl s just saved it in uh my Unity
02:08 - project you could also save it as an fbx
02:12 - file and uh this is important to
02:14 - remember um my uh sorry Unity loves fbx
02:19 - everything Autodesk related it just
02:21 - works um with Maya you can just save as
02:24 - a Maya file I am pretty sure that you
02:27 - can do this with 3ds Max to too but um
02:31 - don't hang me out on that um and if
02:35 - you're using other programs that doesn't
02:38 - know how to extract these kind of data
02:41 - um obj will work but it will only work
02:46 - for the modeling so only the model will
02:49 - be imported um with Maya and stuff you
02:52 - can import
02:53 - everything so um just think about this
02:57 - um when when when you go through this I
02:59 - want talk about all the programs then I
03:01 - could continue on
03:03 - okay anyway um so what I did I just
03:07 - saved the maze um and when you save uh
03:11 - something it'll just look like this this
03:14 - is a sort that I made um it won't have
03:18 - any texture Dam uh any texture at all or
03:22 - anything like
03:23 - that all right so um let's take a look
03:26 - at how we apply the uh texture so what I
03:29 - did is simply if we take the sword for
03:31 - example that's unapplied um first of all
03:35 - I click on it and then I go to the
03:37 - import settings and just make sure that
03:39 - everything is as I want it to be um I
03:42 - want to import the materials you can
03:44 - uncheck this if you want to apply some
03:46 - in unity um but I made some in in my so
03:49 - I want to use those um you can you can
03:52 - do something with the normals the
03:55 - tangents um I won't explain that if
03:58 - you're going to make a light map that
04:00 - means later bake the lighting then you
04:03 - could click the generate light map uis
04:06 - don't worry we'll talk about this later
04:08 - but generally for stuff like that moves
04:10 - like a sword you won't um you you won't
04:13 - check that uh generate colliders this is
04:16 - not necessary unless you want it to
04:18 - collide like extremely beautiful um but
04:22 - this is heavy so normally uncheck that
04:25 - optimize mesh that's a good thing and
04:27 - the scale factor you can change this
04:29 - when you import it this is going to be a
04:31 - different number than what you see here
04:34 - um um because it depends on what kind of
04:38 - scale your um program uses that we have
04:42 - imported from and stuff like that so and
04:45 - Rick and animations you can just leave
04:47 - this we could go in and just say uh none
04:51 - under the rig and um apply and on the
04:55 - animation just hit don't import
04:59 - animation if you don't have any
05:00 - animation and hit apply okay so uh when
05:03 - we go ahead and drag this into
05:06 - Unity the uh the scale factor is
05:08 - actually pretty fine with uh this sword
05:12 - um so if I go ahead and select it and
05:14 - hit F you can see that that's not too
05:17 - bad um should it been be completely
05:20 -  don't you see it or is it huge
05:23 - then you can go into the sword here
05:25 - click on it in the um Imports and then
05:29 - you can just change the scale factor to
05:32 - um to change the way that it's
05:35 - imported um so if we click on the sort
05:38 - again um we can go ahead and disable
05:40 - stuff like the uh animator you can right
05:43 - click and remove that component because
05:45 - we won't use any of the animation from
05:48 - Maya and uh we could also go ahead and
05:52 - rename stuff like the the uh materials
05:55 - so um every time you import a model um
05:59 - it will either import a material or
06:02 - create one on its own so if we go under
06:05 - to the folder here that it will
06:07 - automatically create wherever you import
06:10 - it um you can see the materials that it
06:13 - automatically imported so we could go
06:15 - ahead and just rename this to
06:19 - sort texture I already I have done this
06:24 - already so I'll just call this 02 but
06:27 - that this is how you would do it and uh
06:30 - then you would go back and click on the
06:31 - sword because right now it doesn't have
06:34 - the texture applied and all you have to
06:36 - do is simply take the Photoshop file
06:39 - that you used in Maya or whatever um and
06:42 - my look like this and just drag it in
06:46 - and now you can see that we have some
06:48 - beautiful um
06:53 - texturing or something like that and um
06:58 - yeah that's basic it for importing
07:01 - assets so um then then what you can do
07:04 - is you can simply drag it down here to
07:06 - make a preset uh I won't do this because
07:08 - I've already done this and um I'll just
07:12 - drag in the Maze that I made so I'll
07:14 - drag this in to the scene and we can see
07:17 - that it's on the ground so we can just
07:19 - drag it up and rotate it
07:25 - 180Â° I'm
07:27 - sorry and uh we want this to be exactly
07:30 - where our other Maes so we can go under
07:33 - the player main camera m and then the
07:36 - mace and just drag this in and zero out
07:39 - the transform just to get it positioned
07:42 - Oh wrong object selected so select the
07:47 - Mace new Maze and then Z out the
07:50 - transform and you can see it disappears
07:53 - inside of this um and then we can just
07:56 - drag it onto the melee again and if you
07:58 - want you could delete the maze um you
08:01 - could um you can do whatever you want
08:04 - here um but basically I'm going to
08:07 - remove some of the animation and all of
08:09 - this I'm going to redo this um I might
08:13 - do this off camera now that I've shown
08:14 - you how to do it but um I'll just go
08:17 - ahead and delete the original Maze and
08:20 - now you can see the new Maze and we'll
08:22 - just try to position this um and also
08:26 - before I noticed that the mace was
08:28 - really too big it was just too far away
08:31 - to be able to see it so I'll drag closer
08:34 - to the camera now um like this this
08:37 - looks a lot better um so I think that
08:41 - this will do for now so if we go ahead
08:44 - and hit play um it is stuck to the uh
08:47 - the screen as
08:48 - always and um we could go ahead and just
08:52 - delete the animator component from that
08:55 - also okay great um so I have an error
09:00 - um The Maze of the Mele system is not
09:03 - defined okay so um what we're going to
09:06 - do now is we are going to uh play around
09:08 - with the way that our Mele system works
09:12 - um because this will be fine as long as
09:14 - you do it in all in unity and it's not
09:18 - that complex and but once it starts to
09:21 - get more serious um you should really do
09:24 - this in uh another way and that is by
09:28 - creating a me system script for every
09:31 - every weapon so let's go ahead and
09:35 - remove this component and then drag then
09:39 - go under script and then drag the Mele
09:42 - system onto the mace instead so the mace
09:45 - itself and then we go ahead and double
09:48 - click on the Mele system script and open
09:50 - up it up in mod develop and um you can
09:55 - go ahead and just keep some of this
09:56 - animation stuff um what you can do is
09:59 - you can uh select it right click and
10:06 - um let me just check for
10:10 - this
10:13 - uh this is weird uh normally oh that it
10:17 - was okay so you can select something and
10:20 - you can right click it and click chuckle
10:22 - line comments uh comments and this will
10:26 - just comment it out so that you can
10:28 - later
10:29 - um you can you can later on come in this
10:32 - so you still have it but uh it won't get
10:35 - used in the script so this is really
10:38 - useful if just want to temporarily get
10:41 - rid of something without having to
10:43 - create multiple scripts okay um this
10:46 - video might be long it might be cut up
10:48 - into two parts uh we'll
10:50 - see all right so let's go ahead and
10:53 - delete the uh maze transform because now
10:56 - the um script is applied to the mace
10:59 - itself so we won't have to um say which
11:03 - game object it has to go under and stuff
11:05 - like that um we can just use this so um
11:10 - we can go ahead and delete all the parts
11:12 - where it says the maze do something um
11:15 - and I'll just go ahead and comment out
11:18 - the animation. playay attack also um so
11:22 - if physics blah blah blah blah blah that
11:24 - looks fine distance and this then the
11:27 - max distance hit. transform the damage
11:30 - send message okay so this all looks
11:33 - pretty fine we can go back into unity
11:36 - and then clear all these erors out and
11:39 - see if it's still working so go to our
11:44 - enemy and hit it hit the mouse a couple
11:46 - of times and it is not so um let's see
11:51 - what we have done
11:53 - wrong um it might be
11:58 - something with
12:00 - the
12:02 - centering yeah um so right now it's
12:07 - calculating the the hits um from our
12:10 - mace so we we are going to want this to
12:14 - calculate from our M so um under the um
12:19 - transform. position this is going to be
12:22 - um a new variable so we're going to
12:24 - create a new variable and we are going
12:27 - to call this uh for um the
12:32 - system so this way we can reference um
12:36 - the the parented system this mely um so
12:40 - we can get the exact point instead of
12:43 - get uh instead of getting the point that
12:46 - we have um applied the maze to this
12:50 - might sound confusing um but you'll get
12:53 - it in a sec so we'll use this transform
12:56 - instead of the maze uh transform
12:59 - okay so the system uh and then
13:03 - transform and
13:05 - semicolon uh and then we can just go
13:07 - ahead and use the
13:10 - system. transform.position
13:13 - and the
13:15 - system. transform.
13:18 - direction um and hit. transform send
13:22 - message so this should be fine save this
13:24 - and go back to Unity let's see if we get
13:27 - any errors we don't and let's try oh we
13:32 - have to assign the variable so stop
13:34 - playing and then just track the melee on
13:36 - this trans for and then hit play again
13:39 - and hopefully this time this will work
13:41 - so click and there you go so um now we
13:45 - actually have a much better system set
13:48 - up because what this allows us to do is
13:52 - it allows us to uh create functions that
13:55 - uh are called on some on certain times
13:58 - depending on animation and what I mean
14:00 - by this is um one of you um probably
14:04 - some of you but one of you um texted me
14:06 - and said that um he wanted to apply the
14:11 - damage only when the character actually
14:15 - stun SW swinging the sword or weapon uh
14:18 - and not immediately um so a little delay
14:22 - um and I think that the best way to do
14:24 - this is the following so um okay so go
14:28 - under animation
14:30 - and um for this I'm just going to create
14:32 - uh quickly a uh attack animation so I'm
14:35 - going to create click this red button
14:38 - add component and then I'm going to call
14:40 - this animation for attack with a capital
14:43 - letter as before um and I'm going to add
14:48 - keys to the transform the rotation so
14:52 - the position and the rotation I'm going
14:55 - to drag the cursor um
15:00 - out to about two seconds and then do it
15:03 - again so we are sure that we are storing
15:05 - all this data and uh we can get back to
15:09 - the point we came
15:11 - from and um first of all I want him to
15:15 - pull back the maze as he's ready to
15:17 - swing it so this would be something
15:22 - like this maybe
15:25 - oh I'm not good at at this so he
15:30 - whoa whoa um well that was
15:35 - unexpected um let's let's try this out
15:38 - again so we have all the key frames here
15:42 - at Key and um about at this point he
15:48 - should drag the mace back just a little
15:52 - bit
15:54 - and something like
15:57 - this so just like like that
16:02 - um and what we can now do is we can um
16:07 - tell it that it needs to hit so we can
16:10 - make the hitting animation so this would
16:14 - look something
16:16 - like um this and then I'm going to
16:20 - toggle between the local and the global
16:22 - transform as we talked about in earlier
16:25 - videos um it's really
16:29 - really nice to know how to use
16:32 - that
16:34 - um something like this
16:37 - maybe so he hits and then it goes back
16:41 - and we probably need to like make this
16:44 - quicker yeah so you can just drag the
16:47 - top ones here um to make it look a hell
16:51 - of a lot
16:56 - better so um I'm sorry if this is
17:00 - tracking out um I'll show you some cool
17:02 - stuff in just a
17:04 - minute we just need to so that looks
17:09 - fine uh it's it's all right so we'll
17:12 - just continue on with this just hit uh
17:14 - hitting the the flat button and change
17:18 - this
17:18 - to
17:20 - um we could do one just leave it at
17:23 - default and then hit the stop recording
17:26 - okay so clear out the variable because I
17:28 - get tired of looking at all the arrows
17:31 - and um hit the Maze and you can see play
17:33 - automatically is set so we'll just turn
17:36 - this off and um all right so if we go
17:41 - back into the animation uh what we can
17:43 - do now is we can simply say tell the
17:47 - computer that at this time we need to
17:50 - call a function and this is something
17:52 - built into Unity into the animation
17:54 - system so if I say that this is the
17:57 - point maybe a little earlier
18:01 - maybe there um because he might hit
18:06 - before I don't know won't matter that
18:08 - much but um if I say that this is the
18:11 - point where um I would like uh to apply
18:16 - the
18:17 - damage then uh I can create a new event
18:20 - so uh click this button here add event
18:23 - and we can uh select the event and we
18:28 - can then
18:29 - um in our script select which function
18:32 - it needs to call so let's go back to our
18:35 - script and add a function so uh double
18:37 - click on the mly system script um I'm
18:39 - sorry go just go back to mod develop um
18:44 - and yes now we can create a new function
18:46 - so instead of um doing all of this we
18:52 - can say that if input get button down
18:55 - fire then call a function so um uh or
19:00 - I'm sorry then start the animation and
19:02 - then the animation will call the
19:04 - function so um all the way in the button
19:08 - we'll make um a new function and we
19:11 - could call this hm um we could call this
19:15 - attack maybe uh apply damage I know
19:18 - attack damage yes this will do for now
19:22 - and we'll just make
19:25 - these two parentheses and then the curly
19:28 - brackets and some space and now we can
19:31 - just go ahead and copy all of
19:35 - this of this uh so hit crl X to delete
19:40 - it and then contrl V down here to paste
19:43 - it
19:44 - back um and so this will take care of
19:48 - the actual damaging and we'll just need
19:51 - to um tell the computer to play an
19:54 - animation whenever we hit fire so uh
19:57 - animation play attack and uh if we go
20:02 - back into Unity now and select this key
20:05 - uh we can select the attack damage and
20:08 - it will now call this so um if you hover
20:12 - over it you can see the attack damage so
20:15 - um if we um go ahead oh we were in play
20:22 - mode um I think nothing I I don't think
20:26 - it mattered okay so hit play and we'll
20:29 - test this out so boom boom and then the
20:33 - object disappears so um maybe I should
20:38 - draw this out to make you understand it
20:40 - a little easier so um we have the we
20:43 - have the script
20:46 - oh um this is the script um a red box
20:51 - apparently this is the script and inside
20:53 - of the script we just say that button
20:59 - is
21:00 - pressed then we want something to happen
21:03 - what do we want to happen we want the um
21:06 - computer to Simply play an animation so
21:10 - play
21:12 - attack um and then um over here in uh
21:17 - the other I just pointed at the screen
21:20 - I'm my WR um over here this is um the
21:24 - actual animation part itself we just
21:29 - tell it that um we just in unity tell it
21:33 - that
21:34 - when um so so when uh we reach a certain
21:41 - point in the animation so add event so
21:46 - when we reach an event then we want to
21:51 - call a function and this function is
21:54 - called um what did we call it I think we
21:59 - called it um
22:01 - attack damage so then call the attack
22:05 - damage and then we head back into the
22:08 - script so um we can make some arrows for
22:12 - this so This goes there and then we call
22:15 - the attack damage so it goes back and in
22:18 - the script we then T we then do all of
22:22 - the damaging so we then do the ray cast
22:26 - and uh if the is met and is correct we
22:31 - then send the
22:33 - message to our enemy so um over here we
22:38 - have
22:39 - our enemy so this is our enemy so we go
22:42 - ahead and
22:43 - say oh enemy we don't like you and you
22:46 - need to lose damage so um on the enemy
22:50 - itself we have put a script that just
22:52 - said says
22:54 - um
22:56 - apply damage this is the the function
22:59 - and this is called when we get sent the
23:01 - message apply damage and then here
23:06 - health is uh is equal to one less than
23:11 - before or 20 less or 50 less this value
23:15 - is
23:17 - defined over here in the original script
23:19 - and this way we can do
23:21 - everything very easily so um that's how
23:25 - it works okay so don't save this um
23:28 - and now we have a much better Mele
23:31 - system so if you would want to make um
23:34 - different weapons um several weapons we
23:37 - could go ahead and um just apply the
23:40 - same M system script and then we could
23:43 - just change the damage so they will have
23:46 - individual damage we can change the
23:48 - distance if some weapons are longer than
23:50 - others and we can change the animations
23:53 - and we can even make different functions
23:54 - if we want different stuff to happen
23:56 - happen um let's say say that it's a
23:59 - magical wand and you want big explosions
24:01 - to appear so um this is all for now and
24:06 - um this has been how to create a
24:08 - survival game by braies done by
24:12 - braies and um I've been working hard on
24:15 - our website is um it is up but it's not
24:20 - pretty yet um we we have implemented a
24:25 - lot of fun uh functionality into it um
24:28 - um also um you will be able to download
24:31 - the scripts as I have written them so
24:34 - far um soon there so um I'll give a link
24:38 - as soon as it's up but until then you
24:40 - can support us by going to our Facebook
24:42 - or Twitter um or just subscribing and
24:46 - liking on YouTube um I hope I I just
24:49 - really want to help you guys out and
24:52 - then if you want you can um help me out
24:55 - by just liking and sharing because we're
24:58 - just trying to get out on the internet
25:00 - what with um what we do so um thank you
25:05 - thank you um thank you for watching and
25:08 - uh I'll see you in the next video
25:11 - [Music]
