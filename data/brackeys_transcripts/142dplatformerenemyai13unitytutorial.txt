00:00 - thanks for tuning in at
00:03 - braies hello everyone and welcome to the
00:05 - 14th episode of how to make a 2d
00:08 - platformer in unity I hope you have had
00:11 - a Merry Christmas and a great New Year
00:13 - it's 2015 now and we're going to kick it
00:16 - off with enemy AI this is probably the
00:20 - uh most exciting tutorial we've had in
00:23 - some time and uh enemy AI can't be very
00:27 - difficult and hard to wrap your head
00:28 - around but I promise you we're going to
00:30 - be using some great tools to make the
00:33 - process easier and that are also very
00:35 - powerful for doing many kinds of AI
00:39 - these tools are free and uh what the
00:41 - tools don't provide I've made for you
00:44 - cool so as always I uh suggest you check
00:48 - out the 2D assets pack available at
00:51 - brack.com uh because if we open it up
00:54 - here uh I have the final scripts in here
00:57 - under the scripts folder and I've also
00:59 - made an enemy uh inside of the Sprites
01:02 - to the platformer here you see the alien
01:05 - spaceship it's uh nothing special uh he
01:08 - pretty tiny there but here he is and
01:10 - that's what we're going to be using as
01:12 - an enemy for
01:14 - now cool um also if we head over to
01:19 - Chrome here you can see that I've made a
01:21 - new Forum post on the forum. bra.com
01:25 - and uh in here I showcase wave incoming
01:29 - uh it's still a way uh work in progress
01:33 - but it's basically a game I made with a
01:35 - a good friend of mine uh in just about
01:37 - 48 Hours attending dream hack and uh
01:41 - I've made all of the code publicly
01:43 - available I'm just touching up on some
01:45 - bucks and implementing the final audio
01:48 - and uh you can see here all the code is
01:50 - here and you're free to use it I've made
01:53 - a license file which suggests how you
01:55 - should use it uh so check that out also
01:58 - I'm working on another a really cool
02:00 - project and I won't tell you too much
02:03 - but let's just say it's going up on the
02:05 - unity asset store cool so back to the
02:09 - tutorial if you have any questions go to
02:12 - The Forum and uh I I'm there many others
02:15 - are there waiting to answer your
02:18 - questions so what we're going to be
02:20 - using today for AI is a solution called
02:24 - AAR pathf finding there are many
02:27 - different pathf finding algorithms out
02:30 - there and um another really good one for
02:33 - Unity is uh the rain engine um but for
02:37 - Simplicity sake and also because I've
02:39 - just used it in wave incoming we are
02:42 - going to use the uh Asar pathf finding
02:46 - algorithm and that is freely available
02:48 - so let's head back to Chrome let's sear
02:51 - for search for AAR path finding unity
02:56 - and it's the first one that pops up here
02:57 - the oh I don't even want to try to
03:00 - pronounce that but you have the URL
03:02 - right there and we're going to click on
03:04 - that then we're going to go under
03:06 - download and you're simply going to
03:07 - download the newest free version uh free
03:11 - is going to be more than plenty for what
03:12 - we are doing here don't worry and uh you
03:15 - might want to stay out of the beta
03:17 - because there can be bucks so just
03:19 - download the new uh newest stable
03:21 - version here I'm using
03:23 - 3.5.2 and the version of unity I'm using
03:26 - is
03:27 - 4.6 now let's open up the
03:30 - uh ZIP file here you might want to
03:32 - extract that uh just to make sure that
03:36 - nothing goes wrong so I'm just going to
03:37 - show it in in a folder here if I can get
03:41 - it to open maybe not let's try that
03:44 - again under our uh
03:47 - downloads there we have it uh sh
03:51 - folder there it is right click extract
03:55 - all extract just going to think about it
03:59 - and here here we can simply navigate
04:01 - through our folder and double click on
04:03 - the unity package and it will start
04:05 - importing in unity make sure you have
04:07 - Unity open while you do this and then uh
04:10 - as you can see it's going to import all
04:12 - this stuff and it's it's quite scary
04:15 - just how much stuff it's going to import
04:17 - but it's very well written it's very
04:20 - well optimized and it's very well
04:22 - documented so there are plenty of stuff
04:25 - in here but most of it we're not going
04:27 - to be using and all of it belongs under
04:30 - the AAR pathfinding project folder so
04:33 - you won't get any weird stuff clouded
04:36 - around your project it's just all in the
04:39 - AAR P pathf finding project folder now
04:42 - let's hit import it's just going to
04:44 - think about it for SEC here so wait for
04:46 - Unity to import all of the assets
04:49 - there's some images in there and stuff
04:52 - that might take just a a couple of
04:54 - seconds here so while it does
04:57 - that uh we can maybe start organizing
05:00 - our project a bit because I think that
05:02 - our project panel here is getting a bit
05:04 - cluttered so before we get started let's
05:07 - right click hit create and then folder
05:09 - and let's call this one
05:12 - animation and let's drag in all of our
05:15 - animation files and animation
05:19 - controllers let's also make one for
05:23 - scripts where we can drag in all of our
05:28 - Scripts
05:32 - cool let's make one for
05:38 - materials you can of course organize
05:40 - this however you would like to so we're
05:43 - just going to drag all of our materials
05:45 - onto that then we can maybe do one for
05:51 - Sprites uh so our muscle flash that's
05:53 - prefab isn't it no that's a Sprite this
05:57 - is the prefab so make sure to grab the
06:00 - Sprite there you can also uh organize
06:03 - after um uh tags or uh categories or
06:07 - whatever you hear unities made a lot of
06:10 - of tools to help you do that but again
06:12 - just grab all of the Sprites here our
06:14 - blue background our environment map our
06:19 - whoops that shouldn't be right R didn't
06:23 - want to change anything there no okay so
06:27 - unit is behaving a bit weirdly here uh
06:29 - so I'm just going to drag them in one by
06:31 - one so let's take our asut Sprite sheet
06:33 - our blue background let's take our
06:36 - environment our muscle
06:38 - flash uh this is our player prefab I
06:41 - believe yes and uh this is a pistol
06:44 - prefab cool let's make a prefab folder
06:47 - also since we have so many prefabs now
06:50 - so prefabs and we can drag in our muscle
06:52 - flash pistol and player also the GM
06:55 - bullet Trail and spawn particles just
06:58 - drag them under there
07:00 - and uh I think we're going to wait with
07:02 - with an audio folder and all that we
07:04 - don't have much more cool so that was
07:08 - the boring part let's get started with
07:10 - some actual pathf finding here so what
07:12 - is necessary to get a star pathf finding
07:15 - to work well first of all I just want to
07:18 - show you that on their website they have
07:20 - this tab called documentation which will
07:22 - walk you through pretty much any feature
07:25 - in a star what you can also do is check
07:27 - out the get started page if you think
07:30 - that I'm moving at a wrong Pace or if
07:32 - that's something you don't quite get
07:34 - it's going to tell you many of the same
07:36 - things that I'm going to do today cool
07:39 - so what we're going to do here I'm just
07:40 - going to check my
07:43 - time okay so we at 9 Minutes in
07:46 - approximately cool so what we're going
07:48 - to do is we're going to create an empty
07:50 - object which is going to be like the
07:52 - master of our path finding so let's hit
07:55 - create empty or control shift n let's
07:58 - call this a St and move it to the top I
08:01 - like to keep all of the uh GM objects
08:04 - and um sort of um uh Global uh scripts
08:10 - at the top here uh so let's Z out the
08:13 - transform let's hit add component and
08:15 - what we're going to do is we're going to
08:17 - go under the uh newly added component uh
08:20 - category here called pathf finding and
08:22 - let's click the path finder and this has
08:25 - confused me a bit in the past because
08:27 - the path finding here is called
08:30 - Pathfinder but as a script it's called a
08:34 - star path so just know that it's
08:36 - Pathfinder but it's really called a star
08:39 - path what we are then going to do here
08:42 - is we are going to go into the scene
08:44 - View and we're going to go out of 2D
08:47 - mode we're going to hit F to focus on
08:50 - our empty game object then we can open
08:53 - the graphs Tab and we're going to create
08:55 - a quid graph there are many different
08:57 - ways of creating uh sort of um graphs
09:02 - that simulate where our enemy can walk
09:05 - so there uh one of the first steps to
09:08 - pathf finding
09:10 - is uh teaching the computer where we
09:14 - have obstacles and where it can actually
09:16 - work and one of the ways to do this is
09:19 - using a grid and another very common way
09:23 - especially for 3D environments is making
09:26 - what is called a nav mesh that stand for
09:29 - navigation mesh and it basically
09:32 - generates this 3D mesh uh sometimes it's
09:36 - a plane it's actually most of the time
09:38 - it's a plane um that that just shows
09:42 - where you can walk but instead we're
09:44 - simply going to make a grid graph which
09:46 - is just basically a bunch of points uh
09:50 - but just a bunch of way points that um
09:53 - are placed wherever you can walk and
09:55 - then some non-w walkable way points that
09:57 - are of course placed on obstacles or in
10:00 - holes or on um if you have any mountains
10:03 - that you can't work on top of and all of
10:06 - that so let's hit a uh let's create a
10:09 - grid graph and we can expand it here and
10:12 - you can see that it lays out all of
10:14 - these points but right now our grid
10:17 - graph is laid out on the wrong axis so
10:21 - what most beginners do here is they
10:22 - simply rotate the whole plane and you
10:25 - will notice that that just simply
10:27 - doesn't work so in just instead make
10:30 - sure the transform is zeroed and then go
10:33 - under the grid graph settings and you
10:35 - will see an option called rotation and
10:37 - we're going to rotate it uh 90 uh 90° on
10:41 - the x-axis which is basically positive
10:45 - 270 then what we also going to do you
10:48 - will see that these uh squares here
10:49 - don't update yet they will in a sec when
10:52 - we go down here and hit scan but first
10:54 - let's set some more settings so first uh
10:57 - we want to maybe expand this because
11:00 - this is currently very very small so
11:03 - let's make uh this number this number of
11:06 - nodes here which is basically the number
11:09 - of points that we can walk on let's make
11:12 - that let's start out with a 100 by 100
11:16 - that should be plenty big uh for our
11:19 - current level and you can of course
11:21 - always expand onto this then uh we're
11:24 - going to keep the node size at around
11:26 - one and then we're going to Center this
11:28 - so make sure it's set in the center here
11:30 - and then do 0 0 0 and you can see that
11:34 - again the cubes don't update but we
11:37 - should navigate using the lines
11:39 - here then what we're going to do is
11:42 - we're going to make sure that down here
11:44 - uh we have the number of connections set
11:46 - to eight which means that we can move
11:48 - diagonally also and that gives a natural
11:51 - moving
11:52 - feel and then under the max climb uh you
11:56 - can see that the climb axis is currently
11:58 - set to
11:59 - Y and that is definitely not what we
12:03 - want because right now if the climb at
12:06 - AIS is set to Y it means that it uh our
12:10 - AI will think that it's walking upwards
12:13 - towards uh up uh towards a hill or
12:15 - something when it's really just going up
12:18 - on the screen here and that's not what
12:20 - we want if we want to make say flying AI
12:24 - then we want to na it to navigate freely
12:27 - on the X and Y and then be completely
12:29 - restricted on the Z so what we're going
12:33 - to do instead is we're going to set the
12:35 - climb axis to Z and set the max climb to
12:40 - zero cool then we're going to check use
12:43 - 2D physics because we're using the 2D
12:45 - colliders that comes with unity 4.6 you
12:49 - can of course uncheck this and use
12:51 - normal 3D colliders even with 2D Sprites
12:55 - I don't recommend it though because the
12:57 - 2D physics are pretty awesome
13:00 - then we're going to make sure that
13:01 - Collision testing is set to true and uh
13:04 - the collider type is not going to be
13:06 - capsu that will result in an error
13:09 - instead we're going to be using either
13:11 - Rays or spheres first I'm going to show
13:14 - you spheres and then I'm going to talk a
13:15 - bit about why rays are better for
13:17 - instance so uh let's start with the
13:20 - sphere Dam diameter of let's say
13:24 - two and uh now we can go down here and
13:27 - hit scan you can see that it creates
13:30 - this huge grid and uh all of the uh blue
13:34 - uh grid lines here rep represents the
13:37 - part of the area that we can actually
13:39 - walk on whoops I should really stop
13:41 - rotating that uh I'm simply going to
13:44 - rotate this back so 0 0 Z sorry here uh
13:49 - and then 90 again and we're going to hit
13:51 - scan again there we
13:54 - go so you can see we have all these
13:57 - different grids and uh grid lines and uh
14:00 - actually I'm going to bring this in this
14:02 - is way too many notes for now we're
14:04 - going to do 50 and 50 and Center it out
14:06 - again here that's better it's SC cool
14:10 - but currently our obstacles here our
14:13 - platforms and our player and nothing in
14:17 - the environment is preventing the enemy
14:19 - from moving there so now it can walk
14:21 - pretty much anywhere so what are we
14:24 - doing wrong well you notice that under
14:26 - the Collision uh testing tab we have
14:29 - this option called mask and that's
14:32 - currently set to
14:34 - nothing well that basically means that
14:36 - we are currently not including anything
14:39 - as being
14:41 - obstacles and here you can select
14:43 - different layers so let's say if we
14:45 - selected the player this is not what we
14:48 - want but we can do it for testing and
14:50 - then hit scan you can see that our
14:52 - player is now being treated as an
14:54 - obstacle and the enemy will not be able
14:56 - to move inside of these uh this area
15:00 - right
15:01 - here but again it's not really the
15:04 - player that we want to avoid that's
15:07 - actually going to be their target so
15:10 - what we're going to do
15:11 - instead is we are going to um create
15:16 - some layers for all of our obstacles so
15:19 - let's set this back to nothing Let's uh
15:21 - select what we want to be obstacles
15:24 - which is basically the platforms here
15:27 - let's go and layer hit add layer and we
15:30 - can clean up our layers a bit so we have
15:32 - the player we have the background we're
15:35 - going to set this to
15:40 - obstacle and then again select all of
15:43 - them and now change the layer to
15:45 - obstacle and now you will see that their
15:49 - box collider 2D will prevent uh enemies
15:53 - from moving here so when we generate the
15:55 - grid again this will actually affect the
15:59 - enemy movement um what we might want to
16:01 - do at some point is change these away
16:03 - from a box collider 2D because um a
16:06 - polygon collider of some sorts might be
16:09 - more accurate but for now we're just
16:10 - going to leave it as is you can do that
16:12 - on your own if you want to experiment so
16:15 - now let's head back on the da star
16:17 - object uh and we can go ahead and and
16:19 - scan this again and it's not working
16:22 - that's because we have to add the
16:24 - obstacle layer to our mask so hit scan
16:28 - and you will see that now the algorithm
16:31 - is working perfectly I really need to
16:33 - stop rotating this this is second time
16:37 - now so let's just try this one more time
16:40 - so 0 0 and 270 there and for some reason
16:47 - scan cool okay so I'm just going to
16:50 - change away from the rotation tool here
16:52 - because apparently I can't keep my hands
16:54 - off it cool so if we head into the game
16:57 - view here and enable g mode you can see
16:59 - that it's currently looking quite okay
17:02 - but if we zoom in you will notice that
17:05 - there's quite a gap between where uh we
17:08 - can stand and where they can
17:11 - walk so let's try and change this back
17:13 - to
17:14 - Ray and hit scan again it's much much
17:18 - closer now what method you prefer using
17:21 - really depends on the environment you're
17:23 - making and how long you want it to take
17:26 - for such a small grid like this is it
17:29 - pretty much won't matter performance-
17:31 - wise uh because we're not going to be
17:33 - generating at runtime we're going to be
17:35 - generating beforehand but um if you have
17:39 - this huge scene there might be some
17:41 - variations there's plenty of
17:43 - documentation on this so if you're more
17:45 - Curious than just selecting R and
17:47 - hitting scan please go ahead and read up
17:49 - on that cool so now we actually have our
17:54 - navigation grid set up so we can uh uh
17:58 - close close down the tab here on the
18:00 - grid graph and I'm also going to click
18:01 - the ey here to disable the um the grid
18:05 - view then we can tab away and you can
18:09 - see that it has these red triangles
18:11 - where it cannot move now let's hit save
18:14 - because we've made such good progress
18:17 - and uh let's go ahead and create our
18:21 - enemy so this is a pretty uh good uh
18:24 - place for me to split this episode up so
18:27 - uh this was the nav ation part in the
18:29 - next one we going to be creating um the
18:32 - enemy script that is going to utilize
18:35 - everything we've set up here so I'm
18:38 - sorry I have to split this up but um the
18:41 - next episode is going to be uh just as
18:43 - awesome maybe even more awesome because
18:45 - then we are finally going to get
18:46 - something moving hopefully finally cool
18:50 - so thanks for watching and I'll see you
18:52 - in the next
18:57 - video
19:02 - oh
