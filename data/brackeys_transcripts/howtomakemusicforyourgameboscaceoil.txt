00:00 - so if you want to make music for your
00:01 - game there's a billion different ways to
00:02 - go about it and there's so many
00:03 - different programs to help you with it
00:05 - today we'll be looking at one that is
00:06 - super quick and easy to use
00:07 - it's called buzz sketch something it's a
00:10 - great tool I've used it for a lot of
00:11 - game jams so let's go ahead and get
00:15 - started so to get started go to busca
00:17 - co-ed i will have a link in the
00:19 - description for those of you who don't
00:20 - want to spell that here you can choose
00:22 - between the online version we're
00:23 - downloading to your computer
00:25 - I find the online version works pretty
00:26 - well but I always like having it on my
00:28 - system let's hit download choose a
00:30 - platform and it's going to start
00:32 - downloading on windows it will download
00:34 - as a zip file so simply unzip that and
00:36 - you should get a folder with an exe that
00:39 - we can go ahead and open up so here's
00:40 - what it looks like
00:41 - some people get a bit confused about the
00:43 - interface but let's just start from the
00:45 - beginning
00:45 - let's begin by hitting new song we then
00:47 - choose the BPM which is our tempo I'm
00:49 - going to set this down to 80 we can also
00:52 - select how many notes we want to make of
00:54 - a pattern what we're looking at here is
00:56 - one pattern and inside of a pattern we
00:59 - can place notes so here's the amount of
01:01 - notes that will make up our pattern and
01:02 - the small number is how many notes we
01:04 - want to make up a bar so if we change
01:06 - this to say 8 you can see that we now
01:09 - have 2 bars of 8 notes each most songs
01:12 - are written in 4/4 which means that we
01:14 - will have 4 notes each was the length of
01:16 - 1/4 a bar so we'll just leave that at 4
01:18 - 16 and now we can start placing notes by
01:21 - simply clicking and dragging you can
01:23 - start and pause playback by hitting this
01:25 - space key and you can remove notes by
01:27 - right clicking if you want to control
01:29 - the length of your note we use the
01:30 - scroll wheel some people can find it
01:32 - really daunting to have all of these
01:33 - different options well the music that we
01:35 - normally listen to is set in a certain
01:37 - scale we can think of a scale as a
01:39 - selection of some of these notes that go
01:41 - well together and we can define a scale
01:43 - by going to the bottom right corner and
01:45 - first selecting a key this is going to
01:47 - be the base note for our scale then we
01:49 - can choose what scale most of the music
01:51 - that we listen to I they said in major
01:53 - or minor major often giving a happy feel
01:56 - and minor more face sad feel but there
01:59 - are lots of others to choose from like
02:00 - blues and all the pentatonic scales
02:02 - along with some more exotic ones we'll
02:05 - just set ours to major and you can see
02:07 - now that it's really narrowed down the
02:08 - possibilities that we have in terms of
02:10 - notes and so now we should be able to
02:12 - just go nuts placing no
02:13 - along the scale and have it sound okay
02:16 - so let's make a short song I'm going to
02:18 - use my scroll wheel to make a bigger
02:20 - note and then going to create AC chord
02:22 - that's c e g and then going to make a D
02:25 - minor chord that's D F and then a let's
02:30 - follow that up with the G that's G B and
02:32 - D the last chord here is pretty
02:34 - stretched out from the rest of them and
02:36 - in general it tends to sound better if
02:38 - chords are close to each other we can
02:40 - actually just take the G here and raise
02:42 - it to the octave above so we simply go
02:44 - and select the G up here now the notes
02:46 - are much closer and we can have a listen
02:50 - [Music]
02:51 - so the sound that we're currently using
02:53 - is really bad let's go into instrument
02:56 - and here we can change the sound of our
02:58 - instrument this is a tiny bit weird
03:00 - because the first tab here allows you to
03:02 - choose an instrument and then the second
03:04 - one allows you to choose a sound however
03:06 - for the instrument MIDI which is not
03:09 - actually an instrument but a technique
03:10 - for triggering audio well then in here
03:13 - we have different categories as well so
03:15 - just remember that you can always go
03:16 - into MIDI to get more options I just
03:18 - want to hit the plus sign here in order
03:19 - to cycle through I think this sound is
03:26 - pretty good however it's a bit too clear
03:29 - on the high notes to get rid of those we
03:31 - can use this low-pass filter if I play
03:33 - and start adjusting this you can hear
03:36 - that we can cut off a bunch of
03:37 - frequencies for the sound and we can do
03:39 - this for any instrument so when you've
03:41 - chosen a sound that you're happy with
03:42 - let's go ahead and add another
03:44 - instrument to do that we hit add new
03:46 - instrument for this one I want a bass so
03:49 - that's going to change the instrument to
03:50 - a bass and I just want to use the analog
03:53 - bass notice how you can also fine tune
03:55 - the volume of each instrument over here
03:57 - however I don't want to write my bass
03:59 - line on top of our chords so let's go
04:01 - into arrangement and here we can see how
04:04 - we can combine different patterns in
04:05 - order to make up our song we have our
04:07 - first pattern here which sour chord
04:09 - progression we then hit add new select
04:12 - the new pattern click on the new pattern
04:14 - to selected and you can see our colored
04:16 - changes we can also see that at the
04:18 - bottom left here this pattern is using
04:21 - the analog bass but we could easily have
04:23 - the second pattern use the electric
04:24 - piano as well so we can always swap
04:26 - between those down
04:27 - here you'll notice that if you place a
04:29 - note and hit play it's not playing the
04:32 - reason why is that we also need to
04:33 - insert our pattern into the arrangement
04:35 - so let's start by only playing the
04:37 - chords let's then play both the chords
04:39 - and the bass to copy the chords we can
04:41 - simply drag on them and then we can go
04:43 - from there
04:44 - but again if we hit play it's just going
04:46 - to loop the first chord
04:48 - let's look us down here you can see what
04:50 - part of this song we currently want to
04:52 - play we can click on a particular bar or
04:54 - we can click and drag to play a longer
04:56 - part of the song so in our case let's
04:58 - just click on the second bar here so we
05:00 - can hear what our chord will sound like
05:01 - with our bass so bass is currently
05:05 - playing a really high note this is not
05:07 - really what we're going for
05:08 - well you can navigate through tone
05:10 - height by going to the right and
05:11 - pressing up or down or you could use WS
05:15 - or even the up and down arrow keys I
05:18 - always just have my hands placed on the
05:20 - keyboard ready to press wns let's now
05:22 - remove this note and let's try placing
05:24 - one down here that sounds a lot better
05:27 - also remember to change the scale for
05:29 - this instrument as well so let's set
05:31 - that to major so let's write our bass
05:34 - [Music]
05:38 - serious what mine sounds like let's add
05:44 - a melody on top let's go instrument add
05:46 - a new instrument this could definitely
05:48 - be a chip tune and it's just started
05:50 - with the square wave now let's go back
05:52 - into our arrangement let's add a new
05:54 - pattern it's automatically selected the
05:56 - square wave so that's good let's make
05:58 - another duplicate of our chord and of
06:01 - our bass let's now add this new pattern
06:03 - on top let's also make sure to preview
06:05 - that region and change the scale to
06:07 - major also when listening through the
06:09 - song before and notice our chords were a
06:11 - bit bright let's select the pattern and
06:12 - it's maybe shift these an octave down we
06:15 - could go and write all of the chords
06:16 - again or we could use the plus and minus
06:18 - here at the bottom so 1st chord starts
06:20 - at the C let's then hit the minus key
06:23 - until we get to the lower C let's now
06:26 - have a listen again
06:29 - that's so much better all right so let's
06:32 - construct a melody
06:35 - [Music]
06:47 - we could definitely add some more
06:49 - texture to this so I've gone ahead and
06:55 - added an extra layer to this melody
06:58 - [Music]
07:01 - I definitely like this however the
07:03 - melody is currently taking over the
07:04 - whole piece let's go into the instrument
07:06 - let's try and play around with the sound
07:16 - so I really like the dual square for
07:18 - this one
07:19 - [Music]
07:21 - finally let's add some drums that's it
07:24 - add new instrument let's choose drum kit
07:27 - I think we'll just go with the simple
07:28 - drum kit let's then go on to the
07:30 - arrangement let's add a new pattern
07:32 - let's also drag this in notice that we
07:34 - don't have any scale controls here
07:36 - that's because the different notes map
07:38 - to different drums so we have three
07:39 - different bass drums two snares to high
07:42 - hats and a crash let's start by adding
07:44 - in some bass drum it's also throwing a
07:48 - snare and the hi-hat here can be pretty
07:55 - dominating but I definitely want to have
07:57 - some in there I'll even throw in a crash
07:59 - on the four
07:59 - [Music]
08:05 - finally we probably want to add some
08:07 - variation to our stock because we're
08:09 - simply reusing the same patterns this
08:10 - will quickly become very repetitive but
08:12 - the program actually makes variation
08:14 - really easy to do let's add a variation
08:16 - to a melody to do that instead of simply
08:18 - clicking and dragging we use the middle
08:20 - mouse button and then drag now it's
08:22 - created a duplicate of that pattern and
08:24 - we can go in and edit specific notes
08:26 - let's also bring over all of our other
08:28 - tracks set the play back to this
08:30 - particular bar and just change around a
08:32 - few things even though almost all of our
08:43 - elements are the same having just the
08:45 - melody very will really help keep things
08:47 - interesting
08:48 - so now let's listen to our entire
08:50 - arrangement
08:50 - [Music]
09:02 - awesome from here on out it's just about
09:05 - adding more patterns creating more
09:06 - variation and combining different
09:08 - patterns in order to create new
09:09 - interesting results also whenever you're
09:12 - doing a song that is based on patterns
09:13 - like this it's a good idea to throw in a
09:15 - break once in a while or maybe even the
09:17 - contrast piece where something
09:18 - completely different happens I also just
09:21 - want to show you that if you go to
09:22 - advanced you can actually add swing to
09:24 - your sound but this is probably going to
09:26 - sound horrible for our song but if
09:28 - you're going for that swing jazz feel
09:30 - try bumping this up it's not great for
09:35 - this one finally to export your song go
09:37 - to file export and here we can choose
09:39 - between the wav file which is an audio
09:42 - file or a MIDI file if you want to load
09:44 - it into a MIDI editor if you want to
09:46 - import this into a game engine you would
09:47 - probably select the first one if I'm
09:52 - going to play through your entire song
09:54 - while it's exporting
09:55 - [Music]
10:01 - and at the end we can choose where to
10:03 - save it that's it save and we now have a
10:06 - song clip that you can share with your
10:08 - friends or throw into a game that's
10:11 - pretty much everything for basket seal I
10:12 - just want to leave you with one very
10:14 - very very important note and that is to
10:17 - always remember to save your CL file and
10:20 - do this a lot of time while making it so
10:23 - this is the project file that you can
10:24 - then later load up make sure to do this
10:27 - because for some stupid stupid reason
10:29 - this program will close if you click on
10:31 - something wrong it will create a new
10:33 - song and sometimes might even crash and
10:35 - it's not going to prompt you or anything
10:37 - it just does so I've lost so much work
10:39 - because I forgot to save so please
10:42 - please do that that's also the only
10:44 - issue I've had on that have fun guys
