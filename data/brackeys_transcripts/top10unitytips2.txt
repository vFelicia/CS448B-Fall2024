00:00 - hello everyone I just can't believe how
00:01 - well my previous Unity tips were
00:03 - received I love of you guys were asking
00:04 - for more so here are my top 10 Unity
00:06 - quick tips 2.0 all right let's go number
00:09 - one maximizing Windows you can quickly
00:12 - maximize and minimize windows in Unity
00:14 - by hovering over them and hitting shift
00:16 - space this is particularly useful for
00:18 - the scene and game View and sometimes
00:20 - even the animator if you're working on a
00:21 - large controller number two locking
00:24 - layers sometimes when you're working on
00:25 - a scene with a lot of objects it can be
00:27 - hard to select the right one thankfully
00:29 - Unity allows you to create a layer
00:30 - assign objects you don't want to click
00:32 - on to that layer and then lock it it
00:34 - even works for sorting layers as well
00:35 - now you can click away without a care in
00:37 - the world number three quick Focus now
00:39 - most people who've been using Unity for
00:41 - a little while probably know that you
00:42 - can quickly focus on an object by
00:44 - selecting it hovering over the scene
00:46 - View and hitting F but something that a
00:47 - lot of people Miss is that if you double
00:49 - tap the F key you will lock onto that
00:51 - object this is really useful if you want
00:53 - to inspect moving objects number four
00:55 - tool tips in the last video we looked at
00:57 - using heads and spaces to better
00:58 - organize your script but if you want to
01:00 - be 100% on top of your inspector game
01:02 - you can use the tool tip attribute to
01:04 - write a variable description that will
01:06 - appear when hovering over it number five
01:08 - Auto statements when writing for Loop
01:10 - there's quite a bit of syntax that you
01:11 - need to get right luckily in Visual
01:13 - Studio you can simply write four and
01:15 - then press the Tab Key twice this will
01:17 - automatically generate a fol you you can
01:19 - now just tap through and fill out the
01:21 - desired information then hit enter to
01:23 - complete it this also works with if
01:25 - forage while and switch statements
01:27 - number six regions for some reason I see
01:30 - very few people using regions been
01:31 - programming in unity personally I
01:33 - couldn't do a day without it regions
01:34 - allow you to Mark a certain part of your
01:36 - code this way if you sometimes Rite
01:38 - monstrously large scripts like I do you
01:40 - can easily collapse parts of your code
01:42 - to focus on the important bits to begin
01:43 - a section simply write # region and
01:46 - insert # and region to close it number
01:48 - seven documentation shortcut ever
01:50 - wondered what a component does or what
01:53 - one of the variables mean well you can
01:54 - quickly navigate to the documentation
01:56 - for a component by simply hitting the
01:58 - book in the upper right corner this is a
02:00 - lot faster than doing a Google search
02:02 - number eight expand and collapse all if
02:04 - you're holding down alt while expanding
02:05 - an object in the hierarchy it will
02:07 - expand all child objects as well the
02:09 - same thing happens when collapsing
02:11 - number nine color picking again most
02:13 - people probably know that you can sample
02:14 - colors using the Color Picker one neat
02:16 - thing about this though is that you can
02:18 - actually pick colors from outside the
02:19 - unity editor number 10 undocking the
02:22 - preview if you're inspecting a model
02:23 - animation and want to get a closer look
