00:00 - If you want to make a [videogame]
00:00 - But don't know where to start this video should help on you in the right direction.
00:04 - Making games is a complicated subject.
00:06 - But let's try and break it down.
00:08 - When the big studios create games.
00:09 - They do so in large teams. Each person has a specific role.
00:12 - Whether that be 3D modeling, programming, doing concept art or sound design.
00:16 - In reality though most people don't start with the team of professionals.
00:19 - More just a single laptop and some good ideas. ThatÂ´s at least how I got into it.
00:23 - Luckily over the last few years.
00:24 - There's been a big boom in the Indie games industry.
00:27 - Now small teams or even individuals can make hugely popular games.
00:30 - Such as SUPERHOT and Undertale just to name a few.
00:35 - Every video game runs on what is called a game engine.
00:38 - The engine is what tells the components in the computer stuff like how to render graphics or play audio.
00:42 - Games such as Half-life 2, Counter-strike and Portal all run on the [source] engine.
00:48 - Which is also why they have so many things in common when it comes to physics, graphics quality and gameplay?
00:52 - Previously game studios would have to spend a huge amount of work creating an engine from scratch
00:57 - Or purchase a pre-existing one from another studio
00:59 - Which was not cheap?
01:01 - But these days a lot of independent engines have been made with the sole purpose of people using them to build their games on top
01:06 - This brings us to the first decision an aspiring game developer has to make.
01:10 - What engine should I choose and the answer is?
01:13 - Well it depends. There are a lot of engines to choose from and they each have their strengths and weaknesses
01:18 - But here are some of the most popular ones.
01:20 - If you're interested in making a 2-d game and want to start with something not too difficult
01:24 - I find that game maker is pretty easy to pick up. Some examples of games made using game maker are Spelunky, Undertale and INK
01:31 - Game maker is essentially free however some features do require you to purchase a license
01:35 - I don't find most of these too important for beginners
01:38 - But do note that you can only export to windows using the free version.
01:41 - Unity however allows you to build games in both 2D and 3D that can be exported to a variety of platforms.
01:47 - Being currently the biggest player when it comes to Indie development
01:50 - Unity has powered games such as Hearthstone, Superhot and Kerbal space program
01:54 - Unity is also used by a lot of mobile developers
01:57 - Unreal engine is probably the most advanced of the three.
01:59 - It's an amazing engine for more experienced developers who are looking to make 3D games?
02:03 - But I wouldn't recommend it as a starting point.
02:05 - It's known for powering some really heavy games like
02:08 - Unreal tournament, Gears of War and Arkham Knight.
02:10 - Now some of you might know that I'm a bit 
biased here
02:12 - After all my entire YouTube channel is build around Unity.
02:15 - But I do believe that Unity is the perfect starting point for most developers. This is not because it does everything perfectly.
02:21 - No engine does.
02:22 - But because of the diversity.
02:23 - Unity supports both 2D and 3D games and deploys to both the web, desktop, mobile and console.
02:29 - Also when programming in Unity you can choose between C-Sharp and Javascript.
02:33 - Two widely adopted programming languages.
02:35 - So what you learn in Unity can easily be applied to other environments later down the road
02:39 - That's why I've decided to make a short series on how you can make your first game in Unity.
02:43 - The video seems to teach a bit about everything so that no matter if you want to become an artist, a level designer or programmer you will hopefully find it Useful
02:50 - So click on the screen now to be taken to the first video once it's out
02:53 - And that's pretty much it for this video
