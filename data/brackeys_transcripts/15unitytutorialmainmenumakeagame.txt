00:00 - thanks for tuning in at
00:02 - braies hello everyone and welcome to
00:05 - video number 15 in how to make a game a
00:08 - cool series of making a video game in
00:11 - unity wow it's been such a long time
00:14 - since the last one um I'm of course
00:16 - sorry that it's it's been such a while
00:20 - uh but I've had a lot of cool stuff to
00:22 - do in the meantime so since the last
00:26 - video I've started a series called how
00:28 - to make a 2d platform
00:30 - which I really think you should check
00:32 - out also started a series called um how
00:36 - to program in C SHP which is great if
00:39 - you want to make the transition
00:40 - transition from JavaScript to C or if
00:44 - you just want to become sharper on your
00:47 - language skills and also I've uh started
00:51 - a a smaller series covering some of the
00:53 - new stuff introduced with unity 4.6 beta
00:58 - because Unity 4.6 has has been released
01:00 - as a public beta and along with it the
01:03 - all new Unity guy system which is what
01:06 - we're going to be using today so today
01:08 - we're going to be creating this cool
01:10 - menu I can hit play here and you can see
01:14 - that we have a slider to adjust the
01:15 - Music Volume a play game button and a
01:18 - quit game button today we're not going
01:20 - to be making uh the actual uh sort of
01:24 - events happen when you actually interact
01:26 - with the menu but we will be setting it
01:29 - up like
01:31 - this um so before we get started I just
01:34 - quickly want to say that today's
01:36 - wallpaper can be downloaded at bra.com
01:39 - wallpapers the cool character here was
01:42 - made by a guy called Camilo also if you
01:45 - have any questions please head over to
01:47 - forum. bra.com where I among many other
01:50 - developers are just waiting to answer
01:52 - your questions and then of course if you
01:54 - want to download this uh beta head over
01:57 - to unity3d.com and go under Unity 4.6
02:01 - beta and you can download it for free
02:04 - here so that was it for the amazingly
02:07 - long intro now we can go ahead and get
02:10 - started with today's video so I'm just
02:14 - going to go ahead and and delete the
02:15 - scene here and load up the level that we
02:19 - uh we had when we left last and what
02:22 - we're going to do is we are first off
02:24 - going to duplicate this because we're
02:26 - going to be using many of the same
02:28 - elements so let's just selected in the
02:31 - uh project panel and hit contrl D and we
02:35 - can rename this to main menu now let's
02:39 - make sure to double click this so that
02:41 - we are in the main menu scene and uh
02:45 - let's go into the scene View and have a
02:46 - look at what we what is going on here so
02:49 - let's find our ball and hit F to focus
02:52 - on it now we can select uh all the
02:55 - platforms except one so we're just going
02:58 - to select all them here and just leave
03:01 - the one in the center then we can select
03:03 - the coin also and delete that we also
03:06 - going to delete the GM
03:08 - object and uh on the main camera here we
03:12 - are going to remove the camera control
03:14 - script so just hit remove component on
03:17 - that now let's with the camera selected
03:20 - let's just zoom bit in on the game
03:22 - object here let's move the camera up a
03:25 - bit and then let's rotate it uh along
03:29 - the Z
03:30 - oh no that's going to be the xaxis here
03:32 - so the red ring just going to rotate it
03:36 - down a bit and maybe move it even more
03:39 - up so it's going to look something like
03:43 - this uh we can go ahead and uh shift
03:46 - from local to Global uh orientation so
03:50 - we can move it up on the correct
03:53 - axis something like that looks pretty
03:55 - good uh I just want to make some room
03:58 - for the actual menu items up here so
04:01 - just have it kind of a uh just have the
04:04 - sky boox as a backdrop and then this to
04:08 - accompan the uh the main menu itself
04:11 - this looks pretty good and you will
04:13 - notice that we can still roll around
04:15 - with the ball which I think is a pretty
04:17 - fun little thing to be able to do in a
04:21 - menu now next up we are going to be
04:24 - using the unity so uh if you find
04:28 - anything to be difficult along the way
04:31 - here I suggest you go ahead and hit up
04:33 - uh the uh the guy specific videos that
04:37 - I've done lately um they should be quite
04:40 - a help so now we can right click in the
04:43 - hierarchy go under UI and let's just
04:45 - create a button and you can see that
04:48 - once we create this button three things
04:51 - are actually created a canvas which is
04:54 - uh kind of which represents the screen
04:59 - so the the total screen area that you
05:01 - have to uh you you've got to play with
05:04 - then we have a button which is the
05:06 - button and then an event system which is
05:09 - automatically created with any GUI this
05:12 - allows us to interact with the GUI
05:15 - system all of these are important so
05:18 - please don't delete any of them cool so
05:21 - what we want to do is we want to focus
05:23 - in on this canvas so go into 2D mode hit
05:27 - select the canvas and hit f and now we
05:30 - can zoom in so this is our screen we can
05:33 - select our button and maybe uh change
05:36 - the anchor so go up here on the the
05:37 - anchor presets and hit the top uh middle
05:41 - here that one so the flower looking
05:44 - anchor here is going to be moved to the
05:46 - center of the top and uh now let's scale
05:50 - this button up a bit so just drag in one
05:53 - of the corners hold down alt and hold
05:55 - down
05:56 - shift and then maybe just scale it a bit
05:59 - up here also uh that might be a bit too
06:04 - big let's just scale it down a bit again
06:07 - something like that now we can take our
06:10 - text here and uh we can go ahead and
06:13 - change the font size to something like
06:15 - 24 and we can change the text to play
06:20 - game and I'm just going to do this with
06:22 - capital letters that looks pretty cool
06:25 - now we can take our button and we can
06:27 - move it up and move it a bit to the left
06:31 - so just something like that looks pretty
06:35 - cool and uh yeah I'm actually pretty
06:38 - satisfied with that now we can go ahead
06:40 - and select the button and over here on
06:42 - the right hand side you can see that we
06:43 - have an image component and under the
06:46 - source image you can see that it has the
06:49 - uh default guey Sprite selected I'm just
06:52 - going to choose none instead because I
06:54 - don't want any of these Corners I don't
06:56 - really like the look of them uh and then
06:59 - I'm going to going to take the color and
07:00 - make it completely black but still keep
07:02 - the alpha value at something like
07:05 - 150 then we can go under the button
07:08 - select the text and let's just change
07:10 - the color here to completely white we
07:13 - could also go ahead and make this a bold
07:16 - text what you can also do is go under
07:18 - the canvas and select Pixel Perfect
07:22 - though uh I'm not going to be doing this
07:24 - here um for reasons I won't go into in
07:28 - this video
07:30 - so what we can do now is we can um we
07:33 - have this nice looking button let's just
07:35 - duplicate it to the other and move it to
07:38 - the other side here so we also have a
07:40 - quit game button let's select it hold
07:43 - down shift d oh it's control D I believe
07:47 - yeah command D if you're on a Mac now
07:49 - let's move it hold down shift while you
07:52 - move it to constrain it to one axis and
07:55 - you can move it over here but even
07:57 - better what we can do is we can simp
07:59 - simply remove the negative the minus
08:02 - here from our exp position and it
08:05 - will'll move it over and it even
08:08 - illustrates what we just changed you can
08:10 - see it says 144 here and it has this uh
08:15 - this line showing how we've moved it and
08:18 - that's because our position X Y and Z is
08:22 - always relative to our Anor which is up
08:26 - here so this is a
08:29 - 444 uh
08:31 - units from our
08:34 - origin to the anchor and that's
08:38 - completely correct now we can go under
08:40 - this button and we can change the text
08:42 - to quid
08:45 - game oops no space and that's basically
08:49 - it so now we have two cool looking
08:51 - buttons and you will notice that when we
08:54 - uh uh play the game and hover over them
08:56 - they will indeed animate which is pretty
09:00 - cool next thing we're going to do is
09:02 - we're going to create a slider with a
09:04 - label so let's go under the canvas let's
09:07 - right click hit UI and then uh let's do
09:13 - slider and uh let's go into the scene
09:16 - view again here let's again move the
09:18 - anger to the top uh middle here change
09:21 - the anger preset there now we can move
09:24 - up the slider something like there again
09:27 - holding down shift you only move on one
09:29 - axis now we can drag here while holding
09:33 - down alt to drag on both sides sides and
09:38 - uh just drag it over so it snaps nicely
09:41 - with the
09:42 - buttons then what we can do is we can
09:44 - make a little bit of room for our uh
09:48 - label so just move it in a bit there now
09:53 - let's go ahead and change uh the default
09:55 - value so go down here to value with the
09:58 - slide you selected and let's maybe do
10:01 - 0.6 or 7 for the default music um or
10:07 - let's actually make this maybe the
10:09 - general audio
10:11 - slider we could do that you could also
10:13 - make it the music H I don't know it's up
10:16 - to you uh but the default value is going
10:18 - to be
10:20 - 0.7 so what we can also do is we can
10:23 - change the appearance of this a bit so
10:25 - it looks a little nicer because I don't
10:27 - really like the look of it as it is
10:29 - right now so the image here is going to
10:32 - be the background image you can see that
10:34 - if I color it red this is what uh the
10:37 - element looks like and again I want to
10:40 - change this from the default background
10:42 - Sprite to just none to make it just a
10:44 - fill color and we can maybe go ahead and
10:47 - darken this quite a bit maybe even
10:50 - darken it as much as the buttons so
10:52 - again completely dark and then an alpha
10:55 - of
10:57 - 150 then we can go on to the slider and
10:59 - you can see we have the fill area which
11:01 - is the fill that illustrates how much uh
11:06 - that kind of illustrates the slider
11:09 - value that's what I meant to say and
11:11 - then we have the handle which is this
11:14 - little element right here so let's go
11:16 - under the fill and select the fill uh
11:20 - object now again let's just select none
11:23 - as the Sprite I think that looks nicer
11:27 - and maybe just tar in the white here a
11:30 - bit um also what I actually want to go
11:33 - ahead and do is I want to change the
11:35 - alpha to uh 255 which means it's
11:39 - completely visible and then go drag the
11:43 - uh the uh the color down a bit you could
11:45 - also go ahead and make this this an
11:47 - actual uh color if you would like it to
11:50 - have some kind of of style um I actually
11:53 - might go ahead and and just do that
11:56 - let's make it this kind of uh San
12:01 - color looks Al almost like futuristic
12:04 - and then maybe just a tad down with the
12:07 - alpha that actually looks pretty cool
12:10 - now we can go ahead and select the
12:11 - handle slide area and uh just open that
12:15 - up expand that select the handle and
12:18 - again um you can go ahead and select
12:21 - none here but the end uh the handle
12:24 - Sprite I actually like okay um so let's
12:27 - just change the color in that bump up
12:29 - the uh the alpha completely I don't like
12:32 - the way these elements show underneath
12:35 - just bump it up all the way and then
12:37 - change the uh the color to something you
12:41 - like maybe experiment with the colors
12:44 - here no I'm going to make that
12:46 - completely
12:47 - wide just maybe tone it down just a tad
12:51 - something like this I think looks pretty
12:53 - nice and you will notice now that again
12:56 - our slider is animated so when we have
12:58 - hover over it and click it it will um
13:02 - change accordingly and uh everything is
13:05 - actually working so the last thing that
13:08 - we are going to do is just put in the
13:11 - label so to do this uh right click on
13:13 - the canvas again go into UI and now
13:16 - select just
13:18 - text and uh let's make this let's Center
13:23 - this on the Y AIS by pressing here we
13:26 - can then change the text to let's say
13:28 - audio
13:30 - could put volume in here we could also
13:33 - just do
13:36 - volume I'm going to do
13:38 - audio and then uh just
13:41 - a um a colon and uh let's change the
13:46 - color here to maybe completely black uh
13:49 - just making it more visible yeah I think
13:51 - that's pretty good we could also try try
13:54 - just a a white that's not really visible
13:58 - enough
13:59 - we could go ahead and put uh some
14:01 - effects on this but uh that's for
14:03 - another video so let's just make this
14:05 - completely black and um maybe even scale
14:09 - it up a bit so let's change the font
14:11 - size to something like 17 that looks a
14:14 - lot better uh and now we can just
14:17 - position it so just go over here move it
14:19 - up again change the aner to the top
14:23 - middle just like all the other elements
14:26 - and let's scale it in here we're going
14:29 - to have to change the slider just a bit
14:31 - to make it fit uh something like this
14:35 - look actually looks pretty nice and
14:38 - there you have it so um maybe we can
14:41 - just move the slider
14:44 - over and there yeah I'm actually pretty
14:48 - satisfied with that so that it's it's
14:50 - actually that simple to create uh menus
14:53 - or or elements inside of the new
14:57 - Unity 4 .6 gooey system so that's
15:01 - basically it for today's video in the
15:04 - next Mega game video we're going to
15:06 - expand on this by making the buttons and
15:09 - the slider actually do something I just
15:12 - completely forgot to add the music for
15:15 - our main menu so in order to do this
15:17 - simply drag the music prefab that we've
15:20 - already created into the hierarchy and
15:23 - music will play when you play the scene
15:26 - we will have a look at making this music
15:28 - seamlessly transition onto the next
15:31 - level when we actually Implement uh the
15:34 - the button events so that will be for a
15:37 - future video so again thanks for
15:40 - watching I'm looking forward to seeing
15:42 - what series you would uh prefer to see
15:45 - and uh yeah thanks for watching I'll see
15:47 - you in the next
15:49 - [Music]
15:57 - video yeah
