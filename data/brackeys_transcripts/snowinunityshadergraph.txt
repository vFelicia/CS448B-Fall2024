00:00 - in this video we'll have a look at how
00:01 - to create a symbol snow shader in unity
00:03 - using shaded graph first we'll look at
00:05 - applying snow to a single object and
00:07 - then expand the shader to work well when
00:10 - applied to an entire environment and
00:12 - then you should have something that
00:13 - looks like this the assets that we're
00:15 - going to be using today are from the
00:16 - deficits Mayan temple pack they'll of
00:18 - course be a link to where you can get
00:19 - them in the description but before
00:21 - things get too cold this video is
00:23 - sponsored by XML layout XML layout is a
00:26 - really cool unity plugin that allows you
00:28 - to develop professional fully functional
00:30 - user interfaces and UI elements using
00:33 - XML it is awesome for very easily
00:35 - creating great UIs in a very smart and
00:37 - structured way it supports all standard
00:40 - unity UI elements as well as allowing
00:42 - you to add custom elements attributes
00:44 - and animations also it supports most
00:46 - platforms and is in general very well
00:48 - documented with a lot of examples which
00:51 - makes it very easy to get started with
00:53 - and of course XML in general is just
00:55 - very fun and easy to work with so before
00:57 - making the UI for your next game I
00:59 - definitely recommend you check out xml
01:00 - layout you can of course do so by
01:02 - clicking the link in the description
01:03 - alright put on your beanies and gloves
01:06 - and let's make some snow so first of all
01:08 - you want to make sure that you're using
01:09 - unity 2019 point 1.2 or later and that
01:13 - your project is set up to use the
01:15 - lightweight render pipeline however this
01:17 - effect should also work for HDR P so as
01:19 - you can see I have a very simple scene
01:21 - here with a skull pile object that is
01:25 - currently just using a default lit
01:27 - shader let's go ahead and change that by
01:29 - creating our own so let's go to the
01:31 - project hit create let's go shader let's
01:34 - go to PBR graph and let's create a snow
01:36 - shader let's double-click on the shader
01:39 - to open it up in shader graph now the
01:41 - first thing that we want to add to our
01:42 - shader is a texture because as most
01:45 - objects ossicles is of course using a
01:48 - base texture so let's go to a black
01:50 - board here let's add a new texture 2d
01:52 - and let's just call it our base map
01:55 - let's take this and drag it in and in
01:58 - order to hook this up to the albedo
02:00 - channel of our PBR master node we first
02:02 - need to connect it to a sample texture
02:05 - node which is going to convert it from a
02:07 - texture type to our TPA which we can
02:09 - then plug into our albedo as you can see
02:12 - not much happens in
02:13 - preview that's because we still need to
02:15 - choose a texture in fact let's go ahead
02:17 - and change from this default sphere here
02:19 - to a custom mesh and I'm just gonna
02:21 - search for our skull pile here this way
02:24 - we can see what everything looks like
02:26 - from within shader graph pretty cool so
02:29 - now I'm gonna go over here and choose a
02:31 - texture and a skull pile is part of a
02:33 - larger texture ant list but it is there
02:36 - even though it looks a bit confusing so
02:38 - I'm gonna select that one and as you can
02:40 - see our skulls
02:41 - now look much nicer I'm also just gonna
02:43 - set the smoothness to zero and that's
02:46 - pretty much it for our base setup of
02:47 - course encourage you to add properties
02:49 - for metallic smoothness normal Maps and
02:52 - so on to fit your needs but for now this
02:55 - should be fine so to create our snow
02:57 - effect we first need to understand what
02:59 - a normal vector is a normal vector is a
03:02 - vector that is perpendicular to the
03:04 - tangent plane of the surface at a
03:05 - certain point now this might sound
03:07 - really scary but it basically just means
03:10 - that it's a vector that points away from
03:12 - the surface so say we have a sphere
03:14 - where we only want to apply a snow to
03:17 - the top
03:18 - well this sphere has a bunch of normal
03:20 - vectors that all point away from the
03:22 - model that we can use to do this we
03:25 - first define a snow direction this is a
03:27 - vector that points in the direction we
03:29 - want our snow to come from in this case
03:31 - it's just pointing straight up we then
03:34 - use the dot product between the
03:35 - direction and the normal vector to
03:37 - figure out how much snow we should place
03:39 - on different parts of the object take
03:42 - for example the normal vector at the top
03:43 - of the model this is parallel with the
03:45 - direction vector and because the dot
03:47 - product of two parallel vectors is 1 we
03:51 - know that we should place lots of snow
03:53 - here in the case of the normal vector to
03:54 - the right however this is perpendicular
03:57 - to the direction vector and because the
03:59 - dot product of two perpendicular vectors
04:01 - is zero we know that we shouldn't place
04:04 - any snow here in fact all the normal
04:06 - vectors in between these two are going
04:08 - to give us values between zero and one
04:10 - based on how close they are to the
04:12 - direction vector which is exactly what
04:14 - we need now it's time to create some
04:17 - snow so let's go ahead and create a
04:18 - normal vector node again this is going
04:21 - to get the normal vectors which we can
04:24 - then dot together so we'll add it into a
04:26 - dot product
04:27 - node with the direction of our snow in
04:31 - my case I just wanted to fall from the
04:33 - top as snow normally does so I'm going
04:36 - to go ahead and create a vector3 over
04:38 - here in our blackboard I'm gonna call it
04:40 - snow direction I'm just gonna default
04:42 - the Y here to 1 I'm gonna drag it in and
04:45 - plug that into an Todd product node we
04:48 - then want to make sure that we are
04:50 - clamping our dot product so that it
04:52 - doesn't go below 0 or above 1 so let's
04:55 - drag that into a clamp node here to go
04:59 - between 0 and 1 and now this should make
05:01 - sure that our snow will only fall from
05:04 - the top
05:04 - however we of course still need to
05:06 - create our snow so let's just move this
05:09 - down and for a nice and simple snow
05:12 - effect let's use the simple noise node
05:15 - as you can see this creates a bunch of
05:18 - tiny grains which I think definitely
05:20 - looks like snow I'm just gonna set this
05:22 - to a hundred for now on this scale and
05:25 - I'm also going to plug it into a remap
05:27 - node and this is just going to allow me
05:30 - to change this from going from 0 to 1 to
05:33 - go from something like 0.5 to 1 just so
05:37 - that our snow doesn't get as dark as the
05:39 - default simple noise I think this looks
05:41 - quite a bit like snow and from here we
05:44 - can simply multiply it together with the
05:47 - result of our dot product calculation
05:50 - here and this should give us our snow
05:53 - layer which we can simply add on top of
05:55 - our default texture so if we just go
05:57 - ahead and move all this stuff over and
06:00 - do the same thing here we can simply
06:03 - drag down here into an add node and take
06:06 - the output of our snow and plug that in
06:09 - as well and then take the result of that
06:11 - into the albedo channel and voila
06:14 - right away you can see that we now have
06:16 - snow on our skull pile I'm gonna go
06:19 - ahead and increase the scale quite a bit
06:21 - here and as you can see we can now see
06:24 - the grains of the noise as well and if
06:27 - we try and save this asset and if we go
06:29 - back into unity we can find the material
06:32 - for our skull pile here as you can see
06:34 - it's just a simple litter with a base
06:37 - map input and that's pretty much it
06:39 - so let's just
06:41 - and change the shader here to shaded
06:43 - graphs snow and that might be a bit too
06:46 - much on this snow so let's go into our
06:49 - snow shader and it's at an opacity
06:52 - slider that will allow us to control the
06:54 - transparency of our snow so doing that
06:57 - is super simple we just want to take the
06:59 - output of our dot product calculation
07:01 - and multiplied so we'll drag in here and
07:04 - create a multiply node together with
07:07 - some kind of value so here we can
07:09 - control the intensity if I output this
07:12 - here you can see that we can now control
07:13 - the intensity of our snow and let's just
07:16 - create a value for this so that's create
07:18 - a vector one let's call it snow opacity
07:21 - and it's actually make this a slider
07:24 - that goes between zero and one and let's
07:26 - just default it to something like point
07:28 - five now let's take this and hook it up
07:31 - to a multiply node and that's pretty
07:33 - much all we needed to do I'm just gonna
07:35 - organize notes a bit here and now if we
07:37 - save this asset jump back into unity and
07:40 - like a skull pile we can now adjust the
07:43 - opacity of our snow which I think looks
07:46 - really cool in fact we can also adjust
07:48 - this no direction in any way that we'd
07:50 - like if we want it to come from the side
07:52 - here I think that definitely gives a
07:54 - pretty cool look in fact we can even go
07:56 - ahead and increase these direction
07:58 - values above one to give another look
08:00 - you can see that it gives us more snow
08:03 - and it also hardens up the edge from the
08:06 - snow so you can definitely adjust that
08:08 - to your liking and that's pretty much
08:09 - how you can get snow working really
08:11 - really simply on a prairie object basis
08:14 - however one thing that is really cool is
08:17 - that we can modify this shader to really
08:19 - easily be a pliable on an entire
08:22 - environment of course if you have a
08:24 - bunch of single objects like this one
08:26 - you could go ahead and change the shader
08:29 - for each and every one of them however
08:31 - it for something like the Mayan temple
08:33 - pack we have a huge amount of objects in
08:36 - here now in this case they only use a
08:38 - few materials because a lot of them are
08:41 - packed into the same texture atlas and
08:43 - so they can share the same material
08:45 - however you could have hundreds if not
08:47 - thousands of materials here so it would
08:50 - be really annoying to go in and having
08:52 - to adjust a bunch of settings for each
08:54 - one
08:54 - having to go into the shady here and
08:56 - create a parameter for the scale of the
08:58 - symbol noise because that's going to
09:00 - depend on the UV maps of your object and
09:03 - so on so let's go ahead and add a bit on
09:05 - to the shader in order for the snow to
09:07 - be relative to our word position instead
09:10 - of the UVs of our object so to do this
09:13 - we of course want to start with a
09:15 - position node in fact we want to start
09:17 - with our vertices position in world
09:19 - space we can then take this position and
09:21 - split it up into its different
09:24 - coordinates so we have the X the Y and
09:26 - the Z and we just want to focus on the X
09:29 - and the Z here because if we have a look
09:32 - in unity we want us node to be falling
09:34 - from the top so if we want to overlay a
09:37 - huge snow texture that is shared by all
09:40 - of the objects we want to do it from a
09:43 - top-down view in other words we want to
09:45 - create a UV plane that uses our X and
09:48 - our Z and completely ignore our Y so
09:52 - let's go ahead and take our X here let's
09:54 - plug it into a vector tube and we'll
09:57 - also take our Z and plug that into the
10:00 - other part of our vector - and this is
10:02 - now our UVs so from here we can go into
10:05 - our symbol noise and by now we probably
10:08 - want to reduce the scale of this a bit
10:10 - because that scale is pretty crazy let's
10:12 - do something like 500 and as you can see
10:14 - it doesn't change much in our preview
10:17 - but our snow is now relative to a world
10:20 - position instead of the UVs of our
10:22 - object and if we save this and go into
10:25 - unity and select some of the materials
10:27 - that are making up our environment here
10:29 - I'm gonna select all the ones that are
10:31 - non transparent we'll talk about
10:33 - transparency in a bit then for this
10:35 - shader that's changed this two shaded
10:37 - graphs snow and as you can see right
10:40 - away we have a snowy level that
10:42 - definitely thinks that we can do to make
10:44 - this look better but we're pretty much
10:46 - halfway there we have snow on all of the
10:49 - surfaces pointing up in fact we have
10:51 - that on all of the tiny services and
10:54 - something like the wall here as well and
10:56 - we have this coal grain overlay that is
10:59 - shared by all of the objects so I think
11:02 - overall that is looking pretty great
11:04 - already
11:04 - you can adjust stuff like the opacity or
11:07 - thus no direction but I'm actually
11:09 - pretty happy with it
11:10 - as is however one thing that is a bit
11:13 - unrealistic with the way that our snow
11:15 - is set up right now is the fact that
11:17 - everything is covered equally in the
11:20 - snow and that doesn't really happen snow
11:23 - gets thrown around by wind and just as a
11:26 - rule of thumb whenever you're working
11:27 - with something organic that Nature has
11:30 - created the eye expects to see some
11:32 - variance so let's go ahead and make sure
11:34 - that our snow isn't distributed
11:37 - completely equally in fact we can do
11:39 - this really easily by going into our
11:42 - snow shader and instead of just
11:44 - overlaying a simple noise let's go ahead
11:46 - and create another noise function here
11:49 - we'll use a gradient noise and this one
11:51 - we want to scale down quite a lot I'm
11:54 - gonna scale it down to something like
11:55 - 0.5 I'm gonna use these same UVs for
11:58 - this because we want it to be overlaid
12:00 - in the same way and I'm then going to
12:02 - take the output of this and multiply
12:03 - together with the result of our snow so
12:06 - instead of just going directly down to a
12:08 - multiply node here let's go ahead and
12:11 - move this thing out a bit let's plug
12:13 - this into a multiply node and multiply
12:16 - that together with the result of our
12:18 - symbol noise and then take the result of
12:20 - that into our multiply node down here
12:23 - and what this should do this won't
12:25 - really be visible in the preview but
12:27 - what this should do if we save this
12:29 - asset and go into unity is based on this
12:32 - gradient noise create areas that are
12:34 - more snowy than others and I think right
12:37 - away that gives a much more realistic
12:38 - look
12:39 - I think this effect is a bit too
12:41 - exaggerated at the moment and you can
12:43 - definitely try and play around with the
12:45 - scale of the gradient noise to make this
12:47 - more refined but if we just go ahead and
12:49 - plug this right through a remap node
12:52 - just in order to control how much of an
12:55 - impact this effect has so let's change
12:57 - it from going from 0 to 1 to go to
12:59 - something like 0.3 to 1 and plug that
13:03 - into our multiply and maybe change the
13:06 - scale to something like point 3 if we
13:08 - then say that asset and go back into
13:11 - unity I think we have a really nice
13:13 - looking organic snow effect super super
13:16 - cool one thing that I also want to do is
13:19 - make sure that if we go out and change
13:21 - or snow direction here say we make it
13:23 - come kinda from the side that completely
13:26 - vertical faces aren't affected we still
13:29 - want to be able to kind of control the
13:31 - direction of our snow but because of the
13:33 - way that we've set up our snow this
13:34 - doesn't look very good in fact that's
13:37 - created so that the more angle as
13:38 - surface has the less it's affected by
13:41 - snow that should give a fairly realistic
13:43 - look so to do this let's just head back
13:46 - into shader graph and now with a new
13:48 - knowledge of the dot product you can in
13:50 - fact just go from the normal vector into
13:53 - a dot product and we want to dot this
13:56 - with a vector going straight up so zero
13:58 - one zero and we can just use that to
14:01 - multiply together with our snow so let's
14:04 - just go ahead and multiply that I'm just
14:07 - gonna collapse these with the output of
14:09 - our snow and take the result of that and
14:11 - multiply it with our other dot product
14:14 - here and that should now result if we
14:17 - save this asset in an effect where the
14:20 - more of an angle the surface has the
14:22 - less its affected by snow and as you can
14:24 - see the vertical faces here are
14:26 - completely unaffected really really cool
14:29 - now I'm just gonna go in here and set
14:31 - this no Direction back in this case I
14:33 - just wanted to come from the top but now
14:35 - this should be safe and they're pretty
14:37 - good no matter what you want to do with
14:39 - this no direction and that's pretty much
14:41 - it for this effect here's the graph in
14:43 - it's entirely again I definitely
14:45 - encourage you to add stuff for normal
14:47 - Maps metallic Ness smoothness and all
14:49 - that stuff and of course one thing that
14:51 - this shaded currently doesn't support is
14:54 - transparent surfaces but if you want to
14:56 - create a variant on the shader that
14:58 - supports that all we need to do is
15:00 - simply duplicate it call this one snow
15:02 - transparent double click it and in our
15:05 - PBR master node we want to change the
15:07 - surface type to transparent I mean then
15:10 - simply take the Alpha of our sample
15:12 - texture node and plug that into the
15:14 - Alpha of our PBR master if we save that
15:17 - go into unity and select this material
15:20 - here this is for the trees and all the
15:22 - different kinds of foliage that are
15:24 - using transparent surfaces we then
15:26 - change this over to our shader graphs no
15:29 - transparent for the base map here I'm
15:32 - going to change to the
15:34 - correct one and as you can see we now
15:36 - have snow on the leaves of the tree here
15:39 - and transparency is working just fine so
15:42 - it's actually that easy really cool of
15:46 - course I also encourage you to change
15:48 - around some settings for your
15:49 - environment in order to make it look
15:51 - more snow like in my case yeah I'm gonna
15:53 - go to the main camera and make the
15:55 - background brighter that definitely
15:57 - seems more like a snow landscape I'm
15:59 - also going to go to lighting and just
16:01 - bump up the ambient intensity and there
16:04 - are of course a million different tricks
16:05 - like this that you can do to make your
16:07 - environment feel more like a winter
16:08 - scene but I think for just a single
16:11 - shader this is a really cool and easy to
16:14 - use effect and I really like the fact
16:15 - that we now just have a slider for no
16:18 - snow and lots of snow yay that's pretty
