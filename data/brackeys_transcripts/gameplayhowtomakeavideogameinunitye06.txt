00:00 - in this video we're going to be making
00:01 - some actual gameplay this what it should
00:03 - look like when we're done awesome so
00:05 - let's get started so what we're going to
00:07 - be doing here is pretty much creating a
00:08 - level by hand using a bunch of prefabs
00:11 - this allows us to really easily create
00:12 - interesting levels and fune each part of
00:15 - the level to a good difficulty setting
00:16 - the problem with this manual approach is
00:18 - that you cannot have infinite levels
00:20 - you're going to have a start and an end
00:22 - point if you want to create never ending
00:23 - levels I really suggest you watch my
00:25 - live stream on creating a Dodge the
00:27 - blocks type game in that video we
00:28 - randomly spawn obstacles from a few
00:30 - spawn points however making things
00:32 - procedural is a bit more difficult it
00:34 - does require some coding and unless
00:35 - you're very skilled with it it leaves
00:37 - you with very little customization when
00:39 - it comes to creating more deep and
00:40 - interesting levels anyway let's take our
00:42 - obstacle and drag it into our project
00:44 - what we just did was create a prefab of
00:47 - that obstacle prefabs are used whenever
00:49 - you want to have multiple objects of the
00:50 - same type in our case we want to have a
00:52 - lot of different obstacles in our scene
00:54 - what we can now do is take this prefab
00:56 - from the project and drag it in anywhere
00:58 - into our scene the cool thing is that if
00:59 - we now go to our obstacle and change a
01:01 - setting say the size on the x-axis you
01:04 - can see it updating on all of the
01:06 - objects at once I'm just going to undo
01:07 - that we can also edit one of these
01:09 - objects individually say select the
01:11 - first object here and change the mass we
01:13 - can then go up here and hit apply and it
01:15 - should now be applied to all the other
01:17 - prefabs and we can see indeed the mass
01:19 - has changed on those as well remember to
01:21 - always hit apply whenever you've changed
01:23 - something on the prefab that you want to
01:24 - be applied to the others again I'm going
01:26 - to put that back to two and hit apply
01:28 - the first thing that we need to do is
01:29 - extend our ground plane currently we can
01:31 - go for a little bit and then we're going
01:33 - to fall off of course there are ways of
01:35 - making our ground plane follow the
01:37 - position of our player one common thing
01:39 - to do when creating endless Runners is
01:41 - not actually move the player but instead
01:42 - move all of the obstacles and
01:44 - environment pieces closer to the player
01:46 - as the game progresses this way we can
01:47 - actually just have a stationary ground
01:49 - element but in our case we want to have
01:51 - some cool physics and that looks much
01:53 - better if we move the actual player so I
01:55 - think the solution here is as simple as
01:56 - just scaling up the ground let's take
01:58 - the ground give it a scale on the Z of
02:00 - say 10,000 let's also move it over on
02:02 - the Z let's set that to
02:05 - 4,980 that should make sure it begins in
02:07 - about the same place as our player now
02:09 - of course we can begin sketching out our
02:10 - level there are a few things we can do
02:12 - to make that easier for us the first one
02:14 - is getting the right view in the scene
02:16 - view notice how we have different axes
02:18 - up here we can actually click on those
02:20 - to shift A View to that axis so let's
02:22 - click on the Y we currently in
02:24 - perspective view if we click on the
02:26 - center Cube we can switch to isometric
02:28 - this flattens our en High scene and
02:30 - allows us to set up our level in kind of
02:32 - a 2d view you can also go up here and
02:34 - disable stuff like Skybox fog and flares
02:37 - you can Tuggle all of those on and off
02:39 - by simply clicking the environment here
02:40 - so I'm going to Tuggle those off the
02:42 - grid I'm actually going to leave in here
02:44 - but if you go on the gizmos you can
02:45 - disable that as well we can also take
02:47 - our ground go up to layer hit add layer
02:49 - and we can add a new layer called
02:50 - something like ground or environment we
02:53 - can then take our ground plane and
02:55 - assign that layer now if we go up to the
02:57 - layers toggle we can hit the lock next
02:59 - to the en environment this now means
03:00 - that if we deselect our ground we can't
03:03 - actually select it within our scene we
03:04 - can still select it in the hierarchy of
03:06 - course but it makes it so much easier to
03:08 - select the objects we want in our scene
03:10 - so now we can delete our two obstacles
03:11 - here take the first one and kind of move
03:13 - it forward a bit if we drag on the green
03:15 - square here it allows us to move it only
03:17 - in the x and z position you can of
03:19 - course go ahead and move these in
03:20 - freehand but I prefer doing things on a
03:22 - grid we can go edit snap settings to
03:25 - configure how objects snap to the grid
03:26 - I'm going to put two on the X two on the
03:28 - Y and two on the Z and just leave scale
03:31 - and rotation as is we can just close
03:32 - this now and that means that if we now
03:34 - move this object and hold down control
03:36 - it's going to snap to every two units
03:39 - all right so let's begin with this in
03:40 - the center and then press contrl D or
03:42 - command D if you're on the Mac to
03:43 - duplicate the object and move it over
03:45 - while holding down control and you can
03:47 - just repeat this process to create an
03:48 - interesting
03:49 - [Music]
03:56 - level all right so you can see I've
03:58 - created a tiny bit of gameplay elements
04:00 - here of course I did this very quickly
04:02 - and I'm not always the most creative
04:03 - when it comes to level design but you
04:05 - get just how easy it is to place
04:06 - obstacles into our scene you should of
04:08 - course pump this up with a bunch of
04:10 - different kind of objects you can put
04:11 - collectible coins in here obstacles that
04:13 - move back and forth stuff to jump over
04:15 - or go beneath there's plenty of
04:17 - opportunity and the best thing about it
04:18 - is just how easily we can play test it
04:20 - let's try and hit play and see how
04:22 - difficult this level is the first thing
04:23 - that I'm noticing is that my controls
04:25 - feel really really slow now that's not
04:27 - really a problem with the level that's
04:29 - more a problem problem with our movement
04:30 - script so let's see what we can do to
04:32 - edit that let's select our player and
04:33 - double click on our player movement now
04:36 - currently in order to move our player
04:37 - forward we're adding a force and I think
04:39 - that works fine but when moving to the
04:41 - right and to the left it feels very
04:43 - non-responsive that's because when
04:45 - adding a force to an object over time it
04:47 - slowly builds up momentum and when we
04:49 - then change direction we have to wait
04:50 - for the object to build up enough Force
04:52 - to do so and this is where Force modes
04:54 - come in unity actually allows us to
04:56 - specify in which way we should add a
04:57 - force and we do that as a fourth
04:59 - parameter first we have the force on the
05:01 - X then we have the force on the Y then
05:03 - on the Z and finally we have the Force
05:05 - mode so let's put a comma here and let's
05:07 - input force mode dot we can go through
05:09 - and read about what the different forces
05:11 - do the standard one is force which adds
05:13 - a continuous Force to the rigid body
05:15 - using its mass the one that we want is
05:17 - velocity change this directly edits the
05:19 - velocity of the object and it completely
05:21 - ignores its mass so make sure to add
05:23 - this to both of the add Force statements
05:26 - let's now save and head back into unity
05:28 - and I know by experience that when using
05:30 - velocity change we need much molder
05:32 - numbers I think something around 100
05:34 - should be fine so if we now hit play we
05:35 - can try that out it already feels much
05:37 - more responsive but I think it could be
05:39 - better one thing we can do to make the
05:41 - movement feel more Snappy is up the drag
05:43 - drag is basically air resistance so the
05:45 - higher the drag the more quickly our
05:47 - object is going to be stopped by air
05:49 - that also means that we need to amp up
05:51 - our forces in order to move at the same
05:52 - speed but it should make everything feel
05:54 - more responsive because the object is
05:56 - quicker to slow down so let's op the
05:58 - drag to something like one let's leave
05:59 - the same sideway Force let's actually
06:01 - put our forward Force up quite a bit
06:03 - let's try it out at 4,000 if we now hit
06:06 - play Everything feels so much better I
06:08 - think this is a good forward force and I
06:10 - think our controls feel really fluent by
06:12 - the way a cool shortcut is that you can
06:14 - play the game by hitting control P or
06:16 - command P if you're on the Mac so the
06:17 - level already feels pretty fun however
06:19 - it's not too hard to see that this
06:21 - particular part is a bit too difficult
06:22 - so let's just go in here and maybe add a
06:24 - tiny bit more distance between the first
06:26 - obstacle and the next one and we'll do
06:28 - the same thing with these let's try it
06:30 - out again much better the final thing
06:32 - that I wanted to add in this video is
06:34 - fog currently we can see all the objects
06:36 - no matter how far away they are that's
06:38 - not too pretty and it also makes the
06:40 - game feel a lot less interesting the
06:41 - neat thing about this game is that it
06:43 - feels like the obstacles are coming out
06:44 - of nothing and you never know what to
06:46 - expect well we know but the player
06:48 - shouldn't so let's go on do window and
06:50 - select lighting we can then take our
06:51 - lighting panel and dark it over here by
06:53 - the inspector and maybe give it a bit
06:55 - more space there are a bunch of settings
06:57 - here to play around with stuff like the
06:59 - intens of our ambient light how to
07:01 - calculate shadows and Reflections and
07:03 - finally we have the fog let's go ahead
07:05 - and enable that let's also expand it
07:07 - this allows us to set a color of our fog
07:09 - you can choose pretty much any color
07:11 - you'd like and definitely get
07:12 - interesting with this but I'm just going
07:14 - to go ahead and use the Color Picker to
07:15 - get the color of our background that
07:17 - makes it feel like everything is
07:18 - splending in Towards the Sky we then up
07:20 - the density a bit I'm going to set it to
07:22 - something like 02 so now if we maximize
07:25 - our game view by hitting shift space
07:27 - press play we can see that our game
07:29 - actually starts to feel like a game the
07:31 - level is currently really short though
07:33 - so I definitely recommend creating
07:35 - something a bit larger and again you
07:36 - have most of the stuff in place here to
07:38 - create procedure levels don't be scared
07:40 - to experiment that was pretty much it
