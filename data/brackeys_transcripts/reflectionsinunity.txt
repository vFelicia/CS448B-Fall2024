00:00 - in this video we'll have a look at
00:01 - adding reflections in unity will be
00:06 - using reflection probes and screen
00:07 - spaced reflection to achieve the effect
00:09 - the environment that I'm using is called
00:10 - corridor and you can download it for
00:12 - free off the asset store also special
00:14 - thanks to dine guy in Diego Judah
00:17 - men are Minoru see you're right Omer
00:19 - passio infinity PPR and hence have tuned
00:21 - for their support on patreon alright
00:23 - let's get started so here's our scene
00:25 - and as you can see it's a pretty cool
00:27 - corridor sci-fi level we have a bunch of
00:30 - lights and materials but everything
00:32 - looks very dark the reason why is that
00:35 - this scene is very reliant on
00:37 - reflections and since we don't have any
00:39 - reflections in here all those parts
00:41 - simply stay black we can see this if we
00:44 - right-click in the hierarchy and create
00:45 - a 3d object and go and select sphere now
00:48 - we want to reset the position of a
00:50 - sphere so that's right click and hit
00:52 - reset and it should reset to the origin
00:54 - here let's hold down ctrl and drag it to
00:57 - the center of our level that's it F to
00:59 - focus on it and I'm just gonna place it
01:00 - somewhere around here and maybe also
01:03 - size it up a bit so now we have this
01:05 - large sphere in the middle of our level
01:07 - and currently it just uses the default
01:08 - material if we wanted to put a
01:10 - reflective material on here let's
01:12 - right-click in the project go create
01:14 - select material and it's called it shiny
01:17 - let's then select our sphere and drag
01:19 - shiny on to it so now you can see we
01:21 - have a standard material with standard
01:24 - settings the first thing that we want to
01:25 - do is increase the metallic to one this
01:28 - will make it completely reflective in
01:31 - general the more metallic and material
01:33 - is the more it will reflect its
01:34 - surroundings we also have another
01:36 - parameter here that controls our
01:38 - reflection that's the material
01:39 - smoothness which is of course how smooth
01:42 - the surface is we can imagine that the
01:44 - smoother a surfaces the sharper the
01:47 - reflections will look in other words if
01:49 - we decrease the smoothness we have
01:51 - blurring out our reflection so in our
01:53 - case we'll set that to 1 so we can see
01:54 - our reflections as clearly as possible
01:56 - and as you can see a sphere is
01:59 - completely black we don't have any
02:01 - reflections so to set up reflections for
02:03 - a scene let's start by creating
02:04 - reflection probes a reflection probe is
02:07 - like a camera that captures a spherical
02:10 - view of its surroundings unity then
02:12 - takes this image and store
02:13 - I said in a cube map this means that it
02:16 - splits up the environment into six
02:18 - textures one for each direction then
02:20 - unity can simply overlay the cube map on
02:22 - top of nearby objects in order to create
02:25 - reflection the credit reflection probe
02:27 - will go to the hierarchy right click go
02:29 - light reflection probe and right away
02:31 - you can see our scene lights up it's
02:34 - currently lighting up in a very blue
02:36 - color and it's not even certain that
02:37 - something is going to happen in your
02:39 - case so let's make sure to go through
02:41 - all the settings to set them up
02:42 - correctly the first thing that I want to
02:44 - do is position our reflection probe to
02:46 - be kind of in the center of this main
02:48 - corridor in fact I just want to go ahead
02:50 - and place it right inside of our sphere
02:52 - so let's select a sphere right click on
02:55 - the transform and hit copy component
02:56 - then let's click on the reflection probe
02:58 - right click on the transform and hit
03:00 - paste component values so now it snaps
03:02 - right inside of a sphere the next thing
03:05 - that we want to set up is the bounding
03:06 - volume that's this big box right here
03:09 - this determines what objects are
03:11 - included in the reflection so all
03:13 - objects that are within this box are
03:15 - both going to be reflected upon as well
03:18 - as reflect onto other objects so what we
03:20 - want to do here is make sure to include
03:22 - all the objects that we would like to do
03:24 - this will edit the volume that's the
03:26 - button up here and now we can simply
03:28 - click and drag on the sides here I'm
03:30 - holding down Auto scale on both axes and
03:32 - I'm just gonna extend it out a tiny bit
03:34 - as well as extended out in the depth
03:37 - you'll notice as you resize your
03:39 - bounding volume you can actually see
03:41 - different parts of your level get
03:42 - affected once you're satisfied we're
03:44 - just gonna go out of volume edit mode
03:46 - and now everything looks good in here
03:48 - however of course we want to have actual
03:51 - reflections we don't just want to color
03:53 - things blue the reason why is if we
03:55 - click on our reflection probe you can
03:57 - see it's currently completely blue down
04:00 - here so it's not really gathering any
04:02 - reflections that's because by default
04:04 - reflection probes are baked you can see
04:07 - that up here the type is currently set
04:08 - to baked this means that the cube map
04:10 - for this probe is calculated even before
04:13 - we start the game this is much much
04:15 - better for performance since when we're
04:17 - running the game we don't actually have
04:18 - to generate any textures but it also
04:21 - means that we can only include objects
04:22 - in our reflection that are static so
04:25 - that we're sure they want
04:26 - move so if I go in the environment here
04:28 - and select all of the objects in my
04:31 - environment this doesn't include stuff
04:32 - like collision particles and lighting
04:34 - but it does include every single object
04:36 - I have in here so we want to mark this
04:39 - entire environment as static and of
04:41 - course we could go to the right here and
04:43 - just select static but then we would
04:45 - also start calculating static lighting
04:47 - and all that stuff instead we can use
04:50 - the drop down here to be more specific
04:51 - and only mark them static for
04:54 - reflections will hit yes change children
04:56 - and if we now go window lighting and
04:59 - then settings at the bottom here where
05:01 - it says auto-generate will disable that
05:04 - and instead we want to use the drop down
05:06 - arrow to select Bakke reflection probes
05:08 - and voila we now have reflections inside
05:11 - of a level and you will notice
05:12 - immediately that this looks way better
05:15 - than before all of the blue parts are
05:17 - now reflecting parts of the environment
05:19 - and our sphere is now completely shiny
05:22 - we can also now select the material for
05:25 - sphere go under the inspector and you
05:27 - can now clearly see how the metallic
05:29 - Ness is how much we want to reflect and
05:31 - the smoothness is the blurriness of the
05:34 - reflection also notice how our sphere is
05:36 - actually reflecting the environment but
05:39 - we didn't mark it as static the reason
05:42 - why is that we can still see reflection
05:43 - on non static objects but they won't be
05:46 - part of it and if we go into our
05:47 - reflection propia you can see that we
05:49 - can't actually see the sphere anywhere
05:51 - you can also see that we have a bunch of
05:53 - settings that we can configure most
05:55 - notably we can configure capture
05:57 - settings for our cube map this is stuff
05:59 - like resolution if we go in here and
06:01 - change it to something like 32 and then
06:04 - hit the back button we can clearly see
06:06 - that the quality of the cube map gets
06:08 - reduced so let's bump that right back up
06:10 - to 128 we can also choose whether we
06:13 - want to have high dynamic range the
06:15 - shadow distance and we can even select a
06:17 - custom background color because you
06:19 - actually don't have to use the same one
06:21 - that your camera uses one of the options
06:23 - that I use the most is the culling mask
06:25 - this allows you to disable different
06:27 - layers that you don't want to include in
06:29 - your reflection so say we wanted to make
06:31 - sure that our sphere was never included
06:33 - in the reflection we could simply go and
06:35 - create a new layer for it we could call
06:37 - it ignore reflection
06:39 - select the sphere and make sure to add
06:42 - it to that layer then when we select the
06:44 - reflection probe on the culling mask we
06:46 - can simply disable that layer and now it
06:49 - will completely ignored even if we mark
06:51 - it as static so that's really cool but
06:54 - all these reflections are baked what if
06:56 - we wanted to show reflections in real
06:59 - time say we had moving objects well
07:02 - let's try and create a test case for
07:04 - this let's go to a hierarchy right-click
07:06 - go 3d object and select cube let's move
07:09 - over this cube as you can see it's not
07:11 - currently showing inside of our sphere
07:13 - let's make it easier to see by right
07:15 - clicking in the project go create
07:17 - material let's create a red material
07:20 - will change the albedo to a solid red
07:22 - and let's drag the material on to our
07:24 - cube still we're not able to see it the
07:27 - reason why is that the cube is not
07:29 - included in our cube map to include it
07:31 - we would have to mark it as static as
07:33 - was going to the reflection probe and
07:35 - hit bake and now it's clearly there but
07:39 - as soon as I go ahead and move the cube
07:40 - while the reflection stays where it is
07:43 - so instead we want to select the
07:45 - reflection cube and change the type from
07:47 - baked to real-time if your reflection
07:50 - suddenly look really weird that's
07:51 - because you need to go to lighting and
07:53 - re-enable Auto generate because we have
07:55 - to get rid of the old reflections that
07:57 - were calculated there we go
07:59 - so now that our reflection probe is set
08:00 - to real-time we should be able to select
08:02 - our cube and disable it from static and
08:05 - it will still show up in the reflection
08:07 - probe we can also go ahead and move it
08:09 - down but it won't actually update the
08:12 - reason why is that the Refresh mode on
08:14 - our reflection probe is currently set to
08:16 - on awake and so it will actually only
08:18 - update once you start the game so if we
08:20 - go out and hit play we can see that the
08:22 - reflection updates but only in the
08:24 - beginning to change this will just
08:26 - change the refresh mode from on awake to
08:29 - every frame and you can see now the
08:31 - reflection nicely follows our cube
08:33 - around we can also change the smoothness
08:35 - of this reflection you might not be able
08:37 - to see it but it is a tiny bit laggy to
08:40 - get rid of this we can change the time
08:42 - slicing from all phases at once which
08:44 - runs over nine frames to no time slicing
08:47 - and there we go the reflection is now
08:49 - completely smooth remember these
08:52 - settings definitely also have a
08:53 - impact on performance so most of the
08:55 - time I'd recommend simply selecting the
08:57 - default option here so I'm gonna exit
08:59 - out of play mode select the reflection
09:01 - probe and change it back to baked I'll
09:04 - select the cube again and change it back
09:06 - to static and I'm also going to move it
09:08 - over here closer to the center of our
09:10 - probe and what you notice is that
09:12 - suddenly our entire environment turns
09:15 - kind of red
09:17 - that's because a huge part of the
09:19 - reflection in our probe is currently a
09:21 - cue because the cube is very very close
09:23 - by now one of the ways to make this
09:26 - better is by using multiple reflection
09:28 - probes to do that we'll simply go into
09:30 - our scene we'll select our reflection
09:32 - probe
09:33 - we'll go and modify the volume and we'll
09:35 - make this way smaller we then go out of
09:38 - any mode hit control D which will
09:40 - duplicate the reflection probe hold down
09:43 - control and move it over we'll duplicate
09:45 - it again and move it over again and you
09:47 - can see this gets rid of the red over in
09:50 - the side corridors because they are now
09:52 - using separate reflection probes that
09:54 - aren't affected by the cube but of
09:57 - course inside of our main corridor
09:58 - things are still very red and this is
10:01 - just one of those things that you'll
10:02 - have to live with when approximating
10:04 - reflections using probes right for one
10:07 - like to get rid of this cube right here
10:09 - it doesn't really add anything to the
10:11 - scene but one effect that can really
10:13 - help add realistic reflections to your
10:15 - game is screen space reflection unlike
10:18 - reflection probes screen space
10:20 - reflection is always calculated on the
10:22 - fly as an image effect it's commonly
10:25 - used to create more subtle reflections
10:27 - such as on a shiny floor or in puddles
10:30 - the good thing about SSR is that objects
10:32 - will line up with their reflections
10:34 - which often doesn't happen with probes
10:36 - now screen space reflection is of course
10:39 - a post-processing effect and that means
10:41 - that we need to download the
10:42 - post-processing stack from the asset
10:44 - store in order to use it now I have an
10:47 - entire video on using the
10:48 - post-processing stack including this
10:51 - effect that I definitely suggest you
10:52 - check out but I just wanted to show you
10:54 - how nice this effect can be so I've
10:57 - downloaded the post-processing stack and
10:58 - I've gone to the main camera and added a
11:00 - post-processing behavior and I've
11:02 - created a post-processing profile as
11:04 - well if I select this we can see all the
11:07 - nine
11:07 - affect that I'm currently applying to my
11:09 - camera and here at the top we have
11:11 - screen space reflection if I go ahead
11:13 - and enable this you can see right away
11:15 - it makes a huge difference we can see
11:18 - lights reflecting on to the floor
11:20 - surface we can see the sphere reflecting
11:22 - on to the floor we can see lights
11:24 - reflecting on to the walls and walls
11:26 - reflecting on to the walls it really
11:28 - adds a lot of depth and realism to the
11:31 - scene if we open it up you can also see
11:33 - we have a bunch of different settings
11:34 - that we can tweak here right away it's
11:36 - going to say that this effect only works
11:38 - with the deferred rendering path so if
11:40 - you're not seeing any reflections you'll
11:42 - probably want to go to your main camera
11:44 - go on the rendering path and change this
11:46 - to deferred the main setting here is
11:48 - probably the reflection quality you will
11:51 - get much much nicer reflections if you
11:53 - change this to high but do know that
11:55 - this effect can be pretty
11:56 - computationally expensive so you'll have
11:59 - to experiment with this for your own
12:00 - game then we have a bunch of different
12:02 - settings for the reflection if you want
12:04 - to know what all these properties do I
12:06 - would recommend looking at the unity
12:08 - manual and of course checking out my
12:10 - video on post-processing but I think
12:12 - it's safe to say that our environment
12:13 - now looks much much better awesome
