00:00 - in this video we're going to have a look
00:01 - at how to create a cool main menu inside
00:03 - of unity at the end it should look
00:04 - something like this
00:06 - special thanks to hansoftoon duderman
00:08 - and armando rusi for their support on
00:10 - patreon and now
00:11 - let's make a menu so i currently have
00:12 - two scenes a menu one which is
00:14 - completely empty and a game one
00:16 - just pretend that you're seeing a game
00:18 - here
00:20 - now inside of our menu scene let's begin
00:22 - by creating the ui
00:23 - let's right click in our hierarchy go ui
00:26 - and select
00:27 - panel this will create a canvas and
00:29 - inside of this canvas it will create a
00:31 - panel now i want to go under image
00:33 - and replace the source image i've
00:35 - imported my own background image here
00:37 - that we can drag in
00:38 - you can choose to use any sprite here
00:40 - just make sure that when you select it
00:42 - under texture type it's set to sprite 2d
00:44 - and ui then under our panel let's go to
00:47 - color and let's amp up the alpha channel
00:49 - so now we have a nice backdrop for our
00:51 - menu
00:52 - let's rename it to background and at
00:54 - this point we're ready to add some text
00:56 - let's right click on our canvas go ui
00:59 - select text
01:00 - and of course we could just use unity's
01:02 - default text here we could scale it up
01:04 - center it change the font size change
01:07 - the color
01:08 - but that's about the control that we
01:10 - have if you want to change the font we
01:11 - need to import some custom fonts
01:13 - we can't add nice looking shadows or
01:15 - gradients and for most menus that i've
01:17 - created i definitely want to have these
01:19 - options so instead let's delete this
01:21 - text object and let's import a free
01:23 - package called
01:24 - text mesh pro so let's go to the asset
01:26 - store search for
01:27 - text mesh pro i'll of course have a link
01:29 - for this in the description let's select
01:31 - the pack here
01:32 - this pack was recently acquired by unity
01:34 - and i've created a separate video on how
01:36 - to use it
01:37 - so if you find something confusing along
01:38 - the way definitely check that out for
01:40 - now we can just hit download or
01:42 - import and we'll hit import again and
01:44 - after it's done you should see a folder
01:46 - in your project panel called text mesh
01:48 - pro now we can go back to our scene view
01:49 - we can right click on our canvas go ui
01:52 - and you should now see
01:53 - an option here called text mesh pro text
01:55 - and right off the bat we can see that
01:57 - the text renders
01:58 - a lot more clearly let's go into the
02:01 - font size here
02:02 - and let's change it to something like
02:04 - 84. let's also give our text some room
02:06 - i'll hold down alt to scale from the
02:08 - center let's make sure to align our text
02:10 - to the center both horizontally
02:12 - and vertically now instead of new text
02:14 - we'll write play with capital letters
02:16 - and i'm also going to change the font
02:17 - asset to roboto bold
02:19 - and i think we can make this even more
02:21 - bold so that's also on the font style
02:23 - check off the b here that looks pretty
02:25 - good but currently it's just
02:27 - a plain white to change this let's
02:29 - scroll down onto the material settings
02:31 - let's first add an
02:32 - underlay in order to create a shadow
02:34 - let's enable this
02:35 - let's offset it by 1 on the x by -1 on
02:39 - the y
02:39 - we can also increase the softness to
02:41 - play the shadow a bit i think that looks
02:43 - a lot better let's also add a gradient
02:45 - to the text
02:46 - we do that under the font settings where
02:48 - it says color gradient we'll make sure
02:50 - to check that and we now configure a
02:52 - color for both the top left and right
02:54 - and the bottom left and right but
02:55 - instead of doing that in here since i
02:57 - want all of my text elements to share
02:59 - the same gradient we can create a color
03:01 - gradient asset
03:02 - to do that we'll go to the project right
03:04 - click go create
03:05 - text mesh pro and let's select color
03:07 - gradient let's rename this asset to
03:10 - gold and now we can define some colors
03:12 - and i have some color codes at the ready
03:14 - here so i'll simply paste these
03:15 - in i'm going to be using the same one
03:17 - for the top left and right
03:19 - and then for the bottom left and right
03:21 - we'll choose another one
03:23 - a bit darker this time so that's some
03:25 - nice yellow and orange colors
03:27 - let's now select our text object let's
03:28 - scroll to the gradient part and let's
03:30 - now drag in our
03:32 - gold object into the gradient preset
03:34 - slot and there we go we now have a nice
03:36 - gradient to our text
03:37 - let's rename this text to play and of
03:40 - course this is currently just a symbol
03:42 - text object
03:43 - we want to turn this into a button to do
03:45 - that let's right click on our canvas go
03:47 - ui and let's create
03:48 - a button let's start by scaling this
03:50 - button up and let's move it up as well
03:52 - for the image here we'll make that
03:54 - completely black and for now we'll just
03:55 - go ahead and disable it then under our
03:57 - button we'll notice a text object and
03:59 - this is what we want to replace with the
04:01 - play text that we just created
04:02 - so let's delete this text object and
04:04 - instead drag in our play text
04:06 - let's just rename this to text and
04:08 - instead rename our button to play button
04:12 - we now select our text object we'll
04:14 - click on the anchor presets at the top
04:16 - of the reg transform
04:17 - hold down alt and click on the bottom
04:20 - right corner this will snap our text to
04:22 - the center of our play button and make
04:24 - sure to always scale it to the same size
04:26 - as the button so now we should see that
04:28 - if we hit play we can actually press
04:31 - on our text however we don't actually
04:33 - see anything
04:34 - changing we need some visual feedback on
04:37 - what's going on
04:38 - to do that let's re-enable our image
04:40 - under the
04:41 - normal color let's go and change the
04:43 - alpha to zero
04:44 - then under highlighted color we'll
04:46 - definitely also decrease it but we do
04:48 - want it to be
04:49 - visible and when we then press the
04:51 - object we want it to be
04:53 - even clearer so with these settings if
04:55 - we try and hit play
04:56 - we should see that when we hover over
04:58 - our text the black box appears
05:00 - and when we click it it becomes even
05:02 - darker awesome
05:03 - we can of course change the size of the
05:05 - black box by adjusting this element so
05:07 - when we're happy with our button let's
05:08 - go ahead and duplicate
05:10 - it we'll click and drag while holding
05:11 - down shift to move it down on only one
05:13 - axis
05:14 - and this is going to be our options
05:16 - button so let's change the text to
05:18 - options let's also increase the width to
05:20 - make room for it and let's rename it to
05:23 - options button again we'll duplicate
05:25 - this hold down shift while moving it
05:27 - down
05:27 - and finally we want this to be our quit
05:29 - button again we'll resize it to only
05:31 - just fit our text
05:33 - and we then rename the button to quit
05:35 - button
05:36 - awesome so if we now hit play we should
05:38 - see that we're able to select
05:39 - three different buttons and that you can
05:41 - also use your keyboard to change between
05:43 - them
05:44 - of course our buttons currently don't do
05:46 - anything our play button should load the
05:48 - next scene
05:48 - our quit button should close the game
05:50 - and our options button should
05:52 - lead to another menu let's start by
05:54 - creating this menu to do that let's go
05:56 - to a canvas let's right-click
05:57 - and create an empty we'll rename this to
05:59 - our main menu
06:01 - let's also just size it up a bit this is
06:03 - going to contain all of our main menu
06:05 - elements
06:05 - so we can select all of our buttons and
06:07 - drag them under our main menu object
06:10 - let's then duplicate this object and
06:12 - let's rename this one
06:13 - to options menu let's disable the main
06:16 - menu
06:16 - now for this menu i don't want a lot of
06:18 - buttons but i do want
06:20 - it to say options at the top so i'm
06:22 - going to go under my options button
06:24 - take the text element alone and drag it
06:26 - to the top i'm then going to drag it up
06:28 - here where it says play
06:29 - and i'm going to delete both the play
06:30 - and options button the quit button we
06:32 - can turn into a
06:34 - back button let's call it back button
06:37 - and change the text to back i'll also
06:39 - decrease the text size to something like
06:42 - 50
06:42 - and we'll then resize it to fit and now
06:44 - we have some room where we can add
06:46 - our settings i'm just going to show you
06:47 - how to add a simple slider
06:49 - we'll right click on our options menu go
06:51 - ui and select
06:52 - slider let's definitely make this wider
06:55 - and a bit taller let's go into the
06:57 - slider
06:57 - find the handle and let's disable the
07:00 - image component
07:00 - we can then select our background and
07:03 - make this a neutral
07:04 - black let's also decrease the alpha to
07:06 - not make it stand out too much
07:08 - finally we can go under fill area and
07:10 - select fill and let's use the color
07:12 - picker here to get a nice color from our
07:14 - text
07:14 - now we should see if we hit play that
07:16 - we're able to adjust our slider to
07:18 - anything that we'd like
07:19 - let's also add a tiny text element
07:21 - telling what the slider does
07:23 - to that let's duplicate our text let's
07:25 - move this on top of the slider let's
07:27 - rename this to
07:28 - volume let's change the text to volume
07:31 - as well
07:31 - and let's decrease the font size to
07:33 - something like 32
07:35 - we now shrink down this element move it
07:37 - to our slider
07:38 - and let's align it to the left and we've
07:40 - now created a volume slider
07:42 - of course a slider doesn't change any
07:44 - settings if you want to know how to
07:45 - create a options menu in unity
07:47 - definitely let me know in the comments
07:49 - so now we have our two menus an options
07:51 - menu as well as a main menu
07:53 - all that's left is to add functionality
07:55 - to these two menus
07:56 - let's begin with the play button this is
07:58 - found under the main menu object
08:00 - but instead of adding a separate script
08:02 - for the play button itself
08:04 - let's add a script to the main menu
08:06 - object that will have functionality for
08:07 - all of our menu buttons
08:09 - let's hit add component let's write main
08:11 - menu let's create a new script of type c
08:14 - sharp
08:14 - create an ad let's double click it to
08:16 - open it up in visual studio
08:17 - now let's remove our start and update
08:20 - and instead let's create our own
08:21 - function that will call whenever we
08:23 - press the play button
08:24 - in order to be able to call it from the
08:25 - button we need to make the method public
08:27 - so we'll write public void let's call it
08:29 - play game
08:30 - and inside this method we'll simply load
08:32 - the next level whenever we want to
08:34 - change scenes in unity we need to be
08:36 - using
08:37 - unity engine that's scene management
08:40 - now we can simply go
08:42 - scenemanager.loadscene
08:44 - and here we could give it a name of the
08:45 - scene say level1
08:47 - we'd also give it a build index say 1
08:50 - but instead of loading a particular
08:52 - level let's simply load the next level
08:54 - in the queue to do that we get the index
08:57 - of our currently loaded level
08:58 - so scenemanager.getactivescene dot build
09:02 - index
09:03 - and we simply increase it by one so plus
09:06 - one
09:06 - if we now save this and go into unity we
09:09 - of course need to make sure that we add
09:11 - our scenes to the queue
09:12 - to do that we go file build settings and
09:15 - here we have all the scenes
09:16 - in our build first we want to add our
09:18 - menu so that has an index
09:20 - of 0 i will then add our game which has
09:22 - an index of 1.
09:23 - now the last thing we need to do is
09:25 - simply hook up our play button to the
09:27 - function that we just created
09:28 - to do that let's select the button let's
09:30 - scroll down to where it says
09:31 - on click this is a unity event we can
09:34 - add an action to this event by hitting
09:35 - the plus button
09:36 - we need to select an object that will be
09:38 - our main menus let's
09:40 - drag that in there now we can go and
09:41 - find our main menu script and under here
09:43 - we've created a function called play
09:45 - game
09:46 - and now if we play our game and press on
09:48 - the play button
09:49 - it loads the next scene which is our
09:51 - game even though currently maybe our
09:53 - menu is more fun
09:54 - so that's awesome the next button we'll
09:56 - hook up is the quit button
09:57 - again we can do this inside of the same
09:59 - script so we'll create another public
10:01 - void
10:02 - and this one we'll call quit game and
10:04 - this is even simpler we simply go
10:06 - application dot quit and that should
10:09 - close down the program
10:10 - however this won't happen inside of the
10:12 - unity editor so just to let ourselves
10:14 - know that this is working we'll throw
10:16 - debug.log
10:17 - and the message will be quit again let's
10:20 - go into unity
10:21 - let's select our quit button let's
10:23 - scroll down to the on click event
10:25 - let's add an action again we want to
10:27 - reference our main menu
10:28 - and the function that we want to call is
10:30 - under main menu and it's called
10:32 - quit game and again if we hit play and
10:34 - select quit
10:35 - we now see the quit message displayed in
10:37 - the console and i promise you that if
10:39 - you build this
10:40 - and try and do the same thing it will
10:42 - close down the program
10:43 - now the last button that's left is our
10:45 - options button that's because we don't
10:46 - want this to load another scene or
10:48 - quit the program we simply want this to
10:50 - change to another menu
10:51 - and we have that menu available right
10:53 - here it's just disabled so we don't
10:55 - actually need to do any programming
10:56 - we simply select the options button
10:58 - scroll down to the on click event
11:00 - add an action and here we can simply
11:01 - reference our options menu directly
11:04 - then as the function will go under game
11:06 - object i will choose the set
11:07 - active function this is a really awesome
11:10 - part of the unity ui events the fact
11:12 - that we can call functions on unity
11:13 - components
11:14 - and then we can choose whether or not we
11:15 - want the game object to be enabled and
11:17 - in this case we do
11:18 - but we also need to disable our main
11:20 - menu so we'll just add another action
11:22 - this time we'll reference our main menu
11:24 - we'll again go under game object choose
11:26 - set active and this time we want it to
11:28 - be
11:28 - false so if we now play the game and
11:30 - select our options
11:32 - we can see that our main menu gets
11:33 - disabled and our options menu gets
11:36 - enabled and here we are in our options
11:38 - menu of course we also need to be able
11:40 - to transition
11:41 - back using the back button to do that
11:43 - we'll go under the options menu
11:44 - select our back button add an action and
11:47 - here we want to reference our main menu
11:49 - go under game object you guessed it
11:51 - we'll select set active and we'll set
11:53 - that to true
11:54 - and then we want to disable our options
11:56 - menu so we'll add another action
11:58 - drag in the options menu go game object
12:00 - set active
12:01 - and this time false and that completes
12:03 - our menu
12:04 - we can go quit in order to quit the game
12:07 - we can go
12:07 - options in order to go into our options
12:09 - menu and adjust our volume
12:10 - we can select back and then we can press
12:13 - play and it puts us into the game
