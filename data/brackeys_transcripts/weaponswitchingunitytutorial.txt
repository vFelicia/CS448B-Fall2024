00:00 - in this video we'll have a look at how
00:01 - you can create weapon switching in unity
00:02 - this system will allow you to switch
00:04 - between any number of weapons that you
00:05 - want using both the scroll wheel and the
00:07 - number keys and it can easily be
00:08 - combined with the weapon script that we
00:09 - created in my previous video in order to
00:11 - make a really nice weapon system so
00:13 - check that out if you haven't already
00:14 - all right so let's jump into it by the
00:16 - way the weapons I'm using here are from
00:17 - the Sci-Fi weapons pack if you want to
00:19 - get it for yourself you can go to Dev
00:20 - assets.com click on the Sci-Fi weapons
00:23 - as with everything else on the side it's
00:24 - pay what you want this pack actually
00:25 - features a total of 32 different weapons
00:28 - so I hope you will enjoy them and if you
00:30 - making a more realistic shooter we
00:31 - actually also have the modern weapons
00:33 - pack which features some pretty popular
00:34 - realistic weapons so as you can see I
00:36 - have this example scene set up under the
00:38 - player we have the main camera and under
00:40 - the main camera we have our three
00:42 - different weapons you can see in the
00:43 - scene view here that I'm just using the
00:45 - standard rigit body firstperson
00:47 - controller you can always get this by
00:48 - right clicking going import package then
00:50 - choosing characters then going on
00:52 - standard assets characters first person
00:54 - character and choosing the rigid body
00:56 - FPS controller prefab now under our main
00:58 - camera we currently have the heavy
01:00 - weapon active but as you can see we also
01:01 - have a rifle and a pistol each one of
01:03 - these guns have a gun script on them
01:05 - which is responsible for shooting this
01:07 - is the one that we created in the
01:09 - previous video note how the different
01:10 - weapons have different gun settings now
01:12 - in order to switch between these when in
01:14 - game we need a script and we could just
01:16 - go ahead and put this on our main camera
01:17 - itself however I think it makes sense to
01:19 - have an object dedicated for this
01:21 - purpose so let's go ahead and right
01:22 - click on the main camera hit create Mt
01:24 - let's rename this one to weapon holder
01:26 - and I'll just have it sit in the center
01:28 - of our camera then let's take our three
01:29 - three weapons and drag them under the
01:31 - weapon holder we then select the weapon
01:33 - holder hit add component and we want to
01:35 - create a new script called something
01:36 - like weapon switching let's hit new
01:38 - script select C and hit create an ad
01:40 - let's double click it to open it up in
01:42 - visous studio now of course there's a
01:43 - bunch of way you can go about creating
01:44 - weapon switching you could create an
01:46 - array of all your weapons and then spawn
01:48 - them in and out as you need them or can
01:49 - even create some kind of scriptable
01:51 - object that is going to store all the
01:52 - information about your weapons but I
01:54 - think a much easier and still very
01:55 - customizable way is by simply enabling
01:57 - and disabling all of the child objects
01:59 - of a weapon holder this way we don't
02:01 - have to update any kind of list we don't
02:03 - have to go and create custom data
02:04 - objects and figure all that stuff out
02:06 - and we can still swap weapons in and out
02:08 - as we want so let's begin by delete the
02:09 - two using tags up here and we'll
02:11 - actually keep both the start and the
02:13 - update method for the script we only
02:14 - need one variable and let's go ahead and
02:16 - create that now this variable is going
02:18 - to determine what weapon we currently
02:20 - have selected you could use the name of
02:21 - the weapon but I think a lot easier is
02:23 - using some kind of index so we'll create
02:25 - a public integer and we'll call it
02:27 - something like selected weapon and we
02:29 - can just default this to zero now in
02:31 - unity whenever we talk about indexes of
02:33 - child objects we start from the top so a
02:35 - rifle here would have an index of zero
02:37 - and so this will be selected by default
02:38 - the heavy weapon will have one and the
02:40 - pistol will have two luckily we can very
02:42 - easily rearrange all the objects here so
02:44 - if we want our pistol to be selected
02:46 - first we simply drag that to the top but
02:48 - I'm just going to keep the rifle there
02:49 - so right when we start the game we want
02:50 - our rifle to be selected let's go ahead
02:52 - and call some kind of method that will
02:53 - do this for us let's call it select
02:56 - weapon so now we're calling the method
02:58 - we also need to create it let's do that
03:00 - right underneath our update method let's
03:01 - write void select weapon and basically
03:05 - what we want to do here is Loop through
03:06 - all of the weapons if the weapons index
03:08 - does not match the selected weapon we
03:10 - want to disable it and if it does match
03:12 - we want to enable it so in order to Loop
03:14 - through our weapons we use a four each
03:16 - statement and we say that for each
03:18 - transform and we'll go ahead and call
03:19 - this transform the weapon under
03:22 - transform this basically means that we
03:24 - will take all of the transforms that are
03:26 - child to our current transform which is
03:28 - the weapon holder and we'll do through
03:30 - each one referring to the current one
03:31 - we're inspecting as weapon let's open
03:33 - and close some curly brackets and of
03:35 - course now we need to reference by index
03:37 - and a for each statement doesn't have
03:39 - one so let's just go ahead and create
03:40 - one ourself up here we'll write in I
03:42 - equals z then each time we go through a
03:45 - weapon we write I ++ so the first time
03:47 - we Loop through I is going to be zero we
03:49 - then add one onto it the second time
03:51 - it's going to be equal to one and then
03:53 - add one onto it and so 2 3 4 and you get
03:56 - the point what this allows us to do is
03:57 - now go in here and check if I is equal
04:00 - to the selected weapon well then we want
04:02 - to enable the weapon and so we go
04:04 - weapon. game object do set active and we
04:07 - want to set it to true if not meaning
04:09 - that the indexes do not match we say
04:11 - weapon. game object. setactive false so
04:15 - what we're doing here is at the start of
04:17 - the game we want to select the currently
04:19 - selected weapon which defaults to zero
04:21 - so that's the first one and we do this
04:23 - by first creating a variable called i
04:25 - setting it equal to Zer we then Loop
04:27 - over all of the weapons and in the the
04:29 - beginning here I is going to be zero so
04:31 - if our selected weapon is zero and it is
04:34 - we're going to go ahead and make that
04:36 - active and we're then going to increase
04:38 - I and then for our second weapon we're
04:40 - going to check if 1 is equal to Zer
04:42 - which it is not and so we'll go ahead
04:44 - and disable that weapon and then we add
04:46 - one again and this time I is going to be
04:48 - equal to two and selected weapon is
04:50 - still going to be zero so it's again
04:52 - false and that is two going to be
04:54 - disabled this way only one of our
04:55 - weapons will be enabled at a time so if
04:58 - we save this we should actually already
04:59 - see that when we run the game it's going
05:01 - to select our rifle cool but we still
05:04 - can't switch weapons during the game to
05:06 - do that we need to get some input from
05:08 - our player and we do that in the update
05:09 - method we can both change weapons using
05:11 - the scroll wheel or the number Keys
05:13 - let's begin with the scroll wheel so
05:15 - let's check if our player Scrolls up to
05:17 - do that we write if input. getet access
05:20 - and the access that we want to check for
05:22 - here is the one called Mouse scroll
05:25 - wheel and you need to write this the
05:27 - exact same way that I did capital M
05:29 - capital S and capital W if not it's not
05:32 - going to work this here is a float that
05:34 - represents the current movement of a
05:35 - scroll wheel if it's greater than zero
05:37 - we've scrolled up and if it's less than
05:39 - zero we've scrolled down so here we can
05:41 - check if this value is greater than zero
05:44 - and if it is we can go ahead and select
05:45 - the next weapon in the chain so we want
05:47 - to increase selected Weapon by one to do
05:49 - that we go plus plus however right now
05:51 - we can do this infinitely and since we
05:53 - only have three weapons we are quickly
05:54 - going to get to a point where we simply
05:56 - disable all the weapons so instead let's
05:58 - have this number WRA around so that when
06:00 - we get to index 2 meaning that we've
06:02 - selected our third weapon and then
06:03 - scroll up it's going to go back to the
06:05 - first weapon meaning index zero to do
06:07 - that we want to check if selected weapon
06:10 - is greater than or equal to the current
06:12 - amount of weapons we have which we get
06:14 - by using transform. child count minus
06:16 - one so if we have three children we're
06:18 - going to check if selected weapon is
06:20 - greater than or equal to two and if it
06:22 - is we don't want to increase our
06:24 - selected weapon instead we want to set
06:26 - our selected weapon equal to zero and if
06:28 - not well then we can go ahead and
06:30 - increment it and we want this to happen
06:32 - in the opposite direction as well so
06:34 - we'll say here that if it is less than
06:36 - zero we want to see if selected weapon
06:38 - is less than or equal to zero and if it
06:42 - is we want to set selected weapon equal
06:44 - to transform. child count minus one and
06:47 - if it is not we want to go ahead and
06:49 - subtract from it this way we can go in
06:51 - both directions this can be a bit
06:53 - confusing to wrap your head around but
06:55 - try and go through it line by line to
06:56 - understand it and don't worry these
06:57 - things become much easier to understand
06:59 - over time so now if we save this and go
07:01 - into Unity our weapons won't change but
07:03 - we should be able to see our selected
07:04 - weapon variable change let's hit play
07:06 - and now when I scroll up you can see the
07:08 - selected weapon increase until it gets
07:10 - to two in which case it's going to go
07:12 - back to zero the same way if I scroll
07:15 - down you can see the decreasing and when
07:16 - I get to zero it's going to jump back to
07:19 - two awesome now all we need to do is
07:21 - also call our select weapon function but
07:23 - we only want to do this if we've
07:24 - actually selected a new weapon we could
07:26 - go in here and call Select weapon here
07:28 - and here but but since we're going to be
07:30 - lots of different stuff that requires us
07:32 - to select a new weapon let's not do that
07:34 - instead let's go up here and create a
07:35 - temporary variable it's going to be of
07:37 - type end and it's going to be called
07:39 - previous selected weapon and let's set
07:42 - it equal to our selected weapon then at
07:44 - the very bottom after we've done all of
07:46 - our calculations we can check if the
07:48 - previous selected weapon is not equal to
07:51 - the selected weapon in which case we
07:53 - want to go ahead and call our select
07:54 - weapon method so that we will enable and
07:56 - disable the corresponding objects this
07:58 - way when we hit play and again scroll
08:00 - using our Mouse wheel we can see that we
08:02 - can now switch between the weapons in
08:05 - both directions so now we actually
08:06 - already have a nice weapon switching
08:08 - script up and running and you can easily
08:10 - add on to this by creating weapon
08:11 - switching animation and maybe some UI to
08:14 - display what weapon we're currently on
08:16 - and which one is next in the chain I
08:17 - think most importantly we can go ahead
08:19 - and map the different weapons onto the
08:20 - number keys to do that we just use a
08:22 - bunch of ifif statements we go in here
08:24 - and we write if input. getet key down
08:27 - and the key that we want to check for is
08:29 - key code. alpha1 meaning that we've
08:32 - pressed the one key on the keyboard and
08:34 - if we have we can go ahead and set
08:36 - selected weapon equal to Z let's go
08:39 - ahead and copy this if statement and
08:40 - we'll just go ahead and change the one
08:42 - to a two and the Z to A 1 however we of
08:45 - course also need to check if we have two
08:47 - weapons if not we don't want to set
08:48 - selected weapon to one so in here we
08:50 - need to add another requirement and we
08:52 - use the double and signs here and what
08:54 - we want to ensure is that transform.
08:57 - child count is greater than or equal to
08:59 - two and now we can copy this entire if
09:01 - statement once more and let's just do it
09:03 - once more this way we can use the first
09:05 - four numbers we'll change this one to a
09:07 - three this one to a three and this one
09:09 - to a two this one to a four this one to
09:11 - a four and this one to a three if we now
09:14 - save this and H into unity and I begin
09:16 - by pressing two you can see it switches
09:18 - to the second weapon three to the third
09:20 - one to the rifle and four nothing
09:23 - happens so now we can use a combination
09:24 - of the scroll wheel and the number keys
09:26 - in order to change weapons you can very
09:28 - easily go ahead and add new weapons to
09:30 - the hierarchy here and everything should
09:32 - automatically update you can also go
09:34 - ahead and reorganize elements on the Fly
09:36 - and our script should just update to
09:37 - take care of it so that's pretty much it
