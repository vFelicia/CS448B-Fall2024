00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello and
00:04 - welcome to video number 21 in the how to
00:06 - make a 2d platformer course in this
00:09 - video we're gonna take a look at doing a
00:11 - lot of UI work and also implementing the
00:14 - wave spawner that I'm going to talk
00:17 - about in a sec so kind of a wave
00:18 - countdown timer and a wave incoming text
00:22 - and stuff like that so basically it's
00:25 - been a while since I've updated this 2d
00:27 - platformer course and there are two good
00:29 - reasons for that and the first one is
00:31 - that I've started this how to make a
00:34 - multiplayer FPS course also in unity
00:38 - using unit which I definitely suggest
00:40 - you check out I'm very proud of this
00:42 - series and you guys have given me great
00:44 - feedback so far so that's on the screen
00:47 - right now and it's also of course in
00:49 - c-sharp and then I've also made this
00:52 - making a wave spawner tutorial which is
00:56 - also on the screen and it was kind of
00:58 - meant as a continuation of the 2d
01:00 - platformer course but since making a
01:02 - wave spawn is something you have to do
01:03 - for a lot of games I kind of created it
01:06 - created this own separate tutorial so
01:08 - other people would find it interesting
01:10 - too but that's definitely something that
01:13 - you will want to check out before you
01:15 - are doing this tutorial or you will have
01:16 - a very hard time following along because
01:19 - we're going to be using the script
01:20 - created in that video and then adding UI
01:23 - on top of that so if we start up unity
01:27 - now you can see here that on the GM
01:31 - object there is now a wave spawner
01:32 - script and we have these different
01:35 - properties where we can add waves give
01:37 - the names and add the enemy prefab
01:41 - account and a spawn rate and all that we
01:44 - have some spawn points and we have this
01:46 - time between waves that we can tweak so
01:49 - basically if I just put the to do list
01:52 - on the screen here you can see that
01:54 - there are quite a few things that we
01:56 - have to do so let's just get started
01:57 - first of all I want to fix a UI bug
02:00 - that's been happening on my system at
02:02 - least where if we press play and wait
02:04 - for some enemies to spawn here the HP
02:08 - bar isn't showing and if it is it's
02:11 - showing where we
02:12 - and if we drag one of these prefabs into
02:17 - the scene here while not playing you can
02:20 - see that there's no issue when looking
02:22 - close but when we then scroll out it
02:24 - simply just disappears and I found that
02:28 - this bug is kind of weird but I found an
02:30 - easy fix which is simply going under the
02:32 - health bar here and then in putting a
02:36 - white source image so just like a two by
02:39 - two wide texture and that will act as
02:43 - basically not having a sprite and that
02:46 - will kind of get rid of the error so if
02:47 - we just open Photoshop or any photo
02:51 - editing application of your choice you
02:54 - can also just search search google for
02:56 - wide image and then we'll just quickly
02:59 - create one here so photo shovels is
03:02 - loading up and possibly I go and create
03:07 - a new workspace here simply two by two
03:10 - and we'll just call this white text and
03:19 - we're simply going to be using the
03:21 - default white background here so we can
03:23 - go ahead and say that and I don't think
03:25 - that's any reason to save this as a
03:27 - Photoshop file so just save it as a JPEG
03:30 - and simply navigate to your project
03:33 - folder - here on the assets and the
03:39 - sprites there so simply white text JPEG
03:42 - and the quality is not gonna matter here
03:45 - and we can now close down Photoshop wait
03:48 - for unity to import it here looks like
03:50 - it's already done that and now simply
03:52 - here select the white text and now you
03:56 - can see that when we scroll out the
03:58 - problem has disappeared and this is a
04:00 - good idea to do for all of your aliens
04:04 - and future empty textures if you just
04:06 - want this box and we can go ahead and do
04:08 - the same for the players so if we just
04:10 - find the player status indicator we can
04:13 - I search for white X and hit apply on
04:17 - that to good so that was fixing a bug so
04:21 - we can now cross that off the list then
04:24 - we have
04:25 - to play some spawn points because the
04:27 - new wave spawner system here have this
04:32 - has this spawn point system where we add
04:35 - points to an array and you can see that
04:37 - I've added three points so far so what
04:40 - we'll do here is we will need to make
04:43 - sure that enemies spawn with outside our
04:48 - field of view and it would be
04:50 - interesting if they would just always
04:52 - spoil spawn at some point that we can
04:56 - see and then come and chase us so what
04:58 - we can do in order to achieve this
05:00 - effect very easily assembly find our
05:03 - camera and take the spawn points which
05:06 - are currently under on the GM object and
05:09 - simply drag them under our camera and
05:14 - the main cam let's just drag them on the
05:17 - camera which should be fine and hit
05:19 - apply on the GM I'll click there so we
05:21 - don't lose the prefab connection and
05:23 - then we can just place them somewhere
05:26 - outside of the camera here so I'm gonna
05:29 - place them kind of like this so they'll
05:32 - pretty much always appear to come from
05:35 - above but that's fine for me for now at
05:39 - least so that we'll just make sure that
05:41 - they don't spawn on the screen here so
05:44 - that's fine and and of course when they
05:46 - are parented to the camera when the
05:48 - player moves so the camera moves the
05:51 - spawn points are gonna move with it so
05:53 - if we just want to check that out in
05:56 - effect here so we'll wait three seconds
05:59 - and the spawn and they will come into
06:01 - the camera view here so you can see just
06:04 - what that looks like cool so that was
06:10 - already two points next up we're going
06:12 - to be kind of first creating the wave UI
06:15 - then we are going to do some animations
06:17 - and then we're going to create a script
06:18 - that will play these animations
06:21 - depending on the wave state so let's
06:25 - start by creating the UI here so let's
06:27 - right-click go under UI and that's
06:30 - create an empty canvas and let's name
06:33 - this UI overlay I want some kind of game
06:35 - UI overlay that will store all of the
06:38 - stuff that don't move with any
06:40 - particular object but it's just kind of
06:45 - put onto the screen so that's what this
06:49 - is going to be for and therefore I want
06:51 - this to be set to screen space overlay I
06:53 - want it to be pixel perfect and thus
06:55 - orders order to be fairly high but
06:58 - because not many objects are going to
07:00 - overlay this UI so let's just set the
07:03 - sword old order to one or two depending
07:07 - on what you want to do so and the rest
07:10 - of the settings here are going to be
07:12 - just fine now we can right click on this
07:14 - go under UI and then create a text
07:20 - object and you can see that I've
07:23 - imported this computer pack and this
07:25 - contains different fonts that I often
07:28 - use and I've shown this in other
07:30 - tutorials but if we go to window and
07:33 - then assets door if I can find it here
07:36 - asset stores there and load this up then
07:40 - you can search for computer computer
07:44 - fund and you can see that there's this
07:47 - free computer font pack and this has a
07:50 - bunch of different fonts that you can
07:53 - see are very pixelated or fairly cool so
07:58 - we're going to be using a fund from
08:00 - there you can of course go to any place
08:03 - and get your own fonts a good places for
08:06 - example dafont.com and once you've
08:10 - loaded that in we can simply select it
08:12 - here and I'm going to be using the
08:15 - Lilliput steps here I think that has a
08:17 - very cool look to it especially if you
08:21 - use only capital letters so that's good
08:23 - and make this white and let's change the
08:26 - text here to waive so we're gonna have
08:32 - wave and then a big red number and then
08:34 - incoming so I'm gonna change the
08:38 - controls here and scale this up Center
08:43 - the text and bump up the font size quite
08:47 - a bit so I want this to be very big and
08:51 - scary like so
08:52 - or something like 40 is going to be
08:54 - fairly great I think and let's just
08:57 - change this to wave text so we know what
09:01 - it is and then we can add a component
09:03 - because we're now in the game you can
09:05 - see that this white text it's not too
09:08 - clear especially if we view it when
09:12 - there's something passing by and
09:14 - therefore we can add a small shadow here
09:17 - just to give it a bit of contrast and
09:20 - that might not make the biggest
09:21 - difference but I think it looks a lot
09:24 - better when you you have that contrast
09:27 - to the text and then we can duplicate
09:30 - this and we can drag the duplicate down
09:33 - and we can make this a scary big number
09:36 - so let's just input five here change the
09:40 - font size to something like 90 and of
09:43 - course we're going to have to expand
09:44 - this and make this red yeah that looks
09:49 - that looks very great and then we can
09:52 - save the take the wave text here and
09:54 - just move it closer to the actual font
09:57 - something like that and we can rename
10:01 - this to wave count text or wave number
10:07 - text and we can duplicate the wave text
10:11 - here rename this to wave incoming text
10:15 - drag this down and input wave or
10:20 - incoming here cool so you can see what
10:24 - that looks like and I think that gives a
10:26 - pretty great effect what we want to do
10:29 - is of course move this up so it doesn't
10:30 - overlay our player something like this I
10:35 - think we could move it up even further
10:38 - yeah that looks pretty fun might want to
10:42 - change the wave and incoming text here
10:46 - to have a bit smaller font something
10:51 - like that is better I think and we can
10:53 - also move it closer yeah I think that
10:59 - looks very great that makes the the wave
11:02 - number and the actual wave number really
11:04 - pop
11:05 - so that's pretty cool and let's just
11:07 - create an empty object to kind of host
11:12 - these objects to to be act as a parent
11:17 - for these objects and in order to do
11:19 - this that's just drag it up here and
11:21 - scale it to fit the elements and then
11:24 - let's drag these under that object you
11:26 - can see that they are all automatically
11:28 - centered their anchor points are
11:30 - centered on that object and now we can
11:34 - simply go ahead and anchor this to the
11:37 - top so when our canvas scales you can
11:40 - see that that will follow and apparently
11:43 - these aren't what they are they just
11:47 - aren't updating so you can see here that
11:50 - if we were to take our game view and
11:53 - scale it down you can see the elements
11:56 - will follow cool I think that's kind of
12:00 - the best that we are gonna get this
12:03 - easily at least maybe move it up a bit
12:05 - to account for smaller screen sizes so
12:09 - that's going to be fine for now and we
12:11 - can go ahead and call this something
12:13 - like wave incoming and then we're going
12:17 - to create a nother text element and we
12:20 - can simply duplicate one of these move
12:23 - it outside the wave incoming and let's
12:27 - just send to that and this is going to
12:30 - actually let's not duplicate this let's
12:32 - duplicate the actual number move it out
12:36 - and let's disable waving coming and
12:40 - let's rename this to wave countdown text
12:45 - and let's make this white and I think
12:48 - that's pretty much all we have to do
12:50 - with you so let's just change the number
12:51 - there to three so we can see what we're
12:53 - doing and you can see now that we have
12:56 - this countdown that goes three two one
12:58 - zero that fades out and the wave
13:01 - incoming text fades in so I think that's
13:04 - going to look super cool for now let's
13:06 - just disable both objects and will
13:08 - enable them through the animator awesome
13:12 - so now that we have that done we can
13:15 - focus back onto our actual game here
13:19 - and let's see what we have to do so now
13:21 - we need to create some animations so
13:25 - actually we're going to focus back here
13:27 - and let's go ahead and create a new
13:29 - animation so if you haven't docked this
13:33 - yet you can go to window and then
13:35 - animation and make sure you go under
13:37 - animation and not animator we've talked
13:40 - about that before and this looks a bit
13:42 - different now than it did before it'd
13:44 - definitely be better and let's just take
13:46 - create and let's name this animation the
13:51 - wave countdown animation and let's just
13:57 - save that and I think that looks fairly
14:03 - great actually what I want to do yeah
14:07 - okay I changed my mind so let's remove
14:09 - that let's remove the two animations
14:12 - here we're just gonna make a small
14:14 - change instead of having this UI overlay
14:17 - and then the animators sit on that I
14:19 - think we're gonna handle all of our wave
14:21 - UI separately from other UI over the
14:26 - elements that we might want to have so
14:28 - let's create another empty object here
14:30 - and let's just scale that to fit the
14:33 - entire screen so I've angered it to fit
14:36 - the screen but I also scaled it at the
14:38 - same time by holding down alt and then
14:40 - clicking here and then we can drag under
14:44 - this object we can drag the wave
14:46 - countdown text and the wave incoming
14:48 - object and let's just rename this to
14:50 - wave UI Cole so we have this parent
14:55 - object and now we can create the
14:57 - animator make this the wave countdown
15:01 - animation and we're just gonna start
15:04 - with that and then you can see we have
15:05 - this wave UI controller or animator so
15:10 - animation controller it is cool so now
15:15 - we simply need to edit some properties
15:17 - here so if we just disable the animation
15:20 - here basically what we want to doing
15:22 - want to be doing is we want to be
15:24 - editing the wave countdown text and we
15:27 - want to be scaling this and changing the
15:30 - opacity so we can go out and
15:32 - at a canvas group and this will allow us
15:37 - to easily change the Alpha on this
15:39 - object so the wave countdown text is
15:42 - going to if we hit record
15:44 - first of all enable and then we're going
15:48 - to change the scale first off we are
15:52 - going to start with a scale of 1.5 1.5
15:55 - 1.5 z actually doesn't matter but I like
15:59 - scaling uniformly and an alpha of 0 and
16:05 - you can see that it's automatically
16:07 - created because I went over to this
16:10 - point on the timeline it's automatically
16:12 - created keyframes for the other values
16:14 - of 1 1 1 and alpha 1 and now we can
16:17 - simply swap these keyframes so the
16:19 - canvas and the scale the game object we
16:23 - want to enable immediately we can simply
16:25 - swap these so put that down there
16:28 - and put this over here and now with
16:32 - almost no work actually let's just right
16:35 - click and select flat put almost no work
16:38 - we've created this cool
16:40 - fade-in animation so that's all we
16:44 - needed to do there then we can create a
16:46 - separate animation that will fade in the
16:51 - wave incoming text and favor fade out
16:55 - this wave countdown text so let's create
16:57 - a new clip and let's call this wave
17:03 - incoming yep that's good and that's it's
17:12 - there everything is fine and what this
17:15 - will do is it will go ahead and fade out
17:18 - the wave countdown text so it will start
17:22 - out by being enabled and having an alpha
17:25 - of 1 so we can just change this to
17:28 - create a keyframe there and then change
17:30 - it back to 1 and then after half a
17:34 - minute or half a second we're going to
17:37 - change the Alpha down to zero and then
17:39 - we are going to disable this object so
17:42 - now we've created the fade out for that
17:44 - object and
17:45 - we can focus on the waving coming object
17:47 - and I want to exit the record mode here
17:51 - add a canvas group to this also and into
17:57 - recording again and we want to enable
18:00 - this object at this point and we also
18:04 - want to change the Alpha to zero and the
18:08 - scale to one point five actually let's
18:12 - not do anything for the scale on this
18:14 - object so let's just disable the entire
18:17 - scale component there and oops it didn't
18:24 - for some reason there we go and let's
18:31 - select the canvas group for waving
18:35 - coming and we can just drag this over to
18:39 - make it fade in instead so you can see
18:42 - the effect that that has and we need to
18:46 - zoom out here let's make it have quite a
18:49 - Faden then we can make a copy of those
18:55 - keyframes simply ctrl-c ctrl-v drag this
18:59 - over make a copy of the Alpha cero
19:05 - keyframe and drag that over again and
19:11 - then we can right click on all of this
19:13 - and hit flat so now we have when we play
19:18 - the text fades out the wave countdown
19:23 - text fades out and the wave incoming
19:25 - text fades in instead and I want to give
19:28 - a bit more time to the wave incoming tag
19:30 - here so let's just drag that out and
19:33 - drag that out oops and maybe make it
19:39 - stay with a full opacity for a bit
19:44 - longer here so you can see what that
19:45 - looks like and I think that's much
19:48 - better so that was all we needed to do
19:51 - for the animation because the actual
19:53 - text of the object is something that
19:56 - we're going to be changing through a
19:58 - script
19:59 - so now that we have that in place we can
20:01 - go ahead and add a relationship between
20:03 - these in the animators that make sense
20:05 - so let's just find the wave UI animation
20:11 - controller here go on to the animator
20:13 - and we can have a look at this so
20:16 - basically the default animation is going
20:19 - to be the wave countdown because right
20:21 - when we start out the game we're going
20:23 - to have some kind of countdown and so
20:27 - that's fine this is going to be the
20:29 - default state and if it isn't if it is
20:32 - an orange you can simply right-click and
20:34 - hit the set US layer default state and
20:38 - that means that we are going to have an
20:40 - automatic transition from the entry
20:42 - point to the wave countdown state so
20:46 - that's fine and now we want to create a
20:49 - transition from this two wave incoming
20:51 - and we want to add a criteria to this so
20:55 - therefore we can add a parameter so
20:57 - let's add one here and ideally we would
21:02 - be using triggers for this but I
21:03 - experienced quite a few problems when
21:06 - using triggers so instead we're going to
21:08 - be using polls and that's going to work
21:10 - just fine triggers is a new invention in
21:14 - the Unity animation system and I've been
21:16 - using polls for a long time and creating
21:19 - a fully working games with this so don't
21:22 - worry it's not a bad solution is it's
21:24 - just a different one and in here we are
21:27 - simply going to call this the wave
21:30 - incoming and we are going to make
21:33 - another one for wave countdown and all
21:41 - we need to do here is simply select the
21:44 - transition add as a condition that wave
21:48 - incoming is true you can see that it did
21:51 - that automatically so that's perfect and
21:54 - then we want to disable exit time and we
21:58 - want to set the we want it to have a
22:00 - fixed duration but a duration of zero so
22:04 - that should make it transition correctly
22:08 - and we can maybe just set that to zero
22:10 - and then disable house exit time just
22:13 - that this makes sense to look at and
22:15 - then we make a transition that goes the
22:18 - other way where the condition is that
22:20 - wave countdown equals two and that we do
22:25 - the same here so we want to set that
22:26 - zero disable has X at time and set a
22:30 - duration of zero so that was we'll just
22:33 - make these transitions atomic meaning
22:36 - that we don't have any fade in or fade
22:37 - out time because we've created the
22:39 - actual fade in and fade outs and all
22:44 - that all the transitions in the
22:46 - animations themselves so we don't want
22:48 - unity to have any control over that so
22:51 - that's all we need to do and now we can
22:53 - actually go into the game and this won't
22:57 - be paired with anything whoops we have
22:59 - to turn on looping on both wave
23:01 - countdown and the wave incoming
23:04 - animations so now we can hit play and
23:06 - you can see that fades in and imagine
23:09 - that this is changing then we can hit
23:11 - wave incoming
23:13 - and you can see it transitions over
23:15 - there and we disable that and we go back
23:19 - to whoops for some reason that went back
23:23 - automatically which is definitely not
23:26 - something that we want so wave countdown
23:29 - to true I don't remember setting that so
23:35 - this is weird
