00:00 - hello everyone welcome to this video
00:01 - this is a live stream recording on
00:04 - making a flipping knife replica inside
00:06 - of unity and what we're going to be
00:08 - making today is this so if I play here
00:12 - you can see that we have any physics
00:14 - enabled knife that we can kind of throw
00:17 - up into the air and try and Pierce this
00:20 - wooden blog with and oh I'm actually
00:22 - doing great that was three times in a
00:24 - row I believe four times guys are seeing
00:27 - okay four times is now the record we
00:31 - today we're just going to be focusing on
00:33 - making this game and then towards the
00:35 - end we'll do a Q&A session where you can
00:37 - ask questions and I'll answer them of
00:40 - course if you're watching on YouTube you
00:41 - can just see that happening but yet this
00:44 - is what we'll be making today so really
00:46 - fun simple game shouldn't take too long
00:48 - and let's just dive right into it
00:52 - so the first thing that we want to do is
00:54 - go ahead and create a new unity project
00:57 - so we'll go file new project and I'm
01:00 - going to call this um flippy woops
01:04 - flippy knife replica no just flippy
01:09 - knife and I'm gonna make it a 3d project
01:12 - and put it inside of my projects folder
01:14 - and unit is just going to boot up all
01:16 - these standard files here and we can
01:18 - wait okay I think this looks like
01:22 - success yes
01:24 - Saphir celebrating right over there yes
01:29 - alright thanks for tuning in and the
01:32 - livestream I had fun I hope you guys did
01:34 - as well as he okay so now that unit is
01:37 - working to this review on YouTube I
01:39 - placed a cut there hopefully I did and
01:41 - now things are working we had some
01:43 - technical issues on opening up unity the
01:46 - version we are using right now is 2017
01:47 - point 2 which is the beta version but it
01:49 - should be out really soon and it really
01:52 - shouldn't be any problems I haven't had
01:53 - any so far so now we are inside of unity
01:57 - and we can get started so the first
02:00 - thing that I want to do here is just
02:01 - kind of sketch out the level and let's
02:03 - right-click go 3d object and select a
02:05 - cube and this is going to be our wooden
02:09 - block so we can reset the transform on
02:11 - this we can call it
02:13 - wooden block and we can set the scale to
02:15 - something like 1 by 0.3 by 1 so just
02:20 - kind of a squished cube let's also take
02:22 - our camera and focus it on this block in
02:25 - fact I'm also going to kind of decrease
02:28 - the field of view I don't want to make
02:30 - this auto graphic but I definitely do
02:33 - want to have less field of view so let's
02:36 - put this at 30 kind of zooms everything
02:39 - in and we can just take our camera and
02:41 - drag it out further here so place it in
02:44 - the middle something along these lines
02:47 - maybe also kind of move it up or rotate
02:50 - it up and then move it down something
02:51 - like that looks pretty nice and I think
02:53 - that's pretty close to what we see in
02:55 - the game it's also duplicate a wooden
02:57 - block and let's rename this one to
02:59 - ground now of course we can drag this is
03:03 - down here so that our wooden block sits
03:05 - on top of our ground and we can extend
03:08 - this out on the X and Z so we can make
03:11 - this a 20 long and then on the Z here
03:14 - we'll put a 10 and it's actually only do
03:17 - a 5 and also kind of drag this back here
03:20 - so look something like this
03:22 - I know it's beautiful already kind of
03:25 - reminds me of Mass Effect just kidding
03:28 - so let's create a whoops I don't want to
03:31 - show anything in the Explorer here I
03:32 - want to create a material and this is
03:35 - going to be our ground material actually
03:37 - I'm gonna name it grass because we want
03:39 - this to be green and we can just
03:41 - decrease the smoothness change this to
03:44 - kind of a greenish color something along
03:48 - those lines and we can duplicate this
03:50 - material this one we'll call the wood
03:53 - material and we'll place that on top of
03:55 - the block again we don't again we want
03:58 - to change the color here to some kind of
04:01 - a wooden color and this is not going to
04:03 - be especially pretty but that will do
04:08 - then we go into our camera and instead
04:10 - of showing the skybox will show a solid
04:12 - color I'm just gonna call it picnic
04:14 - grass here and then make it a tiny bit
04:16 - darker so something along these lines
04:20 - so that is kind of the base of our level
04:23 - I'm just gonna save this fighting
04:25 - controllers or command s
04:26 - you're on a Mac and then let's just call
04:29 - it main for the main scene so if you're
04:33 - seeing this right now and see kind of
04:35 - thinking this doesn't look nearly as
04:37 - nice as what you showed before that's
04:40 - because what I had before had
04:42 - post-processing effects and I'd use kind
04:45 - of some of the same techniques as in my
04:48 - how to get good graphics in unity video
04:51 - where we switch to linear rendering we
04:54 - switch to deferred rendering and we
04:58 - apply a bunch of post-processing effects
05:00 - and with those steps you will make
05:02 - pretty much anything look a whole lot
05:04 - better and that that's what I did I had
05:07 - a vignette in there I had some motion
05:09 - blur some anti-aliasing all that good
05:12 - stuff I'm not gonna put that in here
05:14 - just yet but if everything goes well and
05:17 - we kind of wrap up the tutorial and you
05:19 - guys want to see we can't apply this
05:21 - towards the end of the tutorial so keep
05:24 - that in mind so I'm gonna save this now
05:26 - and it's time to add a knife and for
05:29 - this I went into blender and created a
05:31 - very simple knife model let's see if
05:33 - blender wants to start so I'm just gonna
05:35 - open this and really keep in mind here
05:38 - that I am probably the worst modeler
05:41 - alive this is what I came up with
05:43 - feel free to clap your hands plot I know
05:48 - it's it's super super super bad but it
05:52 - will work for now and we're going to be
05:54 - seeing it at a distance anyway I'm also
05:56 - just going to go into the materials here
05:58 - and change this from blue to a black
06:00 - because yeah that shouldn't be blue no
06:04 - that's only worries so something along
06:07 - these lines that we can always adjust it
06:08 - in unity so let me just say that and
06:10 - really all I did in order to create this
06:12 - was going add a cylinder and kind of
06:16 - play around with on the width of the
06:18 - cylinder and then after that I went in
06:20 - and added a cube and all I did was add a
06:24 - bunch of edge loops on the cube and then
06:26 - kind of play with the weight on those so
06:29 - really really simple to create the two
06:31 - parts of this knife so let's now take
06:34 - this knife oops
06:36 - to be temporary file and drag it into
06:38 - unity
06:40 - it's going to go ahead and import and
06:43 - the first thing that I want to do here
06:45 - is um this looks a bit different it has
06:49 - a materials tab now oh that's awesome oh
06:53 - that's so nice it's no longer gonna
06:56 - Clara the project panel with materials
06:59 - folders yes this is exactly what I
07:02 - wanted to see okay this a man we didn't
07:05 - get to put this in the video I hadn't
07:07 - noticed that's awesome okay so we are
07:10 - going to set the scale factor here to
07:11 - something like point zero four point
07:14 - zero three maybe even yeah let's do that
07:16 - let's just apply that and let's try and
07:20 - drag this into unity I hit F to focus on
07:24 - it and move it up a bit yeah and I think
07:26 - this is an appropriate size we might
07:29 - want it to be a tiny bit bigger let's
07:32 - try 0.35 hit apply on that yeah that's a
07:37 - bit bitter so and I think the materials
07:40 - here are looking just fine of course
07:42 - they're not beautiful but they will do
07:44 - for now
07:45 - we can maybe go in here and create a
07:47 - folder called materials and order the
07:50 - grass and wood will drag or will take
07:52 - the grass and wood and drag them under
07:54 - there and we can also create another
07:56 - material which we'll call the blade and
07:59 - we'll just drag this onto the blade here
08:00 - we can make this completely white and
08:03 - actually give this some smoothness just
08:05 - so we can get a bit of reflection at
08:08 - least in theory so yeah when you're
08:12 - satisfied with your knife really all you
08:14 - actually also want to go and kind of set
08:18 - the rig to none here so we don't get an
08:20 - animator sitting on on I fear now that's
08:23 - gone cool so when we you're satisfied
08:26 - with your knife model I definitely
08:28 - recommend creating an empty game object
08:29 - which has all the gameplay functionality
08:32 - for our knife and then keeping the
08:34 - graphics separate so let's just go in
08:37 - here and create right click on the knife
08:39 - hit create empty let's reset the
08:41 - transform on this let's drag it out so
08:43 - it's no longer parented to the knife
08:45 - that's called our knife here let's call
08:48 - that graphics and it's dragged that
08:50 - under our game object let's rename our
08:52 - game object to knife
08:54 - so now that these two are separated we
08:57 - can kind of orient them in any way that
08:59 - we'd like and the first thing that I
09:01 - would like to do here is set the knife
09:03 - rotation to zero and then on your
09:06 - graphics I want to rotate that by
09:08 - negative 90 on the X just to make sure
09:12 - that when it's pointing in this
09:14 - direction our rotation is zero zero zero
09:18 - I think that makes a lot of sense cool
09:21 - so now we can go into our knife here and
09:23 - add a few components the first thing
09:26 - that I want to add is a rigid body
09:28 - that's going here and create a rigid
09:31 - body and we can actually just leave all
09:33 - the settings as is the only thing that I
09:36 - want to do is make sure to constrain
09:38 - this rigid body on a few axes so we
09:42 - basically only wanted to rotate around
09:44 - the Z we only want to rotate it this way
09:48 - we don't want it to go flip in this
09:50 - direction or rotate around the y axis so
09:53 - we can go in and freeze rotation on x
09:56 - and y also we don't want it we only
09:59 - wanted to move on x and y we don't want
10:02 - it to move in depth using the z axis so
10:05 - we can also freeze the position on this
10:07 - Z so now we're sure that our knife will
10:10 - only move in the directions that we
10:12 - specify that's all good now we can add
10:15 - another component and this time we want
10:17 - to add a box Collider and this is by
10:20 - default going to be way too big so
10:23 - that's going here and decrease the size
10:25 - to add a note point one on the X might
10:29 - still be too big I'm just gonna switch
10:32 - to the side view here and then click on
10:35 - this Center to switch in to isometric
10:36 - view so we can kind of line this up
10:39 - nicer so I'm just going to decrease this
10:41 - and I'm gonna hold down alt while doing
10:43 - it to allow myself to do it with greater
10:46 - precision also going to do the same
10:49 - thing on the Y here we also want to move
10:51 - it up on the Y I'm really just try and
10:55 - adjust this as as good as you can and
10:57 - make sure to leave a good amount of room
10:59 - at the top I might even leave a tiny bit
11:03 - more because it helps us when we then
11:07 - need to
11:08 - TEKT whether or not we hit with the tip
11:10 - of our knife or with the shaft of our
11:13 - ninth so this looks good and then we
11:17 - just need to adjust the Z and we can
11:20 - bring this into something like point
11:21 - zero two point zero three maybe
11:25 - something like that looks pretty good so
11:28 - now we have at least an approximate
11:29 - Collider the next thing that we want is
11:32 - a script so let's go ahead and add a
11:34 - component and we're going to call this
11:36 - our knife script it's going to be C
11:38 - sharp and let's hit create an app let's
11:40 - double click it to open it up in Visual
11:42 - Studio this is where I'm going to take a
11:44 - sip of my cup of tea cool let me just
11:50 - check the chat here everything is going
11:54 - good awesome
11:58 - see instead of manually making the box
12:02 - collider why not just attach one to the
12:03 - model then copy it up to its parent you
12:07 - sir are genius yeah that would probably
12:11 - be a bit faster but I didn't want it to
12:15 - fit exactly with the model I wanted to
12:17 - leave a bit of room at the top so let's
12:20 - just say that's why cool so what do we
12:28 - want to do here the first thing that we
12:31 - want to do is get a reference to our
12:33 - rigid body so let's go up here and let's
12:35 - create a public rigid body and let's
12:38 - call it art B let's say that go into
12:41 - unity and let's make sure to reference
12:43 - this right away so now we have a field
12:45 - here where we can throw in our rigid
12:47 - body so now we can refer to our rigid
12:51 - body as our B inside of our script and
12:54 - the first and basically what we want to
12:56 - do here is check whether or not we press
12:59 - the mouse button if we do we want to see
13:02 - where we press the mouse button we then
13:05 - want to see when we release the mouse
13:07 - button button and where we do that and
13:09 - then we can subtract the two positions
13:11 - so the position of the mouse when we
13:13 - pressed and the position of the mouse
13:16 - when we released it and that will give
13:18 - us kind of the vector which means an
13:21 - arrow pointing from the start point to
13:24 - the end point of our mouse position and
13:26 - that means that we have an arrow
13:28 - pointing in the direction that we want
13:31 - to shoot our knife and the length of
13:34 - this arrow is going to be the amount of
13:35 - force that we're going to use to shoot
13:37 - so you could imagine that if we go in
13:40 - here and click say here on the screen
13:43 - and only drag up a little bit we
13:46 - definitely want the knife to shoot up
13:47 - but we want to use only very little
13:49 - force if we click again and drag much
13:52 - further this time we want the knife to
13:54 - to shoot up much further
13:56 - so with greater force and of course if
13:59 - you do this in the vert or in the
14:01 - horizontal direction we wanted to shoot
14:03 - well horizontally so to do this we'll go
14:07 - inside of update and the first thing
14:08 - that we need is to check what for when
14:11 - we press our mouse button so input that
14:13 - get mouse button down and the Mosman
14:16 - that we want to check for is zero which
14:18 - means the left mouse button when we do
14:22 - this we can set our start swipe position
14:25 - so in here or you start drag position
14:27 - whatever you want to call it we can
14:29 - create a private vector3 which is going
14:32 - to be our start swipe plus issue I don't
14:37 - know start swipe that's that's called
14:39 - start swipe and actually we can do this
14:41 - as a vector to mean then set start swipe
14:45 - equal to input get mouse button Oh dad
14:50 - no input dot mass position there we go
14:55 - and this is actually going to work and
14:58 - I'm gonna show you that in a second but
14:59 - first we also want to check if input get
15:02 - mouse button up so when we release the
15:05 - button again we want this to be the left
15:07 - mouse button well then we want to set n
15:10 - swipe equal to our current Mouse
15:12 - position so we can go in here and create
15:14 - a private vector to called n swipe and
15:19 - we can set n swipe equal to input dot
15:23 - Mouse position and let's also as soon as
15:28 - we release this button start the swipe
15:31 - so let's create some kind of swipe
15:33 - method that we call so
15:36 - will execute the swipe and let's create
15:39 - this method down here that's called
15:40 - swipe and in here we'll for now just
15:43 - throw the debug that lay log statement
15:46 - that kind of outputs our start swipe and
15:50 - our end swipe so let's put in our start
15:54 - swipe here + and I'm just gonna separate
15:57 - this with its simple here at vertical
16:00 - bar plus our end swipe so now if we go
16:05 - in here and hit play and we then start
16:09 - to swipe say here and move up and
16:13 - release we can see that the first swipe
16:16 - had an x value of 171 and the seven
16:20 - second one had an x value of 160 so we
16:22 - moved a tiny bit to the left on the X
16:24 - but on the Y here or yeah on the Y here
16:29 - we started at 400 and we moved all the
16:31 - way up to 570 so what we can do now in
16:34 - order to get kind of the difference
16:36 - between the two positions or which means
16:40 - also an arrow pointing from one to the
16:42 - other is subtract the two so instead of
16:46 - debug data logging start swipe and in
16:48 - swipe let's put in here a vector to
16:53 - swipe and we'll just call this our swipe
16:57 - and we'll set this equal to our start
17:00 - swipe is it starts wipe - n swipe a - B
17:06 - is B minus a sub this is n swipe - start
17:12 - swipe so we're simply subtracting these
17:16 - two vectors and now in our debug
17:18 - deadlock we simply throw out our swipe
17:20 - so now we should see that if we restart
17:25 - and move up here and release you can see
17:30 - that on our X again we moved a tiny bit
17:33 - to the left but on our Y we moved a
17:35 - whole lot upwards so now we have an idea
17:39 - of where we are swiping and we can do
17:41 - this on on the X as well so let's try
17:43 - and move horizontally here and you can
17:45 - see we moved a great deal on the X and
17:47 - only a tiny bit on the Y and
17:49 - we do a angled swipe here you can see
17:54 - that we move well somewhat the same
17:57 - amount on the X&Y call so what we can
18:01 - now do with this is use it to apply a
18:03 - force to our knife we can simply go in
18:05 - here and say add or RB add force and we
18:09 - could theoretically just put in our
18:11 - swipe here and that would be fine we
18:14 - probably also want to go in and adjust a
18:15 - force mode to impulse and now you should
18:19 - see that when we hit play and try and
18:22 - add this force our knife just disappears
18:27 - and you can see on the position here
18:28 - that it's traveling really really
18:31 - quickly and that's because the numbers
18:33 - that we're dealing with currently are
18:34 - pretty freakin big because our mouse
18:39 - position is in screen coordinates and
18:42 - screen coordinates are just pixels so if
18:45 - our screen is 1920 by 1080 and we swipe
18:49 - from one side of the screen to another
18:52 - on the width we're going to apply a
18:54 - force of 1920 and that's a very big
18:58 - force for a knife with a mass of 1 so
19:02 - what we'll do instead is we don't want
19:03 - this to be dependent on on our current
19:07 - resolution so what we'll do instead is
19:09 - going here is and use camera dot Maine
19:14 - dot screen to viewport points and the
19:20 - cool thing about this is that it
19:21 - converts from screen space into viewport
19:25 - space and viewport space is cool because
19:27 - it doesn't go from depending on
19:30 - resolution but it goes between 0 and 1
19:33 - or is it negative 1 and 1 now it's 0 & 1
19:38 - so this makes everything a whole lot
19:41 - better and easier to manage so if you
19:44 - only swipe a tiny bit it's going to be a
19:46 - very small number and if you swipe the
19:47 - whole way or the whole screen it's going
19:49 - to be 1 so we'll do that with both both
19:52 - with the start swipe here and with the
19:54 - end swipe and if we just try and debug
19:58 - that lock this actually debug that lock
20:00 - our swipe
20:02 - you should see now that the numbers
20:04 - wicked are much more manageable so let's
20:07 - try and swipe up here and you can see
20:09 - that's a swipe of 0.2 and if we swipe
20:12 - more we can see that's the swipe of 0.9
20:14 - and if we swipe the whole screen that's
20:17 - a swipe of 1 cool so now we can easily
20:21 - control this by simply multiplying this
20:23 - with some force
20:25 - well bearable so let's go up here and
20:27 - create a public float force and default
20:31 - this to something like 5 and then down
20:33 - here when we swipe we multiply that with
20:36 - our current force variable cool so now
20:39 - we should see that if we go in here and
20:41 - hit play and we swipe upwards yay we're
20:46 - gonna actually move our knife you also
20:49 - see that if we swipe to the right our
20:51 - knife moves to the right and if we swipe
20:54 - to the left our knife moves to the left
20:57 - so now we can actually shoot it around
21:00 - our level pretty cool so the next thing
21:05 - that we want to do is apply some
21:09 - rotation to our knife because right now
21:12 - when we start swiping here well our
21:17 - knife kind of doesn't do much it's not
21:20 - until it collides with something in our
21:21 - environment that it actually starts
21:23 - rotating we don't want that we want to
21:25 - apply a rotation every time our knife
21:28 - leaves the ground and I had a look at
21:31 - flippy knife and how they did this
21:33 - because there are many ways of doing
21:34 - this with different levels of finesse
21:36 - you could apply a constant torque which
21:40 - means that you could just apply the same
21:43 - amount of rotation in the same direction
21:44 - every time and I believe that's actually
21:47 - what they're doing I don't know if it's
21:49 - in the same direction but it I think
21:51 - it's at least with the same amount of
21:53 - rotation or I could have the speed of
21:55 - the rotation depend on the force but I
21:59 - think that's unnecessarily complicated
22:02 - what I want to do is simply go in here
22:04 - and hit RB dot add torque use this to
22:08 - add angular force and in here we can
22:11 - simply input 0 on the X 0 on the Y and
22:16 - then we
22:16 - give it a force on the Z and just like
22:19 - we defined a force before let's also
22:21 - define a torque again we want to change
22:24 - the force mode to impulse and that
22:27 - should actually be it so we can go up
22:28 - here and create a public float call it
22:32 - torque and set it equal to say 20 I
22:36 - think that's going to need to be a tiny
22:38 - bit bigger so if we now hit play we
22:42 - should see hey we're applying a force to
22:46 - our knife I think I want to kind of have
22:48 - it go in the opposite direction but it
22:51 - is working so let's do just go in here
22:53 - and add a minus in front of the torque
22:55 - and should actually already have the
22:59 - gameplay working that's awesome great so
23:04 - the next thing that I want to kind of
23:05 - configure here is the gravity because
23:08 - right now our knife flips really really
23:11 - quickly and the flippy knife game at
23:14 - least takes some more time for the knife
23:15 - to be in air so to change that all we
23:18 - need to do is go into edit project
23:22 - settings physics and in here we simply
23:26 - need to go and adjust our gravity I'm
23:28 - just gonna set it to something like
23:30 - negative point 3 or negative 3.5 let's
23:34 - try that and that's a whole lot better
23:38 - so now the knife actually has some
23:39 - travel time and it kind of allows you to
23:43 - see and waiting excitement to find out
23:46 - where your knife current is cool so now
23:51 - that we are able to flip our knife we
23:55 - also want some way of kind of detecting
23:57 - hit because right now it doesn't matter
24:00 - what side the knife oh it doesn't matter
24:03 - what size didn't Jesus Christ
24:06 - the language it doesn't matter what side
24:09 - the knife lands on it's always just
24:12 - going to lay down flat in the easiest
24:14 - position possible and we don't want this
24:16 - we want the on tip of the knife here to
24:18 - be pointy and we want it to be able to
24:20 - pierce materials so what we'll do is go
24:23 - into our knife and we'll add another
24:26 - Collider at the top of our knife that's
24:28 - it add component and let's
24:30 - create a circle or a sphere collider
24:33 - here so by default this is going to be
24:36 - huge and we'll definitely take the
24:38 - radius here and make it a whole lot
24:39 - smaller let's do something like 0.01 and
24:43 - we can then try and move it up on the Y
24:46 - here I'm gonna hold down alt to allow me
24:48 - to fine-tune and we can try and place
24:53 - this at the tip I'm actually going to
24:56 - make it tiny bit bigger as well and
24:59 - place it around there alright so if we
25:04 - try to use this now it's not really
25:08 - going to make a difference because our
25:10 - collider is not set as trigger so it's
25:13 - really just acting like another Collider
25:15 - in our physics system but if we go in
25:17 - here and set this to trigger we can then
25:20 - go into the knife a knife script and we
25:23 - can have something happen whenever our
25:25 - trigger collides with another object
25:27 - we'll do that using void on trigger
25:30 - enter and it definitely did some
25:34 - autocomplete on me there so well we
25:38 - don't want to do this yet cool so when
25:41 - we somewhere our trigger hits another
25:43 - Collider what we could do is go into our
25:46 - rigidbody and set the is kinematic
25:49 - variable to true and what this will do
25:53 - is simply freeze the rotation and
25:55 - position of a rigid body because the
25:57 - kinematic rigid body won't move unless
25:59 - it's told to move so if we're going here
26:02 - and hit play we should see that if we're
26:05 - able to land our knife whoo it sticks
26:09 - into our block and you can see on the
26:11 - rigidbody that it now says is kinematic
26:13 - of course now we can move it again but
26:16 - this is just a matter of going in here
26:18 - and whenever we start swiping we simply
26:20 - want to set our P that is kinematic back
26:24 - to false and that should be all so now
26:28 - when we hit play here we are able to
26:30 - play around with it and as soon as it
26:32 - hits a block it sits or it it sticks to
26:37 - the block and when we then try and swipe
26:39 - again we can see that we unhook it call
26:44 - so now we actually have the fundamental
26:46 - mechanic of this game in place next
26:50 - thing is simply just adding different
26:52 - states so you can have a success states
26:54 - where it hits the block that's kind of
26:56 - what we have now and then you can have a
26:58 - a not so successful state where we hit
27:02 - the shaft or we don't land on the wooden
27:05 - block and then we kind of restart the
27:07 - level or at least reset the position of
27:09 - our knife I'm also just going to take
27:11 - the knife here and set the start
27:13 - rotation to be opposite so I'm just
27:16 - gonna rotate it by 180 on the Z here
27:18 - just so that right when we start the
27:21 - game it's going to insert itself into
27:22 - the block like that I just like that
27:25 - feeling a lot better cool so this is
27:28 - actually already looking much much
27:30 - better and it's already fun to play
27:33 - around with
27:33 - so let's now have it so that when the
27:35 - knife lands or it doesn't land on the
27:38 - pointy side so when you fail a flip it's
27:41 - just going to reset the level to do this
27:43 - will simply go in here and use another
27:45 - callback method on collision enter so
27:48 - this means that we hit with our normal
27:50 - Collider the box Collider and not with
27:53 - our trigger and I'm just gonna go in
27:55 - here and remove the private and again I
27:57 - don't want to collect any information
27:58 - just yet and I'm just gonna throw out a
28:01 - debug that log statement here is saying
28:03 - we hid mmm I'm just gonna throw it fail
28:11 - actually so now if we hit play we should
28:15 - see that this only triggers when we
28:17 - actually hit with the wrong side of the
28:19 - knife and you can see this is not quite
28:23 - the case the reason why might be the how
28:26 - you've set up some of your colliders we
28:28 - might have a case where they both hit
28:30 - and that's definitely not something you
28:32 - you want you can fix that by simply
28:35 - going to your knife and try and space
28:37 - out the colliders a bit more I'm just
28:39 - gonna go in here and make sure that my
28:41 - sphere Collider is small enough that
28:44 - this won't happen and increase the
28:46 - distance definitely something like this
28:51 - and we can also easily take our box
28:53 - Collider and simply drag it down a bit
28:55 - more
28:56 - so now you know that both colliders
28:58 - aren't going to be hitting at the same
29:00 - time but we still have this weird case
29:02 - where we hit play and then as soon as we
29:04 - flip the knife okay there it actually
29:07 - didn't happen but it does happen quite a
29:09 - lot that after being stuck in the block
29:11 - and we then flip the knife let's see if
29:14 - we can get this to trigger there you go
29:17 - it prints out a message why right when
29:19 - we start flipping and that's definitely
29:22 - not behavior that we want to fix this
29:25 - what we can do is simply go into our on
29:27 - collision enter here and the first thing
29:29 - that we want to say is that if our B dot
29:31 - is kinematic well then we don't want
29:34 - anything to happen so we only want this
29:35 - to happen if we the rigid body is not
29:38 - kinematic meaning that it's currently
29:40 - flying but this doesn't fix our issue
29:43 - what we want to do is make sure that we
29:46 - can only fail flipping the knife after a
29:50 - tiny bit of time has occurred so right
29:53 - when we start flipping that doesn't
29:54 - count so we want to wait about say point
29:57 - 1 second and the easiest way to do this
30:00 - is go up here and create a private float
30:03 - and we'll call this time maybe time fly
30:14 - time start flight time start air time
30:18 - start swipe time time I don't know time
30:24 - when we started flying there we go best
30:29 - naming ever so now inside of our swipe
30:32 - we can set the time when we started
30:35 - flying equal to time time and then
30:39 - inside of our on collision enter we can
30:41 - check we're going to create a variable
30:45 - here called time in air and set this
30:50 - equal to the time when we started flying
30:53 - except we want to subtract this from our
30:56 - current time so we start swiping the
31:01 - knife starts flying we set the time at
31:05 - which this happened equal to time to
31:08 - time
31:09 - and then when the knife collides with
31:12 - something we check for the time in air
31:15 - by taking the time that we collide with
31:18 - something and subtracting the time when
31:19 - we started flying and we can then check
31:22 - if that time in air is greater than or
31:25 - equal to say 0.1 second I don't think
31:28 - that was the best way to explain it but
31:30 - I believe I got through it
31:32 - I'm sorry resume a bit slow I woke up
31:35 - with an hit with a headache today might
31:37 - be kind of mixing my terms together but
31:40 - basically what we what we're doing is
31:42 - just checking if we've been in air for a
31:45 - little while before we start colliding
31:47 - the things and if we have well then
31:52 - there's no Cheers then we've messed up
31:54 - and our knife has landed on the wrong
31:56 - side and so we can go ahead and restart
31:58 - let's create a restart method here and
32:00 - on it's let's also create the method
32:05 - down here and all we want to do in here
32:08 - is simply go and restart our level to do
32:12 - that we need a reference to court to do
32:14 - that we need to include unity engines at
32:16 - scene management and here we can simply
32:19 - call scene manager load scene and the
32:23 - scene that we want to load is scene
32:25 - manager dot active scene get active
32:30 - scene build index so basically we're
32:33 - just loading the currently loaded scene
32:35 - so restarting the level and if we try
32:39 - and save this now and hit play we should
32:42 - see that if we flip the knife and land
32:45 - on the wrong side our level restarts
32:48 - also make sure to go under file and
32:50 - build settings and remember to add your
32:52 - level here whenever you're doing any
32:54 - scene switching and also you will notice
32:56 - that if we flip and then on the wrong
32:59 - side a lighting does kind of look weird
33:02 - and again this happens all the time when
33:04 - you try and switch a scene in unity all
33:06 - you need to do is open up the lighting
33:08 - panel so go window and then lighting and
33:11 - then settings and scroll to the bottom
33:14 - here where it says auto-generate you
33:16 - need to disable that and hit generate
33:18 - lighting and that's because unity
33:20 - generates the lighting right before
33:21 - starting the scene
33:22 - and it doesn't have time to do that when
33:24 - you're switching scene and so you see a
33:26 - scene without any generated lighting but
33:28 - now that we've generated it manually and
33:30 - we then mess up oops didn't mess up that
33:34 - whew this should definitely registers so
33:38 - we probably need to decrease our time
33:41 - here a bit but we should now see that
33:44 - when we mess up lighting doesn't change
33:46 - so that's a lot better
33:48 - and let's just go in here and decrease
33:51 - this time to say point zero five cool so
33:56 - that's basically everything for the
33:59 - knife flipping and kind of error
34:01 - checking except if we play now and
34:04 - actually managed to stick our knife I
34:08 - can't believe I just did that in the
34:09 - first try it did you guys see that that
34:13 - was almost like that was good so um if
34:17 - we manage to stick our knife into the
34:19 - ground object well that counts as a fail
34:22 - as well because we only want to do this
34:24 - on the wooden blocks so what we need to
34:27 - do is actually check what we're
34:28 - colliding with and we knew that in here
34:30 - we can gather some information about
34:32 - what we collided with by a-goin Collider
34:34 - and we can just call it coal I mean then
34:37 - go in here and check if coal tag is
34:43 - equal to block or wood or whatever then
34:51 - we want to set a schematic to true if
34:53 - it's not so else we simply want to
34:57 - restart so we can go in here and call
34:59 - restart and then of course we need to go
35:02 - to a wooden block and we need to set the
35:06 - tag here to wooden block so now we added
35:11 - it and we also want to we also want to
35:14 - set it there we go so if we now hit play
35:18 - and managed to I think I messed
35:24 - something up guys well best game of the
35:30 - year 2017 let's try and see so if cold
35:35 - attack is equal to
35:36 - Blagh did I did I not call to the net Oh
35:42 - wouldn't block that makes more sense
35:44 - yes yes you can stop spamming in the
35:48 - comments all right so wouldn't block it
35:50 - of course needs to be the same tag
35:52 - that's why I don't hard-code things or
35:55 - at least use control-c control-v so if
35:58 - we now try and do this I still need to
36:03 - land this shut Jesus Christ that I think
36:06 - I landed it there but you get the point
36:09 - yeah all right so that would definitely
36:11 - have stuck on to the ground except we
36:13 - created this rule so now you have to do
36:15 - it on the wood block awesome that's
36:17 - basically it I mean that's everything I
36:19 - wanted to show for this game next
36:21 - definitely add score depending on the
36:24 - amount of flips add more more blocks and
36:27 - platforms that you can jump to add more
36:29 - knives definitely play around with the
36:31 - balance a bit of course and make your
36:33 - camera follow the knife that would be
36:35 - kind of the next things that I would add
36:37 - to this game but I think this is the
36:39 - base mechanic and I think it works
36:40 - pretty well
36:41 - and yeah a lot of the stuff that I'm
36:44 - talking about here is something that
36:45 - we've covered in previous tutorials
36:46 - we've done smooth camera follow a bunch
36:48 - of times I have a separate video on that
36:50 - if you want to know how to make your
36:51 - camera follow the knife and I definitely
36:54 - trust you guys this ability to be able
36:56 - to add these sort of things if you guys
36:58 - want we can definitely um have a look at
37:03 - how to make it look a bit better like
37:05 - the example project I did before by
37:07 - adding some some effects because this
37:09 - was pretty short tutorial but let me
37:11 - know if that's something you're
37:12 - interested in the comments or in the
37:15 - chat so used to recording video and if
37:19 - not we can just switch right on to the
37:21 - QA it's it's really up to you guys so
37:23 - let me know what you want to see the
37:25 - most cool
37:30 - we actually got through it bit bit if
37:33 - you hear in there look we managed to
37:36 - let's see so yeah yeah awesome with some
37:45 - particles as well that's a good idea of
37:46 - definitely should add some particles
37:48 - Wendy and when the knife lands
37:50 - all right so definitely a lot of people
37:53 - saying that we should that we should
37:57 - check out check out some of the graphics
38:00 - here so it's actually really really easy
38:01 - what I want to do is let me go to edit
38:04 - project settings quality I want to go
38:06 - into your intends to pick select count
38:07 - to around ten decrease anti-aliasing to
38:10 - disabled and I'm also just gonna set the
38:13 - shadow resolution to very high because
38:15 - who doesn't like very high quality
38:17 - sheriffs then I'm going to go into edit
38:19 - project settings and player and here I'm
38:22 - gonna change the color space from gamma
38:24 - to Linea this is definitely going to
38:26 - change the look of your game quite a bit
38:28 - and require you to bump up the strength
38:31 - on your light so I'm going to go into
38:33 - lighting here change the ambient light
38:37 - to maybe - that might be a bit too much
38:40 - 1.5 and I'm gonna take the directional
38:43 - light here and definitely increase the
38:44 - strength on this to something like two
38:46 - then we can go and go window asset store
38:50 - and we want to search for the
38:52 - post-processing stack let's find it here
38:57 - post-processing and there by unity and
39:04 - import and it's going to start importing
39:08 - that's awesome
39:09 - that's it import here and it should be
39:12 - really quick because it's basically just
39:13 - scripts all of it there's also a lens
39:17 - flare dirt which was unreasonably large
39:21 - in earlier versions at least I don't
39:24 - know if they've kind of fixed that but
39:25 - Leinster three I believe used to be like
39:28 - twenty megabytes so really hope that
39:32 - they've decreased the size of that with
39:33 - on the new version I think they have but
39:37 - let's see alright so we have it in here
39:39 - let's just check if they've actually
39:40 - done this and dirt yes much much much
39:46 - smaller now that's good because it was
39:48 - it was bad I don't know how that slipped
39:50 - through so now we can go and create a
39:55 - post-processing profile will call this
39:57 - CC for color correction again if I'm
39:59 - going over these steps very quickly
40:00 - that's because I feel like I have
40:01 - covered them in the
40:02 - um in the how to make good graphics in
40:05 - unity video definitely check that out if
40:07 - you want to learn more about what it is
40:09 - that I'm doing but I just want to show
40:13 - how you could apply it to this project
40:15 - as well so I just disabled multisample
40:17 - into anti-aliasing and added the
40:20 - post-processing behavior I'm also going
40:22 - to change the render path to deferred
40:23 - and I'm gonna switch into the CC
40:27 - post-processing profile here I'm going
40:29 - to add a vignette I'm going to add a
40:32 - color grading and see I'm going to
40:34 - change the tone mapper to filmic and
40:36 - there we go and now I can really start
40:38 - to see the need to kind of switch around
40:40 - some of the lighting that's changed the
40:41 - post exposure to something like point
40:43 - three let's maybe also decrease the
40:45 - vignette a tiny bit something like that
40:49 - is better and now we can go in and
40:51 - adjust some of the lighting I want to
40:53 - increase ambient lighting and maybe also
40:55 - decrease or directional light here to
40:58 - 1.8 I think that's a bit better and the
41:01 - main thing main problem with this I
41:03 - think is on the cameras background color
41:05 - here let's try and definitely brighten
41:07 - this up and maybe make it a bit more
41:10 - vibrant also something like that looks a
41:12 - lot better and we're kind of starting to
41:14 - get the look that I was talking about we
41:16 - can also go in here and add ambient
41:18 - occlusion and if you want this to be
41:19 - really nice you can decrease the amount
41:21 - or the radius here and up the sampling
41:23 - and especially if you disabled down
41:26 - sampling now this is a huge performance
41:27 - cost but it will make it look a lot more
41:30 - crispy then we can go into anti-aliasing
41:32 - and just choose the fast approximate
41:33 - that will be fine we can also add depth
41:36 - of field but I don't think it's needed
41:37 - for the scene and of course bloom if you
41:39 - want the shine don't think that's needed
41:41 - needed either and finally we can add
41:45 - motion blur yes please
41:47 - so now when we hit play and kind of
41:50 - swipe on a knife here we can see that
41:52 - looking a lot more smooth then we can
41:54 - see the graphics just yeah the rendering
41:56 - just looks nicer now it looks more
41:58 - complete also we can actually swipe
42:00 - while in midair now that's just a matter
42:03 - of creating a boolean saying if we are
42:05 - in air don't allow us to swipe we can
42:07 - actually just use RP that is kinematic
42:09 - to check for that that should be a
42:11 - symbol s going into our knife script
42:13 - here and then um
42:17 - we simply check if our P that is
42:22 - kinematic is false so if it's not
42:25 - kinematic yet that means we're in air we
42:28 - can simply return out of the update and
42:30 - not do anything and now we should see
42:31 - that if we play and transcribe while in
42:35 - mid-air that shouldn't be possible and
42:38 - indeed it is not it's only once we land
42:40 - then we can actually do that so that is
42:43 - how I applied the post-processing and
42:45 - kind of got that nicely looking dingy
42:47 - this is also some of these settings
42:49 - aren't definitely not recommended on
42:51 - mobile I don't think you should do stuff
42:54 - like ambient occlusion without down
42:57 - sampling be careful these settings in
43:00 - general be careful with high quality
43:01 - shadows really think about whether or
43:03 - not you want linear and deferred I don't
43:05 - even know what the support is for that I
43:07 - haven't developed for mobile in a long
43:09 - time so I'm not gonna recommend anything
43:12 - there but this is more of a desktop
43:14 - platform look cool so yeah that's
43:18 - basically it for the tutorial I hope you
43:21 - guys enjoyed it I think it was pretty
43:23 - fun I will of course make sure to put
43:25 - all of this stuff up on github
43:27 - once we're done and with the video
43:31 - Sunday I'll make sure to have that and a
43:34 - link to that that both includes of
43:36 - course the entire project and also the
43:38 - knife model if in case for some reason
43:40 - you thought this was worth using in one
43:44 - of your projects cool so let's switch
43:46 - over to Q and a let's see here let's go
43:51 - to chat mode yes awesome and I'm also
43:56 - just going to brighten up my camera a
43:58 - tiny bit here if I can do so while it's
44:03 - right something happened there that
44:05 - wasn't supposed to happen okay that's
44:07 - better just thought I lost the camera
44:10 - there for a second
44:11 - are you guys also seeing kind of glitchy
44:15 - camera things here the framerate seems
44:18 - really low on my software I hope that's
44:21 - not on your end - because it's not
44:24 - looking too good I that was probably
44:30 - yep lots of lag okay that's great to
44:33 - know
44:33 - yeah I fixed it alright it was just a
44:35 - simple setting never trying to adjust
44:38 - settings while live streaming I guess is
44:40 - the lesson to learn here but I'm just
44:41 - gonna bump up the brightness here so
44:43 - there we go
44:44 - doesn't look like I'm stuck in a cave
44:47 - cool bring on the questions let's see
44:54 - do you consider creating a game and
44:56 - putting it on the market not right now I
45:01 - simply don't have the time but I would
45:02 - love to create a game and and put it on
45:05 - Steam or the App Store at some point
45:06 - it's definitely yeah something that I
45:09 - would like to do can you do an asset
45:11 - bundle tutorial I haven't actually used
45:13 - asset bundles for anything just yet but
45:16 - sure I would be interested in doing that
45:19 - at some point but I would definitely
45:22 - have to learn it first let's see can you
45:31 - make one tutorial in your RPG series
45:33 - showing how you can shoot fire matching
45:35 - and do burning damage over time so the
45:38 - RPG series is fairly close I don't think
45:41 - I will be releasing any more videos on
45:43 - that because I've covered all the very
45:45 - fundamental mechanics that I wanted to
45:47 - cover when studying this series and also
45:50 - all the stuff that Sebastian has
45:52 - prepared graphics for that being said I
45:56 - might do something with RPG mechanics on
45:59 - standalone videos maybe something with
46:02 - spells let's see do you have a job
46:10 - except from YouTube no YouTube is my
46:12 - full-time job and the same thing for
46:14 - Sophia so this is all we do which is
46:17 - also a good place to plug the patron
46:20 - page so if you like videos like this if
46:23 - you like live streams and if you like
46:26 - the content in general you can go to
46:27 - patreon.com/scishow our keys to support
46:30 - us with a monthly donation off your
46:32 - choosing it can be any amount we have
46:35 - some rewards to say thank you and yeah
46:40 - it's really just an awesome way to
46:42 - support us and keep the
46:43 - content going so if you want you can go
46:45 - to pitch in dark on Stark is that's
46:48 - that's kind of it really helps disco can
46:52 - you do it's a turtle on mobile controls
46:54 - maybe at some point could be fun
46:55 - have you let's see I did answer that one
46:59 - did I ever work with unreal not on a
47:02 - professional game project no but I have
47:04 - played around with it in my spare time
47:06 - definitely want to do some tutorial
47:08 - stuff on it just at some point but I
47:10 - haven't gotten around to it yet right
47:12 - now we were pretty focused on and trying
47:14 - out some of the game design related
47:15 - stuff but I definitely want to have to
47:18 - do more with it such a good engine can
47:22 - you make a tutorial on shader lab maybe
47:25 - at some point I try to stay away from
47:27 - tutorials focusing on acids because they
47:31 - so often go out of style and it kind of
47:34 - it's limited how many people are
47:36 - interested in on seeing a tutorial on a
47:38 - particular assets but maybe maybe at
47:42 - some point could you do it tutorial on
47:45 - the new playable director may be I am
47:48 - working on a tutorial on timeline I said
47:53 - it yes so that is coming up can you come
47:57 - up with a question for me to ask you
47:59 - nope can you do a tutorial with server
48:03 - download Jason and serialization so that
48:05 - is a really big request server stuff is
48:08 - not my strongest suit maybe do something
48:12 - with it at some point Jason and
48:14 - civilization is definitely on the list
48:16 - but I do already think there are some
48:17 - pretty good JSON tutorials on YouTube if
48:20 - you search for it I don't know I don't
48:26 - remember the name of the guy who did
48:28 - them but I believe it's the first ones
48:29 - that come up when you search for JSON
48:31 - and unity a really good stuff what is a
48:36 - better engine for graphics you Unreal
48:38 - Engine 4 or unity both both can do
48:43 - awesome things if you want to customize
48:45 - your graphics as much as possible choose
48:47 - unity if you want that really sort of
48:51 - standard triple-a look unreal is easier
48:54 - and faster to get that with and on we
48:57 - does have some graphical capabilities
48:59 - that unity doesn't but the same for
49:02 - unity especially when it comes to VR and
49:04 - that sort of stuff did you already make
49:07 - a video for like shortcuts in the editor
49:09 - or for vs vs s ratio studio I did make
49:14 - two videos on unity tips that you can
49:17 - check out just called top unity tips
49:19 - that's kind of shortcuts and nice to
49:22 - know things so yeah but I could do more
49:26 - if you guys want can you make a VR game
49:33 - tutorial I don't have a VR headset not
49:35 - right now let's see can you can you do
49:43 - it tutorial about animation depends on
49:45 - what you mean by animation I'm not a
49:46 - good animator like not at all I'm going
49:51 - to make a flight simulator series
49:52 - because I'm having trouble with it yeah
49:54 - I get you match flight simulators are
49:57 - really really math heavy and physics
49:58 - heavy and it's not the easiest thing in
50:01 - the world to create especially because
50:02 - you need to load in real world data
50:07 - which is hard and you need actually you
50:12 - need it recently partnered up with
50:16 - another company doing doing some
50:19 - geospatial data stuff that you should
50:21 - definitely check out but I don't think
50:22 - it's something I'll be doing a tutorial
50:23 - on right now might do something with
50:26 - flight mechanics can you make a series
50:31 - on a tycoon game I love tycoon games
50:33 - there's so fun and they're definitely
50:34 - also fun to make very system heavy but
50:37 - really cool maybe do something with it
50:40 - at some point might do something for a
50:42 - Ludum diary actually I'll have to think
50:45 - about that the way that's great thank
50:48 - you send you outside so that's awesome
50:51 - what's my favorite game that's such a
50:55 - hard question to answer and I can never
50:58 - do it the games that I've played the
51:00 - most are probably well the for craft
51:03 - counter-strike yes
51:05 - modern warfare 2 yes that's that's
51:07 - honest I'm not proud of it but I had a
51:09 - lot of fun with that game
51:11 - and yeah that's probably the most played
51:15 - games I've played so much Garry's Mod as
51:18 - well that's that's just such a fun game
51:21 - to play around with it
51:22 - so you have a tutorial about particles I
51:25 - don't think I have one dedicated to
51:27 - particles and I definitely would like to
51:29 - change that it's on the list
51:31 - am I still playing with the four craft I
51:33 - don't have an active subscription right
51:35 - now but I do have a level of 100
51:36 - characters so sometimes it depends on
51:40 - what month you ask did I enter this new
51:43 - room dari no bummed about it and I it
51:48 - looks like I won't be able to
51:49 - participate in the next one either
51:51 - because it's on top of three mag and I'm
51:52 - going to Dreamhack so that's but I have
51:57 - created a game in my spare time that I'm
51:59 - making a making of video for so hope
52:02 - that you are going to enjoyed that
52:03 - that's coming up is it actually over no
52:07 - but the tutorial part is what is the
52:10 - next tutorial that is I don't remember
52:16 - what is if we have schedules here let me
52:19 - I don't remember
52:20 - oh sorry who's that girl behind it said
52:25 - she sits over there and that's a fear
52:27 - she's the moderator and my lovely
52:31 - girlfriend have you published on the
52:33 - Play Store nope
52:36 - can you make an ad network comparison
52:39 - video I'm sorry that's too specific I
52:43 - don't think so
52:44 - any idea how you would implement an
52:45 - object spawning in 3d in this runner
52:50 - sure check out the I think you can just
52:56 - use the wave spawner tutorial that I did
52:59 - and kind of just do something similar it
53:04 - really depends on how you set it up but
53:05 - check out the wave spawner in if you
53:07 - want to learn about how to spawn objects
53:09 - at burn time will you publish a tutorial
53:14 - on youtube all the time including this
53:18 - one will you post any videos on
53:20 - procedural levels I have done a tiny bit
53:23 - of procedural generation but it was
53:25 - very little and I definitely want to do
53:27 - more with it but I also think that are
53:30 - really really really really good videos
53:32 - on procedural generation already
53:34 - especially it's the best in Lake the guy
53:36 - that I collaborated with to do the RPG
53:39 - tutorial series has a lot of stuff and
53:41 - procedural generation check him out what
53:47 - do I prefer to your 3d I actually don't
53:49 - know the answer to that question I think
53:51 - my go-to is often 2d stuff because I
53:54 - feel like I'm better at 2d art that I'm
53:56 - am at modeling but when it comes to just
54:00 - game making in general I feel they're
54:02 - both really really fun I always try and
54:05 - choose the one that's simplest for me
54:09 - depending on the scope of the project so
54:12 - whatever I think is going to be easier
54:14 - to make is what I normally choose will
54:20 - you ever redo the survival game series
54:21 - it's outdated
54:22 - I know it's outdated I'm sorry thank you
54:26 - to all the people who've watched it it
54:27 - was an amazing experience creating the
54:30 - Survival Series and watching it grow
54:32 - from pretty much nothing to actually a
54:35 - pretty big series and I think the first
54:37 - video has over a million views and
54:39 - that's insane and I don't think I will
54:41 - able will ever redo it I might do
54:44 - something on survival games but I don't
54:46 - think I will do a direct remake simply
54:49 - because I switch away from the huge
54:52 - amount of tutorials in one series format
54:55 - I mean that series was so long and I
54:58 - couldn't see myself doing that once more
55:00 - but could definitely deduce do something
55:03 - with with survival games again or the
55:07 - fantasy style which is kind of
55:09 - transition to its English my favorite or
55:12 - in my native language no it's Danish and
55:15 - I think that's kind of I'm kind of
55:18 - struggling with the English today again
55:21 - I had a headache earlier and kind of
55:23 - mumbles everything together I'll
55:26 - probably be better tomorrow
55:28 - definitely not my native native language
55:31 - I do kind sometimes catch myself
55:33 - thinking in English that helps I guess
55:38 - we'll continue working with flippy knife
55:39 - no I don't think I will continue this
55:41 - project this is just a one-off for you
55:42 - guys to continue with and if you make
55:44 - something cool that they definitely
55:45 - shared with me on Twitter at practice 3
55:47 - definitely do that
55:49 - I really encourage you to do that more I
55:51 - love seeing what you guys make um when
55:56 - did I start programming that's a lot of
55:57 - years back
55:59 - that's probably seven years back I don't
56:01 - know estimate in unity at least are you
56:09 - going to do some voxel stuff that's kind
56:12 - of in the same category as procedural
56:13 - generation in general check out the best
56:15 - in Lake and then maybe I will do
56:18 - something at some point can I move a
56:20 - character with nav mesh agent using
56:22 - arrow keys yes of course don't
56:26 - necessarily see why you would do that
56:28 - that would be better to just the whole
56:32 - idea with nav mesh agents is that they
56:35 - find the path and you don't directly
56:37 - control them can you make that would be
56:41 - better to just do using a rigid body and
56:43 - then adding some forces depending on
56:44 - which way you press and then having
56:46 - everything physics enabled can you make
56:48 - a tutorial on saving in game changes to
56:50 - these scenes so that's actually a good
56:53 - idea and and I definitely want to do
56:55 - more with civilization and saving I do
56:58 - have a video on creating a high score
57:01 - which show us how to use player pref to
57:05 - store data and that oh oh when you say
57:12 - saving in game changes to the scene you
57:14 - mean when you when you change things and
57:17 - then stop playing I think that's what
57:20 - you mean I just realized I think there's
57:23 - a plucking on the asset store for that
57:25 - actually but I don't imagine doing a
57:30 - video on it right now how did I learn
57:33 - programming tutorials and practice and a
57:36 - bit of advice from friends and to books
57:41 - can you do a card game tutorial like how
57:43 - stone or at least a tutorial to
57:45 - drag-and-drop I would love to do
57:47 - something with card games at some point
57:48 - I think it looks super fun to do and
57:50 - I've always been a huge Amira
57:52 - huh stone and the development team I
57:54 - think they get way too much flame
57:59 - compared to what an amazing game they've
58:02 - actually created I think creating
58:04 - something like that in unity requires
58:06 - skill and a whole lot of it and
58:09 - dedication and I think has done in
58:11 - general is a really really beautiful
58:12 - game and it flows so well and it's
58:15 - supported on so many platforms I am
58:17 - really impressed with how stone in
58:18 - general so trying to do something
58:20 - similar could be really really fun can
58:23 - you make it to turn on how to make
58:24 - mission for your game I'm sorry I don't
58:26 - understand the question say hello in
58:29 - Danish Danish please or anything hi yeah
58:33 - that's there I'm sorry to disappoint you
58:37 - can you make an application that uses
58:39 - real-world data maybe do you talk
58:43 - English at home and not really actually
58:47 - sometimes Sophia and I just switch to
58:48 - English but that's mostly for jokes will
58:52 - you continue to your c-sharp tutorial
58:54 - maybe at some point if I find a subject
58:56 - that I think I need to cover do you type
59:00 - with all 10 fingers yes and I think
59:05 - we're kind of nearing the end here guys
59:06 - so find the questions and we can wrap up
59:10 - the stream and I will make sure to
59:11 - upload everything and make everything
59:13 - ready and I will of course have the full
59:15 - thing available on on Sunday so final
59:18 - questions and we'll wrap this bad boy up
59:20 - I still have some work to do today after
59:23 - this dream so that's that's kind of whoa
59:25 - I just flash the lights who have you
59:29 - ever considered to join the unity team
59:33 - well I first of all that's not only up
59:38 - to me but I have been in contact with
59:41 - unity and I a lot of the guys there and
59:44 - I think they're all really nice and I
59:45 - think unity seems like a great company
59:47 - to work at so maybe at some point in the
59:49 - future but right now even if I got the
59:53 - offer I probably wouldn't because I
59:57 - think this is so so much fun and so
59:59 - interesting but these sorts of things
60:00 - change all the time and Who am I to say
60:03 - what's going to happen in the future
60:05 - um thank you so much to all the guys we
60:09 - appreciate the tutorials that's awesome
60:10 - thank you for the kind words you guys
60:12 - really Rock have you ever made your own
60:14 - game engine yeah I've made made a few um
60:17 - they weren't good and I didn't get very
60:20 - far with them but I have definitely
60:22 - tried making my own engines both in C++
60:24 - and in Java and have you ever considered
60:29 - working with a team to create a game
60:31 - yeah that would be really fun to do and
60:33 - if I didn't spend so much time on these
60:36 - videos and this channel that's probably
60:38 - what I would be doing but I think right
60:40 - now this is more important for me and
60:43 - final question final question this needs
60:53 - to be a good one guys we're wrapping it
60:56 - up um let's see I need a good one guys
61:03 - give me one final final final question
61:11 - why haven't you published any game yet
61:15 - okay so that's the final question I have
61:23 - published Ludum dare games now but why I
61:27 - haven't published a game - to steam or a
61:30 - larger game that I've been working for
61:32 - on for a longer time that would be
61:35 - simply time constraints I have tried
61:38 - creating games on the side while doing
61:40 - these videos but it's simply too taxing
61:42 - and I can't really seem to get it to the
61:47 - point where I feel like this is
61:48 - something that I could charge for and
61:50 - this is something that deserves to be on
61:52 - this team or or iOS Store or the Google
61:55 - Play Store or whatever so that would
61:58 - simply be it it's simply because this is
62:00 - what I've been doing for the last five
62:01 - years and it takes up a lot of time and
62:04 - also I've been undergoing education and
62:06 - everything so I really haven't had the
62:08 - time to dedicate myself to a game
62:09 - project for whatever amount of time it
62:12 - would take between a half year and five
62:14 - years so yeah time
62:18 - all right that's the final question but
62:21 - I really want to do one in the future I
62:22 - don't want to sound all depressed about
62:24 - it stuff all right thank you so much for
62:28 - all the question guys you you're just
62:30 - awesome and I had a really fun time with
62:33 - this this livestream and thank you so
62:35 - much for all of the nice support on the
62:37 - videos recently they've been doing
62:38 - really good really well and I'm really
62:41 - excited to see that it really keeps the
62:43 - fear and I going when we see a lot of
62:45 - people liking and all the positive
62:47 - comments and and just seeing that you're
62:49 - watching the videos so thank you so much
