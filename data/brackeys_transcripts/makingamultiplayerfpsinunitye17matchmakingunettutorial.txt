00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus everyone
00:04 - welcome to video number 17 on making a
00:06 - multi-player fierce in unity this video
00:08 - is going to be very short but very very
00:10 - important we are going to be talking
00:12 - about matchmaking and how you can
00:14 - connect players over the Internet
00:16 - instead of just running multiple clients
00:18 - on one computer as we've done so far
00:21 - so finally you will be able to send the
00:23 - game to your friends and play with them
00:25 - wherever they are also on the local
00:27 - network of course so it's it's very easy
00:30 - to set this up there for this short
00:32 - video but I will be explaining a bit
00:34 - about how it works and some of the
00:36 - pricing stuff so yeah without further
00:39 - ado let's jump right into today's video
00:41 - so you can see that I'm here in unity
00:43 - and the window that we want to find is
00:46 - on the window and then services and I
00:49 - like to dug it over here by the
00:50 - inspector panel and the first thing that
00:53 - we want to do here is select an
00:55 - organization if you haven't created one
00:56 - of those you can go ahead and do it I
00:59 - believe it will prompt you to do that
01:01 - and I'm just going to select brackets
01:04 - here and then I'm going to select create
01:06 - in order to create the unity project ID
01:08 - and that's because any services that
01:12 - includes the multiplayer I API it
01:16 - includes stuff like analytics cloud
01:19 - builds adds all of that on that unity
01:23 - provides needs to be linked with your
01:25 - project and it does that through a unity
01:28 - project ID and that's what we're going
01:30 - to be creating here or if you already
01:32 - have one set up you can click that
01:34 - button there and type it in so I'm going
01:36 - to hit create here and now it's
01:38 - basically done exactly that you can see
01:40 - I've access to ads analytics cloud build
01:43 - all of that stuff and then the
01:45 - multiplayer tab down here and that's why
01:48 - we're going to go down and click that
01:51 - and you can say see that it loads just
01:54 - for a moment here and then you can see
01:56 - your configuration overview and
01:58 - currently it says that there's no
01:59 - configuration presence and what we can
02:03 - do to change this assembly hit go to
02:05 - dashboard we also have some other things
02:08 - we can do in here such as go to the
02:10 - Settings tab if you want to rename your
02:13 - magic name change the organization or
02:15 - unlined unlink the project from the
02:18 - unity project so that's that's all
02:23 - settings that you have access to you
02:26 - cannot delete your unity project ID in
02:28 - here but you can do that through the
02:30 - dashboard up here so let's go onto
02:32 - multiplayer and hit go to dashboard and
02:35 - it's going to open this up enjoy on
02:37 - default web browser in my case that's
02:39 - Google Chrome so here we have it and
02:42 - it's going to ask you to set this up and
02:44 - we do this by first specifying the
02:46 - maximum amount of players that we are
02:49 - set a room for per room so in a lobby I
02:53 - want to have maybe a maximum of 16
02:56 - players so I'm going to type in 16 here
02:59 - and hit save and we can basically change
03:01 - this at any point so it's not really
03:03 - important just choose a number that's
03:06 - big enough for you and you can see you
03:08 - can change it very quickly right here
03:11 - then we have this statistic called the
03:13 - CCU usage CCU means concurrent users and
03:17 - it's something that we often talk about
03:19 - when talking about network games and it
03:22 - basically means the total amount of
03:25 - users that are on your game at any given
03:28 - time and of course this is going to vary
03:30 - depending on the day and the time of day
03:33 - and over the life cycle of your or the
03:37 - lifetime of your game but when I'm
03:40 - billing or when calculating how much
03:43 - you're going to pay on any kind of
03:46 - server for any kind of service you like
03:49 - to kind of predict how many concurrent
03:52 - users you're going to need or how much
03:55 - room you're going to need for X amount
03:57 - of concurrent users and this here should
04:00 - show you with maybe a bit of error how
04:03 - many users are currently on the game and
04:05 - of course we haven't loaded up this game
04:07 - anywhere so there's currently no
04:09 - concurrent users on there you can also
04:11 - see that my global CCU limit meaning the
04:14 - at all or the maximum amount of people
04:17 - that can be on the game at any time is
04:19 - 200 that's because I have unity Pro if
04:21 - you have the default a unity version
04:24 - you're going to have
04:25 - a number of 20 here and this is only for
04:29 - when developing your game it to amount
04:33 - of 20 people is going to be fine this is
04:35 - only for testing on a few computers so
04:37 - you're not going to need any more than
04:39 - that but when you act actually publish
04:42 - the game then you want to go in here
04:44 - under activate live mode live mode you
04:47 - can see here is for multiplayer projects
04:49 - that are about to be publicly released
04:50 - to end-users so that means that when you
04:53 - want to actually share this with the
04:55 - world and it's no longer in the arm in
04:59 - the development phase but maybe in the
05:03 - testing phase such as where the access
05:05 - and beta or just release then you're
05:08 - going to go in here and activate it and
05:10 - from there on out you're going to be
05:13 - paying for how much traffic you use and
05:15 - the reason for this is because unit
05:17 - servers are expensive and unity have set
05:21 - up some servers and that does
05:22 - matchmaking that means they connect user
05:25 - setup rooms and all of that stuff and
05:28 - also relay servers that make sure that
05:32 - they connect that when a client connects
05:34 - it connects to unity servers first and
05:37 - then they go from Unity servers to what
05:39 - every other client that you want to
05:40 - communicate with and it does this to
05:43 - avoid problems with firewall and net
05:46 - configuration and that kind of stuff so
05:48 - that it just works all of this stuff can
05:51 - be done manually you can do this on your
05:54 - own
05:55 - however it's actually kind of difficult
05:57 - and if you have never played around with
05:59 - service before and you find the stuff
06:02 - that I show you in this video to be on
06:03 - may be kind of difficult
06:06 - I wouldn't recommend our beginning with
06:08 - that yet I mean this kind of stuff can
06:11 - be fairly advanced it can definitely be
06:13 - done of course it can be taught if you
06:15 - if you really want to get into it do
06:18 - that but it's not something that you
06:20 - just do overnight so and that's why
06:23 - unity provides this and I definitely
06:25 - recommend that you are use it so let's
06:28 - look a bit on pricing shall we so here
06:31 - you have the unity services page and you
06:36 - can see that it says here that it's
06:38 - backed by you
06:38 - with unity matchmaker servers and the
06:41 - unity relay servers so that was what I
06:43 - was talking about you can see that the
06:45 - personal Edition includes 20 CCU for
06:48 - multiplayer development and again this
06:50 - is only on the development and includes
06:52 - 200 for the professional Edition so
06:56 - unity charges 0.49 on dollars per
06:59 - gigabyte are used by the Unity
07:03 - matchmaker and relay servers and only
07:06 - those all of the other traffic doesn't
07:08 - matter and you can see here that they
07:11 - have made a tool to estimate the monthly
07:14 - bill that you're going to have and this
07:16 - is very much an estimate things can vary
07:19 - it's very hard to predict how many
07:21 - concurrent users you are going to have
07:23 - how many messages they will send how
07:25 - much how large these are messages are
07:29 - and all that stuff but it's here so if
07:32 - you have an idea of what this is going
07:34 - to be you can check it out for now I
07:36 - would just worry about building the game
07:38 - and seeing if you can you can actually
07:41 - turn it into something that's worth
07:44 - publishing and if you do then it's maybe
07:47 - time to look into this kind of stuff so
07:49 - but it's definitely here and you should
07:52 - definitely read up on different
07:54 - alternatives to publishing your game
07:57 - online it's it's it's a whole world out
07:59 - there good so that's how unity is
08:02 - multiplayer system works and how they're
08:03 - matchmaking works and if we go back into
08:05 - unity now we can refresh our
08:07 - configuration and it's going to list
08:09 - here the same information that we had on
08:12 - in the chrome tab here so I have a pro
08:14 - subscription plan with 200cc you limit
08:18 - and we're currently using serial and
08:21 - what we basically able to do now is if
08:24 - you go into our network manager we don't
08:26 - need to change a single thing here
08:28 - instead we can simply go ahead and hit
08:30 - play and then instead of using LAN host
08:32 - online client we go and enable the
08:34 - matchmaker there and unity now can
08:38 - create an internet match meaning a room
08:41 - for people to join and then it can of
08:45 - course find an internet match and it's
08:48 - really that easy to you so you type in a
08:51 - real name you
08:51 - create then you find and it will connect
08:54 - you to one of them and you can just um
08:56 - you can just choose to connect to the
08:58 - correct room and everything works of
09:01 - course this our UI is very temporary and
09:04 - I definitely want to change this in an
09:06 - upcoming video so that was all we needed
09:08 - to do what I'm going to do now is simply
09:10 - build this for the Mac that I have
09:14 - standing nearby and I'm going to build
09:16 - it for the Windows client here as well
09:18 - and then I'm just going to record that
09:20 - the two are connecting to each other and
09:23 - I'm going to make sure to put my Mac on
09:26 - a separate network so that you can see
09:28 - that it doesn't only work on land so
09:31 - let's do that now and of course when I'm
09:33 - building here just going to build
09:36 - settings and then I'm switching between
09:37 - Windows and Mac and then I'm just
09:40 - hitting build and choosing a place for
09:42 - that to happen so that's all I'm doing
09:45 - if you don't have the Mac OS X here
09:47 - you're going to need to re R run the
09:49 - Installer and choose it as a installable
09:53 - component so you have the ability to
09:55 - choose whether or not you want to be
09:57 - able to export to Mac and so if you
09:59 - haven't chosen that you should go ahead
10:01 - and rerun the installer so I'll see you
10:03 - in a little bit
10:04 - so as you can see I've set up my Mac
10:06 - alongside my Windows computer and I'm
10:08 - just now creating a test Lobby on the
10:10 - Mac then I'm switching to the window
10:12 - hitting fine internet match and then I'm
10:15 - choosing the lobby that we just created
10:17 - and that should bring the two players
10:19 - inside of the same room and you can see
10:22 - that all of our network code is working
10:24 - so that was pretty much it for this
10:26 - video I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see
10:27 - you in the next one
