00:00 - in this video we'll have a look at how
00:01 - you can use unity snoot 2d animation
00:03 - tools to easily rig and animate your 2d
00:06 - character inside of unity the cool thing
00:07 - about this workflow compared to frame by
00:09 - frame animation is that it's extremely
00:12 - flexible and fast to work with since you
00:14 - don't have to leave the editor to create
00:16 - new animations you can do so on the fly
00:18 - such a prepared sprite for animation
00:20 - there are a few steps that we need to go
00:22 - through the first step is to create the
00:23 - bones that will make up our character
00:25 - will later use these bones to control
00:27 - our character when animating second step
00:29 - is to bind these bones to our sprite so
00:32 - that the sprite will stretch and Bend to
00:34 - follow our bones here generate some
00:36 - geometry around the sprite and define
00:37 - what parts of the geometry correspond to
00:39 - what bone the third step is to add iCade
00:42 - to our character like e stands for
00:44 - inverse kinematics and it's a way to
00:46 - make it easier to animate our character
00:47 - by adding game objects that act as
00:49 - targets which the character's limbs are
00:52 - trying to reach for this way we can
00:53 - simply move around these objects and the
00:55 - character's bones will follow the
00:57 - movement organically this way we don't
00:59 - have to individually adjust bones one by
01:01 - one also this video is sponsored by
01:03 - unity and with that let's animate our
01:06 - character so the first thing that we
01:08 - need to do is make sure that we have all
01:09 - the appropriate packages installed to do
01:11 - this we'll go window and open up the
01:13 - package manager and if go to the top
01:15 - here and view all the packages in our
01:17 - project we need to make sure that we
01:19 - have 2d animation to the I K and 2d PSD
01:22 - importer if any of these are missing we
01:25 - go to the top navigate to all packages
01:27 - find the missing package and hit install
01:30 - and that's pretty much all we need to do
01:32 - for setup now the character that I'm
01:34 - going to be using here is a PSP file
01:37 - PSP is a file format that Photoshop can
01:40 - save too and the cool thing about it is
01:41 - that when we import it into unity it
01:44 - will automatically separate your
01:45 - character into parts based on the
01:47 - Photoshop layers so for this character
01:49 - I've created six layers in Photoshop one
01:52 - for each arm and leg one for the body
01:55 - and one for the head and when we import
01:57 - it in unity we immediately see all of
02:00 - the individual parts for this to work we
02:02 - need to make sure to set the sprite mode
02:04 - to multiple and check character rig in
02:07 - the import settings if you want you can
02:09 - of course use regular PNG files instead
02:11 - you just need to make sure to layout
02:13 - each
02:13 - part of your character is side by side
02:15 - like you see here now inside of unity we
02:18 - can open up our character in this sprite
02:20 - editor to do that will select sprite
02:22 - editor and this is going to bring up a
02:24 - new window I'm just gonna grab this
02:26 - window and dock it by the scene view
02:27 - here in the sprite editor you can see
02:29 - how unity has chosen to separate our
02:31 - sprite
02:32 - if something is wrong here you can of
02:33 - course always go in and manually
02:35 - configure this but in this case it looks
02:37 - fine which means that we're now ready to
02:38 - start working with our character so
02:40 - let's go to the top left corner here and
02:42 - change from sprite editor to skinning
02:44 - editor and this is the window where we
02:46 - can prepare our character for animation
02:49 - and of course the first thing that we
02:51 - need to do is create bones so I'm gonna
02:53 - go to the left here and hit create bone
02:55 - and we now click anywhere on our sprite
02:57 - to start placing a bone and we can click
02:59 - again to create a new one I'm gonna
03:01 - create two for the chest here and
03:03 - continue one up through the head
03:05 - something like that and then gonna right
03:07 - click to stop the chain and of course we
03:09 - also want some bones for the arms and
03:11 - legs and we could make these completely
03:13 - independent but that would mean that
03:15 - whenever we move the base of our
03:17 - character our arms wouldn't follow and
03:20 - that's not really something that we'd
03:22 - like so instead let's select these bones
03:24 - and delete them and let's click the bone
03:26 - closest to our arms here in my case
03:28 - that's the yellow one in this center
03:29 - here you can now see that there's this
03:31 - transparent connection going from the
03:33 - yellow bone to the one that I'm about to
03:34 - create and that's because we're about to
03:36 - parent our arm to this bone
03:39 - so let's now create the bones for our
03:40 - arm here there we go and right click to
03:42 - stop with the same bone selected let's
03:44 - do the same for the left arm there we go
03:46 - and right click again we can now select
03:48 - the bottom bone here which will go to
03:50 - the legs and again for the other leg and
03:52 - right click to close that off so now
03:54 - we've created all the bones for our
03:55 - character and a really cool thing about
03:57 - this system is that we can easily see
03:59 - how these bones relate to each other to
04:02 - do that we'll hit re parent bone and we
04:04 - now get an overview of the hierarchy of
04:06 - all of our bones
04:07 - in other words which bones are parented
04:09 - to each other and to see this we can
04:11 - really just go through and select them
04:13 - so we can see at the very root here we
04:15 - have our first bone then we have our
04:17 - second bone and this goes into both our
04:19 - head and also continues on to the arms
04:22 - and at the bottom here we have our legs
04:25 - if we want to
04:26 - our bones we can simply drag them around
04:28 - to change their connections and we can
04:30 - see the UI updating to reflect that I'm
04:33 - gonna hit control set to undo
04:34 - if you want to create more bones for
04:36 - your character you can use the split
04:37 - bone tool and this is of course going to
04:39 - allow you to split a bone in half now
04:41 - once we're done creating the bones for
04:42 - our character we can hit preview pose
04:44 - and this will allow us to try and move
04:46 - around our bones if you click and drag
04:48 - at the root of a bone it's going to move
04:51 - the bone along with all bones parented
04:53 - to it and if you click and drag further
04:54 - down it's going to rotate the bone
04:56 - around its root of course you'll notice
04:58 - that this currently only moves our bones
05:00 - our character is completely unaffected
05:02 - that's because we still have to skin our
05:04 - character in order to make him
05:06 - understand what bones correspond to what
05:08 - part of the sprite will do that in a sec
05:10 - for now we can hit reset pose to reset
05:12 - all of our bones and I just want to show
05:13 - you that if we rotate this yellow bone
05:15 - we can see that the arms rotate with it
05:18 - again because they are parented to this
05:20 - yellow bone and because the red bone
05:21 - here is at the very top of the hierarchy
05:24 - in other words this is our root bone if
05:26 - we move or rotate this all of the other
05:28 - bones are going to follow
05:29 - so let's now reset our pose and let's
05:32 - start generating some geometry for our
05:34 - character to do that we can hit Auto
05:36 - geometry and for now let's just leave
05:38 - the default settings and hit generate
05:39 - all sprites and as you can see this
05:41 - immediately creates this mesh like
05:44 - structure around our character you can
05:46 - also see that it's added a bunch of
05:48 - colors corresponding to each of the
05:50 - individual bones so the first thing that
05:52 - it's doing here is generating the mesh
05:54 - and the settings here will help you
05:55 - define the detail of this mesh so the
05:58 - greater the outline detail the more
06:00 - points will be created along the edge of
06:02 - your character so if we increase this to
06:04 - a very large number we can see that it's
06:06 - creating a bunch of points I find that
06:09 - it's often fine to leave this at a
06:10 - fairly low number subdivide is going to
06:12 - do the same thing but inside the sprite
06:14 - so it's basically just going to fill in
06:16 - more vertices if we increase this we can
06:18 - see that happening again I'm just going
06:20 - to leave this at the default if you find
06:22 - that some place of your model is
06:23 - generating in a weird way
06:25 - or if you just want to get really
06:26 - detailed you can go in and edit the
06:28 - geometry manually to do this we need to
06:31 - first double-click on the sprite that we
06:32 - would like to edit
06:33 - for example if we'd like to edit the
06:34 - head here I'll double click on it and we
06:36 - can now go in and change around points
06:38 - as we wish
06:40 - if we want to create another vertex we
06:41 - can hit create vertex and simply slap it
06:44 - on there you can also create edges split
06:46 - edges and I think you get the idea now
06:49 - once we've created some geometry for our
06:50 - model that we're satisfied with it's
06:52 - time to create the skin weights for our
06:54 - bones now before when we Auto generated
06:56 - our geometry it actually went ahead and
06:59 - did this automatically and that's
07:01 - because weights was checked off
07:03 - if you accidentally generated this
07:05 - sprite with out weights you can always
07:06 - go under Auto weights and hit generate
07:09 - and we can see that by default it
07:11 - actually does a fairly good job the head
07:14 - here is mostly influenced by the green
07:16 - bone the bottom of the left arm is
07:17 - mostly influenced by the orange bone the
07:20 - bottom of the torso is mostly influenced
07:22 - by the red bone and so on and we can
07:24 - actually now preview what this looks
07:26 - like when we start to move around bones
07:28 - to do that let's hit preview pose and
07:30 - let's just try to change around some
07:31 - bones here you can see that the arm is
07:33 - actually modifying quite nicely however
07:36 - once we start to get to the shoulder it
07:38 - does a bit of weird stretching if we
07:39 - move our head we can actually see that
07:41 - it looks fairly nice however it might
07:43 - change up this shoulder is a bit too
07:45 - much the torso also bends fairly well as
07:47 - does the right arm but again we might
07:49 - have a problem with the shoulder and the
07:51 - legs work pretty well as well now to
07:54 - manually edit this we have a few tools
07:55 - one that I found works really well is
07:58 - the possibility to change bone
07:59 - influences if we click on the bone
08:02 - influence button and select a sprite
08:04 - let's for example select the head here
08:06 - we can choose what bones will affect
08:08 - this particular sprite so in the case of
08:10 - the head here I would actually like it
08:12 - if only the green bone affected the head
08:15 - not the yellow one so I'm gonna select
08:16 - the yellow bone here and remove it from
08:19 - the list if we select the torso we can
08:21 - see that quite a few bones are currently
08:23 - affecting it I think it would be great
08:24 - if our arms and legs didn't distort the
08:26 - torso so I'm just gonna select each of
08:28 - these bones and remove them now this
08:31 - might cause some really weird stretching
08:32 - at first but that's because we need to
08:34 - regenerate the weights after doing this
08:36 - until then we can just hit reset pose
08:38 - let's also double-click our arms this
08:41 - looks good it's only affected by the arm
08:43 - bones the same thing with the right arm
08:45 - the legs are also generated nicely so
08:47 - that's pretty much all we need to do so
08:49 - if we now go to Auto weights and
08:51 - regenerate it's going to create the
08:53 - weights based
08:54 - these bone influences so if we now go to
08:56 - preview pose and try moving around our
08:58 - arms we can see that the torso is
09:00 - completely untouched we also see the
09:02 - same thing happens when we try and move
09:04 - our legs and when bending the torso
09:06 - nothing happens to our head our head
09:08 - still influences the torso a little bit
09:11 - I think it actually does that a bit too
09:13 - much and this is where we can go in and
09:15 - actually change the weights themselves
09:17 - to do that we have two tools we can
09:19 - either use weight slider this allows us
09:21 - to double click on a sprite in our case
09:23 - let's choose the torso we can then
09:25 - select a bone I mean then increase or
09:27 - decrease the influence that this bone
09:29 - has using this slider so if I pull it
09:32 - down we will see that our head now has
09:34 - less influence on the torso now I might
09:37 - have overdone that a tiny bit it's now
09:39 - only changing this part of the body so
09:41 - to change that we can go in with a
09:42 - weight brush and here again I'm double
09:45 - clicking on a sprite I'm choosing a bone
09:47 - that I want to paint with we can choose
09:49 - the hardness as well as the size of the
09:51 - brush and we can then go in and paint
09:54 - onto the individual vertices how much we
09:57 - want this bone to affect them so now if
09:59 - we go back to previewing the pose we can
10:01 - see that we might have overdone that a
10:02 - bit but you get the idea we can just as
10:04 - well go back and by holding down ctrl
10:06 - and painting we can remove influence as
10:08 - well so once you're satisfied and you've
10:10 - tried playing around with the preview
10:12 - pose and aren't seeing any weird
10:14 - stretching in your sprite we can hit
10:16 - reset pose and we are now ready to add
10:18 - it to our scene so let's take the sprite
10:20 - editor and our get to the right here and
10:22 - this step is actually ridiculously easy
10:24 - all we need to do is hit apply and we
10:27 - can then take our character and drag it
10:29 - in to our scene that's it that's
10:31 - actually all we need to do we can now
10:32 - see that inside of this object we have
10:34 - all the individual sprites as well as
10:37 - our bone hierarchy where we can go
10:39 - through and view each individual bone
10:41 - and inside of our scene view we can of
10:44 - course click and drag on these in any
10:47 - way that we would like to so you can see
10:49 - just how easy it is to really set up a
10:51 - character and start animating and the
10:53 - way that this is working is that for
10:55 - each sprite unity has gone ahead and
10:56 - created a sprite skin component and each
10:59 - one of these references of the bones
11:01 - that have control over this sprite so
11:03 - for our body here that's bone 1 2 & 3
11:06 - which is
11:07 - these three bones and if you ever want
11:09 - to go back to the default pose you can
11:11 - always hit reset bind pose for each one
11:14 - of these sprites finally we can of
11:15 - course add a case to our character in
11:17 - order to make him easier to animate
11:19 - first we need to select the base object
11:21 - well then hit add component and we'll
11:23 - search for I K manager and select I can
11:26 - manager 2d this script is not
11:28 - responsible for I key on our entire
11:30 - character for this character I think it
11:32 - would make sense to use I cave for the
11:34 - arms as well as the legs to make it
11:36 - really easy to control these parts so to
11:39 - do that we need to add four i case
11:41 - solvers and our case solver is
11:43 - responsible for doing all the
11:44 - calculations necessary on a particular
11:46 - part of our character to add an eye case
11:48 - solver we can hit the plus sign and here
11:50 - we get three different types to choose
11:52 - from which type you want to use depends
11:54 - on your situation limp is the standard
11:57 - to burn solver and this is ideal for
11:58 - posting joints such as arms and legs
12:01 - which is what we want to do in our case
12:03 - the other two chained fabric and chained
12:06 - CCD are basically solvers that can be
12:08 - used when you have more than two bones
12:10 - in a sequence the difference between
12:12 - fabric and CCD is what algorithm is
12:15 - being used to calculate the position and
12:17 - rotation of the bones if you want to
12:19 - learn more about the differences between
12:20 - the three solvers I will of course have
12:22 - a link to some documentation in the
12:23 - description now let's go ahead and
12:25 - select limb this is going to create a
12:27 - new limb solver 2d let's just rename
12:30 - this to left arm solver and any solver
12:33 - needs a target so let's go ahead and
12:35 - create one in the case of our arm here
12:37 - we can go ahead and create a new empty
12:39 - game object under bone seven which is
12:41 - our button most arm bone I'm gonna call
12:43 - this left arm target and I'm just gonna
12:46 - take my transform tool and move this to
12:48 - the end of the arm then we can select
12:51 - the left arm solver and drag in the
12:53 - target we can see that the target now
12:55 - shows up with this yellow dot here and
12:57 - if we now hit create effector we can see
12:59 - that both our target as well as our
13:02 - bones turn green that's because the limb
13:04 - solver is currently acting on these
13:06 - bones so if we go ahead and drag on our
13:09 - target we can see that the bones will
13:11 - automatically update to follow around
13:13 - this target now where did the effector
13:15 - go well this was actually generated
13:17 - under the left arm solver and it's
13:19 - called left arm solver underscore
13:21 - affector so now we simply need to repeat
13:23 - this process for the other arm as well
13:25 - as the two legs
13:30 - all right so we now have for our case
13:32 - solvers each one of them is a limb
13:34 - solver and each one of them has a
13:36 - reference to a target that is placed at
13:39 - the end of that bone chain which means
13:41 - that we can now very easily animate our
13:43 - character using these IKEA handles we
13:45 - will also see that our legs are
13:46 - currently behaving in a pretty weird way
13:49 - the reason for this is that when we're
13:50 - dealing with a limb solver we sometimes
13:52 - need to flip the direction of the I K in
13:55 - order for it to face the correct
13:57 - direction so now our character is really
14:00 - easy to animate and that's exactly what
14:02 - we're gonna do let's go to window
14:04 - animation and let's open up the
14:05 - animation window you can also hit
14:07 - control 6 to do this let's target at the
14:10 - bottom here let's select our cup and
14:12 - it's create a new animation I'm just
14:14 - gonna call this animation party let's it
14:16 - save and let's hit the red button to
14:19 - record and we can now animate our
14:20 - characters so I'm gonna start him off
14:22 - here and here here and here
14:25 - and it's also animate the head here
14:28 - there we go and let's move forward a few
14:30 - frames and let's change around the eye
14:32 - key handles and let's try and preview
14:34 - this animation we can maybe zoom out a
14:36 - bit and let's actually move these
14:38 - keyframes over let's duplicate the first
14:41 - ones and let's try and hit play there we
14:43 - go we've created our first skeletal
14:45 - animation awesome
14:47 - that's pretty much it for this video
14:48 - from here it's up to you to start making
14:50 - animations for your game if you want to
14:52 - see more about the new 2d tools there
14:54 - will be some links for the documentation
