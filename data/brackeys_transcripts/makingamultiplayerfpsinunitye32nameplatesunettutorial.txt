00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello and
00:04 - welcome to this video in creating multi
00:05 - player fits in unity today we are going
00:07 - to be creating some name plates which
00:09 - means a piece of UI that floats above
00:11 - our players head and it can pretty much
00:13 - display any kind of information our
00:15 - today we're going to be implementing the
00:17 - username of the player and the current
00:19 - amount of health the player has but you
00:21 - could easily display other stuff such as
00:23 - ammo on there or some statistics or
00:25 - whatever so really exciting video and
00:28 - let's just jump right into it so as you
00:30 - can see immunity and what I want to
00:32 - begin with is kind of just bringing our
00:34 - player in here and then sketching out
00:38 - the UI so if we just focus on our player
00:40 - right click and go to UI and then canvas
00:43 - we can create a new canvas that sits as
00:45 - a child object of the player and we want
00:48 - to change this canvas to a world space
00:50 - canvas so that it will follow our play
00:52 - around
00:53 - let's also reset the rect transform here
00:56 - in order to kind of bring it in but it's
00:58 - still huge so let's just go to the scale
01:01 - here and change that to something like
01:03 - point zero run one on all axes and hit F
01:07 - again and you can see that's much more
01:09 - manageable so now we can kind of bring
01:11 - this UI up we can switch into 2d mode
01:14 - and it will be viewed from behind but
01:15 - that's alright we'll just fix that in a
01:18 - second now we can maybe bring it down a
01:20 - tiny bit as well so under this canvas
01:23 - let's go ahead and create a new UI
01:25 - element and let's just create a text
01:27 - object and we can maybe just size this
01:30 - to fit on the size of our canvas so just
01:33 - do something like that
01:34 - and we can maybe scale it down a bit and
01:36 - it's also on center this on the
01:40 - horizontal and the vertical axis so that
01:43 - looks pretty good already and let's
01:45 - change the texture to something like
01:47 - user name just for filler and let's also
01:50 - change the color to white you could go
01:52 - in here and add a shadow or different
01:55 - kind of colors but I actually just want
01:56 - to keep it totally white I think that
01:58 - works just fine and you can see again
02:00 - here that it's currently flip so let's
02:02 - just go in and select our canvas and
02:04 - rotate it by 180 degrees so you should
02:08 - see now that our user name faces in the
02:10 - R in the right direction and
02:13 - go ahead and change the text name here
02:15 - to username and of course I also want to
02:18 - add a health bar but I think we should
02:20 - begin with the username just to get that
02:22 - working and then we can add the health
02:24 - bar in in just a second so for now I
02:27 - just want to take the canvas here and
02:28 - move it down a little bit
02:29 - just to make it look a bit better and
02:31 - that is pretty much all I want to do for
02:33 - the UI so far so what we should do now
02:36 - is add some kind of script that will set
02:38 - the username equal to the actual
02:40 - username of our player and let's do this
02:43 - by adding a new component to our canvas
02:46 - here and it's call it something like our
02:48 - player name plate and it's just a double
02:54 - click on that to open it up in visual
02:56 - studio we'll have a look at how we can
02:58 - get the user name from our player
03:00 - component so it opened up on my
03:03 - secondary monitor here I'm just going to
03:04 - drag it over and I'm also just going to
03:06 - get rid of all of the different scripts
03:08 - that we had opened before so the first
03:11 - thing that we want is a reference to a
03:12 - UI element and therefore we need to
03:14 - include Unity engine UI we also need to
03:17 - go in here and create a public of course
03:20 - we can make this a sterilized field so
03:22 - we don't need to make it public but we
03:24 - want to have a text object which is our
03:28 - user name text and we also want a
03:32 - reference to our actual player so the
03:34 - player component and let's just call
03:37 - that one player so what we could do is
03:40 - easily put this inside of the start
03:41 - method however we want to make sure that
03:44 - our player has a place user name has
03:47 - actually been said once the start method
03:49 - is called and so we have to be a little
03:51 - bit careful there because it might take
03:53 - some time for the server to link that or
03:55 - to synchronize that to all of the
03:57 - different clients and since this is
03:59 - going to be displayed on all clients we
04:01 - can't be totally sure that the start
04:03 - method will work for that we could put
04:05 - in a small delay that would work fine
04:07 - we would also kind of reference the play
04:09 - name play script with the player setup
04:11 - script so that once the player's user
04:13 - name has changed we call the function on
04:16 - this one but I think that's just going
04:17 - way overboard instead what I want to do
04:20 - is simply shoot it into the update
04:22 - method and that is of course a tiny bit
04:24 - more taxing but we're really going to
04:26 - using the update method anyways because
04:28 - we want to update our health all the
04:30 - time so we'll just include it in here
04:33 - again if you're super worried about
04:35 - performance you can go ahead and put
04:37 - that maybe on a co routine on a fixed
04:39 - loop or again synchronize it with the
04:41 - player but I think this is going to work
04:44 - just fine for our needs
04:45 - really this isn't what you should worry
04:47 - about when you talk about performance
04:49 - not for the first many hours at least
04:53 - cool so inside of our update loop we can
04:56 - simply go and say username dot username
04:59 - text text equals player and then dot
05:03 - user name and remember username is a
05:05 - variable that sits on the player it's
05:07 - just a public string and we've made sure
05:10 - to mark it as a sync variable so if we
05:12 - just find a player here you can see the
05:14 - username there and we also have it here
05:16 - and by default it just sets s loading
05:19 - and it's set through our player setup
05:22 - script and because it's a sync var
05:24 - it means that we can use it even though
05:27 - we're not on the server or we're not on
05:30 - a client we can use it from anywhere we
05:32 - don't have to worry about kind of our
05:33 - position in the whole network hierarchy
05:36 - so we can just go ahead and set it
05:38 - directly here and that should work just
05:39 - fine so again this should actually work
05:42 - right out the bat so if we just go in
05:44 - here now find our canvas where we have
05:47 - I'll play a nameplate script then let's
05:49 - actually just rename this to player
05:51 - actually let's just do name plate canvas
05:56 - we should be able to just drag in our
05:58 - username text and our player which sits
06:01 - on do the player and we should be able
06:04 - to just hit apply and delete that player
06:07 - and now when we run the game we should
06:09 - see that working so if we just go into
06:11 - our locking menu here to make sure that
06:14 - we log in with an appropriate username
06:15 - and we go through and type in something
06:18 - like test 1 2 3 test 1 2 3 which is our
06:23 - test user and it's going to login and I
06:26 - can see that someone there that's
06:27 - awesome we can host a test game and now
06:30 - we should see that it says test 1 2 3 s
06:33 - joined and if we go into the scene view
06:34 - now and find our player here you can see
06:40 - that
06:40 - have our UI element in here so that's
06:42 - awesome and it's going to follow around
06:44 - follow the player around one problem
06:47 - with this is that we if we have multiple
06:49 - players so let's say we have a player
06:51 - over here you can see that it doesn't
06:53 - look too good when we view it from this
06:55 - side and this is where we are going to
06:57 - need some kind of billboarding script
07:00 - and billboarding is basically the act of
07:02 - rotating some kind of 2d element to
07:04 - always face the camera so that no matter
07:07 - where you view it from it's going to
07:09 - look great and not well distorting and
07:12 - almost disappearing from from the side
07:15 - here so we're just simply going to
07:17 - rotate the entire arm nameplate here to
07:21 - towards on the camera that is viewing it
07:24 - and we'll do that in a second but
07:27 - firstly I really want to go ahead and
07:29 - make sure that it works in all other
07:31 - ways in terms of the functionality that
07:33 - we want to have so let's just go and
07:36 - find our main level again here let's
07:39 - drag in our player and um let's just fix
07:44 - a thing so one problem that we currently
07:46 - have with this is that if we were to go
07:49 - ahead and kill our player what would
07:51 - happen is our player would of course not
07:54 - disappear from the scene instead what we
07:56 - do is we kind of disable all of the
07:58 - components that we might that are
08:01 - visible in the scene so we basically you
08:03 - can see in here under the player we have
08:05 - this disabled on death we disabled the
08:07 - shoot we disabled these on the
08:10 - controller there and we also disabled
08:15 - these on objects here we disabled all of
08:17 - the graphics and we disabled the camera
08:20 - which means the camera itself and the
08:21 - weapons so that makes the player kind of
08:24 - disappear from the scene but we're still
08:26 - able to do some stuff behind the scenes
08:27 - and what I want to do and I just need to
08:31 - make sure that Irene abled everything it
08:33 - looks like it what I want to do is also
08:35 - disable the name play catalyst or else
08:37 - it's just going to sit there or float
08:39 - there after a player has died and that's
08:41 - going to look super weird I mean some
08:43 - some games do this and have the UI just
08:46 - sit there so you can see Oh a player
08:48 - just died there especially if you want
08:49 - to not just disable the player but maybe
08:52 - have them fall to the ground and
08:54 - have some kind of death animation then
08:56 - you probably want the UI to stay there
08:58 - but I think in our case we definitely
09:00 - want to get rid of it so basically we'll
09:02 - just go under the player script here and
09:04 - utilize the fact that we already have an
09:06 - array that we can just add another
09:09 - element to and drag in the name plate
09:11 - canvas and there we go now it's going to
09:13 - be disabled when the player dies and we
09:17 - can go ahead and hit apply on that
09:20 - awesome so now we can go ahead and add
09:23 - some health to this name plate canvas
09:25 - and in order to do this I actually want
09:28 - to utilize the fact that we've almost
09:29 - created this in the previous video under
09:32 - the player UI so let's just drag in our
09:34 - play UI here and have a look at how we
09:35 - set that up so let's shift into 2d mode
09:38 - and you can see that we have in here a
09:41 - thrust of fuel and a health bar and the
09:44 - health bar here is set up in a very
09:46 - simple way you can just copy the
09:47 - settings we have this background image
09:49 - here which we which we can see if we
09:51 - just scale this down you can see there's
09:53 - the background image it's just a tinted
09:55 - black image with a bit of transparency
09:58 - and then on top we have a colored image
10:01 - here with also a bit of transparency on
10:04 - that we simply size up and down
10:06 - depending on our health percentage and
10:09 - we also have an icon but we don't really
10:12 - need that so you could of course go
10:14 - ahead and set this up once again but
10:16 - instead I'm just going to utilize the
10:18 - fact that we already have it in here and
10:19 - just copy that by hitting ctrl C or
10:22 - command C if you're on the Mac and then
10:24 - let's duplicate it under our nameplate
10:26 - canvas and you can see that it currently
10:29 - doesn't want to go into there so let's
10:30 - just drag it under as a child
10:32 - let's also reset the rect transform so
10:35 - now if we hit F it focuses in on it and
10:38 - you can see that it is indeed here so
10:41 - let's just go into 2d and we can easily
10:43 - work with this even though it's flipped
10:44 - all we need to do is just kind of scale
10:46 - this down on the X or on the Y drag it
10:50 - down I want to scale it down even more I
10:52 - also want to get rid of that icon
10:55 - there's no reason for us to have it
10:56 - there it's very clear what this is let's
10:59 - scale it down to somewhere around there
11:01 - maybe and also maybe scale it in a tiny
11:04 - bit I don't think that's any reason for
11:06 - it to be that
11:07 - charge and I think the spacing between
11:10 - the two elements is fine so let's just
11:12 - take both of them and drag them up a bit
11:14 - let's shift out a 2d view and see how
11:18 - that looks and I think that looks really
11:19 - really cool actually so we'll just go
11:22 - with this for now and you can of course
11:24 - always spend more time styling around
11:26 - with it and I definitely recommend that
11:29 - you do so this is these tiny details are
11:32 - what kind of differentiates a pulley
11:35 - quickly made game from one that feels
11:38 - polished and ready to go so awesome so
11:42 - now that we have our health bar in here
11:43 - of course we also need to change it
11:45 - through this script so let's go into our
11:48 - name plate canvas and then our player
11:50 - name plate and let's add the
11:52 - functionality here and again it's going
11:53 - to be done the exact same way that we
11:56 - did um the health bar file player UI
11:59 - basically we just want a serialize field
12:02 - here a reference to a rect transform
12:05 - which is going to be our health bar
12:06 - field so let's call it health bar field
12:08 - and then in the update method all we do
12:11 - is set health bar field local scale
12:14 - local scale equal to a new vector3 where
12:20 - the coordinates are the kind of health
12:23 - percentage and then one one for the
12:26 - other axis because we wanted to always
12:28 - be scaled one on the y and one on the z
12:30 - the C really doesn't matter but we just
12:33 - put one there and then for a health
12:35 - percentage here we use the fact that we
12:37 - just created a function under a player
12:40 - that divides our current amount of
12:42 - health with the max amount amount of
12:44 - health that we have in order to get a
12:46 - value between zero and one so we simply
12:48 - go player dot get health percentage and
12:51 - again if you haven't watched the
12:53 - previous video and this is confusing to
12:54 - you go back watch it it makes a lot of
12:57 - sense so now we can just save this out
13:01 - and if we make sure to reference
13:04 - everything inside of unity it should
13:06 - actually be working right away so we can
13:08 - just go and take our health bar drag it
13:10 - under our health bar fill and we should
13:13 - be able to now just hit apply on the
13:16 - player and Iligan also delete the player
13:19 - UI
13:20 - and I actually just want to make a quick
13:23 - test build so just hit control V or
13:25 - command B if you're on the Mac and
13:27 - basically this is not of course going to
13:30 - work with the billboarding and still
13:31 - going to look kind of weird but we'll
13:34 - fix that in a second I just want to make
13:36 - sure that all of our core ARM kind of
13:39 - mechanics when it comes to on this you
13:42 - IPS are working so let's just go into a
13:45 - login menu let's log in with our test
13:48 - user test one two three six one two
13:51 - three let's do the same on our secondary
13:55 - build here tests one two three four
13:57 - we'll use a secondary test user let's
14:00 - create a test host game let's do the
14:03 - same over here test and wait for it to
14:07 - join and hopefully we should see a
14:11 - health bar and a username for both users
14:14 - we do and if I shoot this guy now you
14:17 - can see that decreasing okay so that's
14:19 - one thing that we have to fix and this
14:21 - is why it's always great to play test
14:23 - things sometimes I just refuse I think
14:25 - this is too simple I don't have to test
14:28 - this and then of course something stupid
14:30 - isn't working so the problem here is
14:33 - that we've sent set the anchor point for
14:35 - our image here in the wrong place so you
14:39 - can see it scales towards the center you
14:41 - could want that but I don't think that
14:45 - it's really nice so but you can see it
14:48 - works and you can see how resets wants
14:50 - to play a response there we go it's back
14:53 - to normal and it works on the other
14:54 - player as well awesome so let's just
14:59 - leave the room here let's kick out this
15:01 - player and let's quickly fix that bug
15:04 - all we need to do is go in Tommy level
15:06 - dragging our player find our nameplate
15:09 - canvas find our health bar and let's
15:14 - focus on it switch to 2d mode and you
15:17 - can see our anchor under the host bar
15:20 - fill here it's currently set to the
15:22 - bottom center so let's just change that
15:24 - you can either just drag it over or you
15:27 - could set it manually we want a pivot of
15:31 - one on the X 0 y
15:34 - on the eggs apparently no no that's the
15:37 - right all right it's just cuz it's flip
15:40 - we want is zero on the X and a point 5
15:44 - on the Y so that should set it up so
15:47 - that are helped by once we actually
15:50 - scale it down should kind of decrease in
15:54 - that direction awesome so that looks a
15:57 - lot better
15:59 - cool so let's have a look at
16:01 - implementing a camera facing billboard
16:04 - and I kind of thought about this and
16:06 - thought I'm just going to do this on my
16:08 - own it can't be that difficult
16:10 - and it really isn't that difficult but
16:13 - what I thought was I would just go in
16:15 - and then I would rotate the UI piece to
16:18 - always point towards the camera that is
16:20 - looking at it I mean that makes sense
16:22 - right so if we're standing over here we
16:25 - would want the armed UI piece to point
16:28 - in this direction that's actually not
16:32 - correct what you want instead is have
16:35 - the UI piece point in the direction that
16:38 - the camera that is facing it is looking
16:41 - and that's the difference there because
16:43 - if we are say looking over here then we
16:47 - want on let's say we're looking like
16:49 - this then we don't want this UI thing
16:52 - here to point towards us we wanted to
16:56 - point in the same direction that we are
16:59 - looking and um it's really simple to do
17:02 - this through code but the way that I
17:04 - discovered this was a thing I just
17:07 - thought you should know this is I went
17:08 - into Google and I just typed camera
17:11 - facing field born unity you can see it's
17:13 - there and the first thing that pops up
17:15 - is of course on the unified community
17:18 - wiki it's an awesome place and you can
17:20 - see there's always already a script in
17:22 - here that works so I just took this part
17:26 - of the code here inside of the update
17:27 - loop that actually does the
17:29 - transformation and copied it so let's
17:32 - just do that now you can copy it from
17:33 - here and I'm just going to quickly go
17:35 - through we can find on nameplate canvas
17:39 - we can create a new script you could
17:40 - also put it under the player name plate
17:42 - and we'll just call this one camera
17:44 - facing billboard
17:48 - and let's double-click on that open it
17:50 - up and all we really want is to do a bit
17:53 - of code inside of the update loop what
17:56 - we want to do and you can see here let's
17:57 - just paste in the code then using a
18:00 - variable that they declared called M
18:02 - camera let's instead create a reference
18:04 - to our main camera here so a camera cam
18:07 - equals our camera dot main and then
18:12 - we'll just use cam here and here so
18:16 - basically what they're doing is they're
18:17 - using transform to look at to look in
18:20 - the direction that the camera is looking
18:21 - and they do this by taking our position
18:24 - and adding onto that the cameras
18:27 - rotation multiplied with the forward
18:30 - vector so on the that gives us the arm
18:33 - ah that gives us a vector that points in
18:37 - the direction that the camera is looking
18:39 - and then on we kind of rotate this along
18:44 - the cam transformed rotation multiplied
18:47 - with victor three done up so that's what
18:48 - we use to orient ourselves I'm going to
18:51 - have to draw this out and let's explain
18:53 - it more carefully but just know that
18:56 - this piece of code makes the arm you
18:59 - eyepiece rotate in the direction that
19:02 - our camera is looking awesome so now
19:06 - let's just save this and you can see how
19:08 - awesome it is that you can just let some
19:10 - of the best probably the best thing
19:11 - about using unity is the community and
19:13 - that the fact that there's so much
19:15 - learning material here so let's just
19:17 - save this now and it should work only
19:19 - one thing is we need to make sure that
19:22 - camera that main is actually referencing
19:25 - the correct camera because you can see
19:26 - in the scene here we have both a scene
19:28 - camera that tactics main camera we also
19:31 - have the camera of our player and all of
19:34 - the other players have cameras up as
19:35 - well so basically what the camera main
19:39 - does is it returns the first instance of
19:41 - an active camera tagged as main camera
19:44 - so in our case scene camera is going to
19:47 - be disabled it is tagged as main camera
19:49 - but it's not active and therefore it's
19:51 - not going to be chosen unless we die and
19:54 - it shift to the scene camera in which
19:55 - case main camera is going to use the
19:58 - scene camera so that's exactly what we
20:00 - want and in case of all of the
20:01 - other players we don't want it to face
20:03 - towards them we want to face towards our
20:05 - local player well luckily we disabled
20:09 - the cameras and all those players so
20:10 - only our player has an active camera so
20:13 - actually right out of the gate it should
20:15 - work as long as we go and select our
20:17 - players camera and tag that as main
20:19 - camera as well and now we can go ahead
20:22 - and hit apply we can delete our player
20:25 - we can go into our login menu we can
20:29 - make a build and now everything should
20:31 - actually just be working hopefully and I
20:33 - say hopefully so I I'm just gonna have a
20:36 - sip of water here and let's see so let's
20:44 - hit play here let's log in with our test
20:46 - user let's login with our second test
20:50 - user let's create a room awesome and
20:56 - let's join that room over here and we
21:00 - should see at all of it it's working so
21:03 - if I now just kind of move this over so
21:06 - we can see both screens and I'm actually
21:09 - just going to jump down here you can see
21:13 - that the UI now always faces the player
21:18 - that's awesome and if we were to say
21:20 - kill this play here so look over on this
21:23 - side kill this player oh but I see we
21:26 - still have some kind of offset there so
21:28 - we still have to fix the anchor point I
21:30 - don't know why that didn't apply but you
21:32 - can see here that it still works even
21:33 - though we switch to the same camera so
21:35 - that's awesome so let's just leave the
21:37 - room here have a look at our anchor I
21:39 - might not have applied that correctly so
21:42 - that's just dragging our player in here
21:44 - let's find our name play canvas our
21:47 - health bar health bar Phil and um yeah
21:51 - for some reason the pivot is still off
21:55 - so I don't know why but it is so what
21:59 - we'll do is simply shift to tuning mode
22:00 - here so we can see what's happening
22:02 - shift to the 2d controls so actually why
22:07 - is this happening so we have zero on the
22:10 - X we have point five on the Y that
22:13 - should be just fine
22:15 - just a moment I'm just going to figure
22:16 - out what's going wrong here and I will
22:18 - be right back alright so find out what
22:20 - the problem was and it was actually a
22:22 - little bit tricky to wrap my head around
22:24 - but here we go so if we just throw in
22:27 - our player here into the scene and we
22:30 - find the nameplate canvas and have a
22:32 - look under the health bar and the health
22:34 - bar fill we can see that the anchor
22:36 - point is indeed set to the correct side
22:39 - however if we have a look at how the our
22:43 - image stretches you can see that we
22:45 - currently have it set to stretch to fill
22:48 - the entire health bar that won't work
22:51 - that mean that means that essentially
22:54 - when we do the local scaling it's going
22:56 - to do it's going to do so on both sides
23:00 - at the same time and that's not what we
23:03 - want we want instead to set the stretch
23:05 - to the center here so on that our angle
23:09 - point here is centered and you can go
23:11 - ahead and move it over here but you can
23:13 - also leave it in the center this is just
23:15 - going to make sure that when we stretch
23:16 - we stretch using the anchor point set
23:19 - over here so that should be fixed now
23:24 - and another thing that I thought of
23:26 - while I was fixing this bug is the fact
23:29 - that our player will currently be able
23:32 - to see his own UI and that might be
23:33 - visible if you're just looking straight
23:36 - up into the air
23:37 - so um in order to get rid of this I kind
23:40 - of thought well we could go in and add
23:42 - to the player set up a reference to the
23:45 - name plate canvas and we can disable it
23:47 - there or something but that's really way
23:50 - too complicated what we could do it's
23:51 - Ted is utilize the fact that we already
23:53 - have a game object here called graphics
23:56 - that is enabled and disabled using the
23:58 - player setup so what we'll do instead is
24:01 - just take our names like canvas drag it
24:04 - into the graphics hit continue there and
24:06 - we'll go under our player find our
24:09 - player script let's now remove that
24:12 - third entry we made and just have it you
24:15 - stick the graphics one instead so that
24:18 - means that it will be disabled on death
24:20 - and because the player setup already
24:23 - have a reference to the player graphics
24:25 - it will also be disabled on the local
24:27 - player so now we should be
24:29 - just to play on this player and remove
24:32 - him from the scene and it's also take
24:34 - our two scripts and drag them under the
24:36 - scripts folder just to clean up night
24:38 - clean up nicely and we can then go into
24:40 - our login menu here and shift over to 2d
24:45 - mode and let's have a look at it here it
24:46 - is and let's also hit our control be to
24:51 - build the player and now I think
24:53 - everything should be working so
24:55 - hopefully we will do it right this time
25:00 - so we can see that booting up let's go
25:03 - and hit play it's going to play this
25:06 - term one more time hit test one two
25:09 - three test one two three do the same
25:12 - over here just one two three four test
25:14 - one two three four I should really have
25:16 - made some easier passwords and then we
25:18 - can create a test room and we can join
25:21 - that test room over here you can see
25:23 - already now that when we look up it's
25:25 - not there and if we were to inspect this
25:27 - inside of the scene we can see if we
25:29 - shift out of 2d mode and go and find our
25:32 - player here you can see that we are able
25:36 - to see it but the difference is the game
25:40 - object is not disabled but it's actually
25:43 - set as the layer don't draw so if we
25:46 - have a look at our nameplate canvas you
25:48 - can see that it's set to don't draw
25:50 - which means that all that our camera
25:53 - won't actually display it awesome so our
25:57 - other players in here and I should we
25:59 - should be able to just shoot this guy
26:02 - and you can see the health bar goes down
26:04 - in the appropriate direction and we can
26:06 - kill him and he disappeared disappears
26:10 - correctly so everything is now working
26:13 - and it should be on the same for the
26:16 - other client here awesome great so that
26:19 - was basically all I wanted to show you
26:21 - in this video I hope you enjoyed it um
26:24 - let me know what you want to see next I
26:26 - have a few things that I want to do also
26:28 - a few bugs that we have to fix one thing
26:30 - that I'm is that I am aware of is the
26:33 - fact that our mo does not reset whenever
26:35 - we die so I know that um but it's not
26:38 - enough for one video so I will shoot it
26:40 - in somewhere but yeah thanks for
26:42 - watching and I will
