00:00 - [Music]
00:03 - hello everyone and welcome to the 14th
00:05 - video in our create a survival game
00:08 - series done by brais I am the CEO of
00:11 - braies and today we are going to be
00:13 - taking a look at another method for
00:16 - making audio and underlying music for
00:19 - your game so we're going to apply some
00:22 - smooth fading between audio sources so
00:26 - um let's go ahead and open up
00:28 - Unity um this is generally a better
00:32 - method than what I showed you in the
00:34 - last tutorial though um it does have its
00:38 - faults and I'm going to talk about them
00:41 - very very soon so um first off let's
00:45 - talk about what we made last time we had
00:47 - these two audio zones um with a 2d audio
00:52 - attached to them and a script that
00:55 - handled all of the um switching on and
00:59 - off so basically once the player insert
01:03 - these triggers these trigger colliders
01:05 - the music would start playing and when
01:07 - he left them it would stop this didn't
01:11 - uh give the effect of smooth fading and
01:14 - um it was not really nice so um let's go
01:19 - ahead and for now just disable these by
01:22 - selecting them in the hierarch key and
01:25 - hitting uh this check boox so now we can
01:29 - see they great out out they are disabled
01:32 - great um the reason why I showed you
01:34 - these in the first place was so that you
01:37 - can get an understanding out of how
01:40 - audio zones Works inside of unity and
01:43 - also um it's really great to know how to
01:46 - make trigger
01:47 - functionality um it's good for making
01:51 - all different kinds of surprising events
01:53 - or just um make making sure that your
01:57 - game stays
01:58 - alive um Okay cool so let's go ahead and
02:02 - clean up from our last tutorial drag the
02:05 - audio Zone script under the scripts
02:07 - folder and we are ready to go now hit
02:10 - the game object create empty or you can
02:14 - just press contrl shift n to make a an
02:18 - empty game object you can go ahead and
02:21 - right click and rename this to uh audio
02:25 - Zone optimized I'm just going to write
02:28 - opt or uh Source or whatever you want
02:32 - I'm going to write Ops and then Z one so
02:36 - very similar to what we did before I'm
02:39 - going to zero up the
02:42 - transform and place it basically in the
02:47 - center of our
02:50 - village all right so now I'm going to
02:52 - hit the add component on the white right
02:55 - hand side and uh go on the audio and
02:59 - then and hit the audio
03:01 - Source this is going to again add the
03:04 - audio Source component built into Unity
03:07 - into our game now we want something to
03:10 - start playing and this is very similar
03:12 - to the uh tutorial we did last time now
03:16 - though now we are going to start uh to
03:19 - see some changes so if I double click
03:21 - our audio folder I have changed
03:24 - something with these audio
03:26 - files if I select the friendly music
03:29 - first example you can see what I've
03:32 - changed the 3D sound is now enabled this
03:36 - is because I want these to act as a
03:40 - three-dimensional sound actually placed
03:43 - in somewhere in the scene um so that
03:46 - Unity can take care of the rollof or the
03:50 - linear fading um uh for us so we don't
03:54 - need to do this through
03:56 - scripting and this is really great for
03:59 - stuff like
04:00 - background music or
04:03 - um or at least if you want to change it
04:06 - based on the player position then it's
04:08 - really great for background music it's
04:10 - great for environmental things um St
04:14 - stuff like wind blowing or um water
04:18 - splashing from the sea you get the idea
04:22 - all right so you can go ahead and check
04:24 - that 3D sound and hit the apply keep in
04:27 - mind that if your file is way too to B
04:29 - for games like mine uh my files is or
04:33 - are um then it could take quite a while
04:36 - for it to convert but um be patient uh
04:40 - it should work so now let's go under our
04:44 - audio Zone
04:46 - optimized and drag in the for example
04:49 - friendly
04:51 - music drag it
04:54 - in
04:56 - um I guess I'll just select it some how
04:59 - my dragon isn't working oh there we go
05:02 - now it's fixed um so we have the
05:06 - friendly music and it says this is the
05:08 - 3D sound exactly how we want it we want
05:11 - the play on awake to be Set uh to
05:14 - true and we could go ahead and uh play
05:19 - around with some of the 3D sound
05:21 - settings so right when you add it it
05:24 - should look like this if we go ahead and
05:26 - expand the 3D sound settings you can see
05:29 - see a whole lot of system uh or audio
05:32 - settings come up there are a lot of
05:36 - things that we can trick here so if we
05:38 - go ahead and just hit play right
05:41 - now the piece starts playing and once we
05:45 - get closer to the source it gets a lot
05:48 - louder and if we rotate
05:51 - around you can hear it coming from
05:54 - different places in the room uh this
05:56 - might not be very clear to you but if
05:58 - you are sitting uh listening to this
06:01 - with a headset or
06:04 - um or multiple speakers uh you will be
06:08 - able to notice this and uh for the most
06:11 - part with music uh you don't quite want
06:14 - it to move between speakers um so we're
06:18 - going to fix some of these
06:20 - problems now first of all uh we want the
06:24 - piece to stay equally loud uh throughout
06:28 - our town we don't want it to uh decrease
06:32 - in its Audio Level or pitch um depending
06:36 - on where we are in the town so therefore
06:39 - we're going to change the minimum
06:41 - distance so let's take the minimum
06:43 - distance and drag it up and you can also
06:47 - see this happening inside of scene view
06:50 - you can also select one of these dots
06:53 - and drag it inside the scene
06:56 - view this gives a very nice visual
07:00 - representation of the minimum distance
07:05 - before the rolloff
07:07 - begins and that's what this is all about
07:10 - this is about creating the rolloff or
07:13 - the fading um in in the
07:17 - audio whether whether it's linear or
07:22 - logarithmic and logarithmic simply means
07:25 - that it's has a curve in its listener
07:30 - whereas if we change it to linear you
07:33 - can see that it changes the volume in a
07:37 - straight
07:38 - line all right so um you can have
07:41 - whatever you want here um I'm going to
07:43 - go ahead and change it to linear just to
07:45 - make this a little easier to explain and
07:48 - show
07:49 - off okay so um now that we have this set
07:53 - um we could go ahead and change the max
07:55 - distance so if we um change bump down
07:58 - the max distance
08:00 - quite a bit we should in a moment start
08:02 - to see the blue sphere and there it
08:06 - is so what this means uh with the
08:10 - current settings that we have is that
08:13 - when uh inside of this smaller sphere
08:17 - the music will be equally loud no matter
08:20 - where we are when we get right outside
08:23 - it it will start decreasing in until we
08:28 - hit this
08:30 - outer sphere then it will be completely
08:33 - gone so if we go ahead and bump up the
08:36 - max distance quite a bit we can make the
08:41 - fading um a lot slower but if we leave
08:45 - it here um I can just illustrate so let
08:48 - me go ahead and hit play the music is
08:50 - very
08:51 - loud and it stays equally loud no matter
08:55 - where we are in the Inner Circle now I
08:57 - start leaving the Inner Circle and you
08:59 - can hear it fading until it's completely
09:03 - disappeared one thing though uh and this
09:06 - is the problem with doing it through the
09:09 - 3D audio handling in
09:11 - unity this is also why I showed you the
09:15 - audio Zone uh done through scripting
09:18 - because yes this has does indeed have a
09:23 - problem and uh it can be quite difficult
09:27 - to hear when especially because I'm
09:29 - recording this with just one microphone
09:32 - but whenever we are inside of our
09:37 - town and we
09:40 - rotate you can hear that we get this
09:43 - feeling of the audio flying by really
09:46 - fast and also the the audio is panning
09:51 - from the left to right
09:54 - speaker so um this is not too great for
10:00 - doing music it can be wonderful for
10:03 - stuff like um splashing of the sea but
10:08 - um especially with music you want to
10:11 - keep it equally loud uh until you want
10:14 - it to fade away so let's go ahead and uh
10:17 - change the doer level and the doler
10:22 - level is
10:24 - um well
10:26 - it it um it adjusts the effectiveness of
10:33 - the doo effect and if you don't know the
10:35 - doo effect it's basically whenever we
10:39 - move or rotate quickly the sound gets
10:44 - pitched up and down so the sound gets
10:49 - adjusted and uh it can sound really
10:52 - weird when we are moving quickly or
10:55 - rotating quickly that's basically the
10:57 - doppo effect so um this will just change
11:00 - how much um the doler effect is going to
11:03 - influence our sound and we want that to
11:07 - stay at zero for the
11:09 - music but we can still
11:12 - hear that
11:15 - uh it's not quite gone it does still pan
11:19 - from one speaker to the other and then
11:22 - you might say well there's a pan level
11:24 - adjustment why don't we just change that
11:27 - to zero let's see what happens so I hit
11:31 - play try to run out of the circle it
11:34 - should fade
11:36 - away it doesn't the pan level is not
11:40 - does not just uh don't doesn't just
11:44 - adjust the um the panning it also
11:49 - adjusts how well uh Unity will handle 3D
11:53 - sounds in general so this is how much
11:56 - this audio source is going to be
11:58 - affected by the the 3D sound
12:01 - engine and that means logarithmic
12:04 - falloff or linear rolloff as
12:07 - well so
12:09 - [Music]
12:10 - um that's quite a bummer um though I
12:14 - have come out up with a a technique to
12:17 - uh kind of blur this a little bit so
12:20 - blur the line and not make it quite as
12:23 - um well bad as um it it would be anyways
12:28 - because the pan level can just as the
12:30 - linear rollof in this volume um it can
12:34 - be animated so let's go ahead and do
12:37 - this so here we have the Green Line This
12:41 - is the pan level and I can go ahead and
12:43 - drag this down a little bit um the xaxis
12:47 - here is the distance from the center of
12:52 - this audio
12:53 - source so you can see 0 5 10 this is 0
12:57 - units 5 units 10 units and so on until
13:02 - we reach um the end or the max distance
13:06 - which is currently set to 32 so that is
13:09 - half far way we are and uh the y axis is
13:14 - the influence of stuff like volume pan
13:17 - level and spread and spread I won't be
13:20 - explaining it's not very necessary for
13:23 - this kind of audio
13:26 - configuration so um let's go ahead and
13:29 - and adjust the pan level uh depending on
13:32 - where we are and how far away we are
13:35 - from the
13:37 - source so if we go ahead and double
13:40 - click this will create a new
13:43 - point and uh you can adjust the curve of
13:46 - this by using um this um this point
13:51 - right here but we are really just going
13:54 - to be messing around with the uh
13:57 - position of the point itself so if we go
13:59 - ahead and drag this up and place
14:03 - it uh right about uh maybe a little
14:07 - after the uh fading Begins the downwards
14:13 - fading uh this will mean that when the
14:17 - audio starts fading out we want to be
14:20 - able to hear this so therefore we want
14:23 - the pan level we want the effectiveness
14:26 - of the 3D audio engine to be full but
14:30 - until then we really don't care about
14:32 - the 3D engine so we are going to take
14:35 - the other point here and drag it all the
14:37 - way down and this way we achieve
14:41 - something like
14:44 - this so when I'm inside the city I can
14:48 - rotate and jump and run all I want it
14:52 - won't change the audio at all but when
14:55 - we start getting out to the fading it
14:58 - will actually Fade
15:00 - Away now this still doesn't change that
15:04 - when you're in the fading Zone you can
15:07 - hear the
15:08 - audio being weird you can hear the
15:11 - actual panning but I think it's a pretty
15:15 - good solution it's definitely better
15:17 - than the very harsh switching you um
15:21 - will most of the time get with uh
15:24 - scripting audio else you have to get
15:26 - into uh the distance from the uh game
15:29 - objects and some volume changing um I'm
15:33 - sure you can come up with an algorithm
15:35 - but for now this will do so let's go
15:38 - ahead and actually try to implement
15:40 - something awesome so uh let's drag out
15:43 - the uh max distance to make the fading a
15:48 - lot um smoother and uh slower and let's
15:53 - hear how this sounds so right now we're
15:55 - inside the city and uh I forgot to do
15:58 - one thing so hit stop I forgot to adjust
16:02 - the um the pan level also so we have to
16:07 - drag this back whenever we drag drag the
16:12 - um uh drag drag the the fall off back so
16:16 - um adjust this also and whoops I made a
16:20 - mistake there so quickly create these
16:22 - key frames one more time and uh let's
16:26 - have a
16:27 - listen
16:29 - oh needs to be a little lower try
16:34 - again indeed no changes inside of the
16:38 - city and then the music will slowly and
16:42 - beautifully start fading away and one
16:45 - thing I actually like about this panning
16:48 - is that you can feel the music coming
16:50 - from the town so if we um if we imagine
16:55 - that our player is coming from over here
16:58 - here from another town or has been in a
17:01 - fight um and we then close up on the
17:04 - village we can start hearing slowly the
17:08 - uh music playing and uh it it let us
17:12 - know that we are back
17:14 - home now I could change this to
17:16 - logarithmic rollof to get quite a nicer
17:20 - effect and create some more uh key
17:23 - frames on this adjust them to get a
17:26 - nicer looking
17:27 - curve uh but this is just some tweaking
17:31 - and I'm pretty sure you can do this on
17:32 - your own so um that's the gist of it we
17:36 - could go ahead and duplicate this audio
17:38 - Zone and call it audio Zone optimized
17:42 - 2 check off the play on awake um no
17:46 - actually leave that on um my bad and you
17:50 - might also want to set these both to a
17:54 - loop and then we could just drag this
17:57 - over to another part of the
18:02 - map let's say over there so if we follow
18:05 - the
18:08 - road we follow the
18:11 - road
18:12 - um we should hear the first piece fading
18:16 - out and as soon as we get down here we
18:20 - should start hearing the uh second piece
18:23 - fading in and this way you can create uh
18:26 - different feelings to different parts of
18:29 - your
18:30 - environment there we go I forgot to
18:33 - change which pie piece this uh this
18:37 - audio Zone will be playing so we can
18:39 - just drag the enemy territory in here
18:41 - instead and um this should be working so
18:45 - that's basically it for the audio Zone
18:48 - creation one thing though if you want
18:50 - the enemy to send out scary sounds or if
18:55 - you want battle music like The
18:57 - frightening kind of music or um or stuff
19:01 - like that to play whenever we near the
19:03 - enemy you can simply take the audio Zone
19:07 - U with the frightening music and drag it
19:09 - onto the enemy and position it on him
19:12 - and therefore it's parented on him so
19:14 - whenever we get near him we can hear um
19:18 - these uh this piece of music playing so
19:21 - that's a cool tip for engaging and also
19:24 - letting the player know that he's near
19:27 - something uh something bad so uh that's
19:31 - it for audio uh thank you for watching
19:34 - and uh one more thing before we wrap
19:38 - this up um I have asked a question on
19:42 - Facebook for what you would like to see
19:44 - in future tutorials um I'm currently
19:47 - working on a collision mastering Collis
19:50 - tutorial uh it's going to be really
19:53 - really cool and uh I also have a lot of
19:56 - different stuff um on the list you can
20:00 - see here I have written everything down
20:02 - every request I have gotten um but I
20:05 - would like to get some more feedback so
20:07 - if there's something you want to see or
20:09 - something you want to vote vote up uh go
20:11 - ahead and uh type in facebook.com/
20:14 - braies and you can go ahead and answer
20:16 - the question um let me uh know what you
20:19 - guys want so thanks for watching and
