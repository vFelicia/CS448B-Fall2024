00:03 - hello everyone and welcome to video
00:05 - number 28 in our Survival game series
00:08 - done by Braes I the CEO of Braes and in
00:11 - this video we are going to be importing
00:14 - three new weapons to our game uh made by
00:17 - some cool people I'm going to talk about
00:19 - in a sec and uh this is what they look
00:22 - like so here you go and um so we're
00:26 - going to be importing them and we're
00:27 - going to be building the base of our uh
00:31 - updated um M system uh basically it's
00:35 - going to allow the weapons to move with
00:38 - the animation of of our arms and it's
00:41 - also going to be optimized uh for the
00:44 - upcoming inventory system uh so that's
00:47 - really awesome so uh basically let me
00:51 - just start out with explaining the idea
00:53 - of what we are going to be doing uh so
00:56 - again uh I excuse my drawing skills uh
01:00 - but here we go in
01:02 - paint um the base is this uh so this is
01:05 - a top view of our player capsule just
01:08 - ignore the weapon for now uh and we can
01:10 - see the two two arms going out
01:13 - here uh they are kind of
01:16 - squary okay so we have this uh point on
01:19 - the right hand arm and this is part of
01:21 - the rig uh and the rig is basically the
01:24 - skeleton that allows for uh the arms to
01:27 - animate and that's what I made in
01:29 - blender and uh inside of the rig or the
01:32 - skeleton I made an empty game object
01:35 - that would always uh follow the base of
01:37 - our hand and so we can actually parent
01:41 - uh weapons to this game object and then
01:44 - it will automatically follow the
01:47 - animation uh so that's what that is and
01:51 - uh in order for us to do this uh we
01:53 - would like to instantiate weapons to
01:56 - this point whenever we pick something up
01:58 - or equip something from from our
02:01 - inventory and such so uh we would like
02:04 - to just be able to instantiate in the um
02:08 - in basically a zero position and a zero
02:11 - rotation so um we don't have to uh
02:15 - adjust the position or rotation of the
02:17 - individual weapons and in order to do
02:20 - this I had to centry the pivot point or
02:22 - Anchor Point in all of the weapons and
02:26 - what that's what I've done here so the
02:27 - Anchor Point on all of the weapons
02:30 - uh is where we want to hold it uh so
02:34 - that should all be aligned and so we can
02:37 - have all the weapons uh just simply snap
02:40 - onto there and uh that's the base of
02:43 - what we are going to be doing today so
02:46 - uh first of all I would like uh if you
02:48 - could download the survival game assets
02:50 - pack from our website uh if you want to
02:52 - use the arms or the the the arms or the
02:55 - weapons I'm using uh if you're unaware
02:59 - on how how to do this you can go ahead
03:01 - and watch our bonus video showing just
03:04 - that okay so open up the folder go under
03:07 - Imports and then on the weapons we see a
03:10 - folder called Old weapons these were the
03:13 - uh the two old weapons the Maze and the
03:15 - sword uh we're just going to be ignoring
03:18 - those as they are kind of outdated and
03:20 - they were just placeholder
03:23 - art and uh let's start by importing the
03:27 - iron U Maze and that's that one and this
03:31 - was made by samine iben from blend
03:34 - control and if you're looking for some
03:36 - great free modeling work um he's uh he's
03:40 - really awesome check him
03:42 - out uh so let's start by importing that
03:45 - and uh we have both a blend file and a
03:48 - fbx file I'm just going to be importing
03:51 - the blender file uh because this allows
03:53 - me to quickly open it up through unity
03:56 - and make changes uh but if you don't
03:58 - have blender you can just use the BX
04:00 - you'll get the same
04:02 - result so let's open up unity and just
04:05 - uh navigate to the right folder here so
04:08 - that we have our player and then under
04:10 - our Imports we can go
04:13 - to the weapons and then we will make a
04:17 - new folder create folder and call this
04:20 - old
04:22 - weapons then select The Sword and the
04:24 - Maze and just drag them onto the old
04:27 - weapons now let's make uh another folder
04:31 - and call this
04:34 - iron
04:36 - maze double click it and then we can
04:39 - just drag in the iron ma blend file and
04:42 - the three
04:45 - textures and there we have
04:48 - it awesome uh actually I'll quickly
04:51 - rename this to maze handle
04:55 - diffuse and then maze
04:58 - head diffuse
05:00 - I just like naming it diffuse because
05:04 - there are plenty of different texture
05:06 - types and these are
05:09 - defuse awesome actually the talkers not
05:12 - only but that we'll just ignore that for
05:15 - now okay so now we can just uh drag in
05:18 - the iron Maze and uh see if the scale is
05:21 - proper it's not it's a little bit too
05:24 - big so let's select the iron maze in the
05:27 - inspector or in the project pane and
05:30 - then go to the inspector and change the
05:32 - scale factor down to let's try
05:37 - 07 let's try that I really don't know
05:41 - that's still way too big so let's change
05:44 - this to
05:47 - 0.3 that doesn't look too bad let's try
05:50 - to move it up here we'll just go with
05:53 - that for now and then we can make
05:54 - adjustments
05:55 - later okay so what we're going to do now
05:58 - is we're going to apply the the textures
06:00 - so just hit if to focus on it then right
06:04 - click the animator and hit remove
06:06 - component or you can just go to the iron
06:08 - maze go under animations and uncheck
06:11 - import animation hit apply go to Rick
06:14 - generic and hit none apply go and do
06:18 - model and then I want to uh and this is
06:21 - this is a matter of preference you can
06:23 - easily import the noral so you can
06:25 - calculate them and uh it's really
06:28 - different whether
06:30 - what looks
06:31 - best um actually I think for this one
06:34 - we're going to import them uh I think
06:36 - that looks a little bit better but again
06:38 - that's something we can adjust along the
06:41 - way uh now let's select the iron Maze
06:44 - and now we can start dragging in some
06:45 - textur so on the maze handle we drag in
06:48 - the Maze handle diffuse and change this
06:51 - to completely white on the maze head
06:54 - we'll drag in the Maze head diffuse
06:56 - completely wi and the same with the
06:58 - stand drag in completely
07:01 - wide that's awesome uh but maybe for the
07:05 - maze head we would like it to be a bit
07:07 - more shiny uh so if that's the case you
07:10 - could go ahead and change the maze head
07:12 - Shader type from diffuse to specular and
07:17 - now we can get that specular detail on
07:20 - just that part of the Maze and that's
07:22 - why we have split it up like this and
07:25 - you can of course adjust the shininess
07:27 - and such variables to to see how it
07:30 - reflects light and how it influences and
07:33 - so that's pretty awesome now I I like
07:38 - this a lot so let's now begin to
07:40 - actually add this to the
07:42 - arms so what we can do now is we can
07:44 - select our arms hit uh F to focus on
07:48 - them then go on the arms and now we will
07:51 - start uh browsing the the rig so the
07:55 - Armature and there are going to be a lot
07:58 - of game objects under this but uh you
08:01 - really can just ignore all of them
08:03 - except for the ones I'm using here so
08:05 - arm amateure Master inner arm right
08:09 - because we want to equip to the right
08:11 - hand arm right hand right and then the
08:15 - hold ride and that's uh that's the one
08:18 - we're going to be using though you will
08:21 - notice if you just drag the maze under
08:23 - the hold
08:24 - right and then just zero out the
08:26 - position
08:29 - and the
08:31 - rotation is not really looking too great
08:35 - so what we can do is we can make an
08:37 - empty game object onto the hold right
08:40 - that will be called melee and we can
08:43 - make uh and we can rotate that and so we
08:46 - can uh have all the weapons be rotated
08:49 - if you don't understand this yet that's
08:51 - completely fine I'm sure you will figure
08:53 - it out along the way so let's make an
08:55 - empty game object by either going to
08:57 - game object create empty or press contrl
09:00 - shift n let's call this melee and this
09:03 - is basically going to be a rout for the
09:05 - whole M system let's drag it under the
09:09 - hold and let's drag the iron maze under
09:12 - the meele now let's make sure the meele
09:15 - is centered 0 0 0 0 and also that the
09:20 - iron maze is centered on the M 0 0 oops
09:24 - that was nine 0 0 0 and zero
09:29 - now we can take the Mele object and just
09:32 - rotate it and if you want you can also
09:35 - snap by holding down control ra while
09:39 - rotating and this can just allow for
09:42 - some pretty nice snapping and now we can
09:45 - go in and fine tune this so I would like
09:48 - it to be more to the
09:51 - right it's
09:53 - very very much at an angle right now and
09:57 - maybe a bit back like
10:01 - this zoom in some more so we can see
10:05 - what we're
10:08 - doing move it a
10:10 - bit bit
10:12 - upward and a bit
10:15 - out and that doesn't look too bad let's
10:18 - see how it looks in game so go into game
10:21 - and then hit play and we can see that
10:25 - the maze is behind the hand even though
10:27 - in our scene it looks just right and
10:31 - that's because uh if you have watched
10:33 - tutorial 20 number number 26 I believe
10:37 - uh where we take care of weapon clipping
10:40 - uh we made a secondary camera that will
10:42 - always make sure our hands are drawn so
10:45 - that they don't won't clip through other
10:47 - objects if
10:48 - collided um but we we have to add our
10:52 - our weapon here to that layer uh so what
10:56 - we're going to do is we're going to go
10:58 - under melee and then change the layer to
11:00 - draw always and let say yes change
11:04 - children and this will also change our
11:06 - iron
11:07 - maze uh or anything else we have under
11:10 - the Mele object uh though I'm pretty
11:12 - sure if you drag something under there
11:14 - now you still have to change the
11:16 - layer okay so now let's have a look
11:18 - again hit
11:20 - play and that looks really awesome I
11:23 - think uh we could maybe scale down the
11:25 - maze a bit to see more of the top but
11:28 - that's really up to you I'm just going
11:30 - to leave it here for
11:33 - now Okay cool so next up we are going to
11:37 - import yet another weapon so go back to
11:40 - the weapons folder hit create folder and
11:43 - then let's call this
11:46 - Axe and this axxe was made by uh one of
11:50 - the uh guys that were working on your
11:53 - game a really talented modeler called
11:55 - igle and we're going to have a link to
11:58 - his portfolio
11:59 - as soon as we get it up but that's the
12:01 - one there uh so let's go under the um
12:05 - weapons here under the axe and then
12:08 - select the blend file and the ax
12:11 - diffuse and just drag it on the ax
12:16 - there let's double click it and there we
12:18 - have it uh so let's drag this in and we
12:21 - can see this is really really big so
12:24 - let's just go ahead and select it in the
12:26 - project pane change the scale factor to
12:29 - something like
12:30 - 0.09 let's try with
12:33 - that just
12:35 - guessing uh where we have it we have it
12:38 - there so let's focus on it that wasn't
12:42 - too bad actually I kind of like that
12:45 - scale it might it's still too big yeah
12:48 - so let's go and do
12:54 - 0.06 and uh that looks pretty good maybe
12:57 - 0.05
12:59 - it's all right if the weapons are a
13:01 - little bit too small it looks better uh
13:04 - when you can see more of the weapon I
13:06 - think but again it's up to you it's a
13:08 - matter of preference of course so now
13:10 - selected in the project pane uh then you
13:14 - can see let's see if we want this to be
13:18 - automatically imported I think we would
13:21 - like to calculate this
13:23 - one yeah I kind of like that better but
13:26 - we'll see when we once we get the
13:27 - textures on go to RI
13:31 - none and let's just hit try again then
13:34 - go to animation and uncheck import
13:36 - animation and hit apply okay great so
13:39 - now that we have those set up let's uh
13:41 - get it to fit our hand there uh so now
13:45 - we can just go ahead and drag it on our
13:48 - me and we can remember to change the
13:51 - layer to draw always then go to the
13:54 - position zero out the variables also
13:57 - rotation Soo them out
14:00 - and now we should see that they align
14:02 - though I see there are a small problem
14:06 - here and uh what we can do is we can
14:08 - simply take our melee object here and
14:12 - just rotate it that way so now it should
14:16 - be pointing forwards and when we import
14:19 - our knife the blade should be twoo great
14:22 - so you can see that these weapons
14:24 - automatically align and so if we were to
14:28 - disable the iron
14:30 - maze it's not looking too bad of course
14:33 - he's never going to be holding it just
14:35 - perfect but I think that is really
14:38 - close okay so now let's drag on the
14:41 - diffused texture and change this to
14:43 - completely white and there we have it
14:45 - now we have our axe in game
14:49 - also and uh that's
14:51 - awesome okay so now let's uh let's just
14:55 - quickly see how it looks in game not too
14:58 - bad
14:59 - uh also you might want to see that these
15:02 - follow any kind of Animation we're doing
15:04 - so if we go under our animator you will
15:07 - be able to see the setup we made in
15:09 - mechm in the last two tutorials and if
15:13 - we had play we can do stuff like uh oops
15:18 - this is not working so what we can do is
15:20 - we can go this is might be the wrong
15:23 - controller I've selected so let's go
15:26 - into the arms hit the arms controller
15:28 - there
15:29 - much better and also remember that um
15:34 - mechanim has a box so that's just
15:36 - uncheck apply root
15:38 - motion and now we can see the animation
15:41 - playing and when we hit the hit one you
15:45 - can see it starts swinging the weapon
15:47 - the same with hit two that looks great
15:50 - and when we run it also follow the hands
15:55 - so that's awesome and uh that is working
15:59 - great so now under the Mele uh let's
16:02 - import the last weapon so let's go and
16:04 - do Imports weapons and then create new
16:09 - folder call this
16:12 - knife and uh the knife was made by me
16:16 - and I am really really good at modeling
16:19 - um uh I think it's the best one
16:23 - definitely uh okay so the knife here uh
16:26 - select the blend file and the knife
16:28 - diffuse texture and let's just drag it
16:31 - onto the knife
16:33 - folder double click the knife folder to
16:35 - open it up there we have it and then
16:38 - that's uh I don't know about the
16:40 - tangents let we'll yet we'll see about
16:43 - that uh the skill fact is probably off
16:46 - though so let's try to drag it in there
16:49 - no that's right kidding uh okay so we
16:51 - can just bump down the skill factor
16:54 - quite a bit uh let's try 0.1
17:00 - that doesn't look too bad let's focus on
17:05 - it guess we'll have to have him holded
17:08 - before we can really see but that's
17:11 - actually not too bad so uh for some
17:14 - reason this already has the texture
17:16 - applied but you can of course go ahead
17:18 - and just drag it on there change this to
17:20 - completely white select it in the
17:23 - project pain go on the rig select none
17:25 - hit apply animations unche import
17:29 - animation and the model
17:31 - there uh okay so I think the tangents
17:35 - are actually not too bad though I don't
17:38 - really like this shattering by the edge
17:40 - of the blade so let's go ahead and hit
17:44 - calculate and that should get rid of it
17:46 - yes it did great now we can go ahead and
17:50 - just drag it onto the Mele and you know
17:54 - the progress just uh s out the positions
17:58 - through out the
17:59 - rotation and now it should look just
18:03 - right and if we disable the axe we can
18:06 - have a look at it in game and uh whoops
18:09 - we forgot one thing select the knife go
18:11 - to layer draw always and now it should
18:15 - look just right actually this might be a
18:19 - little bit too low on the hand so of
18:21 - course what you can do because this is a
18:23 - blend file is you can just double click
18:26 - it and it will open it up in blender and
18:28 - that's awesome so now we can just move
18:31 - it up a tiny bit in edit
18:33 - mode which won't affect our pivot hit
18:38 - save and this is of course done in the
18:41 - um version you're downloading and now it
18:43 - should be perfectly centered yeah there
18:47 - we go so that was basically it for this
18:50 - video guys let's just quickly maybe go
18:52 - ahead and make some prefabs out of these
18:55 - if you want to um I'm not going to do
18:58 - that but you can do it if you
19:00 - want and uh in the next one we're going
19:02 - to be uh affecting the animation uh
19:06 - through scripting so we are going to be
19:08 - learning how to uh get this to play um
19:12 - in
19:14 - game and uh we I'm also thinking about
19:17 - doing some fall damage tutorials and
19:20 - maybe uh and then of course the
19:22 - inventory system and upcoming is also
19:25 - some more combat and uh there's a lot of
19:28 - exciting things on the way don't know
19:30 - when don't know how but uh it will get
19:33 - there sometime so stay tuned and thank
19:36 - you for watching
