00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello
00:04 - everyone and welcome to video number
00:06 - nine and make a game a cool series on
00:09 - making a video game in unit c today we
00:12 - are going to be taking a look at
00:14 - particles they are so much fun to play
00:17 - around with we're gonna be adjusting
00:20 - settings and making our coin emit
00:22 - awesome shiny particles and we're gonna
00:25 - make everything look much more awesome
00:27 - so as always I've opened up unity and we
00:31 - are back and I'll make a game scene and
00:34 - what we can see is we have the coin
00:37 - ready with this coin pick up scripts and
00:40 - basically how you would do this is we
00:43 - won't want the coin when we pick it up
00:46 - so when we roll into the coin we wanted
00:49 - to emit a bunch of particles and you do
00:52 - this by first making a particle system
00:55 - and then telling this coin to create
00:57 - this particle system right before it
01:00 - destroys itself so first off let's take
01:04 - care of the awesome part which is making
01:06 - the particles and after that we will
01:09 - make the code but it's really simple
01:11 - it's only like two lines of code so go
01:14 - to a game object create other and then
01:17 - particle system and this is called the
01:20 - shuriken particle system that is much
01:22 - debate on how to pronounce that I'll say
01:25 - shuriken I'm sorry if I'm offending
01:26 - anyone but this is the new awesome
01:30 - particle system in unit C so what we are
01:33 - gonna do first is we're gonna take a
01:35 - look at the general settings so we can
01:37 - just move this up a bit so we can see
01:40 - what's going on and first off let's
01:43 - adjust the duration and the duration is
01:45 - basically how long it's going to emit
01:48 - particles before it stops emitting and
01:52 - you won't notice any change whenever I
01:55 - change this right now because it's set
01:57 - to loop and that basically means that
02:00 - once the duration is has run out it will
02:03 - just lube and so there's no difference
02:05 - but if I set this to let's say 1 and
02:08 - then turn off looping and hit stop down
02:12 - here with the part
02:13 - to the effect so we can it simulate
02:15 - again we can see it emitting for one
02:17 - second and then it stops so basically we
02:20 - want to set this to something like 0.2
02:26 - let's just see how that looks so we just
02:30 - get this single burst of particles and
02:32 - that's basically the effect we are going
02:34 - for so but just to play around with
02:37 - things we're gonna set it to loop while
02:39 - we while we set this up so just said
02:41 - loop and hit similar simulate now
02:45 - pre-warm we don't want that that's if we
02:47 - wanted not to start emitting particles
02:49 - whenever it spawns but just want it to
02:51 - spawn with particles that's not
02:53 - something we're going after the start
02:55 - delay we'll just leave that at zero they
02:58 - start lifetime this is how long when the
03:02 - particles are going to live after they
03:03 - are emitted so basically if we set this
03:05 - to 1 we can see that they live for one
03:09 - second if we set it higher we can see
03:12 - them going much higher and basically
03:15 - let's just try this off at one and we'll
03:19 - see how it goes we might do something
03:21 - like no actually let's try it off with
03:24 - with one I think that's gonna be pretty
03:26 - great and they start speed I want this
03:28 - to be maybe even more so we can just
03:32 - adjust this to how everyone and I want
03:34 - them to be shooting out right in the
03:37 - beginning and and that looks pretty fine
03:40 - this that size also looks ok we can just
03:44 - leave that for now the rotation also
03:46 - leave that the color that's something
03:49 - we're gonna change down here because we
03:50 - want the color to actually animate and
03:52 - not just be one single color color the
03:56 - gravity multiply this is if you want the
03:58 - particles to start falling so we can
04:00 - bump this up but but that's not really
04:02 - something I'm going for they inherit
04:04 - velocity that's just something we're
04:06 - gonna leave for now simulation space
04:09 - needs to be local and it could be in
04:14 - world - that doesn't matter for us right
04:16 - now and the play on awake we're just
04:19 - gonna leave that on that's important
04:21 - because that we want our particles to
04:23 - play as soon as they spawn too
04:27 - if we set the simulation space here to
04:28 - world maybe I can demonstrate this in
04:34 - the editor I don't know if I can because
04:37 - I would like to yeah ok so if we just
04:40 - set the lifetime of these to something
04:42 - pretty long right now the simulation
04:45 - space is set to local so whenever you
04:48 - remove this you can see we move all of
04:50 - the particles but if we set this to
04:52 - world it will only move the emitter so
04:56 - the particles that are up here won't get
04:59 - affected so that's basically the
05:01 - difference there but we don't need it to
05:03 - be anything other than local for this
05:06 - great so let's just delve into some cool
05:09 - animation actually right before that
05:12 - let's take care of these two
05:14 - so can just uncollapse these and all of
05:17 - these are awesome components inside the
05:20 - particle system where you can do
05:21 - different things first off the emission
05:24 - we're gonna bump up the rate to make it
05:26 - more to make it emit even more particles
05:30 - so here you can see we got a lot of
05:32 - particles going and the shape we're
05:35 - gonna change this to a sphere so that
05:39 - they will emit out from a sphere we
05:42 - could also actually we could make this
05:45 - the same shape as the coin but then we
05:49 - would need a mesh so we're not gonna
05:51 - play around with that but basically
05:52 - let's just bump down the ratio or the
05:55 - radius a bit and that looks just fine
05:58 - and random direction now we're just
06:02 - gonna going to leave it as is and then
06:04 - we can go down to the velocity over
06:07 - lifetime and if we just play around with
06:10 - this and bump it up on the x-axis for
06:12 - example we can see that the particles
06:16 - start floating in the x-axis and if we
06:19 - bump it down even more they get affected
06:22 - so basically that makes them this is
06:25 - great for simulating wind but it's not
06:28 - really something we want right now what
06:30 - we're going to do instead is we're going
06:32 - to use the limit velocity over lifetime
06:34 - and what we can do here is we can get
06:37 - that really awesome dampening effects
06:40 - and we can change the speed of this just
06:44 - to how we wanted and the dampening
06:46 - effect so if that's at zero they won't
06:51 - get affected at all I'm gonna do
06:53 - something like 0.3 there and the speed
06:58 - of to something like this and the color
07:02 - of a lifetime and this is really cool
07:04 - this we can go in here and now instead
07:07 - of just choosing one single color we can
07:10 - click this and we get the gradient
07:12 - editor and this will allow us to
07:14 - completely customize its color over
07:17 - lifetime so what we can do is we can say
07:19 - the start color should be pretty much
07:21 - the same as the coin so we can use the
07:23 - color picker to make it this yellowish
07:27 - color something a little more orange
07:29 - maybe like this and now we can see that
07:32 - it all the particles start out
07:34 - completely yellow and then I want them
07:37 - to turn into something more not red
07:40 - exactly but another yellow color and not
07:44 - that saturated so they get that white
07:47 - anglo II feel and this looks pretty
07:49 - great actually but you can go ahead and
07:52 - play around with it until you get
07:53 - something you're satisfied with there so
07:58 - this looks pretty awesome and what we
08:01 - can also do is instead of just changing
08:03 - the color we can also change the
08:05 - transparency so that the particles will
08:07 - actually fade out so that's up here
08:10 - these are the Alpha channels so we're
08:13 - just gonna select this the one all the
08:15 - way to the right and bump down the Alpha
08:18 - to something like zero so now we can see
08:21 - them slowly fading away and actually I
08:25 - want them to start fading away a little
08:28 - later so what we can do is we can double
08:29 - click here to make a new Alpha note and
08:32 - then we can make this to a maximum
08:35 - amount which is 255 and then we can just
08:38 - drag this over so that they will first
08:40 - start fading away right before they they
08:44 - die great so what we can also do is we
08:48 - can also adjust the size over lifetime
08:50 - so if we hit this we get this awesome
08:53 - curve so
08:54 - we click this and go down in the
08:56 - right-hand corner we can now adjust the
08:58 - size parameter so if we want them to
09:01 - like slowly get smaller I want just a
09:05 - bit of a curve there so they don't stay
09:07 - exactly the same size we could also make
09:09 - an inverse effect so they get bigger
09:11 - that's something pretty cool for light
09:13 - or something like steam machines but we
09:16 - are just gonna make it like this to make
09:18 - to give it the the glowy effect and
09:23 - decides by speed we're gonna leave that
09:25 - external forces all of this we're gonna
09:28 - leave what we could do is we could make
09:31 - what's called a salt emitter and these
09:34 - are really cool because basically we can
09:36 - make our particles whenever they die we
09:39 - can make them emit another particle
09:41 - system so you can imagine this goes
09:44 - pretty crazy sometimes but basically
09:47 - what we could do just to try it out is
09:49 - we could add something under the death
09:51 - here we could hit the plus sign to
09:54 - create a new particle system and now you
09:56 - can see it looks completely crazy and
09:59 - it's it looks a little bit like
10:01 - fireworks but that's something you can
10:03 - play around with if you want to so you
10:05 - can see over here in the hierarchy it
10:07 - has created a sub emitter under the
10:09 - particle system which we can then change
10:11 - so we could set the duration of this to
10:14 - one the emission and the shape we could
10:18 - change these for example the size this
10:22 - may be a little bit crazy so we could
10:24 - bump that down the duration is still too
10:28 - much because it's looping so we can just
10:30 - make it go like this like just 0.1 and
10:35 - looping and the particle amount here in
10:40 - the first section we can change that to
10:42 - something like 5 instead and then set
10:44 - the lifetime to something like 1 and now
10:48 - it's much more manageable and then we
10:50 - can maybe make them red and now we got
10:53 - this crazy effect going but that was
10:56 - just to demonstrate this sublimator so
10:58 - I'll just go ahead and delete that again
10:59 - and go back because that's that's too
11:02 - much simply so let's disable this up
11:05 - immediately again and now if we go down
11:07 - the renderer this is where we can make
11:10 - it look really great
11:11 - because right now these particles don't
11:14 - have this shiny feel they are simply a
11:16 - matte color but what we can do is we can
11:19 - change the default particle to something
11:22 - that looks much more glowy so if we make
11:25 - simply a new material we can have it we
11:29 - can give it this additive blend mode so
11:33 - if we go down to the project pane and
11:35 - hit and right-click then go under
11:38 - creates and material we can make this
11:42 - glow particle and we can change the
11:48 - shader of this oh actually that's just
11:51 - assign it to the particle system first
11:53 - so we can go down here under the
11:55 - renderer and drag it in there and now we
11:59 - can see it looks really done because
12:01 - this is not set up correctly so we're
12:03 - gonna go and change it from diffuse to
12:06 - the effect no the particles and then the
12:12 - additive I think this is a really great
12:14 - effect and then we can select the
12:17 - texture you should see this default
12:19 - particle texture and now we can see it
12:22 - looks like it's actually grown or
12:24 - glowing and this can change the color
12:27 - just a bit you can adjust the tint if
12:28 - you think it's a bit too crazy there I'm
12:31 - gonna tint it just a bit to the red side
12:34 - to give it some cool ending there and
12:40 - that looks pretty great so a gray is red
12:42 - color and I'm pretty satisfied with this
12:45 - result let's try and hit stop simulating
12:48 - and turn off looping to see if we have
12:50 - enough particles and that's just a nice
12:52 - simple particle effect and I'm really
12:56 - really glad with that maybe we can pump
12:59 - up the rate just a bit to get some more
13:01 - particles to something like 7d yeah that
13:04 - looks really awesome and that feels
13:06 - really great so let's just rename this
13:09 - to coin effect and drag it down to the
13:17 - project pane to make a peep prefab and
13:20 - now we can delete it
13:21 - in the inspector or the hierarchy I mean
13:25 - and now we can select our coin go to the
13:29 - coin pick up script double click it to
13:32 - open it up in monodevelop
13:33 - and we can see it opening up and you
13:36 - might notice that i'm using the new
13:38 - version of unity which is unity 4.3 it
13:41 - has some awesome 2d features we just I
13:44 - just published a tutorial on those so
13:46 - checking it out definitely and
13:48 - monodevelop here also looks much more
13:51 - polished which is great but basically
13:54 - what we're gonna do now is we're gonna
13:55 - instantiate that means spawn or create a
14:00 - the particle system and to do this we
14:04 - need a variable we need to know or we
14:07 - need to tell unity what it needs to
14:09 - spawn and so we make a new variable var
14:13 - and we're gonna call this coin effect
14:16 - and it's gonna be of type transform and
14:22 - this is just something you need to
14:23 - remember and not understand whenever we
14:25 - need to spawn something we use the
14:28 - transform type and now here where it
14:32 - says debug deadlock add a coin counter
14:34 - here right beneath that we are gonna
14:37 - type instantiate and it's really
14:41 - important that you do this before
14:42 - destroying this object or it won't get
14:45 - instantiated so instantiate and then
14:47 - open up a parenthesis and now you can
14:50 - see it needs a lot of input and this
14:54 - looks confusing but it's really simple
14:56 - actually the first thing it's need it
14:59 - needs is just to know what object it
15:02 - needs to spine spawn and that's our coin
15:05 - effect and then we need to tell it where
15:09 - so that's our transform dot position
15:13 - just the position of this game object
15:15 - and we've brought what rotation and
15:19 - that's just the transform that rotation
15:21 - we can just have it give it the same as
15:24 - this object and that's basically it's so
15:26 - close it up and parenthesis and
15:28 - semicolon and now when we play the game
15:32 - oh yeah actually we have to assign it
15:34 - first so now you can see under the
15:37 - script that it has the coin effect so we
15:41 - can just drag in our prefab there and
15:44 - now hit play and when we roll into the
15:49 - coin we should see particles emitting
15:51 - and it feels much more natural now one
15:55 - thing you could also do is you might
15:58 - notice the light just disappears so you
16:02 - could attach a light under the coin
16:06 - light or I mean under the cone effects
16:10 - so that the light also fades slowly but
16:13 - but that's another thing one thing we
16:15 - want to do though is if we have a lot of
16:17 - coins in our scene they will just keep
16:20 - in stan changing these coin effects and
16:23 - as you might notice in our hierarchy
16:27 - when we roll over the coin we can see
16:30 - the coin affect clone here and so the
16:33 - hierarchy will just get cluttered with
16:35 - these coin effects which are not doing
16:39 - anything because they have already
16:40 - played so what we can do is we can
16:43 - simply tell it to destroy destroy this
16:48 - app object after a certain amount of
16:50 - seconds and to do this we are just going
16:54 - to give it a name so before the
16:56 - instantiate function will just call this
16:58 - effect and we'll say equals instantiate
17:03 - and we need to type variable also so VAR
17:06 - effect equals substantiate and what we
17:09 - can do now is we can say that not only
17:11 - shall I destroy the game object but
17:14 - before that it should also destroy the
17:16 - effects like this but we need to make it
17:22 - make it we need to tell it that it has
17:27 - to wait a few seconds so we just do
17:30 - comma and then maybe three seconds and
17:32 - close it up so let's see if this is
17:35 - working and hit play and now we can see
17:41 - we roll in the coin of fact plays we can
17:43 - see it here and it should disappear in
17:46 - to one it should disappear oh we get an
17:49 - error can't destroy transform if you
17:52 - want to destroy game object please cut
17:54 - the stranger you know okay so what we
17:58 - can do is we can instead use destroy
18:01 - effects dot game objects like this
18:07 - hopefully this will work I'll have to
18:10 - figure something out
18:13 - let's see if it gets destroyed and there
18:16 - it was so it gets destroyed after three
18:19 - seconds just to clean everything up so
18:22 - that was basically it for this tutorial
18:25 - we can just round it up by making our
18:26 - coin into a prefab I think we have to
18:29 - serve this now we can distribute it all
18:32 - over our scene and we can have it appear
18:35 - all kinds of places the next thing we
18:38 - are going to be doing is maybe adding a
18:39 - coin counter or I have plenty of ideas
18:43 - so there are more coming up and thank
18:45 - you for watching I'll see you in the
18:46 - next video
