00:00 - so a few weeks ago Unity invited us to
00:02 - GDC so those of you who don't know GDC
00:04 - stands for game developer conference in
00:07 - fact it's the largest event for game
00:08 - developers in the world so you could
00:10 - imagine we were pretty excited when
00:11 - Unity wanted to flash all the way to San
00:13 - Francisco to take part in this event now
00:16 - we live in Copenhagen so come travel day
00:18 - we had a pretty long flight ahead of us
00:20 - but still we were full of excitement and
00:22 - comfortable as ever and we didn't have
00:24 - to wait long before the fun started just
00:26 - looking out the window on the way there
00:28 - made the journey worth it we really got
00:29 - lucky with some amazing views after a
00:32 - good night's sleep on andreas' shoulder
00:34 - we arrived in San Francisco but first
00:38 - Customs when we got to the hotel we were
00:41 - pretty tired and beyond ready to go to
00:43 - bed the next day is when the event
00:45 - kicked off but before we get into it
00:47 - this video is sponsored by Jason Wyman
00:49 - Jason has made an amazing Unity 3D
00:51 - masterclass which takes you all the way
00:53 - from the very fundamentals of Game Dev
00:55 - to using Unity on a professional level
00:57 - in fact we talked about this in a video
00:59 - a few weeks back back and we've gotten
01:00 - such a positive response that we decided
01:02 - to extend the offer for you guys the
01:04 - class will teach you the principles of
01:06 - solid code architecture and you will get
01:08 - familiar with packages like cinem
01:09 - machine timeline and pro Builder what
01:12 - makes this course unique is that you get
01:13 - to work along with other students and
01:15 - get live one-on-one help from Jason
01:17 - himself he also has an amazing VR course
01:20 - and at the end you will have made
01:21 - multiple finished games and have the
01:23 - opportunity to customize and show off
01:25 - your unique work to the class with the
01:27 - last offer we did we gave away free
01:28 - bracki shirts for the first 50 people
01:30 - for this one we decided to one up
01:32 - ourselves and give away any shirt from
01:34 - line of code so you can choose for
01:36 - yourself which one you want you also get
01:38 - a big discount and other bonuses on both
01:40 - courses simply click the link in the
01:41 - description and get started so after we
01:44 - woke up we went straight to the unity
01:46 - office and one of the first happy faces
01:48 - to greet us was Sam we got a quick tour
01:50 - around the office and after that we were
01:53 - off to collect our GDC Badges and this
01:55 - was the first time we really felt that
01:57 - GDC was starting to take over San
01:58 - Francisco you could almost hear the city
02:00 - humming with game devs it's a really fun
02:03 - thing to be a part of because no matter
02:04 - where you look there are people wearing
02:06 - Badges and you know that you have
02:07 - something in common and when I say that
02:09 - there are developers everywhere in the
02:10 - city I mean everywhere Unity was kind
02:14 - enough to provide us with exhibited
02:16 - passes which meant that we could visit
02:17 - the Expo floor when they were still
02:19 - building it at this point it was hard to
02:21 - believe that there would be a GDC this
02:23 - year after that we walked to the place
02:25 - where the unity keynote was supposed to
02:26 - take place when we got there people were
02:28 - still setting everything up and we got
02:30 - taken to the production room backstage
02:32 - unfortunately we weren't allowed to film
02:34 - in there but I can promise you that
02:35 - there was a lot of really cool looking
02:37 - equipment like a lot a lot at this point
02:41 - Liz and will were getting ready for the
02:42 - pre-show and fortunately we were then
02:44 - good time to sort out all of the
02:46 - technical issues you will always
02:47 - experience when setting up with other
02:49 - people's equipment and then the show
02:51 - happened we won't go too much into the
02:53 - keynote here because we're planning on
02:55 - doing a separate video on all the
02:56 - features that got talked about during
02:58 - the conference so stay tuned for that
03:00 - now after the keynote we went out to
03:02 - meet some of the people gathered outside
03:04 - and then it was time for dinner here we
03:06 - also got to meet jail who in case you
03:08 - don't already know him is just an
03:10 - amazing creator that I highly recommend
03:12 - you check out we got to spend a lot of
03:13 - time together with him and his lovely
03:15 - girlfriend during the week and I think
03:17 - this is actually the best thing about
03:18 - GDC of course some people go there for
03:21 - the talks the meetings or the booths but
03:23 - personally I think what makes it
03:25 - worthwhile for me is that beside all of
03:27 - this you get the chance to meet people
03:28 - from all the around the world who share
03:30 - a common interest of course you learn
03:32 - more about game development but it's
03:34 - also a great way to just put work stuff
03:36 - aside and talk about Hobbies different
03:38 - cultures or just have fun after a while
03:41 - it kind of starts to feel like one big
03:42 - high school reunion now the next day we
03:45 - held a meeting greed in the park just
03:46 - outside one of the conference buildings
03:48 - and beside having to run through the
03:50 - city with boxes of pizza and being laid
03:52 - for our own meet and greed thanks Pizza
03:54 - plays it was so much fun and great to
03:56 - get to meet all of you thanks to all the
03:57 - people who showed up and for all the
03:58 - amazing things you had to share now
04:00 - after doing a quick interview for Unity
04:02 - which we had a little trouble finding
04:04 - since it was in the spare room of a
04:06 - dental office we had some extra time and
04:08 - took the opportunity to visit the
04:09 - skyline bar at the top of our hotel and
04:12 - man does beard taste better with a view
04:13 - like that after that we went to a dinner
04:16 - with some people from unity and a bunch
04:17 - of creators here we got to meet Tas
04:19 - brush who other than being a really nice
04:21 - guy also makes some great educational
04:23 - videos that I definitely recommend you
04:24 - check out now day three was insane we
04:28 - got up early to do a round Round Table
04:30 - meeting on dots we then had a bunch of
04:32 - meetings around the conference and
04:33 - finally it was time to check out the
04:35 - Expo and holy wow was it fun this year
04:38 - actually I think it deserves a
04:41 - [Music]
04:58 - montage
05:02 - [Music]
05:11 - Unity also had a massive Booth with
05:13 - demos a bar a place to get custom shirts
05:16 - and a stage for presentations here we
05:18 - saw the unity road map talk which again
05:20 - we'll talk more about soon I think one
05:22 - of the really cool parts of the Expo was
05:24 - old control GDC where a bunch of
05:26 - University students showed off games
05:28 - designed with unique and different
05:29 - controllers for example I quickly found
05:31 - myself shoveling coal and pulling levers
05:33 - to keep a train on track after some
05:35 - intense hours at the Expo we wanted to
05:37 - wind down a bit and went to the docks to
05:39 - get some food before we had a use a
05:40 - group later that evening at this point
05:42 - we thought that we had time to enjoy a
05:44 - good meal on a good restaurant with a
05:46 - nice view but ended up having to quickly
05:48 - swallow our food and run off to get a
05:50 - cap so if you ever go to DDC make
05:52 - reservations and be ready to have your
05:54 - time schedule thrown out the window and
05:56 - do a lot of cardio just like this guy
05:58 - who tried to catch up with the cable car
05:59 - thought we wrote the next
06:04 - day with that we had completed all the
06:06 - official events we had to attend and
06:08 - went out for drinks with jabil and his
06:10 - girlfriend R may we went to this really
06:12 - cool mixer at a nightclub where they'd
06:14 - set up a bunch of gaming stations and
06:16 - here we discovered our favorite game
06:18 - from the whole conference King of the
06:20 - Hat an incredibly fun fast-paced
06:22 - hat-based multiplayer head fighting game
06:25 - big shout out to the Developers for
06:26 - making such a fun and easy to pick up
06:28 - game it was an amazing way to wrap up a
06:30 - crazy day and other than the tiny bit of
06:32 - sightseeing we managed to slip in before
06:34 - our plane the next day that was pretty
06:36 - much it for our GDC this year overall
