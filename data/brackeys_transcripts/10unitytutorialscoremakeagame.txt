00:00 - thanks for tuning in at
00:02 - braies hello everyone and welcome to
00:05 - video number 10 in make a game a cool
00:08 - series on making a video game in unity
00:11 - so today we are going to be U making the
00:14 - score system uh for our players so every
00:18 - time we pick up a coin we are going to
00:20 - see some DUI on the screen it's not
00:23 - going to be fancy but it's going to be
00:24 - there that will display the score so
00:27 - let's just go ahead and dig right into
00:29 - it so as always I've opened up
00:32 - unity and uh what we're going to do now
00:35 - is we're going to first off select our
00:38 - coin and uh now you know what let's uh
00:41 - there because there are two parts to
00:43 - this process the first is uh of course
00:47 - the coin we have to uh to actually
00:50 - change a variable um but it's a good
00:53 - idea to stall this variable not on the
00:55 - coin itself because we will have
00:58 - multiple coins spread out the entire
01:01 - scene and so instead we could just make
01:04 - an uh Master game object that will have
01:08 - this variable and that will also take
01:10 - care of the dii uh and then we can just
01:13 - access that variable and change that so
01:16 - that's what we're going to do so first
01:19 - off let's make this master object so
01:22 - let's go under game object and hit
01:24 - create empty or press control shift and
01:27 - that's of course command shift n if
01:29 - you're on a Mac
01:30 - and let's go ahead and call this
01:32 - underscore GM and again the reason why I
01:35 - put an underscore is so that it will
01:37 - stay on top of the
01:40 - hierarchy let's just position all of
01:42 - this uh by 0000 Z that's just general
01:46 - good practice and let's go ahead and add
01:48 - a new component new script of type
01:51 - JavaScript and let's call this game uh
01:57 - Master hit create an ad and let's double
02:00 - click it to open it up in mono
02:05 - develop there we go oops this is just
02:09 - some of our previous script so if I zoom
02:11 - in on this we can go ahead and get
02:13 - started so first off we of course want a
02:17 - variable and this variable is going to
02:19 - be
02:21 - VAR uh and then we're going to call it
02:24 - uh current score um it's I'm just going
02:28 - to call it this because we might also
02:30 - want like a high score a master score
02:33 - okay let's call this a current score
02:36 - like this and let's going make this
02:40 - equal to first off it's an integer and
02:43 - let's make it equal to zero by default
02:47 - and uh what we can go ahead and do is we
02:49 - can make this into a variable we can
02:51 - access from other scripts and we do this
02:54 - by typing static in front of VAR so it's
02:58 - a static variable meaning that we can
03:00 - access it from all
03:03 - scripts uh cool so that's basically all
03:05 - we're going to do in here uh what we
03:08 - would do next is we are going to change
03:09 - this function to on GUI because every uh
03:14 - guy element is made in the on GUI
03:16 - function but I'm going to go ahead and
03:18 - talk about the uh guy system in a sec
03:22 - first off let's just make this variable
03:24 - actually change so uh you will notice
03:28 - that we can't see see this in the
03:31 - inspector so what we can just simply do
03:34 - is um go ahead and make a function uh
03:38 - that will uh allow us to see it in the
03:40 - inspector because static variables are
03:44 - invisible and we would like to just know
03:46 - if it's changing so to easily display it
03:50 - let's just make a normal variable that
03:52 - will that will be shown in the inspector
03:54 - and make it equal to the current Spore
03:57 - uh variable so let's just call this
04:00 - uh test and make it default to zero and
04:04 - then in the function update we'll just
04:06 - say test equals current score and round
04:10 - it off and now we should see a variable
04:13 - here that is zero by default try
04:17 - again uh wait for it to pop up we should
04:22 - see it in just a sec it's having trouble
04:25 - showing H and I can't select other
04:28 - objects it looks like I might need to
04:32 - quickly restart Unity because something
04:34 - has gone horribly wrong with the
04:36 - inspector here let's just yeah I'm just
04:41 - quickly going to reopen up
04:44 - Unity so give this a reboot I'm sorry
04:48 - but if this is enough I
04:51 - it's I don't want to cut it out so let's
04:55 - see if it's working now and select our
04:57 - GM and there it was so so we have the
05:00 - variable now uh I don't know why it
05:02 - acted so weird uh and I don't know why I
05:05 - can't dock it over here as I wanted to
05:09 - we can go under the layout and just uh
05:11 - select default great so now that
05:14 - everything is back to normal let's just
05:17 - go ahead and see uh what this variable
05:20 - does right now it simply stays zero no
05:23 - matter what we do because we need to
05:25 - find our coin and double click the coin
05:27 - pickup script and in here we need to
05:29 - change the
05:31 - score so uh we can see that we first off
05:35 - add this effect then we tell the effect
05:37 - to destroy after 3 seconds and then we
05:40 - destroy the game object and we've even
05:43 - added a add coin counter here debug.log
05:46 - so we know that this is where we need to
05:48 - do it in our code so let's just delete
05:50 - that and now we can go ahead and make
05:52 - the coin counting so it's very simple uh
05:56 - first off you give the name of the
05:58 - script that the variable is is stored in
06:00 - and remember we can only do this because
06:02 - we've made it a static variable so
06:05 - that's called game master then we say
06:08 - dot and then we can just uh type in the
06:11 - variable name which is current
06:14 - score and then we can set it to
06:17 - something uh but we won't just set it to
06:19 - a fixed value we want it to be one more
06:22 - than before so therefore we do plus
06:25 - equals say plus equals
06:30 - oops uh which will add on the number
06:33 - right after it onto its current value
06:36 - and then we do one because we only want
06:37 - to add one you can you could make coins
06:41 - that are worth let's say uh 10 scores if
06:44 - it's a huge coin that's hard to get or
06:47 - if it has another color or something uh
06:49 - and then what you simply want to do is
06:50 - you want to make a variable called um
06:53 - let's say coin value and make this
06:56 - default to one and then you can change
06:58 - the it in the uh inspector and instead
07:01 - of one here we'll just do
07:04 - coin value actually that's just leave
07:07 - that in that's handy to know if we want
07:09 - to make cool powerups or something great
07:12 - so let's see if it's
07:14 - working so what we can do is we can
07:17 - select our GM and now observe our test
07:20 - variable to see if it changes and it
07:23 - certainly does it changes to one so now
07:26 - that we know that this is working we can
07:28 - go ahead and delete our test we can
07:31 - delete the function update and we can
07:33 - make our first
07:34 - GUI now uh GUI is a pretty serious
07:38 - discussion in uh in unity uh basically
07:41 - Unity have been promising a new uh guy
07:45 - uh layout system something for so long
07:49 - as I can
07:50 - remember um but it should hopefully be
07:54 - done in the near future uh but the
07:58 - specifics we really don't know and the
08:01 - reason why everyone are so longing for
08:03 - this is that the current system is well
08:06 - to say it out clearly really bad uh so
08:10 - basically there are several ways to do
08:13 - uh DUI as this you can do it completely
08:15 - through scripting which is what we are
08:17 - going to do because this is the uh
08:19 - quickest and easiest way you can also do
08:22 - it using uh an ingame thing that unitive
08:26 - made called uh it's the if I see if I
08:29 - can even find it it's thei dii texture
08:33 - that's not really a viable option either
08:35 - and uh gu is just hard on the
08:38 - computer uh though if you are willing to
08:41 - pay for uh good DUI there is a plugin
08:45 - called n GUI that's just nggi like this
08:50 - on the unity asset store and it is a
08:52 - little expensive but it's in insanely uh
08:55 - well done and most professionals use it
08:58 - around the world uh and it's the same
09:00 - guy who made this plugin who is
09:01 - currently working on the solution for uh
09:04 - for Unity but until all of this gets
09:07 - cleared out let's just use the good old
09:09 - uh GUI system so in the function on uh
09:14 - GUI where all the guy code gets called
09:18 - let's type uh
09:20 - DUI dot let's do a
09:22 - label and uh we can see that a label
09:25 - first off wants a position then it wants
09:29 - some text so what we can do is we can
09:32 - first off get it uh give it the position
09:35 - so let's do uh new
09:39 - rect like this and open this up so new
09:43 - rectangle and in here we want to do uh
09:48 - screen do
09:51 - height and uh let's do
09:54 - times
09:58 - 0.5 comma
10:00 - screen.
10:02 - width uh you could also just do divided
10:05 - by two that's up to you and let's close
10:08 - this off and then comma and then the
10:10 - string name and this is just going to be
10:13 - uh
10:14 - score and uh then close it off and end
10:18 - it up with the parentheses or a
10:20 - semicolon of course so now when we try
10:23 - to hit play we get some errors uh first
10:26 - off we can see that I've spelled height
10:28 - wrong
10:29 - that's
10:30 - annoying uh
10:32 - height like that and let's see if this
10:36 - works right so uh it says that it
10:39 - doesn't match the argument list and uh
10:43 - this is
10:44 - because uh we need to use ai. box of
10:48 - course uh so we make a new
10:51 - rectangle and uh in here we also need to
10:54 - declare the sizes so we need to do let's
10:58 - try 200 by 200 at
11:01 - first uh so now it should be working and
11:04 - yes it is and before uh let me just show
11:08 - you what it looks like and then explain
11:10 - the code so now we can see the score is
11:12 - down here and it's in a very weird
11:15 - position and let me explain what's going
11:18 - on so basically first off we uh say to
11:22 - uh make a new rectangle first the
11:24 - position on the X so this actually needs
11:28 - to be with wi then the position on the Y
11:32 - so this needs to be height and then the
11:36 - uh size on the X and then the size on
11:39 - the Y and using screen do width we can
11:43 - make it in the center by simply saying
11:45 - that we uh we start in the left hand
11:48 - corner then we go all the way to the
11:50 - right with uh our screen width and then
11:53 - we just take half of that so that's in
11:56 - the center so I'm just going to do
11:58 - divide it by two here because I get
12:00 - distracted and uh it does the same with
12:02 - the height and this way it should now be
12:06 - in the complete Center so if we hit play
12:10 - it's not really and why is this well
12:14 - Unity orients itself using the top left
12:17 - corner so what's currently in in in the
12:21 - uh in the centry is the top left corner
12:24 - of our GUI element but we want the
12:27 - middle of the GUI element to be in um in
12:31 - the middle uh and this is this is
12:33 - logical so what we can simply do is we
12:35 - can subtract half the width and half the
12:39 - height and so uh the middle of our DU
12:42 - element will be in the actual
12:45 - middle um but before we do this it's
12:48 - easy to just make these into variables
12:50 - so we can change them inside of unity
12:53 - and don't have to go back into the
12:55 - script all the time so let's just make
12:57 - these into some variables so uh we want
13:00 - them to be in the center of the screen
13:02 - uh on the width but I want the score to
13:04 - be just a bit from the top of the uh the
13:08 - screen so we don't want this screen.
13:11 - height instead uh let's make a variable
13:13 - for that so let's call this um y offset
13:18 - let's call it offset
13:20 - Y and let's just make this a float equal
13:25 - to let's try 40 by default now we can go
13:29 - in here and just type offset y then uh
13:34 - on the X we are going to do another
13:37 - variable and we're going to call this
13:39 - VAR size X of type float and this is
13:45 - going to be equal to about 800 then
13:47 - we're going to do V size y also of type
13:51 - float and this is going to be equal to
13:54 - let's say
13:56 - 40 now if we save this of course we need
14:00 - to copy in our actual variables so size
14:03 - X and size y we can go into unity and we
14:08 - can see all of these properties appear
14:11 - and we can change them in here but you
14:14 - will notice it's still not centered
14:16 - we'll take care of this in just a sec
14:18 - this is just to get a general idea
14:20 - remember that whenever you tweak
14:22 - something it while in play mode the
14:25 - changes will disappear as soon as you
14:27 - stop playing so either you have to note
14:30 - them there is a handy pluging on the
14:32 - Ence store to uh or just remember them
14:36 - so I'll try to make the Y something like
14:40 - 20 uh
14:42 - 25 25 is pretty good and the Y is
14:46 - probably fine because we want to add in
14:48 - some uh
14:51 - some numbers too we could do something
14:54 - like 90 instead actually we can go all
14:57 - the way to 80 I I think that's fine so
15:00 - 80 or 90 and uh the offset y I'm pretty
15:03 - satisfied with that so 80 and 25 so stop
15:08 - playing and change this to 80 and this
15:11 - to
15:13 - 25 uh now we can go in here and we can
15:16 - just use these variable to subtract from
15:19 - so on the screen. width we can simply
15:21 - say minus and then we can do size
15:27 - X and then divide it by two and now when
15:32 - we save this and hit play the score is
15:36 - in the exact Century because we have
15:39 - subtracted half of our x
15:43 - value now let's make uh this actually
15:46 - show our score because right now it just
15:48 - said says score so let's make uh it
15:51 - score colon and then a space and then
15:55 - outside of these parentheses you need to
15:58 - say plus current
16:01 - score and if you don't want it to say
16:04 - anything but only display the number you
16:06 - have to have these two parentheses but
16:09 - without anything in between so you still
16:11 - have to leave them there but I wanted to
16:13 - say the
16:14 - score so now we hit play and it says
16:16 - score zero when we roll into our ball it
16:19 - says score one and we have a beautiful
16:21 - label there to display the score so
16:24 - that's basically it for this video I
16:26 - hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you the
16:28 - next
16:29 - [Music]
16:39 - one
