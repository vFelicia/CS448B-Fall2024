00:00 - it's often considered ideal for gameplay
00:01 - and storytelling to sort of go hand in
00:03 - hand for me at least that's very
00:06 - important I mean we all know the feeling
00:07 - of being in the middle of an awesome
00:09 - game you're shooting stuff reloading
00:11 - charging at your opponent and suddenly
00:13 - unskipable cutscenesthat's Ori is
00:20 - uninteresting but when it interrupts the
00:22 - experience of the game you're playing it
00:23 - starts to feel like an obstruction or as
00:25 - if it's been added on top of an already
00:27 - existing game that's why it's often a
00:30 - good idea to try to incorporate this
00:31 - story into other aspects of it games
00:33 - design they're of course a million
00:35 - different ways to do this but in this
00:37 - video I'm going to highlight a few games
00:39 - that I personally think do it very well
00:41 - so let's get started one of the most
00:43 - simple ways of telling a story is to do
00:46 - exactly that tell it the narrator in
00:49 - Thomas was alone brilliant voiced by
00:51 - Danny Wallace tells the story of a group
00:53 - of colored rectangles on a journey to
00:56 - find purpose and he does so in past
00:58 - tense this all seemed a little dangerous
01:02 - the world was not to be trusted this
01:05 - makes for a very linear way of giving
01:07 - narrative to the player the player can
01:09 - simply lean back and passively let the
01:11 - story unfold as they go along
01:13 - the narrator tells the story from
01:14 - Thomas's point of view yet he often
01:17 - informs the player about what the other
01:19 - characters are thinking and feeling her
01:24 - continued existence was breaking some
01:25 - kind of natural order this is a very
01:29 - direct way of storytelling the narrator
01:31 - explicitly says what the characters feel
01:33 - and think it's actually kind of genius
01:35 - because being a one-man studio this
01:37 - allows Mike Bissell to communicate
01:39 - emotion using very simple visual
01:41 - elements added up with a lot of humor
01:43 - thomas was alone is an example of how
01:45 - even colored rectangles can be the
01:47 - subjects of interesting storytelling
01:49 - Stanley's parable on the other hand is a
01:52 - game that changes this simple way of
01:53 - narration this game is in no way linear
01:56 - the play is constantly presented with
01:58 - choices they have to make and these
02:00 - choices will have further consequence on
02:01 - the rest of the game and this is where
02:03 - the writing of the game excels because
02:05 - no matter what the player chooses the
02:07 - narrator always has an opinion about it
02:10 - you really still in the broom closet
02:11 - standing around doing nothing
02:13 - Bonnie please offer me some explanation
02:16 - here I'm genuinely confused it almost
02:19 - feels like you're breaking the rules of
02:20 - the game when you are faced with two
02:22 - doors and choose to walk through the one
02:24 - on the right while the narrator is
02:25 - explicitly telling you that he entered
02:28 - the door and is left the game is filled
02:30 - with these kinds of contradictions it
02:32 - served to both confuse the player and
02:34 - create a very surreal experience of
02:36 - playing the game and more importantly
02:37 - creating this story - eight four five
02:41 - but of course
02:43 - Stanley couldn't possibly have known
02:45 - this yet incredibly by simply pushing
02:49 - random buttons on the keypad
02:51 - Stanley happened to input the correct
02:53 - code by sheer luck amazing as it happens
02:57 - Stanley's parable has 19 achievable
03:00 - endings and the players actions
03:01 - throughout the game have direct
03:03 - influence on which one they'd get this
03:05 - to me is one of the most unique ways of
03:07 - storytelling allowing the player to
03:09 - create their own I think something that
03:11 - is often underestimated is the
03:13 - importance of perspective in video games
03:15 - experiencing a game in first-person can
03:17 - let the players see and act from another
03:20 - person's point of view some games take
03:22 - advantage of this by spending a lot of
03:23 - time developing the player character
03:25 - while others take the opposite approach
03:27 - by giving away almost no information
03:29 - about the character they make it easier
03:32 - for the player to project themselves
03:33 - onto them if done right this can help
03:36 - eliminate the boundary between the
03:37 - player and the game half-life 2 is a
03:39 - great example of this Gordon Freeman
03:42 - being completely silent is a way of not
03:44 - giving him personality also half-life 2
03:49 - never breaks the first-person point of
03:51 - view much like in real life the
03:53 - information you get about the story
03:54 - doesn't come from a line of text
03:56 - magically appearing in front of you but
03:58 - from observing the world around you the
04:00 - game doesn't tell you what to do
04:02 - instead it places you in a world and
04:03 - lets you figure out for yourself what
04:05 - you want to make of it in its article on
04:07 - the subject jake shapiro gives an
04:09 - example of how this is actually done a
04:11 - cop stops you deliberately knocks over a
04:14 - soda can and orders you to pick it up
04:17 - refused and the cop will be
04:20 - this is a great way to teach the players
04:22 - something as basic as which Keys pick up
04:25 - and throw objects but if you think about
04:26 - it it does so much more than that
04:28 - it shows us the play one of the key
04:30 - features of the game story the people
04:32 - are being terrorized and forced to
04:34 - follow orders and what's also extremely
04:36 - interesting is how the game makes it
04:38 - appear as if picking up the can is a
04:41 - free choice this makes the play feel
04:43 - like they're responsible for driving the
04:45 - story forward which in turn keeps the
04:47 - player invested in the game another game
04:49 - that does a great job immersing the
04:51 - player and making them feel like they're
04:53 - the one playing the game is an old
04:55 - favorite of mine the portal series
04:57 - how can valve be so amazing at this just
05:00 - like in half-life 2 the protagonist
05:01 - Chell is completely silent you can only
05:04 - see her through the portals she places
05:06 - one of the most important characters of
05:08 - the game GLaDOS is an example of using
05:10 - the same element for multiple narrative
05:13 - purposes
05:14 - first of all GLaDOS is one of the main
05:15 - characters and she has a rich
05:17 - interesting personality for the player
05:19 - to explore but at the same time she's
05:21 - also the narrator in some ways the
05:23 - classic all-knowing narrator that we've
05:25 - seen Thomas was alone but allowing
05:27 - GLaDOS personality and her own evil
05:29 - agenda to sort of peep through the
05:31 - seemingly innocent narration is a really
05:34 - clever trick and it helps make the story
05:36 - flow incredibly well the enrichment
05:41 - and reminds you that Android hell is a
05:43 - real place she isn't just some free
05:45 - recorded voice GLaDOS is there with you
05:48 - commenting on your actions as you go
05:51 - along mocking you all your other friends
05:53 - couldn't come either because you don't
05:55 - have any other friends because of how
05:57 - unlikable you are this is the sort of
05:59 - writing that plays a major role in
06:01 - keeping the player interested and
06:03 - engaged another game that is interesting
06:06 - in terms of storytelling is heavy rain
06:08 - credit by david cage this game has no
06:10 - immediate game over state instead the
06:13 - action should take and how you perform
06:14 - during the game influenced the narrative
06:17 - and how the story ends if you think
06:19 - about it this is actually a great way
06:20 - for the player to become invested in the
06:22 - story much like in real life
06:24 - you don't get another chance instead you
06:26 - have to do your best through a series of
06:28 - situations and the outcome of each
06:30 - situation actually has an impact on the
06:32 - future narrative what a brilliant way
06:34 - for the player the story and the game to
06:36 - come all together but in the end it's
06:38 - not always necessary to play around with
06:40 - the possibilities and structures of
06:41 - video games to tell a good story now
06:43 - plenty examples of games that utilize
06:45 - what you might call classic narrative
06:47 - structure really well these games make
06:49 - use of a bunch of elements like
06:51 - cutscenes text and dialogue to
06:53 - effectively tell a story a great example
06:56 - of this is the much-loved The Last of Us
06:58 - so in conclusion video games is a great
07:00 - platform for telling a story there's so
07:03 - much you can do with it but the best way
07:05 - of telling a story is always going to
07:07 - depend on the setting the gameplay and
07:09 - of course the story itself that's pretty
07:12 - much it for this video if you enjoyed it
