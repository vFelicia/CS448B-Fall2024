00:00 - [Music]
00:03 - hello everyone and welcome to the eighth
00:05 - tutorial in our survival game series
00:08 - done by brackets I am the CEO of
00:10 - brackets and today we are going to take
00:12 - a look at creating terrains and applying
00:15 - textures so generally we'll make it look
00:19 - a lot better much more exciting and
00:24 - stuff so let's get started by opening up
00:28 - unity I've already done this as usual
00:30 - and the project is exactly as we left it
00:38 - so yeah let's go ahead first of all we
00:42 - could create a terrain so to do this
00:45 - let's get rid of our ground plane maybe
00:48 - not deleted just selected and disable it
00:51 - using this little checkbox right here so
00:56 - now we doesn't we do not have anything
01:00 - to stand on so let's fix this by going
01:02 - to terrain create terrain so basically
01:08 - once you create a terrain it is gigantic
01:13 - it's absolutely huge probably four nine
01:18 - 99.9% of all games this is too big so
01:22 - let's go ahead and adjust it to make it
01:25 - smaller um I love feasible people don't
01:27 - know how to do this correctly so let's
01:30 - just right-click and name this mmm you
01:34 - know what let's just keep it at terrain
01:36 - for now and we can rename it to maybe
01:40 - grass Hills later or something more
01:43 - specific okay so for now we can go up
01:46 - onto the terrain tab once one more time
01:50 - and now hit the set resolution so this
01:54 - is basically the length and width and
01:59 - height in units detering is going to be
02:02 - and when I say height I mean maximum
02:05 - height so when once we start sculpting
02:08 - some of the mountains that's just the
02:11 - limit of how high
02:12 - we can get with the terrain by default
02:15 - this plane right here is at zero unit so
02:18 - it's from zero to by default 600 but we
02:23 - are going to change this so we could
02:26 - start out by trying something like
02:28 - pretty big still 500 by 300 by 500 one
02:37 - thing that is very important is that you
02:40 - do not change the relationship between
02:43 - between width and length they need to be
02:46 - exactly the same let me show you why so
02:49 - if we go ahead and set the resolution
02:50 - and hit F so we can see the whole plane
02:54 - you can see that this down here is all
02:57 - light so it's still gigantic maybe we
03:00 - should scale it down a little more but
03:03 - if I just turn off the lighting in the
03:05 - scene by hitting this little light we
03:08 - can get a better look and once I use my
03:11 - go to the right hand that's like the
03:13 - sculpting or painting tool you can see
03:17 - that this has a fine blue little mark on
03:22 - the plane and once we start I'll just
03:25 - use the sculpt to demonstrate you start
03:28 - sculpting it looks fine but if I go
03:30 - ahead and change the resolution to let's
03:32 - say 500 100 even though you might want
03:36 - to do this you can see that the brush
03:40 - itself also get scaled so if you want
03:45 - something to just happen along this kind
03:49 - maybe you're doing a side scroll and
03:52 - want everything to be seen from the side
03:54 - so you don't want that much depth just
03:57 - make the terrain just set the resolution
04:00 - to the same I think we'll go with 400 by
04:03 - 400 instead but set the width and length
04:07 - to the same and then just focus on
04:09 - detail here and that the rest be okay so
04:15 - we have our huge plane let's make sure
04:19 - that this is somewhat centered in the
04:21 - scene because by default in unity
04:26 - our terrain has a is anchored at the
04:32 - lower corner so let's go ahead and drag
04:36 - this green box and this can just be done
04:41 - by eye or we could type in half of 200
04:44 - some - oh sorry my half of 400 some -
04:50 - 200 and - 200 but it won't matter
04:55 - all right so if we zoom in a little I
04:58 - think the first thing that we kind of
05:01 - need to do is to create a one big
05:05 - tileable texture a texture and we can
05:08 - then later on paint details so on this
05:11 - will just give us some sort of reference
05:13 - it'll make everything easier to see so
05:18 - first off all let's go to navigate to
05:22 - our browser and sorry I was just on
05:25 - YouTube navigate to a browser go to
05:29 - google and search for anything this
05:31 - could be free ground seamless texture
05:38 - and seamless means means that it can be
05:41 - tiled without creating these ugly kind
05:46 - of edges so pick anything you want I'm
05:50 - going to go with some kind of grass this
05:54 - looks alright I'm not too convinced
05:58 - though generally you don't want
06:01 - something with terrible textures you
06:04 - don't want one big line through all they
06:07 - need it needs to be like just blade with
06:10 - all the detail because else you can see
06:12 - it tiling and you don't want the texture
06:17 - to be too big either so on for now I'll
06:21 - just go with this I think now that's
06:25 - pretty bad I'm okay so I'll go with this
06:33 - one
06:34 - this one looks great there are some
06:37 - marks that we
06:38 - can probably see when once it's good it
06:42 - gets child but let's save it out as
06:45 - grass texture so one and just simply
06:50 - drag it into unity and now we select our
06:55 - terrain and go under the paint tap the
06:59 - little brush hit the Edit textures and
07:02 - hit add texture and you can just drag
07:05 - the grass under the texture and I'll
07:08 - guess that the size needs to be ten by
07:11 - ten so this is basically how big each
07:15 - tile is going to be and let's hit the
07:19 - Add button and you can see that from a
07:22 - distance it looks horrible but once we
07:25 - go in and play it looks much better it
07:29 - does not contain that much detail though
07:33 - this looks something that could be
07:34 - played on a web browser so let's go back
07:37 - and maybe um change the size down to
07:41 - something like five times five remember
07:45 - that each time you scale the number down
07:47 - more tiles need to be created though
07:51 - this is not the most important the most
07:53 - important is that once you see it from a
07:55 - distance you can see the pattern start
07:58 - appearing so it's really about finding
08:02 - the right balance this is well it's
08:05 - alright we'll go with it for now so once
08:09 - we have this let's create a better light
08:12 - to light up everything because now every
08:14 - object is not white so it's easy to see
08:17 - how we should light it so let's go to
08:20 - game object and create audio and select
08:24 - the directional light and this might be
08:27 - it's a bit too much though so we can
08:29 - change the intensity down to 0.3 and we
08:36 - can go ahead and select it in our scene
08:39 - may be stirring out the transform if you
08:42 - want I'll just drag it off a bit
08:44 - remember the thing about directional
08:46 - lights is that it won't
08:48 - two Reds placed in the scene it's just
08:51 - it just will matter though how it is
08:54 - rotated so it's just light emitting from
08:58 - one source so this is basically the Sun
09:01 - emitting from up there and so I'll place
09:05 - the light something like this so if we
09:07 - go ahead and play you shouldn't have too
09:09 - many arkla shadows and this looks much
09:12 - better um kind of looks like gmat
09:14 - actually that's a good thing and yeah so
09:19 - let's hit the stop playing button and
09:23 - disable the light once again in the
09:25 - scene I just like working this way
09:27 - select the terrain and go under the
09:30 - first tab on the right hand side this is
09:33 - the sculpting and and this is basically
09:37 - for creating mountains if you want a
09:40 - mountain that stops at a specific height
09:43 - you can use the next tab where you can
09:47 - then adjust how high and then create
09:52 - these kind of mountains or Hills or
09:57 - whatever you want to call them
09:58 - so um okay let's go back under the
10:01 - sculpting and let's maybe create a kind
10:06 - of a bounding box some kind of the
10:09 - restrictions of the level by creating
10:10 - some some mountains and notice when I
10:14 - start scaling up and look from the side
10:17 - this part of the terrain doesn't get
10:21 - drawn this reduces the amount of
10:24 - vertices that needs to be drawn by the
10:26 - graphics card but you also have to be
10:30 - aware that you don't get these ugly
10:33 - glitches so on something like this again
10:38 - please go into more detail line than I
10:41 - do I'm just trying to show you some of
10:44 - the techniques maybe change the brush
10:47 - size up a little bit so we can get some
10:51 - bigger mountains make it very doesn't
10:55 - need to be this squarey we can make some
10:59 - mountains then go out and
11:01 - different sites maybe we could have kind
11:04 - of a see like area here a little pool
11:08 - and so just creating the bounding box
11:14 - something like this and this will do
11:18 - maybe even some more detail some
11:23 - mountains there this is what it looks
11:27 - like now in game this is not too bad
11:31 - actually so once you have painted some
11:35 - of these details what shot for doing too
11:39 - much detail the places where the
11:42 - character is running it can be annoying
11:44 - that he bounces up and down all the time
11:48 - because of of these little the bumps so
11:52 - please don't do that only do that the
11:55 - places he isn't at so maybe at the
11:57 - mountains you want to select a different
11:59 - kind of brush something with a lot of
12:02 - detail and maybe scale the brush size
12:05 - down a bit and you can get these
12:07 - cool-looking mountains so if I just do
12:11 - this on a part of the mountain and go
12:13 - ahead and hit play you can see that the
12:15 - mountains look a lot more organic now
12:18 - but go ahead and play around with this
12:21 - I'll just make a quick some quick detail
12:24 - around the edge well this might be too
12:28 - much this is of course hard on the
12:32 - computer than just the ordinary smooth
12:37 - mountains but it does really look cool
12:41 - so why not okay so let's previous wow
12:52 - this is cool
12:53 - okay so um this is what I'll go with for
12:56 - now what you can then do is you can go
12:59 - under the terrain settings under the
13:04 - last tab and you can turn up stuff like
13:08 - the pixel array so this will in game
13:10 - effect how many errors the terrain
13:14 - allows
13:14 - for us on longer distances so you can
13:18 - see once I get closer the terrain start
13:21 - to fix itself itself up you generally
13:25 - want to leave this between 5 and 15
13:29 - anything about that just gets mad so
13:34 - totally squid squished so I'll leave
13:37 - this at 9 and the shadow distance won't
13:40 - matter
13:41 - I wanted to cast shadows and the rest
13:45 - we'll play with later one thing that can
13:48 - affect how heavy the terrain is on your
13:51 - computer is if you go under set
13:53 - resolution then the base texture
13:55 - resolution will do quite a bit so play
13:58 - around with that
13:58 - also remember to only use so only use
14:04 - numbers that can be divided by two so
14:08 - this would be 512 Oh 128 64 32 numbers
14:19 - in in that order
14:20 - please do that at 250 no 265 no 56 and
14:26 - and so on so forth so okay let's let's
14:35 - go ahead and continue so let's paint on
14:37 - some detail so if we again select the
14:40 - terrain and the terrain script I had not
14:42 - collapsed and then go ahead and hit the
14:46 - paint tab we can add a new texture so
14:49 - let's go go online and find a new
14:51 - texture so something free stone texture
15:02 - seamless or tile
15:05 - you can probably type in both and while
15:09 - that's a that's really nice that one and
15:12 - let's see how it looks in game so save
15:15 - that out and drag it to unity and we'll
15:21 - rename this to stone texture so one
15:27 - and we'll go back to our terrain edit
15:31 - textures and texture dragon that stone
15:34 - texture select probably ten to five
15:40 - remember things that are in the distance
15:43 - as mountains generally they are don't
15:45 - bother
15:46 - giving them too much detail so now you
15:49 - can see that we have yet another texture
15:51 - that we can select so we can select this
15:54 - and then just start painting over the
15:58 - mountains witness so watch out for the
16:06 - smoothly transitions generally want this
16:10 - to be pretty harsh Elsa can look really
16:15 - weird but play around with this again
16:18 - I'm just demonstrating how to use the
16:21 - different tools oh I made a mistake
16:28 - there so something like this I think
16:34 - that's all right so we go ahead and play
16:37 - it back you can see that it actually
16:40 - starts looking like something that could
16:42 - be in real life except back maybe so
16:45 - let's go ahead and fix this to the side
16:49 - here oh so I had make sure that you
16:52 - select the stone texture paint out some
16:56 - detail if you just want small layers of
17:00 - stone not the very harsh ones you can go
17:04 - ahead and bring down the opacity and
17:07 - this is basically how much you can see
17:10 - through the texture also you could do
17:14 - stuff like this to create even more
17:17 - detail I want Bobby so this looks pretty
17:21 - good yeah it looks fine so you could go
17:26 - ahead and import some more grass
17:29 - textures some more ground textures to
17:31 - vary it up and maybe even well I guess
17:35 - we'll take it a look at creating some
17:37 - trees and some some
17:38 - moving grass and stuff like this in
17:41 - another tutorial but for now this is how
17:43 - our world is going to look I am afraid
17:47 - that I did not cover the material and
17:51 - texture apply meant to objects we'll do
17:53 - this in a nonde tutorial as well and
17:57 - weapon switching it's on its way
18:00 - also the enemy scripting that will also
18:04 - come out I have no idea I can get time
18:08 - enough to do all this but guys i
18:11 - brakus site is up brakus con you can go
18:15 - ahead and download everything and very
18:17 - soon a downloadable RAR file i think
18:22 - it's going to be available with all the
18:25 - scripts that I type out and the assets
18:27 - that I create so you don't have to go
18:29 - ahead and model the amounts and for now
18:32 - they're free I have added a donate
18:35 - button so if you like what we do and
18:38 - think that you want to just give
18:41 - something back you are you can decide
18:43 - exactly how much it needs to be it'll
18:47 - just go for this for sound sound some
18:52 - stuff video making tools unity plugins
18:56 - that I could cover
18:58 - and maybe even doing some things in
19:00 - unity Pro if I can
19:03 - get my hands on that much buy them you
19:06 - really don't have to it's just if you
19:08 - want to but for now thanks for watching
19:10 - and I'll see you in the next video
19:14 - [Music]
