00:03 - hello everyone and welcome to video
00:05 - number 31 Part B in our survival games
00:09 - series in this one we are going to dig
00:11 - straight into the coding of the weapon
00:14 - functionality where we left off in the
00:17 - last video so if you don't know what I'm
00:20 - talking about go ahead and click the
00:23 - link in the description to watch video
00:26 - number 31 part a this is again part b
00:30 - cool
00:30 - so as always I've opened our B unit C
00:33 - and you can see that we left off with an
00:38 - error so if we just open up the weapon
00:41 - script in monodevelop there we go and
00:45 - the error is caused by a missing
00:47 - parenthesis in the if statement with the
00:50 - distance here so let's just close that
00:53 - up save it and if we head out we should
00:56 - see the error disappearing if we had
00:58 - clear it doesn't see if I save this
01:03 - properly ah d if distance oops wrong if
01:09 - statement it's in the physics that
01:11 - raycast there we go so hit the
01:15 - parenthesis there and the errors
01:17 - disappear
01:19 - awesome so for now we have taken care of
01:22 - the damaging the raycast shooting the
01:26 - delay and we have just used the animator
01:30 - down here and now we are going to take
01:33 - care of the animation and this is a
01:37 - little tricky since we want it to be
01:39 - somewhat random which hand our character
01:43 - uses to hit the target with but we still
01:47 - want to have some control over it since
01:49 - a random value tends to send out the
01:53 - same in a cascade of sometimes three to
01:57 - four to even five times in a row so that
02:00 - we will have the right hand punching a
02:03 - bunch of times before the left hand
02:05 - starts going and that's really unnatural
02:08 - so what we're going to be doing is we
02:10 - are going to be using the hit one streak
02:13 - and the hit - streak - and set a limit
02:16 - to how many times one hand could hit
02:19 - before the other ones come in action so
02:22 - in the function attack damage will make
02:25 - a new chapter before the yield wait for
02:28 - a second statement and in here we'll
02:31 - type if random dot value is less than or
02:38 - equal to 0.5 and use two of these and
02:45 - symbols and hit zero streak is less than
02:55 - or equal to two like that then we want
03:05 - something to happen so let's open up the
03:07 - bracket keys and in here we want to type
03:10 - the animator dot set bull and this is
03:15 - for boolean as I explained in the last
03:17 - video this will allow us to change your
03:19 - property inside of the animated window
03:21 - so that we can have the animations play
03:25 - and we're going to type hit 1 and it's
03:29 - going to be true so we want to hit
03:31 - something and the cool thing about this
03:34 - is that it will automatically stop
03:36 - playing whenever it has finished the
03:39 - animation because that something we set
03:42 - up inside of the controller okay cool so
03:46 - below this we want the hit zero streak
03:51 - to be plus equals one so we want to
03:56 - increase it by one every time we hit and
03:59 - we want the hit to streak to be equal to
04:04 - zero because now we have just hit with
04:07 - our right hand and so our left hand
04:09 - streak goes back to zero if these
04:14 - requirements aren't made myths we want
04:17 - to do something else so type LS and then
04:19 - open up the bracket keys and inside of
04:22 - those we type if
04:24 - hit two streak is less than or equal to
04:31 - two and the brackets there then we want
04:42 - the animator dot set bowl with the
04:52 - variable hit zero two to be true meaning
04:58 - that if we have a value of less of less
05:04 - than 0.5 or or our hit streak has been
05:09 - has been reached its maximum its maximum
05:13 - number we want to go down here and we
05:16 - want to find out if our hit two streak
05:19 - has hit it head has hit its limit and if
05:23 - it hasn't we want to play the hip to go
05:25 - animation and then we want the hit one
05:28 - streak to be equal to zero
05:31 - and the hit two streak to be equal plus
05:36 - equals one so and if these requirements
05:45 - aren't met open up the bracket so else
05:49 - bracket keys then we want the animator
05:54 - that set Bowl this is a lot of boring
05:57 - coding yet one to be true and we want of
06:05 - course to hit one streak you guessed it
06:09 - to be plus equals one because now we are
06:11 - hitting with our right hand again and we
06:15 - want the heroes the hit to streak to be
06:19 - equal to 0 because the streak has ended
06:22 - and that should pretty much be it let's
06:26 - go ahead and finally try this out and we
06:29 - can see we have several errors which is
06:32 - quite impressive and if we go ahead and
06:35 - select the play go on the main camp
06:38 - our arms arm amateur Master in arm right
06:43 - arm right hand right hold right Melia
06:47 - net fists we can see that our weapon
06:50 - script is attached and now we can go
06:52 - ahead and adjust just these values just
06:56 - to how we want them so the distance that
07:02 - set that to the distance here that
07:06 - should be private I think could easily
07:09 - make that private let's go ahead and hit
07:11 - play and something is not working let's
07:18 - see the game freezes I'll just quickly
07:21 - go ahead and pause the video and then be
07:24 - back in a sec okay so we can see down
07:27 - here that it says we have an unassigned
07:29 - reference exception the variable of the
07:32 - animated weapon has not been assigned so
07:35 - what we simply need to do is we need to
07:37 - go to the animated variable here and we
07:41 - need to select our arms 5 this is
07:44 - because we want to access the animator
07:46 - in order to play animations now we can
07:50 - hit play again and it should be working
07:53 - and whenever we hit something you can
07:58 - see that it plays a random animation and
08:01 - if the streak gets up to 2 it will shift
08:05 - to the other hand this makes the hitting
08:08 - feel random but it's still inside of
08:11 - control range so that's really awesome
08:15 - and we can see the distance changing
08:17 - just right and we can therefore we can
08:21 - easily adjust the max distance by using
08:23 - a pole like this we can go up and say
08:26 - hey we want to hit at this distance we
08:29 - can click it I mean can observe that the
08:32 - distance now is 0.98 and therefore we
08:36 - might want to change the max distance of
08:38 - the hitting to something like zero one
08:41 - point three just to go a little
08:43 - overboard I will leave it at 1.5 it's
08:47 - really up to you the damage delay is
08:50 - something you can also go
08:52 - adjust I'll just show you a quick and
08:54 - easy way to adjust this and that's done
08:57 - by going into our weapon script here and
09:00 - then whenever we want to adjust this we
09:05 - can just make a debug log statement
09:08 - right after the wait for seconds saying
09:11 - hit and therefore we can observe just
09:16 - when the debug log statement appears so
09:21 - that we can make it time there that's
09:25 - actually pretty close the debug that log
09:27 - statement is a little delayed and
09:29 - therefore we can go ahead and bump dial
09:32 - down the damage delay just a tad let's
09:35 - just try 0.4 and there we have it I
09:40 - think that's pretty well synchronized
09:42 - and now we can go ahead and delete that
09:45 - again so that's a great way to a great
09:48 - and simple way to sync up the damage
09:51 - delay with the animations you can of
09:56 - course go ahead and attach other weapons
09:58 - I'm definitely going to make a video in
10:02 - the near future showing you how to set
10:04 - up weapons for the inventory system and
10:06 - we are going to be using them and the
10:10 - animations should work just fine with
10:12 - them too so that's pretty much it for
10:14 - this video guys I'll just finish up by
10:18 - making some of these unnecessary
10:20 - variables private so private the hit one
10:23 - streak private the hit two streak and
10:27 - private the distance you really don't
10:31 - need those so thanks for watching I hope
10:34 - you enjoyed the video and I'll see you
10:36 - in the next video
