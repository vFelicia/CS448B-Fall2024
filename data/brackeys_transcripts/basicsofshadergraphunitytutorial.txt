00:00 - you guys see this I'm actually the gun
00:01 - in ten I think I've been out in the Sun
00:03 - for too long
00:04 - luckily today we're talking about shade
00:06 - first so shader graph is unities new
00:08 - node based shader editor it allows you
00:10 - to create all kinds of cool effects and
00:12 - generally just alter the visual
00:14 - appearance of your game kata graph is a
00:16 - huge tour and can be used to create
00:18 - anything from flowing lava to Holograms
00:21 - to sprite animations and post-processing
00:23 - effects so far all this stuff has been
00:25 - done by writing custom shaders by hand
00:28 - but with shader graph we can do
00:29 - everything visually and in a fraction of
00:32 - the time for someone like me who's just
00:33 - terrible at writing shaders shader graph
00:36 - is an amazing tool and I don't think
00:38 - I've ever been this excited about a
00:40 - unity feature alright enough talking
00:42 - about it let's start using it but first
00:44 - this video is sponsored by bolt
00:46 - both is an awesome visual scripting tool
00:49 - that allows you to quickly and easily
00:51 - program from within the unity editor
00:53 - without writing a single line of code
00:55 - the cool thing is that both works in
00:57 - much the same way as shader graph it's a
00:59 - completely note based visual tool
01:01 - however instead of just creating shaders
01:03 - both opens up the full power of C sharp
01:05 - scripting in unity along with the
01:07 - ability to live edit your graphs while
01:09 - in play mode personally I'm extremely
01:12 - impressed with this tool as I think it
01:14 - combines the best of what I've seen from
01:16 - other visual scripting solutions to get
01:19 - started simply click the link in the
01:20 - description and download both from the
01:22 - unity asset store alright
01:24 - it's shader time so the first thing that
01:26 - we want to do is make sure we're using
01:27 - unity 2000 18.1 or later I'm using unity
01:31 - hub so for me that means going to
01:33 - installs as you can see I'm currently
01:34 - using 2018 point 1.1 will then create a
01:37 - new project and here under template we
01:40 - need to change to the lightweight render
01:42 - pipeline shader graph is currently only
01:44 - available using this template but
01:45 - support for other templates is coming
01:47 - now I've gone ahead and created a quick
01:49 - example scene the only things that I
01:51 - have is a camera a couple of lights a
01:53 - tiny bit of post-processing and of
01:55 - course this monkey and as with any
01:58 - object in our game this monkey has a
02:00 - material the material is currently just
02:02 - using this standard shader so let's
02:04 - change this by creating our own custom
02:06 - shader we're going to be creating a cool
02:08 - glowy shader that looks like this but
02:10 - first it's a good idea to make sure
02:11 - we're using the newest for
02:12 - of shadowgraph to do that we'll go to
02:14 - window and open up the new package
02:16 - manager here we can see all the
02:18 - different packages currently in our
02:20 - project you'll notice that the shader
02:21 - graph package isn't actually in here but
02:24 - that's because it's part of the render
02:25 - pipelines lightweight in my case this
02:27 - also has an update available so I'm just
02:29 - gonna go ahead and update it so now we
02:31 - own the newest version of shader graph
02:32 - and we're ready to go ahead and create
02:34 - our shader let's right-click in our
02:35 - project go create under shader here we
02:38 - can see the normal shaders as well as
02:40 - three new options ending with graph
02:42 - let's select the PP our graph will give
02:45 - the shader name I'm gonna call it monkey
02:47 - underscore shader and now to open this
02:49 - up in shader graph we simply double
02:51 - click it and this entirely new window is
02:53 - going to pop up as with any other window
02:55 - in unity we can dock this anywhere we
02:57 - want or maximize and minimize it I
02:59 - normally have this in full screen on my
03:01 - secondary monitor but for now I'm just
03:02 - gonna make it into a window and maximize
03:05 - that window and by default when we open
03:07 - shader graph we have only one note this
03:09 - is our PBR master node master notes in
03:12 - shader graph represent our final output
03:14 - right away you will notice that you know
03:17 - most of these settings from the normal
03:18 - standard shader
03:19 - we can change the albedo I'm gonna go
03:21 - ahead and make it some kind of blue here
03:23 - that's the slot for normal emission
03:25 - metallic and all that good stuff and the
03:27 - cool thing is that instead of just
03:28 - controlling these through textures we
03:31 - now control them using different nodes
03:33 - so in order to try and make our object
03:35 - glow around the edges we need to modify
03:38 - our emission however if we just go ahead
03:41 - and change our emission for the entire
03:42 - object well we can see that the result
03:45 - isn't particularly interesting instead
03:47 - let's go ahead and create our own node
03:49 - by the way to move around you can use
03:51 - alt and click or just the middle mouse
03:53 - button and you can scroll to zoom so to
03:56 - create a new node we can either
03:57 - right-click go create node or sim to use
03:59 - the keyboard shortcut which is space
04:01 - this brings up a tiny panel where we
04:03 - have different categories for different
04:05 - nodes and you'll quickly see just how
04:07 - many different nodes are actually in
04:09 - here and on top of that new nodes are
04:11 - constantly being added so it's safe to
04:13 - say that we won't be going over all the
04:15 - nodes in this tutorial so the note that
04:17 - we want to create here is what we refer
04:19 - to as Fornell so I'm just gonna go ahead
04:21 - and search for that now you can see it
04:23 - pops up let's click it and voila we've
04:25 - created a
04:26 - effect note now understanding how the
04:28 - different notes in shader graph where it
04:30 - can be extremely math heavy luckily we
04:33 - can always see a visual representation
04:34 - of what the node is doing so in terms of
04:37 - deep Fornell effect it's creating this
04:38 - circular ramp and we can control the
04:41 - power of that ramp using this value here
04:43 - for now I'm just gonna set it to
04:44 - something like three we then take the
04:46 - output of this node and drag it right
04:48 - into the emission input of our master
04:50 - node and right away we can see that we
04:52 - get this glowing effect so next let's
04:54 - add a way to control the color of our
04:56 - for now to do this we need a color node
04:59 - so that saves space let's search for
05:00 - color and hit enter now this is a really
05:03 - simple node it doesn't take in any
05:05 - inputs instead we can just select a
05:07 - color I'm gonna choose some kind of
05:09 - bright orange and we want to combine
05:12 - this with or for another fact to do that
05:14 - we create another node so that's hit
05:16 - space and this time we want to create a
05:18 - multiply node this of course allows us
05:21 - to multiply together two different
05:22 - inputs and get a result let's remove the
05:25 - old connection here by selecting it and
05:27 - hitting delete and it's instead connect
05:29 - our fernell out with the first multiply
05:32 - input and the output of our color with
05:34 - the second multiply input and right away
05:36 - we can see the result we then take the
05:38 - output of this multiply node and put it
05:41 - into emission and well now we can now
05:43 - use the color field to control the color
05:46 - of our Fornell so this is a really cool
05:48 - example of how this node based way of
05:50 - thinking works you can bind together
05:52 - different nodes in order to create
05:54 - interesting results and pretty much all
05:56 - nodes work this way there's some kind of
05:59 - input in our case d4 nil and color the
06:02 - node does some magical processing behind
06:04 - the scenes and spits out a result and if
06:06 - you ever wonder what a node does you can
06:09 - always right-click on it and hit open
06:11 - documentation and this will open up a
06:13 - documentation page for that particular
06:15 - node with a description of what it does
06:17 - which kinds of input and output it has a
06:20 - supposed to function that it executes
06:21 - behind the scenes so that's really cool
06:24 - now there's definitely some more we can
06:25 - do with this I'm gonna change the color
06:27 - mode from default to HDR because we are
06:30 - working with emission here and so I'm
06:32 - gonna go in and bump up the intensity to
06:34 - say 1 just to make the glow a bit
06:36 - stronger and of course if we save this
06:39 - acid now
06:40 - and go back into unity we can easily
06:42 - apply it to our monkey all we need to do
06:44 - is select our monkey material and under
06:47 - the shader will go under graphs
06:48 - currently all shader is created with
06:50 - shaded graphs go under here but I here
06:53 - the team is currently working to fix
06:54 - that and we can then select all monkey
06:56 - shader and we can see just how cool that
06:58 - looks in the editor however it's
07:00 - something that would be really need is
07:02 - the ability to change the color of our
07:04 - Fornell from inside the material because
07:07 - currently we have to double click on our
07:09 - shader open an urban shader graph find
07:11 - the correct node and make the change in
07:13 - here and that's not very intuitive and
07:16 - also it means that the color will be the
07:17 - same for all of our materials instead we
07:20 - can right click on this color and we can
07:22 - convert it to a property this makes it
07:25 - so that we can no longer edit the node
07:27 - in here but instead it shows up in the
07:29 - top left corner this is what we refer to
07:31 - as the blackboard and here we can see
07:33 - all the properties that our shader has
07:35 - in our case we just created a color and
07:38 - if we expand this we can now see that we
07:40 - can change both the color and mode up
07:42 - here instead we can also right click on
07:44 - it to rename it
07:45 - now I'm gonna rename it to for nail
07:47 - color as a result of this if we save
07:50 - this asset and select the material we
07:53 - now change the for another color in here
07:54 - awesome
07:56 - let's see what else we could do to make
07:57 - this more interesting first of all we
07:59 - can change the preview down here so that
08:01 - we can see it on our monkey head to do
08:03 - that that's right click and choose
08:04 - custom mesh and we can then select the
08:07 - monkey head that makes everything a bit
08:09 - clearer to see we could then try
08:11 - animating our Fornell effect over time
08:13 - to do this that select all of our nodes
08:16 - and move them up a bit let's then create
08:18 - a new node this time I'm gonna search
08:20 - for time that's it enter and here we
08:22 - have all kinds of different outputs for
08:24 - time let's then create a multiply node
08:26 - so space multiply I'm gonna delete the
08:29 - old connection here and go from our old
08:32 - multiply node to our new one and from
08:34 - our time node I'm gonna take the sign of
08:36 - time and drag that into this second
08:39 - multiply input and we see now this cool
08:41 - animation that occurs of course this
08:43 - sign of time goes between minus 1 and 1
08:46 - and we really only wanted to go between
08:49 - 0 and 1 so we can actually remove this
08:52 - here and instead put a note in between
08:54 - so we'll go from sign of time into and
08:57 - we'll then create a remap node and we
09:00 - wanted to go to the input so it's going
09:02 - from the sign of time to the input of
09:04 - our remap node our input goes between
09:07 - minus 1 and 1 and our output goes
09:09 - between 0 and 1 so now you can see that
09:11 - the animation looks much nicer let's
09:13 - then take the output of a remap node and
09:15 - drag it into the second input of our
09:18 - multiply and finally let's take the
09:20 - output of our multiply node and drag it
09:23 - back into remission and there we go
09:25 - we've now created an animated material I
09:27 - don't want this effect to completely
09:29 - disappear at any point so I'm gonna make
09:30 - it go between point 2 and 1 instead of 0
09:33 - and 1 I think that looks a bit better so
09:37 - we've now created a pulsating highlight
09:39 - let's just clean up our notes here by
09:41 - moving them up a bit
09:43 - let's save the asset close down shader
09:45 - graph and hit play we can see that our
09:48 - monkey is indeed animating whoo-hoo now
09:51 - the final thing that I think is good to
09:53 - know when getting started with shader
09:55 - graph is how we can work with textures
09:57 - to do this let's start by creating a
09:59 - property in our blackboard here we have
10:01 - some different ones to choose from we're
10:02 - going to select texture and let's just
10:04 - create an occlusion texture for our
10:06 - models so let's call this occlusion and
10:09 - as the default input here I'm gonna
10:11 - select a monkey occlusion texture that I
10:13 - have prepared we then take our property
10:15 - and drag it in here and at this point it
10:18 - would be pretty intuitive to simply go
10:20 - from the occlusion property into the
10:22 - occlusion input on our PBR master but as
10:25 - you can see it really doesn't accept
10:27 - this the reason why is that they're
10:29 - currently 2 different types as you can
10:30 - see on a PPR master after occlusion
10:33 - there is a one in parentheses that's
10:35 - because the occlusion is a single
10:37 - channel value whereas our property is
10:39 - parentheses t that's because the type of
10:42 - a property is a texture so to convert
10:45 - between these we take the output of our
10:47 - property we input it into a sample
10:49 - texture node and we then go from this
10:52 - sampler texture node into the occlusion
10:54 - input and now it should work just fine
10:56 - if we save this asset and select our
10:59 - monkey material we now have an empty
11:00 - texture slot here we can then input our
11:03 - monkey occlusion and as you can see if
11:05 - we toggle
11:06 - between the two it clearly adds some
11:08 - nice ambient occlusion to our model
11:10 - that's how you can apply texture notes
11:12 - in shader graph and that should be
11:14 - enough to get you started from here on
11:16 - it's just about playing around with it
11:17 - trying to recreate different effects and
11:19 - figuring out what the different notes do
11:21 - and most importantly make sure to have
11:23 - fun so that's pretty much it for this
11:25 - video
11:25 - however shader graph is a huge tool and
11:28 - there's so much more exciting stuff to
11:30 - cover if you'd like to see more videos
11:31 - on shader graph or on how to create cool
11:34 - effects like Holograms or dissolving
11:36 - effects definitely let me know in the
11:38 - comments I'm really fond of the tools so
11:40 - far but there's still a lot of stuff
11:41 - that I would like to see added like
11:43 - vertex displacement and access to the
11:45 - camera depth buffer but the tool is not
11:47 - even out of preview yet so I guess we'll
11:49 - just have to be patient
11:50 - also don't forget to check out both you
11:52 - can use the link in the description to
11:54 - get started on that thanks watching and
