00:00 - thanks for tuning in at
00:02 - braies hello everyone and welcome to
00:04 - this video on creating a t defense game
00:06 - in unity today we're going to be adding
00:08 - some functionality for selling turrets
00:10 - two videos ago we U made some
00:12 - functionality for selecting turrets on
00:14 - the map and a node UI would put up uh
00:17 - pop up with two different buttons one
00:19 - for upgrading the turret and one for
00:21 - selling it and in the last video we made
00:23 - all the functionality for upgrading the
00:25 - turet so in this one we are going to be
00:27 - making this stuff that will allow us to
00:29 - remove the card off our map and in
00:31 - return get some sum of money we'll also
00:34 - be uh adding the upgraded versions of
00:36 - the missile launcher and the laser
00:38 - Beamer because in the last one we only
00:40 - set up an upgraded version of our
00:41 - standard turret so without further Ado
00:44 - let's just jump right into it so as you
00:46 - can see I'm here in unity and what I
00:47 - want to begin with is just adding these
00:49 - upgraded versions so we can totally
00:51 - close off our upgrade system you can see
00:54 - currently if we hit play here and uh
00:56 - create a standard turret we can easily
00:59 - upgrade that
01:00 - but if we do the same with our missile
01:02 - launcher it says that the upgrade price
01:04 - is zero and it's just going to disappear
01:06 - off the map with a null reference
01:08 - exception because we haven't referenced
01:10 - an upgraded object so let's go into our
01:12 - prefabs folder here let's find our
01:14 - missile launcher and let's hit contrl D
01:16 - to duplicate that and let's call this
01:18 - one missile launcher
01:20 - upgraded upgraded and let's uh drag this
01:24 - into our map and we can just kind of
01:26 - style this differently and give it some
01:28 - different properties over here so the
01:29 - the first thing that I want to do is
01:31 - bump up the scale to 1.2 on all the axes
01:34 - and then I want to uh up the range to
01:37 - something like 40 the fire rate to
01:40 - something
01:41 - like4 and um everything else we're just
01:44 - going to leave as this you can also
01:45 - include a new missile if you wanted to
01:47 - fire something that looks a bit
01:49 - different you might want to make it
01:50 - bigger or totally red or uh do something
01:53 - like that but I think we're just going
01:54 - to keep this as uh as is for now and the
01:58 - next thing that I wanted to do with this
02:01 - is uh change the materials uh a tiny bit
02:03 - to just kind of recolor it and make it
02:06 - really clear that it's now a new
02:08 - separate thing so in order to do this I
02:11 - actually don't want to change any of the
02:12 - materials I just want to flip this
02:15 - material here for the tip and on this
02:17 - material here for the head so you can
02:20 - see over here we have a primary and a
02:21 - secondary material and then they are
02:23 - currently under Imports and then missile
02:25 - launcher and materials and you can see I
02:28 - played around with having an upgraded
02:29 - folder here we're just going to delete
02:31 - that and basically I just want to drag
02:34 - our primary into the first slot instead
02:36 - of the second one and our secondary into
02:39 - the second slot instead of the first one
02:41 - and let is just uh switch the two and
02:43 - it's maybe it's maybe kind of a hack but
02:46 - I think it looks fairly decent
02:48 - especially if we zoom out a little it
02:50 - makes it really really clear that
02:52 - something else is going on with this
02:53 - turret so let's just hit apply on that
02:56 - and remove this and now we can go into
02:58 - our uh shop which is under overlay
03:01 - canvas and then shop and in here we have
03:04 - the uh shop script which has a missile
03:07 - launcher and all the data for that and
03:09 - here we need to reference our new prefab
03:11 - that we just made the missile launcher
03:13 - upgraded along with adding a cost and
03:15 - that's going to be something like 150
03:17 - you could easily automate the cost to
03:19 - but just be a percentage of the original
03:22 - cost um but I like to have more control
03:25 - so now we can go in here hit play select
03:28 - the missile launcher build it and we can
03:30 - now easily upgrade it as well and that
03:32 - just
03:33 - works awesome uh and I basically just
03:36 - want to do the same thing for the
03:37 - missile launcher so let's take our
03:39 - missile launch or uh the laser Beamer so
03:42 - let's duplicate our laser Beamer and
03:44 - let's do underscore upgraded once again
03:47 - let's move this into our scene so we can
03:49 - easily see our edits and uh let's change
03:52 - the range here something like 30 and
03:55 - let's also change the damage over time
03:58 - to say 40 and this slow amount to
04:00 - something like8 I want this to be really
04:03 - notice uh noticeably uh better then we
04:06 - can hit apply on that and I also kind of
04:10 - want to bump up the size of this laser
04:13 - here so let's just change the start
04:14 - width from3 to4 and do the same on the
04:18 - end width just to make that a tiny bit
04:20 - bigger and um also we can make the turet
04:24 - itself bigger so let's do a scale of
04:25 - Point 1.2 again on all the axes and and
04:29 - we can also go under the impact effect
04:32 - and just edit this a tiny bit so if you
04:33 - focus on it you can see what that looks
04:35 - like and it's a really nice effect we
04:37 - can go under glow and change the start
04:39 - size to be between three and four
04:41 - instead of two and three and just bump
04:44 - up the range on the light to something
04:45 - like 15 instead of
04:47 - 10 cool uh that's pretty much all we
04:51 - need to edit for this I believe so we
04:53 - can just hit apply now and again remove
04:55 - it off the map and then we can find our
04:58 - shop and reference it so so in here
05:00 - under our laser Beamer we want the
05:02 - upgrade cost to be somewhere around 200
05:05 - maybe even
05:06 - 250 actually I think I'm going to go for
05:09 - 250 and let's take our upgraded prefab
05:12 - the laser beam upgraded here and put it
05:14 - in there so now when we H play we should
05:16 - be able able to upgrade this as well so
05:19 - let's uh spawn in a laser Beamer and hit
05:23 - upgrade and you can see that indeed that
05:25 - works just fine however I want to
05:27 - recolor this a tiny bit so let just take
05:30 - our upgraded here have a look at it and
05:33 - instead of again modifying the original
05:35 - materials uh this time I want to
05:38 - basically just find our laser
05:40 - Beamer um is this
05:43 - floating this is for some reason
05:45 - floating so I think the fact that we
05:47 - scaled this up made it float a tiny bit
05:50 - uh so what we'll do is just uh take
05:54 - these elements here the base and the
05:56 - part to rotate and I think we'll just
05:58 - move those down a bit something like
06:01 - that just to make sure that it will uh
06:03 - stay on the Node even though we've sized
06:06 - it up so now we can go on our Imports
06:08 - and then you can see I've already
06:09 - created a m a folder for this earlier
06:11 - but let's just delete that let's
06:13 - duplicate the entire materials folder
06:15 - and let's call this one materials
06:18 - upgraded and now we can go ahead and
06:21 - Swap all of these out so let's go under
06:23 - the um base first and we change the
06:26 - bolts here and the B Bas to the new base
06:31 - then we can take our head and change the
06:35 - pipe the main
06:38 - turret and the turret
06:40 - accent there we go and currently we
06:42 - can't notice a difference but now we can
06:44 - go in and actually change these
06:46 - materials and it will only affect this
06:47 - version and pretty much all I want to do
06:49 - is take the pipe here and make this
06:51 - green and I want them to be a very
06:54 - bright saturated green something like
06:56 - that and I also want to kind of go in
06:59 - and change the bolts here to be green as
07:02 - well I think that could be a pretty cool
07:04 - little detail something like that and I
07:07 - might want to change the accent even so
07:10 - let's find our third accent and let's
07:12 - just try this in green as
07:15 - well I actually really like that it's
07:18 - it's more simple but it's very
07:21 - noticeable noticeably different so let's
07:24 - hit apply and let's remove this and
07:26 - remember you don't have to just change
07:28 - the materials or just change change the
07:29 - properties you can change anything about
07:31 - the turret you can change the uh bullet
07:34 - the prefab that spawned anything about
07:36 - the effects and you can even make a
07:37 - totally new model with different
07:39 - animation and put that in there instead
07:42 - because we're just hot swapping out a
07:44 - game object so now let's just try this
07:47 - one last time and see that all of our
07:49 - turrets are working so let's do one of
07:51 - each and let's just try and upgrade them
07:54 - that looks nice okay so they all look
07:57 - really awesome in their new upgraded
07:59 - version
08:01 - cool so next up is the selling part so
08:05 - what do we want to do here well so far
08:08 - on each node uh on each node we have a
08:12 - node script and inside of this script we
08:15 - have functionality for um for um we have
08:19 - call backs that register when our Mouse
08:22 - is hovering over it we have uh callbacks
08:24 - that register when um let me just close
08:28 - down all of this stuff
08:30 - um uh when we click on it and we have
08:32 - different stuff that happens when we do
08:34 - so we have something called build turret
08:37 - um a method that builds a new turret we
08:39 - have another one that upgrades the
08:40 - current turret and in line with these
08:42 - functions let let's add a new one called
08:45 - uh cell
08:47 - tart and what we want to do in here is
08:50 - of course destroy the current tet add on
08:53 - some amount of money and maybe also some
08:56 - kind of effect so let's start by adding
08:59 - on some some money so let's go into
09:00 - player stats and let's do money and
09:04 - let's add onto this um
09:07 - some amount of the cost so I think here
09:10 - we're just going to automate it you can
09:12 - go in and put a um sell amount for each
09:16 - individual turret but I think for now
09:18 - we'll just take half of the uh purchase
09:21 - price so we're going to ignore upgrades
09:24 - and we're going to ignore everything
09:25 - else about the uh turret the amount that
09:27 - it sell sells for is just going to be
09:30 - half what we originally bought it for so
09:33 - what and that is of course stored inside
09:35 - of our T blueprint so this is our
09:37 - current turret and we can just do turet
09:39 - blueprint. cost and then multiply that
09:42 - with say 0.5 but we might want to get
09:46 - the cost or the amount that we can sell
09:48 - something for multiple places and we
09:51 - don't want this 0.5 to be hi coded
09:54 - because then we would have to go through
09:56 - and remember where we wrote this code
09:58 - and change it in each place so what
10:01 - we'll do instead is add a small helper
10:03 - function to our T blueprint that Returns
10:06 - the um sell amount what the how much
10:09 - money the uh turd can be sold for so
10:12 - let's find our turd blueprint here and
10:14 - open it up and in here we're just going
10:16 - to add a uh quick little function this
10:19 - is going to be a public and it's not
10:21 - going to be void because we want to
10:22 - return something we want to return an
10:24 - integer um with the amount and this is
10:27 - going to be something like get sell
10:29 - amount
10:29 - ount and all we do is take our cost and
10:33 - uh and return our cost multiply with our
10:37 - some value and let's just take half of
10:38 - it so in our case we can just divide by
10:42 - two so that's pretty much all we need to
10:45 - do we just cut our cost in half in half
10:47 - and this way we can easily just in here
10:49 - change how we calculate this and it's
10:52 - going to update in all places where we
10:54 - simply go tur blueprint. getet cost
10:58 - whoops uh get cell
11:00 - amount there we go awesome so what we
11:03 - can then do is of course destroy the
11:05 - turret so we have a reference to it as
11:07 - the turret here we're just going to
11:10 - destroy that we're also going to set our
11:12 - turret blueprint uh equal to
11:15 - null um
11:18 - and that is pretty much it and then we
11:20 - can uh spawn a cool
11:23 - effect but we can take care of that in a
11:25 - second let's just figure out if this is
11:27 - working so this function should indeed
11:29 - work now but we of course to need to
11:31 - call it somewhere as well and we need to
11:34 - call it in the same place that we are
11:35 - calling our upgrade turret and that is
11:38 - through our node UI so our node UI here
11:41 - is what pops up whenever we select a
11:43 - turd it has this canvas with the
11:45 - different UI elements for uh upgrading
11:48 - and selling so what we do is edit this
11:50 - node
11:51 - UI and in here we just want to add on a
11:55 - new uh method just like we have the
11:57 - public void upgrade we also want call
11:59 - called cell and we just go target. cell
12:02 - turret and the target is what we are
12:05 - currently uh we currently have selected
12:08 - and then we go build manager. instance.
12:11 - deselect node because after selling the
12:13 - turret we want to deselect any kind of
12:16 - nodes that we might have selected just
12:18 - the same way that we have built our
12:20 - upgrade me uh method it's the exact same
12:23 - thing except instead of calling upgrade
12:25 - turret we're calling sell turret so now
12:28 - we just need toook this up to our button
12:30 - and we do that by going through our
12:32 - canvas finding the button under buttons
12:35 - the cell button here and adding a new
12:37 - onclick event that references our node
12:39 - UI where our script is and calls on that
12:42 - script calls the cell function that we
12:44 - just created so now everything should be
12:47 - nicely hooked up and that there that
12:50 - right there is the strength of the way
12:52 - that we've built this system because
12:54 - we've built it in such a clear way where
12:56 - our UI elements all reference this
12:59 - Central UI script that is then able to
13:02 - um or that then keeps track of what we
13:05 - currently have selected and is able to
13:07 - call methods on that node because we are
13:10 - using this very modular way of building
13:12 - it it's so easy to add new functionality
13:15 - to modify nodes in different ways so now
13:17 - we can hit uh play here and hopefully uh
13:21 - we should be able to now uh build any
13:24 - kind of turret and sell it and indeed we
13:27 - are and you can see here that I spend
13:29 - 350 I click here and I sell and right
13:33 - now it says sell 450 that's not true
13:35 - it's going to sell for 350 divided by 2
13:38 - and you can see indeed it does that so
13:41 - all we need to do now is just update
13:44 - that amount so we're not updating uh the
13:47 - cell cost here and that's going to be
13:49 - the cell amount here we're not updating
13:52 - this UI element you can see all we need
13:54 - to do is go in here and modify this to
13:56 - say something like 125
13:59 - in case we are selling the missile
14:00 - launcher or whatever so what we do in
14:04 - order to get that working is just
14:06 - reference it inside of our node UI and
14:08 - update it when we set a new Target the
14:11 - exact same way that we do with our
14:12 - upgrade cost so we just create a public
14:15 - text here and this is going to be the
14:17 - sell
14:18 - amount and we'll reference that in the
14:20 - inspector and then down here we go sell
14:23 - amount. text equals and we'll put a
14:26 - dollar sign here just for fanciness and
14:29 - plus target. tet turret blueprint Dot
14:34 - and remember to use the method here so
14:36 - we'll use get cell amount and this is
14:39 - where our uh Little Helper method here
14:42 - comes in handy because now we've already
14:44 - implemented the cell amount in two
14:46 - different places and so we would already
14:48 - have two different places that we would
14:50 - have to update our code instead of just
14:53 - this Central
14:55 - one cool so that should indeed update
14:58 - that and everything should be working so
15:00 - let's try this out so let's find our
15:02 - node UI script let's drag our amount
15:06 - here the text object right into that
15:08 - field let's hit play and now let's build
15:12 - one of each turret and let's select them
15:14 - so this one here sells for 175 this for
15:18 - 125 and this for 50 and we can sell them
15:21 - for those appropriate
15:24 - amounts you can see how money went back
15:27 - up awesome so the last thing that I
15:30 - wanted to do was just create some kind
15:32 - of sell um not animation I wanted to
15:34 - create some kind of cell effect so in
15:37 - order to do this let's use an effect
15:39 - that we uh already have and uh let's
15:44 - create the effect and then implement it
15:45 - in code or the other way around let's do
15:47 - the coding uh thing first so uh in order
15:50 - to do this all we need to do is um find
15:53 - the place in our node where we set the
15:55 - tart and you can see we've already made
15:57 - a comment here so we want to do the
16:00 - exact same thing as when we're
16:02 - instantiating uh an effect up here when
16:04 - building it so let's just duplicate that
16:06 - code and all we're doing is
16:08 - instantiating build manager Dot and then
16:11 - instead of build effect we want to have
16:13 - a new uh reference called a cell effect
16:16 - and we'll create that in a second and we
16:18 - get the build position which is also the
16:20 - cell position which is the central point
16:22 - for our turret we have a cian do
16:26 - identity uh which is just um a rot of
16:29 - none and then we destroy that effect
16:32 - after 5 seconds so uh let's now go and
16:36 - that's basically all we need to do here
16:38 - so let's just go into our build manager
16:40 - and we'll find that in our scripts
16:42 - folder here the build manager and let's
16:45 - add just another public game object here
16:48 - so public game object and this is going
16:49 - to be our cell effect cool so that was
16:54 - all we needed to do in code so now we
16:56 - can just uh build this inside a Unity so
16:58 - let's go to prefabs and let's base this
17:01 - around our build effect and let's rename
17:03 - this one to cell effect and create a new
17:06 - prefab out of it and uh let's have a
17:10 - look at our particles here so these
17:12 - particles are let's turn on looping here
17:14 - and let's simulate these particles are
17:17 - floating upwards and since it's kind of
17:19 - a semi-positive thing that is happening
17:22 - it is something kind of intangible uh
17:24 - the fact that you are getting coins um
17:27 - let's have the same effect but now let's
17:29 - color it differently so it's clearly uh
17:32 - coins or some kind of money or gold that
17:34 - is floating upwards so let's create a
17:36 - new material for this and let's instead
17:38 - of uh let's just actually duplicate the
17:41 - build effect let's call this one the
17:43 - cell
17:45 - effect and inside of our particles we
17:47 - then want to reference that cell effect
17:49 - so under the renderer drag in the cell
17:52 - effect under the material field and we
17:55 - can now uh select this material and we
17:58 - can
18:00 - make it kind of orange yellowish we want
18:04 - no
18:05 - metallic um we want to kind of bump up
18:08 - the smoothness and I actually want to
18:10 - saturate this
18:12 - more something something like that looks
18:15 - pretty nice that's just no metallic
18:17 - that's not good and let's also uh give
18:19 - it a tiny bit of emission because when
18:21 - we give it some emission it's going to
18:23 - have this very nice glowy feel and it's
18:27 - not actually going to illuminate the map
18:29 - it's just going to give us this nice uh
18:32 - color on the material and it's give it
18:35 - an emission of say Point uh three so
18:38 - let's see what that looks like I think
18:39 - that's a pretty nice combination between
18:42 - reacting to the LI in our scene and
18:44 - actually emitting shadows as well and
18:46 - then still having that glowy uh glowy
18:50 - feel I kind of also want to add some
18:53 - particle effect that are uh is thrown to
18:56 - the ground because our uh turret is
18:58 - currently just dematerializing and just
19:01 - disappearing in an instant let's create
19:03 - the um illusion that some parts of the
19:06 - turrets are that it's being split up
19:08 - into parts and falling down so in order
19:11 - to do that uh let's use another effect
19:13 - that we already have lying around and we
19:16 - could maybe use um the bullet would be a
19:19 - pretty good one we could also use one
19:21 - for destroying enemies so we have the
19:23 - enemy death effect here and I think this
19:26 - can very easily be modified to suit our
19:30 - needs so of course we don't want this to
19:32 - be a prefer uh a prefab right now and so
19:36 - I believe that we could just hit revert
19:38 - here
19:39 - nope um how is it that we disconnect
19:42 - this from being a prefab I actually
19:45 - never really do this so it's kind of you
19:49 - know what we'll do we'll just trick this
19:51 - so delete that and then we can go in
19:54 - here and we can create a new object and
19:57 - we can just paste that component in
19:59 - there and it won't have an effect on the
20:00 - prefab there we go so let's reset the
20:03 - Transformer on that and uh this one is
20:05 - going to be um kind of the
20:09 - debris and uh let's simulate this that
20:12 - already looks pretty good let's put on
20:13 - looping here so we can see what's going
20:15 - on and of course we want this to have a
20:17 - different material as well because this
20:19 - one is made for our enemies and that is
20:22 - pretty clear and let's actually maybe
20:24 - also bump down the emission a tiny bit
20:26 - to be between 10 and 15 I think that's
20:29 - enough actually no let's just go full
20:31 - particle overboard so this is the debris
20:34 - and uh let's find a material that
20:36 - matches here so we could actually just
20:39 - go ahead and use one of the materials uh
20:41 - that we use on our turrets and then in
20:43 - fact I think we should just do that so
20:45 - let's go under Imports onto the standard
20:47 - tart let's find our materials here and
20:50 - let's find our main color this gray
20:54 - tinted a tiny bit blue color and let's
20:58 - drag that in there and see how that
21:00 - looks so I think that looks pretty good
21:02 - it definitely gives the impression that
21:05 - there's some kind of debris lying around
21:08 - so now let's try and hit um let's select
21:11 - these particle systems and turn off
21:13 - looping that's a pretty important
21:15 - part let's try and hit play uh let's try
21:18 - and hit apply and let's now delete this
21:21 - prefab and uh let's also reference it so
21:24 - inside of our game master is where our
21:26 - build manager sits and now we just need
21:29 - to drag in our new cell effect cell
21:31 - effect into the empty slot and yeah
21:35 - let's try and hit
21:36 - play and let's try and sell
21:39 - something so I actually really like the
21:42 - effect we have going on here it's it's
21:44 - really subtle um but it's just there's
21:47 - something there and it feels nice I do
21:50 - think however that I want to modify it a
21:52 - tiny bit more before we close up here so
21:54 - let's find our sell effect here the
21:56 - debris um I'm not fully satisfied with
21:59 - this I want to move it up a bit first of
22:01 - all that's okay and then we can take uh
22:04 - and edit the shape here a tiny bit I
22:07 - want to um maybe do this in a hemisphere
22:10 - shape and I want to rotate this um by
22:14 - 90 so it kind of shoots upwards a little
22:17 - bit and I maybe also want to add a tiny
22:20 - bit of speed so something like between
22:22 - one and
22:23 - five that's a bit better just to give it
22:26 - a bit of bounciness
22:29 - like that that's a bit better and then
22:31 - let's also modify the material for this
22:33 - so um let's create a separate one
22:36 - changed my mind so let's create a
22:37 - separate one create material and this is
22:40 - going to be our cell effect and this is
22:43 - going to be the debris and this is going
22:45 - to be our cell effect
22:47 - um uh which is going to be our gold so
22:51 - this is going to be our gold there we go
22:53 - let's take our debris and drag it into
22:55 - the render Rod to replace here there we
22:58 - go and let's simulate and pause so we
23:02 - can see what's going on here and let's
23:04 - adjust this so um a bit of metallic
23:07 - maybe down with the smoothness and then
23:09 - we're going to need some blue
23:11 - tinted um kind of grayish color
23:15 - something like that is pretty nice I
23:16 - think the other one was simply too black
23:18 - so let's try and hit apply on that hit
23:21 - play see what this feels like so let's
23:24 - try and sell that and I actually really
23:26 - like this effect now that's perfect it
23:29 - might even be a tiny bit uh too bright
23:33 - so let's just try and do that and now I
23:36 - won't fiddle with this anymore uh I
23:38 - guess it makes for a bad video if I just
23:40 - sit here adjusting settings so we'll
23:42 - take our game over script and our node
23:44 - UI and drag that under the scripts and
23:46 - we'll have one last view of uh what this
23:49 - effect looks like and uh yeah I hope you
23:51 - enjoyed this video I definitely think
23:53 - that uh these features the UI here some
23:56 - selling and some upgrading are are very
23:59 - Central to almost any um tower defense
24:01 - game so it feels nice to have them in
24:03 - here and um if you have any other
24:05 - suggestions as to what I might cover
24:07 - definitely leave them in the um
24:10 - description or in the comment section
24:12 - down below uh because this was pretty
24:14 - much all of the really Central stuff
24:16 - that I wanted to cover so yeah let me
24:19 - know what you guys want to see and
24:20 - without further Ado I will see you in
24:22 - the next video thanks to all the awesome
24:24 - patreon supporters who donated in
24:26 - October and a special thanks to Sultan
24:28 - elative face of the marifi and James
