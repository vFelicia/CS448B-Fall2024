00:00 - [Music]
00:03 - hello everyone and welcome to this video
00:04 - on volumetric lights in unity today
00:07 - we're going to be taking this scene and
00:09 - turning it into this and before we get
00:11 - started if you guys haven't watched my
00:13 - latest video I just launched a new
00:16 - website it's called Dev assets it's a
00:17 - place you can go to download high
00:19 - quality asset packs it's pay what you
00:21 - want and I think it's pretty awesome so
00:23 - go to Dev assets.com if you want to
00:25 - check it out and let's just jump right
00:27 - into today's video so here's the scene
00:28 - we're going to be working with today
00:29 - today some of you might recognize it
00:31 - because it's the same one I used in the
00:33 - dev assets video to Showcase some of
00:35 - these cool looking sci-fi Vehicles we of
00:37 - course going to be adding some
00:38 - volumetric lights to the scene but I
00:40 - also want to show you kind of how I put
00:42 - this whole thing together because a lot
00:44 - of you guys were curious in the comments
00:46 - and so I thought I would give you a
00:47 - quick rundown of what we have in here
00:49 - but first let's talk about what
00:51 - volumetric lights really are so here's
00:53 - an example of volumetric Lights working
00:55 - inside an engine this photo is from
00:56 - killstone which runs on the DECA engine
00:59 - and um it's a really good example
01:01 - because not only do we see the effects
01:03 - of the light on the surface and a bit of
01:06 - Bloom we also see very clearly these
01:09 - arays coming from the light and how
01:11 - these are affected by a bit of noise
01:14 - giving the impression that we have some
01:16 - dust and particles Flo floating in the
01:18 - air that the light is hitting and then
01:20 - reflecting off of and therefore we are
01:22 - able to see the light um scattering
01:25 - through the air so that's what we're
01:26 - going to be making inside of unity
01:28 - however Unity doesn't have this feature
01:30 - buil in so we have to look to third
01:33 - party Alternatives and I searched around
01:35 - a bit and I found something that I
01:37 - thought was really really cool so here's
01:39 - volumetric lights for Unity it's an open
01:41 - source project created by a guy called
01:43 - Michael and it uses the same technique
01:45 - that killone does for calculating these
01:47 - lighting effects it currently supports
01:50 - both Point lights spot lights and
01:52 - directional lights so it really has all
01:54 - the features that you're going to need
01:56 - in most pretty much all your projects
01:59 - and the cool thing about it is again
02:01 - it's open source and freely available so
02:02 - you can see here there will be a link to
02:04 - the GitHub page in the description where
02:06 - you can of course clone or download the
02:08 - project but it's set up as a Unity
02:10 - project so I thought I would go ahead
02:11 - and compile a Unity package and I've
02:15 - done this so if you just go in the
02:16 - description there will be a link for
02:18 - that as well when you open that up you
02:19 - get a folder called volumetric lights
02:22 - which inside it has a volumetric lights
02:25 - Unity package and this allows us to just
02:27 - double click this it's going to prepare
02:29 - the pack package and you can see I
02:31 - already have some of the stuff in the
02:32 - project but not the volumetric lights
02:34 - folder we can just hit import and it's
02:36 - going to set everything up for you so
02:38 - that's really easy and the warnings down
02:41 - here are not generated by the volumetric
02:43 - lights um U package they are generated
02:46 - by some other stuff I have in the
02:48 - project already because yeah it's a bit
02:50 - messy in here but just ignore those you
02:53 - should not get any uh warnings when
02:55 - doing it so now we have a volumetric
02:57 - lights folder in our project and if we
02:59 - open that up there are a bunch of
03:00 - example scenes that I definitely
03:02 - recommend you check out if you want to
03:04 - know how you can set some of this up for
03:05 - your own project more specifically you
03:07 - should check out some of the sun labeled
03:09 - ones because they show how to set up
03:11 - directional lights to work with fog and
03:14 - hazes and stuff like that all right so
03:17 - let's get started by having a look at
03:18 - what's currently in our scene of course
03:20 - we have this main light which is our sun
03:22 - a directional light with a fairly high
03:24 - intensity which has a kind of reddish
03:26 - tint and you can see just how important
03:29 - this light is if I disable it and
03:32 - reenable it we also have an accent light
03:35 - a blue light shining from the opposite
03:36 - direction you can see it hitting the car
03:39 - right here it has a much lower intensity
03:41 - and is tinted in a blue color to really
03:44 - help bring some depth into the scene you
03:46 - can see if I disable this now that
03:49 - everything looks very Bland and green so
03:52 - that's a really important thing to have
03:54 - I've also turned up the ambient uh
03:56 - intensity of our ambient light quite a
03:59 - bit so that our Skybox will illuminate
04:01 - the scene from all angles you can see
04:03 - I've turned it up to
04:05 - 1.66 the reason why is I looked at some
04:07 - reference photos from Mars and saw that
04:09 - the light was getting bounced around a
04:11 - lot we had these really bright
04:13 - illuminated scenes so I thought I would
04:15 - replicate that by just bumping up the
04:17 - ambient light awesome so other than that
04:20 - in here we of course have a Terrain
04:22 - that's just a Unity terrain which I can
04:25 - enable and disable we have a few rocks
04:27 - that I've just scattered around any Rock
04:28 - pack will do and we also have a dust
04:30 - storm and this is actually just taken
04:32 - from the standard assets I simply
04:34 - tweaked it by changing the size around a
04:36 - bit to make it look a bit better but
04:38 - that's really it and that gives this
04:41 - scene one thing that does make this
04:42 - scene look a lot better is all of the
04:44 - image effects that I have applied and if
04:47 - we go have a look at my main camera here
04:49 - you can see just what those are so first
04:51 - of all we have a global fog which just
04:54 - helps blur out the background a bit and
04:55 - adds in this bright color here I also
04:59 - have a depth of field with which is of
05:01 - course blowing the background and the
05:03 - foreground and leaving only the middle
05:05 - part here this the uh vehicle in the
05:07 - center in Focus we also have the color
05:10 - correction curves here and I do a lot of
05:13 - heavy color correction on this image you
05:14 - can see if I disable that just how much
05:17 - of a difference that makes I really
05:19 - bring out the Reds and yellows and try
05:22 - and suppress some of the greens and you
05:24 - can see I have some blue in there but
05:26 - it's not overwhelming so that's really
05:29 - helps a lot with um bringing this marsik
05:32 - feel into the scene and not just having
05:35 - it look like a desert environment or uh
05:39 - yeah you definitely don't want a lot of
05:40 - green on Mars then we also have a bloom
05:43 - which just helps blur out some of the
05:45 - highlights in the scene and we have some
05:47 - viget and chromatic operation but that's
05:50 - very very uh solid you can see if I
05:52 - disable that it's just a very very
05:54 - subtle vet we have going on here and a
05:58 - bit of chromatic operation as well just
06:00 - at 05 finally the most important part of
06:02 - the scene is of course the Sci-Fi
06:04 - Vehicles themselves you can see them
06:06 - here we have our main vehicle here in
06:08 - front and then we have two supporting
06:10 - Vehicles back here and they are part of
06:12 - the Sci-Fi Vehicles pack if you want to
06:15 - get them for yourself you can just go
06:16 - and open your browser type in Dev
06:18 - assets.com there will also be a link for
06:20 - that in the description go to sci-fi
06:22 - Vehicles choose a price that works for
06:24 - you if you are totally unable to pay we
06:26 - even have a free option because we
06:28 - understand what that's like and then you
06:31 - just hit pay what you want it's going to
06:32 - download as a zip file with a Unity
06:35 - package and everything is going to be
06:37 - set up for you so you can just drag in
06:38 - the vehicles and you're good to go so
06:41 - that's pretty much all for our scene
06:43 - let's start looking at some lights to
06:45 - get started let's go ahead and find our
06:47 - vehicle in front here or whatever you
06:49 - want to apply lights to and let's right
06:52 - click and go light and then select
06:55 - Spotlight because I want a light shining
06:57 - in a particular direction with a an
07:00 - angle and a range which really works for
07:03 - these kind of lights so let's just move
07:06 - this up a bit and position it on the top
07:09 - light here and we'll do that one first
07:11 - we'll do the two other ones as well but
07:14 - I thought we would make this one the um
07:17 - brightest one and so we'll do that one
07:19 - first let's also rotate this one on the
07:22 - xais and make sure you're in local when
07:24 - doing some rotation it just makes it
07:26 - easier and uh I'll just rotate it about
07:30 - 90Â° doesn't have to be totally um uh
07:34 - precise and let's go ahead and bump up
07:36 - the range here to something like 20 and
07:38 - that just means that it will shine
07:40 - further and brighter and we'll also bump
07:42 - up the spot angle I think the angle that
07:44 - Unity uses by default is very very
07:46 - narrow and you won't see this on a lot
07:49 - of lights what you see instead is a
07:51 - fairly broad spot angle where the light
07:54 - source actually hits pretty close I
07:56 - don't think this is totally unrealistic
07:58 - I want to see it hit the car and hit the
08:00 - ground a little bit as well and if we
08:02 - disable it you can see that's exactly
08:04 - what is happening so that's awesome
08:06 - let's go ahead and change the color of
08:08 - the light to a light blue just to give
08:11 - some contrast to our overall feel of the
08:13 - scene and for some reason our lighting
08:16 - just didn't uh bake correctly there but
08:18 - you can just enable and disable the
08:20 - light if that happens to you also want
08:22 - to bump up the intensity because we have
08:24 - so many intense lights in our scene we
08:25 - have to compete with this one so we'll
08:27 - just bump that up to three but that's
08:29 - going to depend totally on your scene
08:32 - I'm also going to put some heart shadows
08:34 - in here you can see what that does I
08:36 - wouldn't recommend using soft Shadows
08:38 - for a lot of Point lights that will
08:39 - quickly make your scene very very hard
08:42 - to run uh but having some hard Shadows
08:44 - on this light is not going to do
08:46 - anything at least not when we have this
08:48 - few things in our scene so now we've
08:50 - added our light and we ready to make it
08:52 - volumetric in order to do this we go hit
08:55 - add component we search for volumetric
08:58 - light and add this vol volumetric light
09:00 - script and you can see nothing is
09:02 - happening inside of our game or scene
09:04 - view that's because of two reasons
09:06 - primarily because this is not going to
09:08 - show unless we hit play and if I hit
09:12 - play it's still not going to show and
09:14 - the reason why is that we have to go and
09:16 - select our main camera hit add component
09:19 - and add the volumetric light renderer
09:22 - and this is what actually shows our
09:24 - light so now we need to go to the
09:27 - default spot cookie and we just need to
09:29 - input the spot which is part part of the
09:32 - volumetric lights pack so let's just
09:34 - double click that and now things should
09:37 - actually be working it might not be too
09:39 - clear but when we hit play we do
09:41 - actually have a bit of volumetric nness
09:44 - to this light but it's not really
09:47 - showing to make it more clear what we'll
09:49 - do is go and bump up the scattering
09:52 - coefficient and you can see once I do
09:55 - this it becomes very clear that our
09:59 - light is now shining we get these nice
10:01 - rays and this nice blooming effect it
10:04 - just looks a whole lot better but one
10:08 - thing that doesn't look too good about
10:10 - our light is how static it feels if we
10:13 - go ahead and disable our dust storm you
10:16 - can see that our light is indeed showing
10:19 - but it isn't really affected by any kind
10:22 - of dust or disturbance in the air or
10:26 - anything like that to make it feel more
10:29 - random random and lifelike we'll go and
10:31 - select the spotlight and will enable the
10:34 - noise and this is basically a way to add
10:37 - some Randomness to a light but right off
10:39 - the bat you can see just almost disables
10:41 - it that's because we have to bump up the
10:43 - noise intensity I think we can go for
10:46 - something like
10:47 - 4.5 yeah that looks a lot better but our
10:51 - noise is still not too visible and
10:53 - that's because our noise scale is too
10:55 - small if we go ahead and drag on our
10:57 - noise scale here and increase it we can
11:00 - actually see that the noise scams
11:03 - themselves become a lot smaller so you
11:06 - want definitely you definitely want a
11:08 - large noise scale but you don't want it
11:11 - too big because then it cannot be seen
11:13 - and you don't want it too small because
11:15 - then it's going to look like you've just
11:17 - overlaid a noise map and you're just
11:19 - scrolling through it and that looks
11:21 - super weird so I think something like
11:23 - .12
11:25 - SO2 looks pretty good for our case the
11:29 - fin thing that we need to edit a bit is
11:31 - the noise velocity and that is just the
11:33 - speed at which our noise will scroll
11:35 - through so if I edit this to say 20 on
11:37 - the X you can see just what that does I
11:40 - think we want the X to be around one so
11:43 - just a bit of movement there and then
11:45 - I'll y should be about -3 because our
11:48 - dust is moving towards or from the right
11:51 - side of our screen to the left side so I
11:53 - think that's going to look a lot better
11:55 - if it's in line with our dust storm so
11:58 - now make sure that you copy these
12:00 - settings on this um component so hit
12:03 - copy component and then we exit out of
12:06 - play mode make sure you do this before
12:08 - you exit play mode all your settings are
12:10 - going to be lost so now we exit play
12:13 - mode we right click and we hit paste
12:15 - component values to save all of our um
12:18 - configurations back in so now what we
12:20 - can do is maybe take this light here and
12:23 - we can rename it to our top
12:26 - light then we can duplicate it and we
12:29 - can add one to these down here as well
12:32 - so in our scene view we'll just go ahead
12:34 - and move this one down move it over a
12:37 - bit and move it forward and we'll just
12:40 - have to position it until we are happy
12:42 - with it something like that actually
12:44 - looks pretty good and we'll also
12:47 - probably want to tilt it downwards a bit
12:49 - because this lamp is pointing a bit down
12:51 - towards the ground something like that
12:53 - looks good and I definitely also want to
12:56 - edit the color so let's just go and take
12:58 - the color here and make it a bit more
13:00 - yellow orangish something like this and
13:03 - I don't want it to be too saturated so
13:05 - if we go in here and hit play now we
13:06 - should see that this is currently really
13:09 - really blown out I definitely want to
13:11 - bump the intensity down to say 1 maybe
13:13 - 1.5 at Max and I want to have the range
13:18 - decrease to something like 15 and we can
13:21 - maybe even decrease the spot angle but I
13:25 - actually think we should leave it as
13:27 - is and finally finally when we hit play
13:30 - we might also want to mess around with
13:32 - the coefficient a bit just to make it a
13:35 - tiny bit more clear to see or we could
13:38 - of course bump up the noise intensity
13:41 - but I think what we really want is maybe
13:44 - uh yeah to just bump up the scattering
13:46 - coefficient a tiny bit something like
13:49 - that just make it a bit clearer we'll
13:51 - copy the component again we'll exit out
13:53 - of play mode and we'll paste it back in
13:56 - and now we can just take this light
13:58 - rename it to something like front uh
14:01 - light and then we'll doore right
14:04 - duplicate it move it over and it should
14:08 - fit right uh away and we'll do front
14:12 - light left cool so that's pretty much
14:16 - all I wanted to show you so now when we
14:17 - hit play we should see all of the lights
14:20 - working nicely and it just adds a lot of
14:23 - depth to our scene it really makes
14:25 - everything pop it makes it feel more
14:27 - lifelike you can see what a difference
14:29 - this make if I go ahead and disable the
14:30 - lights it feels very static now and very
14:34 - 3D is and if I go in here and just move
14:38 - our camera a bit I've created this
14:39 - camera pivot where we can just rotate
14:41 - over our camera you can see how cool
14:44 - this looks when viewed from front as
14:46 - well and from the other side here so it
14:49 - just looks really really nice from all
14:52 - angles and what we can even do is maybe
14:54 - tilt our camera down so we look from
14:56 - underneath here and you can see just how
14:59 - cool of a dramatic effect this gives us
15:02 - I'm just going to show you something
15:04 - really cool about these vehicles and
15:05 - that's the fact that they are totally
15:07 - modular so if we have a look here this
15:10 - cabin here will rotate separately of the
15:12 - body we have all the wheels which will
15:15 - rotate separately as well so you can
15:17 - easily set it up with a vehicle
15:18 - controller inside of unity and we also
15:21 - have the turrets here which will also
15:23 - aim independently and uh finally some of
15:28 - these vehicles also have this top part
15:31 - here where you can put something like a
15:34 - turret or you can swap it out and simply
15:38 - use the radar that we have on the other
15:41 - vehicle here so you can really customize
15:43 - these to look the way you want them to
15:45 - and of course they are optimized for a
15:47 - PBR workflow so we have both an albo a
15:52 - specular normal map height map occlusion
15:54 - map anim Miss so all of the maps that
15:57 - you could desire are in here so again if
16:00 - you like it and you want to support it
16:02 - go to the dev asset website grab it and
16:05 - hopefully pay a bit if you able to and
16:08 - if not that's totally fine as well
16:09 - that's pretty much it for this video I
16:11 - hope you liked it remember there's a new
16:12 - video out every Sunday and wednessday
16:15 - thanks for watching this video and I
16:16 - will see you in the next one thanks to
