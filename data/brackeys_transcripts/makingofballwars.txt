00:00 - so the last student I read was in July
00:01 - and it looked super fun personally I was
00:04 - bummed to find out that I couldn't
00:05 - participate after a few days of moping I
00:09 - decided enough is enough and I would
00:11 - simply take some time to make a game of
00:13 - my own for a long time I've been wanting
00:14 - to do something using controller input
00:16 - and we'd recently been playing a lot of
00:18 - Super Smash Bros for the Nintendo 64
00:20 - inspired by this idea of multi character
00:22 - combat I started to sketch out a level I
00:24 - thought I should stay in the little
00:26 - diary mindset so I tried to keep
00:27 - everything as simple as possible I took
00:29 - the battlefield stage from the Wii U
00:31 - game and recreated it using basic shapes
00:33 - it wasn't pretty but I really wanted to
00:35 - move on to something more important
00:37 - movement and this is PI 5 the mechanic
00:39 - that I spend the most time on
00:40 - I had a few requirements I wanted the
00:42 - movement to be smooth but responsive I
00:44 - wanted a lot of movement on both the
00:46 - horizontal and the vertical axis and
00:48 - finally I needed the character movement
00:50 - to blend nicely with combat now if you
00:52 - ever tried creating physics based
00:53 - movement in unity you know that
00:55 - controlling a character using forces can
00:56 - quickly make it feel sloppy and
00:58 - unresponsive but I needed to use physics
01:00 - because I wanted to combat between
01:02 - players to be physics based the way I
01:04 - ended up solving this problem was by
01:05 - adjusting the amount of force applied to
01:07 - a player depending on the current
01:09 - velocity of the player in the given
01:10 - direction this means that if you press
01:12 - right and the character is already
01:13 - moving quickly in that direction it's
01:15 - not gonna apply that much force however
01:17 - if you then push left it's going to
01:18 - apply a great amount of force trying to
01:20 - shift the character in the new direction
01:22 - this approach was great because it gave
01:24 - me full control over these snappiness of
01:26 - the controls and I think they ended up
01:27 - feeling pretty good to give the place
01:29 - the feeling that they could move both
01:30 - horizontally and vertically I add a
01:32 - triple jump along with the ability to
01:34 - control the characters while in mid-air
01:36 - this is also the first time that I
01:38 - changed the level to fit better with the
01:39 - controls when the players are able to
01:41 - move this freely the level needs to give
01:43 - them space to do so so I made the
01:44 - platform smaller and increase the
01:46 - distance between them next I wanted
01:48 - movement to blend with combat I was
01:50 - really inspired by the way that Super
01:51 - Smash Bros handles damage basically the
01:54 - more you get hit the EC you are to knock
01:56 - off the level I really wanted to
01:57 - emphasize this mechanic but with more
01:59 - focus on ranged shooting so I equipped
02:01 - all the characters with weapons that
02:03 - shout out spheres when a player got hit
02:05 - by a sphere it would add a force
02:06 - depending on their current weakness
02:07 - level the weakness level would of course
02:09 - also increase over time as the card hit
02:11 - the only way to die in the game was to
02:12 - get shot off the
02:13 - platform I think this works really well
02:15 - because it feels like you're always in
02:17 - control if you get shot really hard you
02:18 - squeeze the joystick and do everything
02:20 - you can to time your jumps in an effort
02:22 - to make it back I also add a visual
02:24 - feedback on the current weakness level
02:25 - of the characters by scaling them up as
02:27 - they got weaker at this point the game
02:29 - was playable and I started testing it
02:30 - with my friends I quickly found out
02:32 - however that a lot of stuff still needed
02:34 - to be changed
02:35 - of course I needed to tweak some values
02:36 - like movement speed and damage but the
02:38 - main problem was the layout of the level
02:40 - but the level worked great in Super
02:42 - Smash Bros it played really poorly in my
02:44 - game I found that the big issue with the
02:46 - use of floating platforms my game was
02:48 - centered around shooting and the
02:49 - platform's would often get in the way
02:51 - this led to moments of in fairness where
02:52 - players would randomly get saved by the
02:54 - environment without even trying - it
02:56 - also made it too hard to hit each other
02:58 - because you could simply hide on the
02:59 - other side of a platform so to fix this
03:01 - I completely removed all platforms and
03:03 - flattened out the level I also made it
03:04 - wider and added lots of holes that
03:06 - players could fall into at this point I
03:08 - started picturing the level with some
03:09 - actual art assets in it I decided to use
03:12 - the Mayan temple pack from Devas it's to
03:13 - make kind of an ancient underground
03:15 - arena in the middle of the arena
03:17 - I made a big full of lava where the
03:18 - players can fight to push each other in
03:20 - I like this idea in particular because
03:21 - well I really wanted to make lava I
03:23 - ended up using a free lava flowing
03:25 - shader from the asset store as a base
03:27 - and then added some particles and a
03:28 - bunch of post-processing effects to help
03:30 - tie everything together when I was happy
03:31 - with the look of the game I once again
03:33 - asked my friends for feedback this time
03:35 - we played the game for a while and had a
03:37 - whole bunch of fun but the combat still
03:39 - needed more death so inspired by Simon's
03:41 - ability to charge her attacks I had to
03:43 - charge up to the spheres charging up an
03:45 - attack increased both the size damage
03:47 - and speed of the projectiles and help
03:49 - make combat much more interesting now
03:51 - each player had to decide in a given
03:53 - situation whether to fire quick short
03:54 - bursts or to charge up hoping for that
03:57 - one big hit I also added strategies for
03:59 - avoiding and blocking attacks I made it
04:01 - so if you hit all the players bullets
04:02 - they get destroyed and I'm also added
04:04 - knock-back to the weapon so you could
04:05 - use a powerful attack as a way to stop
04:07 - yourself from falling in the lava at
04:09 - this point I was happy with how combat
04:10 - felt and I worked on polishing the game
04:12 - a bit I added a camera that would
04:14 - dynamically follow around and zoom in
04:15 - and out to fit all the players and I
04:17 - also added some effects for extra flare
04:19 - using the Unity particle path and that's
04:20 - pretty much where the game is in its
04:22 - current state I've experimented with
04:23 - adding power-ups but I still need to add
04:25 - many more to make that
04:26 - viable of course they'll have a bunch of
04:28 - stuff that I'd like to do like add more
04:30 - detail to the level and add moving
04:32 - elements to make it more dynamic but
04:33 - overall I'm happy with what I did
04:35 - unfortunately it took away the pain of
04:37 - not participating in Londonderry at
04:38 - least some of it so that's pretty much
04:40 - it for this video if you enjoyed it
04:41 - maybe check out some of my other behind
04:43 - the scenes work on that thanks for
04:45 - watching and I will see you in the next
