00:00 - a few weeks ago we held the first
00:01 - Community Game Jam a game development
00:03 - marathon where you get one week to make
00:05 - a game from scratch and we were so
00:07 - overwhelmed with how many people
00:09 - participated in the Jam 6,800 people
00:12 - joined and we got more than 1100
00:14 - submissions which makes it the second
00:16 - biggest Jam every to be hosted on itch
00:18 - so before we start going through the
00:20 - amazing entries I just want to say a
00:22 - huge thanks to everyone who participated
00:24 - in the Jam and helped make it a success
00:26 - over the past few days we've been
00:28 - playing a bunch of submissions and
00:29 - picked out some that we would like to
00:31 - show in this video so without further
00:33 - ado let's have a look at some of my
00:34 - favorite games from the community game
00:36 - jam in no particular order but first
00:38 - this video is sponsored by ludecke
00:40 - ludecke are the credits of the well
00:42 - known visual scripting solution bolt and
00:44 - they've just launched a completely new
00:46 - Unity workflow tool called peak peak
00:48 - comes with a bunch of features like
00:50 - toolbars that will let you inspect game
00:52 - objects components and materials outside
00:54 - the inspector and a crater which quickly
00:56 - lets you create new game objects
00:57 - directly in your scene you piec makes
00:59 - especially level design a lot easier it
01:02 - speeds up your process and ensures a
01:04 - clean editor through a focused workflow
01:06 - overall it will make your game to have
01:08 - life a lot easier and it just feels like
01:10 - a natural part of unity so if you're
01:12 - interested in improving your unity
01:14 - workflow I definitely recommend you
01:15 - check it out to get started simply click
01:17 - the link in the description so the theme
01:19 - for the jam was the game is a liar and I
01:22 - think it's amazing how many different
01:23 - games you guys manage to come up with
01:25 - around this theme take for example the
01:27 - incredibly fun and equally frustrating
01:30 - game the tutorial in this game the
01:32 - player must complete a punch of tutorial
01:34 - levels without exactly being sure of
01:35 - which parts of the instructions to trust
01:37 - and which not to this leads to some
01:43 - really fun and surprising events and
01:44 - definitely forced me to overcome my
01:46 - desire to push large and shiny buttons
01:48 - at least on the second attempt it's also
01:51 - really hard which makes the lack of
01:53 - checkpoints pretty brutal
01:56 - [Music]
01:59 - this game definitely reminded me of my
02:01 - own entry detective truth in that it
02:04 - pretends to be a normal puzzle
02:05 - platformer but then surprises the player
02:08 - by having seemingly harmless gameplay
02:10 - elements killed without warning in fact
02:12 - I think this was a fairly common
02:13 - interpretation of the theme
02:15 - take for example games don't lie when
02:18 - the creator of this game tells you that
02:19 - this game doesn't lie that is definitely
02:21 - a lie in itself being probably one of
02:24 - the most frustrating games I've played
02:25 - for this gem I now understand why people
02:27 - in the comment section talked about rage
02:30 - craving it's definitely also a game that
02:32 - puts your memory to work as you have to
02:33 - remember the right path where there are
02:35 - spikes laid out what's really there and
02:37 - what isn't it's also a really well paced
02:40 - game because it adds slower storytelling
02:42 - parts in between every chapter since the
02:45 - story itself is fun this has sort of a
02:47 - calming effect that makes you cool down
02:49 - before inevitably getting very mad again
02:51 - and talking about story a game that I
02:54 - really like is a normal dungeon in this
02:57 - game you set out as a knight in shining
02:59 - armor to slay the horrible Beast that
03:01 - dwells within the deep dark dungeon on
03:04 - the way you meet an old man that tells
03:05 - you that many knights have attempted
03:07 - this before you and none have returned
03:09 - the graphics and level design both work
03:11 - really well however the best thing is
03:14 - definitely the ending see after having
03:16 - fought through this dungeon and of
03:17 - course died a bunch of times you come
03:19 - upon the beasts lair here corpses of
03:22 - Knights are strewn about and standing
03:24 - over them is dumb dumb dumb and not a
03:28 - knight so you condemned him as a monster
03:30 - and fight him however as soon as you
03:32 - managed to kill him another Knight comes
03:35 - along sees you standing on top of this
03:37 - pile of corpses condemns you as a
03:39 - monster and kills you great and
03:42 - effective writing and a nice way to wrap
03:44 - up the story and staying in the realm of
03:46 - dungeons dungeons and deception is a
03:48 - wonderfully different take on the theme
03:50 - it's a psychological card game where you
03:52 - use cards such as insult that damages
03:56 - the enemy or keep it inside that
03:58 - fortifies yourself in order to fight
04:00 - your way through a dungeon the cool
04:02 - thing is that you need to think about
04:03 - how you combine these cards with like
04:05 - hearts to make the most of them the only
04:07 - problem is that lies damage both you
04:10 - and the enemy so you have to be careful
04:12 - when to lie and when not to plus they're
04:14 - just a lot of cool cards that can be
04:16 - uncovered as you progress such as let it
04:19 - all out that damages enemies based on
04:21 - how much you've used keep it inside and
04:23 - spread that makes copies of a lie I
04:26 - personally really enjoyed this one and
04:28 - it had me go oh cool
04:29 - every time I discovered a new card now
04:32 - one of the most innovative games that I
04:33 - played was key defense this is a tower
04:37 - defense game but not in the usual way
04:39 - instead of placing towers the player has
04:41 - to create a path for the enemies to
04:43 - travel to make sure that the towers in
04:45 - that level can reach and kill them
04:47 - before they get to the end
04:48 - [Music]
04:51 - combine this with the genius idea of
04:53 - using a keyboard as the grid for the
04:55 - levels and you have a really unique
04:57 - experience plus I think it was
04:59 - surprisingly satisfying to sculpt paths
05:01 - by clicking the right sequence of
05:03 - buttons on the keyboard
05:04 - of course my keyboard is based on the
05:06 - Danish alphabet so there was a bit of
05:08 - guesswork involved to figure out which
05:10 - Keys map to what in the game of course I
05:13 - later figured out that you could just
05:14 - use the mouse
05:15 - [Music]
05:17 - oh well also the best pan award for the
05:21 - first Community Game Jam goes to liar
05:24 - because never trust a small harp they
05:26 - often turn out to be liars gets me every
05:31 - time
05:31 - in fact I think something a lot of the
05:33 - games did really well was the use of
05:35 - humor most of the time it was the
05:37 - incredibly cheeky and frustrating type
05:39 - of humor such as when I sat down to play
05:41 - a track of Lies I was really getting
05:43 - ready to race and I even picked out a
05:46 - car just to find out that it was all
05:48 - made up and it was another platformer
05:50 - game and yes yet another frustrating one
05:53 - another game that had me laughing was
05:55 - fun fair unfair fun fun fair unforce it
05:59 - was a must play as puns are pretty
06:01 - popular here amongst the brackish team
06:03 - in this management game you have to
06:05 - build fair stands that you can choose to
06:06 - rig in order to scam your park visitors
06:09 - for more money
06:09 - this however makes the customers mad and
06:12 - you have to constantly get rid of
06:13 - complaining customers by either using
06:15 - the baseball bat or by hiring a bouncer
06:18 - the best part of this game is definitely
06:20 - the wonderful ways that you can rig your
06:22 - games by for example replacing the tip
06:24 - of the arrows at the balloon stand with
06:26 - suction cups and as you can see I ended
06:28 - up spending probably a bit too much time
06:30 - on this one next up we have round o
06:32 - Emporium a game where you play is a new
06:35 - store owner that has to deliver the
06:36 - right products to customers but you're
06:39 - deceitful robot pal Roboto
06:41 - keeps giving you wrong instructions see
06:43 - Roberto believes machines should run the
06:45 - shovel own and so he's constantly trying
06:47 - to sabotage you this makes for a really
06:50 - fun game where you always have to fetch
06:51 - a product that has none of the
06:53 - characteristics described by Roberto its
06:55 - symbol stressful and the graphics are
06:57 - really cute of all it's just a game that
06:59 - doesn't try to do too much and because
07:01 - of that it excels at being what it is
07:04 - now one game that I just can't wait to
07:07 - talk about is click head this game
07:09 - completely blew me away at first you're
07:12 - presented with a menu as you try
07:14 - clicking the buttons however they break
07:16 - and a text box appears at this point you
07:19 - realize that the menu has totally
07:21 - different plans with you it starts
07:23 - talking about how you were probably
07:24 - expecting a game here but there is none
07:27 - and for a moment you think well I guess
07:29 - this is it however the menu
07:31 - gets bored and decides to spawn in a
07:33 - player and this is when things start to
07:35 - take off because the menu finds out that
07:36 - the game is parked the player can move
07:39 - outside the menu screen and what follows
07:41 - is an amazingly original and well
07:43 - thought-out platformer that takes place
07:45 - inside a virus infested menu the player
07:47 - must use the different menu buttons to
07:49 - complete puzzles and also has to use the
07:51 - mouse as part of the platforming in fact
07:53 - you come upon buttons that are so bucked
07:55 - out that the mouse cannot travel through
07:57 - them which makes for some really
07:59 - interesting gameplay all in all I cannot
08:01 - say enough good things about click head
08:03 - including the wonderful ending and
08:05 - talking about crazy menus another game
08:07 - that embraces the totally chaotic is all
08:10 - his cares in love and war
08:14 - [Music]
08:15 - this game is complete madness from the
08:17 - very beginning having the very menu
08:19 - itself be a challenge to get through
08:21 - after getting into the game you are then
08:23 - presented with four different fast
08:24 - choices none of which are what they seem
08:27 - the game also has a shop where you can
08:29 - purchase items of course you can trust
08:31 - anything from price to stat bonuses so
08:34 - you have to play several times to figure
08:35 - out what works and what doesn't of all a
08:38 - really fun experience and last but
08:40 - certainly not least I have to mention
08:42 - wreck YZ it's not only a weird
08:45 - experience to play as a cyborg version
08:47 - of yourself it's also an incredibly fun
08:49 - fast-paced shooter and also do I look
08:52 - like a super villain to you guys cuz I'm
08:55 - kind of noticing a trend is it a vibe
08:57 - that I'm giving off more weird and
09:02 - that's pretty much all the games we have
09:03 - time to cover in this video of course
09:05 - there's so many amazing games that we
09:07 - haven't talked about so I definitely
09:08 - encourage you to go play them yourself
09:10 - this of course I think to all of them in
