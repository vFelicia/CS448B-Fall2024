00:02 - hello everyone and welcome to the
00:05 - crouching tutorial done by brackets I am
00:08 - the CEO of Brad keys and in this video
00:10 - we are indeed gonna talk about crouching
00:14 - functionality in the last video we did
00:17 - we talked about how to do sprinting and
00:20 - program that and so in this video we are
00:23 - both going to talk about how to script
00:25 - the crouching itself and how to merge
00:28 - the crouching script with the sprinting
00:31 - script so that they will function
00:34 - together the right way and so if you
00:38 - missed the sprinting video you can
00:40 - always go ahead and look in the
00:44 - description that will be a link and if
00:47 - you're interested in getting either the
00:48 - Sprint the Crouch or the sprinting
00:50 - Crouch script you can go to our website
00:53 - brakus come and download the survival
00:55 - game assets and in there they will be
00:58 - included so that was it for the long
01:02 - intro as always I have opened up unity
01:05 - and as you can see currently our player
01:09 - has this sprint script applied to him
01:12 - let's go ahead and just disable that for
01:15 - now let's go down to the project pane
01:17 - hit create and then JavaScript and oops
01:24 - rename this to rename so there we go
01:34 - rename this to crouch or crouching
01:40 - whatever you want just going to Crouch
01:43 - double click it to open it up in
01:45 - monodevelop
01:45 - and remember to always drag it onto the
01:48 - player so that we have the script
01:51 - applied and now we can see monodevelop
01:54 - popping up and if we just give it a
02:00 - second I'm rendering a video in the
02:02 - background so it might be a little slow
02:05 - now that was the sprint script let's go
02:08 - ahead and minimize that and we are going
02:11 - to keep both the function star
02:13 - and the function update so you can go
02:14 - ahead and space down the brackets I just
02:17 - like it that way first of all we're
02:20 - going to make some variables the first
02:23 - one we are going to make is going to be
02:25 - called walk speed and it's going to be a
02:30 - type float and it's going to be equal to
02:34 - let's say seven so this is our regular
02:39 - speed next one is going to be called
02:43 - Crouch speed it's going to be a type
02:47 - float again and it's going to be equal
02:50 - to about three this is a speed while
02:57 - crouching so basically we only need
03:05 - these because we want to change our
03:07 - speed when we are down on our knees when
03:09 - we're crunching so on that's it for that
03:13 - that is for the user to declare in unity
03:16 - now let's make some private variables in
03:20 - these we are going to cash a lot of data
03:23 - store a lot of data there that we can
03:26 - data access so the first one is going to
03:28 - be called char motor and it's going to
03:33 - be a type character motor the next one
03:37 - is going to be tire called private bar
03:40 - chart controller and it's going to be a
03:45 - character controller the next one is
03:51 - going to be another private bar the
03:54 - transform and it's going to be a type
03:59 - transform and the last one is going to
04:03 - be called again private one then char
04:06 - heights float and we don't need to
04:12 - declare variable air or a number to this
04:15 - yes yet so this is going to be the
04:19 - initial height now the reason why we are
04:23 - creating all of these is because in the
04:25 - start function
04:26 - we want to store a lot of information in
04:30 - these and you could exclude these
04:34 - variables though it would make it a lot
04:37 - harder on the computer because then we
04:39 - would have to find the character motor
04:42 - every time we needed to adjust something
04:44 - in it and we would have to find the
04:46 - character controller find the transform
04:48 - and look after the height and so on so
04:53 - instead of doing that every frame or at
04:56 - least every time we click a button we'll
04:59 - just do it once and that's in the start
05:01 - function so we'll type char motor equals
05:06 - get component and then in the
05:11 - parenthesis we're going to type
05:12 - character motor next one we're going to
05:17 - type the transform equals transform then
05:23 - you're going to type charge controller
05:26 - equals get component character
05:34 - controller and then we're going to type
05:39 - char height equals char controller dot
05:47 - height and you can mix up the ordering
05:52 - of these as much as you like as long as
05:55 - the char height is beneath the char
05:57 - controller and so let me just quickly
06:01 - explain what we are storing in these
06:04 - variables the term motor is the one that
06:07 - we are going to access whenever we want
06:09 - the to change the speed of our our
06:12 - player the transform is what we access
06:17 - every time we want to get stuff like the
06:19 - position the size the rotation and such
06:24 - so every time we want to manipulate this
06:27 - object we want to use the transform the
06:31 - char controller is the character
06:34 - controller and it's the one that we are
06:37 - going to be using for check
06:39 - stuff like if the the the what Hightower
06:45 - player is and finally we have the char
06:49 - heights which is which is going to store
06:51 - the height so now we can go down to a
06:56 - function date and then here you're going
06:59 - to type VAR h and then char height and
07:08 - semicolon we're going to make another
07:12 - one VAR speed equals walk speed now the
07:18 - H is going to be by default or char
07:21 - height which means our initial height
07:25 - the speed is going to be by default our
07:29 - regular speed now we want something that
07:34 - could change these so in case of our in
07:39 - case of the player pressing X for
07:41 - example the C button to crouch we want
07:44 - to change the height we want to change
07:46 - the speed and so let's create an if
07:50 - statement to find out if the play is
07:52 - pressing anything so let's go input if
07:55 - input that get key and I'm going to type
08:00 - C and again if this isn't working for
08:05 - you
08:05 - the C in the doing it like this you can
08:11 - always type key code and then dot
08:15 - whatever you want then you're sure it's
08:17 - going to work I'm just going to do it
08:19 - like this so C and then end up the
08:23 - parenthesis and open up some curly
08:26 - brackets whoops
08:30 - curly brackets and inside of the curly
08:33 - brackets I'm going to type H so the
08:39 - character height equals character height
08:48 - times 0.5 and so we are going to have
08:56 - the height of our character we're simply
09:00 - going to make him half as big or as tall
09:07 - then we're going to type speed equals
09:11 - crowd speed and there you go so whenever
09:20 - the player presses the C key we want
09:24 - this variable to be high half of what it
09:27 - was before and we want the speed to be
09:31 - equals to Crouch speed so now we can
09:34 - move slower but this only changes
09:38 - variables now we are going to make these
09:41 - variables take effect inside of the
09:43 - character so we are going to write write
09:46 - char and this is outside of the if
09:48 - statement you're going to write char
09:51 - motor movement dot max forward speed
09:58 - equals speed and then semicolon and here
10:05 - we are setting the max speed so this
10:12 - action this makes it so that our speed
10:14 - variable which is the one changing
10:17 - depending on whether we are crunching or
10:19 - not so here we are making sure that that
10:22 - speed variable will actually influence
10:24 - the speed and now we want to create a
10:28 - variable so our last height equals char
10:36 - controller dot height
10:41 - and this is going to make sure that we
10:43 - can stand up or Crouch smoothly by
10:53 - starring the last hide the the height
10:57 - that we have right now we are we can use
11:00 - the lip function inside of unity to
11:05 - smoothly transition between the two
11:07 - heights now you're going to write chart
11:11 - controller dot height equals oops
11:19 - try controller dot height equals math
11:25 - dot lab and inside of the lip inside of
11:33 - the parenthesis we are going to write
11:34 - character or char controller dot height
11:42 - comma H comma five times time dot Delta
11:58 - time and I want explain how the math
12:05 - that loop actually works though I can
12:08 - say that it will transition from the
12:12 - current character controller height to
12:15 - the H and so that's how that works we
12:20 - could also do the last height equals
12:23 - math dollar but you get the idea and so
12:28 - we are going to write the transform
12:35 - dot position dot y plus equals char
12:48 - controller dot height minus last height
13:01 - divided by two and this is going to help
13:06 - us fix the vertical position so that we
13:12 - want fall through the fourth floor now
13:17 - this is how our script looks and that's
13:21 - basically it for the scripting part now
13:23 - let me try to explain what happens so we
13:29 - have all of these variables stored and
13:32 - we want to do it so that if the player
13:34 - presses the C key the character height
13:38 - goes becomes half of what it was before
13:43 - in a smooth transition and the speed
13:48 - gets to be the Crouch speed and then of
13:53 - course we want to fix all of the box
13:55 - with the vertical position that's
13:57 - basically what this script is doing and
14:00 - now let me show you how this actually
14:03 - works in game and also the reason why we
14:06 - aren't only changing the capsule
14:09 - Collider and the character controllers
14:12 - Collider and not the entire size of a
14:15 - game object is that if we scale it down
14:17 - like this weapons and other things
14:20 - attached will also be scaled down so
14:23 - that if you so if you want to actually
14:25 - make it look like the players coaching
14:27 - in game you need to create a crouching
14:29 - animation for him and make that play
14:32 - whenever we hit the C key so now let's
14:36 - hit play and let's try to hold down
14:38 - these control oh no I'm sorry the C key
14:42 - and there you go you can see that the
14:45 - graphics is indeed like it was before
14:48 - but the capsule Collider itself scales
14:53 - down you can see the height variable
14:55 - changing over here on the right hand
14:57 - side so that's it for making the
15:02 - crunching functionality though if we try
15:06 - to also enable this print script and hit
15:09 - play and I then hold down the C key to
15:14 - crouch you can see that my my my speed
15:23 - actually doesn't change and when I then
15:26 - hold down the shift key I can even
15:29 - sprint while crouching and that is
15:33 - indeed only because of the sprint script
15:35 - so they can interact weirdly so let's
15:41 - match these two scripts to make sure
15:44 - that they will work perfectly together
15:47 - so now let's duplicate this crowd script
15:50 - and call this call this rename call the
15:59 - sprint and Crouch like that double click
16:06 - to open up in monodevelop let's go ahead
16:10 - and minimize the crunch so now we want
16:13 - to add some more variables we want to
16:15 - add the sprint speed and I won't explain
16:20 - how the sprinting pod works in this
16:23 - tutorial since I've already done that in
16:26 - the last one I will just show you how
16:28 - you can match them so they work fine
16:30 - together
16:31 - so our sprint speed of type float is
16:35 - going to be equal to about 13 and it's
16:37 - going to be the speed while sprinting
16:47 - then we are going to need a we have the
16:50 - speed variable so I guess we are going
16:53 - to need the sprinting parts down here so
16:57 - we want to change the speed variable and
17:00 - that is done by saying if char
17:04 - controller dot is grounded and oops and
17:18 - input dot get key left shift or I'll
17:31 - just get the signs or input dot get key
17:45 - get key right shift and close up the
17:53 - parentheses open up some brackets and
17:59 - inside of here we're just going to write
18:01 - speed equals sprint speed and so when
18:09 - our computer runs through this we are
18:14 - able to check whether or not the
18:18 - character is sprinting or crouching the
18:21 - way it works is that first of all we
18:23 - make a variable and if we're not doing
18:26 - anything it's just going to be walk
18:28 - speed so if the character controller is
18:31 - grounded and we aren't pressing down the
18:34 - key here and we are not crouching it's
18:38 - just going to go down here and change
18:40 - the speed to the ordinary walk speed if
18:43 - we though are sprinting it's going to
18:47 - change it to the sprint speed and go
18:49 - down here and actually make the change
18:51 - if we are sprinting but also crouching
18:57 - it's going to change it to crouch
18:59 - at the end and then change it in the
19:03 - character motor and so the crouching
19:05 - will override the sprinting now let's
19:08 - see if it works if we go ahead and hit
19:10 - save and go back into unity and hit play
19:13 - we can hold down the shift key and
19:18 - nothing happens let me see if I have
19:22 - applied yes I need to apply the script
19:25 - to a player in order for it to work now
19:28 - let's hit play again hold down the shift
19:30 - the play is sprinting Crouch they play
19:35 - crunches and move slowly and when I hold
19:38 - down the shift-key nothing happens so
19:41 - that is it for the sprinting and
19:43 - crouching tutorials I hope you enjoyed
19:46 - it and I'll see you in the next video
