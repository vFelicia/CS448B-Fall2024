00:00 - one thing that has been a bit confusing
00:02 - the last couple of years was how to deal
00:03 - with 2d lighting in unity unity of
00:06 - course started out as a 3d engine and
00:08 - has since created a bunch of tools to
00:11 - make working with 2d a lot easier
00:13 - however up until this point we've been
00:15 - creating all of our 2d games for a 3d
00:17 - renderer and if we were to use lights
00:19 - they were 3d lights but unity has now
00:22 - created a 2d specific renderer Oh
00:25 - 2d to be this means that lighting is
00:32 - optimized for 2d and that we aren't
00:34 - wasting a bunch of resources on
00:36 - calculating a third dimension the user
00:39 - will never see it also means that unity
00:41 - has created a bunch of 2d specific
00:43 - lights that are much more flexible than
00:45 - 3d lights but before we get too far into
00:47 - it this video is sponsored by Zen ma
00:49 - Academy then where is a unity authorized
00:51 - learning partner which means that the
00:53 - unity curriculums have been reviewed and
00:55 - approved by Unity themselves this
00:58 - ensures top quality courses that will
00:59 - take you all the way from beginner to
01:01 - intermediate and more advanced content
01:03 - the courses are project-based and
01:05 - include everything from 2d 3d AR and VR
01:08 - to making custom avatars and big RPG
01:11 - systems with a one-time payment you get
01:13 - lifetime access to all courses included
01:16 - in a curriculum in course support by
01:18 - expert instructors and by using the
01:20 - coupon code brackets you get 15% off
01:22 - also right now we have a special offer
01:24 - where you can sign up for their five-day
01:26 - unity boot camp for free you can of
01:28 - course do so by clicking the links in
01:30 - the description so lights on It's
01:33 - Showtime so as you can see I've set up
01:36 - this simple example scene here using
01:38 - some of the assets from one of my recent
01:40 - game projects the game is called date
01:42 - night and if you want to see how I made
01:44 - it we have a video showing exactly that
01:46 - of course if you want to use the same
01:48 - example project I'll have a link for
01:49 - that in the description now the first
01:51 - thing that we want to do is make sure
01:52 - that we're using unity 2019 point 2 or
01:55 - later at the time of recording this
01:57 - video this version is currently in beta
01:59 - so I'll be using the beta version we
02:02 - also want to go to window and open up
02:04 - the package manager here we want to
02:06 - select all packages and scroll to the
02:09 - one called
02:09 - lightweight RP for render pipeline let's
02:13 - open this up and choose
02:14 - see all versions and you want to
02:16 - navigate to the latest version here in
02:18 - my case that is six point seven point
02:20 - one and that is the version where these
02:22 - lights are first introduced so you need
02:24 - to make sure that you're using this or
02:25 - later to do that you can simply click it
02:27 - and if it isn't already installed you
02:29 - will have the option to do so here great
02:32 - now we can close down the package
02:33 - manager and we are now ready to set up
02:35 - our project to use the lightweight
02:36 - render pipeline to do this let's go edit
02:39 - let's navigate to our project settings
02:41 - I'm gonna go to the graphics tab here
02:44 - and as you can see there's a slot here
02:45 - for a render pipeline asset and in my
02:48 - case this is empty if you already have a
02:50 - pipeline asset here that's great in my
02:53 - case I do not so I'm gonna go ahead and
02:54 - create one to do this we'll go to the
02:56 - project hit create go on the rendering
02:59 - lightweight render pipeline and select
03:01 - the pipeline asset and I'm just gonna
03:03 - call it
03:03 - WIP asset when then take this asset and
03:07 - drag it into the slot and that's all for
03:09 - our project settings a UND project is
03:11 - now using lightweight
03:13 - however lightweight can be used for both
03:15 - 3d and 2d games so we want to let
03:18 - lightweight know that we are working in
03:20 - 2d to do this we can select the LWR P
03:23 - asset that we just created and here we
03:25 - have a bunch of settings for configuring
03:27 - lightweight in our case we want to
03:29 - change the renderer type from forward
03:31 - renderer which say three-dimensional
03:33 - renderer to a custom renderer so now we
03:36 - have a slot where we can input a custom
03:38 - renderer and this is where the cool part
03:40 - comes because unity has now created a
03:42 - 2-d specific renderer so to use this
03:44 - we'll go create rendering lightweight
03:47 - render pipeline and let's select the 2d
03:49 - renderer let's just call it to the
03:51 - renderer let's select our L WRP acid and
03:54 - drag that in as our data and voila now
03:58 - unity will only render to the lights of
04:01 - course nothing is happening in our scene
04:03 - so it isn't that magical yet and the
04:07 - reason for this is that all of our
04:08 - different sprites here are all using the
04:10 - default sprites material which is an
04:13 - unlit material so it won't react to
04:15 - lighting at all however if we go ahead
04:17 - and drag in a new sprite so I'm just
04:19 - gonna select any of the sprites in my
04:21 - folder here you will see that it's
04:23 - completely black because we don't have
04:25 - any lights in our scene you can also see
04:27 - that on amateur
04:28 - it's using sprite lid default so all we
04:31 - need to do is change this on all of our
04:33 - different objects and you Lee has
04:34 - created a really easy way for us to do
04:36 - this simply go edit render pipeline
04:39 - lightweight render pipeline 2d renderer
04:41 - and here we can upgrade our scene to the
04:44 - 2d renderer let's click that hit proceed
04:46 - and as you can see it tells us the name
04:48 - of all the objects that was upgraded and
04:50 - upgraded just means it swapped out the
04:53 - material and if we clear that and have a
04:55 - look at our scene it's completely black
04:57 - so we're now ready to add lights
05:00 - interest scene and let's start with a
05:02 - point light so let's right click in our
05:04 - hierarchy go light 2d and let's select a
05:08 - point light as you can see it
05:09 - immediately appears here the radius
05:12 - isn't that big so I'm gonna go ahead and
05:14 - increase it and when I do we can see
05:16 - more and more of our level however you
05:18 - will notice that our background still
05:20 - appears completely black the reason for
05:23 - this is that two tea lights allow us to
05:25 - choose what sorting layers to target
05:27 - this is a really cool feature because it
05:29 - gives us a lot of control however it
05:31 - also means that we need to go in here
05:32 - and include all of our target sorting
05:35 - layers for this light and we now see the
05:37 - light spilling on to our foreground and
05:39 - background as well so I'm gonna use this
05:41 - as the light emitting from the candle of
05:44 - our dinner here so I'm gonna move it up
05:46 - I'm also going to increase the outer
05:48 - radius a bit more and as you can see we
05:50 - can also play with the inner radius to
05:52 - fill this out in any way that we'd like
05:53 - I'm just gonna leave that at zero for
05:55 - now we also play around with the
05:57 - fall-off intensity which allows us to
05:59 - kind of smooth out the effect and as
06:01 - with all other lights we have an
06:03 - intensity slider as well as the ability
06:05 - to adjust color so in my case I'm gonna
06:07 - make this way more orange I think that
06:10 - looks pretty cool and we now have kind
06:13 - of the effect of a candlelight you also
06:15 - notice that anything that isn't
06:16 - currently being lid is completely black
06:19 - now this might be something that you
06:20 - wanted some cases but here I think it's
06:23 - a bit too much so to fix this let's go
06:26 - ahead and add a light 2d global light
06:29 - this is simply going to shine light
06:31 - uniformly onto all selected objects so
06:34 - again I'm going to target all sorting
06:36 - layers and I'm simply going to decrease
06:38 - the intensity here to something like 0.3
06:40 - and
06:41 - I'm also going to change the color to
06:42 - kind of a dusty purple I think that
06:45 - gives a pretty cool dungeon a look that
06:47 - definitely already looks a lot better so
06:50 - what else can we add to this scene well
06:52 - let's go in and let's duplicate our
06:53 - point light by simply hitting ctrl D
06:56 - let's move this over to the blue
06:58 - platform let's change the color here to
07:00 - a light blue and right away I think that
07:04 - looks pretty cool I'm gonna do the same
07:05 - thing but for our purple platform and
07:08 - change the hue to a bright purple there
07:11 - we go that already looks so much better
07:13 - in fact a really cool thing about these
07:15 - point lights is that they can also be
07:17 - used as spotlights simply duplicate this
07:20 - one I'm gonna change the color here to
07:22 - or more yellowy tint and we can simply
07:25 - click and drag on any one of these
07:27 - points to change the angle and we have
07:31 - both an inner and an outer angle if we
07:33 - want to create a bit of feathering and
07:35 - right away we have a point light pretty
07:38 - cool now I'm just gonna go ahead and
07:39 - remove this from my scene here and let's
07:42 - try and create a new light and this one
07:44 - is going to be a sprite light so sprite
07:47 - lights
07:47 - as the name suggests basically allow us
07:49 - to input a sprite that will light up our
07:52 - scene in my case I've gone ahead and
07:54 - found this sprite cookie this was part
07:56 - of some 2d light samples that you only
07:58 - put on github I'll of course have a link
08:00 - for that in the description as well and
08:01 - it works really well if we simply drag
08:03 - this into the sprite slot and change the
08:06 - target sorting layers to all and right
08:09 - away we can see the sprite kind of
08:10 - appearing on top of our scene and
08:12 - illuminating the objects now I'm just
08:14 - gonna put this on top of our blue player
08:16 - here I'm gonna change the color to a
08:18 - bluish tint and now it looks like a blue
08:21 - player is shining pretty cool and let's
08:23 - just do the same thing for our pink one
08:26 - awesome now a really cool light type
08:29 - that is specific to 2d is the new
08:31 - freeform light so if we right click go
08:34 - light 2d and choose freeform this light
08:38 - basically allows us to draw the shape of
08:41 - our own light I think you can do some
08:43 - really really cool things with this if
08:45 - for example we wanted to have a pit of
08:47 - acid at the bottom of a level here well
08:50 - then we could simply draw in the light
08:53 - for this pit of acid
08:55 - so I do some kind of a square here it
08:58 - goes up to around here and of course you
09:01 - can add as many points as you'd like for
09:03 - this or simply select and delete them
09:06 - and when you're done simply stop editing
09:08 - this shape we then select all for our
09:10 - sorting layers you can now see that it's
09:12 - illuminating our scene for the color
09:14 - here I'm gonna change that to a green
09:16 - for that acid look we also play around
09:19 - with the fall-off in order to kind of
09:21 - adjust the fade that we're getting now
09:23 - as you can see it kind of looks like we
09:25 - have this light shining from beneath
09:27 - across this entire section really really
09:30 - cool and the final light that we have if
09:32 - we go under light 2d is the parametric
09:35 - light and this basically allows us to
09:38 - create light shapes with X amount of
09:40 - corners so if we just set this to all as
09:42 - you can see we now have a five sided
09:45 - polygon as our light and we can go in
09:48 - and adjust the amount of sides so now we
09:50 - have a triangle we can also do a square
09:52 - and pretty much just keep going I'm just
09:55 - gonna leave this at five sides and put
09:57 - it in the middle here and as always we
09:59 - have a radius as well as some fall-off
10:01 - we can also adjust the angle as you can
10:03 - see there's plenty of fun stuff that you
10:05 - can do with this however I don't think
10:08 - it suits this scene so I'm just gonna go
10:09 - ahead and delete it also I think our
10:12 - asset light down here cuts off a bit too
10:13 - quick so I'm just going to increase the
10:15 - fall-off a bit more that looks a lot
10:17 - better now one of the things that is
10:19 - really cool about this new system is
10:21 - that it's now a lot easier to work with
10:23 - normal Maps yes finally if for example
10:27 - we wanted to apply a normal map to the
10:29 - stones in the background here all we
10:31 - need to do is simply select our
10:32 - background go to the sprite editor and
10:35 - here we now have a new option called
10:37 - secondary textures if we hit the plus
10:41 - sign here and this needs to be exact so
10:43 - underscore normal map just like this you
10:46 - can't name it anything that you want you
10:48 - need to name it exactly this and then
10:51 - specify a texture and I've of course
10:53 - gone ahead and created a normal map
10:55 - version of this background so I'm simply
10:57 - going to drag that in and hit apply of
10:59 - course make sure to select all normal
11:01 - Maps you're using and set the texture
11:03 - type to normal map now type the show
11:05 - inside of our scene we need to select
11:07 - our light
11:08 - I'm just gonna exclude the global light
11:10 - here and as your discovery there is a
11:12 - checkbox here called use normal map so
11:15 - this of course allows you to choose if
11:16 - you want your lights to be affected by
11:17 - normal Maps or not in this case we'll
11:19 - simply set that to true as you can see
11:21 - right away we really clearly get that
11:24 - normal mapped effect I'm just gonna go
11:26 - ahead and increase the distance here to
11:28 - lower the effect a bit and right away I
11:30 - think that looks really cool awesome now
11:33 - just to show you the effects of adding a
11:34 - normal map more clearly I've gone ahead
11:36 - and created this simple space example
11:38 - all this has is a space background as
11:41 - well as a rock that is kind of just
11:44 - floating around here I've also gone it
11:46 - and added a global light that just gives
11:48 - a bit of light to the background here it
11:50 - does nothing for the rock and then a
11:52 - point light that is affecting the rock
11:55 - only and as you can see it looks fine
11:57 - when we're moving around the light but
11:59 - the rock definitely does not look
12:00 - three-dimensional so to have our light
12:02 - bounce more realistically off the rock
12:05 - I've gone ahead and added a normal map
12:07 - in the exact same way that we did with
12:09 - the background so going into the sprite
12:12 - editor going on the secondary textures
12:13 - and simply adding it in here with the
12:16 - name underscore normal map and now if we
12:18 - go to a point light here and choose use
12:21 - normal map we can see just how much
12:24 - three-dimensional character this really
12:26 - brings out in our rock we can see light
12:29 - way more realistically bouncing off
12:31 - these different surfaces of a rock
12:34 - really cool and this rock is also part
12:37 - of the two dissembles that unity put up
12:39 - again link for that in the description
12:41 - so now we have a lit scene in unity that
12:43 - is fully 2d using the new 2d renderer
12:46 - really cool so that's pretty much it for
12:49 - this video now I think there are
12:50 - definitely some things that could help
12:52 - improve this new 2d lighting system most
12:54 - of them are smaller ui/ux changes to
12:56 - make things feel more polished and I'm
12:58 - sure those are coming soon however one
13:00 - big thing for me would be shadows that
13:02 - are based on the shape of sprites
13:04 - similar to an acid like 2d DL luckily I
13:07 - went to the Unity forums and found this
13:08 - reply that indicates that shadows are
13:10 - planned for later this year so I'm
13:12 - definitely looking forward to that also
