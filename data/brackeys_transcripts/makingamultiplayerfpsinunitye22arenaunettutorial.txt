00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus I want to
00:04 - welcome to this video and making a
00:05 - multiplayer PS in unity today we are
00:07 - going to be looking at something really
00:09 - exciting which is importing a
00:11 - cool-looking arena adding a bunch of
00:13 - particle effects and playing around with
00:16 - the lighting to make our scene look a
00:18 - lot more awesome so I've really been
00:20 - looking forward to this video we're not
00:21 - going to be writing a single line of
00:23 - code but we have plenty of stuff to do
00:25 - and the arena of course is custom made
00:27 - and you can use it in any way you like
00:30 - also commercially it's available for
00:32 - download now for free as part of the
00:36 - multiplayer FPS assets pack so without
00:39 - further ado let's jump right into it so
00:42 - you can see that I'm here in unity and I
00:43 - just want to begin by setting up the
00:45 - light the lighting settings so if you go
00:47 - to window and select our lighting it's
00:51 - somewhere here for some reason I kept
00:55 - there it is if you haven't got it open
00:58 - and I like to dock it over here by the
00:59 - inspector and we just want to make sure
01:01 - that our arm build settings down here
01:05 - when it comes to the light Maps is set
01:07 - to auto just so that it will auto build
01:10 - everything as we change things as we go
01:12 - and then we pretty much want to close
01:15 - down unity here or minimize it
01:16 - find the multiplayer FPS assets when
01:18 - you've downloaded those and I've
01:20 - prepared an arena unity package and I've
01:23 - done this because the arena is huge and
01:25 - it has a bunch of models and textures
01:27 - and materials and it's way too much to
01:30 - fit into well even several videos to set
01:34 - all of that up so I've gone ahead and
01:36 - done most of it and we'll just finish it
01:38 - off in this video if you want to do all
01:41 - of this on your own or say edit some of
01:44 - the source files I have included those
01:46 - here so the arena source files let's
01:48 - build up both a blender version and an
01:50 - FBX version and all of the textures that
01:53 - you might use are in here but you can
01:56 - also just import the unity package and
01:58 - then edit the files from there which I
02:00 - definitely recommend you do so please
02:02 - please use this if if you can also on
02:06 - the unity package uses the blender file
02:08 - which means that in order for unity to
02:10 - import and process it properly
02:13 - we will need to have blender installed
02:15 - there will be a link to that in the
02:17 - description it's not a large programming
02:19 - and in any way and it's great to have
02:21 - because it's well friendly awesome to
02:24 - model in so I just definitely just
02:26 - recommend you go over there and install
02:28 - blender so without further ado let's
02:30 - double-click on the arena unity package
02:32 - to open it up in unity here and we can
02:35 - of course deselect different stuff but
02:37 - we just want to import all of it let's
02:39 - say hit import here and this will take a
02:44 - little while because we do have a lot of
02:46 - textures some of them fairly high
02:48 - resolution and some fairly high um
02:53 - detailed models so it will take a little
02:56 - while especially because we have all of
02:59 - the relations between the objects
03:01 - already set up for you so unity has
03:03 - remembered all that stuff but as soon as
03:05 - the as this is done you will see that
03:08 - you get an arena folder over here and in
03:11 - here we have the R this is the model
03:13 - itself you can double click this and it
03:15 - will open up in blender we have a
03:17 - materials folder with all of the
03:19 - different materials that we are going to
03:21 - need and it's actually gone ahead and
03:23 - included some that we don't need so I'm
03:26 - just going to go ahead and delete all of
03:27 - the weirdly named ones which is all of
03:30 - these these shouldn't even be in here
03:34 - it's just the way that unity exports
03:37 - unity packages sometimes it's a bit
03:40 - annoying so you can just select the same
03:43 - ones that I am selecting here if you
03:45 - want to get rid of them or you can just
03:48 - leave them in there it's not going to
03:49 - make a huge difference so just delete
03:51 - all of those and I'm going to do the
03:54 - same with okay so the textures are
03:55 - actually already set up so that was
03:58 - pretty much all we needed to do and now
03:59 - we can just take the arena prefab here
04:01 - which is the one that I've set up for
04:03 - you and simply drag it into a project
04:05 - panel and you should see that all of the
04:08 - textures are here nothing appears weird
04:10 - or anything if it does you might have
04:13 - deleted something that you weren't
04:14 - supposed to so just make sure you don't
04:16 - delete anything I didn't and you can see
04:19 - that this already looks fairly cool but
04:21 - we have so much that we can add it
04:23 - inside of this and you can pretty much
04:25 - click on anything
04:26 - and edit the material or whatever all of
04:29 - the inspectors settings are here so
04:31 - that's pretty cool but what I wanted to
04:33 - go ahead and do is take our environment
04:35 - here and then drag our directional light
04:37 - out from that and maybe call this our
04:39 - Sun and then um you can remove or just
04:43 - disable the environment that we had
04:44 - before just so we only have the arena to
04:47 - work with here so my arena is centered I
04:51 - I think you should do the same thing and
04:53 - basically what I want to begin with here
04:55 - you can see that I've actually made a
04:57 - short to do this here we start by
05:00 - importing the arena well we just did
05:01 - that now we need to set a few layers
05:03 - because the arena here actually I
05:07 - already has some colliders set up if we
05:10 - are select for example the floor here
05:13 - you can see it has a mesh Collider over
05:15 - here however in order for our player to
05:19 - be able to stand on top of this using
05:21 - the system where we're a cast to check
05:24 - if the it's if the player is collidable
05:27 - with this so that he will be able to
05:29 - hover a certain distance above the
05:31 - ground we will have to make sure to
05:32 - change all of the layers where we want
05:34 - that to happen to collidable environment
05:36 - and i've actually done this with my
05:38 - prefab but if your settings are
05:40 - different you will have to go in and do
05:42 - this yourself so make sure to make a tag
05:45 - it as whatever you have called that tag
05:47 - in my case it's collidable environment
05:50 - and you will have to do that with all of
05:52 - the flying platforms as well and you can
05:54 - see here it hasn't done that so let's go
05:56 - and change the layer I believe it just
05:58 - attack if the layer that you want to
06:00 - change you can of course also going and
06:02 - and tagged stuff differently so that
06:05 - will just set that up and that's pretty
06:07 - much all I meant by set layers now we
06:11 - need to position our scene camera
06:13 - because we have our scene camera here
06:15 - and currently it gets an overview of the
06:18 - entire map and that's fine but it
06:19 - doesn't necessarily look too good from
06:22 - the outside so let's find somewhere
06:24 - inside of our scene that looks nice and
06:28 - I'm just going to position it somewhere
06:31 - around here is a pretty nice look I
06:36 - think it gives a pretty nice overview of
06:38 - the map but still with
06:40 - a bit of perspective and what you can do
06:42 - if you've positioned your scene here in
06:46 - a way that you would like your camera to
06:47 - be is press on the scene camera and then
06:50 - press control ship shift F and if you're
06:53 - on a Mac that would be command shift F
06:54 - and it's the same as going to I believe
06:57 - it's game object and then I line with
07:00 - our view and you can see that the scene
07:02 - camera has now snapped to that view so
07:05 - in the game view here will now be the
07:07 - same as the scene view of course not if
07:09 - we change anything you're not seeing the
07:11 - and the camera is still static oops
07:13 - let's just drag that back there
07:15 - cool so I think that looks pretty nice
07:17 - and you can of course position it
07:19 - otherwise and what we also want to do to
07:21 - our scene camera here is just make sure
07:24 - this is not a solid color but that it's
07:25 - also using the skybox however it's not
07:28 - currently visible cone so that was on
07:32 - that now we can go in here we've
07:35 - positioned the camera and it's using the
07:36 - skybox that's perfect now we want to set
07:38 - up another skybox because I think the
07:40 - default skybox is nice for a lot of
07:42 - things but I don't think it kind of
07:44 - suits the style that I'm going for with
07:45 - this arena which is kind of an evening
07:49 - look where the Sun is setting or rising
07:53 - of course and yeah so I want to find
07:57 - something that looks a bit like that and
07:59 - if you do too then go to the asset store
08:03 - and search for skybox and again you find
08:05 - the asset store by going to window and
08:07 - then opening up the asset store it's
08:11 - something here cannot find anything
08:13 - today so we have the asset store right
08:18 - there ok so tunnel vision and search for
08:22 - sky box and hit free only and you
08:24 - actually get a bunch of very high
08:26 - quality sky boxes that you can use in
08:28 - your game and I really like the one
08:29 - called cope here the free skybox pack so
08:33 - if we go ahead and hit import on this
08:34 - that's a really nice guy box in here
08:37 - called sunset which is pretty much
08:39 - perfect for what for the look that I'm
08:41 - going for so let's go ahead and hit
08:43 - import on that and it's just going to
08:46 - import all of the textures and the
08:49 - materials that it set up and it
08:50 - shouldn't take long it's already done
08:52 - here and I'm
08:53 - is going to call this skyboxes there we
08:56 - go and this is again of course free so
08:59 - you can download it as well or find some
09:01 - other pack that suits you and then we'll
09:03 - go under your lighting and we'll change
09:04 - the default skybox to instead be sunset
09:08 - okay so this kind of this very much
09:11 - changes the look of our scene but I
09:13 - think this skybox is absolutely
09:15 - beautiful so that's what we are going to
09:17 - be using and I want to boost the ambient
09:20 - intensity of the light by something like
09:22 - two maybe even two point three I really
09:25 - want that to be very bright by default I
09:29 - think that gives it a nice look in here
09:31 - and we'll also get some other lights in
09:33 - here as well of course so all the other
09:36 - settings I believe we can pretty much
09:38 - leave as is we might want to drag our
09:40 - Sun into the Sun slot right there and we
09:44 - can also find the skybox
09:46 - find the Sun set here and I think the
09:48 - skybox is amazing but it is a tiny bit
09:51 - too dark so what I like to do is go in
09:53 - here and simply bring up the exposure to
09:55 - something like 1.2 and then we'll just
09:58 - boost the overall brightness of the
10:00 - skybox a tiny bit cool I think it's time
10:05 - to mess around with the light but let's
10:07 - see what I have planned here so now it's
10:09 - time to set up lighting and when it
10:12 - comes to lighting I think it's great to
10:14 - start with a cool directional light we
10:16 - already have that in here and I
10:19 - basically want to rotate this to
10:20 - something like 11 negative 108 and 20
10:26 - and I believe that should rotate it to
10:28 - kind of point to what the Sun in our
10:33 - skybox it's actually a bit off so we can
10:35 - just go ahead and rotate it a tiny bit
10:37 - there just so it points in the general
10:39 - direction and the general direction off
10:43 - on the Sun from our skybox I believe
10:46 - that gives the greatest look and you can
10:48 - see the kind of the sun shining in on
10:51 - just part of the arena here and that
10:53 - gives a very cool feel to it so I will
10:55 - also edit the color here and I've
10:57 - actually prepared a color that I think
10:59 - works nice with the scene kind of an
11:01 - evening color here but you can choose
11:02 - your own or just copy the hex color from
11:05 - down here
11:06 - I want the intensity to be somewhere
11:08 - like 1.3 so it is kind of bright but
11:13 - still you can see that it's it's
11:14 - disappearing between the hills and I
11:17 - definitely want soft shadows to be on I
11:19 - think that gives a very nice look for
11:21 - the directional light but you might want
11:23 - to not have that on some of the point
11:25 - lights that will be adding later so that
11:27 - was all for the Sun what I also want to
11:30 - do is kind of have a central light in
11:32 - the middle of the arena maybe up towards
11:36 - the ceiling here and you can see that
11:40 - nice glowing effect that we have on this
11:42 - that kind of just gives the arena some
11:45 - indoor mood light so that's um
11:48 - right-click go light and point light and
11:53 - let's set this up so I want this to be
11:55 - at a y-value of something like two point
11:58 - six five maybe something like that just
12:01 - in the middle of the arena I want the
12:04 - range to be something like 25 the color
12:07 - and I've prepared a color again here
12:10 - just so we don't spend too long trying
12:12 - to get that right you can see it just
12:14 - gives this very nice warm feel almost as
12:16 - if it was coming from this sign up here
12:19 - that's kind of the point you can maybe
12:21 - just raise it a tiny bit and I want the
12:24 - intensity I think to pretty much just be
12:27 - one however to make this effect really
12:30 - nice what I will do is I will go ahead
12:32 - and enable hot cast shadows and this
12:36 - will of course take some performance if
12:38 - you're making this game for a mobile
12:40 - application you probably don't want to
12:42 - have hard shadows on your point lights
12:44 - or at least you want to be careful with
12:46 - how many you have but on a stationary
12:50 - computer or a modern laptop this should
12:53 - not be a problem whatsoever so I just
12:55 - think it really gives a nice feel you
12:57 - can see all of the bars here shining
13:00 - onto the chairs that looks kind of cool
13:04 - you can see what that does to the
13:08 - environment good so yep that all looks
13:14 - nice and we can go in here and just make
13:15 - sure lighting data set was build with an
13:18 - in yeah we can now get that rid of the
13:20 - by removing the auto here and going
13:22 - clear big data and then choosing Auto
13:26 - again and it's going to auto bake the
13:27 - light map now so that's perfect and
13:31 - where do we want to go from now well I
13:33 - definitely want to have some more light
13:35 - in here but I want to have some flames
13:37 - under the obstacles here some cool flame
13:39 - particles and we'll have them light up
13:42 - the arena as well and we'll have them be
13:45 - animated so that they vary in intensity
13:48 - that's a really nice feel so we'll call
13:50 - this the arena center light and we could
13:55 - make this part of the prefab but I'll
13:56 - just keep it out of it for now just so
14:00 - we preserve the original prefab I don't
14:02 - know it just feels better so let's start
14:05 - by doing that as well okay so the next
14:09 - thing on our list here is setting up the
14:12 - flying platforms because at the moment
14:14 - they look at tiny bit boring so again I
14:18 - want to create these huge flames from
14:20 - underneath and we will of course defy
14:23 - physics on this one but I think it's
14:25 - okay because we do have fighting robots
14:27 - in what looks to be a clash between a
14:30 - sci-fi and a Roman Stadium so it's not
14:34 - really realism we're going for it
14:35 - anyways so let's go in here and let's
14:38 - find a cool particle effect to work off
14:43 - of and it's just so happens that unity
14:45 - standard acids include some very cool
14:47 - particle effects especially almost there
14:50 - flames that look really nice and that
14:53 - are very easy to edit so let's just use
14:56 - that as a base for what we're going to
14:58 - be making so but I just noticed that we
15:01 - have a bunch of scripts down here
15:03 - cluttering everything so I'll just take
15:05 - all the scripts into the scripts folder
15:06 - and the room list item into the prefabs
15:09 - just to clean this up a bit because we
15:10 - are we do have a lot of stuff in here
15:13 - and I also have a main level 1 folder I
15:15 - don't know why it's there but we should
15:16 - definitely delete it okay so I know
15:20 - standard assets particle systems and
15:23 - then prefabs you should see a fire
15:26 - complex prefab and that's what I want to
15:29 - use again if you don't have this simply
15:31 - run
15:32 - I click in the project panel go import
15:35 - package and then particle systems and
15:36 - you can make sure that it's imported
15:38 - there but for now we are just going to
15:40 - whoops not prefabs be using it here and
15:43 - let's take it and drag it into the scene
15:46 - and let's find it here let's reset that
15:49 - in the inspector and yep so that's cool
15:54 - and we can delete this script here that
15:56 - is currently missing we don't need that
15:58 - and I don't think we need to multiply
15:59 - this I actually like the default look so
16:02 - that's fine and you can go ahead and
16:04 - select the different particle systems to
16:06 - see them playing or we could just go
16:08 - ahead and hit the play button kind of to
16:10 - see what this file looks like and you
16:12 - can see it has this really nice
16:14 - realistic look where the light is
16:16 - animated in such a way that's actually
16:18 - done using a script that it both varies
16:21 - in intensity and moves around to give a
16:23 - very cool looking a lively fire effect
16:28 - so what we are going to do here is first
16:31 - off we are going to boost the range of
16:33 - this light to something like 10 and I
16:36 - don't think we need to edit the color or
16:39 - the intensity so we'll just leave those
16:42 - as is and then we can um what we
16:46 - basically want to do is we want to flip
16:48 - this effect on its head because we
16:51 - wanted to appear that the fire is coming
16:54 - from beneath these obstacles so let's go
16:57 - ahead and bring this over to one of the
16:59 - obstacles and we can do that by dragging
17:02 - it under one of the flying platforms and
17:04 - then resetting the transform once again
17:07 - so you can see now it's centered on
17:08 - there and we can maybe move this down a
17:11 - bit and we'll just drag it actually
17:15 - let's just have it be part of the
17:16 - platform for now that's fine so we'll
17:18 - bring it to the very bottom of on the
17:23 - platform and then we'll go and look at
17:26 - on the different effects so when it
17:29 - comes to the light actually let's move
17:32 - the whole thing down so that we assure
17:33 - that when the light moves it doesn't go
17:35 - up into the actual platform and then we
17:38 - can move all of the other effects up as
17:40 - we want to so this actual fire effect
17:43 - almost look looks perfect
17:46 - just as is I really like the glowing
17:48 - effect here and it's fine that it rises
17:52 - we can go ahead and just flip the
17:55 - direction on this actually I really like
17:59 - that so let's just have that be flipped
18:01 - and that's fine and then we can find our
18:06 - flames and these are the ones that we
18:08 - definitely need to edit so let's flip
18:09 - the direction on the 90 degrees there
18:12 - however you can sit still our goes
18:14 - upwards and that's because we need to
18:17 - flip it in here as well so the start
18:20 - rotation here let's make that a constant
18:22 - add on 90 a 180 degrees so you can see
18:27 - that flipped it on its head and now we
18:28 - just need to move it down and also we
18:31 - need to remove the gravity modifier so
18:34 - that it stays in place and now we can
18:38 - move it up so that it fits something
18:41 - like that looks pretty nice I don't want
18:43 - any clipping to occur so just move it
18:45 - below so don't doesn't clip into the
18:48 - platform and I think this looks really
18:50 - great as always spend more time on this
18:53 - than I do please to make it look just
18:57 - right but I don't have infinite time
18:59 - when it comes to modifying this stuff we
19:02 - do need to get on with the tutorial so
19:04 - let's select the eye darksmoke here and
19:07 - that's kind of a crazy effect we have
19:09 - going on here and I actually really like
19:11 - it as is but I think we should maybe
19:13 - move it down a bit just a tad and we'll
19:19 - maybe see the start road and the
19:21 - rotation is actually kind of nice if we
19:24 - flip that 90 degrees I'll go crazy but I
19:28 - actually like that I think it's pretty
19:30 - good what we can also do is go into the
19:33 - force over lifetime and make it not rise
19:35 - up as quickly so bump the Y value down
19:38 - nope I want that to stay but we can
19:41 - maybe do a negative one here I don't
19:45 - want it to just go right on through our
19:48 - surface
19:50 - okay I think we'll keep the original
19:52 - value then it's probably better and then
19:56 - we can take the C value here Z value and
19:59 - bump it down to 0.5 so it doesn't look
20:02 - as crazy
20:03 - I actually kind of like that and we can
20:05 - take the emission and run that down as
20:07 - well so it isn't as crazy something like
20:09 - that looks really nice and we do need to
20:11 - do the same thing with the lit smoke
20:13 - that's this one we can pretty much do
20:17 - that by I think we might be able to just
20:20 - rotate it ah so now it just goes
20:25 - straight up and then we want to rotate
20:27 - it on the whatever here so that's just
20:32 - rotated manually so it follows the other
20:35 - smoke here I think that looks pretty
20:38 - great actually and we can add a okay
20:42 - we'll just use the force of a lifetime
20:44 - and I'll just remove the C value see
20:47 - what that does actually really like that
20:49 - so it there is some wind to it I think
20:52 - that looks kind of cool
20:54 - we'll just keep that in there we can
20:56 - maybe move it over a bit there okay so
21:00 - again spend more time but for now we'll
21:02 - be happy with this maybe move it down a
21:05 - bit as well actually it's more the dark
21:10 - smoke that we need to move down
21:12 - something like that okay cool so we're
21:15 - happy with that and then we'll find the
21:18 - sparks falling here and we want to
21:21 - rotate those as well to just point
21:23 - straight down so I'll just do a zero on
21:25 - the x-axis there and I really like the
21:29 - feel of these however I want them to go
21:31 - slower so let's do something like point
21:34 - point two on the gravity modifier I
21:38 - think that looks really really cool and
21:40 - the sparks rising we don't want them to
21:44 - go straight through but I definitely
21:45 - want to have some sparks rising so what
21:47 - we'll do is we'll add some kind of maybe
21:51 - we'll just flip those somehow change the
21:59 - start speed here to be a constant we can
22:02 - add some speed to those
22:05 - something like that and we can do
22:06 - negative 90 to make them follow our
22:09 - smoke and so it will really appear that
22:13 - the wind is blowing here so I actually
22:15 - really like that however I think it's
22:18 - too much when it comes to the emission
22:20 - so you can go in here and change the
22:22 - curve or we could just on change let's
22:28 - see here that's actually going here and
22:30 - find the curve of this come on on time
22:37 - for some reason it doesn't want to open
22:41 - up my curve editor here that's kind of
22:44 - annoying that's okay what we can do
22:47 - instead is we can simply bump down the
22:49 - color here so we can lessen the Alpha a
22:53 - little bit and I think this will give
22:57 - kind of the effect that we are going for
22:59 - something like that just to not make it
23:02 - as apparent okay I really like that I
23:05 - think that works just fine and again
23:07 - play more around with it
23:09 - now we can take this fire complex and we
23:11 - can duplicate it a bunch of times and
23:13 - move it over to the other platforms as
23:15 - well so I'm just going to snap to the
23:19 - top view here shift to on or auto
23:21 - graphic and move that over there I
23:25 - believe that's flying platform - no
23:28 - that's actually that one over there so
23:29 - we'll move that over there duplicated -
23:33 - flying platform 3 that's that one so
23:35 - let's move it over there as well I'm
23:38 - doing it this way so that we can
23:39 - preserve the Y positioning and that over
23:42 - to platform 4 which is hopefully that
23:45 - one over there that's perfect
23:47 - coal and the naming here pretty much
23:51 - doesn't matter so we'll have all of
23:53 - those in there and now when we should
23:55 - switch back into our perspective mode
23:58 - and hit play this looks super cool so I
24:05 - really like the effect that we have
24:06 - going here I really like how it's it's
24:09 - very clear with the wind and all of that
24:13 - good so we can save that and on the next
24:16 - thing on
24:17 - list is dust particles are oh actually I
24:22 - wanted to create a hover animation I
24:23 - think you should go ahead and do this
24:25 - yourself because we will run out of time
24:27 - if I need to go in and do this but it is
24:30 - as basic as finding our animation window
24:34 - right here and then adding a new
24:37 - animation clip and simply animating
24:39 - these platforms on the why it's not too
24:42 - difficult it should definitely be doable
24:44 - and what I also do is I'll shift these a
24:47 - bit in height I think that will look
24:49 - cool if we just have them be random
24:53 - Heights here so something like that that
24:55 - looks better okay and then have them
24:59 - hover up and down that would be just to
25:01 - be awesome and your of course stuff
25:03 - definitely free to add obstacles in here
25:06 - I've purposefully made this a very open
25:09 - arena with not a lot of stuff in it so
25:12 - you can go go crazy with um with
25:15 - designing the gameplay on your own yeah
25:20 - so some test particles and these are
25:22 - very easy to add as well let's find the
25:24 - dust storm prefab again under the
25:26 - standard acid particle systems simply
25:29 - drag that in here and I think this is a
25:31 - prefab that looks very cool just right
25:33 - off the bat we'll just change a few
25:35 - settings so it isn't as large so I will
25:38 - find the shape here and make that
25:39 - something like 40 by 40 or 40 by maybe
25:44 - five by 40 that's 50 40 and let's see
25:50 - just in which direction we made our
25:54 - flames blow in the air here so let's see
26:02 - where was it there so let's find our
26:05 - smoke and our sparks there okay so it
26:10 - went in this direction here so I
26:12 - definitely want our particles to go in
26:16 - the same direction and right now I
26:18 - believe yeah they're going in the pretty
26:21 - much opposite direction so let's do a
26:23 - knot on the X let's do this on the Y of
26:26 - 180 on that and maybe just correct it a
26:29 - tiny bit
26:30 - something like that looks a lot better
26:32 - we can also move it over and let's bump
26:35 - down the admission on this to something
26:37 - like forty maybe let's go back into the
26:40 - arena see what it looks like in here I
26:43 - think it gives a really nice feel
26:44 - however I don't want this to affect the
26:46 - gameplay so we'll just drag it up over
26:49 - the game actual gameplay area or over
26:51 - above the ground at least so that down
26:54 - here you won't be affected by the dust
26:56 - underneath if you look up it becomes
26:59 - very clear that that is definitely a
27:01 - thing so I think that looks pretty cool
27:03 - and I just want to change the color of
27:06 - this to tinned it a tiny bit orange ah
27:11 - there and in here there we go
27:16 - I think that looks really really awesome
27:18 - so we'll just keep that in there and
27:21 - have that playing all the time and we
27:25 - also want to check pre won't run
27:28 - pre-warm on that so that it is going
27:32 - just when we play the game and the next
27:35 - thing on our list and this is a crazy
27:37 - list I'm just going to have a sip of
27:39 - water our image effects hmm and you can
27:45 - pretty much go completely crazy with
27:47 - image effects you can add a color
27:50 - correction you can add a vignette you
27:52 - can add chromatic aberration now all
27:55 - kinds of stuff but I'm just going to add
27:57 - what I think are the two most essential
28:00 - image effects for making your game look
28:03 - a lot cooler without the user thinking
28:06 - wow this is edited this almost looks
28:09 - like he went into Photoshop and play
28:12 - around with all the colors without it
28:14 - being too distracting and unity of
28:17 - course again has some nice standard
28:19 - assets when it comes to this let's
28:20 - import them by going by right clicking
28:23 - import package and then going effects
28:27 - and it's going to process all them here
28:30 - that's it import and there are a bunch
28:32 - of different effects in here you can
28:34 - pretty much add effects all you want it
28:37 - has a really nice vignette and chromatic
28:40 - aberration if that's
28:42 - and the effect that you're going for and
28:44 - I'm just going to find my scene camera
28:47 - here and edit this and let's bring up
28:49 - the art game view so we can see this
28:51 - applied and the first thing that I want
28:53 - to add is screen space ambient occlusion
28:55 - and also called ssao
28:58 - and this is just a very nice image
29:01 - effect that fakes ambient occlusion by
29:05 - looking pretty much at what the screen
29:07 - is seeing so it's it's adding this into
29:10 - the render pod line instead of rendering
29:12 - it into a light map or baking it into a
29:15 - light map beforehand so it's it's adding
29:17 - it real time so therefore it is a bit of
29:20 - an expensive effect but I think it's so
29:22 - worth it when you when you see it so I'm
29:25 - just going to search for screen space
29:28 - ambient and you want occlusion not
29:30 - obscure in so occlusion here and you can
29:33 - see the nice shadows that this adds it
29:35 - adds shadows wherever to objects or
29:39 - surfaces meet and we definitely want to
29:42 - edit that this a bit we are going to
29:46 - bump down the radius to something a lot
29:50 - smaller here something like um I don't
29:55 - know there looks pretty good
29:57 - the occlusion attends intensity I think
29:59 - is fine it is a pretty high intensity
30:02 - but that's alright so let's just have it
30:05 - be some something like that looks pretty
30:07 - nice and you can of course see it in the
30:09 - scene view so let's just cover this
30:12 - component and add it to a player camera
30:15 - as well so paste the component that's
30:17 - new there and on the player will also
30:19 - add a motion blur and we want that
30:22 - called the one called camera motion blur
30:25 - and I really like the default settings
30:28 - on this one so when we hit play now and
30:30 - jump in here with our character and I
30:34 - think this is the first time we're
30:35 - moving around you can see that we have
30:37 - this these cool shadows and we have the
30:41 - nice effects I actually think the dust
30:43 - storm is just a bit too much and
30:46 - everything else looks really nice and
30:49 - you can see that we can hit everything
30:51 - we can fly past this grid and we are
30:55 - able to fly
30:56 - on top of obstacles so let's let's just
30:58 - try that real quick and you can see
31:00 - there and I was able to fly on top of it
31:02 - even though I kind of failed at it
31:04 - so you can see if we can stand on top of
31:06 - this and everything looks cold so I'm
31:10 - actually really happy with that so we'll
31:12 - keep that I will just go in here and
31:14 - bump the emission on the dust storm down
31:16 - to something like thirty and maybe bring
31:21 - the color down just a bit on the Alpha
31:24 - here you can do that something like that
31:27 - I think that's better we can also take
31:30 - it find it in in our scene here on a
31:34 - dust storm and maybe move it up even a
31:36 - bit more here just so it's an effect to
31:40 - see when we look up and that's perfect
31:43 - and let's go back here and the last
31:45 - thing that we want to do is just set a
31:47 - couple of spawn points inside of our
31:48 - arena that make sense
31:49 - so let's find our first spawn point here
31:52 - that's currently right here and I
31:54 - actually think that that's a fine place
31:56 - for us to spawn but I just want to let's
32:01 - see Center it on the X there and
32:04 - everything else looks fine the second
32:07 - spawn point is over here that's fine as
32:11 - well oops that is centered on the X and
32:16 - we can just move it over here cool and I
32:19 - just want to create a couple more I want
32:22 - to create spawn point three here
32:25 - alright let's actually move this on top
32:28 - of one of the platforms let's Center it
32:31 - out in this on the platform there that
32:34 - looks good let's move it over drag it on
32:38 - top there we go I think that looks
32:41 - really nice and the fourth one here will
32:47 - just position add a nother part of the
32:50 - map just to make it or to confuse the
32:53 - players so they aren't able to just camp
32:57 - one spawn point that would be annoying
32:59 - especially when the map is this small
33:01 - and what you want to do is of course add
33:03 - some obstacles in here to duck behind
33:05 - and maybe have some of the spawn points
33:07 - be behind those obstacles
33:09 - so the
33:09 - so that the players aren't shut
33:11 - immediately after they spawn but I think
33:14 - that will be just fine and I believe
33:17 - that the way that we have said it set up
33:19 - here is that um it will automatically
33:22 - include include those two that we just
33:24 - added so that was the entire list I hope
33:28 - you were able to follow me in all of
33:31 - this stuff I really think on the prod or
33:33 - er the final arena here looks super cool
33:39 - and you should definitely play around
33:41 - with it it's again completely free for
33:43 - you to use so yep that's pretty much it
33:47 - thank you so much to some mean iben for
33:51 - creating this arena
33:53 - it's a amazing job if you want to order
33:57 - on other your arm models he does do
34:00 - client work his are not expensive and he
34:04 - is very kind so I definitely recommend
34:07 - him he's my go-to modeler and without
34:10 - further ado thanks for watching and I'll
34:13 - see you in the next video thank you so
34:15 - much to all of the awesome patreon
34:17 - supporters who donated in July and a
34:19 - special thanks to vixen Minnesota and UK
34:22 - and Lux game TV these videos wouldn't be
34:25 - possible without you
