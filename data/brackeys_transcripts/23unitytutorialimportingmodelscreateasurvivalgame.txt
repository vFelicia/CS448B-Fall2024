00:02 - hello one number come to the 23rd
00:06 - tutorial in our survival game series in
00:08 - this one we are going to be taking a
00:10 - look at expanding our level so importing
00:14 - a lot of different models and assets and
00:18 - taking a look at how the the game will
00:21 - actually look and so I haven't figured
00:24 - out the title for this video yet but
00:26 - that's what we are going to do so
00:29 - everything we're going to be using in
00:31 - this video was made by a guy named Sam
00:35 - mean if I'm pronouncing that correctly
00:37 - really cool dude so I recommend you look
00:42 - him up if you're looking for any kind of
00:44 - nice and free assets on their Facebook
00:47 - page called 7 xf studios um if you're
00:52 - going to type in the URL and so you can
00:55 - see that he makes really cool looking
00:58 - models for example this one and if we
01:01 - just scroll up you can see that you can
01:03 - just type 7 xf space games so credit to
01:07 - him and especially considering how young
01:10 - he is I've also been told that he will
01:13 - model of things really cheap anyways
01:17 - moving on the tutorial that was the
01:19 - crediting shoutout pads now we are going
01:22 - to get actually actually get on with it
01:24 - so let's open up the survival asset pack
01:27 - which you will need for this unless
01:29 - you're going to be using your own models
01:31 - and then go to the import section and
01:34 - you can see that I have cleaned things
01:37 - up a bit the one we are going to be
01:39 - focusing on today is the start area so
01:42 - that's what we are going to be making so
01:45 - you can just go ahead and double click
01:46 - on that to see the different models
01:49 - organized in folders and so here is a
01:54 - really well done drawing of how the
01:57 - level will kind of look so keep in mind
02:01 - that I have trained a lot to make this
02:04 - drawing really um but anyway so I hope
02:10 - you're enjoying the skills here but on
02:12 - this
02:13 - how it's going to look so basically
02:15 - we're going to have the spawn here with
02:17 - like it's going to be like a basic camp
02:19 - so we're going to have a tent a make
02:22 - campfire and it's going to lead down
02:25 - with a road is going to lead down to the
02:28 - gate which is going to allow the plate
02:32 - to move on to the next area and that
02:34 - that's not something we're going to be
02:36 - creating today we have plenty of things
02:38 - that's neaten that needs to be done here
02:40 - and keep in mind this is just thoughts
02:43 - so we might not include everything but
02:46 - I'm thinking that over here we are going
02:47 - to have some like basic enemies to get
02:50 - the players started maybe we're going to
02:53 - make a quest system of some sort and
02:56 - then the hardened enemies are going to
02:58 - be down by the gate so that the player
03:01 - will have to level up before he can
03:03 - advance and so we have a river that runs
03:05 - through and maybe some kind of bus or
03:08 - hard map over here which will drop
03:11 - something on more valuable to the play
03:15 - and then we have a dungeon if we decide
03:18 - to go into a dungeon system at some
03:20 - point we'll see but that's just so you
03:23 - have an idea of what we're going to be
03:24 - making and this video will probably be
03:27 - split up into several parts but let's
03:31 - see about that so since this is a this
03:35 - is not perfectly square I have split it
03:39 - up into two squares so we're going to be
03:41 - making this terrain first and then
03:42 - focusing on this over here and that's
03:46 - because if you stretch out the terrain
03:47 - in unity by changing the resolution
03:51 - everything your paint will be stretched
03:53 - too and so things will start looking
03:55 - really weird so this is just a reference
03:58 - and now moving on again so the first
04:02 - thing we're going to be implementing is
04:05 - the camp fire so this run i really like
04:08 - and so if we go ahead and click into a
04:11 - camp fire folder we have two textures we
04:15 - have for the stone base and the actual
04:17 - locks of wood so that the to diffuse
04:21 - textures I'll actually just go ahead and
04:23 - rename that so
04:25 - we don't have the underscores just like
04:29 - it that way and then we have the
04:31 - campfire plenary file is so if you're
04:34 - using blender I recommend you just
04:35 - import using that and then we have the
04:37 - campfire FBX if you're not a blender
04:40 - user so you can just use that I'm going
04:44 - to export input this with blender if you
04:46 - don't have blender again I recommend you
04:48 - to just download it its usual it's very
04:51 - useful to have so dragged as always I've
04:55 - opened up unity and actually before we
04:59 - go ahead and drag it in let's just make
05:01 - sure that we can see things a little bit
05:03 - better because now this is set to night
05:06 - by default because of our time of day
05:08 - and so I think we should change that
05:10 - default value to be daylight so click on
05:15 - our target time of day and I'll also set
05:17 - down the speed so something like 600 and
05:21 - then we can go under that to our Sun so
05:25 - the Sun there and make sure this is set
05:28 - to pivot up in the corner it not century
05:31 - because then we're going to be rotating
05:33 - and shading around the moon so set that
05:36 - to pivot and then we can just make sure
05:38 - that the Sun is at a bit of an angle so
05:42 - it looks cool maybe even have the Sun
05:47 - come on so something like that and like
05:51 - that looks really good and we can also
05:54 - go ahead and change the time of day
05:57 - amount so this slider value here what it
06:00 - starts out with we can change that to
06:02 - something like 0.4 so now when we play
06:06 - the game you can see that it's daytime
06:11 - right when we played I'm actually going
06:14 - to do 0.3 instead and see if this is
06:18 - better yeah so like we have the Sun
06:21 - rising Ladouceur 0.35 so cool so now
06:28 - that we have a a pretty basic setting
06:30 - for that we can move on with the
06:32 - tutorial so undo our imports
06:37 - there we are going to just quickly
06:39 - organize this as it is organized in our
06:43 - imports in the assets pack so we are
06:47 - going to split this up into several
06:48 - folders so create a new folder call this
06:51 - weapons dragged in the yeah actually
06:58 - let's split this up too so create a new
07:00 - folder and then make this a sword have
07:05 - the sword and the sword texture and drag
07:07 - them in their new folder mace drag the
07:14 - mace and the UV text under there and
07:17 - then drag this these two folders to the
07:20 - weapons folders under the weapons folder
07:23 - so and let's then make one for the doors
07:27 - so folder door and yeah just go ahead
07:32 - and drag that in there perfect so now
07:35 - let's create actually let's not create
07:38 - the start area folder yet let's just
07:41 - experiment with it there so we don't
07:43 - have to like navigate a million of
07:45 - folders now go under the campfire fold
07:48 - again I know this is just a lot of
07:50 - browsing around but that's just how it
07:52 - is when you're making level design and
07:54 - again this tutorial is made because it
07:57 - has been requested so many times by you
07:59 - guys so let's take the campfire the
08:04 - large diffuse and the stone base diffuse
08:07 - and just drag them into unity under the
08:10 - imports folder you can see it importing
08:12 - and that we have it so we can take the
08:16 - campfire just maybe take a quick look at
08:20 - some of the settings here so we have the
08:24 - scale factory set to zero point to set
08:29 - one that might be good materials we want
08:33 - to import them normals import calculate
08:35 - we have no Rick so going to Rick and say
08:38 - none and hit apply to that and then to
08:43 - the mate animations
08:44 - uncheck import animation and so we
08:48 - should be good to go so if we just zoom
08:50 - in
08:51 - I'll play you here so you can get closer
08:53 - to the center of I scene then we can
08:57 - just take the campfire and drag it in
09:00 - there and I don't know about the scale
09:04 - yet it doesn't seem too bad but let's
09:07 - actually go ahead and now implement our
09:11 - textures on there so under the campfire
09:14 - you can see it has two objects a
09:16 - cylinder and is cylinder and the first
09:20 - one we're just going to rename to
09:23 - campfire locks and the other one is
09:28 - going to be campfire base and select the
09:35 - locks drag on the locks defuse and
09:38 - change the main color to completely
09:40 - white then do the same with the campfire
09:44 - base drag on the campfire the stone base
09:47 - diffuse and change it to completely
09:49 - white and now we can see that we have a
09:52 - nice looking fireplace so let's just
09:56 - drag it in there so we have it standing
10:00 - there and also let's go ahead and
10:02 - disable this these house walls since
10:05 - we're not really going to be using them
10:07 - for now and also the lamp if I can find
10:11 - it there so disable that so now it just
10:14 - looks a lot cleaner and let's take the
10:17 - house piece too and disable that and
10:19 - this one the test plate we can just go
10:22 - ahead and delete that so move our
10:25 - players so select our player and watch
10:27 - out whenever you select the player don't
10:30 - just click on him because then it will
10:32 - only select the graphics so when we
10:34 - start moving him the the other parts of
10:37 - the player will stay so so they'll
10:39 - select the entire play then drag him
10:42 - down and then drag him over to where you
10:46 - want him to be so let's see how this
10:48 - looks in game so at play and yeah the
10:52 - shading and the size is nice it might be
10:55 - a little too big so we can just select
10:57 - it in the scene at f/2 Center on it and
11:01 - then you should just be able to scale it
11:03 - down without moving
11:04 - because the anger point is set to pivot
11:07 - so something like that that might be too
11:10 - small actually not too bad maybe up a
11:17 - little bit so but again that's something
11:20 - you can set and decide for completely on
11:24 - your own you could also go ahead and
11:25 - drag this in to make it a prefab but I'm
11:27 - just going to make it let it be for now
11:29 - now let's create a new folder in our
11:31 - imports and call this fire place or
11:36 - campfire so stick to that and then
11:40 - select the model and the two textures
11:43 - and drag them in alright so moving on go
11:48 - to the start area folder in our survival
11:51 - assets and now let's go and find the one
11:55 - that says maybe ten Drake will go with
11:59 - that and if I just compare open this up
12:04 - in blender you can see what we have
12:05 - going on here so this is not an actual
12:08 - tent this is just the rake of it so like
12:11 - we have the different poles going across
12:14 - and such so this is just the skeleton
12:17 - and then we're going to be adding the
12:19 - cloth of this tent later on and I just
12:23 - thought I wanted to close it off these
12:25 - end pieces but you can go ahead and
12:28 - delete them that's why I've made them a
12:30 - separate object so let's just go ahead
12:34 - and select the ten Drake and the ten
12:36 - Drake diffuse and drag them into unity
12:39 - and unity will start importing now let's
12:43 - lend it select the ten Drake scale facts
12:46 - are set to one just looking good so
12:49 - let's go on to Rick say like none apply
12:53 - repeating myself go to animation uncheck
12:56 - import animation hit apply and there we
13:01 - have it so we can just go ahead and drag
13:02 - that in also and this size doesn't seem
13:06 - too bad I have hit F to focus on it and
13:10 - then let's expand this and I can see
13:15 - that this cylinder
13:18 - right here I think we can just go ahead
13:20 - and delete that yeah that's just an
13:23 - empty game object so the cylinder
13:26 - 0:03 you can just delete that that was
13:29 - just made for making it easier to model
13:32 - then we can have select the planes here
13:35 - drag on the ten drag the fierce change
13:38 - it to white and so now we should the
13:43 - share material
13:44 - which means that whenever each we change
13:46 - these plates it will also change the
13:51 - cylinders here so I'll just go ahead and
13:55 - delete the planes but that's completely
13:57 - up to you
13:58 - again so in another video we are going
14:01 - to be adding cloth to simulate the
14:04 - effects here so that we can complete our
14:08 - tent but for now we're just going to
14:09 - leave the rig so like that and that's
14:13 - actually rename the cylinder here to
14:17 - skeleton suite now let's move on so
14:24 - right click create folder and call this
14:27 - tent and then just select the ten rig
14:32 - and the ten Drake diffuse and drag it on
14:34 - the tent so save and let's go back and
14:39 - see what we can implement else so we
14:42 - have some stones which we could spread
14:45 - out we also have a street lamp so let's
14:48 - go ahead and maybe play around with that
14:50 - so go under the street lamp folder
14:52 - select the blend file select the street
14:56 - lamp cover diffuse the street lamp and
14:59 - the street lamp class diffuse now drag
15:05 - those into unity it will start importing
15:09 - select the street lamp model uncheck
15:13 - import animation wise they even
15:16 - animation I don't know and check that
15:19 - apply Rick none and we should be good to
15:24 - go subtract that in and this is maybe to
15:28 - back let's see if we just
15:31 - go over to that for me it seems to be
15:35 - way too back so we can just go ahead and
15:37 - either select it in the project pane and
15:41 - scale it down so change the scale factor
15:43 - or scale it down in in-game let's set
15:47 - try to set the scale factor to 0.5 and
15:50 - see how this looks this looks better to
15:55 - me and then we can maybe adjust the rest
15:57 - in games to make it a little bigger than
15:59 - that I don't want this to be like a big
16:02 - really big pole this looks pretty good
16:06 - and remember right now none of these
16:09 - models have actual texture or actual
16:12 - Collider is attached so you can just
16:14 - walk right through but we are going to
16:17 - add that later so now we can select the
16:21 - streetlamp go to the first cube and call
16:25 - this street lamp base so like this one
16:34 - and call this street lamp cover and I
16:43 - can see I'm missing eighty or so correct
16:46 - that and then select the cube zero zero
16:48 - one and actually that's the street lamp
16:51 - cover so we'll make change this just
16:54 - read lamp glass and then have the cube
16:58 - zero zero one be a street lamp cover so
17:08 - select the base and change the color to
17:11 - completely white drag on the street lamp
17:14 - diffuse select the cover change it to
17:18 - completely white drag on the street lamp
17:21 - cover and the straight length right a
17:24 - glass completely white and drag on the
17:27 - according texture so now we should see a
17:31 - nice-looking lamp here I of course you
17:36 - can always go ahead and play around with
17:37 - the settings for example I recommend
17:39 - that under the street lamp glass you
17:42 - change this from diffuse to something
17:44 - like on
17:45 - lid to make it look like it's actually
17:48 - glowing or maybe even self-illuminated
17:53 - diffuse that looks even better to me so
17:59 - that's really how this should look then
18:02 - let's go ahead and maybe add a add a
18:07 - light to this so you can go into unity
18:10 - and add a unity light so go on the game
18:13 - object create other and then point light
18:17 - drag it under our glass and then zero
18:22 - out the position so it now it should
18:24 - snap to the glass it doesn't snap
18:28 - exactly so let's move it over a bit to
18:33 - make sure it's inside and you can see
18:39 - the light coming onto the ground will
18:42 - change the color of the light to
18:44 - something a little bit more yellow just
18:48 - a tint and yeah this looks good maybe
18:52 - change the radius bump that up a bit and
18:55 - then the intensity a bit down so that
18:57 - something like 0.5 and now when we go in
19:00 - game because we have let the slider be
19:05 - we can make this night and see how it
19:09 - lights things up I think that looks
19:12 - pretty cool I'll actually go ahead and
19:15 - bump up the intensity even more so stop
19:19 - playing and like and then make it set it
19:23 - back to one maybe so when we go to night
19:28 - fall yeah it really lights things up
19:31 - this looks good and of course you can
19:34 - add the halo effect and such which are
19:37 - showed in the tutorial showing how to
19:40 - make lamps glow so apply some of the
19:45 - different techniques this is really
19:47 - about playing around with things and
19:49 - making it how you want it to be and all
19:52 - of these models are feel free to use
19:55 - them both commercially and
19:56 - non-commercially so that means
19:59 - anyway so let's rename this to street
20:02 - lamp light and collapse that and
20:08 - collapse that let's make a new folder
20:11 - call this street lamp and drag on the
20:16 - street lamp the street lamp cover yeah
20:18 - all the textures and drag them on there
20:21 - sweet now let's go back into the start
20:25 - area and see if there's any more we
20:27 - would like to implement right now maybe
20:30 - we should have a look at the fence so
20:33 - here we can go under the blend file and
20:37 - you can see that there are many
20:40 - different as one so let's just rename
20:43 - this to blender actually and you can see
20:47 - that we both have the ordinary fence so
20:49 - this is straight one and we also have
20:51 - different curvy fences so that if you
20:54 - would like the fence to follow a road
20:56 - you could use these on so there are
20:59 - large curves and slight curves to either
21:01 - side and for now I'm just going to use
21:05 - the ordinary fence or what let's see
21:08 - actually we might try with some curvy
21:12 - ones to follow this round now we'll just
21:14 - go with the ordinary front fence so
21:17 - let's open it up to see how it looks and
21:19 - I can see the texture is acting a little
21:22 - weird but you get the idea so let's drag
21:24 - this into unity and then go back to the
21:32 - fence texture year so let's just rename
21:34 - this to fence diffuse and all these
21:38 - renaming and stuff will probably already
21:40 - be done when you get the pack so just
21:43 - drag that into and we can see that this
21:45 - is working so select defense go on the
21:48 - rig none apply animation uncheck import
21:54 - animation apply and then you can drag
21:58 - this in hit F to focus on it and this is
22:01 - just a single game object so go into
22:04 - defensive material make this completely
22:06 - wide and then drag in defense diffuse we
22:11 - can see that this is look
22:12 - really nice so and this is also made so
22:16 - that it tiles perfectly which means that
22:19 - if you want like a really long fence you
22:21 - can just go ahead and duplicate it by
22:23 - hitting ctrl D or command D if you're on
22:26 - a Mac and then just dragging it over
22:29 - holding the ctrl key to make it snap and
22:33 - so we can just do this out in infinity
22:37 - so that it will tile nicely and there
22:41 - might be some problems with the lighting
22:43 - but it shouldn't be something that's
22:45 - really really noticeable so yeah that's
22:50 - it and you can of course always open
22:53 - this up in blender and make it snap
22:54 - yourself and make it into one object
22:56 - because that is a little more efficient
23:00 - when it comes to and being and not being
23:03 - too harsh on the computer so it's really
23:06 - it's really easier for unity to
23:08 - calculate one object and stiff it
23:11 - instead of a row of them even though
23:13 - it's exactly the same result so you
23:16 - could go ahead and do that but to make
23:19 - it easy you're just going to go with
23:20 - this solution for now so let's drag this
23:24 - over and maybe rotate it a bit and so we
23:28 - can have it sitting there and right now
23:31 - I'm just trying to get all the assets
23:33 - down on the terrain to see to scale them
23:37 - properly and get all of the the textures
23:41 - in there and the property set and so we
23:43 - can later on start making a new looking
23:47 - terrain and I'll probably time-lapse
23:50 - that and talk a blip a bit about of how
23:53 - I would design the level and how these
23:55 - should be used so on let's go ahead and
23:58 - make a folder for these called fence
24:03 - actually let's just make this fences so
24:06 - we can have all of the other fences in
24:08 - there too and so and let's go ahead and
24:14 - hit play oops not what's in the scene
24:19 - view so in the game view hit play walk
24:22 - over to it and this is maybe a bit
24:26 - small no that's fine let's just leave it
24:29 - there the rest of the models are not
24:32 - some I'm going to be implementing right
24:34 - now they are really nice though we have
24:37 - some we have a boat and we have it's not
24:43 - there right now but I should also import
24:46 - the bridge we have a really nice looking
24:49 - Chinese bridge so that will all be
24:52 - implemented once we get the the borders
24:57 - set up so the river that will run across
24:59 - so I think in the next video what I'll
25:03 - be doing is I'm going to be time lapsing
25:05 - me creating some terrain and talking
25:08 - over how I went about it and then I'm
25:11 - going to slow down the parts well where
25:13 - I import the assets so that you can see
25:15 - exactly what I'm doing so cool now let's
25:19 - just get on with this tutorial so let's
25:21 - add some colliders so I'll save this and
25:25 - the fire for the fireplace is something
25:28 - we're also going to be creating in a
25:30 - upcoming tutorial so we have a lot of
25:32 - tutorials coming up on the visual side
25:34 - now let's select the streetlamp and add
25:38 - a cool idea for this so let's just I
25:43 - don't know how detailed we want this to
25:45 - be let's see if we can reach the actual
25:48 - lamp okay we can we can jump up there so
25:55 - let's make a series of colliders that
25:57 - will make sure we can't collide with it
25:59 - and to know more about how we could add
26:03 - colliders to this you can watch our
26:06 - tutorial on mastering collision okay so
26:10 - let's go ahead and hit a game object -
26:14 - create empty and let's call this street
26:18 - lamp colliders colliders plural and drag
26:27 - that onto the street lamp and let's send
26:30 - you out the position so it should be
26:33 - based right down here and now let's add
26:36 - add some more empty game object sir
26:40 - create MT and drag it on there there and
26:45 - street lamp collider zero one and so on
26:52 - you so you can just make a lot of
26:54 - colliders - so let's make this a box
26:57 - Collider and drag it over and scale it
27:01 - up and so you get the idea so this is
27:04 - really just about fitting the model as
27:07 - good as you can without exaggerating I
27:11 - like little detail that's really not
27:14 - necessary and it's also something that
27:16 - will make it harder for the computer to
27:20 - calculate so really more detail than
27:23 - this is not needed so let's make it
27:27 - longer like that and maybe a little
27:30 - bigger to fit the base here so let's
27:34 - make it a little wider there and that's
27:39 - actually looking good so let's go ahead
27:41 - and duplicate that rename this to C Row
27:43 - two and scale this differently so we can
27:47 - have it moved up a bit and for example
27:52 - here I'm not going to make the one that
27:53 - goes across instead I'm just going to
27:56 - move make one big Collider that will
28:00 - take care of this entire pod right here
28:04 - so like that and then make it a bit
28:07 - smaller on that side that will take care
28:11 - of most of most of the collision use so
28:14 - if we just drag this down a bit move it
28:18 - over like that and then maybe yeah let's
28:24 - go ahead and make a separate Collider
28:26 - for the lamp too and then hit the add
28:31 - component out yeah it's already advanced
28:33 - or we can just scale it down move it
28:36 - over down to the lamp and I think it
28:40 - fits nicely so now let's try and hit
28:45 - play run over to the post here so you
28:49 - can see that really collides nicely so I
28:53 - can
28:54 - up there at least it stops me from doing
28:57 - it and yeah that's detailed enough for
28:59 - me you can always go ahead and fill
29:02 - around with it even more and if you
29:05 - really want the coalition to be 100
29:07 - percent perfect which I really do not
29:09 - recommend is then you can add a
29:13 - component under physics called mesh
29:16 - Collider which will simply make a
29:18 - Collider that that follows the mesh so
29:22 - the greater the graphics but again that
29:25 - is very taxing and so now just quickly
29:31 - speed the video up here so I'll just
29:34 - leave you a bit while I make the
29:37 - colliders for the other models so see in
29:40 - a sec
30:02 - all right so I'm back and I hope you
30:05 - enjoyed the little spit-up footage part
30:07 - there so this is what I got working so
30:10 - if we click on the fence you can see
30:12 - I've just attached a box Collider
30:14 - directly and it looks pretty nice if we
30:18 - look over you on the streetlamp you got
30:21 - that already so the ten Drake
30:23 - I haven't attached any colliders here
30:25 - since we're going to be messing around
30:27 - with clasp cloth physics and so we're
30:30 - going to need a more advanced Collider
30:32 - structure there so we'll just leave that
30:34 - be and under the campfire we have a
30:37 - large box Collider and then a smaller
30:39 - one down here for the base and so when
30:42 - we hit play now you should see some
30:46 - pretty nice collision going on there and
30:49 - for the fence and for the lamp and so
30:58 - that is pretty much it guys so you hope
31:00 - you enjoyed the video and hopefully it
31:04 - wasn't too repetitive and in the next
31:07 - one we are probably going to be taking a
31:09 - look at advanced expanding that's rain
31:12 - and making use of these so we're going
31:15 - to get creative with that so uh that's
31:19 - basically it I hope you enjoyed the
31:20 - video and I'll see you in the next one
