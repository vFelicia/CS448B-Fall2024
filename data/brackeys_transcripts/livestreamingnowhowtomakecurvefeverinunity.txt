00:00 - no one just wanted to let you know that
00:02 - I will be live streaming in just a
00:04 - moment so if you want to see that head
00:05 - on over to twitch.tv / Brakiss and yeah
00:09 - i will be live in just a moment and what
00:11 - we will be making today is a replica of
00:14 - the very popular game called curve fever
00:16 - which is basically like a modern snake
00:18 - game so I'm just going to head on over
00:21 - into unity here and show you kind of
00:22 - what it is that we will be making and
00:24 - this is a two player game and you can
00:26 - see it's really just about avoiding of
00:29 - course hitting the tail of the other
00:30 - player or hitting the edge of the map or
00:33 - of course hitting your own tail and on
00:35 - the tail rendering part here is done
00:38 - using the unity line renderer which has
00:40 - seen some major improvements in unity
00:42 - 5.5 and that is currently out in beta so
00:45 - we'll be playing a bit around with the
00:46 - beta here and just checking some stuff
00:49 - out so I hope that you will join us
00:51 - there and without further ado I will see
00:53 - you in the next video
