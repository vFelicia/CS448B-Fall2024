00:00 - hey do you guys know what time it is
00:01 - that's right it's time to have a look at
00:04 - a new unity release unity two thousand
00:06 - eighteen point three is now in public
00:07 - beta and I definitely encourage you to
00:09 - check it out they'll of course be a link
00:11 - to where you can download it in the
00:12 - description also this video is sponsored
00:14 - by unity we've worked together to make
00:16 - sure we cover as much as possible now
00:18 - that's a lot to cover so let's get right
00:19 - to it here's what's new in unity 2000
00:21 - 18.3 so jumping right into it unity now
00:24 - supports isometric to detail maps for
00:27 - those of you who don't know what
00:28 - isometric means it's basically a
00:30 - different way of making perspective an
00:32 - isometric object has all three
00:34 - dimensions drawn at the same length
00:36 - rather than shortening them depending on
00:38 - the position of the observer this is an
00:40 - art style often used for both 3d and 2d
00:42 - games and can now be achieved pretty
00:45 - easily using the tom map system you
00:46 - simply create your art symmetric tiles
00:48 - and start painting with them and the
00:50 - talib renderer is capable of doing
00:52 - Portales sorting which opens up the
00:54 - possibility of having your character
00:56 - walk behind buildings trees or other
00:58 - objects moving on the new and improved
01:00 - prefab workflows will be part of 2018
01:03 - point 3
01:04 - I've been trying them out using a
01:05 - preview build and I must say that so far
01:08 - I'm in love with these tools if you're
01:10 - interested in learning how to use the
01:11 - new workflows we've covered them in a
01:13 - separate video
01:13 - which I definitely recommend you check
01:15 - out + unity also has some demos
01:17 - available on their website and this
01:19 - release unity has also added a new tool
01:21 - to their profiler
01:22 - memory profiling as the name suggests
01:24 - this tool makes it a lot easier to
01:26 - understand what's happening with memory
01:28 - in your game the current profiler
01:30 - already shows a summary of all
01:32 - allocations for an asset but the new
01:34 - memory profiler gives the possibility to
01:36 - break down each allocation which greatly
01:38 - helps optimize memory usage in other
01:40 - news unit is upgrading from Nvidia PhysX
01:43 - 3.3 to 3.4 the upgrade speeds up
01:46 - operations such as ray casting shape
01:48 - sweeping and mesh cooking to run up to
01:50 - twice as fast which is a lot it also
01:53 - improves support for detecting
01:55 - collisions with fast rotating objects
01:57 - and adds enhanced determinism also the
01:59 - default scripting run time is now dotnet
02:02 - for X Y net 3.5 runtime has been
02:05 - deprecated and support for it will soon
02:07 - be dropped on top of that projects that
02:09 - are targeting the dotnet 4x scripting
02:11 - runtime
02:12 - we'll also be able to use the
02:13 - open-source ruslan compiler this means
02:16 - that we get access to the latest C sharp
02:17 - seven point two language features and
02:20 - that compilation times will be reduced
02:22 - which is of course always very welcome
02:24 - unity 2018 point three also ships with
02:27 - an update to the terrain system I think
02:29 - the changes to the UI and the tools
02:30 - themselves are fairly minimal some of
02:32 - the painting modes and settings are
02:34 - organized a bit differently however
02:36 - I've heard that bigger changes are
02:37 - coming in version 2000 19.1 also this
02:40 - release does come with some really nice
02:42 - performance improvements as well support
02:44 - for these lightweight and HD render
02:46 - pipelines so definitely a step in the
02:47 - right direction here in terms of the
02:49 - navigation system navmesh is in prefabs
02:51 - can now be baked in isolation from
02:53 - within prefab mode and the navmesh curie
02:56 - raycast method can now be called in jobs
02:58 - if you want to trace a straight path
03:00 - between two positions on the navmesh mm
03:03 - 18.3 also features a number of
03:05 - improvements to the HD render pipeline
03:07 - one of the main ones for me is probably
03:09 - mesh decals which are just really handy
03:12 - and we have a new shader to play around
03:13 - with these stack with shader now I'm in
03:16 - no way a graphics engineer but just from
03:18 - playing around with it it seems very
03:20 - similar to this standard lit shader
03:22 - except it adds a bunch of more advanced
03:24 - rendering features like subsurface
03:26 - scattering and transmission and a wall
03:28 - just makes it more configurable and
03:30 - finally artists now have greater control
03:32 - over reflections and light probes which
03:35 - helps minimize errors in lighting mm
03:37 - 18.3 also comes with some editor
03:39 - improvements Linda now has a unified
03:41 - settings window for project settings and
03:44 - preferences the new window is dark apple
03:46 - and searchable which makes it much more
03:48 - convenient to quickly find and change
03:50 - settings also we now have the ability to
03:52 - close and scroll through open tabs now
03:54 - as always the particle team has a bunch
03:56 - of new features for the shuriken
03:58 - particle system particle lights now
03:59 - support real-time global illumination
04:01 - you can now flip particle measures just
04:03 - like with billboards the particle
04:05 - standard shader has been made default
04:06 - the external forces module has been
04:08 - approved along with the texture sheet
04:09 - animation module and the list goes on a
04:12 - really cool addition is ported mesh
04:14 - shape emission which allows you to
04:15 - create cool effects around meshes like
04:18 - these also the new ring buffer mode
04:20 - makes it easier to create persistent
04:21 - effects like footprints
04:23 - bullet holes by keeping particles alive
04:25 - after their lifetime expires until
04:28 - they're replaced and finally with this
04:30 - new version unity will be expiring the
04:32 - old legacy particle system at this point
04:37 - though I can't imagine anyone being sad
04:39 - about that since the new particle system
04:41 - is better in pretty much every way
04:43 - now this vide simply had way too many
04:44 - features to cover in this video here's
04:46 - the list of some of them finally 2000
04:48 - 18.3 comes with a number of smaller
04:50 - changes and bug fixes for complete
04:52 - overview check out the release notes
04:54 - using the link in the description and as
04:56 - always I encourage you to join the beta
04:57 - and try out the new version after all
04:59 - being part of the beta program is super
05:01 - helpful both for us developers and the
05:03 - unity depths plus you get to try out new
05:05 - and exciting stuff and joining the beta
05:07 - is really easy simply click the link in
05:09 - description to get started on that
05:11 - thanks for watching and I will see you
05:12 - in the next video is the video over but
05:17 - I still want more screen time the
05:19 - upgrade speeds up operation such as
05:20 - break a sting shape sweeping and meth
05:23 - cooking with suites with sweeping speed
05:28 - tubs with sweeping
05:30 - it's thanks out the awesome patreon
05:38 - supporters who donated in July and a
05:40 - special thanks to Andrew killin n Co are
