00:05 - second I might already have gone live by

00:38 - it looks like this and it's kind of a
00:41 - dutch d falling our blocks kind of gave
00:44 - a game so we have the player controller
00:48 - here and we have the blocks that
00:50 - randomly spawn and they will increase in
00:53 - their falling speed and once you get hit
00:56 - you can see okay that was not the best
00:58 - display but we have this cool
