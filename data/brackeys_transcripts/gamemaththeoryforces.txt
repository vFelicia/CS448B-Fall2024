00:07 - everyone and welcome to this episode of
00:08 - Game math Theory today we'll be
00:10 - exploring the branch of Applied
00:11 - Mathematics that is referred to as
00:13 - Dynamics which for us means the study of
00:15 - forces we'll be looking at how you can
00:16 - apply forces to an object in order to
00:18 - make it move and we'll use these
00:19 - techniques to create a simulation of the
00:21 - effects of gravity in space so what's a
00:24 - force forces can be described as a push
00:26 - or a pull on an object let's say we have
00:28 - a friend called Tom Tom is standing on a
00:30 - railroad track and in front of him is a
00:32 - card as Tom begins to push the cart he's
00:34 - applying a force which makes the cart
00:36 - move forwards how far the cart moves is
00:38 - determined by how hard Tom pushes
00:40 - meaning the magnitude of the force and
00:42 - at the same time by how heavy the card
00:43 - is meaning the mass of the card but how
00:45 - do we describe this mathematically well
00:47 - luckily we aren't the first ones to ask
00:49 - that question in fact it was already in
00:51 - the middle of the 1600s that a clever
00:53 - Englishmen started to wonder about it
00:55 - the name of the Curious guy was Isaac
00:57 - Newton and in 1686 he presented his
01:00 - three laws of motion the answer lies
01:02 - within the second law it states that
01:04 - acceleration which is a change in
01:06 - velocity is produced when a force acts
01:08 - on a mass the greater the mass of the
01:10 - object the greater the amount of force
01:12 - needed to accelerate it or as he simply
01:14 - put it acceleration equals force over
01:16 - Mass so let's say that Tom pushes the
01:18 - card with a force of 400 n the N here
01:21 - stands for Newton and is the standard
01:23 - measurement for Force let's also imagine
01:25 - that the card has a mass of 50 kilos the
01:28 - resulting acceleration of the card not
01:30 - counting any friction from the wheels
01:32 - would then be 400n ided 50 kilos which
01:35 - after a bit of trickery with the units
01:37 - gives 8 m/s squared it can be hard to
01:40 - visualize what an effect such an
01:41 - acceleration has on the card so let's
01:43 - instead figure out the speed of the card
01:45 - and how far it has moved after a certain
01:47 - amount of seconds if Tom keeps pushing
01:49 - the card with the same force it will
01:50 - slowly increase in speed we say that
01:52 - velocity equals acceleration multiply
01:55 - with time so after pushing the card for
01:57 - 1 second it will move at a speed of 8 m
02:00 - per second squ multiply with 1 second
02:02 - which is equal to 8 m/s if we show the
02:04 - speed over time on a graph we can see
02:06 - that it increases LLY as Tom pushes the
02:09 - cart we can also get the distance that
02:11 - the cart moves we say that distance
02:13 - equals half the acceleration multiplied
02:15 - with time squared so after 1 second the
02:17 - card will have moved half * 8 m/s s * 1
02:21 - second SAR which is equal to 4 M again
02:24 - we can show this on a graph to see that
02:26 - the card moves further away at an
02:28 - increasing rate but what happens if
02:29 - multiple forces are acting on an object
02:32 - in our example another friend shows up
02:34 - called Dwayne Dwayne works out and is
02:36 - able to push at a greater force than Tom
02:38 - because Dwayne pushes in the opposite
02:40 - direction he will overwhelm Tom and push
02:42 - the card back we say that the resulting
02:44 - force on an object is the sum of all the
02:46 - acting forces so in our case we have two
02:49 - acting forces the push of Tom and Dwayne
02:51 - and the resulting force is the push of
02:53 - Tom which is 400 Newton plus the push of
02:55 - Dwayne let's say that's 600 Newton but
02:58 - because Dwayne is pushing in the next
02:59 - negative Direction the resulting Force
03:01 - becomes 400 Newton - 600 Newton which is
03:04 - equal to -200 Newton and so the
03:07 - acceleration of the card is -4 m/s
03:09 - squared making the card move backwards
03:12 - one of the most interesting things to
03:13 - study when it comes to forces is gravity
03:16 - because unlike Dwayne pushing a card
03:18 - gravity cannot be seen and yet it is
03:20 - constantly affecting the world around us
03:22 - in fact gravity is a force that acts
03:24 - between all objects that means that when
03:26 - Earth pulls Dwayne down he's actually
03:28 - creating an equal large pole on the
03:30 - Earth but because the Earth has a much
03:32 - bigger Mass it doesn't move much again
03:35 - thanks to Newton we can describe the
03:36 - magnitude of the force that acts on two
03:38 - objects all we need to know is the mass
03:40 - of the objects that are attracting each
03:42 - other and the distance between them so
03:44 - let's say that two bowling balls are
03:46 - floating in space that's probably the
03:48 - weirdest thing I've said today I mean
03:50 - what are they even doing there are the
03:52 - Space Monkeys bowling let's say that the
03:54 - mass of the first ball is 1 kilo and the
03:56 - mass of the second ball is 2 kilos and
03:58 - that's exactly 1 M between the center of
04:01 - each ball we can then calculate the
04:02 - force that we should apply to each
04:04 - object as the mass of the first ball
04:06 - multiplied with the mass of the second
04:07 - ball divided by the distance squared we
04:10 - also need to multiply with the
04:11 - gravitational constant which is
04:12 - basically just a very small number that
04:14 - helps sort out the units so if we
04:16 - calculate this out we can see that our
04:18 - two bowling balls will attract each
04:19 - other with a force of 1.33 multip with
04:22 - 10 to the^ of -10 Newtons this might
04:25 - seem as an extraordinarily small number
04:27 - and it definitely is but remember that
04:29 - it will will drastically increase as the
04:31 - objects move closer to each other and
04:33 - try to imagine just how large this
04:34 - number gets when the objects are as
04:36 - heavy as moons or planets so how do we
04:38 - use this information to simulate the
04:40 - effects of gravity acting on several
04:42 - objects in space well we simply keep a
04:43 - list of all the objects in the scene
04:45 - then each frame we Loop through the list
04:47 - and for each object we will apply a
04:49 - force to all other objects and calculate
04:51 - the magnitude of each Force using the
04:54 - formula we can then use our knowledge
04:56 - from earlier to move each object
04:58 - according to the forces AC on it and the
05:00 - result should look something like this
05:02 - if you want to play around with it
05:03 - yourself there will be a link to the
05:04 - source code in the description that's
05:06 - pretty much all I have to show for this
05:08 - video if you're interested in learning
05:09 - more about Dynamics there's a link for
05:11 - that in the description as well I hope
