00:03 - lower one over come to the best modeling
00:06 - programs for unity Dunbar brackets I am
00:09 - the CEO of brackets and in this video we
00:11 - are going to take a look at choosing a
00:13 - modeling program to suit your unity
00:16 - workflow keep in mind that this video is
00:18 - based on my own personal experience and
00:21 - therefore you might not agree with me
00:23 - entirely though this should help you get
00:25 - an idea of what software to pick I made
00:28 - this video because a lot of you have
00:29 - requested me to do so now let's get
00:33 - started with what I like to use I prefer
00:36 - a piece of software in the little more
00:38 - expensive region called autodesk maya
00:42 - the firm autodesk is huge in the city
00:46 - computer graphics and similar sation
00:48 - world and I personally like Maya because
00:52 - it's well documented Etna has very few
00:54 - limitations and also it works well with
00:57 - unity but we'll get into that in a
00:59 - second first I want to show you how the
01:01 - interface and the UI looks and so here's
01:05 - how it looks and first thing you will
01:08 - notice is there are a lot and lots of
01:11 - buttons and it can look even worse than
01:14 - this but I think that the interface is
01:18 - pretty intuitive and they is a logic to
01:22 - it so once you get into the mindset of
01:24 - Maya you will start to figure things out
01:27 - though it's definitely not for the
01:30 - complete beginners so let's move on to
01:34 - talk about how it implements with unity
01:37 - so the good thing about Maya is that I
01:39 - don't even have to export the model into
01:42 - an FBX and then import it into unity you
01:46 - can just save it in Maya format directly
01:48 - like you could see min doing here and
01:51 - then and then just load it up in unity
01:55 - and it will work and if you want to make
01:58 - changes you can just double click the
02:00 - file in the project pane and it will
02:03 - then open up in Maya and you can make
02:05 - changes and Maya can be very hard to
02:09 - learn because it has so it is so complex
02:12 - and has so many features
02:13 - so for complete beginners - often too
02:16 - much to take in an alternative Tamiya is
02:21 - another Autodesk program called 3ds max
02:25 - and we'll get into that in just a second
02:28 - first of all I want to show you how Maya
02:31 - exports into unity so you can see here
02:34 - that in can save in the maya maya file
02:38 - with both messages textures animation
02:41 - data and wreaking or bones so you can
02:45 - make a complete character in maya and
02:48 - just export them directly into unity you
02:51 - can also export to the FBX which is also
02:55 - made by autodesk and it will also store
02:59 - all of the different data though the
03:01 - DAAD maya works completely fine - so
03:05 - it's a little easier to handle now let's
03:09 - move on to the 3ds max max is really
03:13 - great and it's often considered to be
03:15 - more effective for creating low polygon
03:17 - models which is what you need in the
03:20 - game industry both programs are great
03:23 - though and it really depends on what
03:25 - sued YouTube the best let's have a look
03:29 - at the interface this is how it looks so
03:31 - you can see it looks a little different
03:34 - in this picture I wasn't working with
03:37 - anything at all so it does look a little
03:39 - more scraped but I would think that they
03:42 - are pretty much on the same level my
03:45 - personal opinion though is that 3ds max
03:48 - is a little easier to learn for modeling
03:50 - purposes it is still really expensive
03:52 - though just like Maya you remember that
03:57 - you can get unlimited trial time on that
03:59 - website on both Max and Maya
04:02 - but watch out it's only for educational
04:04 - purposes you cannot use it to make a
04:09 - profit so here's where you can where you
04:13 - can download it on their website and
04:17 - it's only for educational use now let's
04:23 - move on to see how it exports into unity
04:25 - just like Maya you can
04:26 - exported in its own file format with
04:29 - both meshes textures animation data and
04:31 - raking and it also exports to FBX so um
04:36 - it's really awesome to work with unity
04:38 - and 3ds max at the same time and awesome
04:43 - free alternative to all of the Autodesk
04:45 - stuff is blender then there is an open
04:48 - source modeling program and game as an
04:51 - engine as well that means that it's free
04:54 - and I've worked with blender a lot of
04:57 - them in the past this is how it looks
04:59 - and I found the modeling tools to be
05:02 - really great for the more serious
05:04 - modeler because the interface is very
05:07 - hard to figure out I think it's pretty
05:10 - cryptic and I couldn't really wrap my
05:13 - head around it and also it can be very
05:16 - distracting with having a game engine in
05:19 - the same program that you're modeling
05:22 - because there are a lot of buttons that
05:25 - you don't want to use and stuff like
05:27 - that so I keep in mind that for the
05:29 - again complete beginner blender is often
05:32 - too much and though it is really really
05:36 - powerful and let's move on and see how
05:40 - it exports with the unity so you can see
05:44 - that it can export in its own blender
05:47 - format with with all of the dates are
05:50 - needed though it cannot export to FBX
05:52 - anymore on that feature was removed a
05:55 - couple of updates ago anyway let's move
06:00 - on to the more easy to use software and
06:04 - here we have wings 3d which is also free
06:08 - and it's really really focusing on
06:12 - modeling it's it's pretty much designed
06:17 - to do modeling only and therefore it's
06:19 - the easiest to learn and the interface
06:23 - is Parrish grapes you the user don't
06:25 - have to learn hundreds of key bindings
06:28 - to do basic actions like inserting an
06:31 - edge loop or extruding a face everything
06:34 - is pretty much done through the
06:36 - interface and that through hotkeys and
06:38 - key bindings
06:40 - the downside to wings 3d is that it
06:42 - could be a pairing to do with later on
06:46 - basically the only format that works
06:49 - between unity and wings 3d is wavefront
06:53 - or what's known as obj you can see it
06:56 - here and it works without texture data
06:59 - animation or reking so it's only
07:01 - modeling it sets on the Unity website
07:05 - though that it should be able to export
07:08 - to FBX though I've never been able to
07:13 - make it work because the creators of
07:15 - wings later remove the feature wings is
07:18 - really good for doing stuff like texture
07:21 - work it's not it's really no good for
07:23 - doing stuff like texture work or
07:25 - animation either so it's recommended
07:27 - that you do this in a separate program
07:30 - wings is with all of the flaws the
07:34 - faster program to modeling that's just
07:37 - how it is so it's very fast here we have
07:39 - a picture of a model that one of our 3d
07:43 - modelers made and this was done in just
07:47 - 60 minutes and I don't know if this
07:51 - picture really shows all of the detail
07:53 - that went into this but it will get you
07:57 - an idea of just how fast you can work in
07:59 - wings now moving on to an alternative to
08:04 - wings 3d also for the beginner
08:07 - we have cheetah 3d which is one of the
08:11 - cheaper modeling programs and it reminds
08:14 - me a lot of wings 3d though without many
08:17 - of the floors cheetah 3d is easy and fun
08:21 - to use
08:22 - it costs only $99 and here is the
08:28 - interface so you can have a look you can
08:30 - see that the the interface is very
08:32 - scraped there's not much to it and I was
08:36 - able to learn how to use this for basic
08:38 - modeling in about an hour or so so
08:41 - that's really really great though it is
08:45 - Mac only so that's a bummer e for the
08:49 - Windows users that was basically oh yeah
08:54 - let's just talk about how exports it
08:56 - exports in the cheetah 3d format with
09:00 - every piece of data that you can think
09:02 - of and I'm pretty sure it also exports
09:08 - to the FBX so that's great for the
09:11 - exporting purposes it will work fine
09:13 - with unity that's it for the modeling
09:17 - software overview let's just take a
09:20 - quick walkthrough of what we have talked
09:23 - about so to sum up my is great for
09:26 - modeling texturing rigging and animating
09:28 - but hard to learn and expensive if
09:31 - you're not a student 3ds max is much
09:34 - like maya though it suits some people
09:36 - better and some people worse you'll have
09:38 - to figure that out on your own blender
09:40 - is some free and very deep program for
09:43 - doing modeling but some guests get lost
09:45 - in the many features wings 3d is the
09:49 - easiest of them although it has its
09:51 - limitations and cheetah 3d is really
09:55 - good for beginners but unfortunately
09:57 - only available for Mac users good luck
10:01 - in choosing the right one for you I hope
10:04 - you enjoyed the video and I'll see you
10:06 - in the next one
10:08 - you
