00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus other one
00:04 - will come to video number four in the
00:06 - how to program in c-sharp course today
00:09 - we are going to be taking a look at what
00:11 - is called conditional logic or more
00:14 - specifically if statements so this will
00:18 - allow us to expand upon our program and
00:21 - teach it how to make decisions based on
00:24 - certain criteria and that really expands
00:27 - or really opens up on all kinds of
00:30 - different software that we can then
00:32 - write so this is really an important
00:36 - lesson
00:36 - cool so before we get started I just
00:39 - want to thank Daedalus or Daedalus for
00:43 - providing today's wallpaper it's super
00:46 - cool I've decided this thing called
00:48 - developer wallpapers where you guys can
00:51 - submit developer development or break is
00:55 - related designs and have a chance to get
00:57 - featured and also included in the HD
01:00 - wallpaper pack so whether or not you
01:03 - just want to download some cool
01:05 - wallpapers or you submit a cool design
01:07 - of viewers you should head over to break
01:10 - Easter calm slash wallpapers and you can
01:13 - download them here or check out the
01:16 - thread with where all of the designs of
01:18 - submitted and you can review those that
01:21 - didn't make it to the wallpaper pack
01:24 - cool so now that we have that out of the
01:27 - way let's head into Samaranch studio and
01:31 - I just quickly want to walk you through
01:33 - how I solved the challenge from the last
01:37 - video so I asked you to make a program
01:40 - that will divide two numbers and print
01:42 - out the result and here's what I come
01:46 - came up with I've added a bit of extra
01:48 - spice just to show you something cool
01:50 - called a go-to so first off let's try
01:54 - and run this program and you can see
01:56 - that it asks for a numeral parently a
01:59 - number to be divided and we can type in
02:03 - 30 then it asks for a number to divide
02:07 - by and let's type in 5 and once we hit
02:10 - enter it says that 30 divided by 5
02:13 - is equal to six but the cool thing here
02:16 - is that when we now hit any key it says
02:21 - you can see that it loops and again ask
02:24 - for a number to be divided so I've added
02:27 - this loop so what I've do done is is
02:31 - basically declare two int values I've
02:33 - written out that you should enter number
02:37 - and converted it to an int and all that
02:39 - and then written out the result down
02:41 - here which you can check out just type
02:44 - directly in here if you wanted to look
02:46 - exactly as si I've done it here just
02:50 - going to correct the error there and
02:52 - then what I've done down here is I've
02:55 - waited for the user to press a key using
02:57 - console that right rekey then I've made
03:01 - some empty space by using a an empty
03:04 - console dot write line so it's just
03:07 - going to make a new line and then I've
03:09 - used the go to you so basically up here
03:12 - I've written start and then a colon and
03:14 - that allows me to later in the code
03:17 - write go to and then start and then a
03:20 - semicolon to jump back onto up to that
03:23 - start statement up here so that will
03:26 - basically just loop the program I could
03:29 - also put this let's say down here and
03:35 - now whenever we go through this and do
03:38 - 30 and 5 and then hit enter you can see
03:43 - it just prints the result again because
03:45 - it just jumps back to the place where we
03:48 - print the result so you can put that
03:50 - different places in your code to make it
03:52 - easier on yourself one thing you will
03:56 - notice is that if we play this and do 3
04:00 - divided by 2 it says that it's equal to
04:05 - 1 and we are pretty sure that that is
04:09 - not correct so what we can do is instead
04:13 - of using int which is integers meaning
04:17 - whole numbers we can do what is called a
04:21 - float or a double remember we talked
04:24 - about datatypes well
04:26 - a float or a double are basically
04:29 - decimal point numbers if load is pretty
04:32 - precise and the double is very precise
04:35 - so let's just for the fun of it use a
04:38 - double let's type double there and
04:42 - instead of in here we'll type double two
04:45 - then instead of convert 2.2 and 32 we'll
04:50 - do convert that to double and do the
04:55 - same down here convert that to double
04:59 - and then we should actually be able to
05:05 - divide uneven numbers so now when we hit
05:08 - play here or getting a decimal point
05:12 - result that's what I mean so when we
05:15 - enter your number let's do 3 divided by
05:18 - 2 you can say that the answer is 1.5 and
05:23 - this also allow us to maybe divide 12.5
05:28 - by 2.3 and it will give us the exact
05:32 - results so now we can do pretty heavy
05:35 - calculations with this program cool so
05:38 - now let's a delve right into the subject
05:41 - of today which is if statements and we
05:44 - are going to write a program that asks
05:46 - the user how old he or she is and then
05:50 - write out things depending on the age so
05:53 - this is useful for gathering data or for
05:56 - checking the age of the user if you are
05:58 - say making a a game that has blood in it
06:02 - or just want to check for explicit
06:05 - content in general so let's do console
06:08 - dot write line and inside of this we're
06:13 - going to ask how old are you question
06:18 - mark and then on the next line we're
06:20 - going to make a integer called H because
06:24 - H is our rounded numbers and then we are
06:28 - going to equal this to convert dot to
06:31 - int 32 as we've done multiple times and
06:36 - then inside of these two parentheses we
06:39 - are going to type cons
06:40 - dot read line and then remember to open
06:44 - and close parentheses there also so
06:47 - nothing new here what we are then going
06:50 - to do is we are going to type if and
06:53 - then two parentheses like these but
06:56 - don't put a semicolon right here that's
06:59 - very important with if statements we
07:01 - don't put us in my colon and then inside
07:04 - of the the parentheses here is where we
07:08 - will put our condition so if H is less
07:12 - than this is the less than operator
07:15 - eighteen then we can do something I'm
07:19 - just going to show you the different
07:21 - conditional operators meaning the stuff
07:24 - we can check for so if H is less than
07:27 - then there's greater than then there's
07:30 - is equal to so really watch out that you
07:34 - have two equal signs whenever you are
07:36 - checking for something and one when when
07:38 - you're setting something equal to
07:40 - something else so this is is a if H is
07:45 - equal to eighteen then we have stuff
07:47 - like it's not equal to is less than or
07:51 - equal to or is more than or equal to
07:55 - okay so we're going to check if H is
07:59 - less than eighteen then we're going to
08:03 - open and close some curly brackets and
08:06 - inside of those everything that will
08:10 - happen if we meet our criteria will be
08:13 - put so just like we have a function and
08:16 - everything inside the curly brackets
08:17 - that belong to that function will be
08:20 - executed if that function is called and
08:23 - the main function is called when the
08:25 - program starts so that just means
08:27 - everything basically we have an if
08:30 - statement where everything inside of
08:32 - these two curly brackets will be
08:34 - executed if the criteria is met so here
08:38 - we're going to say console dot write
08:41 - line I'm you're going to write that's
08:47 - too bad you will
08:52 - have to wait a couple of years then
08:58 - after DF statement and this is where it
09:00 - becomes pretty cool we can do something
09:03 - if the criteria is not met and even
09:06 - better we can if the criteria is not met
09:09 - we can check for something else so we
09:12 - can do else which we'll just call the
09:15 - code if the criteria is not met or we
09:18 - can do else if where we can then check
09:20 - for another thing so we can check if H
09:24 - is then equal to 18 we can type our
09:31 - console dot write line and then here we
09:38 - can write peu barely mated and then here
09:47 - we can put an else statement so we don't
09:52 - want to check for anything and we can
09:55 - type console dot write line and then
10:00 - that final we can write you are allowed
10:04 - to enter so let me just show you how we
10:10 - can read through this oh actually we
10:12 - also have to put the whoops console dot
10:18 - read key just so our program won't quit
10:21 - let me just read through this so you
10:24 - know how to read these if statements
10:25 - allowed so we are writing a line to the
10:29 - console asking how old are you we're
10:31 - then collecting the age based on a
10:34 - console dot readline and converting it
10:36 - to an integer then we are asking if the
10:41 - H is less than 18 and if it is we write
10:45 - out this line if it's not we want to
10:49 - check if the H is equal to 18 and if it
10:54 - is we write out this line and if it's
10:56 - still not then we just do else meaning
10:59 - that if it's not below or equal to 18
11:02 - this line will be called
11:05 - cool so now we can just go ahead and hit
11:08 - play to test this out how do I'm just
11:11 - going to write 17 that's too bad you
11:14 - still have to wait a couple of years and
11:16 - now we hit enter and the program closest
11:19 - you can of course also try let's say 18
11:21 - it works and then we can try maybe 45
11:27 - cool so that is how you do conditional
11:30 - logic you can make many different things
11:34 - using if statements just like this so
11:38 - the challenge for the next video is to
11:40 - create a small application where the
11:44 - user have to do solve math problems so
11:48 - what we will do is we will start out by
11:51 - creating two integer variables then we
11:55 - want to ask the user what is num1
11:59 - divided by num2 just print it out then
12:03 - you want to collect the user sensor and
12:05 - store it in a variable then I want you
12:08 - to check if that is true and if it is
12:11 - right out that that's true and if it's
12:15 - not then right out you better try again
12:18 - so that's your challenge for the next
12:21 - video because once you have that in
12:23 - place I'm going to show you a very
12:25 - simple way to make that a little bit
12:28 - more fun cool so thanks for watching and
12:30 - I'll see you in the next video
12:34 - you
