00:00 - one of my favorite things to do in unity
00:01 - is playing around with particles for
00:04 - some reason I just keep having fun with
00:05 - it
00:06 - so in this mega video we'll go over the
00:08 - entire particle system from beginning to
00:10 - end
00:11 - here are some time stamps if there's any
00:12 - particular feature you want to hear
00:14 - about this video is sponsored by udemy
00:16 - udemy is a great site for learning new
00:18 - skills and they have a lot of cool
00:20 - courses on making games today I want to
00:22 - mention this awesome course on building
00:24 - android games and apps using unity
00:26 - throughout the course you will learn how
00:27 - to build a Legend of Zelda game from
00:29 - scratch make 3d models using blender and
00:32 - how to tailor everything to the Android
00:34 - platform so if this course sounds
00:35 - interesting to you
00:36 - or if you're just looking for an awesome
00:38 - place to discover new knowledge on game
00:39 - development definitely check out udemy
00:41 - to get started simply click the link in

00:45 - the particle system consists of a bunch
00:47 - of different modules that each control
00:49 - different aspects of the system you have
00:52 - to enable a module in order to access
00:54 - its settings the first three modules and
00:57 - the very last module are almost always
00:59 - used these are the particle system the
01:01 - mission the shape and the renderer
01:03 - module which all enabled by default the
01:06 - rest of the modules contain more
01:07 - specific settings for different use
01:09 - cases so let's take it from the top the
01:12 - particle system module is by fine the
01:14 - module with the most important settings
01:16 - this module contains global properties
01:18 - that affect the entire system here you
01:21 - can control whether or not the system
01:22 - should loop the duration of the system
01:25 - and if you want to have it play
01:26 - automatically some of the properties in
01:29 - the particle system module applied to
01:30 - the particles themselves as they are
01:32 - emitted in other words these are the
01:34 - start settings for your particles this
01:36 - includes lifetime which is how long a
01:39 - particle will last speed size rotation
01:42 - and color now all values that you adjust
01:45 - in the particle system can use something
01:47 - we call modifiers this make it possible
01:50 - to randomize properties or control them
01:53 - over the duration of the system the
01:55 - modifiers are going to be different for
01:57 - each property but one that's really good
01:58 - to know is random between two constants
02:00 - as the name suggests this allows you to
02:03 - have unity randomize between two vibes
02:05 - another one is curves which gives you
02:08 - full control of a property over
02:10 - now this module is also where you can
02:13 - add gravity to your particles also
02:15 - before moving on make sure to choose a
02:17 - stimulation space here we decide if we
02:19 - want the particles to follow around the
02:21 - object or move independently the
02:25 - emission module handles the creation of
02:27 - particles here we have three different
02:29 - types of emission to choose from rate
02:31 - overtime Radio distance and curst s--
02:34 - the first one rate over time simply
02:37 - affects how much time passes between
02:38 - each particle emission this is probably
02:41 - one of the most used properties of the
02:43 - entire particle system the second one
02:45 - can be used to define how far the object
02:47 - needs to move before another particle is
02:49 - emitted especially useful for moving
02:52 - vehicles emitting smoke finally you can
02:54 - set up bursts where you fire off a bunch
02:56 - of particles at once I use this all the
02:59 - time for explosion like effects in the
03:02 - shape module we choose the shape of the
03:03 - emitter there is a rarity of shapes you
03:06 - can choose from such as sphere
03:07 - hemisphere cone and donut or you can of
03:11 - course choose your own mesh this can
03:13 - allow for some pretty interesting
03:15 - results the rest of the properties for
03:17 - this module control how the particles
03:18 - are emitted from the shape do they only
03:21 - emit from the surface or from the for
03:23 - volume what direction should they shoot
03:24 - out and so on the renderer module is
03:27 - extremely important this is where you
03:29 - define the look of your particles using
03:32 - the render mode we can choose if we want
03:34 - to show the particles on a 2d surface
03:36 - which we call a billboard or if you want
03:39 - to render them as a 3d mesh after
03:42 - choosing a render mode we have to assign
03:43 - a material if you're creating 2d
03:45 - particles they're a bunch of shaders to
03:47 - choose from under the particles shader
03:49 - category many of these use custom
03:51 - blending modes to give the particles a
03:53 - certain look
03:53 - the main wants to know are additive
03:55 - which make the particles seem very
03:57 - bright Pilon including the right paths
03:59 - of the texture and multiply which does
04:02 - the opposite if you're making 3d
04:04 - particles you can simply use the
04:05 - standard shader also if you want the
04:08 - particles to cast or receive shadows
04:10 - make sure to enable it here next we have
04:14 - what I like to call the over lifetime
04:15 - module
04:17 - as the name implies we use these to
04:19 - change properties on the particles over
04:21 - time after they get emitted here we have
04:24 - some self-explanatory ones like size and
04:27 - color as you can see the color module
04:29 - gives us a gradient that we can use to
04:31 - smooth the transition from one color to
04:33 - another the bottom part of the gradient
04:35 - defines color and the top defines alpha
04:37 - values so you can easily use this to
04:39 - fade in and out particles we also have a
04:41 - module called velocity over lifetime
04:43 - that allows you to control the speed of
04:46 - the particles over time here you can
04:47 - control the amount of force to apply in
04:49 - each axis and the speed modifier is a
04:51 - multiplier that affects the speed in all
04:53 - directions limit velocity over lifetime
04:55 - is also interesting in that it does the
04:58 - exact opposite here we can limit the
05:00 - speed of the particles by adding drag I
05:03 - often use this for explosion like
05:05 - effects where the particles should
05:06 - gradually slow down and just like the
05:09 - over lifetime modules we have lit by
05:11 - speed modules these make changes to the
05:14 - particles based on their current speed
05:16 - for example in color by speed we create
05:18 - a color gradient and rather than have a
05:20 - change over time we match it to a
05:23 - certain speed range rotation and size by
05:25 - speed work in much the same way the
05:28 - noise module is a new addition to the
05:30 - unity particle system and it's
05:32 - absolutely amazing it basically allows
05:35 - you to add turbulence to your particles
05:37 - fully understanding the different noise
05:39 - properties can get rather math heavy but
05:42 - in general we can say that strength is
05:44 - how much you want the noise to influence
05:45 - the particles frequency is how smooth
05:48 - you want the turbulence to be the higher
05:50 - the value the faster and more often the
05:53 - particles will change direction scroll
05:55 - speed allows you to change the noise
05:57 - that applies to the particles over time
05:59 - which can make everything feel much more
06:01 - dynamic and finally the octaves define
06:04 - how many layers of noise we stack on top
06:06 - of each other by adding multiple noise
06:08 - layers we can create more interesting
06:10 - movement at the bottom of the module we
06:12 - choose what we want the noise to affect
06:14 - position rotation and size the collision
06:18 - module enables your particles to collide
06:20 - with all the game objects in your scene
06:22 - you do this by setting the type to world
06:25 - however this can be pretty taxing on the
06:27 - computer since that you can use the
06:29 - default
06:29 - option claims here you define custom
06:32 - planes that only the particles will
06:34 - collide with in most cases you probably
06:36 - also want to reduce the bounce factor to
06:38 - not make them jump around as well as
06:40 - increased dampen to make them slow down
06:42 - on impact
06:43 - I also recommend playing around with the
06:45 - collision quality to make everything as
06:47 - performant as possible the sub emitters
06:50 - module is where things begin to get more
06:52 - complicated
06:53 - imagine inception but for particles here
06:56 - you can set up submitters meaning you
06:58 - can spawn new particle emitters from
07:00 - other particles the new emitter can then
07:02 - be controlled as a separate particle
07:04 - system an example of when this is useful
07:07 - is when creating impact effects or
07:09 - fireworks if you want your particles to
07:11 - animate you can use the texture sheet
07:13 - animation module here you can specify
07:15 - either a texture sheet where each image
07:18 - in your animation is laid out on a grid
07:20 - or a number of sprites I use this all
07:23 - the time when creating 2d games and
07:25 - especially for crafting more detailed
07:27 - special effects the lights module is a
07:30 - fast way to make the particles cast
07:31 - light onto their surroundings this is
07:34 - great for effects like fire or lightning
07:36 - here you can simply create a light and
07:38 - drag it into the light slot you can then
07:40 - control how big a portion of the
07:42 - particles should emit lights using the
07:43 - ratio the other settings like use
07:46 - particle color and size effects range or
07:49 - determine whether or not you want the
07:50 - resulting light to be affected by the
07:52 - particle it's sitting on if you check
07:55 - out them the look of the light will be a
07:56 - combination of the particle and the
07:58 - light and if you don't check any of them
08:00 - the light will just keep its values
08:02 - now the trails module can create a trail
08:05 - either from or between particles the
08:08 - most important thing to remember here is
08:09 - that you need to create a trail material
08:12 - in order for it to render properly the
08:14 - trail material is assigned in the
08:16 - renderer module after this you can
08:18 - adjust width and color and even have a
08:20 - change over the length of the trail with
08:23 - the triggers module particles can
08:25 - actually trigger game logic when
08:26 - colliding with objects the callback can
08:28 - happen when the particle enters
08:30 - exits is inside or is outside of the
08:33 - collider by default you have the option
08:35 - to kill particles when triggering but
08:36 - you can also create your own custom
08:37 - script for more advanced behaviors if
08:40 - this is something you're interested in I
08:41 - reckon
08:42 - checking out the example in the
08:43 - documentation with the inherent velocity
08:45 - module the emitter can transfer its
08:48 - current velocity to the particles it
08:50 - emits this is useful if your particle
08:52 - system is moving around the scene and
08:54 - you want the particles to follow it to
08:56 - some extent you can use the multiplier
08:58 - to choose the portion of the emitter
08:59 - speed that gets transferred to the
09:01 - particles if you have a wind sown in
09:03 - your terrain enable the external forces
09:05 - module to make it influence your
09:07 - particles and finally we have the custom
09:10 - data module which is pretty much
09:11 - reserved for advanced users in short
09:14 - this allows you to define custom data to
09:16 - be attached to your particles you can
09:18 - then later use this data in a custom
09:20 - shader so that is pretty much all the
09:22 - features I wanted to cover in this video
09:24 - from here on it's up to you to have fun
09:26 - and experiment and if you still have
09:28 - questions I suggest you have a look at
09:30 - the documentation it holds all the
09:32 - answers also don't forget to check out
