00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello
00:04 - everyone and welcome to the first video
00:05 - in this short series on making a quiz
00:07 - game in unity using c-sharp so a lot of
00:10 - you guys have been requesting me to do
00:12 - some smaller series may be only a few
00:14 - videos long that cover how to make
00:16 - different kind of games and we are going
00:18 - to begin with a quiz game hopefully I
00:21 - will be able to teach basic
00:24 - object-oriented programming concepts we
00:27 - will also focus on how to store data and
00:30 - manipulate data in form if in the form
00:32 - of questions and then how to display
00:35 - that data in unity using unity Skua
00:38 - system so it's going to be a lot of fun
00:40 - if you are a beginner to intermediate
00:42 - user on this series is just for you and
00:45 - yeah so before we get started I just
00:48 - want to say that the multiplayer FPS
00:50 - tutorial and the 2d platformer course is
00:53 - still being worked on of course I have
00:55 - some really cool stuff coming out for
00:56 - that as well so this is just extra stuff
00:59 - don't freak out so let's just jump right
01:02 - into it so what we are going to be
01:04 - making in this video is the actual
01:07 - interface we are not going to be
01:08 - programming we are just going to be
01:10 - sketching some stuff out in unity and I
01:13 - have something really cool that we can
01:15 - use to do that so let's just make a new
01:17 - project here and I'm going to call mine
01:20 - simply quiz game and I'm going to save
01:24 - it on new projects and select 2d as
01:26 - default let's then hit create project
01:29 - and unity will open up a standard
01:31 - default project fast so that's going to
01:34 - be nothing in here what you could do now
01:36 - is simply right click here and go on the
01:38 - UI and start building the interface
01:40 - using these elements however I searched
01:43 - around a bit and I've actually found a
01:45 - really cool plugin that has some nice
01:47 - features or some nice elements that we
01:50 - can use for our interface and it's
01:52 - called
01:52 - material UI it's a unity plugin that has
01:57 - created the Google material design in
02:00 - unity so you can see all the cool
02:02 - looking elements right here that we are
02:05 - now able to use we are not going to be
02:07 - using all of the different features in
02:10 - this we're basically just going to be
02:12 - using some
02:12 - nice buttons with a cool click animation
02:16 - and some nice shadows and maybe a bit of
02:19 - the color palettes and stuff like that
02:21 - but you can really create some advanced
02:23 - stuff with this this package costs about
02:27 - $50 on the assets story so if you don't
02:31 - have that money and I definitely don't
02:32 - expect you to buy this you can either
02:34 - follow along and unity' using the normal
02:36 - stuff or do as I will do in this video
02:39 - and use the beta version before the
02:43 - official release release which is still
02:46 - publicly available on github so you're
02:48 - fine to use this this is licensed under
02:50 - the Apache License and you can
02:53 - definitely use this commercially so I'm
02:56 - going to have a link to this skip github
02:58 - page where you can download it in the
02:59 - description again should the link be
03:01 - broken or the stuff be taking down you
03:04 - can either sacrifice the money and get
03:06 - this really cool plug-in or just use the
03:08 - default stuff in unity it's going to be
03:10 - just as fine there's nothing we are
03:12 - going to be using here that you can't do
03:13 - in unity so let's click material UI
03:16 - unity package for the latest release and
03:19 - you can see that it will be downloading
03:21 - down here as soon as it stops
03:23 - downloading we can simply click on this
03:25 - to open it up in unity that's the cool
03:27 - thing about unity packages they are
03:29 - completely wrapped finished packages
03:33 - that you can import into unity and it
03:36 - will take care of structuring everything
03:38 - together and all that so you can see we
03:40 - have this material UI folder which with
03:42 - a bunch of different assets inside and
03:45 - we're just going to import them all here
03:47 - so this might take a little while
03:49 - depending on your computer because this
03:52 - material UI plugin has a lot of elements
03:55 - in it I've used it for several product
03:58 - and projects now and I've been really
04:00 - fond of using it so especially
04:03 - especially for the animations which are
04:05 - really really well done so we should get
04:09 - hopefully no errors you might get a
04:10 - warning here that's just complaining
04:12 - about some line endings so I'm just
04:14 - going to clear that that's definitely
04:15 - not on the to-do list so let's hop into
04:18 - the material UI folder and you can see
04:21 - that they've even included a star die
04:23 - scene this just has a standard
04:25 - camera with a white color it has a
04:28 - canvas with some different settings on
04:32 - it and just an event system which
04:34 - follows in any kind of canvas so you can
04:37 - see in the game right now we just have
04:39 - this right white screen so let's go
04:42 - ahead and add an element to this let's
04:44 - right click on the canvas let's go under
04:46 - material UI instead of UI and you can
04:49 - see we have a lot of a lot of different
04:51 - stuff just as in the unity we have a
04:53 - text as we have under the unity UI you
04:56 - also have a text here and a panel and
04:58 - all that stuff but we also have some
05:00 - extra elements such as radio buttons
05:03 - which is some selection boxes and stuff
05:07 - like that you can go crazy playing
05:09 - around with these so what we are going
05:11 - to select is just panel I want to make
05:13 - the panel from where we will select our
05:15 - question so you can see that it's
05:17 - already added this nice panel with some
05:20 - rounded edges and a cool shadow I'm
05:23 - going to make this darker so let's
05:25 - select our main camera and change the
05:26 - background color and if you've gone to
05:28 - presets here and click this button right
05:31 - here and you instead of having just the
05:33 - default you can change to one of these
05:37 - project presets right here and those are
05:40 - included with the material UI so I'm
05:44 - just going to select basics here and we
05:46 - can select the basic back dark
05:48 - background color here then we can find
05:51 - our panel open that go and do panel
05:53 - layer and let's change this color to the
05:56 - same one except maybe just a bit
05:59 - brighter there so something like this
06:01 - looks pretty good now we can select the
06:04 - entire panel and let's hold down alt and
06:09 - while we scale it on the horizontal axis
06:14 - almost all the way over here and let's
06:17 - now drag it up a bit something like
06:21 - there and then also scale it up
06:25 - something like that I think that looks
06:28 - pretty nice and you can always change
06:30 - this later
06:31 - now let's anchor this correctly so that
06:33 - it will scale correctly with the screen
06:35 - so let's first off yeah let's
06:39 - choose this one so it will stretch
06:41 - horizontally and be anchored to the top
06:44 - so if we now move our canvas here oops
06:47 - if we move our canvas you can see that
06:50 - it will follow and if we move the top
06:52 - here you can see that it will just
06:53 - follow the top but not scale vertically
06:56 - so that's perfect
06:57 - and what we can do is just take our
06:59 - scene view and put that over here this
07:02 - way we can have a nice preview of our
07:03 - game here and work on the right hand
07:06 - side so the next thing that we need to
07:08 - add is a couple of buttons that we can
07:11 - click I want our quiz game to have two
07:14 - states either the question is true or
07:17 - its false and depending on what you are
07:20 - choose you can get either a Kuwait
07:22 - correct answer or a wrong answer so
07:26 - that's kind of how we will model this
07:28 - out
07:28 - you could definitely have different
07:30 - options here you could say in what year
07:33 - was Jason born created and then you can
07:37 - have three different options if you want
07:39 - and that's completely fine it's the same
07:42 - basic concepts but I think for
07:44 - simplicity we're only going to have two
07:46 - so let's go under cabinets let's
07:48 - right-click that and go under your
07:50 - material UI and let's select a button
07:53 - and it's going to be a text raised so
07:57 - you can see just how that looks and
07:59 - let's take this button and let's drag it
08:02 - over so it's aligned with the center and
08:05 - let's drag it up so it's aligned with
08:07 - our panel there and drag it down so it's
08:09 - around line with our bottom and let's
08:12 - take the same button and we don't want
08:15 - to align it here we want these surfaces
08:17 - to a line you can see that the box here
08:19 - is a bit bigger than the button itself
08:21 - that's because we have the shadow in
08:24 - there too so we'll have to drag it out
08:26 - here and just do an eye measurement that
08:28 - looks good used to create to align them
08:30 - there and you can see that that looks
08:32 - just like a sharp edge over there
08:36 - something like that looks pretty good
08:38 - and now we can go ahead and configure
08:40 - this button a bit so if we go under here
08:43 - actually let's just rename our panel
08:45 - here this is going to be the question
08:47 - panel weight statement pan
08:51 - panel whatever you want to call it and
08:54 - this down here is going to be the true
08:58 - button and we can go into the button
09:02 - layer go into the button text and let's
09:06 - delete the snap button to text because
09:09 - we don't want the size of our button to
09:11 - be controlled by the text and now we can
09:14 - take the font size here and scale that
09:16 - up dramatically let's also change the
09:20 - font type here from maybe Roboto regular
09:23 - to a Roboto a medium that looks pretty
09:27 - good and we also want to change the
09:30 - color here to a white down here using
09:32 - the preset that looks cool let's change
09:36 - the text here to true and then we can
09:41 - maybe scale it up a bit further
09:43 - something like that then we can take the
09:46 - button layer itself and let's make this
09:48 - a light blue something like that looks
09:57 - pretty good and yeah I think we will
10:00 - begin with that at least I actually want
10:02 - this text maybe to be just a bit wider
10:05 - or something like that and then let's
10:10 - make a second button so let's duplicate
10:12 - this true button let's move it over just
10:15 - like this so it's aligned let's make
10:18 - this the false button so change the name
10:20 - here to a false button and by the way to
10:22 - duplicate it I simply pressed ctrl D or
10:25 - command D if you're on the Mac let's go
10:27 - to the button layer and let's first
10:28 - change the color here want it to be
10:31 - completely red and actually the tint
10:34 - already looks very nice so maybe just a
10:36 - bit more saturated there and that looks
10:39 - super cool let's I open this up and go
10:42 - to button text and let's change this to
10:45 - false so there we go we have very
10:48 - clearly indicated with both both of
10:51 - colors and font that these are polar
10:54 - opposites now what we can do is maybe
10:58 - scale these buttons in a bit I think
11:00 - they're a bit too far apart so we can
11:03 - maybe just take this
11:04 - and if we okay so let's anchor them
11:08 - correctly first actually so let's take
11:10 - the true and the false button and change
11:13 - their anchors so we basically want them
11:17 - to scale with the entire screen on one
11:22 - axis but only half the screen on another
11:25 - axis so we want them to scale around the
11:28 - center here and then half the horizontal
11:34 - width yeah good so in order to do that
11:38 - let's make them stretch here and simply
11:40 - click that down here and then we'll make
11:42 - sure that if our canvas scales on the Y
11:46 - you can see that the button scale with
11:49 - it
11:49 - however it's not currently good on the X
11:52 - so we will select our true button and
11:55 - we'll take this Oh we'll take this
11:59 - anchor here if I can just click it there
12:02 - we go and move this all the way over
12:05 - this way when I resize the canvas you
12:08 - can see that that resizes in a nice way
12:12 - resizes with this part of the screen
12:14 - then we can take the false button and do
12:17 - the same except now we take the right
12:19 - part here and drag it all the way over
12:21 - so now when I resize the screen you can
12:23 - see just what happens here so that's
12:26 - actually completely perfect and if you
12:29 - want kind of a very tall the odd look
12:32 - the text is going to be clipping and
12:34 - this is not going to be looking nice
12:36 - anymore but then you might look into
12:38 - resizing the text or anything like that
12:41 - but for now we're just going to make it
12:43 - look great for this format what we can
12:46 - then do with the button says we can have
12:47 - this go a bit to the right so we'll
12:50 - maybe put in a negative 10 there and do
12:53 - the same with the false here so let's do
12:55 - negative 10 for the left so now they are
12:58 - just a bit closer together and I think
13:00 - that looks even better and then we can
13:03 - take the true/false and question panel
13:06 - and we can maybe just move them all up a
13:09 - bit just so they are completely centered
13:11 - on the screen and we could even go ahead
13:14 - and just scale it out just a tad
13:17 - so it fills almost the entire screen
13:23 - that looks great okay so I'm actually
13:26 - really satisfied with that I'm think
13:28 - we're going to stick with that for now
13:30 - you can always change this and spend
13:32 - more time on time on it than I do then
13:35 - under the question panel we want to
13:37 - right click go on to material UI and
13:40 - select text and we want to of course
13:42 - instead sort our actual question or
13:45 - statement of fact or whatever you want
13:47 - to call this we are just going to call
13:48 - it the question and we want this to be
13:51 - on this is a question actually it's a
14:00 - place holder good and will of course be
14:04 - changing this through code so it doesn't
14:06 - make sense to spend a lot of time
14:08 - thinking about what this should say
14:10 - let's just scale that up I'm holding
14:12 - down alt and clicking here to make it
14:14 - scale with the entire panel and then
14:16 - we'll send you that on both the X and
14:19 - the y then we'll scale up the fund
14:25 - something like that let's make this the
14:29 - white color down in the presets here and
14:31 - I think that actually looks good you
14:33 - could go ahead and change the fund if
14:35 - you want a different look but I actually
14:37 - really like this and that's basically it
14:39 - I mean now we've created our UI and I'm
14:41 - going to show you just how cool the
14:43 - material UI plucking is because when I
14:46 - go ahead and hit play now
14:47 - we are not going to have any borrowing
14:50 - animations but if I click this you can
14:54 - see I get this really cool looking
14:56 - ripple effect so that's super awesome if
15:00 - you want a bit more of a hover animation
15:02 - you can see that currently when I
15:04 - hovered we do get a bit more shadow but
15:06 - we can also make it tint a bit so let's
15:08 - go and do that let's select our true
15:11 - button go into the button layer and do
15:14 - the same thing with the false button
15:16 - select both button layers excuse me the
15:21 - shadow normal size I want to change that
15:23 - to two and the shadow access active size
15:25 - I want to change that to three and then
15:28 - I wanted to also highlight when
15:31 - hover it so now when we play you can see
15:34 - that the shadow is a bit more clear and
15:37 - they actually tense so they react to the
15:40 - mouse hovering over and we still get
15:42 - that really cool ripple effect so that
15:46 - was basically it for this video I hope
15:48 - you enjoyed it and I'm definitely
15:49 - looking forward to the next one so
15:51 - thanks for watching and I'll see you in
15:54 - the next video
