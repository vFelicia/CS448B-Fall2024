00:00 - sal√πte entire 8:38 just got wrapped up
00:02 - and the review process has now started
00:04 - if you don't know Ludum dare is a huge
00:05 - game development competition where you
00:06 - get 48 hours to create a game from
00:08 - scratch using only adding code you make
00:10 - yourself as always the theme was
00:12 - announced in the middle of the night so
00:14 - when I woke up I was stoked to see that
00:15 - my favorite one had been selected the
00:17 - theme was small world so I quickly
00:19 - pulled out the whiteboard and started
00:20 - sketching out ideas I thought about
00:22 - making a 2d planet with changing terrain
00:24 - that the player would have to pass by
00:25 - and a city building game with way too
00:27 - little space to build on I ended up
00:29 - scrubbing both ideas however I decided
00:31 - to stick with the theme of using a small
00:32 - planet as the game world the player
00:34 - controlling a red car would then drive
00:36 - around the planet trying to avoid
00:37 - meteors and to up the difficulty the
00:39 - planet would get smaller and smaller
00:41 - over time with this idea in mind that
00:42 - created a to-do list and finally it was
00:44 - time to boot up unity I quickly got some
00:46 - controls up and running but for some
00:48 - reason that just couldn't get them to
00:49 - feel right I tried a number of solutions
00:51 - but kept on getting either jittery
00:52 - movement back collision emphasized
00:54 - controls weird camera movement and the
00:56 - list went on finally I ended up using a
00:58 - mix of rigidbody gravity calculation and
01:01 - quaternion that rotate to apply input
01:02 - driven rotation on top of that satisfied
01:05 - with the movement I jumped into blender
01:06 - to replace the default sphere with a
01:08 - smoother one creating the meatiest went
01:09 - really quickly I'd already implemented
01:11 - gravity and so it was just a matter of
01:13 - using random dead-on units for you to
01:15 - spawn meteors at random points around
01:16 - the planet a non collision energy a
01:18 - place a creator where they hit also made
01:20 - the planet shrink over time but then
01:22 - created a first shader using a tutorial
01:23 - by Elin Ciccone
01:24 - and tweaked it to be used for grass I
01:26 - generated a grass texture in Photoshop
01:28 - played around with the lighting a bit
01:29 - and added a gradient background after
01:31 - that I did some post-processing mainly
01:33 - the motion blur helped emphasize the
01:35 - action I created some particle effects
01:37 - for the meteors being able to add noise
01:38 - to the particles made them look so much
01:40 - cooler and finally to finish the
01:41 - graphics overhaul I modeled a quick
01:43 - crater in blender happy with the look of
01:45 - the game so far I went to bed at around
01:47 - 2:00 a.m. after I could not sleep I felt
01:50 - ready to work on the car now I really
01:52 - suck at modeling but I think from a
01:54 - distance it ended up looking just fine
01:55 - at least after I blew it up I now felt
01:57 - it was time to add a score counted to
01:59 - the game I thought it would be fun to
02:00 - have UI elements follow the planet so I
02:03 - made it interpolate towards the center
02:05 - as the planet shrunk in fact I liked the
02:07 - effect so much that I decided to do the
02:09 - same thing to the end screen now I've
02:10 - always been a huge Dragon Ball fan and
02:12 - my
02:13 - and it really reminded me of King Kai's
02:15 - so I decided to embrace it and add a
02:17 - single road that wraps around him the
02:18 - cash actually also inspired by his when
02:21 - it came time to making some music
02:22 - I felt really inspired and hop right
02:24 - into busker quarry I ended up creating
02:26 - five different soundtracks that's right
02:29 - five I lost two of them because I
02:30 - accidentally hit the Escape key
02:32 - I mean seriously why would that close it
02:34 - without warning why the other two tracks
02:37 - just didn't fit the vibe of the game
02:38 - they were too dark
02:43 - so for the fifth one I went for
02:46 - something simple and happy next I
02:50 - created a main menu to which I added the
02:51 - player controls and a cool scene
02:53 - transition also set up some quick sounds
02:55 - on the current videos and wrapped it up
02:56 - by creating an icon for the game I
02:58 - submitted it just before the deadline
03:00 - this is what I looked like at the end
03:02 - time for a bath and a shave when this
03:04 - time I loved the girlfriend participated
03:06 - for her first time you guys might know
03:08 - her as Sophie but from the forums she
03:10 - made a game about avoiding people you
03:12 - know on the street also she is now full
03:13 - time on brackets as well and has
03:15 - actually been doing most of the video
03:17 - editing the last three months so big
03:18 - thanks to her you'll find links to both
03:20 - games in the description go and play and
03:22 - review them all you want hope you enjoy
03:23 - playing them just a fraction of how much
03:25 - we enjoyed making them
03:26 - let's pretty much it for this video if
03:28 - you enjoyed it make sure to subscribe
03:29 - and maybe check out some of the other
03:30 - behind the scenes videos I've done for
03:32 - previous Ludum dare race other than that
03:34 - thanks for watching and I will see you
03:35 - in the next video thanks of the awesome
03:40 - patreon supporters who donated in march
03:42 - and a special thanks to Derrick Eames
03:44 - Kirk face Tamara fine James Calhoun and
03:46 - Jason the Tito if you want to support
03:48 - the channel and become a picture in
03:49 - yourself you could do so a patron
