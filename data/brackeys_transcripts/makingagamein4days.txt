00:00 - so last week was the community game jam
00:02 - a huge game dev competition hosted by us
00:04 - and a bunch of cool other guys the idea
00:07 - is simple you get one week to make a
00:08 - game from scratch and we got a
00:10 - staggering 1100 entries which is just
00:14 - absolutely insane of course also
00:16 - participated myself so here's how I made
00:19 - a game in one week but first this video
00:22 - is sponsored by eek read music when
00:24 - making a game mechanics and graphics are
00:26 - essential but just as important is audio
00:29 - yet music is an AI based music creation
00:31 - service that lets you tailor music for
00:34 - exactly the mood and style you're going
00:35 - for in a matter of seconds start with a
00:38 - scene mood and genre or a combination of
00:41 - these and with a symbol click on the
00:42 - create button the AI will put together a
00:44 - unique music track for you with a solid
00:47 - base already you now have the
00:48 - possibility to structure a track and
00:50 - even change out instruments which makes
00:52 - customization extremely easy with a
00:56 - simple license you can download
00:57 - unlimited Browdy free music that you
01:00 - make with the tool which means you are
01:01 - free to use and publish it in any game
01:03 - you might be working on so get started
01:05 - making customized music by simply
01:07 - clicking the link in the description and
01:09 - if you use the code practice you will
01:10 - receive your first month for free now
01:12 - the theme for the jam was the game is a
01:15 - liar which immediately reminded me of an
01:22 - old browser game called siphon action or
01:24 - a cat Mario it's known for its
01:26 - incredibly frustrating levels because it
01:29 - tricks the player by having seemingly
01:30 - harmless objects killed without warning
01:34 - this is always kind of intrigued me
01:36 - because there's something really fun in
01:38 - a game being so totally unpredictable so
01:41 - after some quick brainstorming I booted
01:43 - up unity and started by setting up some
01:44 - cymbal player movement and creating a
01:46 - level with two platforms where the first
01:48 - one is a normal platformer and the
01:51 - second one simply lets the player fall
01:52 - through now this was fun
01:55 - however I quickly realized that while
01:56 - the unknown is interesting it would
01:59 - probably be best to give the player some
02:00 - way of discovering some of these hidden
02:02 - traps without dying every single time so
02:06 - to achieve this I implemented lie
02:07 - detection classes that the player could
02:09 - control with his mouse and used to
02:11 - reveal the true
02:12 - nature of the game at the time I wasn't
02:15 - totally sure the best way to go about
02:16 - creating this mechanic I played around
02:19 - with the new lightweight custom render
02:20 - passes but after a while I ended up
02:22 - creating a custom shader which I was
02:24 - actually pretty pleased with of course I
02:27 - later found out that unity already has a
02:28 - built-in feature for this called sprite
02:30 - masks which I could have just used and
02:34 - saved ours but that doesn't really
02:37 - bother me it's all part of the learning
02:39 - process
02:40 - now with this mechanic in place it was
02:41 - time for some graphics I wanted to pay
02:43 - tribute to cat mario by keeping the
02:45 - graphics incredibly simple and of course
02:47 - mario like I used the tile map system
02:50 - for the environment and set up a quick
02:52 - example see also created the first draft
02:54 - of the main character who I decided to
02:56 - name detective truth now I really wanted
02:59 - the player to feel like he could see
03:00 - behind the scenes of the game so to
03:02 - really help sell the effect I made the
03:04 - lie detection glasses cut a hole in the
03:06 - background and placed a grid pattern
03:08 - similar to what you see in Photoshop
03:10 - when there's nothing on top this was a
03:12 - genius idea that I cannot take credit
03:14 - for it was a good friend of mine that
03:15 - came up with it and in fact I haven't
03:17 - mentioned this but we completely packed
03:19 - the office with friends during the jam
03:21 - who all wanted to participate two of
03:24 - whom made their first games I cannot
03:26 - recommend this enough not only is this
03:29 - great for bouncing ideas of each other
03:31 - and helping out with technical stuff
03:32 - it's also just a huge amount of fun to
03:34 - get together with other people who share
03:36 - a common interest so getting back to
03:38 - development i implemented collectable
03:40 - coins as was a panning camera that would
03:43 - kill the player when he couldn't keep up
03:44 - I feel this really added a sense of
03:46 - urgency to the game and forced the
03:48 - player to think on his feet and that was
03:50 - pretty much the end of day 1 for day 2 I
03:53 - started by creating a list of everything
03:55 - that would like to add to the game I
03:57 - then created a power bar that would
03:59 - limit the use of the lie detection
04:00 - classes if it got all the way to the
04:02 - bottom the glasses would overheat and
04:04 - you would have to wait for them to cool
04:06 - down I also edit a deathcounter and then
04:09 - it was time to do some level design
04:11 - luckily because I'd set everything up to
04:13 - use the Tom AB system this was a simple
04:15 - as drawing in the blocks that I'd like
04:17 - and choosing whether or not they should
04:18 - be real invisible or visible but not
04:21 - really they're also did a lot of work to
04:24 - make the shaders display which blocks
04:25 - did
04:26 - inside the editor so that I wouldn't end
04:28 - up confusing myself more than necessary
04:30 - I then added some deadly spikes and a
04:32 - blueprint effect that would appear when
04:34 - searching over objects that aren't
04:35 - really there
04:36 - I created fake coins that would reveal
04:37 - themselves to be spiky balls and spiky
04:40 - balls that were really coins that you
04:41 - could pick up I created fake platforms
04:44 - fake spikes and even fake ground that
04:46 - the player could fall through in fact at
04:48 - one point in the level the player had to
04:49 - walk through a bunch of fake ground in
04:51 - order to continue which was pretty
04:53 - confusing and then I had a fairly long
04:55 - level and wrapped up the day by creating
04:57 - a coin counter and with a bit of play
04:59 - testing the next day I jumped right into
05:03 - graphics and added a death animation as
05:06 - well as an in screen we thought it would
05:08 - be funny to have the player win if he
05:10 - cut to the bottom of the truth as in
05:12 - literally have an arrow point to the
05:15 - bottom of the truth yeah we were running
05:18 - on a questionable amount of sleep and
05:21 - then animated the player character and
05:22 - had the idea to have him turn into a
05:24 - skeleton when searched the effect ended
05:26 - up being pretty unnoticeable and
05:28 - probably not worth the time but I
05:30 - personally kind of liked it
05:31 - and by now it was time to add some audio
05:33 - this is something that I've skipped for
05:35 - some of my recent game jams because of
05:37 - time restrictions
05:39 - but this time I felt that I was pretty
05:41 - well on schedule so it jumped right into
05:43 - bus Casilla this program and drop a
05:47 - quick theme not the most advanced thing
05:53 - in the world but it would do I created a
05:55 - list of sounds and proceeded to run
05:57 - around the studio and search for things
05:58 - that I could smash together to create
06:00 - cool and interesting audio files you can
06:02 - really get a long way with household
06:04 - objects your voice pitch shift and a bit
06:06 - of EQ
06:07 - when of course it's a good idea to make
06:09 - sure no one is around since your sound
06:11 - really really stupid while doing it in
06:17 - fact we all scrambled to different parts
06:19 - of the studio to get a bit of privacy
06:21 - with the microphone
06:22 - finally I loaded all the sounds into
06:24 - unity and set up a quick audio manager
06:26 - to play them when triggered and I
06:28 - actually think they turned out all right
06:29 - now day four was submission day for me
06:36 - and when playing through the game I
06:37 - couldn't help but feel that it lacked
06:39 - something it was just a bit too static
06:41 - so to fix this I created cannons that
06:44 - would fire bullets that the player had
06:45 - to avoid a thing this definitely added a
06:47 - new dimension to the level which I'm
06:49 - really glad I got to include plus it led
06:52 - to my favorite moment in the game which
06:54 - is when the player has to figure out
06:55 - that one of the cannons shoots fake
06:57 - bullets that are in fact platforms the
06:59 - player must use to complete the final
07:01 - jump I love this because not only does
07:03 - it turn the normal idea of a bullet on
07:04 - its head it also forces the player to do
07:07 - a skill jump that I personally thought
07:09 - was pretty fun and with that it was time
07:11 - to submit the game I had some of the
07:13 - others do a quick playthrough to make
07:14 - sure everything was okay before
07:16 - exporting and finally hitting the
07:18 - publish button I think it's safe to say
07:19 - that I was pretty happy and all the
07:21 - others managed to complete their games
07:23 - in time as well I'll of course have a
07:25 - link to all of them in case you want to
07:26 - check them out and while you're at it
