00:00 - - Creating an RPG can be really fun
00:02 - but doing everything from scratch,
00:03 - especially if you're still a
beginner is a huge challenge.
00:06 - I mean, I should know, I've
created an entire tutorial
00:09 - series on creating an RPG in Unity.
00:12 - And trust me, it involves
a lot of programming
00:15 - just to get a simple thing to work.
00:17 - Of course, getting into
programming in Unity
00:19 - can be incredibly rewarding
and you definitely learn
00:21 - a lot from doing so.
00:22 - But if you're just getting
started, creating an RPG
00:24 - is simply not a good idea.
00:26 - Well, until now that is,
say Unity has just released
00:29 - their RPG Creator Kit.
00:31 - This is say small example
project, made for you
00:33 - to get started with creating an RPG,
00:35 - while avoiding a lot of the heavy work.
00:37 - It features a lot of Assets and Pluck
00:39 - and Play Game Play Mechanisms.
00:41 - All right, let's go on a quest
to creating an RPG. (laughs)
00:46 - But first, this video is
sponsored by Zenva Academy.
00:48 - Some of the requests that we get the most
00:50 - are in creating Multiplayer Games.
00:52 - Zenva Academy offers a
complete Multiplayer course,
00:55 - which takes you all the
way from the very basics
00:57 - to more intermediate content.
00:59 - You will learn Photon Networking
and get to build RPGs,
01:02 - Federal Yells, Turn-Based
Games and much more.
01:05 - The Multiplayer Game
Development mini degree,
01:07 - has been designed by Urgency
the Certified Instructor,
01:09 - in collaboration with Unity
Certified Programmers.
01:12 - For a low monthly or yearly
payment, you can get access
01:15 - to this curriculum along
with all other courses
01:17 - on their platform.
01:18 - Use the Coupon Code Brackeys
and the first a hundred people
01:21 - will get 50% off on their first month.
01:23 - To get started, save the exact
thing in this description.
01:25 - All right, let's go on and adventure.
01:27 - [Instructor] So first of
all, we want to open up
01:29 - the Unity Hub and from
here, we want to navigate
01:32 - to learn and if we then scroll down,
01:35 - you will be able to find
the Creator Kit RPG.
01:38 - Let's click on this and
here you can either go
01:40 - to the written to tutorials
01:41 - or you can download the projects.
01:43 - So, I'm going to to hit download project.
01:44 - And once it's downloaded,
we can hit open and Unity
01:48 - is then going to create
a new Unity Project
01:50 - with everything that we need in order
01:52 - to use the RPG Creator Kit.
01:54 - If you already have a project
and would just like to import
01:57 - all this stuff into that
project, you can also find
01:59 - the Creator Kit on the asset store.
02:01 - So with this, we can go
inside of our project
02:04 - and go into Creator Kit RPG.
02:06 - And here, there should be a scenes folder.
02:09 - In here, you can see two scenes.
02:10 - I'm going to go ahead and
open up the assemble scene,
02:12 - which shows an example of how to build
02:14 - a level using these tools.
02:16 - And if I just go ahead
and play the game here,
02:19 - we can get a feel of how the game plays.
02:21 - So I can use the arrow
keys to move around.
02:24 - We can walk up to this NPC here
02:27 - and we can have a chat with her.
02:29 - And overall it plays like a
fairly standard top-down RPG.
02:34 - As you can see, some
of the NPCs have quests
02:37 - and they will ask you to
complete certain tasks.
02:40 - This lady here wants us
to fetch some apples.
02:43 - And so we can now walk
around and try to find these.
02:46 - It looks like I found one here,
so I can now walk up to it
02:48 - and pick it up and it will
appear in our inventory.
02:51 - So now that we know that all
of this stuff is working,
02:54 - let's try and create our own level.
02:57 - So in order to do this, we'll
take our blank scene here
02:59 - and we'll duplicate it.
03:01 - So we'll press Control
D and we can rename this
03:03 - to something like, Level One.
03:05 - If we then double click
it, it's going to open up,
03:08 - as you can see, it's exactly what it says.
03:10 - It's just a completely
blank environment here
03:13 - where we can start to
fill in all the stuff
03:15 - that we would like to have in our game.
03:18 - Now I'm just going to go
ahead and disabled Gizmos here
03:20 - so we can more clearly
see what's going on.
03:22 - And I think the first
thing that we should do
03:24 - is just paint out a bit of a level
03:26 - for our character to explore.
03:28 - So to do that, we need
to go to the left here
03:30 - inside of our hierarchy
and as you can see,
03:32 - there are many objects here.
03:34 - One of them is our camera,
03:35 - which of course follows around our player.
03:37 - There's also the character itself.
03:39 - This is our player character.
03:41 - And as you can see,
there are many variables
03:43 - here that you can tweak, for example,
03:45 - if we want him to walk a bit faster,
03:46 - which I would personally
like, we can go ahead
03:48 - and increase his speed to 20.
03:50 - And if we now hit play,
although there's not much
03:53 - to see here, we will be
able to travel a bit faster.
03:56 - Another object that we
have here in the hierarchy
03:58 - is the world object.
04:00 - And as you can see, we can expand this
04:01 - because it has multiple children.
04:03 - One of this is the tile maps object.
04:06 - And tile maps are what we use
04:08 - in order to paint our environment.
04:10 - So in order to do that,
we need to go to Window 2D
04:13 - and open up our tile pallet.
04:15 - And as you can see, the
tile pellet here shows us
04:17 - all of the different tiles that we can use
04:19 - to paint on to our scene.
04:21 - However, before we start
painting with this,
04:23 - we need to make sure that
we have the right tile maps
04:25 - selected because we paint in layers.
04:28 - As you can see, there
are multiple layers here.
04:30 - There's a background, mid
ground and foreground,
04:32 - as opposed to a separate layer for fences.
04:34 - Now I'm going to select
the background layer here,
04:36 - as you can see, it's also
shows that as the active
04:39 - tile map up here and I'm
then just going to select
04:42 - one tile at a time and
start painting the same.
04:45 - Don't worry if this is hard
for you in the beginning,
04:47 - it does take a little
while before you start
04:49 - to understand when to put a corner,
04:50 - when to put aside or when
to put just pure fill.
04:54 - I'm also going to add some water down here
04:59 - and maybe another patch of grass here
05:00 - where we could put a house.
05:05 - Of course, there are
multiple tools up here
05:07 - to help you with painting.
05:08 - Currently, we're just
using the brush tool.
05:10 - You can access that by pressing B.
05:11 - We can also use select in
order to select a portion
05:14 - of a tile map and then
change to the move tool
05:16 - in order to move that around.
05:19 - If we switch to the mid
ground layer over here,
05:22 - we can start to add in paths
and that's the one down here.
05:26 - And even though it just looks like a dot,
05:28 - you will notice that once
you start drawing with it,
05:31 - it will actually form
a path automatically,
05:34 - which is really, really nice.
05:35 - By the way, in order to erase,
we can always hold down Shift
05:38 - and click and I'm just going
to draw out a few paths here.
05:43 - We can also create a cobbler stone path
05:44 - using this tile right here.
05:49 - And if we switch to our fences layer
05:50 - and select the fence tile,
05:52 - we can also start to add in those.
05:54 - And they work in the exact
same way as the paths.
05:59 - So as you can see, we
can really quickly start
06:01 - to scope out an environment.
06:03 - I'm just going to expand on this a bit.
06:04 - I encourage you to go completely
crazy and have fun with it.
06:07 - Just remember to always
paint in the right layer.
06:10 - As you can see, I've gone
ahead and added some grass
06:12 - to make our level bigger.
06:14 - And I could, of course go
in and manually fill out
06:16 - all these tiles but
instead, I'm going to use
06:18 - the paint bucket tool
right here to do that
06:21 - with a single click, all right.
06:22 - Back to painting.
06:23 - (soft music)
06:30 - All right, that looks good.
06:31 - I'm definitely happy with that.
06:32 - And remember, at any time
you can always hit play
06:35 - and have a stroll around your level.
06:37 - As you will notice, the
border is indeed animated
06:40 - right away and that looks weird.
06:42 - So I'm just going to
go in here and fix it.
06:45 - As you can see, it's really easy
06:46 - to play test and fix mistakes.
06:48 - So now we're ready to add
a house and to do that,
06:51 - we first want to paint the house space.
06:53 - We then add a roof and then add a doorway.
06:56 - So let's start with the base.
06:58 - For this, we want to
select our background layer
07:00 - and some in here where
I want to add my house.
07:03 - And as you can see to the right
here under our tile palette,
07:06 - there are multiple different
tiles that we can choose from.
07:09 - I'm just going to select an
ordinary wooden floor here
07:12 - and paint that in.
07:14 - We can then shift to our mid-ground layer
07:16 - in order to add walls.
07:18 - So I'm going to stick the left wall here,
07:19 - paint that in, the right wall as well.
07:22 - And for the back wall
here, we can either choose
07:24 - between this pattern
here or ordinary wood.
07:27 - I like the pattern, so
I'm going to select that.
07:29 - I'm not going to paint in a
door but I do want to paint
07:31 - in a window and you can actually select
07:33 - multiple Sprites at once here,
07:35 - if you want to just paint with those.
07:38 - So I'm going to have two
windows at the back here
07:40 - and one corner, there we go.
07:42 - And for the front, I
really like this dark red.
07:45 - So I'm going to paint with that as well.
07:48 - And remember to leave an
opening for your doorway.
07:50 - Of course, if you want
the house to be closed,
07:52 - you can just use a closed door right here
07:54 - but in my case, I want it to be open
07:56 - and so we'll do that separately.
07:58 - So there's the base of our house.
08:00 - Of course, we also want to
add a roof to our house.
08:03 - And the way that we do that is by going
08:05 - into our project here, then
we'll find the folder called,
08:08 - prefabs and here you will
see a house roof object.
08:11 - Now this is separate from
the tiles that we've painted
08:13 - so far, in that this is a free object,
08:16 - whereas the tiles are
only placed on the grid
08:19 - and so when we go ahead and take this roof
08:21 - and simply drag it into a scene,
08:23 - you can see that we can
place it completely,
08:25 - freely in our level.
08:27 - I'm just going to place it
on top of our house here.
08:29 - And I'm going to change
from the brush tool here
08:31 - to the Rec tool, which
is going to allow us
08:34 - to move this around and
resize it to fit our house.
08:39 - So I'm just going to assume in here,
08:40 - you can always press F
to focus on an object
08:43 - and I'm going to place it in
the bottom right corner here
08:45 - and then resize it to fit our
entire house, there we go.
08:49 - Also, just to stay organised,
I'm going to take this object
08:52 - in a hierarchy and move it
under the world parent object.
08:55 - In general, it's good to
keep all of your world
08:57 - or environment objects in here.
08:59 - And we can actually go ahead and do
09:00 - the exact same thing for our door.
09:02 - Under the prefab series,
that's of course also
09:04 - a house open door.
09:06 - So we'll simply drag that in.
09:08 - I'm going to hit F to focus on it
09:09 - and then place it in place.
09:11 - If you can see what's happening because
09:13 - of this selection outline,
we can always go up here
09:15 - in the right hand corner and disable that.
09:18 - And I can see now that I need to move it
09:19 - a tiny bit down, there we go.
09:21 - And if you want to be
completely accurate with this,
09:23 - you can go into the inspector.
09:25 - And as you can see, we can
now set the position here
09:27 - to 3.5 and the wide to
two in order to make sure
09:32 - that it's completely aligned.
09:34 - And again, I'm just going
to take this and move it
09:36 - into a world object.
09:37 - And our house now has a door, awesome.
09:40 - So with that, we can hit
play and we should now
09:42 - be able to move inside of our
house, which indeed we can.
09:46 - However, once we're in the
house, we would like the roof
09:48 - to fade away and reveal everything inside.
09:52 - So in order to add this functionality,
09:54 - we are going to select our house roof.
09:56 - And inside the inspector
here is where we can apply
09:58 - gameplay mechanics or
scripts to our objects
10:01 - in order to make them do different things.
10:03 - In our case, we first of
all, want a way to figure out
10:06 - if our player is inside of the house
10:08 - and we can do this really
easily by adding a trigger.
10:12 - So let's go add component here.
10:14 - Let's go under Physics 2D
and here you can see there's
10:17 - something called, a Box Collider 2D.
10:19 - If we select this and hit edit Collider,
10:22 - we can now see this green box.
10:24 - This is our trigger.
10:26 - So if you go ahead and scale
this to be kind of the same
10:29 - size as the roof here, something like that
10:32 - and we can stop editing the Collider now
10:34 - and we can also go ahead
and mark it as a trigger.
10:37 - In our case, we want
it to trigger a script
10:39 - that fades away the roof.
10:41 - And luckily for us, this has been built
10:43 - into the RPG Creator Kit, so we don't have
10:45 - to create that from the scratch.
10:47 - Instead, we can just hit our component,
10:50 - here we can scroll down to scripts
10:52 - and here we have three
different categories called,
10:54 - RPG M Dot and then there's
Game Play Mechanics and UI.
10:59 - In our case, this should
be under Gameplay.
11:02 - And here there is a script
called, Fading Sprite.
11:05 - So if we click that,
that should automatically
11:07 - take our Sprite and fade it away whenever
11:10 - a Collider is triggered.
11:11 - And if we go ahead and move into a house,
11:14 - we can see this working
perfectly, awesome.
11:16 - So we can all see what's
going on inside of the house.
11:19 - And we just added our
first game play mechanic.
11:21 - So with that, I think it's
time to bring everything
11:23 - to life with some Scotty
objects because currently
11:26 - we've just placed around
a lot of tiles and we now
11:29 - have a house well, let's go ahead
11:30 - and add some animated trees.
11:32 - And with RPG Creator
Kit, this is really easy.
11:35 - All we do is right click in a place
11:36 - that we would like to add a tree.
11:38 - We then go under environment and here
11:40 - we have three different animated trees
11:42 - to choose from.
11:43 - I'm going to select the first
one here and right away,
11:45 - that brings in a tree.
11:47 - And it even places it
under a parent object
11:49 - up here called, Animated
Tree One Collection.
11:52 - So it also stays organised for us.
11:55 - So I'm just going to take this tree here
11:56 - and place it, let's say
here, we can also place
11:59 - another type of tree over here and maybe
12:02 - a third type up here,
in fact, I like this one
12:05 - so much that I'm going to duplicate it.
12:08 - So I'm just going to hit Control D
12:09 - and we can then move it over.
12:11 - And I'm just going to do that once more
12:13 - to create three trees in a row.
12:15 - So I'm just going to quick this Scotty
12:16 - some of these around.
12:21 - And one thing that I
really recommend you do
12:23 - is you try to vary the size
of these trees a tiny bit.
12:27 - So you can always select a tree.
12:29 - I'd have to focus on it and seem
12:30 - to use these controls here to scale it.
12:32 - If you want to make sure
to do this uniformly
12:34 - so that you don't stretch it,
you can always hold down Shift
12:37 - and varying the size, it's
just going to make everything
12:39 - feel a tiny bit more organic.
12:43 - And if we now hit play,
you will notice that
12:45 - once we start playing all
the trees are animated
12:49 - and we'll be kind of blowing in the wind.
12:51 - Now I'm just going to
collapse the animated
12:52 - tree collections up here.
12:54 - And we can actually go ahead
and add in even more objects.
12:56 - If we right click under environment,
12:58 - there's also leaves
that we can add around.
13:00 - And these are also animated
and there's also a whole other
13:03 - category called, decorations.
13:05 - This is how she is to
add different plants.
13:07 - Here with this tool, you
have to be a bit careful
13:09 - because this is not
going to be automatically
13:11 - added to a collection.
13:12 - This is going to be added to the object
13:14 - that you currently have selected.
13:16 - So under world here,
let's go ahead and create
13:18 - an empty object and this
is simply going to store
13:21 - all of our bushes.
13:22 - So let's just call it, Bushes.
13:24 - And then with this selected,
we can right click,
13:26 - go to decorations and add our first Bush,
13:29 - and as you can see, it goes
right into that object.
13:32 - Of course, after placing this one,
13:33 - I then have to go ahead and
select our bushes object
13:36 - once more and then we can keep going.
13:39 - Just something to be aware of there.
13:45 - And once you feel like
you've kind of used up
13:47 - all the different bushes, well,
I have great news for you,
13:50 - you can always select
one of these bushes here
13:53 - and under the Sprite renderer here,
13:54 - you can actually change the Sprite
13:57 - for any other Sprite in the project.
13:59 - And this is totally searchable.
14:01 - So if you want a tree trunk,
you can find that here
14:04 - and simply click on it to change it.
14:07 - Of course, I recommend
also renaming your objects
14:09 - so you can find them again.
14:11 - Or if we duplicate this
and move it over and say,
14:14 - place it here, we can search
for something like rock.
14:17 - And it's going to show
you all different kinds
14:19 - of small rocks that you can
also schedule it around.
14:22 - So there's plenty of opportunity
to have fun with this
14:25 - and sculpt your own environments.
14:27 - But I think this is fine for now.
14:29 - What we really need in
the game now is an NPC
14:32 - to start us on our first quest.
14:35 - And doing that is actually
also really simple.
14:38 - We go to the place where
we want to create an NPC.
14:40 - In my case, I want to
create a potion seller
14:43 - that lives in this house.
14:44 - We right click, go Gameplay
prefabs and add an NPC.
14:49 - I'm going to take this
guy and place him here,
14:50 - outside of his house.
14:52 - And as you can see, in the inspector here,
14:53 - he currently has a conversation script
14:55 - where he just says one
thing, which is hello.
14:58 - And if we play the game, that
is indeed what happens, hello.
15:02 - So let's spice that up with
some of our own dialogue.
15:05 - So let's go to the
conversation script here
15:07 - and let's remove the first
entry and let's create
15:09 - our own by hitting the plus sign.
15:11 - This is going to open up a separate window
15:14 - and here we first have an ID.
15:16 - So what's an ID?
15:18 - Well, if we think about the
structure of a conversation,
15:21 - as you can see, it tends
to kind of branch out.
15:24 - So the NPC greets the
traveller and then the player
15:27 - can answer with two different options.
15:30 - And depending on what the player says,
15:32 - the NPC is going to give him
a reply based on that answer.
15:37 - And so you can imagine this branching out
15:39 - into even more options.
15:41 - However, this is kind of the simplest way
15:43 - to speak with an NPC.
15:44 - And the ID is simply that number here.
15:47 - So as we go deeper and
deeper into the conversation,
15:50 - we add more and more dots to our ID.
15:54 - So since this is an opening line,
15:56 - we're simply going to hit
one here and as for the text,
15:58 - we're going to say, greetings traveller,
16:02 - what can I do for you?
16:03 - And here, we want to give
the player two replies.
16:06 - So I'm going to add two
branches to this conversation.
16:10 - The first one is going to
be, I'm looking for work.
16:13 - Do you have anything for me to do?
16:16 - And the second option is going to be,
16:18 - I'm going into battle and I
need your strongest portion.
16:22 - What battle?
16:23 - I don't know but it sure sounds exciting.
16:25 - We then hit create or update down here.
16:27 - And then in order to add the responses,
16:29 - we simply use the plus sign once more.
16:31 - So this is going to be an
idea of 1.1 or the response
16:35 - to the first option and
that's just going to be
16:38 - fine, you should ask,
16:40 - someone seemed to have
stolen my golden apples,
16:44 - perhaps you could help me get them back.
16:45 - And it said, click on that.
16:47 - And the second option or 1.2
because it's the second option
16:52 - based on the first part
of the conversation.
16:55 - And this one is going to say,
16:57 - you can't have my strongest portion.
17:00 - It would surely kill you.
17:02 - And let's say, create,
now that we've created
17:04 - these two replies, we need
to go into our original part
17:07 - of the conversation and hit edit.
17:09 - And here we can choose
that our first reply
17:11 - is going to branch to 1.1.
17:13 - And our second reply is
going to branch to 1.2.
17:17 - And so you can start to
control how different replies
17:20 - trigger different conversation pieces
17:22 - and how they further branch out.
17:24 - So let's update that now and if we play,
17:27 - we should now be able
to walk up to our NPC.
17:30 - He says, greetings traveller,
what can I do for you?
17:33 - And now we can either
choose, I'm looking for work,
17:35 - do you have anything for me to do?
17:36 - I'm going into better than a
need your strongest portion.
17:39 - I'm going to select that one and he says,
17:41 - you can have my strongest
portion, it would surely kill you.
17:44 - And so that's the end of the conversation.
17:46 - Of course, speaking with
NPCs is only so exciting.
17:48 - Let's have this guy open up a quest.
17:51 - So to do that, we need
to create an empty object
17:53 - under our portion's seller.
17:55 - So let's directly gone
him and it create empty.
17:57 - And let's name this quest.
17:59 - We then add a component and of course,
18:01 - if you go out and search for a quest,
18:03 - there's a script for this
in the RPG Creator Kit.
18:06 - As you can see, this allows
us to do quite a few things.
18:09 - Let's take it from the top.
18:10 - So first of all, the course title
18:11 - is going to be lost apples.
18:14 - The description is going to be
for turn three golden apples
18:19 - to the portion seller.
18:20 - Now, in order to trigger this
quest, we need to assign it
18:23 - to a certain part of the
dialogue with the portion seller.
18:25 - So inside of our conversation script here,
18:27 - if we ask him if he has anything to do,
18:29 - and he says, fine, you should ask someone
18:31 - have stolen my apples.
18:33 - Well, then we can go in
here and trigger your quest.
18:36 - So we simply drag in the quest
object here and hit update.
18:39 - And now he will begin us on this quest
18:42 - whenever that happens.
18:43 - We also need some dialogue for
when the quest is happening.
18:46 - What does he say if we go up to him
18:47 - in the middle of the quest?
18:49 - And what does he say when
the quest gets completed?
18:51 - To do that, we add some dialogue
to the quest object itself.
18:55 - So here we'll add a conversation script,
18:58 - and it's add an item to this.
18:59 - The ID here is going to be
1.1.1 and the text is going
19:04 - to be, have you found the apples yet?
19:08 - They should be nearby,
19:09 - This way we also giving
a tiny hint to the player
19:12 - since he's come back with all the apples
19:14 - and then he might be having a tough time.
19:16 - Let's create that then we need to create
19:18 - another conversation
script, not just an item
19:21 - nor an entirely new component
19:24 - and I'll show you why in
a sec but here we'll also
19:26 - add a point, this is going to be 1.1.2.
19:29 - And the text here is going
to be, you found them.
19:32 - Thank you, great hero and it's a create.
19:36 - Now, the reason why we split
this up into two components
19:39 - is because we need to take the first one
19:41 - and drag it into the quest-in
progress conversation.
19:44 - There we go.
19:45 - And the second one and drag it into
19:46 - the quest completed conversation.
19:48 - So you can have more than
just a single reply here.
19:50 - You can have an entire
conversation trigger
19:52 - based on these two events.
19:54 - So now this takes us on our
quest but we currently don't
19:57 - have any golden apples to collect.
19:59 - So let's go ahead and add
that item into our scene.
20:03 - To do that, we'll right click,
we'll go Gameplay Prefabs
20:06 - and add in an inventory item.
20:08 - We can rename this item
here to Golden Apple
20:11 - and we then scatter three of these around.
20:14 - So I'm going to put one here, even though
20:15 - that might be fairly obvious.
20:17 - I'm going to put one down here by the tree
20:20 - and I'm going to put
one over here as well.
20:23 - Of course, recommend that
you are a bit more creative
20:25 - with your item placement than I am here
20:27 - but I just want them to be nearby
20:29 - so we can do some quick testing.
20:30 - Also, because all of these need
to be kind of the same item
20:34 - that we just need to collect three of,
20:36 - it's very important that
you make sure that all
20:38 - of them have the exact same names.
20:40 - And when we duplicate an
object, it adds a number.
20:42 - So we'll just go ahead
and remove that or else
20:45 - they're going to show
us three different items
20:46 - in the inventory, instead of stacking.
20:48 - Of course, if you don't
want to use apples like me,
20:51 - you can always go in here
and change this Sprite.
20:53 - So you could very easily
make it a chicken or a chest.
20:57 - That's completely up to you.
20:59 - Just to remember to both change the Sprite
21:01 - on this spread renderer and
inside of the inventory item.
21:04 - Now, in my case, I
don't want these objects
21:06 - to just lie around.
21:07 - I only want them to appear
once we have taken the quest.
21:11 - So if we select our quest here,
21:12 - there's an item here called,
Enable On Quest Start
21:15 - and if we expand that, we
can set this size to three
21:18 - and that allows us to drag in
each one of our golden apples.
21:23 - So now they will only appear
once we've started our quest.
21:26 - And similarly, there's the
list here for required items.
21:29 - I'm just going to set this
to one and the type of item
21:32 - is going to be the golden apple.
21:34 - So I'm going to drag in a golden apple
21:35 - and we want three of those.
21:37 - So it's going to check that
we have all of those apples
21:39 - in our inventory in order
to complete the quest.
21:43 - You can also spawn in stuff
when the quest is complete,
21:46 - trigger cut scenes and so on but for now,
21:49 - this should be fine.
21:50 - So if we go ahead and play test now,
21:52 - as you can see, none of the apples appear
21:54 - until we walk up to our NPC,
we trigger the conversation
21:58 - that starts the quest.
22:00 - He asks us to find the golden apples
22:02 - and indeed they appear right
away and we can then move
22:05 - around and gather these apples.
22:07 - And they will appear in our inventory.
22:09 - And because we remember to
name them according to this,
22:12 - they will also stack.
22:14 - And once we have all three apples,
22:16 - we can go back to our NPC.
22:18 - And the dialogue is a bit misplaced here
22:20 - because I'm recording and then
miss this with my resolution
22:22 - but he thanks us for being a great hero.
22:25 - And so we've actually created
our first quest for our RPG.
22:30 - Really cool, if you're also
having resolution issues,
22:33 - you can always go into a game view.
22:35 - And instead of having this
be-a-free aspect game,
22:37 - we can go in and lock this
down to a certain resolution,
22:40 - could, for example, do full
HD 1920 by 1080 and hit, okay
22:45 - and now it's always going to
snap to being a full HD screen.
22:49 - And you can, of course
also go to your main camera
22:51 - and if you to go to the
pixel perfect camera
22:53 - and run an edit mode, we
can, of course do stuff
22:55 - like change the asset pixels per unit,
22:57 - if you want to zoom in and out.
22:59 - You can choose whether or not
you want to crop your game
23:01 - and stretch it or whatever you want to do.
23:03 - I just want to show you
where you can configure that
23:05 - since it's not very obvious.
23:07 - Yay and that's pretty
much it for this video.
23:10 - Now, from here, it's up
to you to add more stuff
23:12 - to your game and configure
it to suit your needs.
23:14 - Luckily, Unity has some
great learning resources
23:16 - on how you can continue by adding rewards,
23:18 - story items and how you
can export your game
23:20 - to share it with your friends.
23:22 - But really, I just encourage
you to play around with it,
23:24 - add more embassies and
quests and you can even
23:27 - add your own gameplay systems on top.
23:29 - For example, if you want
to add combat to your game,
23:31 - definitely check out our
video on 2D shooting,
23:33 - which can easily be modified to work
23:35 - for immediately combat as well.
23:37 - Or one thing that I think would be perfect
23:38 - for this type of game is turn-based combat
23:41 - similar to what you see in Pokemon.
23:43 - So if that's something you want to see,
23:44 - definitely us know in the comments.
23:46 - Also, don't forget to
check out Zenva Academy
23:48 - and their Multiplayer mini degree.
23:50 - Simply click the link in the description
23:51 - and use code, Brackeys to get started.
23:53 - On that, thanks for watching.
23:54 - And I will see you in the
next video quest complete.
23:57 - Thanks to all of the awesome
patrons and supporters
23:59 - who donated in October
and a special thanks
