00:00 - hello everyone and welcome to the first
00:02 - level design video in our Survival game
00:04 - series this one is going to be much more
00:07 - art-based than usual but I'll still give
00:09 - away some cool tips tricks and
00:12 - techniques along the way the first thing
00:15 - I do is take a look at the reference
00:17 - photo and maximize it on my secondary
00:19 - screen so I can always have a look at it
00:22 - I then start sculpting away on a new
00:25 - terrain I start out using a large and
00:28 - smooth brush
00:31 - this way I can shape the overall feel of
00:33 - the
00:34 - mountains I then go in with a more
00:36 - detailed one to give it the rough and
00:39 - itchy look this way it will actually
00:42 - look like
00:49 - Stone I then add a simple grass
00:53 - texture it's always good to see how your
00:55 - terrain looks with textures
00:58 - supplied even though it's just a
00:59 - assemble one like this
01:02 - [Music]
01:07 - one I then add the outer
01:09 - boundaries and some more
01:13 - detail this is a good time to make the
01:16 - terrain look less flat so I start
01:18 - sculpting away on that I then rename it
01:22 - and add the default water import package
01:27 - water basic
01:30 - I then drag it into my scene set the
01:32 - position variables to zero and make sure
01:35 - it covers the whole
01:37 - terrain now I can just use the height
01:40 - brush to sculpt down on the terrain and
01:42 - the water will start
01:44 - appearing I then bring up the water a
01:47 - little bit and cover some of the
01:49 - mistakes where it goes through the
01:52 - ground now I add a path this is done by
01:55 - using the height
01:57 - tool I then select all of the different
02:00 - props and move them
02:03 - upwards here you see me creating the
02:05 - dirt path
02:07 - texture I made this using a
02:09 - photorealistic image taken with a real
02:12 - camera I then apply some filters to make
02:15 - it look more smooth and a bit
02:18 - cartoony this just adds a nice mood to
02:21 - the
02:22 - game I then painted onto the terrain
02:29 - [Music]
02:33 - I then load in a nice Stone texture and
02:36 - apply it to the
02:37 - [Music]
02:38 - mountains it's a good idea to have the
02:40 - same texture applied with this different
02:43 - opacity
02:45 - settings this way you can have
02:47 - variety and nice
02:50 - blending here you just see me making the
02:53 - path a bit
02:54 - darker to make the path blend better
02:57 - between grass and dirt I I apply another
03:01 - texture I do the same to the
03:04 - water I now use a large brush with
03:06 - plenty of detail to make the grass look
03:09 - less
03:10 - clean now it's time to position the
03:13 - objects around the scene I make sure to
03:16 - select the fence and drag it down to the
03:18 - project pane to make a prefab out of it
03:22 - I then make some empty game objects and
03:24 - drag four fences into one of them this
03:28 - way I can have packs of fences so I
03:31 - don't have to duplicate one and then
03:33 - move and so
03:35 - on make sure to rename them properly so
03:38 - you can quickly find them in your
03:41 - scene the same technique is used for
03:44 - applying the
03:46 - lamps I now want to apply fire to the
03:49 - fireplace so I import the default part
03:54 - particles I drag in the Flames position
03:57 - them and play around with the light I
04:01 - would like it to be bigger and softer so
04:04 - I add an extra light that can take care
04:06 - of
04:07 - that I then drag it onto the campfire
04:10 - prefab and drag it on into the project
04:13 - pane now I clean up the hierarchy by
04:16 - deleting old
04:19 - [Music]
04:28 - objects and then import a dock to sit by
04:31 - the
04:32 - [Music]
04:35 - water I create a custom collider by
04:38 - making a series of empty game objects
04:41 - with colliders
04:43 - [Music]
04:49 - attached finally I position it make it a
04:52 - pretty fap and make the last changes to
04:55 - the textures
04:58 - [Music]
04:59 - Here's the final result let me know if
05:01 - you like this type of video in the
05:03 - comments since I think it's a nice
05:05 - addition to the ordinary scripting ones
05:08 - thank you for watching and I'll see you
05:09 - in the next video
05:12 - [Music]
