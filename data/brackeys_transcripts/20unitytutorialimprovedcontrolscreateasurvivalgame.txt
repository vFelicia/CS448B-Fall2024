00:02 - hello everyone and welcome to the 20th
00:05 - video in our survival game series done
00:08 - by practice I'm the CEO of Rocky's and
00:10 - in this video we're going to take a look
00:12 - at improving on the controls of the
00:16 - player so on you're going to take a look
00:19 - at how to implement more advanced
00:21 - control functionality stuff like fall
00:24 - damage and I'll show the different
00:25 - things you can do with this in just an
00:28 - amount in just a moment and also just
00:31 - the general feel of the controls so let
00:35 - me just quickly show you what we are
00:37 - going to be making so on in this video
00:40 - we are not going to be doing the actual
00:42 - scripting I have used a script that I
00:48 - found online from the Wikipedia unity
00:51 - side called FPS Walker enhanced and then
00:55 - I have improved on that a bit to take
00:58 - care of stuff like crouching and just
01:02 - customizing it to fit our game a little
01:05 - better so this is what we are going to
01:08 - use and what this will allow us to do is
01:12 - it will allow us to do stuff like full
01:15 - damage so if our player falls from a
01:18 - certain height we can then subtract
01:21 - health or if he is standing on a plane
01:24 - at a harsh angle he can then slide off
01:29 - the plane so that we cannot run up
01:32 - mountains and stuff like that and you
01:37 - can also attack certain objects as
01:40 - sliders so that whenever he is on those
01:43 - objects the player will again slide so
01:48 - that's really good for making runner
01:50 - type games and then of course we can
01:53 - handle the sprint and crouching
01:55 - internally in the script also that's
01:58 - really awesome I had though make made
02:01 - some of it separate but but we'll talk
02:04 - about that in a second
02:06 - so that's what we are going to be making
02:08 - now I would really recommend that you go
02:12 - ahead and
02:13 - note the assets because we're going to
02:14 - be using scripts from them so I go to
02:17 - Brad keys comm and download and extract
02:20 - them and you should be left with a
02:23 - folder called survival assets and then
02:26 - the the newest version number and if you
02:31 - don't know how to do this you can always
02:33 - go ahead and look up the survival game
02:36 - bonus video in which we talked about how
02:38 - to do just that all right so let's go
02:43 - ahead and get started so double-click
02:45 - the survival assets folder and go under
02:47 - scripts here we should see the FPS
02:52 - Walker enhanced which I've edited it a
02:55 - little bit and you should also see the
02:58 - Crouch height which is going to allow
03:01 - our character to scale up and down I
03:04 - wanted to do that separately just to
03:06 - keep it a little bit more organized and
03:08 - also so that the FPS Walker enhanced
03:11 - didn't get too complicated alright so
03:16 - let's go ahead and select these two
03:18 - scripts and then just drag them into
03:21 - unity so here we have them and now we
03:26 - can go ahead and implement them you can
03:28 - see I've made a small change to the
03:31 - scene and this is just to demonstrate
03:32 - how the player can slide off a surface I
03:36 - just took the wall three here dope
03:40 - duplicated it moved it over rotated it
03:43 - and renamed it to test played now let's
03:47 - take a look at our player here so at the
03:50 - moment we have a lot of different
03:52 - scripts going on we have the mouse look
03:55 - the character motor the FPS input
03:58 - controller the sprinting crouch player
04:00 - stats and the respawn menu I've gone
04:05 - ahead and edit edited the respawn menu a
04:07 - little bit so let's first of all go into
04:11 - that and just take a look at the changes
04:13 - I've made so double-click it to open it
04:15 - up in monodevelop and inside of here I
04:19 - have some and simply gone ahead and
04:21 - commented out which means that when you
04:25 - make these two signs in front of
04:27 - line it's a comment so it won't be
04:28 - active so I've commented out the sprint
04:33 - script code because we are not going to
04:36 - be using this prints crypt variable I'm
04:39 - sorry we're not going to be using the
04:41 - sprint script on/off functionality since
04:45 - we are not going to be using the spin
04:46 - script at all so this is just this
04:51 - doesn't have to be there so I just went
04:53 - ahead and comment it out so you can
04:55 - still have it if you're using the old
04:57 - method also I have documented everything
05:00 - up here so you can read about it if you
05:02 - are in doubt at any point I've also gone
05:05 - ahead and changed the charm motor to
05:08 - charge controller and made it store a
05:12 - character controller instead this is
05:14 - because then it will work with both this
05:17 - solution we are going to be making and
05:18 - the one we had before so that's all for
05:21 - the respawn menu script you can go ahead
05:23 - and close that down and go back into
05:26 - unity so we can just collapse that and
05:31 - the player stats we're going to keep
05:33 - that the sprinting crunch we're just
05:36 - going to go ahead and disable that for
05:37 - now along with the FPS input controller
05:40 - and the character motor so now that we
05:44 - have that in place let's just go ahead
05:46 - and drag the player stats under the
05:48 - scripts folder because we are not going
05:50 - to be using that in this tutorial now we
05:54 - can go ahead and drag on the FPS Walker
05:56 - enhance and the Crouch height onto our
05:59 - player so now we can see that these two
06:02 - scripts have been applied the Crouch
06:05 - height has not no variables that needs
06:08 - to be set it will just make sure that
06:10 - whenever you press the C key to Crouch
06:13 - the player will the players Collider
06:17 - will scale down if you want to know more
06:21 - about how this script works you can go
06:24 - ahead and watch the sprint and Crouch
06:27 - tutorials are in two parts so let me
06:32 - just go ahead and open this up so you
06:34 - can have a look at what I've done here
06:36 - the script is exactly the same ants as
06:39 - the
06:40 - sprinting crowd script though I have
06:43 - excluded the parts where we edit the
06:46 - speed so I've just gone ahead and
06:49 - removed everything that was in the crowd
06:51 - script but the scaling functionality so
06:58 - that should be it so we can just go
07:00 - ahead and collapse that and now let's
07:02 - take a look at the actual FPS Walker
07:04 - enhanced the one we are really excited
07:07 - about this script is really awesome for
07:10 - making everything a lot smoother and
07:13 - more snappy so first of all we can set
07:17 - the walk speed I'm just going to set
07:19 - that to seven then we can change the run
07:21 - speed I'm going to leave that in eleven
07:23 - and the Crouch speed is final three the
07:27 - limit diagonal diagonal speed is not
07:31 - really something I want to worry about
07:32 - at the moment then you can choose vary
07:36 - whether you not you want to enable the
07:39 - run and the Crouch functions by just
07:42 - pressing these buttons then we have the
07:46 - jump speed which is fine at eight
07:48 - gravity is default at twenty and we're
07:52 - just going to leave it there then we
07:55 - have the falling damage threshold which
07:58 - means how high our player needs to fall
08:00 - before he takes damage more accurately
08:05 - it would be to say how much velocity he
08:08 - needs to hit the ground with so if he
08:10 - got gets shot at the ground then from
08:16 - from just a centimetres distance we
08:18 - should still those damage so that's very
08:21 - realistic in that way this is because
08:24 - the script uses the Unity physics engine
08:29 - the slide went over slope limit allows
08:33 - for this sliding went on a a rotated
08:39 - object so if I go ahead and hit play as
08:42 - this you can see that I can stand here
08:45 - and I can walk up and down this object
08:50 - just go ahead and drag the game view
08:54 - over you so we can see both the game and
08:56 - the scene view at the same time I can
08:58 - make you can see what happens when I
09:01 - press this and hit play the players
09:06 - lights down and he cannot climb the
09:09 - object awesome the slide on tact objects
09:16 - will allow the player to slide slide
09:18 - when you attack the game objects as so
09:21 - you can go in here in the FPS Walker
09:25 - enhanced to read more
09:27 - everything is commented and it should be
09:32 - pretty self-explanatory though I figured
09:36 - it was a little too hard to
09:39 - uncomplicated to show you how to
09:41 - actually script this functionality so
09:44 - we're just going to be using it which
09:46 - you're going to be doing in most games
09:49 - you're going to be creating in the
09:50 - future the slide speed that explains
09:55 - itself it's how fast you're going to
09:57 - slide down if you're sliding the air
10:00 - control is not something we're going to
10:02 - be well actually you might want to check
10:05 - that if you're doing something like a
10:07 - platformer and this allows you to move
10:10 - back and forth while you're in the air
10:12 - so older games had this a lot but in new
10:18 - it's a little more rare the ng bump anti
10:23 - bump factor you're going to use that for
10:27 - making it so that when we try to climb
10:29 - objects it's not going to jittery too
10:33 - much but I would just leave that if I
10:36 - were you and the same with the anti
10:38 - bunnyhop factory okay cool
10:42 - so we know that this slider is working
10:44 - correctly let's go ahead and see how
10:47 - things are going if we just drag the
10:51 - player up and make him fall
10:56 - ouch down here in the console view click
11:01 - that to open it in the console we can
11:03 - see a message appears a diverter lock
11:06 - saying ouch we fell twenty point three
11:11 - units this can be used for applying
11:15 - damage to our player which we are going
11:17 - to be taking a look at in a soon video
11:19 - you would then go ahead and just send a
11:23 - message to our player start script to
11:27 - actually subtract damage based on this
11:30 - information I hope you enjoyed the
11:33 - videos guys this was pretty much it it's
11:36 - not the longest but I wanted to really
11:38 - sit down and explain this to you because
11:41 - it can really improve the feel of your
11:44 - game so I hope you enjoyed the video and
11:46 - I'll see you in the next one
