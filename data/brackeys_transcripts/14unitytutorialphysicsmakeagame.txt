00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello
00:04 - everyone welcome to video number 14 and
00:07 - make a game a cool series on making a
00:10 - video game in unity today we are just
00:13 - going to be doing some different fixes
00:15 - here and there and we are also going to
00:17 - be playing a lot around with physics so
00:20 - I just wanted to give you an overall
00:22 - introduction to some of the more unknown
00:25 - parts of the physics system in unity so
00:28 - we're not going to be scripting today
00:29 - it's going to be all visual stuff
00:32 - so let's write into it first off I just
00:36 - want to fix the ambient light because
00:38 - when we now open up unity I think that
00:41 - some parts of the scene are just a bit
00:44 - too dark and you'll see that when we
00:46 - start to add more models into the game
00:49 - this is of course not its final graphic
00:51 - state I hope to add some details to it
00:54 - later on
00:56 - go so first off as you see here that's
01:00 - quite a bit of shadow on the ball so
01:02 - what I'm going to do is first I'm going
01:05 - to turn down the sunlight and this seems
01:07 - too weird that I'm fixing this by
01:09 - turning down the light but that is so we
01:12 - can turn up what is called ambient light
01:14 - to get some more fill light into the
01:17 - scene so we'll get rid of those shadows
01:20 - there so we'll do 1.3 here maybe let's
01:24 - see this in the game that looks nice
01:27 - when we now pump up the ambient light
01:31 - and you do this under edit render
01:33 - settings and then ambient light so we go
01:37 - in here and we still want this to be a
01:39 - grayish color maybe just a tiny bit blue
01:42 - from the sky but that's up to you I will
01:45 - just bump it up a bit here like this I
01:49 - think this is much better and maybe
01:51 - actually give it some more
01:53 - light from the Sun still so it becomes
01:56 - very very lit up yeah something like
02:00 - zero point actually let's still do 0.4
02:04 - so now it's it's very bright
02:06 - everything is very lit up but I really
02:09 - like this feeling for such a
02:12 - cartoon-like game cool so what we're
02:16 - going to do now is we are going to let's
02:19 - see on the list here we are going to fix
02:21 - the ball rotation because right now when
02:24 - we play the game wait a sec I'm just
02:29 - going to bump down the music here so
02:31 - it's not too loud for you this is
02:36 - probably better so right now when we
02:38 - play the game and we roll over here
02:43 - the ball might sometimes start to go in
02:47 - the wrong direction so if I can get it
02:49 - to do it here I might not be able to you
02:52 - oh yeah that did it so right now it's
02:55 - rolling off in some of the directions
02:57 - that we cannot control and that's a
03:00 - problem because sometimes the ball will
03:02 - just randomly roll out of the platform
03:04 - so what we can do to fix this is really
03:06 - easy we simply select the ball and we
03:09 - use what is called rigidbody constraints
03:12 - so under the rigidbody component go into
03:14 - constraints and we can simply check the
03:17 - different axes that we don't want the
03:20 - ball to either move or rotate in so
03:24 - right now we are only moving along the Y
03:28 - and the x axis so I'm just going to go
03:32 - ahead and check see so that it won't
03:37 - position itself on the z axis and in the
03:40 - rotation tab here we are actually only
03:43 - rotating on the z axis so I'm just going
03:46 - to go ahead and check X and y and now
03:49 - when we play the game we will still be
03:51 - able to move in the same directions but
03:54 - we are sure that the ball will never
03:56 - start rolling off cool so what we can do
04:00 - now is we can go ahead and begin with
04:03 - all the fun stuff so this was the basic
04:06 - introduction to rigid body constraints
04:08 - but radiant body can constraints can be
04:11 - useful for many things and here I'm
04:13 - going to go ahead and show you an
04:14 - example so we are going to go ahead and
04:17 - create a cylinder here and this is not
04:21 - going to be pretty by any means I just
04:23 - want to illustrate what you can do with
04:25 - these
04:25 - and then you can come up with some nice
04:28 - gameplay elements on your own so I'm
04:32 - going to rotate this on the x axis by 90
04:34 - degrees and I'm going to bump this down
04:37 - to here cool now let's get some of this
04:44 - stuff out of the way here and change the
04:48 - the positioning to global just move it
04:54 - over here and let's maybe do two of
04:58 - these right next to each other like this
05:02 - this is only to test it out so we're
05:04 - just going to move this closer to the
05:07 - center and then we can duplicate one of
05:10 - these platforms here and position it
05:14 - directly on top of the cylinder so we'll
05:16 - just choose both the cylinder and the
05:18 - platform and we'll give them a custom X
05:22 - value so let's see what we are going to
05:25 - need here something like 13 point 5
05:29 - let's do that great and then we can just
05:32 - move down the platform a bit here like
05:35 - this this looks nice we are going to
05:37 - rename this to rotatable tate able
05:47 - platform and then we are going to add a
05:51 - component a physics rigidbody and in
05:55 - here we are just going to freeze some of
05:57 - the positions so we're just going to
05:59 - leave everything like it is but we are
06:02 - going to freeze the let's see x y&z
06:06 - position we don't want this to move at
06:08 - all and then we are going to freeze the
06:10 - X and the y rotation so now this will
06:14 - only rotate along the cylinder so when
06:18 - we now play the game we can use this as
06:22 - a springboard so this gives us a lot of
06:26 - control over what our different
06:29 - rigidbody components do and will allow
06:32 - us to create interesting physics
06:33 - gameplay so please go ahead and
06:36 - experiment with this on your own and
06:39 - constrainted in every race - to make the
06:42 - game fun to play and you can of course
06:44 - also drag up the mass if you want this
06:46 - to be more difficult to move for the
06:48 - player or whatever you want to do so
06:51 - this was just an overall introduction
06:54 - great so now that we have the rotatable
06:58 - platform of the way let's actually just
07:02 - parent the let's see what how we're
07:04 - going to do this let's make a new game
07:08 - object let's go to game object create
07:10 - empty and let's call this springboard
07:17 - and then select the rotatable platform
07:22 - and the cylinder and let's drag them
07:26 - under the springboard and let's rename
07:28 - the rotatable platform here to just
07:30 - platform and the cylinder to base or
07:36 - axis us or whatever you want to do now
07:39 - let's break the prefab here because we
07:43 - don't want this to be be connected to
07:47 - the preforms prefabs from the other
07:49 - platforms and there's multiple ways to
07:52 - to break a prefab one of the ways is
07:56 - just to drag it down into a new one and
07:58 - then delete that one and it will be
08:01 - broken here so there's multiple ways to
08:04 - do this I just it's a bad habit but
08:07 - that's the way I do it and now we can go
08:10 - ahead and instead bring down our
08:13 - springboard as a prefab so we can
08:15 - distribute this around the scene and
08:17 - this again it's not pretty I just wanted
08:20 - to show you how this can be done so now
08:23 - we can go ahead and delete the
08:24 - springboard and we might revisit it
08:26 - later great so what we're going to do
08:30 - now is we're going to go ahead and
08:31 - create a we're going to go ahead and
08:35 - create a joint and basically there are
08:39 - different kinds of joints they are fixed
08:41 - hinge and Springs
08:43 - there are also some others like
08:45 - character joints but we're not going to
08:47 - look into those so these are the three
08:50 - most basic joints
08:52 - they're good for different things the
08:54 - fixed joint will make a game object try
08:57 - to position itself as much as possible
09:00 - and then you can give it values for when
09:02 - it will break the hinge the hinge
09:07 - component will be good for stuff like
09:11 - doors because you can give it certain
09:13 - axes that it will rotate around we could
09:16 - do we could have used this spring at the
09:19 - hinge component to do the spring board
09:21 - if we wanted to then of course there are
09:24 - Springs which are just like they sound
09:28 - you connect them to a certain position
09:30 - and then you give them values for
09:34 - dampening and spring values and they
09:37 - will be able to be flexed and Bend but
09:41 - they will always try to get as close to
09:44 - that position as possible so let's try
09:46 - to implement these and see them in
09:48 - action these descriptions of those
09:51 - components are of course not exact but I
09:54 - just wanted you to understand basically
09:56 - what they do so now let's try to
09:58 - implement them of course if you want
10:00 - more precise descriptions of what they
10:02 - can do and what the different values
10:06 - will do for these components please go
10:10 - ahead and just visit the unity scripting
10:13 - reference I try to stay away from those
10:16 - long and boring descriptions cool so now
10:20 - let's finally go ahead and implement
10:22 - some of this so let's go ahead and hit
10:25 - create game object and let's do a let's
10:31 - do a scaps Allah let's do a cylinder and
10:34 - for the cylinder let's first off scale
10:39 - this down in the Y so something like 0.2
10:45 - yeah this looks pretty nice and let's
10:48 - bring this upwards so we have some space
10:51 - for this and let's call this base then
10:56 - let's duplicate this game object move it
10:59 - down here and let's scale it down on the
11:02 - X to something like 0.2
11:05 - on the wire - something like 0.3 and
11:08 - under set the - 0.2 again so yeah this
11:13 - looks just fine what we can do is we can
11:15 - move this up so that it just barely
11:18 - collides with our base and we can go
11:24 - ahead and rename this to joint
11:29 - let's do Ghent one actually and let's
11:32 - hit add component physics and then let's
11:37 - see where is it spring joint let's also
11:40 - go to the base here and hit add
11:43 - component physics and then fixed joint
11:47 - you here you can go ahead and add a
11:50 - break force or a break torque for when
11:54 - this joint will break so how much weight
11:57 - needs to be applied to this before it
12:00 - will fall down since this is just
12:03 - floating in free air I'm not going to do
12:05 - any brake force but that's a option for
12:08 - you if you want to the rigidbody we are
12:11 - not going to connect everything because
12:13 - if you don't it will just try to stay at
12:17 - the position it was in when you hit
12:19 - place so basically the position you said
12:21 - in the scene here will be its fixed
12:24 - position now for the joint one here we
12:27 - have the spring joint component and this
12:30 - does a bunch of things first off let's
12:33 - bump up the spring to something like a
12:34 - hundred because we want this to be
12:36 - pretty tight then you can tweak stuff
12:39 - like damper minimum and Max distance I'm
12:42 - going to do max distance students to
12:44 - something like zero point one and I'm
12:46 - not going to make this able to break so
12:48 - this should give us a pretty nice joint
12:50 - for our setup here
12:51 - now let's duplicate this rename it to
12:54 - joint to drag it down a bit here and
13:01 - that looks pretty nicely now if I joined
13:04 - one we are going ahead and connect the
13:07 - base to a rigid body here so on the
13:10 - connected body simply select a base one
13:13 - then in join two we are going to connect
13:15 - joint one
13:17 - and should we do a third one we can do
13:19 - that so let's drag this one down and
13:24 - let's connect let's first rename it
13:28 - actually and then drag in joint two so
13:31 - as you can see we've made a chain of
13:34 - spring joints and now when we hit play
13:37 - it will look like this so as you can see
13:41 - they are not fully connected but you are
13:43 - able to use them just like in any
13:47 - reasonable chain so that's what a series
13:50 - of spring joints will look like that's
13:53 - of course really good for creating
13:55 - different gameplay elements but instead
13:58 - of spring joints let's use something
14:00 - else let's use what is called a hinge
14:03 - joint and this is much more restricted
14:06 - in the way that it moves and behaves you
14:09 - have much more control let hit let's hit
14:12 - remove component on all three joints hit
14:16 - add component physics and then go to
14:20 - hinge joint
14:21 - now let's chain up the rigid bodies once
14:25 - again so for joint one we'll do the base
14:29 - for joint - we will do joint one and for
14:33 - joint three we will do joint - now
14:36 - select all of them again so we can treat
14:39 - the parameters at the same time now
14:42 - we're going to do anchor instead of X
14:45 - which is the direction in which these
14:48 - orange arrows will point we want to do Z
14:52 - so that they will rotate only around the
14:55 - z axis so let's do one in the Z and we
14:59 - can see that the direction of these
15:01 - orange arrows has changed to the Z
15:06 - called the anchor we're just going to do
15:08 - y1 that's going to be just fine and now
15:11 - let's have a look at this this will be
15:14 - much better for the kind of game we are
15:16 - creating because first of all they will
15:18 - stay much closer they don't have that
15:20 - spring effect and also they will only
15:24 - move along one axis so let's now try
15:28 - ahead and see how this behaves whoops if
15:30 - I can jump up correctly and hit it there
15:35 - it was so you can see that this gives
15:37 - also a pretty nice effect it might not
15:40 - be as realistic in the way it moves but
15:43 - it it will do so of course there are
15:48 - there are pros and cons for both of
15:50 - these methods I just wanted to show you
15:53 - both of them and how they can behave and
15:56 - and such you can also just use the
16:00 - spring joints and then use constraints
16:03 - to only make them move certain ways or
16:05 - you can do some scripting it's all up to
16:08 - you it's this all becomes really fun
16:11 - when you start adding forces to change
16:14 - like this great then at last I'm just
16:17 - going to create a cube here and I'm
16:20 - going to move it over just so it's kind
16:25 - of right let's look at this from the
16:28 - y-axis here we can soup through actually
16:33 - let's put this into wireframe look at it
16:36 - from the y-axis from the bottom let's
16:39 - now hit this cube in the middle in the
16:43 - top right to switch into isometric view
16:46 - which will allow us to position this
16:48 - better now move it over just the way you
16:51 - wanted here and let's click back on the
16:56 - cube again here to make to change back
16:59 - into perspective and change back into
17:02 - textured now we can just scale this down
17:05 - on the x-axis to something like 0.3 and
17:10 - now we have a pretty cool chain that
17:14 - ends up with a it almost looks like a
17:17 - hammer actually here so this will be be
17:20 - fun to experiment with
17:22 - and please go ahead and add some forces
17:25 - through scripting oh yeah of course we
17:27 - also need to create a rigidbody buddy
17:29 - for this so let's go ahead and find it
17:33 - waste the cube there let's rename this
17:36 - to hammer let's add a physics
17:41 - rid let's do Hinch giant and let's
17:44 - connect the joint three and change the
17:48 - axes to one in the Z so now this will
17:51 - behave just like the other ones and we
17:54 - will have a pretty nice effect so let's
17:56 - see yes this indeed does wake cool so
18:00 - now let's go ahead and make this into a
18:02 - prefab so let's create an empty game
18:04 - object by pressing control shift and
18:06 - let's rename this to chain hammer thing
18:12 - II let's just do chain hammer and let's
18:16 - just move all of this under there and
18:20 - let's drag it down to make a prefab out
18:24 - of it so again we might revisit this
18:27 - later and use it but for now I just
18:29 - wanted to show you how it's done
18:31 - so let's go ahead and maybe just pull
18:35 - this back like it was before
18:38 - and let's save this out and that was
18:41 - pretty much it for this tutorial I hope
18:43 - you think that these new tools are fun
18:46 - to play around with of course there are
18:49 - more coming out also the pong tutorial
18:52 - series is I've just finished that so now
18:56 - I will have time to start another one
18:58 - which is really exciting so thanks for
19:01 - watching and I'll see you in the next
19:03 - video
19:06 - [Music]
