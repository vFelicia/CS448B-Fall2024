00:00 - so I started my game development journey
00:01 - in a pretty unusual way I think most
00:03 - people start making games because they
00:05 - have a bunch of ideas for a game that
00:06 - they'd like to make or ideas on how to
00:09 - improve one they're already playing I
00:10 - mean it's pretty tempting to sit down
00:12 - with the game and think I can do this
00:14 - better however I was completely opposite
00:16 - I'd never thought about game design or
00:18 - anything like that I just like making
00:20 - stuff and thought game development look
00:21 - fun so jump right from sandbox games
00:23 - into modelling coding and all that good
00:26 - stuff but as time has passed and I
00:28 - started making my own games I realized
00:30 - just how important game design really is
00:32 - so no matter if you like me and have
00:34 - been making games for a long time or if
00:35 - you're just starting out I think these
00:37 - basic tips on game design are really
00:39 - good to know but first this video is
00:41 - sponsored by Dennis pan Judah Dennis is
00:42 - an awesome game dove to do who's just
00:44 - launched a new course on udemy the
00:46 - complete c-sharp master class this
00:48 - course will make you super comfortable
00:49 - writing code in c-sharp and using it for
00:51 - programming your own games in unity it
00:53 - will give you knowledge on many
00:54 - different aspects of c-sharp and teach
00:57 - topics such as databases link in WPF and
01:00 - much more at the end of the course you
01:01 - will even have made three games on your
01:03 - own if this sounds like something you're
01:05 - interested in simply click the link in
01:06 - the description to get started and get a
01:08 - massive discount so often when making a
01:11 - game you start by setting a goal that
01:13 - the player has to achieve but how to get
01:15 - the player from the beginning of the
01:16 - game and towards that goal and most
01:18 - importantly how to get the player to
01:19 - enjoy this journey is where the tricky
01:21 - and also fun part comes into play now
01:23 - when it comes to game design it's very
01:25 - hard to define rules and guidelines that
01:28 - apply to all games simply because games
01:30 - are so different design choices that
01:32 - work for a MMORPG might not work at all
01:35 - for a competitive FPS and now comes a
01:37 - very important point everything in game
01:40 - design must fit the player's intended
01:42 - experience first off every game needs a
01:45 - foundation and in game design there are
01:47 - three main pillars that hold up this
01:49 - foundation player communication and
01:51 - appeal now this might seem obvious but
01:54 - understanding how to work with them is
01:55 - crucial really you can start by asking
01:57 - yourself what is the players role and
02:00 - how does he interact with the game the
02:02 - play always needs to have a purpose and
02:04 - it's extremely important that it's the
02:06 - player driving the game forward after
02:08 - all this is what distinguishes a game
02:10 - from
02:11 - if the player does not have a say an
02:13 - effect on the game he becomes an
02:15 - indifference simply completing tasks for
02:17 - the sake of it
02:18 - now just as important as giving the
02:20 - player purpose is communicating this
02:22 - purpose to the player without any idea
02:24 - of what the goal is and how to achieve
02:26 - it the player will quickly start to feel
02:28 - powerless and become bored so try to use
02:31 - the environment or leave visual clues
02:32 - that communicate the objective of a
02:34 - situation I've talked about this before
02:36 - but I think one of the most elegant
02:38 - examples of communicating purpose to the
02:40 - player is the beginning of half-life 2
02:42 - here the developers do an amazing job of
02:45 - showing a world of oppression and making
02:47 - the player feel part of that world
02:49 - making him want to change it of course
02:51 - none of this actually matters without
02:53 - appeal which is why it's the most
02:54 - important pillar in the foundation if
02:56 - the game doesn't appeal to the player
02:58 - then what's the point and for me this is
03:00 - the hardest thing to consistently
03:02 - achieve because it's solely based on a
03:04 - feeling of being drawn to the game and
03:06 - if wanting to play more and I think this
03:08 - can greatly vary depending on the game
03:10 - and even depending on the individual
03:12 - player for some the appeal is action
03:14 - paced realism with stunning graphics and
03:17 - heart-throbbing sound design for others
03:18 - the appeal lies in an interesting story
03:21 - or a well-thought-out puzzle and rather
03:22 - than try to make impossible claims as to
03:24 - how to make your game appealing I think
03:26 - this is a good place to stress just how
03:28 - important it is to start every game with
03:30 - the prototype to test out your ideas in
03:32 - a simplified format to see if the appeal
03:35 - is there of course if your entire game
03:37 - idea is based around stunning graphics
03:38 - and huge open world levels a simple
03:41 - prototype won't help you out much but if
03:43 - that's what you're going for you should
03:44 - already have these principles under your
03:46 - skin along with 200 employees of course
03:48 - so with that you've now established the
03:50 - foundation of your game but that's of
03:52 - course still a bunch of design choices
03:54 - you have to make for example just like
03:56 - it's important to always communicate the
03:58 - player's purpose it's just as important
04:00 - to always guide to the main focus in
04:03 - other words you need to clarify what the
04:04 - players should concentrate on of course
04:06 - not all games lead the player straight
04:08 - from beginning to end when Stanley came
04:10 - to a set of two open doors he entered
04:13 - the door on his left for these so called
04:15 - nonlinear games it's just as important
04:17 - that you leave the player with alternate
04:18 - choices like going on a little side
04:20 - quest detour from the main storyline and
04:23 - when it comes to guiding
04:24 - player through the game something I've
04:25 - realized is the importance of
04:27 - anticipation if used correctly
04:29 - anticipation will help prepare the
04:31 - player for what's coming this could be
04:32 - as simple as adding a charge of
04:34 - animation to your enemies allowing the
04:36 - player to react accordingly and not feel
04:38 - cheated by the game take for example the
04:40 - ending scene of half-life notice how
04:43 - sound builds up electrical sparks start
04:45 - flying and the camera starts shaking
04:47 - right before the explosion and actually
04:49 - the whole sequence with g-man talking to
04:51 - dr. Freeman can be seen as one long
04:53 - build-up and therefore anticipation to
04:56 - the explosion and end of the game
04:58 - another aspect that has the tendency to
05:00 - get overlooked since some might consider
05:02 - it obvious is that the events in your
05:04 - game have to behave in a logical way
05:06 - along with living up to the players
05:07 - subconscious expectations of the game a
05:10 - system design example of this could be
05:12 - when shooting something bullet holes
05:14 - should appear otherwise it won't live up
05:16 - to the players expectations
05:17 - obtaining the right sounds of the
05:19 - physical events is also very important
05:21 - the more sound is considered the better
05:23 - experience for the plate the events
05:24 - occurring in your game should also
05:25 - follow general physics of course some
05:27 - games change the rules of physics but
05:29 - they do so consistently and that's
05:31 - pretty much all this comes down to rules
05:33 - are rules
05:35 - so once these rules have been
05:36 - established for a game stick to them
05:38 - however remember that games can cheat as
05:41 - long as the player doesn't notice a good
05:44 - example of this is the AI in the Arkham
05:46 - games these guys are told not to turn
05:48 - around with Batman sneaks behind them so
05:50 - it allows the player to ambush them in
05:52 - general a lot of shooters will alter the
05:54 - AI to give the player some sort of
05:56 - hidden advantage that rewards a certain
05:59 - play style also it's generally good not
06:00 - to make them too sophisticated
06:02 - just in case they feel like turning on
06:04 - the human race now another important
06:08 - point is that dynamic is lost when only
06:10 - one change occurs at a time for me this
06:13 - is what makes competitive games like
06:14 - counter-strike interesting to play again
06:16 - and again even though you're always
06:17 - playing with the same weapons and on the
06:19 - same maps for example in order for the
06:21 - attacking team to successfully plan the
06:23 - bar can we say can we say that without
06:26 - getting demonetised
06:28 - so in order for the attacking team to
06:30 - successfully plant the pineapple many
06:32 - things need to happen at the same time
06:34 - one guy might throw a smoke over the
06:36 - wall to cover off defending players
06:37 - another might start sneaking around to
06:39 - flank while the rest of the team charges
06:41 - in each checking different angles in
06:43 - order to make sure everything is clear
06:45 - what the pineapple gets planted just as
06:50 - important as having enough happening in
06:52 - your game it's good to establish a
06:54 - natural sense of progression this means
06:56 - trying not to over stimulate or under
06:58 - stimulate the player to achieve this
06:59 - it's important to think about how you
07:01 - layout different events in your game one
07:03 - way you can do this is by spreading out
07:04 - the moments of high concentration vary
07:06 - between action-packed and more laid-back
07:08 - sequences and keep the number of changes
07:10 - happening according to the current pace
07:12 - of this situation I think the perfect
07:14 - example of this is the tower defense
07:15 - genre your gameplay is spaced out
07:17 - naturally by alternating between waves
07:19 - of enemies and building new towers and
07:21 - on top of that many games will vary
07:22 - between large waves of weak enemies and
07:25 - small waves of strong enemies but
07:27 - spacing is not something that only
07:28 - applies to gameplay it's equally
07:30 - important when talking about environment
07:32 - creating areas for the player to admire
07:34 - the graphics and expansive view in
07:36 - creating tidal areas to obtain a more
07:38 - claustrophobic feel changes the pace of
07:40 - the game and this in turn affects
07:41 - gameplay it's very important that you're
07:43 - aware of how much space you have in game
07:45 - and on screen to make sure you have the
07:47 - right amount of space for different
07:48 - scenarios this is also important if your
07:50 - game has AI or other players since they
07:53 - should be given the right amount of
07:54 - space so they can move around in a
07:56 - realistic way in fact if you want to get
07:58 - really nerdy about how you can shape
07:59 - your environments to help guide your
08:01 - player check out this amazing paper on
08:03 - structural composition patterns in 3d
08:05 - adventure games I'll be a link in the
08:07 - description so if you take all these
08:09 - things into consideration you should be
08:11 - one step closer to designing your own
08:13 - game keep in mind though everything I've
08:14 - mentioned here is only guidelines and
08:17 - guidelines only there to steer our
08:18 - creativity in the right direction the
08:21 - rest is up to you
