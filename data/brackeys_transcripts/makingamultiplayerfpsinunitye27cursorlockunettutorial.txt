00:00 - this video is brought to you by our own
00:01 - Metta thank you so much for donating if
00:03 - you want to support breakage yourself
00:04 - you can go to patreon.com/scishow cheese
00:06 - thanks for tuning in at brac ease hello
00:11 - everyone and welcome to this video and
00:12 - creating a multi-player fears in unity
00:14 - today we will do a bunch of different
00:15 - stuff so we'll be fixing some box we'll
00:18 - get rid of some warnings we'll be adding
00:20 - a cursor lock to the game so when we're
00:23 - not in some kind of menu and we're in
00:24 - actually playing we will get rid of the
00:27 - cursor and censored in the middle of the
00:29 - screen so it won't get in the way and
00:31 - we'll also be adding a joint room
00:33 - timeout so if you try to join a room but
00:35 - for some reason you aren't successful it
00:38 - will just count down from X amount of
00:40 - setting seconds and when it reaches zero
00:42 - it will just stop and say failed and you
00:45 - can try and join another one so yeah
00:48 - some exciting stuff also will mention
00:50 - that since the last video I have created
00:52 - a the first video in game theory which
00:55 - is patreon funded because we reached
00:57 - level two and I think it turned out
01:00 - really well this one is on vectors so if
01:02 - you're interested in that you can click
01:03 - the link now and without further ado
01:05 - let's jump right into it so you can see
01:08 - that I'm community and the first thing
01:10 - that I want to get rid of it's just all
01:12 - of these annoying warnings that are
01:15 - there as soon as we put up our projects
01:17 - and these are because of the
01:18 - cross-platform input initialized script
01:21 - that is part of the standard assets that
01:24 - we've imported so let's just double
01:26 - click that and basically in Visual
01:28 - Studio and this is super nice it
01:30 - underlines all of the all of the parts
01:34 - that we can just go ahead and get rid of
01:36 - so everything with these Green Wave's
01:38 - under them we're just going to remove
01:40 - that we can get rid of this one and
01:44 - these one and basically this doesn't
01:49 - really matter but if you want to get rid
01:52 - of the warnings this is the way to go
01:55 - it's because some of these like the vp8
01:59 - and blackberry are obsolete so let's
02:02 - just save that and you can see that that
02:04 - should clear out our console so that's
02:06 - really nice and another warning that I
02:09 - want to get rid of is when we go in here
02:11 - and create a game
02:12 - here and he created room you can see it
02:15 - says the reference script and this
02:17 - behavior is missing and that is just
02:19 - because if we go to our and find our
02:23 - prefabs and then the I believe it's the
02:27 - fire it's much it might not be under our
02:30 - prefab so let's just double-click this
02:31 - and it should select it so this is also
02:33 - under standard assets we should just go
02:35 - ahead and remove this empty script right
02:37 - there and I believe that that should fix
02:40 - both of them so now when we clear out
02:42 - the console here hit play and try and
02:45 - create another room here you can see
02:47 - that we have serial warning so that is
02:50 - perfect so the next thing that I wanted
02:53 - to do and I've actually gone ahead and
02:54 - compiled a little list here of things
02:56 - that I wanted to do so that was the
02:58 - warnings it's fix the host game
03:01 - disconnect buck and that basically means
03:03 - that if we try and hit play here and we
03:06 - want to create a room room and we hit
03:09 - create room and we then leave this room
03:12 - and try to host a new one test create
03:15 - room you can see nothing is happening
03:17 - here and the reason why is that we have
03:20 - now lost the connection from our modules
03:24 - host game create room button here you
03:27 - can see that the on click event here
03:29 - doesn't have any connection to any
03:31 - object and the reason why is that the
03:34 - functionality for that sits on our
03:36 - network manager and our network manager
03:39 - is transferred on to the next scene and
03:42 - so when we go back here it has lost that
03:45 - connection
03:45 - so what we will do instead is we'll just
03:47 - copy this host game component and remove
03:49 - it from the network manager and create
03:52 - an empty game object that will just
03:54 - reset the transform on and whoops if I
03:57 - can stop dragging out the lighting there
03:59 - and we will call this one host game and
04:01 - we can then just paste that component
04:05 - back in as new just the way that we did
04:07 - it with our join game and you can of
04:10 - course make those on the same object but
04:12 - I'll just go ahead and separate them out
04:14 - into two different ones and then under
04:16 - our canvas modules host game create room
04:19 - button we can now drag host game under
04:21 - that on click event go under host game
04:23 - and here
04:24 - create room and we'll have to do the
04:26 - same with the room name input so you can
04:28 - see there's also an on value changed
04:30 - here
04:31 - dragon host game go host game and then
04:34 - let's select the set room name as a
04:37 - dynamic string so we will pass in
04:40 - whatever is in the input field so that
04:42 - should indeed get rid of that bug there
04:45 - so now if we try and create a first room
04:48 - hit create room and we leave that room
04:51 - and try and create a second room here
04:54 - you can see that that now just simply
04:57 - works except it took a bit of time there
05:01 - but it actually works so that's fine
05:02 - cool so the next thing that I wanted to
05:05 - go ahead and do is fix the spawn bug and
05:09 - I'm actually going to add another thing
05:11 - here and that is the spawn menu continue
05:14 - button I think we should have one of
05:15 - those so now let's begin by fixing this
05:18 - spawn bug and what I'm talking about
05:19 - here will become very much more apparent
05:22 - if we go and find our main menu and we
05:27 - have the nice level here and we take
05:29 - find our spawn points here so focus in
05:32 - on those you can see that we have one on
05:34 - the ground here we have one another one
05:37 - on the ground here and then we have one
05:39 - on top of these platforms and it is when
05:42 - we spawn on top of these platforms that
05:44 - this bug becomes very apparent so let's
05:46 - just try and disable all of the other
05:48 - spawn points except that except for the
05:50 - third one here and let's see what
05:52 - happens if we now go back into our lobby
05:55 - and try and create a game let's try and
05:58 - create a test room here and you can see
06:00 - that we spawn on top of this but you can
06:02 - see that currently we are flying a lot
06:05 - higher above the ground that we normally
06:07 - would so we have this weird kind of
06:10 - offset position and the reason why is
06:13 - actually really simple it is that if we
06:15 - find our player and find our
06:17 - configurable joint component you can see
06:21 - that we have currently set it to auto
06:23 - configure connected anger and that means
06:25 - that the kind of the anger point from
06:29 - where we do all of our configure will
06:32 - join our calculations will be set
06:35 - depending on where I respond so if we
06:36 - spawn at a higher
06:37 - point it will be set higher and that is
06:40 - not something we want we want this to be
06:42 - fixed so we'll just remove that all
06:44 - right uncheck that and then we'll have
06:47 - the connected anger be zero one zero so
06:50 - that we will be anchored at one unit
06:53 - above the surface so if we now try and
06:55 - hit play here and this should actually
06:57 - work so let's just create a room here
07:00 - and you can see that we're now standing
07:01 - on the platform correctly and we jump
07:03 - down and everything seems to be working
07:07 - cool so that got rid of that bug and
07:11 - that was all for that cool so now we can
07:16 - go ahead and add a spawn menu into our
07:18 - or that is not correct I wanted to say
07:23 - add pause menu continue there we go so
07:26 - right now when we are in our game here
07:28 - if we go under our main level and we
07:30 - need to re-enable all of our spawn
07:32 - points here and we drag in our prefab
07:35 - player UI and we enable our past menu
07:40 - and let's shift to 2d mode and hit F to
07:42 - focus in on this you can see that we
07:44 - only have one button which is the lead
07:46 - room I basically want to add just
07:48 - another button that very simply
07:50 - continues the game instead of leaving so
07:53 - that we don't have to use the Escape key
07:56 - in case the user
07:57 - I don't know forgets or accidentally
08:00 - opens the boss menu and yeah it's just a
08:03 - cleaner way to do UI to have a button
08:05 - there as well
08:06 - so the first thing I want to do here is
08:08 - just bump down the redness of this
08:10 - button I think it's a bit too much
08:12 - something like that looks better
08:14 - and now let's duplicate this and we can
08:17 - rename this one to continue button and
08:21 - we can take this and drag it up to be
08:24 - right above and we can change the color
08:27 - here to something darker like a dark
08:30 - gray and let's go ahead and change the
08:32 - text as well here to continue we can
08:35 - select both buttons and we can maybe
08:37 - drag them down to center them and then
08:40 - we can take our continue button move it
08:42 - up here and let's now change this on
08:44 - click event so under our past menu is
08:48 - where we currently call a function
08:49 - called Lee
08:50 - room but we don't have a function in
08:53 - here for toggling the spawn menu or post
08:56 - menu I keep doing that on and off that's
08:58 - actually sits under I'll play a UI
09:00 - script so under I'll play UI you can see
09:03 - we have a toggle pass menu and all we
09:06 - really need to do is make this public
09:07 - for us to be able to go to a continue
09:10 - button and access it from there so if
09:13 - we're now dragging our player UI and
09:15 - going to play a UI and then whoops not
09:18 - send match message upwards I want to go
09:21 - toggle pause menu and it should actually
09:23 - be that symbol so if we now hit apply on
09:26 - this and remove the player UI again and
09:29 - hit and we cannot hit play directly we
09:32 - have to go through the lobby here so
09:34 - let's find a lobby here hit play and
09:36 - let's create a test room and when we now
09:39 - and we just have to wait for it to
09:42 - actually join here okay so okay I forgot
09:45 - to disable the post menu here so let's
09:48 - say find our player UI let's find our
09:52 - pass menu and we'll just have that
09:53 - disabled by default so let's hit play
09:55 - again here and try that out so create a
09:59 - room and when we go into the past menu
10:01 - now you can see that we can continue or
10:03 - leave the room and if we decide to
10:05 - continue we just jump right back into
10:07 - the game however you can see multiple
10:10 - problems with this at the moment one is
10:12 - that we are able if we open the past
10:15 - menu while holding down a key we'll keep
10:18 - moving that in that direction and also
10:20 - the same with the mouse so if I drag
10:22 - around here and over the past menu you
10:24 - can see that we don't lose that momentum
10:26 - so let's fix that along with adding in a
10:30 - cursor lock which was also the next
10:34 - point here cool so in order to do this
10:36 - what I want to bring up is our player
10:39 - and find the player controller so in Hue
10:43 - undo our update method we have a check
10:46 - to see if the past menu is currently on
10:49 - what I want to do is right below this
10:51 - that means whenever we aren't past I
10:54 - want to check to see if our cursor is
10:57 - locked and if it is not then we should
10:59 - go ahead and lock it right away
11:01 - so I'm going to go if
11:03 - and then we can go cursor dot a lock
11:07 - state and if that is not equal to cursor
11:11 - lock mode dot locked and you can see we
11:14 - have three options here we have confined
11:16 - which means that well the curse is
11:19 - confined to the game and window but it
11:21 - can move anywhere inside the game window
11:23 - we have locked which basically just sets
11:25 - it to the center of the game we know and
11:27 - we have none which means that it can
11:30 - move as it wants to so if it's not
11:32 - locked then we want to say cursor dot
11:36 - lock state equals cursor mode or cursor
11:40 - lock mode locked there we go and if we
11:44 - are past so if past menu dot is on well
11:48 - then we can go ahead and disable that so
11:49 - let's we still want to return from all
11:51 - of this but right before we return we
11:54 - can say if cursor lock mode or cursor
11:59 - dot lock state is not equal to cursor
12:04 - lock mode none well then we want to set
12:08 - cursor dot lock state equal to cursor
12:14 - lock mode dot none there we go so and of
12:18 - course this check is somewhat
12:20 - unnecessary you could just go ahead and
12:21 - set it but it's just a bit cleaner not
12:25 - setting it every single frame but one
12:27 - thing that we will have to set every
12:29 - single frame is motored odd move is what
12:32 - we can then say and then we can pass in
12:34 - vector 3.0 and that just means that we
12:38 - will stay in place and we'll do the same
12:40 - with motor rotate vector 3.0 and
12:45 - remember we also had a separate function
12:47 - for rotating the camera up and down so
12:49 - we'll have a motor rotate camera and
12:52 - that only takes in a float which is
12:54 - going to be serum so this will allow us
12:56 - to stay in place so if we now try and
12:59 - hit play here and join a room and test
13:03 - room you can see our cursor immediately
13:06 - disappears so that's perfect if I escape
13:08 - here it comes back and you can see that
13:11 - that just works and also if we try and
13:14 - move our camera here you can see that
13:16 - immediate
13:17 - stops when we hit the passkey and if we
13:20 - try and move it the same thing happens
13:22 - so that is perfect and that is working
13:26 - cool so I believe that was all we wanted
13:30 - to do with the cursor the last thing
13:34 - that I wanted to add in this video is a
13:36 - joint game timer because currently we
13:39 - are using the matchmaking system that
13:42 - unity gives us the Unity matchmaker and
13:45 - that's working fine however one annoying
13:48 - thing is that when you try and when you
13:51 - create a room and you the host then
13:53 - leaves making that room not joinable and
13:56 - you then try to reconnect or other
13:59 - clients try to reconnect just after the
14:01 - host leaves the room won't be cleaned up
14:04 - so it will still appear under the join
14:06 - room list here but it's not actually
14:09 - joinable and it won't cost any errors
14:11 - but it will just say joining joining
14:13 - joining pretty much forever until you
14:17 - hit the refresh button and I think that
14:19 - is bad UI so instead we should tell the
14:21 - user what is going on by having some
14:24 - kind of countdown and when it reaches 0
14:27 - will say failed and then we'll return to
14:29 - everything to normal so the way to do
14:32 - this is by going on to our joint game
14:34 - script and double click that and we will
14:36 - find the function down here called join
14:39 - room and this is basically called
14:42 - whenever we hit one of the whenever we
14:47 - select one room that we want to join
14:48 - this this here is cold and we can see
14:51 - that we join the match we tell the
14:54 - network manager dot match maker to join
14:56 - the match then we clear the room list
14:58 - and we set status text equal to joining
15:00 - so let's expand upon this a bit and in
15:03 - order to give ourselves some more
15:05 - control with waiting and stuff like that
15:08 - let's also go up here and use our import
15:12 - system dot collections so this allows us
15:15 - to use an ienumerator
15:16 - so let's do that so let's create an
15:19 - enumerator here and let's call this on
15:22 - wait for join
15:25 - and in here we can clear the room list
15:29 - and we can set the status text and we
15:32 - can also make sure to call it here's
15:34 - let's say start co-routine wait for join
15:37 - whoops wait for join there we go and
15:42 - basically I want to go in here and say
15:44 - wow and we want to do this using an
15:48 - integer so let's have an integer with
15:51 - the countdown and we'll let the Ryan
15:54 - alpha testing will set this to five but
15:56 - I definitely recommend that you go at
15:59 - least 10 seconds and my experience is
16:01 - that at least for joining on the same
16:03 - network unit normally waits at least 5
16:06 - seconds before joining that is a bit of
16:09 - time but that just means that you have
16:12 - to adjust for it inside of this variable
16:14 - so if you set it to 5 it is going to say
16:17 - failed and then join and that's going to
16:19 - be weird so instead just put at least 10
16:22 - seconds in here is what I recommend so
16:26 - we'll have this countdown that starts
16:28 - off at 5 and we'll say that we want to
16:30 - continue trying to join while the
16:33 - countdown is greater than zero so when
16:36 - we haven't reached zero we want to keep
16:38 - on counting and status that text here
16:41 - let's move that into the wall and then
16:43 - what we can do here is we can add a bit
16:45 - of code so we can say joining and then
16:47 - we can input the countdown variable so
16:50 - we'll just put a an open parenthesis
16:54 - we'll have the countdown and then we'll
16:56 - have a closed parenthesis and and that
17:00 - is going to look just fine and then
17:02 - we'll have to of course subtract the
17:04 - count down here so minus minus so that
17:07 - we will subtract by one and we'll also
17:10 - have to wait a bit in here so let's put
17:13 - in a yield return new wait for seconds
17:16 - and we'll just wait one second exactly
17:20 - so to explain what's going on here we
17:22 - call join match we start this enumerator
17:24 - we clear the room list we set and we
17:28 - create an integer variable that starts
17:30 - at 5 then we say while this countdown
17:34 - variable hasn't reached zero we want to
17:36 - display the countdown
17:39 - and tell the user that we're currently
17:41 - trying to join and then we want to wait
17:44 - a second and then we want to subtract
17:46 - one and then we want to go back here so
17:48 - then display again wait a second
17:50 - subtract by one until we reach zero at
17:53 - which point if we haven't connected we
17:55 - failed and if we have well then we don't
17:58 - reach this part of the code then we have
18:00 - transitioned to a new scene so that is
18:02 - not something we have to account for so
18:04 - if we get reach this place down here we
18:07 - actually failed to connect and we can
18:10 - show this in multiple ways one way is to
18:13 - just go status dot text equals and then
18:18 - failed to connect and let's just make
18:24 - sure that we display this for a little
18:26 - while so that the user will be able to
18:28 - notice what is going on so let's just
18:30 - wait one second after that and then we
18:32 - can refresh our room list there we go
18:38 - so this should actually work just fine
18:41 - and my cat demands some attention so I
18:43 - would be right back
18:45 - look here he was kind of getting mad
18:47 - because he couldn't jump on the table by
18:49 - himself so now he's up here I might jump
18:52 - on the keyboard at some point but we'll
18:54 - continue the video so we should actually
18:56 - be able to test this inside of unity now
18:58 - so if we go back into unity and hit play
19:00 - and try and host a new game here so
19:03 - let's just call the room test hit create
19:05 - room and let's leave that room and then
19:08 - let's try and rejoin which shouldn't be
19:10 - able to happen so we can see it says
19:13 - joining five four three two one and then
19:16 - it should say fail to connect and it's
19:18 - going to refresh that list however it
19:22 - might say failed to connect and refresh
19:24 - the list but the request that we sent
19:27 - for joining the match might still be
19:29 - running in the background now it's not
19:31 - specified by unity exactly how they
19:33 - handle these requests but it might still
19:36 - be running and you can see there it
19:37 - dropped the connection on its own right
19:40 - to the room and you can see that
19:42 - actually also comes with an error so
19:44 - what we'll do here is we'll make sure to
19:46 - drop the connection and we'll make sure
19:48 - to check if our matchmaker is running to
19:52 - get rid of
19:52 - weird behavior so um in order to do this
19:56 - let's use the code inspired by our past
19:58 - menu for leaving the room so we'll just
20:01 - take this here and copy it inside of our
20:04 - drawing game right before we refresh our
20:07 - room list here so if we fail to connect
20:09 - we want to get some matching flow from
20:11 - the UH network manager and we want to
20:14 - input an if statement here is saying if
20:16 - match info is not equal to null because
20:19 - this might actually be equal to null and
20:21 - if it is we don't want any weird
20:23 - behavior and if it's not equal to null
20:26 - meaning that we do have some match info
20:28 - we want to drop the connection to that
20:30 - using matching photon network ID
20:33 - matching for node ID and then calling
20:35 - network manager dot on drug connection
20:37 - and then we also want to make sure to
20:39 - stop the host so um let's just save that
20:43 - code and that should work just fine
20:44 - however one thing that we still need to
20:47 - do is get rid of this weird behavior
20:49 - here when refreshing the room list so up
20:52 - by where we refresh room list here we
20:57 - clear the room list and then we go on to
21:00 - list the matches but what we really want
21:03 - to do is we want to make sure that if
21:05 - network manager done matchmaker is equal
21:10 - to null then we want to start the
21:14 - matchmaker so the matchmaker might have
21:16 - been terminated at this point and we
21:18 - need to make sure to restart it in case
21:21 - that happens so start matchmaker
21:23 - and there we go so that should actually
21:26 - take care of all of this for us and you
21:28 - can see it's basically the same code as
21:29 - we wrote up here and now everything
21:32 - should run smoothly so we can maybe set
21:35 - this count out to ten instead so that
21:37 - everything works properly and let's now
21:40 - try and build this out and see if we are
21:43 - totally error-free on both clients so
21:45 - let's build the player here and I think
21:49 - this will work I'm pretty sure this will
21:53 - work and let's try to play on the unity
21:57 - editor here create a test room and that
22:00 - is working that's now of course we have
22:03 - to login on our client here so let's
22:05 - just log in with
22:06 - test123 it log in there and we should
22:09 - transition over to the lobby we can join
22:11 - this game just fine and you can see it's
22:13 - attempts to join here and it says six
22:15 - five and then it should join there we go
22:18 - and we can disconnect from this and we
22:21 - can rejoin if we want to or let's say
22:23 - that we try and leave this room and then
22:26 - try and reconnect here so let's try and
22:28 - reconnect on these two you can see it's
22:29 - still there so we can still attempt to
22:31 - connect but um it's not going to happen
22:34 - and it's going to reach zero here and
22:37 - it's going to say failed to connect and
22:39 - it's going to refresh the list and you
22:41 - can see that the game is still there but
22:43 - it will be cleaned up in a second and if
22:46 - we keep on doing this for about thirty
22:48 - seconds we should see at last that the
22:51 - game disappears but it might just take a
22:53 - little while so it says fail to connect
22:56 - again here and you can see at the moment
22:58 - now if we had refresh it says no roams
23:00 - at the moment because the room has now
23:02 - been cleaned up so that is a much much
23:05 - cleaner way of doing things we cannot
23:07 - help unity clean up these rooms but we
23:09 - can at least make sure that people don't
23:11 - get stuck trying to connect to a room
23:13 - that isn't there so that's basically all
23:16 - I wanted to show for this video I hope
23:18 - you enjoyed it and I will see you in the
23:20 - next video thank you so much to all of
23:22 - the awesome patreon supporters who
23:24 - donated in August and the special thanks
23:26 - to our own Metta Robert Roach
