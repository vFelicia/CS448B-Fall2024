00:03 - no everyone will come to this bonus
00:06 - video in our survival game series done
00:09 - by Brad keys I am the CEO Frankie's and
00:11 - in this video we're gonna take a look at
00:14 - how to download input and used the
00:17 - survival game assets which you can
00:20 - download from our website for free so if
00:23 - you've if you think you are stuck in a
00:26 - matter you can't get the scripting to
00:28 - work or if you just want to use some of
00:30 - the sounds or models or something like
00:33 - that used in the videos you can always
00:35 - get them for free on our website so I am
00:39 - making this video because you guys
00:41 - requested me to do so alright so if you
00:45 - already know how to import the assets
00:47 - are not really interested in them you
00:49 - can just go ahead and skip this video
00:50 - it's all we're gonna cover here so first
00:54 - of all let's go to our website so open
00:56 - up your browser and you can see that I
00:59 - am here and practice calm and first I
01:03 - want to mention before we get started
01:05 - that these things are available for free
01:09 - and so we do not profit off of them if
01:12 - you want to support what we do you can
01:14 - always go to the donate section and you
01:18 - can decide completely how much you want
01:20 - to donate and if you want to at all but
01:23 - of course we would love it if you did
01:26 - and if you don't that's completely fine
01:29 - too
01:29 - so now let's go ahead and hit the
01:32 - download survival assets button which is
01:35 - located in the middle of the homepage
01:37 - I'm thinking about redesigning the
01:40 - website a little bit but it should like
01:42 - somewhat somewhat similar in the future
01:45 - it's you you can also click on the
01:47 - banner here to get into our survival
01:49 - game series page and download them from
01:53 - there but hit the download asset use a
01:55 - used button this shouldn't take more
01:57 - than a couple of minutes and I have
02:00 - downloaded it already here you go so
02:03 - this version is the version 8 survival
02:08 - assets 8 and when you just download the
02:12 - assets they
02:13 - in a compressed format to be more
02:16 - specific they are in a dot RAW format
02:19 - and the dot raw or raw what every
02:24 - however you want to say it it's used for
02:29 - making folders into just one file so
02:33 - that's what I've done here and so you
02:36 - would need to decompress or uncompress
02:39 - the file before we can use the assets
02:42 - and this is done using a program that is
02:45 - free to download so if you're on a Mac
02:48 - you could go ahead and find the program
02:51 - in the app store called an archiver or
02:55 - if you're on a Windows computer like I
02:59 - am now you can go ahead and search for
03:02 - winrar and from the role apps and
03:05 - download the version that fits your
03:08 - computer and so when you have done that
03:10 - it shouldn't be harder than
03:12 - right-clicking the file and hit the
03:15 - extract to survival assets zero eight
03:18 - and now Vinh raw will create a folder
03:22 - for us called survival assets and on the
03:26 - Mac it should be pretty much as easy I'm
03:29 - sure there are plenty of guides on how
03:31 - to do it it's just opening the file with
03:34 - an archiver and it will do the same so
03:37 - if we double click the survival assets
03:39 - whoops actually two folders now then you
03:43 - in that case you can just go ahead and
03:44 - hit the extract here instead so inside
03:49 - of this we have quite a few things we
03:52 - have quite a few folders so first one is
03:55 - audio and inside of the audio folder you
03:59 - will find stuff like the music that we
04:03 - used and the town ambience which is also
04:07 - used in the game and inside of the GUI
04:10 - we have a Photoshop file containing the
04:12 - crosshair inside of the imports we have
04:16 - all of the different UVs and textures
04:19 - used for the weapons and models and then
04:23 - we have a folder called materials
04:25 - containing all of the day
04:27 - from material data for the different
04:29 - models and then we have both the FBX
04:34 - files for import into unity if you don't
04:37 - have Maya or if you have Maya you can
04:40 - just use these Maya files and you can
04:43 - then also edit them inside of Maya so
04:48 - keep in mind that you can always make
04:51 - changes to the models that we use and
04:54 - that I create and everything you get in
04:58 - this pack feel free to use it for both
05:01 - the commercial and just educational
05:04 - purposes you can make a profit off of
05:07 - these as long as you don't state that
05:09 - they you are the one who made them so
05:13 - okay so we have the scripts folder which
05:15 - should be pretty self-explanatory and
05:18 - then the different textures so as always
05:20 - I've opened up unity and here we are and
05:23 - to import stuff in here all you have to
05:27 - do is go and find the element you want
05:30 - to import
05:31 - for example the crosshair and then just
05:35 - drag it in and there you go and then you
05:38 - can fiddle around with the import
05:41 - settings this is a crosshair so we want
05:43 - to change it to GUI and hit apply and
05:46 - now this should wake just as well as the
05:49 - one I used in the video so if you are
05:53 - uncertain about how you would import the
05:56 - different assets go back and watch the
05:59 - different videos I should explain most
06:01 - of it under the imports we have the
06:06 - different models and in here these are a
06:10 - little harder to understand so I'm just
06:12 - gonna quickly show you how I would do
06:14 - this so I would go into the unity and
06:16 - create a new folder just to make sure
06:18 - that I have everything inside of in just
06:22 - one place and I would call this well I
06:25 - would call it imports for now let's just
06:27 - call it test and then double click it
06:30 - and then we can go ahead and import
06:34 - let's say we want to import the doors so
06:39 - I will take the door you read
06:40 - UV normalmap the wall all of these and
06:44 - drag them in and then unisza will
06:49 - process it and imported itself and if
06:53 - you are having problems it can be a good
06:54 - idea not to drag them in but instead
06:56 - right click in the project pane hit the
06:59 - import import new assets and then find
07:02 - them and import them and then let's go
07:06 - into the FBX files and drag in the door
07:10 - and there you go
07:13 - unity has pretty much taken care of
07:15 - everything and this might be because
07:17 - I've done this before but let me just
07:20 - show you how I would set this up so I
07:22 - would change the scale factory depending
07:25 - on how big the door is when I drag it in
07:29 - so if I just drag this into the scene
07:32 - you can see that the door is way too
07:34 - small so I would select it in the
07:38 - project pane and change the scale
07:40 - factory to something like 1 or is 0.5
07:45 - let's try that now it's actually pretty
07:49 - huge but it's close enough so the rest
07:52 - we can just scale inside of unity and
07:54 - there you go and if you're having
07:58 - problems with naming and stuff don't
08:03 - name them inside of the project pane
08:05 - name them inside of unity instead so
08:08 - that's or inside of the scene instead so
08:12 - that just name this door wall and the
08:17 - other one we would then name door door
08:21 - sorry I know and and so this would work
08:25 - and a good thing to remember is that
08:29 - unless you are importing something with
08:32 - with animation which we don't have here
08:34 - we create the animations inside of unity
08:37 - so it's a good idea to hit the object
08:41 - and run the import settings go under
08:43 - both Rick and hit none and then apply
08:47 - and then animations and uncheck the
08:49 - import animation and just really be
08:53 - careful
08:54 - with these settings take a good look at
08:56 - them and and so this should work really
09:03 - fine and then using you could create
09:05 - some colliders inside of unity which we
09:08 - also have a tutorial on called mastering
09:11 - collision and that's basically it for
09:13 - the videos guys for some of you this
09:16 - might have been really self explanatory
09:19 - but I've just gotten a bunch of
09:22 - questions asking me on how to do this so
09:25 - I thought I would clear things up and so
09:28 - there you go I hope you enjoyed the
09:30 - video and I'll see you in the next one
