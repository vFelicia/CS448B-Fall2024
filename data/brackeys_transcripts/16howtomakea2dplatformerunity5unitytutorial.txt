00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello and
00:04 - welcome to video number 16 in the how to
00:07 - make a 2d platformer course in today's
00:09 - video we're going to take a small break
00:11 - from all of the coding and upgrade our
00:14 - project to the all-new unity 5 so if you
00:19 - are fully confident in your ability to
00:21 - do this on your own and fix any errors
00:24 - if there are some please just skip this
00:27 - video I just wanted to really show you
00:29 - how to do this because some might find
00:32 - it a bit scary to do themselves so
00:36 - that's what we're going to be doing
00:37 - today I'm also going to talk a bit about
00:38 - what the new features are and how we
00:41 - might want to use them in our project
00:43 - and we're also going to update the
00:46 - a-star pathfinding project folder
00:48 - because that's a bit outdated so that's
00:50 - what we're going to do today and again
00:53 - if this is not interesting to you to
00:55 - skip ahead on to the next video where
00:58 - I'm sure we're going to be doing more
00:59 - enemy stuff cool so as always if you
01:03 - have any questions throughout this video
01:05 - go over to firmed up practice to come to
01:08 - get your questions answered so unity
01:11 - just released unity 5
01:13 - they've been hinting at it a lot and
01:16 - there's already a lot of content on it
01:18 - out there but of course we're going to
01:22 - be using it in this tutorial series and
01:25 - I might also do a new series
01:29 - specifically covering things in unity 5
01:31 - if that's something you want to see
01:33 - leave a comment in down below because I
01:37 - really want to know if that's something
01:39 - you're really interested in or if I
01:41 - should put my focus elsewhere but
01:44 - without further ado let's first off open
01:46 - up our browser head over to unity 3d
01:49 - comm you can see that right now they are
01:52 - showing off unity here so we can simply
01:54 - hit the get unity 5 button or he'd get
01:58 - unity up here and the unity is now split
02:01 - up into well two additions for normal
02:05 - indecent studios then you also have for
02:07 - Enterprise Education and all that but
02:09 - for most people it can be split up into
02:11 - two additions
02:13 - the personal edition and the
02:15 - professional edition and the big change
02:17 - here is that the personal edition will
02:20 - now feed now has all engine features so
02:25 - stuff that wasn't usable before such as
02:28 - soft shadows different rendering
02:33 - techniques image effects writing
02:37 - textures there what else was there
02:42 - that's a lot of stuff streaming asset
02:44 - asset bundles all the kinds of stuff
02:46 - that was before a pro feature is now
02:49 - included in the personal Edition so all
02:52 - that the unity that that really changes
02:56 - about the unity engine from the personal
02:58 - and the professional Edition is stuff
03:00 - like analytics and that kind of external
03:04 - supports on some cloud building the team
03:07 - license of course then you have the
03:09 - theme and then the customizable splash
03:12 - screen so but for most most people
03:16 - personal addition is going to be just
03:18 - fine so let's hit free download there
03:19 - and you can download the Installer here
03:21 - I've already done that and I've already
03:23 - installed unity so once you have done
03:27 - that click double click unity 5 and it
03:30 - will prompt you with the new opening
03:32 - screen here where you can either create
03:34 - a new project or open another one and
03:36 - what I want you to do now is just go
03:39 - ahead and make a backup of your project
03:42 - as is
03:43 - so head over to Dropbox or wherever you
03:46 - have it stored find the project I have
03:49 - it here simply control C or and then
03:52 - paste it elsewhere or if you're using
03:55 - some kind of version control system such
03:57 - as kid I suggest you go ahead and make a
04:00 - commit now so once you've done that
04:03 - simply hit open other then navigate to
04:06 - your folder find it here select folder
04:09 - hit upgrade and it's gonna do some
04:12 - calculations now I'm just gonna make
04:14 - sure that my Dropbox syncing is past and
04:20 - just tell it that you've made a backup
04:22 - so just go ahead and update the API
04:25 - because inside of
04:27 - unity itself some API things have
04:30 - changed so that means that some of the
04:33 - ways that we write code has changed in
04:36 - unity and this is mostly to do with the
04:40 - gate component stuff now you don't have
04:43 - these easy accessors such as transform
04:47 - or such as a rigidbody with a small R
04:50 - instead you have to do get component
04:52 - rigidbody just to make things more clear
04:57 - but it's going to go ahead and update
04:59 - that for you and in a sec it's gonna
05:02 - open up our project here so this is what
05:04 - it looks like unity 5 if you have some
05:08 - text rendering issues with that which I
05:10 - had when I tried this out before simply
05:13 - can restart unity and it it should work
05:17 - but let's just dig right into it let's
05:21 - try and hit play just maximize some play
05:24 - for now and see if this works and indeed
05:28 - it does we actually have no compiler
05:30 - errors which is really awesome that
05:33 - means that we can focus on some of the
05:35 - cool stuff that and that has come with
05:37 - unity 5 one thing I want to go ahead and
05:40 - do though is just update ad a star path
05:43 - finding project it might prompt you to
05:46 - do this when you open it up it might
05:48 - have a big green Update button if it
05:50 - doesn't which it did not in my case
05:53 - sometimes that for some reason doesn't
05:56 - really happen all you need to do is
05:59 - delete the folder we should see an arrow
06:01 - here yeah saying that it cannot find the
06:05 - name space because we've just deleted it
06:06 - then go on to the internet and search
06:10 - search for a star path finding and
06:14 - whoops not very peachy here we're gonna
06:16 - go to the official website which is this
06:18 - one and we're gonna go and download it
06:22 - and we're gonna download version 3.6
06:24 - it's going to download here open it up
06:28 - in this sit file navigate through the
06:31 - folder and just publicly the unity
06:33 - package and it's gonna import it inside
06:36 - of unity simply hit import and it's
06:39 - gonna do all of the hard stuff
06:40 - so let's just wait for this to correctly
06:43 - import and it's gonna be ready about now
06:46 - cold and again here an API update is
06:50 - required so simply say that you made a
06:52 - backup and just go ahead and update it
06:54 - and it's gonna do that and in just a sec
06:57 - it's gonna be done there we have it it
07:02 - removes the errors and there we go so
07:05 - now the project here is fully updated
07:08 - and are ready to use and if you don't
07:11 - believe me you can of course hit play
07:12 - and see that this is indeed working so
07:16 - that was pretty much everything that we
07:18 - need to do in this video what I want you
07:21 - to just take a moment to show you now is
07:24 - what this has actually changed about our
07:27 - project first off its done some up quite
07:30 - a few actually optimizations behind the
07:32 - scene stuff like instantiating prefabs
07:35 - is much easier on the computer now so
07:38 - you can be a lot more free about when
07:41 - you instantiate things also it made some
07:46 - a few changes to the API as I told you
07:49 - which we are probably gonna run into at
07:52 - some point and a really cool thing it
07:56 - did this was before a pro feature but of
07:58 - course this is now in the personal
08:00 - edition is that when we had play right
08:04 - now what it actually does behind the
08:07 - scene is it takes all of the different
08:11 - sprites here all of the different
08:13 - sprites that we have in our scene and it
08:16 - combines them into one latch texture
08:19 - which is called the sprite atlas as we
08:21 - talked about and what this does it's it
08:25 - is it basically saves us a whole bunch
08:27 - of draw calls you can see our calls and
08:31 - they are much much fewer than the word
08:35 - before actually I ran ran a test and
08:38 - right before upgrading I had a draw call
08:42 - count of about 34 and now it's it's
08:48 - actually under 10 and draw calls
08:51 - optimizing draw calls will reel
08:54 - save out on a computer rendering time
08:57 - especially on mobile devices so that's a
09:00 - really awesome thing to have free now
09:02 - another cool thing that I want to show
09:05 - you and I'm really going into the 2d
09:07 - stuff here because the 3d stuff such as
09:10 - global illumination and the whole new
09:12 - lighting system physically based
09:14 - rendering and all that there's been
09:16 - plenty of courage on that so I just
09:18 - wanted to keep it really specific for
09:22 - this tutorial another thing that is cool
09:24 - that we can now have our image effects
09:26 - so if we head over to our camera we can
09:31 - actually add some image effects on to
09:33 - this so let's right-click our project
09:36 - hit import package and go into effects
09:39 - and it's just gonna start importing here
09:42 - so we'll wait for that
09:44 - that's quite a lot of importing and and
09:47 - processing going on in this video that's
09:49 - okay and it's gonna import all of the
09:52 - different image effects and that's
09:54 - created by unity but really you can use
09:57 - any third-party effects now you can find
10:00 - some on the internet and just drag them
10:01 - in this was of course before a pro
10:04 - feature and now we can select our camera
10:07 - hit add component go into image effects
10:11 - and you can see we have all kinds of
10:14 - cool stuff here first off you'll notice
10:16 - that if we go under camera and he hit
10:19 - vignette and chromatic aberration this
10:21 - is an effect I really like on 2d games
10:24 - we can do a cool camera Vic Ned and of
10:28 - course you can bump this to whatever you
10:31 - want I want something like 0.6 maybe
10:36 - just to give it that cool fall-off
10:40 - around the edges I think that looks
10:43 - pretty good we have some fall-off
10:44 - already in our background but it's nice
10:47 - to have it on the other elements as well
10:49 - and what you can also do if you want to
10:52 - is you can blur out the corners you can
10:54 - see if I really exaggerate the effect
10:56 - what it does and I just want to do this
10:59 - a tiny bit we also have the blur
11:01 - distance and I'm we are not gonna miss
11:06 - too much with that I
11:07 - think 0.75 is actually quite fine
11:12 - but the amount is gonna be bumped down
11:14 - quite a bit here so let's see what looks
11:17 - nice I will try I think even one is too
11:22 - much less let's try a 0.3 yeah that just
11:26 - gives it a very subtle cool smoothing
11:29 - effect make it makes it look kind of
11:32 - futuristic which is of course what we
11:34 - are going for or at least what I am
11:37 - going for and yeah you can play around
11:40 - with the rest of the image effects we
11:42 - are definitely going to be using some at
11:45 - least I hope for example if our we are
11:48 - going to implement some shooting some
11:50 - cool they're shooting effects like if
11:53 - we're gonna have to need so something
11:54 - then the bloom effect would be really
11:56 - awesome and this is in general a really
12:00 - cool effect that you should have a look
12:02 - at I mean you can just adjust the
12:04 - threshold here and then make some cool
12:06 - flashing so that's a really awesome one
12:09 - another really cool looking one is the
12:13 - grayscale effect so if we're gonna color
12:16 - adjustments select grayscale you can
12:18 - just create out the image it's it's that
12:21 - symbol and one and that you're probably
12:24 - going to be using a lot is under color
12:26 - adjustments and then color correction
12:28 - curves and you can see right now it
12:31 - looks really bad but if we go in here
12:33 - and change all these to the linear
12:35 - prefab or it preset it's gonna look just
12:40 - as it did before that's gonna be no
12:42 - change and then you can change the
12:44 - saturation manually you can change the
12:47 - red tones and how they fall off so
12:49 - create some interesting effects here you
12:51 - can of course edit this just the way you
12:54 - wanted to just wanted to show you what
13:00 - this looks like so really have a lot of
13:04 - fun with this it's it's super awesome
13:06 - but for now I'll just leave the vignette
13:09 - on there of course if you are rendering
13:11 - actually I want to bump down the
13:13 - blurring to something like 0.2 if you
13:16 - are publishing planning to publish to a
13:19 - mobile device and would come
13:21 - leave effects out of the picture yeah or
13:26 - at least not overdo it
13:28 - cool so that was another cool feature
13:31 - another thing I just quickly want to
13:33 - mention is that we now have an audio
13:34 - mixer but you see here and we can go
13:38 - ahead and create a mixer here later and
13:40 - where you can mix all of the different
13:43 - audio channels and that's gonna be
13:45 - really handle and handy once we start
13:47 - making music for our game and really
13:51 - mixing all of the different sounds
13:52 - together I'm just gonna close down this
13:55 - tab here and delete it delete this
13:58 - folder here that was something I was
13:59 - messing around with earlier
14:01 - it's an the UPA toolkit the pixel art
14:05 - toolkit that I've made I've just tried
14:07 - to implement it here I think we're gonna
14:09 - be using it in a later video and then at
14:13 - last we have the profiler and this is
14:15 - actually really really cool
14:16 - because what the profiler does is it
14:19 - allows us to have a look at what
14:23 - basically a breakdown of our application
14:27 - what takes time on the CPU the GPU what
14:31 - stores what uses a lot of storage in
14:33 - memory is the physics system doing too
14:37 - much it really breaks down our
14:39 - application and allows us to find just
14:42 - the places in in our game that needs our
14:46 - attention when it comes to performance
14:48 - so if we click here to open up the
14:52 - profiler and just dock it here what
14:55 - we're gonna do is we're going to make
14:57 - sure that it's set to record then we're
14:59 - just gonna play through a tiny bit of
15:01 - our game and maybe just jump around do
15:04 - some shooting and then fall down wait to
15:08 - respawn and now let's stop this we can
15:13 - go through the profiler and you can see
15:15 - that it made this timeline and this is
15:17 - actually functioning in real time but I
15:19 - just wanted to play through and then
15:22 - show you this but you can of course dark
15:24 - it down here and then what just watch it
15:26 - go as you play through you can see that
15:29 - it makes this timeline where you can see
15:33 - all of the different
15:35 - that make up your game and the spikes in
15:38 - when they are using a lot of resources
15:40 - and for each frame if we focus on that
15:45 - say this frame you can see what took a
15:48 - lot of time and what required a lot of
15:51 - computer attention so to say so what we
15:54 - can do here is we can turn off vsync
15:56 - here that's the yellow part that's not
15:58 - really important for us we can turn off
16:01 - others we can even turn off rendering
16:04 - physics and all of that to only focus on
16:08 - the scripts and this really allows us to
16:11 - see exactly where when and how it spends
16:15 - a lot of time executing the script that
16:17 - we have created so let's see we have a
16:20 - spike here and that's in the behavior
16:23 - update you can see that a star is here
16:26 - spending quite a bit of time it's
16:30 - actually 12 milliseconds on updating the
16:35 - route that we are that the enemy is
16:38 - taking and then we are pretty flatlined
16:41 - and soon until we hit another spike here
16:43 - where I can see a star spending a lot of
16:46 - time so it's it's very clear to us here
16:49 - that the thing that is really spending
16:51 - and the computer resources a script wise
16:55 - is da star path finding algorithm and
16:58 - that's of course shouldn't come as a
17:01 - shock doing these calculations path
17:04 - calculations is pretty taxing but once
17:07 - you start expanding on your game it's
17:10 - really easy to narrow down what exactly
17:12 - is slowing your came down using this
17:14 - profiler so that's something you should
17:16 - really get used to using so I'm just
17:18 - gonna turn back on all of this and we
17:23 - can see here I'm just gonna close down
17:25 - the profiler and that was basically it
17:28 - for this video all I wanted to talk
17:31 - about was just how to setup unity how to
17:35 - update it and or set up unity 5 how to
17:39 - update to unity 5 and kind of what it
17:42 - allows us to do so in the next video we
17:45 - are definitely going to be scripting
17:46 - some more we're gonna get
17:48 - back into it but this was just in case
17:51 - and you guys hadn't heard about all of
17:54 - this new interesting stuff that is now
17:56 - available to us so thanks for watching I
17:59 - hope you enjoyed it and let's and I'll
18:02 - see you in the next video thanks
18:07 - [Music]
