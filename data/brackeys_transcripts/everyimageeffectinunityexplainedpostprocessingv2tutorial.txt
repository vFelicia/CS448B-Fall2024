00:00 - post-processing is a huge part of making
00:02 - a good looking game to those who are
00:04 - unfamiliar with the term post-processing
00:06 - basically means image effects that we
00:08 - can apply to change the look of our game
00:09 - usually you add post-processing as a
00:11 - nice last touch to your game but
00:14 - sometimes it can even be used to create
00:16 - a completely different look we've
00:18 - created a video on post-processing
00:19 - before but since then it's been
00:21 - completely revamped
00:22 - and it's now easier than ever so in this
00:24 - video we'll have a look at how you can
00:25 - add post-processing to your game and
00:27 - we'll also go over each individual
00:29 - effect to give you a good idea of what
00:31 - you can do with it but first this video
00:33 - is sponsored by ambience V our ambience
00:36 - we are are the creators of the amazing
00:37 - unity plugin 80 explore this plugin is
00:40 - designed to allow artists and architects
00:42 - to create interactive environments
00:44 - without worrying about coding it
00:45 - provides you with the series of visual
00:47 - tools to manage cameras and interactions
00:49 - with a few clicks you are able to create
00:51 - interactive environments for Android iOS
00:53 - PC oculus CO and quest and open VR
00:57 - devices the plugin also comes with
00:58 - prepackaged interactions like material
01:01 - switching working doors windows and
01:02 - drawers and a visual scripting system
01:04 - the team is made up of architects and
01:07 - computer engineers who are always ready
01:09 - to help so if this sounds interesting to
01:10 - you simply click the link in the
01:11 - description to get started now before we
01:14 - get into it we have to mention that
01:15 - post-processing is a little bit
01:17 - different depending on if you're using
01:18 - qrp or HDR P the workflow is pretty much
01:21 - the same but HTTP does offer some more
01:23 - advanced effects in this video we'll
01:25 - focus on your P since that's the most
01:28 - commonly used and most of what you learn
01:30 - here should just apply to HDR P as well
01:32 - and with that said let's jump into it
01:34 - and play around with some colors so as
01:36 - you can see we are here in unity 2000
01:38 - 19.3 and the demoscene we are using here
01:41 - is the RPG poly pack light which is free
01:44 - on the asset store will of course have a
01:46 - link for that in the description now to
01:47 - add post-processing we first have to
01:49 - create a volume to do this we right
01:52 - click in the hierarchy go on to volume
01:53 - and select global volume this object is
01:56 - responsible for adding post-processing
01:58 - to our camera but first we have to
02:00 - create a profile we do this by simply
02:03 - clicking new as you can see this creates
02:05 - a profile object that we can add effects
02:07 - to in unity effects are called overrides
02:10 - if we click add override we get a list
02:13 - of effects to
02:13 - from let's just add a vignette as you
02:17 - can see all that the effect properties
02:18 - are blurred out this is because we can
02:21 - choose what settings we want to
02:22 - influence if for example we want to
02:24 - adjust the intensity we simply check the
02:26 - box next to intensity and adjust the
02:28 - slider to whatever we want
02:29 - now at this point you might be confused
02:31 - as to why nothing is happening at least
02:34 - I was until I found this secret magic
02:36 - button hidden in the camera under
02:38 - rendering settings you won't believe how
02:42 - long it took me to find this setting
02:44 - well moving on another thing to enable
02:46 - is HDR which you can find under your
02:49 - render pipeline settings HDR stands for
02:52 - high dynamic range and it's a way of
02:54 - packing more color data into your image
02:56 - this gives us greater control over the
02:58 - look of the scene when we start applying
03:00 - image effects and helps us avoid
03:01 - clipping where you lose color
03:03 - information in very bright or dark spots
03:05 - and that's it for setup of course the
03:08 - new post-processing stack is using a
03:09 - volume system this allows us to blend
03:12 - between different profiles on the fly
03:14 - depending on the cameras position this
03:16 - is great when you want different effects
03:18 - in different areas such as when going
03:20 - underwater or inside a cave instead of
03:23 - unity we can choose between either
03:24 - global where the camera is always
03:26 - affected or local which allows you to
03:29 - select a Collider to use as the area for
03:31 - the volume this means that the camera is
03:34 - only affected while inside the area now
03:36 - with that explanation out of the way
03:38 - let's make things pretty there are a lot
03:41 - of effects supported in U or P so we'll
03:44 - split them into a few categories to make
03:45 - things a bit easier to grasp color
03:47 - correction lens stuff camera and there
03:52 - of course times times for all the
03:54 - effects in the description if you're
03:55 - looking for something in particular now
03:57 - let's start with color correction the
04:00 - tone map your maps colors from HDR color
04:03 - space to something the monitor can
04:05 - display here you have two options
04:07 - neutral which has minimal impact on the
04:10 - colors it is a great starting point if
04:12 - you want more control when colour
04:13 - correcting or aces which is an industry
04:16 - standard tone map reef achieving a more
04:18 - cinematic
04:19 - look I'll throw a link in the
04:20 - description if you want to know more
04:22 - about how aces works just remember that
04:24 - you should always use some kind of tone
04:26 - maverick
04:27 - when you have HDR enabled white balance
04:30 - allows you to adjust the color
04:31 - temperature to shift the colors to a
04:33 - blue cold or yellow warm you can use
04:37 - tint to do the same thing but between
04:39 - green and purple fun fact it's actually
04:41 - called the white balance because on real
04:43 - cameras you adjust this until the white
04:45 - parts of your image actually look white
04:47 - and not weirdly colored under different
04:49 - lighting conditions color adjustment is
04:52 - used to tweak the overall color
04:54 - brightness and contrast of the image
04:56 - this one is pretty self-explanatory but
04:59 - it will give you a quick tip I find that
05:01 - using the ASIS tone mapper while also
05:03 - increasing the post exposure a bit often
05:06 - gives a really nice and bright
05:07 - appearance the channel mixer allows you
05:10 - to tint the red green and blue color
05:12 - channel you can adjust the influence of
05:14 - red green and blue for each channel to
05:17 - be honest I don't find this one very
05:19 - intuitive so I don't use it a lot but
05:21 - it's there if you need it
05:23 - now color curves is a very versatile
05:26 - tool the most common use case is to
05:28 - adjust the luminance of the image if
05:30 - you've ever used the curves adjustment
05:32 - in Photoshop you already know what this
05:34 - does the x axis of the graph represents
05:37 - input luminance and the y axis
05:39 - represents output luminance in other
05:42 - words you can remap the luminance at
05:43 - different intensities at the lower left
05:46 - side the input luminance is 0 so
05:48 - completely dark and top right is 1 aka
05:52 - max brightness if we lift the key up the
05:54 - dark parts of the image will become
05:56 - brighter with this we can create curves
05:58 - that remap luminosity just the way we
06:00 - want and this applies for each Channel
06:03 - as well if you want less red in the
06:05 - highlights we can simply go to the red
06:07 - Channel and turn it down now that's the
06:09 - basic use case but unity has more tricks
06:12 - of its leaves you might have noticed
06:14 - that there are four additional curves to
06:16 - select in the drop down these that you
06:18 - control brightness and color in
06:20 - completely different ways I won't go
06:22 - into detail with all of them but I will
06:23 - show you a couple of cool use cases I
06:26 - stumbled across for example I think the
06:28 - sky in this scene could use a bit more
06:30 - color so I'll select the hue versus
06:32 - saturation curve here we can adjust the
06:34 - saturation at a specific hue in my case
06:37 - that is light blue so let's turn that up
06:40 - a bit
06:40 - that's better now I don't really like
06:43 - the color of the sky either I would like
06:45 - it to be a bit more deep blue so let's
06:47 - fix that as well the hue versus hue
06:50 - curve works the same way but instead of
06:52 - increasing saturation we instead adjust
06:55 - a hue at a specific you a color so let's
06:57 - isolate blue again and adjust it perfect
07:01 - another cool effect you can make is a
07:03 - color splash effect in other words the
07:06 - image is completely grayscale except for
07:08 - one color we can do this by going into
07:10 - the hue versus saturation curve and
07:12 - turning everything down as you can see
07:14 - the image is now grayscale now we
07:17 - isolate the color we want and turn that
07:18 - all the way up so I'll select green to
07:21 - make the grass and trees stand out you
07:23 - can even go ahead and hue shift it as
07:24 - well to get even crazier as you can see
07:27 - these sky's the limit with this one get
07:30 - it because we can adjust the color of
07:31 - the anyways shadows mid-tones and
07:34 - highlights allows you to separately
07:36 - control the tint and brightness of the
07:38 - shadows mid-tones and highlights of the
07:39 - image you can also define the ranges of
07:41 - each this is just a very intuitive tool
07:44 - for color grading lifts gamma and gain
07:47 - works just like shadows mid-tones and
07:49 - highlights but instead of letting you
07:51 - define the ranges it instead uses the
07:53 - ASC CDL color grading standard that's
07:57 - right PhD in acronyms over here I find
08:00 - that the colour grading from this
08:01 - produces more natural results than
08:03 - shadows mid-tones and highlights now
08:06 - that could really use an acronym split
08:09 - toning works by teaming the shadows and
08:10 - highlights two specific colors this
08:12 - often produces a very stylized effect
08:14 - however a cool thing here is that you
08:16 - can adjust the balance between the two
08:18 - tints using a slider what if I told you
08:22 - that everything we just went over can be
08:24 - accomplished with a single effect that
08:27 - is the color lookup table a lot for
08:30 - short here unity looks at every pixel
08:33 - and changes its color based on the
08:35 - supplied LUT file so here's how to do it
08:37 - number one take a screenshot of a scene
08:40 - from your game number two import the
08:43 - screenshot into the photo editor of your
08:44 - choice
08:45 - I'm using Photoshop here you do all the
08:48 - color adjustments that you need number
08:50 - three apply the same adjustments to a
08:52 - neutral lot and save it as a PNG
08:54 - this is now your Lud file and number
08:57 - four assign the load file inside of
08:59 - unity and voila you see now looks like
09:01 - the edited photo alright that's it for
09:04 - color settings now let's look at some
09:09 - bloom let's bright areas bleed into the
09:12 - surrounding pixels or in other words it
09:14 - makes bright areas glow the threshold
09:17 - determines how bright an area should be
09:18 - for bloom to be applied without HDR a a
09:21 - threshold of one would mean that only
09:24 - completely white areas would have bloom
09:25 - applied but now that we are working with
09:27 - HDR areas can have values greater than
09:30 - one which is very useful because it
09:32 - gives us full control over how much
09:34 - something should glow we can control the
09:36 - overall intensity of the bloom using the
09:38 - intensity property and the spread of the
09:40 - glow by adjusting this scatter the bloom
09:43 - effect also has a lens third option this
09:45 - overlays a texture on the bloom
09:47 - simulating stuff like smudges or
09:49 - scratches on the camera lens we'll have
09:51 - a link to some free lens toy textures in
09:53 - the description that you can use
09:55 - chromatic aberration splits the colours
09:58 - around edges of the game view into their
09:59 - red green and blue channels this is
10:02 - normally seen in low quality camera
10:04 - lenses but is now often used to create a
10:06 - cool distorted look film grain overlays
10:10 - classic film noise onto the image for a
10:12 - cinematic feel you RP comes with a bunch
10:14 - of different grain types but you can
10:16 - also supply your own
10:17 - vignette targets the edges of the game
10:20 - view this is also often seen in low
10:22 - quality camera lenses but it is now
10:24 - being used for a dramatic effect a lot
10:26 - here you can control intensity color
10:28 - smoothness and yeah it's pretty
10:30 - self-explanatory now onto some camera
10:33 - lens effects depth of field simulates
10:36 - focus this means that everything that
10:38 - isn't at a certain distance from the
10:40 - camera gets blurred out here you can
10:42 - choose between Gaussian which uses a
10:44 - common image blur technique to create a
10:47 - pretty cheap and quick depth of field
10:48 - effect or bouquet which much more
10:51 - accurately simulates the way light
10:52 - behaves when entering a real-life camera
10:55 - lens here you can adjust real camera
10:57 - properties such as focal length and
10:58 - aperture to get the look you're going
11:00 - for
11:02 - motion blur simulates deployed that
11:04 - occurs when a real camera is moving what
11:06 - the shutter is open
11:07 - this essentially stretches the light in
11:09 - the direction of the movement which
11:11 - makes it feel more natural and smooth
11:14 - lens distortion distorts or curves the
11:17 - image this allows you to create effects
11:18 - such as fisheye and what I've personally
11:20 - named the hyper speed effect panini
11:27 - projection corrects perspective cameras
11:29 - with high fov this helps reduce
11:31 - stretching in the corners of the screen
11:32 - as well as keeps vertical lines strict
11:34 - this one gets a bit wonky when used with
11:37 - moving cameras might be great for a
11:39 - drunk character though finally we have a
11:41 - few more settings to look at these
11:42 - however are located on the camera itself
11:46 - feathering applies noise to the image to
11:48 - prevent larger patterns when
11:50 - encountering quantization errors even
11:52 - though modern screens can produce some
11:54 - million colors that's not always enough
11:57 - especially in dark areas so did the ring
12:00 - helps eliminate some of the artifacts
12:02 - anti aliasing helps to reduce jagged
12:05 - edges
12:06 - it adds interpolation to smooth out
12:08 - stairs stupid lines at the moment there
12:10 - are two options FXAA and SMA a FXAA
12:15 - is more performant while SMA has better
12:17 - quality some of you might have noticed
12:19 - that there's also another setting with
12:21 - the name anti-aliasing this one is
12:23 - located under the rendering pipeline
12:25 - settings this is a third type of
12:27 - anti-aliasing called msaa and it can be
12:30 - applied on top of the other
12:31 - anti-aliasing methods to really make
12:33 - sure that those lines stays smooth let's
12:36 - pretty much it for this video if you
12:37 - liked it make sure to subscribe and
12:39 - bring that notification Belzer don't
12:40 - miss the next one and hopefully that
12:42 - gave you a good base to start using
12:44 - these effects in your game
12:45 - well of course have some links in the
12:46 - description to where you can learn more
