00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello and
00:04 - welcome to this video in creating a
00:05 - tower defense game in unity today we are
00:07 - going to start making our shop we'll be
00:09 - creating the UI for it doing a bit of
00:11 - scripting and also tying it into the
00:13 - build manager script to select what
00:15 - chart to build next we're not going to
00:18 - be creating currency for the game just
00:19 - yet but that is definitely to come so
00:22 - without further ado let's dive right
00:23 - into it so as you can see I'm here in
00:25 - unity and what I want to begin with is
00:27 - kind of sketching out the UI of our shop
00:30 - so there are many ways of creating some
00:32 - kind of shop or purchase menu and one
00:36 - common way is just to overlay a huge UI
00:39 - element on top of the screen but what I
00:42 - want to do is have the current map
00:45 - layout available to the user while he
00:48 - two chooses what to build so I
00:51 - thought that we would instead of just
00:52 - overlaying a huge piece of UI have the
00:55 - different turrets available down here at
00:57 - the bottom of the screen so let's do
00:59 - that start by selecting the canvas and
01:01 - marking it as pixel perfect I've already
01:04 - done this
01:05 - I just noticed a few minutes ago that we
01:07 - hadn't done this when creating the wave
01:09 - countdown timer and it's a good idea to
01:11 - check that just to make sure that your
01:13 - elements will stay crisp at any time now
01:17 - let's right-click our canvas go on the
01:19 - UI and select arm panel and the panel is
01:23 - just in a wide image that stretches to
01:26 - fit our entire screen now let's select
01:29 - 2d and hit f2 focusing on the panel and
01:32 - let's now scale it down on the Y here
01:35 - just bring it down something like there
01:38 - that looks fine let's also make sure
01:40 - that it scales on the x axis so when
01:44 - every we make our UI smaller on the X or
01:48 - our screen smaller on the X it scales
01:50 - with it but on the Y we don't want it to
01:53 - do that you can see currently it will
01:54 - just get to zero and then have a
01:57 - negative scale and that's not something
01:59 - that we want so instead let's just take
02:01 - these two anchor points here and bring
02:04 - them down or you can just click over
02:07 - here to make sure that they snap to the
02:09 - bottom cool so once we have this in
02:11 - place we can right
02:12 - on the panel go under UI and create a
02:15 - button and the button here is going to
02:19 - act as our turret so we can click on
02:23 - that chart element in order to purchase
02:26 - or select that turd so this is going to
02:29 - be our on shop turret our item and we
02:37 - will have different shop tart items for
02:39 - different turrets at the moment we only
02:42 - have one the standard turret but in the
02:44 - future we'll have a missile turret and
02:46 - maybe something that slows the enemy and
02:48 - stuff like that and for now we'll just
02:51 - use the default look of the button will
02:52 - change that in just a moment but what I
02:54 - want to do is instead of laying out
02:57 - these manually every time we add a new
03:00 - button so we would have to make room for
03:01 - another one here when we made a new one
03:03 - and then keep on doing that let's make
03:06 - unity do this automatically and we do
03:09 - that by selecting the panel and let's
03:10 - just rename it while we add it to shop
03:13 - and adding a component called the
03:17 - horizontal layout group and this will
03:20 - just make sure to stretch all of our
03:23 - different elements parented to the shop
03:25 - to fit the shop object so if I make
03:28 - another shop third item and another one
03:32 - you can see that they are resized and
03:34 - repositioned so that they fill out the
03:36 - entire shop object however we don't
03:40 - necessarily want them to be stretched I
03:42 - just want them to be positioned and then
03:44 - have every item be some kind of fixed
03:47 - size I want them to be about 100 500
03:51 - pixels and then have unity place them
03:54 - for me so in order to do this we simply
03:56 - disable a child force expand on the
04:00 - width and hide and you can see that
04:02 - makes them super small and the reason
04:04 - why is we need to go into these and I'll
04:06 - just select all of them to edit them all
04:08 - at once and add what is called a layout
04:11 - element and the layout element allows us
04:14 - to choose a preferred width and height
04:16 - in our case that's going to be a hundred
04:19 - by a hundred so you can see that working
04:23 - already excuse me and what we want to do
04:25 - now
04:26 - is just have these snap to the very
04:29 - center of our shop you can see currently
04:31 - they align by the other left corner
04:34 - instead we want the middle Center so you
04:37 - can see that already looks much better
04:39 - then what I want to do is go ahead and
04:41 - just disable the image of our shop you
04:44 - can have some kind of background image
04:46 - some kind of dying if you want to it's
04:49 - completely up to you but I will just go
04:51 - ahead and disable that entirely um so we
04:54 - have these three buttons and let's just
04:56 - let's just delete the two other ones and
04:58 - focus on the first one here and the idea
05:01 - that I had for this is that instead of
05:03 - using the default UI sprite let's have
05:06 - an icon that represents our turd and now
05:11 - a billion different ways of creating
05:12 - icons you could also just use the text
05:15 - as is here and just call it the standard
05:18 - turd and that would be fine you could go
05:20 - in and hand draw something in some kind
05:23 - of art program or you could just take a
05:25 - screenshot of the turret that you've
05:27 - created in our case we have a prefab
05:30 - here called standard turret we could
05:32 - just throw that into the scene take a
05:35 - screenshot and if you want to be really
05:37 - cool about this you can remove the
05:40 - background from that screenshot so we
05:42 - have an arm and a turret on a
05:45 - transparent background and I think that
05:48 - will look super cool for what we're
05:49 - doing here kind of what we have down
05:52 - here actually and this is a very easy
05:54 - way thing to use for screenshot so let's
05:57 - just select the standard turret let's
06:00 - expand this here and you can expand it
06:03 - in any any way you want and get a nice
06:06 - angle on this and then bring up whatever
06:09 - you use to take screenshots and in case
06:12 - you're using Windows we'll be using the
06:13 - snipping tool also commands to do this
06:16 - click new and then click and drag to
06:19 - take a screenshot something like that
06:22 - and you can save that and if you are on
06:24 - a Mac you can use command shift 4 and
06:27 - you can then choose a region of the
06:29 - screen and take a screenshot of that and
06:31 - then you can import it into some kind of
06:35 - image editing software I use Photoshop
06:39 - as my
06:40 - third software and remove the background
06:42 - and I've gone ahead and done that
06:44 - already so you don't have to if you are
06:46 - using the same model as I am and it's in
06:50 - the tower defense assets pack download
06:51 - link is in the description and if we
06:55 - double click that after you downloaded
06:57 - it and unwrapped it and go under sprites
07:01 - you can see that we have this standard
07:03 - turd icon and I've gone ahead and added
07:06 - whoops you cannot see it on the black
07:07 - background but you can see it here and
07:09 - now that turned black of course and we
07:12 - knows why you're doing this but I've
07:13 - actually added a small drop shadow to
07:17 - this as well and just play it around
07:19 - with the lighting to make it look really
07:21 - nice so you can see we have the PNG file
07:23 - here that you can just go ahead and use
07:25 - or in case you're using Photoshop and
07:27 - want to copy my settings or change
07:29 - something I've included the Photoshop
07:31 - document as well so you can edit that if
07:33 - I want to and if you have Photoshop
07:36 - installed I recommend that you just
07:38 - import the Photoshop file into unity
07:41 - that will work just fine and then you
07:42 - can easily edit it so but I'm just going
07:45 - to be using um or you should use PNG if
07:48 - you don't have it and in my case I'll
07:50 - use the Photoshop version let's take
07:52 - this drag it in the unity and let's just
07:54 - drag it into our project here and we can
07:58 - go in here and we can rename this I want
08:01 - to just get rid of the PSD there there's
08:04 - no reason for it to state that inside of
08:05 - unity we can then change the texture
08:08 - type to sprite 2d and you I go down here
08:10 - and select 512 by 512 which the image is
08:14 - already and change this to true color we
08:18 - don't want any compressing a compression
08:20 - on that image then hits let's hit apply
08:23 - and you can see that it's here on a
08:25 - transparent background so that's perfect
08:28 - and now this is ready to use in our game
08:31 - so we can find a shop chart item and we
08:33 - can drag this into our UI sprite here
08:36 - our source image and now boom it's
08:39 - changed so that's a super easy way and a
08:42 - really cool looking way of creating a
08:45 - cool icon to use for pretty much any
08:49 - kind of shop item if you're creating an
08:51 - inventory system or another and
08:53 - RPG or something this is a very common
08:56 - way of creating item icons so we can
09:00 - just take our text here and disable that
09:02 - we might use that lady to display the
09:04 - name or the price but for now we'll just
09:07 - have it disabled and everything else
09:09 - should be working and the cool thing
09:11 - about doing it this way is that if we
09:13 - hit play now you can see that our object
09:16 - will actually get tinted both when we
09:19 - hover over however that is kind of
09:21 - subtle and when we click it it will also
09:25 - notice that it gets highlighted after we
09:27 - click it and then we have to click away
09:28 - in order to dehy light it and that's
09:31 - because we have to change our navigation
09:33 - to none because we're using a mouse to
09:35 - navigate with and we don't want to be
09:37 - able to shift between UI elements using
09:39 - the arrow keys or a controller cool and
09:43 - we can maybe take the highlighted color
09:45 - here which is your hover over color and
09:48 - just make that a bit darker just to make
09:50 - it a bit more apparent to the user that
09:53 - he is able to click this cool so I think
09:55 - that looks super cool and we'll keep on
09:59 - looking cool when we create more of
10:00 - these so let's take this and drag it
10:03 - down into the prefabs folder in order to
10:06 - make a prefab out of it so the next
10:10 - thing that we are going to be doing is
10:12 - hooking this up to some kind of shop
10:15 - script and we'll have to of course
10:17 - create that first let's find our shop
10:20 - let's hit add component and make a new
10:22 - script called shop cool let's double
10:27 - click this to open it up in visual
10:29 - studio and it opened up on my secondary
10:31 - monitor so here it is and let's remove
10:33 - the using system data collections our
10:35 - name space and we can go ahead and
10:38 - remove the two other methods for now at
10:40 - least as well and what we want to do
10:43 - here is have to a public void called mmm
10:47 - let's say purchase standard turret and
10:51 - this will be able to be called from our
10:55 - art UI element because we have it public
10:58 - here and this will communicate with the
11:01 - build manager and also with your
11:04 - currency amount and stuff like that late
11:07 - in order to make sure that you select
11:09 - that turret and we're able to build it
11:12 - do you have enough money for it and will
11:14 - subtract the amount of money that it
11:16 - takes and it will also handle different
11:18 - UI things such as maybe removing or
11:23 - closing down the shop when you have
11:26 - selected a turret until you place that
11:28 - toilet and then it will open back up the
11:31 - shop stuff like that but for now we'll
11:33 - just have it in here as a base and we'll
11:35 - just put a debug block here standard
11:39 - turd purchased okay and we can go ahead
11:44 - and duplicate this if we want multiple
11:47 - turrets so we can just make another one
11:49 - here maybe called purchase another
11:51 - turret and this will very soon be a
11:54 - missile turret or something like that
11:55 - but another turret purchased and you can
11:59 - have multiple on methods in here so
12:02 - let's just use that for now and it's
12:04 - very easy to hook UI elements up to that
12:07 - script here what we simply do is we find
12:10 - a shop chart item we add an on-click
12:13 - event we drag our shop into that and go
12:16 - on to function shop and then find the
12:19 - method that we want to call in our case
12:21 - we want to call the purchase standard
12:24 - turd and everything else look great so
12:27 - let's hit apply on that and now when we
12:30 - are go in here and hit play
12:33 - and click our turret it will say
12:36 - standard turd purchased so that's
12:38 - perfect
12:39 - and we can go ahead and create more of
12:41 - these let's just have two in here and
12:42 - have this be um this is the shop chart
12:46 - item this is the second one so we can
12:48 - make this D maybe a standard third item
12:52 - and we can make this the another third
12:55 - item something like that and we can go
13:00 - in here and make a Col purchase another
13:05 - chart instead and we can maybe just tint
13:08 - this a bit just so we know that it's a
13:11 - different element and you can go in here
13:13 - now and press the first one and it will
13:16 - say standard chart purchased and press
13:18 - the second one and it will say another
13:20 - chareth purchased so that is indeed
13:22 - working and it's very easy now for us to
13:25 - add new charts to the game okay so this
13:29 - the last part of doing this is actually
13:32 - selecting that turret and if we go ahead
13:35 - and find our build manager I actually
13:40 - just want to correct this a bit because
13:42 - I think we should make the distance
13:43 - between these two UI elements a bit
13:45 - greater so let's go in here and select
13:47 - the shop and add a bit of spacing excuse
13:50 - me I have to take a sip of water for
13:53 - this okay and we're ready to go so let's
13:57 - just add a spacing of something like 10
14:00 - pixels just to move them a bit further
14:02 - apart that's a lot better
14:05 - and I'll just because I don't like
14:06 - looking at it Crane and remove the color
14:09 - there as well and now let's find our
14:13 - game master find our build manager and
14:15 - double-click it to open it up in Visual
14:17 - Studio and you can see that we have a
14:19 - bunch of things in here the first one is
14:22 - the awake method that was just for
14:24 - handling the singleton instance and we
14:27 - have all of that up here then we have
14:29 - our public game object which stores are
14:31 - standard toward prefab so that at the
14:34 - start of the game we can make sure we
14:36 - have that selected I think what we
14:39 - should do instead is remove that so that
14:43 - we don't select this at the start of the
14:45 - game and then have it only be selected
14:48 - when you actually go and press that
14:51 - chart item and we can go in here and add
14:54 - another prefab so this will be another
14:57 - turret prefab and we can make sure that
15:03 - we can select that as well so you can
15:05 - actually choose what to build cool
15:09 - and that all seems fine and then what we
15:13 - can do is we can add another method in
15:15 - here one called
15:16 - public void and this will be the set
15:20 - turret to build so this can be called
15:23 - from other methods and it will change
15:26 - what chart we want to build and we want
15:29 - of course to pass in a game object chart
15:34 - and it will set chart to build equal to
15:38 - whatever was passed in and the cool
15:41 - thing now is we can head into a shop and
15:44 - we can create a reference to a build
15:46 - manager and we have that by using build
15:48 - manager that instance but let's just
15:50 - make sure that we cache this up here
15:52 - just to make things a bit simpler
15:55 - simpler to read so we'll add the in the
15:58 - start method we'll set our a private
16:00 - build manager variable equal to build
16:03 - manager instance and then when we
16:06 - purchase this standard turret we will
16:08 - still write out standard toy purchased
16:10 - and then we'll say build manager dot set
16:14 - turret to build and then we'll use the
16:18 - fact that we have access to that chart
16:21 - so we'll say build manager dot standard
16:23 - turret prefab so it will set the turret
16:27 - that we want to build to the standard
16:29 - turret and we will do the same down here
16:31 - so under the another turret purchased
16:34 - will say build manager dot set chart to
16:37 - build build manager dot another charted
16:40 - prefab and this should actually work
16:44 - however currently at the beginning of
16:48 - the game our chart to build will be null
16:51 - and we don't want to build anything that
16:54 - is no and that will just create an error
16:57 - so what we'll do is we'll open up our
16:59 - node script so double click on node
17:03 - script you can see we have a
17:04 - differential bunch of code in here but
17:08 - most importantly under our onmousedown
17:10 - we want to find our tour to build here
17:13 - and then say um actually we can do this
17:17 - at the very beginning here so we can say
17:19 - if and then we want to use the build
17:22 - manager instance so let's store this as
17:24 - well just as we did before so we'll
17:27 - create up here we'll have a build
17:28 - manager and we'll just call this build
17:31 - manager and in the start method will set
17:34 - build manager equal to build manager
17:37 - instance and then here right before we
17:42 - do anything in the on mouse style down
17:44 - we can say that
17:45 - if build manager dot get turret to build
17:50 - is equal to null will then we sit boobs
17:53 - is equal to null well then we simply
17:57 - want to return them we don't want to do
17:58 - anything in here and down here we can
18:01 - simply write build manager now instead
18:03 - of build manager dot instance so we've
18:05 - cashed that once again and another place
18:08 - that we can take this code is down under
18:11 - the on mouse enter to make sure that we
18:13 - will only highlight the different notes
18:16 - when we hover over them we will only do
18:18 - that hover animation when we actually
18:20 - have a turret to build or else the user
18:23 - will be incentivized to press that note
18:26 - and nothing will happen and he will
18:28 - think wow that's weird so we'll make
18:29 - sure to only show the user that that can
18:32 - be done if we have a chart selected we
18:34 - won't do this on the on mouse exit
18:36 - because then we would be able to build
18:38 - something have the chart to build be
18:40 - equal to null and then have that note
18:43 - just be highlighted for the rest of the
18:45 - game that would be weird so we'll make
18:47 - sure to always disable it and that was
18:51 - pretty much it I believe so if we hit
18:53 - play now we should be able to you can
18:57 - see we can hover over these two there's
18:59 - no hover animation here and then uh
19:01 - thing happens when we press the map then
19:04 - if I select the chart say the standard
19:05 - turret we're now able to place that
19:08 - around the map and if I switch to the
19:11 - other chart here you can see that the
19:13 - chart that we just placed where standard
19:16 - turrets well then we can actually are
19:19 - place those as well however one thing is
19:22 - happening and that is it's acting as if
19:25 - the chart to place is no and the reason
19:28 - why is that it is so if we go ahead and
19:31 - find our game master you can see it's
19:35 - because we haven't dragged a prefab
19:37 - under the another chart prefab and
19:40 - therefore when we set our chart to build
19:42 - equal to another chart it became equal
19:44 - to null and so nothing happened so let's
19:47 - just make sure to drag some kind of
19:49 - prefab in here and we'll just take the
19:51 - standard turret and duplicate it and we
19:54 - call this one another turret and all
19:57 - we'll do is we'll change the range
19:59 - to be double and the fire rate to be
20:02 - half just so we can see a difference
20:03 - between the two and then we can find our
20:06 - game master script again and drag the
20:08 - another chart prefab in there so now
20:12 - when we hit play and we find here
20:15 - another chart and click you can see that
20:19 - another chart is built and you can see
20:21 - the difference here it has a super long
20:23 - range whereas the this chart here only
20:26 - has a very short one
20:29 - okay cool so now that we have that in
20:32 - place we should actually go down here
20:34 - and change these debug deadlock
20:37 - statements because we are actually not
20:39 - purchasing on the chart here we're only
20:41 - selecting what we want to build and
20:43 - therefore it might be better to say
20:46 - selected but exactly when we want to
20:50 - subtract the amount of money and stuff
20:51 - like that it's something that will
20:53 - determine in a later video so we'll just
20:55 - keep the method names here for now and
20:58 - then we can maybe change it later but
21:01 - I'll just change the debug log statement
21:03 - for now awesome so the very last thing
21:06 - that I want to do before leaving you is
21:09 - when we have play now and we hover over
21:12 - something that is and select the chart
21:15 - and we hover over something here that is
21:17 - beneath our icon you can see it still
21:20 - gets highlighted
21:21 - and if in fact if I press something
21:23 - beneath the icon the our chart still
21:25 - gets set and I just want to avoid this
21:27 - and the way that we do this very easily
21:29 - is by going into unity finding our node
21:33 - here and right up here we want to use
21:36 - unity engine dot event systems and we
21:43 - want to down here under on mouse enter
21:47 - we want to check if we are currently
21:49 - hovering over a UI element that is in
21:52 - the way and we do that by using if and
21:56 - then event systems or event system dot
22:03 - current dodd is pointer over game object
22:08 - and that's a function so we'll have to
22:10 - open and close some parentheses and if
22:13 - it is well then we want to return okay
22:16 - so on this assembly is the pointer with
22:19 - the given ID over an event system object
22:22 - and if it is then we just exit out of
22:25 - this on mouse enter and we do the same
22:29 - up here with onmousedown so that should
22:33 - actually just get rid of that very
22:35 - easily and now you can see when we
22:37 - select this nothing is highlighted and
22:39 - in fact I can press like crazy here and
22:41 - not
22:42 - thing will get billed and it's the same
22:44 - with the auditory so we will make sure
22:46 - now we have made sure now that the UI
22:49 - actually blocks that kind of behavior so
22:52 - that was all I wanted to show for this
22:55 - video stuff to come is maybe closing and
22:58 - opening the shop or something like that
23:00 - definitely some currency and yeah and
23:04 - some other turrets I definitely want to
23:06 - add a missile launcher to the game that
23:09 - would be so cool so that's pretty much
23:11 - it for now thanks for watching and I'll
23:13 - see you in the next video thank you so
23:15 - much to all of the awesome patreon
