00:00 - this video is brought to you by Aron
00:01 - meta I'm really sorry if I butchered
00:04 - your name thank you so much for donating
00:06 - if you want to support breis yourself
00:07 - you can go to patreon.com Brees thanks
00:10 - for tuning in at
00:12 - braies hello everyone and welcome to
00:14 - this video on creating a tower defense
00:16 - game in unity today we are going to be
00:17 - doing some explosions we are going to be
00:19 - editing our missile by adding a texture
00:22 - to it we are going to be creating a cool
00:24 - particle effect when it hits something
00:26 - and also we'll be editing the bullet
00:28 - script uh to allow for damaging enemies
00:31 - in a radius instead of just hitting the
00:33 - target so a really exciting video today
00:36 - and let's just jump right into it so you
00:38 - can see that I'm here in unity and what
00:40 - I want to begin with is finding uh our
00:43 - input ports folder and then our missile
00:45 - launcher if you haven't watched the
00:47 - previous video where we imported the
00:48 - missile launcher I definitely recommend
00:51 - that you go ahead and do that now or you
00:53 - could just use your own model for a
00:55 - missile of course but this missile here
00:57 - that you can see I have in the scene um
00:59 - is of that missile launcher model so you
01:03 - will have to import that at least cool
01:06 - so uh we basically want to set this up
01:08 - with a new material it currently has the
01:10 - default one so let's right click under
01:12 - the missile launcher materials folder to
01:14 - create a new one and let's call this one
01:17 - missile let's then drag it on top of the
01:20 - model and let's uh select our missile
01:22 - launcher texture and drag that into the
01:24 - albo channel let's bump up the metallic
01:27 - and bring down the smoothness to make it
01:29 - fit with the rest of our
01:31 - scene and basically I want to use this
01:33 - as our Graphics object but not as our
01:36 - root object and the reason why is that
01:38 - if we current select it and make sure we
01:41 - are set to Pivot and local up here you
01:44 - can see that our blue arrow meaning our
01:46 - forward axis which is our Z positive Z
01:49 - points
01:51 - upwards and not forward when it comes in
01:54 - relation to our missile so basically we
01:57 - want to rotate our missile so that it it
01:59 - points in the same direction as our Z so
02:01 - that when we chase a Target it will look
02:04 - the correct way and the Really the
02:07 - easiest way to do this is just rename
02:09 - this to something like Graphics create
02:11 - an empty object that we reset the
02:13 - transform on and let's uh call this one
02:16 - missile missile there we go let's take
02:19 - our Graphics object drag it on the
02:21 - missile let's reset the Transformer on
02:24 - that and let's just drag it up here so
02:25 - we can see what's going on and you will
02:27 - notice it has disappeared but really
02:29 - it's just really really tiny so we'll
02:32 - just select our Graphics here and set
02:34 - the scale to 100 by 100 by 100 and that
02:38 - will bring it right back and then what
02:40 - we can do is we can actually just rotate
02:43 - it on uh 90Â° around the Y AIS and now
02:47 - when we select our missile you can see
02:49 - that the z-axis and our missile points
02:51 - in the same direction so now we can hit
02:54 - an uh hit add component and then add the
02:57 - bullet component let's select the speed
02:59 - of something like 30 I want to give the
03:01 - impression that this missile actually
03:03 - has some mass and therefore moves a bit
03:05 - slower towards the Target and we'll also
03:08 - get this cool like meat seeding uh meat
03:10 - seeding seeking heat seeking missile
03:13 - effect um that that looks kind of
03:16 - impressive and then as the impact effect
03:18 - we'll create one ourselves in a second
03:20 - but let's just use the bullet impact
03:22 - effect uh for now so now we can take
03:25 - this missile drag it down under the
03:27 - prefabs folder to make it a prefab let's
03:29 - remove remve it from the scene and then
03:31 - let's select our missile launcher and
03:33 - drag our missile under the bullet prefab
03:35 - to replace the bullet with the missile
03:38 - there we go so now we should be able to
03:41 - actually test this out and I'm just
03:43 - going to do that really quickly
03:45 - by placing the turret down there and you
03:49 - can see I just paused it here it's just
03:50 - launched the missile if we take a look
03:53 - at the missile in the scene it's
03:55 - definitely not pointing towards our
03:58 - enemy and why is that because it's
04:00 - pointing in the right direction here as
04:02 - we can see that is because we actually
04:04 - haven't added this functionality yet so
04:07 - if we go ahead and take a look at our
04:09 - missile and then the bullet script and
04:11 - double click that to open it up in
04:12 - Visual Studio we currently don't do any
04:15 - uh rotation on the object at all so
04:18 - let's go ahead and do this and it's
04:20 - really easy we want to do this in the
04:21 - update Loop because we do want to do it
04:23 - every frame and we want to do it right
04:25 - beneath the line where we move the
04:27 - actual missile that means transform
04:30 - translate what we want to put here is
04:32 - just
04:33 - transform. look at so it will look at
04:37 - whatever Target and of course we will
04:39 - just use our Target variable that is the
04:41 - transform up here that we set using um
04:45 - or that we set from the actual missile
04:48 - launcher so the missile launcher points
04:49 - towards something and it fires the
04:51 - bullet in our case a missile and it says
04:53 - your target is this enemy and it will
04:56 - fly towards that and now Point towards
04:59 - that and if you hear some noise in the
05:01 - background that is just my cat's being
05:03 - uh naughty but um I will try and
05:06 - continue here um so the next thing that
05:09 - we want to do uh let's just see this
05:12 - working actually let's just see this in
05:13 - effect here so you can see that our
05:16 - missile now correctly chases our enemy
05:20 - so that's cool the next thing that we
05:22 - want to do is damage the player or the
05:25 - uh enemies in a radius so if we go in
05:27 - here under our bullet script again you
05:30 - can see that currently if we get within
05:33 - um or if we hit the target here we call
05:35 - a function called Hit Target and all
05:38 - that does is instantiate some kind of
05:40 - effect and then uh
05:43 - destroy the target game object and
05:45 - destroy the bullet all I want to do is I
05:48 - want to go up here and add a new
05:50 - variable and this is going to be a
05:52 - public float with a range or radius I
05:56 - think I'm going to call this the
05:57 - explosion radius and I'm going to
06:00 - default this to zero and this way down
06:03 - here we can simply add in an if
06:05 - statement that that says if explosion
06:08 - radius is greater than zero well then we
06:11 - want something extraordinary to happen
06:13 - then we want to damage uh people in a
06:15 - radius people our enemies and uh if not
06:20 - then we can just go ahead and hit this
06:22 - single Target and I think the way that
06:25 - we do this is instead of just destroying
06:27 - the target object or we'll still be
06:29 - doing that but let's wrap that in a
06:31 - function because we might do uh several
06:33 - things I definitely want to have some
06:36 - particles whenever our enemies die
06:39 - because right now it's just um our hit
06:41 - particle and not any kind of death
06:43 - effect and that looks kind of empty and
06:46 - I also want some way of keeping track of
06:48 - the health of our enemies uh so that is
06:51 - to come but for now we'll just have a a
06:53 - void damage here and it's going to
06:56 - damage a transform and we'll just call
06:58 - that enemy
07:00 - and then we can simply put this
07:01 - Destroyer statement down here so instead
07:03 - of destroying the target up here we're
07:05 - going to destroy
07:08 - enemy. game object here and then what we
07:11 - can do is we can say if explosion radius
07:15 - is greater than zero then we want to
07:17 - damage several enemies and we'll uh
07:19 - actually want to explode and we'll add
07:22 - that function in in a second if not then
07:25 - we want to
07:27 - damage uh the the Target only the target
07:31 - there we go and no ma matter what we
07:34 - want to destroy ourselves at the end so
07:37 - that should actually be it and now we
07:39 - can create the actual explode function
07:41 - here so we'll have a void
07:44 - explode and the way that we're going to
07:46 - do this is we are going to use
07:49 - physics dot um I believe it
07:54 - is overlap sphere and this is just going
07:57 - to shoot out a sphere and check for all
08:00 - of the colliders that is hit by that
08:02 - sphere that overlaps with that sphere or
08:05 - inside of that sphere and it's going to
08:07 - do that from a position and in a radius
08:10 - so our radius here is our explosion
08:13 - radius and we can use this to get an
08:16 - array which is basically just a list of
08:19 - items a fixed uh a list of items with a
08:21 - fixed uh range fixed range fixed length
08:26 - um so we can get an array of all of the
08:28 - colliders
08:29 - that are in that sphere so collider
08:32 - array and we'll call this one
08:35 - our uh
08:37 - colliders or something like hit objects
08:39 - or something like that and the reason
08:42 - why I'm not calling this enemies is
08:44 - because we might also have hit some
08:46 - objects that aren't our enemies and what
08:48 - you can really do here we don't want
08:50 - position there we want transform.
08:52 - position transform up position is that
08:55 - you can add a layer mask to uh filter
08:58 - out anything but enemies that are on a
09:01 - particular layer maybe called the enemy
09:03 - layer or something like that or we could
09:06 - just use the fact that all of our
09:08 - enemies if we go under our prefabs here
09:10 - and select our enemy all of our enemies
09:12 - are tagged as enemies so now we Loop
09:15 - through uh this list here so for each
09:19 - collider uh collider in
09:24 - colliders here for each thing that we
09:28 - have hid we want to see if that collider
09:32 - if the collider that we've hid do tag is
09:35 - equal to enemy so if it the the thing
09:38 - that we hit here is taged as an enemy
09:41 - then we can go ahead and damage it so
09:43 - then we can call
09:44 - damage on collider do
09:49 - transform there we go so now we will uh
09:52 - shoot out a sphere as an explosion we'll
09:56 - see what it hits we'll Loop through all
09:58 - of the things that it hit and check if
10:00 - they are indeed an enemy and if they are
10:02 - we will damage them which basically now
10:05 - just means destroy them cool so that is
10:08 - basically all the logic that we are
10:11 - going to need so now if we hit play here
10:13 - and it's not going to be visible with
10:15 - the first enemy of course only the
10:16 - second one when we have multiple enemies
10:18 - in here so I'm just going to wait a
10:20 - second here and actually I just uh
10:23 - reminded myself that we haven't changed
10:26 - uh the range of our missile launcher so
10:28 - we have to select our missile launcher
10:30 - actually we have to select our missile
10:32 - and we have to add an explosion radius
10:35 - and you will notice that currently we
10:36 - don't have any way of viewing this
10:38 - radius so as we did with our turret when
10:41 - we added a range I suggest that we go
10:43 - down here and go void on draw gizmos
10:47 - selected and we add in
10:50 - gizmos do draw wire sphere from our
10:55 - current position transform. position in
10:59 - explosion radius and that we make this
11:03 - um red or something so gizmos color
11:06 - equals color. red there we go so that
11:10 - will just make it very clear to the user
11:12 - when setting things in the inspector
11:14 - here how big a radius the uh missile
11:17 - actually will explode in and this is
11:19 - quite a big radius we might have to
11:22 - bring it down to something like seven or
11:24 - uh let's just do eight that might hit
11:26 - something like at least two or three
11:28 - enemies
11:30 - um so let's apply that let's go and hit
11:32 - play and now we should see that if we
11:36 - wait for the first one here to pass by
11:39 - and put a turret for this second wave
11:41 - here we should see that they both
11:43 - explode because they were in that radius
11:46 - and none of the environment or anything
11:48 - that gets removed and uh the one that
11:51 - was down here didn't get hit so you can
11:53 - see that this always hits uh two and
11:56 - sometimes if you're lucky hits three
11:58 - enemies which think is is quite good for
12:01 - balance but you can of course mess
12:03 - around with this especially when we get
12:05 - the actual damage parameters in there
12:07 - that we can tweak cool so now let's add
12:11 - an awesome effect so now is for the
12:13 - particle play time that should be a
12:16 - whole whole thing we should have like a
12:18 - jingle that goes particle play time okay
12:21 - maybe for the next video so let's go and
12:24 - hit create particle system and let's re
12:29 - said actually I don't want to begin with
12:31 - a whole fresh particle system let's use
12:33 - our bullet impact effect as a base here
12:36 - so let's duplicate the prefab call this
12:38 - one the
12:39 - explosion
12:40 - effect uh maybe we should do missile
12:43 - explosion effect to be more clear about
12:45 - what this is let's drag it in uh and now
12:50 - we can see that this is kind of boring
12:51 - let's first of all Loop this while we're
12:53 - playing around with it and set the
12:54 - duration to something like three so that
12:56 - looks pretty good there and my is
12:59 - joining in again say hi hi so I'll just
13:03 - put him down so um what we can then go
13:06 - is we can go under shape here and maybe
13:09 - just bring up the size of this radius a
13:12 - bit because we are do want our explosion
13:15 - to be kind of
13:16 - large and dramatic and then we can go
13:19 - under emission and definitely bump this
13:21 - up I think we should go to something
13:23 - like 30 and my idea with this is that we
13:26 - add a bunch of debris that goes flying
13:28 - and that
13:29 - falls on the um on the ground and then
13:33 - we add a separate particle system that
13:35 - is kind of our fire spikes thing which
13:39 - is also Cubes but that actually has a
13:41 - negative gravity so they go flying in
13:43 - the air I think that's going to look
13:45 - fairly cool so let's just have this be
13:47 - at something like 30 and uh the start
13:50 - size and all that actually is pretty
13:52 - good but I definitely want to bump up
13:54 - the speed so let's go between 10 and
13:56 - maybe 15
14:00 - and maybe between five and
14:03 - 15 but I definitely want them to go
14:05 - flying I actually think that this this
14:07 - looks pretty good and then I want to go
14:09 - down on the renderer and I want to
14:11 - disable uh receive shadows and cast
14:13 - Shadows I don't think there's any reason
14:15 - for them to actually do that um not when
14:18 - we have this many in the scene
14:20 - especially because we're going to be
14:21 - adding a cool light in a moment that you
14:23 - will see what uh what
14:25 - does and um yeah I kind of like that so
14:29 - let's use that as a base to work off of
14:31 - and uh let's now duplicate this and we
14:34 - can maybe we can take the second one and
14:37 - drag it under as a child and this is
14:40 - going to be our Flames or Sparks or
14:43 - something it's just going to look a bit
14:44 - difference so let's create a new
14:47 - material for this create U material and
14:50 - this is going to be our missile
14:54 - explosion um Sparks Flames flames
15:00 - uh so let's go under our Flames object
15:02 - under the renderer and let's drag our
15:04 - new material under
15:07 - that and we can now go in and edit this
15:10 - uh the color of this here
15:12 - so did that actually apply I don't think
15:16 - that applied correctly let's go down
15:19 - here okay so it's actually selected as
15:21 - the material here but I think our nested
15:23 - prefabs is messing with us there we go
15:25 - so now it looks correctly so we'll Nest
15:27 - those in a second
15:29 - um so I really like the look of that but
15:31 - we'll definitely have to adjust the
15:33 - color a bit here so I want to have
15:35 - something kind of red orange really
15:38 - really
15:39 - bright something like that I I think
15:43 - that looks really cool and then what we
15:45 - will do is we will have A1 gravity
15:49 - modifier so it goes flying up into the
15:52 - air and we will add definitely some size
15:56 - to these we'll have them be between to 5
15:59 - and
16:00 - 0.5 to make them a lot bigger we'll set
16:03 - the start lifetime between um random
16:07 - between two constants between let's do
16:11 - uh 0.5 and
16:12 - one and let's definitely also add some
16:15 - speed to these so the start Speed is
16:17 - going to between uh be between 10 and
16:22 - 25 and I really like the the way that uh
16:26 - this is going uh let's actually do 15
16:29 - and 25 and let's also set the emission
16:32 - up to 50 I want that to be a lot of
16:35 - flames and let's also bring up the size
16:38 - of these so let's bring up uh those up
16:40 - to 25 and 0.5 and we can maybe even make
16:45 - these a tiny bit bigger um but I I think
16:48 - we'll try this out and see how it goes
16:51 - that really gives this aggressive field
16:53 - to the explosion uh so we can drag those
16:55 - on that now and we can try and hit apply
16:58 - to this prefab here so if we hit
17:00 - simulate that looks cool and then we can
17:02 - remove the looping and we can remove the
17:05 - looping on the other one as well hit
17:07 - apply again and now uh remove that from
17:10 - the scene we can go back into our bullet
17:13 - script here and we just want to make
17:14 - sure that the effect that we instantiate
17:17 - has something like 5 seconds and not
17:19 - only 2 seconds because this effect might
17:21 - last last a little bit longer uh just in
17:24 - case you have a different effect than I
17:26 - do I think that the uh B there was just
17:29 - a bit too
17:31 - small uh
17:32 - so that's awesome and I believe that we
17:36 - have to select our missile now and hit
17:40 - or drag our missile explosion effect
17:42 - under the impact effect slot for that to
17:45 - be applied so now we can hit play and
17:47 - this will look cool but maybe a tiny bit
17:50 - uh empty here so I think the explosion
17:53 - itself is uh freaking cool but I
17:57 - definitely think uh that that we need
17:59 - some kind of flashing light in there
18:01 - just some kind of flash effect to make
18:03 - it feel like an explosion missile and
18:06 - also if we go under uh the missile
18:08 - explosion effect and select our Flames I
18:10 - want to go down and disable Collision
18:13 - there's really no reason to check for
18:15 - Collision when they're just flying up
18:17 - into the air anyways um so all of the
18:20 - other stuff seems fine now now let's
18:22 - drag this under our hierarchy and let's
18:25 - just add a quick Point light to this so
18:27 - let's go uh right click and then light
18:31 - Point light and I want the range of this
18:33 - to be something like I don't know 20 or
18:35 - 25 and the color to
18:39 - be a bit more orange
18:42 - here really orange actually and I want
18:45 - the intensity to be high something like
18:47 - three or four U maybe even four actually
18:50 - uh because this is a whole explosion
18:54 - thingy and I want to drag it up a bit
18:57 - there we go in relation to our Flames
18:59 - here and we can just see what that looks
19:01 - like I think that looks really cool and
19:03 - let's also add some hard Shadows to
19:05 - these um so that's not going to require
19:08 - too much rendering time but it does
19:10 - definitely add something to the scene
19:13 - especially have if you have more enemies
19:15 - in here and now we have basically two
19:17 - options either we could go in and create
19:19 - an animation that is going to quickly
19:21 - fade this out or we could create a
19:23 - script that does the same thing maybe
19:25 - that just disables it after a single
19:27 - frame or something I think we should
19:29 - just go ahead and create an animation
19:31 - that gives us a lot of control and it's
19:33 - really really easy so let's have this be
19:36 - light and let's go under animation here
19:39 - hit create and this is just going to be
19:41 - our explosion light animation and let's
19:46 - create a whole new folder for this so go
19:48 - new folder
19:51 - animation and let's go and save it under
19:54 - that and you can see now that it's
19:56 - created the light controller that
19:58 - controls what animation we are playing
20:01 - and explosion light which is our
20:03 - animation itself and on our light it has
20:06 - created an animator component that is
20:09 - the one that takes care of playing
20:12 - whatever the controller tells it um and
20:15 - actually going through the uh explosion
20:18 - animation so now we have this timeline
20:20 - here and I just want to add in um a tiny
20:25 - change in intensity so let's go forward
20:27 - something like I don't know like uh 0 uh
20:32 - 05 here and let's bring the intensity
20:35 - all the way down I don't think there's
20:37 - any reason to go more technical with
20:40 - this and you can see just how quick of
20:42 - an effect that is and that is basically
20:45 - all I want to do however I want to
20:47 - select our explosion light and disable
20:49 - Loop time so it won't just stand there
20:51 - in Loop and look like a muscle flash it
20:54 - will just disappear once it's gone
20:56 - through a single time and we can also
20:58 - see on the the light here that uh if we
21:00 - double click that to open it up in the
21:02 - animator this is orange which means that
21:04 - it's the default animation State and so
21:06 - it will be played right when the object
21:08 - gets spawned in so now we can hit apply
21:11 - on the missile launcher explosion effect
21:14 - remove it from the scene and we should
21:16 - be able to hit uh play and see this in
21:20 - action so I think that gives a really
21:23 - really cool effect I think we added the
21:26 - range which is great so we have the
21:28 - functionality in place we have a cool
21:30 - looking particle and we even have a
21:32 - light in there so that is basically all
21:35 - I wanted to do uh for this video you can
21:37 - of course tweak this in any way that you
21:39 - want to and uh yeah thanks for watching
21:41 - I hope you enjoyed it and without
21:42 - further Ado I will see you in the next
