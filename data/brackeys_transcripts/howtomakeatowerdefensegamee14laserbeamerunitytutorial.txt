00:30 - it was a bit too much to squeeze into
00:31 - just one video will also be slowing down
00:34 - enemies whenever they're hit so that
00:36 - will allow for more interesting gameplay
00:38 - mechanics and give the user more
00:40 - abilities to create interesting uh kind
00:42 - of defensive setups so that is what
00:44 - we're going to be doing today and
00:46 - without further Ado let's just jump
00:47 - right into it so as you can see I'm here
00:49 - in unity and I really want to begin with
00:51 - just importing the model so let's U
00:53 - minimize Unity here and head on over and
00:55 - open the Tower Defense ass itss pack and
00:58 - you can of course download this for free
00:59 - free and there's a link for that in the
01:01 - description so let's just um let's jump
01:03 - right into our models folder under our
01:06 - laser Beamer and you can see that's both
01:09 - a blend file here in case you have blend
01:11 - installed and if you do not we'll just
01:13 - use the fbx as we have done the other
01:15 - times so let's just use that one and
01:18 - drag it into Unity but before we do that
01:20 - let's create a folder here under our
01:23 - Imports and let's call that laser Beamer
01:27 - just to stay nicely organized we can
01:30 - drag the fpx in there instead and you
01:32 - will of course see that it creates a
01:35 - laser Beamer object which we will put a
01:38 - scale factor of 0. five on and hit apply
01:41 - and then we have a a materials folder uh
01:44 - with all of the different materials that
01:45 - will just be modifying a tiny bit here
01:47 - in a second so now let's take our laser
01:49 - Beamer and drag it into the scene and
01:52 - let's reset the transform if it isn't
01:53 - already and hit F to focus in on that
01:57 - I'll Just sh shift it back to
01:58 - perspective view there and let's have a
02:00 - look in the scam view here how it looks
02:02 - in game and I think it looks just fine
02:05 - however there are some things here that
02:06 - we need to tweak so the first thing is
02:09 - that uh we want this to be in one word
02:12 - uh that's just a preference of mine
02:14 - whenever uh dealing with our stuff
02:17 - inside of unity and then I want to
02:18 - rename these things here so this one
02:20 - here is the base that is what we called
02:22 - the other ones and this is going to be
02:24 - the head awesome then we can change the
02:27 - materials for uh to make this look a bit
02:30 - better so let's find our bolts here I
02:32 - actually want them to be black you can
02:34 - of course choose whatever you want here
02:37 - and I'm going to bump up the metallic on
02:39 - those and bump down the smoothness a bit
02:42 - uh there we go actually make them a bit
02:44 - darker a bit more metallic I guess that
02:47 - will actually dark in them and then we
02:49 - can take the base here because I think
02:52 - um and that is the stand here let's
02:54 - rename that to base as well so we don't
02:57 - get confused and I think this is a bit
02:59 - to Blue so let's actually make it more
03:02 - over in the gray area here a bit more
03:05 - metallic uh take down the smoothness
03:07 - just a tad and maybe even lighten it up
03:10 - a bit here so something like that is a
03:12 - lot better because I wanted to kind of
03:15 - get be in line with the other um turret
03:18 - stance so that's fine I I do want it to
03:21 - be a tiny bit more blue then we can take
03:23 - our main turret which is this part up
03:25 - here and I actually really like this the
03:28 - feel of this I just want it to be more
03:29 - metallic which means that it will be
03:31 - darkened and therefore we have to
03:33 - brighten it up in our color and then I
03:36 - think we can maybe take our smoothness
03:37 - and just dial that down just a tad and I
03:41 - really like the feel of this and then we
03:43 - can find our um third accent here which
03:48 - is this yellow color and we can
03:50 - definitely go with yellow but I think we
03:52 - just need to dial it down just a tiny
03:54 - bit um for this to look a bit better
03:57 - something like that and it's just small
04:00 - tweaks here and if finally we have the
04:02 - pipe I think we can make that pop even
04:04 - more so let's just give that even more
04:06 - of a purple color a tiny bit of metallic
04:09 - and then definitely bump down the
04:11 - smoothness here and I think that looks
04:13 - pretty cool definitely looks laery maybe
04:16 - even toxic so that's fine and um what we
04:19 - can do now is just uh actually apply our
04:22 - turret script so that's apply our turret
04:24 - here and uh we'll give this a range of
04:27 - say 20 and won't miss with the fire rate
04:30 - that's not going to matter because we're
04:32 - going to be creating our own little
04:33 - system for dealing with um lasers
04:36 - because they are kind of an ongoing
04:38 - thing um and uh we have the enemy tag
04:41 - we'll just leave that and then we need
04:42 - to add a part to rotate so that's just
04:45 - right click create a new M2 object and
04:47 - reset that and call this one our part to
04:50 - rotate and let's drag this under our
04:53 - head and then reset the transform to
04:56 - that drag it out again and that will
04:58 - just Center it kind of where it needs to
05:00 - be which is here and now of course we
05:02 - need to have our blue Z Arrow uh point
05:06 - in the direction of our head so we've
05:08 - done this multiple times and we're just
05:09 - making sure that when we rotate this uh
05:12 - it will actually align with the z-axis
05:14 - being forward uh so that we don't have
05:17 - to do any messing around with any
05:19 - rotations inside of the script we just
05:21 - do that in here which is much more
05:23 - visual so make sure it says pivot pivot
05:26 - and local up here and then we can maybe
05:29 - ser the X on the X and um zero the
05:33 - coordinate on the X and then uh um put a
05:37 - 90 that will have to be ative 90 on the
05:40 - Y and let's also put a 1 one one scale I
05:45 - think that's going to be better and then
05:47 - we can take our head here and drag that
05:49 - under the pot to rotate and we can just
05:51 - hit continue here and now we should be
05:53 - see that our part to rotate points in
05:55 - the correct direction and we can just
05:57 - easily move this part around
06:00 - awesome so now we can reference that in
06:02 - here as well so let's drag our pot to
06:04 - rotate into the PO to rotate field and
06:07 - finally we need a bullet prefab except
06:09 - we're not going to be using bullets so
06:11 - we'll ignore that as well however we do
06:13 - want a fire Point um so we'll have some
06:17 - place where our laser will origin so uh
06:20 - and we are just going to create that as
06:22 - we've always done on the part to rotate
06:25 - rotate so let's create an empty there
06:27 - again reset it and we'll name this our
06:31 - fire
06:32 - point and we will um make sure again to
06:36 - uh position this correctly so let's view
06:38 - it from this side switch to isometric
06:41 - View and we can just drag that up there
06:45 - and I wanted it to be pretty close now
06:46 - because we're not actually instantiating
06:48 - anything here we're just um kind of
06:51 - putting a point for the line renderer so
06:53 - we can get really close and um it's
06:56 - actually centered from the front here I
06:58 - believe already that's
07:00 - awesome yeah great cool so now we can
07:04 - drag this in select the line uh the
07:06 - laser Beamer and drag the fireo onto the
07:09 - correct slot and there we go so I
07:11 - believe that was all we needed to set up
07:14 - on on this object so far uh so let's
07:17 - actually go ahead and turn this into a
07:19 - prefab now so let's go into prefabs and
07:21 - drag that in there the entire laser
07:24 - Beamer and we'll just have it sit here
07:27 - for a moment so that we can easily
07:29 - change things if we want to so the next
07:32 - thing is kind of adding this to our
07:34 - build menu so that we can actually put
07:36 - it in the game as the game is running so
07:39 - uh to do this again we find our overlay
07:41 - canvas under shop and then we see that
07:44 - we have a stand a turret and a missile
07:46 - launcher item and apple really wants me
07:49 - to spend money these days so I'll just
07:50 - dismiss that the only thing that's
07:52 - running out is my patience there there
07:55 - we go um so I'll um duplicate our
07:58 - missile launcher item here here and I
08:00 - will call this one um laser Beamer and
08:05 - we'll actually do laser Beamer
08:07 - item and we need to change the icon and
08:10 - we'll do that in just a second but let's
08:12 - also change the cost text down here and
08:15 - I'll change that to say
08:17 - $350 to make it very expensive uh which
08:20 - means we'll have to make it powerful as
08:22 - well and uh we need to go into the shop
08:25 - and change this function here and I
08:27 - believe we can just go ahead and do that
08:28 - right now now so let's double click on
08:30 - the shop to be taken over here and let's
08:32 - double click that to open it up in
08:34 - visual studio and all we need to do here
08:36 - is First add a new turret blueprint so
08:38 - we'll go public turret blueprint and
08:41 - this is going to be our uh laser
08:45 - Beamer and we'll add a new function for
08:48 - this as well so we'll uh call this one
08:51 - the select laser Beamer and it's going
08:55 - to say laser Beamer
08:58 - selected there we go and we are going to
09:01 - select the tur to build and we're going
09:03 - to pass in our laser Beamer of course
09:06 - awesome and one thing that I actually
09:08 - noticed is that under our build manager
09:11 - um if we go to our game master and find
09:13 - our build manager here you can see that
09:16 - we still have a standard turret and a
09:17 - missile launcher prefab referenced but
09:19 - we're not using those in any way so
09:21 - let's just double click on that and go
09:23 - in here and remove those two Fields
09:26 - there's really no reason for those to
09:28 - sit there because we are passing them
09:29 - along um inside of the turd
09:32 - blueprint so we can just remove those
09:35 - and you can see that we should still be
09:36 - error free down here awesome um so now
09:41 - that we've added those we can find our
09:43 - shop and we can find our laser Beamer
09:45 - and we can set this up so let's set the
09:47 - cost to 350 and let's also find our
09:50 - prefab and drag that in
09:53 - there
09:55 - cool so I believe that was kind of all
09:57 - we needed to set up in terms of the shop
10:00 - here except of course we need to add an
10:03 - icon so uh let's have a look at
10:05 - importing one of those and again I
10:08 - inside of the um inside of the Tower
10:11 - Defense assets pack I have a Sprites
10:13 - folder and I've included a laser Beamer
10:16 - icon.png there's also Photoshop file if
10:19 - you use Photoshop again I'm just going
10:21 - to import the PNG here and let's find
10:24 - our um icons folder and let's drag that
10:28 - right in there
10:29 - I believe the other ones we imported
10:31 - were uh PNG as well let me just check
10:35 - for that because I like to use the same
10:37 - actually the first one was a Photoshop
10:39 - we'll just do a PNG here it really
10:41 - doesn't matter on my system uh so you
10:44 - can see here uh that the texture type is
10:46 - currently set to texture we need to
10:47 - change that to 2D and UI and uh the
10:50 - Sorting here or the uh Alpha channel
10:53 - should be sorted out and I believe
10:56 - that's all we need to change except we
10:57 - can maybe uh change this to 512 if we
11:00 - have OCD and then we can uh make this
11:03 - true color um there we go just to make
11:06 - it display really beautifully and then
11:08 - we can change that inside of the missile
11:10 - laundry icon here change that to the
11:12 - laser Beamer so you can see that set up
11:14 - inside of the unity scene and I actually
11:16 - think that looks fairly
11:19 - decent good okay things are moving along
11:23 - I actually want to maybe make it a tiny
11:25 - bit bigger um I actually want to make it
11:28 - maybe one 20 down here I think that's
11:32 - better uh and that looks really really
11:34 - cool so now we should be able to just
11:36 - hit play and select the laser Beamer and
11:39 - it should say um whoops there's
11:41 - something here we haven't assigned oh
11:43 - that's on our laser Beamer we haven't
11:45 - assigned a bullet preab for now just
11:46 - while testing we'll go in here and just
11:49 - assign a normal bullet one we'll just do
11:51 - a um bullet there we go just so we won't
11:53 - get any errors so we can select here our
11:57 - missile or it says missile launcher so
11:58 - selected that's because we have to find
12:01 - our laser Beamer uh item that we go into
12:04 - the shop and we have to change the on
12:06 - click event so we've actually added the
12:08 - function but we haven't changed this
12:09 - event so it still points to the select
12:11 - missile launcher function so we just
12:13 - need to go on shop and change that to
12:16 - select laser Beamer and we should be all
12:18 - right so let's try and H and play now
12:20 - clicking there laser Beamer selected and
12:22 - clicking somewhere in the scene and you
12:24 - can see it appears and we can only
12:26 - purchase one because we actually don't
12:28 - have that much money when starting
12:30 - out cool uh so now I think it's time to
12:37 - add in a line render to do some actual
12:40 - lasering laser ring laser thing so let's
12:44 - do that so let's uh create a we could
12:47 - either actually put it just in here or
12:50 - we could put it as a separate object I
12:53 - think we're just going to put it on the
12:56 - road but you can do any anything you
12:59 - want so let's just put it here and um
13:03 - we're not going to be casting Shadows
13:05 - we're not going to be receiving Shadows
13:07 - um motion vectors will just leave on
13:10 - we'll have one material which we'll
13:11 - specify in a moment and let's just set
13:13 - up some temporary positions here that
13:15 - will allow us to view what this looks
13:17 - like so let's put a y value of three and
13:20 - a y value of three down here and then a
13:22 - z value of maybe five just so we can see
13:25 - kind of what is going on actually we
13:28 - could put it out here but I think this
13:30 - is going to be fine good so this is what
13:32 - our line currently looks like not too
13:35 - awesome so let's go to excuse me I think
13:38 - I'll have to take a sip of water
13:42 - here that's better all right so let's go
13:45 - under our parameters and let's uh put
13:47 - our start width
13:49 - to3 and our end width to3 as
13:53 - well cool that is definitely better and
13:57 - then we can uh go inside of our know our
13:59 - positions are fine we can go and find an
14:01 - actual material for this so let's create
14:03 - a new one inside the materials folder
14:05 - let's create a new material and let's
14:08 - call this one laser and let's then go
14:11 - back to our laser Beamer and drag the
14:13 - laser in there and we can go down here
14:16 - change the Shader to something like
14:19 - unlit color maybe or you could go
14:22 - particles uh Alpha
14:24 - Blended actually I think I'm going to go
14:27 - Alpha Blended and um you can see that we
14:30 - can mess around with the color in here
14:32 - so that's what we're going to be doing
14:33 - so let's take our start color here and
14:35 - change that to some kind of orangey
14:38 - thing and let's take our end color
14:41 - actually I want to switch that around um
14:44 - this one needs to
14:45 - be a bit actually let's do the first one
14:48 - red and the other one yeah let's do that
14:51 - so this one will be kind of bright
14:53 - almost yellow and this one is going to
14:55 - be kind of red to give that cool looking
14:59 - effect there and um we can maybe make
15:02 - the first one here a bit transparent as
15:04 - well and this is where I want to go in
15:07 - on to our material and bump this up a
15:09 - bit and also bump this up a bit
15:12 - something like that looks a bit better
15:15 - and there we go actually think that
15:18 - looks kind of nice I'm looking inside of
15:20 - the game view here uh just to get an
15:23 - idea of of how that looks and you can
15:26 - definitely go ahead and add more effects
15:28 - around this one thing that I do
15:29 - recommend is that uh you at the tip of
15:32 - the laser add some kind of particle
15:34 - system that you toggle on and off um in
15:37 - order to uh give a cool uh impression
15:41 - that uh the lace is actually hitting the
15:43 - object and there's Sparks bouncing off
15:45 - and stuff like that is that if that's
15:47 - something you really want to see me do
15:50 - leave that in the comment and I'll
15:51 - include it in the next video for slowing
15:54 - down the enemies and stuff like that
15:55 - then we'll just go particle crazy which
15:57 - you know I love it's not really not that
15:59 - I don't want to do it so please leave a
16:02 - comment okay so we'll continue the video
16:04 - here um so we've set up these parameters
16:07 - and U we're actually ready to go ahead
16:10 - and make this interactive through the
16:12 - script so let's apply this and don't
16:15 - worry about this being uh looking weird
16:17 - like this we can just delete our laser
16:19 - Beamer should be totally fine and then
16:22 - we can um find the scripts called turret
16:28 - there we go so let's double click our
16:29 - tet script and we'll move things around
16:31 - a bit here uh to organize them for what
16:34 - we want to do so currently we have these
16:36 - attributes I want to call this General
16:38 - and I pretty much only want our range to
16:40 - be in here because the next thing that I
16:42 - want to do is have one
16:44 - called um use bullets and this is going
16:49 - to be the
16:50 - default and in here we have stuff for
16:52 - bullets we have the fire rate the fire
16:54 - countdown we also have the bullet prefab
16:59 - awesome so we'll just put all of those
17:01 - in there and then we'll create a new
17:04 - header down
17:06 - here which is going to be um use of
17:09 - course
17:12 - laser and we'll remove the default there
17:15 - and to include the laser what we'll do
17:17 - is we'll have a Boolean that on the um
17:21 - that we can check inside of the editor
17:23 - if we want the attor to use a laser
17:25 - instead so we'll just do a public bll
17:28 - use laser and we'll set that equal to
17:32 - false by default awesome and then in
17:36 - here we can also have other stuff like a
17:38 - reference to a line renderer so let's do
17:39 - a public line renderer and we'll just do
17:43 - line renderer by the way in case you
17:45 - missed on the recent brei live stream
17:47 - it's currently um on the YouTube channel
17:50 - as a reupload so you can check that out
17:52 - we recreated uh the curve Fever The
17:54 - Snake like game and um in there we do a
17:57 - lot of stuff up with the line renderer
17:59 - and we do that in unity 5.5 which is
18:02 - currently in public beta but will
18:04 - probably soon be released uh for real um
18:07 - and uh there's so much new stuff done to
18:10 - the line render it looks so much better
18:12 - so if you think this is looking kind of
18:14 - not that great uh go check that out and
18:18 - um play around with the features there
18:19 - there's so much stuff to make it look a
18:21 - lot better uh and especially with
18:24 - particles as well so that's a lot of fun
18:26 - and you can check that out just wanted
18:27 - to mention that
18:28 - so uh we have the public line renderer
18:30 - here and uh let's actually put this to
18:33 - use and just to give you an idea of what
18:35 - we just did uh let me just find our
18:39 - prefabs and then find our laser Beamer
18:41 - here and you can see that this is now
18:43 - much more nicely grouped and we'll just
18:45 - for the laser Beamer here we'll have to
18:47 - check you use laser and we'll drag our
18:50 - line renderer right in there so if it's
18:52 - sitting on another object you can just
18:54 - drag in that object and it will uh uh
18:56 - select the line renderer for you so so
18:58 - that should take care of all of that and
19:01 - we can just remove the bullet prefab
19:03 - here not that it matters uh it's just
19:05 - not the one that we're
19:07 - using cool by the way I will just throw
19:10 - in one more point before continuing if
19:11 - you want to set this up even more nicely
19:14 - so that you have a variable called uh
19:16 - use bullets or maybe even an enumerator
19:19 - to select either bullets or laser and
19:22 - then it will show felds depending on
19:24 - what you've selected then I really
19:26 - suggest um creating an script and unity
19:29 - is so easily extendable with those um
19:31 - it's just too much for this video uh
19:33 - that simply switches between displaying
19:36 - those um that's super easy to do and you
19:38 - can just look up Unity custom editor
19:42 - good so that was all um so now we can
19:45 - continue so let's find the place here
19:47 - where uh we update stuff so in here we
19:50 - check if our Target is equal to null and
19:53 - if it isn't meaning that we have a
19:54 - Target we log on to it and then we
19:57 - handle some shooting so let's take all
19:59 - of this log on code and move into a
20:01 - separate function we should have done
20:02 - this a long time ago so let's uh call
20:05 - this one lock on
20:09 - Target uh and we'll move that down here
20:14 - so void log On
20:18 - Target and we'll just paste that entire
20:21 - code Block in
20:22 - there and um then we can put an if
20:25 - statement here saying if used laser
20:30 - then we want to laser
20:32 - stuff whoops not use laser we want to
20:35 - create a new function called lace that's
20:37 - really annoying let's just create the
20:39 - function here instead of getting around
20:42 - uh visual Studios autocomplete so we'll
20:44 - have a void laser down here and now we
20:47 - should be able to Tye it type it up here
20:49 - so laser and um if not so if we're using
20:53 - bullets we can go ahead and do all of
20:55 - this fire countdown shooting stuff stuff
20:59 - awesome and you can of course put that
21:00 - into a separate function as well but
21:02 - since we already have a shoed function I
21:04 - don't really think that's
21:06 - necessary um cool so um and I can see
21:09 - that I've pressed insert there just
21:11 - needed to get rid of that so inside of
21:13 - our laser what we can now do is say line
21:16 - renderer Dot and then we can set the
21:18 - positions of the different points that
21:20 - we want a line renderer to go through so
21:22 - again if you haven't seen the live
21:23 - stream and I cover this in there there's
21:25 - a positions array here meaning um each
21:28 - of these elements here in the array is
21:31 - uh a point that our line renderer will
21:33 - go through so we can actually create
21:35 - more if you want kind of a bending laser
21:37 - if you want one that's six saacks or
21:39 - whatever you can definitely do that uh
21:41 - but for now we'll just create a symbol
21:43 - line and um we'll uh do that by simply
21:46 - setting the first element and the second
21:49 - element in the array so U we'll just do
21:51 - line render do set position and we do
21:54 - that using an index so in our case the
21:56 - first element is index. Z and giving it
21:59 - a position and that's going to be our
22:01 - own position but we want not to use that
22:03 - we want to use our fire point firepoint
22:06 - do uh transform dot actually it's it's a
22:10 - transform so we can just do firepoint
22:12 - doos and we want to set the second one
22:15 - so line renderer do set position one to
22:19 - our Target's position so target.
22:23 - position there we go so that actually
22:25 - does it for us and we should see this
22:27 - working already so if we uh we go in
22:31 - here if we hit play and place down our
22:36 - turret we can see that that works
22:39 - however you will also notice that when
22:42 - our enemy here gets out of
22:45 - range the line renderer does not
22:48 - disappear so what we have to do in order
22:51 - to get that working is just using the
22:55 - fact that up here we're checking whether
22:56 - or not we have a Target so
22:58 - let's just make this a bit bigger here
23:00 - so let's say uh if Target is equal to
23:03 - null we definitely want to return but we
23:05 - want to do some stuff before that and
23:06 - that is just
23:07 - checking um if line renderer actually
23:11 - let's first check if uh use laser is
23:14 - true so we only want to do this kind of
23:16 - stuff if we actually using a laser and
23:19 - in that case we can say if line
23:23 - renderer actually we don't even need to
23:26 - do that if statement we could could do
23:28 - that if statement uh we'll do it if line
23:31 - renderer do um
23:34 - enabled uh then we want to disable it so
23:36 - we can just do line renderer do enabled
23:40 - equals false there we go and you can of
23:44 - course put that inside the other if
23:45 - statement as well but I think this is
23:47 - easier read uh to read and then uh down
23:50 - here we can simply say that if line
23:54 - renderer do enabled and then put an
23:57 - exclamation mark so if it's not enabled
23:59 - we'll do line renderer do enabled equals
24:03 - true there we go so this way we easily
24:06 - switch it on and off and we only do it
24:08 - once even though U we are uh doing all
24:11 - of this stuff inside the update Loop so
24:13 - if we now hit play we should see that
24:15 - when we spawn this in we no longer have
24:17 - a line up here and that uh there's no
24:21 - line until we actually get a Target and
24:24 - as soon as he's out of range our line
24:26 - renderer just again disappears so um
24:29 - that is working just the way we want it
24:31 - to and um yeah again for the next video
24:34 - we'll be slowing down the opponents if
24:36 - you want me to add some damage over time
24:38 - let me know if you want me to add more
24:40 - particles or more effects let me know I
24:42 - would love to do that and um yeah so
24:44 - that's pretty much all I wanted to show
24:46 - for this video I hope you enjoyed it and
24:48 - I will see you in the next one thank you
