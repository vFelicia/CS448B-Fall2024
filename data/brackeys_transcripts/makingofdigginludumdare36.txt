00:00 - hello everyone and welcome to this
00:01 - behind-the-scenes video showing the
00:02 - creation of my entry into the Ludum dare
00:04 - 36 combo I'm actually really happy with
00:07 - how the game turned out so those of you
00:09 - who don't know Lewton dairy is the
00:10 - biggest game development competition in
00:12 - the world the rules are simple you have
00:13 - 48 hours to create a game using only
00:15 - self-made assets that's also jam for
00:17 - those who want to work together with the
00:18 - team in which you have an extra 24 hours
00:21 - however I worked on this game alone so I
00:23 - submitted it to the combo the theme was
00:25 - announced three hours after midnight it
00:26 - was ancient technology I decided to
00:29 - sleep through the night and began
00:30 - working when I woke up I started by
00:32 - taking an hour off to brainstorm
00:33 - different ideas I considered making an
00:35 - endless runner through the streets of
00:36 - ancient Egypt where the game was
00:38 - centered around avoiding different
00:39 - ingenious traps upon exploring the idea
00:42 - I found that the game would quickly
00:43 - become very hard heavy and that it was
00:45 - too alike other projects I've done in
00:47 - the past I really wanted to do something
00:49 - different so scrapped that idea but
00:51 - decided to stick with the Egyptian theme
00:52 - my new idea making a spin-off to the old
00:55 - skool gold miner game when instead of
00:57 - taking from the surface you would be
00:59 - able to move underground using your
01:00 - grappling hook the miner where I decided
01:02 - to call mr. Dickens then stumbles upon
01:05 - what looks like modern technology
01:06 - proving that the Egyptians were way
01:08 - ahead of the time at this point I was
01:10 - ready to jump into unity I got the
01:12 - grappling mechanic done pretty quickly
01:13 - once the hook fired properly and I was
01:15 - able to keep track of what objects it
01:17 - hid I made the player move to the
01:18 - location of the hidden object the real
01:20 - challenge here was making the movement
01:22 - feel smooth and responsive I found that
01:24 - the best way of doing this was using a
01:25 - chain of kuroh teams that were each
01:27 - responsible for shooting the grappling
01:29 - hook returning it or pulling in the
01:31 - player I also decided to stay completely
01:33 - away from the Unity physics components
01:35 - only using colliders for hit detection
01:36 - this gave me complete control over speed
01:39 - and smoothing of the movement next up
01:41 - was collecting items I gave each item a
01:44 - rarity and await the width of the item
01:46 - was then calculated based on those
01:48 - factors I finally got a bit tired
01:50 - looking at those temporary sprites so I
01:52 - hopped into Photoshop and of course
01:53 - forgot to hit record anyway here's the
01:56 - result by the way when you aren't
01:58 - allowed to find textures on Google
01:59 - you'll find yourself using a lot of
02:01 - fractal noises staying on the subject of
02:03 - graphics I created some particle effects
02:05 - for the items I made a little explosion
02:07 - we're collecting them I also added some
02:09 - image effects especially in the motion
02:11 - blur made moving around the scene
02:13 - feel a lot more exciting a couple that
02:15 - with letting the camera move together
02:16 - with the grappling hook I quickly
02:18 - realized that the levels would have to
02:20 - be fairly large in order for that to be
02:21 - enough content to explore so I decided
02:23 - to generate the level procedurally by
02:25 - semi randomly placing items of varying
02:27 - rarity and size around the scene because
02:30 - the rarity and amount of items increases
02:32 - linearly with depth the player is
02:34 - incentivized to dig deeper I needed some
02:36 - UI to display the amount of money earned
02:38 - along with the countdown timer that ends
02:40 - the game after 2 minutes the user is
02:42 - then met with an end screen that
02:43 - displays the score I later added a
02:45 - locally stored high score as well I then
02:48 - added a main menu and a pause menu at
02:51 - this point the core game felt almost
02:53 - complete however I didn't have a way to
02:55 - communicate story to the user or display
02:58 - jokes for this I made a simple Pokemon
03:00 - inspired dialogue system that other
03:01 - systems could easily block into using
03:04 - events I also felt the need to do a bit
03:06 - of optimization especially because I
03:08 - wanted to make the levels even bigger so
03:10 - upon generating the map I created a huge
03:12 - list and populated it with all the items
03:14 - and their respective positions of scale
03:16 - and then loaded these in when the player
03:18 - got near destroyed them again when out
03:20 - of range this greatly reduced the number
03:22 - of objects in the scene
03:23 - at any given time after having played
03:25 - the game all the way through a couple of
03:26 - times I discovered that the time limit
03:28 - felt more like a constraint than a
03:30 - challenge to fix this
03:32 - I added bonus time to the items so the
03:34 - player could extend the play time by
03:35 - improving at the game time for music for
03:38 - this I used a great and simple program
03:40 - used by a lot of jammers called bus
03:42 - Casio busca Carl busca SOI anyway the
03:46 - main theme sounds like this
03:47 - [Music]
03:50 - and then created an audio manager that
03:53 - could easily play sounds with varying
03:55 - volume and pitch
03:56 - I used Adobe Audition to record a bunch
03:58 - of sounds I pretty much searched my
04:01 - entire apartment looking for objects to
04:03 - smash together at this point the game
04:05 - was pretty much ready to be packaged up
04:06 - and submitted so I quickly threw
04:08 - together an icon for the executable and
04:10 - began exporting to all of the different
04:11 - platforms the game was submitted just
04:14 - before the deadline which means very
04:16 - late at night for me this is how I
04:17 - looked at the end tired and happy that
04:20 - was pretty much my experience developing
04:21 - ticking I hope you will enjoy playing it
04:24 - there's a link in the description
04:25 - I would love to livestream the next
04:27 - Ludum dare II let me know if that is
04:28 - something you want to see in the
04:29 - comments other than that thanks for
04:32 - watching and I will see you in the next
04:33 - video thanks to all the awesome patreon
04:36 - supporters who donated in July and a
04:38 - special thanks to VC NP and you okay and
