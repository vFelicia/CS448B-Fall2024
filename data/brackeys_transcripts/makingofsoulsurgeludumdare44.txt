00:00 - saluton dari 44 just got revved up and
00:02 - the review process has now started
00:04 - if you don't know um Daria is a huge
00:06 - game developing competition where you
00:07 - get 48 hours to create a game from
00:10 - scratch using only art and code you make
00:12 - yourself the theme for this Jam was your
00:14 - life is currency and I actually thought
00:17 - that this theme was really hard for me
00:19 - it kind of suggested two routes the very
00:22 - literal interpretation which means that
00:23 - you will have to create a game featuring
00:25 - currency and some kind of purchasing
00:27 - system which is not the easiest thing in
00:29 - the world to make or a more thematic
00:31 - interpretation which quickly gets very
00:33 - hashtag deep now normally I start with a
00:36 - brainstorm session to get the ideas
00:38 - flowing but for some reason this time I
00:41 - instantly had a feeling that I wanted to
00:42 - create kind of a roguelike dungeon crawl
00:45 - game and once I heard the theme I
00:47 - immediately knew what the game should be
00:49 - about but before we get into that this
00:51 - video is sponsored by Jason Wyman he's
00:54 - the creator of the amazing unity3d
00:55 - masterclass which takes you all the way
00:57 - from the very fundamentals of game dev
00:59 - to using unity on a professional level
01:01 - it will teach you the principles of
01:03 - solid code architecture and how to build
01:05 - a variety of game types on top of that
01:07 - you also get familiar with packages like
01:09 - cinema Sheen timeline and pro builder
01:11 - what makes this course unique is that
01:12 - you get to work along with other
01:14 - students and get live one-on-one help
01:16 - from Jason himself he also has an
01:18 - amazing via course that will teach you
01:20 - how to work with VR and even make a game
01:23 - at the end you will have made multiple
01:25 - finished games and have the opportunity
01:27 - to customize and show off your unique
01:29 - work to the class sign up now and the
01:31 - first 50 people will get a free shirt
01:33 - from line of code of your choosing as
01:35 - well as a big discount and other bonuses
01:37 - on both courses simply click the link in
01:39 - description and get started so the basic
01:42 - idea is this you play as a greedy wizard
01:45 - who has made a pact with the god of
01:47 - death to grant you power in exchange for
01:50 - your service you can sacrifice your life
01:52 - in order to gain more power but you have
01:54 - to be careful every time you die you
01:56 - lose a fragment of your soul
02:00 - title many times and your soul will get
02:03 - stretched too thin to be recovered I
02:04 - thought this would work great with the
02:06 - theme because you are literally buying
02:08 - power in exchange for your life
02:10 - so with that idea in mind I jumped right
02:11 - into unity and started as always with
02:14 - player movement I quickly got a hexagon
02:17 - moving around the screen and pointing
02:19 - towards the mouse but I later realized
02:21 - that I didn't want the character to be
02:22 - controlled with the mouse
02:23 - so instead made him rotate towards the
02:25 - direction of travel next up was some
02:28 - basic enemy AI for this I used a very
02:30 - simple script that would slowly rotate
02:32 - and move the enemies towards the player
02:34 - once he was inside the search range this
02:37 - ended up working fine but it also meant
02:39 - I had to be careful with the levels I
02:41 - created since the enemies aren't using
02:42 - pathfinding and will easily get stuck
02:44 - running into obstacles actually I was
02:47 - surprised to learn that the Unity
02:48 - navigation system doesn't support 2d
02:51 - colliders yet that's definitely
02:52 - something I'd like to see in the future
02:54 - I then added the logic for sword
02:56 - fighting however there were no
02:57 - animations yet to show what was
02:59 - happening so I decided to jump straight
03:01 - to graphics
03:02 - I took some time drawing out a nice base
03:04 - room to act as a backdrop which looked
03:07 - alright but I wasn't completely
03:08 - satisfied with it so I tried just
03:11 - slapping on a huge adjustment layer and
03:12 - completely changing the color of the
03:14 - ground I think that definitely made it
03:16 - look more interesting and evil-looking I
03:18 - think created some nicer looking doors
03:20 - that I could simply slap on top and some
03:22 - sprites for the player character I
03:24 - decided not to give him arms and simply
03:26 - have the sword float in the air this way
03:28 - I didn't have to create four different
03:29 - attack animations and I think it kind of
03:32 - worked
03:32 - yay also later added a trail renderer to
03:35 - the sword to help make the attack
03:37 - animation pop finally I slept on some
03:39 - post-processing effects to help tie
03:41 - everything together as well as some
03:42 - length distortion and noise to make the
03:44 - levels look less flat now for day two
03:47 - I added some blood particles that spawn
03:49 - when you kill enemies as well some
03:50 - animations for when enemies or the
03:52 - player gets hit by an attack I then went
03:54 - on to create the death screen this is
03:57 - where you can use your sacrifice to
03:58 - increase your power at this point the UI
04:00 - didn't do anything but I later ended up
04:02 - adding the option between increasing
04:04 - your agility strength or resilience I
04:07 - would have loved to include more options
04:09 - here like the ability to cast spells
04:11 - purchase keys that unlock
04:13 - and so on but because of the time limit
04:15 - I had to be careful not to take on too
04:17 - much this is always difficult with game
04:19 - jams and this time actually kind of
04:21 - failed at that at the end of day one I
04:23 - was feeling really discouraged all the
04:26 - stuff I wanted to do ended up taking
04:27 - much longer than expected and I had
04:29 - trouble seeing the whole picture or how
04:31 - I would manage to get the game to a
04:33 - playable state
04:34 - luckily a good night's sleep helped a
04:36 - lot and I ended up having a really
04:38 - productive second day but it's important
04:40 - to remember that game gems are about
04:42 - having fun and it's just much easier to
04:44 - have fun if you don't overburden
04:46 - yourself and stick to something simple
04:48 - now feeling refreshed the second day I
04:50 - added pentagrams that act like
04:52 - checkpoints throughout the game however
04:54 - you have to be careful about using them
04:56 - since they require you to sacrifice your
04:59 - life in order to activate them which
05:01 - means you will lose a soul fragment I
05:03 - think this idea of hurting your
05:05 - character to save your progress was
05:07 - really fun to play around with now one
05:09 - of the big challenges of this game was
05:11 - to moving between rooms for this I had
05:13 - to come up with a good loading system
05:15 - that also made it easy for me to add
05:16 - more rooms in the editor and connect
05:19 - them together using doors I tried out a
05:21 - bunch of different systems but ended up
05:23 - with this so basically each room is a
05:26 - game object that gets activated when it
05:28 - is entered each door has a reference to
05:30 - the room object that it leads to this
05:32 - way progress in each room is saved since
05:35 - all the objects simply get disabled and
05:37 - not destroyed when leaving a room
05:39 - however when the player dies I want all
05:42 - the rooms to reset but things like the
05:44 - player game manager and so on to remain
05:47 - the same to do this I put all the rooms
05:50 - in a separate room scene and loaded that
05:53 - onto a base scene with the player in it
05:55 - this way when I wanted to reset the
05:57 - rooms I could simply reload the rooms
05:59 - scene of course there are some
06:01 - limitations to this and it isn't great
06:03 - for performance if you have a huge
06:04 - amount of rooms but for the scope of
06:06 - this project it worked perfectly I then
06:08 - added soul fragments that can be picked
06:10 - up to help you progress further and
06:12 - create some sprites for the enemies they
06:14 - kind of ended up looking like dwarf
06:16 - zombies in turtlenecks but nevertheless
06:18 - I was proud of them next up I made some
06:20 - rocks and gravestones I could scatter
06:22 - around to give the room some variation I
06:24 - added a game over screen
06:26 - and finally I created some enemy
06:28 - variations of course I had to create a
06:30 - larger enemy that moved slower but did
06:32 - more damage and had more health I also
06:34 - made a ranged enemy that would shoot out
06:36 - fireballs which I ended up reusing to
06:39 - make the head of the enemy itself I also
06:41 - created tiny zombies that would quickly
06:43 - sprint towards you and at this point I
06:45 - had enough assets to start creating a
06:47 - bunch of interesting rooms so I did I
06:50 - played around with combining different
06:52 - enemy types of varying difficulty I
06:54 - placed pentagrams and soul fragments in
06:57 - different corridors I created dead ends
06:59 - that would punish you if you walked into
07:00 - them and finally it was time for the big
07:03 - boss except at this point I'd spent so
07:06 - much time creating all these rooms that
07:08 - I pretty much didn't have time to create
07:10 - an interesting boss fight so instead I
07:12 - pulled an Indiana Jones and made the
07:14 - pass team really big and scary only for
07:17 - the player to realize that he can be
07:18 - killed in one hit no problem and that
07:21 - was pretty much it
07:22 - after getting my lovely wife Sophia to
07:24 - play through it all I realized that she
07:26 - could just run through the rooms without
07:28 - fighting the enemies so I made the doors
07:30 - locked until you kill all enemies in the
07:32 - room I've said this many times but game
07:35 - testing is important always get someone
07:37 - else to try a game and with that it was
07:40 - time to export I created a quick icon
07:42 - and submitted it to the gem around 2:00
07:44 - a.m. I was tired but happy and mostly
07:47 - just surprised that I managed to finish
07:48 - in time and that's pretty much it for
07:50 - this video if you enjoyed it make sure
07:52 - to subscribe and check out some of the
07:54 - other behind-the-scenes videos I've done
07:55 - for previous game jams on that
07:57 - thanks for watching and I will see you
07:59 - in the next video also supposed to think
08:01 - hey do you want to do it yeah you should
08:03 - do it all right thanks to all of the
