00:00 - since the last video a lot of you guys
00:01 - asked me how you can create some kind of
00:02 - score for the game that's what we're
00:04 - going to be making today it also gives
00:06 - us the chance to play around with some
00:07 - unity UI exciting stuff let's get
00:09 - started let's begin by getting a bit
00:11 - more organized
00:12 - first off let's create a folder for all
00:14 - of our scripts let's name it scripts
00:16 - we'll place our follow player play
00:18 - coalition and play movement in there
00:20 - let's also make one for our materials
00:22 - again we'll call this one materials and
00:24 - drag our obstacle mat and player mat in
00:26 - there I think we can just leave the rest
00:28 - here let's then correct something that's
00:30 - been knowing me since the last video and
00:32 - that is the collision detection
00:33 - sometimes it happens that our player
00:36 - actually passes through one of the
00:37 - obstacles it's something that you guys
00:39 - have also noticed in the comments to get
00:41 - more accurate physics detection we can
00:43 - select their obstacles and choose
00:44 - continuous under collision detection
00:47 - we'll do the same thing to our player
00:49 - we'll also go under edit project
00:51 - settings time and decrease our fixed
00:53 - time step I'll just set it to zero point
00:55 - zero one this means that unis will more
00:57 - frequently update our physics and
00:59 - therefore the chance of missing a
01:01 - collision is reduced this also means
01:02 - that we'll probably have to select our
01:04 - player and increase the forward force a
01:06 - little bit I'll just set it to something
01:07 - like 8000 and I played around with it
01:09 - and found that a sideways force of about
01:12 - 120 felt pretty good so now when we hit
01:14 - play everything should look and feel
01:16 - pretty much the same way but it just
01:18 - feels a lot nicer and the collisions are
01:20 - going to be much better I'm also just
01:21 - going to fix my OCD by setting our
01:23 - played to a Y position of exactly one
01:26 - alright so let's get started with our UI
01:28 - piece creating UI in unity is pretty
01:30 - much the same thing as creating anything
01:31 - else we go to the hierarchy we
01:34 - right-click we go under UI now and we
01:37 - can select text
01:38 - this creates a canvas a canvas is a
01:40 - place to display all of our different UI
01:42 - elements and a text object which of
01:44 - course allows us to configure our text
01:46 - but we can't currently see it anywhere
01:48 - so have a good look at it let's switch
01:50 - to 2d mode that select our text and hit
01:52 - F it's also zoom out a bit so we can see
01:55 - our entire canvas
01:56 - notice that the canvas will resize to
01:58 - fit the size of our game view this is
02:00 - basically the screen that we can paint
02:02 - stuff on for text object here I'm just
02:03 - going to move it up and put it kind of
02:05 - in the upper center I'm also going to
02:08 - change our text alignment to Center on
02:10 - both the horizontal and the
02:12 - you can also see that we can size about
02:14 - text and if we hold down alt we will
02:16 - size from the center however it doesn't
02:18 - actually change the font size it just
02:20 - changes the boundaries of our text so in
02:22 - order to actually scale about text we'll
02:24 - have to increase the font size over here
02:26 - just make sure you make plenty of room
02:27 - for the text so that if your player
02:29 - reaches a really high score it's not
02:31 - going to clip we can also set the
02:32 - horizontal overflow down here to Ola
02:34 - flow which means that if it should reach
02:37 - one of the boundaries it's just going to
02:38 - keep going something like this then
02:41 - let's change the text to something like
02:43 - two hundred and fifty just to give
02:44 - ourselves an idea of what's going on and
02:46 - I'm going to definitely also bump up the
02:48 - font size some more currently when we
02:50 - resize our window say if we maximize it
02:52 - our text is kind of parented to the
02:54 - center so text will always be a fixed
02:56 - distance from the center this also means
02:58 - that it doesn't resize and I kind of
03:01 - wanted to do that so let's select our
03:02 - canvas and let's change the UI scale
03:04 - mode from constant pixel size meaning
03:06 - that everything doesn't resize to scale
03:08 - with screen size and I wanted to kind of
03:11 - try and match the height you can see now
03:12 - that if we maximize our game view the
03:14 - font gets bigger as well and I really
03:16 - like that I'm also going to take the
03:18 - color of our text and make it completely
03:19 - white I think that gives a pretty cool
03:22 - faded look finally for the look of our
03:23 - text I really really hate Arial it's
03:27 - kind of a passion I mean there's a lot
03:28 - of bad funds out there but please
03:30 - anything but Arial so I'm just going to
03:32 - go ahead and download another one there
03:33 - are a lot of great fun our cows out
03:35 - there that font ogle font and so on I'm
03:38 - just going to go and open my browser I'm
03:40 - gonna search for Roboto
03:41 - this is a fun made by Google and its
03:43 - really nice modern and simple I'm just
03:45 - going to select this font click down
03:47 - here and we can now download it as a zip
03:50 - file so I'm just going to unzip that
03:52 - file by hitting extract all and extract
03:54 - and now you can just select all of the
03:56 - different font versions and drag them
03:58 - directly into unity voila
04:00 - we'll also go ahead and create a
04:01 - separate folder for this called fonts
04:03 - and shift select all of them and drag
04:05 - them in there and it's that easy now we
04:07 - can go on to our text and change the
04:08 - font to whatever version of Roboto that
04:11 - we like I'm just going to go with
04:13 - something like Roboto then actually we
04:15 - might wanna make the text black here
04:17 - just to make it more visible that kind
04:19 - of completes the look of our text but
04:21 - it's still not updating I mean if we
04:22 - play it's just going to be stuck at 250
04:25 - and I want this to
04:26 - count up by the mirror you could also
04:27 - count up the score by time but I think
04:30 - since this is about reaching as far as
04:32 - possible it's pretty fun to measure
04:33 - distance to do that we go ahead and
04:35 - create a new script on our text object
04:37 - I'm going to call it score and they
04:39 - create an ad let's double click it and
04:40 - as always we're just going to be
04:42 - removing the two using tags up there and
04:44 - the start method so in order to keep
04:46 - track of how far we reach into a level
04:48 - we need a reference to our player
04:49 - because our player has a position and we
04:51 - can use that to make sure his distance
04:53 - traveled it's the same as any other
04:55 - variable we start with public then the
04:57 - type here we could either write game
04:59 - object and this gives us a lot of
05:00 - information about our player but we only
05:02 - want the position and therefore we're
05:04 - going to type transform instead because
05:06 - remember the transform component is
05:08 - responsible for position rotation and
05:10 - scale we're going to go ahead and write
05:12 - player as the name and now in our update
05:14 - loop we should be able to access player
05:16 - dot position Z and this is how many
05:19 - units we've moved on the z axis of
05:21 - course we have to make sure that our
05:22 - player stats add a Z of 0 but indeed he
05:25 - does so if we just want to display the
05:27 - position of our player here we can say
05:29 - debug that lock and then insert player
05:31 - dot position dot Z into the parentheses
05:34 - let's save this go into unity select
05:36 - that text object and drag in our player
05:38 - if we then switch to the console and hit
05:40 - play we should get a bunch of debug
05:42 - deadlock messages constantly saying the
05:44 - updated position of our player on the z
05:46 - axis now all we need to do is transfer
05:49 - this value onto the UI element and
05:51 - that's really easy to do as well just
05:53 - like we needed a reference from a scorer
05:55 - to the player we also need a reference
05:57 - from our score to the text so again
05:59 - we'll go into unity and whenever we're
06:01 - dealing with UI elements we actually
06:03 - need to include some more functions so
06:05 - we'll go up here and say that we're
06:06 - going to be using unity engine dot UI
06:09 - and this now allows us to write code for
06:11 - the user interface we can then create
06:13 - another variable this is also going to
06:15 - be public and it's going to be of type
06:16 - text and this is of course because the
06:19 - name of the component that is
06:20 - responsible for text is text and so we
06:24 - make it of type text and we can give
06:26 - this some fancy name I'm just going to
06:27 - go with score text and close it with the
06:30 - semicolon then down here instead of
06:32 - debug dead logging opposition will say
06:34 - score text and now we can access all the
06:37 - different parts of our text we can
06:38 - change the fonts
06:39 - we can change the color and we can
06:42 - change the text itself so score text at
06:44 - text allows us to change the text
06:46 - content we can then set that equal to
06:48 - player table position dot Z however if
06:52 - we try and run this it is going to throw
06:54 - an error and we can actually already see
06:56 - it if we hover over this red part it
06:58 - says cannot implicitly convert type
07:00 - float to string so what's happening well
07:03 - our position on the z-axis is a float
07:05 - number remember float is one of the
07:07 - basic datatypes and whenever we want to
07:10 - set our text equal to something it
07:12 - requires a string a string is also one
07:14 - of the fundamental data types and it's
07:16 - what we use to store text so we need to
07:18 - convert this number into text to do that
07:21 - we simply write dot at the end here and
07:23 - then to string and we need to follow
07:26 - that with two parenthesis it's a bit
07:28 - weird that we have to do this I mean
07:30 - it's still going to be a number but now
07:31 - it's going to be a number inside of a
07:33 - string and that's the difference there
07:35 - for now just write after me so if we
07:36 - save this head back into unity we need
07:39 - to of course reference our score text so
07:40 - we'll drag in our text component and hit
07:42 - play and we can now see the UI updating
07:45 - however it's doing so with a very high
07:47 - precision and I think there's no reason
07:48 - for us to have decimal places in here
07:50 - only whole numbers to do that we simply
07:53 - need to format our text and the to
07:55 - string method actually allows us to do
07:57 - that really easily all we need to do is
07:59 - go in here and in quotation marks write
08:02 - a zero if we save that now go into unity
08:05 - and hit play we should see that it
08:06 - displays our distance in meters but only
08:09 - in whole numbers much much better and we
08:12 - can see how cool that looks in full
08:14 - screen if you think something about your
08:15 - text doesn't look super crisp you can
08:18 - select the canvas and choose pixel
08:20 - perfect this sometimes can make the UI
08:21 - render a lot sharper that's pretty much
08:23 - it for this video if you liked it make
08:25 - sure to subscribe so you don't miss a
08:26 - future episode also because of my
08:28 - traveling I had to delay the monthly
08:29 - live stream a bit but I will be
08:31 - live-streaming very soon make sure to
08:32 - follow me at Facebook facebook.com slash
08:35 - brickies over twitter at brackets tweet
08:37 - to get notified when that will happen
08:39 - you don't want to miss it it's always a
08:41 - lot of fun and I just did a video on
08:43 - creating destructible objects that I
08:44 - think could fit really nicely into this
08:46 - one if you want to have the player or
08:47 - the obstacles break when they collide so
08:50 - check that out here on that thanks for
08:51 - watching and I was
08:52 - you in the next video thanks off the
08:55 - awesome people who donated in February
08:56 - and a special thanks to Derek Hughes
08:58 - Kirk faithful Merrifield James Calhoun
09:00 - and Jason Latino if you want to become a
09:02 - picture in yourself you can do so a
