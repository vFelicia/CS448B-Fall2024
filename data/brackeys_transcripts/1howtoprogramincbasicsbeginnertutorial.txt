00:00 - Thanks for tuning in at Brackeys
00:03 - Hello, everyone and [welcome] to the first video in how to program in [C] sharp
00:08 - This course is going to be quite different from what I normally do which is game development tutorials
00:14 - but I've been getting a lot [of] requests on making a course that really focuses on the C-Sharp language and
00:22 - this is super awesome, because it will allow us to really give an
00:26 - Introduction to what programming means and reading and writing an understanding code whilst learning a language
00:34 - That can pretty much be used for any kind of software development whether you want to do web development
00:40 - whether you want to develop for PC or Mac or
00:44 - Game development or a mobile app development C-sharp pretty much does it all by now
00:50 - So C-Sharp is super cool and we can really focus on the language and understanding it
00:55 - so what we are going to be doing today as
00:58 - First off what can see shop do we just went through that then we're going to be talking about console applications
01:04 - What is an IDE we're going to install the software [we're] going to be using throughout the [course] and we're going to create our first project
01:11 - If all of this seems very easy and fundamental [to] you
01:16 - Please just go ahead and skip onto the next video where we will delve into the programming side
01:21 - So first off let me explain
01:23 - What kind of software we are going to be writing in this course?
01:26 - So we're going to be making what is called console applications?
01:30 - And if you don't know what this is there's an image on the screen right now
01:33 - [I] agree with you [that] it does not look very appealing
01:37 - but it's great for really focusing on the general language because it's not so
01:43 - specific on
01:45 - Game development tools or mobile app tools or anything it's it's a lot of language
01:52 - but not much api
01:54 - so the api stands for application programming
01:57 - Interface, and it's basically a series of commands that you can use so game development uses some
02:05 - one kind of Api and other software development uses other kinds of Api s
02:11 - So that's a really simplified very way of looking at it by light. I think it will work for now
02:18 - so an
02:19 - Ide also sounds really frightening? It is really not it stands for integrated development
02:25 - environment, and it's basically just a software that you [use] to programming so if if you're in a video
02:32 - Editor you might use premiere pro or sony Vegas and if you're a programmer you might might use visual studio
02:40 - xcode
02:41 - Or what we are going to be using which is
02:44 - [monodevelop], and it's even an extended version of monodevelop called Xamarin studio, so
02:51 - when you learn this you can also do app development right after so we're going to be using mono develop and
03:00 - in an extended version called Xamarin studio
03:05 - [just] so you know. They [are] basically the [same] thing just don't get them confused
03:11 - You just need to know that they might use [different] naming sometimes
03:17 - so let's dive [right] into it and
03:19 - Install our first Ide so let's head over to our browser and let's open up
03:25 - Monodevelop Com let's hit download now to download the file
03:31 - But first we have to say select an operating system
03:34 - So if you're on Mac click that and make sure you first install this package down here which will download the mono framework plus
03:43 - [gtK] what these does is not important for now?
03:46 - But you need them so download them and install them and then right after you can download and install monodevelop itself
03:54 - But we [own] windows, so we're going to select that and here you will need to first install
04:00 - gtK [for.net] and then the Dotnet framework
04:03 - So download both of them and install them and then right after we can download the installer itself
04:10 - So I'm going to hit download and it will start downloading and you can see now. It's not cold Mono develop anymore now
04:17 - It's called Summer in studio. So that's why I wanted to clear [that] up
04:20 - so when it's downloaded simply open it and
04:24 - We will run [installer] here. I'm just going to change my directory because I have a secondary hard disk and [sh]
04:30 - I would rather you have it sit on so [exam] [or] in
04:33 - studio
04:35 - Let's say it okay next and it's going to install the reason why we hit
04:40 - Yes here the reason why we're using summer in studio is because it's cross platform. Which is really awesome
04:46 - [visual] studio is only [four] four windows. It's made by Microsoft and xcode is only for
04:53 - Mac, and it's made by apple, and they're both good takes, but I mean for what we're going to be doing here
05:00 - Which is console applications samer in studio is going to be more than enough?
05:04 - so hit launch summer in studio and hit finish and
05:08 - It might go ahead and prompt you here to update it often [just] pops up and say hey there's some updates
05:17 - Do you want to install and simply just hit install and restyle?
05:21 - I think it's called and and you will be good to go. It's always great to keep your software updated
05:27 - So we're going to go ahead and click new Solution and solutions are
05:31 - basically like projects if you think of them in that respect, so let's hit new solution and
05:39 - We are going to be making a console project in the C-Sharp language, so let's hit a hit undo C-sharp
05:48 - click on the C-Sharp Category we can also do f sharp or VB net or I'll do stuff and
05:54 - then hit console project
05:57 - And when you have the selected we are going to do a name so let's call this
06:02 - first
06:04 - console
06:05 - project and
06:07 - we're just going to keep the solution name the same as the name and
06:11 - I'm just going to change the location to [be]
06:14 - on the desktop and
06:18 - Let's hit create directory for solution
06:22 - And let's hit ok let's actually do solution name first console project
06:28 - Solution just so we keep them separate because you can have several projects under one solution
06:37 - There it's not really important for this tutorial, but let's just name it correctly
06:43 - from the beginning, it's not good to teach bad habits, so let's hit ok and
06:49 - It will start creating our project and now this right here is our first
06:56 - C-Sharp program so this here is
06:59 - C-Sharp it might look very frightening and difficult to understand at this very moment
07:07 - But in the next video we are going to go through everything explain it
07:11 - We're going to write some code ourself, and we're going to launch our first console program, so that's going to be really awesome
07:17 - [I] hope you're looking forward to it as much as I am
07:21 - It's always fun to play around with these console apps, and yeah, thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
