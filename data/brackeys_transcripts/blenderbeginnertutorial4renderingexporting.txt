00:00 - in this video we'll have a look at how
00:01 - you can set up lights and materials for
00:02 - blend recycles in order to create a cool
00:04 - looking render for those of you
00:06 - interested in game development we'll
00:07 - also have a look at how you can export
00:08 - the model and import it into Unity so
00:10 - let's get into it so let's begin by
00:12 - making a cool render of a barrel to do
00:14 - that we first want to go to the top here
00:16 - and change from blender render to Cycles
00:19 - Render Cycles is blender's rate Trace
00:21 - based render engine it's been a part of
00:23 - blender for quite some time now and it's
00:25 - really awesome the first thing we want
00:27 - to do is go ahead and switch into
00:28 - material mode here and as you can see
00:30 - when we switched to Cycles we lost our
00:32 - textures that's because Cycles has a
00:34 - whole different way of defining
00:36 - materials we go to the materials tab now
00:39 - we still have our two materials but you
00:40 - can see down here that we have this big
00:42 - button called use nodes that's because
00:44 - blend it allows us to create custom
00:46 - materials using a node-based system to
00:48 - do that let's first split our view by
00:50 - going to the top here and dragging out
00:52 - let's then change this view into the
00:55 - node editor and let's get rid of this
00:57 - panel now there's currently nothing on
00:59 - the grid and that's because this
01:00 - material isn't using notes we can either
01:02 - hit use notes here or down here and now
01:05 - two nodes will appear we can see that we
01:07 - have a material output this is where we
01:09 - want all of our data to end and we have
01:11 - a diffuse node this allows us to give
01:13 - our object a color and blender will then
01:16 - automatically calculate Lighting on that
01:18 - model using a diffuse Shader the diffuse
01:21 - Shader determines the general color of a
01:23 - material when light shines on it and you
01:25 - can see we can choose a color here but
01:27 - instead of using a simple color we want
01:29 - to use use a texture as our color data
01:32 - to do that we hit shift a to add a new
01:34 - node and the node that we want to add is
01:36 - a texture node and we want to use an
01:38 - image texture because remember we
01:40 - created an image in Photoshop and so we
01:42 - want to reference that let's place our
01:44 - note somewhere on the screen I'm going
01:45 - to place it out here let's open the
01:48 - texture on our system so let's it open
01:50 - and the texture is called barrel.png
01:51 - then instead of using a Syle color here
01:54 - will take our image textures color and
01:57 - Link it into our color Channel and as
01:59 - you can see you can now see the texture
02:00 - on the object now of course the Rings
02:02 - are currently using a separate material
02:04 - we should go in here and do the same
02:06 - thing for this one let's hit use notes
02:08 - and we could put the texture in here as
02:10 - well but since we're just using a single
02:12 - color on the texture we might as well
02:14 - Define it in here however I want to add
02:16 - a bit of shine onto these rings to do
02:19 - that let's hit shift a create another
02:21 - Shader this one is going to be the
02:23 - glossy Shader and as the name might
02:25 - suggest this adds glass into our object
02:27 - and here we have a problem because we
02:29 - can either take the output of our
02:30 - diffuse Shader and put it into our
02:32 - material output or the output of our
02:34 - glass but we want a mix between them so
02:37 - what we do is go in here and add yet
02:38 - another Shader and this time we add the
02:40 - mix Shader this allows us to blend
02:43 - multiple shaders together so if I go
02:45 - ahead and move this into the middle we
02:46 - can have our glass Shader go into the
02:48 - bottom Shader our diffuse Shader go into
02:50 - the top one and this value then
02:52 - determines the blend between them I want
02:54 - to take our glossy Shader here and
02:56 - definitely darken it a bit as well so
02:58 - now we should see that when we start
02:59 - adding lights to our scene the Rings
03:01 - look more metallic and glossy than the
03:04 - wood cool so now that we're satisfied
03:06 - with our materials let's go ahead and
03:07 - right click here hit join area and let's
03:09 - click on the right in order to close our
03:12 - node editor and let's have a look at
03:13 - adding lights so what a lot of people
03:15 - assume is that in order to add lights
03:17 - into our render we go shift a we go on
03:21 - lamp and we add one of the lights in
03:23 - here however these lights are actually
03:25 - used in the blender render engine and
03:27 - not for Cycles in Cycles we have a much
03:30 - more realistic approach to lighting that
03:32 - means that in order to create a light we
03:34 - first make a surface that should emit
03:36 - light and we then apply an emissive
03:38 - material to that so in our case let's go
03:40 - ahead and hit shift a add in a plane we
03:42 - can rotate this plane on the X by about
03:45 - 12 120Â° we then move it out on the Y
03:48 - here I'm going to shift to the top view
03:50 - by hitting numpad 7 moving this over to
03:52 - the side rotating it around the z-axis
03:55 - and definitely scaling it up so now we
03:57 - have a surface that we can use to emit
03:59 - line onto our Barrel first let's go down
04:01 - here and change our preview to rendered
04:04 - as we can see there's currently no
04:05 - lights in our scene so with our plane
04:07 - selected let's go and hit new and the
04:09 - material we want to use is not diffuse
04:11 - but emission and as you can see it's
04:13 - currently casting a tiny bit of light
04:15 - onto our Barrel let's go ahead and bump
04:17 - this up to something like 14 and there
04:19 - we go we have light in our scene now
04:21 - this is of course a bit boring let's
04:23 - switch into material mode and add some
04:25 - more we'll call this one the main light
04:27 - and we'll rename the object to the same
04:29 - thing let's duplicate it by hitting
04:31 - shift d and let's move it over here on
04:33 - the other side let's switch to the top
04:36 - view and actually move it a bit behind
04:38 - the barrel let's also rotate it around
04:40 - the z-axis and rotate it forward now I
04:43 - want this light to be different and
04:45 - therefore we want to create another
04:46 - material what a lot of people do is go
04:48 - in here now and adjust the strength and
04:49 - the color but as you can see that
04:51 - actually changes for both the lights
04:53 - because they're both using the same
04:54 - material called mainl so we want to go
04:57 - in here and hit the plus this is going
04:59 - to add a new material with the same base
05:01 - settings and we want to call this
05:03 - backlight we then bump down the strength
05:05 - to say eight and set the color to a more
05:08 - bluish tone we can see what that looks
05:10 - like in our render so this could
05:12 - definitely be more blue cool and I
05:15 - actually want to go ahead and add one
05:16 - more light this is a very standard way
05:18 - of lighting a model it's called
05:20 - three-point lighting we have our main
05:21 - light which is also the strongest one
05:24 - emitting either a neutral or warm color
05:26 - and this is placed forward and a bit to
05:28 - the side then at the back have another
05:30 - light this is called the back light or
05:31 - the rim light this has a more bluish
05:33 - tone and a smaller strength then we
05:35 - normally have another light in the front
05:37 - so I'm going to duplicate on Main light
05:38 - switch to the top view here and move it
05:40 - over it's also rotated and this is much
05:43 - similar to the main light but it's not
05:45 - as strong let's go and make a copy of
05:47 - the material let's call this material
05:49 - secondary light and let's set the
05:52 - strength here to something around 10 so
05:54 - now when we switch to rendered mode we
05:56 - can see that we have nice and even
05:57 - Lighting on our model and we have a bit
05:59 - of color detail at the edge because of
06:01 - our Rim light now we can go ahead and
06:02 - add a ground plane so let's hit shift a
06:05 - mesh plane let's grab this and move it
06:07 - on the z-axis to place it at the bottom
06:09 - of our Barrel let's then scale it up
06:11 - let's go into rendered as we can see the
06:13 - plane is currently totally white let's
06:15 - go in here and add a new material we
06:16 - want this material to be H actually like
06:19 - the idea of this being a light orange I
06:21 - think we should move the ring light here
06:22 - over to the side a bit more and maybe
06:24 - also rotate it to point more towards our
06:26 - barrel and if we switch into top view
06:29 - also o think we should take our
06:30 - secondary light and move it back a bit
06:32 - let's now position our view where we
06:34 - want it switch into rendered mode and
06:36 - let's snap our camera to a view to do
06:39 - that we go view align View and we hit
06:41 - align active camera to view now it's all
06:44 - about fine-tuning a bit let's take our
06:45 - Rim light here and move it out even
06:47 - further and if you want you can select
06:48 - your camera go to the camera settings
06:50 - and here we can change the focal length
06:52 - so if we want to zoom out we'll make
06:53 - this value smaller but I like it at 35
06:56 - now when we satisfied with our render
06:58 - let's go to our render settings I'm
07:00 - going to select full HD for our
07:01 - resolution 1920 x 1080 and I'm going to
07:04 - set the percentage scale for a
07:05 - resolution to 100% to get our max
07:07 - resolution I'm then going to go to where
07:09 - it says sampling and increase the
07:11 - samples for our render to something like
07:13 - 512 the higher you set your samples the
07:15 - less of this grainy effect you'll see on
07:17 - your image so for a preview we're only
07:19 - currently using 32 so I think 512 is
07:22 - going to be enough for render the higher
07:23 - the samples the more the rendering time
07:25 - so keep that in mind and with all those
07:27 - settings let's go ahead and hit render
07:29 - now depending on the complexity of your
07:30 - scene and the settings you've chosen
07:32 - this can take some time I'll see you
07:34 - when it's
07:34 - [Music]
07:37 - done and I think it looks awesome so if
07:39 - you're not satisfied with your render
07:41 - you can hit f11 make the changes you
07:43 - need and simply hit the render button
07:45 - once more I'm going to hit f11 again
07:47 - because I like my render and to save it
07:49 - I'm going to go to image and hit save as
07:51 - image I'm going to call it Barrel render
07:54 - and hit save so now you should have a
07:56 - nice Barrel render PNG image that you
07:58 - can send over to your friends or I'm
08:00 - also going to go into blender and hit
08:01 - file save as and save this as a separate
08:04 - file called Barrel render it's a good
08:07 - idea to keep multiple versions going so
08:09 - exporting the object is actually really
08:11 - simple the first thing that we want to
08:12 - go ahead and do is delete our camera and
08:14 - any other objects you might have in the
08:16 - scene we only want the object that we
08:18 - want to export we can then select a
08:19 - barrel go under the materials panel and
08:22 - let's remove all but one material let's
08:24 - rename this material to Barrel we can do
08:27 - this because all of our materials are
08:28 - using the same Tech and have the same
08:30 - settings and so we actually only need
08:32 - one material for this object if your
08:34 - object needs more materials well then
08:35 - simply leave all them in here a really
08:37 - nice thing to do when exporting for
08:39 - games is to make sure that your pivot is
08:40 - set correctly in the case of a barrel we
08:42 - could definitely put this at the center
08:44 - of our object but personally I would
08:46 - prefer if the pivot was at the bottom so
08:48 - that we could simply drag it onto our
08:50 - ground to do that we shift into edit
08:52 - mode select all of our object switch
08:54 - into front mode and orthographic I'm
08:57 - then going to grab it and move it up on
08:59 - the Z until it just rests on the center
09:01 - point when we then switch out of edit
09:03 - mode we can see that our pivot is now at
09:05 - the bottom so let's save our scene and
09:07 - to export an object let also go file
09:10 - export fbx fbx is pretty much the
09:12 - standard file format for exporting
09:14 - models it's good because it's supported
09:16 - by a whole lot of programs and it stores
09:18 - pretty much all the data we need
09:20 - anywhere from the meesh of our object to
09:22 - UVS to material data to rigging and
09:25 - animation so fpx is awesome let's just
09:27 - call this one barrel. fpx X and hit
09:30 - export if you now navigate to where
09:31 - you've exported your file we should see
09:33 - that we have both the barrel. blend and
09:35 - the barrel. fbx along of course with our
09:38 - texture the cool thing about Unity is
09:40 - that we can actually use the blender
09:41 - file directly we don't even need to
09:43 - export to fbx but a lot of software do
09:46 - need you to do that so now you know how
09:48 - I'm now going to close down blender
09:50 - select the blend file and the texture
09:52 - and drag both of them into the unity
09:54 - project that I have opened by the way if
09:56 - you want to get started with game
09:57 - development or just learn how to use
09:59 - Unity I have a course specifically for
10:01 - you check it out it's on the screen now
10:03 - as you can see it's imported both our
10:05 - Barrel model and our texture and it's
10:07 - gone ahead and automatically created a
10:09 - Unity material as well called Barrel now
10:11 - we simply need to drag our model into
10:14 - the scene and it's working but it's
10:15 - currently looking a bit weird the reason
10:17 - for this is that we often have to
10:19 - configure a few settings inside of our
10:20 - engine so let's select the barrel
10:22 - material and the first thing we want to
10:24 - do here is change the color to white
10:26 - otherwise we'll apply a tint on top of
10:29 - our texture and we just want to use the
10:30 - texture as is we'll also take the
10:32 - smoothness and set it down to zero to
10:34 - give us that flat low poly look and now
10:37 - we have it we now have our Barrel inside
10:39 - of our scene and we can use it as we
10:41 - want for our game you will notice that
10:43 - there's currently an animator component
10:44 - attached to it that's a bit weird
10:46 - because we don't have any animation on
10:48 - the object to get rid of that we'll just
10:49 - select the model go under rig hit none
10:52 - and hit apply and voila it's gone
10:55 - finally and this is probably the coolest
10:57 - thing about using blender and unity
10:58 - together if we thought hey there's
11:00 - something about this we want to change
11:02 - say we wanted to stretch the top part a
11:04 - bit all we need to do is double click on
11:06 - the model file it will automatically
11:08 - open the file up in blender we can now
11:10 - go in here and make all of the changes
11:12 - that we want we can save them and when
11:15 - we now hit into Unity it automatically
11:17 - updates it's just awesome so that's
11:20 - pretty much it for this video and the
11:21 - entire series I've covered all of the
11:23 - fundamental blender stuff that I wanted
11:25 - to cover of course you can do so much
11:27 - more in blender than what is showed in
11:28 - these videos I'll have some links in the
11:30 - description to where I can find some
11:31 - more blender tutorials and to those of
11:33 - you who want to create a character for
11:34 - your game check out Sebastian L's videos
11:36 - on character creation in blender and of
11:38 - course make sure to subscribe to this
11:39 - channel if you guys want to see more
11:40 - blender videos let me know especially if
11:42 - there's a certain topic that you want me
11:44 - to cover and to those of you who are
11:45 - worried that I won't be doing Unity
11:46 - tutorials do not worry I love unity and
11:49 - I won't stop using it anytime soon so
11:51 - thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed
11:52 - the series and I will see you in the
