00:00 - guys I finally did it I managed not to
00:02 - miss out on a game jam that's right
00:07 - the second practice game jam just got
00:08 - wrapped up and the review process has
00:10 - now started
00:11 - we got three hundred and thirty three
00:13 - entries which is not only amazing he's
00:15 - also apparently an ancient number so if
00:17 - that excites you yay
00:19 - anyway the Gulf of the gem was to make a
00:21 - game from scratch in only one week the
00:24 - theme was love is blind which the admins
00:26 - from the firm was so kind as to hide for
00:28 - me until it got announced which meant
00:30 - that I got to experience the usual
00:31 - emotional roller coaster of ooh that's
00:34 - really cool wait a minute I have no idea
00:36 - what to make with that I've never get
00:38 - another idea in my life again ooh that
00:40 - might work let's do this so my first
00:42 - thought when hearing the theme was
00:43 - that's a really good Jack White song the
00:45 - next thought was to make a puzzle
00:47 - platformer yes that was literally how it
00:49 - went so far most of my jam games have
00:51 - been score based the kind of games where
00:53 - you start over and over again in an
00:55 - effort to do better however for this
00:57 - game I really wanted to try my luck with
00:58 - something different so I went with a
01:00 - more level based structure this of
01:02 - course meant that I had to delve into
01:03 - the vast and daunting world of level
01:06 - design the basic idea of the game was
01:08 - this two players must collaborate to
01:10 - make it to that date because the player
01:11 - characters are in love they are blind to
01:13 - everything the other player touches the
01:15 - two players need to both work around
01:17 - this and use it as an advantage to help
01:19 - each other succeed and with that it was
01:21 - time to get cracking but first this
01:23 - video is sponsored by Jason Wyman he's
01:25 - the creator of the amazing unity3d
01:27 - masterclass which takes you all the way
01:29 - from the very fundamentals of game dev
01:30 - to using unity on a professional level
01:32 - it will teach you the principles of
01:34 - solid code architecture and how to build
01:36 - a variety of game types on top of that
01:38 - you will also get familiar with packages
01:40 - like cinema Sheen timeline and pro
01:42 - builder what makes this course unique is
01:44 - that you get to work along with other
01:45 - students and get live one-on-one help
01:47 - from Jason himself he also has an
01:50 - amazing VR course that will teach you
01:51 - how to work with VR
01:53 - and even make a game and then you will
01:55 - have made multiple finished games and
01:56 - have the opportunity to customize and
01:58 - show off your unique work to the class
02:00 - if you sign up now the first 50 people
02:02 - will get a free brackish shirt as well
02:04 - as a big discount and other bonuses on
02:06 - both courses
02:07 - simply click the link in the description
02:08 - and get started so the first day was all
02:10 - about getting the core gameplay in place
02:13 - by writing up a duck with a list of
02:14 - ideas for stuff I wanted in the game and
02:16 - sketched out a quick example level to
02:18 - help visualize them once I felt I had a
02:20 - good idea of where to start I jumped
02:22 - right into player movement which in this
02:24 - case was fairly simple
02:26 - I also made good use of the 2d platform
02:28 - component to allow players to jump on
02:30 - top of platforms from underneath of
02:32 - course the game needed to play
02:33 - characters so I created the second
02:35 - player using a variant prefab that
02:37 - override it controls and graphics and
02:39 - after just about an hour the players
02:42 - were moving around the screen next I
02:43 - created platforms that would register
02:45 - when a player collided with them and
02:47 - change color based on the player of
02:48 - course a really central part of the game
02:50 - is that players move through colliders
02:52 - of the opposite color to achieve this I
02:55 - used the addition matrix to choose
02:56 - certain layers that wouldn't collide
02:58 - with each other and assign these layers
03:00 - through script I then created an end
03:02 - goal that triggers a level change when
03:04 - both players are standing on the
03:05 - platform I also made the level restart
03:07 - when a player falls down and with that I
03:09 - actually kind of had a game it wasn't
03:12 - very pretty yet but the core mechanics
03:13 - were there I also realized that all of
03:15 - my levels would be sharing a lot of the
03:17 - same objects stuff like the main
03:19 - environment game managers and the camera
03:21 - should remain the same so I decided to
03:23 - make use of unities new ability to
03:25 - combine together multiple scenes and
03:27 - split the game into a base scene with
03:29 - all the stuff that wouldn't change and
03:30 - then a scene for each level containing
03:32 - all the level specific elements like
03:34 - platforms also created a quick script
03:37 - that would load and unload level scenes
03:38 - during the game and I was surprised to
03:40 - see that with very little effort the
03:42 - system worked really well and it made it
03:44 - so much easier when I later had to go in
03:46 - and update graphics at the end of the
03:48 - day I introduced a new gameplay element
03:50 - vertical lockers these forced the
03:52 - players to start thinking about how they
03:54 - can help each other pass through
03:55 - otherwise blocked off passages I
03:57 - followed that up with a bit of play
03:59 - testing courtesy of Andreas and Thea and
04:01 - that was pretty much it for day one now
04:03 - if we take some graphics add a bit of
04:05 - graphics and then order some more
04:07 - graphics on top of that that pretty much
04:09 - sums up day two I started by seeking out
04:11 - some nice reference images that fit the
04:12 - style I was going for I wanted something
04:14 - cozy like a tavern or restaurant I found
04:18 - this amazing artwork from the game
04:19 - monster sanctuary that I just fell in
04:21 - love with and perhaps copied a bit and
04:23 - actually I think this is an important
04:25 - point to make I'm not a very
04:27 - artist and if there's one thing I've
04:29 - learned it's that it's very important
04:31 - not to be afraid of covering bits and
04:32 - pieces of artwork you like especially
04:34 - when learning I found that it's a great
04:37 - way to improve my skills by trying out
04:38 - new techniques but still having a
04:40 - reference to help guide in the right
04:42 - direction of course I always encourage
04:44 - you to put a spin on it and think of
04:45 - ways to make your work stand out in this
04:47 - case for example I wanted to move away
04:49 - from the traditional fad pixel art style
04:50 - and decided to make everything react to
04:52 - lighting in unity I wrote up a quick
04:54 - sprite shader that allowed me to input a
04:56 - normal map and generated normal maps for
04:58 - the environment in Photoshop using this
05:00 - guide I found online I also created some
05:02 - sprites for the players I really wanted
05:04 - the character is to feel squishy and
05:06 - despite my terrible animation skills I
05:08 - feel like that fairly well now the
05:10 - graphics were continued on day three I
05:12 - created sprites for the different
05:14 - platforms and a small romantic dinner
05:16 - table
05:16 - I also took advantage of the dynamic
05:18 - lighting and added a candlelight that
05:20 - were flicker slightly to give a bit of
05:22 - life to the scene and then made the
05:23 - platforms glow when changing color which
05:26 - I think really helped tie everything
05:27 - together and make the levels more
05:29 - vibrant as the players progressed
05:30 - through them and talking about levels at
05:32 - this point it was time to start
05:33 - introducing new puzzle elements into the
05:36 - game I did this using a very simple
05:38 - three-part design philosophy one
05:40 - introduced mechanic to explore mechanic
05:43 - and three challenge a good example of
05:46 - this is the timed color changer this
05:48 - platform will alternate between the two
05:50 - colors on a fixed timer the first level
05:52 - to introduce this is super simple both
05:55 - players need to time that jumps to make
05:57 - it across at this point the players are
05:58 - familiar with how the mechanic works and
06:00 - the first step is complete next we
06:02 - explore in the mechanic here we see that
06:04 - multiple platforms can change color at
06:06 - the same time this level is harder and
06:09 - forces the players to start testing out
06:10 - their knowledge of the mechanic to solve
06:12 - it
06:13 - finally we challenge the players in this
06:15 - case it's done by offsetting the timer
06:17 - on the platforms so that the players
06:18 - have to be really accurate with their
06:20 - jumps the players also have to switch
06:22 - positions which makes it easier to get
06:24 - confused but no matter how good a design
06:26 - philosophy you might think you have you
06:28 - must never underestimate the importance
06:30 - of play testing whenever I asked the an
06:32 - andreas - hub how they always managed to
06:35 - figure out weird loopholes that I would
06:36 - have never discovered on my own finally
06:39 - I created some more site
06:40 - variations for the platforms and that
06:42 - was pretty much the end of day three day
06:44 - four it was the final day I had to work
06:46 - on the project because of this I jump
06:48 - straight into level design added buttons
06:50 - that would change the color of platforms
06:52 - while standing on them and using the
06:54 - same design philosophy I created three
06:55 - levels based on this concept at this
06:57 - point the game needed quite a bit of
06:59 - Polish so I created a Start screen that
07:01 - would introduce the characters and goal
07:03 - of the game as well as a quick victory
07:04 - screen to reward players who complete
07:06 - all the levels also created an animation
07:08 - for finishing a level added a quick
07:10 - splash screen and with that the game was
07:13 - complete we threw together a very quick
07:16 - celebration and I submitted the game to
07:18 - the gem and I must say I'm really glad
07:20 - with how this one turned out especially
07:22 - because there are so many ways you can
07:23 - expand on the game by just adding more
07:25 - interesting levels if you want to play
07:27 - the game well of course have a link for
07:28 - that in the description and while you're
07:30 - at it make sure to check out and review
