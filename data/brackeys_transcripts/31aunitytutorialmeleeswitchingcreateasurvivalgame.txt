00:00 - [Music]
00:03 - hello everyone and welcome to video
00:05 - number 31 in a survival game series it's
00:10 - been a long time since the last one I've
00:12 - been busy with many things especially
00:14 - the new inventory system which you can
00:19 - get on the unity asset store for free
00:22 - links in the description and maybe even
00:25 - an annotation let's see how lazy I am
00:28 - and really check it out it's super cool
00:32 - and we're also going to be using it just
00:34 - a bit in this video so that's awesome
00:39 - okay so let's go ahead and dive into
00:42 - today's subject we are basically going
00:44 - to continue with weapon switching and we
00:47 - are going to make the weapon switching
00:50 - work with the inventory system so unless
00:54 - you download the inventory system and
00:56 - set it up using the inventory basics
00:59 - tutorial then you won't be able to
01:01 - follow along with the two first steps
01:04 - here so that's really all at least the
01:06 - second step so that's really necessary
01:09 - that you go ahead and watch that one
01:12 - okay cool so we're going to expand on
01:15 - that and then we are going to make the
01:17 - new weapon script which will make our
01:20 - character punch enemies and hit them as
01:24 - with swords and do all kinds of crazy
01:27 - stuff and also damage them awesome so
01:31 - let's get to it first off we will remove
01:34 - the old melee system and just have a
01:36 - look at what how we have it set up at
01:38 - the moment so so far we have been using
01:41 - the weapon switching to to switch
01:44 - between weapons and if we go under the
01:47 - player you can see now that we have in
01:51 - D&D inventory basics video we set this
01:55 - up so we have an inventory object here
01:58 - and we have all of the different stuff
02:00 - and if we hit play
02:02 - and go ahead and hit I it will bring up
02:07 - the inventory windows the character in
02:09 - the inventory window so that's what we
02:12 - have been
02:13 - doing so far so that's basically it and
02:17 - if we go into the main camera we can see
02:21 - that our old melee object is still here
02:24 - and remember in the old days we had the
02:27 - Emil easy switching script sitting here
02:30 - we're still going to have that but we're
02:33 - going to have another one which is
02:35 - included in the inventory pack and then
02:38 - on each weapon we have a script called
02:40 - melee system which would then damage the
02:43 - opponent this is it this is the script
02:47 - we're going to be creating just in a new
02:49 - version more advanced version we are
02:51 - just going to call it weapon so that's
02:54 - really cool so we can just go ahead and
02:56 - delete that now we know how it was set
02:58 - up before and under the arms the arm
03:01 - armature master inner arm right arm
03:04 - right hand right and then hold right
03:06 - melee Wow
03:09 - this is where our new weapon switching
03:11 - script is going to be and under that we
03:14 - can see that I have a empty game object
03:16 - with a position of 0 0 0 and the
03:19 - rotation should also be triple zero
03:23 - which is disabled we can go ahead and
03:25 - enable that and it's important that this
03:27 - is called fists within a capital F sore
03:31 - go ahead and call it that and make sure
03:34 - that that's the only game object
03:36 - parented to the meaty cool so now that
03:40 - we have all that in place we can go
03:43 - ahead and drag the weapon switching to
03:44 - under our scripts folder to get rid of
03:47 - that so like that whoops my computer is
03:51 - having some issues with dragging so
03:54 - let's just leave it but you can go ahead
03:56 - and drag it under the scripts folder
03:58 - I'll take care of that later now under
04:01 - the inventory folder here on this is the
04:04 - one you get when you install the
04:05 - inventory system we can go under scripts
04:10 - other and then we can see the weapon
04:14 - switch script this is what we are going
04:17 - to drag onto the fists object whoops not
04:20 - the fists object the melee object there
04:24 - and you can see once we apply that we
04:26 - have
04:27 - some different variables that we have to
04:29 - fill out and basically what the script
04:33 - is going to do it's going to check how
04:38 - many items we have equipped so if I run
04:40 - the game here you can see it's already
04:42 - working somewhat up in the left hand
04:44 - corner and this is right now interacting
04:47 - with our time of day slider but we can
04:49 - go ahead and move that in a second but
04:51 - you can see that it shows us the weapons
04:54 - we have equipped right now it's just a
04:55 - fist and that's because we don't have
04:58 - any weapons equipped so the default is
05:00 - two fists and it will make sure that if
05:03 - we have no weapons equipped it will
05:06 - spawn a fists object if we have one it
05:08 - will be that weapon and a fist subject
05:11 - if we have two weapons it will be those
05:13 - two weapons and a fists object and if we
05:18 - have three the first object gets
05:20 - destroyed and so we just can we can just
05:22 - select the three weapons it's a pretty
05:25 - advanced way to do it but it feels very
05:27 - natural in game that you can select only
05:31 - your hands when you have an empty slot
05:33 - available so okay cool so we're not
05:37 - going to go into scripting and that's I
05:40 - just wanted to point out how it works
05:42 - and now let's set it up so the way we
05:45 - have it here it wants the fist object
05:48 - and that's not the one under the melee
05:50 - that's a prefab so let's go ahead and
05:53 - drag the empty fists woops annoying
05:57 - dragging we should be able to drag oh
06:02 - man I can get this to work maybe I'll
06:08 - just go ahead and pause wait I got to
06:11 - work that but need to pause a few times
06:14 - in the middle of the video but we've
06:16 - made a prefab out of the fists and now
06:20 - we can go ahead and drag that prefab
06:22 - under the transform and remember this is
06:24 - still just an empty game object so let's
06:28 - see if we select the melee here maybe we
06:31 - can select it from the project pane nope
06:33 - it has to be done the hard way there we
06:37 - go drag the fists under the maximum
06:40 - number of
06:40 - weapons you want this to be too as long
06:43 - as you it is three in the inventory and
06:47 - the first an object we want that to be
06:50 - true because our character starts out
06:51 - with fists the skin you can choose
06:57 - whatever you want here if we just hit
07:00 - play a skin will be selected for you
07:03 - included in the inventory so I'll just
07:06 - go ahead and leave that then we have the
07:08 - switch between animation which will
07:12 - include the possibility for our weapon
07:16 - switching script to make sure that our
07:18 - hands will switch between punching and
07:21 - swinging a weapon so this is really only
07:25 - for this setup we have here so we are
07:29 - going to check that and then we are
07:31 - going to drag in the animator so if we
07:33 - select our arms or actually let's just
07:37 - go ahead and select it here so click
07:39 - there and then select the arms here and
07:42 - I've seen that's the animated we're
07:44 - going to be using if we just double
07:46 - click this weapon switching scripts just
07:49 - to see how it works
07:50 - and soo-min on it a lot of you guys have
07:54 - been asking that i zoom in closer to the
07:57 - text so here we are that might be a too
08:00 - much there we go we can see that the
08:04 - animator what it does is that we check
08:08 - if it's a fist subject and if it is we
08:12 - will access the animator and say that
08:15 - weapon is not on so weapon is on equals
08:19 - false meaning that our whip our fists
08:22 - will be punching and in other cases the
08:27 - weapon is on will be true meaning that
08:29 - we will swing something so that handles
08:33 - all of the animation for us and of
08:35 - course you can go ahead and change up
08:37 - these different string values so if you
08:39 - have called it something else you can go
08:42 - in and use control F to find it and then
08:46 - change it awesome so moving on this is a
08:52 - lot of rambling but there's a lot of
08:54 - things I have
08:55 - to clear up now that we have that
08:58 - working we can go ahead and first of all
09:02 - test it and it seems to be working you
09:05 - can see we have open hands which means
09:08 - that our animators being exists and it
09:11 - knows that it's the fist we're using you
09:13 - can also see that we have enabled
09:15 - shadows again because in the new version
09:19 - of unity version of unity for 4.2 we can
09:25 - have hard shadows in unity 3 so that's
09:28 - really great so you can go ahead and
09:29 - enable that on the directional lights
09:32 - awesome so now that's that that's
09:35 - working let's go ahead and add the
09:38 - weapon script and I know that the fists
09:41 - here aren't really a weapon they're just
09:43 - hands but we will still wake make the
09:46 - weapon script for them also and the
09:50 - weapon script is going to be great
09:52 - because we're going to be able to use it
09:54 - on all kinds of different weapons and we
09:57 - don't have to change anything inside the
10:00 - script we can just play around with the
10:02 - variables to tweak the weapon to be how
10:05 - we want it so that's awesome let's go to
10:08 - fists then add component new script then
10:12 - the reason why I'm only using the fists
10:14 - is because I haven't made a video on how
10:17 - to make items that works with our
10:20 - inventory system yet so once that come
10:23 - once that comes out we can test it with
10:26 - other weapons and switch between them
10:27 - and you will see how cool it looks so
10:30 - let's just hit add component and let's
10:34 - name this weapon the language is going
10:38 - to be JavaScript create an ad and double
10:42 - click this this is the scripting part
10:45 - and it's going to get long and it's
10:47 - probably also going to get a bit boring
10:49 - for most and it's definitely enough for
10:52 - beginners so now that we have that
10:54 - warning out there let's go ahead and
10:57 - adventure out on it and let's just
10:59 - delete those two points because it makes
11:02 - me feel happy so great now let's make
11:06 - the new weapon
11:08 - and yes this is definitely going to be
11:11 - split up into several parts at least to
11:14 - Cole so first off we have the function
11:19 - start we can just go ahead and delete
11:20 - that and let's declare some variables
11:23 - the first one is going to be the damage
11:26 - you know that one and yes I am aware
11:28 - that I spelled the damage wrong but
11:30 - that's because I did it way back and
11:34 - then I just stuck to it because it
11:37 - doesn't really matter so the damage is
11:40 - self-explanatory then we are going to
11:42 - have the distance or just distance which
11:46 - is going to be a type float then the max
11:50 - distance which this which is also going
11:54 - to be a type float but it's going to be
11:56 - equal 1.5 by default and this is going
12:02 - to be the range within our web where our
12:05 - weapon will be able to hit then we have
12:09 - the animator of type animator and this
12:16 - will allow us to access our animator or
12:20 - our controller to to do stuff like
12:26 - playing the hit animation and then
12:30 - another variable called damage delay of
12:35 - type float equals 0.6 and this is the
12:41 - time from we hit the button to where we
12:45 - want the damage to influence the enemy
12:50 - and this is great because swing
12:52 - animations usually take some times some
12:55 - time before the weapon actually hits the
12:58 - enemy and so we can use this to delay it
13:01 - before we use the event options we had
13:05 - with the built-in animation system in
13:08 - unity but now that we have imported a
13:10 - model with all of the animations built
13:13 - into that we can't really use that it's
13:16 - a kind of a fault
13:19 - of Meccan 'm if you
13:21 - asked me but we'll live with it we'll
13:24 - just make the damage delay then we're
13:27 - going to be two new lines and here we're
13:30 - going to do hit zero one streak and
13:34 - that's going to be equal to zero and
13:37 - then we have the hit zero two streak
13:40 - which is also going to be zero and these
13:45 - two variables are going to be used to
13:48 - making sure that whenever we randomize
13:52 - what hand is going to be hitting I'm
13:55 - sorry know what kind of attack we are
13:57 - going to be using so that I won't play
14:00 - the same attack animation all the time
14:02 - so whenever we randomize that we usually
14:06 - get the same animation playing three or
14:09 - four times in a row sometimes because we
14:12 - only have two and what we're going to do
14:15 - here is we're going to control that they
14:17 - jut don't go out in a streak but only
14:20 - play a maximum of like two times so it's
14:25 - still going to feel random but it's not
14:27 - going to be completely random but we'll
14:29 - get into that awesome now in the
14:33 - function update we can write if input
14:36 - that get button-down fire 1 close
14:46 - parenthesis
14:46 - [Music]
14:51 - open new brackets and then we are going
14:53 - to do attack damage and this is a
14:56 - function we are going to be making right
14:58 - now this is just to make it easier for
15:01 - us so stay more organized and also
15:05 - because we're going to be using yield
15:07 - statements which you can't do inside of
15:09 - the update function so the function
15:11 - attack damage and open and close some
15:18 - brackets whoops there we go
15:22 - cool now the first thing we are going to
15:25 - be doing is let's say not doing any of
15:29 - the animation let's just begin with the
15:33 - basics of damaging and waiting and all
15:37 - that stuff yeah let's do that
15:39 - so now type a yield wait for seconds and
15:46 - yield wait for seconds is great for just
15:49 - delaying something and then using the
15:52 - damage delay you can also just type too
15:57 - and it would wait for two seconds it's
15:59 - that easy then we're going to be doing
16:02 - the actual attacking and here we are
16:07 - going to be using a ray cast actually
16:13 - let me just go ahead and explain what we
16:16 - could do instead but what we're not
16:18 - going to do because it's it's harder and
16:21 - more complicated and it's also usually
16:25 - more prone to errors let me show you
16:27 - here if I can so actually that's if I
16:32 - can use brushes yeah I can cool
16:36 - so basically many places in many games
16:42 - you you have this kind of combat where
16:47 - you have the the cylinder which is our
16:51 - let's say our players so this is our
16:54 - player and he holds the sword so this is
16:58 - his hand and in his hand we have a sword
17:01 - on that sword
17:03 - we then attack
17:04 - Collider so we then have a maybe a box
17:08 - Collider here and a nother box Collider
17:12 - here we then put scripts on to that
17:16 - checking if if we hit something so
17:24 - that's just basically a trigger object
17:28 - and I excuse my handwriting I really do
17:34 - but I'm using a mouse to do this
17:36 - so that's trigger object and they are
17:38 - going to look for our opponent capsule
17:41 - and this way we can use the built-in
17:44 - system physics system in unity to make
17:48 - combat but this really requires some
17:50 - great animation work and it relies a bit
17:54 - too much on the building physics system
17:57 - I think it's normally better you just to
18:00 - send out the array even though it feels
18:03 - more natural and then check the distance
18:06 - and whether or not it's hitting so
18:09 - that's what we're going to be doing with
18:11 - the raycast great so var hit rate of
18:17 - type ray cast hit then the VAR r ay
18:22 - equals camera dot main dot screen points
18:27 - array vector 3 and basically we are just
18:36 - telling it to send out a ray from the
18:39 - middle of our screen so screen dot width
18:42 - divided by 2 which makes the center of
18:45 - the width then screen that height and
18:51 - you guessed it divided by 2 so we have
18:54 - the center now and then 0 because we
18:58 - have surrounded Z and close it up empty
19:01 - parentheses so now we're sending out the
19:03 - Ray then we are going to check if the
19:05 - sixth ray cast so if we hit something
19:12 - the raycast ray come ahead then we want
19:23 - the hit that transform that sent message
19:26 - we want to send a message called apply
19:30 - damage remember to get the right amounts
19:32 - of MS in there with the damage we want
19:38 - to send that along with it and we want
19:41 - to not require a receiver or we are
19:45 - going to get a lot of errors whenever we
19:47 - hit something that's not an enemy so
19:50 - basically we are sending out the Ray we
19:52 - are gathering any information and what
19:56 - we want to do is we want to create an if
19:59 - statement now that will check the
20:01 - distance to our whatever we hit so
20:04 - distance equals hit that distance and if
20:11 - distance is less than max distance then
20:19 - we want to send to damage the enemy here
20:23 - so create some brackets around that
20:28 - there we go awesome so right below that
20:34 - if statements we are going to actually
20:38 - that has to do with the animation we'll
20:41 - just type it in so now let me explain
20:44 - how we can access the Meccan m animation
20:48 - and make changes to it it's done by of
20:51 - course using our reference variable up
20:53 - here so this way we have the controller
20:57 - and then we can change things inside of
21:00 - the controller by using the animator dot
21:03 - and now we can access the D mecanim
21:07 - controller then we want to do set bull
21:10 - for set boolean which means that we can
21:14 - make something true or false and then
21:17 - inside some parentheses we are going to
21:19 - type hit one
21:22 - this is the name of the parameter we are
21:24 - going to to tweak and then comma then
21:28 - what you want to declare this and we
21:30 - want to make it false like that and we
21:33 - are going to make another one called the
21:36 - animator set ball hit two is going to be
21:42 - false also and we can go ahead and save
21:49 - that up and that was 22 minutes so I'm
21:52 - going to go ahead and cut the video off
21:55 - here and then make another pot so look
21:58 - forward to that and thank you for
22:00 - watching I'll see you in the next video
22:06 - [Music]
