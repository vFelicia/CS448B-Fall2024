00:00 - all right I admit it I might have gone a
00:01 - bit menu crazy lately
00:03 - so far we've created both a main menu
00:05 - and a settings menu so let's finish up
00:07 - by creating a pass menu as well when
00:09 - we're done it should look something like
00:11 - this also special thanks to Judy Minh
00:13 - our Minoru C and infinity PPR for their
00:16 - support on patreon you guys are awesome
00:18 - so let's get started series the game
00:20 - that we want to create a pause menu on
00:22 - top of I created this game for a Ludum
00:24 - dare ray and also made a video on it
00:26 - which you can check out in the top right
00:27 - corner
00:28 - so first let's begin by creating a
00:29 - canvas we'll go to the hierarchy right
00:31 - click go UI and select canvas let's make
00:34 - sure it's set to screen space overlay
00:36 - and let's select pixel perfect now if we
00:39 - go to the scene view we should be able
00:41 - to switch into 2d mode hit F to focus on
00:44 - our canvas and now here we can place our
00:45 - UI elements let's right-click on a
00:47 - canvas go UI and create a panel we want
00:50 - this to fill the entire screen so that's
00:51 - perfect but instead of making it white
00:53 - let's make it a transparent black if we
00:56 - switch into the game view we can see
00:57 - that this can act as a nice space for
00:59 - the rest of our UI
01:00 - we'll also change the source image from
01:02 - background to none and this will get rid
01:05 - of the edges around our game view now we
01:07 - can rename this panel to pause menu and
01:10 - we'll put all of our UI inside of this
01:12 - object so let's add some buttons to our
01:14 - post menu we'll right-click go UI select
01:17 - button let's switch back into the same
01:19 - you let's scale this while holding down
01:21 - alt to scale it from the center now I
01:23 - want to go ahead and disable our image
01:25 - here and instead focus on the text to do
01:28 - that we'll go under the button and
01:29 - select our text object let's bump up the
01:31 - font size quite a bit we also change the
01:34 - text to something like resue and also
01:36 - make the text completely white now if we
01:39 - have a look in our game you that already
01:40 - looks better but I also want to change
01:42 - the font style to bold whenever you're
01:44 - working with text on the UI I recommend
01:46 - picking up text mesh Pro it's a free
01:48 - asset on the unity asset story and it
01:50 - was recently acquired by unity it makes
01:52 - everything to do with text much much
01:54 - nicer we're gonna skip over it in this
01:56 - video but if you want to learn more
01:57 - about tech smash broz I have a separate
01:59 - video on the topic and also use it in
02:01 - the tutorial on creating a main menu
02:02 - however one thing that we can do with
02:04 - the default text is add a hard shadow to
02:07 - do that we'll hit add component will
02:09 - search for shadow we can keep the
02:11 - transparent black here but we do
02:13 - change the effect distance to something
02:14 - like four by minus four that definitely
02:17 - makes our text more visible we then
02:19 - select our button switch into the scene
02:21 - view and move it up a bit and let's now
02:23 - rename this to resume button if we go
02:26 - into the game view and hit play will of
02:28 - course see that our game plays in the
02:30 - background but we should now be able to
02:32 - click on a resume button however nothing
02:34 - seems to happen and we don't really get
02:36 - any visual feedback that anything is
02:38 - going on that's because we disabled our
02:40 - image component and by default unity
02:42 - shows what happens to a button under the
02:44 - transition but simply tending the color
02:46 - of our image so let's rename our image
02:49 - it's change the color to completely
02:51 - black and then under the normal color
02:53 - we'll set the Alpha to zero so by
02:55 - default we won't be able to see this
02:56 - however if we then highlight our button
02:58 - so if we hover over it will bump up the
03:00 - Alpha a bit and if we then press the
03:02 - button will pump up the Alpha even more
03:04 - so now if we hit play we should be able
03:06 - to hover over a button and it will
03:08 - visibly show that we're doing so and
03:10 - when we press it we can see that it
03:11 - turns even darker you'll also see that
03:13 - if we stop hovering over our button it's
03:15 - still selected that's because we need to
03:17 - change the navigation to none and that
03:20 - should fix it
03:21 - I want to duplicate our resume button
03:22 - move it down and this one is going to be
03:25 - our menu button so that's change the
03:26 - text to menu I also want to make it
03:28 - smaller so that's bump down the font
03:30 - size and let's then resize our button to
03:32 - fit it we can now take this button
03:34 - duplicate it move it down and this will
03:36 - be our quit button so let's again change
03:38 - the text to quit and I think that
03:41 - actually looks pretty nice let's rename
03:43 - our second button to menu button and our
03:46 - third button to quit button and when we
03:49 - now play the game we can select the
03:50 - different buttons now that we're
03:52 - satisfied with the UI of our menu it's
03:54 - time to add a script to control it to do
03:56 - that let's start by disabling our pass
03:58 - menu let's then go to our canvas and
04:00 - let's hit a component he will create a
04:02 - script called pause menu that's going to
04:05 - new script it's like c-sharp and hit
04:07 - create an ad and let's open it up in
04:08 - visual studio in here we want to delete
04:10 - our start method and instead let's
04:12 - create a variable that will keep track
04:14 - of whether or not our game is currently
04:16 - paused we'll make this a public static
04:19 - variable public because we wanted to be
04:21 - accessible from other scripts and Static
04:24 - because we don't want to reference this
04:26 - cific pass manuscript we just want to be
04:28 - able to very easily check from other
04:30 - scripts whether or not the game is
04:32 - currently passed so we'll write full
04:34 - here because the value can be either
04:36 - true or false let's name it something
04:38 - like game is passed by default this will
04:41 - be false then inside of our update
04:43 - method we can check whether or not we
04:45 - want to pass the game and you can of
04:46 - course use any key that you would like
04:48 - for this I'm just gonna use the Escape
04:50 - key so we'll write if input that get key
04:53 - down and again the key that we want to
04:56 - check for is Kiko dot escape if the game
05:00 - is currently passed so if game is passed
05:03 - is equal to true well then we've pressed
05:05 - escaped by the game was already passed
05:07 - and so we want to now resume it and if
05:09 - not well then we've pressed the Escape
05:11 - key while the game was not passed and so
05:14 - we want to go ahead and pass it now of
05:16 - course we need to create these two
05:18 - methods so we'll create a void resume as
05:21 - well as a void pause and what do we want
05:25 - to happen here well when we are pausing
05:28 - the game we want to bring up our parts
05:29 - menu we want to freeze time in our game
05:32 - and we want to change our game is past
05:34 - variable to true when we then resume it
05:36 - we want to do all those things but
05:38 - opposite so bring down our past menu set
05:41 - time back to normal and set game is past
05:44 - to false so let's do that first to
05:46 - control our UI and we need a reference
05:48 - to it so we'll create a public game
05:50 - object and we'll call it our past menu
05:53 - UI then when we pass the game we'll go
05:55 - pause menu UI dot said active and here
05:59 - we can enable and disable our game
06:01 - object we want to enable it so we'll set
06:03 - it to true we then want to freeze time
06:06 - we'll do that by writing time dot
06:08 - timescale and this is the speed at which
06:10 - time is passing you can use this to
06:13 - create slow motion effects or quite
06:15 - simply just set it to zero in order to
06:17 - completely freeze the game and finally
06:19 - we want to set game is passed to true
06:22 - and again we want to do the exact same
06:24 - thing but opposite when we resume it so
06:26 - pause menu UI dot said active and this
06:29 - time we want to disable it so we'll
06:31 - write false we want to set time dot
06:33 - timescale back to normal which is one so
06:36 - that speed passes at a normal rate and
06:38 - we'll set game is
06:39 - equal to force and now we should see
06:42 - that if we save this and head into unity
06:44 - we now have an empty slot for our past
06:46 - menu UI and here we'll drag in our past
06:49 - menu UI that we just created now when we
06:52 - play our game works as normal right
06:54 - until we press escape the game freezes
06:57 - our UI is brought up you can still hear
06:59 - the music playing in the background and
07:01 - we can now press on a different buttons
07:03 - of course they currently don't do
07:05 - anything but we'll fix that in a second
07:07 - if we then press escape our game returns
07:10 - to normal so we can now effectively pass
07:12 - our game and remember we can always use
07:14 - game is paused to find out whether or
07:16 - not our game is currently paused say we
07:18 - wanted to do this inside of my Audio
07:20 - Manager in here could actually go ahead
07:22 - and pitch down sounds that plays when
07:25 - the game is paused to do that I would
07:27 - simply write if then we access the pause
07:29 - menu dot and here we have it game is
07:32 - passed and I can now use this to
07:33 - decrease the pitch of my audio source
07:35 - just to give you an example of why this
07:37 - is useful but for now the main thing
07:39 - that we want to worry about is
07:41 - connecting of these buttons to do that
07:43 - we want to create a function for each
07:45 - one the resume button is easy we simply
07:48 - wanted to resume the game and we do that
07:50 - right here so we actually already have a
07:52 - function for that all we need to do is
07:53 - go in and mark it as public and we can
07:56 - now trigger it from our button we also
07:58 - need to create two more functions of
07:59 - course they'll still be public the first
08:02 - one will be called load menu and the
08:05 - second one quit game and we'll write
08:09 - this out in a second but for now let's
08:10 - just display something in the console
08:12 - debug that log loading menu and here
08:17 - debug deadlock quitting game let's save
08:22 - this going to unity and let's try and
08:24 - select one of our buttons this is the
08:26 - recent button if we go ahead and scroll
08:28 - down we can see that we have an on click
08:30 - event under our button we'll add an
08:32 - action to this so whenever this button
08:34 - is clicked this action will be executed
08:37 - our action sits on the canvas so we'll
08:39 - drag in our canvas it's under the pause
08:42 - menu script and it's called resume and
08:44 - we can do the same thing for a menu and
08:46 - quit button let's select our menu button
08:48 - add an on click event
08:49 - let's drag in our canvas go into past
08:51 - menu and that's
08:52 - like load menu and finally let's hook up
08:55 - a quit button add a new event drag in
08:57 - our canvas go a new path menu and select
09:00 - quit game and if we now wait to hit play
09:02 - pass the game select menu it's gonna say
09:05 - loading menu so that quit it's going to
09:07 - say quitting game and if we hit resume
09:10 - well our game resumes awesome so now we
09:13 - can make these two functions actually do
09:15 - something in order to load our menu
09:17 - we'll just need to go to the top here
09:18 - and use unity engine dot scene
09:23 - management and now we can access our
09:25 - scene manager in order to load a new
09:28 - scene and the scene that we want to load
09:30 - is the menu of course encourage you not
09:33 - to hard code it in like this and create
09:34 - a variable for it but I'm sure you can
09:36 - figure that out on your own then in
09:38 - terms of quitting the game we'll simply
09:39 - go application dot quit and whenever we
09:43 - call this nothing will happen inside the
09:44 - editor so let's just leave our debug
09:46 - that lock in here to let ourselves know
09:48 - what is going on if we now save this
09:50 - script go into unity we need to make
09:52 - sure that we have a scene called menu
09:54 - which we do and we also need to go to
09:56 - file build settings and make sure that
09:58 - we've added it to the scenes in build
10:00 - now if I play this hit escape and select
10:03 - menu you can see that it loads up by
10:05 - main menu but the game is still paused
10:07 - of course we don't want this so inside
10:10 - of our script we need to also adjust
10:12 - time to time scale back to the normal
10:15 - one now we can save this again and when
10:18 - we now try and go to the menu we can see
10:21 - that working as normal and we can
10:23 - actually drive around the menu yay
10:25 - finally you might want to add a bit of
10:27 - animation when you pass the game to do
10:29 - that we'll go under animation we'll
10:31 - create a new animation I'm gonna put it
10:33 - inside of my animation folder and here
10:35 - I'm gonna call it pause menu and all
10:37 - that I'm gonna do here is hit record go
10:40 - forward a little bit and simply go into
10:41 - color and change the Alpha to zero now
10:44 - you can see that as I scrub through time
10:46 - our alpha decreases of course we want to
10:48 - reverse this so I'll simply take the
10:50 - keyframes and switch them and now when
10:52 - we play we can see our background fades
10:53 - in it also currently loops to change
10:55 - this we'll go and find the animation
10:57 - mine was named pause menu and here we'll
11:00 - make sure to disable loop time and the
11:02 - last thing that we want to do is select
11:03 - our path menu and under the Adam
11:05 - we want to change our update mode from
11:07 - normal to unskilled time otherwise our
11:10 - animators will also be frozen by the
11:12 - fact that we change our time scale to
11:13 - zero when we select unskilled time our
11:16 - animator will just completely ignore our
11:18 - current time scale so that's why we do
11:19 - that for UI stuff we can then disable
11:22 - our paths menu maximize our game and our
11:24 - path menu should now be complete if I
11:26 - hit escape our game passes with a nice
11:28 - smooth transition from here I can quit
11:30 - the game which will of course work if
11:32 - you build it I can resume it and I can
11:34 - switch to the main menu awesome that's
11:37 - pretty much it for this video we're
11:38 - going to be taking a short break for
11:40 - Christmas Eve but we'll be back in
11:42 - exactly one week with a video on how I
11:44 - started making games it's a video that
11:46 - I'm really excited about so hope you
11:48 - guys will enjoy it on that thanks for
11:49 - watching and I will see you in the next
