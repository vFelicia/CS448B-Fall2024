00:00 - thanks for tuning in at
00:03 - braies hello everyone and welcome to
00:06 - fading between scenes in unity today
00:08 - we're going to be taking a look at
00:10 - making a script that will allow us to
00:13 - fade out change level and then fade back
00:15 - in with just a couple of lines of code
00:18 - that we can place anywhere in our game
00:21 - so first off I'm going to select uh an
00:23 - object this could be any object I'm just
00:25 - going to use the GM object and then I'm
00:27 - going to create a new script here let's
00:30 - call this fading it's going to be of
00:32 - type
00:34 - c so double click it to open it up in
00:36 - mono develop and let's start out by
00:39 - adding some variables I excuse the
00:41 - quality of the recording it's not as
00:43 - good as it as it normally is uh but
00:45 - we're going to change that uh in the
00:47 - next video don't worry so the first
00:49 - variable is a texture 2D we're going to
00:51 - call it Fade Out texture and this is
00:53 - just the image that will overlay the
00:55 - screen in our case it's just going to be
00:58 - black the next variable is a public
01:00 - float with the fade speed this is of
01:04 - course the speed we will fade in and out
01:08 - at then we're going to make a private
01:11 - integer called Draw depth and we're
01:14 - going to set this to minus a th000 this
01:17 - is the textures um draw order in the
01:20 - hierarchy meaning that it will be drawn
01:23 - last and therefore it will render on top
01:26 - so we're just making sure that the black
01:28 - image we are going to fade in and out is
01:30 - going to be on top of everything else
01:33 - then we make a private float with the
01:34 - alpha and we just set this uh as with a
01:37 - default to one so it's going to start
01:40 - out by being completely
01:42 - visible then we make a private in called
01:46 - fade Direction and we equal uh or we
01:49 - default this to minus
01:51 - one this is the direction to fade if
01:55 - it's equal to minus one it will fade in
01:58 - and if it's equal to 1 it will fade
02:02 - out let's just go ahead and uh delete
02:05 - the two functions here and make a new
02:07 - one called on GUI and this is going to
02:11 - be uh good for rendering different kinds
02:13 - of Graphics um so this is unity's
02:16 - function for rendering
02:19 - guy and uh then first we're going to
02:22 - fade in and out the alpha value using a
02:25 - direction a speed and time. Delta time
02:28 - which will convert the operation to
02:30 - seconds so we do this by setting saying
02:34 - Alpha plus equals fate Direction time
02:38 - fade speed times time. Delta
02:43 - time next
02:44 - up we force uh or what is called clamp
02:49 - the uh value to be between zero and one
02:53 - this is because that the guy. color uses
02:57 - a alpha value between zero and
03:01 - 1 so
03:05 - Alpha
03:07 - equals math. clamp one because that will
03:12 - clamp it between zero and one and then
03:14 - we input the
03:16 - alpha next up let's set the color of a
03:19 - DUI in this case our texture or the
03:22 - black image and uh we really want the
03:25 - color values to just stay the same the
03:28 - only value we want to change just the
03:30 - alpha and this is included in the dui.
03:40 - color so do dui. color equals new
03:47 - color and inside of this we're going to
03:49 - pass it the GUI color. R for red gu
03:53 - color G uhg for green andb for blue and
03:58 - then we're going to type in the the
03:59 - alpha at
04:04 - last so here we are setting the
04:07 - alpha next up we're going to dui. depth
04:11 - and we're going to equal this to our
04:13 - draw
04:18 - depth so here we are making sure that
04:21 - the black texture will render on
04:28 - top then we're saying GUI draw. draw
04:32 - texture and inside of this we are going
04:34 - to type new rect which is four values
04:40 - and inside of this rectangle we going to
04:42 - do 0 comma 0 screen do width comma
04:47 - screen do height so that means it will
04:50 - fill the whole screen it will take the 0
04:52 - comma 0 point which is the top left
04:55 - corner and it will extend to the width
04:57 - and the height using the fade out
04:59 - texture meaning that we will overlay the
05:02 - Fade Out texture on the entire
05:08 - screen so now we've actually written all
05:11 - the logic we need in order for the image
05:14 - to fade smoothly in and out now we just
05:17 - need some functions that will set the
05:19 - direction to fade in and we're going to
05:22 - make these available from other scripts
05:25 - also so here we're going to set the fade
05:28 - direction to the the direction parameter
05:31 - making the scene fade in if it's minus
05:34 - one and out if it's one so do public
05:37 - float begin Fade with the parameter
05:41 - direction of type int the reason why
05:44 - it's called a public float and not a
05:46 - public V is because we wanted to return
05:50 - something the thing we wanted to return
05:53 - the thing I've just written is the fade
05:56 - speed this will allow us in another
05:58 - script to to have a variable variable be
06:01 - equal to the Fate speed and therefore we
06:05 - can easily uh calculate the time that it
06:08 - will takes to take to fade out and
06:10 - therefore time the application. load
06:12 - level so we don't load a new level
06:15 - before it's faded out or way too long
06:17 - after all you need to know that that is
06:20 - that it returns this value whenever the
06:22 - function is called and we're going to
06:24 - see an example of how we can use this in
06:26 - a
06:27 - sec next up we're going to do an onlevel
06:30 - was loaded function in order to uh call
06:34 - the begin fade whenever a level loads so
06:38 - this way we're just going to automate
06:40 - The Fading whenever uh a level is loaded
06:43 - and therefore we're going to fade in
06:45 - every time we uh play a new
06:48 - scene and of course we're going to call
06:50 - the function with the faded direction of
06:53 - minus one meaning that we will fade
06:56 - in you could also set the alpha to one
07:00 - right before should your Alpha not be
07:03 - equal to one by default or if you uh
07:06 - change it in other ways that's may be a
07:09 - good idea um depending on your game so
07:12 - if it's behaving really try that out now
07:15 - we can save the script and we're
07:17 - actually ready to head over to
07:21 - Unity so if we select the GM object you
07:24 - can see that we have two new variables
07:27 - the first one the Fade Out texture we're
07:30 - simply going to set to a black
07:32 - image this image you can find on the
07:35 - internet or you can create for yourself
07:38 - it's really simple and you can see here
07:40 - the import settings for my image it's
07:43 - just a 2X two texture meaning that it's
07:46 - only two pixels wide the fade speed I'm
07:50 - just going to leave at
07:52 - 0.8 and then now let's take a look at
07:54 - the SEL the SEL in my game is a pickup
07:58 - that will change scenes whenever the
07:59 - player collides with it so let's open up
08:02 - the script for
08:04 - this in here there's a bunch of logic
08:07 - all we need to worry about is the
08:09 - function called change level and inside
08:12 - of this function there's only three
08:14 - lines of code that handles the fading
08:16 - out and the level
08:18 - changing so this Fades out the game and
08:21 - loads a new level let's have a look at
08:23 - the first
08:25 - line this statement uses game object.
08:28 - find to find the object that the script
08:30 - is sitting on it just finds the object
08:33 - with called underscore GM if your object
08:36 - is called something else of course
08:38 - change this to your object's name it's
08:41 - generally a bad idea to use Game object.
08:44 - find a lot because it's taxing on the
08:46 - computer so if you need to do this a
08:48 - whole bunch I recommend you do it at
08:50 - this in the start of the
08:52 - game also we then use get component to
08:56 - find the fading script on that game
08:58 - object we're going to change the fade to
09:00 - fading in just a sec that was just a
09:03 - mistake then we dot begin Fade to call
09:07 - the function we can do this because
09:09 - we've made the function public and
09:12 - therefore it's accessible from the
09:14 - script then we pass it the parameter one
09:17 - because we want it to fade out we also
09:20 - create a new variable a float variable
09:23 - that stores the fade time which was
09:25 - called fade speed in the other script we
09:28 - can use this to time when uh the um when
09:33 - the application will actually load a new
09:36 - level so we can use this uh simply to
09:40 - time the yield statement that you see
09:42 - here so this is a yield statement and it
09:45 - will wait for amount uh a certain amount
09:48 - of seconds and here we wait for fade
09:50 - time keep in mind that whenever you're
09:53 - using a yield statement you can't do it
09:55 - inside of the update function and you
09:57 - need to create a separate function to
09:59 - store it
10:01 - in next up we have the application. load
10:04 - level this just loads the new level this
10:08 - is where you pass it an index of your
10:10 - level which we're going to take a look
10:12 - in a sec when we're going to add our
10:14 - level to the build
10:17 - settings so that was all we needed to do
10:19 - now let's change Fade to fading to
10:22 - correct the mistake and let's H back
10:24 - into
10:25 - Unity now this is important go to file
10:29 - build
10:30 - settings and here you can see all of the
10:32 - scenes that will be included in your
10:35 - build whenever changing scenes through
10:37 - code they need to be in the build
10:39 - settings so you can see we have the
10:42 - fading main level one and two and over
10:45 - here on the right is the index if your
10:48 - scene is not on the list hit add current
10:51 - and it will add the selected scene so
10:54 - that was basically all for now if you're
10:56 - interested in more tutorials like this
