00:00 - thanks for tuning in at
00:02 - braies hello everyone and welcome to
00:04 - this video in the how to make a 2d
00:06 - platformer course today we're going to
00:08 - be making or at least beginning to make
00:11 - an upgrade menu for our game so we can
00:13 - upgrade different stats on our player
00:15 - and maybe even on our weapon too so
00:18 - that's going to be a lot of fun of
00:20 - course whenever we want to upgrade
00:22 - something we're also going to introduce
00:24 - some kind of uh currency to the game and
00:27 - uh yeah I think it's going to be a lot
00:29 - of fun to do so let's just jump right
00:31 - into it so you can see I'm here in unity
00:35 - as I normally am and uh the first thing
00:38 - that we kind of want to do is sketch out
00:40 - how we want the update menu to look uh
00:43 - because if we have a look at our player
00:46 - you can see that we already have this
00:47 - idea of stats and currently we only have
00:50 - a Max Health in here uh we also have uh
00:53 - on our platformer 2D uh or character 2D
00:58 - we have our max speed which is something
01:01 - that we could definitely uh make
01:04 - upgradeable uh and uh then of course
01:06 - under our player arm then pistol we have
01:09 - this weapon that has stuff like fire
01:11 - rate and by the way I want to change
01:13 - this to something like 20 and this to
01:16 - let's say 30 and uh we have both a fire
01:20 - rate and a damage parameter that we
01:21 - could make upgradeable here we could
01:23 - also make it uh possible for our player
01:26 - to switch weapons and that completely
01:28 - depends on what you want to do
01:30 - and uh yeah that's kind of the base of
01:33 - what we have going on here we uh I think
01:35 - we should also Implement some kind of
01:37 - Health Region uh over time and uh maybe
01:40 - we could even make that upgradeable too
01:42 - we could also do something like how much
01:45 - money you gain from enemies making that
01:47 - upgradeable is also a lot of fun so
01:49 - there are lot uh lots of different
01:51 - opportunities for us um to uh to
01:55 - implement here so the first thing that I
01:57 - want to do is I want to expand the UI
01:59 - overlay game object and I want to create
02:02 - a new empty here which is going to uh
02:05 - host our update menu there we go and
02:10 - this is something I think we should be
02:11 - able to bring up from time to time by
02:14 - simply pressing a button we could also
02:16 - do it so every time we complete a wave
02:18 - it will take us to the upgrade menu but
02:20 - I like to kind of um make it more
02:23 - Dynamic so you don't have to go through
02:24 - the update screen every time instead you
02:26 - just hit let's say you to upgrade and uh
02:29 - it will pause the game while you're in
02:31 - there this way it also serves as a pause
02:33 - menu uh if PE people don't use Escape
02:36 - that's up to them good uh so we have the
02:40 - update menu here and uh under this I
02:42 - want to go ahead and create a UI image
02:46 - and uh this is just going to be a flat
02:48 - image that will serve as our upgrade
02:50 - menu background um so for some reason it
02:54 - isn't snapping oh that's because we need
02:56 - to take our update menu hold down alt
02:58 - and click in the button right uh corner
03:01 - here uh to Anchor that to the entire
03:03 - screen and now we can do the same with
03:06 - this image hold on old and click there
03:08 - there we go so now it fills up the
03:09 - entire screen and we can go ahead and
03:11 - make this some kind of light blue color
03:13 - I think that could be pretty cool
03:15 - something like that would be uh a fine
03:18 - base uh to work off so um we're going to
03:22 - rename this to BG and we can make this
03:24 - complet uh
03:26 - completely uh solid or we could make it
03:29 - some what opaque so it just kind of fits
03:32 - on top of the game uh but I am going to
03:35 - go ahead and make this actually maybe we
03:37 - should just darken the game um no I'm
03:40 - going to make this completely uh solid
03:44 - and then make the this uh blue color I
03:46 - kind of like that so that's what we're
03:49 - going with cool and uh then we also want
03:52 - to right click go under UI and I want to
03:55 - add just a simple Graphics element in
03:57 - here to make it look a bit more
04:00 - interesting so I want to go under uh
04:03 - Sprites and find our as astronaut Sprite
04:07 - atas and drag the astronaut idle in here
04:11 - and hit set native size and then I want
04:13 - to kind of expand him and drag him over
04:16 - and we also need to give him an arm so
04:18 - let's just duplicate him dragging the
04:21 - arm now hit set native size and again
04:23 - let's expand this a bit size that up so
04:28 - it looks proportionate with our
04:30 - character here uh something like that
04:33 - looks pretty good just to have something
04:35 - in here that isn't just text and buttons
04:38 - kind of to spice up uh the menu so this
04:41 - makes it feel like we're actually
04:42 - upgrading our character which is
04:44 - something nice uh to feel um we can also
04:47 - of course if you want to be able to
04:49 - switch weapons in here or upgrade your
04:50 - weapon you can have a weapon graphic
04:52 - here and uh show the updates visually on
04:56 - that weapon how it changes um if you
04:58 - want to go uh fully all in with this
05:01 - system uh that's not something we're
05:03 - going to add now uh maybe in the future
05:06 - so we're going to have an astronaut here
05:09 - and under him we're going to have his uh
05:11 - arm there good and again this has no uh
05:15 - purpose other than being pretty uh then
05:17 - under the update menu let's go on UI and
05:20 - hit
05:22 - text and uh let's change the text here
05:25 - to uh update or no no no no upgrade
05:30 - have I been saying update this entire
05:33 - time this is not the update menu this is
05:36 - the up grade menu brain
05:40 - fart and of course that shouldn't be
05:43 - capitalized there we go all right so
05:45 - this is the upgrade menu and then we can
05:47 - go and find our Co font the little put
05:51 - steps I'm going to be using that again
05:53 - and we can size this up at Bunch so
05:56 - let's make that something like 64 drag
05:59 - it it up there anchor it to the
06:02 - top and while we at it the astronaut
06:05 - should be anchored to the left hand side
06:08 - the center of the left hand side and his
06:10 - arm should yeah that's fine at the
06:13 - center um and everything else looks good
06:17 - awesome so you can see how that looks
06:19 - and uh it should do just fine if we mess
06:23 - around with it good then we can take our
06:26 - text and make that completely white I
06:28 - think that looks pretty awesome then we
06:30 - can take uh and add on a shadow effect
06:33 - and let's make this red solid color and
06:37 - uh let's make the shadow go from three
06:40 - to -3 there and you can see that just
06:43 - gives it this cool retro look I'm going
06:45 - to take the astronaut here and maybe
06:47 - move him out just a tiny bit so he
06:49 - doesn't take up so much space on the uh
06:51 - screen and maybe move him down a bit too
06:53 - so something like that looks pretty good
06:56 - and uh the upgrade text we can drag that
07:00 - up a bit there we go and uh now we can
07:03 - actually fill in some text here so this
07:05 - is the uh upgrade uh
07:09 - title and we can just use that as a base
07:12 - so let's duplicate that and uh let's
07:15 - call this the
07:18 - um
07:21 - Health amount maybe and uh this is
07:25 - simply going to say that
07:28 - health and then a colon and then uh the
07:31 - current amount of Health that we have
07:32 - I'm just going to set this to
07:35 - 120 um and of course we're going to be
07:38 - changing this through script and then we
07:40 - can set maybe the size to something like
07:42 - 24 uh maybe a bit bigger something like
07:46 - 40 actually and uh the effect the shadow
07:50 - effect here I want to make that black
07:51 - instead and I want to make it a lot
07:53 - thinner so something like 2 to -2 that
07:57 - looks great so just to give it an
07:59 - outline but it doesn't need to be very
08:02 - clear actually maybe one to 1 um yeah I
08:06 - think that's even better uh so we're
08:08 - going to stick with that but I I like
08:10 - the white color so we're going to uh
08:12 - stick with that
08:14 - too uh so under the upgrade menu we can
08:16 - now create another Mt and uh this is
08:19 - simply going to act as a container for
08:21 - all of the different attributes just
08:24 - like the health amount uh that we want
08:26 - to display this way we can very easily
08:28 - add more we can even add them through
08:30 - code and it will make sure that they uh
08:33 - they are laid out correctly on the
08:35 - screen so uh this will simply acts kind
08:38 - of as a group of elements uh in the UI
08:42 - so uh I'm going to drag it out something
08:44 - like this I'm then going to rename this
08:47 - to
08:51 - attributes there we go then I'm going to
08:53 - take the health amount and drag it under
08:55 - attributes then under add component I'm
08:58 - going to go under layout and then choose
09:01 - vertical layout group and this is going
09:03 - to make sure that um all as as we add
09:08 - more attribute guy elements it's going
09:11 - to stretch them to fit uh this UI
09:15 - element vertically so if I add another
09:17 - one here you can see it makes them uh
09:19 - stack and that makes it very easy to add
09:22 - more attributes for now I'm going to
09:24 - stick with health amount and a um maybe
09:28 - speed amount
09:31 - and
09:33 - uh yeah that looks pretty good and we
09:35 - can change this here
09:37 - speed and then we want it to be um the
09:41 - default speed is 10 I believe again
09:43 - we're going to be changing this uh
09:45 - through code so it really doesn't matter
09:47 - then we're going to take the health and
09:49 - speed amount and make sure that it's uh
09:51 - centered on the left here and now you
09:54 - can see we can move them both by simply
09:55 - scaling the attributes so we can simply
09:59 - scale that over there and that already
10:01 - looks very fine and if we want them
10:03 - closer together well we can just scale
10:06 - down the attributes here uh or we can
10:08 - play around around with uh some of this
10:11 - functionality so uh we can choose the
10:13 - alignment upper left is going to be just
10:15 - fine we can choose whether or not we
10:18 - want them to ex be expanded on the
10:20 - height and width and we can also add a
10:23 - component on each of these which which
10:25 - is the layout element that will allow us
10:28 - to control different properties for
10:30 - width and height for that element that's
10:32 - not something we're going to be needing
10:34 - uh here but it's definitely something
10:36 - that you should pay attention to because
10:38 - it's it's actually really uh cool so
10:41 - play around with these things they can
10:43 - make your life a lot easier so as long
10:46 - as we only have these two I'm just going
10:47 - to scale them in like this and uh that's
10:50 - basically all we're going to have uh for
10:52 - the attributes uh for now uh so the next
10:56 - thing that we want to add are some
10:58 - buttons that will allow us to upgrade
11:01 - each of these attributes and for that
11:03 - I'm simply going to duplicate the
11:05 - attributes here and instead call these
11:07 - upgrade buttons and again instead of
11:11 - health and speed amounts we're going to
11:13 - have some buttons in here and I want to
11:15 - Simply take the buttons from our main
11:17 - menu that we made our quit and play
11:20 - button that for some reason is spared
11:22 - but if we hit play here you can see they
11:24 - appear again these two cool buttons
11:26 - right here I'm just going to take the
11:28 - play one copy that go back into the main
11:31 - level find our UI overlay our upgrade
11:34 - menu go on our upgrade buttons and paste
11:37 - that in there and uh you can see it
11:41 - works just fine but we need to take our
11:44 - upgrade buttons here and move this
11:46 - entire thing uh so we're going to move
11:49 - it
11:50 - over uh I actually want to scale in the
11:53 - attributes a bit here move place the
11:57 - upgrade buttons somewhere there
11:59 - I can just duplicate these so we can see
12:01 - what it looks like if we have two side
12:04 - by side scale them in kind of like that
12:08 - then we can take um then we can add some
12:12 - padding and we can also add some spacing
12:14 - so I want a spacing of maybe um five
12:19 - actually a bit more maybe 10 and then
12:21 - maybe uh 10 on the
12:24 - top and 10 on the
12:27 - bottom some something like that looks
12:30 - pretty good uh but I want to play around
12:32 - with these buttons but because I'm not
12:34 - entirely satisfied with how they look uh
12:37 - so I'm going to take the effect distance
12:38 - here change that to a two and ative -2 I
12:43 - think that's actually a lot better
12:46 - already and I kind of like how that
12:48 - looks then we can go and expand it this
12:51 - and then uh change the text to
12:53 - oops to
12:56 - upgrade and uh the font sign we're going
12:59 - to have to bring that down a bit to
13:01 - maybe 36 nope 33 Okay so I think we are
13:05 - going to go with something like 26 there
13:09 - that looks pretty good and uh instead of
13:13 - making this black we could also make it
13:15 - some kind of like appealing orange
13:17 - yellowish color no that doesn't look too
13:21 - good uh we could add an outline on the
13:24 - upgrade but I think that would add Too
13:26 - Many Colors I actually like this black
13:28 - just like this this and then we can
13:30 - rename this to an upgrade button and we
13:33 - can delete the play button there and
13:35 - then simply duplicate this uh but I also
13:38 - want to um remove the event trigger
13:41 - here uh remove component we have the
13:45 - animator and all that which is fine and
13:48 - uh let's just try and duplicate that and
13:50 - hit play and see if it works if we hover
13:52 - over these and again the game is playing
13:55 - in the background so uh you are going to
13:58 - be hearing shot noises uh it's not
14:01 - currently paused or anything we're not
14:02 - checking if this is open uh but you can
14:05 - see just how nice these buttons actually
14:07 - feel uh so I really like this animation
14:10 - and I think we're just going to uh stick
14:12 - with this uh one thing that I might want
14:15 - to do is actually make some kind of uh
14:19 - uh image that
14:21 - goes that kind of covers our entire
14:24 - health and our entire upgrade uh and
14:26 - that will kind of need us to restructure
14:28 - this a little bit so I'm kind of making
14:30 - some of this up on the go which is
14:32 - definitely something that you're going
14:34 - to have to do when designing a UI it is
14:37 - a creative process so um I excuse if I
14:39 - haven't thought this uh all the way
14:42 - through which I have not um so I'm going
14:45 - to take the health amount here and just
14:48 - duplicate this and move it out of the
14:50 - attribute so we can kind of experiment
14:52 - with it up here and uh yeah so this is
14:56 - the health amount and that's fine uh I'm
14:58 - also going going to make an uh empty
15:02 - object so create empty here and this is
15:06 - going to be called attribute and it's
15:07 - going to be storing the amount and a
15:10 - button so uh we can take our health
15:12 - amount and drag it on the attribute and
15:14 - we can take whoops before we do that I
15:17 - want to take the attribute here and just
15:20 - scale it to the health amount here it's
15:23 - going to be fine and then take our
15:24 - health amount under the attribute there
15:26 - we go and uh the health amount
15:30 - um we want this to scale with the
15:36 - attribute uh from
15:39 - there but we don't want it to scale on
15:42 - the other direction so we only want it
15:45 - to scale there so we can kind of do this
15:48 - yeah that's very nice and then uh we
15:52 - down here we need some kind of button
15:54 - and that's going to be our upgrade
15:55 - button so we're going to take that
15:57 - duplicate it and again put it under our
15:59 - attribute and drag it up here and we can
16:04 - drag the button in there actually uh
16:08 - instead let's take our
16:10 - attribute and drag that out a bit size
16:13 - that up take our upgrade
16:17 - button drag that there and there and uh
16:21 - we want this to
16:23 - scale uh with the
16:26 - side but not
16:29 - with the x axis I believe so this way we
16:33 - can do this yes that's perfect so it
16:35 - actually scales and it moves uh but it
16:38 - doesn't scale on on the wrong axis so
16:41 - now that we have this idea of an
16:43 - attribute we can simply put different
16:46 - attributes under the attributes group
16:48 - here so we can delete the upgrade
16:50 - buttons and we can delete our two
16:53 - attributes and simply take our one
16:56 - attribute here and place that on your
16:58 - attrib so you can see how that looks and
17:01 - we then of course need to make this
17:03 - wider there we go and uh when we now
17:06 - duplicate this attribute you can see
17:08 - just how smooth uh that is and we can
17:11 - then go under our attributes uh object
17:15 - and add some padding just as we did
17:17 - before so that's that's going to be 10
17:19 - 10 and
17:20 - 10 and there we go so that makes it a
17:23 - lot easier to add new attributes and I
17:25 - think it it's just more uh logical
17:29 - overall so this is going to be our
17:31 - health attribute and this is going to be
17:34 - our
17:35 - speed uh
17:38 - attribute there we go and you can of
17:40 - course preab Alize this if you want to
17:42 - make it into a preab that's completely
17:45 - fine and this is of course going to be
17:47 - instead of writing what kind of amount
17:48 - it is I'm just going to write amount and
17:51 - this is going to be our speed and it's
17:53 - going to be defaulted to 10 so I think
17:57 - this is a lot better if you structure it
17:59 - this way and therefore that's what we
18:01 - are going to do so we have our
18:04 - attributes and everything should scale
18:06 - nicely with the screen this is parented
18:08 - to the center so you will notice if I go
18:11 - ahead and do this uh if we have a very
18:14 - tiny screen our astronaut will actually
18:16 - overlap with our properties but again
18:19 - this will require a very uh small screen
18:23 - uh so I think we will be okay with that
18:26 - for now at least um you can of course go
18:28 - ahead and change how these things move
18:31 - uh on different screen sizes um I mean
18:34 - if we go ahead and choose uh the
18:36 - smallest possible screen here you can
18:38 - see it does overlap a little bit uh so
18:41 - we can maybe take our
18:43 - astronaut just move him out here so that
18:46 - he doesn't overlap with the properties
18:48 - and this way our game is kind of future
18:51 - proof no matter what screen we want to
18:53 - display it on so that's fine and um yeah
18:57 - I believe that is all we needed to do
18:59 - with the UI work let me just check how
19:02 - long I've been recording
19:05 - here yeah so this is already almost 20
19:08 - minutes and therefore I'm going to cut
19:10 - off the recording here and we're going
19:12 - to continue in the next video by
19:13 - actually scripting some functionality
19:15 - into this so we're going to actually
19:17 - make our upgrade menu do something this
19:20 - was just uh the very beginning of a a
19:22 - very cool system A system that I
19:24 - definitely want your feedback on so if
19:26 - you have any great ideas on uh what you
19:29 - want to see in this uh upgrade uh menu
19:32 - system uh definitely write them in the
19:35 - comment section you can also visit the
19:37 - braet forum both uh with suggestions or
19:40 - if you want to ask some questions about
19:42 - how you can Implement your own ideas if
19:44 - I'm not able to cover them in the
19:45 - tutorial so that was basically it for
19:48 - this video stay tuned for the next one
19:50 - and I'll see you
19:57 - there
20:00 - oh
