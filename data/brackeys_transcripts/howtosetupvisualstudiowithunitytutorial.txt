00:00 - thanks for tuning in at
00:03 - braies hello everyone and welcome to
00:05 - this video on setting up visual studio
00:07 - for Unity so in this video we are going
00:10 - to firstly install Visual Studio then
00:12 - we're going to set up unity vs which is
00:14 - a Unity package that nicely integrates
00:17 - visual studio with unity allowing us to
00:20 - use a bunch of awesome features uh which
00:23 - I will talk about in a sec then we will
00:25 - install a cool plugin called strium
00:28 - which I use all the time then we're
00:30 - going to set up my preferred um Visual
00:32 - Studio settings and finally I will show
00:35 - you how to install Styles or themes
00:37 - because let's face it uh your color
00:39 - scheme is the most important thing uh
00:42 - that's what kind of makes you look
00:44 - awesome compared to the audio program is
00:46 - just using the default one cool so why
00:50 - would you use Visual Studio well if
00:52 - you're on a Mac you can't uh Visual
00:54 - Studio is Windows only so if you're not
00:57 - on a Windows computer you can just skip
00:59 - this if you are however um you can
01:02 - pretty much just get used to visual
01:04 - studio right now I mean it's the most uh
01:08 - commonly used IDE ever um so you will
01:11 - encounter uh a problem that should be
01:14 - solved with Visual Studio at some point
01:16 - in in in your programming career and
01:19 - therefore it's a good program to get
01:20 - used to also Visual Studio is much more
01:24 - solid than uh mono develop at least uh
01:27 - that's my opinion I think mono develop
01:30 - has way too many bugs way too often and
01:32 - so visual studio um is is just a solid
01:36 - piece of software um also uh Visual
01:39 - Studio allows you to insert break points
01:42 - evaluate variables and expressions use
01:45 - uh code uh wi it kind of to generate uh
01:48 - code or to browse code uh we can install
01:51 - plugins it has intellisense which is uh
01:54 - the
01:55 - um uh the code prediction uh uh solution
01:59 - that Visual Studio uses which is
02:01 - actually pretty great so there are many
02:04 - advantages to using visual
02:06 - studio awesome so let's get on with
02:09 - installing a visual studio on a Windows
02:12 - computer so what you want to do here is
02:14 - you want to head on over to visual
02:16 - studio.com and once you get here you
02:19 - will uh very quickly notice that there
02:21 - are a bunch of different versions for uh
02:24 - Visual Studio it comes uh with the
02:27 - community version the express version
02:30 - and pro versions all that kind of stuff
02:33 - and uh when you first get here you might
02:35 - be tempted to just download visual
02:37 - studio Community right here and we are
02:39 - going to be downloading Visual Studio
02:41 - Studio Community but we are not going to
02:43 - be using the 2015 editions um those are
02:47 - currently in preview which basically
02:48 - means a uh public testing phase uh and
02:52 - so if you want to go with the completely
02:54 - solid build go to free Visual Studio in
02:56 - the top right hand corner and then
02:58 - download visual Studio Community from
03:01 - here great so once you've downloaded the
03:04 - uh Visual Studio installer simply click
03:06 - it and run to open it up and uh
03:09 - installing and uninstalling Visual
03:11 - Studio can be extremely slow and
03:14 - therefore I've done this beforehand but
03:17 - you should be able to Simply go through
03:19 - an a fairly uh simple installation
03:22 - process and uh then you should end up
03:25 - with a button that says launch visual
03:27 - studio and I'm going to do that now uh
03:30 - one thing that you will notice during
03:32 - the installation period is that um it
03:36 - will ask you which modules you want to
03:38 - install and there you can basically
03:40 - disable uh deselect all of them uh you
03:43 - will only need core Visual Studio
03:46 - components um however on uh my system
03:49 - right now I have installed the uh C++ uh
03:52 - module because I do a um Fair bit of C++
03:56 - coding on this computer but that's
03:57 - completely up to you you can also import
03:59 - of the web stuff or whatever uh that you
04:03 - uh you think you need cool so uh once
04:07 - you start a visual studio you should be
04:08 - met with a screen that looks somewhat
04:10 - like this and uh once you have that open
04:13 - we can basically just close it again for
04:16 - now so and then we can move on to the uh
04:19 - Next Step so I'll just dock this on my
04:21 - secondary monitor here and take a look
04:24 - at what to do next so now uh we will
04:27 - integrate unity vs so in order to do
04:30 - this let's open up Unity I have a Unity
04:33 - 4 or 5.1 installed it just came out
04:38 - yesterday cool so I've made this uh kind
04:41 - of test scene to just show you how unity
04:44 - vs actually works and uh you can see
04:47 - here in my assets that I have three
04:49 - folders I have an editor folder a script
04:51 - folder and a standards assets folder and
04:53 - under the script folder I have a single
04:55 - script called drag rigid body and that
04:58 - just currently sits on this Cube that
05:00 - I've made and it simply allows me when I
05:03 - play to drag around this Cube and yes
05:07 - this is a script from the standards
05:09 - assets pack so if that's something
05:10 - you're interested in you can simply
05:12 - right click and uh import
05:15 - it cool so uh in order to implement
05:18 - unity vs um you are going to have to
05:22 - download something because what most
05:23 - people do here is they're going to edit
05:26 - preferences and then external tools and
05:28 - then they simply select
05:30 - uh visual studio. exe but that's not
05:32 - going to work uh so what we're going to
05:35 - do instead is we'll go to Unity
05:38 - vs.com and uh unity vs was actually
05:41 - created by a company called syntax tree
05:44 - which is now acquired by Microsoft so
05:46 - they are now working on it internally
05:48 - which is pretty cool but um the tools
05:51 - are still available at this website so
05:53 - simply click visual studio 2013 or
05:56 - whatever version you happen to be using
05:59 - uh and and simply click that and it's
06:01 - going to download about um 10 megabytes
06:05 - of an installer here you can see it's
06:07 - downloading there and I'm just going to
06:08 - cancel that and then instead go to my
06:11 - downloads because I've already
06:12 - downloaded it beforehand you can see
06:15 - here um and I'm simply going to click
06:17 - that to R whoops now I started the
06:20 - download again I want to show that in
06:23 - folder instead if I can get to it here
06:27 - here we go so I'm just going to double
06:29 - click that and run
06:31 - it and I will just close down these tabs
06:34 - again and then hit next and uh you can
06:37 - see again I've already installed this
06:39 - simply run through the installation
06:41 - process it's very easy and then uh you
06:43 - should be done however it's uh quite uh
06:46 - unusual with this installer that
06:48 - basically nothing nothing happens uh
06:51 - when uh it's done it looks like nothing
06:53 - has changed that's not entirely correct
06:56 - because if we go to this PC go to look
06:58 - at this see then program files and this
07:01 - is going to be 32 bits so times uh
07:05 - 86 and then we uh scroll down to where
07:08 - it says Microsoft you should see
07:11 - Microsoft Visual Studio tools for Unity
07:14 - and inside of this we have the 2013
07:17 - version and finally here we have a do
07:20 - Unity package if you cannot find this on
07:22 - your system simply search for visual
07:25 - studio 2013 tools so you would just go
07:28 - uh like like this and it's it's right
07:30 - there you can see I already Al also have
07:34 - um the 2015 version um if I uh happen to
07:39 - uh should be happening to if I happen to
07:42 - need that so uh now let's double click
07:45 - this to open it up in unity and just
07:48 - like any uh other um Unity package it
07:52 - will just import when you click a button
07:55 - and it should basically be done already
07:58 - so now we have a folder here called
07:59 - unity vs and after a second it will load
08:02 - again and say that the uh system or
08:05 - version specific dll was created and
08:07 - that's very important that it's created
08:09 - successfully in order uh for this to
08:12 - work uh also to make sure that
08:14 - everything is set up correctly go to the
08:16 - uh Visual Studio tools tab that should
08:18 - appear up here if not you can refresh it
08:20 - by simply pressing a tab uh up here and
08:23 - it should refresh the bar and then hit
08:26 - generate project files just to make sure
08:29 - cool now you can also see under edit
08:32 - preferences external tools that it says
08:34 - Unity vs. openen file and that it has uh
08:38 - these
08:40 - arguments awesome so what we can do now
08:42 - is we can go to visual studio open in
08:45 - visual
08:46 - studio and it's going to boot up our
08:48 - project inside of visual studio and we
08:53 - should in a moment be able to see our
08:55 - full Unity hierarchy right here so you
08:58 - can see that we have we have the editor
09:00 - stuff the plugin stuff and uh the normal
09:03 - stuff I should say um uh separately uh
09:07 - but we can just collapse these two and
09:09 - under the assets folder we have scripts
09:12 - and there under we have the direct rigid
09:14 - body. Cs and uh we can even see what
09:17 - kinds of uh fields and methods uh it's
09:21 - implementing uh all of its members there
09:24 - so uh and once you click on that you can
09:26 - see that you can browse the code and you
09:28 - should have Auto completion enabled also
09:31 - so if I were to go uh like transform do
09:35 - uh position you can see that that's
09:38 - working just fine and it even gives us
09:41 - uh runtime uh errors and feedback so
09:45 - that's super cool awesome so that was
09:49 - actually the whole first part of this
09:51 - tutorial uh was just attaching this
09:54 - Editor to Unity and that's certainly
09:56 - something we've done you can also see
09:58 - that if I was to close this script here
10:01 - but keep Visual Studio open we can go
10:03 - under the cube and simply double click
10:05 - on the script here and it's going to
10:06 - instantly boot up in visual studio so uh
10:10 - they are indeed linked
10:12 - um actually really use utilizing these
10:16 - tools like attaching to Unity up here
10:19 - and uh error handling and breakpoints
10:22 - and all that that's for an entirely
10:24 - different video and uh they already have
10:27 - a lot of that kind of stuff on the plug
10:30 - and such so I'm not going to go into it
10:32 - here instead I will show you um the next
10:35 - uh Point here which is uh installing
10:38 - striping so when you're using visual
10:40 - studio uh and unity together you might
10:43 - notice that visual studio uh saves the
10:46 - uh files with a different line lending
10:49 - uh format than uh other editors you've
10:52 - been using or especially if you're using
10:55 - Version Control uh there might be some
10:57 - conflicts so the solution to this is
11:00 - just using strippen which is a plugin
11:03 - that will allow you to specify a certain
11:06 - uh eof end of file or EOL End of Line uh
11:10 - format um for saving files because End
11:14 - of Line uh formats can really matter a
11:17 - lot uh when using uh some files in some
11:20 - contexts on some systems it's a whole
11:22 - separate science but really just install
11:25 - this plugin so what you want to do is
11:27 - basically just search for uh strim um I
11:31 - will also have all the links in the
11:33 - description and hit download and uh then
11:35 - we're going to download the add in only
11:37 - installer for vs
11:40 - 2013 and we can just uh click that and
11:43 - uh it should uh put some files you can
11:46 - see here it says that it's already
11:48 - installed but it should put some files
11:50 - into uh the documents Visual Studio add
11:53 - folder and uh you can of course check it
11:56 - uh if there are there but it just worked
11:58 - for me the first time and you might need
12:00 - to uh restart Visual Studio in order for
12:03 - it to appear once uh you've done that
12:05 - you should be able to go to tools strip
12:08 - them and then just select Unix LF uh you
12:12 - can also convert files matching a reg
12:14 - regular
12:15 - Expressions a reg regular expression uh
12:20 - but I recommend just selecting Unix and
12:22 - uh get it over with that way so uh cool
12:25 - and uh next up on our list that was a
12:28 - quick one is U my preferred settings so
12:31 - I have this whole setup with Visual
12:34 - Studio where I like to keep uh my stuff
12:37 - and uh kind of how it uh does cod
12:40 - completion and all that if you would
12:42 - like these settings um and the style
12:45 - that I'm using using um you uh simply
12:48 - need to go to um the link in the
12:51 - description um that should be a download
12:53 - link to this bravs OR breis vs. siip
12:58 - file where if you open this you will see
13:01 - a breis v uh breis vs vs settings file
13:07 - and uh we can just copy this to the
13:09 - desktop and you can see it right here
13:11 - and this contains all the information
13:13 - that Visual Studio needs uh so uh in
13:16 - order to actually use this we simply go
13:18 - to tools then Import and Export settings
13:22 - then import selected environment
13:24 - settings go to next we don't want to
13:27 - save our current settings
13:29 - then we want to go in here we want to
13:32 - hit browse and you can see here that we
13:35 - have a folder for all of our settings
13:37 - files so simply copy this path go into a
13:41 - separate uh finder window paste the path
13:44 - and then here we want to copy our braies
13:47 - vs settings uh so simply copy those in
13:51 - there and you can see I already have
13:53 - mine but I'm just going to replace mine
13:56 - and now you can simply select it in here
13:58 - hit open
14:00 - and uh then we can hit
14:02 - next and you can see here we can choose
14:05 - what modules we want to uh install from
14:08 - this uh settings file uh so if that's
14:10 - something you want to keep uh the way it
14:12 - is you can go through um I recommend
14:15 - just doing all of it I haven't made any
14:17 - huge changes uh but if you want to use
14:20 - uh the standard uh kind of color scheme
14:24 - simply go under uh options environment
14:27 - and then uncheck fonts and colors cool
14:31 - so now just hit finish and it should
14:34 - reload everything here the interface and
14:36 - all of the uh preferences should uh
14:39 - slowly be added and uh while it does
14:43 - this oh okay it's actually already done
14:46 - so you can see here the uh theme that
14:48 - I'm using it's um it's the monai theme I
14:52 - believe and uh I've made a few changes
14:55 - to it I think it looks pretty nice um
14:58 - and you can see that I like to have the
15:00 - solution Explorer and Class View over
15:03 - here it's pretty standard for visual
15:05 - studio uh it's only in the unity version
15:07 - that they've put them over here but then
15:10 - again uh it's it's completely up to you
15:12 - you can also make the output here just
15:14 - go under the error list um whoops the
15:18 - have the error list a bit bigger here uh
15:20 - all of that is up to you that's just
15:23 - layout awesome so now that that's set up
15:26 - everything should be working and the
15:28 - last thing I wanted to show you was if
15:30 - you want your own color scheme you can
15:33 - go to a website called um Studio
15:39 - styles. or studi
15:42 - style. um and uh that should also be in
15:45 - the description and here they have over
15:47 - 3,000 uh color schemes so you can get
15:49 - exactly the the one you want and you can
15:52 - of course also very easily customize
15:54 - them uh if actually just open up visual
15:57 - studio here again
15:59 - should be able to see just how easy it
16:01 - is to customize so if we go to uh
16:05 - tool
16:06 - options then go under environment fonts
16:09 - and colors you should be able to see
16:11 - that everything is very easy to to
16:15 - change in
16:16 - here cool so that was basically it for
16:20 - this video I hope you enjoyed it and uh
16:23 - let me know what you would like to see
16:25 - next so thanks for watching I'll see you
16:27 - in the next video
16:29 - [Music]
16:38 - oh
