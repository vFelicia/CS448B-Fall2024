00:00 - so once again I managed to miss out on
00:02 - Luna Marais which of course made me very
00:04 - sad but I guess I don't really have
00:05 - anyone to blame except for my own poor
00:07 - planning
00:08 - however in true game gem spirit I refuse
00:10 - to be discouraged and decided to make a
00:12 - game on my own I gave myself four days
00:15 - to work on the project whatever I
00:17 - managed to do in those four days I would
00:18 - make a video about hashtag no pressure
00:21 - now before we get into the video I
00:22 - quickly want to mention that we worked
00:24 - with the unity asset store to put
00:25 - together a bundle of my favorite unity
00:27 - assets in 2018 the bundle includes
00:30 - assets that have really helped me out as
00:31 - a developer over the years check out the
00:33 - bundle now and get a 33% discount on all
00:36 - the included assets using coupon code
00:38 - brackets best
00:39 - 2018 so recently I've been playing a lot
00:42 - of co-op games with friends and one of
00:44 - our favorites is overcooked
00:46 - they work together or everything
00:47 - descends into complete madness cooking
00:49 - game I've also always been really fond
00:51 - of farming and sandbox games more
00:53 - specifically the relaxed atmosphere and
00:55 - cute graphics of games like stardew
00:57 - valley or even terraria so thought it
00:59 - might be fun to take this super relaxed
01:01 - vibe of these games and combine it with
01:03 - the horrible hell like stress of
01:04 - overcooked of course it's always a good
01:06 - idea to start by getting some thoughts
01:08 - down on paper so I called on Andreas and
01:10 - Thea to help figure out what gameplay
01:11 - mechanics a game like this should have I
01:13 - really recommend going through this
01:15 - stage with other people but because
01:16 - otherwise you might overlook a crucial
01:18 - aspect of the game but also because it
01:20 - helps you figure out what other people
01:22 - think would be fun to play the idea was
01:24 - simple every 40 seconds or so a truck
01:26 - arrives to pick up crops the two players
01:28 - have to work together to prepare as many
01:30 - crops as possible tending to them in
01:32 - various ways to avoid them from dying
01:34 - out at the top is a list of requested
01:36 - goods if the players load these goods
01:38 - onto the truck in the correct order they
01:40 - get bonus points now that might sound
01:42 - fairly straightforward but I quickly
01:44 - figured out that there are quite a few
01:45 - gameplay systems that need to work
01:47 - together for this game to be even
01:48 - playable my way to solve this do
01:51 - absolutely nothing except ignored and
01:52 - start with graphics so first I created a
01:54 - quick sketch to figure out the overall
01:56 - layout of the map when I had something
01:58 - that the somewhat coherent I started
01:59 - drawing out the different elements in
02:01 - Photoshop now I'm not much of an artist
02:03 - but I do think that it eventually turned
02:05 - out alright I did have to go back and
02:07 - change a lot of the graphics later
02:09 - though and then created a new unity
02:11 - project brought in all the sprites and
02:12 - said them
02:13 - using the time map editor however I
02:15 - quickly found that I felt constricted by
02:17 - trying to fit everything onto a grid and
02:19 - I wanted a lot of pieces like the truck
02:21 - and the players to be able to move
02:22 - freely
02:23 - so I actually scratched the tile map and
02:25 - decided to use freely moving sprites
02:26 - instead next up was player movement
02:29 - which was for once
02:30 - super simple in fact it took just about
02:33 - 2 minutes once the player at this stage
02:35 - the weird-looking barrel was moving
02:36 - around the level I started working on
02:38 - the meat of the game crops I use
02:41 - scriptable objects to make it easy to
02:42 - create different types of crops in the
02:44 - editor and laid out the framework for
02:46 - how the player would interact with crops
02:47 - during the game to finish off the day I
02:49 - created some sprites for the first
02:51 - player as already told you my art skills
02:53 - aren't great
02:54 - I tried creating a hat but I ended up
02:56 - with mr. peanut next day I jump straight
02:58 - into player animation and added him to
03:01 - the game also created my first crop
03:02 - which was supposed to look like potatoes
03:04 - and replaced a large table with a bunch
03:06 - of smaller ones for keeping tools or
03:08 - goods
03:08 - now before planning a crop the plane
03:11 - needs to plow the ground so I added a
03:13 - plow tool that the player can pick up in
03:14 - use
03:15 - I also added seed barrels where the
03:16 - player could get seeds to plant in the
03:18 - dirt after planning a crop it has a
03:20 - growth value that increases over time
03:22 - once this value reaches one the crop
03:24 - changes to show that it's fully grown
03:25 - and the player can harvest it
03:27 - I used items to easily keep track of
03:29 - what state each crop is currently in at
03:31 - this point I realized I needed a way to
03:33 - show what the player was currently
03:34 - carrying so I created a tiny pop-up to
03:36 - display this I later used the same
03:38 - graphic to display which seeds was in
03:40 - which barrel and that was the end of day
03:42 - 2 what I forgot to mention that this
03:44 - happened so overall it was a success on
03:47 - day 3 it was pixel art time so I wrapped
03:50 - myself in a comfy blanket put on a good
03:52 - podcast and just started painting away
03:54 - and resin Thea also came up with the
03:56 - amazing idea that we should have less
03:57 - traditional crops like pizza noodles and
04:00 - hot wings that's just something really
04:02 - funny to me about having to plant a
04:04 - phone and water it to get a pizza at
04:06 - this point the game was kind of starting
04:08 - to come together and I started to feel
04:10 - like I might have something ready for
04:11 - the end of it of course there was still
04:12 - quite a few core pieces missing I
04:14 - programmed the truck to drive back and
04:16 - forth on schedule and made it so that
04:17 - the player could drop off crops and get
04:19 - points in return to display the crops on
04:21 - the truck I actually ended up using a UI
04:23 - canvas with a grid layout which work
04:25 - really well for this I then drew up the
04:27 - second player mr. Peanut's brother mr.
04:30 - pickle and implemented him as well I
04:32 - used the new prefab variation to give
04:34 - him the same functionality as the player
04:35 - but changing the graphics and key
04:37 - bindings with overrides at the end of
04:39 - day 3 I was able to remove a bunch of
04:41 - tasks from my to-do list which felt
04:43 - really good and so finally day 4 was
04:46 - upon us and it was all about features
04:48 - first I implemented the system to keep
04:50 - track of requested goods are then
04:52 - displayed the score on the UI and I
04:54 - created a timer that would count down
04:55 - and show this green once the time was up
04:57 - and then programmed the watering
04:59 - mechanic yes I waited four days to do
05:01 - this and created a tiny icon that shows
05:03 - when a crop is close to drying out of
05:05 - course no watering mechanic is complete
05:07 - without a watering can so I made this
05:09 - hopeless attempt at one I also realized
05:11 - that if the crops actually died out the
05:13 - players needed a way to get rid of them
05:15 - so I quickly threw together a trash can
05:17 - where the players could dispose of
05:19 - unwanted crops finally andreas had this
05:21 - wonderful idea to create crows that
05:23 - would randomly target crops on the field
05:25 - and tried to eat them I thought this was
05:27 - genius because it adds a completely
05:29 - unexpected element to the game where
05:30 - players suddenly has to drop what he's
05:32 - doing and brush off to scare the crows
05:33 - away so without a performance care in
05:36 - the world
05:36 - I wrote some code I hope I will never
05:38 - have to look at again but somehow it
05:40 - worked without errors and it took only
05:42 - 35 minutes of course up until this point
05:44 - I had done little to no play testing
05:47 - which as I'm sure you all the thinking
05:49 - is normally incredibly stupid
05:51 - so at half past 5:00 in the evening we
05:53 - all sat down to play the game and we
05:55 - recklessly it worked and not only that
05:57 - it was actually fun i justed the amount
06:00 - of crows a bit and changed the timing
06:02 - between truck visits but with those
06:03 - simple changes the game felt complete we
06:06 - all went home to get a good night's
06:07 - sleep I was exhausted but really happy
06:09 - about the result the next day I wrote up
06:11 - the script for this video and now I'm
06:13 - talking into the microphone I'm starting
06:15 - to think that this might be a bit too
06:16 - meta but I'm also starting to think that
06:18 - I'm hungry let's just end the video here
06:20 - if you want to play the game I'll make
06:21 - sure to include a link to it in the
06:22 - description I'll also have a link to the
06:24 - source code in case you want to check
06:25 - that out and also don't forget to check
