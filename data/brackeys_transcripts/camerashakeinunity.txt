00:00 - a great way to add some extra oomph to a
00:01 - game is by using camera shape whoa it's
00:05 - great for emphasizing action and making
00:07 - your camera feel more part of the world
00:09 - so in this video we'll go over how to
00:10 - make your own camera shake and towards
00:12 - the end I'll show you how to set up an
00:13 - awesome tool that I personally use to
00:15 - shake things up get it because of the
00:19 - shape also this video is sponsored by
00:21 - Dennis pen tutor dennis is an awesome
00:23 - game dev tutor who's just launched a new
00:25 - course on udemy the complete unity 3d
00:28 - game development course by taking the
00:30 - course you'll learn how to code in
00:32 - c-sharp make basic 3d assets using
00:34 - blender as well as get a solid
00:36 - understanding of unity when you're done
00:39 - you will have created six different
00:40 - games from pong to fumble you'll also
00:42 - learn how to monetize your game using
00:44 - unity hats if this sounds like something
00:46 - you're interested in simply click the
00:48 - link in the description to get started
00:49 - and get a discount also special thanks
00:51 - to Sean Carey Diego guy kudamon dying
00:53 - guy in Murphy o infinity PBR your io mer
00:56 - and hands off tuned for their support on
00:58 - patreon alright let's get started so
01:00 - here's the scene in unity where every
01:01 - time I click with my mouse and explosion
01:04 - appears but of course this could look
01:06 - way cooler if we added some camera shake
01:09 - to do that that's select our main camera
01:11 - and let's add a new component to this
01:12 - called camera shake let's say new script
01:15 - select C sharp and hit create an ad now
01:17 - we can go ahead and delete both of the
01:19 - methods here and instead we want to
01:21 - create our own one but we don't want
01:23 - this to be a normal function we want
01:25 - this to be a cover of team if you've
01:27 - never heard about Kuro teens before I
01:29 - suggest checking out the link in the
01:30 - description for now we're just gonna
01:31 - power through whenever you're working
01:33 - with Kuro teens you want to make sure to
01:35 - have using system dark collections and
01:37 - instead of writing void at the beginning
01:39 - of her function we now write I in
01:41 - numerator then we follow it by the name
01:43 - of our function which we'll just call
01:45 - shake and our shape function is going to
01:46 - take in two parameters one for the
01:49 - duration of the shake and one for the
01:51 - magnitude in other words the strength of
01:53 - our shake and the first thing that we
01:55 - want to do is store the original
01:56 - position of our camera before we start
01:58 - shaking so that we can reset it once
02:00 - we're done we'll create a vector3 for
02:02 - this and call it original position and
02:05 - size equal to transform that local
02:07 - position and then we want to create a
02:09 - while loop because we want to keep
02:11 - shaking for X amount of seconds
02:13 - specified by our duration so we could go
02:16 - ahead and create a float called elapsed
02:19 - this is going to keep track of how much
02:21 - time has elapsed since we started
02:23 - shaking so by default we'll set this to
02:25 - zero then we want to keep shaking as
02:28 - long as while elapsed is less than the
02:31 - duration so in other words as long as
02:33 - the amount of time that has gone by
02:35 - since we started shaking doesn't exceed
02:38 - the duration well then we probably want
02:40 - to keep shaking and now a bunch of
02:42 - different ways to calculate the offset
02:43 - you want to apply to your camera in
02:45 - order to make it look like it's shaking
02:47 - but it can actually be done in an
02:48 - extremely simple way we're simply going
02:50 - to be offsetting it by a random amount
02:52 - on the X&Y
02:53 - every frame so first we'll calculate the
02:55 - X so float x equals a random range
02:59 - between negative 1 and 1 and we can then
03:02 - multiply this with our magnitude so the
03:04 - greater the magnitude the more will
03:06 - offset our camera and we'll do the same
03:08 - thing on the y so float y equals random
03:11 - that range between negative 1 and 1 and
03:13 - we'll multiply it again with the
03:15 - magnitude then we simply need to apply
03:16 - this offset to our cameras position so
03:19 - we'll go transform local position equals
03:22 - a new vector3
03:23 - and here we'll give it our X or Y and
03:26 - you could definitely offset it on the Z
03:28 - as well but in our case I don't think
03:30 - that's necessary so we'll simply use
03:32 - original position dot Z and this is kind
03:35 - of where the magic of the kuroh teen
03:37 - comes in because we want this while loop
03:39 - to basically be running alongside our
03:42 - update function so that every time the
03:44 - update function runs we go through and
03:46 - run this code once as well to do that we
03:49 - use a single line of code we write yield
03:52 - return no this basically means that
03:55 - before we continue on to the next
03:57 - iteration of the while loop we want to
03:59 - wait until the next frame is drawn again
04:01 - the syntax might be really weird if
04:03 - you've never encountered a current team
04:04 - before but that's basically what is
04:06 - happening also we of course want to make
04:08 - sure to update our elapsed time so right
04:11 - before we wait for the next frame we are
04:12 - going to write elapsed plus equals time
04:15 - Delta time so every frame we increase
04:17 - this value by the amount of time that
04:19 - went by and so this is going to keep
04:21 - running until we exceed our duration at
04:24 - which point we're going to get to this
04:26 - point in our code
04:27 - and we can go ahead and reset our
04:28 - position so we'll go transform dot local
04:31 - position equals our original position
04:33 - and there we go we've now created a crow
04:35 - routine that is going to shake our
04:37 - camera of course we want to be able to
04:39 - access this from another script in order
04:41 - to trigger it so we'll go ahead and mark
04:42 - it as public then we can go back into
04:45 - unity we should see we have no errors
04:46 - here we can go to the point where we
04:48 - want to trigger our camera shake in my
04:50 - case that's under my explosion trigger
04:52 - this is just a very simple script that
04:54 - every time I click with my mouse is
04:56 - going to play this particle effect so
04:59 - let's open up the script and as you can
05:01 - see this is exactly what it's doing we
05:03 - reference the explosion we check if we
05:05 - can Emmaus button down and if we do we
05:07 - press play on the explosion so just like
05:10 - we reference our particle system we also
05:12 - need to reference our camera shake so
05:14 - public camera shake and we'll just call
05:16 - it camera shake and then right after our
05:19 - explosion starts playing let's go camera
05:21 - shake dot and then we can simply call
05:23 - this shake function however here's
05:25 - another thing that you need to remember
05:26 - when working with kuroh teens and that
05:29 - is whenever we want to start a kuroh
05:31 - teen we can't just call it like a normal
05:33 - function instead we have to go and write
05:35 - start co-routine and we then pass it the
05:38 - function that we want to start like this
05:40 - and now we can simply feed it the
05:41 - duration I'm gonna set that to 0.15 and
05:44 - the magnitude I'm gonna set that to 0.4
05:46 - and now if we save this go to unity and
05:49 - drag in our main camera and then try to
05:51 - press play we can see that something
05:53 - happens the camera is definitely shaking
05:56 - but it also seems to be snapping to
05:58 - another position that's because we're
05:59 - currently just overriding the position
06:01 - of our main camera and our main camera
06:03 - might have some position in the world
06:05 - that we don't just want to ignore so
06:07 - what we do instead is create an empty
06:09 - game object that is basically gonna be
06:11 - the anchor of our camera so we'll go to
06:13 - the hierarchy right click on our camera
06:14 - and hit create empty I will call this
06:16 - our camera parent or camera holder and
06:19 - make sure to reset the transform here so
06:22 - it's at the same position as our main
06:24 - camera we'll then drag this out and
06:26 - instead take our camera and parent it to
06:28 - the camera holder so now our main
06:30 - cameras position should always be 0 0 0
06:32 - and then when we want to actually move
06:35 - our camera we instead move the camera
06:37 - holder this means that we can go ahead
06:38 - and over
06:39 - the position of our camera as much as we
06:41 - want it's still going to stay in the
06:43 - same general area under the camera
06:45 - holder so if we now hit play we can see
06:47 - our camera shake is working awesome so
06:49 - let's say simple and quick way to do a
06:52 - camera shake by yourself but it has some
06:54 - limitations it doesn't give too much
06:56 - control over this shake it doesn't
06:58 - rotate the camera in any way
06:59 - there's no fading in and out of the
07:01 - shake and there's no control over
07:02 - roughness or frequency it's always
07:05 - moving the camera every frame and so if
07:07 - you want smoother shaking this is not
07:09 - the way to go and also having to
07:11 - reference the camera shake every time
07:12 - and you start cover teens seems a bit
07:15 - clunky so if you want to get serious
07:17 - about your camera shake I recommend
07:19 - going to the asset store and picking up
07:21 - easy camera shake it's completely free
07:23 - and I'll of course have a link for it in
07:25 - the description I'm gonna go ahead and
07:26 - hit import hit import once more I should
07:28 - now see a folder in your project called
07:30 - easy camera shake only we have some
07:32 - documentation the different scripts as
07:34 - well as a demo scene that you can check
07:36 - out in our case I'm just gonna go to the
07:38 - game view here I'm gonna select our
07:40 - camera and get rid of the camera shake
07:42 - and instead I'm gonna go under the ICI
07:44 - camera shake and add the camera shaker
07:47 - here we can choose how much we want this
07:48 - shake to influence both our position and
07:51 - rotation for now we can just leave these
07:53 - values as is and the cool thing is that
07:55 - if we now go into our explosion trigger
07:57 - we can get rid of this variable at the
07:59 - top I'll go ahead and delete this piece
08:01 - of code as well instead we'll go to the
08:04 - very top and say that we want to be
08:05 - using easy camera shake and now all we
08:08 - need to do is go camera shaker dot
08:10 - instance and then we can do dot shake
08:13 - once and this is going to shake the
08:15 - camera once with all the values that we
08:17 - now specify first we're gonna give you
08:19 - the magnitude imma said that too for we
08:21 - can give it a roughness as it says here
08:23 - roughness of the shake lower values are
08:25 - smoother higher values are more jarring
08:27 - I'm gonna set this to forest well since
08:29 - we are working with an explosion here we
08:31 - then set the fade in time I'm gonna set
08:33 - that to 0.1 and a fade out time and I'll
08:36 - set that to 1 and if we save this and
08:38 - play well now we now have a much
08:41 - smoother camera shake that is both
08:43 - easier to use and allows for a much more
08:45 - in-depth control pretty cool right now I
08:48 - guess all we need is some sound effects
08:50 - that's pretty much it for this video if
