00:00 - so unitedly was a few weeks ago and I
00:02 - must admit that after watching the
00:04 - keynote I wasn't particularly impressed
00:06 - of course the video FX graph looks
00:08 - amazing and we did get to hear more
00:10 - about ECS but for me that was mostly it
00:13 - however that completely changed after
00:15 - unity held their broad map talk in the
00:18 - road map unity announced so many new
00:20 - features that I think are fundamentally
00:22 - going to change the way that people use
00:23 - unity it seems to me that 2019 is just
00:26 - going to be a year where unity ties up a
00:29 - lot of loose ends this is of course
00:31 - really exciting to see since a lot of
00:32 - this stuff has been talked about for
00:34 - such a long time and I think it's going
00:36 - to make unity better for both
00:37 - programmers and artists so let's have a
00:40 - look at what's coming to unity in the
00:42 - near future but first this video is
00:43 - sponsored by race and I who work with
00:45 - unity to create an awesome free plugin
00:47 - called unity visual search unity visual
00:50 - search allows you to find the perfect 3d
00:51 - assets for your project on the unity
00:53 - asset store with the help of resinize AI
00:55 - powered engine unity visual search
00:58 - understand precise structure and
00:59 - geometry so you can easily find visuals
01:01 - similar objects to the ones already in
01:04 - your scene you can even filter searches
01:05 - by price polygon count and number of
01:08 - materials not only does unity visual
01:10 - search help you find the perfect assets
01:12 - it also lets you preview and play around
01:14 - with them inside of your unity scene so
01:16 - if you're looking for high-quality game
01:18 - ready assets that will help you build
01:19 - beautiful prototypes in no time you've
01:21 - gotta check this out unity visual search
01:23 - is a completely free plugin so I
01:25 - definitely recommend you click the link
01:27 - in the description and try it out so
01:29 - ladies and gentlemen fasten your seat
01:33 - belts and get ready for takeoff because
01:35 - who put this in here who talks like this
01:40 - it came to video another party
01:42 - so without a doubt the biggest feature
01:45 - is that unity announced and unite is
01:47 - Vishal scripting that's right visual
01:50 - scripting is coming to unity one of the
01:52 - biggest reasons for people to choose
01:54 - unreal over unity has always been unreal
01:56 - blueprints a visual scripting solution
01:59 - is just a great tool for artists or non
02:01 - programmers in general who needs to
02:03 - modify the game without needing to write
02:05 - and understand c-sharp code frankly I'm
02:07 - a bit surprised that we're only seeing a
02:09 - building solution for this now given how
02:11 - many people have requested
02:12 - over the years regardless it's going to
02:14 - be really interesting to see how unity
02:16 - chooses to implement this feature and
02:18 - how much it's going to borrow from
02:19 - existing solutions like blueprints or
02:21 - both so far unity is promising a preview
02:24 - release in 2019 point two with more
02:27 - features being added in 2019 point three
02:29 - it looks like it's gonna have what you
02:31 - would expect from a modern visual
02:33 - scripting tool with inclusion of live
02:35 - editing which is definitely really cool
02:37 - I'm just really excited to see how this
02:39 - tool is going to be received by the
02:40 - community next up we have some updates
02:42 - to the package manager this includes a
02:44 - UI overhaul the ability to install and
02:46 - host packages using git and with 2000
02:49 - 19.3 we will see asset store support
02:52 - they're also planning to add a project
02:54 - browser that will make it easier to
02:56 - search for and navigate through packages
02:58 - both locally and on the asset store now
03:01 - in version 2019 point 1 the old unity
03:03 - launcher is finally being replaced by
03:05 - unity hub also your new hub 2.0 comes
03:08 - with a new UI and with that a dark mode
03:11 - can also support CLI and features
03:14 - advanced templates which allow you to
03:16 - search categorize and customize your
03:18 - templates and unity hub finally allows
03:20 - us to interact with the project based on
03:22 - that the entire asset import pipeline is
03:25 - getting replaced which means yes much
03:27 - less waiting for huge projects to load
03:29 - and that's all I have to say about that
03:31 - and now to something unity has never
03:33 - done before redesigned their entire
03:36 - editor the unity has talked about this
03:38 - before but we are slowly gathering more
03:40 - information this means new icons a new
03:42 - font that is adjustable in text size and
03:45 - hover state controls to give a more
03:46 - responsive UI also it seems to have a
03:49 - much more flat look than the current
03:51 - editor at first I didn't really like it
03:53 - but the more pictures I see I must admit
03:55 - that it's growing on me
03:57 - but isn't it always like this with new
03:59 - UI also judging by the slide shown stuff
04:01 - like the train system Pro filter and
04:03 - poly brush all being integrated into the
04:06 - new editor this is such a needed change
04:07 - since all these tools are currently
04:09 - completely independent and frankly a bit
04:11 - weird to use and along with a new editor
04:14 - design we are also getting new ways that
04:16 - we can customize and extend it through
04:18 - code as of 2019 point 2 we will be using
04:21 - UI
04:21 - elements to build editor tools for the
04:24 - new UI UI elements is going to have some
04:26 - really nice improvements to the old
04:28 - system such as CSS support and more
04:30 - performant UI renderer and runtime
04:32 - preview and along with completely
04:34 - redesigning the editor unity is also
04:36 - adding a shortcut manager from version
04:38 - 2019 point one unity allows you to
04:40 - create your own shortcuts for pretty
04:42 - much any action you would like it even
04:44 - has its own API now this might not seem
04:46 - like a big deal but I think it's going
04:48 - to improve the general unity workflow
04:50 - and make it much easier for advanced
04:51 - users to speed up their process and now
04:54 - something that has been needed for such
04:55 - a long time a new input system I think
04:58 - we can all agree that unit is current
05:01 - way of setting up input is pretty much
05:03 - horrible you have this large list of
05:05 - input that is hard to manage and each
05:07 - input is so easy to mess up the new
05:10 - input system improves this a lot and
05:12 - it's actually been available on github
05:13 - for quite a while now
05:15 - basically it adds the ability to group
05:16 - to get the input using action maps find
05:19 - input to actions and add combos you can
05:22 - also add processors to the input to do
05:24 - stuff like adjust sensitivity or add
05:26 - dead cells as for the terrain
05:28 - improvements I'm still not impressed by
05:30 - what unity is showing us there of course
05:32 - a bunch of performance improvements in
05:34 - two thousand eighteen point three and in
05:36 - two thousand nineteen point one they are
05:38 - adding to rain falls but if that's all
05:40 - they currently have planned for the
05:41 - future I think it's a bit underwhelming
05:43 - of course I completely understand that
05:45 - it takes time to lay a new solid
05:46 - foundation for a system like this but
05:49 - I'd still like to hear that a complete
05:51 - tool redesign is at least on the roadmap
05:53 - especially when it comes to texture
05:55 - painting at least we know that unity has
05:57 - now assembled a team that only focuses
05:59 - on terrain now one of the big things
06:01 - that have been missing in terms of 2d
06:03 - has been dedicated to the lighting but
06:05 - with 2000 19.1 we can expect to see 2d
06:08 - lights and shadows including 2d shape
06:11 - based lights point lights and spotlights
06:13 - now I'm really excited about this but
06:16 - looking at the example footage in unity
06:18 - showed in the talk I'm actually a bit
06:20 - confused as to what it means we've
06:22 - always been able to use 3d lights
06:24 - together with a lid shader to achieve
06:26 - effects that look similar to what we see
06:27 - here now I'm sure that the new system is
06:29 - going to be more performant and being
06:31 - able to create shape based lights is
06:33 - definitely really cool but one of the
06:35 - big myths
06:35 - things for me has always been a way to
06:37 - do shadows similar to what a plug-in
06:39 - like to DDL does and I'm not currently
06:42 - seeing that here if anyone knows more
06:44 - about this or have any thoughts
06:45 - definitely let me know in the comments
06:47 - because I'd love to know more so these
06:49 - are the main features that unity will be
06:51 - implementing in 2019 but I think there
06:54 - are still a few features that are worth
06:56 - mentioning unity 2019 point two comes
06:58 - with improvements to the console window
07:00 - already in 2018 point three unities
07:02 - adding physical camera support to cinema
07:04 - scene ECS is getting more integrated
07:06 - with actual scene editing and a
07:08 - simplified api
07:09 - the first compiler is heading towards a
07:11 - version 1 release last but not least
07:13 - project tiny is set to launch at the end
07:15 - of December and that's pretty much it
