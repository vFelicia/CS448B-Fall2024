00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello
00:04 - everyone and welcome to make a game
00:06 - number 20 in this video we're going to
00:08 - be porting over our current project to
00:11 - the all new unity 5 I'm sorry but it's
00:14 - quite a long time since I've made a new
00:16 - video in this series but I've been
00:18 - moving and so things have been quite
00:20 - busy but let's get right into it first
00:23 - off if you don't have unity 5 already
00:25 - visit unity 3d comm click get unity and
00:30 - just download the free personal edition
00:32 - everything that was before pro with the
00:36 - engine is now free so we have a bunch
00:39 - new features here along with some newly
00:42 - added stuff also if you have any
00:45 - questions throughout this video as
00:46 - always we said the Brack is forum cool
00:49 - so I promise that this is going to be
00:52 - the last unity 5 porting video but I
00:56 - just wanted to show you how this is done
00:58 - for the mega game project so that
01:00 - everyone is able to follow along so when
01:03 - you've downloaded unity 5 just
01:05 - double-click it to open it up and it's
01:07 - going to prompt you to open up a project
01:09 - let's click open other let's navigate to
01:12 - wherever you have your projects stored
01:15 - and before you actually open up your
01:17 - project and convert it over I recommend
01:20 - that you find it in your finder and I'm
01:24 - going to find mine here and then just
01:27 - copy it over on the desktop just so you
01:29 - have a duplicate shoot anything with the
01:32 - process go wrong unity 5 is still very
01:34 - new and so some conversion problems may
01:37 - occur so once that is done find the
01:41 - project that you want to convert over
01:43 - hit select folder now click upgrade and
01:47 - unity is going to re-import the assets
01:51 - to the new unity 5 standards also what
01:55 - it will do is it will update the scripts
01:58 - that you've made so that they will be
02:02 - configured to the new API there's been a
02:05 - few API changes meaning changes in the
02:08 - way that we do programming in unity
02:10 - and it actually has an automatic
02:13 - converter for those to just take out the
02:17 - old bits and insert the new syntax or
02:20 - they say so we'll just say that we've
02:22 - made a backup and we would like it to do
02:24 - so you can of course say that you don't
02:28 - want that and then just change it on
02:31 - your own should this not work but for a
02:34 - similar game like ours it's pretty much
02:36 - ensured to work so once it does that
02:39 - it's going to open up a fresh scene and
02:42 - you can see that a a fresh scene in the
02:44 - new unity looks quite different from the
02:46 - old one and if we load up let's say our
02:49 - main menu some things might have changed
02:52 - a bit
02:53 - such as the skybox not working but what
02:56 - I want to do is I want to convert all of
02:59 - the materials to the cool new unity
03:02 - standard shader setup a better lighting
03:05 - system and then of course fix this
03:07 - skybox issue that's most of what we're
03:09 - going to be doing today
03:10 - so let's start out by fixing the skybox
03:13 - because that's horrible to look at so
03:16 - let's find our main camera let's find
03:20 - the skybox here let's double click it
03:23 - and you will see that it locates it in
03:26 - our project and selects it and we now
03:29 - have some more things that we can change
03:31 - with a six-sided skybox but we actually
03:35 - want to leave all these options what we
03:37 - do want to do is to click fix now and
03:41 - the reason that this error occurs is
03:44 - that this texture contains alpha but
03:47 - it's not our GBM so it means it's
03:50 - incompatible with what is called HDR
03:53 - rendering and I'm not going to go too
03:57 - much into what that actually means
04:00 - just know that HDR is awesome and that
04:03 - if you can most likely you want to use
04:07 - HDR rendering it's basically a technique
04:09 - that will make sure that you have lots
04:12 - of details detailed both in the dark
04:15 - paths and bright parts of your image
04:18 - without HDR you pretty much has to have
04:21 - to choose so let's now hit fix now
04:25 - for all of these and you can see the
04:28 - problem tada
04:30 - disappears so with that done you can of
04:33 - course do it on all of your other sky
04:34 - boxes if you want to use them also but
04:37 - with that done what we can do is we can
04:40 - create a new scene so let's save this
04:42 - one
04:42 - let's do ctrl n to create a new scene
04:47 - let's do ctrl shift s to save this scene
04:50 - let's call this main menu reported or
04:54 - modified or whatever and this is going
04:57 - to be our new main menu scene and then I
05:01 - want to open up our old man menu I want
05:03 - to select all of the stuff in here and
05:05 - copy it over we could change all of the
05:08 - different parameters individually but
05:10 - that would mean going over quite a few
05:12 - things and if you want to know how the
05:16 - new unity 5 lighting system really works
05:18 - I suggest you check out the new unity 5
05:22 - primer video that I've done I think it's
05:25 - called get up to speed with unity 5 and
05:28 - it's of course on the channel so if you
05:30 - want to really know what what is new in
05:33 - unity 5 I suggest you visit that video
05:35 - because it's simply too much to cover
05:37 - here I mean it's an hour long but I will
05:40 - show you how we can easily do this so if
05:43 - we select all of our objects
05:45 - if we then exclude our Sun because we
05:50 - want the default Sun from the other
05:52 - scene then press ctrl C to copy it then
05:55 - we move over to our new scene in menu
05:58 - port it press find our main camera here
06:01 - and delete that one and then press
06:03 - control V then you can see that now
06:06 - everything has now that now the new
06:10 - lighting system takes over here so
06:13 - that's really cool and we can just save
06:15 - that and you can leave the old main menu
06:18 - but I'm just going to delete it and open
06:21 - up the new one so you can see that
06:24 - already a quite a few things have
06:26 - changed but we can make this look much
06:29 - nicer so the first thing I want to do
06:31 - here is I want to select our directional
06:33 - light and have a look at what's changed
06:35 - in here first off you will notice
06:38 - that it has a a bit of a color here it's
06:41 - tinted a bit brow a bridge yellow which
06:43 - gives gifted this kind of a warm nice
06:47 - feel
06:47 - it also deforms to soft shadows which
06:50 - was for before a pro feature but is now
06:54 - included in unity personal Edition so
06:57 - that's really awesome and you can see
06:58 - how that looks down here we're just
07:01 - going to have it set to quality settings
07:03 - of course if you are exporting to a
07:07 - mobile game you will need to use lower
07:10 - settings and so it's fine that if it
07:13 - that they just carry over from our
07:16 - quality settings in here currently I
07:18 - have set it quite high cool so let's go
07:24 - back here where was I let's see the
07:28 - directional light here so that's pretty
07:30 - much all you need to know about that you
07:33 - can see that there are some new
07:35 - parameters here such as the bounce
07:37 - intensity this basically controls how
07:39 - much bounce light is going to be applied
07:41 - from our Sun but that's not really
07:44 - something we need to mess around with
07:45 - yet because we don't have the shaders
07:48 - applied so let's go ahead and fix the
07:51 - shaders so first thing we want to do
07:54 - here is we want to find our ball here we
07:58 - want to open up the mesh renderer go
08:00 - into materials and select the ball would
08:02 - select it in the project panel and you
08:05 - can see that it's currently using the
08:06 - legacy shader called bump diffuse this
08:09 - is pretty outdated so let's change
08:11 - change this to the standard shader you
08:14 - can see what this does it's quite a bit
08:17 - too much here but it gives it quite a
08:19 - lot of smoothness some nice rim lighting
08:22 - and a specular it almost looks like wet
08:25 - wood as is so what we need to do here is
08:29 - basically nothing nothing because the
08:31 - diffuse map carries over to the OB Doe
08:34 - and the normal map also carries over to
08:37 - the normal map slide but we can maybe
08:40 - bump down the smoothness a bit because
08:42 - that's just a bit too much so let's do
08:45 - something like 0.25 and maybe even this
08:49 - that's up to you I do like a bit of rim
08:51 - in here I think it gives a a pretty cool
08:54 - look so what we can also do is we can
08:58 - select our arm platform and we can do
09:01 - the same to that I do how we want to
09:04 - select the platform under the standard
09:07 - oops
09:08 - under the prefabs so that we can change
09:10 - it for all of them you can also just
09:13 - select this one and hit apply which
09:14 - we're going to do just make sure it
09:16 - really affects all of them all so let's
09:19 - actually we don't have a prefab fireball
09:24 - that's funny
09:25 - yeah we do it's right here but for some
09:29 - reason there is no apply button here
09:31 - maybe I already hit apply let's all we
09:35 - only change something on the material of
09:37 - course and it's going to affect all of
09:38 - the instances that's me being Seletar
09:41 - sticking or that will continue cool so
09:43 - find the ground brick legacy shader and
09:46 - again change this to the standard shader
09:48 - you can see what that does I'm just
09:51 - going to locate the material in the
09:54 - project panel so we can select that
09:56 - instead of the cube and then let's get
09:59 - rid of these colliders and you can see
10:02 - that this already looks a lot better
10:04 - what we can do is maybe bump down the
10:06 - smoothness a bit on this - you can have
10:09 - a look at what it looks like if it was a
10:10 - spherical down here so something like
10:13 - 0.2 actually let's give it a little more
10:16 - let's do is 0.25 and you can also
10:20 - control the amount of normal map the
10:25 - amount that we want our normal map to
10:27 - affect our our texture so I currently
10:31 - it's set to 1 I think this could maybe
10:33 - be bumped up to 2 so we really get this
10:37 - cool-looking 3-dimensional brick
10:40 - unfortunately we don't have any height
10:43 - map or occlusion map or anything like
10:45 - that or anything to control the the
10:49 - specularity either but I think this
10:51 - already looks a lot better than it did
10:53 - before so let's continue here I think
10:58 - that was basically all we want to do
11:00 - with these two shaders at least and you
11:04 - can just see how
11:05 - powerful the new standard shader is
11:07 - you're going to use this for 99.9% of
11:11 - all your shader work because it simply
11:13 - does so much and it's also I assure you
11:15 - very well optimized so that's really
11:18 - cool and then now let's save this what
11:22 - we also want to do is maybe change back
11:23 - our skybox you can of course keep this
11:26 - one if you think it looks cool I sure do
11:29 - but you will notice that if we in our
11:31 - scene view it shows this guy box but in
11:34 - our game view it shows another one and
11:36 - the reason for this is that on our main
11:39 - camera we currently have one skybox
11:42 - selected but we have another one as
11:44 - default and we can see this if we go in
11:47 - the window lighting and this is a really
11:50 - really important panel in here we first
11:53 - off set the default skybox and the Sun
11:56 - we can just drag in our directional
11:58 - light here as the Sun and maybe we also
12:01 - want to rename this as underscore Sun or
12:05 - just Sun that's up to you I like
12:06 - underscore Sun and I'm going to put it
12:09 - at the top with music and one thing we
12:13 - can also do is going to select the Sun
12:15 - go to the inspector and Magid s static
12:18 - we can do say the same with our platform
12:21 - here then hit apply and this means that
12:25 - whenever we change some lighting it will
12:28 - be baked onto the platform because the
12:30 - really cool thing about the new unity
12:32 - lighting system called them Lydon is
12:35 - that it will automatically know if
12:38 - something is static to bake as much
12:40 - lighting as it can onto that object so
12:43 - it will figure out the best way to get
12:45 - realistic lighting without it ever
12:48 - breaking because something has moved so
12:50 - that's really cool
12:51 - but let's go back into our lighting
12:54 - panel and in here we can of course
12:56 - change the skybox
12:57 - you will however notice that if we do
12:59 - that the lighting becomes very very
13:03 - sharp so you can keep this one and then
13:07 - just overlay the skybox on the camera
13:09 - which could look pretty good or you can
13:11 - change it to this one and then maybe
13:14 - just bring down the ambient intensity
13:16 - bring down the reflection
13:18 - intensity and you can see now it's that
13:20 - looking a bit better that's of course up
13:23 - to you what you want to do with that but
13:26 - the cool takeaway here is that as the
13:29 - ambient source of the lighting we know
13:32 - no longer just need to select the color
13:35 - but can actually get from a whole skybox
13:37 - which gets a just much more realistic
13:42 - looking result so that's something you
13:44 - can do I might actually go ahead and
13:47 - change it back to the default one I
13:48 - almost like that one better for this
13:52 - yeah I think that looks pretty good
13:54 - actually so let's let's keep that maybe
13:57 - bring down the reflection intensity just
13:58 - a bit and then we can then we can go
14:02 - back to our main camera and we can
14:05 - enable the overlay skybox there so this
14:08 - is how it's going to look and I like
14:10 - that look very much cool so the next
14:13 - thing we will do is update our level and
14:15 - we can now rename this to main menu just
14:18 - just main menu not ported and we can
14:21 - head into level one so as you can see in
14:24 - here it doesn't look as good it's kind
14:26 - of dying right now and the shaders are
14:28 - of course not really playing well
14:31 - together with the old lighting setup so
14:33 - what we want to do is again create a new
14:37 - scene let's save this as level 1 poured
14:42 - it let's head into level 1 and let's
14:48 - select everything except the Sun and
14:52 - let's just uh press oops
14:55 - let's press ctrl C to copy this head
14:58 - into level 1 pointed and press ctrl V to
15:01 - paste it all in call now let's rename
15:04 - our directional light to underscore Sun
15:07 - just to keep up with the rest of our
15:10 - project it's good to be consistent and
15:13 - just drag the GM and Sun to the top of
15:17 - the hierarchy then you can of course
15:20 - fiddle with the sun's settings if you
15:23 - want to change some of that I'm just
15:25 - going to leave it as is for now at least
15:28 - but you can see there's quite a few
15:30 - things that doesn't look
15:32 - really nice as is right now so first off
15:34 - I want to disable this coin because it's
15:36 - interfering with our lining and we want
15:39 - to see just how it looks without any
15:41 - lighting or a secondary lighting applied
15:44 - then I want to take the main camera here
15:47 - and drag it up a bit and rotate it down
15:49 - a bit just so it looks a bit more like
15:53 - when we are playing also I want to
15:56 - delete the oh that was the old camera I
15:59 - want to delete the old camera there and
16:01 - then drag up the new camera a bit to
16:05 - give it kind of more the angle that it
16:08 - actually has when we hit play so you can
16:10 - see that that looks a lot better so it
16:13 - doesn't jump awesome and now you can see
16:18 - that the shaders are already looking
16:20 - much much better here the cube power is
16:23 - very very bright and the reason why is
16:25 - it's using the old legacy shader so we
16:27 - can just quickly change that
16:29 - let's hit under the materials folder and
16:32 - we actually have an unnamed one which
16:34 - I'm going to delete here we also have
16:36 - this cube one default you can also just
16:39 - delete that let's then make a new
16:43 - material and let's just call this oops
16:46 - let's just call this um actually that's
16:50 - called this default let's drag it onto
16:53 - the cube and let's just bump down the
16:56 - albedo a bit here we can maybe also make
16:58 - it metallic if you wish or bump down or
17:02 - up the smoothness it's completely up to
17:04 - you I'm just going to make it
17:05 - nonmetallic and then a bit gray here
17:07 - just so it does it isn't as overblown
17:10 - and crazy like it was before I'm
17:13 - actually going to bump up the smoothness
17:15 - a bit so you can see what that looks
17:16 - like on a sphere down here cool so now
17:21 - that that is taking up our the intention
17:24 - of the eye
17:25 - let's adjust some of the lighting
17:28 - settings again as the skybox I'm going
17:31 - to leave the default skybox I think that
17:33 - gives a cool look then maybe bring down
17:35 - the ambient intensity just a bit and
17:37 - maybe also the reflection just a tiny
17:40 - tad actually it's mostly the reflection
17:43 - I like the ambient intense
17:45 - so let's just leave it up there and this
17:48 - is of course a lot of fiddling I have so
17:50 - you can of course spend more time on it
17:53 - than I am I just want to get along with
17:55 - the tutorial and then for the coin if we
17:57 - enable this let's first off disable the
18:01 - coin light and let's change the material
18:04 - here because that looks really really
18:07 - boring as is so let's go into the
18:09 - glowing material that's instead of the
18:12 - legacy shader actually use the standard
18:14 - shader let's change the albedo here to
18:17 - white actually I'm going to make it a
18:21 - bit darker than white so a very light
18:24 - gray then I'm going to bump up the
18:28 - metallic Ness so we get this
18:30 - cool-looking shine here and the
18:33 - smoothness about half ways so we get
18:37 - this really shiny looking thing and then
18:40 - to actually color this bright orange I'm
18:44 - going to use the emission and I'm not
18:47 - actually going to use the emission to
18:49 - emit light I'm just going to use it to
18:51 - color our surface in a way that looks
18:54 - like it's emitting light so if we set
18:57 - this to let's say one and then instead
19:00 - of this white here change it to an
19:03 - orange you can see kind of what that
19:06 - does so we get this bright looking
19:08 - yellow coin but it also has this nice
19:13 - shine to it so we can just play around
19:15 - round with that maybe darken it a bit
19:18 - maybe make it a bit more reddish and you
19:21 - can see what that does I actually think
19:23 - this looks very very cool and when we
19:26 - then turn back on the coin a light and
19:29 - maybe even color this more orange like
19:34 - this you can see that it really looks
19:36 - like an orange coin that is actually a
19:39 - meeting light or almost a gold coin here
19:41 - so I think that looks a lot better we
19:43 - have the shiny feel and the color of the
19:47 - light is is more attended towards the
19:49 - actually color of the surface I do
19:52 - however want to boost a bump down the
19:54 - intensity a bit maybe set it to one
19:55 - instead
19:57 - that looks better wait for it to bake on
19:59 - the ground objects here and yeah I'm
20:05 - actually quite satisfied with that so
20:08 - that's awesome I do how we want to
20:11 - select the coin light and make sure that
20:14 - the baking is set to real time because
20:16 - this baking effect does look really nice
20:19 - we get some nice bounce lighting and all
20:22 - that but if we kinda hit play and pick
20:26 - up the coin you can see that the light
20:29 - doesn't disappear so in order to take
20:31 - care of this instead of mixed we want to
20:34 - set this to real time only because we
20:37 - know that the coin is going to disappear
20:39 - at some point now let's hit apply and
20:42 - maybe make a coin more over here because
20:45 - I think it's a bit too boring only
20:47 - having one in the scene so let's go into
20:49 - the prefabs and drag the coin over there
20:53 - let's drag this up a bit
20:55 - something like that looks super cool and
20:58 - now let's hit play and enjoy the new
21:02 - cool-looking make a game lighting and
21:04 - shaders so that's basically how to port
21:08 - the game over to unity 5 this was pretty
21:11 - easy because everything we had to change
21:13 - was basically in the rendering
21:15 - everything else was pretty much behaving
21:18 - as we hoped it would the the script the
21:24 - script importer or API changer their
21:27 - work just as it should and we have no
21:30 - audio issues and and all that so that's
21:33 - perfect and now that we have that out of
21:35 - the way we can hopefully focus on
21:37 - improving this game so I think in the
21:39 - next video I hope in the next video that
