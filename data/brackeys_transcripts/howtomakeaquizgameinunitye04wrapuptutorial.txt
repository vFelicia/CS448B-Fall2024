00:00 - thanks for tuning in at
00:02 - braies hello everyone and welcome to the
00:04 - fourth and final video on making a quit
00:06 - game in unity so it's already come time
00:08 - to wrap up this short series it's been a
00:10 - lot of fun and I've showed you pretty
00:12 - much what I wanted uh to show you from
00:14 - the beginning however there's still lots
00:16 - of stuff you can do to improve this game
00:19 - on your own the first thing that comes
00:21 - to mind for me is maybe adding some
00:23 - audio to the game so if that's something
00:25 - you're interested in I really suggest
00:27 - you check out the 2D platform of course
00:29 - which has a cool couple of videos on
00:31 - making an audio manager and adding some
00:33 - sounds to it and making them play so uh
00:36 - if if that's something you're interested
00:37 - in interested in uh definitely check
00:40 - that out so in this video we're going to
00:42 - be uh building a cool icon for the game
00:46 - we're quickly be H going to be hopping
00:48 - into Photoshop and sketching it out
00:50 - however you can use whatever program you
00:52 - want to and then we're going to set up
00:54 - some basic player settings and I'm going
00:56 - to show you how to quickly build this as
00:58 - a stand alone for either Windows and Mac
01:01 - if you want to uh go more in depth on
01:04 - how to publish your game stuff like um
01:06 - turning it into a uh setup file that you
01:08 - will run and then it installs on the
01:10 - computer and you have the ability to
01:11 - uninstall and all that or if you want to
01:14 - publish it to the internet and maybe
01:16 - upload it and all that stuff um well
01:19 - then I really suggest you check out
01:20 - video 25 to 26 in the mega Gameco um
01:24 - where I cover a lot of that stuff I
01:26 - really also want to make some uh
01:28 - Standalone video on how to export and
01:31 - some good techniques and all that so if
01:34 - that's something you want to see
01:35 - definitely let me know in the comments
01:36 - and I'll have a look at at creating some
01:38 - very generalized uh videos on that topic
01:42 - so that would be super fun without
01:44 - further Ado let's just dig right into
01:46 - today's video so you can see that I am
01:49 - uh here on my desktop and let's just
01:51 - open up Unity uh point
01:54 - 5.3.5 which is the U version I'm going
01:57 - to be using today so I've updated it a
02:00 - bit uh since we
02:01 - started and uh the first thing that I
02:04 - want to do here is uh maybe just clean
02:06 - up our project a little bit so let's
02:09 - just right click here and go on the
02:10 - create folder and U make a folder for
02:13 - our scripts let's select the game
02:15 - manager and the question and drag them
02:16 - under there and let's also make another
02:19 - folder and this is going to be our
02:20 - Sprite folder and whoops our Sprites
02:24 - folder and this is pretty much only
02:25 - going to host our uh game Icon then we
02:29 - can go under our main uh scene here just
02:31 - to make sure that everything looks and
02:33 - place as it should and we can just hit
02:35 - play here and see that everything is
02:37 - working so that's perfect and uh the
02:40 - first thing I want to do is go under the
02:43 - edit project settings and then player
02:46 - and uh this allows us to change all kind
02:48 - of stuff uh for how we export the game
02:51 - so the first uh thing we are able to do
02:54 - is change the company name and I'm going
02:56 - to change that to breis then we can also
02:59 - set select the product name and I'm
03:01 - going to rise write quiz game example
03:04 - here uh the default icon we're going to
03:07 - be making that in a second and then you
03:09 - can see I have three different tabs here
03:11 - you might only have two you might have
03:14 - five or six it depends on how many
03:17 - modules you install when you install
03:19 - Unity so uh before Unity basically came
03:22 - with a lot of different opportunities
03:24 - for exporting your game however the new
03:26 - way they're doing is doing it is they
03:29 - have mod ized uh how exporting works so
03:32 - when you install Unity you get to choose
03:35 - what platforms you will be able to build
03:37 - for and I've chosen that I want to be
03:40 - able to build for Standalone webg web
03:43 - player and uh then of course for um uh
03:48 - under this Standalone for both PC and
03:50 - Mac uh but if you haven't chosen this
03:53 - and uh haven't checked these boxes you
03:55 - can just re run the installer and
03:58 - install them uh this time so I really
04:00 - suggest you do that those are the basic
04:02 - platforms that you almost always want to
04:05 - have so um if you don't see your tabs
04:08 - here that is why you can just R run the
04:10 - installer so next up we have the
04:12 - resolution options I don't want the
04:14 - default to be full screen instead I want
04:16 - this to have some kind of um fairly
04:19 - small window it's a very casual game
04:21 - we've made here and so I don't want to
04:23 - clutter the entire screen with it it's
04:25 - it should only take up as much space as
04:28 - necessary and then therefore I'm going
04:30 - to set the default width to something
04:31 - like
04:32 - 650 and the default screen height to
04:35 - something like 550 so it will almost be
04:38 - a square it will be a bit wider and it
04:40 - won't take up too much space then next
04:43 - up U we have the ability to display a
04:45 - resolution dialogue when we uh Run the
04:48 - game that will allow the user to change
04:50 - input choose the right resolution and
04:52 - change the quality settings of the game
04:55 - that's not something I want the user to
04:56 - decide we've decided that beforehand so
04:59 - I'm just going going to uh be disabling
05:01 - that you can also of course turn this
05:03 - into a resizable window that's probably
05:05 - going to work fine with our game because
05:06 - of the way we have set up the UI but I'm
05:09 - again not going to allow the user to do
05:11 - that then we can uh override some
05:14 - settings for the stand alone uh when it
05:16 - comes to the icon we're not going to be
05:17 - doing that we are not going to be
05:19 - changing this Splash image either or any
05:21 - of the other settings then we can move
05:23 - on to the web player under resolution
05:25 - and presentation uh you can select a
05:27 - template here and a with hide I'm just
05:30 - going to leave all of this B and the
05:32 - same with the webdl just leave all of
05:34 - these settings so uh cool now we can go
05:38 - ahead and maybe create an icon so uh I'm
05:40 - going to again be using uh Photoshop
05:43 - that is my default um uh uh image editor
05:47 - of choice however you can pretty much
05:50 - use anything a very good free
05:52 - alternative is skimp uh and that's going
05:55 - to work just fine uh and this is not a
05:57 - Photoshop tutorial this is just showing
05:59 - you uh kind of how I sketch out my icons
06:02 - and I'm also going to be making this
06:04 - available to you if you want to use this
06:06 - that's fine uh it will be uh available
06:09 - to you even though uh also for
06:11 - commercial use and all that so um first
06:13 - off let's make a new uh file by pressing
06:16 - control n or command in and this is
06:18 - going to be the uh
06:20 - quiz game Icon and I'm going to make it
06:25 - 1080 x 1080 pixels so completely square
06:28 - and let's double click on the background
06:30 - here to choose a new name for it I'm
06:32 - going to choose a BG then we can uh go
06:35 - over here under our uh shapes tool and
06:39 - uh click and hold to select the rounded
06:41 - rectangle tool and uh then we want to
06:44 - set the radius to 100 pixels then I want
06:47 - to drag from one corner to the
06:51 - other and uh what we can do is then hit
06:53 - contrl T and then we can make sure that
06:56 - this is accurate by snapping the sides
06:58 - here um to the actual sides of the
07:01 - canvas this will just make sure that we
07:03 - don't have any overlapping or missing an
07:06 - edge or something like that then we can
07:08 - disable our background and we can choose
07:10 - another color for this and I want this
07:12 - to be a very uh light red very similar
07:15 - to the one that we have chosen inside of
07:17 - unity cool then I want to uh duplicate
07:20 - this layer by pressing contrl J and then
07:23 - press contrl T to scale this hold or
07:27 - drag from the corner hold down Alt and
07:29 - shift to scale uniformly and from the
07:32 - center and uh then we can just release
07:35 - that something like that and we can now
07:36 - make this a blue color instead some kind
07:39 - of light
07:40 - blue almost watery and now you can see
07:44 - we have a border and we have some kind
07:46 - of a background image and uh to give
07:49 - this a bit more depth I'm going to add a
07:51 - shadow from the border onto the
07:53 - background but I want don't want a
07:55 - shadow around the border so what we're
07:57 - going to be doing is right or double
07:59 - clicking on uh the blue image and then
08:02 - choosing an inner Shadow and then we can
08:05 - just uh scale this up a bit and you can
08:08 - see that that gives us some nice depth
08:10 - very easily we also going to be adding
08:12 - gradient to this and I want to change
08:13 - this to Overlay so we can still see the
08:15 - blue color and then uh simply uh bump
08:19 - down the opacity a bit so it's not too
08:21 - much that looks very nice and then we
08:24 - can take our border here double click on
08:26 - that as well and maybe add a bit of a
08:28 - gradient to this as well so again I'm
08:31 - going to be changing this to Overlay
08:33 - actually let's do a soft light and uh
08:36 - bump down the opacity quite a bit on
08:38 - this one I don't want it to be too
08:40 - apparent cool so now we have uh this
08:43 - cool uh icon feel then we can add some
08:45 - kind of
08:47 - um content to this some something that
08:50 - stands out in the middle and uh here I
08:53 - want to add some kind of question mark
08:55 - uh because it is a quiz game that we are
08:57 - making and therefore I think it makes
08:59 - sense sense to make a question mark so
09:01 - uh I'm going to press T to U bring up
09:03 - our text control here and uh I don't
09:06 - want to click inside of this because you
09:07 - can see that there is a circle around my
09:10 - cursor and that means that it will
09:12 - format the text to stay inside of these
09:14 - and that's not something I want so I'm
09:16 - just going to press out here where it's
09:17 - a square I'm simply going to make a
09:20 - question mark and you can see it before
09:21 - dragging in here I'm going to move this
09:24 - on top of all of the other layers so we
09:26 - can see it clearly and you can see the
09:28 - font I'm using here is Myriad Pro and I
09:30 - want the Bold type face you can use any
09:33 - form you uh or any um font you want and
09:37 - uh then we can press contrl T scale this
09:40 - up again alt
09:41 - shift uh something like that to Center
09:44 - this we can press control and then
09:46 - select the uh rounded rectangle over
09:49 - here so that will select that area and
09:51 - then we can uh choose our question mark
09:54 - and then we can go on layer align layers
09:56 - to selection and then choose vertical
09:58 - centers and then again layer align
10:00 - layers to selection horizontal Center so
10:03 - that will Center our question mark on
10:05 - this layer and that's perfect then we
10:08 - can double click this question mark and
10:10 - let's first give it a color overlay and
10:12 - select the red color over here that's
10:14 - going to be fine then let's give it a
10:17 - shadow so a drop shadow uh widen the
10:21 - size a bit and maybe give it a bit of
10:23 - distance to offset the shadow then we
10:26 - can go under bevel and emboss and we can
10:28 - maybe drag down the shadow mode opacity
10:31 - is zero and then just bump up the size
10:33 - so that will just make light fall upon
10:36 - the um question mark to make it stand
10:38 - out a bit and we can also add a quick
10:41 - Inner Glow to make it really pop so
10:43 - we'll uh make this fairly large let's
10:46 - make it red and then a very light red
10:49 - and then maybe bump down the opacity a
10:50 - bit so if I turn that on and off you can
10:52 - see really makes the icon stand
10:55 - out good so that's pretty much all I
10:58 - wanted to do for for this icon it's not
11:00 - the prettiest in the world you can
11:01 - definitely do more and you should
11:03 - definitely spend more time than me on
11:05 - this uh but uh I think it will do for
11:08 - now so let's press contrl s to save this
11:11 - let's save it under our quiz game assets
11:13 - Sprites and I'm just going to save it as
11:16 - a Photoshop file if you're using or
11:18 - something else you should uh save it as
11:20 - a PNG file because that is pretty much l
11:23 - lless so let's save that hit okay and uh
11:27 - let's uh head back into Unity go under
11:29 - Sprites and you can see it's now
11:30 - appeared here and let's just change this
11:33 - to true color and leave everything else
11:35 - as is then hit apply and that should
11:37 - work just fine good so what we can then
11:41 - do is go under edit project settings and
11:44 - then player and we will lock the
11:46 - inspector here go back under uh the
11:49 - Sprites and drag the quiz game Icon
11:51 - under the default icon and that will now
11:54 - be used for when we export the game so
11:58 - that is something we we are now ready to
11:59 - do so let's go ahead and actually do
12:01 - that let's go on file build settings and
12:04 - you can see that I have currently uh
12:06 - selected the webgl platform however I
12:09 - want to export to the PC so in order to
12:13 - change this I need to select the PC and
12:16 - we want this Unity icon to switch over
12:18 - to the PC we do that by hitting the
12:21 - switch platform Unity will reconfigure
12:24 - the project this might take a long time
12:26 - if you have a lot of assets but if we uh
12:29 - if you don't which we don't you can see
12:31 - it's almost instant so it's switch over
12:33 - now and this button is now grayed out
12:35 - that means that unity's editor is now
12:37 - configured to work as if it was uh
12:40 - playing on a
12:42 - PC good and uh then we can choose the
12:45 - target platform form we're going to
12:47 - select uh Windows you can of course
12:49 - select Mac OSX and again if you don't
12:51 - see the Mac OSX here on the Windows
12:53 - platform rerun the installer make sure
12:55 - to choose the module good and the
12:58 - architect Ure uh 86 means 32 bit and
13:03 - 8664 means 64 bit all computers run 32
13:08 - bit some only some computers run 64
13:12 - however in modern ages if your computer
13:14 - is uh less than 5 years old there's a
13:18 - really good chance that it runs 64 bit
13:21 - however for simpar game like this the
13:24 - architecture is not going to make much
13:26 - of a difference and every run can run
13:29 - 132 so if you don't want
13:31 - to worry about this just choose 86 and
13:35 - be done with it that's fine for our case
13:37 - and that's what we're going to be uh
13:38 - doing and then before we build we want
13:41 - to make sure that the scenes in build
13:43 - include our current scene so if it's not
13:45 - there drag it in or add the open scenes
13:49 - then let's hit build let's go under quiz
13:51 - game let's add a new folder called
13:54 - builds let's double click that let's add
13:56 - another folder and we'll call this
13:58 - window Windows double click on that and
14:00 - then we can make a file name and this is
14:02 - going to be the quiz game example and
14:05 - then I'm going to just indicate that
14:07 - this is 32bit let's save that and unity
14:10 - is going to build this it's going to do
14:12 - that fairly quickly because again we
14:13 - don't have many assets and it's going to
14:15 - open up the windows folders you can see
14:17 - here on the build windows we now have
14:20 - all of this uh different content and
14:22 - this has the XE file it has some debug
14:25 - files and it has a data folder with all
14:28 - of the um resources needed by the XE
14:32 - file to run the game you need to include
14:35 - all of this stuff when you share it with
14:37 - your friends so simply take this entire
14:40 - folder and you can compress it to a sip
14:42 - file and send it over if you want to
14:44 - deploy the game I recommend creating a
14:46 - setup file that you run that installs
14:49 - all of this this on the computer and
14:51 - maybe uh adds a shortcut to the desktop
14:54 - and to the start menu and an all
14:56 - uninstall feature again if you want to
14:58 - see all of that along with exporting to
15:00 - the web check out make a game video
15:02 - number 25 and 26 on the subject so uh
15:06 - without further Ado let's try and boot
15:08 - up our new game here and see it opens up
15:11 - this window and that is actually not the
15:14 - correct resolution that is not what I
15:17 - wanted I think this is too large but
15:20 - however we can just check this out so
15:21 - you can see if I true here it is indeed
15:24 - working so let's just go ahead and find
15:26 - our edit project settings player here
15:29 - and I don't believe that this is the
15:30 - default and I think the reason why it's
15:33 - not using the uh default is uh before I
15:36 - ran the
15:37 - game uh when I was testing out with a
15:40 - different uh default screen width and
15:42 - height and I think that it's saved that
15:45 - locally but if you run this on your
15:47 - computer it should be much smaller so uh
15:50 - just keep that in mind this are only the
15:52 - default screen and width uh and they can
15:55 - be a bit annoying in Windows so that's
15:57 - that's why Windows remember that I ran
15:59 - it in that resolution and so it did that
16:02 - again you can of course refresh that uh
16:04 - there are plenty of uh stuff written
16:06 - about this on the internet so that is
16:09 - exporting your game to uh windows that
16:11 - is kind of wrapping it up and all of the
16:13 - different player settings and stuff like
16:15 - that I really hope that you enjoyed this
16:17 - series I really want to do more kind of
16:19 - smaller series to show you different
16:21 - concepts of what it's like making
16:23 - different games I think spending a lot
16:25 - of time on one series is great and I
16:28 - definitely you want to keep doing that
16:29 - as well uh but it it kind of you kind of
16:33 - get stuck on maybe uh some very specific
16:37 - uh things and and and you don't have uh
16:39 - time to cover the very wide concept of
16:41 - game development so I think uh if you
16:43 - want to see more of these short series
16:46 - definitely let me know I really want to
16:48 - make more for you so uh that's basically
16:51 - it for this video I hope you enjoyed it
16:52 - and I'll see you in some of the other
16:57 - courses
17:02 - [Music]
