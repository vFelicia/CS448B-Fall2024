00:02 - hello and welcome to the 19th video in
00:06 - our survival game series done by
00:08 - brackets I am the CEO of Brad keys and
00:11 - in this video we are going to be taking
00:13 - a look and making the respawn menu which
00:17 - is going to appear every time our player
00:19 - dies that means that we are going to be
00:21 - scripting a lot of GUI or GUI and we're
00:26 - going to be taking a look at making some
00:28 - buttons and we're also going to be
00:31 - taking a look at making it so that our
00:34 - camera will still work so we can still
00:36 - see the scene once all players dead but
00:39 - the player won't be able to move or look
00:43 - around so as always I've opened up unity
00:47 - and let's go ahead and get started so
00:50 - from the last tutorial we have the
00:53 - player stats line here
00:55 - and we are just going to open that up in
00:57 - monodevelop because we're going to use
00:59 - it very soon so double-click it to open
01:02 - it up now let's go ahead and select the
01:07 - player and hit the add component button
01:09 - and then go under a new script and let's
01:14 - call this respawn respawn menu and it's
01:22 - going to be a type JavaScript hit the
01:25 - create an ad and then double click it to
01:27 - open it up in monodevelop now let's go
01:31 - ahead and write out the script so first
01:34 - we want to create some variables the
01:37 - first one we're going to create is going
01:38 - to be called viral look around
01:43 - oops look around 0 1 and it's going to
01:49 - be a type mouse look because it's going
01:52 - to star just that the next one is going
01:55 - to be called viral look around 0 2 and
02:01 - it's also going to store a mouse look so
02:06 - these two are for saving in or starring
02:10 - the
02:11 - scripts which we will disable to make
02:14 - our play unable to look around the scene
02:17 - so if we go into unity and hit play
02:26 - he'll play and look around you can see
02:30 - that on our player is the script of
02:32 - c-sharp type called mouths look and if I
02:37 - disable this the the movement of the
02:42 - camera in the horizontal line is
02:46 - disabled so now I can only move up and
02:50 - down and that is disabled under the main
02:54 - camera where we to have the mouse script
02:56 - so if we disable that also you can see
03:00 - that now I can't look to the left and to
03:03 - the right so that's it for the scripts
03:07 - that we're going to disable to allow our
03:09 - player or to not allow our play to look
03:13 - around the scene we're going to create
03:16 - some more variables there the next one
03:19 - is going to be called char controller
03:21 - and it's going to store our character
03:23 - controller no I'm sorry charm motor and
03:27 - it's going to store our character motor
03:29 - because we want to change the speed of
03:32 - the play to cero so that he can't move
03:36 - next one is going to be called our
03:38 - sprint script and it's going to be a
03:41 - type sprint and Crouch and this is only
03:45 - needed if you have implemented the
03:47 - spending Crouch script like I am like I
03:50 - have because else this will interfere
03:53 - with us changing the speed and so we
03:56 - have to disable that script also so now
04:00 - let's go to the function start and just
04:02 - make some space for the brackets and
04:03 - let's store some information so type
04:07 - look around 0 1 equals game object
04:12 - there's a small letter in the beginning
04:15 - dot get component and this get component
04:19 - works just like get game object find in
04:23 - that it will find a compound
04:25 - for you it will find something for you
04:29 - and in this case we want to find the
04:31 - mouse look and ended up with a
04:35 - parenthesis the next one is going to be
04:37 - called look around 0 2 and it's going to
04:40 - be equal to and this time the component
04:45 - is not on the game object the script is
04:49 - attached to now this script is attached
04:53 - to the player and we want to find a
04:55 - component that is attached to the main
04:58 - camera which is a child of the player so
05:02 - you could go into scripting that find
05:05 - the child and then go on to find the
05:08 - component I'm just going to write game
05:10 - objects dot find and this time it's game
05:14 - object with capitals and then
05:16 - parentheses and type main camera make
05:22 - sure to get it all right
05:23 - that get component and then mouse look
05:27 - so we are first finding the the game
05:32 - object and then later finding the
05:34 - component that we want next up I'm going
05:38 - to type chart motor equals game objects
05:43 - that get component and then character
05:50 - controller okay to motor time awesome
05:56 - and next up we're going to type sprint
05:59 - script and game objects start get
06:07 - components you know the drill sprint and
06:12 - Crouch cool so now that we got that out
06:18 - of the way let's make sure that our main
06:20 - camera is named main camera with no
06:22 - spaces
06:24 - it is not so let's go ahead and rename
06:28 - it to main camera in one word now let's
06:32 - go back into the script and let's start
06:34 - creating some logic that actually let's
06:38 - start creating the
06:39 - menu so now I'll make some space for the
06:43 - function update too though we are not
06:45 - going to use it right now so create a
06:48 - new function called on GUI and open and
06:56 - close the brackets there and all GUI
07:00 - elements has to be created and drawn
07:03 - inside of the on GUI function so now
07:08 - let's type if player is dead because we
07:15 - only want this menu to be drawn when the
07:19 - players that actually let's wait up with
07:21 - this and just so we can be able to test
07:24 - it right now without the player being
07:26 - dead and then that's at the if statement
07:28 - little later so let's start out by
07:30 - making a button
07:32 - so type GUI dot button open parentheses
07:40 - rect open for parentheses screen dot
07:47 - width times 0.5 and this is because we
07:52 - want it to be in the center of the
07:53 - screen comma 200 because we want it to
08:00 - be 200 pixels down from the top comma
08:05 - 100 because we want it to be 100 long
08:11 - comma 40 because we want it to be 40
08:16 - pixels tall and this would work if we
08:23 - didn't factor in that again when you are
08:27 - playing around with GUI elements the
08:31 - orientation point or the pivot point or
08:34 - the center point whatever you want to
08:37 - call it it's also called an anchor point
08:39 - it's not in the center of the GUI so let
08:43 - me just quickly show you what I mean so
08:45 - we want to draw a green box this is the
08:49 - green box that we want to draw
08:52 - this could be a button this could be
08:54 - pretty much anything so we want to draw
08:58 - this button and we want it to be in the
09:01 - center of the screen then all logic
09:05 - would points that we had to do something
09:09 - like this if I could just get back my
09:11 - tools so that we would have to tell the
09:15 - computer that it should take half the
09:19 - screen width and half the screen height
09:24 - but that's just not the case because
09:28 - that is if the center point was actually
09:32 - in the century now if it we tell it to
09:35 - do this the GUI is going to do something
09:39 - like if we say that this is the center
09:43 - this right here if we just say that's
09:48 - the century for now then the GUI would
09:53 - be drawn over here and that's really not
09:59 - what we want we want it to be there
10:01 - that's because our GUI pivot point comes
10:07 - from the lower left lower left-hand of
10:12 - the of the GUI so down here is our pivot
10:17 - point and therefore everything is
10:20 - oriented through this point which also
10:24 - means that if we want it to be in the
10:26 - center of the screen we have to factor
10:28 - in half the width and half the height in
10:32 - order to get up here and then over here
10:39 - so in the center hope this made sense to
10:44 - you if not you can just go ahead and
10:46 - copy the number so type in here so the
10:49 - screen dot with x 0.5 and then we're
10:52 - going to minus it with its length so
10:56 - minus 1 minus 15 that is and then 200
11:02 - minus 20
11:05 - because half of 40 is 20 awesome now
11:10 - let's go ahead and make some text from
11:13 - the button so type a close the
11:16 - parentheses and make a comma and then
11:18 - type respawn and then close up both the
11:24 - parentheses it's actually just one now
11:32 - let's go ahead and see if this works so
11:34 - hit play and I can see we have an error
11:37 - so it the expected insert semicolon at
11:41 - end yes we need a semi code so hit play
11:46 - and you can see the respawn button being
11:50 - drawn now let's go ahead and make it so
11:54 - that something one will happen whenever
11:56 - you press this button this is done by
12:00 - making it into an if statement so at the
12:04 - beginning of this GUI dot button we're
12:06 - going to type it and then open up a
12:08 - parenthesis and then the end we are
12:10 - going to close this and then we are
12:12 - going to type the bracket key so if we
12:14 - get the GUI dot button and then all the
12:16 - properties for it then we are going to
12:19 - want to respawn our play and this is
12:23 - done in a separate function just to keep
12:25 - things organized and also so we can do
12:28 - stuff like yielding and so on so we
12:32 - could just go ahead and create this
12:34 - function so function respawn player and
12:44 - open up the bracket keys and inside of
12:47 - these we're going to type debug deadlock
12:50 - because we're not going to make the
12:52 - actual respawning in this video and then
12:55 - type respawn player and close it up
13:00 - alright so on that's going to test this
13:03 - so hit play and hit the respawn and we
13:08 - can see a debugger debug that log
13:10 - appearing in our console window saying
13:12 - that the player should respawn cool so
13:17 - let's make another
13:19 - so say if and then we can just copy the
13:23 - GUI dot button actually let's just copy
13:27 - the whole thing so let's take this and
13:30 - just hit ctrl-c and ctrl-v
13:35 - and now we have the respawn button so
13:39 - let's go ahead and change some things
13:41 - here so instead of respawn player we
13:45 - want this to be a debug lock and then
13:52 - return to menu so this button will allow
14:01 - us to return to the menu so we'll just
14:04 - call this menu and we're going to make
14:08 - it so that it's a bit further down so
14:12 - the same in the screen that with though
14:15 - we want it to be let's say 240 down and
14:24 - let's have a look there you go so we
14:29 - have the respawn and we have the menu
14:31 - and if we click respawn we get the
14:34 - respawn player and if we click menu we
14:36 - get the return to menu so this is
14:40 - working really nice now let's go ahead
14:44 - and make the variable that our that is
14:47 - going to allow us to check whether or
14:50 - not the player is dead so let's go up
14:54 - here and make some new lines and type
14:57 - static var and then call this player is
15:04 - dead and it's going to be equal to false
15:09 - by default now we can go down to the on
15:13 - UI function and type if player is 10 so
15:21 - that this will only be drawn if the
15:23 - player is dead and then make sure that
15:25 - the bracket keys holds it all in
15:31 - then this is a handy feature we can
15:33 - select all of this code inside of it and
15:35 - we can hit tab and this will
15:37 - automatically bring everything one layer
15:40 - up sweet know that now that we have that
15:45 - in place we are going to type an if
15:49 - statement in the function update also
15:51 - called if player is dead its equal to
15:59 - true oh we have to do that down here
16:02 - also so is equal to true then we want
16:08 - something to happen so if the player is
16:13 - dead then we want to disable the look at
16:17 - round at once oh look at round that
16:20 - enabled equals false look around to that
16:29 - enabled is also going to be equal to
16:33 - false the sprint script dot enabled is
16:40 - also going to be equal to false and the
16:43 - charm motor died movement
16:48 - dot max forward speed is going to equal
16:56 - be equal to zero so here we are setting
17:01 - the max speed to zero okay so we could
17:10 - go ahead and test this though we
17:12 - wouldn't get anything out of it because
17:14 - right now our players that is always
17:17 - equal to false and this is where I'll
17:20 - play your stat scripts come into play so
17:24 - here we're going to make it so that when
17:26 - the function dead is called and the
17:30 - debug led law deadlock says play your
17:33 - diet we are going to make it so that it
17:36 - will change this variable so it will
17:39 - access the respawn menu scripts from the
17:43 - players that's great
17:44 - saying that this players that should be
17:48 - equal to true so this is done by simply
17:51 - saying respawn menu that player is dead
18:03 - equal to true that's really not more
18:11 - turret so let's go ahead and see if this
18:15 - works so when we first hit play and
18:20 - select our player you can see down here
18:23 - that all of the different variables
18:26 - storing our components are working when
18:32 - we get nearer our enemy and we start to
18:35 - lose health once we get down to zero you
18:38 - can see our D line starts getting drawn
18:41 - we cannot look around and we cannot move
18:45 - either actually we can move or hmm okay
18:53 - so go ahead and hold on for a second I
18:56 - will just see if I can get this fixed
18:58 - alright so I'm back and I found out a
19:01 - way to fix this
19:03 - that is even easier than before so in
19:06 - unpacking the respawn menu script and in
19:10 - the line that says car motor that
19:12 - movement that max forward speed equals
19:15 - to zero we can just go ahead and delete
19:18 - that and instead type charm motor that
19:22 - enabled equals fault
19:24 - so just disable it completely and this
19:27 - way we don't even have to disable the
19:30 - sprint script we can just go ahead and
19:32 - delete out that but it might return an
19:36 - error whenever we pressed and press down
19:38 - the there press down some keys so I'm
19:42 - just gonna go ahead and leave it there
19:44 - just in case alright so let's go ahead
19:48 - and see if it works now so hit the play
19:50 - button and run away to our enemy
19:56 - and we can see him attacking and there
19:58 - we go we have died we cannot move and we
20:02 - cannot look around and when we hit the
20:04 - respawn and see the respawn player when
20:06 - we hit the menu you should see ya return
20:10 - to menu okay so that's pretty much it
20:13 - for this tutorial guys I hope you
20:15 - enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next
20:18 - one
20:22 - you
