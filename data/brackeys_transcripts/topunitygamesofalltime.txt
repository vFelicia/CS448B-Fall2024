00:00 - on this channel I talk a lot about
00:01 - making games but rarely about playing
00:03 - them in this video I'm gonna walk you
00:04 - through my all-time favorite games made
00:06 - with unity these are games that I
00:08 - personally really enjoyed playing and
00:10 - some of them are iconic games that I
00:12 - feel have made an impact on the games
00:13 - industry so I hope you'll enjoy my picks
00:15 - of favorite games and without further
00:17 - ado let's jump right into it now let's
00:19 - begin with inside this is a game that's
00:22 - all about atmosphere the game
00:24 - acknowledges this by putting you
00:25 - straight into the game world right as
00:27 - you open it there's no UI no tutorial a
00:30 - menu to disturb the experience the
00:32 - players presented only with the main
00:33 - character and the surrounding
00:35 - environment amazingly you're never in
00:37 - doubt what your objective is and what
00:39 - tools you have at your disposal the main
00:42 - instrument in establishing this
00:43 - atmosphere is the amazing sound design
00:46 - when playing the game the world feels
00:48 - large and abandoned most of the time the
00:50 - only sounds you hear are from the main
00:52 - character himself another game that uses
00:55 - great sound design to establish
00:57 - atmosphere is Ori and the blind forest
00:59 - however unlike inside this game benefits
01:02 - from a very clear musical soundtrack
01:03 - with lots of layers and instruments
01:08 - the environments in Ori and the blind
01:10 - forest are riddled with details and
01:13 - colors the characters are beautiful the
01:15 - levels are interesting and vibrant but
01:17 - the main strength of the game is its
01:19 - gameplay the controls are smooth and the
01:21 - mechanics of both deep and plentiful I
01:23 - feel pretty comfortable saying that Ori
01:24 - and the blind forest is the best 2d
01:26 - platformer I've ever played and speaking
01:29 - of platformers I have to mention Thomas
01:31 - was alone least back in 2012 this game
01:34 - marked one of the first great
01:35 - platformers made with unity much like
01:38 - Ori and the blind forest the game
01:39 - features both a beautiful soundtrack and
01:41 - interesting gameplay but the visual
01:44 - style of the game couldn't be more
01:45 - different it's strikingly simple one of
01:48 - the main elements of the game is the
01:50 - clever and often goofy narration the
01:52 - glowy white thing only could get to it
01:57 - which of course made it all the more
01:59 - interesting to me Thomas was alone
02:02 - stands as a symbol of how much you can
02:04 - do with something so simple another game
02:06 - that I simply love is hearthstone made
02:15 - by none other than Blissett themselves
02:17 - the game shares that certain level of
02:19 - quality and refinement that I personally
02:21 - associate with other Blizzard titles
02:23 - every time you open up hearthstone it
02:25 - offers a rich complete experience every
02:28 - animation every sound effect every
02:30 - illustration on every card is beautiful
02:32 - and when you bring all these details
02:34 - together you get a game which creates a
02:36 - wondrous and vibrant medieval setting
02:38 - the gameplay is fun and competitive in a
02:40 - direct and easy way so yeah you can
02:43 - probably tell that I'm a huge Blizzard
02:44 - fan and hearthstone did not let me down
02:48 - now let's talk about cuphead you only
02:52 - need to take one quick look at the game
02:54 - to know what makes it so unique
02:56 - inspired by cartoons from the 1930s cup
02:58 - hits art style is extremely refreshing I
03:01 - mean how can you not like this menu this
03:03 - art style mix with the run and gun
03:05 - gameplay from the 90s makes for a very
03:07 - original experience the game is also
03:09 - immensely difficult and can definitely
03:11 - be frustrating at times but I think the
03:15 - clever bus design and attention to
03:16 - detail makes it all worth it finally you
03:20 - can't talk about hot unity games without
03:22 - it getting the games key feature is the
03:28 - time moves with your player this brings
03:30 - a new dimension to the FPS genre as the
03:32 - game focuses more on dodging your
03:34 - opponent's bullets rather than spraying
03:36 - them you still need to shoot your
03:37 - enemies which can be difficult enough
03:39 - but the main challenge is to evade
03:41 - bullets coming from all angles one again
03:44 - the menu is just awesome last but not
03:46 - least I want to mention cities skylines
03:48 - oh well this game is really impressive
03:51 - just the sheer amount of content they've
03:52 - managed to put in there is amazing and
03:55 - to think they did all that with just two
03:56 - programmers I really loved how deep this
04:03 - game is you have to consider all
04:05 - possible aspects about the development
04:07 - of a city this is definitely the best
04:08 - city building game I've played today so
04:11 - that's pretty much my list of all-time
04:12 - favorite games made with unity there are
04:14 - so many great ones that it was really
04:16 - difficult to pick some to focus on
04:18 - here's some other ones I really like of
04:20 - course there are plenty of unique games
04:21 - that I haven't played yet which I'm
04:23 - really looking forward to such as Kerbal
04:25 - space program Monument Valley and
04:27 - Firewatch I hope you enjoyed this video
