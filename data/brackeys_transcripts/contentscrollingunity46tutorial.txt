00:00 - thanks for tuning in at brakus hello
00:04 - everyone and welcome to another video
00:06 - covering the all new unity GUI system
00:08 - introduced with the unity 4.6 beta it's
00:12 - still in public beta and you can
00:14 - download it from unity 3d comm for
00:17 - completely free so today we're going to
00:20 - be covering something quite cool which
00:22 - is the unity scroll rect and this
00:24 - basically allows us to fit more things
00:27 - on the screen so this is what we're
00:28 - going to be making today you can see I
00:30 - have a window with a bunch of text and
00:33 - now we can click and drag this to reveal
00:36 - more we also have a scroll bar that does
00:39 - exactly the same cool so if you have any
00:43 - questions throughout this video please
00:45 - head over to forum Bronchos comm where i
00:49 - am n hmong many other developers are
00:51 - just waiting to answer your questions or
00:54 - to give you feedback or whatever you are
00:56 - looking for it so again head over to
00:58 - forum top bracket comm for any questions
01:02 - whatsoever awesome
01:05 - so let's just get started I'm just going
01:07 - to delete the canvas here that I've made
01:10 - on the event system and we are going to
01:12 - start from fresh so to begin with let's
01:16 - right-click in the hierarchy let's head
01:18 - under UI and let's create a panel that
01:21 - is going to act as the background of our
01:23 - window so we can just head over into the
01:27 - scene view and focus on this panel that
01:29 - zoom a bit in on it and then maybe let's
01:33 - scale it down position it so it doesn't
01:37 - fit the entire screen here something
01:42 - like this looks pretty okay let's see
01:47 - how it looks in the game view pretty
01:49 - nice we can give it a bit more on the
01:51 - left side there and yeah I'm actually
01:55 - pretty satisfied with that so now let's
01:57 - go ahead and just make a quick label up
02:00 - here with the title so let's right click
02:02 - go in the UI
02:03 - let's select image this time and you
02:06 - will notice that when I right-click on
02:07 - the panel and then hit image it is
02:10 - automatically parented
02:12 - do that which is pretty cool so once
02:14 - we've created this image what we could
02:16 - go ahead and do is we could move it up
02:19 - here Center our view on it and then just
02:23 - maybe scale it down a bit to make it a
02:28 - bit smaller here just just enough room
02:33 - for a a title of some sort and the
02:37 - problem with the way we've set this up
02:39 - right now is if we go ahead and scale
02:42 - let's say the panel here you can see
02:45 - that our image doesn't correctly follow
02:49 - the border of our panel and the reason
02:53 - why is we are currently anchored to the
02:56 - center of our panel but we actually want
03:00 - to be anchored to the top of our panel
03:03 - so in order to do this we could go ahead
03:05 - and just take this flower here our
03:07 - anchor and move it up or we could use
03:10 - some of the presets over here so click
03:13 - here on the the anchor presets and then
03:17 - simply select the top one here this one
03:20 - make sure that you don't select any
03:23 - stretching or our image is going to
03:26 - stretch with our panel which is really
03:29 - not what we want we want it to be
03:31 - completely centered and only move
03:34 - position wise and not scale now we can
03:38 - go ahead and right click on our image go
03:40 - into UI and select text and let's again
03:43 - go to the anchor presets and this one we
03:46 - want to stretch on both the X and the y
03:48 - so we'll just select the one in the
03:51 - right-hand corner and you can see that
03:53 - our anchor has snapped to completely
03:55 - fill out the its parent which is the
03:59 - image and now we can simply just drag
04:02 - this over and scale it to be the size of
04:06 - our image 2 we could set this the
04:10 - numbers up here to 0 manually this is
04:13 - basically serial it's just really really
04:16 - close to that so let's select 0 here and
04:19 - that is a small error with the current
04:25 - with the current beta is that these
04:27 - values up here will not always display
04:30 - complete zero but something extremely
04:32 - close to that I mean this is basically
04:36 - as close to zero as it gets cool so now
04:40 - let's change the text to let's say
04:42 - window you can of course change it to
04:45 - whatever you like and then let's make it
04:48 - a line with the center and align with
04:52 - the middle so here it's it's centered
04:55 - and that's basically all we want to do
04:59 - for the text here you will notice in the
05:02 - game view that this might look a tiny
05:04 - bit blurred the reason why is we have to
05:06 - select our canvas and hit pixel perfect
05:09 - and now everything will look very crisp
05:11 - and sharp cool so now we are actually
05:15 - ready to create the scroll rect itself
05:18 - and in order to do this what I want to
05:20 - do is I want to create basically a
05:23 - parent for all of the text that we are
05:25 - going to be using so let's right click
05:27 - on the panel go on the UI and let's just
05:29 - create an image here because it's so
05:31 - easy to see and let's maybe make sure
05:36 - that this scale is completely with the
05:39 - panel so let's select the anchor preset
05:43 - in the bottom right corner like this and
05:46 - now we can just scale this up a bit
05:50 - something like this looks pretty good
05:52 - and then scale it on the X two and this
05:56 - is what is going to host all of our
05:59 - content for now we can go ahead and
06:00 - disable the image here and let's just
06:03 - rename this to scroll rect then we're
06:07 - going to go ahead and hit add a
06:08 - component to this called UI and then
06:11 - scroll rect and we're going to leave it
06:14 - with everything as is for now this is
06:17 - not going to work yet then we're going
06:19 - to right-click on the scroll rect itself
06:21 - hit a hit on the UI and select the text
06:25 - and let's just make this again scale
06:30 - with its parent so select the bottom
06:32 - right anchor preset now let's make sure
06:35 - that the left is
06:37 - tab is zero position Z of 0 and a right
06:41 - and bottom of zero so it's completely
06:45 - filling out its parent now we can go
06:48 - ahead and make some text for this and
06:51 - I've just gone ahead ahead and found a
06:55 - random text generator so here I'm just
06:58 - going to paste this in you can do
07:01 - whatever you want here and you can see
07:05 - that this text easily overflows the the
07:09 - scroll rect here so what we can do is we
07:11 - can simply scale this down and this
07:15 - paragraph is really long I'm just going
07:17 - to scale it to here or something and and
07:21 - now what we want to do is we want to
07:24 - tell the scroll rect that this is the
07:26 - content that we wanted to well scroll so
07:31 - let's select the scroll rect let's drag
07:34 - the text under the content and just
07:37 - release and that was basically it now
07:40 - when we hit play we can see that when we
07:43 - can drag this with our mouse and it will
07:47 - actually work now there is a problem
07:49 - with this and that is that our text is
07:52 - currently overflowing you can see that
07:55 - it's not being masked out so it's it's
07:58 - basically visible on the entire screen
08:01 - and that's really annoying so to make
08:05 - this more clear I'm just going to go
08:06 - ahead and make this text completely
08:08 - white so it's just a bit more apparent
08:10 - and then what we can do is we can select
08:13 - the scroll rect and add yet another
08:16 - component but in order for this
08:18 - component to work we're going to have to
08:21 - enable the image because we're going to
08:23 - be adding what is called a UI mask and a
08:26 - mask takes in some kind of image it
08:30 - takes a sprite that we can then mask
08:34 - with so let's hit add component you
08:38 - whoops
08:39 - you I and then mask and then we have the
08:43 - ability to simply disable the mask
08:46 - graphic so simply hit disable the show
08:49 - mask graphic
08:51 - see our text appears again it's very
08:53 - important that you use this to disable
08:55 - the image and not this up here or we're
08:58 - not even going to see our content cool
09:03 - so now when we hit play everything works
09:06 - just as expected one last final detail
09:11 - that we can add to this is a scroll bar
09:14 - and this is actually really easy all we
09:16 - have to do is right-click on the panel
09:18 - hidden under UI and select scroll bar
09:22 - and now we can go ahead and make this a
09:25 - bottom two tab so we don't scroll
09:28 - horizontally then we can maybe set the
09:31 - width to 20 and the height we're going
09:35 - to bump that up
09:36 - let's also move it over here maybe we
09:42 - can make this element snap to the right
09:45 - hand side so let's just set the anchor
09:49 - preset to the right hand side here no
09:52 - scaling or actually do we want this to
09:55 - scale yeah we can scale with this so
09:57 - let's just make it scale on the right
09:59 - and then we can just scale it up here
10:05 - manually to fit and this actually looks
10:09 - pretty good let's just move it in here
10:13 - actually I scaled it a bit too much it's
10:16 - better I think if it just fits the
10:19 - content and that's basically it so let's
10:22 - try and hit play here and indeed we have
10:27 - a scroll bar but it is actually still
10:29 - not working so what we need to do in
10:33 - order to get this to work and this is
10:35 - what I notice that most people forget is
10:37 - to go under the scroll rect and then
10:41 - drag the scroll bar under the vertical
10:44 - scroll bar make sure it's the vertical
10:47 - or it's going to behave really really so
10:49 - just drag it under there and one thing
10:52 - we can also do is disable horizontal
10:54 - movement so we make sure that this will
10:56 - only move vertically now when we hit
11:00 - play you can see that we can use the
11:03 - scroll bar to adjust what
11:05 - part of the text we we are viewing one
11:09 - thing I really like to do with scroll
11:11 - bars is I like to select it and then
11:15 - disable the background image and only
11:18 - have the handle the handle can be
11:20 - adjusted under this scroll bar sliding
11:23 - area and then handle and I also normally
11:26 - like to turn that down a bit
11:27 - so the so that the scroll bar doesn't
11:32 - take up so much of the window cool so
11:37 - that was basically it for today's video
11:40 - I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you
11:43 - in the next one
