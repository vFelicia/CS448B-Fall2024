00:00 - okay in this video I'm going to show you
00:01 - how to create a fireball magic script so
00:04 - that when you press a key it's going to
00:06 - fire these fireballs at other players in
00:08 - the game or even zombies and it will
00:12 - kill them when they get hit so let's get
00:15 - straight into the video
00:16 - okay so firstly you need to create your
00:18 - fireball so I've done this I'm gonna
00:20 - insert a sphere into the game I'm gonna
00:23 - give it a color and I'm going to call it
00:25 - fireball I'm going to set the material
00:28 - to neon and then I'm going to put in a
00:30 - fire object inside of this part so it
00:34 - catches fire I can then change the heat
00:36 - property to increase the amount of heat
00:38 - that comes out and this entire size of
00:41 - the fire objects when you've got your
00:43 - fireball then you just need to drag it
00:45 - into server storage and then you will
00:47 - leave it in there next we need to do the
00:49 - coding on the client which is where we
00:52 - will script the detection of when a key
00:55 - is pushed down and then we can fire a
00:58 - remote event to tell the server that we
01:00 - want to create a fireball so click on
01:04 - the started GUI and insert a local
01:06 - script now inside of this local script
01:09 - firstly we're getting the user input
01:12 - service and this is used to detect when
01:15 - keys are pressed so we've called a
01:17 - variable user input service and we've
01:19 - got that service then we've got two
01:21 - variables which will get the player and
01:23 - then it will get their character so if
01:26 - the character isn't already there it
01:27 - will wait for it and when it has been
01:29 - added the character variable will be set
01:31 - to their character object we've then got
01:34 - a variable to get the player's mouse
01:36 - this is so that we can set some we can
01:40 - get the position of their mouse we
01:43 - actually won't be using that though so
01:45 - I'm going to get rid of all this because
01:47 - I converted it to using the player's
01:50 - character position so we don't need this
01:52 - currently so you don't need to write out
01:54 - what you do need though is this debounce
01:57 - variable and we're going to set this
01:58 - debounce variable to false and this will
02:00 - just prevent us from firing lots of
02:03 - fireballs at once so then we're going to
02:07 - use an input began event so we're going
02:09 - to say user input service dot input
02:11 - began kernel Connect func
02:13 - and we've got two arguments here input
02:15 - and is typing so when you press a key on
02:18 - your keyboard or click or press a
02:21 - gamepad button it's going to fire this
02:24 - function whenever there's input so input
02:27 - on the keyboard or mouse or whatever
02:28 - when that begins it's gonna kick off
02:31 - this function and this code is going to
02:33 - fire and it gives us an argument which
02:35 - tells us the of input and that tells us
02:38 - the key that you pressed down and this
02:40 - second argument is true or false value
02:41 - and it tells us whether you're typing in
02:43 - the chat window because sometimes you
02:45 - don't want to fire your code if you're
02:46 - just pressing down keys in the chat
02:48 - window because you're typing to someone
02:49 - you're not pressing down to activate
02:51 - your power so simple if statement here
02:53 - if not is typing and that just basically
02:56 - means if you're not typing in the chat
02:57 - window then we're going to carry on with
02:59 - the rest of the script then this second
03:01 - if statement is the debounce so it
03:03 - checks to see if the debounce is false
03:05 - so not debounce it's the same as if
03:07 - debounce is false so if the debounce
03:09 - is false we're gonna set that debounce
03:11 - variable to be true and so that way when
03:14 - we press down the key again we're
03:16 - currently debounce is set to true so the
03:19 - not debounce condition is going to be
03:22 - false so this if statement will not run
03:24 - which means the code isn't going to be
03:26 - repeated over and over again it will
03:27 - only be repeated when the debounce is
03:29 - set to false so whilst we're now the
03:33 - debounce is true we're going to check if
03:36 - the input key code
03:38 - so when you say input key code you're
03:40 - checking the key that was pressed down
03:41 - I'm gonna say if the key code is equal
03:44 - to and then an enum so an enum is just
03:46 - like a list of of keys that you can
03:50 - choose so enum key code if we were to
03:53 - write that again an enum is kind of like
03:56 - a check
03:58 - check this way you can select a you can
04:02 - select whatever key you want to be
04:04 - pressed here it's but it's just a better
04:05 - way of putting it in and speech marks so
04:08 - we can put down Q because that's the
04:10 - less left the key that I want people to
04:12 - press down if you wanted a different key
04:15 - such as a or s or D whatever you would
04:18 - just write that key in there and there's
04:21 - also support for keys like control I
04:25 - think
04:27 - let's have a look okay well they've got
04:31 - caps lock
04:32 - remember control isn't available on Mac
04:34 - so that's probably why but there's lots
04:36 - of different keys that you can choose
04:37 - I'm gonna choose cue okay so if the key
04:40 - that's being pressed is cue then we're
04:42 - gonna fire this remote event called
04:44 - fireball so we need to insert a remote
04:46 - events into replicated storage I'm going
04:48 - to call it fireball and we're going to
04:50 - fire off that remote event
04:51 - I'm going to pick it up on the server
04:52 - and create the fireball we're then doing
04:55 - a wait a very quick wait just for the
04:57 - debounce and we can set it back to false
04:58 - now I had the debounce because
05:00 - originally I set it to two
05:02 - so you could only fire one fireball
05:03 - every two seconds but just to test it
05:05 - I'm gonna set it to naught point naught
05:06 - one so basically we can fire them as
05:08 - many times as we like now once we've got
05:10 - the code down for that local script we
05:12 - can move onto a server script so insert
05:14 - a server script into the service script
05:17 - service by clicking on the plus and
05:18 - clicking on scripts and this is where
05:21 - the magic happens
05:22 - so firstly we've created a variable for
05:25 - our fireball and this is the one that we
05:27 - just made and stored in server storage
05:29 - once you've got that and I'm using wait
05:31 - for child by the way just to make sure
05:32 - that it's fully loaded before the rest
05:34 - of the script runs then we've got an
05:36 - event for our remote events so when the
05:40 - remote event called fireball has been
05:41 - fired by the client which we do here
05:43 - when we fire off to the server we're
05:46 - going to pick up that events and we've
05:48 - got two arguments we've got we haven't
05:52 - got the C frame argument because we
05:53 - deleted that remember with all the mouse
05:55 - stuff because we don't you don't need it
05:56 - we've just got one argument for the
05:58 - player and that's automatically passed
05:59 - so we can create a variable for the
06:02 - player's character so we can just easily
06:03 - access it and we're going to create a
06:06 - clone of that fireball object so we're
06:08 - going to clone it out of the server
06:09 - storage and we're setting it as a
06:11 - variable called new firewall so that we
06:13 - can just easily access it so we've
06:15 - cloned out the new fireball and now
06:16 - we're going to set it C frame so C frame
06:18 - is kind of like its position but it also
06:20 - takes into account rotation as well so
06:23 - new fireball dot C frame and we're
06:25 - setting the C frame to be at the
06:27 - character's humanoid root part the
06:29 - humanoid root part is kind of like the
06:30 - torso
06:31 - each player has it is just a square
06:33 - block in the middle of their character
06:35 - so it's great for just positioning
06:36 - objects wherever the characters
06:39 - so we've set the new fireball C frame
06:41 - was position to the middle of their
06:44 - humanoid root part the middle of their
06:45 - character that's where it's going to
06:47 - start off wrong that's where it's going
06:48 - to fire from but we need to push it
06:50 - forward so we need to push it forwards
06:51 - at our enemy so to do that we insert a
06:54 - body velocity and what a body velocity
06:56 - does is if you set its force and then
07:00 - set its velocity velocity is the
07:02 - direction that's going to go in where
07:05 - you want it to end up basically so we
07:09 - told it what we want to end up and we've
07:11 - given it a force so it's going to push
07:12 - and the fireball at a certain force
07:16 - maximum force will be 5,000 so a number
07:19 - between zero and five thousand and
07:21 - however close it gets if it's far away
07:24 - it will speed up because it will be
07:27 - using more force and the closer it gets
07:29 - it will start slowing down to our target
07:32 - and I'll target the velocity is the
07:36 - character's humanoid root Part C frame
07:38 - which is where we started off from but
07:40 - we need the forward direction so look
07:42 - vector is the forward direction of that
07:44 - C frame position so if you think about
07:46 - our character if you think about it
07:50 - imagine that the blue arrow this this
07:55 - little dot here in fact I'm going to
07:57 - draw it for you
07:58 - this green dot is the humanoid report C
08:01 - frame that's the origin C frame when we
08:04 - say look vector we're getting the
08:05 - direction so direction in a certain
08:10 - direction okay that makes no sense but
08:13 - when we say look back - it's getting the
08:15 - four direction so it's when we times it
08:20 - by a number then it's going to be that C
08:22 - frame say like 100 studs in front in the
08:27 - same direction so the fireball is going
08:32 - to move 100 studs in this direction
08:35 - because look vector is the four
08:37 - direction of the C frame of the humanoid
08:40 - rear part so when we say humanoid report
08:44 - or C frame that's the middle of their
08:46 - character and then dot look vector is
08:48 - just the forward direction and then
08:51 - we're timesing that by a
08:52 - so this piece of code will get us a
08:55 - position a hundred studs in front of
08:58 - where the humanoid is humanoid root part
09:02 - current ears so basically a hundred
09:04 - studs in front of the player which is
09:06 - the which is where we want the fireball
09:08 - to go we want it to end up a hundred
09:10 - studs in front of the player and we want
09:13 - it to travel that distance we want to
09:15 - fire it along at a distance so that's
09:17 - what the velocity does it tells us the
09:18 - end point then the max force is a
09:20 - vector3
09:21 - made up of three values how much force
09:23 - you want to be applied on the x axis y
09:25 - axis and z axis so we want 5,000 force
09:28 - now play around with these values the
09:30 - more force you give the faster it will
09:32 - go and the bigger the direction the
09:37 - bigger the gap or the further along the
09:40 - point you can increase the point
09:41 - distance by increasing this number that
09:43 - your x by the the longer it is the
09:45 - longer the distance between the player
09:47 - and the end point the quicker is going
09:48 - to go to get to the the end so I'm going
09:51 - to keep it 250 and then we're going to
09:54 - parent it we're going to put the body
09:55 - velocity inside the new fireball so the
09:58 - body velocity will act on whatever it's
10:00 - inside so when it's inside the new
10:02 - fireball is going to start working and
10:05 - of course then we put the new fireball
10:07 - into the work space so everyone can see
10:09 - it then we're going to set up a
10:12 - connection so when so the firewall would
10:15 - work now but it just wouldn't kill
10:16 - anyone and that's what this part of the
10:18 - code does so we've set up a variable and
10:20 - we've done this because we want to
10:22 - attach our new fireball to a touched
10:27 - connection okay so and we do this
10:30 - because we want to disconnect at the end
10:31 - because we didn't disconnect it we'd
10:33 - have lots and lots and lots of events
10:35 - running at the same time and it would
10:37 - cause something called a memory leak
10:38 - because when with when we touched
10:40 - someone we've touched a a character and
10:44 - then we delete the fireball the
10:46 - connection is still with that it's still
10:47 - running it's still checking to see if
10:48 - it's been touched and let's say you run
10:50 - this 3,000 times that's 3,000
10:52 - connections that are using your
10:53 - computer's resources so we need to clear
10:56 - up so we can disconnect a connection and
10:58 - when we disconnect a connection it's no
11:00 - longer checking to see if it's been
11:01 - touched so that's the great thing about
11:03 - connections we can we can tie them to a
11:05 - variable and then we can just
11:06 - and that will save memory and prevent a
11:08 - memory leak and a memory leak is when
11:10 - you have so many connections that it's
11:12 - using that we computers resources in his
11:13 - ass to lag so that's why we're using the
11:15 - variable touch con okay
11:18 - so we set the local touch con here and
11:21 - the reason why we have to do that local
11:24 - variable above it was because when you
11:26 - define something with local here it
11:30 - becomes an unknown for the things inside
11:33 - of the of the event because you've only
11:36 - just defined it so we need to define it
11:38 - beforehand but then it's but its
11:42 - contents are going to be updated to be
11:45 - this connection because then when when
11:47 - the firewall has been touched we've got
11:49 - the hit argument so whatever touched it
11:51 - we can then check to see if it's a
11:53 - player or an NPC by saying if hit parent
11:56 - which should be the character objects if
11:57 - it contains a humanoid so we say find
12:00 - first child in case there isn't one we
12:02 - don't break the script so if there is
12:04 - then we're going to quickly check to see
12:06 - if the thing that it touched isn't our
12:08 - character because we don't want to
12:09 - immediately fire it and then
12:10 - accidentally touches us when it first
12:12 - gets set to touch our character we don't
12:15 - want it to kill us so we check to see if
12:17 - the brick that touched it if it's
12:19 - parents name so it's character's name
12:21 - isn't equal to the same name as our
12:23 - player so if it's not us then we're
12:25 - gonna break the joint of that player and
12:27 - when you call break joints on the
12:28 - player's character
12:29 - it kills the player because it separates
12:31 - all of their body parts so they're
12:33 - getting killed and then we're just
12:35 - checking to see if the touch con is
12:37 - still equal to something if it hasn't
12:39 - already been disconnected or it hasn't
12:40 - been deleted then we can disconnect it
12:42 - we're gonna disconnect that touched
12:43 - event because we've touched somebody
12:45 - we've killed them the fireball is going
12:47 - to be destroyed so we're gonna clear up
12:49 - that connection I'm going to disconnect
12:50 - it because we don't know we don't let's
12:51 - keep on checking even though there's no
12:52 - more viable so we're going to disconnect
12:54 - that connection how long we've done that
12:56 - we can destroy the new fireball and then
12:58 - after the fireball has been moving for
13:01 - two seconds we're gonna disconnect that
13:03 - connection because we want to clear it
13:05 - up now and we're going to delete the
13:06 - fireball we don't want to keep it we
13:09 - want to keep it traveling all the way
13:11 - into space if it's not touched anybody
13:13 - after two seconds so we're gonna clear
13:15 - up that connection and we're going to
13:16 - destroy it so there we go
13:18 - that should be our fireball all
13:20 - done so let's go and test it out I'm
13:23 - gonna click play now play here so I
13:25 - don't spawn into the zombies zombies are
13:27 - gonna come and get me now you can see
13:29 - there's a little bit of curve I'm not
13:31 - too sure why this is to be honest I'm
13:33 - not too sure but I think it's quite cool
13:36 - because you can turn your character and
13:37 - sometimes it's on the left side
13:39 - sometimes it's on the right side so if
13:41 - anyone wants to let me know why that
13:43 - happens in the comments then I'll be
13:45 - glad to know but I still think it's a
13:46 - cool little fireball and if I do find
13:50 - out how to do a straight one which I
13:51 - will then I'll do another video but I
13:53 - thought this is a really cool
13:54 - introduction to things like body
13:56 - velocity and other things just to make a
13:58 - quick little magic fireball because you
14:00 - can rotate your character to move it but
14:03 - if you tinker around with those max
14:05 - force values and the velocity positions
14:09 - then you can make it faster stronger you
14:12 - know really awesome so quick
14:15 - introduction there into fireballs and
14:17 - you can also make it go to wherever you
14:20 - click the mouse and that was what I was
14:22 - doing earlier so in this fire server you
14:24 - could send mouse dot hit dot P if you
14:27 - got the mouse like we did earlier so
14:29 - local mouse equals player Curran get
14:32 - mouse and then when you send mouse hit
14:34 - dot P that's the position of the mouse
14:36 - I'm gonna send mouse dot hit because
14:39 - it's originally a C frame the dot P is
14:42 - what converts it into a position
14:43 - difference between C frame and position
14:45 - is that position sorry C frame is
14:47 - position with rotation so when you say
14:49 - dot P you getting rid of that rotation
14:51 - so we're just going to take the mouse C
14:53 - frame as an extra argument and then you
14:55 - can set the velocity I think to be the C
14:58 - frame dot P because velocity is a
15:01 - position and let's see what happens now
15:03 - I'd be surprised if this works first
15:04 - time so we're going to position the
15:07 - mouse and press Q okay it doesn't work
15:10 - it does work it just goes backwards so
15:13 - oh there we go
15:15 - it does work okay it kind of works so
15:17 - there we go but yeah experiment with it
15:19 - see what you can do with it and there we
15:22 - go thank you for watching I hope this
15:23 - video was useful teaching you how to
15:25 - make a magic fireball if you have any
15:26 - other videos magic-related a lot of
15:28 - people want some magic videos let me
15:30 - know what type of magic you want to make
15:32 - and I'll try and do them so
15:34 - watching be sure to subscribe click the
15:36 - like button if you're enjoying the
15:37 - videos and you can check out the next
15:39 - video it should be on your screen now
15:41 - I'm having blocks signing off
15:43 - Cheers bye

Cleaned transcript:

okay in this video I'm going to show you how to create a fireball magic script so that when you press a key it's going to fire these fireballs at other players in the game or even zombies and it will kill them when they get hit so let's get straight into the video okay so firstly you need to create your fireball so I've done this I'm gonna insert a sphere into the game I'm gonna give it a color and I'm going to call it fireball I'm going to set the material to neon and then I'm going to put in a fire object inside of this part so it catches fire I can then change the heat property to increase the amount of heat that comes out and this entire size of the fire objects when you've got your fireball then you just need to drag it into server storage and then you will leave it in there next we need to do the coding on the client which is where we will script the detection of when a key is pushed down and then we can fire a remote event to tell the server that we want to create a fireball so click on the started GUI and insert a local script now inside of this local script firstly we're getting the user input service and this is used to detect when keys are pressed so we've called a variable user input service and we've got that service then we've got two variables which will get the player and then it will get their character so if the character isn't already there it will wait for it and when it has been added the character variable will be set to their character object we've then got a variable to get the player's mouse this is so that we can set some we can get the position of their mouse we actually won't be using that though so I'm going to get rid of all this because I converted it to using the player's character position so we don't need this currently so you don't need to write out what you do need though is this debounce variable and we're going to set this debounce variable to false and this will just prevent us from firing lots of fireballs at once so then we're going to use an input began event so we're going to say user input service dot input began kernel Connect func and we've got two arguments here input and is typing so when you press a key on your keyboard or click or press a gamepad button it's going to fire this function whenever there's input so input on the keyboard or mouse or whatever when that begins it's gonna kick off this function and this code is going to fire and it gives us an argument which tells us the of input and that tells us the key that you pressed down and this second argument is true or false value and it tells us whether you're typing in the chat window because sometimes you don't want to fire your code if you're just pressing down keys in the chat window because you're typing to someone you're not pressing down to activate your power so simple if statement here if not is typing and that just basically means if you're not typing in the chat window then we're going to carry on with the rest of the script then this second if statement is the debounce so it checks to see if the debounce is false so not debounce it's the same as if debounce is false so if the debounce is false we're gonna set that debounce variable to be true and so that way when we press down the key again we're currently debounce is set to true so the not debounce condition is going to be false so this if statement will not run which means the code isn't going to be repeated over and over again it will only be repeated when the debounce is set to false so whilst we're now the debounce is true we're going to check if the input key code so when you say input key code you're checking the key that was pressed down I'm gonna say if the key code is equal to and then an enum so an enum is just like a list of of keys that you can choose so enum key code if we were to write that again an enum is kind of like a check check this way you can select a you can select whatever key you want to be pressed here it's but it's just a better way of putting it in and speech marks so we can put down Q because that's the less left the key that I want people to press down if you wanted a different key such as a or s or D whatever you would just write that key in there and there's also support for keys like control I think let's have a look okay well they've got caps lock remember control isn't available on Mac so that's probably why but there's lots of different keys that you can choose I'm gonna choose cue okay so if the key that's being pressed is cue then we're gonna fire this remote event called fireball so we need to insert a remote events into replicated storage I'm going to call it fireball and we're going to fire off that remote event I'm going to pick it up on the server and create the fireball we're then doing a wait a very quick wait just for the debounce and we can set it back to false now I had the debounce because originally I set it to two so you could only fire one fireball every two seconds but just to test it I'm gonna set it to naught point naught one so basically we can fire them as many times as we like now once we've got the code down for that local script we can move onto a server script so insert a server script into the service script service by clicking on the plus and clicking on scripts and this is where the magic happens so firstly we've created a variable for our fireball and this is the one that we just made and stored in server storage once you've got that and I'm using wait for child by the way just to make sure that it's fully loaded before the rest of the script runs then we've got an event for our remote events so when the remote event called fireball has been fired by the client which we do here when we fire off to the server we're going to pick up that events and we've got two arguments we've got we haven't got the C frame argument because we deleted that remember with all the mouse stuff because we don't you don't need it we've just got one argument for the player and that's automatically passed so we can create a variable for the player's character so we can just easily access it and we're going to create a clone of that fireball object so we're going to clone it out of the server storage and we're setting it as a variable called new firewall so that we can just easily access it so we've cloned out the new fireball and now we're going to set it C frame so C frame is kind of like its position but it also takes into account rotation as well so new fireball dot C frame and we're setting the C frame to be at the character's humanoid root part the humanoid root part is kind of like the torso each player has it is just a square block in the middle of their character so it's great for just positioning objects wherever the characters so we've set the new fireball C frame was position to the middle of their humanoid root part the middle of their character that's where it's going to start off wrong that's where it's going to fire from but we need to push it forward so we need to push it forwards at our enemy so to do that we insert a body velocity and what a body velocity does is if you set its force and then set its velocity velocity is the direction that's going to go in where you want it to end up basically so we told it what we want to end up and we've given it a force so it's going to push and the fireball at a certain force maximum force will be 5,000 so a number between zero and five thousand and however close it gets if it's far away it will speed up because it will be using more force and the closer it gets it will start slowing down to our target and I'll target the velocity is the character's humanoid root Part C frame which is where we started off from but we need the forward direction so look vector is the forward direction of that C frame position so if you think about our character if you think about it imagine that the blue arrow this this little dot here in fact I'm going to draw it for you this green dot is the humanoid report C frame that's the origin C frame when we say look vector we're getting the direction so direction in a certain direction okay that makes no sense but when we say look back it's getting the four direction so it's when we times it by a number then it's going to be that C frame say like 100 studs in front in the same direction so the fireball is going to move 100 studs in this direction because look vector is the four direction of the C frame of the humanoid rear part so when we say humanoid report or C frame that's the middle of their character and then dot look vector is just the forward direction and then we're timesing that by a so this piece of code will get us a position a hundred studs in front of where the humanoid is humanoid root part current ears so basically a hundred studs in front of the player which is the which is where we want the fireball to go we want it to end up a hundred studs in front of the player and we want it to travel that distance we want to fire it along at a distance so that's what the velocity does it tells us the end point then the max force is a vector3 made up of three values how much force you want to be applied on the x axis y axis and z axis so we want 5,000 force now play around with these values the more force you give the faster it will go and the bigger the direction the bigger the gap or the further along the point you can increase the point distance by increasing this number that your x by the the longer it is the longer the distance between the player and the end point the quicker is going to go to get to the the end so I'm going to keep it 250 and then we're going to parent it we're going to put the body velocity inside the new fireball so the body velocity will act on whatever it's inside so when it's inside the new fireball is going to start working and of course then we put the new fireball into the work space so everyone can see it then we're going to set up a connection so when so the firewall would work now but it just wouldn't kill anyone and that's what this part of the code does so we've set up a variable and we've done this because we want to attach our new fireball to a touched connection okay so and we do this because we want to disconnect at the end because we didn't disconnect it we'd have lots and lots and lots of events running at the same time and it would cause something called a memory leak because when with when we touched someone we've touched a a character and then we delete the fireball the connection is still with that it's still running it's still checking to see if it's been touched and let's say you run this 3,000 times that's 3,000 connections that are using your computer's resources so we need to clear up so we can disconnect a connection and when we disconnect a connection it's no longer checking to see if it's been touched so that's the great thing about connections we can we can tie them to a variable and then we can just and that will save memory and prevent a memory leak and a memory leak is when you have so many connections that it's using that we computers resources in his ass to lag so that's why we're using the variable touch con okay so we set the local touch con here and the reason why we have to do that local variable above it was because when you define something with local here it becomes an unknown for the things inside of the of the event because you've only just defined it so we need to define it beforehand but then it's but its contents are going to be updated to be this connection because then when when the firewall has been touched we've got the hit argument so whatever touched it we can then check to see if it's a player or an NPC by saying if hit parent which should be the character objects if it contains a humanoid so we say find first child in case there isn't one we don't break the script so if there is then we're going to quickly check to see if the thing that it touched isn't our character because we don't want to immediately fire it and then accidentally touches us when it first gets set to touch our character we don't want it to kill us so we check to see if the brick that touched it if it's parents name so it's character's name isn't equal to the same name as our player so if it's not us then we're gonna break the joint of that player and when you call break joints on the player's character it kills the player because it separates all of their body parts so they're getting killed and then we're just checking to see if the touch con is still equal to something if it hasn't already been disconnected or it hasn't been deleted then we can disconnect it we're gonna disconnect that touched event because we've touched somebody we've killed them the fireball is going to be destroyed so we're gonna clear up that connection I'm going to disconnect it because we don't know we don't let's keep on checking even though there's no more viable so we're going to disconnect that connection how long we've done that we can destroy the new fireball and then after the fireball has been moving for two seconds we're gonna disconnect that connection because we want to clear it up now and we're going to delete the fireball we don't want to keep it we want to keep it traveling all the way into space if it's not touched anybody after two seconds so we're gonna clear up that connection and we're going to destroy it so there we go that should be our fireball all done so let's go and test it out I'm gonna click play now play here so I don't spawn into the zombies zombies are gonna come and get me now you can see there's a little bit of curve I'm not too sure why this is to be honest I'm not too sure but I think it's quite cool because you can turn your character and sometimes it's on the left side sometimes it's on the right side so if anyone wants to let me know why that happens in the comments then I'll be glad to know but I still think it's a cool little fireball and if I do find out how to do a straight one which I will then I'll do another video but I thought this is a really cool introduction to things like body velocity and other things just to make a quick little magic fireball because you can rotate your character to move it but if you tinker around with those max force values and the velocity positions then you can make it faster stronger you know really awesome so quick introduction there into fireballs and you can also make it go to wherever you click the mouse and that was what I was doing earlier so in this fire server you could send mouse dot hit dot P if you got the mouse like we did earlier so local mouse equals player Curran get mouse and then when you send mouse hit dot P that's the position of the mouse I'm gonna send mouse dot hit because it's originally a C frame the dot P is what converts it into a position difference between C frame and position is that position sorry C frame is position with rotation so when you say dot P you getting rid of that rotation so we're just going to take the mouse C frame as an extra argument and then you can set the velocity I think to be the C frame dot P because velocity is a position and let's see what happens now I'd be surprised if this works first time so we're going to position the mouse and press Q okay it doesn't work it does work it just goes backwards so oh there we go it does work okay it kind of works so there we go but yeah experiment with it see what you can do with it and there we go thank you for watching I hope this video was useful teaching you how to make a magic fireball if you have any other videos magicrelated a lot of people want some magic videos let me know what type of magic you want to make and I'll try and do them so watching be sure to subscribe click the like button if you're enjoying the videos and you can check out the next video it should be on your screen now I'm having blocks
