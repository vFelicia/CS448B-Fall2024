00:00 - how do you detect when a player dies in
00:03 - Roblox so when a player resets or when
00:06 - they get killed how do we detect that
00:08 - well firstly you'll need a player added
00:10 - event to detect when a player joins this
00:13 - is all on the server by the way however
00:15 - it should still apply to local script
00:17 - code as well then you need a character
00:19 - added event in order to get the player's
00:21 - character and when you've got the
00:23 - character you can simply say character
00:25 - added sorry you can say character.
00:28 - humanoid DOD
00:30 - colon connect
00:33 - function okay and then we can print out
00:36 - character has died and then you can
00:38 - really do whatever you like um if you
00:40 - wanted to you know reduce the player's
00:42 - points or whether you wanted to um put a
00:46 - system message out there you could do
00:48 - whatever you like really because you've
00:49 - got access to the player you've got
00:50 - access to the character so that's it
00:53 - really let's go and test it
00:55 - out we'll go and
00:58 - reset and you can see it says character
01:01 - has died and then you might want to
01:03 - check to see if they've spawned again
01:05 - and since you've got access to the
01:06 - character added you can print character
01:09 - has
01:13 - spawned one more time we'll reset and
01:17 - it's printed character has died and then
01:19 - in a moment it will print character has
01:21 - spawned now you might be wondering
01:23 - what's the point of doing this why would
01:24 - I ever want to know if a player has died
01:26 - and I wanted to give you a little
01:28 - practical example here so so we'll just
01:30 - create a simple variable for deaths now
01:33 - this isn't designed to be used in in a
01:35 - game because you'd have multiple players
01:38 - this is just assuming you have one
01:39 - player in the game so when a player dies
01:42 - you might want to increase the number of
01:43 - deaths by one
01:46 - and uh in fact what you can do is you
01:48 - can just put this variable in the player
01:49 - added like this so it applies to each
01:52 - player uh and then you could say if
01:54 - deaths is greater than or equal to let's
01:57 - say three then perhaps I want to prompt
02:00 - them to purchase more lives so I could
02:03 - say Marketplace service prompt uh
02:06 - product
02:08 - purchase you know and I could obviously
02:10 - put the the relevant information in
02:13 - there for the um for the for the
02:17 - ID uh for for the player so the game the
02:20 - game pass ID or the product ID uh which
02:22 - I don't have to hand at the moment but
02:23 - you get the idea or perhaps you might
02:25 - even want to kick them out of the game
02:28 - all right cuz you might have an OB where
02:30 - it's like you know three deaths and you
02:32 - die so we'll just say out of lives uh
02:35 - and so we'll click on play and and see
02:37 - if it works so we'll
02:39 - reset once I'll just speed this up for
02:42 - you and
02:44 - twice okay and here it comes the third
02:47 - death so uh yes it's kicked me from the
02:50 - game okay you can see the physics have
02:51 - stopped got the kick message in a normal
02:54 - server in Roblox it would flash up a
02:56 - message saying that I have indeed been
02:58 - kicked so that's how to detect if a user
03:01 - has died in Roblox let me know if it was
03:03 - useful subscribe as always and I'll see
03:05 - you in the next one
