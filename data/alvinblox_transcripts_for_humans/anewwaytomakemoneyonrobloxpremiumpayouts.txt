00:00 - hello and welcome back to another video
00:02 - just want to say sorry for the lack of
00:04 - videos recently I've been busy working
00:07 - on my game which I'm going to be
00:09 - releasing soon and also some other
00:12 - things that I have to do but I am
00:14 - returning back with a video today to
00:16 - talk to you about the new roblox feature
00:19 - which can allow you to earn more money
00:21 - from your games outside of the dev X
00:24 - program and it's called premium payouts
00:27 - so premium payouts are roblox is way of
00:31 - rewarding you for having good games okay
00:35 - so if you have a game which Premium
00:39 - roblox premium subscribers play quite
00:42 - often and they are engaging with your
00:44 - game so they're spending quite a lot of
00:46 - time in that game compared to other
00:48 - games Premium payouts are calculated
00:52 - based on other games how they score as
00:55 - well the premium playtime which you can
00:59 - see here that is your like score which
01:01 - tells roblox how good your game is at
01:04 - keeping players engaged with your game
01:07 - to keep them playing okay and the higher
01:09 - this premium playtime score then the
01:12 - higher your premium power is going to be
01:14 - and as I say this score is like compared
01:19 - to other roblox games as well so you can
01:21 - view your own premium playtime score and
01:24 - you can also see your premium payouts
01:26 - now if you don't have many players
01:29 - concurrent in your game then it's likely
01:31 - that you're not going to have much much
01:35 - of a high premium score so you're not
01:37 - going to be earning much from human
01:38 - powerhouse but if you do have a game
01:41 - that does have quite quite a few
01:43 - concurrent players consistently then
01:46 - it's something that you might want to
01:47 - check out and have a look at you or your
01:49 - score so and if we just have a look here
01:52 - to increase these payouts you can
01:55 - encourage your players to buy premium so
01:57 - roblox premium you can encourage them to
01:59 - subscribe to robots premium buy so
02:02 - adding certain things in your games so
02:04 - for example if you buy roblox premium
02:06 - then you'll get access to this map or
02:09 - this level or this sword or this item in
02:12 - my game so
02:13 - you're giving them benefits if they buy
02:15 - roblox premium now that's up to you
02:17 - whether you implement that into your
02:19 - game you don't have to but that this is
02:22 - the premium upsell model that's
02:23 - something different where you can elect
02:27 - people purchase roblox premium straight
02:30 - from your game but that's not what we're
02:32 - talking about today we're talking about
02:33 - premium payouts so let me just show you
02:36 - how you can view your premium payouts
02:39 - score so on the game's page if you just
02:42 - click on the three dots now you can only
02:43 - do this for your own games so you can't
02:45 - do it for someone else's but if you go
02:47 - to the developer stats over here and
02:49 - just wait for that to load okay so if
02:54 - you click on premium over here you can
02:56 - see that this graph will show you the
02:59 - premium play time and the premium plate
03:02 - I'm sorry the premium score and the row
03:04 - books that you've earned from that so
03:06 - it's calculated every day based off the
03:09 - amount of time that roblox premium
03:11 - subscribers spend playing your game so
03:14 - if they spend more time then you can
03:15 - earn more and free time premium placed
03:19 - on Robox earned depends on your score so
03:22 - if you have a lower score you're going
03:23 - to earn less money but this is an empty
03:26 - graph because this is a game which isn't
03:28 - public and it's not advertised or
03:31 - anything but if you do have a game which
03:33 - does have a consistent amount of players
03:35 - in it all time then you should start to
03:37 - see a score and some premium playtime
03:39 - roebucks accumulating here now I did say
03:42 - earlier it was separate to the dev X
03:44 - program now I'm pretty sure that you do
03:47 - have to still cash out the ROI books
03:50 - earn from premium payouts through dev X
03:52 - but what I meant was that it said it's a
03:54 - different way of monetizing your game
03:57 - instead of game passes and developer
04:00 - products which are the usual things
04:01 - which you would devic from there's also
04:04 - a great article on the roblox developer
04:06 - website which I'm going to link to you
04:08 - in the description basically tells you
04:10 - what you should be using the premium
04:12 - purchases for so you know don't make it
04:15 - pay to win don't give you no more
04:18 - beneficial things that can influence
04:20 - your game to premium subscribers be
04:23 - honest
04:24 - avoid paywalls etc and it also gives you
04:26 - a
04:27 - better guide and to see how your charts
04:30 - work here so I had an empty chart but
04:32 - you can see this is what it looks like
04:34 - on an average game so you've got your
04:36 - score and then you've got your euro
04:38 - books earn so it's it is likely that
04:41 - your score is going to be higher than
04:43 - the ROI books that you earn because that
04:45 - is used to determine how much row books
04:47 - you will receive for example if you had
04:50 - you know 800 K playtime robox earned
04:56 - then your score here you see there's two
04:58 - different there's two different scales
04:59 - so there you go so also there's some
05:02 - scripting guys as well on how you can
05:04 - add premium benefits in your game
05:07 - probably be covering this in a future
05:09 - video as well but go give it a read is
05:12 - very good and I'll leave a link to it in
05:13 - the description so that's all you need
05:15 - to know about the new premium payouts I
05:17 - hope it was useful and good luck using
05:20 - it in your game
