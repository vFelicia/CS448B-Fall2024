00:00 - in this video I'm going to show you how
00:02 - to add a type writer effect to a GUI
00:06 - text element so that it looks like text
00:09 - is being typed as if somebody is
00:11 - speaking it to you so it's very simple
00:13 - to do
00:14 - I've got GUI here with a text label
00:18 - which I'm going to put my text into so
00:20 - to do it in a local script of course
00:22 - because this is GUI scripting I'm going
00:25 - to just create a variable for my text
00:27 - label there we go now I've got the
00:31 - variable I'm going to create a for loop
00:35 - and one in fact we will create a
00:38 - function so local function and I'm going
00:41 - to call it type right and it's going to
00:44 - take two arguments the first argument is
00:47 - going to be the object that you want to
00:50 - apply the typewriter effect to so this
00:52 - will be the text label now obviously
00:54 - I've got the variable appear but if you
00:57 - wanted to use this function over and
01:00 - over again for different objects that's
01:01 - why we're having the argument for the
01:03 - object so you can tell the function
01:04 - which are objects or text elements you
01:08 - want the effect to appear on so we'll
01:09 - just call this one object and the second
01:12 - argument is going to be the text that
01:13 - appears so we'll just call that text so
01:15 - this will be a string and it'll be an
01:17 - object so inside our function we need to
01:21 - we're going to loop through the text so
01:24 - for every single character in the text
01:25 - we're going to update the text labels
01:28 - text property so if I just create a
01:32 - string here and let's just say that this
01:34 - is the text what I'm gonna do is I'm
01:37 - going to loop over every single
01:39 - character so we're gonna use string
01:40 - manipulation so that we can split the
01:43 - string up and every every time so for
01:46 - every single character so this string
01:50 - here has got four five six seven eight
01:53 - nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
01:56 - fifteen sixteen sixteen characters okay
01:58 - so we're gonna loop through every single
01:59 - character and the first time we go
02:02 - around we're only going to print out the
02:03 - T the second time we go around when I
02:05 - print out th the third time we're gonna
02:07 - print out th I write you get this so
02:10 - every time we loop around we're going to
02:13 - loop through
02:13 - every character in the string every time
02:15 - we loop around we're going to just set
02:17 - the text of the text label to be that's
02:21 - portion of the string and if we have a
02:24 - weight in our small weight in there of
02:27 - say naught point naught 5 seconds you it
02:30 - will look as if it's being typed so what
02:33 - we're going to do when I create a for
02:34 - loop so we're going to loop through for
02:37 - I equals well we're gonna start at 1 I'm
02:42 - gonna go to the length of the text do
02:45 - and we're going to increase by 1 so
02:48 - every single time we're just we're gonna
02:51 - do this
02:51 - 16 times because there's 4 5 8 9 10 11
02:56 - 12 13 14 15 16 characters this for loop
03:00 - is going to run any code inside of it 16
03:03 - times because we're going we're counting
03:05 - up from 1 to the length of the text in
03:08 - this case it's 16 and we're just the ie
03:12 - value is going to be the counter so it's
03:14 - going to start at 1 is going to be equal
03:16 - to 1 at the start every single time it
03:18 - goes round the for loop is going to
03:20 - increase by 1 that's the third piece of
03:23 - information that we've given the for
03:24 - loop and it's going to keep going keep
03:26 - running any code inside of the for loop
03:28 - until I is the length of text which is
03:32 - 16 so every time it goes round again
03:35 - let's just put a weight in here of
03:37 - naught point naught 5 seconds so we can
03:39 - actually see it being typed out and it
03:40 - doesn't all happen at once if we didn't
03:42 - have the weight it would just go
03:43 - straight to the end it would just print
03:44 - out it will just set the text to be the
03:47 - full string so every single time it goes
03:49 - round we need to set the objects text
03:52 - property to we're going to use string
03:56 - manipulation we're gonna use a function
03:58 - called string dot sub and what string
04:01 - dot sub it does is where you firstly
04:03 - pass the string so that will be text and
04:06 - then you tell it to numbers so number 1
04:11 - the first number is going to be the
04:13 - portion what it is basically you give it
04:16 - two numbers and it's going to be 1 it's
04:19 - the start of the string and obviously 16
04:21 - is gonna be the end of the string so you
04:23 - could say right I only want the first
04:24 - character so I'm gonna go from 1
04:27 - - one and that will give you tea if you
04:30 - said one - two it would give you th if
04:33 - he said one two three it would give you
04:35 - thi so we want to go from one to I now
04:39 - because I is the counter and every
04:40 - single time it goes round it increases
04:43 - by one obviously it starts at one so the
04:45 - first time that it goes around its going
04:47 - to set the text to be the first
04:50 - character - the first character so it's
04:52 - only gonna print out tea but then the
04:54 - second time round I increases by one so
04:57 - I is now - and because now we are
05:00 - selecting the characters from the text
05:02 - string from the first character - second
05:06 - character which is I because I is - it's
05:10 - gonna print out th waste nor point nine
05:12 - five seconds then I increases by one
05:14 - automatically so I is now three so we're
05:17 - going to get the characters from
05:18 - position 1 2 3 so 1 2 3 it's going to
05:22 - print out thr it's going to go round
05:24 - again it's going to print out th is so
05:27 - now if we just run our type write
05:30 - function on the text label and we'll
05:34 - give it some text so would you say this
05:36 - is the text once again to call our
05:38 - function and we'll just run it to make
05:40 - sure we've got no errors and what also
05:43 - do is I'll just add a weight 5 so we can
05:45 - get into the game and be all loaded and
05:47 - ready to go so in we go and obviously
05:52 - weight at the 5 seconds but you should
05:53 - start to see it writing on the screen
05:56 - there we go it says this is the text and
05:58 - we're done so what I'll do this time
06:00 - I'll just reduce that weight and we'll
06:02 - make it a longer string okay so click on
06:09 - play and this time it's just going to do
06:13 - the same thing as before but with a
06:14 - longer string and you can see that it's
06:16 - now writing out the text and you've got
06:18 - that lovely little typewriter effect
06:20 - which I spoke about at the start now you
06:22 - can change the weights in the in the
06:26 - weight here you can change the number to
06:27 - be smaller if you want it to be faster
06:30 - obvious if you wanted to type itself out
06:33 - slower just increase it so you could
06:36 - also have a length argument
06:40 - and you could put the length in here and
06:42 - then that way every single time that you
06:44 - call it you can specify your own length
06:47 - so we could do not one nor two over here
06:49 - but then if you wanted to do another
06:51 - tight right after it and change the text
06:54 - and change the speed then you could do
06:57 - you know you could do another one but
07:00 - just change the parameters down here so
07:03 - let's try this once again so the first
07:05 - one should be really quick because we
07:06 - set it to no point not to the second one
07:08 - should be a little bit slower there we
07:11 - go so you've just learnt how to create a
07:14 - typewriter effect in roblox now this is
07:17 - useful for lots of things if you're
07:19 - speaking to an npc if you're designing a
07:21 - tutorial loads of use cases and a lot of
07:23 - people think it's really hard to do but
07:25 - once you just understand that this for
07:26 - loop what we've done here is it's just a
07:29 - count we're counting from one we're
07:31 - setting our eye and value here to start
07:34 - off at one we want it to count up to the
07:36 - length of the text when you put a hash
07:38 - tag before the name of the the the
07:41 - string it gives you the length of it and
07:46 - so in I'm not sure how many characters
07:49 - there are here but when we did this is
07:51 - the text I counted up there were sixteen
07:53 - characters so it would go from 1 to 16
07:55 - increasing by one every time that's what
07:57 - the third value is and then it every
07:59 - time it goes round our of those 16 times
08:02 - it just sets the objects text to this
08:04 - string dot sub and string dot sub select
08:07 - a portion of your string so you tell it
08:09 - the first position the first character
08:12 - and the last character so if I said the
08:14 - first one and the seventh one would go
08:16 - from the first one here all the way
08:18 - along to the seventh one so one two
08:20 - three four five six seven and it would
08:22 - print out this is the next time around
08:24 - obviously it increases by one you go to
08:26 - the eighth it gets a bit longer and it
08:29 - gets a bit longer and it keeps going and
08:30 - then eventually because you keep
08:31 - repeating over and over again and you
08:33 - have that delay with the weight you get
08:35 - that really nice typewriter effect so if
08:38 - you found this video useful please do

Cleaned transcript:

in this video I'm going to show you how to add a type writer effect to a GUI text element so that it looks like text is being typed as if somebody is speaking it to you so it's very simple to do I've got GUI here with a text label which I'm going to put my text into so to do it in a local script of course because this is GUI scripting I'm going to just create a variable for my text label there we go now I've got the variable I'm going to create a for loop and one in fact we will create a function so local function and I'm going to call it type right and it's going to take two arguments the first argument is going to be the object that you want to apply the typewriter effect to so this will be the text label now obviously I've got the variable appear but if you wanted to use this function over and over again for different objects that's why we're having the argument for the object so you can tell the function which are objects or text elements you want the effect to appear on so we'll just call this one object and the second argument is going to be the text that appears so we'll just call that text so this will be a string and it'll be an object so inside our function we need to we're going to loop through the text so for every single character in the text we're going to update the text labels text property so if I just create a string here and let's just say that this is the text what I'm gonna do is I'm going to loop over every single character so we're gonna use string manipulation so that we can split the string up and every every time so for every single character so this string here has got four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen sixteen characters okay so we're gonna loop through every single character and the first time we go around we're only going to print out the T the second time we go around when I print out th the third time we're gonna print out th I write you get this so every time we loop around we're going to loop through every character in the string every time we loop around we're going to just set the text of the text label to be that's portion of the string and if we have a weight in our small weight in there of say naught point naught 5 seconds you it will look as if it's being typed so what we're going to do when I create a for loop so we're going to loop through for I equals well we're gonna start at 1 I'm gonna go to the length of the text do and we're going to increase by 1 so every single time we're just we're gonna do this 16 times because there's 4 5 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 characters this for loop is going to run any code inside of it 16 times because we're going we're counting up from 1 to the length of the text in this case it's 16 and we're just the ie value is going to be the counter so it's going to start at 1 is going to be equal to 1 at the start every single time it goes round the for loop is going to increase by 1 that's the third piece of information that we've given the for loop and it's going to keep going keep running any code inside of the for loop until I is the length of text which is 16 so every time it goes round again let's just put a weight in here of naught point naught 5 seconds so we can actually see it being typed out and it doesn't all happen at once if we didn't have the weight it would just go straight to the end it would just print out it will just set the text to be the full string so every single time it goes round we need to set the objects text property to we're going to use string manipulation we're gonna use a function called string dot sub and what string dot sub it does is where you firstly pass the string so that will be text and then you tell it to numbers so number 1 the first number is going to be the portion what it is basically you give it two numbers and it's going to be 1 it's the start of the string and obviously 16 is gonna be the end of the string so you could say right I only want the first character so I'm gonna go from 1 one and that will give you tea if you said one two it would give you th if he said one two three it would give you thi so we want to go from one to I now because I is the counter and every single time it goes round it increases by one obviously it starts at one so the first time that it goes around its going to set the text to be the first character the first character so it's only gonna print out tea but then the second time round I increases by one so I is now and because now we are selecting the characters from the text string from the first character second character which is I because I is it's gonna print out th waste nor point nine five seconds then I increases by one automatically so I is now three so we're going to get the characters from position 1 2 3 so 1 2 3 it's going to print out thr it's going to go round again it's going to print out th is so now if we just run our type write function on the text label and we'll give it some text so would you say this is the text once again to call our function and we'll just run it to make sure we've got no errors and what also do is I'll just add a weight 5 so we can get into the game and be all loaded and ready to go so in we go and obviously weight at the 5 seconds but you should start to see it writing on the screen there we go it says this is the text and we're done so what I'll do this time I'll just reduce that weight and we'll make it a longer string okay so click on play and this time it's just going to do the same thing as before but with a longer string and you can see that it's now writing out the text and you've got that lovely little typewriter effect which I spoke about at the start now you can change the weights in the in the weight here you can change the number to be smaller if you want it to be faster obvious if you wanted to type itself out slower just increase it so you could also have a length argument and you could put the length in here and then that way every single time that you call it you can specify your own length so we could do not one nor two over here but then if you wanted to do another tight right after it

the the the string it gives you the length of it and so in I'm not sure how many characters there are here but when we did this is the text I counted up there were sixteen characters so it would go from 1 to 16 increasing by one every time that's what the third value is and then it every time it goes round our of those 16 times it just sets the objects text to this string dot sub and string dot sub select a portion of your string so you tell it the first position the first character and the last character so if I said the first one and the seventh one would go from the first one here all the way along to the seventh one so one two three four five six seven and it would print out this is the next time around obviously it increases by one you go to the eighth it gets a bit longer and it gets a bit longer and it keeps going and then eventually because you keep repeating over and over again and you have that delay with the weight you get that really nice typewriter effect so if you
