00:00 - hello and welcome to the third video in
00:03 - my scripting series now in the previous
00:05 - video or videos we learned how to use
00:08 - properties and reference objects in
00:12 - roblox games but today we're going to be
00:15 - putting that to use and I'll be showing
00:17 - you how to create a dice game okay so
00:21 - we've got two dice here or die and we
00:26 - have numbered them and we're gonna use a
00:27 - script so that when we run the game we
00:30 - can roll the dice and then produce a
00:34 - result so let's get started okay so
00:37 - don't worry about anything in the output
00:39 - here it's gonna clear that and let's get
00:41 - rid of what we currently have so we're
00:45 - going to want to have two parts in the
00:47 - game for our die so we're gonna click on
00:50 - the part button and this is generated
00:53 - apart so we now need to change the
00:55 - properties of this parts to make it look
00:58 - like a dice okay so the first thing that
01:01 - we need to do is obviously make it
01:04 - bigger so we're gonna go to the size
01:06 - property and because size is made up of
01:09 - three numbers it's called a vector3
01:11 - value okay and a vector three is
01:13 - basically three numbers and each number
01:16 - represents an axis okay so the x axis
01:20 - the z axis and the y axis okay
01:23 - the you can see here on the move tool
01:25 - the red line is the x axis or the red
01:29 - arrows the blue arrows are these z axis
01:32 - and the green is the y axis which is
01:35 - going up and down and as you move the
01:37 - parts you can see they also change on
01:39 - the position property so we're just
01:41 - going to change this to 20 studs by 20
01:44 - studs by 20 studs and that's going to
01:48 - make the part nice and big you can see
01:50 - the x y&z values are now 20 and the part
01:55 - is stuck in the ground so we're just
01:56 - going to drop that above ground here so
01:58 - this is what the this is how the die
02:01 - will be shaped we now are gonna just
02:04 - make it now we're going to change the
02:06 - color for it to be completely white like
02:08 - this we'll go institutional white and
02:11 - I'll set the material to
02:13 - smooth plastic okay now we are going to
02:17 - make the brick anchored for now so that
02:21 - it stays in the air and when we won we
02:23 - were going to roll it we can an anchor
02:25 - it okay so now that we have got the the
02:28 - part we need to add some numbers on the
02:31 - on the on the faces of the die so we're
02:34 - going to enter the tool box
02:35 - and you should see this pop-up and we're
02:40 - going to click on me look what's HAP
02:41 - here where it says models I'm going to
02:43 - click on images okay and this will allow
02:45 - us to search the roblox library and we
02:48 - can take an image that someone else has
02:49 - made now if you've got an image that you
02:51 - made yourself that you want to use you
02:52 - can click on inventory and go from there
02:54 - so we've clicked on images and we're
02:56 - just going to search for dice and then
02:58 - the number that we want so one and then
03:00 - we're going to click on it on the image
03:03 - and then we can select the part that we
03:05 - want this this image to go on to so we
03:07 - just click it and that creates a decal
03:09 - alright so inside of the part you can
03:12 - see there is now a decal object which
03:15 - basically just shows the the image so
03:18 - the texture here is is the ID of that
03:20 - image so decal can be applied to a part
03:24 - to show an image and so we're going to
03:26 - do the same thing again for dice too and
03:30 - just click on the parts again on each
03:33 - face dice three we're gonna click and
03:36 - click on the next face I'm gonna do this
03:39 - for all of the whoops I'm gonna do this
03:41 - for all of the different faces so dice
03:43 - for and dice five and now we need to do
03:50 - the bottom face so I'm gonna click the
03:51 - part and just turn it over by pressing
03:55 - ctrl T a couple of times until we get
03:57 - the right face and we can put dice one
04:00 - on here okay you can also rotate the
04:02 - part using the rotate tool so now we've
04:05 - got all of the numbers on our die we can
04:08 - actually have a second one so what we
04:10 - can do is we can clone this part so to
04:14 - clone it what we're going to do is just
04:16 - right click and click on duplicate or
04:18 - you can press ctrl + D or command D if
04:21 - you're on a Mac so now that was
04:22 - duplicated it and but you can't see the
04:25 - clone because it's in
04:26 - exact same position as the of the other
04:29 - clone so we can just move away and we
04:32 - now have to die but as I said in the
04:34 - previous video about names of parts they
04:38 - both have the same name part so we need
04:41 - to name each one dice one and dice two
04:44 - like this okay so now we've got our two
04:47 - dice and we can put them in the air like
04:51 - this now just to make it a little bit
04:53 - more random what we're going to do is
04:55 - we're going to move one die underneath
04:59 - the other so that when they both come
05:01 - down the top one is going to bounce off
05:04 - the second one okay and we'll also just
05:07 - rotate them a little bit so that they
05:10 - they bounce around a bit before they hit
05:13 - the ground which just makes it feel more
05:16 - random as well so now that we've got our
05:18 - two die we can start scripting because
05:21 - they're both anchored if we run the game
05:22 - and nothing currently happens so we need
05:24 - to tell a script what we want it's
05:27 - happened with with these dies okay so
05:30 - we're gonna insert a script into the
05:31 - server script service oops I did the
05:35 - module script we just need a normal
05:36 - script so click on scripts and then
05:40 - we're going to simply reference our die
05:44 - so game dot workspace dot dice one will
05:49 - do - one first
05:50 - not anchored okay we're finding the
05:52 - property remember in the last video we
05:55 - don't have to reference the dice so the
05:57 - dice is inside of the workspace and it's
05:59 - got a property called anchored and
06:00 - anchored is it determines whether the
06:04 - part just stays in the air or whether it
06:05 - falls to the ground and we're gonna set
06:08 - an kurd to false because we want it to
06:09 - fall we want gravity to push it down
06:12 - okay so this is going to basically roll
06:15 - the first die we want to we want to wait
06:19 - for small number of time a small bit of
06:21 - time until we roll the second die okay
06:23 - and this will allow the first die to
06:25 - fall before the second so it bounces off
06:28 - of this die here okay so this is Oh
06:31 - that's died too
06:32 - let's just move that down down there so
06:35 - we want die dice one to fall first hit
06:38 - dice - which will make it
06:40 - bit more random and then that dice two
06:42 - will fall as well after that so we're
06:44 - gonna have to do a wait now wait just
06:46 - delays the script okay so if you added
06:49 - awaits here so we do wait and then we do
06:52 - a pair of brackets or parenthesis and
06:55 - then if you put a number inside of here
06:56 - so one that's gonna delay the script
06:59 - from doing anything else so if I had
07:02 - another line of code game dot workspace
07:04 - dice to that and code equals false which
07:06 - is gonna roll the second eye okay this
07:10 - is a comment by the way it's so the
07:12 - script does it the script it just
07:13 - ignores it and it's it helps you
07:15 - understand you can write notes so you so
07:17 - you know what each line does so this is
07:20 - gonna roll the first die and it's
07:22 - basically gonna is this this start it's
07:24 - gonna fall but then we're gonna wait one
07:26 - second and then after that delay we're
07:29 - going to an anchor the second dice
07:31 - so these scripts going to pause before
07:33 - execute the next line okay because you
07:35 - know that a script executes line by line
07:38 - if we have a wait it's just going to
07:40 - stop right here
07:41 - wait the amount of the specified amount
07:44 - of time inside of the brackets so in
07:45 - this case one second and after that one
07:47 - second is going to earn anchor the
07:49 - second dice okay I'm going to change
07:51 - this to half a second so naught point
07:53 - five and now if you go and try this out
07:56 - you can see the first dice is let's see
08:01 - if we can change the white here to one
08:02 - second so you can notice the the change
08:06 - so the first dice hits dice - and then
08:10 - the second ice falls as well so you see
08:12 - that that they don't both fall at the
08:15 - same time the dice - falls a second
08:20 - after the first so we have just created
08:22 - a nice little dice game there but to
08:25 - make it a little bit more interesting we
08:27 - can change the gravity property of the
08:30 - workspace now I'm if you're going to the
08:33 - workspace and have the properties window
08:34 - open I touched on this in a previous
08:37 - video the gravity problem property I
08:40 - used it as an example but if you don't
08:42 - know what gravity is it's basically a
08:43 - force which pushes down on objects
08:48 - that are in the game or say for example
08:50 - these dice in the air if gravity is is
08:53 - higher the higher gravity is so so the
08:58 - bigger the number is then the higher the
09:01 - force which is going to push down on
09:02 - these bricks and so when gravity is
09:05 - higher the bricks are going to fall much
09:08 - quicker so if I change gravity to five
09:10 - hundred one hundred and ninety six point
09:12 - two is the default if I change it to
09:14 - five hundred you can see they fall a lot
09:16 - quicker and it looks more like a pair of
09:18 - dice so I'm gonna change the weight back
09:21 - to null point five I'm also gonna move
09:23 - up this thigh a little bit and let's try
09:28 - this out again so they're both fall to
09:31 - the ground and there we go we rolled a
09:34 - four so we've just created a cool little
09:36 - dice game using what we learnt so
09:39 - hopefully that taught you something and
09:41 - it shows how you can put the things we
09:44 - learn to use it's still very very basic
09:46 - but trust me we'll do more of these cool
09:49 - projects and they'll get cool as we go
09:51 - along so just stick with it and I'll see
09:54 - you in the next one
09:55 - so if you want to go to the next video
09:56 - I'll put a thumbnail to it on your
09:58 - screen now if you want to subscribe to
10:00 - the channel so you get notified of when
10:02 - I post a new video then click the album
10:05 - blocks logo on the screen as well
10:06 - there'll be an arrow pointing to it and
10:08 - don't forget to take the quiz there'll
10:11 - be a quiz on what we've learnt so far on
10:13 - my website I'll leave a link to it in
10:14 - the description so thanks for watching
10:16 - and I'll see you in the next one

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome to the third video in my scripting series now in the previous video or videos we learned how to use properties and reference objects in roblox games but today we're going to be putting that to use and I'll be showing you how to create a dice game okay so we've got two dice here or die and we have numbered them and we're gonna use a script so that when we run the game we can roll the dice and then produce a result so let's get started okay so don't worry about anything in the output here it's gonna clear that and let's get rid of what we currently have so we're going to want to have two parts in the game for our die so we're gonna click on the part button and this is generated apart so we now need to change the properties of this parts to make it look like a dice okay so the first thing that we need to do is obviously make it bigger so we're gonna go to the size property and because size is made up of three numbers it's called a vector3 value okay and a vector three is basically three numbers and each number represents an axis okay so the x axis the z axis and the y axis okay the you can see here on the move tool the red line is the x axis or the red arrows the blue arrows are these z axis and the green is the y axis which is going up and down and as you move the parts you can see they also change on the position property so we're just going to change this to 20 studs by 20 studs by 20 studs and that's going to make the part nice and big you can see the x y&z values are now 20 and the part is stuck in the ground so we're just going to drop that above ground here so this is what the this is how the die will be shaped we now are gonna just make it now we're going to change the color for it to be completely white like this we'll go institutional white and I'll set the material to smooth plastic okay now we are going to make the brick anchored for now so that it stays in the air and when we won we were going to roll it we can an anchor it okay so now that we have got the the part we need to add some numbers on the on the on the faces of the die so we're going to enter the tool box and you should see this popup and we're going to click on me look what's HAP here where it says models I'm going to click on images okay and this will allow us to search the roblox library and we can take an image that someone else has made now if you've got an image that you made yourself that you want to use you can click on inventory and go from there so we've clicked on images and we're just going to search for dice and then the number that we want so one and then we're going to click on it on the image and then we can select the part that we want this this image to go on to so we just click it and that creates a decal alright so inside of the part you can see there is now a decal object which basically just shows the the image so the texture here is is the ID of that image so decal can be applied to a part to show an image and so we're going to do the same thing again for dice too and just click on the parts again on each face dice three we're gonna click and click on the next face I'm gonna do this for all of the whoops I'm gonna do this for all of the different faces so dice for and dice five and now we need to do the bottom face so I'm gonna click the part and just turn it over by pressing ctrl T a couple of times until we get the right face and we can put dice one on here okay you can also rotate the part using the rotate tool so now we've got all of the numbers on our die we can actually have a second one so what we can do is we can clone this part so to clone it what we're going to do is just right click and click on duplicate or you can press ctrl + D or command D if you're on a Mac so now that was duplicated it and but you can't see the clone because it's in exact same position as the of the other clone so we can just move away and we now have to die but as I said in the previous video about names of parts they both have the same name part so we need to name each one dice one and dice two like this okay so now we've got our two dice and we can put them in the air like this now just to make it a little bit more random what we're going to do is we're going to move one die underneath the other so that when they both come down the top one is going to bounce off the second one okay and we'll also just rotate them a little bit so that they they bounce around a bit before they hit the ground which just makes it feel more random as well so now that we've got our two die we can start scripting because they're both anchored if we run the game and nothing currently happens so we need to tell a script what we want it's happened with with these dies okay so we're gonna insert a script into the server script service oops I did the module script we just need a normal script so click on scripts and then we're going to simply reference our die so game dot workspace dot dice one will do one first not anchored okay we're finding the property remember in the last video we don't have to reference the dice so the dice is inside of the workspace and it's got a property called

it down okay so this is going to basically roll the first die we want to we want to wait for small number of time a small bit of time until we roll the second die okay and this will allow the first die to fall before the second so it bounces off of this die here okay so this is Oh that's died too let's just move that down down there so we want die dice one to fall first hit dice which will make it bit more random and then that dice two will fall as well after that so we're gonna have to do a wait now wait just delays the script okay so if you added awaits here so we do wait and then we do a

see they fall a lot quicker and it looks more like a pair of dice so I'm gonna change the weight back to null point five I'm also gonna move up this thigh a little bit and let's try this out again so they're both fall to the ground and there we go we rolled a four so we've just created a cool little dice game using what we learnt so hopefully that taught you something and it shows how you can put the things we learn to use it's still very very basic but trust me we'll do more of these cool projects and they'll get cool as we go along so just stick with it and I'll see you in the next one so if you want to go to the next video I'll put a thumbnail to it on your screen now if you want to subscribe to the channel so you get notified of when I post a new video then click the album blocks logo on the screen as well there'll be an arrow pointing to it and don't forget to take the quiz there'll be a quiz on what we've learnt so far on my website I'll leave a link to it in the description so thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next one
