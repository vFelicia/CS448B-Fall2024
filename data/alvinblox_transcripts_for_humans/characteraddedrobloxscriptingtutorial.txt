00:00 - okay today I'm going to show you how to
00:02 - detect when a player spawns or joins a
00:06 - game so obviously we have game. players.
00:09 - player added this event will run when a
00:11 - new player joins your game and it gives
00:13 - us a handy argument of player so
00:16 - whatever we do to the player will be
00:18 - done to a player who joins but this
00:20 - doesn't tell us when their character has
00:22 - loaded because there's two parts to when
00:24 - a player joins the game it's when their
00:26 - player first joins which usually
00:28 - contains all the information about the
00:30 - player contains their UI their backpack
00:32 - whatever but it doesn't actually contain
00:34 - their character because their character
00:36 - is a separate object in the workspace so
00:40 - if we wanted to do things such as um
00:43 - give them walks speed give them a chat
00:45 - sorry give them an overhead tag uh
00:47 - teleport them somewhere we'd have to do
00:49 - this stuff to their character which I
00:51 - like I said is in the workspace so how
00:54 - do we get their character well to get it
00:56 - we just say player doch character but
01:00 - but by the time the player joins the
01:01 - game and this function runs the
01:04 - character is likely to have not loaded
01:06 - yet so we have to wait for the character
01:09 - to load and usually when it loads um we
01:12 - can just detect it via an event called
01:14 - character added so character added
01:17 - connect function and just like player
01:19 - added it gives us a an argument for that
01:23 - character so whatever we do to this
01:25 - character argument will be done to their
01:27 - character so for example if I said
01:29 - character .h humanoid walkspeed equals
01:32 - 100 and I click on play here you will
01:35 - notice that when we join I've got 100
01:38 - speed now there's all sorts of things
01:40 - you could do here you could obviously
01:41 - give them a tag like I said um but this
01:44 - is a super simple way to get a player's
01:49 - character bear in mind though that
01:51 - sometimes when the character's added
01:53 - I've found myself that um parts of the
01:55 - character still may not be loaded so if
01:57 - you want to sometime say you wanted to
01:59 - get like the humanoid root part uh
02:01 - perhaps it's worth using a little weight
02:04 - for child there just to make sure it's
02:05 - fully loaded uh that's what I found in
02:07 - my experience
02:10 - however you've just got to make sure
02:12 - that this player added event is able to
02:15 - run when your game starts for example if
02:18 - you have this after a lengthy period of
02:21 - time such as a weight it's not the first
02:23 - thing that executes in your script well
02:25 - the event isn't going to be set up in
02:26 - time to register me joining the game
02:29 - right because we only set up the event
02:31 - after 10 seconds so it can only start
02:33 - listening for someone to join the game
02:35 - after that time so you want to make sure
02:37 - that your player added is running
02:39 - straight away and you also want to make
02:40 - sure that the player added is is pretty
02:42 - much at the top of your function here
02:44 - because again you might miss a player
02:47 - joining the game anyway that was how to
02:49 - detect when a character spawns uh let me
02:53 - know if it was useful anything else
02:54 - you'd like me to make a video on
02:56 - subscribe as always and I'll see you
02:58 - next time
