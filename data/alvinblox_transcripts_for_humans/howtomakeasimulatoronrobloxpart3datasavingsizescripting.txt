With timestamps:

00:00 - hello and welcome to part three in the
00:02 - how to make simulates game on roblox
00:04 - today we're gonna be focusing on saving
00:06 - data and making the player bigger so
00:09 - let's jump straight in with the data
00:11 - saving we're going to go into the stat
00:13 - script and I'm gonna go over this quite
00:15 - quickly I have got some other videos on
00:17 - data stores which I'll link in the
00:19 - description if you want to check those
00:20 - out so the first thing we're gonna do is
00:23 - define the datastore service okay so a
00:25 - local datastore equals a game called on
00:28 - get service and this is going to be the
00:30 - datastore service and then we're gonna
00:32 - create our datastore by saying get
00:34 - datastore and you want to give that a
00:37 - name okay so I'm gonna call it player
00:39 - save three okay completely random so
00:43 - once you've got your datastore set up
00:45 - what we can do is down here in the
00:50 - player added script we can firstly
00:53 - define our strength data and our a
00:57 - rebirth data
00:58 - okay I'm separating it with a comma
01:00 - because they are gonna mean the same
01:01 - thing now they're gonna be set to know
01:03 - at the minute because we're gonna do a P
01:05 - call function and a picot function is a
01:08 - function where if the code inside of it
01:11 - breaks then or errors it's not going to
01:14 - break the entire script it's going to be
01:15 - contained within that function okay so
01:17 - we're gonna write data from the
01:20 - datastore to these variables okay so P
01:24 - call returns whether it was a success or
01:27 - not whether the code inside it run
01:29 - without error and if there was an error
01:31 - it would return an error message okay so
01:32 - it's gonna return success and an error
01:36 - message okay there won't be an error
01:38 - message if if success is isn't true if
01:41 - success is true okay because everything
01:42 - would have gone well so that is it going
01:44 - to be equal to P call function and
01:46 - inside of here we're going to set the
01:49 - strength data and the rebirth data to
01:52 - the data from the datastore so to do
01:55 - this we're gonna say strength data
01:56 - equals a datastore data store : get a
02:01 - sync and then we're going to provide a
02:03 - key and this just uniquely identifies
02:05 - the the data in for a specific player so
02:09 - we want to get the strength data so
02:11 - we're just going to do strength and then
02:13 - a hi
02:13 - you can call it anything as long as it
02:15 - makes sense to you so strength - play
02:19 - out dot user ID okay so the unique the
02:22 - unique identifier is the player's user
02:24 - ID and then this strength string over
02:26 - here just tells us what we're saved okay
02:28 - so that's got the data for the strength
02:31 - and we can also do rebirths later and we
02:36 - can set that to datastore quorum gets a
02:38 - sync but this time instead of strength
02:40 - we're gonna say rebirths
02:42 - okay so rebirths and - and then we're
02:44 - gonna say don't play out user ID okay so
02:48 - the rebirths and the strength in the
02:50 - string tells us the data that is stored
02:52 - and then the player user ID tells us
02:54 - which player is stored for okay so now
02:57 - that we have got the data from like a
03:00 - they think we can say if success so if
03:03 - the datastore and script work to find
03:05 - that function if success then we can say
03:08 - if there is strength data so if it's not
03:11 - equal to nil which it was set to
03:13 - originally up here because there was
03:15 - nothing assigned to it so if it isn't
03:17 - then what we can do is we can say
03:20 - strength dot value which we defined up
03:23 - here the strength and number value is
03:25 - equal to strength data okay and we can
03:29 - do the same rebirths rebirths dot value
03:31 - equals rebirths data okay so that is
03:35 - getting the data now we need to work on
03:38 - saving it okay so this is very very
03:40 - simple what we're gonna do is gonna drop
03:42 - out of this player added function and
03:43 - we're gonna say game top players dot
03:47 - play out removing so this is an event
03:49 - that will fire when a player leaves the
03:51 - game curl on connect open bracket
03:53 - function and then we're going to pass
03:55 - through an argument of the player that's
03:58 - leaving okay so what we're gonna do is
04:01 - we're gonna do another peak or so local
04:03 - success comment error message a message
04:07 - equals p call function and inside of
04:11 - this p call function we're gonna just
04:13 - set a value to our datastore so
04:16 - datastore Curran set async okay and then
04:20 - we need to provide the key which we're
04:21 - going to write to and that key is going
04:23 - to be strength with a hyphen
04:25 - and then dot player thought user ID
04:28 - catenate it together as one big key and
04:31 - then we're gonna do a comma and we're
04:33 - gonna write the data which is going to
04:35 - be stored okay and this is going to be
04:37 - the path to their strength file you so
04:39 - player thought leader stats dot strength
04:41 - dot value okay because we created or up
04:44 - here and you can see it stored in the
04:45 - leaders that so we're going to this
04:47 - strength we're just getting its value
04:50 - and we're going to store it to that key
04:51 - so it's stored in the data store so now
04:53 - that we've done that we can just write
04:54 - the same line again for rebirths so data
04:57 - store color and sets a sink this time
04:59 - however the key is gonna be rebirths
05:01 - with a hyphen and then dot player dot
05:05 - user ID to make it unique for that
05:07 - player and same thing again we're gonna
05:09 - write to it the player don't need a
05:11 - stats
05:11 - dot rebirths value okay so that's just
05:14 - wrong the data in the data store to a
05:16 - players key and then up here we're
05:19 - looking up that key and we're storing
05:21 - whatever get async returns from the
05:24 - datastore in these two variables we're
05:26 - checking to see if it was a success and
05:28 - if there is some data and if there is
05:30 - then updating their strength and
05:32 - rebirths values up here to the data that
05:35 - was returned okay so that is the data
05:37 - saving we've done now we can go ahead
05:39 - and test this out so I'm gonna just go
05:41 - and publish at the game and let's go
05:44 - into into roblox now to play it so we're
05:48 - gonna just click on play and load in
05:50 - here and hopefully it should have saved
05:54 - so let's go in and see if it has and
05:57 - then once we've done this we'll move on
05:59 - quickly to making the player bigger as
06:01 - you use the tool ok so joining server
06:05 - and I've got 3,500 because that was what
06:08 - was originally stored and because I've
06:11 - been testing this out before so if I go
06:13 - ahead and get some strength
06:14 - I've got 4,500 so I'll leave the game
06:17 - and play again
06:18 - and this time we should have the same
06:20 - amount of the cache show will go ahead
06:23 - and wait for a server and if we have got
06:26 - the cache then that we great because we
06:28 - can move straight on and there we go
06:30 - we've got 4,500 strength and everything
06:33 - saved perfectly alright let's go back to
06:35 - studio then and we're gonna start
06:38 - working on
06:39 - the on making the play bigger so to do
06:42 - this it's really really simple we're
06:44 - going to do is here in the player added
06:46 - events we're just going to before the in
06:49 - fact we'll do it after the datastore so
06:53 - we're going to create an event called
06:55 - character appearance loaded and this is
06:57 - gonna run when the players character is
06:59 - fully in the game so whenever they
07:02 - respawn or when they join the game this
07:05 - is going to fire so player dot character
07:07 - appearance appearance loaded they're I'm
07:11 - gonna say : connect function character
07:15 - okay and inside of here we're going to
07:18 - make our variable for their humanoid and
07:21 - this is going to be used for setting
07:23 - their scale values for their character
07:25 - so humanoid equals character humanoid
07:29 - and then we can say humanoid call on
07:32 - wait for child body depth scale because
07:36 - there are loads of values that are
07:37 - inserted into the humanoid and it's
07:39 - basically a set of numbers and those
07:43 - values deem how big the player's
07:47 - character is okay so depth scale dock
07:49 - value and now I've just worked out a
07:51 - nice little formula to calculate the
07:54 - size based on how much strength they
07:56 - have so you can say 0.5 plus strength
08:00 - dot value over 250 I believe this is a
08:03 - decimal number which is why I'm doing
08:05 - the the division here so it's just
08:10 - taking the amount of strength they have
08:11 - so if they have say 250,000 it will
08:15 - divide it by 250 and then it will add it
08:17 - to point five because you need point
08:19 - five to begin with else you'll be really
08:21 - really small and then we're going to do
08:23 - humanoid or wait for a child waiting for
08:28 - trial and this one's going to be called
08:29 - body height scale so how tall you are
08:32 - and it's because they've all got to be
08:34 - in proportional with the other values
08:35 - then they've all got to be around the
08:38 - same else you're gonna look stretched so
08:40 - this again is going to be 0.5 plus
08:42 - strength value over 250 and let's just
08:48 - copy this line again copy it and paste
08:50 - it onto the next
08:52 - but we're gonna change it from body
08:54 - height scale to body width scale and
08:59 - that's gonna be the same and we're gonna
09:01 - do the same again this time to scale
09:04 - their head with the rest of the body so
09:05 - instead of saying body height scale
09:07 - we're gonna say head scale and give it
09:10 - the same value and lastly we're gonna
09:13 - set their walk speed so if they're
09:14 - getting bigger than they should be able
09:16 - to walk quite faster as well so humanoid
09:19 - warp speed equals 16 multiplied by
09:23 - strength strength dot value over 250 and
09:28 - you can change these values if you want
09:30 - this is just what I've come up with but
09:32 - if you find something better then feel
09:34 - free to change it however what we're
09:37 - gonna do is because this is only for the
09:39 - first time I play into the game we're
09:41 - gonna make it so that if the players
09:42 - strength changes so we can say strength
09:46 - : get property changed signal and then
09:51 - that's going to be the values if the
09:53 - value of strength changes we can connect
09:55 - it to a function and this function is
09:58 - gonna do the exact same thing okay so
10:01 - you can just take this code okay where
10:05 - it changes all of the scales and just
10:07 - paste it in here because it's only going
10:09 - to do this code once but every time that
10:12 - strength changes we need to update the
10:15 - players and scale okay so let's go and
10:19 - check this out when you go into the game
10:21 - and click on play and hopefully our
10:24 - character should size up with the tool
10:27 - so here we go and I'm quite tall all
10:31 - right it quite big because the script
10:32 - has already changed my body values but
10:36 - if we use the strength tool you can see
10:38 - that I'm growing much bigger now we do
10:41 - have a little problem here with the tool
10:42 - it doesn't seem to be increasing in size
10:46 - so I'll check that out for you and try
10:48 - and we'll try and fix that in the next
10:50 - part of the series if you want to have a
10:52 - go at fixing it yourself though you'll
10:53 - want to look into the tool mesh scale
10:56 - okay and the size of the other parts in
10:58 - the tool but it shouldn't be too bad to
10:59 - fix I'll see if I can get that fixed in
11:01 - the next part but we have added scaling
11:04 - to the character in this
11:06 - let's have a look at the play if the
11:08 - character resets does it go back to zero
11:10 - no it doesn't you keep the same size
11:13 - which is great and when you click the
11:15 - tool you gain strength as well and on
11:16 - top of that we've added data saving so
11:18 - thanks for watching this part if you
11:20 - liked it please leave a thumbs up don't
11:22 - forget to subscribe and turn on the
11:23 - notification about account already and

11:29 - top of that you get a load of extra cool

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome to part three in the how to make simulates game on roblox today we're gonna be focusing on saving data and making the player bigger so let's jump straight in with the data saving we're going to go into the stat script and I'm gonna go over this quite quickly I have got some other videos on data stores which I'll link in the description if you want to check those out so the first thing we're gonna do is define the datastore service okay so a local datastore equals a game called on get service and this is going to be the datastore service and then we're gonna create our datastore by saying get datastore and you want to give that a name okay so I'm gonna call it player save three okay completely random so once you've got your datastore set up what we can do is down here in the player added script we can firstly define our strength data and our a rebirth data okay I'm separating it with a comma because they are gonna mean the same thing now they're gonna be set to know at the minute because we're gonna do a P call function and a picot function is a function where if the code inside of it breaks then or errors it's not going to break the entire script it's going to be contained within that function okay so we're gonna write data from the datastore to these variables okay so P call returns whether it was a success or not whether the code inside it run without error and if there was an error it would return an error message okay so it's gonna return success and an error message okay there won't be an error message if if success is isn't true if success is true okay because everything would have gone well so that is it going to be equal to P call function and inside of here we're going to set the strength data and the rebirth data to the data from the datastore so to do this we're gonna say strength data equals a datastore data store get a sync and then we're going to provide a key and this just uniquely identifies the the data in for a specific player so we want to get the strength data so we're just going to do strength and then a hi you can call it anything as long as it makes sense to you so strength play out dot user ID okay so the unique the unique identifier is the player's user ID and then this strength string over here just tells us what we're saved okay so that's got the data for the strength and we can also do rebirths later and we can set that to datastore quorum gets a sync but this time instead of strength we're gonna say rebirths okay so rebirths and and then we're gonna say don't play out user ID okay so the rebirths and the strength in the string tells us the data that is stored and then the player user ID tells us which player is stored for okay so now that we have got the data from like a they think we can say if success so if the datastore and script work to find that function if success then we can say if there is strength data so if it's not equal to nil which it was set to originally up here because there was nothing assigned to it so if it isn't then what we can do is we can say strength dot value which we defined up here the strength and number value is equal to strength data okay and we can do the same rebirths rebirths dot value equals rebirths data okay so that is getting the data now we need to work on saving it okay so this is very very simple what we're gonna do is gonna drop out of this player added function and we're gonna say game top players dot play out removing so this is an event that will fire when a player leaves the game curl on connect open bracket function and then we're going to pass through an argument of the player that's leaving okay so what we're gonna do is we're gonna do another peak or so local success comment error message a message equals p call function and inside of this p call function we're gonna just set a value to our datastore so datastore Curran set async okay and then we need to provide the key which we're going to write to and that key is going to be strength with a hyphen and then dot player thought user ID catenate it together as one big key and then we're gonna do a comma and we're gonna write the data which is going to be stored okay and this is going to be the path to their strength file you so player thought leader stats dot strength dot value okay because we created or up here and you can see it stored in the leaders that so we're going to this strength we're just getting its value and we're going to store it to that key so it's stored in the data store so now that we've done that we can just write the same line again for rebirths so data store color and sets a sink this time however the key is gonna be rebirths with a hyphen and then dot player dot user ID to make it unique for that player and same thing again we're gonna write to it the player don't need a stats dot rebirths value okay so that's just wrong the data in the data store to a players key and then up here we're looking up that key and we're storing whatever get async returns from the datastore in these two variables we're checking to see if it was a success and if there is some data and if there is then updating their strength and rebirths values up here to the data that was returned okay so that is the data saving we've done now we can go ahead and test this out so I'm gonna just go and publish at the game and let's go into into roblox now to play it so we're gonna just click on play and load in here and hopefully it should have saved so let's go in and see if it has and then once we've done this we'll move on quickly to making the player bigger as you use the tool ok so joining server and I've got 3,500 because that was what was originally stored and because I've been testing this out before so if I go ahead and get some strength I've got 4,500 so I'll leave the game and play again and this time we should have the same amount of the cache show will go ahead and wait for a server and if we have got the cache then that we great because we can move straight on and there we go we've got 4,500 strength and everything saved perfectly alright let's go back to studio then and we're gonna start working on the on making the play bigger so to do this it's really really simple we're going to do is here in the player added events we're just going to before the in fact we'll do it after the datastore so we're going to create an event called character appearance loaded and this is gonna run when the players character is fully in the game so whenever they respawn or when they join the game this is going to fire so player dot character appearance appearance loaded they're I'm gonna say connect function character okay and inside of here we're going to make our variable for their humanoid and this is going to be used for setting their scale values for their character so humanoid equals character humanoid and then we can say humanoid call on wait for child body depth scale because there are loads of values that are inserted into the humanoid and it's basically a set of numbers and those values deem how big the player's character is okay so depth scale dock value and now I've just worked out a nice little formula to calculate the size based on how much strength they have so you can say 0.5 plus strength dot value over 250 I believe this is a decimal number which is why I'm doing the the division here so it's just taking the amount of strength they have so if they have say 250,000 it will divide it by 250 and then it will add it to point five because you need point five to begin with else you'll be really really small and then we're going to do humanoid or wait for a child waiting for trial and this one's going to be called body height scale so how tall you are and it's because they've all got to be in proportional with the other values then they've all got to be around the same else you're gonna look stretched so this again is going to be 0.5 plus strength value over 250 and let's just copy this line again copy it and paste it onto the next but we're gonna change it from body height scale to body width scale and that's gonna be the same and we're gonna do the same again this time to scale their head with the rest of the body so instead of saying body height scale we're gonna say head scale and give it the same value and lastly we're gonna set their walk speed so if they're getting bigger than they should be able to walk quite faster as well so humanoid warp speed equals 16 multiplied by strength strength dot value over 250 and you can change these values if you want this is just what I've come up with but if you find something better then feel free to change it however what we're gonna do is because this is only for the first time I play into the game we're gonna make it so that if the players strength changes so we can say strength get property changed signal and then that's going to be the values if the value of strength changes we can connect it to a function and this function is gonna do the exact same thing okay so you can just take this code okay where it changes all of the scales and just paste it in here because it's only going to do this code once but every time that strength changes we need to update the players and scale okay so let's go and check this out when you go into the game and click on play and hopefully our character should size up with the tool so here we go and I'm quite tall all right it quite big because the script has already changed my body values but if we use the strength tool you can see that I'm growing much bigger now we do have a little problem here with the tool it doesn't seem to be increasing in size so I'll check that out for you and try and we'll try and fix that in the next part of the series if you want to have a go at fixing it yourself though you'll want to look into the tool mesh scale okay and the size of the other parts in the tool but it shouldn't be too bad to fix I'll see if I can get that fixed in the next part but we have added scaling to the character in this let's have a look at the play if the character resets does it go back to zero no it doesn't you keep the same size which is great and when you click the tool you gain strength as well and on top of that we've added data saving so thanks for watching this part if you liked it please leave a
