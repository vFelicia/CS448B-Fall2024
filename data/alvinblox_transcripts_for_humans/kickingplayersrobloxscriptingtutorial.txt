00:01 - I'm going to show you how to kick a user
00:03 - from your Roblox game so I'm just going
00:06 - to use the player added event to get a
00:09 - player to test this on quickly uh but if
00:12 - you want to kick somebody from your game
00:13 - there's a multitude of reasons why you
00:15 - might want to do this perhaps they're
00:16 - causing trouble they're exploiting being
00:18 - a nuisance and you want to remove them
00:20 - from the server so you would just say
00:23 - player colon kick and then You' give a
00:25 - reason if you want to in strings so you
00:28 - could say you have been banned for
00:30 - whatever all right and you think that's
00:32 - it but if you kick a player usually you
00:34 - want to prevent them from joining the
00:36 - game again you for at least that server
00:38 - so we can create a list of kicked
00:40 - players by creating a table and then we
00:42 - can say table do insert kicked players
00:47 - player. name and then we can check to
00:50 - see if the player who joins is in that
00:52 - table we could say if um table. find uh
00:59 - kicked players
01:00 - and I'm going to change it from player.
01:02 - name to player. user
01:04 - ID just because I prefer that um so if
01:07 - we find them in the table then again we
01:10 - will kick the player and this will make
01:13 - sure that if somebody joins the server
01:15 - gets kicked and later tries to come back
01:19 - they won't be able to return now in your
01:24 - game you will not be kicking a player
01:26 - when they first join this part is just
01:29 - for show um to show how to kick a player
01:32 - you would have this code outside of um
01:35 - this player added event you'd have it
01:37 - somewhere else but you get the idea if
01:39 - you kick a player add them to this table
01:42 - and then you can check to see if they're
01:43 - in the table when they rejoin perhaps
01:46 - you might kick a player from another
01:48 - script and since this kicked players
01:50 - table is in this server script you won't
01:53 - be able to access it from other scripts
01:56 - in that case I recommend you set up a
01:59 - remote event or a bindable event to kick
02:02 - a player and you have the code to uh
02:05 - intercept that event in this script as
02:08 - well okay just make sure you're doing
02:10 - the necessary checks to make sure the
02:12 - player who is attempting to kick someone
02:15 - is actually an admin or someone who is
02:18 - deserving of the authority to kick
02:20 - somebody in your game otherwise uh chaos
02:23 - might ensue anyway thank you for
02:25 - watching let me know if you enjoyed the
02:26 - video subscribe as always and I'll see
02:29 - you in the next one
