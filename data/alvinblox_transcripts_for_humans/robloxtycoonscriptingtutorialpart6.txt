00:00 - okay in this part we're going to learn
00:02 - how to create buttons that can only be
00:06 - unlocked once another item is purchased
00:08 - so for example if we want the player to
00:11 - firstly buy the conveyor and then once
00:14 - they've bought the conveyor the button
00:16 - for the dropper then appears okay rather
00:18 - than every single button being visible
00:21 - when the player first joins so to do
00:25 - this uh there's a few ways and I'm sure
00:28 - there's you know per L acceptable ways
00:32 - of doing this um but the way I've
00:34 - decided to do it is for every button if
00:37 - you want it to uh then unlock some other
00:40 - buttons once you've purchased the item
00:42 - we're going to create an attribute for
00:44 - it so I'm going to create a string we're
00:46 - going to call it item
00:48 - IDs um to appear once
00:54 - bought okay and then I'm just going to
00:58 - put the IDS of the items that I want to
01:02 - um appear when they've purchased this
01:05 - item so let's say they want to unlock
01:07 - they want to make the The Dropper appear
01:09 - okay so it doesn't mean they're going to
01:10 - buy the dropper it just means the
01:11 - dropper becomes
01:13 - purchasable so that has an IDE of
01:16 - two so we're going to change the item
01:19 - IDs to appear once bought to two now we
01:24 - set this to be a string okay um we
01:27 - didn't set it to be a number so whilst
01:29 - we have a number here it's actually a
01:31 - string okay and and this is because you
01:33 - might want to have multiple item IDs
01:36 - right so let's say we wanted to have
01:38 - items 2 3 4 and five um appear once
01:41 - we've bought them we can do this because
01:43 - it's a string uh so it's essentially
01:45 - text it's not actually a number this is
01:48 - just some text uh however you can see
01:50 - the ID of item to unlock is a number if
01:53 - we try to give it multiple values it
01:55 - won't let us so um the the reason I I've
02:00 - made this a string is so that we can
02:02 - allow multiple items to then be visible
02:06 - or purchasable once this stter well this
02:09 - this conveyor has been has been uh
02:11 - unlocked and what we'll do is we'll
02:13 - write some code which will uh extract
02:16 - the numbers from this string and we can
02:18 - make them all appear so what we now want
02:22 - to do is we want to go to our code and
02:24 - when this item is unlocked we're going
02:26 - to want to um individually make the
02:29 - buttons appear so in the plot Handler
02:32 - around line 79 where we've got the
02:35 - button do touched we want to scroll down
02:38 - past the point where we know that they
02:40 - can afford the item and what we want to
02:42 - do is we then want to see if the button
02:46 - has an item IDs to appear once bought
02:49 - attribute so we can say local item IDs
02:53 - to appear once
02:56 - bought equals uh button get get
03:00 - attribute item IDs to appear once bought
03:05 - like this okay and then we can see you
03:08 - can check to see if that actually exists
03:10 - because it might not exist we might not
03:11 - have set an attribute for that button so
03:14 - if item IDs to appear once bought then
03:18 - we want to take this string and we want
03:20 - to turn it into the individual numbers
03:22 - because this is just one string right
03:24 - now we want to get these four numbers or
03:26 - however many numbers there are from this
03:29 - string so we're going to say um local
03:33 - numbers so always say local item IDs to
03:37 - uh item IDs equals uh string dot uh
03:43 - split okay and this is going to split
03:45 - the string up into pieces so we can get
03:48 - the individual numbers so item IDs to
03:51 - appear once bought that's our string and
03:53 - then we tell the game what the separator
03:55 - is and the separator is the character in
03:58 - between the numbers you in our case it's
04:00 - commas okay cuz we've got 2 comma 3
04:02 - comma 4 comma 5 so we're basically
04:04 - saying where there's a comma in this
04:06 - string split it up and so that we can
04:09 - get the individual character that's to
04:11 - the left or to the right of it in that
04:12 - case the numbers whether that's number
04:14 - two number three number four or number
04:15 - five so if we put our comma in here in
04:20 - uh in as a string by using the quote
04:22 - marks or speech marks we can then this
04:26 - will now be the table of our numbers so
04:28 - it will look something like this 2 3 4 5
04:32 - but because this is a table we can then
04:34 - get the individual numbers from it by
04:36 - indexing that table so we want to Loop
04:38 - through this table so for underscore
04:42 - comma uh Item ID in item IDs do we now
04:47 - have the individual item ID number so we
04:50 - will Loop through and we will do it for
04:52 - two three four and five so what we want
04:55 - to do is we want to firstly get the item
05:00 - uh in the template
05:02 - items uh by its ID sorry I mean get the
05:06 - button okay um so
05:10 - local uh we can just call it local
05:13 - button I am wary that we have gotten a
05:15 - variable already called button here um
05:18 - but since this is nested within our for
05:20 - Loop it will only apply to this for Loop
05:23 - so it's okay so button equals uh we want
05:27 - to find the button in the buttons folder
05:31 - here in the workspace that has the ID of
05:35 - item to
05:37 - unlock so what we're actually going to
05:39 - do is I'm going to create another
05:42 - function like we did earlier which just
05:45 - like these ones which will let us do an
05:47 - action like this without having to Nest
05:49 - that code in this for Loop here so I'm
05:52 - going to call the function get button by
05:56 - ID of item to unlock okay and I'm going
06:00 - to pass that item ID to our function and
06:03 - we will we will code the function to
06:06 - return the button object to this
06:08 - variable so let's just copy the name of
06:10 - this function and go to the top of our
06:13 - script and we're going to create a local
06:15 - function and we're going to call it the
06:18 - same get button by ID of item to unlock
06:22 - now we're also going to need to pass the
06:23 - player and the item ID so let's go back
06:26 - down and let's just pass the player as
06:31 - well to this function because this
06:33 - function is outside of our um create
06:37 - plot event which passes the player so we
06:39 - have to keep a reference to that player
06:42 - so that we can access that player from
06:43 - this function so that's why we pass it
06:45 - to this function and so what we're going
06:47 - to do is we're going to Loop through
06:49 - this player's plot so we're firstly
06:51 - going to want to get their plot so I'm
06:54 - just going to move this function below
06:56 - the get plot
06:58 - function um and then I'm going to call
07:00 - it so local plot equals get plot player
07:04 - if not plot then return end because we
07:07 - obviously don't want to carry on if
07:08 - there's no plot for some reason this is
07:10 - just like a fail
07:11 - safe now we can Loop through the buttons
07:14 - folder in that plot so for underscore
07:17 - comma button in plot. buttons colon get
07:21 - children
07:23 - do if button get attributes ID of item
07:28 - to unlock
07:30 - lock um in fact we will create a
07:33 - variable for
07:35 - this local ID of item to
07:39 - unlock if ID of item to unlock we just
07:43 - need to make sure it exists just in case
07:45 - you forgotten to set up this attribute
07:47 - it would be nil and it would then cause
07:49 - an error so um we can actually say if
07:53 - not uh ID of item to unlock then
07:57 - continue end and that will just move on
08:00 - to the next button in the loop uh by
08:04 - this point we know that the the
08:05 - attribute exists so we can say uh if
08:09 - item
08:10 - id uh is equal to ID of item to unlock
08:15 - then return button end okay and I'm
08:19 - going to actually put this onto another
08:21 - line just to make it more readable so
08:23 - this is going to return the button and
08:26 - if there is no button it won't return
08:28 - anything at all
08:29 - so we can now go back down to our
08:34 - code and uh where is it here it is so we
08:36 - now have the button but let's just make
08:39 - sure it exists so if not button then
08:42 - continue
08:44 - end and then by this point we know that
08:46 - the button exists uh we have now found
08:49 - the
08:49 - button so we want to make it visible now
08:54 - it's it's going to be visible already
08:57 - because we haven't actually written any
08:59 - code that hides it so I think we should
09:01 - do that first um so let's figure out how
09:04 - we should hide this
09:07 - button now there's two ways we can do
09:09 - this um the first method which is the
09:12 - easier method is we just add an
09:14 - attribute to every button that we want
09:18 - to only appear once another button has
09:21 - been uh touched and we can just add an
09:24 - attribute to that to say hidden and then
09:26 - when the game first loads it will hide
09:29 - all of those
09:30 - buttons the other option is we Loop
09:34 - through every single button and we see
09:38 - if it is listed in another button uh in
09:42 - the item IDs to appear once bought uh
09:46 - string however that would mean if you
09:48 - have a lot of items it's going to be
09:49 - looping over every single item and it
09:52 - might might cause some performance
09:53 - issues so that's the way I see it some
09:56 - people in the comments might have their
09:57 - own um you know view so personally what
10:02 - I'm going to do is I'm just going
10:04 - to choose the buttons I don't want to
10:07 - appear by default when the Tycoon loads
10:11 - and I'm just going to add a Ulan
10:14 - attribute okay and I'm going to call it
10:17 - hidden and I'm going to click save I'm
10:20 - going to make it
10:22 - true now some people would argue that
10:25 - having to set another attribute is just
10:28 - another thing you have to remember to do
10:30 - and that's true however I think for this
10:33 - Tycoon and for this series it's the
10:35 - simplest method of doing it so there's
10:37 - no right or wrong answer this will work
10:40 - either way I just wanted to explain
10:42 - myself so what we can now do now that
10:45 - we've set up this hidden attribute in
10:47 - the button is when we load in our
10:50 - buttons in the plot Handler around line
10:53 - 86 we want to firstly check to see if
10:59 - this is hidden so we can say if button
11:02 - get attribute
11:05 - hidden
11:06 - then uh we want to hide the button so
11:09 - button.
11:11 - transparency equals 1 and we also don't
11:14 - want it to um unlock the item when you
11:17 - touch it because you can still obviously
11:19 - touch it when it is hidden so firstly
11:21 - we're going to say button. canide equals
11:23 - false and then in the button. touched
11:25 - event we want to say if button get
11:29 - attribute
11:31 - hidden then return end
11:36 - okay because if it is hidden if it is
11:38 - true then it will just end the event
11:41 - there so let's just uh also we're going
11:46 - to need to hide the items as well so
11:48 - we've hidden the button we we just now
11:50 - need to hide the uh items I believe uh
11:54 - or actually that might be done um by
11:57 - itself right because we haven't actually
11:58 - touch T that button yet so I think we're
12:00 - good there um so I think let's just
12:02 - let's just um go back to our conveyor
12:05 - button and let's change the item IDs to
12:08 - appear once bought I only want to unlock
12:12 - the dropper so the dropper has id2 so
12:15 - we're just going to change this value to
12:17 - two because obviously we don't have any
12:19 - any other items with the IDS of four or
12:22 - five yet so you've set this to be two so
12:25 - that when this button the the conveyor
12:29 - is pressed then the item IDs to appear
12:33 - once bought are going to be two and that
12:36 - is the dropper so the dropper is going
12:37 - The Dropper button is going to appear
12:39 - when we've stepped on the conveyor
12:41 - button and we've bought the conveyor
12:43 - anyway Let's uh
12:46 - just um check this out now what I'm also
12:50 - going to do is I'm going to just um in
12:57 - my uh no I'm not going to do that
12:59 - actually I'm just going to click on
13:01 - play now if you're like me and you've
13:03 - tested the game a few times and you
13:05 - realize you can't go back to the start
13:07 - because you've unlocked everything let
13:09 - me show you how to solve that because
13:11 - that's what I've just realized so you
13:13 - want to go and get the data store editor
13:15 - now I think it costs 100 Robo so if you
13:18 - don't want to pay for it you just want
13:20 - to change player
13:23 - data sorry um do something else so you
13:26 - might want to change it to player data
13:28 - too if you do that it's going to reset
13:30 - every player's data okay so if you want
13:32 - to get the old data back just change it
13:34 - to what it originally was called but
13:36 - like I'm saying the better way to do it
13:38 - is to use the data store editor plugin
13:40 - which we talked about in the last uh
13:42 - episode so you click on it and then you
13:45 - I'm just going to drag it to fill up the
13:47 - whole
13:48 - screen right and then you type in your
13:51 - name of your data store which is in that
13:54 - script so it was called player data for
13:56 - me and then you put player and then the
13:59 - user
14:00 - ID which is the format we set it up in
14:02 - the data script player underscore and
14:05 - then the user ID so in my case it's
14:09 - player1 49430 69 which is my user id you
14:14 - click on data you don't even have to
14:16 - click on data you can just uh click on
14:18 - the delete and click on delete and that
14:20 - will delete my data for that slot so it
14:23 - only affects me if you had other players
14:25 - in your game wouldn't affect them
14:27 - obviously cuz it's just deleting my data
14:29 - my specific user ID so now we're back uh
14:33 - let's walk over and going to need to
14:36 - give myself some cash so whilst I'm
14:38 - walking over I'm going to switch to
14:40 - server mode by clicking on current
14:41 - client going to go to the properties
14:44 - sorry go to the Explorer find my player
14:46 - find my leader stats go to my cache I'm
14:49 - going to set it to
14:51 - 500 and go back to current client mode I
14:55 - walk over
14:56 - here and you can see that the dropper
15:01 - button is not there although the text
15:05 - above it is and that's cuz we just
15:06 - forgot to turn that off um but I can
15:08 - walk over it technically sorry you can't
15:11 - see that I just realized technically uh
15:13 - you can see the the text is there but
15:15 - the button isn't but the button is still
15:17 - there like if I get the uh select tool
15:19 - out and hold down uh alt you'll see it's
15:22 - here um the button is here I can step on
15:25 - it whatever it's just not working
15:27 - because it's set to be transparent
15:29 - and in the properties panel you can see
15:31 - that the hidden property is true now let
15:34 - me just walk over I'm going to try and
15:35 - keep it in view okay um you can't see my
15:39 - character but if you just watch closely
15:41 - I'm about to step on the conveyor button
15:42 - which is right here if you watch this
15:44 - hidden attribute I just step on it okay
15:47 - I've bought the
15:49 - conveyor uh however the uh dropper
15:53 - button is still not appearing so let's
15:56 - go and fix that
15:59 - so firstly let's fix the text appearing
16:01 - above the button so we go to the plot
16:03 - Handler we go to the if statement here
16:06 - where we set the transparency and we're
16:08 - just going to say uh button. billboard
16:12 - gy. enabled equals false okay so that's
16:15 - the first part done secondly we need to
16:19 - set the
16:21 - buttons hidden attribute to be false
16:24 - when the player buys an item so we'll
16:27 - just scroll down here to the item IDs to
16:30 - appear once bought this is where we left
16:32 - it right we left it here uh because we
16:35 - had a comment that we wanted to make the
16:36 - button
16:37 - visible so we can now say button.
16:40 - transparency equals z button. billboard
16:43 - GUI enabled equals true and button. can
16:48 - cide equals
16:49 - true uh and also button set attributes
16:54 - hidden and we can just set this to nil
16:57 - uh and that should just remove it I
16:59 - believe uh or you could set it to false
17:01 - it doesn't really matter I think nil
17:03 - will just remove it um so let's uh I
17:07 - think that's all good so what we're
17:09 - going to want to do is we're going to
17:10 - want to go back to the plugins data
17:13 - store
17:14 - editor and then we're going to put in my
17:16 - data player
17:19 - data uh and then player uncore 14943
17:23 - 069 and then I'm just going to delete
17:27 - the items table because I want to keep
17:29 - my cash at 450 I don't want to have to
17:30 - bother with you know setting my cash
17:33 - again on the server and all that um so
17:35 - if we go
17:36 - back and click on
17:39 - play and we're just going have to walk
17:41 - over again this time you can see that
17:44 - the text above the billboard is gone of
17:46 - the button that was hidden so that's a
17:47 - good thing um and hopefully when we step
17:52 - on this button if we just go back to
17:55 - have a look at our button which is
17:57 - hidden over there you have a look at the
17:59 - hidden property you just watch this
18:01 - hidden property when I step on the
18:03 - button okay I'm going step on it uh it
18:07 - is still true for some reason
18:10 - hm okay um well we're going to have to
18:12 - look into
18:13 - that so for some reason the dropper
18:16 - button is still um true and I I have a
18:21 - feeling this might be because the when
18:23 - we do the string dos split on the item
18:27 - IDs
18:28 - these are still strings aren't they um
18:31 - they're not
18:32 - numbers and we are sending this uh Item
18:36 - ID to our function but this item ID is
18:38 - still technically a string because it
18:40 - was a string when we set it in the item
18:44 - IDs to appear once bought we only just
18:46 - split it up so that we had um separated
18:51 - the IDS but they were they're still
18:52 - strings so let's see what happens if we
18:57 - change these to be a string we say item
19:01 - id equals two number item id this will
19:04 - change it from a string to a number so
19:07 - let's go back let's go back to the data
19:09 - store editor just look up my player
19:14 - data player1 14943 069 and this is
19:18 - really uh what debugging is about like
19:21 - you know it only took me a couple of
19:23 - seconds to realize what the problem was
19:25 - here but for you watching this video you
19:27 - might have been stuck on this problem
19:29 - for a very long time it might have even
19:31 - driven you to give up because it's not
19:33 - something you can just see it's
19:35 - something you have to know because you
19:36 - have to think uh logically and you have
19:39 - to think about the reasons why something
19:41 - might be going wrong and all of the
19:43 - underlying causes um which is a key
19:46 - skill in programming really so that's
19:49 - why I leave these sort of problems in
19:50 - the video uh and you can see if you just
19:53 - missed that I stepped on the
19:55 - conveyor and uh The Dropper button has
19:57 - now uh appeared which means it is
19:59 - working um which is perfect so if we now
20:02 - step on the dropper we can purchase that
20:05 - and uh there we go we've just managed to
20:07 - set up uh buttons which uh unlock
20:10 - themselves uh once you've uh unlocked
20:13 - another button which is uh really cool
20:15 - so let's just click on stop and let's
20:17 - load our plot one more time just to make
20:20 - sure everything's going
20:25 - well and there you go it all seems to be
20:27 - working perfectly so uh there you go
20:30 - that's how you add a set of buttons that
20:33 - keep on unlocking other buttons all you
20:35 - have to do is just add the hidden
20:39 - attribute uh uh to the to the button
20:41 - that you want to hide and then on the
20:43 - button which you want to um step on to
20:46 - unlock more items you add the item IDs
20:49 - to appear once bought make sure it's a
20:51 - string uh that way you can set it to
20:53 - unlock multiple items uh and we can test
20:56 - this actually uh if we change this to
20:59 - two and comma 1 so it also unlocks the
21:02 - painting and then we add the uh hidden
21:07 - you have to add the hidden billboard as
21:09 - well attribute to the item as well uh
21:13 - that you want to hide um we can try this
21:16 - one last
21:17 - time just going to reset my data layer
21:21 - data layer 14943
21:24 - 069 delete delete
21:28 - uh and if you don't know what your
21:30 - Roblox user ID is go to your Roblox
21:32 - profile and it will appear in the
21:35 - URL alternatively you can just go to
21:39 - players choose your player and it's
21:42 - right here character appearance ID so
21:44 - that's how you find it it's worth
21:46 - memorizing I know mine off by heart uh
21:49 - and if you're a developer you probably
21:50 - also know yours uh so we'll just give
21:53 - ourselves some cash on the server
21:59 - and you can notice that the painting
22:01 - button is also gone um so what should
22:03 - happen is when we step on the uh
22:08 - conveyor uh it should appear both the
22:12 - dropper and the
22:15 - um both the dropper and the painting now
22:18 - I also want to test one more thing which
22:20 - is now that we've unlocked the
22:21 - buttons uh if we leave and
22:24 - rejoin are they going to still be there
22:27 - now I have a hunch that they
22:29 - won't no they are gone and this is a
22:32 - flaw so this would break the game
22:34 - because if you have unlocked the buttons
22:37 - but you've not unlocked the items they
22:39 - are gone for good so how are we going to
22:42 - solve
22:43 - this well really we just need to take
22:46 - this code that we've written already
22:49 - which will unlock the items when you
22:50 - step on the button and up here when we
22:54 - load in all of the buttons we have this
22:56 - if statement that checks to see if the
22:58 - item's already been unlocked and we just
23:00 - continue if that's the case however just
23:03 - before the continue I think if we paste
23:05 - this
23:06 - here uh it should just load the buttons
23:09 - so I want to test this let's just see if
23:11 - this works because this would be a
23:13 - really quick fix if that is the case so
23:15 - let's click on the play button and see
23:17 - what
23:21 - happens okay we have an error which says
23:24 - buttons is not a valid member of part
23:26 - let's have a look into that that so line
23:30 - 18 uh line 18 line
23:34 - 95
23:39 - um apologies I also just realized you
23:42 - couldn't see what I just uh typed in but
23:44 - all I did was I went and took this code
23:47 - which is here um for the item IDs to
23:51 - appear once sport I've copied it and
23:53 - I've just pasted it up here so apologies
23:55 - about that um so yeah so we have a
23:58 - problem on line 18 here let's go to line
24:02 - 18 line
24:04 - 18 okay uh plot do buttons buttons is
24:09 - not a valid member of plot one uh
24:13 - okay uh plots buttons so there should be
24:17 - a but so ah it's because I think the uh
24:20 - buttons
24:21 - folder is not yet in the
24:26 - plot um
24:28 - okay yeah so let's take this code and
24:31 - we'll just remove it so it was as you
24:32 - were you don't have to worry about
24:34 - changing any of this um but I'm just
24:37 - going to take that code I'm going to
24:38 - wait until we've looped through all of
24:40 - the buttons and I'm going to do another
24:42 - loop uh once the buttons folder has been
24:45 - added to the plot I'm going to say 4core
24:49 - button in template buttons get children
24:53 - do I'm going to
24:56 - paste uh I'm going going to
24:59 - um hold on I'm going to
25:01 - take this again this uh condition which
25:06 - checks to see if um the items ID of the
25:10 - buttons item id of item to unlock is in
25:13 - the item ID's table which means they own
25:17 - the button and they've unlocked
25:19 - it and then this will um make they
25:24 - should make the items appear that are in
25:27 - the buttons ID of items to appear once
25:30 - bought it should make them appear just
25:32 - like we do at this part of the script
25:34 - when you tap on the button so let's
25:36 - click on play
25:39 - again
25:41 - and okay there we go so it seems to be
25:43 - working
25:45 - now uh the items are indeed the buttons
25:49 - are indeed appearing last time they
25:51 - weren't so that seems to be working just
25:55 - fine and we will try it one more time
25:57 - from a new save just to be completely
26:00 - sure it's always good to test make sure
26:03 - everything is working so plugins data
26:06 - store editor and then player data and
26:10 - then player1 14943 069 we're just going
26:14 - to remove the items table and click on
26:16 - Save we'll rejoin I'm going to click on
26:19 - play here just to teleport me straight
26:21 - to the
26:22 - plot
26:25 - and there we go so we now going to walk
26:28 - over and the only button that appears is
26:32 - of course the starter item but we now
26:35 - have our other two buttons appearing
26:37 - going to click on stop and then going to
26:40 - rejoin just to make sure it's all good
26:42 - it's all
26:46 - working and there we go all good seems
26:50 - to be working I'm going to leave
26:51 - again play one more
26:54 - time so this time the painting should
26:56 - load the conveyor should load and the
26:59 - dropper button should load but the
27:00 - dropper shouldn't be there and it all
27:02 - seems to be working perfectly fine so
27:05 - that was how to add um extra buttons
27:09 - which appear once you've unlocked an
27:10 - item I know we haven't added the um the
27:14 - item name yet to the uh to the uh
27:17 - billboard
27:18 - GUI uh but we'll we'll get to that I
27:21 - mean I'll show you I'll show you how to
27:22 - do it right now um all you need to say
27:26 - is button billboard
27:29 - GUI
27:31 - dot text label. text
27:36 - equals
27:39 - um uh uh get item from template
27:45 - plot
27:47 - um button get
27:51 - attributes ID of item to
27:54 - unlock do name or empty string just in
27:58 - case it doesn't exist and then if you
28:00 - click on play
28:03 - here ah I've just realized all of my
28:05 - buttons I've been purchased um so I'm
28:08 - going to have to reset my data one more
28:11 - time I will just speed up the video for
28:13 - this part okay I've just reset my data
28:16 - and I'm going to join the
28:19 - game and there you go it now has the
28:21 - name of the item above the button so it
28:23 - says conveyor I purchase the conveyor
28:26 - and then suddenly The Dropper appear
28:27 - appears and then the painting appears
28:30 - perfect so there you go that was how to
28:32 - add sub buttons into your Tycoon I hope
28:35 - it was useful if it was please like
28:37 - Please Subscribe share the video and
28:39 - I'll see you in the next one

Cleaned transcript:

okay in this part we're going to learn how to create buttons that can only be unlocked once another item is purchased so for example if we want the player to firstly buy the conveyor and then once they've bought the conveyor the button for the dropper then appears okay rather than every single button being visible when the player first joins so to do this uh there's a few ways and I'm sure there's you know per L acceptable ways of doing this um but the way I've decided to do it is for every button if you want it to uh then unlock some other buttons once you've purchased the item we're going to create an attribute for it so I'm going to create a string we're going to call it item IDs um to appear once bought okay and then I'm just going to put the IDS of the items that I want to um appear when they've purchased this item so let's say they want to unlock they want to make the The Dropper appear okay so it doesn't mean they're going to buy the dropper it just means the dropper becomes purchasable so that has an IDE of two so we're going to change the item IDs to appear once bought to two now we set this to be a string okay um we didn't set it to be a number so whilst we have a number here it's actually a string okay and and this is because you might want to have multiple item IDs right so let's say we wanted to have items 2 3 4 and five um appear once we've bought them we can do this because it's a string uh so it's essentially text it's not actually a number this is just some text uh however you can see the ID of item to unlock is a number if we try to give it multiple values it won't let us so um the the reason I I've made this a string is so that we can allow multiple items to then be visible or purchasable once this stter well this this conveyor has been has been uh unlocked and what we'll do is we'll write some code which will uh extract the numbers from this string and we can make them all appear so what we now want to do is we want to go to our code and when this item is unlocked we're going to want to um individually make the buttons appear so in the plot Handler around line 79 where we've got the button do touched we want to scroll down past the point where we know that they can afford the item and what we want to do is we then want to see if the button has an item IDs to appear once bought attribute so we can say local item IDs to appear once bought equals uh button get get attribute item IDs to appear once bought like this okay and then we can see you can check to see if that actually exists because it might not exist we might not have set an attribute for that button so if item IDs to appear once bought then we want to take this string and we want to turn it into the individual numbers because this is just one string right now we want to get these four numbers or however many numbers there are from this string so we're going to say um local numbers so always say local item IDs to uh item IDs equals uh string dot uh split okay and this is going to split the string up into pieces so we can get the individual numbers so item IDs to appear once bought that's our string and then we tell the game what the separator is and the separator is the character in between the numbers you in our case it's commas okay cuz we've got 2 comma 3 comma 4 comma 5 so we're basically saying where there's a comma in this string split it up and so that we can get the individual character that's to the left or to the right of it in that case the numbers whether that's number two number three number four or number five so if we put our comma in here in uh in as a string by using the quote marks or speech marks we can then this will now be the table of our numbers so it will look something like this 2 3 4 5 but because this is a table we can then get the individual numbers from it by indexing that table so we want to Loop through this table so for underscore comma uh Item ID in item IDs do we now have the individual item ID number so we will Loop through and we will do it for two three four and five so what we want to do is we want to firstly get the item uh in the template items uh by its ID sorry I mean get the button okay um so local uh we can just call it local button I am wary that we have gotten a variable already called button here um but since this is nested within our for Loop it will only apply to this for Loop so it's okay so button equals uh we want to find the button in the buttons folder here in the workspace that has the ID of item to unlock so what we're actually going to do is I'm going to create another function like we did earlier which just like these ones which will let us do an action like this without having to Nest that code in this for Loop here so I'm going to call the function get button by ID of item to unlock okay and I'm going to pass that item ID to our function and we will we will code the function to return the button object to this variable so let's just copy the name of this function and go to the top of our script and we're going to create a local function and we're going to call it the same get button by ID of item to unlock now we're also going to need to pass the player and the item ID so let's go back down and let's just pass the player as well to this function because this function is outside of our um create plot event which passes the player so we have to keep a reference to that player so that we can access that player from this function so that's why we pass it to this function and so what we're going to do is we're going to Loop through this player's plot so we're firstly going to want to get their plot so I'm just going to move this function below the get plot function um and then I'm going to call it so local plot equals get plot player if not plot then return end because we obviously don't want to carry on if there's no plot for some reason this is just like a fail safe now we can Loop through the buttons folder in that plot so for underscore comma button in plot. buttons colon get children do if button get attributes ID of item to unlock lock um in fact we will create a variable for this local ID of item to unlock if ID of item to unlock we just need to make sure it exists just in case you forgotten to set up this attribute it would be nil and it would then cause an error so um we can actually say if not uh ID of item to unlock then continue end and that will just move on to the next button in the loop uh by this point we know that the the attribute exists so we can say uh if item id uh is equal to ID of item to unlock then return button end okay and I'm going to actually put this onto another line just to make it more readable so this is going to return the button and if there is no button it won't return anything at all so we can now go back down to our code and uh where is it here it is so we now have the button but let's just make sure it exists so if not button then continue end and then by this point we know that the button exists uh we have now found the button so we want to make it visible now it's it's going to be visible already because we haven't actually written any code that hides it so I think we should do that first um so let's figure out how we should hide this button now there's two ways we can do this um the first method which is the easier method is we just add an attribute to every button that we want to only appear once another button has been uh touched and we can just add an attribute to that to say hidden and then when the game first loads it will hide all of those buttons the other option is we Loop through every single button and we see if it is listed in another button uh in the item IDs to appear once bought uh string however that would mean if you have a lot of items it's going to be looping over every single item and it might might cause some performance issues so that's the way I see it some people in the comments might have their own um you know view so personally what I'm going to do is I'm just going to choose the buttons I don't want to appear by default when the Tycoon loads and I'm just going to add a Ulan attribute okay and I'm going to call it hidden and I'm going to click save I'm going to make it true now some people would argue that having to set another attribute is just another thing you have to remember to do and that's true however I think for this Tycoon and for this series it's the simplest method of doing it so there's no right or wrong answer this will work either way I just wanted to explain myself so what we can now do now that we've set up this hidden attribute in the button is when we load in our buttons in the plot Handler around line 86 we want to firstly check to see if this is hidden so we can say if button get attribute hidden then uh we want to hide the button so button. transparency equals 1 and we also don't want it to um unlock the item when you touch it because you can still obviously touch it when it is hidden so firstly we're going to say button. canide equals false and then in the button. touched event we want to say if button get attribute hidden then return end okay because if it is hidden if it is true then it will just end the event there so let's just uh also we're going to need to hide the items as well so we've hidden the button we we just now need to hide the uh items I believe uh or actually that might be done um by itself right because we haven't actually touch T that button yet so I think we're good there um so I think let's just let's just um go back to our conveyor button and let's change the item IDs to appear once bought I only want to unlock the dropper so the dropper has id2 so we're just going to change this value to two because obviously we don't have any any other items with the IDS of four or five yet so you've set this to be two so that when this button the the conveyor is pressed then the item IDs to appear once bought are going to be two and that is the dropper so the dropper is going The Dropper button is going to appear when we've stepped on the conveyor button and we've bought the conveyor anyway Let's uh just um check this out now what I'm also going to do is I'm going to just um in my uh no I'm not going to do that actually I'm just going to click on play now if you're like me and you've tested the game a few times and you realize you can't go back to the start because you've unlocked everything let me show you how to solve that because that's what I've just realized so you want to go and get the data store editor now I think it costs 100 Robo so if you don't want to pay for it you just want to change player data sorry um do something else so you might want to change it to player data too if you do that it's going to reset every player's data okay so if you want to get the old data back just change it to what it originally was called but like I'm saying the better way to do it is to use the data store editor plugin which we talked about in the last uh episode so you click on it and then you I'm just going to drag it to fill up the whole screen right and then you type in your name of your data store which is in that script so it was called player data for me and then you put player and then the user ID which is the format we set it up in the data script player underscore and then the user ID so in my case it's player1 49430 69 which is my user id you click on data you don't even have to click on data you can just uh click on the delete and click on delete and that will delete my data for that slot so it only affects me if you had other players in your game wouldn't affect them obviously cuz it's just deleting my data my specific user ID so now we're back uh let's walk over and going to need to give myself some cash so whilst I'm walking over I'm going to switch to server mode by clicking on current client going to go to the properties sorry go to the Explorer find my player find my leader stats go to my cache I'm going to set it to 500 and go back to current client mode I walk over here and you can see that the dropper button is not there although the text above it is and that's cuz we just forgot to turn that off um but I can walk over it technically sorry you can't see that I just realized technically uh you can see the the text is there but the button isn't but the button is still there like if I get the uh select tool out and hold down uh alt you'll see it's here um the button is here I can step on it whatever it's just not working because it's set to be transparent and in the properties panel you can see that the hidden property is true now let me just walk over I'm going to try and keep it in view okay um you can't see my character but if you just watch closely I'm about to step on the conveyor button which is right here if you watch this hidden attribute I just step on it okay I've bought the conveyor uh however the uh dropper button is still not appearing so let's go and fix that so firstly let's fix the text appearing above the button so we go to the plot Handler we go to the if statement here where we set the transparency and we're just going to say uh button. billboard gy. enabled equals false okay so that's the first part done secondly we need to set the buttons hidden attribute to be false when the player buys an item so we'll just scroll down here to the item IDs to appear once bought this is where we left it right we left it here uh because we had a comment that we wanted to make the button visible so we can now say button. transparency equals z button. billboard GUI enabled equals true and button. can cide equals true uh and also button set attributes hidden and we can just set this to nil uh and that should just remove it I believe uh or you could set it to false it doesn't really matter I think nil will just remove it um so let's uh I think that's all good so what we're going to want to do is we're going to want to go back to the plugins data store editor and then we're going to put in my data player data uh and then player uncore 14943 069 and then I'm just going to delete the items table because I want to keep my cash at 450 I don't want to have to bother with you know setting my cash again on the server and all that um so if we go back and click on play and we're just going have to walk over again this time you can see that the text above the billboard is gone of the button that was hidden so that's a good thing um and hopefully when we step on this button if we just go back to have a look at our button which is hidden over there you have a look at the hidden property you just watch this hidden property when I step on the button okay I'm going step on it uh it is still true for some reason hm okay um well we're going to have to look into that so for some reason the dropper button is still um true and I I have a feeling this might be because the when we do the string dos split on the item IDs these are still strings aren't they um they're not numbers and we are sending this uh Item ID to our function but this item ID is still technically a string because it was a string when we set it in the item IDs to appear once bought we only just split it up so that we had um separated the IDS but they were they're still strings so let's see what happens if we change these to be a string we say item id equals two number item id this will change it from a string to a number so let's go back let's go back to the data store editor just look up my player data player1 14943 069 and this is really uh what debugging is about like you know it only took me a couple of seconds to realize what the problem was here but for you watching this video you might have been stuck on this problem for a very long time it might have even driven you to give up because it's not something you can just see it's something you have to know because you have to think uh logically and you have to think about the reasons why something might be going wrong and all of the underlying causes um which is a key skill in programming really so that's why I leave these sort of problems in the video uh and you can see if you just missed that I stepped on the conveyor and uh The Dropper button has now uh appeared which means it is working um which is perfect so if we now step on the dropper we can purchase that and uh there we go we've just managed to set up uh buttons which uh unlock themselves uh once you've uh unlocked another button which is uh really cool so let's just click on stop and let's load our plot one more time just to make sure everything's going well and there you go it all seems to be working perfectly so uh there you go that's how you add a set of buttons that keep on unlocking other buttons all you have to do is just add the hidden attribute uh uh to the to the button that you want to hide and then on the button which you want to um step on to unlock more items you add the item IDs to appear once bought make sure it's a string uh that way you can set it to unlock multiple items uh and we can test this actually uh if we change this to two and comma 1 so it also unlocks the painting and then we add the uh hidden you have to add the hidden billboard as well attribute to the item as well uh that you want to hide um we can try this one last time just going to reset my data layer data layer 14943 069 delete delete uh and if you don't know what your Roblox user ID is go to your Roblox profile and it will appear in the URL alternatively you can just go to players choose your player and it's right here character appearance ID so that's how you find it it's worth memorizing I know mine off by heart uh and if you're a developer you probably also know yours uh so we'll just give ourselves some cash on the server and you can notice that the painting button is also gone um so what should happen is when we step on the uh conveyor uh it should appear both the dropper and the um both the dropper and the painting now I also want to test one more thing which is now that we've unlocked the buttons uh if we leave and rejoin are they going to still be there now I have a hunch that they won't no they are gone and this is a flaw so this would break the game because if you have unlocked the buttons but you've not unlocked the items they are gone for good so how are we going to solve this well really we just need to take this code that we've written already which will unlock the items when you step on the button and up here when we load in all of the buttons we have this if statement that checks to see if the item's already been unlocked and we just continue if that's the case however just before the continue I think if we paste this here uh it should just load the buttons so I want to test this let's just see if this works because this would be a really quick fix if that is the case so let's click on the play button and see what happens okay we have an error which says buttons is not a valid member of part let's have a look into that that so line 18 uh line 18 line 95 um apologies I also just realized you couldn't see what I just uh typed in but all I did was I went and took this code which is here um for the item IDs to appear once sport I've copied it and I've just pasted it up here so apologies about that um so yeah so we have a problem on line 18 here let's go to line 18 line 18 okay uh plot do buttons buttons is not a valid member of plot one uh okay uh plots buttons so there should be a but so ah it's because I think the uh buttons folder is not yet in the plot um okay yeah so let's take this code and we'll just remove it so it was as you were you don't have to worry about changing any of this um but I'm just going to take that code I'm going to wait until we've looped through all of the buttons and I'm going to do another loop uh once the buttons folder has been added to the plot I'm going to say 4core button in template buttons get children do I'm going to paste uh I'm going going to um hold on I'm going to take this again this uh condition which checks to see if um the items ID of the buttons item id of item to unlock is in the item ID's table which means they own the button and they've unlocked it and then this will um make they should make the items appear that are in the buttons ID of items to appear once bought it should make them appear just like we do at this part of the script when you tap on the button so let's click on play again and okay there we go so it seems to be working now uh the items are indeed the buttons are indeed appearing last time they weren't so that seems to be working just fine and we will try it one more time from a new save just to be completely sure it's always good to test make sure everything is working so plugins data store editor and then player data and then player1 14943 069 we're just going to remove the items table and click on Save we'll rejoin I'm going to click on play here just to teleport me straight to the plot and there we go so we now going to walk over and the only button that appears is of course the starter item but we now have our other two buttons appearing going to click on stop and then going to rejoin just to make sure it's all good it's all working and there we go all good seems to be working I'm going to leave again play one more time so this time the painting should load the conveyor should load and the dropper button should load but the dropper shouldn't be there and it all seems to be working perfectly fine so that was how to add um extra buttons which appear once you've unlocked an item I know we haven't added the um the item name yet to the uh to the uh billboard GUI uh but we'll we'll get to that I mean I'll show you I'll show you how to do it right now um all you need to say is button billboard GUI dot text label. text equals um uh uh get item from template plot um button get attributes ID of item to unlock do name or empty string just in case it doesn't exist and then if you click on play here ah I've just realized all of my buttons I've been purchased um so I'm going to have to reset my data one more time I will
