00:01 - hey everyone it's been a while i have
00:03 - taken a break but i'm back
00:05 - and i'm here to share with you some
00:07 - exciting news because
00:09 - there's a new output for roblox studio
00:11 - and i'm going to show you
00:12 - how you can enable it if it's not
00:14 - already enabled because
00:16 - if you're watching this in the future it
00:17 - probably already is enabled but at the
00:19 - minute it's a beta feature so it's still
00:21 - um being tested for bugs etcetera but
00:24 - it's pretty stable
00:25 - and i'll show you what's new about it
00:27 - and how you can enable it so
00:28 - obviously the um current output is quite
00:31 - limited in features
00:32 - um all it does is really display um
00:34 - errors and you can't
00:35 - there are some things you can't do so
00:37 - you can't print tables
00:39 - you can't uh there's all sorts okay and
00:41 - uh anyway let's just get into it let's
00:43 - just have a look
00:44 - at the new output so to get it you click
00:46 - on file you click on beta features
00:49 - and um i just say at this point you know
00:51 - beta features
00:52 - a beta for a reason they can break um
00:55 - and they're not ready for production so
00:58 - they could
00:59 - you know uh completely break or it could
01:02 - um it could even do some harm to a
01:03 - roblox place but that is unlikely but a
01:05 - quick disclaimer
01:06 - um it's probably not a good idea to do
01:08 - this in a live place
01:10 - maybe just test it out in a base plate
01:12 - first but
01:13 - if you go into this beta features window
01:15 - and you click on
01:18 - expressive output window you can see
01:21 - that
01:21 - it says expressive ui filter and search
01:24 - and copy paste becomes easier so you
01:25 - click on save
01:27 - and then you have to restart studio so
01:29 - i'll come back
01:30 - in a sec and here we are actually find
01:34 - magic
01:34 - the new output is enabled and already it
01:37 - does look a bit different it probably
01:39 - does look better in dark mode
01:40 - but let me run you through some of the
01:42 - new features
01:44 - so first thing is that you can now
01:46 - search the output
01:47 - so if your output was full of messages
01:49 - you could search for a specific one
01:51 - and you can see it's highlighting the
01:54 - results here
01:55 - obviously i've searched for a term that
01:57 - is in this
01:58 - line here so that is the search feature
02:00 - now the next feature i like is that you
02:02 - can
02:02 - show um only error you can when you can
02:05 - choose
02:06 - which messages you want to to show so
02:08 - you could show
02:09 - um messages so error messages
02:13 - or output messages that come from server
02:16 - scripts or client scripts
02:18 - or from when when you're out of client
02:21 - server mode when you're actually in the
02:22 - edit mode which is what we're in now
02:24 - if you were to only get messages from
02:26 - the command bar or something like that
02:28 - and whether you want to see error
02:30 - messages or messages from plugins
02:32 - now i have a lot of plugins that
02:34 - sometimes error and they fill up my
02:36 - output so that's a really really useful
02:39 - button for me because i can just hide
02:40 - them because i don't need to know about
02:42 - them so you can choose which
02:44 - output messages you want to appear which
02:45 - is very useful as well as being able to
02:48 - choose
02:48 - whether you want to see errors which are
02:51 - the red ones
02:52 - or the warnings which is basically a
02:54 - yellow version of print you can
02:56 - say warn and then in brackets put your
02:58 - message and it will print out in
02:59 - orange in an orange font that's a
03:02 - warning message
03:03 - so you can either have you can choose if
03:04 - you want to show errors warnings
03:06 - information messages
03:08 - so i assume that they're just messages
03:09 - from from roblox studio or something
03:12 - about
03:12 - your game um and then system messages
03:16 - and log messages so you can choose which
03:19 - of these you want to see so it's useful
03:20 - if you
03:21 - have got an output and it's full of
03:23 - messages and you only just want to see
03:24 - the errors
03:25 - you just deselect them all and only
03:27 - select the errors
03:28 - so that's another really good feature
03:29 - there now the next feature
03:32 - as i said a part of the search you can
03:34 - you can
03:35 - decide if you want the search to match
03:37 - the case exactly so
03:39 - if i said asset delivery and it's
03:42 - highlighted
03:42 - here but i wanted it to match the case
03:45 - and i started
03:47 - doing it in capital letters you can see
03:49 - it doesn't it doesn't find it because
03:50 - it's matching the case
03:52 - and we've also got match whole word so
03:55 - if you can see it matches the word asset
03:58 - but if i was to say delivery it no
04:00 - longer is um
04:02 - highlighted because it's looking for the
04:04 - entire message asset
04:05 - deliver and there is no asset deliv
04:08 - but there's an asset delivery so that's
04:10 - matching the whole word
04:11 - and then we've also got um regular
04:14 - expression
04:15 - i'll put my hands up i don't know what
04:16 - that one is um i'll get back to you on
04:18 - that one
04:18 - uh you've also got a destroy button so
04:21 - you click that and it wipes your output
04:23 - you can also do that by pressing ctrl
04:25 - k or command k to clear the output and
04:28 - you've also got the ability to show
04:30 - the time stamp on messages whether you
04:32 - want to show messages only so
04:35 - sorry select messages only and whether
04:37 - you want to expand
04:38 - tables now this is the biggest one for
04:40 - me it's the biggest one for me because
04:41 - if you want to print a table
04:43 - right let's just say local my tab
04:46 - um my tab equals
04:50 - and then you know we have a few things
04:52 - in this table a
04:54 - b c and then you want to print
04:57 - my tab well you wouldn't be able to do
05:00 - this
05:01 - um normally because it would say table
05:03 - and there would be a long string of
05:05 - um text and that would be the memory
05:08 - location of the table because
05:09 - roblox just would not be able to print
05:11 - out tables for some reason but now
05:13 - boom you can print the table and you can
05:15 - expand it to see everything inside of it
05:17 - so that's really really useful
05:19 - as well you can scroll by pressing ctrl
05:22 - and scrolling or command and scrolling
05:24 - to make it bigger or smaller
05:26 - and you can expand them by default so i
05:29 - just had to expand the table
05:30 - and the next time you do it it's
05:31 - automatically expanded so
05:33 - i'm a real fan of that and if you want
05:35 - the memory address back you can just
05:37 - select it there but you can see
05:39 - uh here this is what i was on about this
05:41 - is what you only used to get when you
05:43 - printed out a table but now you can see
05:45 - the
05:45 - entire contents of the table this is
05:47 - really really useful if you're printing
05:48 - out something like a data store
05:50 - which has got lots of sub tables inside
05:52 - of it so a table inside a table
05:53 - you just want to see the whole table
05:55 - because you want to make sure that your
05:56 - your data saved correctly
05:58 - um i'm i'm a big fan of this output
06:00 - window very very big fan so
06:02 - um a massive well done to roblox as well
06:04 - you can
06:06 - you can drag each window or each tab
06:09 - to make it bigger or smaller so a real
06:11 - well done to roblox on making this
06:13 - output window
06:14 - i'm a big fan of it and i want to know
06:16 - what you think as well
06:18 - get your suggestions if you have any
06:19 - more for the output in the description
06:22 - there's also a post about it on the dev
06:23 - forum but i think i've covered
06:24 - everything that we need to do
06:26 - uh so so yeah anyway thanks for watching
06:30 - hope the video was useful and don't
06:32 - forget that beta features um
06:34 - if it is still in beta it might be
06:36 - enabled by default for everyone by the
06:37 - time you're watching this video
06:39 - uh they are still a little bit unstable
06:41 - so it might be a good idea
06:43 - not to use them in games where you want
06:45 - to lose everything or you might just
06:46 - want to take a backup of your game
06:48 - in a separate place in case something
06:49 - happens and you lose it but
06:51 - it's been pretty stable for me so far
06:52 - i've not experienced
06:54 - i actually i have experienced a small
06:56 - issue where uh
06:57 - render stepped uh events seem to run a
07:00 - little bit slower
07:01 - and start to lag a little bit so that's
07:02 - why i'm not having the output enabled
07:04 - i'm sticking with the old one for now
07:05 - but when it's in production it's going
07:07 - to be a really powerful output and a
07:09 - much needed upgrade to debugging in
07:13 - roblox so thanks for watching
07:15 - hope you enjoyed drop a like if you did
07:17 - and i'll see you in the next one cheers
