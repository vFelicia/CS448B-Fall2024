00:00 - in this video I'm going to show you how
00:03 - to create an obstacle course on Roblox
00:05 - so the first thing you want to do is
00:07 - when you open up Roblox Studio the app
00:10 - which you need to create a Roblox game
00:12 - which will be linked in the description
00:14 - you need to click on the new button and
00:17 - select base plate
00:19 - once you've done that you'll see this
00:22 - screen we've got some panels here on the
00:24 - side one is the Explorer that allows us
00:27 - to see all of the objects in our game if
00:29 - you click on the Arrow where it says
00:31 - workspace you'll see we've got a base
00:33 - plate spawn location camera and terrain
00:36 - now if you don't see this panel the
00:39 - Explorer panel all you need to do is
00:42 - head to the top left corner of Roblox
00:46 - Studio go to view and make sure that
00:49 - Explorer and properties are selected
00:53 - and then down here in the bottom right
00:56 - we've got the properties window again
00:58 - these might be in a separate location
01:00 - but if you can see them on the screen
01:02 - that's all you need the properties
01:04 - window is where we can customize the
01:06 - appearance and behavior of any objects
01:09 - in the game which is going to be crucial
01:11 - for creating an Obby so let's get
01:13 - started by selecting the base plate
01:16 - and the spawn location we're going to
01:18 - right click and delete them for now now
01:21 - you'll see that this leaves us with
01:22 - nothing in the game world that's fine
01:25 - because what we can do is we can head up
01:27 - to the top of Roblox Studio select the
01:30 - Home tab and insert a part so if you
01:33 - just click on the part button you can
01:35 - see we have a new part which has been
01:37 - generated and this is going to be our
01:39 - lobby spawn area so let's use the four
01:43 - tools up here underneath the Home tab
01:45 - select move scale and rotate to
01:48 - manipulate this part so I'm going to
01:50 - select the scale tool this allows us to
01:52 - resize the part and you can see here
01:54 - that we've now got these handles on our
01:56 - part so we can drag
01:59 - and make our part bigger and then what I
02:01 - want to do is because this is going to
02:02 - be a platform that players stand on we
02:04 - want it to be stuck in the air we don't
02:06 - want it to fall and destroy itself when
02:09 - the game begins so let's head to the
02:11 - properties panel because I've just said
02:13 - the properties panel is what we use to
02:15 - control the appearance or in this case
02:17 - the behavior of our object we want to
02:20 - scroll down to where it says anchored
02:22 - you want to make sure anchored is
02:23 - selected make it checked this just means
02:26 - that when the game starts this part
02:28 - isn't going to fall out of the world
02:30 - next what we need to do is insert a
02:33 - spawn on top of this part so that
02:35 - players will be positioned in this lobby
02:38 - area so if we head back to our top area
02:42 - here on this menu bar and if we select
02:44 - the model tab this time
02:47 - and just move over here you can see it
02:49 - says spawn so this is underneath the
02:52 - model tab so if we click on spawn you
02:55 - can see a spawn has been added to the
02:57 - game and we can just drag this and place
02:59 - it on top of our lobby
03:02 - all right let's see what works so far
03:05 - let's head back to the tabs area here
03:09 - let's go to the Home tab and click on
03:11 - play now what should happen is our
03:14 - character should spawn on our spawn
03:17 - point there we go so we've created the
03:19 - lobby part for our Hobby
03:23 - now it's time to create some actual
03:25 - obstacles so what I'm going to do is I'm
03:27 - going to take this part which is our
03:30 - lobby area I'm going to right click and
03:33 - I'm going to duplicate it okay you can
03:34 - also press Ctrl D on the keyboard but
03:37 - I've just made a duplicate of it and
03:39 - then
03:40 - I'm going to select the move tool up
03:42 - here because I want to move this part
03:43 - and then we're just going to drag the
03:46 - blue handle
03:48 - and I'm going to create a jump okay so
03:50 - this is a jump that a player is going to
03:51 - have to navigate
03:52 - now I'm going to use the scale tool up
03:55 - here and I'm just going to make this
03:58 - second part a little bit smaller okay so
04:00 - this is our jump we don't need to worry
04:02 - about the anchored property because it's
04:04 - still the same it's checked just like
04:06 - this other part because this is a
04:07 - duplicate so what we can now do is
04:10 - select the move tool again
04:12 - I'm going to go back and I'm going to
04:14 - press Ctrl D on the keyboard or command
04:17 - D if you're on a Mac to duplicate this
04:19 - jump okay I've pressed it and I'm just
04:21 - going to move it along here I'm going to
04:23 - create a few jumps this is going to be
04:25 - our first obstacle so you can just keep
04:28 - pressing the duplicate key or you can
04:30 - right click of course and select
04:32 - duplicate it's up to you I'm just going
04:34 - to keep on doing these for a few more
04:36 - jumps
04:37 - there we go so this is going to be our
04:39 - first obstacle now if you'd like you can
04:41 - change the color of these parts all you
04:44 - have to do is click on the select tool
04:47 - and then select the parts that you want
04:49 - to color and then once it's selected you
04:51 - see this blue box outline you then just
04:54 - want to head down to the properties
04:55 - panel and underneath brick color you can
04:58 - choose a color here and you can see in
04:59 - the corner that it's actually changing
05:01 - the color so I can do a red part and I
05:04 - can do the same for all these other ones
05:05 - as well
05:07 - so there we go I've just selected each
05:09 - individual part gone to the properties
05:11 - window down here and changed that brick
05:14 - color property you could also change the
05:16 - color property which lets you make them
05:18 - a little bit more detailed so it's up to
05:20 - you and again if you don't see the
05:22 - properties window or the Explorer panel
05:24 - do not worry all you need to do is just
05:26 - head up to the top left here click on
05:28 - view and make sure that these two are
05:29 - selected
05:31 - alright
05:33 - now that we've created our first
05:35 - obstacle I'm going to go back over here
05:37 - take our little platform right click
05:40 - duplicate it again and I'm going to use
05:42 - the move tool to just bring it over here
05:45 - so this is going to be a little rest
05:47 - area a little platform for our players
05:49 - to chill on before they take the next
05:53 - obstacle so let's create that next
05:55 - obstacle now there's going to be a
05:56 - choose path now you've probably seen
05:58 - these before it's going to be three
06:00 - different paths and only one of them is
06:03 - going to be the correct path the other
06:05 - two the player will fall through them if
06:07 - they choose that path so what I'll do is
06:10 - I'm going to select this part
06:12 - we're going to duplicate it so Ctrl D or
06:16 - command D and then using the move tool
06:18 - I'm just going to move it to the very
06:20 - edge here okay and now what I'm going to
06:23 - do is I'm going to select the scale tool
06:25 - because we want to change the size
06:27 - so using the scale tool I'm just going
06:29 - to make this about a third of the width
06:33 - of this platform here okay and then what
06:37 - I'm going to do is I'm going to right
06:38 - click duplicate select the move tool and
06:43 - bring it back over here okay and I'm
06:45 - going to do the exact same thing again
06:46 - right click duplicate and bring this
06:49 - over
06:50 - now just to make this in the middle of
06:52 - the two of the parts I'm just going to
06:54 - head to the model tab I'm going to
06:56 - uncheck this box where it says snap to
06:58 - grid underneath move so I'm going to
07:00 - uncheck move and this will just let us
07:03 - have some free movement it's not going
07:04 - to lock it to studs so I can finally set
07:07 - the position of this middle part
07:10 - now that we've got our three paths I
07:13 - said I only want one of them to be
07:14 - walkable so I'm going to select the
07:17 - other two paths so I want the part the
07:19 - path in the middle to be walkable okay
07:21 - now if we select this part you'll see in
07:24 - the properties window which controls the
07:26 - behavior of these parts that can Collide
07:28 - is set to true and this is going to be
07:30 - really important this part because if we
07:32 - just move over here so you can see it
07:34 - there we go so you can see this one in
07:36 - the middle the can Collide is set to
07:38 - true we want to keep that the same we
07:39 - want to keep this checked because can
07:41 - Collide means that you can walk over the
07:43 - parts if we were to set this can Collide
07:45 - property to unchecked it would mean that
07:47 - you'd fall straight through it when you
07:49 - try to walk over it so since I want this
07:51 - middle part to be the correct path I'm
07:53 - going to firstly select the other two
07:56 - okay so I've selected them both by
07:58 - holding down control or command on my
08:01 - keyboard I've just selected them I'm
08:03 - going to uncheck and Collide okay so now
08:06 - these two paths the one on the left and
08:09 - the one on the right the plan will fall
08:11 - straight through if they try to walk on
08:13 - them but of course the player doesn't
08:14 - know that they'll just have to try this
08:17 - obstacle a couple of times until they
08:20 - realize which path is the right one and
08:22 - just like before we can select each
08:24 - heart head to the properties window and
08:27 - change the brick color so I can set this
08:29 - one to be red this one can be green and
08:32 - this one can be yellow okay
08:35 - so now that we've done that we've
08:37 - created our first choose path we can do
08:39 - the same thing again we can just take
08:41 - these three blocks by using the select
08:43 - tool up here and we can just drag to
08:46 - select all four we've got three paths
08:48 - and one platform and then we can right
08:51 - click duplicate that's going to create a
08:53 - duplication of all four parts and then
08:56 - we can go back up here to use the move
08:57 - tool
08:59 - and since they're all still selected we
09:01 - can just move them over now I'm going to
09:03 - head back to the snap to grid and in the
09:06 - model tab here and just set that to be
09:08 - checked again because I want it to lock
09:09 - to one stood when I move it and then we
09:12 - can just drag our duplicate Parts over
09:14 - here
09:15 - and this time I want this uh far right
09:19 - part to be the correct path so I'm going
09:23 - to set that one's can Collide to be true
09:25 - down here okay and then the other two
09:28 - I'm going to select by holding down
09:31 - control or command and heading back to
09:33 - the properties window you can see it's
09:35 - got a subtract or a line through the box
09:38 - that means one of them's can collide one
09:40 - of them isn't at the moment so if I just
09:42 - check that if I click it sorry it's
09:44 - going to uncheck it so both these two
09:47 - the red and the green are now going to
09:50 - be the incorrect paths because we've set
09:51 - their can Collide to be false this one
09:53 - on the right is the correct one and I'm
09:56 - also going to change the colors of these
09:57 - because
09:58 - why not we can have a blue one we can
10:01 - have a pink one and we can have another
10:05 - yellow one okay and if you want you can
10:08 - do one more but I think two is enough
10:10 - just because it's going to take the
10:11 - player a few tries anyway to work this
10:14 - out so I'm going to go back and take one
10:16 - of my platforms over here right click
10:18 - duplicate I'm going to use the move tool
10:21 - and just bring this over here
10:24 - okay so there we go our second obstacle
10:27 - is completed
10:29 - let's have a quick playthrough of our
10:31 - hobby to make sure everything's working
10:33 - so I'm gonna head back up here to the
10:35 - Home tab and then just over here
10:37 - underneath the test section I'm going to
10:39 - click on play
10:41 - this is going to spawn us into the game
10:43 - you can see we're here at the spawn
10:44 - point let's give our jumps a go so are
10:47 - there just about
10:49 - five or six studs spaced out which is
10:52 - just enough for the player so that is a
10:56 - uh a tested fully tested obstacle we
10:58 - know that one works and then we've got
11:00 - our choose path so we've got the the
11:02 - path down the middle which is the
11:04 - correct one and we've got this one on
11:07 - the right as well which is the correct
11:08 - one but any other path
11:10 - oh oh there we go here we go yeah any
11:13 - other path that we that we try and walk
11:15 - through will just uh we'll just fall
11:18 - straight through and we'll die so all
11:20 - good it seems like the hobby is working
11:23 - so far let's now create our final
11:26 - obstacle
11:28 - now the final obstacle is going to be
11:30 - some lava jumps so I'm going to take
11:32 - this platform select it and then up here
11:35 - we're going to select the scale tool and
11:37 - I'm going to extend this platform to
11:40 - allow us to place our lava bricks on top
11:42 - of them now we need to insert another
11:44 - part so let's head back up here and
11:48 - choose part that's going to spawn this
11:50 - part on top of our platform so we can
11:53 - just take it move it to the edge and
11:56 - make it span the entire width of this
11:59 - platform then we can go down to the
12:01 - properties window and where it says
12:03 - brick color we can set that to Red I'm
12:06 - also going to set the material to be
12:08 - neon if you have a look you can see I've
12:11 - now got a bright shiny red lava Block in
12:14 - fact I'm going to make this a little bit
12:15 - harder and extend the width and height
12:17 - of this lava jump alright now I'm just
12:21 - going to go back and select the move
12:23 - tool and I'm just going to space this
12:25 - out a little bit so the player's got
12:27 - some room and then I'm going to keep
12:29 - right clicking and duplicating to place
12:31 - down some more lava bricks
12:35 - all right so here are all my lava bricks
12:37 - but there's one last thing we need to do
12:39 - we need to make the player die when they
12:42 - step on these lava jumps so how do we do
12:45 - that well it's rather easy all we need
12:48 - to do is Select them all
12:51 - so I'll select one two three four
12:53 - holding down control or command if
12:56 - you're on a Mac so they're all selected
12:57 - and then in the Explorer panel I'm going
13:01 - to right click and select group as a
13:03 - folder
13:04 - then in the properties window I can name
13:07 - this folder lava bricks
13:11 - and then all we now need to do is back
13:14 - in the Explorer if we go to server
13:17 - script service we'll click on this plus
13:19 - and search for a script
13:21 - now make sure you insert this gray
13:23 - script here
13:25 - and then you'll see the code editor has
13:27 - opened up I'm just going to hide this
13:29 - Banner here
13:30 - and even if you've not written any code
13:33 - before don't worry we're just going to
13:35 - write some simple code which will make
13:38 - the player die when they step on a lava
13:40 - brick so here's the code you need to
13:42 - write
13:44 - so here is the code firstly you don't
13:47 - have to write out these green comments
13:50 - they're just there to help explain
13:51 - what's going on so firstly we create a
13:55 - variable to easily reference our folder
13:58 - over here in the workspace we then Loop
14:01 - through every single lava brick in that
14:04 - folder and for each one we detect when
14:07 - the lava brick has been stepped on
14:09 - which gives us the object that touched
14:12 - the brick now it could be a player it
14:14 - could be some other object in the game
14:16 - so we have to make sure that it is a
14:18 - player by doing a check here which will
14:21 - return true or false and if it is a
14:24 - potential player then we're going to set
14:26 - the health of that player's humanoid
14:29 - which is in their character to zero
14:32 - which is going to kill them now there'll
14:34 - be a link to this code in the
14:35 - description alternatively you can just
14:37 - pause the video and copy it out for
14:39 - yourself but make sure that you spell
14:42 - everything correctly just like I have
14:44 - here because a simple typo can cause
14:46 - your script to break
14:49 - now for this to work you'll have to make
14:52 - sure that all of your parts are in a
14:53 - folder called lava bricks with a space
14:56 - in between the lava and bricks and
14:59 - obviously a capital l and capital B for
15:01 - lava and Bricks but once you've done
15:04 - that your lava bricks should be good to
15:06 - go now let's see if they work I'm going
15:08 - to click on play here
15:10 - up here underneath the Home tab that
15:13 - will teleport you to the exact location
15:15 - where you want to spawn so if you click
15:18 - on that little arrow underneath play
15:19 - here and select play here because you
15:22 - may be set to play rather than play here
15:24 - it will spawn you wherever your
15:26 - character what your camera is facing so
15:29 - if you just move your camera over here
15:30 - you will spawn at the lava bricks and
15:33 - now if we step on our lava bricks you
15:36 - can see it kills us so we've got our
15:39 - three obstacles here and it takes us
15:42 - back to the start when you finish
15:45 - now you may be wondering how to add
15:47 - checkpoints and I actually made another
15:48 - video showing how to do this and I'll be
15:51 - creating an updated version in the
15:53 - meantime as well so I'll leave a link to
15:55 - that for you to go and watch but that's
15:57 - it for this video you've just learned
15:59 - how to make a very simple Hobby in
16:01 - Roblox studio in just 15 minutes if you

Cleaned transcript:

in this video I'm going to show you how to create an obstacle course on Roblox so the first thing you want to do is when you open up Roblox Studio the app which you need to create a Roblox game which will be linked in the description you need to click on the new button and select base plate once you've done that you'll see this screen we've got some panels here on the side one is the Explorer that allows us to see all of the objects in our game if you click on the Arrow where it says workspace you'll see we've got a base plate spawn location camera and terrain now if you don't see this panel the Explorer panel all you need to do is head to the top left corner of Roblox Studio go to view and make sure that Explorer and properties are selected and then down here in the bottom right we've got the properties window again these might be in a separate location but if you can see them on the screen that's all you need the properties window is where we can customize the appearance and behavior of any objects in the game which is going to be crucial for creating an Obby so let's get started by selecting the base plate and the spawn location we're going to right click and delete them for now now you'll see that this leaves us with nothing in the game world that's fine because what we can do is we can head up to the top of Roblox Studio select the Home tab and insert a part so if you just click on the part button you can see we have a new part which has been generated and this is going to be our lobby spawn area so let's use the four tools up here underneath the Home tab select move scale and rotate to manipulate this part so I'm going to select the scale tool this allows us to resize the part and you can see here that we've now got these handles on our part so we can drag and make our part bigger and then what I want to do is because this is going to be a platform that players stand on we want it to be stuck in the air we don't want it to fall and destroy itself when the game begins so let's head to the properties panel because I've just said the properties panel is what we use to control the appearance or in this case the behavior of our object we want to scroll down to where it says anchored you want to make sure anchored is selected make it checked this just means that when the game starts this part isn't going to fall out of the world next what we need to do is insert a spawn on top of this part so that players will be positioned in this lobby area so if we head back to our top area here on this menu bar and if we select the model tab this time and just move over here you can see it says spawn so this is underneath the model tab so if we click on spawn you can see a spawn has been added to the game and we can just drag this and place it on top of our lobby all right let's see what works so far let's head back to the tabs area here let's go to the Home tab and click on play now what should happen is our character should spawn on our spawn point there we go so we've created the lobby part for our Hobby now it's time to create some actual obstacles so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this part which is our lobby area I'm going to right click and I'm going to duplicate it okay you can also press Ctrl D on the keyboard but I've just made a duplicate of it and then I'm going to select the move tool up here because I want to move this part and then we're just going to drag the blue handle and I'm going to create a jump okay so this is a jump that a player is going to have to navigate now I'm going to use the scale tool up here and I'm just going to make this second part a little bit smaller okay so this is our jump we don't need to worry about the anchored property because it's still the same it's checked just like this other part because this is a duplicate so what we can now do is select the move tool again I'm going to go back and I'm going to press Ctrl D on the keyboard or command D if you're on a Mac to duplicate this jump okay I've pressed it and I'm just going to move it along here I'm going to create a few jumps this is going to be our first obstacle so you can just keep pressing the duplicate key or you can right click of course and select duplicate it's up to you I'm just going to keep on doing these for a few more jumps there we go so this is going to be our first obstacle now if you'd like you can change the color of these parts all you have to do is click on the select tool and then select the parts that you want to color and then once it's selected you see this blue box outline you then just want to head down to the properties panel and underneath brick color you can choose a color here and you can see in the corner that it's actually changing the color so I can do a red part and I can do the same for all these other ones as well so there we go I've just selected each individual part gone to the properties window down here and changed that brick color property you could also change the color property which lets you make them a little bit more detailed so it's up to you and again if you don't see the properties window or the Explorer panel do not worry all you need to do is just head up to the top left here click on view and make sure that these two are selected alright now that we've created our first obstacle I'm going to go back over here take our little platform right click duplicate it again and I'm going to use the move tool to just bring it over here so this is going to be a little rest area a little platform for our players to chill on before they take the next obstacle so let's create that next obstacle now there's going to be a choose path now you've probably seen these before it's going to be three different paths and only one of them is going to be the correct path the other two the player will fall through them if they choose that path so what I'll do is I'm going to select this part we're going to duplicate it so Ctrl D or command D and then using the move tool I'm just going to move it to the very edge here okay and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to select the scale tool because we want to change the size so using the scale tool I'm just going to make this about a third of the width of this platform here okay and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to right click duplicate select the move tool and bring it back over here okay and I'm going to do the exact same thing again right click duplicate and bring this over now just to make this in the middle of the two of the parts I'm just going to head to the model tab I'm going to uncheck this box where it says snap to grid underneath move so I'm going to uncheck move and this will just let us have some free movement it's not going to lock it to studs so I can finally set the position of this middle part now that we've got our three paths I said I only want one of them to be walkable so I'm going to select the other two paths so I want the part the path in the middle to be walkable okay now if we select this part you'll see in the properties window which controls the behavior of these parts that can Collide is set to true and this is going to be really important this part because if we just move over here so you can see it there we go so you can see this one in the middle the can Collide is set to true we want to keep that the same we want to keep this checked because can Collide means that you can walk over the parts if we were to set this can Collide property to unchecked it would mean that you'd fall straight through it when you try to walk over it so since I want this middle part to be the correct path I'm going to firstly select the other two okay so I've selected them both by holding down control or command on my keyboard I've just selected them I'm going to uncheck and Collide okay so now these two paths the one on the left and the one on the right the plan will fall straight through if they try to walk on them but of course the player doesn't know that they'll just have to try this obstacle a couple of times until they realize which path is the right one and just like before we can select each heart head to the properties window and change the brick color so I can set this one to be red this one can be green and this one can be yellow okay so now that we've done that we've created our first choose path we can do the same thing again we can just take these three blocks by using the select tool up here and we can just drag to select all four we've got three paths and one platform and then we can right click duplicate that's going to create a duplication of all four parts and then we can go back up here to use the move tool and since they're all still selected we can just move them over now I'm going to head back to the snap to grid and in the model tab here and just set that to be checked again because I want it to lock to one stood when I move it and then we can just drag our duplicate Parts over here and this time I want this uh far right part to be the correct path so I'm going to set that one's can Collide to be true down here okay and then the other two I'm going to select by holding down control or command and heading back to the properties window you can see it's got a subtract or a line through the box that means one of them's can collide one of them isn't at the moment so if I just check that if I click it sorry it's going to uncheck it so both these two the red and the green are now going to be the incorrect paths because we've set their can Collide to be false this one on the right is the correct one and I'm also going to change the colors of these because why not we can have a blue one we can have a pink one and we can have another yellow one okay and if you want you can do one more but I think two is enough just because it's going to take the player a few tries anyway to work this out so I'm going to go back and take one of my platforms over here right click duplicate I'm going to use the move tool and just bring this over here okay so there we go our second obstacle is completed let's have a quick playthrough of our hobby to make sure everything's working so I'm gonna head back up here to the Home tab and then just over here underneath the test section I'm going to click on play this is going to spawn us into the game you can see we're here at the spawn point let's give our jumps a go so are there just about five or six studs spaced out which is just enough for the player so that is a uh a tested fully tested obstacle we know that one works and then we've got our choose path so we've got the the path down the middle which is the correct one and we've got this one on the right as well which is the correct one but any other path oh oh there we go here we go yeah any other path that we that we try and walk through will just uh we'll just fall straight through and we'll die so all good it seems like the hobby is working so far let's now create our final obstacle now the final obstacle is going to be some lava jumps so I'm going to take this platform select it and then up here we're going to select the scale tool and I'm going to extend this platform to allow us to place our lava bricks on top of them now we need to insert another part so let's head back up here and choose part that's going to spawn this part on top of our platform so we can just take it move it to the edge and make it span the entire width of this platform then we can go down to the properties window and where it says brick color we can set that to Red I'm also going to set the material to be neon if you have a look you can see I've now got a bright shiny red lava Block in fact I'm going to make this a little bit harder and extend the width and height of this lava jump alright now I'm just going to go back and select the move tool and I'm just going to space this out a little bit so the player's got some room and then I'm going to keep right clicking and duplicating to place down some more lava bricks all right so here are all my lava bricks but there's one last thing we need to do we need to make the player die when they step on these lava jumps so how do we do that well it's rather easy all we need to do is Select them all so I'll select one two three four holding down control or command if you're on a Mac so they're all selected and then in the Explorer panel I'm going to right click and select group as a folder then in the properties window I can name this folder lava bricks and then all we now need to do is back in the Explorer if we go to server script service we'll click on this plus and search for a script now make sure you insert this gray script here and then you'll see the code editor has opened up I'm just going to hide this Banner here and even if you've not written any code before don't worry we're just going to write some simple code which will make the player die when they step on a lava brick so here's the code you need to write so here is the code firstly you don't have to write out these green comments they're just there to help explain what's going on so firstly we create a variable to easily reference our folder over here in the workspace we then Loop through every single lava brick in that folder and for each one we detect when the lava brick has been stepped on which gives us the object that touched the brick now it could be a player it could be some other object in the game so we have to make sure that it is a player by doing a check here which will return true or false and if it is a potential player then we're going to set the health of that player's humanoid which is in their character to zero which is going to kill them now there'll be a link to this code in the description alternatively you can just pause the video and copy it out for yourself but make sure that you spell everything correctly just like I have here because a simple typo can cause your script to break now for this to work you'll have to make sure that all of your parts are in a folder called lava bricks with a space in between the lava and bricks and obviously a capital l and capital B for lava and Bricks but once you've done that your lava bricks should be good to go now let's see if they work I'm going to click on play here up here underneath the Home tab that will teleport you to the exact location where you want to spawn so if you click on that little arrow underneath play here and select play here because you may be set to play rather than play here it will spawn you wherever your character what your camera is facing so if you just move your camera over here you will spawn at the lava bricks and now if we step on our lava bricks you can see it kills us so we've got our three obstacles here and it takes us back to the start when you finish now you may be wondering how to add checkpoints and I actually made another video showing how to do this and I'll be creating an updated version in the meantime as well so I'll leave a link to that for you to go and watch but that's it for this video you've just learned how to make a very simple Hobby in Roblox studio in just
