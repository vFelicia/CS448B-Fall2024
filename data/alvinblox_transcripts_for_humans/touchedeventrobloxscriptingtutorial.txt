00:00 - how to use the touched event to detect
00:03 - when a player steps on a part in Roblox
00:06 - so firstly we're going to insert a part
00:08 - and then we'll just move it over here
00:10 - and we'll insert a script inside of the
00:12 - part the script doesn't have to go
00:14 - inside of it but just for Simplicity
00:16 - we'll put it there so in that case we
00:18 - will have to reference the part by
00:20 - saying script. parent. part sorry
00:23 - script. parent s just script. parent uh
00:26 - and then we'll say script. par. touched
00:28 - code on connect
00:30 - function and this will now fire when
00:33 - something steps on the part or touches
00:36 - it now this could be anything right it
00:38 - could be another part that just Falls
00:40 - onto the part for some reason uh it
00:43 - could be the spawn it could be the base
00:44 - plate it literally could be anything so
00:47 - how do we work out whether this is a
00:50 - player well we know that the the part
00:53 - that touches this main part here is
00:55 - going to get passed to this event okay
00:57 - so we could call this other parts you
01:00 - might see it sometimes referred to as
01:02 - hit because it's the thing that hit the
01:04 - part but you can name it whatever you
01:06 - want right but we're just going to call
01:07 - it other
01:09 - part and this is definitely going to be
01:13 - um a part okay this will only fire if
01:16 - another part touches it it could be a
01:19 - body part of another player okay it
01:21 - could be a part inside a model so we've
01:24 - now got the part how do we actually
01:26 - detect that this is a player well we
01:29 - know that that if it is a player if it
01:32 - is a body part of a player let me just
01:34 - show you here let me insert a uh rig
01:38 - into the game so we have this character
01:41 - here this is a typical Roblox Avatar and
01:44 - let's imagine that the right hand okay
01:46 - this blue right hand is the thing that
01:49 - touches our part well if this is a
01:51 - player we know that the
01:54 - player has a humanoid in their character
01:57 - so this is the first thing we could do
01:59 - we could say okay
02:00 - so does the model of that character if
02:04 - other parts parent so we've now got the
02:07 - model if it has a
02:11 - humanoid then we know it's a player or
02:15 - do we because this would pass as a
02:19 - player in this case but this is just an
02:21 - NPC it's got the same makeup as a player
02:25 - but it's a static NPC we're just
02:27 - assuming that this is a real player
02:29 - because it's got a humanoid inside of it
02:32 - so whilst this is a good way of working
02:34 - out if this is an NPC or if it's a
02:37 - player it's not the best way so let me
02:41 - show you another way and that other way
02:44 - is called get player from character so
02:47 - there's a built-in function to Roblox
02:49 - which lets us pass a character's model
02:52 - object and if a player exists for that
02:55 - character it will return it to us so
02:58 - we'll create a variable because it's
03:00 - going to either return the player or
03:02 - it's going to return nil so we'll just
03:03 - store that as a variable we're going to
03:06 - say game do players colon get player
03:09 - from character and as you can see it
03:13 - says Returns the player whose character
03:17 - matches the given instance or nil if one
03:20 - can't be
03:21 - found so we're going to pass other
03:24 - parts.
03:26 - parent okay and then we can say if
03:29 - player
03:30 - then and by the time we get to here we
03:33 - know for certain that a player exists
03:37 - and that a player has touched our part
03:41 - so from here you can do whatever you
03:42 - like okay you can then get that
03:45 - character by
03:47 - saying player. character alternatively
03:50 - you could say other part. parent but
03:53 - since we've got the player we can just
03:55 - say player. character and then you can
03:57 - do whatever you want so if you wanted to
03:58 - kill the player for example you could
04:00 - say character uh do head col on Destroy
04:04 - and because that disconnects the head
04:06 - and kills the player so let's just give
04:08 - this a little test let's click on play
04:12 - here and here we are now I just want to
04:14 - show you look what happens if let's just
04:17 - keep the output window open as well just
04:19 - in case we get any errors but look look
04:21 - what happens when I put already Pro onto
04:24 - my part okay so there's now an NPC
04:28 - touching my part but nothing's happening
04:31 - the the NPC hasn't been killed because
04:34 - it is not a real player because the
04:37 - script attempted to do that get player
04:39 - from character check and it returned nil
04:41 - because if you look in the players's
04:43 - service there's only my player and this
04:47 - is the distinction between a player and
04:49 - a character because a player is what is
04:51 - stored in the player's service however
04:53 - the character is stored in the workspace
04:56 - so the get player from character is
04:58 - looking for a player in the players
05:00 - service which has the character
05:03 - connected to it and since this is an NPC
05:06 - it's not a real player it has no objects
05:09 - in the player's service however if I try
05:13 - and step on this part because I'm a real
05:15 - player it kills me okay and just ignore
05:18 - these errors here uh that's just because
05:21 - it is firing multiple times okay when I
05:24 - step on this part it's firing for every
05:27 - single body part that touches this part
05:29 - right it's for my lower legs my upper
05:31 - legs my hands might touch it and it's
05:33 - touching it over and over and over again
05:35 - but after the first time it's touched
05:38 - well the head has already been destroyed
05:39 - so it's not there anymore hence why is
05:41 - returning an error which says head is
05:44 - not a valid member of model but if you
05:46 - wanted to prevent this you could do
05:48 - something called a debounce and that
05:50 - essentially lets your function here only
05:54 - execute the code once every couple of
05:56 - seconds to prevent it from spam uh
05:59 - executing and printing all the time or
06:01 - throwing errors and to do that we just
06:03 - create a variable called debounce we'll
06:06 - set it to false for now and then in the
06:08 - function we can simply say um in fact we
06:12 - do it inside our if statement because by
06:15 - that point we know it's an actual player
06:17 - and we'll say if debounce then return
06:21 - end and that just prevents the script
06:23 - from going any further if the debounce
06:26 - value is true so this condition if you
06:28 - just say debounce that just means okay
06:30 - if it's true so after that we have to
06:32 - set it to be true and then down here we
06:36 - can just do a simple task. we of say 3
06:39 - seconds set the debounce to false again
06:42 - and once that debounce variable turns
06:44 - false it will it will let us run this
06:47 - code again because the next time the the
06:50 - the Brick is touched the debounce value
06:52 - will be false so this condition will not
06:54 - run so the the function will not return
06:57 - it will carry on and it will let us kill
06:59 - the player so let's just head straight
07:00 - back in and try this one more
07:02 - time and I'm going to step on the brick
07:05 - and you can see it's killed me once it's
07:07 - executed once it's not tried to run that
07:10 - code again but since 3 seconds have now
07:12 - passed it will let me step on it again
07:15 - so that was a brief introduction on how
07:17 - to create a part that you can step on
07:20 - using the touched event in Roblox studio
07:23 - and also a brief look into get player
07:25 - from character and also DB bounces if

that hit the part but you can name it whatever you want right but we're just going to call it other part and this is definitely going to be um a part okay this will only fire if another part touches it it could be a body part of another player okay it could be a part inside a model so we've now got the part how do we actually detect that this is a player well we know that that if it is a player if it is a body part of a player let me just show you here let me insert a uh rig into the game so we have this character here this is a typical Roblox Avatar and let's imagine that the right hand okay this blue right hand is the thing that touches our part well if this is a player we know that the player has a humanoid in their character so this is the first thing we could do we could say okay so does the model of that character if other parts parent so we've now got the model if it has a humanoid then we know it's a player or do we because this would pass as a player in this case but this is just an NPC it's got the same makeup as a player but it's a static NPC we're just assuming that this is a real player because it's got a humanoid inside of it so whilst this is a good way of

that a player has touched our part so from here you can do whatever you like okay you can then get that character by saying player. character alternatively you could say other part. parent but since we've got the player we can just say player. character and then you can do whatever you want so if you wanted to kill the player for example you could say character uh do head col on Destroy and

it's killed me once it's executed once it's not tried to run that code again but since 3 seconds have now passed it will let me step on it again so that was a brief introduction on how to create a
