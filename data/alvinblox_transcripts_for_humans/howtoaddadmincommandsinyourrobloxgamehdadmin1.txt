00:01 - how to add HD admin commands to your
00:05 - game now HD admin is a model and allows
00:08 - you to execute a wide range of commands
00:11 - within your game which unlocks a variety
00:14 - of new features and even enables you to
00:16 - earn a row books with minimal setup and
00:19 - difficulty so let's go ahead and get
00:22 - straight into the video alright so the
00:26 - first thing that you're gonna want to do
00:28 - to get HT admin is you want to take the
00:30 - model now I'm gonna leave a link to this
00:33 - model in the description so go ahead and
00:35 - click on the link and then you'll be
00:37 - taken to this page all you need to do is
00:39 - click on get and then get now and the
00:43 - model will be added to your inventory so
00:46 - next you're gonna want to open up a
00:48 - roblox studio so we can add this into
00:50 - your game so go ahead and open it up
00:54 - once your game is open up we're gonna go
00:56 - to the toolbox then I'm in the models
01:00 - we're gonna click on my models and the
01:02 - admin commands should be there so just
01:04 - click on them to add them to your game
01:07 - and in the Explorer panel which you can
01:10 - open up by going to view Explorer you'll
01:13 - see that we've got this folder called HD
01:15 - admin ok and if we go into this folder
01:18 - here you can see we've got a few items
01:20 - in here now we're gonna be focusing on
01:22 - the settings module and you've also got
01:26 - a folder here called custom features now
01:28 - we'll be going over these in more detail
01:31 - in the next videos but the settings
01:34 - module is where you can personalize the
01:36 - admin system for your own needs so for
01:38 - example giving specific ranks to players
01:41 - linking roblox groups to the admin and
01:44 - also things like setting up game passes
01:46 - and which I said we will be going over
01:48 - in a future videos so all that we're
01:51 - gonna do for now is we're going to just
01:52 - publish the game so I'm going to click
01:54 - on file and I'm gonna go publish to
01:57 - roblox as and I'm just going to publish
02:00 - this to a game which I've already
02:02 - created if you want to publish it to a
02:04 - new game of course you can do that as
02:06 - well so I'm gonna go ahead and publish
02:08 - this then I'm gonna copy the link to the
02:10 - game and we're gonna head in and
02:13 - get out okay so we're in the game and
02:16 - you can see in bottom right corner a
02:18 - notification has popped up saying your
02:20 - rank is owner click to view the commands
02:23 - so you don't need to worry about adding
02:25 - yourself into the admin because it is
02:28 - automatically going to give you the
02:30 - owner rank as I own the game or you so
02:34 - what I'm going to do just gonna have a
02:35 - look round in the HD admin and show you
02:37 - what you can do with it so what I'm
02:40 - going to do good open up the main menu
02:42 - and to do this you can click on the HD
02:44 - logo in the top left of the screen and
02:46 - this brings up the the panel okay and we
02:50 - have got five different sections the
02:52 - About section command section special
02:55 - admin and settings in about you can take
02:59 - the model if you haven't already and you
03:01 - can also get in contact with the team
03:03 - that made this admin command system
03:05 - through their social media channels in
03:08 - the commands section you can view a list
03:10 - of all available commands that you can
03:13 - use now you'll see that the commands
03:15 - here are grouped to a different rank so
03:18 - we've got non admin VIP etc and the
03:21 - commands they become more abusive as you
03:24 - go down the list so for example a VIP
03:26 - wouldn't be able to do too much damage
03:29 - but if we look at say like an owner they
03:31 - can do things that just crash the server
03:33 - shut it down etc so if you want to find
03:36 - out some more information about our
03:38 - command you can either search it or find
03:39 - it in the list so I'm just going to have
03:41 - a look at the kill command so I'm just
03:43 - going to search that and if we click it
03:45 - you'll see it gives us some information
03:48 - about that command to execute a command
03:51 - just say the prefix which is by default
03:55 - set to a semicolon and then you just
03:58 - want to write the name of the command so
04:00 - in this case we're gonna do jump which
04:02 - will make my pledge jump up into the air
04:03 - and then you want to write the player
04:06 - who you want this command to be
04:08 - performed on so if you want to do it to
04:10 - yourself just write me and that will
04:12 - make yourself jump but if you want to do
04:14 - it to another player you could say jump
04:17 - and then their name so in this case
04:20 - Alvin underscore blocks and that would
04:22 - do the same but you can choose who to do
04:24 - it to but you don't have to enter the
04:26 - full
04:26 - name of a player so for example you
04:29 - could just say jump out and that all do
04:31 - the same as long as you know there's not
04:33 - a more than one player who has the same
04:36 - prefix in their name so if you had Alvin
04:39 - 1 and Alvin - and you said jump owl you
04:41 - need to make sure that you know who you
04:44 - want to do it you don't need to worry
04:46 - about cases either so you could do it in
04:48 - in uppercase or lowercase let's just
04:50 - show you this you could say jump in up
04:53 - and down and then you can write their
04:55 - name as well like that and it does the
04:57 - same as well as this you can also run
04:59 - multiple commands at once so we can say
05:02 - sparkles me fire me and explode me I
05:06 - will run all three commands at the same
05:09 - time so we've got aliases which are
05:12 - other words which you can use instead of
05:14 - saying kill but it will still execute
05:16 - the same command so I could say die me
05:19 - instead of kill me at the description
05:21 - obviously tells you more about the
05:23 - command the rack is the required rank
05:26 - needed to execute this command so in
05:29 - order to kill someone you need to be a
05:31 - mod or higher and we've also got the
05:34 - loop here so if a command is a loopable
05:37 - so we can run it over and over again and
05:39 - if I wanted to kill myself multiple
05:42 - times just loop it indefinitely I could
05:45 - say my prefix which is a semicolon and
05:48 - then kill but instead of just saying
05:50 - kill I'm gonna add a loop before it so
05:52 - we're gonna say loop kill and then the
05:54 - name of the player that you want to loop
05:56 - kill so in this case that's going to be
05:59 - me okay we'll just start killing me over
06:03 - and over again until I break the loop
06:05 - and to break the loop you can say
06:08 - refresh and then the player that you
06:10 - want to break the loop okay so we can
06:12 - just say refresh me and that will just
06:16 - stop the loop from killing me okay so
06:20 - that is looping a command if you want to
06:22 - loop it for a set number of iterations
06:25 - so say 10 times you can do the same
06:27 - thing so let's say loop kill me fine
06:32 - okay and that's just gonna kill me five
06:35 - times in a row okay so I'm just gonna
06:37 - refresh myself again to break that loop
06:40 - if you'd like to undo a command that's
06:42 - pretty simple as well for example if we
06:44 - go ahead and do fire to give ourselves
06:46 - some fire you can see that if I wanted
06:49 - to undo that and get rid of the fire
06:51 - I can just say own fire me and there you
06:56 - go the fire has been removed from my
06:58 - character that is the end of part 1 in
07:01 - this series and how to set up HD admin
07:03 - now if you're interested in how to set
07:06 - up ranks for other players in your game
07:08 - then you're gonna want to go to part 2
07:10 - and the link to that video is on your
