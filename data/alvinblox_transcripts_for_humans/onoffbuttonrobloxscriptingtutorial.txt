00:00 - so to create a button which you can
00:02 - toggle on and off firstly we'll create
00:05 - the screen GUI and I'm just going to
00:07 - insert a text button and I'm going to
00:09 - drag it over here now the purpose of
00:11 - this button is that you'll be able to
00:13 - toggle it on and off and so we'll store
00:16 - the value of that button and depending
00:18 - on whether it's on or off you can make
00:21 - some action occur such as turning a
00:23 - light on or off but for the purpose of
00:25 - this video we'll just be storing the
00:27 - value you can do whatever you like with
00:29 - that value you could change the um
00:32 - visibility of a UI or you could like I
00:35 - say turn a light on or you could
00:37 - teleport a player you could do all sorts
00:39 - of things so we're going to by default
00:42 - want to have this button set to off so
00:45 - we're going to set the text to be off
00:47 - and I'm going to insert a local script
00:50 - inside this text button now whenever
00:54 - this text button is clicked so script.
00:57 - parent Mouse button one click connect
01:00 - to a function we want to change the
01:05 - onoff toggle value so we'll store this
01:10 - as an attribute now you could store this
01:13 - as a variable but because we might want
01:15 - to access the value from another script
01:20 - we're going to set it as an attribute so
01:21 - I'm going to go to the
01:23 - Explorer and I don't know what happened
01:25 - there let's just head back there we go
01:27 - let's go to the Explorer and let's
01:29 - scroll down to the attributes down here
01:32 - and I'm going to click on the click on
01:34 - the plus if I can get my words out and
01:37 - we're going to name this um toggle I'm
01:40 - going to call it toggle and it's going
01:42 - to be a Boolean so I'll click on Save
01:44 - and then we will inside this function we
01:49 - will say script. parent set attributes
01:53 - toggle and we're going to set that to
01:56 - the opposite of what it currently is so
01:58 - let's just get the current value
02:00 - by saying script. parent get attribute
02:06 - toggle like
02:08 - so and we want to get the inverse of it
02:11 - so we can say not script. parent get
02:14 - attribute toggle and that's going to set
02:16 - the attribute to the opposite of what it
02:18 - currently is so that is toggling it we
02:21 - now need to update the text of the
02:23 - button so we can say script. parent.
02:25 - text equals and then we can get the
02:28 - value the attribute and if it's
02:32 - true then we can
02:34 - say on or off like this okay so we'll
02:38 - just put this into brackets to make it a
02:41 - little easier to read so if this is true
02:44 - then it will return and otherwise it
02:47 - will return off and that's it really one
02:50 - other thing you can do is you can have
02:51 - this line at the beginning of your
02:53 - script outside of the event and if you
02:56 - don't set the text manually
02:58 - yourself it it will update it for you so
03:01 - let's click on the play button and see
03:04 - what happens here so you can see it's
03:06 - pre-loaded the off text because I just
03:08 - removed it and if I click the button the
03:10 - toggle is now on and I can toggle on off
03:13 - on off and if you have a look at our
03:16 - toggle button just going to search for
03:18 - it in the Explorer we scroll down you
03:21 - can see the attribute down here is
03:24 - changing between on and off checked and
03:27 - unchecked so that's how you make the
03:29 - toggle button how do you then do some
03:32 - kind of action so for example turning a
03:34 - light on let's just imagine we have this
03:36 - part which is our
03:38 - light okay and what I'm going to do is
03:41 - I'm going to
03:43 - create a function which will turn the
03:48 - light on so we'll just call it toggle
03:50 - light and we'll take the value true or
03:53 - false as to whether to turn it on or not
03:55 - and then we can say game. workspace do
03:58 - light do color
04:01 - equals
04:04 - toggle so if the toggle is true we will
04:06 - give it
04:08 - a brick color of new yellow which is
04:14 - yellow or we will just give it a brick
04:18 - color of um medium Stone gray which I
04:23 - believe is the default gray color for a
04:26 - new part so this function will toggle
04:30 - the color of our light part so we can
04:34 - just then call this
04:36 - function and pass the new value okay so
04:41 - the new value will have been set up here
04:44 - so we're just getting that new value and
04:46 - passing it to our function and then you
04:48 - can do anything really all you need to
04:50 - do is just to check to see if the toggle
04:53 - value is true now I'm using a shortened
04:56 - way um of setting the brick color here
04:59 - because I'm using this toggle and value
05:02 - or value which means if it's true then
05:05 - return this value otherwise if it's any
05:07 - other value such as false return this
05:10 - value which is exactly the same as just
05:12 - saying if
05:13 - toggle then else you know you get the
05:18 - idea it's just condensing it all into
05:20 - one line but let's go ahead and just try
05:22 - this out what we what you might also
05:25 - want to do is call toggle light outside
05:29 - of the event just like I've done here
05:31 - with the text because of course the
05:34 - value could be set to on when the game
05:36 - starts and you'll want to toggle that
05:38 - that light to make sure it is turned on
05:42 - when the game starts to retain its
05:45 - current value so we'll click on play one
05:48 - more time and hopefully our light should
05:50 - be in perfect working order so I'm going
05:53 - to click on button and the part becomes
05:56 - illuminated and we can turn it off and
05:58 - on and on and off off and it all seems
06:00 - to be working and again you can do
06:02 - anything you like here if you wanted to
06:04 - you could set the time of day to toggle
06:09 - and 12:00
06:12 - or nighttime I think this is how you set
06:16 - the time of day I haven't used it for
06:18 - ages so we'll just hope for the
06:21 - best yes okay so it is it's night I
06:25 - click on the the button it's now daytime
06:27 - okay so that is how you create a toggle
06:30 - button in Roblox now all of this code
06:32 - has been client side of course you might
06:35 - want to have buttons which execute some
06:37 - code on the server all you'd have to do
06:39 - is use a remote event and pass the new
06:42 - toggle value okay or you might want to
06:45 - store that toggle value on the server
06:47 - and change it on the server it's up to
06:48 - you anyway that is it for this video on
06:51 - how to make a toggle button I hope you
06:52 - enjoyed it if you did please leave a
06:55 - like don't forget to subscribe let me
06:57 - know if you have any other videos you'd
06:58 - like me to see and I'll catch you in the
