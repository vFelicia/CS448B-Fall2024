00:00 - welcome to the first scripting tutorial
00:02 - in this series so this series is gonna
00:05 - teach you how to script on roblox it
00:08 - doesn't matter whether you are a
00:09 - beginner you have a little bit of
00:10 - knowledge or there are just a few things
00:12 - which you want to learn you don't
00:14 - already this series is for anyone really
00:16 - and we're gonna be going over in detail
00:19 - everything to do with roblox scripting
00:22 - so that you can become a pro alright so
00:26 - let's open up our box to do if you don't
00:28 - have it installed you can go get it from
00:30 - roblox
00:31 - although if you played a robot's game
00:32 - before chances are it's probably
00:33 - installed on your computer I've also got
00:36 - another video going over the basics of
00:37 - studio and how to install it which I'll
00:39 - link in the card and description but
00:41 - let's go and open it up and usually to
00:44 - wait it's usually quite quick you might
00:48 - have to login if it's your first time
00:49 - but don't worry if you see a screen like
00:51 - this as well just ignore it we're gonna
00:54 - go and click on baseplate and that will
00:56 - just give us a blank area to work in
00:59 - okay so in this video the first video in
01:03 - the series we're going to be looking at
01:05 - properties and what properties are to
01:08 - begin with you need to have these two
01:11 - panels enabled okay these two panels are
01:16 - the Explorer panel and the properties
01:18 - panel and to enable them you need to
01:20 - click on View at the top in this ribbon
01:23 - menu and then you should just be able to
01:26 - click Explorer and properties and that
01:28 - will open them up like this okay so the
01:31 - Explorer and properties window they are
01:34 - the most important panels you'll be
01:37 - using when you create games and the
01:40 - Explorer lets you search for and see all
01:43 - of the objects stored in your game and
01:45 - the properties window lets you change
01:49 - them so how they look or how they
01:52 - function okay so properties there are
01:56 - lots of different objects in roblox
02:00 - studio ok to get a list of all these
02:03 - objects you can go on the model tab and
02:05 - click on advanced objects just make that
02:09 - a little bit bigger and here we go there
02:11 - are loads of
02:13 - objects which you can insert into your
02:15 - game they do different things
02:17 - now each objects will have properties
02:19 - which contain which contains information
02:22 - about what they do how they look
02:26 - etc okay so we're going to insert a part
02:30 - to begin with all right so you can
02:33 - either insert a part by finding it in
02:35 - advanced objects you can either look for
02:37 - it or search for at the top or you can
02:40 - just click on parts over here okay and
02:43 - that's just one way what a few ways to
02:45 - insert a part so we're going to be
02:47 - focusing on a part today we're going to
02:49 - worry about all these other objects
02:51 - we'll get to them in a future video but
02:53 - we're going to be using a script to
02:55 - manipulate and do some cool things with
02:58 - this part by changing its properties so
03:00 - to have a look at a part or any other
03:04 - objects properties you just need to
03:06 - select it okay so you can click it or
03:08 - you can locate it in the workspace for
03:11 - example if you didn't know where this
03:12 - part was or you have lots of parts in
03:15 - your games and it was hard to find a
03:16 - certain one you could just look in the
03:18 - workspace or you could search for it
03:20 - okay and that will find all of the
03:24 - objects with the name that you searched
03:26 - for so once you've found your parts you
03:29 - can press F on the keyboard and that
03:31 - will move the camera directly to to this
03:34 - object so you can see we have lots of
03:38 - properties in the properties window so
03:41 - we have properties for its appearance
03:43 - which change how the part looks such as
03:47 - the color of the brick you have brick
03:49 - color which is a set of colors from from
03:52 - a palette which you can choose from or
03:53 - if you want a more detailed color you
03:55 - can awfully pick one in this RGB picker
03:58 - things like material as well you can
04:00 - change the material of the part
04:02 - reflectance as well which if I set it to
04:05 - something like smooth plastic it's
04:07 - basically reflecting the light in the
04:09 - game say from from the Sun and things
04:12 - like transparency as well we've got data
04:15 - properties such as the name of the parts
04:17 - so I could change the name to be hello
04:20 - and you can see the name of the part
04:23 - that's changed so that's what we
04:25 - reference with we reference the name to
04:28 - find the specific parts we've also got
04:31 - orientation which basically is the
04:33 - amount of degrees it's been rotated if
04:35 - you use the tools up here things like
04:37 - position velocity we won't really get
04:39 - into that today but we have some
04:42 - important properties which you need to
04:44 - know
04:44 - okay so anchored is a property and the
04:48 - anchored property if it is set to if
04:52 - it's checked then the part is going to
04:55 - stay in the air okay it's gonna stay
04:56 - fixed in the air but if we set anchored
04:59 - to unchecked it's gonna fall out of the
05:01 - sky okay so anchor just means that it's
05:03 - it's locked in its position and it's not
05:05 - going to be affected by say like
05:08 - collisions if it if it hits something
05:10 - then this brick isn't going to move
05:12 - because it's it's it's frozen in the air
05:14 - we've got can collide and can collide is
05:18 - it determines whether a part will
05:21 - collide with another part if it hits
05:23 - something okay so we've got count
05:25 - collide set to true on both of these
05:27 - parts now let's just change the color if
05:30 - I get this part and I uncheck can
05:32 - collide then the red part is going to
05:34 - just fall into it like this okay in fact
05:38 - the green part fell out of the world
05:39 - because it's not colliding with the base
05:41 - plate either so they are important
05:45 - properties which you need to know and
05:47 - we've also got size but we're not going
05:48 - to focus on on those today there they
05:51 - are just some simple properties and you
05:53 - can see that by changing these
05:55 - properties the part looks and acts in a
05:59 - different way okay let's just make it
06:01 - transparent and sorry opaque and not
06:05 - reflective but we had to manually change
06:08 - those properties okay but in a roblox
06:11 - game that's running we can't just
06:15 - manually change these properties we have
06:17 - to use a script because a script can
06:20 - automatically change these properties
06:22 - for us and automate our game every
06:26 - roblox game that you play such as
06:28 - jailbreak or death run has got a script
06:31 - running behind the scenes which is
06:33 - making the game work so like running the
06:35 - rounds
06:36 - checking to see if he's worn the game
06:37 - etc and it's always changing properties
06:41 - because properties is one of the most
06:44 - basic things you need to know to even
06:46 - get scripting so a script allows us to
06:49 - carry a carry out tasks in a specific
06:53 - order we can tell the game what we want
06:56 - to happen and then the game will be able
06:58 - to do these things and run itself
07:01 - automatically so let's insert a script
07:04 - into server script service so we're
07:06 - going to click on the plus and then
07:08 - click script we're not going to do
07:10 - module script just a script okay now as
07:14 - I said a script will carry out tasks in
07:17 - order
07:18 - okay so whichever line comes first that
07:21 - line will be the one which is executed
07:24 - or run first
07:26 - so to change properties of a part let's
07:30 - say we're going to change the property
07:31 - or some properties of this
07:33 - hello part which we created okay we're
07:35 - going to need to reference this part and
07:37 - reference just means tell the script
07:41 - where this part is because the script we
07:44 - can't just say hello and then we can't
07:47 - just we can just say that okay we have
07:49 - to reference it and tell the script
07:51 - where this part is located and that
07:53 - always comes first so in our script
07:55 - we're going to firstly get this part and
07:58 - to get it to reference it we firstly
08:01 - need to say where the part is stored so
08:06 - it's stored inside the workspace the
08:08 - workspace is a store for all of the
08:11 - parts and things that you see in the
08:14 - game okay for example if I take Hello
08:16 - out and I put it somewhere like
08:18 - replicated storage we can't see it okay
08:20 - so workspace is where all of the parts
08:22 - that are currently in the game world
08:24 - being rendered are okay so everything
08:27 - that you see in your game will be in the
08:31 - workspace so we just need to get this
08:36 - part which is inside of the workspace
08:37 - now the workspace is a service and there
08:41 - are loads of different services here you
08:42 - can see all of these ones here and these
08:45 - services they do lots of different
08:46 - things they house different objects for
08:48 - different reasons but all of these
08:50 - all of these services they are together
08:54 - stored inside something called the game
08:57 - okay so if you think of our services as
09:00 - being in the pink squirt square and then
09:04 - we have our game which is the outer
09:09 - scope okay so everything in the pink box
09:13 - switch sauce services such as the
09:15 - workspace the lighting etc they are a
09:18 - part of game so whenever we want to
09:21 - reference it we have to say game first
09:24 - okay so we say game and then we can do a
09:28 - dot and a dot and allows us to reference
09:32 - something that's inside of of game or
09:35 - the thing before the dot okay so if we
09:39 - said workspace okay which is after the
09:41 - dot workspace is inside of game and game
09:45 - is its parent okay
09:46 - and workspace is known as the child so
09:49 - game dot workspace we've just referenced
09:52 - the service but we now want to get the
09:55 - part called hello which is which is
09:57 - inside of the workspace now hello is
10:00 - going to be a child of the workspace as
10:02 - it's inside of it and workspace is the
10:04 - parent so we're gonna do another dot
10:06 - because we want to get something from
10:08 - the workspace and we're gonna just get
10:10 - the name of the part which is hello and
10:12 - you can see world looks to do begins to
10:15 - it begins to autofill the the result so
10:19 - we just write out hello and we have just
10:22 - referenced our part in a script it's
10:25 - just the same as selecting a part and
10:27 - now we can see all of its properties
10:29 - that we can change okay when we don't
10:31 - when we haven't clicked on a part we
10:33 - haven't referenced it and the game
10:35 - doesn't know what we want to change so
10:37 - we have to tell it what we what we want
10:39 - to change
10:39 - okay so we've selected it and now we can
10:41 - see its properties and that's that's
10:43 - pretty much the same as what we've just
10:44 - done here in the script so now if we do
10:47 - a dot
10:48 - we know that the properties are a part
10:50 - of that part of that of the brick called
10:52 - hello so if we do a dots you can see the
10:56 - script it starts to autofill all of
10:59 - these different properties which can
11:00 - change look we've got transparency
11:03 - anchored and brick color so you can
11:06 - choose any of these properties so we're
11:09 - going to we're gonna do a couple
11:11 - properties to begin with only you could
11:14 - prove oh just to keep it simple so the
11:16 - property that we're gonna change first
11:17 - is transparency okay and all properties
11:22 - aren't the same they take different
11:24 - types of data okay so for example we
11:27 - have transparency over here and you can
11:29 - see the amount of transparency which
11:32 - this part has transparency is basically
11:35 - whether it's see-through or not you can
11:38 - see it's a number so we could have 0
11:40 - which means no transparency at all we
11:42 - can't see through it or one which means
11:45 - fully transparent so any number between
11:48 - 0 and 1 is going to affect the
11:50 - transparency so not 0.5 would be half
11:52 - transparent okay so it's a number
11:55 - transparency is a number property okay
11:59 - because the value it takes which changes
12:02 - how the part looks is a number okay
12:05 - whereas something like the name property
12:07 - isn't a number it's a piece of text but
12:10 - we call a piece of text a string okay so
12:13 - if you want to change the transparency
12:15 - of this part we know we have to give it
12:17 - a number so we've referenced the
12:19 - property and now we want to set it to a
12:22 - new value and because it's a number
12:25 - we're going to say equal to so we're
12:27 - making this track this this property
12:29 - equal to a new number a new value and so
12:32 - we just put the new value after the
12:34 - equal sign so I'm gonna set it to 1
12:37 - which means fully transparent okay now
12:40 - if we just go back to the game and we
12:44 - select our parts let's just set it to
12:48 - completely opaque so we can we can't see
12:52 - through it and now we can run our script
12:55 - to see if we've successfully been able
12:58 - to change the transparency so we're
13:01 - going to click on the Home tab here and
13:04 - then click on this arrow which is
13:07 - underneath run it might say play so
13:09 - click on the arrow and click on run run
13:11 - basically lets us run all the scripts in
13:14 - our game without having to join it so
13:17 - let's click run
13:18 - and there we go the part has gone fully
13:20 - transparent and we can see through it
13:22 - but it doesn't mean that the parts been
13:23 - deleted it's still there we just can't
13:25 - see through it because we can select it
13:27 - in the workspace and look it's still
13:29 - there and if we go ahead and change the
13:31 - transparency again you can see one it's
13:33 - at the end of the spectrum and as we
13:35 - move it further to the left
13:38 - it becomes opaque again and that script
13:40 - is only ran once once it's finished
13:43 - setting the transparency it will see
13:45 - that there's no lines left to execute so
13:49 - it will just stop running okay so that
13:51 - is a very very simple property
13:53 - transparency but I said there were other
13:55 - data types which properties take because
13:59 - not all properties are going to take a
14:01 - number for example the material property
14:04 - that is text but you can also select
14:09 - them from a drop-down so there are two
14:11 - ways to set the material of a of a part
14:16 - so we're just going to get rid of the
14:18 - dock transparency but this time we're
14:20 - going to set the material now the first
14:22 - way is just by putting the text okay the
14:25 - name of the material in quotation marks
14:28 - or speech marks okay so if this is
14:33 - smooth plastic that it's currently on
14:35 - and we want to set it to grass we could
14:37 - just write grass in here okay and if we
14:40 - go and run the game it's sure to change
14:42 - the property to grass there we go and if
14:46 - we click on the part again and have a
14:48 - look in the properties tab the script
14:50 - has automatically changed it to grass
14:52 - for us okay now the second way of doing
14:55 - this is by using an enum okay so an enum
14:58 - is kind of like it gives you a list of
15:01 - properties to choose from so you could
15:03 - write enum and then you could say dot
15:06 - and you then have to write the name of
15:09 - the property okay so I know we've
15:11 - written out before but we have to write
15:12 - out again for enum so when we write out
15:15 - and then do another dot it will give us
15:16 - a list of all of the materials just like
15:19 - when we typed in the property name sorry
15:21 - the the name of the parts it gave us a
15:23 - list of properties before we wrote the
15:26 - property so you can select a property so
15:29 - material here such as wood
15:31 - that will do the exact same thing okay
15:33 - it will set the property so there's two
15:35 - ways for you and can choose whichever
15:37 - one works for you I prefer doing it this
15:39 - way because it gives you a list of
15:40 - materials but you can you can use enums
15:43 - for all types of properties well all
15:46 - types of like drop-down properties like
15:47 - this okay where you can select one from
15:50 - from a list and we you also have brick
15:54 - color so there's two ways to change the
15:56 - color of parts so you could either do
15:58 - brick color and brick color lets you set
16:01 - a preset color which from this palette
16:04 - okay if you click on brick color you can
16:06 - see a list of all these colors and each
16:08 - color has a name which represents its
16:10 - RGB value an RGB value is just a set of
16:13 - three values red green and blue and it
16:16 - makes it one big color but brick color
16:18 - is simpler than that
16:19 - and it just gives you the name of the
16:20 - color so to set a brick color we
16:23 - obviously have to say the name of the
16:24 - property but we can't say it in speech
16:27 - marks like this because brick color is a
16:29 - special type of property and we have to
16:31 - say Bricker dot new because because it's
16:35 - roblox's color palette and this is the
16:37 - way of picking the color so you say
16:39 - brick color and then you say dot new the
16:41 - new in lowercase and then you have a set
16:44 - of parentheses or brackets after it and
16:46 - then in quotation marks or speech marks
16:48 - inside of these brackets you can write
16:51 - the name of the color but it has to be a
16:53 - color from their palette and has to be
16:55 - spelled correctly with the
16:57 - capitalization correct as well you can
16:59 - see we have a capital R for really but
17:01 - then it goes lower case for red now if
17:03 - we go and try this out you can see the
17:05 - part that goes red alright and there's
17:08 - one more way of changing the color with
17:10 - this color palette if you wanted to give
17:11 - an RGB value so instead of saying brick
17:14 - color you could just say color and don't
17:16 - forget this is the American spelling so
17:18 - those of you that are British we spell
17:20 - it with a u you have to spell it Co lor
17:23 - the american way so when we set a color
17:26 - we can say color 3 because a color 3
17:30 - value is made up of three RGB values ok
17:33 - color 3 and then we can say dot from RGB
17:37 - and then we can give a number between 0
17:40 - and 255 for each color so the amount of
17:43 - red the amount of blue and
17:45 - Green and it will mix it together kind
17:47 - of imagine it like paints if you're
17:49 - mixing red green and blue paint you're
17:51 - also gonna get a color right so if you
17:54 - did 255 comma zero comma zero that would
17:57 - be completely red but um you shouldn't
17:59 - really have to understand this for now
18:00 - I'm just showing you how color 3 works
18:03 - and you can see if I choose a color on
18:06 - the color picker it gives me a red value
18:07 - green value and a blue value so 255 one
18:10 - five seven and thirty seven one five
18:14 - seven and thirty seven and that should
18:17 - give us the orange car yeah there we go
18:19 - so that's how you change the color now
18:22 - there's one last type of property I want
18:24 - to show you and that is the behavior
18:26 - properties so anchored archivable can
18:30 - collide locked masses etc they're all
18:33 - check boxes and a check box is either on
18:36 - or off so true or false so there's two
18:39 - values you can choose from and this is a
18:40 - boolean value a boolean value is either
18:44 - true or false it can't be anything else
18:46 - so if it's true then it's gonna be what
18:51 - if we were looking at the anchored
18:52 - property for example
18:54 - okay anchored and we set this to true if
18:57 - it's true then it means yes it is
18:59 - anchored but if it's false think of it
19:01 - as being unchecked or not I'm good
19:03 - so if we keep anchored as false and we
19:06 - lift it up into the air and we run the
19:07 - game it's going to fall straight to the
19:09 - ground but if we change anchor to true
19:12 - which means it is anchored and the
19:14 - anchored property is turned off then
19:16 - there you go it stays up in the air and
19:18 - you can see again in the properties
19:20 - window we have managed to change the
19:22 - property from script now you may be
19:24 - thinking this is really really simple
19:26 - can we just get into the really good
19:27 - stuff I know it's done that but we have
19:30 - to really go really really simple to
19:32 - begin with with the properties because
19:34 - then we can do really really cool stuff
19:36 - in the future use need to make sure you
19:38 - have a good understanding of how to
19:39 - reference okay by saying the service and
19:43 - then getting the name of the parts
19:44 - parents children and the property as
19:47 - well okay I think we're gonna leave it

Cleaned transcript:

welcome to the first scripting tutorial in this series so this series is gonna teach you how to script on roblox it doesn't matter whether you are a beginner you have a little bit of knowledge or there are just a few things which you want to learn you don't already this series is for anyone really and we're gonna be going over in detail everything to do with roblox scripting so that you can become a pro alright so let's open up our box to do if you don't have it installed you can go get it from roblox although if you played a robot's game before chances are it's probably installed on your computer I've also got another video going over the basics of studio and how to install it which I'll link in the card and description but let's go and open it up and usually to wait it's usually quite quick you might have to login if it's your first time but don't worry if you see a screen like this as well just ignore it we're gonna go and click on baseplate and that will just give us a blank area to work in okay so in this video the first video in the series we're going to be looking at properties and what properties are to begin with you need to have these two panels enabled okay these two panels are the Explorer panel and the properties panel and to enable them you need to click on View at the top in this ribbon menu and then you should just be able to click Explorer and properties and that will open them up like this okay so the Explorer and properties window they are the most important panels you'll be using when you create games and the Explorer lets you search for and see all of the objects stored in your game and the properties window lets you change them so how they look or how they function okay so properties there are lots of different objects in roblox studio ok to get a list of all these objects you can go on the model tab and click on advanced objects just make that a little bit bigger and here we go there are loads of objects which you can insert into your game they do different things now each objects will have properties which contain which contains information about what they do how they look etc okay so we're going to insert a part to begin with all right so you can either insert a part by finding it in advanced objects you can either look for it or search for at the top or you can just click on parts over here okay and that's just one way what a few ways to insert a part so we're going to be focusing on a part today we're going to worry about all these other objects we'll get to them in a future video but we're going to be using a script to manipulate and do some cool things with this part by changing its properties so to have a look at a part or any other objects properties you just need to select it okay so you can click it or you can locate it in the workspace for example if you didn't know where this part was or you have lots of parts in your games and it was hard to find a certain one you could just look in the workspace or you could search for it okay and that will find all of the objects with the name that you searched for so once you've found your parts you can press F on the keyboard and that will move the camera directly to to this object so you can see we have lots of properties in the properties window so we have properties for its appearance which change how the part looks such as the color of the brick you have brick color which is a set of colors from from a palette which you can choose from or if you want a more detailed color you can awfully pick one in this RGB picker things like material as well you can change the material of the part reflectance as well which if I set it to something like smooth plastic it's basically reflecting the light in the game say from from the Sun and things like transparency as well we've got data properties such as the name of the parts so I could change the name to be hello and you can see the name of the part that's changed so that's what we reference with we reference the name to find the specific parts we've also got orientation which basically is the amount of degrees it's been rotated if you use the tools up here things like position velocity we won't really get into that today but we have some important properties which you need to know okay so anchored is a property and the anchored property if it is set to if it's checked then the part is going to stay in the air okay it's gonna stay fixed in the air but if we set anchored to unchecked it's gonna fall out of the sky okay so anchor just means that it's it's locked in its position and it's not going to be affected by say like collisions if it if it hits something then this brick isn't going to move because it's it's it's frozen in the air we've got can collide and can collide is it determines whether a part will collide with another part if it hits something okay so we've got count collide set to true on both of these parts now let's just change the color if I get this part and I uncheck can collide then the red part is going to just fall into it like this okay in fact the green part fell out of the world because it's not colliding with the base plate either so they are important properties which you need to know and we've also got size but we're not going to focus on on those today there they are just some simple properties and you can see that by changing these properties the part looks and acts in a different way okay let's just make it transparent and sorry opaque and not reflective but we had to manually change those properties okay but in a roblox game that's running we can't just manually change these properties we have to use a script because a script can automatically change these properties for us and automate our game every roblox game that you play such as jailbreak or death run has got a script running behind the scenes which is making the game work so like running the rounds checking to see if he's worn the game etc and it's always changing properties because properties is one of the most basic things you need to know to even get scripting so a script allows us to carry a carry out tasks in a specific order we can tell the game what we want to happen and then the game will be able to do these things and run itself automatically so let's insert a script into server script service so we're going to click on the plus and then click script we're not going to do module script just a script okay now as I said a script will carry out tasks in order okay so whichever line comes first that line will be the one which is executed or run first so to change properties of a part let's say we're going to change the property or some properties of this hello part which we created okay we're going to need to reference this part and reference just means tell the script where this part is because the script we can't just say hello and then we can't just we can just say that okay we have to reference it and tell the script where this part is located and that always comes first so in our script we're going to firstly get this part and to get it to reference it we firstly need to say where the part is stored so it's stored inside the workspace the workspace is a store for all of the parts and things that you see in the game okay for example if I take Hello out and I put it somewhere like replicated storage we can't see it okay so workspace is where all of the parts that are currently in the game world being rendered are okay so everything that you see in your game will be in the workspace so we just need to get this part which is inside of the workspace now the workspace is a service and there are loads of different services here you can see all of these ones here and these services they do lots of different things they house different objects for different reasons but all of these all of these services they are together stored inside something called the game okay so if you think of our services as being in the pink squirt square and then we have our game which is the outer scope okay so everything in the pink box switch sauce services such as the workspace the lighting etc they are a part of game so whenever we want to reference it we have to say game first okay so we say game and then we can do a dot and a dot and allows us to reference something that's inside of of game or the thing before the dot okay so if we said workspace okay which is after the dot workspace is inside of game and game is its parent okay and workspace is known as the child so game dot workspace we've just referenced the service but we now want to get the part called hello which is which is inside of the workspace now hello is going to be a child of the workspace as it's inside of it and workspace is the parent so we're gonna do another dot because we want to get something from the workspace and we're gonna just get the name of the part which is hello and you can see world looks to do begins to it begins to autofill the the result so we just write out hello and we have just referenced our part in a script it's just the same as selecting a part and now we can see all of its properties that we can change okay when we don't when we haven't clicked on a part we haven't referenced it and the game doesn't know what we want to change so we have to tell it what we what we want to change okay so we've selected it and now we can see its properties and that's that's pretty much the same as what we've just done here in the script so now if we do a dot we know that the properties are a part of that part of that of the brick called hello so if we do a dots you can see the script it starts to autofill all of these different properties which can change look we've got transparency anchored and brick color so you can choose any of these properties so we're going to we're gonna do a couple properties to begin with only you could prove oh just to keep it simple so the property that we're gonna change first is transparency okay and all properties aren't the same they take different types of data okay so for example we have transparency over here and you can see the amount of transparency which this part has transparency is basically whether it's seethrough or not you can see it's a number so we could have 0 which means no transparency at all we can't see through it or one which means fully transparent so any number between 0 and 1 is going to affect the transparency so not 0.5 would be half transparent okay so it's a number transparency is a number property okay because the value it takes which changes how the part looks is a number okay whereas something like the name property isn't a number it's a piece of text but we call a piece of text a string okay so if you want to change the transparency of this part we know we have to give it a number so we've referenced the property and now we want to set it to a new value and because it's a number we're going to say equal to so we're making this track this this property equal to a new number a new value and so we just put the new value after the equal sign so I'm gonna set it to 1 which means fully transparent okay now if we just go back to the game and we select our parts let's just set it to completely opaque so we can we can't see through it and now we can run our script to see if we've successfully been able to change the transparency so we're going to click on the Home tab here and then click on this arrow which is underneath run it might say play so click on the arrow and click on run run basically lets us run all the scripts in our game without having to join it so let's click run and there we go the part has gone fully transparent and we can see through it but it doesn't mean that the parts been deleted it's still there we just can't see through it because we can select it in the workspace and look it's still there and if we go ahead and change the transparency again you can see one it's at the end of the spectrum and as we move it further to the left it becomes opaque again and that script is only ran once once it's finished setting the transparency it will see that there's no lines left to execute so it will just stop running okay so that is a very very simple property transparency but I said there were other data types which properties take because not all properties are going to take a number for example the material property that is text but you can also select them from a dropdown so there are two ways to set the material of a of a part so we're just going to get rid of the dock transparency but this time we're going to set the material now the first way is just by putting the text okay the name of the material in quotation marks or speech marks okay so if this is smooth plastic that it's currently on and we want to set it to grass we could just write grass in here okay and if we go and run the game it's sure to change the property to grass there we go and if we click on the part again and have a look in the properties tab the script has automatically changed it to grass for us okay now the second way of doing this is by using an enum okay so an enum is kind of like it gives you a list of properties to choose from so you could write enum and then you could say dot and you then have to write the name of the property okay so I know we've written out before but we have to write out again for enum so when we write out and then do another dot it will give us a list of all of the materials just like when we typed in the property name sorry the the name of the parts it gave us a list of properties before we wrote the property so you can select a property so material here such as wood that will do the exact same thing okay it will set the property so there's two ways for you and can choose whichever one works for you I prefer doing it this way because it gives you a list of materials but you can you can use enums for all types of properties well all types of like dropdown properties like this okay where you can select one from from a list and we you also have brick color so there's two ways to change the color of parts so you could either do brick color and brick color lets you set a preset color which from this palette okay if you click on brick color you can see a list of all these colors and each color has a name which represents its RGB value an RGB value is just a set of three values red green and blue and it makes it one big color but brick color is simpler than that and it just gives you the name of the color so to set a brick color we obviously have to say the name of the property but we can't say it in speech marks like this because brick color is a special type of property and we have to say Bricker dot new because because it's roblox's color palette and this is the way of picking the color so you say brick color and then you say dot new the new in lowercase and then you have a set of parentheses or brackets after it and then in quotation marks or speech marks inside of these brackets you can write the name of the color but it has to be a color from their palette and has to be spelled correctly with the capitalization correct as well you can see we have a capital R for really but then it goes lower case for red now if we go and try this out you can see the part that goes red alright and there's one more way of changing the color with this color palette if you wanted to give an RGB value so instead of saying brick color you could just say color and don't forget this is the American spelling so those of you that are British we spell it with a u you have to spell it Co lor the american way so when we set a color we can say color 3 because a color 3 value is made up of three RGB values ok color 3 and then we can say dot from RGB and then we can give a number between 0 and 255 for each color so the amount of red the amount of blue and Green and it will mix it together kind of imagine it like paints if you're mixing red green and blue paint you're also gonna get a color right so if you did 255 comma zero comma zero that would be completely red but um you shouldn't really have to understand this for now I'm just showing you how color 3 works and you can see if I choose a color on the color picker it gives me a red value green value and a blue value so 255 one five seven and thirty seven one five seven and thirty seven and that should give us the orange car yeah there we go so that's how you change the color now there's one last type of property I want to show you and that is the behavior properties so anchored archivable can collide locked masses etc they're all check boxes and a check box is either on or off so true or false so there's two values you can choose from and this is a boolean value a boolean value is either true or false it can't be anything else so if it's true then it's gonna be what if we were looking at the anchored property for example okay anchored and we set this to true if it's true then it means yes it is anchored but if it's false think of it as being unchecked or not I'm good so if we keep anchored as false and we lift it up into the air and we run the game it's going to fall straight to the ground but if we change anchor to true which means it is anchored and the anchored property is turned off then there you go it stays up in the air and you can see again in the properties window we have managed to change the property from script now you may be thinking this is really really simple can we just get into the really good stuff I know it's done that but we have to really go really really simple to begin with with the properties because then we can do really really cool stuff in the future use need to make sure you have a good understanding of how to reference okay by saying the service and then getting the name of the parts parents children and the property as well okay I think we're gonna leave it there for the first video if you want to go to the next video there'll be a thumbnail on your screen right now with an arrow so go go click it I'll see you in the next video don't forget to subscribe to my youtube channel I produce lots of roblox scripting videos to help you make your own roblox games do take your time and don't give up on scripting it may seem hard but trust me you'll be able to do it alright thanks for watching
