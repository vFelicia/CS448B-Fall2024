00:01 - okay in this video I'm going to show you
00:02 - how to make a clickable button in Roblox
00:05 - so you're firstly going to want to
00:07 - create a
00:08 - GUI okay so in the starter GUI we'll
00:11 - just insert a screen GUI and then you
00:13 - want to insert a text button although
00:16 - you could also use an image button but
00:17 - for this purpose of the tutorial it's
00:19 - not really necessary and then what we'll
00:21 - do is we'll just drag this around
00:24 - somewhere on the
00:25 - screen and what you then want to do is
00:27 - you want to insert a local script now
00:30 - now what I like to do is I like to have
00:31 - one local script really that just
00:33 - controls everything rather than having a
00:36 - a local script in every single uh GUI
00:39 - elements so what we'll do is we'll have
00:41 - our local script in the starter GUI and
00:43 - we'll just create a variable for our
00:45 - text button and this will be script.
00:49 - parent wait forchild screen
00:52 - GUI wait forch child text button okay
00:56 - and then when we've got the text button
00:58 - we can say text button Dot and then we
01:01 - have a load of different events that we
01:03 - can choose from such as RBX sorry such
01:05 - as Mouse button one click or um if we
01:09 - just start typing you'll see a lot more
01:11 - so Mouse button one click or Mouse
01:12 - button one down when you press down the
01:15 - mouse button this one will fire when you
01:18 - let go the mouse button one click will
01:20 - fire so that's the difference between
01:21 - them so we're going to do a mouse button
01:24 - one click Mouse button one is just the
01:26 - left button on your mouse it will also
01:28 - fire if you tap on a mobile device so
01:31 - don't worry about that uh colon
01:34 - connect function okay and then inside
01:37 - this function we can write the code that
01:39 - will execute when the button is pressed
01:42 - so we could print out button has been
01:44 - clicked for example and if we click on
01:47 - play here or play
01:49 - solo and we click on the button you can
01:52 - see it's printing out that the button
01:53 - has been clicked but this doesn't really
01:55 - do anything it's quite basic so how can
01:58 - we make this a little bit more um
02:00 - functional well it depends what you want
02:02 - to do really if you want to open up a
02:05 - frame let's just put a frame in the
02:07 - middle of the
02:08 - screen I'm going to set the size and
02:10 - position to
02:14 - 05050 and I'm going to set the Anchor
02:16 - Point to again 0.
02:19 - 5.5 so let's just select this Frame and
02:22 - we'll make it invisible we uncheck the
02:24 - visible property and if we wanted to
02:27 - make this Frame appear we could well
02:29 - we'll firstly create a variable for it
02:32 - so local frame equals script. parents
02:35 - wait for child frame oh sorry wait for
02:37 - child screen GUI wait for child frame we
02:41 - could say frame do visible equals not
02:45 - frame visible so it's taking the current
02:48 - the current visible property of the
02:50 - frame which is either true or false and
02:52 - it's inverting it so what this will do
02:55 - is it will give us the opposite of what
02:56 - the frames visibility property currently
02:59 - is so if if it's true we will set it to
03:01 - false and if it's false we'll set it to
03:02 - true so we're essentially just toggling
03:04 - it now if we play the game again you'll
03:07 - notice that when we press the button the
03:09 - frame appears and when we click it again
03:11 - it goes away so this is how pretty much
03:13 - every menu system in Roblox works the
03:16 - the GUI is always there the frame is
03:18 - always there it just gets uh it just
03:21 - gets hidden or shown depending on the
03:23 - status of the visible property which
03:26 - we're changing via the button so we've
03:29 - we've stepped up a little bit there
03:30 - we've we've made the the frame uh
03:33 - actually be a bit more interactive um
03:36 - well we've made the button more
03:37 - interactive by opening and closing the
03:40 - frame perhaps now we should actually
03:42 - change the text of the button to say
03:45 - open and then in our local script we
03:48 - want to change this text depending on
03:50 - whether the frame is visible or not so
03:53 - underneath here we'll just create a uh
03:56 - we'll say text button. text equals and
04:00 - this text is either going to be open or
04:02 - it's either going to be close right but
04:04 - how do we set this depending on the
04:05 - frames visibility well it's quite
04:07 - similar to how we've just done the
04:09 - frame. visible we'll say frame. visible
04:13 - and open or close and what this means is
04:17 - this is going to return a true or false
04:19 - value depending on whether the frame is
04:21 - visible or not if it's true then it's
04:23 - going to we're going to return open
04:27 - because when a statement is true we want
04:31 - this to be returned otherwise if it's
04:34 - false if it's not true then it will
04:36 - return close this is almost like a mini
04:38 - function we have a condition which can
04:41 - either be true or false which is whether
04:43 - the frame is visible or not if this
04:45 - condition is true then we will the text
04:50 - will be open or if it is not true that
04:54 - means the frame is oh I've got this the
04:57 - wrong way I've got this the wrong way
04:59 - around round sorry this should be close
05:01 - and this should be open because if the
05:03 - FR if the if the frame is visible so if
05:06 - this is true then we want the text
05:09 - button to say close right but if it is
05:12 - not visible then we want the text button
05:14 - to say open okay now I I know this could
05:17 - be a bit confusing but this is basically
05:19 - a shortened way of doing an if statement
05:21 - it's the same thing as saying ifame
05:24 - visible then text button. text equals
05:28 - close else text button. text equals open
05:32 - but this spans 1 two 3 four five this
05:35 - spans five lines we do the same thing
05:37 - twice it's just a a condensed way of
05:41 - saying well look if frames if the frame
05:44 - is visible then we want it to say close
05:46 - otherwise we want it to say open and
05:48 - we'll get more into this when I make a
05:50 - video about conditionals and if
05:51 - statements and things but if we click on
05:53 - play and run this you'll notice that
05:56 - when we click on the button it says
05:58 - close and when we you know when we when
06:01 - when the frame is hidden it says open
06:03 - again so very very simple way of um
06:08 - having a a button which opens and closes
06:10 - a GUI and just a brief introduction as
06:14 - well into how uh text buttons and image
06:16 - buttons work in in Roblox so let me know
06:19 - if you enjoyed this video uh and if you
06:21 - want any more GUI videos I'm happy to
06:23 - make them uh and I will see you in the
06:26 - next one
