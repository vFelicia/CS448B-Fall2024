00:00 - so imagine you have a game where players
00:03 - can build on a plot and a player's
00:06 - finished building and they've just left
00:08 - the game so it's time to clean up their
00:10 - plot but you realize that they've placed
00:13 - so many parts in their plot that you
00:15 - don't know how to get rid of them all so
00:17 - what do you do well we don't want to
00:19 - delete the plot because we want to keep
00:21 - the plot in case another player joins so
00:24 - that's out of the equation what we could
00:26 - also do is we could use a for Loop to
00:28 - Loop over this plot and we could
00:31 - individually delete every single part
00:33 - which sounds a little bit over the top
00:36 - because surely there's a function in
00:38 - Roblox which will just let us clear
00:41 - everything inside of our folder or in
00:44 - any other object well of course there is
00:46 - and that's why I'm going to show you how
00:48 - to use clear all children very very
00:51 - straightforward firstly you get the
00:53 - object which you want to clear the
00:55 - children of and in Roblox we refer to a
00:58 - child as any object inside another
01:01 - object so in this case the folder is our
01:04 - parent because it contains all of these
01:07 - children which are our parts so we will
01:10 - find the parent which is in this case
01:12 - game. workspace do plot and then we'll
01:16 - say colon clear all children and it's
01:19 - just gone off your screen there but uh
01:23 - it you can see it says this function
01:25 - destroys all of an instance's children
01:27 - okay so clear all children with a pair
01:30 - of brackets on the end there because
01:31 - it's a function and then as soon as you
01:33 - press run look at that all of the parts
01:37 - inside the plot got deleted now is there
01:41 - still a use case for like I said looping
01:45 - through the folder and removing the
01:48 - parts one by one well yes kind of let me
01:51 - show you a little example where you
01:53 - might not want to use clear all
01:56 - children so imagine I had a shop GUI
01:59 - okay and I'm listing all of my products
02:02 - in my shop uh inside this main frame
02:07 - okay we've also got a UI corner and a UI
02:10 - grid layout now if I wanted to for
02:13 - example let's say you clicked on another
02:16 - tab in my shop okay and you no longer
02:18 - want to see my game passes you want to
02:20 - see my developer products because you
02:22 - want to buy some wins or some currency
02:25 - okay well I'm going to have to firstly
02:27 - clear out all of these game passes all
02:29 - of these products which are currently on
02:31 - the screen because it's not what you
02:32 - want to see and okay you know I could
02:34 - use clear all children for this use case
02:37 - I could use my I could get my frame
02:39 - which houses all of these products and I
02:42 - could say clear all children but I don't
02:45 - want to delete all of the children of
02:47 - this Frame I want to keep the UI corner
02:50 - and I want to keep the UI grid layout
02:52 - because if I was to delete if I was to
02:54 - delete the UI grid layout suddenly my
02:57 - products aren't going to be in a grid
02:59 - layout anymore so I want to keep that
03:02 - for sure I also want to keep my UI
03:04 - Corner otherwise the frame is not going
03:06 - to be rounded anymore so how can I clear
03:10 - all the children when I don't want to
03:12 - clear all of the children I have some
03:13 - exceptions and in that use case then yes
03:16 - you would want to instead of saying
03:18 - frame clear all children let's just
03:21 - create a local script
03:23 - here okay and we'll just put it in our
03:26 - screen GUI at the top and we'll just get
03:28 - this Frame that we've been working
03:31 - in instead of saying frame clear all
03:33 - children you would want to instead Loop
03:38 - through the contents of the frame so
03:40 - we'd say frame get
03:43 - children okay and then you could say if
03:47 - object is a is a frame then object
03:54 - destroy okay because in our previous
03:56 - video we looked at get children which
03:59 - returns a
04:00 - of all of these children and the value
04:03 - That We're looping through is obviously
04:04 - going to be an object so we can check to
04:07 - see if the object is a frame if it is a
04:10 - frame then we'll delete it otherwise if
04:12 - it isn't perhaps it might be a UI grid
04:14 - layout then we're not going to do
04:15 - anything to it and if I was to run this
04:20 - code you'd notice that all of the
04:22 - products disappear which is fine because
04:25 - if we then went back to our screen GUI
04:28 - and look at our frame the the UI corner
04:30 - and the UI grid layout is still there so
04:33 - the next time I want to insert some
04:35 - frames to my uh GUI here you'll notice
04:38 - that they still retain that grid layout
04:42 - but if I was to say clear all children
04:44 - it would essentially just delete
04:46 - everything and the next time I went to
04:47 - add a
04:49 - frame and kept on duplicating it it
04:52 - would stay in the same place because the
04:53 - UI grid layout has gone so yes there is
04:56 - a case where you'd want to use a for
04:57 - Loop instead but if you know that
05:00 - everything inside of your object once is
05:02 - going to be deleted you don't care about
05:04 - you know particular things being
05:05 - destroyed you just want to get rid of
05:07 - everything then by all means use clear
05:09 - all
05:11 - children okay I hope that video was
05:12 - useful if it was leave a like subscribe
05:15 - let me know if you have any more videos
05:16 - that you'd like me to cover and I'll see
05:18 - you in the next one

Cleaned transcript:

so imagine you have a game where players can build on a plot and a player's finished building and they've just left the game so it's time to clean up their plot but you realize that they've placed so many parts in their plot that you don't know how to get rid of them all so what do you do well we don't want to delete the plot because we want to keep the plot in case another player joins so that's out of the equation what we could also do is we could use a for Loop to Loop over this plot and we could individually delete every single part which sounds a little bit over the top because surely there's a function in Roblox which will just let us clear everything inside of our folder or in any other object well of course there is and that's why I'm going to show you how to use clear all children very very straightforward firstly you get the object which you want to clear the children of and in Roblox we refer to a child as any object inside another object so in this case the folder is our parent because it contains all of these children which are our parts so we will find the parent which is in this case game. workspace do plot and then we'll say colon clear all children and it's just gone off your screen there but uh it you can see it says this function destroys all of an instance's children okay so clear all children with a pair of brackets on the end there because it's a function and then as soon as you press run look at that all of the parts inside the plot got deleted now is there still a use case for like I said looping through the folder and removing the parts one by one well yes kind of let me show you a little example where you might not want to use clear all children so imagine I had a shop GUI okay and I'm listing all of my products in my shop uh inside this main frame okay we've also got a UI corner and a UI grid layout now if I wanted to for example let's say you clicked on another tab in my shop okay and you no longer want to see my game passes you want to see my developer products because you want to buy some wins or some currency okay well I'm going to have to firstly clear out all of these game passes all of these products which are currently on the screen because it's not what you want to see and okay you know I could use clear all children for this use case I could use my I could get my frame which houses all of these products and I could say clear all children but I don't want to delete all of the children of this Frame I want to keep the UI corner and I want to keep the UI grid layout because if I was to delete if I was to delete the UI grid layout suddenly my products aren't going to be in a grid layout anymore so I want to keep that for sure I also want to keep my UI Corner otherwise the frame is not going to be rounded anymore so how can I clear all the children when I don't want to clear all of the children I have some exceptions and in that use case then yes you would want to instead of saying frame clear all children let's just create a local script here okay and we'll just put it in our screen GUI at the top and we'll just get this Frame that we've been working in instead of saying frame clear all children you would want to instead Loop through the contents of the frame so we'd say frame get children okay and then you could say if object is a is a frame then object destroy okay because in our previous video we looked at get children which returns a of all of these children and the value That We're looping through is obviously going to be an object so we can check to see if the object is a frame if it is a frame then we'll delete it otherwise if it isn't perhaps it might be a UI grid layout then we're not going to do anything to it and if I was to run this code you'd notice that all of the products disappear which is fine because if we then went back to our screen GUI and look at our frame the the UI corner and the UI grid layout is still there so the next time I want to insert some frames to my uh GUI here you'll notice that they still retain that grid layout but if I was to say clear all children it would essentially just delete everything and the next time I went to add a frame and kept on duplicating it it would stay in the same place because the UI grid layout has gone so yes there is a case where you'd want to use a for Loop instead but if you know that everything inside of your object once is going to be deleted you don't care about you know particular things being destroyed you just want to get rid of everything then by all means use clear all children okay I hope that video was useful if it was leave a like subscribe let me know if you have any more videos that you'd like me to cover and I'll see you in the next one
