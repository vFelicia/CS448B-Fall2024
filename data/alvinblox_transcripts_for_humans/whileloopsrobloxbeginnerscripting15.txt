00:00 - hey everyone welcome to episode number
00:02 - 15 this is Alvin blocks first of all
00:05 - sorry for the lack of uploads recently
00:07 - especially in this series I am very
00:09 - sorry about that although I have been
00:10 - working on my own roblox game which is
00:13 - coming soon hence the lack of uploads
00:15 - but also some other projects for the
00:18 - channel which are taking up my time so
00:20 - you should be able to see those soon
00:22 - today though we're looking at while
00:23 - loops so lots of different while loops
00:25 - in roblox scripting this one the while
00:30 - loop is probably the easiest one that
00:32 - we're going to be looking at so let's
00:34 - begin a while loop is code block code
00:39 - element you could say and what it will
00:42 - do is any code that you put inside of a
00:44 - while loop will repeat over and over
00:48 - again forever basically and you can see
00:52 - here we've said while true do and then
00:55 - we've got an end here so in between
00:57 - these two red lines this is our while
01:01 - loop okay so the wild true do is the
01:03 - syntax that we need to tell the script
01:05 - it's a while loop and any code that goes
01:08 - in between these two lines will repeat
01:11 - forever
01:11 - now I just need to tell you this before
01:14 - we go any further because a while loop
01:16 - will run forever
01:17 - continuously what happens is it loops
01:20 - over and over again really quickly and
01:22 - when it does this it starts to lag your
01:25 - PC if you don't have a delay in between
01:27 - loops so if we didn't have a delay here
01:30 - like we have this wait what would happen
01:32 - is it would constantly loop thousands
01:35 - and thousands and thousands of times on
01:36 - your computer and it executes super fast
01:40 - so we won't even be able to see it
01:42 - happening because it will be happened so
01:43 - fast
01:44 - they crash your script if I'll just show
01:46 - you here if I run the game you can see
01:50 - it's starting to lag a bit you can see
01:52 - it's stuck here and that's because it is
01:55 - just doing these while loops over and
01:57 - over again with no delays and there we
01:59 - go it's had to timeout because the
02:02 - script has been overwhelmed with
02:04 - requests so the first thing you need to
02:07 - know is that when you have a while loop
02:08 - you have to have some kind of wait some
02:11 - kind of delay it doesn't have to be long
02:13 - the
02:14 - fault wait if you don't put a number in
02:15 - there he's naught point naught three
02:17 - seconds so that's a decent wait time but
02:20 - as long as you just have a wait in there
02:22 - just so that the script can pause each
02:24 - time it loops because if you do a while
02:27 - lube it's gonna keep going and if you
02:29 - don't have a wait
02:30 - it's gonna try and just do loads of
02:32 - ruining lots of code at once so that's
02:34 - not good you have to have a delay so
02:36 - what we saw there if we just run it
02:39 - again is that it just keeps on printing
02:42 - over and over again now you can see here
02:44 - it's only printed it once in the output
02:47 - but we've got this X 260 and it keeps
02:51 - going up every naught point naught 3
02:52 - seconds and that's just a way of not
02:55 - spamming your output and it's telling us
02:57 - that it is printing 500 times that's
03:00 - what's gone up see now but it's just
03:02 - showing it once in the output because
03:03 - it's printing the same message over and
03:05 - over again so you can see that the
03:06 - script is repeating the code so it's
03:09 - just gone to this line okay we're going
03:12 - to the wait line next it gets to the end
03:13 - everywhere in a while loop so it goes
03:16 - back to the start and then it goes back
03:17 - to the print then it waits and it goes
03:19 - back to the start and it prints and it
03:21 - waits the thing goes back to the start
03:22 - so that weight is waiting or no point
03:27 - not three seconds now you can change
03:30 - this weight whatever you want and the
03:32 - scripts going to delay so it's gonna
03:34 - print this is awesome it's gonna wait
03:35 - one second and it's gonna print it again
03:37 - let's have a look so it's printed this
03:39 - is awesome
03:40 - you see it's at times two now so times 3
03:42 - 9 times 4 times 5 times 6 times 7 etc so
03:46 - it's it's looping every one second
03:49 - because we've got this weight in there
03:50 - but we need a weight to prevent it from
03:53 - crushing the script now a while true do
03:57 - loop will run no matter what so no
04:00 - matter what happens this wire loop is
04:02 - going to run so if I have a weight 5 at
04:06 - the start of the script so I'm going to
04:08 - do anything until after 5 seconds so 3
04:11 - or 5 there we go so and now it started
04:15 - it's entered that while loop so what's
04:17 - happened is the Scriptures started we're
04:20 - not in the wild loop yet because we're
04:21 - on line 2
04:22 - but after those 5 seconds we're entering
04:24 - the while loop so we're no longer
04:27 - going to if we had some extra code down
04:30 - here we're no longer going to worry
04:34 - about that okay we're not going to get
04:35 - to that because we're stuck in this wild
04:37 - loop and this wild loop it's gonna is
04:39 - gonna move on to this line gonna move on
04:41 - to this line and then it's gonna repeat
04:44 - all over again and we're gonna just get
04:45 - stuck in this loop and it's gonna keep
04:47 - going over and over and over again and
04:49 - we're never gonna get to the code that's
04:51 - down here so why do we use a while loop
04:54 - some people will ask so it's kind of
04:57 - helpful if you have like a game script
04:58 - where you have a game that repeats over
05:01 - and over again for example so you could
05:03 - have your intermission and then the
05:05 - actual game and then the end of round
05:08 - stuff where everyone gets teleported
05:09 - that's Lobby and then it's gonna repeat
05:11 - over again right the game is a new games
05:14 - gonna happen so it's going to go back to
05:16 - the start it's gonna do the intermission
05:17 - it's gonna do the game it's gonna do the
05:19 - end of round stuff boom new game so it
05:21 - just is like a game loop so you can put
05:24 - your all of your you'll go your K your
05:26 - codes sorry your games code if I'm get
05:29 - get my words out all of your games code
05:31 - inside the while loop and then it will
05:33 - just repeat it over and over again and
05:35 - of course you're gonna have your weights
05:36 - in there for things like the
05:38 - intermission things like the game loop
05:39 - but that's getting more advanced but you
05:42 - can see the idea of wire loops so it's
05:44 - looping over and over again now for the
05:48 - while loop to repeat over and over again
05:50 - every time it loops it checks this true
05:53 - so this is basically the condition okay
05:55 - so the thing in the middle here it's
05:57 - called the condition now it can either
05:59 - be true or it can be false so when the
06:03 - condition is false the while loop is not
06:06 - going to run but when the condition is
06:07 - true the while loop will run so if you
06:11 - just want the while loop to run and
06:13 - repeat no matter what then you can just
06:16 - leave as true and it's gonna keep on
06:18 - looping no matter what but if you want
06:20 - the while loop to only run when a
06:23 - certain condition is met just like an if
06:25 - statement so we could have a variable
06:29 - okay so that's false but I could say
06:31 - while my var is equal to truth then I
06:36 - want the while loop to run so what will
06:38 - happen is
06:39 - this we will never enter this wallet
06:41 - because my VAR is never ever true so if
06:45 - I was to do have print down here saying
06:46 - we've reached line 10 here if I was to
06:54 - do this and we run you can see it will
06:57 - say we have reached line 10 after five
07:00 - seconds because I put that wait at the
07:02 - start so what's happened is we've set my
07:05 - variable to false we've waited five
07:07 - seconds we've got to line five and we've
07:09 - said okay while my var is equal to true
07:11 - but my var is equal false so this
07:14 - condition is false because it's not been
07:18 - met my var is not equal to true so this
07:21 - condition this statement is false just
07:24 - like an if statement so an if statement
07:26 - will only run if the condition is true
07:27 - just like a while loop will never run if
07:32 - the condition is false so even though we
07:35 - have got a true here actually this
07:38 - condition my var isn't true so the
07:42 - entire condition that the conditions
07:45 - value is false and we know when a while
07:49 - loop the condition the thing in the
07:50 - middle the outcome is false it's not
07:53 - going to run but when it's true it is
07:54 - gonna run so he just tries again set it
07:56 - to true what should happen is after five
07:58 - seconds we're gonna enter this while
08:00 - loop and this while loop is gonna loop
08:02 - forever and everyone ever it's gonna
08:03 - just print this is awesome every one
08:06 - second and we're never ever gonna reach
08:08 - line ten so let's check out so just wait
08:12 - five seconds three four five there we go
08:15 - so prints this is awesome this is
08:17 - awesome and it's never ever gonna print
08:19 - that we've reached line ten I could
08:21 - pause the video and come back in 24
08:23 - hours and we still would not have
08:24 - reached line ten it will never ever
08:26 - reach line ten because we're stuck in
08:29 - this while loop here we're just stuck in
08:34 - it and
08:36 - we're never ever gonna gonna move on to
08:38 - the rest of the code because when it
08:41 - goes to the end it just restarts and
08:44 - that's the whole point of a while loop
08:46 - it runs forever now of course you could
08:49 - change the condition the condition could
08:52 - change whilst it's running so every time
08:55 - you get to the end it's gonna check this
08:56 - condition again so after the first and
08:59 - pass on the while loop I could set my
09:01 - false and then what's gonna happen is
09:04 - it's gonna go to the end it's gonna
09:06 - restart it's gonna say ok it's my VAR
09:08 - still true and there is NOx we just
09:12 - changed it to false so it's gonna it's
09:14 - gonna basically stop the while loop and
09:16 - it's gonna move on to the next piece of
09:17 - code so the while loop will only stop
09:20 - when the condition changes so again
09:23 - let's just open the script again but
09:25 - we've got a game running so it says this
09:28 - is awesome once and then it says we've
09:30 - reached line 10 because it printed it
09:31 - waited one second we then set my var to
09:34 - false so when it looped around again and
09:37 - we got back up to the top here it said
09:39 - okay so is my var still equal to true
09:43 - because that's our condition and it's
09:44 - gonna check it every time that the loop
09:47 - comes round again
09:48 - so my var okay we set it to true up here
09:52 - but we've since edited it we've changed
09:54 - its value because that's a variable and
09:56 - variable means to be able to change the
10:00 - variable has bit has changed to false so
10:02 - my var is no longer equal to true so the
10:05 - while loop has stops and it has moved on
10:09 - to the next piece of code we've reached
10:11 - line ten so in the other example it
10:14 - never ever got to this line it never
10:16 - printed we've reached line ten because
10:18 - we never changed my var so there we go
10:21 - while loop it will run forever as long
10:24 - as the condition is true so in this case
10:28 - the condition was always true but in the
10:32 - previous case here it was only true on
10:35 - the first go around because we changed
10:37 - my bar
10:38 - you may be wondering well what's the
10:41 - point in the condition I'll give you
10:43 - some examples you can check the number
10:47 - of players in your game so you could do
10:49 - while
10:50 - you don't need to know this but game DUP
10:53 - players get players and be just about
10:57 - hashtag here this condition what it will
11:00 - do is it will give us a number of
11:03 - players in the game so it could be three
11:05 - players so if I say it while the number
11:08 - of players is greater or let's even say
11:11 - less than two we could print not enough
11:15 - players in the game and we'll just
11:20 - remove this here because we don't need
11:21 - it anymore and we can print here enough
11:25 - players reached let's carry on so here
11:29 - what I've done is I've created a while
11:32 - loop that it's not going to carry on
11:34 - it's not going to continue running the
11:35 - rest of the script until we have enough
11:37 - players in the game so what it's doing
11:39 - is it's checking okay it's the number of
11:42 - players in the game less than two mmm
11:45 - yes it is so we're gonna print not
11:47 - enough players in the game we're gonna
11:48 - wait one second and we're gonna say okay
11:51 - we'll check again and if the number of
11:54 - players does rise to two or two or more
11:57 - let's say we will break out of this wire
12:00 - loop and we will carry on with the
12:02 - script so if we have some more code down
12:04 - here maybe to teleport players or
12:06 - whatever that code would only run when
12:09 - enough players are in the game so there
12:11 - you go nice practical example of how a
12:13 - while loop will work and we can actually
12:16 - test that right now if we head into play
12:18 - solo you can see that it says not enough
12:23 - plays in the game because there's only
12:24 - one person in the game but if somebody
12:26 - else joined then it would stop that wire
12:29 - loop because they would then be two
12:31 - players in the game so there we go a
12:33 - nice little brief introduction into
12:35 - while loops I hope that was useful so if
12:38 - you enjoyed it please do smash the like
12:42 - button on the video let me know that
12:43 - you're enjoying it and you want more and
12:44 - don't forget to share it with a friend
12:46 - who may want to learn about this get
12:49 - some more knowledge on wild loops so
12:51 - they're really important and that's all
12:54 - you need to know right now about what
12:56 - are loops so thanks for watching again
12:58 - sorry about the lack of videos recently
13:00 - but I do appreciate the support and I'll
13:02 - see you in the neck
13:03 - video Cheers

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone welcome to episode number 15 this is Alvin blocks first of all sorry for the lack of uploads recently especially in this series I am very sorry about that although I have been working on my own roblox game which is coming soon hence the lack of uploads but also some other projects for the channel which are taking up my time so you should be able to see those soon today though we're looking at while loops so lots of different while loops in roblox scripting this one the while loop is probably the easiest one that we're going to be looking at so let's begin a while loop is code block code element you could say and what it will do is any code that you put inside of a while loop will repeat over and over again forever basically and you can see here we've said while true do and then we've got an end here so in between these two red lines this is our while loop okay so the wild true do is the syntax that we need to tell the script it's a while loop and any code that goes in between these two lines will repeat forever now I just need to tell you this before we go any further because a while loop will run forever continuously what happens is it loops over and over again really quickly and when it does this it starts to lag your PC if you don't have a delay in between loops so if we didn't have a delay here like we have this wait what would happen is it would constantly loop thousands and thousands and thousands of times on your computer and it executes super fast so we won't even be able to see it happening because it will be happened so fast they crash your script if I'll just show you here if I run the game you can see it's starting to lag a bit you can see it's stuck here and that's because it is just doing these while loops over and over again with no delays and there we go it's had to timeout because the script has been overwhelmed with requests so the first thing you need to know is that when you have a while loop you have to have some kind of wait some kind of delay it doesn't have to be long the fault wait if you don't put a number in there he's naught point naught three seconds so that's a decent wait time but as long as you just have a wait in there just so that the script can pause each time it loops because if you do a while lube it's gonna keep going and if you don't have a wait it's gonna try and just do loads of ruining lots of code at once so that's not good you have to have a delay so what we saw there if we just run it again is that it just keeps on printing over and over again now you can see here it's only printed it once in the output but we've got this X 260 and it keeps going up every naught point naught 3 seconds and that's just a way of not spamming your output and it's telling us that it is printing 500 times that's what's gone up see now but it's just showing it once in the output because it's printing the same message over and over again so you can see that the script is repeating the code so it's just gone to this line okay we're going to the wait line next it gets to the end everywhere in a while loop so it goes back to the start and then it goes back to the print then it waits and it goes back to the start and it prints and it waits the thing goes back to the start so that weight is waiting or no point not three seconds now you can change this weight whatever you want and the scripts going to delay so it's gonna print this is awesome it's gonna wait one second and it's gonna print it again let's have a look so it's printed this is awesome you see it's at times two now so times 3 9 times 4 times 5 times 6 times 7 etc so it's it's looping every one second because we've got this weight in there but we need a weight to prevent it from crushing the script now a while true do loop will run no matter what so no matter what happens this wire loop is going to run so if I have a weight 5 at the start of the script so I'm going to do anything until after 5 seconds so 3 or 5 there we go so and now it started it's entered that while loop so what's happened is the Scriptures started we're not in the wild loop yet because we're on line 2 but after those 5 seconds we're entering the while loop so we're no longer going to if we had some extra code down here we're no longer going to worry about that okay we're not going to get to that because we're stuck in this wild loop and this wild loop it's gonna is gonna move on to this line gonna move on to this line and then it's gonna repeat all over again and we're gonna just get stuck in this loop and it's gonna keep going over and over and over again and we're never gonna get to the code that's down here so why do we use a while loop some people will ask so it's kind of helpful if you have like a game script where you have a game that repeats over and over again for example so you could have your intermission and then the actual game and then the end of round stuff where everyone gets teleported that's Lobby and then it's gonna repeat over again right the game is a new games gonna happen so it's going to go back to the start it's gonna do the intermission it's gonna do the game it's gonna do the end of round stuff boom new game so it just is like a game loop so you can put your all of your you'll go your K your codes sorry your games code if I'm get get my words out all of your games code inside the while loop and then it will just repeat it over and over again and of course you're gonna have your weights in there for things like the intermission things like the game loop but that's getting more advanced but you can see the idea of wire loops so it's looping over and over again now for the while loop to repeat over and over again every time it loops it checks this true so this is basically the condition okay so the thing in the middle here it's called the condition now it can either be true or it can be false so when the condition is false the while loop is not going to run but when the condition is true the while loop will run so if you just want the while loop to run and repeat no matter what then you can just leave as true and it's gonna keep on looping no matter what but if you want the while loop to only run when a certain condition is met just like an if statement so we could have a variable okay so that's false but I could say while my var is equal to truth then I want the while loop to run so what will happen is this we will never enter this wallet because my VAR is never ever true so if I was to do have print down here saying we've reached line 10 here if I was to do this and we run you can see it will say we have reached line 10 after five seconds because I put that wait at the start so what's happened is we've set my variable to false we've waited five seconds we've got to line five and we've said okay while my var is equal to true but my var is equal false so this condition is false because it's not been met my var is not equal to true so this condition this statement is false just like an if statement so an if statement will only run if the condition is true just like a while loop will never run if the condition is false so even though we have got a true here actually this condition my var isn't true so the entire condition that the conditions value is false and we know when a while loop the condition the thing in the middle the outcome is false it's not going to run but when it's true it is gonna run so he just tries again set it to true what should happen is after five seconds we're gonna enter this while loop and this while loop is gonna loop forever and everyone ever it's gonna just print this is awesome every one second and we're never ever gonna reach line ten so let's check out so just wait five seconds three four five there we go so prints this is awesome this is awesome and it's never ever gonna print that we've reached line ten I could pause the video and come back in 24 hours and we still would not have reached line ten it will never ever reach line ten because we're stuck in this while loop here we're just stuck in it and we're never ever gonna gonna move on to the rest of the code because when it goes to the end it just restarts and that's the whole point of a while loop it runs forever now of course you could change the condition the condition could change whilst it's running so every time you get to the end it's gonna check this condition again so after the first and pass on the while loop I could set my false and then what's gonna happen is it's gonna go to the end it's gonna restart it's gonna say ok it's my VAR still true and there is NOx we just changed it to false so it's gonna it's gonna basically stop the while loop and it's gonna move on to the next piece of code so the while loop will only stop when the condition changes so again let's just open the script again but we've got a game running so it says this is awesome once and then it says we've reached line 10 because it printed it waited one second we then set my var to false so when it looped around again and we got back up to the top here it said okay so is my var still equal to true because that's our condition and it's gonna check it every time that the loop comes round again so my var okay we set it to true up here but we've since edited it we've changed its value because that's a variable and variable means to be able to change the variable has bit has changed to false so my var is no longer equal to true so the while loop has stops and it has moved on to the next piece of code we've reached line ten so in the other example it never ever got to this line it never printed we've reached line ten because we never changed my var so there we go while loop it will run forever as long as the condition is true so in this case the condition was always true but in the previous case here it was only true on the first go around because we changed my bar you may be wondering well what's the point in the condition I'll give you some examples you can check the number of players in your game so you could do while you don't need to know this but game DUP players get players and be just about hashtag here this condition what it will do is it will give us a number of players in the game so it could be three players so if I say it while the number of players is greater or let's even say less than two we could print not enough players in the game and we'll just remove this here because we don't need it anymore and we can print here enough players reached let's carry on so here what I've done is I've created a while loop that it's not going to carry on it's not going to continue running the rest of the script until we have enough players in the game so what it's doing is it's checking okay it's the number of players in the game less than two mmm yes it is so we're gonna print not enough players in the game we're gonna wait one second and we're gonna say okay we'll check again and if the number of players does rise to two or two or more let's say we will break out of this wire loop and we will carry on with the script so if we have some more code down here maybe to teleport players or whatever that code would only run when enough players are in the game so there you go nice practical example of how a while loop will work and we can actually test that right now if we head into play solo you can see that it says not enough plays in the game because there's only one person in the game but if somebody else joined then it would stop that wire loop because they would then be two players in the game so there we go a nice little brief introduction into while loops I hope that was useful so if you enjoyed it please do smash the like button on the video let me know that you're enjoying it and you want more and don't forget to share it with a friend who may want to learn about this get some more knowledge on wild loops so they're really important and that's all you need to know right now about what are loops so thanks for watching again sorry about the lack of videos recently but I do appreciate the support and I'll see you in the neck video Cheers
