00:00 - hey guys welcome back to episode number
00:01 - 13 in my scripting series it's gonna be
00:04 - a very quick video just to finish off
00:07 - the if statements part of the series
00:10 - that we've been doing so far we're gonna
00:11 - be looking at relational operators so
00:13 - when you are writing the if statement
00:16 - and you're writing your condition you
00:18 - don't always have to use the equal - now
00:20 - remember equal to or it has to be double
00:24 - equals when you are checking in an if
00:26 - statement just gotta remember that but
00:28 - also there are loads of other operators
00:31 - that you can use to check things so
00:34 - let's just get our condition in here so
00:36 - obviously we've got our if my number is
00:39 - equal to 50 then it's going to run the
00:41 - if statement but you can also do lots of
00:43 - other things and I'm going to go through
00:45 - them here so we've got greater than so
00:47 - you can have a greater than symbol here
00:49 - and that will check if your number is
00:53 - greater than another number you've also
00:56 - got less than here you've got greater
00:58 - than or equal to and you've got less
01:01 - than or equal to you've got not equal to
01:03 - so if basically any number that is not
01:07 - equal to 50 would make this this
01:09 - statement run so you've got your not
01:12 - equals which looks like this for me to
01:16 - write to this sign I do shift and press
01:18 - the hashtag key by Enter or return and
01:21 - also the equal sign I'll leave them all
01:24 - in the description though so you can
01:25 - copy them into your scripts we've also
01:29 - got we what we've had there greater than
01:32 - or equal to and the less than or equal
01:33 - to and the equals as well that is the
01:37 - main one that you'll use all the time
01:39 - but they've got loads of use cases you
01:42 - don't have to do it with numbers either
01:43 - you could have a string and you could
01:47 - check to see if let's call it my string
01:50 - here if my string is equal to hey then
01:55 - it will run the if statement you can't
01:57 - use the greater than or less than
02:00 - operators on a string though as its text
02:03 - you can only use those on numbers but
02:04 - you can use the not equal to one there
02:07 - as well so anything that is not equal to
02:10 - hey
02:11 - we'll make these statement run here
02:13 - obviously it didn't run in this case we
02:15 - didn't change our string if I was to
02:17 - change it to by it would work
02:21 - so there we go just for you to know and
02:24 - note down there are all your relational
02:26 - operators that you can use so make sure
