00:00 - in this video I'm gonna show you how to
00:01 - make a GUI appear on screen when you do
00:05 - some things such as stepping on a brick
00:07 - or walking up to something so let's
00:10 - begin so very simple how we do this and
00:13 - it involves a script on the server a
00:16 - script on the client and a remote events
00:18 - now this is all because of filtering
00:21 - enabled now if you're not too sure about
00:23 - how this works don't worry we will
00:26 - explain it as we go along but basically
00:28 - what it means is that the code that
00:31 - we're gonna write to detect when the
00:34 - brick gets touched is actually going to
00:36 - be running on the roblox server and the
00:39 - GUI is actually live on the client so
00:43 - the client is going to be the player
00:45 - that the GUI is going to show to on this
00:48 - server is where our code is stored and
00:51 - where it's going to run and we can't
00:53 - just access a player's
00:54 - and play a GUI from the server because
00:58 - filtering enabled stops us from doing
00:59 - this because it also helps us stop the
01:02 - exploiters so we have to use a remote
01:05 - event and what a remote event does is
01:09 - it's placed in replicated storage which
01:12 - is a place in the game where both the
01:15 - server and client can see things but
01:17 - only the server can make changes so what
01:20 - we can do is when we walk up to a brick
01:22 - we can fire an events and we can pick up
01:25 - that event on the client and when that
01:26 - event is picked up we can open up the
01:29 - GUI it sounds a little bit confusing but
01:31 - hopefully it will make sense as we go
01:33 - along so I'm just going to make this GUI
01:35 - invisible for now by setting the frames
01:39 - visible properties false you could also
01:41 - set this screen to you eyes enabled
01:43 - property to false if you want to make
01:44 - the entire GUI invisible but I'm going
01:47 - to then insert a script into service
01:49 - script service and I'm going to create
01:51 - an event and this events will detect
01:53 - when a player steps on a brick
01:55 - so we'll say game but workspace got
01:58 - parts got touched : Connect function
02:02 - then we write player in here so our
02:05 - player argument this is going to be the
02:07 - player that sorry we should say hit
02:10 - because it's going to be the brick that
02:12 - touches our part so
02:14 - the other brick that touches it we then
02:16 - have to actually see if the part that
02:19 - touched the parts the part that touched
02:23 - our brick over here is the thing that
02:25 - touches it we need to check if it's an
02:27 - actual body part of a player's character
02:29 - or we can just check that it is an
02:31 - actual player so to do that we can say
02:33 - if game dot players : gets player from
02:36 - character hit dot parents because if it
02:40 - is a body part that touches the part
02:42 - then its parent is going to be the
02:43 - character object of the player and then
02:46 - we can use this very nifty function
02:48 - which will basically tell us where there
02:51 - is an actual player in the game and if
02:53 - it is then we can fire our remote event
02:56 - and our remote event is going to tell
02:58 - the player to make the GUI visible so we
03:03 - need to create that remote event so
03:05 - we're going to say remote event put it
03:07 - in a replicated storage I'm gonna call
03:09 - it show GUI just so they're all
03:11 - organized and we know what everything
03:13 - does then I can say game but replicated
03:16 - storage dot show GUI : fire client and
03:22 - what its gonna do is gonna send a
03:24 - request to a specific client a specific
03:27 - player in the game so we know the player
03:31 - and we can get their player object by
03:33 - using this line again so we just put
03:36 - that in there this function here it
03:40 - returns the player object and in in this
03:44 - if statement if it does return a player
03:45 - objects we know that it's an actual
03:47 - player in the game so we are sending to
03:51 - this player a request to show our GUI so
03:57 - what we then do is we now need to do a
03:59 - bit of client coding so we've done the
04:02 - server coding because we're detecting
04:04 - whether the part has been touched on the
04:07 - server and the server is owned and
04:09 - controlled by roblox it's where all of
04:11 - our server scripts will go but then our
04:14 - client scripts are for things like GUI
04:17 - is and tools because the reason we have
04:20 - client scripts is because there's going
04:21 - to be lots of players in the game
04:23 - and each player might have a different
04:25 - DUI they might have a different GUI open
04:28 - at a certain time so different players
04:30 - will need client script so that we can
04:34 - control them all individually so let's
04:37 - insert a local script in this screen GUI
04:39 - and we need to setup an event for when
04:42 - our show GUI remote event is fired so we
04:46 - can say game dot replicate storage dot
04:49 - show GUI dot on client event so when we
04:53 - fire a client with fire client here and
04:55 - then we use on client event to pick up
04:58 - when we have fired client from the
05:00 - server curl on connects function and
05:05 - then we add this end in here and what's
05:08 - going to happen is any code in between
05:10 - these two lines is going to run when
05:12 - this remote event is fired from the
05:14 - server and so when it is fired we want
05:16 - to make the for the GUI visible so we
05:20 - can say scripts the parents dots frame
05:26 - dock visible equals not well we could
05:29 - set it to true but if I fired it again
05:32 - I'd then want it to set it to false I'd
05:34 - want to or want it to make invisible if
05:36 - I fired it again so just a quick way to
05:39 - turn it off and on it's just right
05:42 - equals not script the parent frame to
05:45 - visible and what it's going to do is
05:46 - it's going to set it to the opposite of
05:49 - what it currently is so if the GUI is
05:51 - currently invisible and then we get a
05:53 - and then we fire this event or the
05:56 - opposite of being invisible is visible
05:58 - so when we say not it's just saying the
06:01 - opposite of what what it currently is
06:03 - so if visible is currently false we're
06:04 - gonna set visible to true and if visible
06:06 - is true we're then going to set it to
06:08 - false so let's test this out and we're
06:14 - gonna head up to the brick we're gonna
06:16 - touch it and boom it appears and it says
06:22 - I want to appear when you touch your
06:23 - bricks and my GUI has become visible but
06:28 - then when I jump away from it I'm
06:30 - actually touching it again because I'm
06:31 - touching it
06:33 - again and it fires the remote event but
06:35 - you can see is sort of you know it keeps
06:37 - flashing on the screen and the reason
06:40 - for this is because the brick I can
06:44 - touch it multiple times with multiple
06:46 - body parts so it will fire there are
06:48 - motive en't lots of times and so what it
06:51 - does is it's this code is firing
06:53 - multiple times for each body part so
06:56 - it's going to just keep setting it on
06:57 - and off and on and off so we need to
06:59 - have a cool down so it's not constantly
07:02 - firing this event so we can make a
07:05 - debounce and the debounce
07:07 - just prevents us from firing the show
07:09 - GUI event all the time so it's kind of
07:13 - like a cool-down so you can create our
07:15 - cooldown I'm going to call it D bounce
07:18 - and let's set it to false I'm gonna say
07:21 - if if not D bounce then and then we're
07:30 - gonna say D bounce equals true then
07:33 - we're gonna have our code to check if
07:36 - it's a player and to fire the event
07:37 - we're gonna have a wait two seconds then
07:41 - we're gonna set D bounce to false again
07:45 - so this is a variable and this D bounce
07:48 - and what what we're saying here is if D
07:52 - bounce is false then we're allowed to
07:55 - run this code but if it's true we don't
07:57 - want to run this code so only when D
07:59 - bounce is set to false will we let this
08:01 - code run so when we do let it run we
08:04 - immediately set D bounce to true so it
08:07 - can't be triggered so when this part
08:09 - look touched is triggered again we can't
08:11 - fire the code for a second time and we
08:14 - wait two seconds and then we set D
08:15 - bounce to Fox
08:16 - so we're basically saying that there's a
08:18 - cool-down period of two seconds so you
08:21 - can only step on this brick every two
08:22 - seconds and make it fire the code
08:24 - because we've got all these different
08:26 - body parts here that could be touching
08:28 - the brick at the same time we don't want
08:30 - it to keep turning the GUI on and off
08:33 - really really quickly so if we step on
08:35 - the brick there we go and if we step on
08:37 - it again it's gonna disappear after two
08:40 - seconds actually I might've done
08:42 - something wrong here
08:43 - let's see oh no it seemed that we did it
08:46 - okay I think if we make this anchored
08:50 - and we set can collide to true and we
08:54 - make it look like an actual button here
08:55 - I think that wouldn't be better let's
08:58 - try that wait for it to load and if we
09:05 - step on the brick it appears if we step
09:08 - on it for a second time it disappears
09:11 - so there we go we have just created a
09:13 - part which will make a GUI appear when
09:15 - we click on it and it will also
09:19 - disappear when we click on it again if
09:21 - you didn't want it to disappear when you
09:22 - click on it again you could just set
09:24 - this to true and then have like a wait
09:26 - so after a certain amount of time it
09:29 - will disappear again you can add a line
09:33 - which sets it to follow us afterwards so
09:36 - let's try this one more time so the
09:38 - whole point of using the remote event is
09:39 - because we can't just find the player
09:43 - and disable and turn the GUI on and off
09:46 - from the server scripts because those
09:48 - who enabled which is designed to stop
09:50 - players from changing things on the
09:53 - server basically stops us from being
09:55 - able to access the things are in a
09:57 - player from from a server script so we
09:59 - have to use remote events to communicate
10:02 - between the server and the client so
10:04 - when we step on the brick and the server
10:06 - is actually detecting that but then we
10:08 - have to make a request to the client to
10:11 - show our GUI because the GUI is a
10:13 - managed on the client and this part and
10:15 - the script is managed on the server so
10:17 - the remote event is kind of like the man
10:19 - in the middle and it allows us to to
10:23 - show the GUI when we step on a brick so
10:25 - there we go that's how you make a GUI
10:27 - appear when you step on a brick I hope
10:29 - it was useful if it was please like the
10:31 - video share it with anyone you know
10:32 - please subscribe to my channel for more
10:34 - roblox scripting videos I have hundreds
10:36 - of videos teaching how to make great
