00:00 - hello everyone and welcome back to your
00:03 - second roblox scripting tutorial
00:05 - now in the previous video which i
00:06 - recommend you go and watch if you have
00:08 - not already it was on
00:09 - properties and in that video we
00:12 - encountered an
00:12 - error and the error was that we were
00:16 - writing some code which set the
00:18 - transparency
00:19 - property of a part which was named part
00:22 - in the workspace but actually we had
00:25 - then gone on to rename the part before
00:27 - we run the script
00:28 - and so it threw an error in our code
00:32 - now i'm going to show you how you can
00:34 - debug these errors because sometimes
00:36 - you'll be thinking
00:37 - well you know why is this script not
00:38 - working sometimes it might not even
00:40 - throw you an error message
00:42 - so how do you figure out the line where
00:45 - your script
00:46 - stopped working so imagine we've got
00:48 - lots of lines of code here all right
00:50 - let's just set this one to alvin block
00:52 - so it will actually work
00:54 - let's put this at the top here let's
00:56 - just do a couple of these
00:59 - right so in these lines of code one of
01:02 - them is not going to work
01:03 - so let's imagine we didn't know which
01:05 - one was going to cause the error
01:07 - what we could do is we could use
01:08 - printing so if we print
01:10 - we can print a message to this output
01:12 - window which i spoke about yesterday
01:15 - yesterday in the last video so we can
01:17 - print out a message
01:18 - and that message could be a number like
01:21 - 32
01:22 - and it will appear in the output window
01:24 - here there you go can you see that
01:26 - it's printed out 32. now you can also
01:29 - print out
01:30 - text but like i said in the previous
01:31 - video you can't just go
01:33 - writing out text like this you know
01:36 - hello guys
01:36 - that's not going to work and then you've
01:38 - got these lines underneath because the
01:40 - script
01:41 - is confused so what you need to do is
01:43 - because it's text we need to wrap it in
01:45 - a string
01:45 - by using speech marks so if we use
01:48 - speech marks
01:48 - it goes pink that tells us it's a string
01:51 - and now
01:52 - if we run the code is going to print
01:55 - my text hello guys so this is just
01:57 - printing a message
01:59 - to the script so you can see the
02:01 - potential uses
02:02 - of printing you could print out to say
02:05 - that a certain line
02:06 - has ran so we could do a print saying
02:09 - the script has started running
02:12 - and we can do another one after the the
02:15 - second line
02:16 - to say executed line two
02:20 - and let's do another one saying we've
02:22 - executed line four
02:24 - so we've we've got past line four and we
02:27 - could do another one to say we've got
02:28 - past
02:29 - line six and let's do another one at the
02:32 - end
02:32 - to say we have finished
02:36 - running now you don't have to do prints
02:37 - you know they're not you don't have to
02:39 - have a print
02:40 - to make your script work this is just to
02:42 - um
02:43 - tell you to give you messages to make
02:45 - sure that your script has
02:47 - operated and ran correctly right you
02:49 - don't have to do this for every script
02:50 - i would only do this when we encounter
02:52 - an error
02:53 - so let's run the code again and see what
02:55 - happens right so we've got our error
02:57 - here
02:58 - and we can see that the script had
03:00 - started to run printed the first print
03:03 - and then it's set the transparency of
03:05 - the part alvin blocks to zero
03:07 - that worked fine no errors there and
03:09 - then we go on to line three
03:11 - you see it's printed out executed line
03:13 - two so we've got here
03:15 - and then uh it doesn't print out this
03:18 - one so it doesn't print out executed
03:20 - line four
03:21 - instead we just get this error so you
03:23 - can see it works in order so
03:24 - script started running that's line one
03:27 - then it's executed line two
03:28 - because it's got this far but then we've
03:31 - got an error on line four
03:33 - so the script has totally stopped so
03:35 - when you get an error
03:36 - the script just uh grinds to a whole it
03:38 - stops in its tracks so it doesn't go any
03:40 - further
03:41 - it's got to this line and it's thought
03:43 - right okay
03:44 - game dot game.workspace.part so i'm
03:46 - going to look in the workspace
03:48 - for an object that's called part oh it's
03:50 - not there
03:52 - there's no object called part in the
03:53 - workspace i don't know what to do now
03:56 - so it's going to just stop right there
03:58 - and it's going to say right that's it
03:59 - i've had enough
04:01 - and that's the end of this script so
04:02 - it's not even going to print
04:04 - executed line 4 it's not going to do any
04:06 - of this even though this code is correct
04:09 - because we had an error up here this
04:11 - script has stopped
04:12 - and you can already see why errors are
04:14 - such a problem in scripting
04:16 - because imagine if this script was your
04:18 - main game script
04:20 - which was like controlling your game
04:21 - loop so you had a murder mystery game
04:23 - and then you get an error right it's
04:25 - gonna just stop the game
04:27 - everyone's going to crash out the game
04:28 - and leave so errors
04:30 - are really bad and most of the time
04:33 - they're caused due to typos
04:35 - and in this case they are indeed caused
04:38 - by a typo because we called this part
04:40 - part instead of alvin blocks so if you
04:43 - see an error in the output window
04:45 - don't fear just try and use printing to
04:48 - identify
04:48 - where the problem happened if your
04:50 - script didn't work your script when you
04:52 - get an output message like this an error
04:54 - message
04:55 - it should usually say which line it
04:57 - fails on in this case
04:59 - it said line four and it gives us the
05:01 - script name it tells us
05:02 - that it was a server script we'll get
05:04 - into what server scripts are in a later
05:06 - video
05:07 - but it gives you a decent error message
05:09 - saying part is not a valid member of
05:11 - workspace
05:12 - you can interpret that as the script
05:14 - saying i looked in the workspace for an
05:16 - object
05:16 - called part but it wasn't there so i
05:18 - stopped running
05:19 - and now that i fixed the problem let's
05:21 - run the script again
05:23 - and here you go so again ignore this
05:26 - error here
05:27 - it's completely unrelated you can say
05:30 - you can see here the script started to
05:31 - run
05:32 - executed line two executed line four
05:34 - executed line six
05:36 - and we have finished running so there
05:38 - you go the script
05:39 - ran perfectly without any errors and
05:41 - once it gets to the bottom of the script
05:43 - with no more
05:44 - lines of code to go it will just stop
05:47 - running so this script is no longer
05:48 - running
05:49 - it says executed it is at the end of
05:52 - its life thanks for watching drop a like

05:55 - useful to you don't forget to subscribe

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone and welcome back to your second roblox scripting tutorial now in the previous video which i recommend you go and watch if you have not already it was on properties and in that video we encountered an error and the error was that we were writing some code which set the transparency property of a part which was named part in the workspace but actually we had then gone on to rename the part before we run the script and so it threw an error in our code now i'm going to show you how you can debug these errors because sometimes you'll be thinking well you know why is this script not working sometimes it might not even throw you an error message so how do you figure out the line where your script stopped working so imagine we've got lots of lines of code here all right let's just

didn't know which one was going to cause the error what we could do is we could use printing so if we print we can print a message to this output window which i spoke about yesterday yesterday in the last video so we can print out a message and that message could be a number like 32 and it will appear in the output window here there you go can you see that it's printed out 32. now you can also print out text but like i said in the previous video you can't just go writing out text like this you know hello guys that's not going to work and then you've got these lines underneath because the script is confused so what you need to do is because it's text we need to wrap it in a string by using speech marks so if we use speech marks it goes pink that tells us it's a string and now if we run the code is going to print my text hello guys so this is just printing a message to the script so you can see the potential uses of printing you could print out to say that a certain line has ran so we could do a print saying the script has started running and we can do another one after the the second line to say executed line two and let's do another one saying we've executed line four so we've we've got past line four and we could do another one to say we've got past line six and let's do another one at the end to say we have finished running now you don't have to do prints you know they're not you don't have to have a print to make your script work this is just to um tell you to give you messages to make sure that your script has operated and ran correctly right you don't have to do

that's line one then it's executed line two because it's got this far but then we've got an error on line four so the script has totally stopped so when you get an error the script just uh grinds to a whole it stops in its tracks so it doesn't go any further it's got to this line and it's thought right okay game dot game.workspace.part so i'm going to look in the workspace for an object that's called part oh it's not there there's no object called part in the workspace i don't know what to do now so it's going to just stop right there and it's going to say right that's it i've had enough and that's the end of this script so it's not even going to print executed line 4 it's not going to do any of this even though this code is correct because we had an error up here this script has
