00:00 - right I'm gonna show you how to add a
00:02 - loading screen to your roblox game so
00:05 - firstly go ahead and create a loading
00:07 - GUI so I'm gonna insert a screen GI and
00:10 - start GUI I'm gonna call this loading
00:13 - screen and side of here I'm gonna add a
00:15 - frame now this frame I'm gonna set the
00:19 - size to 1 comma 0 comma 1 comma 0 ok so
00:23 - it fills up the entirety of the x-axis
00:25 - and the entirety of the y-axis okay I'm
00:29 - also gonna set border size pixel to 0
00:31 - and then inside of there I'm gonna
00:33 - insert a text label now you don't have
00:36 - to make your GUI the same as mine I'm
00:37 - just making it really basic so I'm gonna
00:40 - go to my text label I'm gonna set the
00:42 - position to naught point 5 comments 0
00:44 - comic naught point 5 comma 0 so this in
00:47 - the middle of both axes and then I'm
00:49 - gonna set the anchor point to not 0.5
00:51 - and 0.5 so it is truly in the middle you
00:54 - can see the anchor point that's now in
00:55 - the middle and then I'm going to set the
00:57 - border size pixels to 0 and the size
01:00 - I'll just keep that the same I only set
01:02 - text scaled to be checked I'll change
01:06 - the font a bit as well and I'll set the
01:07 - text to say loading ok you can do some
01:10 - extra code if you want to make the GUI
01:12 - look nice maybe make these gee these
01:14 - loading dots and animate or flash or
01:17 - something but once you've got your GUI
01:19 - and we're gonna go and place it well
01:21 - first we're gonna go into replicate it
01:23 - first and insert a local script into
01:25 - there then take your loading screen and
01:27 - paste the GUI into that local scripts
01:30 - now if you didn't know what became his
01:32 - first is replicated first basically
01:35 - anything inside a run hit first it's
01:38 - gonna be replicated to all clients so
01:40 - players in the game and therefore
01:42 - anything else is okay so it's not store
01:44 - on server the server doesn't see it it's
01:46 - only for storing things that go to the
01:49 - clients in the game in this case the
01:51 - loading screen because only the players
01:53 - you can see the loading screen not the
01:54 - server so we firstly need to remove the
01:58 - default loading screen and the default
02:00 - loading screen you might you may have
02:01 - seen it before it looks like this okay
02:04 - and it just basically plays until the
02:06 - game is loaded so let's go back in here
02:08 - and to disable it all you have to do is
02:10 - say game
02:12 - first and say :
02:16 - remove default loading screen okay and
02:20 - that is gonna remove it you may see it
02:21 - very quickly but it won't be it won't
02:25 - stay on the screen for a prolonged
02:26 - amount of time okay even when the game
02:28 - has pretty much loaded so next we need
02:31 - to get the players player GUI so local
02:35 - player GUI and player GUI is where all
02:37 - of their GUI elements are stored you
02:39 - might say oh well they're stalling
02:41 - startegy or actually but that's not true
02:43 - they get replicated or cloned into
02:45 - player GUI when they join the game so we
02:48 - can wait for that to be added in by
02:49 - saying game got players dots local
02:52 - player curran wait for child player GUI
02:56 - and once we've got that we can say
02:58 - player GUI come on set top bar
03:02 - transparency to zero now we're doing
03:06 - this
03:06 - whoops put nine I mean zero we're doing
03:08 - this because we don't want the player to
03:09 - see anything going on in the game whilst
03:12 - it's still loading that will just make
03:13 - it opaque so we can't see through it
03:15 - next thing when you do need to clone the
03:16 - GUI so we'd say local GUI equals script
03:19 - dots the loading screen curl on clone so
03:23 - just make a duplicate of it and then we
03:24 - can say GUI dot parent equals player GUI
03:28 - so we're just putting it into players
03:29 - play GUI so they can see it and then you
03:32 - can do a weight here so you could either
03:33 - wait for a certain number of seconds and
03:35 - then after that amount of seconds you
03:39 - could tween the GUI off-screen so you
03:41 - could say GUI door frame : tween
03:43 - position you could say you dim to new
03:48 - zero zero one zero so it just goes off
03:50 - the screen goes downwards I think say in
03:53 - out or another easing direction or
03:56 - easing style I'm gonna use sign and I'm
03:58 - going to set it to null point five and
04:00 - that will just release that will
04:01 - smoothly tween it then after no point
04:04 - five seconds I'm gonna say GUI :
04:07 - destroyed okay so it's destroyed from
04:08 - the player GUI and I won't come back
04:10 - when they reset okay so now that we've
04:15 - done that I said you can either wait
04:16 - five seconds or you could say repeat
04:21 - wait repeat Waits
04:25 - one until game is loaded okay and that's
04:29 - gonna play the GUI until the games
04:31 - loaded if you've got a game that doesn't
04:33 - take long to load the players won't see
04:35 - the loading GUI very long so you could
04:37 - just keep it to a wait five but bear in
04:39 - mind the game may not fully be loaded by
04:41 - then and you can change this wait number
04:42 - to have many seconds you want it to be
04:45 - on screen for okay so let's go and check
04:47 - it out I'm gonna click on play and let's
04:49 - see if our load UI works so the goats is
04:51 - loading loading loading and then
04:53 - actually about five seconds about now it
04:55 - goes off screen and if we try and reset
04:58 - it won't come back up because it got
05:00 - destroyed from our player GUI so there
05:03 - we go we've just created a loading
05:05 - screen in roblox to do so if you enjoy
