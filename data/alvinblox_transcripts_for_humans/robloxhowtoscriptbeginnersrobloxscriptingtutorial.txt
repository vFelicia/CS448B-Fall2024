00:00 - in this video I'm gonna be teaching you
00:03 - how to script on roblox for beginners
00:05 - I'm going to show you all of the basic
00:07 - things that you need to know about
00:09 - roblox scripting let's get straight into
00:11 - it alright so welcome back to another
00:19 - video my name is ivan blocks and I've
00:21 - been on roblox for almost seven years
00:23 - now and developing for nearly 5 years so
00:26 - I know how to use roblox studio platform
00:28 - and I know how to script and I want you
00:31 - to script as well scripting is really
00:34 - really awesome it lets you make your
00:35 - games more interactive because you don't
00:38 - have to be there making it work you can
00:40 - make your games work for you and then
00:42 - once you know how to script you can make
00:44 - great games and you can make money from
00:46 - those games so if you want to do that
00:49 - then make sure that you follow along and
00:50 - in this video I'm gonna show you the
00:53 - basic concepts of scripting and what you
00:56 - need to know so let's get started then
00:58 - and this is the roblox studio if you
01:01 - don't know how to open it up then if you
01:03 - have a plate of roblox game before the
01:05 - roblox studio will be installed on your
01:07 - computer alright so you just need to do
01:09 - a search on your computer for the roblox
01:11 - studio and then you'll be prompted to
01:13 - sign in and then if you click on a base
01:16 - plate or press ctrl n you'll be brought
01:18 - to this screen alright so to get started
01:23 - with scripting we're going to insert a
01:25 - script into the workspace ok
01:28 - so let's insert a script we're going to
01:30 - right click on the workspace hover over
01:31 - insert objects and click on script now
01:34 - I'm just going to show you how this all
01:36 - works now we've got our ribbon bar at
01:39 - the top of the screen that's where all
01:41 - of our tools are a bit like a Microsoft
01:43 - Word we've got all of our tabs at the
01:45 - top home model terrain test View plugins
01:48 - and the script menu home is useful when
01:51 - you are making parts when you're
01:54 - building because you've got access to
01:56 - the tool box where you can insert models
01:59 - into your game just like that you've got
02:02 - the parts you can insert parts into your
02:05 - game and you can change the color of
02:07 - them you can change their material etc
02:10 - so
02:12 - that's the home tab now you can find
02:15 - more building tools in the model tab you
02:18 - can see we can move our parts we can
02:19 - just click on a part we can move it with
02:22 - a move tool
02:23 - we can scale it to make it bigger and we
02:25 - can also rotate it so I advise you to
02:27 - have a play with that but that is the
02:30 - ribbon menu we can do terrain which we
02:34 - might learn about another tutorial you
02:36 - can test out your game click on the play
02:38 - button to launch an environment with
02:41 - your game to run scripts you can also
02:43 - run scripts without having a player in
02:46 - the game and you can also have a view
02:48 - here now this is what we need to focus
02:50 - on right now our view is where we're
02:52 - going to open up all of our panels okay
02:55 - so this these things are panels okay the
02:58 - output here the properties tab the
03:00 - explore tab these are all panels and to
03:02 - open them you need to go to the View tab
03:04 - so you can see you've got properties and
03:06 - Explorer now Explorer is where we will
03:08 - find all the parts and objects in the
03:10 - game environment all right so we're
03:12 - going to make sure that that's opened up
03:13 - and we've also got the properties tab
03:15 - here so make sure that's opened up as
03:16 - well that's where we can edit parts for
03:18 - example the brick color I can change
03:20 - that from the properties window all
03:22 - right
03:23 - so in our script we're just going to
03:25 - delete these these parts first so just
03:27 - select them all right so we've got our
03:31 - script and I'm just going to show you
03:33 - the basic parts of roblox scripting now
03:35 - so the first thing you need to know are
03:37 - variables okay variables that they hold
03:40 - piece of data now if you use any other
03:43 - programming language before you will
03:44 - know what they are but if you haven't
03:46 - it's used to store data okay so for
03:48 - example we can have a variable called
03:50 - hello okay and we could set that value
03:53 - to 50 all right now let's have another
03:56 - variable and we're going to call it bye
03:59 - all right bye equals 20 now if I wanted
04:02 - to add these two variables together
04:04 - these two pieces of data if I said print
04:08 - okay print what this will do is it will
04:11 - print a message to the output or it will
04:14 - put some text in the output window hey
04:16 - the output window you can find it by
04:18 - clicking view and output this is where
04:21 - errors will be reported from our scripts
04:23 - if we've done something wrong or if you
04:24 - want to send messages
04:25 - to make sure that something has happened
04:27 - and it's run correctly all right so when
04:29 - we say print and let's just put a string
04:33 - inside of here a string is a piece of
04:35 - text or some words so you can say print
04:37 - and then in the brackets in the speech
04:40 - marks for a string we can say hi there
04:42 - all right now let's go and run this all
04:45 - right we're gonna press the Run button
04:47 - if you don't see the one button just
04:50 - click that little arrow underneath the
04:52 - run and select it but you can see it
04:53 - says hi there all right and it's printed
04:55 - hi there to the output so that's how you
04:57 - do printing so if I want to add these
05:00 - two variables together you can say hello
05:03 - plus Phi okay now let's run this and you
05:08 - can see we get 70 all right we didn't
05:10 - get hello bye it didn't print hello bye
05:12 - out it printed 70 now that's because
05:14 - hello and bye have their own data inside
05:17 - of them okay so hello has the number 50
05:20 - and by has the number 20 attributed to
05:24 - it okay because we've defined the
05:26 - variable here okay so we've said give by
05:28 - a value of 20 and give hello of I or 50
05:31 - so we're printing hello plus bye so
05:35 - imagine we're adding the values of these
05:38 - variables together
05:39 - so 50 at 20 all right so we've just add
05:41 - two numbers together basic basic maths
05:44 - there all right so that's how you use
05:48 - variable that's how you set up a
05:49 - variable you give it a name you give an
05:51 - equal sign and then over here you say
05:53 - what it would be what you want to store
05:55 - you can store lots of other things in
05:57 - variables we can store boolean x' so my
06:01 - variable equals true okay or we could
06:05 - say my variable equals false a boolean
06:07 - value is something that is true or false
06:09 - it can either be true or false it can't
06:12 - be anything else or you can also store a
06:14 - string a string as I said is a piece of
06:17 - text hi there this is a string you can
06:22 - tell us a string because it's got speech
06:23 - marks around it and it's also purple and
06:26 - so that tells us a string now if we just
06:28 - print my variable it's going to print hi
06:32 - there this is a string okay
06:34 - let's try out then I click on the green
06:36 - Run button
06:37 - hi there this is a string
06:39 - and it printed all right so you can see
06:42 - how we print things to the output now
06:45 - when we're making games we will print
06:47 - variables often to make sure
06:49 - everything's running fine and we want to
06:51 - test our game out
06:52 - so that's variables okay and what we're
06:55 - doing printing we know the printer
06:57 - variable okay
06:58 - or we can print text so if I just wanted
07:00 - to actually print the words my variable
07:02 - not the not the actual value we can put
07:06 - this in speech marks to show that it is
07:08 - a string okay we'll play the game
07:12 - look how to click the play solo button
07:14 - that means that my character will be
07:16 - inserted into the game environment but
07:19 - you can see it's printed my variable
07:20 - because we told it to to actually print
07:22 - my variable not the value of it but if
07:25 - we got rid of the speech marks and we
07:29 - run it again
07:30 - you can see it prints the value of the
07:33 - my variable variable which is higher
07:35 - this is trim so that is printing and how
07:38 - you print things to the output as well
07:40 - as variables now variables will be used
07:42 - when you're making games to store bits
07:43 - of data for example in the murder in a
07:46 - murder type game like a murder mystery
07:49 - or the mad murderer if you haven't
07:50 - played those games before you would have
07:52 - to you'd have to store the name of the
07:54 - murderer who's the murderer who's the
07:56 - sheriff for example if you're in
07:58 - jailbreak you'll have to store a number
08:01 - and that would be how much money you
08:03 - could get from the bank the maximum
08:05 - amount of money you could steal from the
08:06 - Train for example so variables are used
08:09 - all the time in roblox for making games
08:11 - and it is very very basic but very is
08:14 - you've got to know it really because
08:16 - every game will use it so that is a
08:19 - variable let's just click on stop here
08:21 - and that will just kill the game
08:23 - environment and send us back to this
08:25 - free roam mode okay now let's move on to
08:29 - the next part which is properties okay
08:33 - now properties are everywhere in roblox
08:36 - now there will be in parts they'll be in
08:40 - scripts any object in roblox will have
08:43 - properties now you can see we've got the
08:46 - properties tab down here okay now let's
08:48 - go in insert a part into the game okay
08:51 - we've just clips on the part button in
08:52 - the
08:53 - tab and that's inserted apart for us
08:55 - okay now you can mess around with this
08:57 - part whatever you want but let's look at
09:00 - the properties tab alright we've got
09:02 - lots of different options here we can
09:04 - change the brick color we can change the
09:06 - material we can change the reflectance
09:10 - we can change the transparency lots of
09:13 - different things to change these are all
09:15 - called properties the transparency is a
09:17 - property the color is a property of that
09:19 - part okay
09:21 - the name is a property we can change
09:23 - this parts name to brick if we wanted to
09:26 - we can change its orientation how its
09:29 - rotated okay we can let's just make this
09:33 - not transparent we can change the
09:35 - orientation which is the rotation we can
09:37 - change the position okay we can change
09:40 - it with the move tool or we can just
09:41 - change it from this property here lots
09:44 - of different properties which we can
09:45 - change okay now you see that we can
09:48 - change them manually but we can also
09:50 - change them via a script and I'm going
09:53 - to show you how to do this
09:54 - but let's just go over some of the basic
09:56 - properties of a part okay because you
09:59 - might not know what they're for the
10:01 - color and the material are quite obvious
10:03 - they are the the material is look if I
10:05 - change it you can see the different
10:08 - material names reflects how it looks
10:09 - let's just keep a pebble and the
10:12 - reflectance is how it will reflect the
10:16 - Sun off the part and the transparency
10:19 - obvious self-explanatory now the class
10:23 - name is what type of object it is now we
10:25 - can't change that because we know that
10:29 - it's a part and if we would have asked
10:31 - this script its class name is a script
10:34 - and the part is a part because that's
10:37 - what roblox our set is soo the name of
10:40 - the part we can change that the
10:41 - orientation is the rotation of the park
10:44 - it has three values because it's made up
10:46 - of something called vector three and
10:48 - we'll come to that later on in this
10:49 - tutorial but it's an x y&z value and
10:52 - that makes up the orientation of the pot
10:55 - okay the parent what the parent is is
11:00 - basically what this part is inside of so
11:02 - at the minute it's inside of something
11:04 - called the workspace will also come to
11:06 - that later on
11:07 - and so if we were to put this part
11:09 - inside of the script okay the parent is
11:13 - going to change to script all right
11:15 - there we go change to scripts because
11:17 - it's now inside of the script it's now a
11:19 - child of the script but let's put it
11:21 - back in the workspace and there we go
11:23 - it's changed back to workspace the
11:26 - position that is also quite
11:27 - self-explanatory its whereabouts is on
11:30 - the map the rock velocity and velocity
11:32 - will not that's quite advanced you might
11:35 - come back to that later on but it's
11:37 - basically about how it travels how quick
11:42 - it travels if you were to move it all
11:44 - right so let's move on to behaviors now
11:47 - okay so we've got anchored now anchored
11:49 - if I show you this this pipe if I move
11:52 - up into the sky and I set the anchor
11:54 - property to false and I run the game the
11:57 - part is going to fall out of the sky all
11:59 - right there we go it fell out the sky
12:00 - but if now I set the anchored property
12:03 - to true all right there we go
12:07 - it stays in the air so that's anchored
12:08 - and the same thing with can collide here
12:11 - when can collide is set to false it
12:13 - means that anything can go through the
12:15 - part but if you have can collide set to
12:17 - true it means that the part will collide
12:20 - with other parts and other objects and
12:22 - it will use physics okay and so that's
12:25 - all you need to know really another one
12:27 - is locked that means you can't touch the
12:30 - part or edit it or select it which is
12:32 - helpful if you want to select a number
12:33 - of parts but you don't want to select
12:35 - some others so that is the locked
12:37 - property now these are quite advanced
12:39 - and we'll get to that later on except
12:41 - for the size which is also vector three
12:43 - and we'll get to that in another part of
12:45 - this tutorial so their properties but
12:47 - you want to know how to change these
12:48 - properties automatically from a script
12:50 - right well it's quite easy let's just
12:52 - get rid of this variable which we just
12:54 - worked on and let's look at properties
12:56 - now clear properties by the way this is
12:59 - a comment and it's green and that tells
13:02 - you it's a comment and we started with
13:03 - two hyphens now when it's a comment when
13:07 - it's green it means that the script is
13:08 - going to ignore it a case a note for you
13:10 - so that you know what you're doing and
13:12 - it's just a little reminder so I like to
13:14 - use comments I let me know you know when
13:16 - I finished when I finished doing
13:18 - something I want to pick up another time
13:19 - I can write
13:20 - comment to tell myself where I got to
13:22 - and what I'm gonna do next so the script
13:24 - totally ignores it it just allows us to
13:26 - have some notes so we want the change of
13:29 - property now very very simple we need to
13:31 - first reference the object we want to
13:34 - change okay
13:35 - now referencing is how I like to call it
13:38 - it's basically getting apart getting a
13:41 - part which is nested somewhat from the
13:43 - script okay because we don't know how to
13:45 - get this part okay which they want to
13:48 - change the baseplates property well we
13:50 - can't just say baseplates okay because
13:52 - we don't the script doesn't know where
13:54 - this base plate is held now I'm going to
13:56 - tell you something about how roblox
13:58 - works here now we've got the Explorer
14:00 - here and basically we have lots of
14:04 - things here okay they're called services
14:06 - but each service has a different role
14:10 - okay so workspace is where parts are
14:13 - stored okay and parts bricks models all
14:18 - of the buildings in your game that's
14:19 - where they'll be stored okay for you to
14:21 - see them if you want to interact with
14:22 - the brick if you want to touch it and
14:25 - you want to see it in the game world
14:27 - it'll always be in the workspace all
14:29 - right let me just prove this to you
14:31 - let's take this brick and let's move it
14:33 - to server storage it's gone okay we
14:36 - can't interact with it anymore let's
14:38 - let's put it in the starter GUI it's
14:40 - still gone starter pack gone start to
14:42 - play it go on sound surface gone chat
14:45 - gone we're lighting gone players gone
14:48 - replicate storage gone you see that
14:52 - they're gone they're not they don't show
14:54 - up unless they're in the workspace
14:56 - alright so that's where parts go if you
14:58 - want to see them for example if we have
15:00 - a map in a game which you don't want to
15:01 - have loaded in yet but we might load it
15:04 - in another time we can just keep it in
15:05 - the server storage okay but the
15:09 - workspace and the server script service
15:11 - and the server storage they are in the
15:14 - server okay now let me tell you how
15:16 - roblox works now when you join a roblox
15:19 - game you are called a client okay and a
15:22 - client is someone who's playing on their
15:24 - computers and connecting to a game
15:27 - server now let's just take a look at a
15:29 - game for example okay so this is
15:32 - jailbreak it's the most popular
15:34 - box game if you didn't know but
15:36 - jailbreak let's take this for example
15:38 - when we are going to play jailbreak and
15:40 - we click on that big green play button
15:42 - we are the client and we are going to
15:45 - connect to that game okay
15:46 - now every game which you join will have
15:49 - something called a server okay now we
15:52 - have servers here and there's gonna be
15:53 - loads of servers okay which you connect
15:56 - to you're going to connect to one of
15:57 - them alright and in this server is where
16:00 - all the scripts are run alright and
16:02 - you're just connecting to that game as a
16:04 - client and so when you connect to that
16:06 - game you start talking to the server the
16:10 - client your computer starts it connects
16:12 - to the server and starts talking sending
16:14 - sending messages to one another and
16:17 - saying I want to join this game load me
16:19 - in and the server will load you in and
16:21 - keep communicating okay so your client
16:24 - will tell the server when you for
16:28 - example press a key okay when you press
16:30 - the W key your computer is telling the
16:32 - server on roblox's end which houses all
16:35 - the game and all the scripts and
16:37 - everything nor the buildings
16:38 - I'm your player the client will tell you
16:41 - the server to move your player because
16:43 - you're pressing the W key which makes
16:45 - you move forward so whenever you're
16:47 - sending keyboard input from your client
16:49 - it's going to the server and so we have
16:53 - some services are in the server right
16:56 - such as the workspace because that's
16:58 - where all the scripts and the parts are
17:00 - held and some are only client ok for
17:04 - example the starter GUI and the starter
17:07 - pack and the starter player they are all
17:09 - on the client ok they're all on your
17:11 - computer on your roblox game you just
17:13 - don't see them but that's how we have
17:15 - the GU eyes on the screen there will in
17:18 - the start they start to GUI your tools
17:20 - which you use to play with for example a
17:23 - sword that will be in your starter pack
17:25 - and start a player is where some scripts
17:28 - might run but we'll get to that another
17:30 - time it's where scripts can run on your
17:32 - client so we have the client talking to
17:37 - the server and it's all good and we have
17:39 - the workspace the server script service
17:42 - and the server storage and the lighting
17:45 - I think which are on the server there
17:47 - servers end and they are there basically
17:50 - because if they're on every client okay
17:54 - people can lag anak and it would be too
17:57 - powerful for one player to run all of
17:59 - this on their computer so we use servers
18:01 - you connect to a server part scripts and
18:04 - other things I want that server we just
18:06 - connect to it so we're able to see them
18:08 - because a game usually has multiple
18:11 - players the server will have multiple
18:14 - clients connected to it okay and so when
18:16 - one client does something for example
18:18 - move their character the server will see
18:20 - that and we'll update the game for
18:23 - everyone else taking everyone in sync so
18:25 - the server manages every player make
18:28 - sure everything is is working together
18:30 - and make sure everything's happening at
18:32 - the same time for everyone so that's a
18:33 - simple way of saying it but the
18:37 - workspace is where parts are stored and
18:39 - server script surface is where scripts
18:42 - can be stored they can also be stored in
18:43 - the workspace makes no difference and
18:46 - the service storage is where you can
18:47 - store parts which you don't need yet in
18:49 - the server it's always good to saw your
18:51 - parts in the server anyway because it
18:53 - means that people well people can can
18:55 - export your game we might get to this
18:57 - later on I'm not sure but basically
18:59 - people can exploit your game when they
19:03 - run a cheap like cheat engine on the
19:07 - computer or something like that which
19:09 - edits the game and then the server will
19:11 - see that change and will edit it for
19:13 - everyone else and because filtering
19:14 - enabled isn't turned on but you might
19:16 - get to that another time I've got a
19:18 - filter enabled you to on my channel if
19:19 - you want to see it go to the link in the
19:21 - top right of your screen so we're going
19:25 - to just deal with the workspace for now
19:26 - we're going to deal with changing the
19:28 - property so to reference an item in the
19:31 - workspace we can we can say game ok
19:34 - because all of these services are in
19:36 - something called game ok our game we
19:38 - just call it game and then we want to
19:40 - specify the service service I can't say
19:42 - it but we'll say workspace ok because
19:45 - that's where the parts are stored and
19:47 - then we can say brick faceplate okay so
19:50 - we've got our base plate you can see how
19:52 - the script recognized that the script
19:54 - saw the base plate as we're typing it we
19:57 - know that we've got the right place
19:58 - we've got we've got the right base plate
19:59 - now so we can change it
20:01 - see by specifying which props you want
20:03 - to change so you'd say dot and then we
20:05 - can choose the property you can see
20:07 - you've got a list here of properties we
20:09 - can change so let's go and change the
20:12 - color property okay now if you want to
20:15 - change this color property we have to
20:17 - specify a color so to do that we have to
20:19 - say brick color dot new open bracket
20:23 - close bracket and then inside of these
20:25 - brackets in speech marks we can actually
20:28 - say a color now the color has to be
20:31 - correctly spell and it has to have
20:33 - capitals correct and everything to find
20:35 - a list of colors you can just go to the
20:37 - base plate and click on brick color and
20:39 - then you get this palette so just hover
20:42 - over color I new get its name so new
20:44 - yellow we'll call this one with the
20:48 - capital n and the capital wife and new
20:50 - and yellow we have just changed the base
20:53 - plates color using a script now let's go
20:56 - and test this game out with me click on
20:57 - run and hopefully the base plate changes
21:00 - to yellow I'm going to wait for it and
21:08 - it will take a little while to load
21:10 - there we go oh we got an error and the
21:14 - error is bad argument number two to
21:16 - color number three to color color
21:18 - through expected but got a brick color
21:21 - now this is because we selected the
21:23 - wrong property we selected the color
21:25 - property not the brick color now in
21:27 - roblox where you want to change the
21:29 - color you can either choose it from an
21:31 - odd RGB value red green blue and you can
21:34 - actually select one like this or you can
21:36 - select a predefined color called brick
21:38 - color now I like to always use brick
21:40 - color so I'm going to say brick color
21:42 - like that okay now if we try it again
21:45 - it should work there we go it changes to
21:48 - bright yellow but what if you wanted to
21:50 - use a custom color well you can do that
21:52 - you can just use the color property like
21:54 - we did before but instead of using brick
21:57 - color we have to say color color three
22:01 - okay because colors are made up of three
22:02 - values RGB red green blue and then we
22:06 - say dot from RGB because we're getting
22:10 - it from red green blue and we need our
22:12 - three values of red green and blue
22:14 - so let's do two five five zero zero
22:16 - because we want it all to be read and we
22:18 - don't want it to be any other color so
22:21 - let's run it again and it should go
22:22 - totally red there we go so we've just
22:24 - changed the base plates colors property
22:27 - by using color three and brick color so
22:30 - there's two ways to do that let's change
22:32 - another property let's change the
22:34 - transparency prophecy so I'm just going
22:37 - to get rid of the dot color and I'm
22:39 - going to change it to dot transparency
22:41 - game dot workspace base pay transparency
22:45 - equals one all right now what do you
22:49 - think is gonna happen when I set it to
22:51 - one because of the minute it's set to
22:52 - zero and it we can see we can see it all
22:55 - right now what what do you think will
22:57 - happen if we set it to the other end of
22:58 - the spectrum and one it's going to go
23:01 - completely transparent now it's still
23:03 - there we just can't see it and to prove
23:05 - it I'll go into the workspace and select
23:07 - it you can see that it's selected
23:09 - because we've got these little blue
23:11 - outlines it's just that we can't see it
23:14 - because it's totally transparent now
23:16 - let's go and take the slider and start
23:18 - to drag it all the way back you can see
23:20 - that we can start to see it again before
23:22 - it becomes fully opaque that's the
23:24 - transparency property and that's a
23:27 - number of property you see we we
23:29 - controlled it by a number instead of a
23:31 - string or brick color now let's go and
23:33 - try and change the anchored property
23:36 - okay they split the anchored you can see
23:40 - it's got a checkbox so we know that it
23:42 - must be a a boolean value so either true
23:44 - or false
23:45 - so remember anchored means whether it
23:47 - can fall out of the sky or not now we
23:49 - want it to be anchored stuck into the
23:51 - sky it's stuck in the air so we can just
23:53 - say true so yes we want to anchored so
23:56 - true now let's run this and it shouldn't
24:00 - move it should just stay in the air
24:02 - there we go now let's go back to our
24:05 - script and change it to false and run
24:08 - again and the base plate is going to
24:10 - fall out of the sky now where Smith
24:13 - falls out of the sky once it heats once
24:15 - it hits a certain position it will just
24:18 - delete itself and you can see it's it's
24:20 - been deleted from the workspace now you
24:23 - can change this in the workspace there's
24:25 - actually a property in the workspace
24:27 - I think it's here yeah it's called
24:30 - fallen parts destroy height and if we
24:32 - change that to maybe 3000 that means
24:35 - it's going to have to go down 3,000
24:38 - studs before it deletes now just four
24:41 - just so you know once stood is it's this
24:44 - site is this small okay so the distance
24:48 - between one store to another is that
24:50 - much so if you thinking 3,000 studs it's
24:53 - gonna be quite big all right let's try
24:54 - it again let's see if it good if it
24:56 - stays in the air any longer okay so it
25:01 - should stay in the air six times as
25:03 - longer because we said it's in - 3,000
25:06 - and watch it's been deleted from the
25:08 - workspace when it fell all right so that
25:10 - is how you do the anchored property I'm
25:13 - gonna let you experiment with some more
25:15 - properties of your own so let me know if
25:17 - you discovered it any new ones in the
25:19 - comment section below
25:20 - alright let's move on to the next part
25:22 - of the tutorial and the next part is
25:25 - going to be positions make sure that
25:30 - you've given me a thumbs up so far and
25:31 - let me know if you're enjoying it in the
25:33 - comments as well okay so in roblox when
25:38 - we want to change the position of a
25:40 - brick we can just move it around okay we
25:42 - can also use the Move tool if you want
25:44 - to move it on a straight line or if you
25:46 - want to move it or pull down now when
25:48 - we're moving this the position property
25:50 - is always changing let's have a look at
25:52 - that position property okay so we can
25:55 - see at the minute it's set to minus
25:56 - seventy thirty five point four five and
25:58 - minus one hundred and ten point four to
26:01 - five now this position property is made
26:04 - up of three values okay
26:05 - x y&z all right each value representing
26:09 - a specific direction now which direction
26:12 - does it go in well that's a good
26:13 - question now we can open up the we click
26:16 - on view and we can open up the display
26:18 - access to see which direction each one
26:21 - goes in now if you look down here the
26:23 - display axis is saying the green line is
26:26 - going in the Y direction the red line is
26:29 - going in the X direction and the blue
26:31 - line is going in the Z direction okay so
26:34 - if we move it with the red arrows with
26:36 - the Move tool to get the move tool you
26:38 - can just click on home and then move
26:40 - and select the pot when we move it you
26:43 - can see that the first value the x value
26:46 - here is changing now it's decreasing
26:49 - actually it's increasing because it's a
26:52 - negative number when we move it to the
26:54 - left and it's decreasing as we move it
26:56 - to the right that is the x value now if
26:59 - we click on the arrow here that will
27:02 - open up the x y&z values when I move the
27:04 - Y value because it's the vertical value
27:07 - you can see it increases I want to move
27:09 - it down it decreases I want to change
27:11 - the Zed value when we move the boleros
27:13 - when I move it to the right you can see
27:16 - it starts to increase when I move it to
27:19 - the left here it starts to decrease
27:21 - tartes to decrease yeah all right so we
27:26 - can move our part around and these
27:29 - values all change but the position is
27:32 - made up of three values x y&z now if we
27:37 - change all of these values to 0 0 0 the
27:40 - part will go right here and this is the
27:44 - exact middle point of the game world and
27:46 - as we move each arrow the different
27:50 - value corresponding to that to that
27:52 - color as you can see on display access
27:55 - changes now we can change all three
27:58 - values with the script and this is where
28:01 - something called vector three comes in
28:02 - now vector 3 is basically x y&z ok it's
28:06 - three values which represent the
28:08 - position so one we want to change the
28:10 - position property base plate dot
28:12 - position we can use vector 3 vector
28:17 - three now one more to move it to a
28:19 - certain position we can say vector three
28:22 - you open bracket close bracket and we
28:24 - will put our three values inside these
28:26 - brackets now remember that when we're
28:29 - putting these values in for example zero
28:31 - zero zero the first value will always be
28:33 - treated as X this way you will always be
28:36 - treated as Y and this one will always be
28:37 - treated as Zed okay now let's move off
28:41 - brick to a position over here okay
28:44 - now let's have a look at this position
28:47 - it's - 200 eight point six in the x-axis
28:51 - to point two in the y-axis
28:54 - and one hundred and eighty nine point
28:55 - zero to five in the z-axis okay now
28:59 - let's take this position these three
29:01 - values and let's paste it into our
29:03 - scripts okay and make sure they're
29:07 - separated by a comma now let's move our
29:10 - part somewhere else and let's run our
29:13 - game and this script will run now look
29:19 - over here where my cursor is now this
29:21 - part should move over there okay to the
29:25 - position which were you specified in the
29:27 - script now what this is going to do is
29:29 - the script is going to update the x y&z
29:31 - value and the part will move accordingly
29:33 - to that position now we just got that
29:36 - vector3 value whoops it also we didn't
29:40 - want to do that because we're actually
29:42 - moving the base plate instead let's
29:44 - change the brics position the brick
29:46 - aimed at workspace dock brick we
29:48 - referenced the wrong part and let's make
29:50 - sure the the base plate is anchored and
29:52 - so is the brick so it doesn't form all
29:57 - right let's try it again
29:58 - so yeah what's the cursor and there we
30:00 - go it's moved all the way over here to
30:02 - that position the script changed the x
30:04 - value the y value and the Zed value and
30:06 - it went over here so you can keep
30:10 - changing these values and the part will
30:13 - move for example let's change the Y
30:15 - value to 50 and it will move higher up
30:18 - in the sky if we made this a negative
30:20 - number it would go down and the same
30:23 - thing would happen when you moved it if
30:25 - you move if you change the X and the Z
30:27 - values okay let's change it to there's
30:30 - fre to 100 and it should have moved over
30:32 - there yeah it does and we can see the
30:34 - direction in which it moves by using the
30:36 - display axis all right so if we change
30:39 - the z-axis to negative 100 it should
30:44 - move right which it did no doesn't we
30:47 - need to make it positive sorry it needs
30:49 - to be positive and it will move right
30:51 - let's change it to 200 there we go it
30:54 - moves right and we've change it to minus
30:56 - 200 it moves to the left alright so that
31:00 - is vector 3 you can play around with it
31:02 - but when we're changing the position in
31:05 - the script we have to use vector 3 it's
31:07 - at our script
31:08 - that we want to move we want to change
31:10 - the three values of a parks position
31:13 - because that's how it's that's how the
31:16 - game moves parts it used it combines the
31:18 - three values to move it to a certain
31:21 - area now what if you wanted to only
31:23 - change a certain value
31:25 - maybe the x-axis and not the others well
31:28 - it's very simple all you need to do is
31:30 - say vector three vector three dot X for
31:36 - example you say X we know that's not
31:40 - right
31:40 - what you want to do if you're unable to
31:41 - change one value for example the X
31:44 - property you would say game data work
31:47 - space top brick position equals game
31:50 - that work space brick dot position you
31:53 - want to get the current position add the
31:56 - vector three dot new open bracket close
31:59 - bracket so you taken the current
32:01 - position and you're adding on a position
32:04 - vector three position value to it
32:06 - for example let's add fifty onto the x
32:09 - value and nothing else onto the Y or the
32:12 - Z value so the y&z value will be cut the
32:15 - same but the the x value will be will be
32:19 - increased by fifty okay let's just
32:22 - restart the game and expect the brick to
32:27 - move in the x-axis all right just wait
32:30 - for it to load all right it's loaded and
32:34 - the brick has moved fifty studs so
32:37 - that's one two three four five six seven
32:39 - all the way to 50 in the x-axis so
32:42 - that's how you that's that's how you
32:45 - only change one that's how you know
32:47 - change one value X or Y or Z if you
32:50 - wanted to change multiple values you
32:52 - could just change them here but that is
32:55 - how you do vector three and it can get
32:57 - much more advanced if you're doing a
32:59 - vector three maths for example but we
33:03 - won't get there because this is a
33:04 - beginners tutorial that's all you need
33:06 - to know so that is vector three all
33:09 - right now we're gonna move on to our
33:11 - next topic all right the next topic is
33:15 - going to be inserting things into your
33:17 - game so we're gonna look at how to
33:19 - insert parts into the works
33:22 - so to do this we're going to first want
33:25 - to define a variable let's just say part
33:29 - equals and then to actually insert
33:32 - something from a script we just say
33:34 - instance with a capital I instance dot
33:38 - new open bracket close bracket and then
33:41 - inside of these brackets we just type in
33:44 - inside in speech marks we just type in
33:46 - the object you want to insert so I want
33:49 - to insert a part so we're going to say
33:50 - part if you want to know all of the
33:52 - different things you can insert then you
33:54 - just want to want to go to your base
33:57 - plate and you want to go to model and
34:00 - you want to click on advanced objects
34:02 - now this will give you a whole list of
34:04 - things can insert but you want to make
34:06 - sure you get the capitalization correct
34:08 - so for example on part you have to have
34:10 - a capital P all right so we're gonna
34:12 - insert a part and now because we've
34:14 - defined as a variable we can change its
34:16 - properties like we learned in the first
34:18 - part of the video so in if we wanted to
34:21 - make it anchored we could say parts got
34:23 - anchored equals true we could say part
34:27 - brick color equals pretty color dot new
34:30 - and then we could specify a color for
34:34 - example new yellow and we could also
34:37 - give a position let's just say part dot
34:39 - position equals vector 3 dot new opening
34:44 - bracket close bracket 0 0 0 but in fact
34:48 - let's split five studs above the ground
34:50 - once you've specified off properties we
34:52 - can say well we want this part to go we
34:54 - have to give it a parent remember
34:56 - earlier we looked at the parent property
34:58 - we have to tell this script where we
35:00 - want the part to go else it won't be
35:02 - crated so we can just say part drop
35:04 - parent this game got workspace you could
35:08 - just say workspace in lower case but
35:10 - it's best to say game dat workspace with
35:13 - a capital W for workspace alright now
35:16 - let's go and delete this part and let's
35:20 - run the game and see if any new parts
35:23 - are added
35:25 - hopefully they should be I hope they are
35:27 - it works fine it should work
35:28 - alright and we just wait for the game to
35:32 - begin
35:34 - you shouldn't take this long for you
35:36 - it's just because I'm recording a video
35:38 - at the same time and let's have a look
35:40 - there's our pot there's our part which
35:41 - we just created and it's five steps
35:44 - above the ground it's anchored and it is
35:46 - new yellow and it is in the work space
35:49 - so that is how you insert a part into
35:51 - your game very simple and you can do it
35:54 - with lots of other objects you just need
35:56 - to change the properties for example you
35:58 - could insert a GUI into I don't know
36:01 - some well you could insert lots of
36:03 - different objects so that's how you do
36:04 - instancing now let's move on to the next
36:07 - part of this tutorial
36:09 - okay now what we're going to do is we're
36:11 - going to take things up a notch and
36:13 - we're going to go more advanced now
36:15 - we're going to move on to wire loops all
36:17 - right so a while loop is something which
36:20 - repeats lines of code forever okay for
36:23 - example if you wanted to print a message
36:25 - to the output forever or if you wanted
36:27 - to insert a part forever
36:29 - we'll use a a while loop and these are
36:31 - used in game round scripts often for
36:35 - example whenever a game is going it will
36:38 - keep looping infinitely until something
36:41 - happens and we're going to look at that
36:42 - today so to do a while loop you just
36:45 - gotta say while true do and drop a line
36:49 - now when you put true it means it's
36:52 - gonna run infinitely okay because
36:54 - there's no condition a condition is
36:56 - something which is checked every time
36:57 - and if that condition is false then the
37:00 - while loop isn't going to run for
37:01 - example a condition if 2 plus 2 is equal
37:04 - to 4 if it is then it will do whatever
37:08 - is in the while loop but if it's not it
37:10 - will just break out off the loop and it
37:12 - won't keep on repeating forever let's
37:15 - put in a print like we looked at earlier
37:17 - and it will print a message to the
37:18 - output and we can say a while loop
37:21 - passed ok and let's run this now but we
37:26 - can't run it yet because it's going to
37:27 - crash our computer we have to have a
37:29 - wait here so we're gonna say wait and
37:31 - then brackets a number of seconds so I'm
37:34 - going to say not 0.5 seconds because if
37:36 - we didn't have a wait it would keep
37:38 - running infinitely and crash roblox to
37:40 - do let's click on run and open up the
37:43 - output you don't know how to do that
37:45 - just click on view and click on output
37:48 - and you should see a while loop past
37:50 - being printed there you go
37:53 - it says a while loop pass and it will
37:55 - keep printing that okay you can see it's
37:58 - got times 14 or 15 it's pretty hard to
38:01 - see but you can see it says I don't know
38:04 - if we can multiply it but it says times
38:06 - 31 and it will just keep increasing
38:08 - every time every not 0.5 second it's
38:11 - going to keep printing this let's take
38:14 - what we just learned and let's take
38:17 - instancing less instance a new part like
38:21 - we just did here ok and let's see what
38:26 - happens when we put wild Trudy and it
38:30 - will wait not 0.5 and we put this into
38:34 - this part instancing in the middle of it
38:37 - what's going to happen is this this
38:40 - script this inserting of parts is going
38:42 - to keep going forever and ever and
38:44 - infinite parts will be inserted into the
38:46 - game let's have a look at it in action
38:48 - so this parts here but we can't see
38:51 - these parts because they're all being
38:52 - put in the same position but if we look
38:55 - here in the workspace we can see that
38:57 - more parts are being created every noir
38:58 - point 5 seconds it's just repeating the
39:00 - same code over and over over again and
39:02 - it won't stop because the condition we
39:05 - put was true and what a condition is
39:07 - true it will just run forever because
39:09 - there's missing to check but we we will
39:11 - keep taking these parts away but
39:13 - nothing's going to happen they're just
39:15 - going to keep spawning and spawning and
39:17 - spawning so that's a while loop it runs
39:19 - code inside of it forever and it won't
39:22 - stop we have the weight to delay it so
39:25 - it doesn't want in it doesn't run
39:27 - infinitely because if it did we wouldn't
39:30 - notice the change and it would probably
39:32 - crash or a block studio now if you
39:34 - wanted a condition say for example while
39:37 - 2 plus 2 equals 4 would put it here but
39:41 - we have to have 2 equals when we're
39:43 - checking something because if we have 1
39:44 - equal sign the script will think that
39:47 - we're updating a value but you can't
39:49 - update a value of 4 we cut you can't
39:51 - update a value when you're doing maths
39:53 - so we have to say equals equals now
39:56 - let's try it again everything should
39:59 - work perfectly normal as as before
40:01 - because the condition is true two plus
40:03 - two is equal to four and so it will keep
40:05 - running infinitely because two plus two
40:08 - is never going to be any other number it
40:10 - will always before but let's change the
40:13 - condition to see while two plus two is
40:16 - equal to five do this but two plus two
40:19 - isn't equal to five and it's never going
40:21 - to be equal to five so no part has been
40:23 - created
40:24 - it's just skipped this entire while loop
40:27 - and it's moved on to the next thing when
40:28 - there's nothing else to move on to so
40:31 - what it's done is it's just finished
40:34 - running the script it's just stopped so
40:37 - let's just have a print down here and we
40:40 - can say while loop stops now this isn't
40:44 - going to print when the condition is
40:46 - true because it will just keep
40:47 - infinitely doing this let's head back to
40:50 - the game and run it and we'll just wait
40:53 - for it to load up and when it has there
40:57 - we go we're going to open up the output
40:59 - and there we go nothing has been printed
41:03 - apart from this error we don't need to
41:05 - worry about that because this to do with
41:07 - HTTP service and a plug-in which I've
41:10 - got but you haven't so don't worry about
41:12 - that
41:12 - nothing has been printed but however if
41:15 - we change the while loop to two plus two
41:18 - equals equals of five hold on
41:21 - that should have worked it should have
41:22 - printed a while loop stopped but it did
41:25 - not let's have a look let's have a look
41:26 - at that again maybe I accidentally
41:28 - deleted it maybe I accidentally deleted
41:30 - it there we go while loop stopped that's
41:32 - what it printed because the wallet did
41:34 - not run but if we change two plus two
41:36 - equals four which will make this
41:38 - condition true the wall loop should run
41:40 - infinitely there we go and it does not
41:43 - print while loop stopped because it
41:45 - won't ever stop because it's it's gonna
41:47 - keep instancing parts into the game
41:49 - however there is a way that you can
41:51 - break out of while loops while they're
41:53 - running for example if something's
41:55 - happening during the while loop which
41:56 - which should stop the game then we can
42:00 - break out of this loop we just need to
42:02 - have an if statement now an if statement
42:04 - checks the condition it checks for
42:07 - example two plus two equals four we can
42:09 - check to see if it's three equals four
42:11 - so let's try it again
42:12 - if two
42:14 - plus two equals equals four then we can
42:19 - say else all right okay now this will
42:23 - make no sense to you maybe maybe it will
42:25 - maybe it won't but I'm going to explain
42:27 - it to you anyway so let's get rid of two
42:30 - plus two equals four here and replace it
42:31 - with true so this should run forever so
42:34 - it's gonna run once and then we get to
42:37 - this if statement here and it says is
42:39 - two plus two equal to four or yes it is
42:41 - so it won't do anything but if it isn't
42:45 - equal to four if it's equal to five or
42:47 - something else it's gonna break out of
42:48 - this while loop and it's just going to
42:50 - skip out of this to the next piece of
42:53 - code which is while loop stops now let's
42:56 - change this to five we know that two
42:58 - plus two isn't equal to five so it's
43:01 - gonna run once okay
43:02 - and then it's gonna hit this if
43:03 - statement it's two plus two equal to
43:05 - five well no it's not so it's going to
43:07 - go to this else bit because if the
43:10 - condition isn't true it we can have an
43:11 - else and it will do something else if if
43:14 - the condition isn't true and so in
43:17 - between this else and end we've got a
43:19 - break and this is telling the while loop
43:21 - to just stop repeating stop running
43:24 - infinitely and just break out of this
43:25 - while loop and move to the next piece of
43:27 - code so let's see this in action it
43:29 - should insert one part and then it
43:33 - should just completely quit it should
43:35 - stop inserting any more parts let's have
43:37 - a look let's see if it works
43:38 - so it's inserted one part and then it
43:40 - stopped and then the output we can see
43:43 - it's as a while loop stops this is
43:45 - because there's no condition up here
43:48 - which because it's true and it's always
43:50 - going to run so it's lettuce one for the
43:52 - first time it's weighted nor point five
43:54 - seconds it's inserted the part it's set
43:57 - its parent and then it's hit this if
43:59 - statement and which says it's two plus
44:01 - two equal to five and it isn't so it
44:04 - skipped this part and it goes directly
44:05 - to the else because the else will run
44:08 - when the condition is false and two plus
44:11 - two isn't equal to 4/5 so it's false so
44:14 - it's being told to break and so when we
44:16 - have break in a while loop it means to
44:19 - stop running the code inside of the
44:21 - while loop and just to move on to the
44:23 - next to the next piece of code outside
44:25 - of it and so it printed while loop stops
44:28 - and so that's how you break out of a
44:30 - while loop which supposedly can run
44:32 - infinitely you don't have to have a
44:34 - break if you don't want the while routes
44:35 - end but usually all while loops will
44:38 - come to an end at some point in the game
44:39 - so that is the end of the while loop

Cleaned transcript:

in this video I'm gonna be teaching you how to script on roblox for beginners I'm going to show you all of the basic things that you need to know about roblox scripting let's get straight into it alright so welcome back to another video my name is ivan blocks and I've been on roblox for almost seven years now and developing for nearly 5 years so I know how to use roblox studio platform and I know how to script and I want you to script as well scripting is really really awesome it lets you make your games more interactive because you don't have to be there making it work you can make your games work for you and then once you know how to script you can make great games and you can make money from those games so if you want to do that then make sure that you follow along and in this video I'm gonna show you the basic concepts of scripting and what you need to know so let's get started then and this is the roblox studio if you don't know how to open it up then if you have a plate of roblox game before the roblox studio will be installed on your computer alright so you just need to do a search on your computer for the roblox studio and then you'll be prompted to sign in and then if you click on a base plate or press ctrl n you'll be brought to this screen alright so to get started with scripting we're going to insert a script into the workspace ok so let's insert a script we're going to right click on the workspace hover over insert objects and click on script now I'm just going to show you how this all works now we've got our ribbon bar at the top of the screen that's where all of our tools are a bit like a Microsoft Word we've got all of our tabs at the top home model terrain test View plugins and the script menu home is useful when you are making parts when you're building because you've got access to the tool box where you can insert models into your game just like that you've got the parts you can insert parts into your game and you can change the color of them you can change their material etc so that's the home tab now you can find more building tools in the model tab you can see we can move our parts we can just click on a part we can move it with a move tool we can scale it to make it bigger and we can also rotate it so I advise you to have a play with that but that is the ribbon menu we can do terrain which we might learn about another tutorial you can test out your game click on the play button to launch an environment with your game to run scripts you can also run scripts without having a player in the game and you can also have a view here now this is what we need to focus on right now our view is where we're going to open up all of our panels okay so this these things are panels okay the output here the properties tab the explore tab these are all panels and to open them you need to go to the View tab so you can see you've got properties and Explorer now Explorer is where we will find all the parts and objects in the game environment all right so we're going to make sure that that's opened up and we've also got the properties tab here so make sure that's opened up as well that's where we can edit parts for example the brick color I can change that from the properties window all right so in our script we're just going to delete these these parts first so just select them all right so we've got our script and I'm just going to show you the basic parts of roblox scripting now so the first thing you need to know are variables okay variables that they hold piece of data now if you use any other programming language before you will know what they are but if you haven't it's used to store data okay so for example we can have a variable called hello okay and we could set that value to 50 all right now let's have another variable and we're going to call it bye all right bye equals 20 now if I wanted to add these two variables together these two pieces of data if I said print okay print what this will do is it will print a message to the output or it will put some text in the output window hey the output window you can find it by clicking view and output this is where errors will be reported from our scripts if we've done something wrong or if you want to send messages to make sure that something has happened and it's run correctly all right so when we say print and let's just put a string inside of here a string is a piece of text or some words so you can say print and then in the brackets in the speech marks for a string we can say hi there all right now let's go and run this all right we're gonna press the Run button if you don't see the one button just click that little arrow underneath the run and select it but you can see it says hi there all right and it's printed hi there to the output so that's how you do printing so if I want to add these two variables together you can say hello plus Phi okay now let's run this and you can see we get 70 all right we didn't get hello bye it didn't print hello bye out it printed 70 now that's because hello and bye have their own data inside of them okay so hello has the number 50 and by has the number 20 attributed to it okay because we've defined the variable here okay so we've said give by a value of 20 and give hello of I or 50 so we're printing hello plus bye so imagine we're adding the values of these variables together so 50 at 20 all right so we've just add two numbers together basic basic maths there all right so that's how you use variable that's how you set up a variable you give it a name you give an equal sign and then over here you say what it would be what you want to store you can store lots of other things in variables we can store boolean x' so my variable equals true okay or we could say my variable equals false a boolean value is something that is true or false it can either be true or false it can't be anything else or you can also store a string a string as I said is a piece of text hi there this is a string you can tell us a string because it's got speech marks around it and it's also purple and so that tells us a string now if we just print my variable it's going to print hi there this is a string okay let's try out then I click on the green Run button hi there this is a string and it printed all right so you can see how we print things to the output now when we're making games we will print variables often to make sure everything's running fine and we want to test our game out so that's variables okay and what we're doing printing we know the printer variable okay or we can print text so if I just wanted to actually print the words my variable not the not the actual value we can put this in speech marks to show that it is a string okay we'll play the game look how to click the play solo button that means that my character will be inserted into the game environment but you can see it's printed my variable because we told it to to actually print my variable not the value of it but if we got rid of the speech marks and we run it again you can see it prints the value of the my variable variable which is higher this is trim so that is printing and how you print things to the output as well as variables now variables will be used when you're making games to store bits of data for example in the murder in a murder type game like a murder mystery or the mad murderer if you haven't played those games before you would have to you'd have to store the name of the murderer who's the murderer who's the sheriff for example if you're in jailbreak you'll have to store a number and that would be how much money you could get from the bank the maximum amount of money you could steal from the Train for example so variables are used all the time in roblox for making games and it is very very basic but very is you've got to know it really because every game will use it so that is a variable let's just click on stop here and that will just kill the game environment and send us back to this free roam mode okay now let's move on to the next part which is properties okay now properties are everywhere in roblox now there will be in parts they'll be in scripts any object in roblox will have properties now you can see we've got the properties tab down here okay now let's go in insert a part into the game okay we've just clips on the part button in the tab and that's inserted apart for us okay now you can mess around with this part whatever you want but let's look at the properties tab alright we've got lots of different options here we can change the brick color we can change the material we can change the reflectance we can change the transparency lots of different things to change these are all called properties the transparency is a property the color is a property of that part okay the name is a property we can change this parts name to brick if we wanted to we can change its orientation how its rotated okay we can let's just make this not transparent we can change the orientation which is the rotation we can change the position okay we can change it with the move tool or we can just change it from this property here lots of different properties which we can change okay now you see that we can change them manually but we can also change them via a script and I'm going to show you how to do this but let's just go over some of the basic properties of a part okay because you might not know what they're for the color and the material are quite obvious they are the the material is look if I change it you can see the different material names reflects how it looks let's just keep a pebble and the reflectance is how it will reflect the Sun off the part and the transparency obvious selfexplanatory now the class name is what type of object it is now we can't change that because we know that it's a part and if we would have asked this script its class name is a script and the part is a part because that's what roblox our set is soo the name of the part we can change that the orientation is the rotation of the park it has three values because it's made up of something called vector three and we'll come to that later on in this tutorial but it's an x y&z value and that makes up the orientation of the pot okay the parent what the parent is is basically what this part is inside of so at the minute it's inside of something called the workspace will also come to that later on and so if we were to put this part inside of the script okay the parent is going to change to script all right there we go change to scripts because it's now inside of the script it's now a child of the script but let's put it back in the workspace and there we go it's changed back to workspace the position that is also quite selfexplanatory its whereabouts is on the map the rock velocity and velocity will not that's quite advanced you might come back to that later on but it's basically about how it travels how quick it travels if you were to move it all right so let's move on to behaviors now okay so we've got anchored now anchored if I show you this this pipe if I move up into the sky and I set the anchor property to false and I run the game the part is going to fall out of the sky all right there we go it fell out the sky but if now I set the anchored property to true all right there we go it stays in the air so that's anchored and the same thing with can collide here when can collide is set to false it means that anything can go through the part but if you have can collide set to true it means that the part will collide with other parts and other objects and it will use physics okay and so that's all you need to know really another one is locked that means you can't touch the part or edit it or select it which is helpful if you want to select a number of parts but you don't want to select some others so that is the locked property now these are quite advanced and we'll get to that later on except for the size which is also vector three and we'll get to that in another part of this tutorial so their properties but you want to know how to change these properties automatically from a script right well it's quite easy let's just get rid of this variable which we just worked on and let's look at properties now clear properties by the way this is a comment and it's green and that tells you it's a comment and we started with two hyphens now when it's a comment when it's green it means that the script is going to ignore it a case a note for you so that you know what you're doing and it's just a little reminder so I like to use comments I let me know you know when I finished when I finished doing something I want to pick up another time I can write comment to tell myself where I got to and what I'm gonna do next so the script totally ignores it it just allows us to have some notes so we want the change of property now very very simple we need to first reference the object we want to change okay now referencing is how I like to call it it's basically getting apart getting a part which is nested somewhat from the script okay because we don't know how to get this part okay which they want to change the baseplates property well we can't just say baseplates okay because we don't the script doesn't know where this base plate is held now I'm going to tell you something about how roblox works here now we've got the Explorer here and basically we have lots of things here okay they're called services but each service has a different role okay so workspace is where parts are stored okay and parts bricks models all of the buildings in your game that's where they'll be stored okay for you to see them if you want to interact with the brick if you want to touch it and you want to see it in the game world it'll always be in the workspace all right let me just prove this to you let's take this brick and let's move it to server storage it's gone okay we can't interact with it anymore let's let's put it in the starter GUI it's still gone starter pack gone start to play it go on sound surface gone chat gone we're lighting gone players gone replicate storage gone you see that they're gone they're not they don't show up unless they're in the workspace alright so that's where parts go if you want to see them for example if we have a map in a game which you don't want to have loaded in yet but we might load it in another time we can just keep it in the server storage okay but the workspace and the server script service and the server storage they are in the server okay now let me tell you how roblox works now when you join a roblox game you are called a client okay and a client is someone who's playing on their computers and connecting to a game server now let's just take a look at a game for example okay so this is jailbreak it's the most popular box game if you didn't know but jailbreak let's take this for example when we are going to play jailbreak and we click on that big green play button we are the client and we are going to connect to that game okay now every game which you join will have something called a server okay now we have servers here and there's gonna be loads of servers okay which you connect to you're going to connect to one of them alright and in this server is where all the scripts are run alright and you're just connecting to that game as a client and so when you connect to that game you start talking to the server the client your computer starts it connects to the server and starts talking sending sending messages to one another and saying I want to join this game load me in and the server will load you in and keep communicating okay so your client will tell the server when you for example press a key okay when you press the W key your computer is telling the server on roblox's end which houses all the game and all the scripts and everything nor the buildings I'm your player the client will tell you the server to move your player because you're pressing the W key which makes you move forward so whenever you're sending keyboard input from your client it's going to the server and so we have some services are in the server right such as the workspace because that's where all the scripts and the parts are held and some are only client ok for example the starter GUI and the starter pack and the starter player they are all on the client ok they're all on your computer on your roblox game you just don't see them but that's how we have the GU eyes on the screen there will in the start they start to GUI your tools which you use to play with for example a sword that will be in your starter pack and start a player is where some scripts might run but we'll get to that another time it's where scripts can run on your client so we have the client talking to the server and it's all good and we have the workspace the server script service and the server storage and the lighting I think which are on the server there servers end and they are there basically because if they're on every client okay people can lag anak and it would be too powerful for one player to run all of this on their computer so we use servers you connect to a server part scripts and other things I want that server we just connect to it so we're able to see them because a game usually has multiple players the server will have multiple clients connected to it okay and so when one client does something for example move their character the server will see that and we'll update the game for everyone else taking everyone in sync so the server manages every player make sure everything is is working together and make sure everything's happening at the same time for everyone so that's a simple way of saying it but the workspace is where parts are stored and server script surface is where scripts can be stored they can also be stored in the workspace makes no difference and the service storage is where you can store parts which you don't need yet in the server it's always good to saw your parts in the server anyway because it means that people well people can can export your game we might get to this later on I'm not sure but basically people can exploit your game when they run a cheap like cheat engine on the computer or something like that which edits the game and then the server will see that change and will edit it for everyone else and because filtering enabled isn't turned on but you might get to that another time I've got a filter enabled you to on my channel if you want to see it go to the link in the top right of your screen so we're going to just deal with the workspace for now we're going to deal with changing the property so to reference an item in the workspace we can we can say game ok because all of these services are in something called game ok our game we just call it game and then we want to specify the service service I can't say it but we'll say workspace ok because that's where the parts are stored and then we can say brick faceplate okay so we've got our base plate you can see how the script recognized that the script saw the base plate as we're typing it we know that we've got the right place we've got we've got the right base plate now so we can change it see by specifying which props you want to change so you'd say dot and then we can choose the property you can see you've got a list here of properties we can change so let's go and change the color property okay now if you want to change this color property we have to specify a color so to do that we have to say brick color dot new open bracket close bracket and then inside of these brackets in speech marks we can actually say a color now the color has to be correctly spell and it has to have capitals correct and everything to find a list of colors you can just go to the base plate and click on brick color and then you get this palette so just hover over color I new get its name so new yellow we'll call this one with the capital n and the capital wife and new and yellow we have just changed the base plates color using a script now let's go and test this game out with me click on run and hopefully the base plate changes to yellow I'm going to wait for it and it will take a little while to load there we go oh we got an error and the error is bad argument number two to color number three to color color through expected but got a brick color now this is because we selected the wrong property we selected the color property not the brick color now in roblox where you want to change the color you can either choose it from an odd RGB value red green blue and you can actually select one like this or you can select a predefined color called brick color now I like to always use brick color so I'm going to say brick color like that okay now if we try it again it should work there we go it changes to bright yellow but what if you wanted to use a custom color well you can do that you can just use the color property like we did before but instead of using brick color we have to say color color three okay because colors are made up of three values RGB red green blue and then we say dot from RGB because we're getting it from red green blue and we need our three values of red green and blue so let's do two five five zero zero because we want it all to be read and we don't want it to be any other color so let's run it again and it should go totally red there we go so we've just changed the base plates colors property by using color three and brick color so there's two ways to do that let's change another property let's change the transparency prophecy so I'm just going to get rid of the dot color and I'm going to change it to dot transparency game dot workspace base pay transparency equals one all right now what do you think is gonna happen when I set it to one because of the minute it's set to zero and it we can see we can see it all right now what what do you think will happen if we set it to the other end of the spectrum and one it's going to go completely transparent now it's still there we just can't see it and to prove it I'll go into the workspace and select it you can see that it's selected because we've got these little blue outlines it's just that we can't see it because it's totally transparent now let's go and take the slider and start to drag it all the way back you can see that we can start to see it again before it becomes fully opaque that's the transparency property and that's a number of property you see we we controlled it by a number instead of a string or brick color now let's go and try and change the anchored property okay they split the anchored you can see it's got a checkbox so we know that it must be a a boolean value so either true or false so remember anchored means whether it can fall out of the sky or not now we want it to be anchored stuck into the sky it's stuck in the air so we can just say true so yes we want to anchored so true now let's run this and it shouldn't move it should just stay in the air there we go now let's go back to our script and change it to false and run again and the base plate is going to fall out of the sky now where Smith falls out of the sky once it heats once it hits a certain position it will just delete itself and you can see it's it's been deleted from the workspace now you can change this in the workspace there's actually a property in the workspace I think it's here yeah it's called fallen parts destroy height and if we change that to maybe 3000 that means it's going to have to go down 3,000 studs before it deletes now just four just so you know once stood is it's this site is this small okay so the distance between one store to another is that much so if you thinking 3,000 studs it's gonna be quite big all right let's try it again let's see if it good if it stays in the air any longer okay so it should stay in the air six times as longer because we said it's in 3,000 and watch it's been deleted from the workspace when it fell all right so that is how you do the anchored property I'm gonna let you experiment with some more properties of your own so let me know if you discovered it any new ones in the comment section below alright let's move on to the next part of the tutorial and the next part is going to be positions make sure that you've given me a thumbs up so far and let me know if you're enjoying it in the comments as well okay so in roblox when we want to change the position of a brick we can just move it around okay we can also use the Move tool if you want to move it on a straight line or if you want to move it or pull down now when we're moving this the position property is always changing let's have a look at that position property okay so we can see at the minute it's set to minus seventy thirty five point four five and minus one hundred and ten point four to five now this position property is made up of three values okay x y&z all right each value representing a specific direction now which direction does it go in well that's a good question now we can open up the we click on view and we can open up the display access to see which direction each one goes in now if you look down here the display axis is saying the green line is going in the Y direction the red line is going in the X direction and the blue line is going in the Z direction okay so if we move it with the red arrows with the Move tool to get the move tool you can just click on home and then move and select the pot when we move it you can see that the first value the x value here is changing now it's decreasing actually it's increasing because it's a negative number when we move it to the left and it's decreasing as we move it to the right that is the x value now if we click on the arrow here that will open up the x y&z values when I move the Y value because it's the vertical value you can see it increases I want to move it down it decreases I want to change the Zed value when we move the boleros when I move it to the right you can see it starts to increase when I move it to the left here it starts to decrease tartes to decrease yeah all right so we can move our part around and these values all change but the position is made up of three values x y&z now if we change all of these values to 0 0 0 the part will go right here and this is the exact middle point of the game world and as we move each arrow the different value corresponding to that to that color as you can see on display access changes now we can change all three values with the script and this is where something called vector three comes in now vector 3 is basically x y&z ok it's three values which represent the position so one we want to change the position property base plate dot position we can use vector 3 vector three now one more to move it to a certain position we can say vector three you open bracket close bracket and we will put our three values inside these brackets now remember that when we're putting these values in for example zero zero zero the first value will always be treated as X this way you will always be treated as Y and this one will always be treated as Zed okay now let's move off brick to a position over here okay now let's have a look at this position it's 200 eight point six in the xaxis to point two in the yaxis and one hundred and eighty nine point zero to five in the zaxis okay now let's take this position these three values and let's paste it into our scripts okay and make sure they're separated by a comma now let's move our part somewhere else and let's run our game and this script will run now look over here where my cursor is now this part should move over there okay to the position which were you specified in the script now what this is going to do is the script is going to update the x y&z value and the part will move accordingly to that position now we just got that vector3 value whoops it also we didn't want to do that because we're actually moving the base plate instead let's change the brics position the brick aimed at workspace dock brick we referenced the wrong part and let's make sure the the base plate is anchored and so is the brick so it doesn't form all right let's try it again so yeah what's the cursor and there we go it's moved all the way over here to that position the script changed the x value the y value and the Zed value and it went over here so you can keep changing these values and the part will move for example let's change the Y value to 50 and it will move higher up in the sky if we made this a negative number it would go down and the same thing would happen when you moved it if you move if you change the X and the Z values okay let's change it to there's fre to 100 and it should have moved over there yeah it does and we can see the direction in which it moves by using the display axis all right so if we change the zaxis to negative 100 it should move right which it did no doesn't we need to make it positive sorry it needs to be positive and it will move right let's change it to 200 there we go it moves right and we've change it to minus 200 it moves to the left alright so that is vector 3 you can play around with it but when we're changing the position in the script we have to use vector 3 it's at our script that we want to move we want to change the three values of a parks position because that's how it's that's how the game moves parts it used it combines the three values to move it to a certain area now what if you wanted to only change a certain value maybe the xaxis and not the others well it's very simple all you need to do is say vector three vector three dot X for example you say X we know that's not right what you want to do if you're unable to change one value for example the X property you would say game data work space top brick position equals game that work space brick dot position you want to get the current position add the vector three dot new open bracket close bracket so you taken the current position and you're adding on a position vector three position value to it for example let's add fifty onto the x value and nothing else onto the Y or the Z value so the y&z value will be cut the same but the the x value will be will be increased by fifty okay let's just restart the game and expect the brick to move in the xaxis all right just wait for it to load all right it's loaded and the brick has moved fifty studs so that's one two three four five six seven all the way to 50 in the xaxis so that's how you that's that's how you only change one that's how you know change one value X or Y or Z if you wanted to change multiple values you could just change them here but that is how you do vector three and it can get much more advanced if you're doing a vector three maths for example but we won't get there because this is a beginners tutorial that's all you need to know so that is vector three all right now we're gonna move on to our next topic all right the next topic is going to be inserting things into your game so we're gonna look at how to insert parts into the works so to do this we're going to first want to define a variable let's just say part equals and then to actually insert something from a script we just say instance with a capital I instance dot new open bracket close bracket and then inside of these brackets we just type in inside in speech marks we just type in the object you want to insert so I want to insert a part so we're going to say part if you want to know all of the different things you can insert then you just want to want to go to your base plate and you want to go to model and you want to click on advanced objects now this will give you a whole list of things can insert but you want to make sure you get the capitalization correct so for example on part you have to have a capital P all right so we're gonna insert a part and now because we've defined as a variable we can change its properties like we learned in the first part of the video so in if we wanted to make it anchored we could say parts got anchored equals true we could say part brick color equals pretty color dot new and then we could specify a color for example new yellow and we could also give a position let's just say part dot position equals vector 3 dot new opening bracket close bracket 0 0 0 but in fact let's split five studs above the ground once you've specified off properties we can say well we want this part to go we have to give it a parent remember earlier we looked at the parent property we have to tell this script where we want the part to go else it won't be crated so we can just say part drop parent this game got workspace you could just say workspace in lower case but it's best to say game dat workspace with a capital W for workspace alright now let's go and delete this part and let's run the game and see if any new parts are added hopefully they should be I hope they are it works fine it should work alright and we just wait for the game to begin you shouldn't take this long for you it's just because I'm recording a video at the same time and let's have a look there's our pot there's our part which we just created and it's five steps above the ground it's anchored and it is new yellow and it is in the work space so that is how you insert a part into your game very simple and you can do it with lots of other objects you just need to change the properties for example you could insert a GUI into I don't know some well you could insert lots of different objects so that's how you do instancing now let's move on to the next part of this tutorial okay now what we're going to do is we're going to take things up a notch and we're going to go more advanced now we're going to move on to wire loops all right so a while loop is something which repeats lines of code forever okay for example if you wanted to print a message to the output forever or if you wanted to insert a part forever we'll use a a while loop and these are used in game round scripts often for example whenever a game is going it will keep looping infinitely until something happens and we're going to look at that today so to do a while loop you just gotta say while true do and drop a line now when you put true it means it's gonna run infinitely okay because there's no condition a condition is something which is checked every time and if that condition is false then the while loop isn't going to run for example a condition if 2 plus 2 is equal to 4 if it is then it will do whatever is in the while loop but if it's not it will just break out off the loop and it won't keep on repeating forever let's put in a print like we looked at earlier and it will print a message to the output and we can say a while loop passed ok and let's run this now but we can't run it yet because it's going to crash our computer we have to have a wait here so we're gonna say wait and then brackets a number of seconds so I'm going to say not 0.5 seconds because if we didn't have a wait it would keep running infinitely and crash roblox to do let's click on run and open up the output you don't know how to do that just click on view and click on output and you should see a while loop past being printed there you go it says a while loop pass and it will keep printing that okay you can see it's got times 14 or 15 it's pretty hard to see but you can see it says I don't know if we can multiply it but it says times 31 and it will just keep increasing every time every not 0.5 second it's going to keep printing this let's take what we just learned and let's take instancing less instance a new part like we just did here ok and let's see what happens when we put wild Trudy and it will wait not 0.5 and we put this into this part instancing in the middle of it what's going to happen is this this script this inserting of parts is going to keep going forever and ever and infinite parts will be inserted into the game let's have a look at it in action so this parts here but we can't see these parts because they're all being put in the same position but if we look here in the workspace we can see that more parts are being created every noir point 5 seconds it's just repeating the same code over and over over again and it won't stop because the condition we put was true and what a condition is true it will just run forever because there's missing to check but we we will keep taking these parts away but nothing's going to happen they're just going to keep spawning and spawning and spawning so that's a while loop it runs code inside of it forever and it won't stop we have the weight to delay it so it doesn't want in it doesn't run infinitely because if it did we wouldn't notice the change and it would probably crash or a block studio now if you wanted a condition say for example while 2 plus 2 equals 4 would put it here but we have to have 2 equals when we're checking something because if we have 1 equal sign the script will think that we're updating a value but you can't update a value of 4 we cut you can't update a value when you're doing maths so we have to say equals equals now let's try it again everything should work perfectly normal as as before because the condition is true two plus two is equal to four and so it will keep running infinitely because two plus two is never going to be any other number it will always before but let's change the condition to see while two plus two is equal to five do this but two plus two isn't equal to five and it's never going to be equal to five so no part has been created it's just skipped this entire while loop and it's moved on to the next thing when there's nothing else to move on to so what it's done is it's just finished running the script it's just stopped so let's just have a print down here and we can say while loop stops now this isn't going to print when the condition is true because it will just keep infinitely doing this let's head back to the game and run it and we'll just wait for it to load up and when it has there we go we're going to open up the output and there we go nothing has been printed apart from this error we don't need to worry about that because this to do with HTTP service and a plugin which I've got but you haven't so don't worry about that nothing has been printed but however if we change the while loop to two plus two equals equals of five hold on that should have worked it should have printed a while loop stopped but it did not let's have a look let's have a look at that again maybe I accidentally deleted it maybe I accidentally deleted it there we go while loop stopped that's what it printed because the wallet did not run but if we change two plus two equals four which will make this condition true the wall loop should run infinitely there we go and it does not print while loop stopped because it won't ever stop because it's it's gonna keep instancing parts into the game however there is a way that you can break out of while loops while they're running for example if something's happening during the while loop which which should stop the game then we can break out of this loop we just need to have an if statement now an if statement checks the condition it checks for example two plus two equals four we can check to see if it's three equals four so let's try it again if two plus two equals equals four then we can say else all right okay now this will make no sense to you maybe maybe it will maybe it won't but I'm going to explain it to you anyway so let's get rid of two plus two equals four here and replace it with true so this should run forever so it's gonna run once and then we get to this if statement here and it says is two plus two equal to four or yes it is so it won't do anything but if it isn't equal to four if it's equal to five or something else it's gonna break out of this while loop and it's just going to skip out of this to the next piece of code which is while loop stops now let's change this to five we know that two plus two isn't equal to five so it's gonna run once okay and then it's gonna hit this if statement it's two plus two equal to five well no it's not so it's going to go to this else bit because if the condition isn't true it we can have an else and it will do something else if if the condition isn't true and so in between this else and end we've got a break and this is telling the while loop to just stop repeating stop running infinitely and just break out of this while loop and move to the next piece of code so let's see this in action it should insert one part and then it should just completely quit it should stop inserting any more parts let's have a look let's see if it works so it's inserted one part and then it stopped and then the output we can see it's as a while loop stops this is because there's no condition up here which because it's true and it's always going to run so it's lettuce one for the first time it's weighted nor point five seconds it's inserted the part it's set its parent and then it's hit this if statement and which says it's two plus two equal to five and it isn't so it skipped this part and it goes directly to the else because the else will run when the condition is false and two plus two isn't equal to 4/5 so it's false so it's being told to break and so when we have break in a while loop it means to stop running the code inside of the while loop and just to move on to the next to the next piece of code outside of it and so it printed while loop stops and so that's how you break out of a while loop which supposedly can run infinitely you don't have to have a break if you don't want the while routes end but usually all while loops will come to an end at some point in the game so that is the end of the while loop section I have videos on every single topic which we just covered some of which are over 30 minutes long so you can understand something here then you can always refer
