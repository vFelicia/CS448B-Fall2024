00:01 - okay I'm going to demonstrate what a
00:03 - vector 3 is in Roblox so a vector 3 is
00:06 - simply a way of representing some data
00:10 - now in this case we want to have three
00:13 - numbers to represent something a vector
00:16 - 3 can be used for many different
00:18 - properties but mainly we use it to
00:21 - represent position of an object in the
00:24 - world now in roadblocks we represent
00:27 - position by three numbers telling us how
00:30 - far away on each axis an item is from
00:33 - the spawn well the center of the world
00:36 - which is where the spawn point is and in
00:39 - this case you can see that our part over
00:41 - here is 14 -4 STS on the x axis away
00:45 - from the origin 0.5 STS away on the Y
00:49 - AIS and 26 STS away on the Zed axis so
00:53 - we have these three numbers which all
00:54 - come together to represent a position
00:56 - because it's telling us how far away on
00:58 - each axis the part is from the spawn
01:01 - point from the origin yeah I'll clarify
01:04 - it is the spawn it is the origin and not
01:06 - the spawn point we're talking about
01:08 - because the spawn point could obviously
01:09 - move but the origin which is 0000 0
01:12 - somewhere around here would remain the
01:15 - same so that is just one way that a
01:18 - vector 3 is commonly used but a vector 3
01:21 - has nothing to do with position because
01:23 - like I say a vector 3 could be used to
01:27 - represent some other type of of data but
01:29 - normally we use it to represent a
01:31 - position because it's a great way of
01:33 - storing three numbers which are uh
01:36 - relative to each other right they all
01:37 - have some similar sort of meaning it
01:39 - wouldn't make sense to just store the X
01:42 - store the Y and Store The Zed as three
01:44 - separate variables when we could just
01:46 - store it in one vector and we could
01:48 - refer to them by saying vector dox
01:50 - vector doy vector. Z so a vector 3 is
01:54 - essentially a container for three
01:56 - numbers but it represents a Direction
02:00 - normally or a
02:01 - position now the other cool thing about
02:03 - Vector 3es is you can add them together
02:05 - so you could have um uh we'll create a
02:09 - variable for Vector number two and I
02:11 - know this is going to get confusing
02:12 - because I've just referred to it as
02:14 - Vector number two and we now have Vector
02:16 - 3 but let's just assume we have two
02:18 - vectors and I could have a total vector
02:21 - by saying Vector plus Vector number two
02:24 - and that would be all of these numbers
02:27 - adding to each other so the X will be
02:29 - added to the x X the Y will be added to
02:31 - the Y and you will get one new Vector so
02:34 - in this case if we were to print out
02:36 - total Vector we should get 0 1 0 because
02:40 - we're adding nothing because this is
02:43 - just three Z values to 0 1 Z so it
02:46 - should stay the same but if this was to
02:48 - be 5 55 we should get 5 65 because we're
02:52 - adding one to the Y value so the X and
02:56 - Zed values remain unchanged but because
02:59 - we we've changed the Y we've added one
03:01 - to it we should get 5 65 so let's click
03:04 - on run and there we go it's added our
03:07 - two vectors together Vector 3es
03:11 - so that is essentially how Vector 3
03:14 - works and of course you can set a part
03:18 - position by saying part. position equals
03:23 - and then you supply a vector 3 value and
03:26 - this total Vector is a vector three
03:28 - because we've just added two other
03:29 - Vector 3es together and if we click on
03:32 - run you'll see that the part has moved
03:36 - to over here okay so that is how Vector
03:39 - 3 Works in roadblocks very simple way of
03:43 - uh representing points in the world
03:46 - vectors which is a direction of
03:49 - travel uh because you can just provide
03:51 - three numbers and it's usually used for
03:54 - positions positioning objects with a
03:56 - script so thank you for watching leave a
03:59 - like if you enjoyed it subscribe of
