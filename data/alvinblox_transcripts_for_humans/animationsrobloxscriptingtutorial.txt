00:00 - how to create and play animations in
00:03 - Roblox studio so firstly you need to
00:05 - insert a rig so go to the Avatar tab
00:08 - click on rig Builder and then insert a
00:10 - rig I like to use the arthro avatars but
00:13 - you can pick any from this list oh no
00:15 - actually not Alro I mean uh the uh the
00:18 - blocky blocky of course okay few right
00:22 - okay into the animation editor then
00:24 - which you find in the Avatar tab you
00:26 - then need to select your rig and it's
00:28 - going to ask you to give it a name name
00:30 - but I'm not really bothered about that
00:31 - right now and then you can start
00:33 - animating so we have the timeline down
00:36 - here and our animation is currently 1
00:38 - second long starts at 0 0 and it ends at
00:41 - one down here right so this is 1 second
00:44 - along the time frame you can drag the
00:47 - timeline key frame along at the top here
00:50 - and if you want to you can extend the
00:52 - animation by inserting a new value into
00:55 - this text box so now it's 2 seconds long
00:59 - if you want your animation to Loop you
01:01 - want to select this it basically means
01:03 - when it reaches the end it will play
01:05 - again until you stop the animation and
01:08 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
01:09 - design a very simple animation now I'm
01:11 - no animator but I can show you how to
01:13 - use it what you want to do is you want
01:15 - to
01:17 - firstly uh if you want your character to
01:20 - be like this with its default position
01:23 - at the start of the animation then you
01:25 - can simply click on the plus and select
01:28 - add all body it's right at at the bottom
01:30 - here you won't be able to see it because
01:32 - it just goes out of the bounds of the
01:34 - screen but I can see it on my screen
01:36 - it's called add or body so you select
01:38 - that and suddenly you have all these
01:40 - body parts on the left now you can
01:42 - select one of these body parts from this
01:44 - list alternatively you can just click on
01:46 - one and then you can start so what I
01:50 - like to do is I like to keep the Z 0 the
01:53 - start of the animation I like to keep
01:55 - that clean I don't like to edit any of
01:57 - these body parts because if you do that
02:00 - you won't notice a difference when you
02:01 - change them later on so this is like the
02:03 - default pose I mean perhaps you want
02:05 - your animation to start in a specific
02:08 - manner you want you know if if you're
02:09 - doing a rope animation you do want the
02:11 - player to start by actually holding the
02:13 - Rope so you might want to actually you
02:15 - know set some defaults and and the z0
02:18 - would be how your animation starts what
02:20 - the default is but I mean let's just
02:23 - imagine I'm making a zombie animation
02:24 - right I'm going to drag the timeline to
02:27 - one second and I'm going to just move
02:29 - move the arms up like this when you
02:32 - select the arms you want to select the
02:34 - the highest part in the arm so in this
02:36 - case it's the uh what is it what have I
02:39 - got selected here I think it's the upper
02:41 - arm the right upper
02:43 - arm uh yeah left upper arm okay can't
02:46 - get those mixed up okay so left upper
02:48 - arm if you move that all of the other
02:50 - arm parts are going to move with it like
02:52 - this okay but if you select the middle
02:54 - arm okay only the the the hand is going
02:57 - to move with it so what we've done is at
02:59 - one 1 second we've moved both arms and
03:02 - so what's going to happen between zero
03:04 - and 1 second it's going to smoothly
03:06 - animate to show this change okay there
03:08 - you go so click on
03:11 - play and it just makes the arms move up
03:14 - and at the end of the animation it
03:16 - repeats okay now I know it's set to two
03:19 - seconds but because we haven't got
03:20 - anything going on after 1 second the
03:22 - animation editor is detecting this and
03:24 - it just Loops back so how do we make it
03:27 - a little bit smoother how do we bring
03:29 - the arm back down a little bit more
03:31 - naturally well we can just go to 2
03:33 - seconds now and we can bring them back
03:36 - down to normal we can just moove them
03:38 - down like this but I want to return the
03:41 - player to how they were at the beginning
03:43 - so I'm going to take this key frame from
03:45 - Z 0 I'm going to move the cursor to 2
03:48 - seconds I'm going to paste it in so now
03:51 - what we've got is from 0 to one they
03:53 - move up and from 1 to two they move back
03:56 - down because we're restoring the player
03:58 - as they were at the beginning so if we
03:59 - click play now it's going to be a lot
04:01 - smoother so that's our animation for you
04:04 - and I mean you can do as much other
04:06 - stuff as you like you can move the
04:08 - entire player's torso by selecting the
04:12 - uh lower torso and just move it like
04:14 - this or sorry the upper torso like this
04:18 - and perhaps you want to bring them up
04:19 - again and you can keep adding as many of
04:21 - these as you like I mean this animation
04:23 - is going to be crazy looking in a moment
04:25 - because we've got so many different
04:27 - things moving but I'm just going to do
04:28 - it to show you what you can do with the
04:31 - animation editor okay right so let's
04:33 - click on play and see what happens here
04:36 - yeah this is quite a crazy animation but
04:38 - you can see I've done enough to to show
04:41 - you how it works so when you're happy
04:43 - with your animation what you want to do
04:45 - is click on the three dots and then you
04:47 - want to set the animation priority we're
04:49 - going to set it to
04:51 - action now this means it's going to
04:54 - overrule any other animations which are
04:56 - playing that are casual core animations
04:59 - things like walking um dances Etc
05:03 - because this is a specific action we
05:05 - want it to over overrule uh the movement
05:08 - Idol and core animations so Idol is when
05:11 - you're sat doing nothing and your
05:13 - character sort of just looks around in
05:14 - different directions uh core I think I'm
05:17 - not actually sure what core is okay but
05:19 - it's it's handled by Roblox um and
05:22 - movement of course when you're moving so
05:24 - do you want the action if if it's an
05:26 - action animation it will override any
05:29 - movement animations so if you're holding
05:31 - down W ASD Keys you're moving if it's an
05:34 - action it's going to over Ru and play
05:36 - over those animations but if you don't
05:38 - animate a specific part for example
05:41 - we've not animated the legs then I think
05:43 - the legs will still animate as per the
05:47 - movement idle or core animations so you
05:51 - might just want to have a key frame set
05:54 - up at zero keeping them in their default
05:56 - position uh but anyway let me show you
05:58 - how to publish the animation so you
06:00 - click on publish to
06:02 - Roblox and then this will bring you
06:04 - through the flow that publishes your
06:06 - animation okay it's going to ask you to
06:08 - give it a title description you don't
06:10 - really need to give it a description
06:12 - asset category you want to set to
06:14 - animation and Creator now this is sort
06:17 - of important if it's a game that you own
06:19 - yourself just set it to me um
06:22 - alternatively if it's under a group and
06:24 - you have other developers I'd recommend
06:26 - setting the Creator to be the group just
06:28 - because some times other players can't
06:30 - see the animation animations are quite
06:33 - strange in that even if you've created
06:35 - the animation only you can see the
06:39 - animation when it's playing at least
06:40 - until it's moderated that is um there's
06:43 - definitely been a few issues in the last
06:45 - couple of years where you're taking the
06:47 - animation ID and it's not working
06:49 - because it's made by another player so
06:51 - I'd recommend always publishing it under
06:52 - a group that you own or a group which
06:55 - you work with and you have development
06:56 - permissions or just publish it as
06:58 - yourself then click on
07:00 - Save and you'll find this animation ID
07:04 - now if you don't see this go onto the
07:06 - Roblox create page and find it under
07:09 - animations you'll find the ID but you
07:11 - want to copy this animation ID this is
07:13 - really important because it's going to
07:15 - help us in playing the animation so let
07:18 - me show you how to now play an animation
07:21 - so we're going to I'm going to show you
07:23 - how to do it for a normal player and
07:25 - also an NPC so we are going to insert a
07:30 - local
07:32 - script and we're going to
07:34 - say um local well actually what we'll do
07:38 - is we'll do it in a server script okay
07:40 - we'll do it in a server script and I'll
07:41 - explain the difference in a moment if we
07:44 - just close down the animation editor and
07:46 - we insert a script let's just do it on
07:49 - our NPC to begin
07:51 - with so all you need to do is
07:54 - say well firstly we need to set up
07:57 - something called an animator and so
07:59 - we're going to say local animator equals
08:01 - instance. new animator animator do
08:05 - parent equals rig Doh humanoid has to go
08:09 - inside a humanoid and then we'll say
08:11 - animator colon load animation and what
08:14 - you need to do is you need to create an
08:16 - animation object like I've done here
08:18 - okay so what we'll do is we'll just
08:21 - delete this and I'll show you again so
08:23 - we click on the plus you click on
08:25 - animation and then you paste that
08:26 - animation ID in there okay and it should
08:29 - turn into to an RBX asset ID then we can
08:33 - reference the animation object by saying
08:35 - script. animation or wherever the
08:37 - animation is and then you'll say C on
08:39 - play like this now I'm just going to do
08:42 - a 2 second delay here so you can
08:44 - actually see things unfold at the top of
08:47 - the
08:48 - script and then if we click on
08:51 - run wait two seconds the animation is
08:54 - playing and it's also looping so that's
08:56 - how you do it for an NPC let me now show
09:00 - you how to do it for a player and
09:03 - obviously we need to firstly get the
09:05 - player so we can do this in a local
09:08 - script for our own player okay if we do
09:10 - it for our own player it should
09:12 - replicate to other
09:16 - players so if we just do a task. we in
09:19 - this
09:20 - script and that should be all good I
09:23 - think let's just give it a go let's
09:26 - insert the animation into our local
09:27 - script as well click on play
09:31 - here and we'll wait a few seconds and
09:35 - there we go I'm also playing the
09:37 - animation and let's see it doesn't seem
09:40 - to have replicated or maybe it doesn't
09:42 - play in studio I'm not sure however if
09:44 - you did want to be totally sure you
09:46 - could just play this on the server so
09:50 - that is how you play animations in
09:54 - Roblox if you found this video useful
09:56 - please let me know if you have any more
09:58 - videos you'd like me to cover also let
09:59 - me know don't forget to subscribe and
10:01 - I'll see you in the next one

how to create and play animations in Roblox studio so firstly you need to insert a rig so go to the Avatar tab click on rig Builder and then insert a rig I like to use the arthro avatars but you can pick any from this list oh no actually not Alro I mean uh the uh the blocky blocky of course okay few right okay into the animation editor then which you find in the Avatar tab you then need to select your rig and it's going to ask you to give it a name name but I'm not really bothered about that right now and then you can start animating so we have the timeline down here and our animation is currently 1 second long starts at 0 0 and it ends at one down here right so this is 1 second along the time frame you can drag the timeline key frame along at the top here and if you want to you can extend the animation by inserting a new value into this text box so now it's 2 seconds long if you want your animation to Loop you want to select this it basically means when it reaches the end it will play again until you stop the animation and what I'm going to do is I'm going to design a very simple animation now I'm no animator but I can show you how to use it what you want to do is you want to firstly uh if you want your character to be like this with its default position at the start of the animation then you can simply click on the plus and select add all body it's right at at the bottom here you won't be able to see it because it just goes out of the bounds of the screen but I can see it on my screen it's called add or body so you select that and suddenly you have all these body parts on the left now you can select one of these body parts from this list alternatively you can just click on one and then you can start so what I like to do is I like to keep the Z 0 the start of the animation I like to keep that clean I don't like to edit any of these body parts because if you do that you won't notice a difference when you change them later on so this is like the default pose I mean perhaps you want your animation to start in a specific manner you want you know if if you're doing a rope animation you do want the player to start by actually holding the Rope so you might want to actually you know set some defaults and and the z0 would be how your animation starts what the default is but I mean let's just imagine I'm making a zombie animation right I'm going to drag the timeline to one second and I'm going to just move move the arms up like this when you select the arms you want to select the the highest part in the arm so in this case it's the uh what is it what have I got selected here I think it's the upper arm the right upper arm uh yeah left upper arm okay can't get those mixed up okay so left upper arm if you move that all of the other arm parts are going to move with it like this okay but if you select the middle arm okay only the the the hand is going to move with it so what we've done is at one 1 second we've moved both arms and so what's going to happen between zero and 1 second it's going to smoothly animate to show this change okay there you go so click on play and it just makes the arms move up and at the end of the animation it repeats okay now I know it's set to two seconds but because we haven't got anything going on after 1 second the animation editor is detecting this and it just Loops back so how do we make it a little

from 0 to one they move up and from 1 to two they move back down because we're restoring the player as they were at the beginning so if we click play now it's going to be a lot smoother so that's our animation for you and I mean you can do as much other stuff as you like you can move the entire player's torso by selecting the uh lower torso and just move it like this or sorry the upper torso like this and perhaps you want to bring them up again and you can keep adding as many of these as you like I mean this animation is going to be crazy looking in a moment because we've got so many different things moving but I'm just going to do it to show you what you can do with the animation editor okay right so let's click on play and see what happens here yeah this is quite a crazy animation but you can see I've done enough to to show you how it works so when you're happy with your animation what you want to do is click on the three dots and then you want to set the animation priority we're going to set it to action now this means it's going to overrule any other animations which are playing that are casual core animations things like walking um dances Etc because this is a specific action we want it to over overrule uh the movement Idol and core animations so Idol is when you're sat doing nothing and your character sort of just looks around in different directions uh core I think I'm not actually sure what core is okay but it's it's handled by Roblox um and movement of course when you're moving so do you want the action if if it's an action animation it will override any movement animations so if you're holding down W ASD Keys you're moving if it's an action it's going to over Ru and play over those animations but if you don't animate a specific part for example we've not animated the legs then I think the legs will still animate as per the movement idle or core animations so you might just want to have a key frame set up at zero keeping them in their default position uh but anyway let me show you how to publish the animation so you click on publish to Roblox and then this will bring you through the flow that publishes your animation okay it's going to ask you to give it a title description you don't really need to give it a description asset category you want to set to animation and Creator now this is sort of important if it's a game that you own yourself just set it to me um alternatively if it's under a group and you have other developers I'd recommend setting the Creator to be the group just because some times other players can't see the animation

in the last couple of years where you're taking the animation ID and it's not working because it's made by another player so I'd recommend always publishing it under a group that you own or a group which you work with and you have development permissions or just publish it as yourself then click on Save and you'll find this animation ID now if you don't see this go onto the Roblox create page and find it under animations you'll find the ID but you want to copy this animation ID this is really important because it's going to help us in playing the animation so let me show you how to now play an animation so we're going to I'm going to show you how to do it for a normal player and also an NPC so we are going to insert a local script and we're going to say um local well actually what we'll do is we'll do it in a server script okay we'll do it in a server script and I'll explain the difference in a moment if we just close down the animation editor and we insert a script let's just

show you how to do it for a player and obviously we need to firstly get the player so we can do this in a local script for our own player okay if we do it for our own player it should replicate to other players so if we just do a task. we in this script and that should be all good I think let's just give it a go let's insert the animation into our local script as well click on play here and we'll wait a few seconds and there we go I'm also playing the animation and let's see it doesn't seem to have replicated or maybe it doesn't play in studio I'm not sure however if you did want to be totally sure you could just play this on the server so that is how you play animations in Roblox if you found this video useful please let me know if you have any more videos you'd like me to cover also let me know don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you in the next one
