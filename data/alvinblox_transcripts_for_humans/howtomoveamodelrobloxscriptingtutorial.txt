00:01 - I'm going to show you how to move a
00:03 - model in Roblox studio in 2024 or Beyond
00:07 - um because it used to be the case that
00:09 - if you wanted to move a model you would
00:12 - have to give it a primary part and then
00:14 - you'd have to say set primary part C
00:17 - frame so let's say we have this model
00:19 - here just going to Anchor it to make
00:20 - sure it doesn't fall over if I wanted to
00:23 - move this using a script I just need to
00:27 - say pivot 2 like this
00:31 - and what this will do is every model has
00:33 - a pivot point you can see this small
00:36 - blue circle in the middle of the arrows
00:37 - here that's the pivot location of the
00:39 - model and when you say pivot 2 it
00:42 - essentially moves that point to wherever
00:44 - you want and then the rest of the model
00:46 - will move with it so you can put your CF
00:48 - frame into these parentheses 30 30 30
00:53 - and run this code and it is moved it's
00:57 - moved it up here uh so that's it
00:59 - basically and if you want to get a
01:01 - cframe of a model you would
01:04 - say local cframe well we'll just say CF
01:08 - equals game. workspace model colon get
01:11 - pivot and that will return the cframe if
01:13 - you wanted to then get the position you
01:15 - would say cf. position and you can print
01:18 - it
01:19 - out just like so 30 30 30 so that's how
01:24 - you move a model in Roblox Studio super
01:27 - simple really easy uh let me know if you
01:29 - enjoy it and let me know if you have any
01:31 - more ideas for videos I'll be happy to
01:32 - hear them thanks for watching
