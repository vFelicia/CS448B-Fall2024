00:00 - in this video I'm going to show you how
00:03 - to create a Tycoon on Roblox so the
00:06 - first thing you want to do when you're
00:07 - in Roblox studio is click on this new
00:09 - button in the top left corner and then
00:12 - select base plate
00:14 - next you'll want to make sure that
00:16 - you've got the Explorer panel and the
00:19 - properties panel opened up if you
00:21 - haven't then all you need to do is click
00:23 - on The View tab here at the top and then
00:26 - make sure that the Explorer panel and
00:28 - properties button are both selected once
00:32 - you've done that you should see your
00:33 - Roblox Studio set up just like this some
00:36 - of your panels may be in different areas
00:38 - of the screen that's fine
00:40 - the first thing we're going to do is
00:42 - we're going to build our Tycoon and you
00:44 - can do this by using the part button
00:47 - which you can find underneath the Home
00:49 - tab right here so click to insert a few
00:52 - parts and then use the four tools select
00:54 - move scale and rotate to manipulate them
00:57 - however you'd like
01:00 - so here's my Tycoon I've just got a very
01:02 - basic part here and some surrounding
01:04 - walls I'm going to select them all and
01:07 - then in the properties panel I'm going
01:09 - to scroll down and make sure that the
01:11 - anchored property is checked this will
01:13 - make sure that the parts don't fall
01:16 - apart when the game begins
01:19 - next we're going to want to create a
01:21 - button for players to step on if they
01:24 - want to purchase items in the Tycoon so
01:26 - again let's head up here and click on
01:29 - the model tab or the Home tab and choose
01:31 - part here
01:33 - then I'm going to just go down here and
01:36 - zoom in a little bit and make it more
01:38 - like a square and I'm going to then head
01:41 - back up here under the model tab make
01:44 - sure that move is unchecked so that I
01:47 - can finally rescale this part to be much
01:50 - thinner like this and finally I'm going
01:53 - to head to the properties Tab and under
01:55 - brick color I'm going to choose a red
01:57 - color there we go we've got our button
02:01 - let's also add some text on top of this
02:04 - button to explain what the button will
02:06 - purchase so let's right click on our
02:09 - part select insert object and then we
02:12 - can search for a billboard GUI
02:17 - click on it to insert the billboard GUI
02:18 - and if you have a look in the Explorer
02:20 - panel you will see it's been inserted
02:22 - inside our part
02:24 - if we select the billboard GUI let's
02:26 - head down to the properties window and
02:28 - under the scale property let's set this
02:30 - to 4 comma 0 comma two comma zero this
02:35 - will just set the size of our billboard
02:37 - GUI and then we just want it to appear
02:40 - around two studs above the part so we
02:43 - can change the studs offset World space
02:46 - property to zero comma two comma zero
02:49 - which will put it two studs above the
02:52 - button if you press enter you can see
02:54 - we've got this blue outline and that's
02:56 - where our text is going to go
02:59 - you can also in the properties panel
03:01 - just set the always on top property to
03:03 - be checked this will make sure it
03:05 - doesn't get covered up by any other
03:07 - parts
03:08 - so let's head back here and in the
03:10 - Explorer panel we're going to click on
03:12 - this little plus next to our billboard
03:14 - GUI and let's insert a text label
03:18 - now if we just pop back out here you can
03:20 - see we've got some text appearing on our
03:22 - screen
03:23 - let's just go back to the text label and
03:25 - select it in the Explorer and then we'll
03:28 - head down to the properties window and
03:30 - we're going to set the size of this
03:32 - button to 1 comma 0 comma 1 comma zero
03:35 - this is going to make the text label
03:37 - fill the entire space in our billboard
03:40 - GUI just like that if we head back to
03:43 - the properties window and scroll down we
03:46 - can check the text scaled box what this
03:49 - is going to do is make the text fill the
03:51 - entire width and height of our billboard
03:53 - GUI and then we can just scroll up here
03:57 - set the background transparency of the
04:00 - button to one of the label sorry that's
04:03 - going to make the background disappear
04:05 - and we can scroll down again
04:08 - and we can set the font face of our text
04:10 - I'm going to choose verdoka1 and then
04:14 - going to set the text color 3 to be a
04:17 - solid white so I'm just going to drag
04:19 - this all the way up here
04:21 - click OK and you can set some text if
04:24 - you'd like I'm just going to leave it at
04:25 - label for now because we will change
04:27 - this using a script
04:29 - so we've got the text for our button and
04:32 - if you'd like you can customize it even
04:34 - more by inserting into the text label a
04:38 - UI stroke that's going to give it an
04:40 - outline which you can see here is a thin
04:44 - black outline but in the properties
04:45 - panel you can change the color if you'd
04:48 - like I could set it to a red and I could
04:50 - change the thickness
04:52 - Etc
04:52 - so that will do for now so we've got our
04:55 - button and we've got our Tycoon all
04:58 - that's left to do is now do some
05:00 - scripting to make our Tycoon work
05:03 - now just to avoid this clipping issue at
05:06 - the sides of our label we can head back
05:08 - to our text label up here and then in
05:11 - the properties panel we can just change
05:13 - the size to 0.9 comma 0 comma 0.9 comma
05:17 - zero that will just give us some padding
05:19 - at the sides and we can also just change
05:24 - the thickness of the stroke like that
05:27 - and whilst we're at it let's just do
05:29 - some quick organization to clean up our
05:32 - Explorer I'm going to start off by in
05:35 - the workspace clicking on this plus icon
05:37 - and inserting a folder I'm going to call
05:39 - this folder tycoons this is just going
05:42 - to be where all of the tycoons in the
05:44 - game are going to be stored because
05:45 - there's going to be multiple players in
05:47 - our game then I'm going to insert a
05:50 - model and this is going to contain each
05:53 - Tycoon so I'm going to rename this model
05:56 - Tycoon and inside every Tycoon we're
06:00 - going to have a few more folders so I'm
06:01 - going to insert a folder and I'm going
06:03 - to rename this to be called buttons
06:05 - that's where all the buttons will go and
06:08 - then go into right click select
06:10 - duplicate to create another folder I'm
06:12 - going to rename this one as decoration
06:16 - and then we're going to right click
06:17 - duplicate once more and rename this one
06:20 - to be called items so we will store the
06:23 - buttons in this one any decorative items
06:25 - such as the walls of our tycoon or the
06:28 - floor in the decorations folder and any
06:30 - items that will be purchased will go
06:32 - into the items folder now let's take all
06:35 - of our parts here except for the button
06:37 - so we'll just select these four here for
06:40 - our walls and our flooring we'll put
06:43 - them into the decoration folder we'll
06:45 - take our part over here which is our
06:47 - Button as you can see I'm just going to
06:50 - rename this down in the properties
06:51 - window or you can right click and select
06:54 - rename it's going to call it button
06:57 - and I'm going to put this inside our
06:59 - buttons folder there we go that's way
07:02 - more neat and organized
07:04 - now I'm going to show you how to add
07:06 - some items that you can purchase in your
07:08 - Tycoon now I'm going to insert a
07:11 - conveyor that's a typical item that you
07:13 - use in a tycoon but it's up to you which
07:16 - items you add you don't have to add a
07:17 - conveyor I'm just trying to show you how
07:20 - the process works so I'm going to go to
07:22 - the toolbox which is a collection of
07:24 - models that we can use so go to the Home
07:27 - tab and select toolbox and then you can
07:30 - search for a model under the model
07:31 - section and I've just searched for a
07:33 - conveyor this one looks quite good so
07:36 - I'm just going to take it and drag it
07:38 - into the world now be careful because
07:41 - some conveyors can have scripts inside
07:43 - of them which is okay just click on the
07:45 - OK button here but just make sure you
07:47 - check them because some can have some
07:49 - dangerous scripts which are in there to
07:52 - cause trouble this one however looks
07:54 - good Okay so we've got our conveyor and
07:57 - I'm just going to select the model of
07:59 - this conveyor over here
08:01 - and you're going to right click and
08:03 - rename it as conveyor
08:05 - now what we need to do is we need to set
08:08 - some attributes and attribute is a
08:10 - little bit like a property it's just a
08:11 - way to store some information about a
08:14 - specific item and in a tycoon we're
08:16 - going to need to save the contents of
08:19 - our Tycoon at some point so rather than
08:21 - doing this by saying there's a conveyor
08:24 - here and there's a conveyor there we can
08:26 - just give every single item an ID and
08:29 - then we can store information about what
08:31 - items a players unlocked in their Tycoon
08:34 - by just listing off the IDS for every
08:36 - single item because if every item has an
08:38 - ID it will just make it really simple to
08:41 - track so let's give our conveyor some
08:44 - attributes for the ID as well as that
08:46 - we're going to want to have a cost
08:47 - attribute a price attribute so that the
08:50 - game knows how much each item is going
08:52 - to cost so down in the properties tab
08:55 - when you have your conveyor selected as
08:57 - you can see in the corner here there it
08:59 - is we're going to go to the attribute
09:01 - section I'm going to click on ADD
09:02 - attribute
09:04 - now a pop-up will appear down here and
09:07 - we're going to set it to be a number and
09:09 - we'll just call it cost to begin with
09:11 - okay and we'll do the same thing again
09:13 - add attribute the pop-up will appear
09:16 - we'll set the type to be a number and
09:18 - this one will be called ID
09:21 - so we've now got our attributes these
09:23 - are just custom properties so let's set
09:26 - the cost of this of this conveyor to be
09:28 - 50 for example you can change this to
09:30 - whatever you'd like and the ID will just
09:33 - set that to be number one so the next
09:35 - item we add to the game we'll just set
09:37 - the ID to be two we don't want any items
09:39 - to have the same ID every single ID
09:42 - attribute will need to be unique for
09:44 - every single item this is how we'll be
09:46 - able to uniquely identify and
09:48 - distinguish between them
09:50 - so now we've done that what we're going
09:52 - to do is we're going to take this
09:54 - conveyor and we're just going to store
09:56 - it temporarily in the replicated storage
09:59 - but before we do that let's just
10:01 - position it where we'd like it to go in
10:03 - our Tycoon so I'm just going to drag it
10:05 - and I'm going to put it about here now I
10:08 - can see that the conveyor is a little
10:10 - bit too big and that's fine I'm just
10:12 - going to move my walls over slightly and
10:16 - just resize everything
10:18 - and once I've done that and it's all in
10:21 - the correct position where I'd like it
10:22 - to go I'm just going to move the button
10:25 - over here as well
10:27 - there it is and finally I'm going to
10:30 - right click on my conveyor choose copy
10:34 - and then in the Explorer window we're
10:36 - just going to create a folder in the
10:38 - replicated storage
10:40 - and we're going to name this folder
10:42 - items
10:44 - and then I'm just going to right click
10:46 - and select paste into
10:48 - that's going to create a clone of our
10:50 - conveyor and store it in the replicated
10:53 - storage
10:54 - so what we're doing here is we're having
10:55 - a conveyor stored in our Tycoon so we
10:58 - can actually take this conveyor that's
10:59 - in the workspace and now drag it into
11:02 - our items folder this is just going to
11:04 - be our way of telling the game where we
11:06 - want the conveyor to be positioned and
11:08 - then what we're going to do is when we
11:10 - start the game we're going to strip out
11:12 - all of these items from the Tycoon and
11:16 - when the player buys the item we will
11:19 - then bring it back by creating a clone
11:21 - of it from the replicated storage so
11:24 - this uh conveyor that's in the workspace
11:26 - is just here so that we can position all
11:29 - of our items where we want them to be
11:31 - and then when the game starts up we'll
11:33 - delete these items until the player
11:35 - unlocks them
11:37 - that may be a little bit confusing but
11:39 - don't worry it will all make sense when
11:41 - we see it happening with code later on
11:44 - so everything is now all set up and all
11:47 - that we can now do is write some code so
11:50 - what we'll do is back in the Explorer
11:53 - here let's click on the plus next to the
11:56 - server script service this is where all
11:58 - of our code is going to be stored so
12:00 - click on that plus and just search for a
12:02 - script and make sure whoops I've
12:04 - inserted the wrong script make sure that
12:06 - you insert a normal script okay a gray
12:09 - script
12:11 - now inside of this script we're going to
12:14 - write quite a few lines of code I'm just
12:17 - going to hide this one here so in this
12:18 - script this is the script editor it's
12:20 - where we write all of our code we're
12:21 - going to write some code which will
12:23 - detect when a new player joins the game
12:25 - we'll assign a tycoon to them we will
12:28 - set up all of the buttons and handle the
12:31 - logic for when they step on a button we
12:33 - will handle the currencies so the player
12:37 - will be able to deduct cash when they
12:39 - step on a button and will also handle
12:41 - the positioning of items in the Tycoon
12:44 - as well when you step on a button
12:47 - so to start with let's write some code
12:49 - that will set up a leader stats and some
12:53 - cash for a player when they first join
12:57 - so here we're saying game.players dot
12:59 - player added colon connect function
13:01 - player and this is going to trigger
13:04 - every single time a new player joins and
13:07 - when they do join we want to set up some
13:09 - leader stats so they appear on the
13:11 - leaderboard so we can say
13:14 - local leader stats
13:16 - equals instance dot new we're going to
13:19 - create a folder
13:21 - and within this folder well firstly
13:24 - let's just give this folder a name and
13:27 - we can call it leader stats and we can
13:30 - parent that to go inside the player's
13:33 - object so we've now got a leader stats
13:36 - folder and any uh values that goes
13:39 - inside this folder will appear on the
13:41 - in-game leaderboard so we want the
13:43 - player to have some cash so we can say
13:45 - local cache equals instance dot new into
13:48 - value
13:49 - and cache dot name equals cache
13:54 - and I'm just going to change this to
13:58 - speech marks just to be consistent
14:01 - rather than
14:02 - quotation marks there we go cash dot
14:05 - parent equals leader stats and I'm going
14:09 - to set the player's cache to be 500 when
14:11 - they first join the game we'll handle
14:13 - data saving probably in another video
14:15 - for now this is good to go so if you
14:18 - click on the play button in the script
14:20 - editor up here
14:22 - you should see that when the player
14:23 - joins the game they have some leader
14:26 - stats
14:28 - all right
14:30 - there they are you can see we're now
14:31 - appearing on the leaderboard with our
14:33 - leader stats and if we were to head into
14:35 - the players you can see we've got this
14:37 - folder with our leader stats so that's
14:39 - what we've just set up using Code when a
14:41 - new player joins this folder gets added
14:44 - to their player
14:47 - next we want to be able to assign a
14:49 - tycoon to a specific player we've only
14:52 - got one Tycoon at the moment but you
14:54 - know what we could do is we could just
14:55 - take our Tycoon up here in the Explorer
14:58 - right click it duplicate it and move it
15:02 - across over here so we've now got two
15:04 - tycoons okay we could do that and have a
15:07 - third Tycoon doesn't matter we can have
15:09 - loads of tycoons but out of all of these
15:11 - tycoons which one are we going to assign
15:13 - to a player well that's what we're going
15:15 - to work on now but before that we just
15:17 - need to set up a few more attributes
15:19 - because we need to store information
15:20 - about who owns a specific Tycoon
15:24 - so if we head back to the Explorer panel
15:27 - and just select all of our four tycoons
15:29 - at the moment and then head down to the
15:31 - properties panel let's select add
15:33 - attribute and we want a Boolean value
15:37 - which is a true or false value I'm going
15:39 - to call that taken so that will let us
15:42 - know whether the plot is being used by
15:45 - someone or whether it's vacant and we
15:47 - can use it
15:48 - so we'll then add another attribute and
15:50 - this one is going to be the user ID of
15:53 - the person who owns this Tycoon
15:57 - so this is going to be a number and
16:00 - we'll just call it user ID with a
16:02 - capital u for user and a capital I for
16:05 - ID
16:06 - so now all of our tycoons will have
16:08 - these attributes and we can now check
16:10 - those attributes using code and also set
16:13 - them when a new player joins the game
16:16 - so back in our script let's create a
16:18 - function which will assign a tycoon to a
16:21 - player so we're just going to create a
16:23 - local function call it assigned Tycoon
16:26 - and we're going to take a parameter on
16:28 - argument sorry of the player who has
16:32 - called this function so we'll call this
16:34 - function from the player added event
16:36 - down here and what we want to do is we
16:38 - just want to Loop through all the
16:39 - tycoons in the game that are in the
16:41 - tycoons folder so we can say four
16:45 - underscore comma tycoon in game dot
16:50 - workspace
16:51 - in fact let's create a variable for our
16:53 - tycoons folder
16:55 - so we can say local tycoons equals game
16:58 - dot workspace wait for child
17:01 - tycoons
17:04 - okay
17:05 - and so for underscore comma tycoon in
17:08 - tycoons colon get children so this is
17:12 - going to return a table of all of the
17:14 - tycoons within this folder and then
17:17 - we're going to Loop through each
17:18 - individual Tycoon and just check to see
17:21 - if that taken value is false and if it
17:25 - is false then we know that this is a
17:27 - tycoon that is not currently being used
17:29 - so we can say if Tycoon colon gets
17:32 - attribute taken
17:35 - then continue end because this will just
17:39 - check to see if it is true so if this is
17:41 - true then this if statement is going to
17:43 - resolve and by saying continue we can
17:46 - just skip to the next Tycoon because we
17:49 - know that this one will be taken so this
17:51 - is just a check to make sure whether the
17:53 - Tycoon is free or not
17:55 - so then if the code doesn't continue and
17:58 - it just carries on to the next line
17:59 - we'll know that this Tycoon is free so
18:02 - we can say Tycoon colon set attribute
18:04 - taken we'll set that to true and also
18:08 - Tycoon set attributes
18:11 - user ID
18:13 - we're just going to set that to player
18:16 - dot user ID
18:18 - so we now
18:19 - what we'll also do is because we found
18:21 - our Tycoon we can just say return Tycoon
18:24 - which will break out of our for Loop and
18:27 - stop this function because we no longer
18:29 - need to keep it running
18:31 - and we can also return nil just in case
18:35 - no tycoons get found it will just break
18:38 - out of this for Loop and return nil so
18:41 - that we won't continue any further
18:43 - because there's obviously some sort of
18:44 - error that's occurred for there not to
18:47 - be enough tycoons available
18:49 - so now back down here with our player
18:52 - added function we can create a variable
18:56 - for the Tycoon which we're going to give
18:58 - to our player so we can say local Tycoon
19:02 - equals sign Tycoon and we can pass the
19:07 - player through there
19:08 - as our parameter
19:10 - and what this will do is because we're
19:12 - returning the Tycoon once we have found
19:15 - a plot for them the Tycoon variable will
19:18 - become the Tycoon object which will be
19:20 - in the Explorer so one of these tycoons
19:22 - will get returned to this variable and
19:25 - we'll be able to reference that Tycoon
19:27 - model as a variable
19:30 - and in case there's an error and for
19:32 - some reason we can't give them a tycoon
19:34 - because it's none available and we
19:35 - return nil we'll just do a quick check
19:37 - to say if not Tycoon then warn
19:44 - could not assign Tycoon to dot dot
19:49 - player dot name
19:51 - and we can just say return end
19:55 - so that will print out into the output
19:57 - an error message in case the Tycoon
19:59 - isn't available
20:01 - but what we've just done is we've
20:03 - created a script to find an available
20:06 - Tycoon and assign it to our player so if
20:09 - we now click on the play button up here
20:11 - in the script menu
20:14 - we should join the game
20:16 - and we should have been assigned a
20:18 - tycoon if we just go to the Explorer
20:21 - and we have a look in here in our
20:24 - tycoons folder we'll just pick a random
20:27 - one
20:28 - probably the first one and you can see
20:30 - the attribute of Taken has been checked
20:32 - and the user ID is indeed my user id
20:35 - here and just to prove if I select
20:37 - another Tycoon the second one for
20:40 - example you can see it is not taken and
20:43 - there's no user ID so it's picked one
20:45 - Tycoon to be mine and it set the
20:48 - attributes to my user ID and it's set
20:52 - its taken value to be true
20:55 - now what we've got to do next is set up
20:58 - our buttons so that when we step on them
21:00 - it unlocks the items we'll also need to
21:03 - set up the Billboards for the buttons
21:05 - we'll also have to clean up the Tycoon
21:09 - when the player leaves but aside from
21:12 - that that's all we're going to have to
21:13 - do in order to create a functioning
21:15 - Tycoon and that will be in the next
21:18 - video which will be linked in the card
21:20 - or in the description so I'll see you
21:22 - there don't forget to subscribe and like
21:24 - the video if you found this useful and
21:27 - I'll see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

in this video I'm going to show you how to create a Tycoon on Roblox so the first thing you want to do when you're in Roblox studio is click on this new button in the top left corner and then select base plate next you'll want to make sure that you've got the Explorer panel and the properties panel opened up if you haven't then all you need to do is click on The View tab here at the top and then make sure that the Explorer panel and properties button are both selected once you've done that you should see your Roblox Studio set up just like this some of your panels may be in different areas of the screen that's fine the first thing we're going to do is we're going to build our Tycoon and you can do this by using the part button which you can find underneath the Home tab right here so click to insert a few parts and then use the four tools select move scale and rotate to manipulate them however you'd like so here's my Tycoon I've just got a very basic part here and some surrounding walls I'm going to select them all and then in the properties panel I'm going to scroll down and make sure that the anchored property is checked this will make sure that the parts don't fall apart when the game begins next we're going to want to create a button for players to step on if they want to purchase items in the Tycoon so again let's head up here and click on the model tab or the Home tab and choose part here then I'm going to just go down here and zoom in a little bit and make it more like a square and I'm going to then head back up here under the model tab make sure that move is unchecked so that I can finally rescale this part to be much thinner like this and finally I'm going to head to the properties Tab and under brick color I'm going to choose a red color there we go we've got our button let's also add some text on top of this button to explain what the button will purchase so let's right click on our part select insert object and then we can search for a billboard GUI click on it to insert the billboard GUI and if you have a look in the Explorer panel you will see it's been inserted inside our part if we select the billboard GUI let's head down to the properties window and under the scale property let's set this to 4 comma 0 comma two comma zero this will just set the size of our billboard GUI and then we just want it to appear around two studs above the part so we can change the studs offset World space property to zero comma two comma zero which will put it two studs above the button if you press enter you can see we've got this blue outline and that's where our text is going to go you can also in the properties panel just set the always on top property to be checked this will make sure it doesn't get covered up by any other parts so let's head back here and in the Explorer panel we're going to click on this little plus next to our billboard GUI and let's insert a text label now if we just pop back out here you can see we've got some text appearing on our screen let's just go back to the text label and select it in the Explorer and then we'll head down to the properties window and we're going to set the size of this button to 1 comma 0 comma 1 comma zero this is going to make the text label fill the entire space in our billboard GUI just like that if we head back to the properties window and scroll down we can check the text scaled box what this is going to do is make the text fill the entire width and height of our billboard GUI and then we can just scroll up here set the background transparency of the button to one of the label sorry that's going to make the background disappear and we can scroll down again and we can set the font face of our text I'm going to choose verdoka1 and then going to set the text color 3 to be a solid white so I'm just going to drag this all the way up here click OK and you can set some text if you'd like I'm just going to leave it at label for now because we will change this using a script so we've got the text for our button and if you'd like you can customize it even more by inserting into the text label a UI stroke that's going to give it an outline which you can see here is a thin black outline but in the properties panel you can change the color if you'd like I could set it to a red and I could change the thickness Etc so that will do for now so we've got our button and we've got our Tycoon all that's left to do is now do some scripting to make our Tycoon work now just to avoid this clipping issue at the sides of our label we can head back to our text label up here and then in the properties panel we can just change the size to 0.9 comma 0 comma 0.9 comma zero that will just give us some padding at the sides and we can also just change the thickness of the stroke like that and whilst we're at it let's just do some quick organization to clean up our Explorer I'm going to start off by in the workspace clicking on this plus icon and inserting a folder I'm going to call this folder tycoons this is just going to be where all of the tycoons in the game are going to be stored because there's going to be multiple players in our game then I'm going to insert a model and this is going to contain each Tycoon so I'm going to rename this model Tycoon and inside every Tycoon we're going to have a few more folders so I'm going to insert a folder and I'm going to rename this to be called buttons that's where all the buttons will go and then go into right click select duplicate to create another folder I'm going to rename this one as decoration and then we're going to right click duplicate once more and rename this one to be called items so we will store the buttons in this one any decorative items such as the walls of our tycoon or the floor in the decorations folder and any items that will be purchased will go into the items folder now let's take all of our parts here except for the button so we'll just select these four here for our walls and our flooring we'll put them into the decoration folder we'll take our part over here which is our Button as you can see I'm just going to rename this down in the properties window or you can right click and select rename it's going to call it button and I'm going to put this inside our buttons folder there we go that's way more neat and organized now I'm going to show you how to add some items that you can purchase in your Tycoon now I'm going to insert a conveyor that's a typical item that you use in a tycoon but it's up to you which items you add you don't have to add a conveyor I'm just trying to show you how the process works so I'm going to go to the toolbox which is a collection of models that we can use so go to the Home tab and select toolbox and then you can search for a model under the model section and I've just searched for a conveyor this one looks quite good so I'm just going to take it and drag it into the world now be careful because some conveyors can have scripts inside of them which is okay just click on the OK button here but just make sure you check them because some can have some dangerous scripts which are in there to cause trouble this one however looks good Okay so we've got our conveyor and I'm just going to select the model of this conveyor over here and you're going to right click and rename it as conveyor now what we need to do is we need to set some attributes and attribute is a little bit like a property it's just a way to store some information about a specific item and in a tycoon we're going to need to save the contents of our Tycoon at some point so rather than doing this by saying there's a conveyor here and there's a conveyor there we can just give every single item an ID and then we can store information about what items a players unlocked in their Tycoon by just listing off the IDS for every single item because if every item has an ID it will just make it really simple to track so let's give our conveyor some attributes for the ID as well as that we're going to want to have a cost attribute a price attribute so that the game knows how much each item is going to cost so down in the properties tab when you have your conveyor selected as you can see in the corner here there it is we're going to go to the attribute section I'm going to click on ADD attribute now a popup will appear down here and we're going to set it to be a number and we'll just call it cost to begin with okay and we'll do the same thing again add attribute the popup will appear we'll set the type to be a number and this one will be called ID so we've now got our attributes these are just custom properties so let's set the cost of this of this conveyor to be 50 for example you can change this to whatever you'd like and the ID will just set that to be number one so the next item we add to the game we'll just set the ID to be two we don't want any items to have the same ID every single ID attribute will need to be unique for every single item this is how we'll be able to uniquely identify and distinguish between them so now we've done that what we're going to do is we're going to take this conveyor and we're just going to store it temporarily in the replicated storage but before we do that let's just position it where we'd like it to go in our Tycoon so I'm just going to drag it and I'm going to put it about here now I can see that the conveyor is a little bit too big and that's fine I'm just going to move my walls over slightly and just resize everything and once I've done that and it's all in the correct position where I'd like it to go I'm just going to move the button over here as well there it is and finally I'm going to right click on my conveyor choose copy and then in the Explorer window we're just going to create a folder in the replicated storage and we're going to name this folder items and then I'm just going to right click and select paste into that's going to create a clone of our conveyor and store it in the replicated storage so what we're doing here is we're having a conveyor stored in our Tycoon so we can actually take this conveyor that's in the workspace and now drag it into our items folder this is just going to be our way of telling the game where we want the conveyor to be positioned and then what we're going to do is when we start the game we're going to strip out all of these items from the Tycoon and when the player buys the item we will then bring it back by creating a clone of it from the replicated storage so this uh conveyor that's in the workspace is just here so that we can position all of our items where we want them to be and then when the game starts up we'll delete these items until the player unlocks them that may be a little bit confusing but don't worry it will all make sense when we see it happening with code later on so everything is now all set up and all that we can now do is write some code so what we'll do is back in the Explorer here let's click on the plus next to the server script service this is where all of our code is going to be stored so click on that plus and just search for a script and make sure whoops I've inserted the wrong script make sure that you insert a normal script okay a gray script now inside of this script we're going to write quite a few lines of code I'm just going to hide this one here so in this script this is the script editor it's where we write all of our code we're going to write some code which will detect when a new player joins the game we'll assign a tycoon to them we will set up all of the buttons and handle the logic for when they step on a button we will handle the currencies so the player will be able to deduct cash when they step on a button and will also handle the positioning of items in the Tycoon as well when you step on a button so to start with let's write some code that will set up a leader stats and some cash for a player when they first join so here we're saying game.players dot player added colon connect function player and this is going to trigger every single time a new player joins and when they do join we want to set up some leader stats so they appear on the leaderboard so we can say local leader stats equals instance dot new we're going to create a folder and within this folder well firstly let's just give this folder a name and we can call it leader stats and we can parent that to go inside the player's object so we've now got a leader stats folder and any uh values that goes inside this folder will appear on the ingame leaderboard so we want the player to have some cash so we can say local cache equals instance dot new into value and cache dot name equals cache and I'm just going to change this to speech marks just to be consistent rather than quotation marks there we go cash dot parent equals leader stats and I'm going to set the player's cache to be 500 when they first join the game we'll handle data saving probably in another video for now this is good to go so if you click on the play button in the script editor up here you should see that when the player joins the game they have some leader stats all right there they are you can see we're now appearing on the leaderboard with our leader stats and if we were to head into the players you can see we've got this folder with our leader stats so that's what we've just set up using Code when a new player joins this folder gets added to their player next we want to be able to assign a tycoon to a specific player we've only got one Tycoon at the moment but you know what we could do is we could just take our Tycoon up here in the Explorer right click it duplicate it and move it across over here so we've now got two tycoons okay we could do that and have a third Tycoon doesn't matter we can have loads of tycoons but out of all of these tycoons which one are we going to assign to a player well that's what we're going to work on now but before that we just need to set up a few more attributes because we need to store information about who owns a specific Tycoon so if we head back to the Explorer panel and just select all of our four tycoons at the moment and then head down to the properties panel let's select add attribute and we want a Boolean value which is a true or false value I'm going to call that taken so that will let us know whether the plot is being used by someone or whether it's vacant and we can use it so we'll then add another attribute and this one is going to be the user ID of the person who owns this Tycoon so this is going to be a number and we'll just call it user ID with a capital u for user and a capital I for ID so now all of our tycoons will have these attributes and we can now check those attributes using code and also set them when a new player joins the game so back in our script let's create a function which will assign a tycoon to a player so we're just going to create a local function call it assigned Tycoon and we're going to take a parameter on argument sorry of the player who has called this function so we'll call this function from the player added event down here and what we want to do is we just want to Loop through all the tycoons in the game that are in the tycoons folder so we can say four underscore comma tycoon in game dot workspace in fact let's create a variable for our tycoons folder so we can say local tycoons equals game dot workspace wait for child tycoons okay and so for underscore comma tycoon in tycoons colon get children so this is going to return a table of all of the tycoons within this folder and then we're going to Loop through each individual Tycoon and just check to see if that taken value is false and if it is false then we know that this is a tycoon that is not currently being used so we can say if Tycoon colon gets attribute taken then continue end because this will just check to see if it is true so if this is true then this if statement is going to resolve and by saying continue we can just skip to the next Tycoon because we know that this one will be taken so this is just a check to make sure whether the Tycoon is free or not so then if the code doesn't continue and it just carries on to the next line we'll know that this Tycoon is free so we can say Tycoon colon set attribute taken we'll set that to true and also Tycoon set attributes user ID we're just going to set that to player dot user ID so we now what we'll also do is because we found our Tycoon we can just say return Tycoon which will break out of our for Loop and stop this function because we no longer need to keep it running and we can also return nil just in case no tycoons get found it will just break out of this for Loop and return nil so that we won't continue any further because there's obviously some sort of error that's occurred for there not to be enough tycoons available so now back down here with our player added function we can create a variable for the Tycoon which we're going to give to our player so we can say local Tycoon equals sign Tycoon and we can pass the player through there as our parameter and what this will do is because we're returning the Tycoon once we have found a plot for them the Tycoon variable will become the Tycoon object which will be in the Explorer so one of these tycoons will get returned to this variable and we'll be able to reference that Tycoon model as a variable and in case there's an error and for some reason we can't give them a tycoon because it's none available and we return nil we'll just do a quick check to say if not Tycoon then warn could not assign Tycoon to dot dot player dot name and we can just say return end so that will print out into the output an error message in case the Tycoon isn't available but what we've just done is we've created a script to find an available Tycoon and assign it to our player so if we now click on the play button up here in the script menu we should join the game and we should have been assigned a tycoon if we just go to the Explorer and we have a look in here in our tycoons folder we'll just pick a random one probably the first one and you can see the attribute of Taken has been checked and the user ID is indeed my user id here and just to prove if I select another Tycoon the second one for example you can see it is not taken and there's no user ID so it's picked one Tycoon to be mine and it set the attributes to my user ID and it's set its taken value to be true now what we've got to do next is set up our buttons so that when we step on them it unlocks the items we'll also need to set up the Billboards for the buttons we'll also have to clean up the Tycoon when the player leaves but aside from that that's all we're going to have to do in order to create a functioning Tycoon and that will be in the next video which will be linked in the card or in the description so I'll see you there don't
