00:00 - what's up guys i'm punji from
00:01 - programmers and welcome back to the
00:02 - series on javascript in the last few
00:04 - videos we learned about boolean
00:06 - expressions and comparison operators we
00:09 - also learned that these boolean
00:10 - expressions evaluate to either true or
00:12 - false in this video we will learn about
00:15 - if else statements to perform different
00:17 - actions under different conditions if
00:19 - the condition is true we will do one set
00:21 - of tasks and if the condition is false
00:23 - we will do another set of tasks this is
00:26 - called decision making in programming
00:28 - now let's see how we can implement
00:29 - decision making in javascript
00:35 - the if statement is used to make
00:36 - decisions in programming let's start by
00:39 - looking at its syntax the if statement
00:41 - starts with the if keyword
00:44 - followed by the test condition inside
00:46 - parentheses
00:49 - this test condition is a boolean
00:51 - expression that results in either true
00:52 - or false
00:54 - if the test condition is true
00:56 - then the code inside the body of the if
00:58 - is executed
01:00 - however if the test condition is false
01:02 - the body of the if statement is skipped
01:04 - from execution
01:05 - let me give you a more practical example
01:07 - to drive home the idea suppose you're a
01:09 - university student and to pass the
01:11 - examination you need to score 50 or more
01:14 - let's try to implement this in our
01:16 - program i'll remove this or code and let
01:18 - me start by creating a variable that
01:20 - will store the mark that you entered so
01:22 - i can say const score
01:25 - equals
01:26 - prompt
01:28 - enter your marks
01:31 - now i need to wrap it inside parseint
01:33 - because i needed number format
01:36 - so pass into
01:40 - all right
01:41 - then i'll use the if statement with the
01:42 - test condition to check whether max is
01:45 - greater than or equal to 50.
01:48 - so on the next line i'll say if
01:51 - score greater than equals 50
01:54 - and if this test condition is true
01:56 - i want to print that you have passed
01:58 - your exams message so let me create a
02:00 - block and inside i'll say console.log
02:04 - you have
02:06 - you have passed the exam
02:10 - let me put a congratulations message as
02:12 - well so i can say
02:14 - congratulations
02:17 - let me run this program
02:19 - and i'll put something like 80
02:22 - and you can see that you have passed the
02:24 - exam and congratulations are printed on
02:26 - the screen
02:27 - here the value of the score is 80 which
02:30 - is greater than 50. so the test
02:32 - condition score greater than or equal to
02:34 - 50 is true and that is why these two
02:37 - statements were executed and that is why
02:39 - these two lines were printed to the
02:41 - screen
02:42 - let me run this program again but this
02:45 - time i'll enter something like 40
02:48 - and when i press enter
02:50 - you can see that nothing happened
02:53 - so let's see what happened here when i
02:55 - entered 40
02:56 - this check was false
02:59 - and that's why these two statements were
03:00 - skipped and since this is the end of the
03:02 - program nothing was printed to the
03:04 - screen
03:05 - now it would have been better if you
03:06 - could print some message like sorry you
03:08 - failed your exam in this case so what
03:10 - i'll do is i'll add another if statement
03:13 - i'll say if
03:14 - score less than
03:17 - and then i can say console.log
03:20 - sorry you failed your
03:23 - exam
03:25 - now this time when i press run
03:29 - and enter 40
03:31 - you can see that sorry you failed your
03:33 - exam was printed
03:35 - this is because although the first
03:36 - condition score greater than or equals
03:38 - to 50 was false and these two statements
03:41 - were not executed the control of the
03:43 - program then passed on to the second if
03:46 - which says score less than 50 since this
03:48 - is true
03:50 - this statement is executed and we see
03:52 - that on the output
03:54 - if you're enjoying this video please

03:58 - provide tutorials along with quizzes and

04:02 - and test your learning in real time also
04:04 - the course includes projects to give you
04:06 - an awesome experience of how programming
04:07 - works in the real world and for our
04:09 - youtube subscribers we are giving 50 off
04:11 - on the yearly plan sign up by scanning
04:13 - this qr code or use the link in the
04:15 - video description to claim your discount
04:19 - i have this code from my last section
04:21 - i'll remove the code of user input and
04:23 - assign a score with a hard coded value
04:25 - so that it's easier to focus on the
04:27 - logic of the if statement so let me
04:29 - remove this percent and prompt and i'll
04:31 - just put something like 40 here
04:33 - in this program we have used two
04:35 - different if statements to perform two
04:37 - different tasks we know the student
04:39 - passes the exam if the score is higher
04:41 - than or equal to 50 which you can see in
04:43 - the first if statement
04:45 - similarly if the score is below 50 the
04:48 - student fills the exam which we can see
04:50 - in the second if statement
04:52 - here we are absolutely sure that only
04:54 - one of the if statements will be true in
04:56 - such cases instead of writing the second
04:59 - if statement with the condition we can
05:01 - use the else clause let's first look at
05:03 - the syntax of the if statement with else
05:05 - clause
05:06 - what happens here is that if our test
05:08 - condition
05:09 - is true
05:10 - these statements inside the if block are
05:13 - executed
05:14 - and if it's false by default the code
05:17 - inside the else block is executed now
05:19 - getting back to our code to print
05:21 - whether the student passed or failed the
05:22 - exam
05:26 - i'll now remove the second if statement
05:28 - instead i'll use an else clause so here
05:31 - i'll remove this else is if
05:34 - i'll put else and the condition here is
05:36 - not needed now
05:38 - let me read this quote in plain english
05:41 - if the score is greater than or equal to
05:43 - 50
05:44 - then
05:45 - print or console log you have passed the
05:47 - exam and congratulations
05:49 - else print sorry you failed your exam
05:53 - the else clause catches anything that's
05:55 - not covered in the if condition now when
05:58 - i run this code
05:58 - [Music]
06:00 - as you can see sorry you failed your
06:02 - exam is printed to the screen
06:08 - the if statement with the else clause
06:10 - allows us to make a choice from two
06:12 - different options however sometimes we
06:14 - need to make a choice from more than two
06:16 - options in those cases we can use the
06:19 - else if clause with the test condition
06:21 - let's see its syntax first
06:23 - the if statement checks the condition
06:25 - inside the first if
06:27 - if it's true the body of the if
06:28 - statement is executed and statement 2
06:31 - and statement 3 are skipped however
06:34 - if the first test condition is false the
06:36 - control of the program jumps to the
06:38 - second if condition and if this is true
06:41 - then statements 2 is executed and
06:43 - statement 3 and statement 1 are not
06:46 - executed
06:47 - if both of these are false then
06:49 - statements 3 or the body of the else
06:52 - statement is executed
06:54 - if necessary we can also add more
06:57 - elsif conditions
06:59 - like this
07:01 - so i can add one more or even 10 more
07:04 - and it will work the same way
07:07 - now that we know how the elsif clause
07:08 - works let's get back to our code to
07:10 - check whether student passed or failed
07:12 - the exam here this core variable stores
07:15 - the marks obtained by the student so it
07:18 - shouldn't be greater than 100 or a
07:19 - negative number however in our program
07:22 - if the score is greater than 100 say 120
07:25 - our test condition of score greater than
07:27 - or equal to 50 becomes true hence you
07:30 - have passed your exam and
07:31 - congratulations will be printed even
07:33 - though the score is invalid logically
07:35 - and if the score is a negative number
07:37 - sorry you have failed the exam is
07:38 - printed because our test condition is
07:40 - false again the score shouldn't be less
07:42 - than zero we need to fix this we can fix
07:45 - this by adding a condition to check if
07:47 - the score is valid or not at the
07:48 - beginning only then we will check if the
07:51 - student passed or failed the exam so let
07:52 - me change the code here i'll add two
07:55 - conditions i can say if score greater
07:58 - than 100
08:00 - then
08:01 - console log
08:04 - score is invalid
08:06 - similarly i can do
08:09 - else if
08:10 - score less than zero
08:13 - console.log
08:15 - score is invalid
08:18 - i will turn this if into an else if
08:21 - and this should do the trick for me
08:25 - this time when i press run
08:27 - it says sorry you failed the exam but
08:30 - now let me try with the other values so
08:31 - i'll say 120
08:34 - and it tells me that the score is
08:35 - invalid similarly let me try something
08:38 - like minus 10
08:39 - and when i press run
08:41 - it says score is invalid
08:44 - okay guys we need your support to keep
08:45 - this kind of content free for all users
08:47 - youtube really likes engagement on the
08:49 - video so leave a comment below press
08:51 - that like button and hit subscribe if
08:53 - you haven't already let's get the
08:54 - engagement score high up so that more
08:56 - people can discover and enjoy these
08:58 - courses
08:59 - in the last program we can see that the
09:01 - two conditions score greater than 100
09:03 - and score less than zero
09:06 - do almost the same task that is printing
09:08 - that the score is invalid in that case
09:11 - in such cases we can combine both the
09:13 - conditions together using a logical
09:15 - operator here the score is invalid if it
09:18 - is either less than 0 or greater than
09:20 - 100 so we can use the logical or
09:22 - operator let me modify this code so i
09:24 - can remove this else if first let me
09:27 - copy paste this
09:29 - and
09:30 - use the logical
09:31 - or operator here with score less than
09:33 - zero and now i can remove this else if
09:36 - here
09:37 - this condition is true
09:39 - if either of score greater than 100 is
09:43 - true or score less than zero is true
09:45 - both are the cases for which the score
09:47 - is invalid so this is printed let me run
09:50 - the program
09:52 - and you can see that it works as before
09:54 - so for both the invalid cases a single
09:57 - boolean expression does the work
10:00 - before we end this video here's a little
10:02 - tip if the body of if or else if or else
10:05 - has only one statement we can omit the
10:07 - curly braces in our programs so in case
10:10 - of the program you see on my screen
10:12 - i can remove these curly braces
10:15 - and press run
10:17 - and my program still works
10:19 - as you've seen in this video the syntax
10:21 - of the if statement is pretty simple the
10:23 - harder part is the logic behind the test
10:25 - conditions but you will get better at
10:27 - creating test conditions with practice
10:28 - so don't worry also be sure to check our
10:31 - video on comparison and logical
10:32 - operators that are used to create these
10:34 - test conditions the link will be in the
10:36 - description below
10:40 - we've covered a lot in this video it's
10:42 - time for you to practice what we learned
10:43 - here is one programming challenge for
10:45 - you to solve
10:46 - can you create a program to check
10:47 - whether a number is positive or negative
10:50 - or zero to create this program create a
10:52 - variable named number and assign a value
10:54 - to it based on the user input
10:56 - then using an if statement check if the
10:58 - number variable is positive or negative
11:01 - or zero
11:02 - if the number is positive print the
11:04 - number is positive if the number is
11:06 - negative print the number is negative
11:08 - and if the number is zero print the
11:11 - number is zero you will find the answer
11:13 - to this question in our github
11:14 - repository now we've covered almost all
11:16 - the essentials of if else but there's
11:18 - also a nested efl statement which we
11:21 - haven't covered in this video if you
11:22 - want to learn about them you can visit
11:24 - our siteprogrammers.com the link will be
11:26 - in the description below now that we
11:28 - have reached the end of this video it's
11:30 - time for the programming quiz
11:32 - what is the output of the following code
11:38 - comment answer below happy programming
