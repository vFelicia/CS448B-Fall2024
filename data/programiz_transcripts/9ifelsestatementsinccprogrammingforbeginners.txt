00:00 - hey guys this is me padma from
00:01 - programmies and welcome back to this
00:03 - series on c programming in this video
00:05 - we'll learn about if else statement in c
00:08 - programming we'll learn to create
00:10 - decision making programs that perform
00:12 - one set of tags under a certain
00:15 - condition and another set of tags under
00:17 - different condition so let's get started
00:23 - in c programming we use the if statement
00:26 - to create programs that can make
00:28 - decision let's start by looking at the
00:30 - syntax of the if statement the if
00:33 - statement starts with if keyword and is
00:36 - followed by the test condition inside
00:39 - the parenthesis
00:40 - this test condition is a boolean
00:42 - expression that results in either true
00:45 - or false
00:47 - if the test condition is true the body
00:50 - of if statement is executed otherwise it
00:54 - is skipped from the execution
00:57 - now that you know the syntax of if
00:59 - statement let's try a working example
01:02 - suppose there is an election going on
01:04 - and to cast the vote your a's must be 18
01:07 - or more if your age is 18 or more we'll
01:10 - print you are eligible to vote let's see
01:13 - how we can implement this here i have a
01:15 - basic c program now i'll create a
01:17 - variable to store is
01:20 - int is
01:21 - now i'll ask the user to input there is
01:24 - for that i'll use printf statement
01:28 - and print the message like
01:31 - enter
01:32 - here is
01:36 - then i'll use scanf statement to take
01:39 - the input
01:41 - so percent d
01:43 - comma
01:44 - ampersand is
01:51 - then i'll use if condition to check if
01:54 - a's is greater than or equals to 18.
02:00 - if this condition is true i'll print
02:07 - you are
02:08 - eligible
02:09 - to vote
02:14 - now let me run this program
02:17 - here i'll provide 31 as the is and i'll
02:20 - press enter as you can see
02:22 - you are eligible to vote is printed
02:25 - here the value is 31 so our test
02:28 - condition is greater than or equals to
02:31 - 18 is true that is why this print
02:34 - statement
02:35 - is executed
02:36 - now let me run this program again
02:39 - this time instead of 31 i'll enter 15
02:43 - this time nothing is printed on the
02:44 - screen this is because the a's is 15 so
02:47 - the test condition is is greater than or
02:50 - equals to 18 is false so the body of the
02:54 - if statement is skipped
02:56 - our program is working fine but it is
02:59 - not printing anything when the a's is
03:01 - less than 18. we might want to print
03:03 - something like sorry you are not
03:05 - eligible to vote when age is less than
03:07 - 18 so i'll add another if statement
03:12 - so i'll say
03:14 - if
03:15 - is is less than 18
03:19 - i'll print
03:23 - sorry
03:25 - you are not
03:28 - eligible
03:29 - to vote
03:34 - now i'll run this code
03:37 - and i'll enter 15 again
03:40 - here you can see sorry you are not
03:42 - eligible to vote is printed this is
03:44 - because ace is 15 so this condition is
03:47 - is greater than or equals to 18 is false
03:50 - therefore the statement
03:53 - is
03:53 - skipped however this condition is is
03:56 - less than 18 is true so this statement
03:59 - is executed
04:01 - by the way if you are watching this
04:02 - there is a good chance you want to
04:04 - improve your skill in c programming
04:06 - lucky for you we have a mobile app that
04:08 - provides a well-structured c programming
04:10 - course with certification at the end and
04:13 - you can use the app alongside the video
04:15 - to practice on the built-in compiler our
04:17 - course is free so download now by
04:19 - scanning this qr code or click the link
04:21 - in the video description
04:25 - i have this code from the last segment
04:27 - i'll remove this code to get the user
04:30 - input
04:32 - and i'll manually assign the value of is
04:35 - equals to 15
04:36 - so that it's easier to focus on the
04:39 - logic of the if statement in this
04:42 - program i have used two if statement to
04:45 - perform two different tags
04:47 - we know that the person is eligible to
04:49 - vote only if the a's is greater than or
04:52 - equals to 18 and if the condition is not
04:55 - met we know that the person is not
04:57 - eligible to vote
04:59 - in such cases instead of writing the
05:02 - second if statement with the condition
05:05 - we can use else clause
05:07 - let's first look at the syntax of the if
05:10 - statement with the else clause
05:13 - on your screen you can see how it looks
05:16 - so what happens here is if our test
05:18 - condition is true
05:20 - statement inside the body of if
05:22 - statement is executed and if it is false
05:26 - statements inside the body of else are
05:30 - executed
05:31 - now getting back to our code to check if
05:33 - the person is eligible to vote or not
05:36 - in this program i'll use the else clause
05:39 - instead of this second if statement so
05:41 - i'll remove the second if statement and
05:44 - replace it with
05:45 - else
05:47 - now let me read this code in plain
05:48 - english as is greater than or equals to
05:51 - 18 then print you are eligible to vote
05:55 - else print sorry you are not eligible to
05:58 - vote now when i run this code
06:00 - you can see sorry you are not eligible
06:03 - to vote is printed
06:05 - this is because ace is 15 which is not
06:08 - greater than or equals to 18
06:11 - so we get the output sorry you are not
06:13 - eligible to vote
06:15 - okay guys we need your support to keep

06:28 - score high up so that more people can
06:30 - discover and enjoy these courses
06:34 - the if statement with else clause allow
06:37 - us to make a choice from two different
06:39 - options however sometimes we need to
06:42 - make choice from more than two options
06:45 - in those case we can use elsif's clause
06:48 - with test condition
06:49 - let's see the syntax first
06:52 - the if statement checks the first
06:54 - condition inside the if statement if it
06:57 - is true the body of if is executed and
07:00 - the statement 2
07:02 - and the statement 3 are skipped however
07:05 - if the first test condition is false the
07:09 - control of the program jumps to the
07:11 - second test condition
07:13 - if this condition is true the body of
07:16 - the else if statement is executed and
07:19 - other statement are skipped if both the
07:22 - test condition 1 and the test condition
07:25 - 2 are false
07:27 - then only the else body is executed
07:31 - if necessary we can add as many else if
07:33 - clauses as we want for our program to
07:36 - work and among all those alternatives
07:38 - only a single block of code is executed
07:41 - now we know how the else if clause works
07:44 - let's get back to our code to check
07:46 - whether a person can vote or not
07:49 - here the is variable stores the a's of
07:51 - the person currently the is of oldest
07:54 - person is 120 so i want this program to
07:57 - consider is greater than 120 as invalid
08:01 - similarly the a's cannot be negative so
08:04 - i also want to write less than 0 as
08:06 - invalid
08:07 - now i want to include this two
08:09 - additional condition in our program for
08:12 - that i'll use else if clause now i'll
08:15 - modify this code
08:16 - so
08:17 - if
08:19 - a's is
08:20 - greater than 1 and 20
08:23 - i'll print
08:27 - invalid is
08:29 - invalid
08:30 - is
08:37 - and
08:38 - as if
08:42 - so if a's is
08:44 - less than 0
08:46 - that is negative value then will print
08:50 - is
08:51 - invalid
08:52 - is
08:55 - i'll change this if to elsif
09:00 - so as you can see i have included one if
09:02 - condition
09:04 - two else if condition
09:06 - and finally one else condition
09:09 - here i'll change the value from 15 to
09:12 - 130
09:14 - now i'll run this code
09:16 - here the a's is greater than 120 so we
09:19 - get invalid is as our output
09:22 - now let's change the value of this is
09:25 - from 130 to minus 4 and let's run this
09:28 - again
09:29 - this time we get invalid is again
09:33 - so this is the condition of else if here
09:36 - is is less than zero so the output we
09:40 - got is invalid is
09:42 - now we can add as many else if condition
09:45 - as we want here we can see these two
09:48 - condition are performing the same tags
09:50 - printing the invalid is
09:53 - in this case we can combine both the
09:55 - condition together using logical
09:57 - operator
09:58 - here the a's is invalid if it is either
10:01 - greater than 120 or less than 0 or let
10:05 - me modify this code so i'll cut this
10:08 - i'll use logical r and put here
10:11 - is
10:12 - less than 0. so i'll change this value
10:15 - from -4 to -1 and when i run this code
10:20 - i get invalid is as output
10:24 - now as long as the a's is an integer
10:26 - number our program works correctly and
10:29 - the extra condition make sure the a's is
10:31 - neither greater than 120 or less than 0
10:35 - and for any other value of a's the
10:37 - program runs as intended if we provide
10:40 - the is equals to 50 so let's do that
10:43 - i'll provide the value of a is equals to
10:45 - 50 i'll run this
10:48 - now this person is eligible to vote
10:51 - before we end this video one quick tip
10:54 - for you if the body if else block has
10:56 - only one statement like this then we can
10:59 - omit the curly braces of the if block
11:02 - like this
11:03 - as you can see the syntax of the if
11:05 - statement is pretty simple the harder
11:08 - part is the logic behind the test
11:10 - conditions so you will get better at
11:13 - creating test condition with practice
11:15 - also be sure to check our video on the
11:18 - comparison and logical operators that
11:20 - are used to create the test condition
11:22 - the link will be in the video
11:24 - description below
11:28 - we have covered a lot in this video it's
11:31 - time for you to practice what we have
11:33 - learned here is one programming
11:34 - challenge for you to solve can you
11:36 - create a program to check whether a
11:38 - number is positive negative or zero to
11:42 - create this program create a variable
11:44 - named number and assign a double value
11:46 - to it based on the user input then using
11:49 - an if statement check if the number
11:51 - variable is positive negative or zero
11:55 - if the number is positive print the
11:57 - number is positive if the number is
11:59 - negative print the number is negative
12:01 - and if the number is 0 print the number
12:04 - is 0. you'll find all the answers to
12:06 - this question in our github repository
12:09 - and also if you want to revise the
12:10 - concept we'll learn today you can find
12:13 - all programs in the repository since the
12:15 - video is already long we are not
12:17 - covering the nested if else statement if
12:20 - you are interested you can learn about
12:22 - them from our website programmings.com
12:25 - i'll put the link in the video
12:26 - description
12:27 - now that we are at the end of this video
12:29 - it's time for programming squeeze
12:31 - what is the output of following code
12:36 - comment your answer below and see you on
12:38 - the next video happy programming
