00:00 - this python code will help you split
00:02 - these chocolates fairly among children
00:04 - suppose you have 17 chocolates and there
00:07 - are seven children now you have to
00:09 - divide them equally among seven children
00:11 - for that we compute the quotient value
00:14 - gained by dividing total number of
00:16 - chocolates by total number of children
00:18 - and after equal distribution we find
00:21 - remaining number of chocolates using
00:22 - remainder so now you can see each
00:25 - children will get two chocolates and
00:27 - there are three remaining after equal
00:29 - distribution
