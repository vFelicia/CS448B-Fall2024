00:00 - hey guys this is padma from programmies
00:02 - and welcome back to this series on c
00:04 - programming in this video we'll learn
00:05 - about the ternary operator which can be
00:07 - used to replace if else statement in
00:09 - certain situation to make our code look
00:11 - cleaner so let's get started
00:17 - let's start with syntax of turning
00:19 - operator
00:20 - on the screen you can see the basic
00:22 - structure of ternary operator the
00:24 - ternary operator starts with the test
00:26 - condition
00:27 - like x is less than 0 or name equals to
00:30 - podma or any other boolean expression
00:32 - that evaluates to true or false if this
00:35 - test condition results in true this
00:38 - first expression before the column is
00:40 - executed and if the test condition is
00:43 - false then the second expression after
00:45 - the colon is executed
00:47 - here you can see there are three
00:48 - operands hence the name ternary operator
00:54 - now you know the syntax of ternary
00:56 - operator let's see an example here you
00:58 - can see the basic c program now i'll
01:00 - create an in variable is and assign
01:03 - value 15 to this
01:06 - then i'll create a ternary operator with
01:08 - the condition
01:10 - is is greater than or equals to 18 and
01:13 - if this condition is true i'll print you
01:15 - can vote so
01:17 - printf inside quotation i'll put you can
01:20 - vote
01:25 - and if that condition is false i'll
01:28 - print
01:30 - you cannot vote
01:34 - so i'll end this statement with the
01:36 - semicolon
01:37 - now let me run this code as you can see
01:40 - you cannot vote is printed here is is
01:42 - equals to 15 so this condition becomes
01:45 - 15 is greater than or equal to 18 which
01:48 - is false so this print statement after
01:50 - the column is printed on the screen now
01:54 - let me change this value from 15 to 24
01:57 - now this condition becomes 24 is greater
02:00 - than or equals to 18 which is true so
02:02 - this print statement before the column
02:05 - should be executed now let's run this
02:07 - code as expected we get you can vote as
02:10 - output
02:11 - here we have used print statement as
02:14 - expression inside the ternary operator
02:16 - however we can also store value from
02:18 - ternary operator to a variable and use
02:20 - the variable later let's see an example
02:23 - i'll remove this line and create a care
02:25 - variable called operator
02:27 - and i'll i'll assign
02:29 - plus to this
02:32 - then i'll create an integer variable
02:35 - num1 and i'll assign a value a to this
02:38 - and i'll create another invariable
02:41 - end num2
02:42 - and i'll assign value
02:45 - 7 to this
02:47 - now i'll cut this turnit operator and
02:49 - start with a new condition and i'll
02:52 - check if operator
02:53 - is equals to
02:55 - plus
02:58 - and if this condition is true i'll add
03:01 - num1
03:03 - with num2
03:05 - and i'll add colon here
03:07 - and if this condition is false
03:10 - i'll subtract num2 from num1 so num1
03:13 - minus num2
03:18 - this expression are returning some value
03:20 - so i'll assign this ternary operator to
03:23 - a variable so say int result
03:29 - and i'll print this variable using
03:31 - printf statement
03:33 - printf inside quotation i'll use percent
03:37 - d format specifier and the name of the
03:39 - variable that is result
03:42 - i'll run this code and you can see we
03:44 - get 15 as output which is the sum of 8
03:47 - and 7.
03:49 - here the operator is equals to plus so
03:51 - this condition is true and addition is
03:54 - performed between num1 and num2
03:58 - depending upon your requirement you can
03:59 - either print values directly or assign
04:02 - value to a variable from a ternary
04:04 - operator however if you plan to use
04:06 - values later in the program it's a good
04:08 - idea to store value in a variable by the
04:11 - way if you are watching this there is a
04:13 - good chance you want to improve your
04:14 - skills in c programming lucky for you we
04:17 - have a mobile app that provides a
04:18 - well-structured c programming course
04:20 - with certification at the end and you
04:22 - can use the app alongside the video to
04:24 - practice on the built-in compiler our
04:26 - course is free so download now by
04:28 - scanning this qr code or click the link
04:31 - in the video description
04:34 - in some of the cases we can replace the
04:37 - if else statement with a ternary
04:38 - operator this will make our code cleaner
04:41 - and shorter let me show you an example
04:43 - on your screen you can see a program
04:45 - that checks if you can vote or not using
04:47 - the fl statement on the right and turn
04:50 - it operator on the left both the program
04:52 - are doing the same tags and checking if
04:54 - a person can vote or not and you can see
04:57 - the use of ternary operator has made our
04:59 - code cleaner and shorter in such
05:02 - programs where we need to do a single
05:04 - task inside the if else statement we can
05:06 - use the ternary operator in a place of
05:08 - if else however if there are multiple
05:11 - lines of code inside the if else
05:13 - statement we should never replace that
05:15 - with the ternary operator this will make
05:17 - our code more confusing and messy

05:40 - now to revise what we have learned here
05:42 - is one programming task for you to solve
05:44 - can you create a program to check
05:46 - whether a number is odd or even to
05:49 - create this program create a variable
05:51 - name number and assign a value to it
05:53 - then using a ternary operator check if
05:55 - the number variable is odd or even if
05:58 - the number is odd print the number is
06:00 - odd and if the number is even print the
06:03 - number is even
06:04 - you will find the answer to this
06:05 - question in our github repository also
06:08 - if you want to revise the concept you
06:09 - can find all this program there the link
06:12 - is in the video description
06:14 - now that we are at the end of this video
06:16 - it's time for programming squeeze what
06:18 - is the correct ternary equivalent of the
06:20 - following if-else statement
06:24 - comment your answer below see you on the
06:25 - next video happy programming
