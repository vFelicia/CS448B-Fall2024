00:00 - what's up guys i'm punit from
00:01 - programmers and welcome back to this
00:03 - series on python
00:05 - in the last two videos we learned how to
00:07 - repeat a block of code using loops
00:09 - the while loop repeats a block of code
00:11 - until the specified test condition is
00:13 - false and the for loop repeats a block
00:16 - of code
00:16 - until the last item in a sequence is
00:18 - reached
00:19 - sometimes we may need to end the loop
00:22 - without checking the test condition
00:24 - or skip execution of code inside the
00:26 - loop in such cases
00:27 - break and continue statements are used
00:31 - [Music]
00:36 - let's start with the break statement
00:38 - first i'll create a loop to print
00:40 - numbers from 1 to 5 to get started
00:42 - so i'll say 4 item in range 1 to 6
00:47 - and i'll print item and as you can see
00:50 - when i press run
00:51 - then 1 to 5 is printed now let me add a
00:54 - break statement here
00:56 - this time when i press run then only one
00:58 - is printed
00:59 - let's try to figure out what's happening
01:00 - here in the first iteration the item
01:04 - value is one one is printed
01:07 - and then the break statement is
01:09 - encountered as soon as we encounter the
01:11 - break statement
01:12 - we exit the loop now let me try
01:15 - something interesting
01:16 - i'll move this break statement before
01:18 - the print statement
01:19 - and this time when i press run
01:21 - absolutely nothing gets printed
01:22 - because the loop never reaches this
01:25 - print item
01:26 - statement the break statements
01:30 - are almost always used inside decision
01:32 - making statements like if and
01:33 - else because most of the time we may
01:36 - want to end the loop
01:37 - only when a certain condition is met let
01:40 - me show you this with a practical
01:41 - example
01:42 - i'll remove this code and i'll say if
01:47 - item equals equals 3
01:50 - then break otherwise print item
01:53 - and i also want to see find out when the
01:56 - loop is execute exited
01:58 - so i'll print outside the loop the end
02:02 - here we have a condition to break this
02:04 - loop when item
02:06 - is equal to 3 now when the item becomes
02:09 - 3
02:10 - the if condition is true and the break
02:12 - statement terminates the loop
02:14 - that's why 3 4 and 5 will not be printed
02:17 - this time
02:18 - let me run this code to show you this so
02:20 - when i run this code then 1 and 2 are
02:23 - printed
02:23 - and the end is printed
02:27 - let's create one more example of the
02:29 - break statement we will use a while loop
02:31 - to take a number
02:32 - input from the user if the user enters a
02:35 - positive number
02:36 - or zero we will print the number and
02:38 - again take another numeric input
02:40 - however if the user enters a negative
02:42 - number we will use the break statement
02:45 - and end the loop
02:46 - to approach this program first we will
02:48 - create a while loop with a test
02:50 - condition that's always true
02:52 - inside the loop we will take input from
02:54 - the user
02:55 - so i'll remove this old code and i'll
02:57 - say while
02:58 - true and i'll say number equals
03:02 - float input enter a number
03:06 - now this is an infinite while loop the
03:08 - only way to end this loop is by using
03:10 - the break statement
03:12 - now let's write our condition to print
03:13 - the number if it is positive and
03:15 - break the loop if it's negative so here
03:18 - i'll say if number
03:22 - less than 0 then break
03:26 - otherwise print u
03:30 - entered and here i'll print the number
03:34 - when i run this program then it says
03:36 - enter a number
03:37 - let me enter a positive number like 4
03:39 - and it says you entered 4.0
03:41 - and let me enter another positive number
03:44 - 67
03:45 - it says you entered 67 now let me try
03:48 - entering a number that's negative
03:50 - so i'll say minus 9 and when i press
03:52 - enter
03:53 - then it exited me from the loop and the
03:55 - program as well
03:58 - before moving to the next section of the
04:00 - video i'd like to mention that the
04:01 - program is team has created an app that
04:04 - allows you to learn python from your
04:05 - phone
04:06 - the app contains bit size lessons that
04:08 - are easy to understand
04:09 - a built-in interpreter so that you can
04:11 - run python on your phone
04:12 - quizzes and many more features the app
04:15 - is available on both ios and android
04:17 - the links are in the video description
04:18 - below
04:20 - let's talk about the continue statement
04:22 - in python now the continue statement in
04:25 - python
04:25 - skips the rest of the code inside the
04:27 - loop for that iteration
04:29 - the loop will not terminate but
04:31 - continues on with the next iteration
04:33 - let me explain this with the help of an
04:35 - example
04:36 - so i'll remove this old code and i'll
04:38 - say 4i in
04:39 - range 5 and then i'll say number
04:43 - equals float input
04:46 - enter a number
04:50 - then i'll print the number this program
04:53 - asked me for five numbers so i'll say 1
04:56 - 2
04:57 - 54 34 minus 76
05:01 - and something like 67 then it exited
05:04 - after five iterations
05:07 - what if you only want to print the
05:08 - positive numbers entered by the user
05:10 - and skip the printing of the negative
05:12 - numbers in such cases
05:14 - we can use the continue statement to
05:16 - skip code inside the loop
05:18 - if the user enters a negative number so
05:21 - here
05:21 - i'll add the continue statement like
05:23 - this i'll add the condition to check if
05:26 - the number is negative
05:27 - and continue the program without
05:29 - printing here so i'll say if
05:32 - number less than 0
05:35 - continue this time when i run the
05:38 - program
05:39 - then it asks me for an input i'll say 34
05:42 - it asks me for another input
05:43 - i'll say 56.5 or 7 and it
05:47 - prints the number and now if i enter a
05:49 - number like negative number like minus
05:51 - 87
05:53 - then it does not print the number it
05:56 - asks me for another number immediately
05:57 - this is because when this condition is
06:00 - true the continue statement takes me to
06:02 - the next iteration of the loop
06:03 - let me continue adding positive numbers
06:05 - so i'll say 23
06:07 - and then i'll add another negative
06:09 - number like minus 54
06:10 - and as you can see this whole loop still
06:13 - executed for five times
06:15 - but depending on whether i input a
06:17 - negative number or the positive number
06:19 - i was able to use the continue statement
06:21 - to either print the number
06:22 - or go directly to the next iteration
06:27 - before we end this video here's a little
06:29 - programming task for you
06:30 - suppose we have a list like this can you
06:33 - create a program
06:34 - so that all items of the languages list
06:37 - are printed
06:38 - except swift and c-plus plus you can
06:41 - find the answer to this question in our
06:42 - github repository
06:44 - also visit our website programmings.com
06:46 - for more tutorials and examples i've
06:48 - posted the link to both the github
06:50 - repository and our website in the
06:51 - description below
06:53 - let's recap the concepts we learnt in
06:55 - this video the break statement
06:57 - terminates the loop immediately when it
06:59 - is encountered
07:00 - the continue statement skips the code
07:02 - after it when it is encountered
07:05 - most of the time we want to change the
07:07 - way loops work
07:08 - only when a certain condition is met
07:10 - that's why we usually use break and
07:12 - continue
07:13 - inside the decision making statements
07:15 - like if and else
07:16 - that's it for this video i hope you
07:18 - learned something if you're just
07:19 - watching the video without writing any
07:21 - code
07:22 - i highly encourage you to try the
07:23 - programs in this video on your own
07:25 - the only way you can be a good
07:26 - programmer is by trying
07:28 - by the way you can find all the programs
07:30 - from this video on github
07:31 - i provided the link in the description
07:33 - below feel free to copy the program and
07:35 - edit them as you please
07:37 - and if you have any questions and
07:38 - feedback use the comment section below
07:41 - in the next video we will learn about
07:43 - the past statement
