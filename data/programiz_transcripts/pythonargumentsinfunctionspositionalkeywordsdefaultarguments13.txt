00:00 - what's up guys i'm punit from
00:01 - programmers and welcome back to this
00:03 - series on python
00:04 - in the last video we learned about
00:06 - functions we learned how to create
00:08 - functions and
00:08 - why they are used in that video we also
00:12 - learned to pass arguments to a function
00:14 - in this video we will learn about
00:16 - different ways we can use to pass
00:18 - arguments to a function
00:19 - so let's get started
00:31 - i have this program to add two numbers
00:33 - from the last video
00:34 - here we have called the add underscore
00:37 - numbers function
00:38 - with two arguments then our function
00:42 - adds those two numbers and returns the
00:44 - sum
00:45 - these arguments we pass to the function
00:47 - are called positional arguments
00:49 - because the first argument 5.4
00:52 - is assigned to the first parameter n1
00:55 - and the second parameter 6.7
00:57 - is assigned to the second parameter n2
01:00 - these
01:01 - arguments are passed based on their
01:03 - position now let me modify this program
01:06 - and remove this 6.7 from the function
01:08 - call
01:10 - can you guess what will happen let me
01:13 - run this code
01:17 - as you can see we get an error type
01:19 - error add underscore numbers
01:20 - missing one required positional argument
01:23 - n2
01:24 - this error message is telling us that we
01:26 - need to pass a second argument during
01:27 - the function call
01:29 - because our add underscore numbers
01:30 - function takes
01:32 - two arguments n1 and n2
01:35 - in such cases we can provide default
01:37 - values to parameters in the function
01:39 - definition
01:40 - which we will see next
01:44 - i still have this program from the last
01:46 - example which gave us an error
01:47 - it was because there is one argument in
01:49 - the function call
01:51 - but two arguments in the function
01:52 - definition to fix this issue
01:55 - either we can add a second parameter in
01:57 - the function call
01:58 - or we can provide a default value to the
02:00 - parameters
02:01 - let me provide default values to
02:03 - parameters in this program
02:05 - so i'll say n1 equals 100
02:08 - and i'll say n2 equals 1000
02:13 - now i've given 100 as the default value
02:15 - to n1
02:16 - and 1000 as the default value to n2 let
02:20 - me run the program again
02:22 - this time when i ran the program the
02:24 - output was thousand five point four
02:26 - what's happening here well what's
02:29 - happened here is
02:30 - we have provided 5.4 as an argument
02:34 - this value will be passed to n1
02:37 - however we haven't provided the second
02:39 - argument so the default value of
02:42 - n2 equals thousand will be used and the
02:45 - sum of five point four and thousand is
02:47 - thousand five point four
02:50 - let me modify this program again and
02:52 - this time i won't pass
02:53 - any arguments so i'll remove 5.4
02:57 - and in this case the default values of
03:00 - n1
03:00 - and n2 will be used as we are not
03:02 - passing any values
03:04 - let me run this code and as you can see
03:07 - we're getting 1100
03:08 - which is the sum of the default values
03:10 - 100 and thousand
03:13 - before moving to the next section of the
03:15 - video i'd like to mention that the
03:17 - is team has created an app that allows
03:19 - you to learn python from your phone
03:21 - the app contains bit size lessons that
03:23 - are easy to understand
03:24 - a built-in interpreter so that you can
03:26 - run python on your phone
03:27 - quizzes and many more features the app
03:30 - is available on both ios and android
03:32 - the links are in the video description
03:33 - below
03:39 - in python we cannot only pass arguments
03:41 - to function based on position
03:43 - but we can also pass arguments by name
03:46 - let me give you an example
03:47 - here we are passing jack to the name
03:50 - parameter and what's going on to the
03:52 - message parameter
03:53 - these are positional arguments now let
03:56 - me call this function again
03:58 - but this time i will pass arguments by
04:00 - name
04:02 - so i'll say greet message
04:05 - equals howdy and i'll say name
04:10 - equals jill during this second function
04:14 - call we have specified the arguments by
04:17 - name
04:18 - so howdy is passed to the message
04:21 - parameter
04:22 - and jill is passed to the name parameter
04:25 - the order of the arguments doesn't
04:27 - matter here because we are using name to
04:29 - specify which argument is passed where
04:32 - these arguments are called keyword
04:34 - arguments
04:35 - there are a couple of things we haven't
04:37 - mentioned about arguments in this video
04:39 - for simplicity
04:40 - if you are interested to learn more
04:41 - about arguments visit our website
04:43 - programmers.com i've posted the link in
04:45 - the description below
04:46 - now let me recap the concepts we learned
04:48 - in this video when we pass
04:50 - arguments to a function without
04:51 - specifying the name
04:53 - the arguments in the function call is
04:55 - assigned to parameters in the function
04:57 - definition
04:57 - based on the position that means that
05:00 - the first argument is assigned to the
05:01 - first parameter
05:02 - and the second argument is assigned to
05:04 - the second parameter and so on
05:07 - these are called positional arguments
05:09 - you can also give names to arguments
05:11 - during a function call
05:13 - these arguments are called keyword
05:15 - arguments the order of arguments doesn't
05:17 - matter when we use keyword arguments
05:20 - we can provide default values to
05:21 - parameters in the function definition
05:24 - these values will be used if we do not
05:26 - pass arguments during the function call
05:28 - that's it for this video i hope you
05:30 - learned something if you're just
05:31 - watching the video without writing any
05:33 - code
05:33 - i highly encourage you to try the
05:35 - programs in this video on your own
05:37 - the only way you can be a good
05:38 - programmer is by trying
05:40 - by the way you can find all the programs
05:42 - from this video on github i provided the
05:44 - link in the description below
05:46 - feel free to copy the programs there and
05:48 - edit them as you please
05:49 - and if you have any questions and
05:51 - feedback use the comment section below
05:54 - in the next video we will talk about
05:55 - local and global variables in python
05:58 - join me in this video series and let's
06:00 - explore the exciting world of
06:01 - programming together
