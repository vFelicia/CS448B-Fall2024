00:14 - javascript from the very basic to
00:16 - advanced concepts and by the end you
00:18 - will have a good understanding of js and
00:20 - be ready to create awesome javascript
00:22 - projects so without further ado let's
00:24 - get started
00:29 - in this video we will learn what
00:31 - javascript is and why it is used then we
00:34 - will write our very first javascript
00:36 - program
00:37 - let's get started with what javascript
00:39 - is
00:39 - javascript is one of the most popular
00:41 - and dynamic programming languages out
00:43 - there
00:44 - in earlier times about a decade or so
00:46 - ago javascript was primarily used to add
00:49 - interactivity to web pages like form
00:51 - validation or showing a pop-up on web
00:53 - pages however the language has evolved a
00:56 - lot in the past decade nowadays we can
00:58 - create powerful dynamic and full-fledged
01:01 - web applications using only javascript
01:03 - and its frameworks such as node react
01:06 - view and many more javascript is also
01:08 - used to create mobile apps using the
01:10 - react native framework which allows us
01:12 - to create both android and ios apps from
01:14 - the same code base
01:16 - that's why big companies such as google
01:18 - apple microsoft netflix and many others
01:21 - use javascript to create many of their
01:23 - products but it's also used by thousands
01:26 - and thousands and thousands of small
01:27 - companies as well so learning javascript
01:30 - has a lot of advantages you could work
01:32 - as a web developer front-end back-end or
01:35 - mobile developer and if you have some
01:36 - great ideas you can use javascript to
01:38 - build your own mobile and web
01:40 - applications
01:44 - before we learn to write our very first
01:45 - program our computer needs to install a
01:48 - program called node.js and a text editor
01:50 - to edit the code now since you're a
01:52 - beginner to make this process easier we
01:55 - have created an online tool that lets
01:57 - you run javascript code on the browser
01:58 - without installing anything at all to
02:01 - access our online javascript editor you
02:03 - have to open your browser and go to this
02:05 - url www www.programmis.com
02:10 - slash
02:11 - javascript j a v a s c r i p t slash
02:16 - online dash
02:17 - compiler i'll repeat that it's w
02:21 - programming
02:23 - javascript slash online dash compiler
02:27 - i'll also put it in the video
02:28 - description below so that you don't get
02:30 - confused and now when i press enter it's
02:33 - open it opens up my compiler and now i
02:35 - can start writing javascript code now
02:38 - that my code editor is open we will
02:40 - write our javascript code in this area
02:42 - and when i hit run it will execute the
02:44 - code and show the output in this area
02:48 - let me write a simple program called
02:49 - hello world to test it out if you don't
02:52 - know a hello world is a simple program
02:54 - that displays hello world on the screen
02:57 - since it's a very simple program it is
02:59 - often used to introduce a new
03:00 - programming language to beginners
03:02 - to create a program that prints hello
03:04 - world i simply type
03:06 - console
03:07 - dot log
03:09 - followed by parenthesis
03:11 - and inside the parenthesis i will type
03:14 - hello
03:15 - world enclosed within quotation marks
03:19 - now to run this code
03:21 - i will simply click the run button
03:24 - as you can see hello world is printed on
03:27 - the screen
