00:00 - hey guys this is me pablo from
00:01 - programmies and welcome back to this
00:03 - series on c programming in this video
00:05 - we'll learn about enums in c programming
00:08 - we'll also learn to create variables of
00:10 - enum types and use them in our program
00:12 - so let's get started
00:17 - in c programming an enum is a type that
00:20 - has a fixed set of values let's see an
00:22 - example here we have used the enum
00:25 - keyword to create the enum named size
00:28 - this enum contains four fixed values
00:30 - small medium large and extra large these
00:34 - are called enum constant now let's
00:37 - create enum variables from the above
00:39 - enum so i'll create
00:43 - enum size
00:46 - suit size
00:51 - your suit size is an enum type variable
00:54 - this variable can now store one of the
00:57 - four values present in the enum size
01:00 - so basically the value of suicides can
01:03 - be of either small
01:05 - so i'll assign this here
01:08 - suicides can be
01:10 - small
01:13 - or this can be medium so
01:17 - medium
01:19 - or this can be
01:21 - large
01:23 - or
01:24 - it can be
01:26 - extra large
01:28 - now let's complete this example and run
01:30 - the code but before that let's first
01:33 - quickly learn about integral constant
01:38 - in c all enum constant are internally
01:40 - represented as fixed integer values
01:43 - known as integral constant if we
01:45 - consider our earlier enum
01:47 - the constant small is internally
01:49 - represented as 0 and similarly medium
01:53 - lars and extra layers are represented as
01:55 - 1 2 and 3 respectively
01:58 - let's verify this i'll go back to my
02:00 - code editor here you can see the code
02:02 - from our earlier program now i'll
02:05 - complete this program so i'll add here
02:07 - has include
02:10 - stdio.h
02:13 - and here i'll add
02:16 - int min
02:19 - and inside the curly braces
02:21 - return
02:23 - zero
02:24 - and i'll cut this
02:27 - and i'll put it here
02:31 - so
02:33 - yeah
02:35 - i'll now print this using printf
02:36 - statement
02:38 - and here person d
02:40 - comma
02:42 - su size
02:43 - as we know enum constant are integer
02:46 - values internally so i have used this
02:49 - for person d format specifier
02:52 - now i'll run this
02:53 - as you can see we get three as an output
02:56 - because internally the value of extra
02:58 - large is three
03:00 - now i'll change the value of suicides
03:03 - from extra large to small
03:06 - and
03:07 - and i'll run this again
03:10 - this time we get the output zero
03:13 - by the way do you want to take your
03:15 - programming journey to the next level
03:17 - watching tutorials is fine but it has
03:19 - one limitation it's hard to learn and
03:21 - practice together at the same time lucky
03:23 - for you we recently launched programmies
03:25 - pro that provides tutorials along with
03:27 - quizzes and challenges which will help
03:30 - you practice and test your learning in
03:31 - real time also the course includes
03:34 - projects to give you an experience of
03:36 - how programming works in the real world
03:38 - sign up now visit the link which is also
03:40 - available in the video description below
03:44 - as we saw in our earlier example the
03:46 - default integral values of enum constant
03:49 - starts from 0 so we get value 0 1 2 and
03:53 - 3 for enum constant small medium large
03:56 - and extra large however sometimes it
03:58 - might be necessary to print other values
04:01 - for example the value 0 1 2 and 3 for
04:04 - sizes small medium large and extra large
04:07 - does not make sense instead we might
04:10 - want to print 27 for small 31 for medium
04:14 - 35 for lars and 40 for extra
04:17 - extra lars in such situation we can
04:19 - change the value of integral constant
04:22 - let me show you how i'll go back to my
04:24 - code editor here you can see the
04:26 - code from our earlier example
04:29 - now i'll assign new value
04:31 - to this enum constant so
04:34 - small is equals to 27
04:37 - and medium is equals to
04:40 - 31
04:41 - lars
04:42 - is equals to 35
04:45 - and extra large is equals to 40.
04:49 - now let's create some more variables as
04:51 - well first i'll cut this line of code
04:56 - and
04:57 - now i'll
04:58 - modify this
05:00 - and write here suicides 1
05:03 - is equals to
05:05 - small
05:07 - and similarly i'll write
05:09 - enum
05:11 - size
05:13 - so size
05:15 - 2 is equals to
05:17 - medium
05:20 - and for large and extra layers i'll copy
05:22 - this too
05:24 - and i'll paste it here
05:27 - and i'll change this to size 3
05:30 - and i'll write here
05:33 - large
05:35 - end
05:36 - so size 4
05:40 - is extra large so extra
05:43 - large
05:46 - then i'll print this
05:50 - for that i'll use the same code from our
05:54 - earlier program and i'll copy this and
05:56 - i'll paste it three more times i'll
05:59 - change this
06:02 - from suicides to
06:04 - size 3
06:06 - and this is
06:07 - so size 4.
06:10 - now let me run this code
06:15 - as you can see we get 27 31 35 and 40
06:19 - for the enum constant small medium large
06:22 - and extra large now we are to at the end
06:25 - of this video but before ending the
06:27 - video let me give you a small tip we
06:29 - have been using this format to create
06:32 - enum variable however we can also create
06:35 - enum variables while defining the enum
06:38 - let me show you here suicides is an enum
06:40 - variable and like before it can only
06:43 - store four values
06:45 - now let me run this code
06:47 - now this time we get the expected output
06:51 - okay guys we need your support to keep

07:06 - courses
07:10 - now to revise what you have learned in
07:11 - this program here is a programming task
07:13 - for you create an enum with enum
07:15 - constant sunday monday tuesday wednesday
07:18 - thursday friday and saturday
07:21 - inside the main function create two enum
07:23 - variables named weekend one and weekend
07:25 - two assign values sunday saturday to the
07:28 - variables respectively print the values
07:30 - of the week in one and weekend two
07:32 - you'll find the answer to this question
07:34 - in our github repository and also if you
07:36 - want to revise this concept all this
07:39 - program will be there as well i'll put
07:41 - the link in the video description below
07:43 - now that we have reached the end of this
07:44 - video it's time for programming squeeze
07:47 - what is the name of the variable in the
07:49 - following enum
07:51 - comment your answer below see you in the
07:53 - next video happy programming
07:59 - [Music]
08:04 - you
