00:00 - what's up guys i'm puneet from
00:01 - programmers and welcome back to the
00:03 - series on python
00:05 - in the previous videos we learned about
00:07 - textual data and numbers
00:09 - now we will learn to perform operations
00:11 - on this data
00:12 - using something called operators more
00:15 - specifically we will focus on
00:16 - arithmetic operations like addition
00:19 - subtraction
00:20 - etc in this video
00:22 - [Music]
00:27 - in programming an operator is a symbol
00:30 - that is used to perform
00:32 - operations on values and variables we've
00:35 - already used the equals operator in our
00:36 - previous videos
00:38 - so we've been saying stuff like name
00:40 - equals punit
00:41 - here the equals operator takes the value
00:44 - on the right
00:45 - and stores it in the variable on the
00:47 - left we'll get back to more assignment
00:50 - operators in a second
00:51 - let's start with arithmetic operators
00:53 - first we use arithmetic operators to
00:55 - perform arithmetic operations
00:57 - such as addition subtraction
00:59 - multiplication etc
01:01 - i'll copy a list of arithmetic operators
01:03 - here in my text editor
01:04 - so that it's a bit easy for us to use
01:07 - them
01:08 - let's try these operators one by one
01:10 - i'll start with the plus
01:12 - operator so i'll say something like x
01:14 - equals 5
01:15 - and then i can say result equals x plus
01:20 - 10 and then i can print the result here
01:24 - i'll run this code and as you can see 15
01:27 - is printed
01:28 - what's happening here is 10 and the
01:30 - value of x which is 5
01:32 - are being added by the addition operator
01:35 - and the equals to operator is storing
01:37 - the result of these in the result
01:38 - variable
01:39 - on line 12 when i print the result
01:41 - because its value is 5 plus 10 or 15
01:44 - that's what was printed instead of
01:46 - storing the result of adding 10
01:48 - and x to the result variable we can also
01:51 - directly print the result like this
01:53 - so i can copy this and i can paste it
01:56 - here
01:57 - i'll remove the result variable for now
01:59 - and when i press run
02:00 - i get the same result because the
02:02 - addition operator still
02:03 - takes the value of x and 10 and adds
02:06 - them up
02:07 - and that's what's get printed by the
02:08 - print function but personally
02:11 - i think using a variable to store the
02:12 - result looks a bit cleaner than this
02:14 - so i'll revert back to the old code
02:20 - before moving to the next section of the
02:21 - video i'd like to mention that the
02:23 - program is team has created an
02:24 - app that allows you to learn python from
02:26 - your phone the app contains bit size
02:28 - lessons that are easy to understand
02:30 - a built-in interpreter so that you can
02:32 - run python on your phone
02:34 - quizzes and many more features the app
02:36 - is available on both ios and android the
02:38 - links are in the video description below
02:41 - we have learned to perform the addition
02:43 - operator at this point
02:45 - now let's try all these operators one by
02:47 - one
02:48 - let me change plus to minus and run this
02:53 - as you can see minus 5 is printed
02:56 - because
02:56 - 5 minus 10 is minus 5.
03:00 - in python we use the asterisk symbol for
03:02 - multiplication
03:04 - so i'll replace this minus by asterisk
03:07 - and when i press run then 5 times 10
03:10 - 50 is printed similarly the forward
03:13 - slash is used for division
03:15 - so i'll replace this asterisk by slash
03:18 - and when i press run
03:19 - then 5 divided by 10 or 0.5
03:23 - is stored in the result variable and
03:25 - that's what got printed here
03:27 - the symbols of these four operators
03:29 - addition subtraction
03:31 - multiplication and division are similar
03:33 - to symbols in mathematics
03:35 - let's try three more arithmetic
03:37 - operators the single asterisk
03:39 - is used for multiplication but if we use
03:42 - two asterisks
03:43 - without any space in between it's an
03:45 - exponent operator
03:47 - so i'll replace this slash with 2
03:49 - asterisk
03:50 - and when i press run i'll remove this 10
03:52 - and i'll make it 2
03:54 - and when i press run then as you can see
03:56 - 25 is stored in the result
03:58 - because 5 raised to the power 2
04:01 - or 5 times 5 is 25
04:05 - the last two arithmetic operators are
04:07 - percent and two forward slashes
04:09 - using two forward slashes computes the
04:12 - quotient when one number is divided by
04:14 - another
04:15 - similarly the percent symbol computes
04:18 - the remainder when one number is divided
04:19 - by another
04:20 - let me give you an example so here i'll
04:23 - replace this
04:24 - result and i'll say quotient equals
04:28 - x double slash 2 and then i can say
04:32 - remainder equals x modulus 2
04:37 - so the modulus this sign when used to
04:39 - calculate the remainder is called
04:41 - modulus
04:42 - and then i can say quotient
04:46 - is quotient
04:49 - and remainder
04:52 - is remainder when i press
04:56 - run then it says quotient is 2 and
04:58 - remainder is 1
05:00 - that is because when 5 is divided by 2
05:03 - the quotient is 2 obviously because 2
05:05 - times 2 is 4
05:07 - and the remainder 1 is stored in the
05:08 - remainder variable
05:12 - at this point we have covered everything
05:14 - we need to know about arithmetic
05:15 - operators
05:16 - when they are used with numbers before
05:19 - ending this section
05:20 - i have a pro tip for you we use a lot of
05:22 - operators in a single statement like
05:24 - this
05:25 - it's harder to understand which
05:27 - operation is performed first
05:29 - in this statement to avoid this
05:32 - we can use parenthesis so i can wrap
05:35 - these
05:36 - by parentheses
05:40 - like this and now
05:43 - it's so much easier to understand
05:48 - in the last section we use the plus
05:50 - operator to add two numbers
05:52 - the plus operator also serves another
05:54 - purpose in python
05:56 - it is used to join two strings let me
05:58 - give you an example
06:00 - so i'll remove this whole code and i say
06:01 - str1
06:03 - equals hey and i'll say str2
06:07 - equals jude and then i can print
06:11 - the concatenation of hey and jude like
06:13 - this
06:14 - when i press run then hey jude is
06:16 - printed
06:17 - it's working but let me add a space
06:20 - between hey and jude
06:21 - for that i can add a space at the end of
06:25 - hey
06:25 - and when i press run then as you can see
06:27 - there's a space now
06:32 - we have already used the most common
06:34 - assignment operator
06:35 - equals which is used to assign the value
06:38 - on the right
06:39 - to the variable on the left in python
06:42 - you can also do something like this
06:44 - so i can say x comma y equals
06:47 - 5 comma 6 here
06:50 - 5 is assigned to the x variable and 6
06:54 - is assigned to the y variable in one
06:57 - statement
06:58 - so this code is equivalent to x equals
07:01 - five
07:02 - y equals six personally
07:05 - i i feel this later syntax of x equals
07:08 - five and y equals to six is better
07:10 - because it makes the code easier to read
07:12 - there are also some compound assignment
07:14 - operators in python
07:16 - these compound assignment operators
07:18 - combine arithmetic and assignment
07:20 - operators in one single place
07:22 - i'll show you an example so i'll remove
07:24 - this old code and i can say x equals
07:26 - 5 and i'll say x plus equals
07:30 - 10 and i'll also say x minus
07:34 - equals 10. this
07:38 - x plus equals 10 is equivalent to
07:41 - x equals to x plus 10
07:44 - this plus equals to operator is called
07:47 - the addition
07:48 - assignment operator because it first
07:50 - performs the addition
07:52 - then performs the assignment similarly
07:54 - the x minus
07:56 - equal 10 is equivalent to
07:59 - x equals x minus 10.
08:05 - these compound assignment operators are
08:07 - available with all arithmetic operators
08:10 - there are also other numerous operators
08:11 - in python which we will learn about as
08:14 - we progress further in the video series
08:15 - if you are curious you can visit our
08:17 - website programmers.com
08:19 - for more information on python operators
08:21 - along with numerous examples
08:23 - the link will be in the description
08:24 - below let's put the things we have
08:26 - learned in this video in action
08:32 - suppose you're a university student and
08:34 - you need to pay 4535 dollars tuition fee
08:38 - for the next semester the college
08:40 - is giving you a discount of 10 percent
08:42 - on early payment of your tuition fee
08:45 - since it's a very good offer you decided
08:47 - to make an early payment
08:49 - now can you find out how much money you
08:51 - have to pay
08:52 - i'll store the fee in a variable called
08:54 - fee so i'll say fee
08:55 - equals 4535
08:59 - now my discount percentage will also go
09:02 - in a variable called discount percent
09:04 - and from here i can calculate the
09:06 - discount amount
09:08 - as discount
09:11 - percent by 100
09:14 - i'll add parenthesis to form clarity
09:18 - times the fee
09:21 - this should be discount amount and then
09:23 - i can say
09:24 - discounted underscore fee equals
09:27 - fee minus discount
09:32 - amount now let me print the discount
09:34 - amount so i can say print
09:36 - fee after discount is
09:40 - discounted underscore fee and when i
09:42 - press run then ik i get the correct
09:44 - value of the fee
09:45 - after discount
09:48 - now it's time for you to solve a problem
09:51 - can you create a program to convert
09:52 - distance
09:53 - in kilometers to miles suppose you have
09:56 - a distance in kilometers
09:57 - stored in a variable like this so i can
10:00 - say
10:00 - distance underscore km equals
10:05 - 564.5
10:08 - you need to convert this distance to
10:10 - miles using the formula
10:12 - one kilometer
10:15 - equals 0.621371 miles
10:24 - you will find the answer to this
10:26 - question in our github repository
10:28 - i'll also put this link in the
10:29 - description below before we end this
10:31 - video
10:32 - here's a recap of what we learned today
10:34 - the most common assignment operator is
10:36 - the equals operator
10:38 - it is used to assign the value in the
10:40 - right to the variable on the left
10:42 - we use arithmetic operators to perform
10:45 - basic arithmetic
10:46 - operations such as addition subtraction
10:48 - etc
10:50 - if you use the plus operator with
10:52 - numbers it adds two numbers
10:54 - however if you use the plus operator
10:56 - with strings it joins two strings
11:00 - if you use multiple operators in an
11:02 - expression we can use parenthesis to
11:04 - make our code
11:05 - readable that's it for this video
11:08 - i hope you learned something if you're
11:10 - just watching the video without writing
11:11 - any code
11:12 - i highly encourage you to try the
11:14 - programs in this video on your own
