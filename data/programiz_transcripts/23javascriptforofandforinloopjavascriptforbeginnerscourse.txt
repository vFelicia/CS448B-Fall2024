00:00 - what's up guys i'm punishment
00:01 - programmers and welcome back to this
00:02 - series on javascript in this video we
00:05 - will learn about the ways to loop over a
00:07 - list of items and also how to loop over
00:09 - an object we will talk about the for off
00:11 - loop and the for in loop so let's get
00:14 - started
00:18 - the for off loop was introduced in the
00:20 - es6 version of javascript it allows us
00:22 - to iterate over iterable objects such as
00:25 - arrays strings sets etc
00:28 - let's first look at the syntax of the
00:29 - far off loop the for off loop starts
00:32 - with a four and a parenthesis
00:34 - inside the parenthesis iterable is the
00:37 - iterable or array or string or whatever
00:39 - you want to iterate through an element
00:41 - is a variable that will store the
00:43 - current item that we are dealing with in
00:45 - those iterable
00:46 - for example suppose we have an array of
00:49 - numbers
00:50 - so i'll create an array say const
00:54 - numbers
00:55 - equals
00:56 - 1 3 five and seven
00:59 - now in a for off loop the iterable will
01:01 - be numbers
01:04 - and element i can keep it as element but
01:07 - i'll need to add a const here because
01:09 - element has not been declared before
01:11 - now in each iteration of the far-off
01:13 - loop element will contain the current
01:17 - item so it will start from 1 and 3 and 5
01:20 - and so on
01:22 - let's see this in action
01:23 - so i'll remove this and let me print the
01:26 - current value of element to verify that
01:28 - at it indeed contains
01:31 - the item
01:33 - 1 3 5 and 7. so let me press run
01:37 - and you can see that element did contain
01:39 - one in the first iteration three in the
01:41 - second iteration and so on
01:43 - let's see one more example to drive home
01:45 - this point suppose we have an array that
01:48 - contains the names of family members and
01:50 - we want to access those names however
01:53 - while accessing those names we also want
01:55 - to add the surnames to each of those
01:57 - names
01:58 - in this case we can use the for off loop
02:00 - to access each of the names and inside
02:03 - the loop we can join the surname and
02:04 - print the final name let's see a working
02:07 - example let me remove this old code
02:09 - first and let's create an array of names
02:12 - so i can say const
02:15 - members
02:16 - equals
02:20 - john
02:21 - sarah
02:23 - and jack
02:25 - now i'll create a for off loop to
02:27 - iterate over those names
02:29 - so i'll say for
02:31 - const name of
02:33 - members
02:35 - and you can see that this almost reads
02:36 - like english now so inside the loop i'll
02:39 - add the surname smith to each of those
02:41 - names and print the full name i'll also
02:43 - need to add a space between the first
02:45 - name and the last name so i'll say let
02:48 - full name equals
02:50 - name
02:51 - which will contain john sarah and jack
02:53 - respectively and plus
02:55 - and a space
02:58 - and this
03:00 - last name which is smith
03:02 - and let me console log full name to just
03:04 - make sure that this works as intended
03:07 - now when i press run
03:10 - you can see that i was able to add smith
03:13 - to each of these names respectively
03:19 - we can also use the for off loop with
03:21 - strings with strings the for off loop
03:23 - will iterate over each character of the
03:24 - string so let's see an example i'll
03:27 - create a string first let me get rid of
03:29 - this old code let me create a string
03:31 - called name
03:33 - equals
03:34 - program is
03:35 - and now
03:36 - let's see what happens when i use the
03:38 - for off loop on it so let i
03:41 - of
03:42 - name
03:44 - and let's see when i console log i
03:48 - what happens
03:49 - you can see that the value of i was p in
03:51 - the first iteration r in the second
03:53 - iteration o in the third iteration and
03:55 - so on
03:56 - that means the for off loop when used
03:58 - with a string gives me each character
04:00 - one by one

04:26 - the foreign loop is used to iterate
04:28 - through the element of an object before
04:30 - we learn about far in let's first revise
04:32 - the concept of an object in javascript
04:34 - we use objects to store multiple data
04:36 - together for example if you want to
04:38 - store information about a student you
04:40 - can use an object like this so i'll go
04:42 - back to my code editor and say const
04:45 - student equals
04:47 - and you can see i've used curly braces
04:49 - and inside here i can say name
04:51 - colon
04:52 - monica
04:55 - grade
04:57 - 7
04:58 - and
04:59 - age
05:00 - 12.
05:01 - data is stored in an object in key value
05:03 - pairs here
05:04 - name grade and age are the keys and
05:08 - monica 7 and 12 are the corresponding
05:11 - values let me quickly print this object
05:14 - and show you the output so i'll say
05:16 - console.log
05:18 - student
05:20 - and press run and you can see that i got
05:22 - the object as output
05:24 - now that we know about objects again
05:26 - let's start with the syntax of the for
05:28 - in loop
05:29 - the for in loop starts with the four
05:31 - keyword followed by parenthesis
05:33 - inside the parenthesis object represents
05:36 - the javascript object that we want to
05:38 - iterate through or we want to get the
05:39 - keys off and key represents each key of
05:42 - the object one by one let's see an
05:45 - example here we have an object from our
05:47 - earlier code now i'll use the for in
05:50 - loop to iterate over the elements of
05:51 - this object so instead of object i will
05:54 - have student
05:56 - and let me do const because key has not
05:58 - been declared before now in each
06:00 - iteration of the loop the variable key
06:02 - will specify the key of the student
06:04 - object so the first iteration the key
06:06 - will be named for the second it will be
06:08 - grade and for the third it will be age
06:11 - let's verify that
06:13 - i'll say console log key
06:15 - and when i press run
06:17 - you can see that i got name grade and
06:19 - age which were the three keys here
06:22 - now that we've successfully accessed all
06:23 - the keys of the object we can also get
06:25 - the individual values let me modify this
06:28 - code i'll first access each value using
06:30 - the key and then print key and value
06:32 - using the template string
06:34 - so let me remove this and say const
06:37 - value equals
06:39 - student
06:41 - key
06:42 - and i can say console.log for template
06:46 - string i'll use backtick and then dollar
06:50 - key because i want to print the key
06:51 - variable and let me print a fancy sign
06:54 - like this
06:55 - and let me say dollar value inside curly
06:59 - braces
07:01 - now when i press run you must have
07:04 - guessed the output by now
07:05 - i get the keys and the values
07:07 - respectively
07:09 - now the student key is the magic here
07:11 - because key contains
07:13 - name
07:14 - so student
07:16 - name becomes monica in the first
07:18 - iteration similarly in the second
07:20 - iteration key contains grade so student
07:24 - grade becomes 7 and in the last
07:26 - iteration because key is age so student
07:31 - and inside the square brackets we have
07:33 - age so student age gives me 12.

07:50 - courses
07:55 - we can also change the values of an
07:57 - object using the for in loop let me give
07:59 - you a quick example
08:00 - suppose we have an object of employees
08:02 - that contains the name of employees as
08:04 - keys and their corresponding salaries as
08:06 - values now let's assume that the
08:08 - employees are doing a great job and the
08:09 - employer wants to provide a bonus of
08:11 - 5000 to each of these employees
08:13 - in this case we can use the for in loop
08:16 - to access the salary of each employee
08:18 - add the bonus to it and print it let's
08:20 - do exactly that so i'll start a for in
08:23 - loop like before
08:26 - like this employee
08:29 - and now let me get the salary first so
08:32 - let salary
08:34 - equals
08:35 - employee i the same pattern we had used
08:38 - last time
08:39 - and let me add 5000 to it
08:42 - now let me test my code so i'll say
08:45 - console.log
08:46 - let me again use template literals like
08:48 - before so dollar i will contain the name
08:52 - similarly the salary will be stored in
08:56 - the salary variable the new one
08:58 - and this should do it here
09:01 - i will represent each of the names which
09:04 - will be jack paul and monica which are
09:06 - the keys of this object and employee i
09:09 - will give me the values which are twenty
09:11 - four thousand thirty four thousand and
09:12 - fifty five thousand in each iteration i
09:14 - will i am adding five thousand to the
09:16 - salary and then printing the new salary
09:20 - let me run this code and see what
09:21 - happens
09:23 - you can see that 24 000 become 29 000
09:26 - and so on
09:29 - now to practice what we've learned
09:30 - here's a programming task for you create
09:32 - an array named names with values jack
09:35 - rosie and mira
09:37 - now use a for off loop to print each
09:39 - name of the array however while printing
09:42 - the name change the first character to
09:44 - uppercase to change the first character
09:46 - to uppercase let me give you a little
09:48 - hint so you can use the carat method
09:50 - with zero as a parameter to get the
09:52 - first character and you can convert it
09:54 - to uppercase using two uppercase method
09:57 - now you can use the slice method of the
09:59 - array to get
10:01 - the rest of the characters except the
10:03 - first character so you can use something
10:05 - like slice one
10:06 - and then you can join the rest of the
10:08 - characters to the first character to get
10:10 - the new name
10:11 - and then obviously you can print it
10:12 - using console.log you'll find the
10:14 - correct answer to this question in a
10:15 - github repository also if you want to
10:18 - revise these concepts you can find all
10:19 - these programs there as well i'll put
