00:00 - hey guys this is me padma from
00:01 - programmers and welcome back to this
00:03 - series on c programming in this video
00:05 - we'll learn about variable scope more
00:07 - specifically we'll learn about local and
00:09 - global variable scope in c programming
00:12 - so let's get started
00:17 - in programming a scope is a particular
00:19 - reason in a program and a variable scope
00:21 - determines which variable can be
00:23 - accessed from which region of a program
00:26 - in c programming there are two basic
00:28 - types of variable scopes they are local
00:30 - variable scope and global variable scope
00:33 - let's start with the local scope first
00:38 - to understand the local scope let's see
00:40 - an example of a c function
00:43 - in my code editor you can see function
00:45 - add numbers this function takes two
00:48 - parameters and it stores the sum in the
00:51 - result variable and it prints the result
00:54 - inside the function
00:56 - instead of printing the result inside
00:58 - the add number function let's print it
01:00 - after the function call
01:02 - so i'll paste it here
01:05 - so i have moved this line from the add
01:07 - number function to this main function i
01:10 - will run this code you can see we get an
01:12 - error saying result on declared this is
01:15 - saying the result is appeared for the
01:18 - first time in the line 11.
01:21 - you might be wondering how is that
01:23 - possible even though we have declared
01:25 - the result variable here inside the
01:27 - function well this is where the concept
01:29 - of local variables comes in any variable
01:32 - that is declared inside the function is
01:34 - a local to it
01:36 - meaning the result variable is local to
01:39 - the add number function this reason is
01:41 - called localscope and the result
01:43 - variable has no existence outside this
01:46 - group when the function ends the local
01:48 - variable are destroyed this is why we
01:51 - get an error when we try to use the
01:53 - result variable outside the local scope
01:56 - now if you remember we can solve this
01:58 - problem by returning result from the add
02:00 - number function so i'll add return
02:04 - result
02:06 - and i'll change this void to end
02:11 - since the function now returns a value i
02:14 - will now assign this function
02:16 - to a variable sum
02:19 - and then i'll print
02:21 - the sum
02:22 - so i'll run this code you can see the
02:25 - result is equals to 11 which is
02:28 - 5 plus 6.
02:31 - with the return statement we are not
02:33 - using the local variables directly
02:35 - rather we are returning its value to the
02:37 - function call and assigning it to
02:39 - another variable inside the main
02:41 - function this concept of local variable
02:44 - is a good thing because anyone using
02:46 - this add number function does not need
02:48 - to know what's inside it they just need
02:50 - to know what argument to pass and what
02:52 - value it returns and they can use this
02:54 - function without a problem this makes
02:57 - our code reusable to not only us but
03:00 - also to our fellow programmers
03:02 - by the way if you are watching this
03:04 - there is a good chance you want to
03:06 - improve your skills in c programming
03:08 - lucky for you we have a mobile app that
03:10 - provides a well-structured c programming
03:12 - course with certification at the end and
03:15 - you can use the app alongside the video
03:17 - to practice on the built-in compiler our
03:19 - course is free so download now by
03:21 - scanning this qr code or click the link
03:23 - in the video description
03:27 - another way we can solve our earlier
03:29 - program is using global variables global
03:32 - variables are variables that are
03:34 - declared outside of the function let me
03:36 - show you
03:37 - so i'll use this code from earlier
03:40 - as you already know this code will
03:42 - generate an error so now what i will do
03:44 - is i'll declare an invariable result
03:49 - outside the add number function and then
03:52 - i'll remove this in from here
03:56 - now i'll run this code
03:58 - as you can see this code runs without
04:02 - any error
04:03 - so what happened here is the result
04:05 - variable is declared in global scope
04:08 - this is why we are able to access it
04:10 - from both the function this add number
04:12 - function and the main function
04:15 - that's it for this video if you want to
04:17 - revise this concept you can find all
04:20 - this program in our github repository
04:22 - the link is in the video description
04:24 - below now that we are at the end of this
04:26 - video it's time for programming squeeze
04:28 - in the volume code which variable is a
04:31 - global variable
04:34 - comment your answer below see you in the
04:36 - next video happy programming
04:42 - [Music]
04:48 - you
