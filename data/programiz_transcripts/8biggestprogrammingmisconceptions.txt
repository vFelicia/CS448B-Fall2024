00:00 - today i am going to talk about eight
00:01 - misconceptions about coding
00:03 - the number one misconception is that
00:04 - programmers need to be great at maths
00:07 - they need to have memorized all the
00:08 - mathematical formulae that's not true at
00:10 - all
00:11 - that might be true for some people you
00:12 - know working at google or facebook who
00:14 - are working on
00:15 - top-notch algorithms and optimizations
00:18 - but for a regular software developer
00:20 - the number one skill you need is
00:21 - actually problem solving not math
00:23 - if you have basic understanding of
00:24 - mathematics you can be a good programmer
00:27 - another misconception about programmers
00:28 - or coders is that they have all the
00:30 - syntax memorized and
00:32 - you know they do do it all at once and
00:34 - it just works
00:35 - that's not true at all i myself use a
00:38 - lot of
00:39 - google and i look at other people's code
00:42 - for reference and i also go to
00:44 - communities like stack overflow to find
00:46 - answers to many of the problems that i'm
00:48 - solving
00:48 - so it's not this you know this
00:52 - one-way street process of i know
00:54 - everything already and i'm just
00:56 - implementing it
00:57 - that's not true at all because program
00:58 - programming is such a creative skill
01:00 - that things are changing so fast that
01:02 - you're always learning new things
01:04 - and what you already know is never
01:06 - enough another big conception
01:09 - is that coders are anti-social movies
01:11 - are partly to blame for this
01:13 - because the typical hollywood movie will
01:16 - show a programmer in a hoodie and you
01:19 - know
01:19 - and in a dark room hacking into some
01:22 - network
01:23 - but that's not true at all programmers
01:25 - need to collaborate with other people
01:27 - they need to collaborate with clients
01:28 - they need to communicate otherwise
01:30 - you won't be able to build good software
01:32 - so this
01:33 - vision of uh programmers being
01:36 - anti-social people
01:37 - you know staying alone in a basement is
01:39 - completely untrue
01:41 - another popular misconception is that
01:43 - coders can fix hardware
01:44 - that's totally not true i'm constantly
01:47 - hounded by my relatives or my friends
01:48 - who tell me the printer isn't working
01:50 - or the fridge isn't working or i need to
01:52 - fix the laptop but
01:54 - you know as a programmer there's my
01:56 - speciality is software so i don't really
01:59 - know much about hardware
02:00 - and there's this feeling that you know
02:03 - if you don't fix other people's
02:05 - hardware then you're a terrible person
02:07 - when the reality could be that you don't
02:08 - really know about hardware
02:10 - and that's true for many software
02:11 - engineers or coders
02:13 - so yep that's another misconception that
02:15 - coders can also fix hardware
02:17 - people also seem to believe that coding
02:19 - is always about creating new things
02:21 - and you must constantly be building the
02:23 - next facebook or instagram
02:25 - that's one of the biggest misconceptions
02:27 - i personally like to
02:29 - solve day-to-day problems that people
02:31 - face which are not very exciting which
02:33 - are not always
02:35 - sort of b2c where you know the end
02:37 - consumer is it goes out to millions of
02:39 - people
02:40 - i have built software that's used by two
02:41 - or three people and you know it helps
02:43 - them in their business
02:44 - and they are so grateful to to me and to
02:47 - to the technologies that enable
02:49 - their business to function better so
02:50 - it's not always about building the next
02:52 - big thing
02:53 - it's about solving people's problems the
02:56 - next big misconception is that
02:58 - you should stick to one field and one
03:00 - programming language which is completely
03:02 - untrue
03:02 - every programming language is suited to
03:04 - a different you know domain
03:06 - uh for example python is great for
03:08 - machine learning javascript is the
03:10 - great for almost everything nowadays but
03:12 - mostly for web development
03:13 - but you know you must be flexible
03:16 - sticking to one programming language and
03:19 - you know if the challenge comes if the
03:21 - software requires
03:23 - you to learn a different programming
03:24 - language saying no is a big problem for
03:26 - a coder so
03:27 - no you must not stick to one domain no
03:30 - you must not stick to one programming
03:31 - language
03:32 - you have to look at the problem and you
03:33 - have to find the programming language
03:35 - that is best suited to that problem
03:37 - otherwise you'll you'll end up building
03:39 - not so nice solutions
03:41 - another popular myth or misconception is
03:43 - that coding is for people in their 20s
03:45 - that's not true at all
03:47 - whether you are you know and in fact you
03:50 - go and look at the comments on our
03:51 - channel and there are a lot of people
03:53 - saying i'm 10 years old i'm learning
03:55 - programming from your website and your
03:57 - app and our
03:58 - videos um there are people who
04:01 - like older people who are into some
04:03 - other field who are learning how to code
04:06 - to explore this field so coding is not
04:09 - just for young people in the 20s it's
04:10 - for everyone
04:11 - now let me go to the biggest myth that
04:14 - people have that
04:15 - you need a university degree to learn
04:17 - coding
04:18 - coding is one of those fields that sort
04:20 - of i feel has
04:22 - outgrown the university concept because
04:24 - the field is growing so fast
04:26 - that even you know no matter how much
04:27 - you learn in university there's always
04:29 - so much to learn
04:30 - that's not true for uh some other fields
04:33 - like
04:33 - you wouldn't trust a medical doctor who
04:35 - hasn't been through college
04:37 - uh but you know self-taught coders are
04:39 - taking over the world and
04:41 - you can learn coding from boot camps you
04:42 - can learn coding from youtube tutorials
04:45 - you can take courses online so there's
04:47 - so many avenues and alternatives to a
04:50 - university degree if you want to enter
04:51 - into coding
04:52 - i also have some bonus misconceptions
04:54 - for you the number one bonus
04:55 - misconception
04:56 - is that coding is repetitive and it's
04:59 - boring
05:00 - i don't find coding boring at all it's a
05:02 - creative work and you know although
05:04 - sometimes you're doing repetitive tasks
05:06 - usually you're always exploring some new
05:08 - concept or some new idea
05:10 - and sometimes you're doing an old idea
05:13 - something you've done
05:14 - already like a login form or
05:15 - registration form but using a new
05:17 - library or a new using a new programming
05:19 - language
05:19 - so there's always something new to learn
05:23 - it's not repetitive at all another
05:26 - misconception is that
05:27 - coders are you know fat and unhealthy
05:30 - and they like to eat junk food which is
05:32 - not true at
05:33 - all in fact there are healthy people and
05:35 - unhealthy people in every profession
05:37 - and it's the same for programmers so uh
05:40 - pro or not all programmers are unhealthy
05:42 - or not all programmers eat junk food all
05:44 - day
05:45 - or not all programmers you know don't
05:47 - sleep at night
05:48 - that is something that that is uh sort
05:51 - of a result
05:52 - of pop culture but it's not true at all
05:54 - now there's also this misconception that
05:56 - class stoppers or those who do well in
05:59 - academics can become better programmers
06:01 - than the rest
06:02 - this is something that i personally
06:05 - am completely against this idea that
06:08 - people only people who are
06:09 - good at academics can become programmers
06:11 - the only thing that being good at
06:13 - academics
06:14 - shows is to a potential recruiter it
06:16 - might show that this person is willing
06:18 - to
06:18 - work hard and they have the discipline
06:21 - other than that
06:22 - there is no you know there's no hard and
06:25 - fast rule that
06:26 - someone who is not so good at
06:30 - or struggling at academics cannot be a
06:32 - good programmer sometimes some people
06:34 - just
06:34 - aren't cut out for that academic ladder
06:38 - and some people are and you know coding
06:40 - is beyond all that so
06:41 - yes uh you know i i'm not trying to say
06:45 - that don't work hard at university or
06:46 - college
06:48 - but you know you don't hit yourself on
06:51 - the head if you
06:52 - don't like what is being taught in your
06:54 - college and you prefer the more
06:56 - adventurous routes of doing projects on
06:58 - your own and all that that's really good
07:01 - make sure you pass though that's it for
07:03 - this video i hope i cleared some
07:05 - misconceptions about
07:06 - coding that you might have had or you
07:08 - must have seen in other people
07:10 - if you don't have a's in maths don't
07:12 - worry
07:13 - in fact i have a personal story to tell
07:15 - so of all the subjects in my
07:17 - undergraduate degree
07:18 - i have i don't have i have a's and b's i
07:21 - have d's in three subjects
07:23 - and those three subjects are math one
07:25 - math two and math three
07:27 - and i am here teaching programming not
07:28 - just you know being a software engineer
07:30 - myself
07:31 - i'm also teaching programming to the
07:32 - entire world so if you are if you feel
07:35 - that you're not good at
07:36 - and and again uh there's a difference
07:39 - between academic math
07:40 - and math that's that's useful in the
07:42 - real world so if you
07:44 - suck at academic math then there's no
07:46 - need to be demotivated
07:47 - but you need to be good at napkin
07:50 - mathematics and you know
07:51 - real world mathematics to be a good
07:52 - programmer so as long as
07:54 - you are passionate about problem solving
07:57 - nothing will stand
07:58 - in the way of you and the programming
07:59 - career stay curious and i'll see you in
08:01 - the next one
