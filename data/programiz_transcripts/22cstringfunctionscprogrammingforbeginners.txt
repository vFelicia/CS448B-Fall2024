00:00 - what's up guys welcome back to this
00:01 - series on c programming in the last
00:03 - video we learned about string string is
00:06 - one of the frequently used concept in
00:08 - programming to make working with string
00:10 - easier c provides various string
00:13 - functions that are readily available for
00:15 - us to use in this video we will learn
00:17 - about four most important string
00:19 - function that are used to perform
00:21 - different operation on string so let's
00:24 - get started
00:28 - before we learn about string functions
00:30 - let's revise the working of string first
00:33 - so i'll go back to my code editor
00:37 - here i have the basic outline of a c
00:39 - program
00:41 - now i'll create a string care language
00:46 - is equals to
00:48 - c
00:49 - programming
00:54 - let me print this string using printf
00:56 - statement
00:57 - printf
01:00 - bracket
01:01 - percent s
01:02 - comma
01:04 - language
01:07 - as discussed in our last video we use
01:09 - percent s to print the string
01:12 - now i'll run this code
01:14 - as you can see
01:16 - we have successfully printed the string
01:19 - this is the basic understanding of how
01:21 - string works in c
01:23 - if you have some doubts about this i
01:25 - highly recommend you to watch our
01:27 - previous video you can see the link on
01:29 - the screen
01:30 - now let's start with the string function
01:35 - the styling function or string length
01:38 - function is used to find the length of a
01:41 - string let's see an example here is the
01:43 - code from our earlier program
01:45 - suppose i want to find the length of
01:47 - this string for that i can use strlin
01:50 - function but before that we have to
01:53 - import
01:54 - string.header file so i'll include here
01:57 - include
02:00 - string
02:01 - dot etch header file
02:04 - this is important because strlin
02:07 - function is a standard library function
02:09 - that is defined inside the string dot h
02:12 - header file
02:13 - now let's use the stanlean function
02:15 - i'll use printf
02:18 - statement here
02:20 - and backspace n
02:22 - length
02:24 - percent jet u comma
02:27 - strlin function and inside the function
02:31 - language
02:36 - here percent jet u is the format
02:38 - specifier that we use to print the
02:40 - return value of strlin function
02:44 - now let me run this code
02:47 - here you can see
02:49 - 13 as output the strlin function counts
02:53 - the total number of characters in the
02:55 - string
02:57 - by the way if you're watching this there
02:59 - is a good chance you want to improve
03:00 - your skills in c programming lucky for
03:03 - you we have a mobile app that provides a
03:05 - well-structured c programming course
03:07 - with certification at the end and you
03:09 - can use the app alongside the video to
03:11 - practice on the built-in compiler our
03:14 - course is free so download now by
03:15 - scanning this qr code or click the link
03:18 - in the video description
03:23 - the strcpi function or string copy
03:26 - function is used to copy one string to
03:29 - another let's see an example
03:31 - suppose i have a string name food
03:35 - and i'll assign
03:37 - value
03:39 - pizza to this
03:42 - i want to copy this string to another
03:44 - string named best food so
03:46 - let me first declare the best best food
03:49 - string
03:50 - so best
03:52 - food
03:53 - string
03:55 - and inside the bracket i'll put still in
03:59 - and bracket
04:01 - food
04:03 - here i have used strlin function so that
04:07 - the length of the best foot string is
04:09 - same as the food string
04:11 - now let me use str's cpy function
04:17 - and i'll copy
04:18 - the string from food to best food so
04:22 - best food
04:23 - common
04:24 - food
04:27 - the sdrcpi function takes two value
04:32 - source string
04:33 - from where we want to copy and
04:36 - the destination string
04:38 - and i'll print the best food now
04:40 - so
04:42 - using printf statement
04:45 - percent as
04:47 - comma
04:48 - best
04:49 - food
04:53 - now i'll run this code
04:55 - here you can see
04:56 - the string is copied from the food to
04:59 - best food
05:03 - the str cat function or string
05:05 - concatenation function is used to join
05:08 - two string together let's see an example
05:11 - suppose we have two string
05:13 - cat text one
05:17 - is equals to
05:20 - hey
05:22 - and
05:23 - care text 2
05:26 - is equals to
05:28 - it has value
05:30 - how are you
05:33 - now let's use sti cat function to join
05:35 - this string so strcat
05:38 - bracket
05:40 - text
05:41 - 1 comma text 2
05:45 - i'll print this
05:47 - using printf statement
05:49 - so
05:50 - percent s
05:52 - comma
05:54 - text one
05:56 - now i'll run this code here you can see
05:59 - two strings are joined together however
06:02 - the output does not look nice so let me
06:04 - add here comma and a space and i'll run
06:08 - this again now you can see a clear
06:11 - output that are concatenated together

06:31 - courses
06:35 - the strcmp function or string comparison
06:38 - function is used to compare two string
06:40 - the function returns 0 if both the
06:43 - string are equal however if the string
06:45 - are not equal it returns a random
06:48 - non-zero value let's see an example
06:50 - suppose we have two string caret text
06:54 - one
06:56 - and i'll assign value a b c d
07:00 - and another string
07:03 - that is text 2
07:05 - and i'll assign
07:07 - here value
07:08 - ef gh
07:12 - now let's compare these two string using
07:14 - strcmp function so i'll use
07:18 - strcmp function bracket
07:21 - here text 1 comma text 2
07:28 - and
07:29 - since this function returns an integer
07:32 - i'll assign the return value to an
07:35 - integer so int
07:38 - result is equals to
07:41 - strcmp function
07:43 - now i'll print this using printf
07:45 - statement
07:47 - percent
07:48 - d because this time percent d because
07:51 - this time it gives us integer value and
07:55 - here we'll put result the name of the
07:57 - variable
07:59 - now i'll run this code
08:02 - here we get -4 as output which is a
08:06 - non-zero value because these two strings
08:09 - are not equal
08:11 - now let me change the value of this text
08:13 - to from efg to abcd
08:18 - and i'll run this again
08:21 - this time
08:23 - we get 0 as output because here the both
08:27 - string are equal
08:29 - apart from these four there are dozens
08:32 - of string function that can help us to
08:34 - work with string however remembering
08:36 - them is not possible instead what you
08:39 - can do is google and find the function
08:42 - that you need remember googling things
08:44 - is one of the most important skill in
08:46 - programming
08:49 - now to revise what you have learned in
08:51 - this program here is a programming task
08:53 - for you create a program to compare two
08:56 - string and print the larger string here
08:59 - is how the programs would work get two
09:01 - string input from the user using f gates
09:04 - compare the length of both the string
09:06 - using sdrlin and print the larger string
09:09 - you will find the answer to this
09:10 - question in our github repository and
09:12 - also if you want to revise this concept
09:15 - all this program will be there now that
09:17 - we have reached the end of this video
09:19 - it's time for programming squeeze which
09:22 - of the following function is used to
09:23 - join tostring
09:26 - comment your answer below see you in the
09:28 - next video happy programming
09:33 - [Music]
09:39 - you
