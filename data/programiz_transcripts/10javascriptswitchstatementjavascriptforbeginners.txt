00:00 - what's up guys i'm punit from
00:01 - programmers and welcome back to this
00:02 - series on javascript in this video we
00:05 - will learn about the switch statement
00:06 - and how to use it to make decision
00:08 - making programs in javascript we'll also
00:10 - learn to create a calculator using the
00:12 - javascript switch statement so let's get
00:14 - started
00:18 - before we learn about the switch
00:19 - statement let's consider a scenario you
00:22 - are given a number between 1 to 7 and
00:25 - based on the number you have to print
00:26 - the day of the week for example if the
00:29 - number is 1 then the day is sunday and
00:31 - if the number is 2 the day is monday and
00:33 - so on now you can use the if else
00:35 - statement for this however for every
00:37 - number there should be a separate
00:39 - condition and this will make our program
00:41 - look very messy and difficult to
00:42 - understand for this kind of problem when
00:44 - you have to choose from multiple options
00:46 - a better approach will be the switch
00:48 - statement
00:49 - first let's look into the syntax of a
00:51 - switch statement the switch statement
00:53 - starts with the switch keyword followed
00:55 - by a variable or expression inside
00:57 - parentheses
00:59 - inside the switch statement we can
01:01 - create multiple cases and based on the
01:03 - value of the variable or expression the
01:05 - corresponding case is executed
01:07 - if the result of the expression is equal
01:09 - to value 1 then the body of case 1 is
01:12 - executed similarly if the result is
01:14 - value 2 the body of case 2 is executed
01:17 - and so on
01:18 - if the result is doesn't match any cases
01:20 - the body of default is executed
01:23 - let's get back to our previous example
01:25 - of finding the day of the week
01:27 - so i'll first ask the user to enter a
01:29 - number between 1 to 7 let me remove this
01:31 - old code and this must be muscle memory
01:34 - for you by now so i'll say const number
01:37 - equals
01:38 - percent
01:40 - prompt
01:42 - enter
01:43 - a number
01:45 - between
01:47 - 1 and 7
01:50 - on the next line i can say switch
01:53 - oops
01:55 - number
01:57 - and now let me add the cases so when the
02:00 - case is 1
02:02 - i'll print
02:03 - sunday
02:06 - i'll talk more about this break later on
02:09 - so if the case is two
02:12 - then
02:14 - it's monday
02:15 - break
02:18 - case three
02:19 - now by this time i think we should be
02:21 - copy pasting this code
02:25 - and i need three more
02:29 - and then at the end i'll put the break
02:33 - oh sorry the default
02:35 - and inside that i'll say console.log
02:39 - invalid input now one two three
02:43 - yes
02:44 - tuesday
02:46 - four
02:48 - is
02:49 - wednesday
02:53 - one two three four
02:55 - five
02:56 - is
02:57 - thursday
03:00 - six
03:00 - is friday and
03:02 - similarly seven
03:05 - is saturday
03:08 - here we have included cases from one to
03:10 - seven so if the user enters one
03:12 - then this part of the code is executed
03:14 - which will print sunday to the screen
03:17 - similarly if the user inputs two then
03:19 - this part of the code will be executed
03:21 - and monday will be printed to the screen
03:24 - however if the user enters any number
03:26 - except one to seven then the code inside
03:28 - default will be executed and invalid
03:31 - input is printed let me run this program
03:34 - and i'll press 4 or input 4
03:38 - and you can see that i got wednesday as
03:39 - i expected let me run this again and
03:42 - input an invalid number like 12
03:45 - and you can see that i got invalid input
03:48 - if you're enjoying this video please
03:49 - also check out programs pro where we
03:51 - provide tutorials along with quizzes and
03:53 - challenges which will help you practice
03:55 - and test your learning in real time also
03:57 - the course includes projects to give you
03:59 - an awesome experience of how programming
04:00 - works in the real world and for our
04:02 - youtube subscribers we are giving 50 off
04:04 - on the yearly plan sign up by scanning
04:06 - this qr code or use the link in the
04:08 - video description to claim your discount
04:11 - now you must have noticed we have used
04:13 - the break statement after each
04:15 - individual case in the program that we
04:17 - wrote
04:19 - here the break statement exits the
04:20 - switch statement after executing the
04:22 - matching case
04:24 - if you don't use the break statement all
04:26 - the cases after the matching case are
04:27 - also executed to show you how i'll
04:30 - remove all the break statements from
04:31 - this program so let me remove one by one
04:35 - all of these
04:37 - and now when i run this program
04:40 - and enter 4 again you can see that in
04:43 - addition to wednesday i got other output
04:45 - as well
04:46 - i got wednesday because
04:48 - this case got activated and console log
04:50 - wednesday was printed but since there is
04:52 - no break statement all the cases after
04:55 - that are also executed and that's why we
04:57 - see thursday friday saturday and invalid
04:59 - input as well
05:01 - this is the reason why we use break
05:02 - after every case
05:07 - sometimes there might be situations
05:08 - where we want to execute multiple cases
05:10 - together in such cases we can omit the
05:13 - break statement so let's see one such
05:15 - situation as you can see i pasted some
05:18 - new code on the compiler here we want to
05:20 - check if the day is a weekday or a
05:22 - weekend
05:23 - so all the cases from monday to friday
05:25 - will be a weekday and all the cases
05:28 - saturday and sunday will be a weekend
05:30 - the default obviously will be an invalid
05:32 - day let me run this code
05:35 - and let me press monday enter monday
05:39 - and you can see that i got weekday
05:42 - since there is no break statement
05:44 - all the cases after monday got executed
05:47 - and at the end because the code for
05:49 - friday was console log weekday that's
05:51 - what got printed
05:53 - let me run this code again
05:56 - this time i'll do wednesday
06:00 - and i got weekday again this is because
06:03 - the matching case was wednesday all the
06:06 - oops there was not supposed to be
06:07 - semicolon here so all the cases after
06:10 - wednesday also got executed and at the
06:12 - end of the day i still get the same
06:14 - output which was required
06:16 - now let me run this and enter saturday
06:21 - this time
06:22 - this case was executed and the output or
06:26 - because of there's no break statement
06:28 - this kept on going down and finally i
06:30 - got the value weekend on the screen
06:33 - okay guys we need your support to keep
06:35 - these types of content free for all
06:36 - users youtube really likes engagement on
06:38 - the video so leave a comment below press
06:40 - that like button and hit subscribe if
06:42 - you haven't already let's get the
06:44 - engagement score high up so that more
06:46 - people can discover and enjoy this
06:47 - courses
06:50 - now it's time to see a practical example
06:52 - of the switch statement we will use the
06:54 - switch case statement to create a simple
06:56 - calculator here i have copy pasted the
06:58 - code from a github repository so that
07:00 - you don't have to see me type the whole
07:02 - thing
07:03 - now let's see what's happening in this
07:04 - code here i have taken three inputs from
07:07 - the user
07:08 - first the user is asked to input an
07:10 - operator which is either plus minus
07:12 - multiplication or division operator
07:15 - then the user is asked to input two
07:17 - numbers i have used pass float here so
07:19 - that the user can input decimals as well
07:22 - i've also created a result variable to
07:24 - store the result now based on the
07:26 - operator entered by the user the
07:28 - corresponding case is executed by the
07:30 - switch case statement if the user
07:32 - entered plus then the case plus is
07:35 - actually activated and result becomes
07:38 - number one plus number two the break
07:40 - statement here terminates the switch
07:41 - clause
07:43 - similarly if the user entered minus then
07:45 - the result becomes number one minus
07:47 - number two and the break statement again
07:49 - terminates the clause
07:51 - similar for
07:52 - multiplication and division as well
07:55 - if the user enters something other than
07:57 - these then i tell the user that the in
08:00 - operator they have entered is invalid
08:02 - i don't need the break here that was my
08:04 - mistake
08:06 - and finally the result is printed using
08:09 - console
08:10 - log let me run this program
08:14 - and you can see it says enter operator
08:17 - let me enter something like asterisk for
08:19 - multiplication
08:21 - and it says enter the first number so
08:23 - let me enter 5
08:25 - for the second number let me enter
08:26 - something like 8.8
08:29 - and as you can see i get 44 which is the
08:32 - multiplication of 5 and 8.8
08:39 - now it's time to practice what you've
08:40 - learned here's a programming task for
08:42 - you use the switch statement to create a
08:45 - program that takes the number input from
08:47 - 1 to 12 and based on that print the
08:50 - corresponding month based on the input
08:51 - value so if the number is one print
08:53 - january if the number is two print
08:55 - february and so on you'll find the
08:57 - answer to this question in our github
08:59 - repository also if you want to revise
09:01 - these concepts you can find all these
09:03 - programs in our github repository as
09:04 - well i'll put the link in the video
09:06 - description below now that we have
09:08 - reached the end of this video it's time
09:10 - for the programming quiz
09:12 - which of the cases is executed in the
09:14 - following code
09:16 - comment answer below and happy
09:18 - programming
