00:00 - what's up guys i'm punished from
00:01 - programmers and welcome back to this
00:03 - series on javascript
00:04 - in this video we will learn about arrays
00:06 - which allows us to store a list of
00:08 - values in javascript so let's get
00:10 - started
00:15 - in javascript we use an array to store
00:17 - multiple values together let's imagine a
00:19 - scenario where we want to store the
00:21 - names of hundred people if you start
00:23 - storing each name in a single variable
00:25 - we would have to create hundred
00:26 - different variables in such cases we can
00:29 - use an array to store 100 values at once
00:32 - here names is an array that is storing
00:34 - all the names of 100 people all these
00:36 - names enclosed inside the square bracket
00:39 - are called elements of the array to be
00:41 - an array the elements should be enclosed
00:43 - inside the square braces parenthesis
00:46 - will not do
00:47 - now that we know the benefits of using
00:49 - an array let's see an example
00:53 - i will go back to my code editor and
00:55 - create an array called routine so i can
00:57 - say const routine
01:00 - equals as i mentioned we use square
01:02 - brackets for arrays so let me store two
01:05 - strings each
01:07 - and the elements are separated by a
01:08 - comma
01:09 - and
01:10 - sleep here eat and sleep
01:15 - are called the elements of the array
01:17 - routine
01:19 - now let me print the array so i'll say
01:21 - console.log
01:22 - routine
01:24 - and press run you can see that i get eat
01:27 - and sleep i get the array back as i had
01:30 - created it
01:32 - now let's see one more example this time
01:34 - i'll create an array of numbers just to
01:36 - show you that array also works with
01:38 - numbers so i'll say const
01:40 - numbers equals
01:42 - 2
01:43 - 3
01:44 - 5
01:44 - and 7
01:46 - all prime numbers and console log
01:52 - numbers let me press run
01:55 - and you can see that i got an array of
01:58 - numbers here's where it gets interesting
02:00 - we can also create an array with
02:02 - elements of different types in
02:04 - javascript let me show you i'll create
02:06 - an array and store values of different
02:08 - types so i'll remove this old code and
02:10 - say const arr equals
02:13 - let me start with eat
02:16 - and another string
02:18 - sleep
02:20 - and now i can put in a number
02:22 - another number and maybe another string
02:25 - and when i console log
02:27 - this arr variable
02:30 - and press run
02:32 - i get the output properly
02:35 - if you're enjoying this video please

02:39 - provide tutorials along with quizzes and
02:41 - challenges which will help you practice
02:42 - and test your learning in real time also
02:45 - the course includes projects to give you
02:46 - an awesome experience of how programming
02:48 - works in the real world and for our
02:50 - youtube subscribers we are giving 50 off

02:58 - so far we've been printing complete
03:00 - array elements at once now let's see how
03:02 - we can access each element of the array
03:05 - to access an array element we need
03:07 - something called an array index an array
03:09 - index is a unique number associated with
03:11 - each array element suppose we have an
03:13 - array like this so i'll remove this old
03:15 - code and let me create an array called
03:18 - my array
03:19 - equals
03:21 - h
03:23 - e
03:25 - l
03:28 - l
03:29 - and
03:30 - o oops not the variable o the string o
03:34 - all right now an array index starts from
03:36 - zero that's why the index of the first
03:38 - element h is zero the second element is
03:41 - one and so on now we can use this index
03:43 - number to access the corresponding
03:45 - character let's access each character
03:47 - one by one so i'll go back to my code
03:49 - editor and i'll write to access the
03:52 - first character
03:54 - console.log
03:55 - my array and inside square brackets 0.
04:00 - here i have used the array name followed
04:03 - by square brackets and inside this the
04:05 - index of the element which i want to
04:08 - access
04:09 - so let me press run
04:11 - and you can see that i get h which is
04:14 - the first element in this array
04:16 - now to get the third character i can
04:19 - write instead of 0
04:21 - 2
04:22 - and when i press run
04:24 - you can see that i got l
04:26 - which is the third element in this array
04:30 - in this way you can access other
04:32 - elements using the corresponding index
04:34 - number
04:37 - we can also find the length of an array
04:39 - using the length property the length of
04:41 - an array is the number of elements
04:42 - present inside the array let me give you
04:44 - an example i'll take my array which i
04:48 - already have and console log
04:51 - my
04:52 - array
04:53 - dot
04:54 - length now when i press run
04:57 - you can see that i got 5 which is the
05:00 - number of elements in the array
05:02 - containing the characters h-e-l-l-o
05:09 - once an array is defined we can also add
05:11 - other elements to the array to add an
05:13 - element to an array we use the push
05:15 - method let me show you how let me go
05:17 - back to my old array of routine so
05:20 - routine is eat
05:22 - and sleep which is not healthy at all
05:26 - now i want to add the element exercise i
05:28 - can use the push method as routine dot
05:31 - push
05:32 - and
05:33 - exercise after this if i do console.log
05:38 - routine
05:39 - and now when i press run you can see
05:41 - that the routine variable or the routine
05:43 - array now also has exercise at the end
05:46 - of it
05:47 - okay guys we need your support to keep
05:49 - these kinds of content free for all
05:51 - users youtube really likes engagement on
05:53 - the video so leave a comment below press
05:55 - that like button and hit subscribe if
05:57 - you haven't already let's get the
05:58 - engagement score high up so that more
06:00 - people can discover and enjoy these
06:02 - courses
06:05 - we can also change the elements of an
06:07 - array for this use the index number of
06:09 - the element and use the equals to
06:11 - operator let me show you how
06:14 - so
06:15 - i will go back to my routine array
06:18 - with just eat
06:21 - and sleep
06:23 - and now suppose i want to change the
06:24 - value of sleep to exercise then i can
06:27 - use the array index as routine
06:30 - now inside the square bracket since this
06:32 - is the second element and array indexing
06:34 - starts from zero so zero and one
06:38 - so routine one
06:39 - equals
06:41 - exercise
06:42 - and if i now console log routine you
06:44 - must have guessed the output by now
06:47 - when i press run
06:48 - i get eat and exercise that means sleep
06:52 - has been replaced by exercise
06:57 - we can also remove any element from the
06:59 - array to remove an element from an array
07:01 - we use the pop method let me give you an
07:03 - example on my code editor let me create
07:07 - an array with four elements so work
07:11 - eat
07:13 - sleep
07:14 - and
07:15 - obviously our favorite exercise
07:19 - now let me use the pop method on the
07:21 - array so i say routine dot pop
07:24 - and now when i console log routine again
07:29 - and press run
07:31 - you can see that exercise is no longer
07:33 - there
07:34 - pop remove the last element from the
07:36 - routine array
07:41 - by the way there's also another way to
07:42 - create an array and that is by using
07:44 - javascript's new keyword it is created
07:47 - like this so i can create
07:50 - something like const
07:52 - routine equals new
07:54 - array
07:55 - and just like a function it starts with
07:58 - parenthesis and inside i can put the
08:00 - elements that i want to be in this array
08:02 - so i can say eat comma
08:05 - sleep
08:06 - and now let me console log
08:09 - routine
08:11 - and when i press run
08:14 - it shows that i've got an array with eat
08:16 - and sleep as its elements
08:18 - so i showed you this so that you don't
08:20 - get confused if you see this kind of
08:22 - syntax somewhere else
08:27 - now to practice what we've learned
08:28 - here's a programming task for you create
08:30 - an array named greet with values hello
08:33 - and high
08:34 - now find the length of this array add a
08:36 - new element welcome to this array and
08:38 - find the length of the new array you'll
08:40 - find the answer to this question in our
08:42 - github repository also if you want to
08:44 - revise these concepts you can always
08:45 - find these programs in our guitar
08:47 - repository as well i'll put the link in
08:49 - the video description below
08:50 - now that we've reached the end of this
08:52 - video it's time for the programming quiz
08:54 - what is the output of this program
08:57 - comment answer below and i'll see you in
08:59 - the next video happy programming
09:05 - [Music]
09:10 - you
