00:00 - congratulations on getting this far i
00:01 - hope you had a great experience learning
00:03 - python with me to celebrate your
00:05 - milestone i have a little surprise for
00:07 - you but you'll have to wait till the end
00:08 - of this video to find out what it is now
00:10 - that you're at the end of the python
00:12 - series let's talk a little bit about a
00:14 - programming fact the theory of
00:16 - programming looks easy but the practical
00:18 - bit is very very super super hard
00:21 - you must have noticed this while
00:22 - following my youtube tutorials as well
00:24 - you thought you had grasped the concept
00:26 - but when you tried to do it on your own
00:27 - you struggled and you got frustrated
00:30 - this is why i specifically wanted to
00:31 - make this video so that i could guide
00:32 - you to the next step in your programming
00:34 - journey at programmers we realized that
00:36 - the videos we have on youtube and the
00:38 - tutorials we have on the website are
00:40 - great for learning concepts
00:42 - but from the feedback and suggestions we
00:43 - were getting on youtube and on the
00:45 - website itself we realized that it was
00:47 - still hard to learn things practically
00:50 - we realized that there's a need or a gap
00:52 - for a platform where you can make
00:54 - mistakes you can learn you can try
00:56 - quizzes you can give challenges and you
00:58 - can learn more interactively in real
01:00 - time while getting feedback
01:02 - and that's exactly why we've created
01:03 - programming's pro a platform that
01:05 - combines knowledge with practice
01:07 - and with practice you also get and the
01:10 - ability to track your progress in real
01:12 - time so that you can know where you are
01:14 - and how much you need to learn to apply
01:16 - for your first job once you register to
01:18 - program is pro you'll have access to all
01:20 - the courses that i personally spent
01:21 - hours and hours creating these courses
01:23 - contain not just lessons but also
01:25 - programming challenges and quizzes so
01:27 - that you can constantly test your
01:29 - knowledge these challenges will force
01:31 - you to go through the process of finding
01:32 - and fixing errors so that you get the
01:35 - real life experience of a developer this
01:37 - is where our learning paths come in they
01:39 - start with the very basics of the
01:40 - programming languages that are used in
01:42 - this field and then they slowly guide
01:44 - you through quizzes and challenges and
01:46 - top of the class content so that you can
01:48 - land your first internship or job with
01:50 - confidence our learning paths are
01:52 - designed to be very focused so that they
01:54 - only cover the essentials of any field
01:57 - without overwhelming you since we're
01:59 - talking about internships and jobs let
02:00 - me share a little nugget whenever i'm
02:02 - interviewing people i always make sure
02:04 - to ask if they're done in projects or
02:06 - not those projects could be simple but
02:09 - imagine me having to choose between
02:11 - someone who has never done any real life
02:12 - projects versus someone who has it
02:14 - becomes really a no-brainer for me to
02:16 - select the person who has done some
02:18 - project so we understand that if you
02:20 - want to apply for an internship or a job
02:23 - the interview will most likely ask for a
02:25 - project and our learning paths also
02:27 - contain project based learning where
02:29 - you'll be asked or guided through the
02:31 - process of creating a real world project
02:33 - that you can use as your portfolio
02:35 - you'll be uploading these projects to
02:37 - your personal github so that you can
02:39 - demonstrate that you can also
02:41 - collaborate with other people on code
02:43 - this will give you a nice github
02:44 - portfolio so that when you apply you
02:46 - stand out from other candidates thanks
02:48 - for sticking with me till the end as
02:50 - promised i have a little surprise for
02:51 - you i'm giving away 50 discount on
