00:00 - today i want to talk a little bit about
00:01 - uh competitive programming so
00:03 - competitive programming
00:04 - is uh an online sport where people from
00:07 - all across the world
00:08 - come together to solve challenging
00:09 - programming problems
00:11 - and there's multiple platforms where you
00:13 - can learn competitive programming so
00:15 - there's lead code there's code chef
00:17 - there's code forces hacker rank and in
00:20 - all of these platforms the good news is
00:22 - that
00:22 - it's not just for the advanced computer
00:25 - programmers so there's a spectrum of
00:27 - problems from easy to medium to hard
00:29 - and there is a level for everybody now
00:32 - why spend time uh you know competitive
00:35 - programming in the first place
00:37 - there's lots of advantages to being
00:39 - involved in competitive programming
00:41 - first one being obviously it makes you a
00:43 - better problem solver
00:44 - it makes you it increases your knowledge
00:47 - of data structures and algorithms
00:49 - it makes you a faster programmer and it
00:52 - will also help you land your next job or
00:54 - it might at least
00:56 - help you get through the first or second
00:58 - or you know first few rounds
00:59 - now why do i say that competitive
01:01 - programming helps you become a better
01:02 - problem solver
01:04 - well the problems in competitive
01:05 - programming have
01:07 - you know they're from beginner level to
01:09 - expert level so it challenges your mind
01:11 - to
01:12 - go from a problem that requires a
01:14 - certain level of complexity to a higher
01:16 - level of complexity
01:17 - and this progression from one problem to
01:19 - another to solving another problem to
01:21 - solving another problem
01:22 - keeps your you know uh your programming
01:25 - acts or your problem solving acts always
01:27 - sharp
01:28 - so it really keeps your mind engaged in
01:31 - solving new and new problems
01:32 - in competitive programming problems you
01:34 - need to engage your skills in not just
01:37 - programming
01:38 - but also your mathematical skills so in
01:40 - a particular problem
01:42 - you might use a data structure like a
01:44 - linked list or a queue
01:46 - from a programming site and you might
01:48 - also use
01:49 - permutations and combinations or in
01:51 - numeric analysis or any some other
01:53 - statistical method which comes from
01:54 - maths and stats
01:56 - so because you're using concepts from
01:58 - different fields and combining them
02:00 - it it's always a challenge to your mind
02:02 - and you're always
02:03 - engaged with learning something new so
02:06 - the areas of expertise that you need to
02:08 - gain
02:08 - and the variety of the problems from
02:11 - these areas
02:12 - of expertise makes competitive
02:14 - programming a vast landscape
02:16 - to learn from now another advantage of
02:18 - competitive programming is
02:19 - the mastery of data structures and
02:21 - algorithms that you will gain
02:22 - through competitive programming because
02:25 - without
02:26 - the solid knowledge of data structures
02:28 - you won't be able to solve
02:30 - competitive programming problems as a
02:32 - competitive programmer you will have to
02:34 - learn to manipulate
02:35 - common data structures like linked lists
02:37 - graphs trees
02:38 - and many more and not only just
02:41 - manipulate data structures you'll
02:42 - also sometimes have to make the choice
02:44 - of which data structure to use to solve
02:46 - a particular problem so
02:48 - this will give you the insight into you
02:50 - know how
02:51 - first number one being very comfortable
02:53 - manipulating data structures
02:55 - and number two also being used to
02:58 - using or choosing the right data
02:59 - structure for the problem
03:01 - now when you graduate to becoming a
03:03 - professional software developer
03:04 - then this skill can be very useful
03:07 - because
03:08 - you know more efficient algorithms and
03:11 - more efficient code means
03:13 - less resources that your program will
03:15 - consume and this
03:16 - in turn will lead to lots of cost
03:19 - savings when you know your code is
03:21 - deployed to a server in the cloud or
03:22 - when
03:23 - you are actually solving a business
03:25 - problem so this habit of
03:27 - always optimizing your solution and
03:29 - knowing and finding bottlenecks
03:32 - will definitely make you a better
03:34 - programmer in general
03:36 - now you you're a better problem solver
03:39 - and you also have a very good control of
03:42 - the data structures and algorithms that
03:44 - you need
03:45 - this will make you a faster programmer
03:47 - how how
03:48 - can i say that well imagine you're
03:51 - writing a piece of code and
03:53 - you know you already are habituated to
03:58 - similar patterns of code because of your
04:00 - competitive programming experience
04:01 - so instead of having to look for the
04:04 - solution every time
04:05 - online and looking for solutions that
04:06 - other people have posted
04:08 - you can just write the algorithm on your
04:10 - own because you've already experienced
04:13 - you know this similar pattern of problem
04:14 - before so this makes you a faster
04:16 - programmer and also
04:18 - because you will be exposing yourself to
04:22 - this
04:23 - timed environment where you have to
04:24 - solve problems within a certain time
04:26 - frame
04:27 - you will automatically learn to think
04:28 - quick and also type more quickly
04:30 - and also solve problems more quickly so
04:32 - it will definitely
04:34 - make you a faster programmer quick
04:36 - announcement guys we are doing a q a
04:37 - video next week
04:38 - so if you have any questions for the
04:40 - programming steam comment down below
04:41 - with the ask providence hashtag
04:43 - tomorrow is the last date for submission
04:45 - so hurry up back to the video
04:47 - another advantage of spending your time
04:50 - or investing your time in competitive
04:51 - programming is
04:52 - it will help you in job interviews
04:54 - because
04:56 - lots of companies in the world in fact
04:58 - most companies in the world
04:59 - still use data structures and algorithms
05:02 - and programming puzzles
05:03 - to rate developers on their skills if
05:06 - you are familiar
05:07 - to you know all these programming
05:08 - concepts and
05:10 - data structures and algorithms and the
05:12 - common patterns
05:14 - of that are used in competitive
05:15 - programming then you will be able to
05:17 - solve these problems with ease because
05:19 - many of these problems you'll have
05:20 - already seen before
05:21 - or if there's a problem that you have
05:23 - not seen before you will already have
05:25 - practiced
05:26 - a lot of similar problems so you will
05:28 - automatically be able to come up with
05:29 - the solution quicker
05:31 - so uh investing your time in competitive
05:34 - programming can
05:35 - definitely help you land your next job
05:37 - now let's talk a little bit about the
05:38 - other side of the story
05:40 - uh computer programming is great but if
05:42 - you want to really become a master
05:44 - competitive programmer
05:45 - then just you know practicing it is not
05:48 - enough
05:49 - you will also need to invest your time
05:51 - in learning high level mathematics
05:53 - now for some people it might
05:56 - feel like you know something that they
05:58 - don't want to get into or
05:59 - it's not worth their time personally i
06:02 - definitely recommend exploring
06:04 - a bit of competitive programming for all
06:06 - beginners because
06:07 - uh take it as a hobby you know like it
06:09 - might be some people watch netflix some
06:11 - people like playing video games
06:13 - so do it on the side explore it
06:16 - and learn some mathematics and
06:18 - statistics and
06:19 - data structures algorithms on the way
06:21 - now if you find that
06:23 - you know competitive programming is my
06:25 - calling i'm passionate about this
06:27 - then go to the next level invest more
06:30 - time in it
06:30 - otherwise you might find more interest
06:32 - in traditional
06:34 - software development or web development
06:35 - or mobile development so
06:37 - it's at the beginning of your career or
06:39 - when you're just learning programming
06:41 - i definitely suggest trying out
06:42 - competitive programming but again
06:44 - if you find that it does not interest
06:46 - you then you know
06:48 - there's no need to bang your head on the
06:51 - wall
06:52 - just because it does not interest you
06:54 - because i know a lot of
06:55 - programmers that have do have no
06:57 - background in
06:58 - competitive programming but then they
07:00 - are brilliant programmers
07:01 - so it's really a choice it's something
07:03 - that you should definitely explore
07:05 - and who knows you might be the next
07:07 - great competitive programmer
07:09 - stay curious and i'll see you in the
07:10 - next one
07:28 - you
