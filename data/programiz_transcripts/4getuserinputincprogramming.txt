00:00 - hey guys welcome back to this series on
00:02 - c programming in this video we will
00:04 - learn to take input from users and store
00:06 - it in variables so let's get started
00:13 - in c programming we use the scanf
00:15 - function to take input from the user the
00:17 - scanf function takes input from the user
00:20 - and store it in a variable similar to
00:22 - printf the concept of format specifier
00:24 - is also used here let's see an example
00:27 - as we have already discussed in our
00:29 - previous video this is the basic outline
00:31 - of every c program
00:33 - so i'll continue on this
00:35 - first i'll declare a variable
00:38 - int is
00:39 - now i will use scanf function
00:43 - to take the input from the user
00:49 - and finally i'll use printf function to
00:52 - print the variable
00:58 - now let me explain it in much detail
01:03 - here is an in variable to store the
01:05 - input data and notice the scanf function
01:08 - it has two parts first is the format
01:11 - specifier that represents the type of
01:13 - input data in this case it is an integer
01:16 - and second is the variable name
01:19 - notice that we have used the
01:21 - ampersand before the variable name here
01:24 - ampersand represents the memory address
01:26 - and ampersand is represents the memory
01:29 - address of the ace variable
01:31 - don't worry about the memory address for
01:33 - now we will learn about them in upcoming
01:35 - videos
01:37 - now
01:38 - the scanf function will take the integer
01:40 - input from the user and store it in the
01:43 - address of the ace variable
01:45 - to verify that the input value is stored
01:48 - in the variable i am also printing the
01:50 - variable using printf function
01:53 - now let me run this code
01:55 - here you can see the cursor i'll provide
01:57 - value 22
01:59 - and press enter
02:01 - as you can see the input value is
02:03 - printed
02:04 - here initially i get confused about
02:07 - where to find the cursor to input a
02:09 - value so i'll print a message to ask the
02:12 - user for the input value using printf
02:14 - statement
02:16 - so
02:17 - printf
02:19 - bracket inside quotation i'll write
02:21 - misses enter
02:24 - input
02:26 - value
02:30 - [Music]
02:32 - now let's run this
02:34 - as you can see i get the message enter
02:36 - input value i'll provide 22 and press
02:40 - enter
02:40 - here you can see
02:42 - the value is printed
02:44 - now this message
02:46 - enter input value make it obvious to
02:48 - input value
02:50 - okay guys we need your support to keep
02:53 - these types of content free for all
02:54 - users youtube really likes engagement on
02:57 - the video so leave a comment below press
02:59 - that like button and hit subscribe if
03:02 - you haven't already let's get the
03:04 - engagement score high up so that more
03:06 - people can discover and enjoy these
03:08 - courses
03:12 - now that we know how the scanf function
03:14 - works let's use it to take the double
03:17 - and character input i'll use the same
03:18 - program from earlier and i'll remove
03:20 - this part
03:22 - now first i'll create two variables
03:26 - double number
03:29 - and
03:30 - character alphabet
03:35 - then i'll use printf function
03:37 - to print the
03:39 - message for the user enter
03:42 - double input
03:44 - [Music]
03:47 - and similarly i'll use scanf function to
03:51 - get the input from the user
04:01 - here you can see
04:02 - i have used percent lf to take the
04:04 - double input
04:07 - now
04:08 - i'll use printf function to show the
04:10 - message again
04:13 - enter
04:15 - character
04:17 - input
04:20 - and i'll use scan a function to take the
04:22 - character input from the user
04:30 - and finally i'll print both the values
04:32 - using printf function
04:42 - now before we run this program i'll add
04:45 - here backslash n so that we get a
04:47 - readable output now let's run this
04:49 - program
04:51 - for a double input i'll enter 22.1
04:55 - and for character input i'll enter jet
05:00 - as you can see the double and the
05:02 - character values are printed as expected
05:07 - by the way if you are watching this
05:09 - there is a good chance you want to
05:10 - improve your skill in c programming
05:12 - lucky for you we have a mobile app that
05:14 - provides a well-structured c programming
05:16 - course with certification at the end and
05:18 - you can use the app alongside the video
05:20 - to practice on the built-in compiler our
05:23 - course is free so download now by
05:25 - scanning this qr code or click the link
05:27 - in the video description
05:32 - in our earlier program we took double
05:35 - and character input from the user for
05:37 - that we have used to scan a function
05:39 - however we can also take multiple inputs
05:42 - together using a single scanner function
05:44 - let me show you
05:46 - i have the same code from earlier i'll
05:48 - first remove this code
05:52 - now i'll change this text from double
05:54 - input to input values
05:56 - [Music]
06:00 - now in the scanf function
06:03 - i'll add percent c after percent lf
06:07 - and i'll add here
06:10 - ampersand
06:11 - alphabet after ampersand number
06:14 - with comma in between
06:17 - here in the scanf percent lf is used for
06:20 - double input and percent c is used for
06:23 - character input now let's run this code
06:27 - i'll provide 30.6 double value and then
06:30 - character value c
06:32 - and then press enter
06:34 - as you can see respective values are
06:37 - printed
06:40 - now that i have shown you many examples
06:42 - of taking double and character inputs
06:44 - from the user i want you to write a
06:46 - program to take integer and float input
06:48 - from the user so go ahead and comment
06:50 - your program
06:51 - now we are at the end of this video it's
06:54 - time for programming squeeze
06:56 - what is the correct way to take double
06:58 - input
07:00 - comment your answer below if you want to
07:02 - revise the concept you can find all
07:04 - these programs in our github repository
07:06 - the link is in the video description
07:08 - below see you in the next video happy
07:10 - programming
07:12 - [Music]
07:20 - you
