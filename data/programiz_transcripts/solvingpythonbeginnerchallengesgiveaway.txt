00:00 - you know what they say practice makes
00:02 - perfect
00:03 - you can't learn to code just by knowing
00:05 - what it is you need to practice
00:06 - practice practice to get the bigger
00:08 - picture of how programming really works
00:10 - the more you practice the more mistakes
00:12 - you make so you dissect and tear through
00:14 - your code to understand what's going on
00:16 - and then modify it accordingly to
00:18 - correct your mistakes that is how you
00:20 - learn to program quickly and effectively
00:22 - for beginners solving challenges help to
00:25 - build programming logic
00:26 - and programming is all about how you
00:28 - apply logic to solve a problem
00:30 - so today we are going to do some
00:31 - challenges i'll go through easy
00:33 - medium and hard challenges and explain
00:36 - how to solve them
00:37 - fortunately for us program is just added
00:39 - challenges to its python app
00:40 - the app is free for learning the basic
00:43 - scores however challenges
00:44 - are part of our pro model luckily for
00:46 - you we are giving away
00:48 - five programming pro subscriptions every
00:50 - day so stay till the end of the video to
00:52 - find out how
00:53 - now let's get back to our challenges so
00:55 - i'll open my program is
00:57 - pro i already have a subscription and
00:59 - let me choose the first easy challenge
01:02 - so here i will say odd even check
01:06 - so check if an integer is even given an
01:08 - integer input in variable my variable
01:11 - check if it is an even integer
01:14 - if it is an even integer print the
01:15 - boolean value true otherwise print
01:17 - false looks pretty easy so let me go to
01:20 - the compiler
01:22 - all right so to check if it is divisible
01:24 - by 2
01:27 - let's see so i can just do if
01:30 - my underscore
01:33 - variable oops variable
01:40 - modulus where's the modulus percentage
01:42 - sign here
01:43 - modulus 2
01:49 - equals equals 0 then
01:52 - it is divisible by 2 so i print true
01:54 - otherwise i print false so pretty easy
01:57 - let me run this and looks like my test
02:00 - cases have passed
02:01 - so i don't want to submit this for now
02:03 - because i'm just testing it out
02:04 - let me go back and now let me do a
02:08 - medium challenge
02:09 - um so let's see let me
02:13 - try catching an exception this sounds
02:16 - interesting
02:18 - so try to divide a number by zero and
02:20 - catch the exception thrown
02:22 - get an integer input and store it in n
02:24 - using try x a block
02:25 - print the quotient when n is divided by
02:27 - zero cast the exception in the accept
02:29 - block
02:30 - and print division not possible all
02:32 - right
02:33 - so division not possible here
02:36 - let me print
02:40 - first n by 0 so n
02:44 - divided by 0 and
02:48 - i want to go into the exception so oops
02:51 - i forgot what the challenge was let's
02:54 - see
02:56 - okay i can scroll so i can go back
03:00 - and here
03:04 - and say division not possible okay so n
03:08 - divided by 0 and it says
03:16 - division not
03:19 - possible let me do this
03:23 - and run and let's see what happens
03:27 - looks like all my test cases have passed
03:28 - because the expected output is the same
03:30 - as my output
03:32 - all right now let's go to the harder one
03:34 - so i'll escape
03:36 - and i'll go to the harder challenges so
03:38 - let me
03:39 - try let me
03:42 - try nested list
03:47 - so append one list to another create two
03:49 - list list one list tool list three and
03:50 - assign
03:51 - one two three four and five six append
03:54 - list two
03:55 - at the end of list one using append and
03:57 - print list one
03:58 - all right so i'll go to the compiler
04:02 - and this is pretty easy for me
04:04 - comparatively so
04:06 - list one dot append and i can say
04:09 - list two and
04:13 - let me see if this works so when i press
04:16 - run
04:17 - then all my test cases have passed and i
04:20 - have also done
04:21 - a hard problem now let's get to the part
04:23 - where i tell you how you can get a one
04:25 - year subscription for programming
