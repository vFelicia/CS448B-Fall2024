00:00 - what's up guys i'm puneet from
00:01 - programmers and welcome back to this
00:02 - series on javascript in this video we
00:04 - will learn about objects in javascript
00:06 - how we can access the values of objects
00:08 - and methods we will also learn to use
00:11 - objects to create more structured
00:12 - programs in javascript so let's get
00:14 - started
00:18 - in our past videos we have learnt about
00:20 - different data types like string and
00:22 - numbers which are available in
00:23 - javascript in simple terms a javascript
00:26 - object is also a data type however
00:28 - unlike string and numbers an object
00:30 - stores multiple data suppose there's a
00:32 - person and you want to store information
00:34 - about that person in this case we can
00:36 - create an object and store multiple data
00:38 - about that person inside the object so
00:40 - on my code editor i can create an object
00:43 - by saying const person equals to curly
00:46 - braces
00:47 - and i can store information as name
00:50 - john
00:51 - and h20
00:53 - this is the basic structure of a
00:54 - javascript object here person is the
00:57 - name of the object and it stores a
00:59 - string data name
01:01 - and a number data or an integer data age
01:04 - just like variables we can either use
01:07 - lead or const as i have used here to
01:09 - create an object the data inside an
01:11 - object are stored as key value pairs
01:14 - which are separated by commas as you can
01:16 - see in my example these key value pairs
01:19 - are called properties of an object so
01:21 - name and john together is called a
01:23 - property
01:24 - and age and 20 together are called a
01:26 - property
01:27 - now let me print this object outside of
01:30 - this i'll say console.log
01:32 - person
01:34 - i'll press run
01:35 - and as you can see the key value pairs
01:37 - of the object or the properties of the
01:39 - object are printed on the screen
01:41 - we can also verify that the person
01:43 - variable stores an object by using the
01:45 - type of operator so let me add
01:48 - console.log
01:52 - type of person and now this time when i
01:55 - press run
01:57 - you can see that type of person prints
01:59 - the word object which verifies that the
02:02 - data type of this variable is an object
02:05 - if you're enjoying this video please
02:06 - also check out program is pro where we
02:08 - provide tutorials along with quizzes and
02:11 - challenges which will help you practice
02:12 - and test your learning in real time also
02:14 - the course includes projects to give you
02:16 - an awesome experience of how programming
02:18 - works in the real world and for our
02:20 - youtube subscribers we are giving 50 off
02:22 - on the yearly plan sign up by scanning
02:24 - this qr code or use the link in the
02:25 - video description to claim your discount
02:29 - instead of printing the whole object we
02:31 - can also access individual elements of
02:32 - an object there are two ways in which we
02:34 - can access an object's values they are
02:36 - using the dot notation and the bracket
02:38 - notation let's first see how we can use
02:40 - the dot notation
02:42 - i have the object from the previous
02:43 - example let me remove these two lines
02:46 - now to access the name and age of the
02:48 - person i'll say console.log
02:52 - and person
02:54 - dot
02:55 - name
02:57 - and console.log
02:59 - person dot age
03:02 - let me run this code
03:03 - and as you can see john and 20 are
03:05 - printed on the screen now just by
03:07 - looking at this code you must have
03:09 - figured out that we can print the value
03:11 - of an object by saying object name
03:14 - dot
03:16 - the name of the key which is name in
03:18 - this case and age in the second case
03:21 - using the same syntax we can also change
03:23 - the value of an object let's say i want
03:25 - to change the age to 29 for this i can
03:27 - assign a new value to person.age and
03:30 - print the age again so after this i'll
03:33 - say person dot age equals 29
03:36 - and console.log person dot age and you
03:39 - must have guessed output by now when i
03:41 - press run
03:42 - i get 29 at the end
03:45 - now let's see how we can access the
03:47 - values of an object using the bracket
03:48 - notation
03:50 - i have the object from the previous
03:51 - example in fact i'll not change anything
03:53 - else i'll just remove this old code and
03:55 - instead of saying person dot name
03:58 - i can say person square bracket
04:00 - and name inside quotation marks
04:04 - i'll do the same
04:05 - so for age i'll say person
04:09 - age and age will need to be inside
04:12 - quotation marks now when i press run i
04:15 - get the correct output just like before
04:17 - okay guys we need your support to keep
04:19 - these types of content free for all
04:20 - users youtube really likes engagement on
04:22 - the video so leave a comment below press
04:24 - that like button and hit subscribe if
04:25 - you haven't already let's get the
04:27 - engagements go higher up so that more
04:29 - people can discover and enjoy these
04:30 - courses
04:33 - in javascript an object can also contain
04:35 - a function inside of it let's see an
04:37 - example
04:38 - i have this old code and let me just
04:40 - remove the console logs now i'll add a
04:43 - function inside the object to create a
04:44 - function i'll first need to provide a
04:46 - key so
04:48 - let me call it greet
04:51 - and a value which will be a function
04:54 - that prints console.log
04:57 - or says hello
04:59 - and let me end the function here i can
05:02 - also put this function on multiple lines
05:04 - just like any other regular code
05:10 - now it looks nicer now to access the
05:12 - function i will use the key greet with
05:14 - parentheses so i can say person dot
05:18 - greet
05:20 - and because this is a function i need to
05:22 - put the parenthesis
05:23 - and the semicolon obviously when i press
05:25 - run
05:27 - you can see
05:28 - that hello is printed on the screen
05:33 - now to practice what we've learned
05:35 - here's a programming task for you can
05:36 - you create an object named student with
05:38 - keys name rule number and total marks
05:41 - give them any values you prefer also
05:43 - create two functions the first function
05:45 - to print the information about the
05:47 - student and a second function to check
05:49 - if the student passed the exam or not if
05:51 - the total marks is less than 40 print
05:53 - you failed if the total marks is greater
05:55 - than or equal to 40 print you passed you
05:58 - will find the answer to this question
05:59 - now get up repository also if you want
06:01 - to revise these concepts you can always
06:03 - find these programs in our github
06:05 - repository i'll put the link in the
06:06 - video description below now that we've
06:09 - reached the end of the video it's time
06:10 - for the programming quiz what's the
06:12 - correct way to access the value of the
06:14 - student's name
06:15 - you can see the options on your screen
06:17 - comment the correct answer below and
06:19 - happy programming
