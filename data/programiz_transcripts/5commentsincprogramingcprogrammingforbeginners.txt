00:00 - hey guys this is me padma from
00:01 - programmies and welcome back to this
00:03 - series on c programming in this video we
00:05 - will learn to write comments in c
00:07 - programming we'll also see why comments
00:10 - are important so let's get started
00:16 - comments are hints that we add to our
00:19 - program to make our code easier to
00:21 - understand let's see an example
00:23 - i have this program that brings a
00:25 - variable to make this code a bit more
00:28 - readable i can add comment here
00:31 - like this
00:35 - create
00:36 - a
00:37 - variable
00:38 - [Music]
00:41 - and i'll add another comment here
00:47 - print the value
00:50 - of data variable
00:55 - here these lines that start with two
00:58 - forward slashes are comments we add them
01:01 - to make our program easier to understand
01:04 - for everyone let's see what happens when
01:06 - we run this program
01:09 - as you can see the program runs normally
01:12 - without any issue this is because c
01:14 - programming completely ignores the line
01:17 - that start with double forward slashes
01:20 - we can also put the comment and our code
01:24 - in the same line for that i'll cut this
01:27 - and put this in the same line with the
01:30 - code
01:30 - i'll do this
01:32 - for this comment as well
01:36 - now i'll run this code and see what
01:38 - happens you can see that the code before
01:42 - two forward slashes are executed and all
01:45 - comments are ignored
01:48 - we can add any number of comments
01:50 - anywhere in our program however if our
01:53 - code is self-explanatory there is no
01:55 - need to use comments this only makes our
01:58 - code very messy so i'll remove these
02:01 - comments from the program
02:07 - okay guys we need your support to keep
02:09 - these types of content free for all
02:11 - users youtube really likes engagement on
02:14 - the video so leave a comment below press
02:16 - that like button and hit subscribe if
02:18 - you haven't already let's get the
02:20 - engagement score high up so that more
02:22 - people can discover and enjoy these
02:24 - courses
02:28 - we can also use comments to debug our
02:30 - code it is a common practice to comment
02:33 - out code so that it is ignored rather
02:35 - than removing them completely let me
02:37 - give you an example
02:39 - in this example i have created a program
02:41 - to take a's and hide from the user
02:44 - suppose in this program i was not
02:46 - required to take the height input from
02:48 - the user so instead of removing the code
02:51 - related to height what i can do is i can
02:54 - simply add a double forward slash at the
02:57 - beginning of this line so that they
02:59 - become comments so to make them comments
03:02 - i'll just add forward slash here
03:07 - so i'm adding forward slash to every
03:10 - code
03:11 - that is related to height
03:12 - now the codes will be there if we need
03:14 - them in future but they are completely
03:16 - ignored by the c compiler
03:20 - now let me run this code
03:23 - as you can see
03:26 - it says enter the is i'll enter 29
03:30 - and press enter
03:32 - here the output says is equals to 29 but
03:35 - these lines
03:37 - are completely ignored
03:41 - now later on if we need height again
03:44 - all we need to do is to remove
03:47 - these forward slashes
03:54 - and they will now become statement not
03:56 - comment
03:58 - now let me run this code again
04:01 - i'll enter the a is 29
04:03 - and i'll add your height equals to 11
04:08 - and you can see the output on the screen
04:12 - a little pro tip for you remember the
04:14 - keyword shortcut to apply comments in
04:17 - most text editors it's ctrl forward
04:20 - slash if you are on windows and command
04:22 - forward slash if you are on mac this
04:24 - will be very helpful in debugging our
04:26 - code by the way if you are watching this
04:29 - there is a good chance you want to
04:30 - improve your skill in c programming
04:32 - lucky for you we have a mobile app that
04:35 - provides a well-structured c programming
04:37 - course with certification at the end and
04:39 - you can use the app alongside the video
04:41 - to practice on the built-in compiler our
04:44 - course is free so download now by
04:45 - scanning this qr code or click the link
04:48 - in the video description
04:52 - in c programming there is another type
04:54 - of comment that allow us to comment on
04:57 - multiple lines at once let me give you
04:59 - an example
05:01 - suppose we want to comment these three
05:03 - lines
05:04 - we can do that by typing forward slash
05:06 - and asterisk at the beginning and
05:08 - asterisk and forward slash at the end
05:11 - so let's do that
05:13 - forward slash and asterisk at the
05:15 - beginning
05:17 - and asterisk and forward slash at the
05:20 - end
05:21 - now let's run this code i'll enter 29
05:27 - as you can see the code runs without any
05:29 - errors and these comments are ignored
05:36 - i can also use keyboard shortcut to use
05:38 - multi-line comments let me show you
05:41 - first i'll remove this forward slash and
05:44 - asterisk
05:45 - at the beginning and i'll also remove
05:47 - this asterisk and forward slash at the
05:49 - end
05:51 - and i will select these three lines and
05:54 - press ctrl shift forward slash as you
05:56 - can see these lines are now commented if
05:59 - you are on mac you can press command
06:01 - shift forward slash
06:03 - here instead of ctrl shift forward slash
06:06 - if i press ctrl forward slash only these
06:09 - three lines will be commented at once
06:11 - but they will be commented with single
06:13 - line comments
06:15 - the multiline comments are useful if we
06:17 - need to explain the code a bit more and
06:20 - add more text to understand the code
06:26 - now let's take a moment to discuss why
06:29 - comments are important
06:30 - imagine that you are working on a huge
06:32 - project for a client since you were on a
06:35 - tight schedule you decide to ignore
06:37 - comments you successfully delivered it
06:39 - to the client and clients are happy
06:41 - about it
06:42 - fast forward in a couple of months the
06:44 - client want to update some features of
06:46 - project since you were the one who
06:48 - developed the project the client wants
06:50 - you to make the change without comments
06:52 - you will forget the reason why you wrote
06:55 - a particular piece of code a certain way
06:58 - and you will end up spending a lot of
07:00 - time looking at your own code and trying
07:02 - to understand it now if you had
07:04 - commented the code it would have been
07:06 - easier for you
07:08 - comments are even more important if you
07:10 - are working in a group it makes it
07:12 - easier for other developers to
07:14 - understand and use your code
07:16 - that being said comments are not and
07:19 - should not be used as a substitute to
07:21 - explain poorly written code you should
07:23 - always try to write clean understandable
07:26 - code and then use comment as an addition
07:29 - now that we are at the end of this video
07:31 - it's time for programming's quiz what is
07:34 - the correct way to comment in c
07:36 - programming
07:37 - comment your answer below if you want to
07:39 - revise this concept you can find all
07:42 - these programs in our github repository
07:44 - the link is in the video description see
07:46 - you in the next video happy programming
07:49 - [Music]
