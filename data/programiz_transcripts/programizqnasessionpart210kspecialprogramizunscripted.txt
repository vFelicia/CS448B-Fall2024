00:00 - first and foremost thank you for
00:01 - showering all the love on our ass
00:03 - programming's part one
00:04 - as i mentioned before during the part
00:06 - one video there were so many questions
00:08 - that we had to break up the video into
00:09 - two parts
00:10 - and this is part two of ask programmers
00:13 - also i'd like to thank all of you for
00:15 - taking us
00:15 - 10 000 subscribers it's a massive number
00:18 - for us and it really motivates us to
00:20 - create more content
00:21 - so if you have not hit that subscribe
00:22 - button hit it and also hit that bell
00:24 - icon so that you get notifications for
00:26 - the next video
00:27 - the first question is from youtube
00:29 - comments so it says i love your python
00:31 - tutorials
00:32 - waiting for other languages to what is
00:34 - your favorite programming language bro
00:36 - the question is from asmitastraster so
00:40 - you must be wondering it must be python
00:42 - but it's not i
00:43 - actually love javascript because uh not
00:46 - because
00:46 - you know there's a preference then i
00:48 - believe that javascript is better than
00:50 - python
00:50 - but because it is the programming
00:52 - language i learned first
00:54 - when i went into professional software
00:55 - development and it's a language that
00:57 - i've always talked with
00:58 - in fact we we are planning some
01:01 - tutorials on javascript or
01:03 - you know we have a series on javascript
01:05 - on the programming website
01:06 - and you could see apps or videos on
01:08 - javascript coming soon so
01:10 - definitely javascript is uh what my
01:13 - favorite programming language and it's a
01:15 - language that i will never give up on
01:18 - uh one is by karthik udainiya
01:21 - udainiya so he says ask program is when
01:24 - will you start making videos on
01:25 - application based or project based
01:27 - coding like
01:28 - for programming games i i understand
01:31 - that you want to start building projects
01:33 - and you know
01:33 - just learning and this is something that
01:35 - i've been saying myself that
01:37 - watching tutorial after tutorial is not
01:39 - going to help unless you
01:40 - get your hands dirty with programming so
01:43 - definitely that is in the
01:44 - pipeline and you know first we want to
01:46 - wrap up the basics of python so that
01:49 - when we build those project-based things
01:51 - if you get stuck
01:52 - then you have high quality resources you
01:54 - can get back to if you go to project
01:56 - based videos directly
01:58 - then you know if you don't have good
02:00 - resources on the basics
02:01 - we don't want you to get stuck and
02:03 - that's why we want to finish all these
02:05 - basics videos first
02:06 - definitely as you mentioned we want to
02:08 - teach you
02:09 - how to build projects and how things
02:11 - work in real life
02:12 - some of them are very different from the
02:14 - tutorials or you know it's not as
02:16 - rosy as the tutorials seem to be but
02:20 - yes that is definitely in the pipeline
02:22 - the next question is by a user called
02:24 - civo hd
02:26 - so they say will you teach machine
02:28 - learning on python
02:30 - now this is a question that we get a lot
02:32 - and you know this is something that we
02:34 - ponder a lot
02:35 - that should we go into more advanced
02:37 - courses like machine learning and data
02:38 - science and
02:39 - web development and all that but what
02:41 - we've decided is program is is always
02:43 - going to be for beginners
02:44 - and at least that is the focus right now
02:46 - so we are
02:48 - not going into teaching machine learning
02:50 - or you know more advanced
02:53 - parts of programming this helps us
02:56 - really focus our attention on beginners
02:58 - who are struggling with basic concepts
03:00 - and this is a conscious decision that we
03:02 - have taken as a brand so
03:04 - maybe in the future yes but for now we
03:06 - are focused on helping beginners
03:08 - uh take their first steps into coding
03:10 - moving on to the next question
03:12 - so it's from youtube riya stressed asks
03:15 - which text editor do you guys use ask
03:17 - program is
03:19 - my favorite is vs code and everyone in
03:21 - our team uses vs code
03:23 - because not only is it very simple it's
03:25 - also open source
03:27 - and it's got this whole ecosystem of
03:29 - extensions
03:30 - and community behind it so whether
03:33 - if you're doing if you're coding in
03:36 - python you can install the extensive
03:38 - for python if you're doing web
03:39 - development there are lots of extensions
03:40 - for web development
03:41 - if you're doing data science then there
03:43 - are lots of extension for data science
03:45 - and so it is so customizable and still
03:47 - so simple
03:48 - i don't know how you know how it's it's
03:52 - kind of
03:53 - i used to always believe that uh
03:55 - microsoft visual studio was one of the
03:57 - best pieces of software ever
03:59 - built and i'm so glad that they've open
04:01 - sourced it and made it made it lighter
04:03 - and
04:04 - made it open for the whole world to use
04:06 - so yes vs code is
04:08 - definitely our first choice of text
04:10 - editor and not just us
04:11 - it's you know all over the world vs code
04:13 - has taken the world by strong
04:15 - and the community that that keeps on
04:18 - adding to it is amazing so i suggest if
04:21 - you're a beginner or even if you're
04:22 - someone
04:23 - intermediate or advanced uh try vs code
04:26 - it's amazing
04:26 - the next question says i am working in
04:29 - an
04:30 - mnc so multinational company they do
04:32 - provide education and courses
04:34 - i joined the programming world and
04:36 - started from there
04:38 - in one of those courses i found your
04:40 - course on python beginner and started
04:42 - and followed your program his website
04:44 - i learned the basics sir and due to
04:46 - being
04:47 - i learned the basic sir and due to being
04:49 - a full-time employee unable to manage
04:51 - the time
04:52 - i am expecting a few exercises in python
04:55 - for beginners
04:56 - now it's a great thing that you want
04:58 - exercises and you know something beyond
05:00 - the tutorials
05:01 - and the little assignments that we give
05:03 - at at the end of some of the tutorials
05:05 - and if you're a beginner then our
05:10 - website has a dedicated section for
05:12 - examples
05:13 - in fact there's a dedicated header menu
05:15 - that says examples and you can look at
05:16 - the examples in different programming
05:18 - languages
05:19 - however i understand that you know many
05:21 - of these examples can be
05:22 - uh like build a fibonacci series or
05:25 - something that
05:26 - does not relate to a real problem but
05:29 - more of a simulation of a mathematical
05:31 - puzzle so that is something that we are
05:33 - definitely looking to change and we are
05:35 - going into more
05:36 - live projects so sir my question is
05:39 - about data structures and algorithms
05:41 - i heard this concept and don't know what
05:42 - this is and what do we learn in this
05:45 - concept and where to start
05:47 - this is a great question by kushal shah
05:49 - so thank you for asking it first
05:52 - yes for beginners you know there's
05:54 - there's so many
05:56 - buzz words that appear on the internet
05:58 - and on even in our content that
06:00 - can be confusing especially data
06:02 - structures and algorithms
06:03 - for someone learning if else and for
06:05 - loops and struggling with these concepts
06:07 - suddenly someone comes you and says
06:09 - learn data structures and algorithms
06:10 - you know go for competitive programming
06:12 - and it can be overwhelming so
06:15 - data structures and algorithms are more
06:17 - of an intermediate or advanced concept
06:18 - in programming basically
06:20 - if if it is about optimizing
06:24 - your code so that it runs faster and
06:26 - does not consume a lot of resources
06:29 - so data structures and algorithms
06:31 - basically
06:32 - trains your mind to pick the right
06:36 - [Music]
06:38 - structure for your data or you know how
06:41 - you can structure your data
06:43 - and algorithms basically focuses on
06:44 - finding more
06:46 - efficient solutions for instance if you
06:48 - wanted to find the sum of
06:50 - the first 10 numbers then you could say
06:52 - you know you could run a for loop
06:54 - from 1 to 10 and then you can add all
06:56 - those numbers up
06:57 - but if someone told you to add the first
07:00 - billion numbers to the first trillion
07:01 - numbers
07:02 - then this algorithm of running a for
07:04 - loop from 1 to
07:05 - a billion or a trillion probably will
07:08 - give you trouble
07:09 - instead there's a mathematical formula n
07:12 - times n plus 1 by 2 that will directly
07:14 - give you
07:14 - the sum of natural numbers from 1 to n
07:17 - so
07:17 - this is an algorithm that will you know
07:19 - that is more efficient
07:21 - and algorithms basically is about
07:23 - building these kinds of efficiencies
07:25 - into your program
07:26 - i hope this made it clear but again data
07:29 - structures and algorithms
07:30 - takes time to learn the next question
07:31 - comes from shreem mishra
07:34 - he says hello respected teachers can you
07:37 - please help us in writing python codes
07:39 - to print patterns
07:40 - it's a bit confusing and also do
07:42 - introduce us with your team
07:44 - and tell us more about your python
07:46 - passion and your work is
07:47 - just i don't see a lot of you guys have
07:51 - been asking us this question that you
07:52 - want to see pattern programs
07:54 - now i understand you know this uh the
07:56 - fun of pattern programming i did it
07:58 - myself when i was in college and
08:00 - uh it can really help you get your head
08:03 - around the basics of
08:05 - code because there's a challenge and you
08:06 - need to solve it so
08:08 - definitely we're coming up with those
08:09 - kinds of videos and also challenges in
08:11 - our app
08:12 - stay tuned now another thing that you
08:15 - asked is uh introduced to our team
08:18 - definitely uh there's you know it's not
08:20 - just me there are people who help me
08:22 - write the script there are people
08:23 - behind this camera who helped me create
08:26 - these videos there are people who design
08:28 - our website there are people who write
08:29 - content
08:30 - so there's this huge team of people that
08:32 - make programs possible
08:34 - obviously and i'm the person that that
08:37 - is in front and
08:38 - that because i am in the videos
08:39 - everybody knows me but
08:41 - uh definitely i would love to introduce
08:44 - some of the team members and
08:45 - maybe we will plan something around that
08:47 - so thank you for asking this question
08:49 - shout out to everyone in the programs
08:50 - team i love you guys and you
08:53 - do such wonderful work i am so proud of
08:55 - this team
08:56 - now about my passion for python um i
08:59 - don't really have a passion for python
09:01 - or javascript
09:02 - i you know and i feel that you
09:05 - as a beginner you should not build or
09:07 - even as someone advanced you should not
09:09 - really build
09:10 - an attachment for one programming
09:12 - language instead
09:14 - have a passion for for problem solving
09:16 - or for
09:17 - one domain of programming so you could
09:18 - say i have a passion for machine
09:20 - learning or i have a passion for web
09:21 - development
09:22 - i have a passion for building enterprise
09:23 - software or mobile apps
09:25 - that is a better way because you know
09:27 - see let's talk about mobile apps
09:30 - when i was uh starting my career people
09:32 - were building mobile apps in java and
09:35 - you know objective c then swift came
09:37 - along
09:38 - and changed the way we built iphone apps
09:40 - now there's uh then
09:41 - react native came so javascript was the
09:43 - way to go now people are building apps
09:45 - in flutter
09:46 - so the programming language will always
09:48 - change and you know if you get
09:50 - stuck if if i was stuck with objective c
09:53 - till now i would probably be out of job
09:55 - so
09:56 - don't really get attached to one
09:58 - programming language something better
09:59 - than python or javascript might come
10:01 - coming tomorrow and you know
10:02 - take the world by storm it doesn't take
10:04 - too long so yeah don't be passionate
10:06 - about programming languages
10:08 - instead try to find the niche that
10:11 - really attracts you and
10:12 - and then do research on which
10:14 - programming languages are popular in
10:16 - that field that's it for this video
10:18 - i hope you enjoyed it i enjoyed it a lot
10:21 - because it's always great to see that
10:23 - people have questions and people expect
10:25 - so much out of us
10:26 - it's also a bit of pressure but that's
10:28 - okay i enjoyed this whole process of
10:29 - making videos and creating content
10:31 - i and the programmers team are thankful
10:33 - for all these questions and all the
10:34 - motivation to build
10:36 - new products definitely all your
10:38 - suggestions are being uh
10:39 - taken and we are building lots of
10:41 - products for you stay tuned and i'll see
10:43 - you in the next one
10:52 - you
