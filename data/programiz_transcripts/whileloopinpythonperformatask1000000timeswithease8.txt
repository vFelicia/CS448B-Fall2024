00:00 - what's up guys i'm puneet from
00:01 - programmers and welcome back to this
00:03 - series on python
00:04 - in the last video we learned about the
00:06 - if statement
00:07 - to create programs that can make
00:09 - decisions in this video
00:11 - we will learn about the while loop a
00:13 - loop is a fundamental concept in all
00:15 - programming languages
00:16 - not just python they are used to repeat
00:18 - a block of code
00:20 - multiple times as per our requirement
00:22 - this allows us to create some
00:24 - interesting programs
00:25 - as you'll see in this video so let's get
00:28 - started
00:34 - before we write the actual code of the
00:35 - while loop let's take a look at its
00:37 - syntax
00:38 - a while loop starts with the keyword
00:40 - while followed by a test condition
00:43 - followed by a colon then we write the
00:46 - body of the loop
00:47 - in the next lines
00:51 - notice the spaces before the body of the
00:54 - loop
00:55 - this indentation is important as it
00:58 - indicates the body of the loop
01:00 - here's how this pseudo code works python
01:03 - checks this condition which is a boolean
01:05 - expression that evaluates to either true
01:07 - or false
01:08 - if it's true the body of the while loop
01:10 - is executed
01:12 - at this point it's similar to the if
01:14 - statement however
01:16 - unlike an if statement that checks the
01:18 - test condition only once
01:19 - after executing the body of the loop it
01:22 - checks the test condition
01:23 - again this process goes on and on until
01:26 - the test condition evaluates to false
01:28 - if the test condition is never false the
01:31 - loop runs forever
01:32 - until the system's memory runs out let
01:34 - me give you an example
01:36 - so i'll remove this old code and i'll
01:38 - say count
01:39 - equals 0 then i'll say while
01:43 - count less than 5
01:47 - print i am inside a loop
01:51 - let me add one more statement and say
01:53 - print
01:55 - looping is interesting
01:58 - let me run this program and as you can
02:01 - see these two print statements
02:03 - are executed again and again and again
02:08 - let's analyze what this program is doing
02:10 - here count equals 0
02:12 - in this line count less than 5 or 0 less
02:15 - than 5
02:15 - is true that is why these two statements
02:18 - are executed
02:19 - now since this is the while loop it will
02:22 - again check the test condition
02:24 - again count or which is 0 less than 5 is
02:27 - true
02:27 - and again these statements are executed
02:30 - this happens again and again
02:32 - and this condition count less than 5
02:36 - is never false so the loop runs forever
02:40 - this is known as an infinite loop
02:44 - however most of the time rather than
02:47 - running a loop forever and ever
02:49 - we want loops to end at some point let's
02:52 - say
02:52 - we want this loop to run only five times
02:55 - we can do that by adding one statement
02:58 - inside this loop
02:59 - so that this test condition count less
03:01 - than
03:02 - five is false after running five times
03:06 - at the end of the loop i'll add one
03:08 - statement
03:09 - count equals count
03:12 - plus one here
03:15 - we have increased the count variable by
03:17 - one in each iteration of the loop
03:20 - now let's see from the start how the
03:21 - program works
03:23 - initially the count variable is zero
03:26 - that's why
03:26 - count less than five or zero less than
03:28 - five is true
03:30 - and the body of the while loop is
03:31 - executed
03:34 - if you've noticed this new line that we
03:36 - have added is
03:37 - incrementing the value of count by one
03:40 - since its initial value was zero
03:42 - its new value is one now the while loop
03:45 - checks the condition again
03:47 - this time count less than 5 or 1 less
03:50 - than 5
03:50 - is again true and again the body of the
03:53 - loop is executed
03:54 - but this time since the value of count
03:56 - was 1 its new value is 2.
04:02 - basically this line count equals count
04:05 - plus 1
04:06 - is increasing the value of count in each
04:09 - iteration of the loop
04:10 - from count equals 0 to count equals 4
04:13 - which is five times
04:14 - after the five runs the count variable
04:17 - is increased from four to five
04:19 - only then the test condition count less
04:21 - than five or five less than five
04:23 - is false let me press the run button and
04:26 - show you
04:27 - so when i press the run button this time
04:30 - i am inside a loop and looping is
04:32 - interesting
04:32 - is printed only five times let me change
04:35 - this program a bit
04:37 - i will remove these two print statements
04:39 - and instead i'll print the count
04:40 - variable inside the for loop
04:42 - so that we can better understand what's
04:44 - happening now when i press the run
04:46 - button
04:47 - as you can see the value of count was 0
04:49 - and it went up to 1
04:51 - 2 3 4 and 5 and when count was 5
04:55 - it was this condition was false and the
04:57 - loop exited
04:59 - now let me modify this program again i
05:01 - will change
05:02 - count to 5 and i'll change this test
05:04 - condition to
05:05 - count less than equal to 10.
05:09 - can you guess the output of this program
05:11 - without running it i'll give you a
05:12 - couple of seconds to pause the video
05:17 - you can find the answer to this program
05:19 - in our github repository
05:20 - the link will be in the video
05:21 - description before moving to the next
05:24 - section of the video
05:24 - i'd like to mention that the program is
05:26 - team has created an app that allows you
05:28 - to learn python from your phone
05:30 - the app contains bit size lessons that
05:32 - are easy to understand
05:33 - a built-in interpreter so that you can
05:35 - run python on your phone
05:36 - quizzes and many more features the app
05:39 - is available on both ios and android
05:41 - the links are in the video description
05:43 - below
05:45 - now let's try one more example of the
05:47 - while loop we will print the
05:48 - multiplication table of a number
05:51 - that is entered by the user from 1 to
05:53 - 10.
05:54 - to write this program we need to create
05:56 - a loop that runs 10 times
05:59 - from 1 to 10. let's do that first so
06:01 - i'll remove this old code
06:03 - and i'll say number equals
06:06 - int and then i'll take an input
06:09 - enter a number then
06:13 - i'll say count equals 1
06:17 - while count less than equals 10
06:22 - count equals count plus one
06:25 - let me run this code and it says enter a
06:27 - number when i enter six
06:30 - nothing really gets printed this is
06:32 - because i have not printed
06:34 - anything inside the while loop however
06:36 - this program is still doing something
06:37 - useful
06:38 - it is taking the variable count and
06:41 - increasing it from 1 to
06:42 - 10 in each iteration of the while loop
06:45 - because of the statement count equals
06:47 - count plus 1.
06:50 - now in each iteration of the loop we
06:52 - need to print the row of the
06:53 - multiplication table
06:55 - i will do that by adding a few lines so
06:58 - here
06:58 - i'll say product equals
07:02 - number times count
07:06 - and then i'll say print product
07:09 - we have computed the product by
07:11 - multiplying number by count
07:13 - and in line 6 we have printed the
07:16 - product by using the print statement
07:18 - let me run this program when i run it
07:20 - then it says enter a number
07:22 - and when i enter something like 6 we can
07:24 - see that the output shows the result
07:26 - when 6 is multiplied by numbers from 1
07:29 - to 10
07:30 - let's make that a bit more readable here
07:32 - instead of print
07:34 - product i'll say print number
07:39 - times count
07:43 - equals product let me press the run
07:46 - button
07:47 - and it says enter a number i'll enter
07:49 - something like 6 and when i press enter
07:51 - then it shows the multiplication table
07:54 - in nicely formatted manner
07:56 - this is because as we have seen in the
07:58 - previous video the print function takes
08:00 - whatever is in between the commas
08:02 - and prints them with spaces in between
08:06 - as you can see from this example you can
08:09 - write pretty awesome programs using
08:10 - loops
08:11 - the syntax of the while loop is pretty
08:13 - easy however
08:15 - the important part is the logic and how
08:17 - you use it
08:18 - and how do you get good at logic one
08:20 - word practice
08:22 - so here's a task for you to practice can
08:25 - you modify our multiplication table
08:27 - program
08:27 - so that you get a multiplication table
08:30 - from 10 to 1
08:31 - instead of 1 to 10. you have to modify
08:33 - the same program that i've written here
08:35 - and you can see the expected output on
08:37 - the screen
08:40 - find the answer to this question in our
08:41 - github repository also visit our website
08:44 - programmers.com for more information on
08:46 - why
08:46 - loop with examples i posted the links in
08:49 - the description below
08:50 - by the way if we know that our loop
08:52 - iterates for a certain number of times
08:54 - like 5 times or 10 times in our examples
08:57 - it's easier and better to use the for
09:00 - loop which we will learn about in the
09:02 - next video
09:03 - before we wrap up this video let's recap
09:05 - some of the concepts we have learned
09:08 - loops are used in programming to repeat
09:10 - a block of code
09:11 - the while loop runs continuously until
09:14 - the test condition is false
09:16 - if the test condition of the loop is
09:18 - never false
09:19 - the loop runs infinitely until the
09:21 - memory is full
09:22 - this is known as an infinite loop that's
09:25 - it for this video
09:26 - i hope you learned something if you're
09:27 - just watching the video without writing
09:29 - any code
09:30 - i highly encourage you to try the
09:31 - programs in this video on your own
09:33 - the only way you can be a good
09:35 - programmer is by trying by the way you
09:37 - can find all the programs from this
09:38 - video on github
09:40 - i posted the links in the description
09:41 - below feel free to copy the programs and
09:44 - edit them as you please
09:45 - and if you have any questions and
09:47 - feedback use the comment section below
09:49 - in the next video we will learn about
09:51 - the python for loop
09:52 - which is used to iterate through a
09:54 - sequence join me in this video series
09:57 - and let's explore the exciting wall of
