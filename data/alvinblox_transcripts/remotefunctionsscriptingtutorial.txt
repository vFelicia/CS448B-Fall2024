00:00 - hello this video is about how to use
00:03 - remote functions in roblox in the
00:06 - previous video we looked at remote
00:08 - events and also filter enabled which
00:10 - we'll be going over in this one as well
00:12 - but the difference between remote events
00:14 - and remote functions is that they're
00:16 - basically they do the same thing but a
00:18 - remote function can return information
00:21 - or messages back to a local script once
00:25 - it's been fired okay so once it's done
00:28 - an action on the server it can return
00:30 - information back telling us you know
00:32 - whether it was completed or whether it
00:35 - failed etc so we can send messages back
00:38 - in the video we're going to be going
00:39 - over remote functions and we're gonna be
00:42 - doing a demonstration to show you how
00:44 - they work as well and how they would
00:47 - work in in a roblox game like certain
00:49 - use cases so let's get straight into it
00:52 - so I've got a rocket here credit two
00:56 - darkened and an eternity by the way for
01:01 - the model which are found in the toolbox
01:04 - this rocket we're gonna make it go to
01:07 - space okay and what we want to do is we
01:11 - want to only launch this rocket
01:14 - if a player knows the code okay so only
01:18 - certain players will be able to launch
01:20 - it so you'll need you need the code now
01:23 - what we'll do now we've already got the
01:25 - script to launch the rocket okay it's
01:27 - somewhere in this model but we're not
01:29 - gonna learn how to actually you know get
01:32 - into the scripting of launching a rocket
01:33 - but I've set this rocket up so that this
01:36 - value called launcher if we just change
01:39 - it to true or false it doesn't matter if
01:41 - we just change it change its value then
01:44 - the rocket will all lift off okay so
01:47 - what I've got here in our local scripts
01:49 - in this rocket launch GUI I've got a
01:52 - text box and a tap and a text button
01:55 - called launch button so when the user
01:57 - inputs their their code in this box okay
02:01 - and then they click launch we're going
02:04 - to launch this rocket but we've got a
02:06 - check to see whether the code is crew
02:08 - now we'll go into this local script and
02:11 - this is what I currently have now there
02:13 - are a couple of issues with this code
02:15 - the first issue is that because we are
02:19 - trying to fire the rocket from the
02:22 - client and we have failed to enable
02:24 - turned on these we're going to we're
02:26 - going to make this change on the server
02:28 - in the workspace but this change is only
02:31 - gonna it's only going to change for us
02:33 - okay because the server is going to see
02:36 - that we're trying to change the value of
02:37 - the launcher and then because filter
02:40 - enabled on it will prevent us from
02:42 - making that change okay
02:44 - I explained more about that in the
02:45 - previous video if you haven't checked it
02:47 - out I'll leave a card or put a link in
02:49 - the description so I'll show you if we
02:52 - go into the game here we go
02:57 - I'll just type in the code again 1 3 3 7
03:01 - it says firing rocket so the local
03:04 - script has said it's fired but it's not
03:07 - going anywhere
03:08 - ok and if you go into the rocket model
03:10 - the launch of value is set to true on
03:13 - our end on the client okay but if we
03:16 - head to the server and this is the
03:18 - service copy of the game and this is
03:19 - what we this is what all the other
03:20 - players would have it is it should still
03:23 - be false yeah there we go it's still
03:24 - false ok
03:25 - and it wouldn't launch it would only it
03:29 - would only set the value to be true but
03:32 - because this these scripts that are in
03:34 - the rocket our server scripts and they
03:36 - run on the server the service copy is
03:39 - still set to false so it's not going to
03:41 - go anywhere so we have a problem we
03:43 - can't launch the rocket from the client
03:46 - so we're going to need to use a remote
03:48 - event or a remote function so which one
03:51 - do we use and this brings us to our
03:52 - second problem and this is that we are
03:55 - storing the code to launch the rocket in
03:59 - the local script and this is a really
04:01 - bad thing to do let me just change the
04:04 - text of our text let's here there we go
04:06 - and this is a really bad thing to do
04:09 - because anybody that doesn't know the
04:11 - code if we're storing it in a local
04:13 - script you know that local scripts they
04:16 - run on the players computer ok so the
04:19 - player runs the local script so this
04:21 - means that a player could and produce
04:25 - exploding software to view the local
04:28 - scripts ok and they could see aha the
04:31 - code is 1 3 3 7 and now they know what
04:33 - it is ok so that's what we don't want we
04:36 - don't want players to be able to exploit
04:38 - the game to find out what the code is so
04:41 - we're going to need to store the code on
04:44 - the server this is because if we store
04:46 - it on the server in a server script
04:49 - which runs on the server clients don't
04:51 - have access to to to those scripts ok so
04:56 - we're gonna have a script in server
04:58 - script service ok and we're also going
05:01 - to need a remote function but why do we
05:04 - need a remote function and not a remote
05:05 - event well
05:08 - I said a remote function returns
05:10 - information back to the client once we
05:13 - have triggered that remote function so
05:16 - an example would be if we put in the
05:18 - wrong code and then we checks whether
05:20 - the code was correct on the server if it
05:23 - was correct then we would launch the
05:25 - rocket on the server and then we could
05:27 - send information or message back to the
05:31 - local script to say that it was a
05:33 - success and then we could set the text
05:36 - of our textbox to say success launching
05:39 - rockets but if the code was wrong we
05:42 - could send a message from the server to
05:44 - the client saying that it was an
05:45 - incorrect code and that way we could
05:48 - display on the screen to our player that
05:51 - the code was wrong
05:51 - and they need to try again okay so the
05:54 - first thing we're going to tackle is
05:56 - checking whether the code is correct on
05:59 - the server and actually firing the
06:02 - rocket on the server so let's get rid of
06:04 - this if statement here and instead we're
06:09 - going to find our remote function now if
06:11 - you haven't got a remote function in
06:12 - your game yet click on the plus in
06:13 - replicating storage and then just type
06:15 - out remote function and just add one in
06:18 - there okay we're good at widget and keep
06:20 - it named right function because it's the
06:22 - only one we have in a in our game so
06:24 - we're gonna say at game don't replicate
06:26 - the storage dot remote function and then
06:29 - what we're going to do is instead of
06:31 - saying fire server we're going to invoke
06:35 - it okay so yeah if you want to trigger a
06:38 - remote function we say we invoke it so
06:42 - we say : invoke server now what we're
06:45 - gonna do we need to pass our data to the
06:48 - server we need to tell the server what
06:51 - the client has inputted okay into the
06:53 - textbox and that will be the code
06:55 - obviously so as a parameter we're going
06:58 - to send to the server the contents of
07:01 - our textbox okay because the server
07:03 - actually can't access anything in the
07:05 - player GUI so we need to send that to to
07:09 - the server okay
07:11 - so we've put that as a parameter and
07:14 - that data is going to be sent to the
07:16 - server so now let's go into our server
07:18 - script and actually script how we're
07:21 - going to pick up this request okay this
07:24 - this invoke so in our server scripts
07:27 - let's just put service script here so
07:29 - you know what we're in so scripts and
07:32 - we'll do the same local scripts okay in
07:37 - our service script we are going to set
07:40 - up a listener okay
07:42 - similar to an event listener it's
07:45 - actually what I'm gonna bind our remote
07:49 - function so whenever that gets triggered
07:51 - we're gonna bind it to a function called
07:55 - a callback function I'm explain what one
07:57 - of those is soon so firstly we're gonna
07:59 - say game dot replicated storage dot
08:02 - remote function we put it in replicator
08:04 - storage so it can be viewed by both the
08:07 - server and the client so game don't
08:10 - replicate storage dot remote function
08:11 - now because we've invoked it from the
08:13 - client I'm picking it up on the server
08:15 - we just say dot on server invoke so when
08:19 - the server is invoked because on on the
08:22 - client we said invoke server so on
08:25 - server invoke what we do instead of
08:27 - saying : Connect we just say equals
08:30 - function okay and we create a function
08:34 - just as you would in in a normal script
08:37 - if you're making a function to run code
08:38 - now this is called we're binding it to a
08:43 - function
08:43 - so whenever a whenever the remote event
08:46 - is invoked we bind it to this function
08:49 - and any code inside of this function
08:51 - will run whenever we invoke the server
08:54 - invoke that remote event now we've got
08:57 - our arguments the arguments are the data
09:01 - which we pass through the parameters
09:03 - remember we passed our code which the
09:06 - user inputted but we also passed the we
09:10 - also pass the name of the player
09:12 - automatically roblox passes that for us
09:14 - and we don't need to write it in our
09:16 - local script it just automatically pasts
09:18 - but the player comes always comes first
09:21 - on server so it will put our player in
09:23 - first our player argument and you can
09:26 - call these arguments whatever you want
09:27 - so it could be PLR it could be player
09:30 - player you could even say dog but we're
09:33 - gonna say player because that just makes
09:34 - the most sense and then the second one
09:36 - obviously it's going to be our code
09:38 - which they have inputted and that code
09:40 - is going to correspond to textbox dot
09:43 - text okay so now we've got our arguments
09:46 - what we need to do is we need to check
09:49 - to see whether the code is correct okay
09:52 - so we can just say if the code is equal
09:56 - to and then we're going to do a string
09:59 - okay because the text box text is always
10:02 - a string okay if even if it's a number
10:04 - that number is going to be in a string
10:05 - so the code which you want the player to
10:10 - use to launch the rocket you're going to
10:11 - put in here so we could put one three
10:14 - three seven I'm going to change it to
10:15 - one three three seven move just to be
10:18 - different so if the code is equal to one
10:21 - three three seven noob
10:22 - don't forget the two equal signs by the
10:23 - way because it's an if statement so if
10:25 - that is their correct code then we're
10:28 - gonna drop a line make sure that end is
10:30 - added in and then what we can do is we
10:33 - can launch the rocket by saying game dot
10:36 - work space dot rocket model and then we
10:39 - can say a dot launcher dot value equals
10:44 - true okay and again we only just setting
10:48 - it setting the launch of value because
10:49 - there are other scripts in this rocket
10:51 - which which will cause it to take off
10:53 - and what we've done here we've just
10:55 - launched the rocket and we can just do a
10:58 - print to say rocket launched so what
11:02 - we've done so far is the exact same as a
11:05 - remote event we have we have invoked it
11:09 - and fired it as we would with the remote
11:11 - event and we've picked up on the server
11:13 - and we've launched it now if we head
11:15 - into the game and we put in a different
11:19 - code it's not nothing's happening okay
11:22 - but if we put in one three three seven
11:24 - noob
11:26 - you can see it's started to shut the
11:29 - door and launch and if we head into the
11:32 - rocket model not only is it true the
11:35 - value is true for us on the client but
11:37 - it's also true on the server so all
11:41 - clients and the server will be seeing
11:43 - the same thing because they're launching
11:45 - of the rocket and the the setting of
11:48 - this fire too true has been done on the
11:50 - server in a server script this one here
11:52 - because it's been invoked by a remote
11:55 - function and the code was already
11:58 - written ok there we go we're going off
12:00 - in our rocket the code is already
12:01 - written in this script and we were just
12:04 - waiting for the remote function to be
12:05 - invoked by the client and so we've done
12:10 - exactly the same as a remote event but I
12:13 - told you that with the remote function
12:16 - we can return information back to the
12:18 - local script if you're not gonna return
12:19 - information back you might as well just
12:21 - use remote event but we're going to
12:22 - return back whether the code that they
12:26 - entered was the right one or if it was
12:28 - incorrect so if the code is equal to 1 3
12:31 - 3 7 noob then at the end of our at the
12:35 - end of this if statement just before the
12:37 - the end we're gonna say return and this
12:40 - is how we send messages back send
12:42 - information back you say return and the
12:45 - the data that comes after return gets
12:48 - sent back to the local script ok so we
12:50 - could return true ok if it was a success
12:54 - else if the code is wrong then we could
12:57 - return false ok it doesn't matter what
13:00 - you return you could return a string
13:02 - saying true or you could say return you
13:05 - could return correct code it's up to you
13:08 - you could write you could return
13:09 - anything but we're just gonna do true or
13:12 - false for now ok so we're returning that
13:15 - to our local script and it's going to
13:18 - send either true or false back to the
13:20 - local script here ok so returning just
13:23 - means to to send back a value in this
13:26 - case so we're sending back the value
13:28 - true or false to the local script so how
13:31 - do we pick up what we've returned ok
13:34 - we're back in our local script and I'm
13:36 - saying that you can return things but
13:38 - how do we actually get that information
13:40 - well what we do is we take this line of
13:43 - code the invoke invoke server and we're
13:46 - going to set it as a variable okay
13:48 - so local and then I'm gonna call it
13:51 - result so the result is what's going to
13:53 - be returned back so the result is equal
13:55 - to replicate storage remote function
13:58 - invoked server okay and when we do
14:01 - return something say it was returned to
14:04 - true then result would actually equal
14:07 - true okay so the the value that we
14:10 - return basically replaces this line of
14:13 - code okay
14:14 - the invoke server basically recently
14:17 - will return whether it's true or false
14:19 - and then if the result will either be
14:22 - equal to true or equal to false and just
14:24 - to prove this if we say print result
14:27 - here alright and we go and try again
14:32 - and we put in 1 337 new and click launch
14:37 - you can see it returned true but if we
14:39 - just type in something different it
14:41 - returns false okay so its return true or
14:44 - false and then it's been set as the
14:46 - results of variable and there we go it's
14:48 - printed it out so now we can do an if
14:52 - statement to say if results is equal to
14:55 - true then we could say launch button
14:58 - text is equal to success just 1 equals
15:03 - their else if it's if it's not true it's
15:08 - gonna be false we could say launch
15:10 - button text you cause it fail ok and do
15:15 - the same thing again we'll play the game
15:18 - we put in 1 3 3 says fail but if we do 1
15:22 - 3 3 7 new again it says success so it's
15:27 - just it's firing back a value to the
15:29 - local script from this from this server
15:31 - to basically say whether it was whether
15:34 - it was a success or not ok now this is
15:36 - only one use case for a remote function
15:39 - ok you can return back any data so let's
15:42 - say you had a load of items that in a
15:45 - shop which have stored on the server you
15:47 - could return back a table with
15:49 - information about those items like the
15:51 - name from the price and the the object
15:54 - if you wanted to use it like a viewport
15:56 - frame and I'll be making more videos on
15:58 - how that works with a remote function
16:01 - and in the future I do have some videos
16:03 - which do already use remote functions
16:06 - for things like shops such as my sword
16:09 - fight game series with a shop or the
16:11 - mining simulator shop on my channel but
16:14 - you don't have to return true or false
16:16 - again you could return success or you
16:20 - could return epic fail ok and you could
16:25 - say in the local script if result is
16:27 - equal to success as a string don't
16:30 - forget because we returned it as a
16:32 - string datatype because of those speech
16:34 - marks else if result is equal to epic
16:37 - fail
16:39 - then again it would say fail okay so
16:42 - that is how a remote function works okay
16:46 - it's the same as remote events okay it
16:49 - does an action on the server when you
16:50 - call it from a local script but the only
16:52 - difference is that a remote function
16:55 - will return some data to the local
17:01 - script if you're not returning any data
17:02 - use if you're not planning to use a
17:05 - remote event if you're planning on
17:07 - returning something back to the to the
17:10 - local script though like whether it was
17:12 - a success or not or also another example
17:14 - is if you're trying to buy something
17:16 - okay you always want to do the checking
17:20 - to see if they have enough money or
17:22 - deducting the money on the server so
17:25 - that can't be exported and then if the
17:27 - player doesn't have enough money you can
17:28 - return back to the local script to say
17:30 - that they haven't got enough or if they
17:32 - do have enough money you could return
17:34 - back saying it was a success and that
17:35 - they now have the item so if you aren't
17:38 - returning user remote events and also I
17:42 - need to tell you this a remote function
17:44 - yields okay yields okay that was pretty
17:47 - hard to say yields okay if you didn't
17:51 - know what I said
17:51 - yields okay what that means is if it
17:54 - yields then nothing nothing else in this
17:57 - local script is going to run until you
18:00 - have returned a value okay so if we
18:02 - called the right function here the local
18:05 - scripts going to stop until all of the
18:08 - code has been executed in the sell
18:11 - script until you've returned something
18:13 - okay so the script the local script
18:16 - won't continue until you have got
18:19 - something returned from the remote
18:22 - function okay and that's why
18:26 - the success text we're checking to see
18:30 - if resolve was equal to success but you
18:32 - can't do this if statement until you
18:34 - have something returned to your result
18:36 - value like a true or false value so
18:39 - remote function invokes server it yields
18:42 - and that just means that the script will
18:44 - stop at this line until something is
18:47 - returned back to the local scripts
18:48 - whereas a remote event wouldn't because
18:51 - it never returns anything okay
18:54 - so that is all for this video thanks for
18:57 - watching and I'll see you in another one
18:59 - if you have any suggestions filtering
19:01 - enabled content etc leave them in the
19:04 - comments down below I read them all and
19:07 - I'll take on your your feedback and your
19:10 - ideas if I can don't forget to use
19:13 - crater code album blocks when you buy
19:15 - Road books or builder's club don't
19:18 - forget to subscribe
19:19 - turn on the notification bow and again
19:21 - I'll see you guys in the next one thanks
19:23 - for watching
