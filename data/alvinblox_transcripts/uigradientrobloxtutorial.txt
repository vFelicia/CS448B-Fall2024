00:00 - so a new feature has been added to
00:01 - roblox this week the UI gradient and
00:04 - what it does is it applies a gradient
00:06 - effect to your GUI elements kind of like
00:09 - in Photoshop or paint on that other
00:11 - image editing applications where you can
00:14 - apply not only a solid color but
00:16 - actually multiple colors which fade into
00:19 - each other in a UI element you can now
00:22 - do that with this UI gradient feature so
00:24 - to add a UI gradient you just need to
00:27 - select the elements in the UI that you
00:30 - want to add it to so you can add it to
00:32 - things such as a frame image button
00:34 - image label viewport frame text label
00:38 - and text button so if you just need to
00:40 - click on the frame or the element click
00:42 - on the plus and then search for the UI
00:45 - gradient now once you've inserted that
00:47 - you can change the appearance property
00:50 - sorry the color property under
00:52 - appearance and if you just click on it
00:54 - and then click on the three dots to the
00:56 - side here you have a color sequence
00:58 - editor and you might have seen this
01:00 - before in particle emitters basically
01:03 - allows you to add colors in a row here
01:07 - and they will it will basically be the
01:10 - gradient so you can have as many colors
01:12 - as you like just keep clicking to add
01:14 - different time points or areas of the
01:16 - gradient and then for each little point
01:18 - here if you click the arrow and the
01:20 - arrow goes yellow you can select the
01:22 - color property and add a color for that
01:24 - point and the color will last until you
01:27 - reach the next point so you can drag it
01:29 - out if you want the color to last for a
01:32 - longer time or longer for a bigger
01:35 - portion of the frame and then for the
01:37 - next few point use change the colors you
01:40 - have different colors here so I'm going
01:41 - to do an orange and then more into a
01:43 - going into a yellow color then we can
01:46 - have a green
01:49 - like this and then a blue and darker
01:54 - blue
01:56 - then we're gonna do a pink and you can
01:59 - see that this is turning into the colors
02:00 - of the rainbow I'll finish it off with
02:03 - let's do a darker like a pink like this
02:06 - more like a violet okay so there we go
02:08 - and you can see now that we've got all
02:10 - of the colors in this UI gradient I can
02:13 - move them around if I want to change the
02:14 - gradient a little bit once you're done
02:16 - with that you can click on close here
02:18 - and there are also some other properties
02:21 - that you can play around with we've got
02:22 - offset here so you can add an X or Y
02:24 - offset and that will change it quite a
02:28 - lot here let's just change let's do it
02:30 - let's do not point one there we go one
02:34 - two
02:34 - okay so yeah I would do not point to
02:36 - sorry zero to one so a number from zero
02:39 - to one and it's I think it's like how
02:42 - much the gradient is is where it starts
02:46 - from so you can see it's actually
02:47 - starting from no point there were two
02:51 - tenths so of the way through the frame
02:52 - which we changed it to no point five
02:54 - then the red would probably start from
02:55 - halfway through yeah there we go
02:57 - so kind of just that moves the point
02:59 - where the gradient starts and you can do
03:01 - that same thing for the y-axis as well
03:03 - like this but you can't really see that
03:06 - because this is currently on the x-axis
03:08 - and it's it's a horizontal gradient but
03:10 - you can change the rotation in degrees
03:12 - as well just like you can rotate a grade
03:15 - apart you can rotate the gradient like
03:17 - this so lots of things to play around
03:19 - with here very cool effect as well I've
03:22 - only just been playing around with it
03:23 - but I thought I'd let you guys know
03:25 - about it so let me know what you think
03:27 - let me know what you make with it there
03:29 - are loads of different use cases for and
03:30 - you can also edit the gradient with a
03:33 - script so you can make it moving
03:34 - gradients or things like that so I'll
03:36 - link a dev forum post for you below
03:38 - where you can find out more about the UI
03:40 - gradient very very cool indeed and yeah
03:43 - there you go thanks for watching
