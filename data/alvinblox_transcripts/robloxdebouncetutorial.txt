00:00 - if you want to learn how to use debounce
00:03 - in roblox to do to stop a function from
00:06 - running too many times like this then
00:09 - you're gonna want to make sure that you
00:11 - watch all of this video all the way to
00:12 - the end so you don't miss our and
00:14 - anything let's get started
00:17 - [Music]
00:21 - all right so welcome back to another
00:23 - video my name is Ivan blocks and today
00:25 - we're gonna be learning how to use D
00:27 - bounce now if you don't know what D
00:29 - bounce is it stops a script from running
00:32 - a certain function multiple times in a
00:35 - certain span of time so for example each
00:37 - time I got to step on this brick it's
00:40 - gonna print brick was touched in the
00:42 - output but you see as I walk around the
00:44 - brick you can see that it keeps printing
00:46 - it hour you can see we've got the
00:47 - multiplication sign next to how many
00:49 - times it has printed and what if I only
00:52 - wanted it to run the code once only once
00:55 - every 5 seconds so that it wouldn't spam
00:58 - this function all the time and it
01:00 - wouldn't keep printing it all the time
01:02 - well there's a very cool way to get
01:04 - around this and it's called D bounce so
01:05 - let's go and have a look at it now so
01:08 - I've got this script here and when I
01:11 - step on the brick we've got a touched
01:12 - event and it's going to print brick was
01:15 - touched what if I only want this to run
01:17 - once for example you may want to use D
01:20 - bounce on a weapon because you might not
01:22 - want people to be able to spam click the
01:25 - weapon and have lots of projectiles
01:28 - going from the rocket in in short amount
01:30 - of time because you want to have a
01:31 - reload time so this is where we use D
01:33 - bounce we use it mostly in touched
01:35 - events because when you touch a brick
01:38 - when you touch a part in roblox and see
01:40 - we've got our a player here now we've
01:44 - got two legs okay and it could either
01:46 - beat the left leg or the right leg which
01:48 - touches it or the head could touch it or
01:51 - one of our arms you can see we've
01:52 - touched it here arm just touched it but
01:54 - our leg touches it now so we can have a
01:57 - lot of different body parts touching and
01:58 - setting off this event at once so we
02:00 - only wanted to run one time so we don't
02:03 - have duplicates running which could the
02:05 - lag our game or possibly cause it to
02:07 - break if we're adding too many things
02:09 - into our character for example say you
02:12 - wanted to add value into your character
02:14 - when you stepped on the brick and it
02:16 - added tons of values in because you kept
02:18 - touching it and you only wanted one that
02:19 - could break your game so that's why we
02:21 - use D bounce so when we step on this
02:24 - brick this touched event is going to run
02:27 - so how do we only stop it how do we stop
02:30 - it from only running multiple times how
02:32 - are you how do we make it run once was a
02:34 - simple
02:35 - a way to do this by doing debounce and
02:37 - we need a variable at the top of our
02:39 - script this is gonna check whether we've
02:41 - already touched the brick on up so we're
02:42 - gonna call this variable D bats local
02:46 - debounce equals false now you can call
02:49 - it whatever you want but I'm gonna call
02:51 - it D bats just so that it makes sense
02:53 - and we can understand what it means so
02:55 - when this block is touched we're going
02:59 - to set the the-- bounce value to true so
03:03 - we're gonna say d bounce equals true
03:05 - okay so when they step on it the
03:07 - debounce variable is gonna be true so
03:09 - when it's true we're going we're
03:11 - basically going to know that the brick
03:13 - has been stepped on if it's false we
03:15 - know that the brick has not been stepped
03:17 - on okay and after a number of seconds we
03:20 - can set it back to false and when it's
03:22 - false we're going to make it so that we
03:24 - can run the script again so we're going
03:27 - to then drop a line and we're gonna say
03:29 - white and we're gonna put a number
03:32 - inside of here so let's do five seconds
03:34 - okay now what we need to do is add an if
03:37 - statement and before we do that we're
03:39 - just gonna set D bounce back to false so
03:43 - we now need to have our if statement
03:45 - which will check if D bounce is false or
03:48 - if it's truth so to do this at the top
03:51 - of our events or just inside of it above
03:54 - the first D bounce equals true we're
03:57 - gonna say if not D bounce then and then
04:02 - at the end of the scripts we're going to
04:04 - write end and we're just going to select
04:06 - all of the code inside the if statement
04:08 - and indent it so we're checking if D
04:12 - bounce is not false okay so if D bounce
04:16 - is true this means that the brick has
04:20 - already been touched and and we can't
04:24 - run the script but if if not debounce
04:26 - means that it is false so if the bounce
04:29 - is false means hasn't been touched then
04:31 - we can set D bounce to truth we can make
04:35 - the code run and we can wait five
04:37 - seconds until we set it back to false
04:39 - and if someone tries to step on this
04:41 - brick again they're going to hit this if
04:43 - statement and because we set it to true
04:45 - already and they're they're touching it
04:47 - again
04:48 - debounce is going to be true and so we
04:50 - can't ruin the if statement so it's not
04:52 - going to do anything it's gonna register
04:54 - the touch but it's not going to do this
04:56 - print because we've set the debounce to
04:59 - true and after the five seconds we're
05:01 - gonna set it back to false and so when
05:03 - it runs again when it loops again after
05:05 - five seconds we're gonna be able to
05:07 - print the brick was touched again okay
05:10 - so let's go and test this out I'm gonna
05:12 - click on play and we're just going to
05:14 - clear the output now let's just run over
05:16 - here to the brick I'm going to step on
05:19 - it
05:20 - MC says brick was touched and you see it
05:23 - didn't print multiple times it didn't
05:24 - have that x and then number next to it
05:27 - so it's only printed once and the five
05:29 - seconds have passed the debounce how the
05:31 - debounce variables go back to false so
05:33 - now when we step on it again we're gonna
05:35 - hit this if statement which says if
05:37 - debounce is equal to false so if not
05:40 - debounce means if debounce is false
05:42 - which it is we're gonna set the debounce
05:44 - to true so that if we touch it again
05:47 - it's not going to pass through it's just
05:49 - going to get out of the if statement and
05:52 - it's going to print that the brick was
05:54 - touched all right let's go and test this
05:56 - out and there we go we've got brick was
05:58 - touched now if we wait five seconds and
06:00 - stay on the brick you can see it's gone
06:03 - two times three and every five seconds
06:05 - if we move again it will just keep going
06:08 - up in ones because we've got that
06:10 - debounce stopping us from touching the
06:13 - brick multiple times now if we if we
06:15 - were to get rid of this debounce if we
06:17 - just got rid of the if statement and the
06:19 - whole variable and the wait you'll see
06:22 - if we go back and step on the brick
06:24 - let's go and clear the output and stand
06:27 - on here you can see it's printing
06:29 - multiple times and we and this is why we
06:31 - use debounce
06:32 - we use debounce to only register a
06:36 - function or touch once now you can use
06:39 - it in lots of other events such as when
06:41 - you click a button you're only allowed
06:42 - to click it once when you fire a rocket
06:44 - and you can learn more about events in
06:46 - my event video the card will be in the
06:48 - top right of the screen about now
06:50 - alright so let us go over this once more
06:53 - so let's just get our debounce script
06:55 - back and so we've got our debounce
06:58 - variable we're sitting that's false
07:00 - so when debounce is false we should be
07:02 - to run the code and when it's true we
07:04 - won't be able to run it so we're gonna
07:07 - do here in this variable I'm gonna say
07:10 - if it isn't pressed so if not means the
07:12 - opposite of deep true so false
07:15 - so if d-bus is false then we can set the
07:19 - bounce to true so that if we set off the
07:21 - script again it's not going to set off
07:24 - this if statement and the code won't run
07:26 - again
07:26 - until five seconds later when it's set
07:29 - to false down here so that was a simple
07:32 - tutorial on how to use the bouncing
07:34 - robots to do if you enjoyed it please
07:36 - smash that like button please click the
07:38 - subscribe button if you want to see more
07:39 - videos from me and don't forget to click

07:44 - always notified a while I post a new
07:46 - video deserve them lots telling you to
