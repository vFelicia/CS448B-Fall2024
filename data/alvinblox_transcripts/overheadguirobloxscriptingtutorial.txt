00:00 - in today's video I'm going to show you
00:02 - how to make an overhead progress bar GUI
00:06 - in Roblox so the first thing you're
00:07 - going to want to do is design the
00:09 - billboard GUI and to do this we're going
00:11 - to insert a part which we'll use to show
00:14 - our billboard and inside that part we'll
00:16 - insert a billboard GUI and then we're
00:18 - going to insert a frame now before we go
00:20 - any further let's click on the billboard
00:22 - GUI and in the properties panel we're
00:25 - going to set the size to 4
00:28 - 020 okay and this should make make a
00:30 - nice rectangle shape and then what we'll
00:32 - do is we want our frame which you might
00:35 - see here to fill the entirety of our GUI
00:38 - so we'll set the size to 1 comma
00:41 - 1 then what we'll do is we will just go
00:45 - back to our size I'm going to alter it
00:47 - very slightly to be 5 comma 0
00:51 - 1.5 like this and then we want to make
00:54 - it appear above the parts because when
00:56 - the billboard is in the player's head
00:58 - object we want it to be of the head not
01:00 - on the head so we're going to go to
01:02 - studs offset World space and we're going
01:05 - to set this to 0 comma 5 comma 0 feel
01:09 - free to play around with this I'm going
01:10 - to set it to 0 comma 3 comma 0 so it's
01:13 - three studs above the part then I'm
01:16 - going to insert a text label into our
01:19 - frame I'm going to set the size to 1
01:21 - comma 1 to fill the entirety of that
01:23 - frame I'm going to scroll down make sure
01:26 - that text scaled is selected and I'm
01:28 - going to set the font face to fredoka 1
01:31 - but again you can change this to your
01:34 - preference I'm going to change the color
01:36 - to be a nice blue as well once we've
01:38 - done that I'm going to select the text
01:40 - label and the frame together I'm going
01:42 - to scroll up and I'm going to set the
01:43 - background transparency to one and if
01:46 - you wish you can click on the text label
01:48 - click on the plus and insert a UI stroke
01:51 - I'm going to set the thickness and I'm
01:53 - going to change the color to a dark
01:58 - blue let's see yeah that looks good okay
02:01 - so now that we've set up our overhead
02:03 - GUI I'm going to give it a name I'm just
02:05 - going to call it overhead GUI and this
02:08 - is going to go into server storage okay
02:12 - now we can script this so we want this
02:14 - to appear when the player joins the game
02:16 - so in server script service let's insert
02:19 - a script and we're going to create a
02:21 - player added event which will fire when
02:23 - a new player joins the game now we can
02:26 - use the player argument which gets
02:28 - passed to us from this event to create a
02:30 - character added event because we need to
02:32 - listen out for when their character is
02:34 - loaded so that we can access things like
02:36 - their head to put the billboard
02:39 - into now that we've got the character
02:41 - all we need to do is find our overhead
02:44 - GUI by saying game server storage.
02:47 - overhead GUI and make a clone of it and
02:50 - then we'll just make this a variable as
02:55 - well and then we can parent it to the
02:59 - play players's
03:01 - head and then we can set the text of the
03:04 - overhead GUI by saying overhead GUI
03:08 - frame. text label. text equals and then
03:11 - you can put whatever text you want you
03:13 - could put VIP you could put player. name
03:17 - um and this is the point where if you
03:19 - want to put VIP or something you would
03:23 - do your check to see if they own a Game
03:25 - Pass right you would you would do some
03:26 - kind of check like has Game Pass equals
03:29 - game get Service Marketplace
03:33 - service um user owns game pass a sync
03:36 - player. user ID and you'd put your game
03:38 - pass ID in here right and then you'd say
03:41 - something like has Game Pass and VIP or
03:47 - no text at all okay so that's how you
03:49 - would do something like a a VIP Game
03:51 - Pass for a tag same thing goes for if
03:54 - they're in a group you would do the same
03:56 - thing and you'd probably want to do this
03:58 - as an if statement so you'd want to say
04:01 - if has Game Pass then the text will be
04:08 - this else perhaps if in group then you
04:13 - would set the text to say group member
04:16 - you get the idea okay um so all you'd
04:19 - need is some kind of variable which does
04:21 - the relevant check to see if the player
04:23 - has a game pass or if they're in a group
04:26 - which would again look something like
04:28 - this group surface group
04:30 - service um I don't know if this actually
04:33 - exists let me have a look I think it's
04:35 - actually uh
04:37 - players is in group
04:40 - no ah it is
04:44 - player player is in group like
04:47 - this uh and then you put the group ID so
04:50 - yeah this is how it would work okay
04:54 - um I'm just wondering why is there a Red
04:58 - Line underneath this text
05:03 - uh oh yes it would need to see it would
05:06 - need to be else if not else so that is
05:09 - how you would do conditional checks like
05:11 - that but I'm just going to set the uh
05:15 - the text to just just say the player's
05:18 - name like this for Simplicity so we'll
05:21 - just get rid of these lines and we'll
05:24 - just reformat the script so that
05:26 - everything's
05:28 - organized and and so this should work
05:33 - let's give it a
05:34 - try now you might notice uh if you're
05:38 - overhead GUI doesn't load you might want
05:40 - to do a little delay just to make sure
05:43 - that the head has actually been um
05:47 - spawned because sometimes this can run
05:50 - slightly too early hence why I like to
05:52 - have a task. weight in there uh just to
05:54 - make sure it has time to appear like
05:57 - this but then you're pretty much good to
05:58 - go with your over over head GUI and if
06:01 - you want it to appear a little bit
06:03 - brighter then you can go into your
06:04 - overhead GUI and you can change the
06:08 - light influence you can also set is on
06:11 - top so that it doesn't get covered or
06:13 - obstructed by any other objects in the
06:15 - world for example if we just were to I
06:19 - can't show you if I was to walk in front
06:21 - of the um spawn here you can see it
06:24 - overlaps the spawn part it doesn't get
06:26 - uded by that uh and then you've also got
06:30 - of course the text properties so you
06:32 - could insert a UI gradient you could
06:35 - change the text the color of the text
06:37 - you could do all sorts but that was how
06:38 - to make a very simple overhead GUI in
06:41 - Roblox if you enjoyed it please like the
06:44 - video please subscribe let me know any
06:46 - other video topics you'd like me to
06:47 - cover and I'll see you in the next one
06:49 - thanks for watching
