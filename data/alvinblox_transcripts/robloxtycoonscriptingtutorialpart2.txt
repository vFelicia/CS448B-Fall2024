00:01 - okay so last time we set up our plots
00:03 - for our Tycoon and we successfully
00:06 - managed to give a specific plot to a
00:09 - player who joined the game uh so now we
00:11 - need to give the player the ability to
00:14 - buy stuff uh and that's usually done by
00:17 - buttons so I'm going to show you how to
00:20 - do that in this video so firstly we're
00:22 - going to need a button uh and we're
00:23 - keeping things quite simple in this
00:25 - series so I'm just going to insert a
00:27 - part to be our template button okay I'm
00:29 - going to make it red and I'm going to
00:31 - make it slightly squared like this okay
00:34 - as long as you've got a part it's fine
00:35 - it's no real um issue what whatever it
00:38 - looks like so I'm just going to use this
00:41 - okay and uh I'm just going to call it a
00:44 - button okay now some of you might have a
00:48 - button which is a model it's going to
00:51 - vary of course um but I'll show you how
00:54 - we can work with models or or other sort
00:57 - of types of Parts later on but for now
00:59 - I'm I'm just going to use a simple
01:00 - button so I'm going to go to the
01:03 - properties panel and I'm going to make
01:04 - sure that it is anchored okay and make
01:07 - sure that can Collide is also true
01:09 - doesn't really matter but it will just
01:11 - give you that nice satisfying effect
01:13 - when you walk on the button and you step
01:14 - on it uh and once that's done then
01:17 - that's pretty much it um the only thing
01:19 - we're going to have to do is give it a
01:21 - tag down here in the tags area so click
01:24 - on the plus and just type
01:27 - button okay so that is all good
01:30 - next thing we want to do is we want to
01:33 - put it in a special place so I'm just
01:36 - going to put it over here okay and this
01:38 - is going to be the button that buys the
01:40 - very first thing in our Tycoon but what
01:42 - is it going to buy like we need to tell
01:44 - the player what they're going to get if
01:46 - they step on this button so we're going
01:48 - to click on the and I remember you just
01:50 - couldn't see what I just where it just
01:51 - dragged it to my apologies um I've just
01:54 - dragged it to the the corner of my base
01:56 - plate but to make some text on the
01:58 - button to show what they buying we need
02:01 - to go into the Explorer panel click on
02:03 - our button click on the little plus sign
02:05 - and we're going to choose a billboard
02:07 - GUI okay and then inside this billboard
02:11 - GUI we want to insert a text label now
02:15 - you might not see anything appear That's
02:17 - okay what we need to do is we need to go
02:19 - to the Ador property of the billboard
02:22 - GUI and we need to set it to the button
02:25 - firstly uh and then we need to change
02:29 - the SI so I'm going to change it to 1
02:32 - comma 0a 1 comma 0 and now we can start
02:35 - to see it sort of appear um but this is
02:37 - slightly too small so I'm going to just
02:39 - set it to 3 comma 0 comma 3 comma 0 uh
02:43 - and this is sort of getting somewhere um
02:46 - again I'll just zoom out so you can see
02:48 - and I'm just going to zoom back in now
02:50 - to the properties uh panel because we're
02:51 - going to be working here for a little
02:53 - bit of time so don't really worry if you
02:55 - can can't see what's going on um so I'm
02:59 - going to now set the light influence to
03:03 - zero and what this does is it makes it
03:05 - easier to see right it makes it brighter
03:07 - essentially so light influence down to
03:09 - zero and then I'm going to go to my text
03:13 - label inside the Billard GUI and I'm
03:16 - going to set the size property to 1
03:18 - comma 0 comma 1 comma 0 and this is
03:21 - going to make it fill the entire of the
03:23 - billboard GUI we can now set the
03:27 - background transparency to one and that
03:30 - is going to make the background go away
03:33 - and then I'm going to scroll down in the
03:34 - properties window and I'm going to set
03:36 - text scaled to be checked that will make
03:40 - the text bigger we can't see the text
03:42 - just now but we'll get on to that in a
03:44 - moment uh and then uh yeah let's just
03:49 - give it some text so we can just say um
03:51 - stter item for
03:53 - example and you can see it's going into
03:56 - the button so we can again fix that I'm
03:59 - going to change the size of the
04:00 - billboard GUI so I've selected the
04:02 - billboard GUI and I'm going to set the
04:04 - size from
04:05 - 3030 to 30 one Z okay and you can see
04:11 - it's just disappeared again slightly
04:12 - that's okay we're going to change the
04:14 - studs offset World space to 0 comma 3
04:18 - comma 0 and this has moved the text
04:21 - upwards all right so now we can see what
04:26 - our button is going to give us but again
04:28 - I'm not a huge fan of this um font or
04:31 - this color so I'm going to set the text
04:34 - color 3 to White I'm going to set the
04:36 - font face to fredoka 1 and I'm going to
04:41 - insert into my text label a UI
04:45 - stroke okay so I've inserted my UI
04:48 - stroke and I'm going to set the
04:51 - thickness I mean you can set it to
04:52 - whatever you want like there's no
04:54 - there's no right or wrong here um you
04:57 - might see that it's it cuts off here so
04:59 - when I'm going to do is I'm going to go
05:00 - to the text label and I'm going to
05:02 - change the size rather from the first
05:04 - value being one I'm going to set it to
05:07 - 0.95 so it covers 95% of the scale
05:10 - rather than 100% then I'm going to set
05:12 - the position first value to 0.5 and then
05:16 - I'm going to set the Anchor Point to.5
05:18 - comma 0 okay and that should sort that
05:21 - issue out uh again I'm not a huge fan of
05:24 - this uh Black Background so I'm just
05:26 - going to change this to a
05:30 - uh let's go with a let's go with a red
05:33 - right because we've got a red
05:34 - button uh and then yeah that's it really
05:37 - we've Now set up our button um and yeah
05:43 - it's good to go there's there's not much
05:44 - else to do
05:46 - here uh so now we actually need to make
05:49 - it work how are we going to do that well
05:51 - firstly we need an item that they can
05:53 - buy so I'm just going to head straight
05:55 - to the toolbox and I'm going to pull
05:57 - something out of free models just to
05:59 - test M with um let's go with
06:03 - um let's go with this missing Noob
06:08 - poster now obviously you got to be
06:10 - careful when you're taking things from
06:11 - the toolbox you never know what could be
06:13 - inside of them um this is just for
06:15 - testing though so you could always just
06:17 - make a part of your own so let's say
06:20 - this button will unlock this poster
06:23 - okay first thing you want to do is you
06:25 - want to position your poster or your
06:27 - item wherever you want it to be so when
06:29 - the player presses the button where do
06:31 - you want this to appear it doesn't have
06:33 - to be necessarily near the button but
06:35 - you know you just got to think about
06:37 - placement so let's say it's going to go
06:39 - on the wall like let's say we have a
06:40 - wall here and this is the ideal place
06:43 - that's fine uh but we now have an item
06:46 - so we need to somehow connect this item
06:49 - to this button so that when we step on
06:52 - this button the game knows ah okay you
06:55 - stepped on this specific button
06:57 - therefore we're going to unlock this
06:59 - specific item and a great way to do this
07:02 - is by having um an identifier system
07:05 - also known as an ID so you give every
07:07 - single item in your game a specific ID
07:10 - and then in every single button you can
07:13 - then um set an attribute just like we
07:15 - did with the plots to say okay you step
07:18 - on this button uh we have saved we've
07:21 - we've logged the ID of the item for this
07:23 - button so now that you've stepped on it
07:25 - we're just going to load it so the first
07:27 - thing to obviously do is set an
07:30 - attribute of this item of this poster so
07:33 - select it in the Explorer then go to the
07:35 - properties and under the attributes
07:38 - section click on the plus a pop-up will
07:41 - appear saying add attribute we want it
07:44 - to be
07:46 - a
07:48 - um we want it to be a number it could be
07:53 - a string but for this video series we're
07:55 - going to make it a number and I'm going
07:56 - to set it to one okay so so since this
08:00 - is the first item it's going to have an
08:01 - IDE of one if you add another item this
08:04 - is really important if you add another
08:06 - item to your game it will be two and
08:09 - then the next one will be three four
08:11 - five 6 7 it's it's really important you
08:14 - don't have two items with the same ID
08:16 - they don't necessarily have to be going
08:18 - in um in order as well like they don't
08:21 - have to go be going up by one every time
08:23 - like the the next item I insert could be
08:26 - 100 as its ID as long as it's unique uh
08:30 - and I say unique because it it it can
08:32 - only be it can only have that one ID
08:35 - like there can only be one ID for every
08:37 - item if you have two items that have the
08:39 - same ID it completely defeats the point
08:41 - because the the idea is that you have a
08:43 - completely unique identifier so you know
08:47 - exactly what you're going to unlock when
08:49 - you step on the button so I've just
08:52 - realized I've done this wrong by the way
08:53 - I've I've named the attribute as as one
08:56 - uh and you need to name it as um ID so
09:00 - click on the rename I'm I'm just going
09:02 - to delete it and do it again so you
09:03 - click on the the Plus for the attribute
09:06 - and then this comes up saying add
09:07 - attribute you want to call it ID right
09:10 - the name should be ID and then the type
09:13 - should be number so I've got a capital I
09:16 - and a lowercase D um that's just how I'm
09:18 - going to format it and the type should
09:20 - be number once you've done that you then
09:22 - set the value of the attribute to one
09:24 - okay and for the next item it would be
09:26 - two three 100 a th000 whatever as long
09:28 - as every single item has a different ID
09:30 - that's just what I'm trying to um get
09:32 - across to you so now that we've set the
09:34 - ID of the actual item we now need to set
09:38 - a value in this sorry an attribute in
09:40 - the button to let it know which item we
09:44 - want to unlock so I'm going to add
09:46 - another attribute in the button make
09:48 - sure the button is selected then go to
09:50 - the properties window and click on the
09:52 - plus add attribute we're going to name
09:55 - this ID of item to unlock
10:00 - okay I formatted it like this with a
10:03 - capital I for ID o for of I for item t
10:07 - for two and U for unlock you get the
10:09 - idea and this is also going to be a
10:12 - number so because I want this button to
10:16 - unlock my poster and the poster has an
10:20 - ID of one I want my ID of item to unlock
10:26 - attribute for the button to also be one
10:31 - and now we've told the game that when we
10:32 - step on this we want to unlock this
10:36 - although we haven't actually done it yet
10:38 - because we need to just do this final
10:39 - part in code so if I go back here and I
10:43 - go to my plot Handler um in fact let's
10:47 - have a look what we've got at the moment
10:49 - so we've got our plot
10:51 - Handler um I'm just thinking on my feet
10:55 - and I'm going to create a separate
10:57 - script I'm going to create another
10:58 - script in server script
11:00 - service um let me just go whoops me go
11:03 - here going to click on plus icon going
11:06 - to click on our script going to go
11:08 - back and what we want to do is we want
11:11 - to get all of the buttons we're just
11:13 - going to do a brief outline of what we
11:14 - want to code so we want to get all of
11:16 - the
11:17 - buttons in the game and when you step on
11:22 - each button we want to unlock the
11:25 - item now at the moment we we don't have
11:30 - we only have one button um we need to
11:33 - make this button appear on a player's
11:37 - plot when they are given a plot because
11:40 - obviously this button is only on one
11:41 - plot for now
11:44 - so what I'm going to do is I'm going
11:47 - to
11:50 - um yeah this this is I'm just thinking
11:53 - here so what we want to do is we want to
11:56 - put this uh button um on a player's plot
12:01 - when they uh are given a plot because at
12:03 - the moment we just set the attribute so
12:06 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
12:07 - take this specific plot um that we're
12:09 - working on at the
12:12 - moment and I'm going to just call it a
12:15 - template plot for now okay and then I'm
12:19 - going to take our button and our model
12:21 - and I'm just going to drag them inside
12:23 - the template plot and then I'm going to
12:25 - create a folder I'm going to create two
12:28 - folders I'm going to create one folder
12:29 - inside this and I'm going to call it
12:31 - buttons and I'm going to create another
12:33 - folder and I'm going to call it items
12:35 - I'm going to drag my model into items
12:37 - and I'm going to drag my button into the
12:39 - buttons and
12:42 - then uh I'm I'm going to drag this
12:44 - outside of the plots folder because it's
12:46 - no longer a plot it's it's a template
12:49 - plot um so I'm just going to move this
12:51 - over here this is just going to be like
12:53 - our our working area where we can design
12:56 - our Tycoon and then um we can just put
13:00 - another plot in its place here okay so
13:02 - so this is now like our working area
13:04 - where we design the Tycoon we put all of
13:07 - the items in place and then what we'll
13:09 - do is when a player joins the game and
13:11 - is given a plot we will um basically
13:15 - clone this and put it you know where
13:17 - everything should be okay but we'll get
13:18 - onto that
13:20 - later um in fact we'll get onto it
13:23 - now so we're going to go into our plot
13:27 - Handler and when we give the player
13:30 - their specific plot uh we want
13:33 - to
13:35 - um we want we want to load the buttons
13:38 - right so um what we'll do is we will go
13:41 - back to our plot
13:43 - Handler and we will say load buttons so
13:47 - what we'll do is we want to firstly get
13:50 - the template plot so local template plot
13:53 - equals game. workspace template plot and
13:57 - then on once we have got the template
14:00 - plot we're going to get the buttons out
14:03 - of the template plot so local buttons so
14:05 - template buttons equals template plot do
14:09 - buttons clone okay and template buttons
14:13 - do parent equals plot so we're cloning
14:17 - out the buttons from the template plot
14:20 - and we're putting them into the new plot
14:22 - that we've just given to the
14:24 - player now only problem
14:26 - is these buttons are going to be over
14:29 - here right say the player is given this
14:31 - plot over there well the buttons are
14:34 - going to be cloned but they're still
14:35 - going to be in this location so how do
14:37 - we move the buttons from here to over
14:41 - here if they're on this plot or what if
14:42 - they're on this plot or this plot or
14:44 - this plot but what we need to do is we
14:46 - need to get the position of the button
14:49 - relative to this plot first so if we
14:52 - were to say okay how far away is this
14:55 - button from the center of the plot and
14:58 - it would probably be something like okay
14:59 - 20 studs in this direction and 30 studs
15:03 - in this direction and then what we can
15:04 - do is we can then take that value all
15:07 - those coordinates and we can say okay
15:09 - well we now want to have it on this plot
15:10 - so we're going to take the center of
15:12 - this plot and we're going to put that
15:14 - specific button 20 studs away on this
15:17 - axis and 30 studs away on this axis so
15:19 - it puts it in the in the same position
15:21 - but just relative to a different plot so
15:24 - to do this we need to go to the plot
15:26 - Handler and we're going to say
15:29 - just before the parenting we're going to
15:31 - go for underscore comma button in
15:35 - template buttons get children do what we
15:40 - want to do is we want to get the
15:42 - position get the position of the button
15:46 - relative to the template plot so this is
15:48 - just another way of saying how far away
15:51 - is the button from the center of the
15:55 - template plot right it could be like 20
15:58 - stud
15:59 - by 30 studs and to do this we will say
16:03 - uh template plot do cframe to object
16:08 - space and yes you need a lowercase T
16:11 - although it doesn't really matter you
16:14 - could do either like this um button dot
16:18 - button.
16:20 - cframe now here's the thing if you had
16:23 - if your button is a model if it's not if
16:26 - so it could it could either be a part or
16:28 - a model but if it's a if it's a part
16:30 - like me you say button. cframe if it's a
16:33 - model you say button colon get pivot
16:36 - with a pair of brackets okay so you do
16:38 - this if it's a model if it's if it's
16:40 - just a part you say button. cframe
16:42 - that's what I was alluding to
16:44 - earlier so we we've got the relative C
16:47 - frame so so relative C frame is the
16:51 - difference between the center of the
16:53 - template plot and where it currently is
16:55 - so it could be 20 studs by 30 studs it's
16:57 - just telling how far away it is from the
17:00 - center and once we know this we can then
17:03 - say button do
17:06 - cframe uh
17:08 - equals
17:09 - um let me just think here plot to World
17:14 - space relative
17:16 - cframe now again if your button is a
17:18 - part you say button. cframe if your
17:21 - button is a model you say button colon
17:24 - Set uh you say pivot 2 and then you put
17:28 - the C frame in Brackets like this so
17:31 - this is for model if it's a part you say
17:34 - button. cframe equals plot to World
17:37 - space relative CF frame now let's see if
17:41 - this works because sometimes it can get
17:44 - confusing and it doesn't work so let's
17:45 - just click on play and see what
17:48 - happens uh okay two World space is not a
17:51 - valid member of part that's because I
17:53 - forgot to say part. cframe
17:57 - so
17:59 - plot.
18:01 - cframe C on to World
18:04 - space okay and click on play
18:08 - again the plot has been given to Alvin
18:11 - blocks so and there's a button over here
18:14 - so this is surely my plot yep there it
18:18 - is so the button is there it's in the
18:21 - exact same place as it is on the other
18:24 - um plots and now um we just need to make
18:27 - it so that when you step on the button
18:29 - it makes the object
18:32 - appear so we're not going to worry about
18:34 - checking if you have enough money just
18:35 - yet but what we'll do is we'll say
18:38 - button. touched colon connect function
18:42 - hit hit is going to be the thing that
18:44 - touched the button firstly we want to
18:47 - check to make sure it's a player uh and
18:49 - I've put this I've put this event to
18:51 - detect when the button has been touched
18:53 - inside this for Loop because it's going
18:55 - to get done to every single button
18:58 - that's in the template so we're going to
19:01 - say first we want to check if it's a
19:02 - player so we can create a variable um
19:05 - which will let us know if the player
19:07 - exists we can say game do players colon
19:10 - get player from character hit do parent
19:13 - and then if it exists then this player
19:16 - variable will be true so we can say if
19:19 - player uh or if not player then return
19:22 - end and that will just kill the function
19:25 - it won't go any further because we don't
19:27 - want to be dealing with anything that
19:28 - isn't a
19:29 - player then we want to actually make
19:31 - sure they own the plot so if um plot
19:38 - colon get
19:41 - attribute
19:43 - owner uh is not equal so you got that
19:46 - little curly line um brace whatever it
19:49 - is uh
19:51 - equals um player do user ID again return
19:55 - end because we don't want to be dealing
19:57 - with this player if they don't own the
19:58 - plot so this means not equal to don't
20:01 - get confused and don't write an equal
20:03 - sign um and so by this point we'll know
20:07 - that yes this is the owner of the plot
20:09 - and I'm just going to add a little Todo
20:11 - that we need to actually remove currency
20:13 - or check if they have
20:15 - enough um which we'll do in a future
20:17 - video but assuming they do we're just
20:20 - going to
20:21 - say uh we want to firstly get the ID of
20:24 - the
20:26 - item which again is another attribute of
20:29 - the button so item to unlock equals uh
20:34 - button get
20:37 - attributes um ID of item to unlock I
20:40 - believe is what we called
20:42 - it yeah ID of item to
20:45 - unlock uh if for some reason this
20:47 - doesn't exist maybe you forgot to add it
20:50 - we can say if not item to unlock then
20:54 - warn you forgot to add an ID of item to
20:59 - unlock attribute CU I bet you'll do that
21:02 - once we'll do a return end just to make
21:05 - sure you don't forget that and finally
21:08 - what we can do is we can find this
21:10 - model in the items folder and we can do
21:14 - the same thing we can position it
21:16 - relative to where it was on template
21:18 - plot um but we're actually going to do
21:21 - that uh I'm just thinking again on my
21:25 - feet yeah so what we're going to do is
21:27 - we're going
21:29 - to um we're going to keep those in the
21:33 - template plot I think and then we'll
21:34 - just move them over when they're needed
21:36 - so when you step on a button so we can
21:40 - get the we can get the template items
21:45 - which is this folder here and we will
21:46 - just store that as
21:49 - variable and then we can say if template
21:54 - items find first child item to unlock
21:59 - uh then no that's not going to work
22:01 - sorry sorry um what we need to do is we
22:04 - need to Loop through this folder until
22:07 - we find the item so for underscore item
22:12 - in template items get children
22:16 - do uh we need to check to see if the
22:19 - item get attribute ID equals the item to
22:24 - unlock I'm going to call this item to
22:26 - unlock ID so that we don't get confused
22:28 - I'm going to update it here and here so
22:31 - if it has the same
22:32 - ID in fact we can say if the ID is not
22:36 - equal to the item to unlock ID then
22:38 - continue end obviously it's the wrong
22:41 - item but if we get to this point in the
22:43 - code we found the correct item so we
22:46 - want to clone it out and reposition it
22:49 - for our for our plot so I'm going to
22:52 - create a variable call it item clone
22:55 - it's going to be item colon clone item
22:59 - clone um parent
23:03 - equals uh plot dot well we'll sort that
23:07 - in a moment um I'm going
23:10 - to create a
23:14 - folder and call it items items folder
23:18 - instance. new folder items folder. name
23:22 - equals items items folder. parent equals
23:26 - plot and then I'm going to the same
23:28 - thing for the buttons I'm going to
23:30 - create a buttons folder just to keep
23:31 - everything organized so just copying and
23:34 - pasting this going to call this one
23:36 - buttons instead of
23:38 - items um and then for our button instead
23:43 - of
23:44 - saying
23:46 - um just a second template buttons get
23:50 - [Music]
23:51 - children
23:56 - um
23:59 - I'm going to say button. parent down
24:01 - here is buttons folder and then I'm
24:04 - going to say item clone. parent equals
24:06 - items folder and now we just need to get
24:09 - the relative C frame again of the item
24:13 - so relative item cframe equals template
24:19 - plot. cframe colon 2 object space iton
24:24 - clone. cframe now here's the important
24:27 - part we could have an item that's a
24:29 - model so I'm going to change this to a
24:32 - variable and I'm going to call it item C
24:34 - frame then going to create the variable
24:36 - item C
24:37 - frame and I'm going to say if item clone
24:41 - is a model then item cframe equals item
24:47 - get pivot Cod on get pivot because you
24:49 - can only get a cframe of a model like
24:52 - this however if the item is a base part
24:58 - then item C frame it's important you say
25:00 - base part as well because it covers
25:02 - things like meshes unions Etc item
25:06 - cframe equals item clone do cframe and I
25:10 - just realized I said item here instead
25:12 - of item
25:13 - clone there we go okay so I know this is
25:17 - getting slightly confusing but we'll go
25:19 - over the code at the end we're nearly
25:21 - there um
25:25 - so now that we have got the I item C
25:28 - frame um whether it's a model or not
25:31 - we've got the relative item C frame so
25:33 - we can then say item
25:36 - clone uh and again we're going to have
25:39 - to do
25:40 - another um check here if item clone is a
25:45 - model
25:47 - then um
25:50 - relative item clone pivot
25:55 - to and we're going to say
25:58 - um template plot do cframe to worldspace
26:03 - relative item
26:06 - cframe and then we need a closing
26:10 - bracket there else if item clone is a
26:14 - base part then item clone.
26:18 - cframe
26:20 - equals this
26:24 - okay okay that should be everything so
26:27 - let's just test this and see if it
26:32 - works think it should
26:36 - work and then we'll just go over the
26:37 - code very quickly at the
26:40 - end so I'm just going to run over to my
26:42 - button okay I'm going to step on the
26:45 - button and nothing seems to have
26:47 - happened so let's do some debugging so
26:50 - I'm going to go into the Explorer
26:51 - firstly I want to know uh is the is the
26:55 - painting actually there so let's go to
26:57 - to the plot let's go to my plot uh so
27:00 - I'm noting we have two buttons folders
27:02 - for some reason um and there are loads
27:06 - of paintings being spawned but they're
27:08 - over there they should be over here um
27:11 - so that
27:13 - suggests that there is something wrong
27:16 - with the oh yes this is my bad so we are
27:23 - basically putting them back in the same
27:24 - place back on the template plot we
27:26 - should be putting them on the plot
27:29 - rather than the template plot and what
27:32 - I'm also going to do is I'm going to
27:34 - create a variable because we're reusing
27:37 - this we're writing the same thing twice
27:38 - so just to make it cleaner I'm going to
27:41 - call this
27:42 - world um world C frame of new
27:46 - plots and I'm going to update this here
27:52 - and here it just looks a lot cleaner
27:55 - like
27:56 - that
27:58 - um and let's just go over the codee once
27:59 - more then so when the um so we we've
28:04 - firstly created uh an items folder and a
28:07 - buttons folder in the plot uh for some
28:09 - reason there was another buttons folder
28:12 - in there I just want to have a look and
28:13 - see why that was the case I think it's
28:15 - because we copied out the buttons folder
28:18 - um directly from the template plot here
28:21 - yeah we did so we don't actually need
28:23 - that this uh brand new buttons folder uh
28:26 - instance new because we're cloning out
28:29 - the the buttons from the template
28:31 - plot um so what we're doing is for every
28:34 - single button we are positioning it on
28:37 - the plot we're getting the relative C
28:40 - frame relative to the template plot so
28:43 - basically saying how far away is the
28:44 - button from the center of the template
28:47 - plot and then we are um putting the
28:50 - button onto the new plot and we're just
28:53 - transforming it by that same relative
28:56 - amount so that that could be 20 studs on
28:58 - the x axis and 20 studs on the Zed axis
29:02 - and so that is just putting it on our
29:03 - new plot then when the button is touched
29:06 - we're firstly making sure this is an
29:08 - actual player and not something else
29:09 - like a brick that might have fallen from
29:11 - the sky and touched the part uh we're
29:13 - making sure that this player is the
29:15 - owner of the plot because we don't want
29:16 - another player buying your own stuff uh
29:20 - we are then getting the corresponding ID
29:23 - of the item which is associated with the
29:25 - button do you remember at the beginning
29:26 - of the video
29:27 - we set up the attributes on both the
29:30 - button and the item which had a
29:32 - corresponding ID so we're getting the
29:34 - items ID from the button here and then
29:39 - we are finding that item in the template
29:42 - items which are still in the template
29:44 - plot and once we found it we are cloning
29:48 - it we are then doing the same thing here
29:51 - as we did with the button in that we're
29:53 - finding how far away it is from the
29:55 - center of the template plot and then we
29:57 - are setting it in the new plot by that
30:01 - amount uh and then finally we are just
30:04 - moving the item to that world space
30:07 - position depending on whether it's a
30:08 - model or a base part because you have to
30:11 - move models differently to how you move
30:14 - base parts and then finally we are
30:16 - putting that item into the items folder
30:19 - which we created for our plot and we
30:21 - have one last thing to fix which is a
30:24 - squiggly Orange Line underneath when we
30:26 - say button. parent equals buttons folder
30:29 - that's because we removed the buttons
30:32 - folder variable
30:35 - and I'm just going to change it to
30:38 - template
30:39 - buttons okay so deep breath that was a
30:42 - lot let's now go back in and see if it
30:44 - was
30:49 - fixed all right let's head over to the
30:51 - button and let's step on the button and
30:53 - there you go our painting has been added
30:55 - into the game so there we go we've just
30:58 - managed to make our button work um I
31:01 - think there might be one more problem
31:03 - with it though which is you can step on
31:05 - it multiple times and loads more
31:07 - paintings get added so we'll just
31:09 - briefly fix that by going back to the
31:11 - plot
31:13 - Handler
31:15 - and uh then we can just
31:18 - say um if button colon get
31:22 - attribute
31:24 - purchased then button
31:28 - uh well in fact what we could just do
31:31 - instead is get ready for this we can
31:34 - just
31:35 - say button colon destroy and that will
31:39 - remove the button so you can't step on
31:41 - it again and then I'm going to go back
31:43 - over to our
31:46 - plot okay I'm going to step on the
31:48 - button there we go we have our model the
31:51 - button has been destroyed and when you
31:52 - look at that there is only one model in
31:55 - the game so there you go um that was a
31:58 - longer video than usual uh the next one
32:01 - should be on your screen if it's out by
32:02 - this time I'll try to keep the other
32:04 - ones shorter but if you're enjoying it
32:05 - so far please do like Please Subscribe
32:07 - share it with a friend of course and
32:10 - I'll see you in the next one
