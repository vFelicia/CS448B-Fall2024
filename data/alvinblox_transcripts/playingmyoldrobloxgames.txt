00:00 - all right in this video i'm gonna play
00:02 - my old roblox game so these are the
00:04 - games
00:05 - that i was creating before i really knew
00:07 - how to script
00:08 - before i was making videos back when i
00:10 - was like eight years old
00:12 - these are the games that i created i'm
00:14 - going to go through them check them out
00:15 - and you'll be able to see
00:17 - uh what went wrong with them so the
00:19 - first game here that we've got
00:20 - is called obi mania and this game is
00:23 - from 2015
00:24 - so 27th of january 2015 i would have
00:27 - been
00:28 - like 12 13 years old at this point
00:32 - so this wasn't my first game but this
00:34 - was a game that i knew i was kind of
00:36 - learning scripting at the same time so
00:39 - you see it's got no thumbnail it says it
00:41 - needs to be updated it may not function
00:43 - correctly
00:44 - so let's go in let's see if it still
00:46 - works
00:47 - and yeah let's jump straight in okay so
00:50 - around was already in progress
00:52 - um when i joined because i just told
00:55 - people to join the game so we have
00:57 - people to play with so not the best
00:58 - start
00:59 - but i'll just teach you how the game
01:01 - works so there's loads of hobby courses
01:04 - i like this one this is called
01:05 - wild west and it's basically the first
01:08 - person to reach the end
01:10 - will win and then if everyone dies like
01:13 - they did in this round
01:14 - uh obviously no one wins but we've got
01:16 - this obby here
01:17 - that's a lobby sorry and get my obby and
01:19 - lobby confused
01:20 - this took me ages to build i remember
01:22 - building this and i had to
01:24 - just get this see this little curve for
01:27 - this practice arena
01:28 - i just spent so much time on that and
01:30 - the i'm kind of impressed with the build
01:32 - to be honest i mean there's still a
01:33 - few issues with like the the build here
01:35 - you can see there's a bit of clashing
01:37 - but
01:37 - this is actually quite a good game uh
01:40 - considering i didn't really know how to
01:41 - script
01:42 - at the time this was before i started my
01:44 - youtube channel and everything this was
01:46 - at the start of 2015 so um
01:49 - for like 12 year old me this is actually
01:52 - quite good in my opinion
01:54 - oh gosh look at all these guys we got
01:56 - completely different gui styles the maps
01:59 - aren't even loading
02:01 - uh i bet this would look horrible on a
02:03 - mobile screen and i can't even vote
02:05 - oh my goodness look at these guys oh no
02:08 - everybody fell out the map
02:10 - oh dear this is this ain't going well at
02:13 - all
02:13 - ah everyone's died i mean nobody
02:16 - the game's just gonna carry on for the
02:18 - next 80 seconds so i might as well just
02:20 - show you
02:21 - uh some other things uh so there's a
02:23 - this section up here in the
02:24 - in the lobby was for like vips
02:27 - so you had to buy the gold membership
02:30 - but
02:31 - if you didn't buy it it would kill you
02:33 - which probably isn't the best thing to
02:35 - do considering that you don't want to
02:36 - kill people
02:37 - it's just because they haven't bought
02:38 - your stuff uh we have so we have the
02:41 - inventory i remember this took me ages
02:42 - to create
02:43 - this inventory like i didn't know how to
02:45 - make an inventory and there were so many
02:46 - bugs with it so
02:47 - you bought the items in the shop and
02:49 - then they go in your inventory and you
02:50 - could equip it
02:52 - for when you i don't know if just to use
02:54 - not in the in the lobby i guess
02:56 - but i like the lobby i think the lobby
02:58 - is quite good this is a good idea as
03:00 - well i haven't having the hobby for
03:01 - people to complete
03:02 - whilst around is currently going on but
03:05 - hopefully we can actually load into a
03:07 - map and actually play the game
03:08 - and try to get to the end here uh we'll
03:10 - just use up all of our remaining votes
03:12 - oh i have
03:13 - negative one remaining votes it's
03:15 - already a bug
03:16 - i really didn't know how to make my uh
03:18 - gui scale
03:20 - with the screen here this is not good at
03:22 - all there's a little bit over there
03:23 - that's still working the moving parts
03:25 - so let's give this a go um try and
03:30 - give my best shot on this course
03:34 - there we go and up and up and up
03:38 - all right moving parts i think these are
03:39 - done with c frame
03:41 - uh because there was no tween service
03:43 - back then and
03:44 - to be honest i think i might have just
03:46 - used a free model script whoa
03:48 - how how did i die there i didn't even
03:50 - touch the lava
03:52 - this is a rigged game all right i think
03:53 - you get the idea of how this game works
03:55 - though
03:56 - i'm still quite proud of it i mean i
03:58 - think this game if i just put a little
03:59 - bit more
04:00 - uh time into it now maybe just fixed a
04:02 - couple of things i think this would
04:03 - actually be a good game i could probably
04:04 - release this and make quite a bit of
04:06 - robux from it
04:07 - i actually had to fix a couple of bugs
04:09 - before i even recorded this because
04:11 - the game wouldn't even start so i just
04:13 - had to go into roblox studio and
04:15 - fix a couple of things but there's so
04:16 - many bugs i mean the code
04:18 - is so bad in this game there's like 20
04:21 - scripts i might even have to show you
04:23 - the inside of this game and show you
04:24 - what it looks like but yeah this was my
04:26 - one of my games not my first it's called
04:28 - obi mania i'll leave a link to it in the
04:30 - description if you want to play it i
04:32 - mean not it will probably
04:33 - it'll probably break on you so please
04:36 - don't give it a dislike
04:37 - but this was made in 2015 when i was 12
04:41 - years old
04:42 - so not too bad not too bad for someone
04:44 - that still didn't really know how to how
04:46 - to script
04:47 - all right the next game is called
04:49 - skydive paradise now i'm actually quite
04:51 - proud of this game
04:52 - i made it in 2016 so i was 13. i made it
04:55 - after obby mania
04:57 - and this game i'm pretty sure it was
04:59 - like a commission for somebody they
05:00 - wanted to make a skydiving game
05:03 - and then it just broke down like after a
05:05 - couple of weeks
05:06 - but i managed to keep whatever i'd made
05:09 - so far i actually then went on to try
05:10 - and make this into my own game
05:12 - so um i'm going to show you how it works
05:15 - it's basically skydive multiplayer and
05:17 - the first person to reach the finish
05:20 - win so kind of like an obby but
05:21 - skydiving there's no thumbnail no
05:24 - you know it doesn't look like a
05:25 - professional game because i never got
05:27 - around to releasing it
05:28 - but either way it's still fun i'm not
05:30 - sure why it has more dislikes than likes
05:32 - maybe you should go check it out drop a
05:34 - thumbs up to make that equal
05:36 - and this is another game that i think uh
05:38 - can i can remake and
05:40 - could be a popular roblox game if i
05:41 - actually put the time into it so
05:43 - anyway let's go straight into the game
05:45 - and let me show you what it's all about
05:47 - all right so we have a
05:51 - very bad intro gui this game is brought
05:54 - to you by alvin blocks this was
05:56 - created after i made my youtube channel
05:58 - because it was in 2016 but i
06:00 - would have had under a thousand
06:01 - subscribers and it looks like there's a
06:03 - game already in progress
06:04 - so click the play button
06:08 - and you can see already we have a
06:11 - very basic gui style we have a shop
06:14 - where you could buy guns or pets
06:18 - the guns don't do anything though i
06:20 - tried them about five minutes ago and
06:22 - they don't do anything so
06:23 - that's already a book but you can see
06:25 - the round starts
06:26 - and everybody just starts skydiving and
06:28 - the first person to
06:30 - hit the target and i think the the
06:33 - better
06:34 - target you hit so if you hit like the
06:35 - bullseye you'll get more points
06:37 - and then it comes up here in this little
06:39 - gui whoever came first second and third
06:42 - now that gui took me absolutely ages to
06:45 - do like
06:46 - it was a problem i just did not know how
06:48 - to solve like how do you show the people
06:50 - who came first second and third all the
06:51 - time
06:52 - and i just took my agent it was so buggy
06:54 - i remember working on that trying to fix
06:56 - it uh but it seems to be working quite
06:58 - well
07:00 - the skydiving script though this nice
07:02 - little skydiving animation
07:04 - i gotta admit it was a free model uh
07:06 - this this skydiving thing i had no idea
07:08 - how to do it
07:09 - and eventually i just took a free model
07:12 - and that was a
07:13 - that was a problem that was like why
07:14 - this game didn't really go anywhere is
07:16 - because at that time i didn't really
07:17 - know how to edit the skydiving script so
07:19 - i couldn't make anything
07:21 - that was pretty you know advanced or add
07:23 - much onto the game
07:24 - you know there's no real trick to
07:26 - skydiving it's kind of just random
07:28 - who will get there i think it's just if
07:29 - you just aim down then it's whoever's
07:31 - the fastest
07:32 - um will win but apart from that there's
07:35 - not much else you can do in the game
07:37 - which is probably why it wasn't very
07:38 - successful because people would just you
07:40 - know
07:40 - play a couple of rounds and then leave
07:42 - because i mean i gotta admit it's quite
07:44 - boring
07:45 - um it said uh i didn't even say that i i
07:47 - made it
07:48 - in this gui so still quite a few bugs
07:51 - here
07:51 - there you go skydive paradise i kind of
07:54 - learned more from this than
07:56 - like i didn't make any robux or anything
07:58 - or get any uh visits i just learned more
08:00 - about scripting from this game so i'd
08:02 - say that's a win
08:03 - so now i'm going to show you one more
08:05 - game and this game
08:07 - was actually my first one of my first
08:09 - roblox games that i created uh when i
08:12 - was
08:13 - eight years old and it's called fight of
08:14 - dawn now i was
08:16 - looking at the other games that we just
08:17 - played and i was thinking that they were
08:19 - so bad well
08:20 - this game is just gonna be really bad
08:23 - like
08:23 - this is rubbish this just belongs in the
08:27 - trash can because
08:28 - when we go into this game you're just
08:30 - going to see so many free models like
08:32 - this game
08:33 - was created on was it the 7th
08:37 - no the 2nd of july 2011
08:40 - so i was like eight years old new on
08:42 - roblox was probably just on roadblocks
08:44 - for like three months
08:45 - so i had like no idea how roblox studio
08:48 - works
08:48 - but i thought this game was going to be
08:50 - like the the next big thing on roblox we
08:52 - got a little vip
08:54 - badge vip for fight of dawn i don't even
08:56 - think that even works i don't think i
08:57 - even
08:58 - coded that or did anything with that but
09:01 - here we go
09:02 - and you can see straight away there were
09:03 - so many free models
09:05 - you just oh this game is so bad
09:08 - look at it the creator thanks luongo 100
09:11 - for using his free model
09:13 - i didn't thank him he just put that in
09:15 - the free model and eight-year-old me had
09:17 - no idea how to get rid of that
09:19 - just three models absolutely everywhere
09:21 - um
09:22 - i think the only thing that works in
09:24 - this game is the sword because it's a
09:25 - free model one by roblox and maybe in
09:28 - 2011 everything worked but this game's
09:30 - probably been broken by all the updates
09:32 - and free
09:32 - and uh and filtering enabled and all
09:34 - that stuff
09:36 - so there's not a lot to do here but the
09:37 - aim of the game was that you have two
09:39 - teams you have uk over here
09:41 - you have usa and you just fight each
09:44 - other
09:44 - and whoever wins wins but there's no
09:47 - scripts that control anything there's
09:48 - just a load of npcs
09:50 - i don't even want to show this game off
09:52 - anymore because i frankly i'm getting
09:53 - embarrassed by it here
09:55 - but there you go that was one of my
09:58 - first
09:58 - roblox games fight of dawn i mean let's
10:00 - see if we can actually do anything
10:02 - because
10:02 - someone's joined we got bert dev over
10:04 - here let's see if we can actually go and
10:05 - kill him
10:06 - you can just tell like look at the look
10:08 - at the materials and look at the meshes
10:10 - this just
10:10 - screams out free models i mean if you
10:13 - want to take anything from this game
10:14 - don't use free models in your games
10:16 - because people will just be able to tell
10:18 - uh there's a big cannon over there i
10:20 - want to see what the calendar is before
10:21 - we go
10:22 - now because maybe it will shoot people
10:24 - out of it uh here we go
10:25 - right canon let's see if we can jump
10:27 - into here
10:29 - oh it doesn't do anything f
10:32 - oh no that's it then so there you go
10:36 - there's the probably the earliest roblox
10:38 - game that i that i want to show you
10:40 - um i i guess the the ones that came
10:43 - before that are even more cringy
10:44 - and and embarrassing but it just goes to
10:47 - show
10:48 - that was my first roblox game i'm
10:51 - capable of making much better roblox
10:52 - games now so you just got to keep going
10:54 - keep making more games
10:56 - like i've i've got like over 900 places
10:59 - in my roblox account
11:00 - 900 games so in each one of those would
11:02 - be it would have been an improvement on
11:04 - this one so
11:05 - so yeah you just got to keep going keep
11:07 - improving and
11:08 - then if you go back to your old projects
11:10 - then i'm sure you're going to look at
11:11 - them and think they're really bad but
11:13 - you just got to think of everything that
11:15 - you've learned since you've made those
11:16 - projects
11:17 - so if you enjoyed this video make sure
