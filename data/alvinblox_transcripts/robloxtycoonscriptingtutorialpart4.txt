00:00 - so in this video we're going to learn
00:02 - how to create a dropper so that you can
00:04 - actually start earning money from your
00:06 - Tycoon so first thing we need to do is
00:09 - we need to get a model for our dropper
00:11 - now I'm not too bothered about how this
00:13 - is going to look so I'm going to go to
00:14 - the toolbox and I'm just going to search
00:16 - for a dropper uh now again it's got be
00:19 - got to be careful when you are going
00:21 - through the toolbox because you might
00:23 - find uh a dodgy um model but I'm going
00:27 - to show you how to make sure your model
00:29 - is is safe um so I'm just going to find
00:32 - a dropper and I'm going to drag it into
00:33 - the game now here's the first thing
00:35 - you've got to be careful of so it says
00:37 - neon dropper can uh includes one script
00:40 - now we don't want any scripts so I'm
00:42 - just going to click on okay I'm going to
00:45 - close down the tool box for now um but
00:47 - then in the Explorer what we can do to
00:49 - make sure this is a good model is we're
00:52 - just going to open up all of the um
00:55 - nested tabs here so just make sure you
00:57 - can see everything and then if you see
00:59 - any Scripts we're just going to remove
01:00 - them and you should just only see Parts
01:03 - if you see some parts contain like a
01:06 - fire object or Sparkles or script just
01:09 - remove them okay so once you've figured
01:11 - out that your dropper is safe um or of
01:14 - course you could just build your own
01:15 - right like it's not that hard uh I'm
01:17 - just doing this for the sake of the
01:18 - tutorial so when you've done that uh
01:21 - just drag it onto your plot somewhere I
01:22 - mean let's put it over here okay and um
01:27 - then what we want to do is we want to
01:29 - have some kind of conveyor right cuz
01:32 - that's typically what happens in a
01:33 - tycoon you have a dropper it drops some
01:36 - kind of uh part onto a conveyor the
01:38 - conveyor then you know brings it all the
01:40 - way over over to here and what have you
01:43 - um so let's go ahead and create a simple
01:45 - little conveyor so I'm going to insert a
01:47 - part and we're just going to scale it
01:50 - over
01:51 - here and we'll just make it so that it
01:54 - is wide enough that it covers the width
01:57 - of the dropper and then we're going to
01:59 - just increase the size slightly I'm
02:02 - going to make it gray uh and I'm just
02:04 - going to actually reduce the size a
02:05 - little bit so here's our conveyor right
02:07 - and then I'm then going to just add uh
02:09 - some parts to the side of it I'm going
02:11 - to control D to duplicate this
02:14 - part and then I'm just going to move it
02:17 - to the edge and this is going to act as
02:20 - like a little wall okay to prevent a
02:21 - little dropper parts from from falling
02:24 - out and to do the same thing I'm going
02:25 - to duplicate with contrl d and we're
02:28 - just going to drag it to this side okay
02:29 - okay so there we go very simple conveyor
02:32 - uh and then I'm just going to select all
02:34 - three parts and make sure that um it's
02:37 - still within the boundary of our plot
02:39 - like that and then if you want you can
02:41 - just uh make sure that the dropper is
02:44 - centered and there you go we've created
02:46 - a simple conveyor uh only problem is it
02:49 - doesn't work yet so we need to firstly
02:51 - select all three parts of our conveyor
02:54 - okay by holding down control or command
02:56 - if you're on a Mac when they're all
02:58 - selected go to the properties window
03:00 - make sure anchored is checked and then
03:03 - you can um group these parts together so
03:06 - I'm just going to rightclick on them all
03:08 - and select group as a model and I'm
03:11 - going to call this model conveyor Okay
03:15 - so we've created a model for our
03:16 - conveyor and we now have a model for our
03:18 - dropper so I'm going to just uh close
03:21 - down the um nests on the dropper here
03:24 - and I'm going to name my dropper dropper
03:27 - so by this point you should have a model
03:29 - that's called dro and a model that is
03:31 - called conveyor okay last thing we need
03:33 - is a little part over here which will
03:36 - collect our um our drops and we'll
03:39 - convert them into money so let's just
03:43 - create um let's select this part which
03:46 - is our conveyor part we're going to
03:48 - duplicate this specific part and we're
03:50 - just going to move it along here and
03:53 - then I'm going to scale it down this is
03:54 - just going to be like a little
03:55 - collection area okay and I'm going to
03:58 - extend our walls as well you can select
04:01 - one part that's in a model by holding
04:03 - holding alt right or I think it's option
04:06 - on a Mac if you um if you just want to
04:09 - select one part like that there you go
04:12 - uh and finally we will just duplicate
04:16 - this part to create a barrier at the end
04:19 - okay so we now have got our conveyor all
04:23 - set up and totally working it's just
04:25 - good at this stage to make sure Again by
04:27 - selecting all of your parts they're all
04:30 - anchored this means that they won't fall
04:32 - to pieces when we start the game up and
04:34 - it all looks good to me so we've got our
04:36 - little
04:37 - conveyor there's a little Clash issue
04:39 - here I'm just going to select our white
04:41 - part and move it here there we go okay
04:45 - we're totally good to go so now last
04:49 - thing we've got to do before we can
04:50 - start coding is we need to make this
04:53 - conveyor part work so when a drop lands
04:56 - on this part we want it to move all the
04:58 - way down to the white part and to do
05:01 - this we just need to set the velocity
05:03 - property so if we go down to the
05:06 - properties window we've got
05:08 - assembly uh linear
05:10 - velocity and there should be a velocity
05:14 - property okay so we actually are going
05:16 - to have to do this in code um but that's
05:18 - all good uh what I'm going to do is I'm
05:21 - going
05:22 - to um I'm just thinking about this I'm
05:25 - just thinking yeah what we'll do is
05:27 - we'll take our little conveyor part here
05:29 - I'm pressing alt and clicking it so this
05:32 - specific part that we want to be the
05:33 - conveyor I'm just going to name it uh
05:36 - belt yeah I should have just called it
05:38 - the belt shouldn't I um so I'm going to
05:40 - select the Belt part and then I'm going
05:42 - to click on the plus and I'm going to
05:43 - insert a script and then inside of this
05:46 - script I mean if you want you can name
05:48 - it um belt script so we know what it is
05:53 - then what I'm going to do is I'm just
05:54 - going to Simply say uh script. parent.
05:58 - velocity uh we probably shouldn't be
06:00 - using velocity to be honest um because
06:01 - it is deprecated um so I'll look into a
06:04 - better solution soon but for now it
06:06 - should be okay uh script. parent.
06:08 - velocity equals Vector 3. new and then
06:11 - we need to find the direction of travel
06:13 - so I believe it's going to be the uh Z
06:18 - axis so we want it to be going left on
06:20 - The Zed axis um so I'm just going to put
06:25 - 0 comma 0 comma 10 and hope that that
06:28 - works and then um what we'll do is we'll
06:31 - test it by going to the top left
06:34 - selecting home clicking on the little
06:36 - arrow that's underneath the play button
06:38 - and choose
06:39 - run and uh and what we can do is we can
06:42 - just drop a part onto the
06:46 - conveyor and look at that it's moving uh
06:49 - perfect so that is exactly what we
06:52 - wanted to happen all
06:55 - right okay next thing we need to do is
06:57 - we need to set up our drop dropper so
07:00 - I'm going to select this part of our
07:03 - dropper in fact you know what I'm just
07:05 - going to insert a script into our
07:07 - dropper here and this
07:11 - script uh I'm going to call it dropper
07:17 - script and what we want this script to
07:19 - do is we just want it to spawn a part
07:22 - every few seconds from The
07:25 - Dropper okay so very simple we're just
07:28 - going to say
07:30 - while uh task. wait to do and that will
07:35 - repeat every two seconds we're just
07:38 - going to say um let's firstly create the
07:40 - part that it's going to drop first okay
07:42 - so we're going to go back we're going to
07:45 - click on the part button up here and
07:48 - we're just going to design the part that
07:50 - is going to be produced by this dropper
07:53 - so it's for me I just want a small
07:56 - square part okay um I'm going to make it
08:01 - neon blue because seems to be what this
08:04 - dropper looks like you can customize it
08:06 - however you like and I'm just going to
08:08 - call it um dropper template okay and I'm
08:13 - going to then take this dropper template
08:15 - and I'm going to put it into server
08:18 - storage all right now we can go back to
08:20 - our dropper
08:22 - script and I'm going to create a
08:23 - variable for our dropper template which
08:26 - is still stored in uh server storage so
08:29 - local drop a template equals game.
08:33 - server storage colon wait for
08:38 - child Dro a template like this so this
08:42 - will wait until it finds the dro a
08:44 - template just because sometimes the
08:46 - script can start running before the uh
08:49 - Dro a template has been loaded in um
08:52 - completely so this will just make sure
08:54 - it's waiting until it finds it and then
08:56 - every 2 seconds we're going to say local
09:00 - new Dropper part equals dropper template
09:05 - colon clone new dropper part. cframe
09:11 - equals and This Is Us telling the script
09:15 - where we want to spawn the part now in
09:19 - our case we want to spawn it at this
09:21 - drop part now if you've built your own
09:24 - conveyor you should have one of these
09:25 - parts right where it sort of it's
09:27 - semi-transparent and it shows off where
09:30 - the um where the drops will come from
09:33 - okay so I just recommend you have one of
09:35 - those I mean for me I've set it up so
09:37 - that this part is called drop and it's
09:39 - inside the model so yours may vary but
09:42 - as long as you um in our script we set
09:45 - the cframe to that Parts position we'll
09:48 - be all good so new drop apart. cframe
09:51 - equals script. parent. drop. cframe okay
09:56 - like I say this can vary of course
09:58 - because your part might be a different
10:01 - name might be in a different place
10:02 - whatever but just make sure you set this
10:04 - to a reference right from your script to
10:07 - this part or you could even set it to be
10:10 - um its own position in the world like it
10:12 - doesn't really matter and of course you
10:13 - can play around as well with adding or
10:16 - subtracting Vector 3 values so if you
10:19 - wanted to position it um slightly below
10:21 - that part then you could say minus five
10:24 - studs here or add five studs or whatever
10:27 - but for me this should work perfectly
10:28 - fine fine and then we're going to say
10:30 - new drop apart do parent
10:34 - equals
10:37 - um where should we put this let me think
10:39 - I'm I'm also going to create a
10:41 - folder okay I'm going to create a folder
10:43 - in my dropper so I'm going to click on
10:45 - the plus for the model going to search
10:47 - for a folder going to select it and then
10:50 - I'm going to set this to be called
10:53 - dropper
10:54 - parts and then I'm going to set the
10:56 - parent of these new parts to scrip
10:59 - scripts. parent. dropper Parts this is
11:03 - just so that everything is organized and
11:06 - finally just above the
11:10 - um uh in fact yeah what we'll do is
11:13 - we'll say new drop apart set
11:16 - attribute um drop drop
11:20 - apart true okay and this is just so that
11:23 - we have tagged it so that when something
11:26 - touches our white part over here we can
11:29 - make sure it's actually something that
11:30 - came from a dropper because we don't
11:32 - want everything that touches this part
11:34 - to give us cash only things that came
11:35 - from a dropper so if we tag our
11:38 - individual dropper Parts with this here
11:41 - then we'll know that it is allowed to
11:43 - give us some cash um in fact what we can
11:47 - what we can do is we can War up
11:48 - ourselves here and we can say um cash to
11:53 - give and we can set this to a number
11:56 - right we could set this to five for
11:59 - example but what I'm going to do is I'm
12:01 - going to select our dropper right in the
12:04 - in the in the in the Explorer I'm going
12:06 - to scroll down to the properties window
12:08 - and I'm going to set an attribute of
12:09 - this dropper and this is going to be an
12:12 - attribute that tells the game how much
12:14 - cash each drop part from this droper is
12:17 - going to give so it's going to be a
12:18 - number and I'm going to call it cach per
12:23 - drop and click on Save and I'm going to
12:25 - just set this to two so every drop apart
12:28 - will give two cach all right and I've
12:30 - set that in the dropper so now in our
12:33 - script we can set the cash to give value
12:37 - of our specific Dro a part to script.
12:42 - parent get
12:45 - attribute cash per
12:47 - drop there we go so the cash to give
12:51 - will be the same as the cash per drop
12:54 - which is two and then when this drop
12:57 - apart touches our white part we can just
13:01 - read its uh cash to give value and
13:04 - increment the player's cache so what
13:08 - we'll do is we'll just apply the edits
13:10 - from this script we'll go back to our
13:12 - Tycoon and I'm just going to head over
13:15 - to the dropper area we're going to test
13:17 - this we're going to see if Parts start
13:20 - dropping out so let's open up the output
13:22 - window let's clear it just in case um
13:26 - and we'll zoom out as well we'll click
13:29 - on
13:30 - run and we'll see what happens so our
13:34 - drop a parts are spawning but they're
13:36 - getting stuck in the dropper I did think
13:38 - that this would happen so what we can do
13:40 - is we can click on the stop button go to
13:42 - our dropper script and where it says new
13:45 - drop apart. cframe we do just what I
13:48 - said which was to add
13:51 - on uh or subtract sorry Vector 3. new
13:55 - we'll subtract about two studs okay so
13:58 - this this will position it two studs
14:00 - lower than it than the than the drop
14:02 - part C frame so again we'll click on run
14:05 - and we'll see if this changes
14:09 - things okay there we go so our drops are
14:12 - now falling out of the dropper they
14:14 - heading towards the white part and all
14:18 - that's left to do is when these parts
14:20 - hit the white part we just need to
14:23 - remove them and increment the player's
14:25 - currency so click on the stop button and
14:30 - finally all that's left to do is we'll
14:32 - go over here to our white part hold down
14:35 - alt or option on a Mac so we can
14:37 - individually select it and then in the
14:40 - properties panel I'm going to call this
14:43 - um
14:44 - collector and then I'm going to go up to
14:46 - the Explorer panel and to click on the
14:48 - plus insert a script I'm going to name
14:51 - this script collector script and then
14:56 - we're going to create a simple touched
14:58 - event for when this part is
15:01 - touched connect
15:04 - function hit so when something touches
15:07 - this part we firstly want to check to
15:10 - see if it has a cach to give attribute
15:15 - because that's what our dropper Parts
15:16 - have that's how we can tell them apart
15:19 - from other things which might touch our
15:21 - collector so if hit col on get
15:26 - attribute um cach to
15:29 - give
15:31 - then we firstly need to find the player
15:34 - who owns this plot so how are we going
15:37 - to do
15:38 - that well we know that our items such as
15:42 - our conveyor and dropper are going to be
15:43 - stored inside an items folder in a plot
15:47 - and in our previous video we set an
15:49 - attribute of the player's
15:51 - plot um didn't we we set the uh taken
15:56 - and owner user ID so we set the user ID
16:00 - to the owner attribute for their plot so
16:03 - when this script is running we know that
16:05 - it will be in someone's plot it's not at
16:07 - the moment but what we'll do for now is
16:11 - we will just uh take our three scripts
16:13 - here our belt script collect a script
16:16 - and our Dro a
16:20 - script um and we will just make them
16:23 - disabled for now so going to select
16:25 - these three scripts we've been working
16:26 - in and to set the enabled to unchecked
16:30 - okay so it's now disabled and then what
16:32 - we'll do is we'll go back to our plot
16:38 - Handler and for all of the items that
16:41 - are in
16:42 - the template items whenever they get
16:45 - unlocked what we'll do is we'll just
16:48 - cycle through everything inside the item
16:50 - and if it's a script we will make it
16:52 - enabled so for underscore comma script
16:57 - uh script object
16:59 - in if you call it script it won't work
17:01 - because script is a is a globally
17:03 - globally used term so it has to be
17:04 - something other than script so
17:06 - underscore script object in item clone
17:11 - get descendants do if script object is a
17:18 - script I think we can say base script uh
17:22 - then script object do enabled equals
17:25 - true Okay so now that that's done this
17:30 - script will this script this script and
17:32 - this script will only start running once
17:34 - it's in a proper player's plot so we can
17:37 - get the
17:38 - plot uh by saying because the uh dropper
17:43 - sorry the
17:44 - conveyor will be inside the items folder
17:47 - so we should just be able to say script.
17:50 - parent given that we're in The Collector
17:51 - script right now so this would be the
17:53 - collector do parent would be the
17:55 - conveyor parent would be the items
17:57 - folder and parent should be the plot so
18:00 - I'm going to create a variable for the
18:02 - plot okay what we'll do in the future is
18:05 - because we'll probably get on to having
18:06 - you know other things and and this might
18:08 - get a little bit messy but we'll
18:09 - probably write a function in the future
18:11 - that gets the plot from a specific
18:13 - item uh so now we've got the players
18:16 - plot we can get their user
18:19 - ID and we can just create a variable for
18:23 - that okay and then we can make sure it
18:27 - exists so if not plot owner user ID then
18:31 - return end and we can also check to see
18:34 - if the plot doesn't exist so if not plot
18:37 - then return end might not exist for some
18:39 - reason you can do an error error message
18:42 - here if you
18:44 - want um so warn no plot no plot owner
18:48 - user
18:50 - ID and by this point we know that we
18:55 - have found the plot owner because
18:57 - otherwise it will have returned earned
18:58 - by now so we can
19:02 - say um local player object equals game.
19:07 - players get player by user
19:11 - ID plot owner user ID and this gives us
19:15 - their player object so that thing that's
19:17 - stored in game. players and this allows
19:19 - us to get access to their leader stats
19:22 - so we can say player object do leer
19:25 - stats doh do Value Plus equals and then
19:29 - we're going to say um hit get attribute
19:35 - cach to give because hit in this case is
19:38 - going to be that Dropper part which we
19:40 - just created um and spawned from our
19:44 - dropper finally we are going to uh
19:48 - delete that object so before we
19:51 - increment the cache we're going to say
19:53 - hit colon destroy okay so it destroys it
19:58 - and then it increments the
20:02 - cache so let's test this out what I'm
20:05 - going to do is I'm going to take our
20:07 - conveyor and our dropper and I'm going
20:10 - to drag them into the items folder of
20:13 - our template
20:14 - plot now we've added two new items to
20:17 - the game which means we need to give
20:19 - them their own specific ID of course our
20:22 - first model over there the painting had
20:24 - the ID of one I'm going to change the
20:26 - name of this to painting as well because
20:29 - um it was just called model for ages but
20:32 - if we go to our dropper and our conveyor
20:35 - we just select them both okay make make
20:37 - sure they're both selected going to add
20:39 - an attribute we're going to call it ID
20:44 - this is going to be a number we'll click
20:45 - on Save and so their ID was number one
20:50 - for the first one we can just make the
20:51 - dropper id2 and the conveyor ID3 doesn't
20:54 - really matter which order as long as
20:56 - they're all different so we've got one
20:58 - two and three so now we've done that
21:01 - let's just take our button over here and
21:05 - duplicate it and I'm going to put it
21:07 - over here for the conveyor and I'm going
21:09 - to duplicate another one and put it over
21:12 - here for the dropper now obviously we
21:14 - need to just link these up so the button
21:17 - I'm just going to call this dropper
21:19 - button and I'm going to call this one
21:22 - conveyor button just so that we don't
21:25 - get confused I'll call this one painting
21:29 - button whilst I'm at it and then we just
21:31 - need to set the ID of item to
21:35 - unlock to their specific IDs so the con
21:39 - so the dropper has an ID of two so I'm
21:42 - going to select the button and I'm going
21:45 - to set the ID of that to
21:48 - two and I'm going to select the conveyor
21:51 - and the ID of item will be three for
21:55 - this one okay so that's all set up we
21:58 - can change the titles of the buttons
22:00 - later on it's not really important right
22:02 - now um but that should be everything
22:05 - let's just go and uh test it out and see
22:07 - if it works we might get a couple of
22:09 - issues here because we've um we've been
22:11 - working on quite a bit of
22:14 - stuff okay so I need to just walk over
22:17 - to the
22:18 - plot all right so we firstly need to
22:22 - give ourselves some cash so I'm going to
22:24 - go to the current server to the
22:28 - Explorer and set my cache value really
22:31 - important that you do that on the server
22:33 - not on the client a lot of people will
22:35 - set that value on the client and and not
22:38 - realize why it's not working so I've
22:40 - bought my painting I'm going to then buy
22:43 - my
22:44 - conveyor and let's just make sure that
22:47 - the conveyor script has um been enabled
22:51 - because don't forget we set all of our
22:53 - scripts to be
22:54 - disabled um that was in our belt so our
22:56 - belt script is running our collector
22:59 - script is running so this is a good
23:01 - sign okay and I'm stepping on my uh
23:06 - white part here and I'm not gaining cash
23:08 - which is a good sign so it's only set to
23:11 - give that cash to those dropper items
23:13 - and now I've unlocked my dropper The
23:17 - Dropper script has also started
23:21 - running and look at that the little
23:25 - dropper parts are hitting the white part
23:28 - and then if you look closely you can see
23:29 - my cache is increasing by two every
23:33 - single time um now there is one other
23:37 - issue in that there are multiple
23:39 - droppers here there's one dropper here
23:42 - there there's two droppers that seem to
23:44 - have been created um and there's also
23:47 - three paintings here okay so um let's
23:52 - have a look and see if we can solve this
23:56 - problem
23:58 - so if we have a look at our plot Handler
24:03 - script this is likely because this
24:06 - touched event is going to be firing
24:08 - multiple times when we step on the
24:09 - button because I have many body parts in
24:12 - my character that's many potential parts
24:15 - that could be colliding with this button
24:16 - at the same time forcing this touched
24:19 - event to fire more than once very simple
24:22 - way to fix this is you just
24:26 - say uh around around about here we can
24:29 - just say button set attribute
24:33 - debounce
24:36 - true and then underneath it we'll say
24:40 - task dot
24:42 - delay um two
24:46 - function button set attributes we can
24:50 - say if button then button set attribute
24:54 - debounce
24:55 - false and
24:59 - um let me just think here I'm just
25:02 - thinking uh oh yeah if button get
25:07 - attribute
25:11 - debounce then return end okay now this
25:14 - should work what we're doing is we're
25:16 - basically setting a value which prevents
25:19 - the button from being um from running
25:22 - this code again until 2 seconds have
25:24 - passed until the d bounce value is false
25:26 - again so this this if statement will
25:29 - return if the debounce attribute is true
25:32 - so we're setting it to true for 2
25:35 - seconds and then after those two seconds
25:37 - we set it to false again of course the
25:39 - button could have been destroyed by then
25:41 - so we're just checking to see if it
25:43 - still exists but this will prevent the
25:45 - code from running uh past this point
25:48 - more than once every two seconds so it
25:50 - will only spawn the item
25:53 - once so let's go and test this
25:56 - out
25:59 - all right so I just sped things up gave
26:01 - myself some cash um let's just click on
26:04 - the buttons
26:05 - again and doesn't seem to be any errors
26:09 - in the output let's go into our plot and
26:12 - items and this time you can see that
26:14 - there are only three items that exist so
26:17 - we have fixed that issue but the good
26:19 - news is we now are able to earn money
26:22 - from our Tycoon we essentially now have
26:25 - a tycoon game um set up and working it's
26:27 - still very basic but it works we have
26:30 - the ability to earn money um so we now
26:33 - just need to add more items really uh
26:35 - and we also need to add uh data saving
26:38 - which we'll probably look at next time
26:39 - so you can watch that video uh if it's
26:41 - released by the time you're watching by
26:43 - clicking on the thumbnail hope to see
26:45 - you there
