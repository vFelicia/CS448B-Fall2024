00:00 - okay game passes a really clever way of
00:03 - earning money in your Roblox games and
00:06 - I'm going to show you how to use the
00:08 - Game Pass service so when it comes to
00:10 - game passes there's two things really
00:12 - that you need to do firstly you need to
00:14 - be able to prompt a user to purchase a
00:16 - game pass if they're in the game and
00:18 - then the second part is actually
00:19 - granting the perks that the player gets
00:22 - as a result of purchasing a Game Pass
00:25 - now there's loads of game passes out
00:27 - there I won't be able to cover them all
00:28 - in this video but I'm going to try and
00:30 - give you a quick run through of how you
00:33 - can detect whether a player owns a pass
00:35 - and how to also prompt them to purchase
00:37 - the pass so first things first you're
00:39 - obviously going to need to set up a Game
00:41 - Pass I'm not going to show you how to do
00:43 - that in this video but let's assume you
00:45 - have a Game Pass ID so what you want to
00:48 - do is you want to firstly insert a local
00:50 - script in the starter GUI or you just
00:52 - put this code anywhere on the client
00:54 - where it's going to run and let's
00:56 - firstly create a variable for the game
00:59 - pass service so game get service Game
01:03 - Pass service like this okay and to
01:06 - prompt a Game
01:08 - Pass uh well actually actually actually
01:11 - actually uh what we also have is the
01:13 - marketplace service okay so we'll say
01:15 - game get Service Marketplace service and
01:19 - we also have like I just typed out there
01:21 - The Game Pass service so what is the
01:24 - difference between these two right we
01:26 - have a game pass service and a
01:27 - Marketplace service well we use the
01:29 - marketplace service to prompt a Game
01:32 - Pass purchase so Marketplace service
01:35 - colur on prompt Game Pass purchase
01:37 - you'll pass the player so in this case
01:39 - it's local player because it's running
01:41 - on the client and then you'll pass the
01:43 - Game Pass ID now you can just write your
01:45 - ID in
01:47 - here now for this example this is a VIP
01:50 - Game Pass and what you'll notice is when
01:52 - you join the game we will get prompted
01:54 - to purchase this game pass now I already
01:56 - own it so I can't buy it again but if
02:00 - you put this code anywhere on a client
02:03 - local script it will prompt the user to
02:06 - purchase the Game
02:08 - Pass okay so they've bought the Game
02:10 - Pass now how do we grant them their
02:12 - benefits so we will do the granting of
02:16 - benefits on the server because we don't
02:18 - want any exploiters to get in the way
02:19 - and potentially change things so again
02:22 - we're going to create a variable for the
02:24 - marketplace service and actually all of
02:26 - this is now done with Marketplace
02:28 - service it used to be game pass service
02:30 - but it's been deprecated so you
02:32 - shouldn't use it anymore to check if a
02:34 - user owns a game pass you say
02:36 - Marketplace service colon uh player
02:39 - sorry user owns Game Pass async like
02:42 - this you then pass the user ID and The
02:45 - Game Pass ID so we need to get the user
02:48 - ID so normally this code would be put in
02:51 - a event usually a player added event to
02:54 - check if a player owns a pass when they
02:56 - join so that's what we're going to
02:58 - do so so we'll replace user ID with
03:01 - player. user ID and we'll replace the
03:04 - Game Pass ID as
03:06 - well and this will return a true or
03:09 - false value as to whether the player
03:12 - owns the pass so I'm going to store this
03:14 - as a variable and then I'll say if
03:16 - player owns VIP then and here is where
03:20 - we can grant the player's benefits so in
03:23 - this case I'm just going to print out
03:28 - player owns VIP and if you click on play
03:33 - you will see that it prints out when I
03:35 - join the
03:37 - game now here you could do anything you
03:39 - could insert a character added event
03:42 - within this player added and then you
03:44 - could check if the player owns the pass
03:46 - every time they respawn through that
03:48 - event and then you could insert a tag
03:50 - above their head uh or you could do you
03:53 - could give them some currency I don't
03:55 - know right uh you probably want wouldn't
03:57 - want to give them currency because then
03:58 - they could keep rejoining but you get
04:00 - the idea that's how a typical VIP pass
04:02 - would
04:04 - work let's say they bought a pass that
04:07 - gives them double speed okay so we'll do
04:10 - that character added event so player.
04:12 - character added connect function and
04:15 - we'll get an argument for their
04:16 - character and now we can do things to
04:19 - their character such as change their
04:20 - walks speed so we'll say if player owns
04:23 - VIP then car. humanoid walkspeed equal
04:28 - 100 and let's go and test this out we
04:31 - put the code in a character added Loop
04:33 - because then it will um run every time
04:37 - the player respawns and when their
04:39 - character loads because obviously we're
04:41 - changing their their walk speed which is
04:43 - a property of the humanoid which is in
04:46 - their
04:48 - character and really when you have this
04:50 - character added your possibilities are
04:53 - widened because you could do things such
04:55 - as giving extra Health extra walk speed
04:58 - um you can alter the character in so
04:59 - many different ways and every time they
05:01 - respawn it's going to repeat it's going
05:04 - to do it to their character again so
05:05 - that is how to do a typical Game Pass
05:09 - check and this local script code as well
05:11 - you could just put this in a simple
05:13 - mouse button one click event to make a
05:16 - button to prompt them you could prompt
05:18 - them at certain uh intervals during the
05:20 - game uh the possibilities are really
05:22 - yours to do whatever you like so I hope
05:24 - this has been helpful if it has uh
05:26 - please like subscribe let me know any
05:28 - more videos you'd like to see and I'll
05:30 - see you in the next one
