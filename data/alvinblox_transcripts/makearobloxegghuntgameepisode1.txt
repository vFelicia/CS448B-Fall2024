00:31 - you haven't ever installed roblox studio
00:33 - all you need to do is go to your web
00:35 - browser and go to roblox comm forward
00:39 - slash creates I'll also leave a link in
00:41 - the description but once you're there
00:43 - click on start creating and then that
00:45 - will let you install a roblox studio
00:47 - roblox studio is the tool used to
00:51 - develop games on the platform once
00:54 - you've got roblox studio you should just
00:55 - be able to go and open it up on your
00:57 - computer by searching for it I'm gonna
00:59 - go and open it up by clicking on the
01:00 - Start menu and clicking roblox here when
01:03 - it opens up you may be prompted to login
01:05 - we go roblox account so make sure you go
01:07 - ahead and do that
01:08 - but once you finish doing that you
01:09 - should see this screen here and if you
01:11 - don't just click on the new button here
01:14 - and these templates should pop up now
01:16 - we're going to click on baseplates and
01:17 - this will open a blank workspace for us
01:21 - to start creating firstly I'm going to
01:23 - save the place by pressing ctrl s or
01:26 - command s and now we're good to go
01:29 - so the first thing I'm going to do is
01:30 - open up the workspace and if you don't
01:32 - see these tabs by the way you just need
01:34 - to go to view and make sure that
01:36 - Explorer and properties are selected we
01:39 - don't need the output for now ok so
01:41 - we're gonna go to the workspace select
01:43 - the base plate and I'm going to just
01:45 - change it to some grass and I'm going to
01:48 - make it green as well so it's a nice to
01:50 - work with next we're going to create our
01:53 - egg so to do this we firstly need to get
01:56 - an egg mesh to do that I'm gonna head to
01:58 - the toolbox and I'm going to search for
02:00 - egg now the toolbox contains lots of
02:03 - different objects created by other
02:05 - people and I'm just going to insert the
02:07 - first egg mesh that I see so just drag
02:09 - it into your game and select
02:12 - and then press F so you can find it my
02:14 - mind seems to be away from the baseplate
02:17 - so I'm going to click and drag it all
02:19 - the way over there and I'm gonna press F
02:21 - to head to the base plate so we've got
02:24 - our egg in here now I will leave a link
02:27 - to an egg mesh model that you can take
02:29 - used to take it and then go to the tool
02:31 - box click on this icon here and then you
02:35 - go to my models and you'll be able to
02:37 - insert it from there
02:38 - if you have bought it it will be free
02:40 - and I'll leave it in description now the
02:44 - next thing to do is just to check that
02:45 - there's no meshes inside of your egg now
02:49 - if there is what we need to do is we
02:51 - need to insert a mesh part okay because
02:54 - what we're going to do is this is
02:56 - actually a part with a mesh inside of it
02:58 - and the mesh makes it look like look
03:02 - make the part look like an egg but
03:04 - there's a natural mesh part which we
03:05 - should be using in roblox so we're going
03:07 - to right click go insert objects and
03:10 - we're gonna type in mesh parts okay now
03:12 - this is our new mesh part but what we're
03:14 - gonna do we're gonna go into the mesh of
03:15 - our egg over here I'm gonna copy the
03:18 - mesh ID okay or cut it and don't worry
03:21 - if the mesh goes away we're gonna paste
03:23 - that much ID into the mesh part and now
03:26 - we've got a part without a mesh inside
03:28 - of it that is an egg okay so that is our
03:32 - new mesh part if you always be using
03:34 - mesh parts instead of of parts with a
03:37 - mesh inside of it okay so we can now
03:40 - delete the egg mesh and don't worry
03:42 - about that if you've taken the model
03:44 - from the description because it will
03:46 - automatically be a mesh part I will have
03:48 - already converted it for you so now that
03:50 - you've got your egg mesh part I'm gonna
03:52 - give it a name and I'm gonna call this
03:54 - one rainbow egg okay so now you're free
03:57 - to make as many eggs as you would like
03:59 - but if you want to give it a you want to
04:02 - color the AIRC or maybe you have a
04:03 - pattern on it well you need to insert a
04:05 - decal onto the egg okay with it
04:07 - you can either texture it or add a decal
04:09 - now texturing is a little bit more
04:12 - complicated so I'm going to show you how
04:14 - you can use decals so we're gonna go to
04:17 - the toolbox I'm gonna click on the
04:19 - market place I'm gonna click on images
04:21 - okay so now you can choose any of these
04:24 - images and you
04:25 - put them onto your egg so I could select
04:29 - let's have a look we're gonna search for
04:31 - rainbow and it's going to give us some
04:35 - rainbow pictures so I could take this
04:37 - one just click it and then hover over
04:40 - the face of the egg so you have to apply
04:45 - a decal to each face so keep clicking
04:48 - for each face of the egg so left right
04:51 - up down front back bottom etc and you
04:56 - have to apply to each surface like this
04:58 - and when you've done that you've now got
05:00 - a patterned egg you've got those decals
05:03 - on it and if we open up the egg we can
05:05 - see we've got the decals in there so
05:07 - that is our egg now if you wanted to
05:10 - texture it okay you'd have to firstly
05:13 - just remove these decals but you would
05:16 - right click and click on copy assets ID
05:19 - and then wear the rainbow egg is set the
05:22 - texture ID to that ID okay and that is
05:24 - texturing it's a little bit different
05:26 - it's as if you just wrap it's like
05:29 - you've wrapped it up in wrapping paper
05:31 - okay whereas this one is kind of like
05:32 - you've just stuck sheets of paper on to
05:36 - each side okay but you can't really see
05:38 - the difference so you can either put
05:40 - decals on it or tech strip now I'm going
05:43 - to get rid of the texture for this one
05:44 - now you can create as many eggs as you
05:47 - like so I'm not going to create anymore
05:49 - so what you now need to do is when
05:52 - you've finished creating your egg we're
05:55 - going to go into a replicated storage
05:56 - here and we're gonna click on the plus
05:58 - and we're gonna insert a folder I'm
06:00 - gonna call this folder eggs okay this is
06:03 - where we're just going to keep all of
06:04 - our eggs in storage because we want to
06:06 - spawn them in we don't want altered we
06:08 - don't we don't want them all to be
06:10 - appearing at once so we're gonna keep
06:11 - them in replicated storage so we're just
06:13 - gonna drag the egg into that folder okay
06:16 - so there we go
06:17 - and remember you can create as many eggs
06:19 - as you'd like next we're going to create
06:20 - the GUI which will appear on the screen
06:22 - when you pick up the egg okay to tell
06:25 - you that congratulations you found it
06:27 - now if you're a channel member on my
06:29 - channel you will be able to access this
06:31 - GUI I will leave it for you channel
06:33 - members so if you do want to get the GUI
06:35 - then you can click the join button
06:37 - underneath the video and you'll
06:38 - Lockette instantly however if you aren't
06:41 - a channel member you can watch along and
06:42 - create it whilst I am so we're going to
06:45 - click on the start to GUI and we're
06:47 - going to insert a screen to your eye
06:48 - then we're going to name this screen GUI
06:50 - we're going to go to the properties and
06:52 - change its name to main GUI okay then
06:56 - inside of there we're going to insert a
06:58 - frame and a frame it just contains some
07:01 - GUI objects okay and it appeared here on
07:04 - the screen now we're going to set the
07:07 - anchor point of this frame to not 0.5 ,
07:11 - not 0.5 and what that does is when we
07:15 - set it you'll see in a minute we're also
07:18 - just going to set the position to naught
07:20 - point 5 comma 0 comma naught point 5
07:24 - comma 0 and that will put it in the
07:26 - exact middle of the screen because the
07:28 - anchor point is that dot in the middle
07:29 - and the anchor point is where the
07:31 - position is taken from and when it's in
07:34 - the middle we are it's definitely in the
07:36 - true middle of the screen then we're
07:38 - going to set the size of the GUI now I'm
07:41 - going to set it to naught point 2 5
07:42 - comma 0 naught point 3 comma 0 so it's
07:46 - going to take up around that last so
07:51 - that's a good size I think then we're
07:53 - going to change the style property to
07:56 - drop shadow and this will make it a
07:58 - little more professional I do like this
08:00 - style now inside of this frame we're
08:02 - going to insert quite a few things we're
08:05 - going to insert a text label to begin
08:06 - with and this is going to say
08:08 - congratulations so we can click on the
08:11 - text label and I'm going to change its
08:13 - name to congrats and I'm going to set
08:16 - the text to say congratulations and then
08:21 - going to set the text scaled property to
08:24 - be true so that it fills the entire text
08:26 - label box and the size will be set to 1
08:29 - comma 0 so it fills up the entire of the
08:33 - x axis and then naught point 1 5 comma 0
08:38 - so it only takes about 15% of the y axis
08:42 - so the y axis being the entire size of
08:44 - this frame so I'm then going to set the
08:47 - background transparency to 1 so you
08:49 - don't have that white background I'm
08:51 - gonna scroll down and set the
08:52 - textcolor three two white again I'm
08:55 - gonna drag that slider all the way to
08:57 - the top now that I've done that I can
09:00 - set the font if I like now I'm going to
09:02 - set this font to be Gotham bold and
09:06 - that's just going to make it look much
09:07 - cleaner much nicer now I'm gonna insert
09:10 - another text label and that's just going
09:12 - to go underneath it so I can insert all
09:16 - I can duplicate this one so right click
09:17 - and duplicate and I'll create an exact
09:19 - copy I'm going to change the name of
09:21 - this new text label to be called you
09:23 - found just gonna say underneath you
09:25 - found and then we'll have the name of
09:27 - the egg so I'm going to set the size to
09:31 - be a little bit smaller than the
09:32 - congratulations on the y-axis I'm gonna
09:35 - set it to naught point one so it'll only
09:37 - take out 10% of the frame size whereas
09:39 - congratulations currently takes about
09:41 - 15% I'm gonna set the position to be nor
09:44 - 0.15 on the y-axis so if we're doing the
09:48 - whole four values it would be zero comma
09:50 - zero because we don't want to move it
09:51 - anywhere on the x-axis because they're
09:52 - currently filling up the entire x-axis
09:54 - on the size property comma not 0.15
09:57 - comma zero so it's taking up well it's
10:01 - going to be 15% of the way down just
10:03 - where this congratulations finishes off
10:05 - then I'm going to change the text to say
10:08 - you found and then we will change that
10:11 - text with a script when we find a an egg
10:16 - and once we've got that we're going to
10:18 - insert a viewport frame and the viewport
10:21 - frame will have the image of the egg
10:24 - which we find so I'm going to just click
10:26 - on the frame again gonna click on write
10:29 - actually gonna have to search for it
10:30 - search for a viewport frame so a
10:32 - viewport frame can render 3d objects and
10:34 - the GUI if you're wondering what that is
10:36 - again I'm going to set the anchor points
10:39 - to naught to 0.5 common or 0.5 and this
10:43 - again puts that little dots in the
10:45 - middle so it will position it in a true
10:48 - middle because we're positioning it from
10:50 - the middle of the GUI and the position
10:53 - value we'll get to that in a minute I'm
10:55 - just going to do the size so I'm going
10:56 - to get set the size it's going to be
10:58 - quite a precise value but I've tested it
11:00 - not 0.375 comma zero comma not point
11:05 - five seven five come
11:06 - zero if a little bit confused about
11:08 - these GUI size values don't worry and
11:10 - what they're telling us is how much of
11:12 - the frame we are going to take up with
11:15 - this GUI on the x and y axis okay and so
11:19 - the numbers go from 0 to 1 we can pick a
11:21 - number between 0 and 1 for our first and
11:23 - third values there the scale values and
11:25 - it's the exact same with the position so
11:28 - we can set the position of where we want
11:31 - the GUI to to be so I'm going to set it
11:34 - to nor point 5 on the x-axis comma 0
11:36 - we're not dealing with offset offset is
11:38 - the second value but we're dealing with
11:40 - scale so do need to worry about that and
11:42 - so when it's not 0.5 it will be in there
11:44 - in the middle of the axis so on in the
11:46 - middle for the x axis but we also want
11:48 - it to be in the middle but a little bit
11:51 - further down because we don't it to be
11:52 - touching the congratulations and you
11:54 - found text labels so we're going to set
11:56 - the y-axis position to north point 5 7 5
11:59 - comma 0 okay and that's going to put it
12:02 - in a nice position here so the final
12:05 - thing that we now need to do is create a
12:06 - button which we can click to hide this
12:08 - GUI when we find something so I'm going
12:10 - to insert a text button now I'm going to
12:12 - call it this text button okay it's going
12:15 - to be an OK button and what I'm going to
12:18 - do is I'm going to set these size to not
12:21 - 0.25 comma 0 so that should take up 25%
12:26 - of the of the X size of the frame so
12:32 - naught point 2 5 comma 0 and then on the
12:34 - y-axis I only want it to take up 10% so
12:37 - naught point 1 comma 0 ok and there we
12:40 - go there's our button so I'm gonna then
12:41 - set text scale to be true so that the
12:44 - text fields will be entire button I'm
12:47 - going to change the text to say ok in
12:49 - fact let's do that in capital letters
12:51 - there we go I'm going to set the font to
12:54 - I'm gonna leave its or sums and let's
12:58 - have a look I'm gonna then move this
13:01 - down on time I'm going to put it firstly
13:04 - it's gonna be in the middle of the
13:05 - x-axis so naught point 5 comma 0 and
13:07 - then for the y axis by the way there's
13:09 - two values per axis which is why we're
13:11 - leaving out the zeros and then for the y
13:13 - axis the scare is going to be naught
13:15 - point nine four comma zero okay because
13:17 - that's gonna be 94 percent of the way
13:19 - down
13:20 - then we're gonna set the anchor point to
13:22 - be naught point 5 comma naught point 5
13:23 - and that will put it in the true middle
13:25 - of the screen okay there we go awesome
13:27 - so now we have created that GUI which
13:30 - will show the egg when we find it last
13:34 - touches I'm just going to set the
13:36 - background transparency of the viewport
13:37 - frame to be 1 because we don't want that
13:39 - white background I'm also going to
13:42 - change the background color of 3 of the
13:44 - ok button to be green like this and I'm
13:47 - going to set border size pixel to zero
13:48 - so that there's no border on the GUI
13:51 - button okay so there we go now that
13:54 - we're finished with that I'm going to
13:55 - hide the GUI so I'm gonna click on the
13:58 - frame I'm gonna go to the properties
13:59 - window I'm gonna set visible to false
14:02 - because we don't need to show this to
14:03 - you i right now we only want to show the
14:05 - GUI when we step on an egg so how are we
14:08 - going to make that appear when we do
14:09 - step on the egg well keep watching what
14:13 - we're gonna work on now is spawning the
14:15 - eggs so we want to make them appear
14:16 - somewhere in the game so to do that we
14:19 - firstly need to create a folder in the
14:22 - workspace okay so we're gonna click on
14:24 - the plus here and click on folder now
14:26 - this folder is going to contain lots of
14:28 - different parts and each part is going
14:30 - to be a position where the X could spawn
14:33 - because we don't want them spawning in
14:34 - the same place all the time so we're
14:36 - gonna have to have lots of different
14:37 - places where they could spawn and we're
14:39 - going to tell the game where we want to
14:41 - spawn by putting some parts in certain
14:43 - areas of the base plate ok and then
14:45 - using a script we can pick a random part
14:47 - out of this folder and set the position
14:49 - of our egg to the position of that part
14:52 - so we're going to change the name of
14:54 - this folder to be egg spawns it's gonna
14:59 - contain all of the spawns whether
15:01 - whether I could spawn okay then I'm
15:04 - gonna click on the park button it's
15:05 - going to insert a part into the game now
15:07 - I'm going to change the size of this
15:09 - part in the properties window to be one
15:11 - by one by one so that it's nice and
15:13 - small I'm going to set the anchored
15:15 - properties be true I'm going to make
15:16 - sure that can collide is set to false so
15:18 - that you can't step on it you would just
15:21 - walk straight through it you can't
15:22 - collide with it an anchored means that
15:24 - it won't move so it will just stay fixed
15:26 - in that position throughout the entire
15:27 - game so it can't get pushed around
15:29 - and then I'm going to move it wherever I
15:33 - want it to be so we could have a spawn
15:35 - over here but then I just to make sure
15:37 - that I put it inside of the egg spawns
15:39 - folder okay make sure it's in that
15:41 - folder by just dragging dragging it in
15:43 - there I'm also going to change the name
15:44 - of the part to spawn so we know what it
15:46 - is and then because we're gonna want
15:49 - quite a few spawns different random
15:51 - locations where the egg could go I'm
15:53 - going to just keep on duplicating this
15:55 - part so you can press ctrl D to
15:56 - duplicate it or command D if you're on a
15:58 - Mac okay and then a duplicate one has
16:01 - been spawned in the exact same location
16:03 - just drag it away
16:04 - okay so just keep on duplicating by
16:07 - pressing ctrl D or command D and
16:09 - dragging them in random places around
16:11 - the map put them wherever you like on
16:12 - the map okay and if you're finding it a
16:16 - little bit hard to select them you can
16:17 - press ctrl 2 or command 2 or
16:20 - alternatively you can click on the move
16:22 - button over here and then you can move
16:24 - them using these axes here which just
16:26 - makes it a little bit easier okay so
16:31 - I've just placed a lot of them around
16:33 - the map so these are going to be all of
16:34 - the places where the X could spawn now
16:37 - make sure that you've got quite a few of
16:38 - these because we do want them to be
16:39 - random and also make sure that you are
16:42 - putting them on the ground okay don't
16:43 - put them in the air because we're going
16:45 - to script them so that the eggs fall
16:47 - from the sky so just put these parts on
16:48 - the ground okay and make sure that they
16:51 - are in the egg spawns folder and it's
16:54 - also critical that all of these parts
16:56 - are set so that anchored is true or
16:59 - checked and the can collide is not
17:01 - checked okay once you've done that we're
17:03 - going to right click on export and click
17:05 - on selected children this should select
17:07 - all of these parts that we've just
17:08 - created again make sure that they're in
17:10 - the export folder then we're going to
17:13 - set their transparency value to 1 so
17:15 - that we can't see them they're invisible
17:16 - but they're still there so what we're
17:18 - going to do is we're going to write some
17:19 - code which we'll randomly selects apart
17:22 - from this folder so for example this one
17:24 - and then we're going to clone our egg a
17:28 - random egg out of our eggs fold it in a
17:31 - replicated storage and we're going to
17:32 - position it to be 10 studs higher from
17:35 - that brick so it's going to fall down
17:37 - into this position and then our egg is
17:40 - there and able to be collected
17:43 - so I'm going to deselect that part and
17:46 - just close our xforms folder and now I'm
17:49 - going to insert a script into service
17:51 - script service this is where we're going
17:53 - to keep our code so make sure you click
17:55 - on the plus and click on script and
17:58 - again all code from this project will be
18:01 - available to my channel members my
18:03 - premium channel members if you would
18:05 - like to become a channel member you can
18:07 - click on the join button below the video
18:08 - next to the subscribe button or if not
18:11 - you can just follow along and learn as
18:13 - we go along so I'm going to name this
18:16 - script egg spawns okay just so that we
18:20 - know what it does and we're going to
18:22 - firstly create a variable for the folder
18:25 - for our eggs in replicated storage so we
18:28 - say local eggs and then we're going to
18:31 - set that to be equal to game dot
18:33 - replicated storage and then we can say
18:36 - dot eggs okay and then we can say local
18:41 - spawns we're gonna do the exact same but
18:43 - for the egg spawns folder in the
18:45 - workspace equals game dot workspace got
18:48 - eggs forms okay so we've got our two
18:51 - folders here then every two seconds what
18:55 - we're going to do so every two seconds
18:57 - we want to choose a random egg and spawn
19:00 - and put the egg other location so we're
19:02 - gonna want to repeat the code every two
19:04 - seconds
19:05 - forever so for that we can do a while
19:07 - loop so we can say while wait and then
19:10 - in the brackets we put two for two
19:12 - seconds do and drop a line so anything
19:15 - inside of these two lines here anything
19:18 - inside of here
19:19 - so here we'll keep on running and it
19:22 - will repeat every two seconds so every
19:25 - two seconds a new egg is going to spawn
19:27 - so what we need to do is we need to
19:28 - create a table for all of the eggs that
19:31 - are in this folder so currently there's
19:33 - only one but if you had five or six or
19:35 - maybe even fifty we'd want to have a
19:38 - list of all of them and a table is
19:40 - basically a list a list of all the
19:41 - objects in that folder so we're gonna
19:44 - create another variable and a variable
19:46 - just hold some data for us to write to
19:49 - keep on referencing and using later on
19:51 - we're gonna create that variable for the
19:52 - four eggs table okay so eggs table you
19:56 - cause and then a quick way of getting a
19:58 - list of all of the items inside of that
20:00 - folder is firstly getting the folder
20:03 - which we've currently got through this
20:04 - variable called eggs and because they
20:07 - curl on get children with a pair of
20:12 - brackets or parentheses on the end and
20:14 - that will return to us a list of all of
20:17 - the eggs in that folder we're going to
20:19 - do a random pick now so it picks a
20:22 - random egg out of that table so we can
20:24 - say local random egg equals eggs table
20:28 - so we want to pick an item out of that
20:31 - table and to do that we use the square
20:33 - bracket so a pair of square brackets and
20:36 - then inside of these square brackets we
20:38 - need to have a number okay so a random
20:41 - number and that a random number will be
20:43 - between 1 and however many items there
20:46 - are in that table so if there were 5
20:48 - eggs it would be 1 and 5 so we say math
20:50 - dot random and then in these brackets 1
20:53 - comma and then hash tag eggs table when
20:56 - we do hash tag eggs table that will give
20:58 - us the amount of items in that table so
21:00 - if there's 50 then hash tag eggs table
21:02 - is going to be 50 so what this code does
21:04 - is it chooses a random egg from that
21:07 - table so currently it would always pick
21:09 - the random egg because it's the only one
21:11 - there but if you have more it would
21:12 - choose around the Mac then we're gonna
21:14 - do the same thing and we're gonna choose
21:15 - a random spawn so local spawns table
21:18 - equals spawns
21:20 - so those spawns in the workspace when we
21:23 - say it's : get children it's going to
21:26 - create a list of all of those spawns in
21:28 - that folder and then we can pick a
21:30 - random spawn so local random spawn
21:32 - equals spawns table and then we're
21:35 - picking a random spawn from that table
21:39 - by using math or andum which generates a
21:42 - random number between 1 and I however
21:44 - many spawns there are so if there's 50
21:45 - spawns it will give us a random number
21:47 - out of all of those spawns it'll give us
21:50 - a random spawn now that we've got our
21:52 - random egg we need to make a clone of it
21:55 - because we're not going to use the egg
21:56 - that's stored in replicated storage
21:57 - we're gonna create a clone of it so
21:59 - local egg clone equals a random egg
22:04 - Curlin clone and that will make a
22:06 - duplicate of it just like when we press
22:07 - control D or command D on the
22:10 - bored it made a clone of it we can then
22:12 - put that clone into the workspace so
22:15 - we're gonna create another folder in the
22:16 - workspace I'm going to call this folder
22:18 - spawned X so it's where all of the X
22:21 - that have spawned are going to go so we
22:23 - can say egg clone parent equals game dot
22:27 - workspace not spawned eggs okay so we've
22:31 - now put that egg into the workspace now
22:33 - let's set its position so we can say egg
22:35 - clone dots position equals now this is a
22:41 - little bit more advanced what I'm going
22:43 - to do is we're going to get the position
22:45 - of the random spawn that we just found
22:47 - so random spawn position and then to
22:51 - make it go into the air we're going to
22:53 - have to add 20 studs to its current Y
22:56 - position so why isn't the up and down
22:58 - position value and then we're gonna add
23:00 - on vector 3 new 0 comma 20 comma 0 ok so
23:04 - we are only adding 20 studs in the y
23:07 - axis so which is why the other values
23:09 - for x and z are 0 so that's going to put
23:12 - it 20 studs in the air above where it
23:14 - currently is now that we've set its
23:17 - position we can say egg clone anchored
23:21 - equals false and when it's been anchored
23:24 - it will fall to the ground so it will
23:25 - just fall from the sky into the ground
23:27 - how awesome is that if you go and play
23:30 - the game now you should see the eggs
23:32 - start falling from the sky into random
23:35 - locations so there we go we've just
23:36 - created our egg spawner but what if you
23:39 - want the egg when we touch it to make
23:42 - the GUI pop up telling us that we found
23:44 - it let's work on that next so the next
23:48 - thing to do is create a simple touched
23:50 - event and a touched event will fire some
23:52 - code when apart what in this case the
23:55 - egg has been touched so we're gonna say
23:57 - egg clone because that is the egg that
24:00 - will be in the game dot touch colon
24:03 - connect and then in these brackets we're
24:06 - going to write function with another
24:08 - pair of brackets and then drop a line
24:10 - and we'll have a closing bracket like
24:12 - this okay so when the egg is touched
24:15 - we're going to run a function and a
24:16 - function just contains some code which
24:19 - is what we're going to do here we're
24:21 - going to contain the code that we want
24:22 - to run when
24:23 - you step on the XO when you step on the
24:25 - egg we want to delete it but we also
24:27 - want to make the GUI appear so firstly
24:31 - we've got an argument here called hit
24:34 - and hit is going to be the object which
24:36 - touches the egg obviously we don't know
24:38 - what it is right now so we use hit as a
24:40 - placeholder for the part that touched it
24:43 - now hit is going to be a body part of
24:44 - your character so we need to check
24:46 - whether that part is an actual body part
24:49 - whether it's another part in the game
24:50 - maybe it switched another egg by
24:52 - accident we don't want it to run if it's
24:54 - not touched a player so we need to
24:56 - firstly check if it's a player by saying
24:59 - game dot players curl on gets player
25:02 - from character hits dot parents now if
25:05 - hit dot parent is a player's character
25:07 - model which it should be then this piece
25:11 - of code here is going to just check
25:13 - whether it is and it's going to return
25:14 - true or false so player or PLR is going
25:18 - to be true or false so if PLR is true
25:22 - then so if it is a player you can
25:25 - actually just say if player and that's a
25:28 - short way of doing it so if it is an
25:30 - actual player then we're going to make
25:33 - the GUI appear on this screen okay
25:35 - so to do that we're going to need to use
25:37 - remote events so I'm going to click on a
25:40 - replicated storage and insert the remote
25:42 - event I'm going to call this remote
25:43 - events found egg and then what we can do
25:47 - is we can say game replicated storage
25:50 - dot found egg curl on fire clients okay
25:53 - and then in these brackets we need to
25:55 - put the PLR when we say fire client we
25:58 - are basically sending a request to a
26:01 - certain player to do something on their
26:03 - end now because it's a GUI and the GUI
26:05 - is actually are stored on the player in
26:08 - their computer we need to send a message
26:10 - from the game to their player to make
26:13 - the GUI appear so we can fire this a
26:15 - remote event to that player we then need
26:18 - to write some code in the GUI to pick up
26:21 - that event and make the GUI appear okay
26:23 - so we're also going to then send some
26:26 - data with it so the piece of data that
26:28 - we're going to send is the eggs name so
26:30 - egg clone dot name because we need to
26:32 - tell the player which
26:34 - they picked up okay so once we've done
26:36 - this we can delete the egg so we can say
26:40 - egg clone curl on destroy and that will
26:42 - just remove the egg from the game
26:43 - because once they found it we just want
26:45 - to delete it next and the final thing
26:48 - for today's video we're going to go into
26:49 - that main GUI and insert a local script
26:52 - so that we can pick up this remote event
26:54 - I'm going to set the name of this script
26:55 - to be clients and inside of this local
26:59 - script we are firstly going to create a
27:01 - few variables so local GUI is going to
27:05 - be script parent that's just going to be
27:06 - the GUI object the frame is going to be
27:09 - the this one here the frame that's
27:12 - inside of the GUI so we say GUI Curlin
27:14 - wait for child frame just to make sure
27:16 - that it has loaded and we're ready to
27:17 - continue we don't want to continue the
27:19 - script before the frame and other things
27:21 - have loaded so we need to make sure
27:24 - they're fully loaded first so we've got
27:26 - the frame the okay button and the
27:28 - viewport frame these are the shortcuts
27:30 - they make it easier for us to quickly
27:32 - get the GUI element instead of having to
27:34 - always say script parent but frame dot
27:37 - viewport frame etc so once we've got our
27:39 - variables we can then create a remote an
27:44 - event that will pick up whenever that
27:46 - found egg is triggered or you know fired
27:50 - for our client so game dat workspace got
27:52 - found egged on client events : connects
27:54 - function and then inside of these
27:57 - brackets we're going to have the data
27:59 - that was sent and we don't put the
28:00 - player because that automatically gets
28:02 - sent we're going to have the egg name as
28:04 - an arguments here an argument is the
28:06 - data that gets sent from the server to
28:08 - from the server scripts to our GUI local
28:11 - scripts here so what we need to do is we
28:13 - need to actually firstly check to see if
28:16 - the egg is a real egg and it's actually
28:19 - in certain replicated storage so we can
28:21 - say if game don't replicate the storage
28:23 - got eggs cut I'll find first child egg
28:27 - name because there could be a mistake
28:29 - and the egg might not be there for some
28:30 - reason so if it is there then what we
28:33 - can do is create a clone of that egg so
28:37 - we can say local egg clone equals game
28:40 - or replicate the storage eggs and then
28:43 - in square brackets we can say egg name
28:45 - we don't need to use equity wait for
28:46 - child anymore we
28:47 - we are certain that it's there if we
28:49 - didn't use wait for child in the if
28:51 - statement and there was no egg it would
28:53 - cause an error so it's kind of like a
28:56 - fail-safe so it won't break the script
28:59 - if it isn't there so we're then cloning
29:02 - the egg from the replicated storage and
29:03 - we're going to parent it inside of the
29:05 - viewport frame so egg clone dot parent
29:08 - equals vpf for viewport frame when we
29:12 - want to show a 3d object in the GUI
29:14 - likeliest viewport frame
29:15 - I like this egg which which we want to
29:18 - show in the viewport frame any objects
29:20 - you do want to show has to go inside the
29:21 - viewport frame so that's why we've put
29:22 - the egg in the viewport frame then we're
29:25 - going to set the text of the you found
29:28 - text label so frame dots you found got
29:32 - text equals then we'll do a string and
29:35 - say you found then a space then a dot
29:38 - dot because we now need to put the name
29:40 - of the egg so you can say egg named dot
29:43 - dot and then some strings again a
29:45 - exclamation mark and the dot dots is a
29:48 - way of putting some data with a string
29:51 - okay so the egg name which we don't know
29:53 - we can put a dot dot and concatenate it
29:55 - together and that will make it appear in
29:56 - the GUI and the last thing to do is to
29:59 - create a camera in the viewport frame
30:02 - and the camera is the thing that will
30:04 - render whatever goes in the viewport so
30:06 - that we can actually see it so local
30:07 - camera equals instance dot new camera
30:10 - and the camera tells the viewport frame
30:13 - what we should be looking at so we can
30:15 - actually see the egg so camera dot
30:17 - parent needs to put it in the viewport
30:18 - frame and we need to set the viewport
30:21 - frames current camera property because
30:23 - the viewport frame has a property called
30:25 - current camera we need to set that to
30:28 - the camera and then we can set the
30:31 - cameras see frame so what it's looking
30:34 - at to be the egg clones see frame see
30:37 - frame is like a position value but it
30:40 - has the rotation element as well so it
30:41 - tells you how an object should be
30:43 - positioned and rotated so we're telling
30:46 - the camera to look at the egg but we
30:50 - need it to be a few studs away from it
30:52 - because if it was in the middle of the
30:54 - egg we wouldn't be able to see it
30:56 - anything could be inside of it so we are
30:58 - multiplying it by
31:00 - the eggs size on the z-axis x 1.5 okay
31:08 - and that just positions the camera away
31:09 - from the egg so that we can see it so
31:13 - that should be good to go I think I
31:15 - think the last thing to do is just to
31:16 - set the frame the frames visible
31:19 - property to true and also to clear the
31:22 - viewport frame of any children in it so
31:24 - vpf curl on clear all children because
31:27 - if we found another egg we would have
31:28 - the previous egg still stored in the
31:30 - viewport frame so we need to destroy it
31:32 - so we're just gonna say viewport frame
31:34 - clear all children and it will remove
31:35 - anything currently inside of it before
31:37 - we add the new egg okay so let's go
31:40 - ahead and test this out in fact there's
31:43 - one last thing that we need to add and
31:44 - that is a quick little mouse button one
31:48 - event so okay got mouse button one click
31:50 - curl on connect function and this is
31:55 - going to set the frame visible to false
31:58 - so that when we click the ok' button it
32:01 - will set the frames visibility's false
32:02 - so the GUI is hidden so it's kind of
32:04 - like a close button okay so now let's
32:07 - test the game out and see what happens
32:09 - so we're gonna have to walk up to one of
32:10 - our eggs and hopefully this does work
32:12 - first time let's walk up to the egg and
32:15 - there we go congratulations you found
32:18 - rainbow egg and when we click OK the GUI
32:21 - disappears how awesome is that so that
32:25 - was the first video in the egg hunt
32:27 - series if you're enjoying it please do
32:29 - subscribe to my channel because I do
32:31 - loads more videos teaching you how to
32:32 - make roblox games and robots from them
32:34 - don't forget to like the video as well
32:36 - so that I know you like it and I'll
32:38 - probably do some more videos I'm going
32:40 - to show you how you can save a player's
32:42 - eggs so that when they leave the game
32:43 - and rejoin they'll still be there and
32:45 - also also in the future I will probably
32:48 - be making a GUI that shows you all of
32:50 - the eggs that you've got and the ones
32:52 - that you've still yet to find so make
32:53 - sure you subscribe for that and I'll see
32:55 - you in the next video thank you for
32:57 - watching and I'll see you next time
32:58 - Cheers
32:59 - bye
