00:01 - okay in this video I'm going to quickly
00:02 - show you how to use get service so
00:06 - Roblox very powerful has a lot of
00:08 - services um which will give you access
00:11 - to the Roblox API Roblox API is
00:14 - essentially just a massive collection of
00:16 - functions and events uh and things that
00:19 - are created by Roblox which makes game
00:22 - creation a lot easier gives you access
00:24 - to things like data storage um
00:27 - purchasing stuff uh also SS okay so very
00:31 - simple all you say is
00:33 - game so you create a variable for your
00:36 - service and you say game get service and
00:39 - then you give the service name so many
00:41 - services to choose from I recommend you
00:44 - go to the uh object browser and just
00:47 - have a look through here there's so many
00:49 - different services that have different
00:51 - um uh you know different purposes uh
00:55 - such as the ad portal ad service for
00:57 - displaying immersive ads we've got loads
00:59 - of audio Services the main ones really
01:02 - are things like your HTTP Service
01:05 - Marketplace service um data store
01:09 - service but there's so many different
01:11 - ones pathf finding as well uh and they
01:13 - all have these functions they have these
01:15 - events
01:17 - functions which we can uh make use of
01:20 - right so we don't have to code them
01:21 - ourselves a lot of them we wouldn't be
01:22 - able to code ourselves because um you
01:25 - know Roblox is giving us quite a bit of
01:28 - power here so yeah I'll show you a
01:30 - couple of them you've got obviously
01:31 - you've got your um your main ones in the
01:34 - workspace replicated storage server
01:36 - storage script Serv script service
01:39 - they're the main ones really and then
01:40 - you've got things like Marketplace
01:43 - service which lets you um it lets you
01:47 - you know check if a user owns a game
01:49 - pass so user owns Game Pass async you
01:53 - just provide a Game Pass ID and a user
01:55 - ID you've got stuff like a prompt
01:59 - purchase so if you wanted to prompt a
02:01 - user to buy something you'd use it and
02:03 - that's what makes that popup appear
02:05 - which says do you want to buy this for
02:07 - 100 robu that's done using the
02:09 - marketplace service so you can see how
02:11 - these Services let you connect more
02:13 - things to your game it sort of gives it
02:15 - more functionality and this is just a
02:17 - Marketplace service right there's so
02:19 - many more services we've got data store
02:21 - service where if you say um game get
02:24 - service data store service you can do
02:27 - things such as get uh get data store and
02:30 - then you could say get a sync to get
02:32 - someone's data or you could use set a
02:34 - sync to set someone's data so that is
02:38 - the data store service and there's just
02:39 - so many that I can't go through in this
02:41 - video I'm just going to try and go
02:43 - through some of the the main ones that I
02:45 - use especially you've got the tween
02:47 - service for example tween service lets
02:49 - you smoothly animate um parts or
02:53 - guis so you could make it do a nice slow
02:57 - animation let me show you if I create a
02:59 - part over here and I want to slowly make
03:03 - it fade away I could say tween service
03:07 - create game. workspace dopart between
03:11 - info. new and I could say transparency
03:15 - equals one and I could say play uh this
03:19 - is going to make the part Fade Away
03:21 - watch
03:24 - this there it goes it's gone but it's
03:26 - still here because we've tweened it so
03:28 - using these server is just lets you um
03:31 - link up to to The Wider Roblox API and
03:35 - do all these cool things um you know
03:37 - this for example has saved me having to
03:39 - write a for Loop which would very slowly
03:42 - decrease the transparency but it also
03:44 - lets me have loads of properties I could
03:47 - set the easing style you know I could
03:49 - configure whether I want it to um
03:51 - reverse itself or whether I want a delay
03:54 - so so many really cool services and
03:58 - really all you need to do to get them is
03:59 - just say get
04:01 - service and set it as a variable like
04:03 - this and then that variable is it's
04:07 - almost like a table it's just full of
04:09 - all of these different events functions
04:12 - properties um that we can then use so it
04:16 - will be something you're using all the
04:18 - time if you're scripting and making
04:19 - games so just familiarize yourself with
04:22 - some of these Services um you know
04:24 - especially things like user input
04:26 - service um uh obviously the main ones as
04:30 - well like workspace replicated storage
04:33 - I'll probably make another video which
04:35 - explains their purposes but yeah
04:37 - Services really important and I
04:39 - hopefully this video has taught you a
04:41 - thing or two about them so if you
04:43 - enjoyed it let me know uh subscribe like
04:45 - and I'll see you in the next one
