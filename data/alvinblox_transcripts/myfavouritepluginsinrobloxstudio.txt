00:00 - hey guys Arvin blocks here in this video
00:01 - going to be reviewing the top of plugins
00:03 - that I use on a daily basis in roblox to
00:06 - do very very useful plugins are we
00:08 - leaving a link to all of them in the
00:09 - description but let's get started with
00:12 - the first plug-in which is row tasks and
00:14 - row tasks is created by avoided blade
00:17 - what it allows you to do is have notes
00:20 - in your scripts which then appear in
00:22 - this window so you can jump to certain
00:23 - areas in your script let me give you a
00:25 - quick example so let's just say we have
00:28 - a scripts what I can do is do a normal
00:31 - comment but then if I do two arrows like
00:34 - this and then a comma and sorry not a
00:38 - comment a colon after that : I can write
00:40 - a message and I could say this part is
00:43 - for the intermission and then later on I
00:48 - could say something else
00:49 - so just describing what this part of the
00:51 - script does etc and when you have code
00:56 - in between here you can your scripts can
00:59 - be really long so you might forget where
01:01 - a certain part is so what it allows you
01:03 - to do is when you're out of the scripts
01:05 - and you want to quickly jump to a
01:06 - certain piece of your code you can just
01:08 - click it and it will take you to that
01:10 - line if I was to put a load of spaces so
01:14 - let's imagine that they're they're quite
01:15 - far apart it will jump to the
01:17 - intermission or if I click down here to
01:19 - go to the game loop it's gonna take me
01:20 - straight there so a great plugin if you
01:23 - have lots of code and lots of scripts
01:24 - and you keep forgetting where certain
01:27 - parts of your code are located and you
01:29 - just need to quickly go to them to
01:31 - change something or or fix a book so
01:33 - really useful next plug-in is the tool
01:36 - grip edit or by clone trooper 1019 now
01:39 - you may have come across this problem
01:41 - before where you're creating a tool and
01:44 - then it doesn't fit on the character
01:47 - correctly so the tool grip editor lets
01:49 - you change this so when you click it it
01:51 - will say select a tool edit tool grip
01:53 - what it will do is it will place a
01:56 - player's arm on the tool and you can
02:00 - move this little green ball and that
02:03 - will move the the players arm relative
02:06 - to the gun so you can see in the window
02:08 - that the actual grip of the tool is
02:10 - changing so if I wanted to
02:12 - I actually changed the rotation of the
02:14 - tool I could do that so it could be
02:17 - pointing in your face and then what I'm
02:19 - doing I just need to UM click away
02:21 - deselect the tool and the changes have
02:24 - been applied you can see it's pointed in
02:27 - our faces just like we just positioned
02:29 - it with the tool grip editor so there
02:31 - you go great plugin if you're designing
02:33 - tools or weapons and you just can't make
02:36 - it fit on the characters aren't
02:37 - correctly okay
02:38 - next plug-in is the data store editor
02:40 - now this one is a lifesaver you may not
02:43 - be using data stores yourself but when
02:46 - you do it's very very useful so if
02:48 - somebody says that they lost data or
02:50 - their save slot got corrupted or you
02:54 - just want to be kind and give them some
02:55 - money in your game you can edit their
02:57 - data store without having to write any
02:59 - code let me give you an example of how
03:01 - this works so I'm here in one of my
03:03 - friends games and I'm going to access
03:05 - his data store by typing in the name of
03:08 - the data store so this is the name that
03:10 - you give when you call get data store on
03:12 - a datastore service so I'm just going to
03:14 - put mine in here and I don't need to
03:18 - bother with the scope I'm going to click
03:19 - on connect and now I've connected to
03:21 - that places data store system I now need
03:24 - to put in a player's key so each player
03:26 - in a data store will have their own key
03:28 - which uniquely identifies their data
03:30 - store so I can put that in and I'm going
03:32 - to change their money now I'm going to
03:34 - set this to 1077 okay I'm gonna click
03:40 - Save and when that is saved I can just
03:43 - disconnect or I can click this button
03:45 - and the the players data store will have
03:47 - been changed and you can now see that
03:49 - when I joined the game I have 1077 money
03:52 - because it was my data store that I
03:54 - edited so great plug-in if you need to
03:57 - change somebody's data store or even if
03:59 - you try to debug your data stores if
04:01 - it's not saving correctly you want to
04:03 - check the format etc really useful
04:05 - plugin ok next plug-in and this one is a
04:07 - very simple one it's called load
04:08 - character I've got the pro version but I
04:10 - think there's also a lite version that's
04:12 - free when you use it all you need to do
04:14 - is type in somebody's username I can put
04:16 - in my own and then I can click whether
04:19 - you want the are six version or the are
04:21 - 15 version or how the the player has
04:25 - he set their body to be and when you
04:27 - click one of those it will insert that
04:28 - player's character so great if you want
04:31 - to have some friends in your game or you
04:32 - just want to insert a character to play
04:34 - with or test with next one that I'm
04:37 - going to show you is get object path so
04:40 - this is really useful if you're in a
04:42 - script and you want to access an object
04:44 - that's nested within a load of objects
04:46 - and you're too lazy like me to actually
04:49 - get the path of the object so instead of
04:52 - having to say game door workspace the
04:53 - album block start left low arm got left
04:55 - wrist rig attachment that's a lot of
04:58 - typing so all you need to do is open up
05:01 - the output window and then just go to
05:04 - the plug-in and there it is get object
05:07 - path boom
05:09 - it will get the path of the selected
05:11 - item in the Explorer and it will put it
05:14 - in the output so all you need to do is
05:15 - just copy it and put it into a script it
05:20 - should work fine just saying workspace
05:22 - don't you say game dat workspace and
05:24 - because that is a shortcut right next
05:26 - plug-in that we're going to look at is
05:28 - UI design by style rack now this is a
05:31 - brilliant plug-in if you're making GUI
05:34 - is now you may remember round if I it's
05:36 - a plug-in that I've featured before on
05:38 - the channel but this is a great way of
05:40 - helping you make UI user interface if
05:44 - you're not very good at all that stuff
05:46 - so let me show you if I have a UI
05:48 - element
05:48 - you've got the round the fire feature
05:51 - which lets you make a frame around it
05:55 - with rounded edges like this so I use it
05:57 - quite a lot in UI design we've also got
06:00 - the drop shadow effect what that lets
06:02 - you do is apply a nice little shadow to
06:05 - the GUI I'm going to show you click
06:08 - create shadow boom you can also edit
06:10 - that so if you don't want the shadow to
06:12 - be as thick you can just change the
06:14 - offset here loads of things that you can
06:16 - change you can also change the color so
06:19 - it could have a green drop shadow so
06:21 - really really nice we've also gotten
06:23 - this is probably the best feature of it
06:25 - positioning tools so you can just
06:26 - quickly position something in the top
06:30 - left corner top right corner wherever
06:31 - you want any corner just click the
06:33 - corner you want and click position boom
06:35 - you can have down here have it in the
06:36 - middle and you can see it
06:39 - it stays in the middle even if you
06:41 - changed the screen size so that's
06:42 - brilliant because it uses scale we've
06:44 - also got a class converter so you could
06:46 - change it to a different element or UI
06:49 - type so if you wanted to change this to
06:52 - be an image label you can just click it
06:53 - click convert and boom is changed you
06:55 - can make a scrolling frame boom changed
06:57 - or a text button and it's gonna keep the
06:59 - original properties it's gonna make it's
07:01 - gonna retain its position its size etc
07:03 - so all around great plug-in you've also
07:06 - got a create UI as well so you can
07:08 - insert a frame inside a frame just a
07:10 - quick way of having to go into objects
07:11 - and search for the thing you want to
07:14 - insert so very very very cool well done
07:16 - Starex and I do recommend you go
07:18 - download this one next plug-in is a
07:20 - little bit similar to the one we've just
07:22 - looked at by stellar X in regards to the
07:25 - class converter but this is called
07:27 - reclass by Altaf it's a really good
07:30 - class converter and you can use it on
07:31 - other things such as scripts so you can
07:34 - click convert and it will say you need
07:36 - to enable HTTP requests so you need to
07:38 - go over here get em settings options
07:40 - HTTP requests save then you need to go
07:44 - to convert and you can see you can
07:46 - change it to our local scripts boom is
07:48 - changed or a modular script so it's
07:50 - gonna give you objects that you can
07:53 - change this one to and it's going to
07:54 - keep the same properties so let me give
07:56 - you an example if I insert a part if I
07:59 - wanted to then change it to a spawn
08:00 - location I'd have to create the part all
08:02 - over again but I can just click boom
08:04 - change it to a spawn location witch
08:06 - house has changed the class name so this
08:08 - is now actually a spawn location but
08:10 - it's kept the color it's kept the
08:11 - material the size position everything
08:13 - has been kept the same but it has
08:16 - changed its class so really really good
08:17 - plugin but what I love about the plug-in
08:19 - is that you can automatically change it
08:21 - so if you don't want to bother with
08:23 - going to this converts tab because we're
08:25 - all lazy and we don't want to do that
08:26 - what's gonna do is it's going to decide
08:28 - the best class to change it to it's
08:31 - gonna it's going to try and determine
08:32 - what you're gonna use it for so this is
08:35 - a remote event it can either be a remote
08:37 - event or remote function so I click
08:38 - automatic and boom it changes it to a
08:40 - remote function and again it changed it
08:42 - to a bindable function sorry there are
08:45 - four types remote event remote function
08:48 - bindable event bundle function it's
08:49 - going to change it to what it thinks is
08:51 - best for you so
08:52 - going to try and guess so if I click
08:55 - automatic it's gonna change to a script
08:56 - because we're in service Crypt service
08:57 - so really really could plug in really do
08:59 - like this one well done I'll talk on
09:01 - creating that we've also got another
09:03 - plugin by L table and that is mg and
09:06 - what mg allows you to do is if you have
09:09 - a decal ID and some of you may know the
09:12 - struggle here when you upload a decal to
09:15 - roblox sometimes the ID won't work and
09:18 - you have to do that thing where you have
09:20 - to subtract 1 from the ID and you have
09:23 - to keep going back and back and back
09:24 - until you find the correct imager ID
09:27 - this is just a really simple way it does
09:29 - it for you so if you were to go and find
09:30 - a decal and I've copied one from the
09:33 - roblox website if I just paste it in
09:35 - there well it's done it's got me the
09:37 - image ID it's also given me the short
09:40 - RBX
09:41 - asset ID version and it's also given me
09:43 - the long URL as well all I need to do is
09:45 - just paste this into the image and it's
09:48 - given me the ID which is really really
09:50 - great and this is useful when you're
09:51 - scripting and you want to change the ID
09:53 - of an image button or an image label or
09:56 - a decal object from a script you would
09:58 - need to write this out it just gives you
10:00 - a really quick URL for you to copy and
10:03 - paste so great-looking there I use that
10:05 - I don't use it that often but it does
10:07 - come in handy sometimes so it's a good
10:09 - one to have now let's see what else have
10:11 - we got here this is a good plugin this
10:13 - is the welding plug-in by Ossie pig
10:16 - because welding can be a bit confusing
10:17 - if you're new to roblox and it can just
10:21 - take a while even for for me even it's
10:23 - what I would want to weld a couple of
10:25 - things together
10:25 - now what if I didn't want to anchor
10:27 - these parts because I want them to fall
10:29 - to the ground I want them I want to be
10:30 - able to play with them with the physics
10:32 - but I want them to all be stuck together
10:33 - like like Lego blocks you see that
10:35 - they're welded together so what this
10:37 - plug-in does is it lets you create those
10:39 - welds so I can go into the world editor
10:42 - here this is quite confusing I don't use
10:44 - this very much but you can do weld all
10:47 - and that's going to create a weld and
10:48 - it's going to basically put all these
10:50 - parts weld them together so that they're
10:51 - stuck together but they are not anchored
10:53 - so great plug-in and I do recommend it
10:56 - next plug-in that we're going to look at
10:58 - is the instance tagging by I think it's
11:01 - sweet dark taupe and that is a hard use
11:04 - name to pronounce but the
11:05 - the link will be in the description what
11:08 - it does and I've done a video on
11:09 - collection service before so I'm not
11:10 - gonna go over it too much it lets you
11:12 - add tags to object so I could say I
11:14 - could give it a tag called important
11:16 - script and if I had lots of scripts in
11:18 - the game like a tag certain wonders
11:20 - being an important script or an
11:21 - important part and what you can then do
11:24 - is when you've tagged all of your object
11:26 - that you want to have that tag you can
11:28 - access them all via a script so that's
11:31 - what collection service is about and the
11:33 - tag editor just lets you apply those
11:35 - tags to them so really really good
11:37 - plug-in that the next plug-in is easy
11:40 - crop by owner walk this is a great
11:42 - plug-in again for user interface so what
11:46 - this plugin allows you to do is if we
11:48 - head into the image button click crop
11:51 - you can see it brings you up a nice
11:55 - little editing window so you can select
11:57 - a certain part of the image the Europe
11:59 - that you want to show so you may just
12:00 - want to crop this decal down or this
12:02 - this image and all I need to do is
12:04 - select so I'm going to crop it as a
12:06 - button or a label so if I want it to be
12:08 - a button it's going to insert it as an
12:11 - image label but if I want it to be an
12:12 - image button its gonna insert that image
12:14 - button for me you can also flip it so
12:17 - you can reverse the image on the X or
12:19 - y-axis and can change the size as well
12:21 - so if you want it to be 10 by 10 boom
12:24 - just insert it there and it's gonna it's
12:26 - gonna insert that for you so really
12:28 - really great look in there from on a go
12:30 - and I do love it image size I pretty
12:33 - sure it's the size of the crop window so
12:36 - you can see if I set it here there's
12:37 - kind of like a bit of snapping but if I
12:40 - was to change the resolution here to
12:42 - something huge you see it's it's much
12:45 - more and smoother so there we go
12:48 - great little plugin there and very
12:50 - useful for the UI designers out there
12:52 - that we're gonna look at today is minify
12:54 - so if you have a script that is really
12:57 - unordered so let's give you an example
12:59 - here like this and it's just not
13:02 - organized it's not tabbed it's not you
13:04 - know it's not very good what you can do
13:06 - is you can just and click minify and
13:10 - down here this little UI will appear and
13:14 - it says do you want to be you defy or
13:15 - minify and you want to keep it pretty
13:19 - or make the script small or as small as
13:21 - it can be just to save data and make it
13:24 - a little bit more efficient but it's not
13:27 - going to be efficient that you can
13:29 - notice the optimization so I don't
13:31 - recommend doing that I'm gonna do keep
13:33 - Global's and just do folding now if we
13:36 - preview this look how it's changed the
13:38 - script so it was that before but it's
13:40 - now made it look beautiful like this so
13:42 - create and what it does is it just
13:44 - updates the script it puts a beautified
13:46 - version in there so you can get rid of
13:49 - this original script and use the
13:51 - beautified version but I recommend that
13:53 - you do keep the old script just in case
13:55 - something goes wrong and you need to get
13:57 - the old one back so great little plugin
13:59 - there so we've got one that I've just
14:01 - enabled here because I've got too many
14:02 - plugins on the on the screen here is
14:05 - insert asset and this is by Z Kevin now
14:09 - all you need to do is paste an asset ID
14:11 - for an item from the catalogue in here
14:13 - click confirm and it's going to add it
14:14 - into the game and that way you can just
14:17 - instead of having to look for it in
14:19 - three models whatever you've got the
14:21 - added in the game which is really really
14:23 - awesome and one last plug-in I'm going
14:26 - to show you is called words of
14:27 - encouragement now it's a cool little
14:29 - plugin it's currently disabled for me to
14:33 - enable it though if you have disabled it
14:35 - you can go right click on a window and
14:37 - click on words of encouragement so what
14:39 - this will do is it will insert a player
14:43 - from your friends list with a
14:45 - motivational message so this person here
14:48 - lene 2009 saying be proud of your work
14:50 - then actually saying that but it's been
14:53 - generated by the plugin so pretty cool
14:55 - it updates every couple of minutes and
14:56 - it's a nice little thing to to look at
14:58 - and every time every five minutes a new
15:01 - one comes up so it doesn't really help
15:02 - you in any way but it's a nice cool
15:04 - plugin that's been trending recently and
15:06 - I like it so and every time you're going
15:08 - to play solo to test your game a new
15:11 - person will appear as well with a new
15:13 - message so that's pretty cool there we
15:15 - go so shout out to to those guys so
15:19 - there we go they are all the plugins
15:21 - that I use on a regular basis let me
15:23 - know if you want to see more of these in
15:25 - the future because I do use more plugins
15:27 - on my other computers as well and
15:30 - because I don't use this one all the
15:32 - time and development so
15:33 - I do have more plugins to possibly show
15:35 - you in the future so let me know if you
15:37 - do like this type of video and give it a
15:40 - thumbs up let me know that you liked it
15:41 - don't forget to subscribe if you're new
15:42 - over here for more roblox scripting
15:44 - videos and I'll see you in the next one
15:46 - Cheers
15:47 - bye
