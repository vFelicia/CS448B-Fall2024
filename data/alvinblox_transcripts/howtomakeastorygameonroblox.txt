00:00 - today i'm going to show you how i made
00:02 - this story game and if you're wondering
00:04 - why this video is so short don't worry
00:06 - i'll give you a full tutorial on how i
00:08 - made it from scratch so you can too and
00:10 - i'll reveal it somewhere in this video
00:12 - so keep watching because trust me you
00:15 - don't want to miss this one
00:19 - firstly we start by building the lobby
00:22 - where you can spawn in the idea is you
00:24 - jump on one of these trucks which will
00:26 - take you to the story place inside each
00:29 - truck is a script which after 30 seconds
00:32 - pushes it in the forward direction and
00:34 - teleports everyone to the story game now
00:37 - i bet you're wondering how do you
00:39 - teleport the players to their own
00:41 - separate story
00:43 - allows you to house multiple places
00:46 - under one game so you can have a place
00:48 - for your lobby and a place for your
00:50 - story game all i had to do was create
00:53 - that new place and then in my teleporter
00:55 - script each time a truck leaves the
00:57 - lobby i get all of the players sitting
01:00 - in the truck and i reserve a new server
01:02 - for that story game place and i teleport
01:05 - them all to that new server
01:07 - and then the story begins
01:09 - so in the story game place i created
01:12 - this text ticker to do this i created a
01:15 - script which got a headshot image of my
01:17 - character to be the narrator and i
01:19 - created a function which writes the text
01:21 - out in typewriter form so it looks like
01:24 - speech this is hooked up to a remote
01:26 - event so that i can easily fire this
01:28 - typewriter effect from the server
01:31 - now moving on to the status bar i
01:33 - created a simple gui at the top of the
01:35 - screen as well as a string value in
01:38 - replicated storage the idea is i set the
01:40 - string value to be what i want to show
01:42 - on the screen for example get settled
01:45 - into the camp or night is approaching
01:48 - then in the gui script i have an event
01:51 - which basically listens out when
01:53 - something changes in this case when the
01:55 - text of the status changes it will fire
01:57 - our code to update that text this lets
02:00 - me change the text of the status for all
02:02 - players from one server script which
02:04 - we'll get onto next so i had to create
02:07 - the story now to do this i made this
02:09 - server script and inside it i'll be able
02:12 - to update the status bar and text ticker
02:15 - easily for all players the premise of
02:17 - the story is simple it goes like this
02:20 - firstly everybody gets settled into the
02:22 - camp while the sun goes down and then
02:25 - rain starts to fall so everyone goes to
02:27 - the cave to shelter
02:29 - but we left the food basket outside and
02:31 - it's getting wet so somebody needs to go
02:34 - back and guess it otherwise everyone
02:36 - will go hungry when the basket gets
02:38 - returned suddenly you realize that one
02:40 - of the sandwiches is poisoned and
02:42 - whoever at it is going to die so someone
02:44 - is ejected from the game
02:46 - and then the cave caves in and everybody
02:49 - is trapped that's why we're gonna leave
02:51 - the story after five steps but after
02:54 - you've watched my tutorial you'll be
02:55 - able to add more to your story by
02:58 - yourself as you can see it's as easy as
03:00 - setting the status value and firing the
03:02 - remote event to update the text ticker
03:05 - with the text for each stage of the
03:07 - story also i use bindable events to
03:10 - detect when actions relating to the
03:12 - story occur such as picking up the
03:14 - basket i just spoke about when these
03:16 - events fire the status and text ticker
03:18 - are updated again since the story is
03:20 - moving on so it gives us a way to detect
03:23 - when the player has done something so
03:25 - that we can move on now click the
03:27 - thumbnail in the middle of the screen
03:28 - and i'll show you how to code everything
03:30 - i just showed you from scratch and don't
03:32 - forget to subscribe to my channel if you
03:34 - want to see more roblox content teaching
03:37 - you how to make games like this i really
03:39 - appreciate it thank you so much for
03:40 - watching and i'll see you in the next
03:42 - video which is on your screen now
