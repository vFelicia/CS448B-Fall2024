00:00 - in this section of videos I'm gonna be
00:02 - teaching you about GUI is in roblox
00:04 - everything you need to know about how
00:06 - they work so firstly you should know
00:09 - that GU is graphical user interfaces
00:11 - they show things on the screen for the
00:15 - player so any thing that you see in the
00:19 - game in a roblox game that is 2d on the
00:22 - screen so like text or images or you
00:27 - know those the UI the user interface
00:30 - that's made up of GUI elements so
00:34 - there's lots of different GUI elements
00:35 - things like text labels text buttons
00:38 - frames image labels and they all work
00:42 - together to create the interface that
00:44 - you see in most roblox games one all
00:47 - roblox games will have Q eyes now there
00:50 - are things called core GU eyes and they
00:54 - differ from normal GUI ice because core
00:57 - GU eyes look the core GUI is made by
01:00 - roblox so it's things like the chat
01:02 - window the top bar the leaderboard all
01:07 - of these things are made by roblox they
01:10 - come in every single game so we call
01:12 - them the core GUI and you can see in
01:14 - core GUI here if I was to delete
01:16 - everything in the core GUI they would
01:19 - just all go away apart from the chat but
01:22 - that's somewhere else obviously and the
01:24 - core GUI by the way don't worry about
01:26 - that you only see it when the game is
01:29 - running and we never really touch it
01:31 - anyway because it's all managed by
01:32 - roblox anyway so all GU eyes will go
01:36 - into the starter GUI now each player in
01:41 - the game has their own container for GU
01:45 - eyes because it's likely that different
01:49 - players in the game will have different
01:51 - GU eyes visible at one time so for
01:55 - example in a murder game the murderer is
01:58 - going to be shown a different GUI than
02:01 - an innocent person to show that they are
02:03 - innocent so the each player is going to
02:05 - have a slightly different folder of GUIs
02:10 - so if we put in a
02:13 - GUI a screen gon starts to UI and I just
02:16 - name it test if we actually just
02:19 - launched a server here so I can show you
02:22 - so it may look a little bit confusing at
02:25 - first but what we've got here is we've
02:27 - just opened up a roblox game and on that
02:29 - we've got two players in the game on the
02:31 - Left we've got player one on the right
02:33 - we've got player two so each player will
02:36 - have their own collection of GUIs
02:40 - so that if you wanted to change GUI for
02:43 - a certain player we could do that so
02:45 - when the game starts and a new player
02:48 - enters the game what happens is
02:50 - everything that's inside of the starter
02:51 - GUI gets copied and it gets put into a
02:55 - folder inside each player called player
02:58 - GUI so if we look in here in game dot
03:01 - players and a certain player object so
03:03 - player one you can see there's a folder
03:06 - called player GUI and in there we've got
03:09 - a couple of core GUI as well so things
03:11 - like the bubble chat but if we've also
03:13 - got our test GUI so this is a clone of
03:16 - the one in started GUI so if I had
03:20 - created the GUI so just got a GUI here
03:27 - and actually I need to just so I've
03:34 - restarted the test place and I've edited
03:38 - the tested GUI and started GUI so this
03:42 - test GUI has now been cloned into the
03:45 - player GUI for player 1 it's also been
03:48 - done for player 2 as well so every
03:49 - player in the game will have their own
03:51 - copy of the GUI from started GUI so if
03:55 - we wanted to change what this GUI said
03:59 - midway through the game well
04:02 - unfortunately you can't just go in to
04:04 - start a GUI change that GUI that was in
04:08 - there originally and expect that it's
04:11 - going to update for all players so if I
04:12 - change text of the text button to by you
04:17 - see nothing happens because it's only
04:18 - changed the the GUI that's stored in the
04:22 - starter GUI but we know that GUI is only
04:26 - appear
04:26 - on a player screen when we're actually
04:28 - in a running game if it's in the player
04:30 - GUI so we have to update every player's
04:34 - GUI manually so we'd have to go into
04:38 - that player GUI and change it there and
04:41 - now in the player GUI if we change it to
04:43 - say by you can see it changes so this
04:47 - GUI in player GUI and this GUI in
04:49 - started July they are two completely
04:52 - different things you can't just update
04:53 - one and think that it's gonna change for
04:55 - all players because it won't it will
04:56 - only change in that started GUI but no
04:59 - GUI eyes are rendered in a running game
05:02 - when they're inside have started to UI
05:03 - because when a player joins the game or
05:05 - they reset just like their character
05:07 - resets the GU eyes get pulled out of
05:10 - started GUI and basically the game
05:12 - copies them and places them into the
05:14 - player GUI you can also see that because
05:17 - I've changed player wounds the text of
05:21 - the text button for player ones player
05:22 - GUI what's happened is it stayed the
05:26 - same for player two and that's because
05:28 - as I said earlier each player is going
05:30 - to have their own player GUI so if you
05:32 - change one players play GUI then it will
05:35 - then be different to someone else's if
05:36 - you wanted to change player 2 so then
05:38 - we'd have to go in and change theirs as
05:41 - well and now we can both we have though
05:44 - basically the same GUI now because it's
05:47 - got the same text but the test GUI in
05:51 - player two's plays UI is a completely
05:54 - different object to the test GUI in
05:56 - player ones even though they've got the
05:58 - same names and everything completely
05:59 - different things so we've got three
06:01 - different GUI say we've got one in
06:03 - started GUI and that's the that's the
06:05 - one that's copied out and put into each
06:07 - player started GUI into each player's
06:09 - player GUI when they reset so we've got
06:12 - that one then we've also got this one in
06:13 - player 1 and this one and player 2 so
06:16 - three different GU eyes now also you can
06:20 - only change your own player GUI so if
06:24 - we're looking at player one over here
06:26 - and let's pretend that we are player one
06:28 - if we went in and try to change player
06:31 - two's player GUI you can see we can't
06:33 - see it
06:34 - and we're unable to access player two's
06:36 - player GUI weren't able to you know
06:39 - change it
06:40 - that's because players in the game can't
06:42 - change other people's GU eyes because if
06:44 - somebody decided to be naughty and
06:47 - exploit the game and wanted to change
06:49 - some with GUI we can't allow that
06:51 - so roblox prevents you from changing
06:53 - anybody else's player GUI only that
06:56 - player can change it ok so again if we
06:59 - and now if we're on player to side on
07:02 - the right because we're playing as
07:04 - player two over here we can access
07:06 - player two's player gy but again we
07:09 - can't access player ones from player two
07:12 - we can only access player one from over
07:13 - here on the left because on the left
07:15 - we've what we've got two completely
07:18 - different instances of roblox running
07:20 - pretend they're on each side of the
07:22 - screen you've got two players playing
07:25 - roblox ok obviously they wouldn't have
07:27 - access to the explorer or property or
07:29 - properties or things like that but we're
07:31 - in roblox studio so we can emulate this
07:33 - but what I'm trying to say is that you
07:35 - can't change any other players GUIs
07:38 - because you only have access to your own
07:40 - player GUI and you only have access to
07:43 - that if you were exploiting anyway but
07:46 - that's a completely different story what
07:48 - you need to know is that's G wise they
07:51 - get copied out off the started GUI when
07:54 - a player joins the game or respawns what
07:58 - happens is the GU eyes everything inside
08:00 - starts GUI so all the children will get
08:03 - copied and put into the players player
08:06 - GUI now the player GUI is automatically
08:11 - created we don't have to make it in a
08:12 - script or anything it's it's managed by
08:15 - a roblox core script so all done for us
08:18 - in the background so every time a player
08:20 - joins or resets the entire contents of
08:23 - started GUI copied out of the starter
08:26 - GUI into the player GUI of that player
08:28 - ok so every single player in the game
08:31 - will have their own player to your wife
08:33 - this means that the things that are
08:35 - shown on a player's screen can be
08:37 - different to another players and we can
08:39 - change certain players play a GUI now
08:42 - only that player can change their own
08:44 - clay GUI but we can also change
08:48 - certain players GU ice or all players in
08:51 - the game we could change all of their GU
08:53 - eyes from a server script now that's
08:56 - probably what we will look at in the
08:57 - next video so if you've enjoyed this one
08:59 - please do leave it to like let me know
09:02 - what else you want to know about GU eyes
09:03 - when we cover them and covering them in
09:05 - the next set of videos be sure to
09:07 - subscribe to the channel for more roblox
09:09 - scripting videos and I'll leave a
09:12 - thumbnail to the next video on the
09:14 - screen so thanks for watching
09:16 - Cheers bye
