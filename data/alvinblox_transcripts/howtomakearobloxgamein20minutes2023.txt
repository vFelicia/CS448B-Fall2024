00:00 - in this video I'm showing you how to
00:01 - make a roblox game fast we're gonna be
00:04 - creating an obstacle style game which
00:06 - you can create with roblox to do publish
00:08 - for free and play with your friends
00:11 - let's get started welcome to my channel
00:13 - my name is Alvin blocks and I am all
00:15 - about how can you learn to make awesome
00:16 - games and on robux on roblox so make
00:18 - sure to subscribe if you're interested
00:20 - as I have a lots more videos like this
00:22 - well today we're gonna be learning how
00:24 - to create an obstacle course in under 20
00:26 - minutes so let's get started
00:28 - so first thing that you're gonna need to
00:29 - do is install roblox studio now to do
00:32 - that there will be a link in the
00:33 - description you need to go to roblox
00:35 - cocom slash create once you're there
00:38 - click on the start creating button and
00:40 - that's going to check if you have roblox
00:42 - studio installed now if you do it should
00:44 - automatically start but if not it will
00:46 - walk you through the process of getting
00:48 - it installed now once you have roblox
00:50 - studio opened we're gonna select the
00:52 - baseplate template this is all we're
00:54 - gonna need to create our obstacle course
00:56 - from scratch now I'm gonna give you a
00:58 - quick overview of roblox studio and how
01:00 - you can use it so roblox studio is a
01:02 - powerful tool which you use to create
01:04 - roblox games every game on the platform
01:06 - uses it and it's got loads of features
01:08 - which allow you to build and code so
01:11 - we're gonna need to open up a few panels
01:13 - and I'm gonna give you a quick guide of
01:15 - them before we start these panels are
01:17 - going to be the Explorer window which is
01:19 - over here the properties window and the
01:21 - toolbox now if you don't see any of
01:24 - these windows to open up the toolbox
01:26 - click on home and blend you will see the
01:28 - button here to open it and close it and
01:30 - also the same goes for the Explorer
01:32 - window and the properties window you can
01:35 - open and close them by going to the View
01:37 - tab and then clicking on Explorer and
01:39 - properties so what do we use these for
01:42 - so the Explorer is used to show
01:45 - everything that's in your game world so
01:47 - if we open up the workspace here you can
01:49 - see we have a base plate and we can use
01:52 - the properties tab down here to change
01:54 - what it looks like and how it acts when
01:57 - the game is running so for example its
01:59 - color the tool box over here is used to
02:02 - insert a models created by other people
02:04 - so for example we could drag in a tree
02:07 - like this and there's loads of different
02:10 - models which you can use when it creates
02:12 - your own game but today we're gonna be
02:14 - creating our obstacle course completely
02:16 - from scratch with parts we're gonna be
02:18 - using the part tool and the four main
02:21 - tools to edit apart
02:23 - select move scale and rotate so let's
02:27 - get started with our obstacle course I'm
02:28 - going to select this baseplate in the in
02:31 - the game here now when I select it I'm
02:34 - going to set the color back to grey like
02:37 - this for now now what I'm going to do is
02:39 - I'm gonna scroll down to where it says
02:41 - size and I'm going to set it to 20 studs
02:43 - by two studs by 20 studs this just means
02:47 - that the size of the base plate will be
02:50 - 20 studs you see one stood here 20 on
02:53 - this axis 20 on this axis but it's only
02:55 - going to be two studs high like this so
02:57 - this is gonna be our spawn area where
02:59 - our players are going to get teleported
03:01 - to when they join or if they reset so
03:04 - I'm gonna change this now to be C green
03:07 - okay you can color it whatever you want
03:09 - and I'm also going to click on surface
03:11 - down here in the properties window and
03:13 - I'm going to set top surface to smooth
03:16 - once you've done that I'm gonna give it
03:17 - a name I'm just gonna call it base and
03:19 - set a base plate and I'm going to click
03:22 - on it and I'm going to right click and
03:24 - duplicate this is gonna create a clone
03:26 - of the pot so now we can just drag it
03:29 - and you can see we have two one on top
03:31 - of the other now I'm gonna resize this
03:33 - part by using the scale tool so click
03:35 - scale and then drag the red circle to
03:38 - make it two studs then I'm gonna use the
03:41 - Move tool to drag it away and create a
03:44 - border on the outside of this base part
03:46 - then I can change the brick color to
03:49 - black now all I have to do is duplicate
03:51 - again by pressing ctrl D or command D
03:53 - and then just move it along to the other
03:56 - side like this we can do the same thing
03:58 - again duplicate it and this time we're
04:00 - gonna need to rotate it for this side of
04:02 - the pot so you can either use the rotate
04:04 - tool like this or you can press ctrl R
04:07 - and that will rotate it 90 degrees now
04:10 - we can move it to the side of the face
04:12 - and drag it down and we're just gonna
04:15 - resize it so that now we start to see
04:18 - this black border on the side of our
04:20 - part so let's duplicate it again by
04:22 - pressing ctrl D or command D and we're
04:24 - going to use the Move tool to
04:26 - move it over to the other side just like
04:28 - that there we go we've created our spawn
04:31 - area let's select these parts here these
04:34 - border parts you can't select them in
04:36 - the game you have to select them in the
04:38 - Explorer that's because they're locked
04:40 - so you don't have to have them locks I'm
04:42 - going to turn locks off for now and you
04:43 - can see now that we've unchecked the
04:45 - locks property we can select them so
04:47 - select the borders and the base and make
04:50 - sure that anchored is set to true
04:51 - anchored basically means whether the
04:53 - part is gonna stay in the air or whether
04:55 - it's gonna fall to the ground now we
04:56 - want this to be stuck in a fixed
04:58 - position so we're gonna keep anchored
04:59 - set to true now that we've done that
05:01 - we're gonna need to create a spawn part
05:03 - which is where our player is going to be
05:04 - teleported to when they join the game so
05:07 - click on the module tab and click on
05:08 - spawn let's drag it down onto our base
05:11 - and I'm gonna use the scale tool to make
05:14 - it a little bit smaller I'm gonna click
05:15 - on the green circle I'm gonna hold down
05:17 - shift and this will just make sure that
05:19 - when we resize it it keeps the ratio for
05:22 - each axis but I'm gonna click on the
05:23 - model first and where it says move I'm
05:26 - just gonna turn this off okay this
05:28 - allows us to have no snapping we can
05:30 - move it with no increment so we can move
05:33 - it wherever you want and now I hold down
05:35 - shift and I scale down in the spawn part
05:38 - and now we can just drag it on to our
05:42 - spawn area and I'm gonna delete this
05:43 - decal this image on top of the spawn
05:46 - just by clicking on top I'm gonna click
05:48 - on delete there we go we've just created
05:50 - our spawn area now let's create our
05:52 - first obstacle some rainbow jumps let's
05:55 - insert a part I'm gonna turn snap to
05:57 - grid back on and I'm gonna set it to one
05:58 - stood and with this part I'm just gonna
06:00 - drag it so it goes against this black
06:03 - border I'm gonna scale it down so it's
06:04 - the same depth and I'm gonna scale it
06:06 - across like this next I'm just gonna
06:09 - move it away from the border I'm gonna
06:11 - make sure that it's anchored so it
06:13 - doesn't fall out of the sky and we're
06:15 - gonna use the scale tool to make it a
06:17 - little bit bigger like that okay
06:20 - I'm gonna give it a color let's do red
06:22 - for now and then I'm going to select it
06:24 - and I'm gonna duplicate it again I'm
06:25 - gonna right click and press duplicate or
06:27 - ctrl D and I'm gonna move it across with
06:30 - the move tool now if you want to quickly
06:33 - access these tools select move scale and
06:36 - rotate
06:36 - you can press down control or command if
06:39 - you're on a Mac and press either 1 2 3
06:41 - or 4 for each tool 3 is for scale
06:45 - 2 is for move one is for selects and 4
06:47 - is for a rotation so I'm going to move
06:50 - this part along and I'm gonna duplicate
06:52 - again and just keep making these jumps
06:54 - which go higher and higher a bit like a
06:56 - staircase now once you've got enough you
06:59 - can start but I'm just going to take
07:00 - three more and duplicate them all at
07:02 - once by selecting them and also I'm just
07:05 - going to make sure they all look good
07:06 - like that okay so now I've got my jumps
07:09 - we can start curling them differently so
07:11 - I'm gonna use this color tool up here
07:12 - we're gonna click on this arrow I'm
07:14 - gonna make sure that color action is
07:16 - tool is selected that allows us to paint
07:18 - a loads of bricks at once so selects a
07:21 - color and then make sure that you
07:23 - selected the color tool and then you'll
07:25 - see this paint bucket this allows us to
07:27 - quickly select a color so I'm gonna
07:28 - select green light blue dark blue and
07:31 - we'll have a pink and we'll finish off
07:33 - with a purple just like this so there we
07:35 - go we have just created our own rainbow
07:38 - jumps so we're gonna select all of these
07:40 - parts by dragging click holding down the
07:42 - left mouse button and dragging so
07:44 - they're selected and we're going to ctrl
07:47 - + G or command G alternatively right
07:50 - click and click on group this is gonna
07:52 - put them all in the model so that we can
07:54 - move them all around at once and that we
07:56 - can organize all of our parts in the
07:57 - game I'm gonna give this model a name of
07:59 - jumps there we go next what we're going
08:03 - to need to do is clone this spawn area
08:06 - and turn it into a checkpoint which we
08:08 - can put over here but first let's group
08:11 - together all of the parts which are in
08:12 - our spawn as well so we're gonna select
08:14 - them we're going to then group them and
08:17 - I'm going to call this checkpoint so now
08:20 - we've got two models one for our spawn
08:22 - area and one for our rainbow jumps I'm
08:24 - gonna go and clone this checkpoint I'm
08:27 - going to duplicate it so right-click
08:29 - duplicate and there we go we have now
08:31 - got another spawn point or a checkpoint
08:33 - now because we don't want our players to
08:35 - spawn at the second level we want them
08:37 - to spawn back at the start we're gonna
08:39 - remove this spawn point for now we only
08:41 - want the spawn points to be at the start
08:42 - in a future video we will add
08:44 - checkpoints so that you don't have to go
08:46 - back to the start every time that you
08:48 - die but now that we've got our second
08:50 - check
08:50 - in here what we can do is create our
08:52 - second obstacle let's create some lava
08:55 - jams so lava jumps are bricks which the
08:57 - player will have to jump over and if
08:59 - they touch the lava brick they will die
09:00 - and go back to the start so I'm gonna
09:02 - select the white color and I'm going to
09:04 - click on paths this is gonna insert
09:05 - another part for us and we can just drag
09:07 - it over here so it's touching the
09:09 - checkpoint now because they're gonna
09:11 - have to jump over the lava jumps we're
09:13 - gonna want to have a base so this is
09:14 - gonna be our base where we're gonna put
09:16 - the lava jumps on top of I'm using the
09:18 - scale tool to make it a little bit
09:20 - bigger and so there's enough room for us
09:21 - to put all of our jumps on so let's make
09:23 - sure it's anchored and it doesn't fall
09:25 - out of the sky and I'm going to change
09:26 - the name to base now we just need to
09:29 - insert another part and this will be our
09:32 - lava jump so make sure it's scale was
09:34 - the entirety of the base and that it's
09:36 - high enough so that people have a
09:38 - challenge when jumping over it I'm gonna
09:40 - make it a little bit shorter like that
09:42 - there we go
09:42 - and I'm gonna move it along here but
09:45 - because it's lava we want it to be shiny
09:47 - and red so let's change the brick color
09:49 - property to a nice red color I'm gonna
09:52 - change the material to neon this will
09:55 - make it stand out and it looks as if
09:57 - it's lit up so now that we've got our
10:00 - lava brick we to make it kill the player
10:02 - make sure it's anchored so it doesn't
10:04 - fall out the sky or it doesn't start
10:06 - moving around if someone touches it and
10:07 - let's name it the lava so how do we make
10:10 - it clear the player well we need to do
10:12 - scripting scripting allows you to bring
10:14 - your parts to life it allows things to
10:17 - happen when you don't have to control
10:20 - them it allows you to tell the game what
10:22 - to do and it will do it for you so make
10:25 - sure that you right-click cover over
10:27 - into object and click scripts once
10:29 - you've got your script in the game we
10:31 - can start by writing some simple code
10:33 - now we're gonna need to do a touched
10:35 - event which detects when someone touches
10:37 - the brick so we can say script up parent
10:40 - which is the part of the larva brick
10:42 - because the script parent is this lava
10:44 - here doctor that's the name of the event
10:47 - in which we're waiting to see waiting to
10:50 - see if something touches it curl on
10:52 - connect and then we say function and I'm
10:55 - gonna do a pair of parenthesis and drop
10:57 - a line like this and roblox should add
10:59 - this end with a closing bracket on it
11:01 - now inside of this bracket we're going
11:03 - to
11:04 - a parameter now a parameter is some data
11:07 - that gets passed to this scripts
11:09 - whenever something happens so for
11:11 - example when someone touches this brick
11:13 - with the script we'll know what hit what
11:15 - hit the part okay
11:17 - and so in this case we're calling it hit
11:18 - so we need to check to see if hit is
11:20 - natural player so say if hit dot parent
11:22 - come on find first child humanoid then
11:29 - we know that it is a player that touched
11:31 - it and it's not anything else like a
11:33 - brick might have touched it we don't
11:35 - want that to kill itself we only want to
11:37 - kill a player so we can say hits dot
11:41 - parents curl on break joints and what
11:44 - break joints does is it basically any
11:47 - joints in the player such as like back
11:49 - joints or neck joints will be broken and
11:52 - the player will fall apart so they
11:53 - basically die and they will have to be
11:55 - respawned so we're checking if something
11:57 - touches the brick and hit is whatever
11:59 - touched it and if that's hit is a player
12:03 - if it has a humanoid object in it which
12:05 - only players have then we're gonna break
12:06 - its joints and it's going to die so
12:09 - let's go and test this out let's go and
12:11 - con this arrow where it says play and
12:13 - click on play here so that we spawn on
12:15 - this checkpoint and if we touch the lava
12:18 - brick you can see our joints break and
12:21 - all of our body parts they fall apart so
12:24 - we die and we get respawn back to the
12:26 - start so now what we can do is keep
12:28 - pressing ctrl D to duplicate them and we
12:31 - can just add a couple onto this base
12:33 - like this
12:36 - next we're gonna take our checkpoint
12:38 - model again we're gonna duplicate it and
12:40 - we're gonna move it over here and now we
12:42 - can quote our next obstacle which is
12:44 - gonna be a choose path now you might not
12:46 - have heard of these before there are
12:47 - three paths and you have to choose the
12:49 - correct one two of them basically if you
12:51 - walk on them you're gonna fall straight
12:53 - through them and fall to your death but
12:55 - one of them is going to be at the
12:56 - correct path so you're gonna need to
12:57 - choose wisely so what we're gonna do is
13:00 - we're gonna take at this base again
13:01 - which we have and we're going to just
13:03 - duplicate it let's move it over here and
13:05 - just position it down so it's touching
13:08 - the checkpoint and now we're gonna just
13:10 - make it a little bit shorter because
13:11 - we're gonna have our choose path so
13:13 - we're gonna insert three more bricks
13:14 - three bricks for each path so this is
13:17 - gonna be our first path let's just make
13:19 - it wide enough like this we're gonna
13:21 - need to make it small enough so that the
13:24 - base can fit three parts we're gonna
13:26 - duplicate and we're gonna move it across
13:29 - and chip it again and move this one down
13:32 - like that so we now have three paths now
13:34 - we're gonna give each path a different
13:36 - color so this path could be yellow this
13:40 - path can be purple and this one can be
13:43 - blue so we now need to select which path
13:47 - is going to be the correct one so we're
13:50 - gonna have to have two of them which the
13:52 - player will fall straight through and
13:53 - one which will which will work so I'm
13:57 - gonna select these two paths on each
13:59 - side and these are going to be the paths
14:01 - that don't work so we're going to go to
14:03 - this kanka like property and we're going
14:05 - to make it unchecked when can collide is
14:07 - unchecked it means that nothing will
14:09 - collide with a brick it will just fall
14:10 - straight through it so the player is
14:12 - gonna fall straight through the purple
14:13 - one and the yellow one now we're gonna
14:15 - do we're gonna actually keep can collide
14:18 - set to true on the blue one but we're
14:20 - gonna select all of our paths and make
14:22 - sure that anchored is set to true so
14:23 - they don't fall out of the sky now let's
14:26 - clone our base again and we'll clone the
14:30 - checkpoint but whilst we're just here
14:34 - let's take our current obstacles that we
14:37 - have so we'll select the base and the
14:39 - three choose paths and we will group
14:41 - these together and we'll call this model
14:43 - choose path just that everything's
14:45 - organized and each path I will
14:48 - call that a path instead of parts like
14:51 - that and let's just go back to our lava
14:55 - jumps here and click and drag to select
14:57 - all of our lava bricks and the base okay
15:01 - so now we can just ctrl G to group them
15:03 - and I'm gonna call this lava and jumps
15:06 - okay so now we have grouped everything
15:08 - together it looks really nice and
15:10 - organized let's create our final
15:13 - obstacle this is going to be some bull
15:15 - jumps so a bit like the rainbow jumps
15:17 - but the player would have to jump on
15:19 - some balls so let's insert a part so
15:22 - we're gonna click on the arrow and click
15:24 - on sphere then we're gonna hold down
15:26 - shift again and click on the green
15:29 - circle on the scale tool and just scale
15:32 - them up and we will just position them
15:34 - in the middle here and what we can do is
15:36 - we can duplicate now instead of having
15:38 - the bricks duplicate on top of each
15:40 - other you can click on collisions over
15:42 - here and that will mean that they don't
15:43 - collide with each other so they're going
15:45 - to be duplicated in the same place so we
15:47 - can just drag them apart like this okay
15:50 - one two three four and we'll do one more
15:52 - and what I'll also do is just take a
15:55 - couple of them and move them from side
15:56 - to side so it's a little bit more
15:57 - challenging and then we can go back to
15:59 - the model model tab and use the color
16:01 - action as tool over here so we can do
16:04 - one as red one as green blue a pink one
16:07 - an orange one so there we go that's our
16:09 - final obstacle completes let's make sure
16:11 - that they're all anchored and we're
16:13 - gonna just group them together and we're
16:14 - gonna call them balls now I'm just gonna
16:17 - make sure each part is also called ball
16:18 - so we know what they all are and there
16:20 - we go we've finished our obstacle course
16:22 - now let's just add our final winner
16:24 - section we're gonna duplicate one of
16:26 - checkpoints and let's move it along
16:27 - again like this but because it's the
16:30 - winner zone we're gonna make it a little
16:31 - bit bigger so we're gonna use what we've
16:32 - learnt we're gonna hold down shift and
16:34 - then we're gonna use the scale tool on
16:36 - the yellow circle to make it a little
16:38 - bit bigger like this then I'm just gonna
16:40 - make sure that it's able to be jumped on
16:42 - from the final block and there we go we
