00:00 - hello everyone and welcome back to
00:01 - another video this is episode number 12
00:03 - in my scripting series I hope you guys
00:06 - had a great new year I'm gonna try and
00:08 - upload as many videos as I can this year
00:10 - so apologies for the recent delay in
00:12 - videos however it should be back on
00:14 - track now so in today's video we are
00:17 - looking at embedded if statements and
00:19 - also else if so I'm just gonna kick it
00:22 - off and tell you guys about embedded if
00:25 - statements so we have an if statement
00:27 - here and what this sir if statement does
00:29 - is it checks to see if a number is odd
00:32 - or even
00:33 - so what we're using is using the modulus
00:36 - function here and what modulus does is
00:39 - it divides these two numbers together
00:42 - and then it returns the remainder so the
00:46 - selected condition that I have there's
00:49 - in blue right now is what what is going
00:51 - to return is the remainder of this
00:53 - division so we've got my number set to 5
00:56 - so if you were to do 5 divided by 2
00:59 - obviously that's 2.5 so that would be 2
01:04 - remainder 1 because 2 times 2 is 4 and
01:06 - there's one left over
01:07 - so because 2.5 is a decimal then there
01:11 - would be a remainder of 1 here so it
01:15 - would be 2 remainder 1 so in this case 5
01:18 - would not be even it would be odd so
01:21 - modulus is a great way to just check if
01:24 - a number is even or odd or a multiple of
01:27 - another number because it will return a
01:29 - remainder and if the remainder is zero
01:31 - then you'll know that it's it's gone
01:34 - into the number cleanly and there's no
01:36 - remainder but if there is a remainder
01:38 - then it's not going to be equal to zero
01:40 - so you don't understand it too much
01:42 - don't worry yet but basically what those
01:44 - condition does is it decides whether the
01:46 - number is even or not because if the
01:48 - remainder 0 we know it's even and if
01:51 - it's not then we know it's odd so just
01:53 - to show you if I was to run this scripts
01:55 - check the output it says that it's odd
01:58 - if I was to put an even number in here
02:00 - such as 6 and I run the code again it
02:03 - would say that it's even so there we go
02:05 - we have a quick condition here just
02:07 - check to see if a number is even or odd
02:09 - so if an embedded if statement
02:12 - is an if statement inside of another if
02:13 - statement so if we were to put another
02:16 - if statement in here we can just do
02:19 - something else a if my number plus would
02:23 - okay if I have to say if my number plus
02:27 - one is even then prints we can just
02:37 - print my number plus one is even so
02:41 - what's happening here is if my number
02:45 - here so six is it is an even number then
02:51 - we print it is even and then we're
02:52 - running another if statement I'm adding
02:54 - one to my number so imagine it's now
02:56 - seven and we can check if that's even as
02:59 - well and if it is we can do another
03:00 - print so let's find out
03:02 - so it's just printed that it is even so
03:06 - obviously this condition must be false
03:08 - because my number add one which is 7
03:10 - obviously 7 is not an even number so
03:13 - let's do an else and let's say else
03:15 - prints my number at one it's odd and run
03:20 - again and it should say that my number
03:23 - add one is odd let's just replace that
03:25 - my number plus 1/2 my number plus one
03:31 - like this and we'll do a two string here
03:35 - as well
03:38 - okay don't worry about this 2 string by
03:41 - the way that's just making it so that we
03:43 - can print out the number because you
03:46 - have to make it a string as a string is
03:48 - what you print out and you can't go
03:50 - printing out numbers with strings so you
03:51 - have to convert it to a to a string so
03:55 - there we go it's printed that is even
03:57 - and then it's printed out the my number
04:01 - with one handed on which is 7 to say is
04:03 - odd so you can see we've got an if
04:05 - statement inside of this if statement
04:07 - but if we were to have an odd an odd
04:10 - number here and we do our first
04:12 - condition so our first condition checks
04:15 - to see if my number which is 5 is is
04:19 - divisible by 2 with no remainder so
04:21 - whether my number
04:23 - even or not so obviously five is an odd
04:27 - number so it's immediately gonna skip to
04:29 - our elfs statement and print out that
04:31 - it's odd
04:32 - so because it's gone to the elf's
04:35 - statement it's not been able to check
04:37 - our if statement here because it's
04:39 - nested it's embedded inside of our if
04:43 - statement here because anything that's
04:46 - in between this if and this else will
04:49 - only run if the condition here is true
04:51 - if it's not true then it's only going to
04:53 - print what's in the else statement down
04:56 - here so what we could do is we could
04:58 - move we could do another if statement
05:00 - down here and that would run if the else
05:03 - statement if the else runs and it will
05:06 - run regardless of whether it's true or
05:08 - not because we've got it up here and
05:10 - down here as well so I'm just showing
05:12 - you that you can have an if statement
05:14 - inside of another if statement that's
05:16 - fine as long as you you have your end to
05:19 - close it off as well so you can do as
05:21 - many if statements inside of each other
05:23 - as you like but each time you do an if
05:25 - statement then just make sure that
05:27 - you're indenting it each time so that
05:30 - your code is nice and clean and easy to
05:33 - read okay so that's all you need to know
05:36 - about embedded if statements now we're
05:39 - just gonna look at else if so else if
05:41 - it's similar to having an an embedded if
05:44 - statement although it just saves you
05:46 - having to keep indenting and writing out
05:48 - the ends as well those ends to close off
05:51 - those if statements so all you need to
05:53 - do instead of writing else you can just
05:55 - say else if like this and then you just
06:01 - write out your second condition so if my
06:03 - number let's just say let's just say if
06:09 - it's a multiple of three this time okay
06:11 - instead of it being a multiple of two
06:13 - let's check if it's a multiple of three
06:14 - so we can say instead of this being odd
06:17 - say it's a multiple of three so you can
06:21 - see if the first condition is not met if
06:25 - it's not true then it will get to our
06:27 - else or else--if and it will check our
06:30 - second condition to see if it's a
06:31 - multiple of three and if it isn't a
06:33 - multiple of three you can keep on doing
06:35 - this outfit
06:36 - if you can see we're not having to write
06:38 - that end at the end we can just say
06:42 - let's just do another one for multiple
06:43 - of five you can see we've got what two
06:48 - more if statements but we've only got
06:51 - one end and that's because it's a part
06:53 - of the same this big if statement is the
06:55 - same if statement it's just that we've
06:58 - got multiple conditions in case that the
07:00 - first one or the second one or the third
07:02 - one doesn't work and if they all are
07:04 - false if they all aren't true we can say
07:06 - just one normal house I'm can print
07:09 - they all did not run so we could put
07:17 - another number in here such as two as
07:19 - our as our number and it would print out
07:21 - it's even because it's met the first
07:23 - condition or we could set it to five and
07:27 - it would go to the third condition here
07:30 - would go to the third if here in this
07:32 - else if because it's not a more school
07:35 - of two it's not a multiple of three with
07:37 - some multiple of five so it's going to
07:39 - skip down to our third statement and
07:42 - it's going to print out it's a morsel of
07:44 - five but if it is not a morsel of any of
07:47 - those numbers it will just skip to our
07:49 - else and say that they all did not run
07:53 - so else if allows you to have multiple
07:55 - conditions in one if statement in case
07:57 - one of them doesn't work and you want to
07:59 - check something else but remember that
08:03 - you will only get to check these else
08:06 - ifs if the first condition isn't true so
08:11 - let's imagine that number is multiple of
08:15 - three so if it is a multiple of three
08:16 - that's great it's going to run this line
08:20 - here but then it's not going to run
08:22 - anymore else ifs or else's because the
08:24 - the if statement has now been met
08:27 - right the condition has been met so it's
08:29 - enough to do it anymore else's and it
08:31 - will just print they will just go onto
08:32 - the next line of code so let's example
08:34 - say finished down here it will say it's
08:38 - a multiple of three yep and then it will
08:41 - just skip all of these else ifs here and
08:44 - it will just go to the end of the script
08:47 - we'll say finished so if you do want to
08:50 - do your else ifs and you want certain
08:53 - ones to to certain ones to run in order
08:56 - make sure that you've got them ordered
08:58 - so you might want to check whether it's
08:59 - a multiple of five before it's a
09:01 - multiple of three for example but
09:02 - doesn't really matter these will only
09:04 - run if your conditions that you have
09:07 - previously written are false so there
09:11 - you are
09:11 - that's what else if is it allows you to
09:13 - have multiple you know conditions and
09:15 - checks in one if statement
09:17 - there we go although I guess you could
09:20 - say it's it's more than one if statement
09:21 - because you've got ifs here but what
09:23 - what I mean is they're only going to run
09:26 - if the first if doesn't doesn't work if
09:30 - it's false you see but there you go that
09:33 - is else if and also how you use embedded
09:35 - if statements I will be publishing more
