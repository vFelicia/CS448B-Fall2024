00:00 - in this video I'm going to show you how
00:03 - to create a Tycoon on Roblox so the
00:06 - first thing you want to do when you're
00:07 - in Roblox studio is click on this new
00:09 - button in the top left corner and then
00:12 - select base plate
00:14 - next you'll want to make sure that
00:16 - you've got the Explorer panel and the
00:19 - properties panel opened up if you
00:21 - haven't then all you need to do is click
00:23 - on The View tab here at the top and then
00:26 - make sure that the Explorer panel and
00:28 - properties button are both selected once
00:32 - you've done that you should see your
00:33 - Roblox Studio set up just like this some
00:36 - of your panels may be in different areas
00:38 - of the screen that's fine
00:40 - the first thing we're going to do is
00:42 - we're going to build our Tycoon and you
00:44 - can do this by using the part button
00:47 - which you can find underneath the Home
00:49 - tab right here so click to insert a few
00:52 - parts and then use the four tools select
00:54 - move scale and rotate to manipulate them
00:57 - however you'd like
01:00 - so here's my Tycoon I've just got a very
01:02 - basic part here and some surrounding
01:04 - walls I'm going to select them all and
01:07 - then in the properties panel I'm going
01:09 - to scroll down and make sure that the
01:11 - anchored property is checked this will
01:13 - make sure that the parts don't fall
01:16 - apart when the game begins
01:19 - next we're going to want to create a
01:21 - button for players to step on if they
01:24 - want to purchase items in the Tycoon so
01:26 - again let's head up here and click on
01:29 - the model tab or the Home tab and choose
01:31 - part here
01:33 - then I'm going to just go down here and
01:36 - zoom in a little bit and make it more
01:38 - like a square and I'm going to then head
01:41 - back up here under the model tab make
01:44 - sure that move is unchecked so that I
01:47 - can finally rescale this part to be much
01:50 - thinner like this and finally I'm going
01:53 - to head to the properties Tab and under
01:55 - brick color I'm going to choose a red
01:57 - color there we go we've got our button
02:01 - let's also add some text on top of this
02:04 - button to explain what the button will
02:06 - purchase so let's right click on our
02:09 - part select insert object and then we
02:12 - can search for a billboard GUI
02:17 - click on it to insert the billboard GUI
02:18 - and if you have a look in the Explorer
02:20 - panel you will see it's been inserted
02:22 - inside our part
02:24 - if we select the billboard GUI let's
02:26 - head down to the properties window and
02:28 - under the scale property let's set this
02:30 - to 4 comma 0 comma two comma zero this
02:35 - will just set the size of our billboard
02:37 - GUI and then we just want it to appear
02:40 - around two studs above the part so we
02:43 - can change the studs offset World space
02:46 - property to zero comma two comma zero
02:49 - which will put it two studs above the
02:52 - button if you press enter you can see
02:54 - we've got this blue outline and that's
02:56 - where our text is going to go
02:59 - you can also in the properties panel
03:01 - just set the always on top property to
03:03 - be checked this will make sure it
03:05 - doesn't get covered up by any other
03:07 - parts
03:08 - so let's head back here and in the
03:10 - Explorer panel we're going to click on
03:12 - this little plus next to our billboard
03:14 - GUI and let's insert a text label
03:18 - now if we just pop back out here you can
03:20 - see we've got some text appearing on our
03:22 - screen
03:23 - let's just go back to the text label and
03:25 - select it in the Explorer and then we'll
03:28 - head down to the properties window and
03:30 - we're going to set the size of this
03:32 - button to 1 comma 0 comma 1 comma zero
03:35 - this is going to make the text label
03:37 - fill the entire space in our billboard
03:40 - GUI just like that if we head back to
03:43 - the properties window and scroll down we
03:46 - can check the text scaled box what this
03:49 - is going to do is make the text fill the
03:51 - entire width and height of our billboard
03:53 - GUI and then we can just scroll up here
03:57 - set the background transparency of the
04:00 - button to one of the label sorry that's
04:03 - going to make the background disappear
04:05 - and we can scroll down again
04:08 - and we can set the font face of our text
04:10 - I'm going to choose verdoka1 and then
04:14 - going to set the text color 3 to be a
04:17 - solid white so I'm just going to drag
04:19 - this all the way up here
04:21 - click OK and you can set some text if
04:24 - you'd like I'm just going to leave it at
04:25 - label for now because we will change
04:27 - this using a script
04:29 - so we've got the text for our button and
04:32 - if you'd like you can customize it even
04:34 - more by inserting into the text label a
04:38 - UI stroke that's going to give it an
04:40 - outline which you can see here is a thin
04:44 - black outline but in the properties
04:45 - panel you can change the color if you'd
04:48 - like I could set it to a red and I could
04:50 - change the thickness
04:52 - Etc
04:52 - so that will do for now so we've got our
04:55 - button and we've got our Tycoon all
04:58 - that's left to do is now do some
05:00 - scripting to make our Tycoon work
05:03 - now just to avoid this clipping issue at
05:06 - the sides of our label we can head back
05:08 - to our text label up here and then in
05:11 - the properties panel we can just change
05:13 - the size to 0.9 comma 0 comma 0.9 comma
05:17 - zero that will just give us some padding
05:19 - at the sides and we can also just change
05:24 - the thickness of the stroke like that
05:27 - and whilst we're at it let's just do
05:29 - some quick organization to clean up our
05:32 - Explorer I'm going to start off by in
05:35 - the workspace clicking on this plus icon
05:37 - and inserting a folder I'm going to call
05:39 - this folder tycoons this is just going
05:42 - to be where all of the tycoons in the
05:44 - game are going to be stored because
05:45 - there's going to be multiple players in
05:47 - our game then I'm going to insert a
05:50 - model and this is going to contain each
05:53 - Tycoon so I'm going to rename this model
05:56 - Tycoon and inside every Tycoon we're
06:00 - going to have a few more folders so I'm
06:01 - going to insert a folder and I'm going
06:03 - to rename this to be called buttons
06:05 - that's where all the buttons will go and
06:08 - then go into right click select
06:10 - duplicate to create another folder I'm
06:12 - going to rename this one as decoration
06:16 - and then we're going to right click
06:17 - duplicate once more and rename this one
06:20 - to be called items so we will store the
06:23 - buttons in this one any decorative items
06:25 - such as the walls of our tycoon or the
06:28 - floor in the decorations folder and any
06:30 - items that will be purchased will go
06:32 - into the items folder now let's take all
06:35 - of our parts here except for the button
06:37 - so we'll just select these four here for
06:40 - our walls and our flooring we'll put
06:43 - them into the decoration folder we'll
06:45 - take our part over here which is our
06:47 - Button as you can see I'm just going to
06:50 - rename this down in the properties
06:51 - window or you can right click and select
06:54 - rename it's going to call it button
06:57 - and I'm going to put this inside our
06:59 - buttons folder there we go that's way
07:02 - more neat and organized
07:04 - now I'm going to show you how to add
07:06 - some items that you can purchase in your
07:08 - Tycoon now I'm going to insert a
07:11 - conveyor that's a typical item that you
07:13 - use in a tycoon but it's up to you which
07:16 - items you add you don't have to add a
07:17 - conveyor I'm just trying to show you how
07:20 - the process works so I'm going to go to
07:22 - the toolbox which is a collection of
07:24 - models that we can use so go to the Home
07:27 - tab and select toolbox and then you can
07:30 - search for a model under the model
07:31 - section and I've just searched for a
07:33 - conveyor this one looks quite good so
07:36 - I'm just going to take it and drag it
07:38 - into the world now be careful because
07:41 - some conveyors can have scripts inside
07:43 - of them which is okay just click on the
07:45 - OK button here but just make sure you
07:47 - check them because some can have some
07:49 - dangerous scripts which are in there to
07:52 - cause trouble this one however looks
07:54 - good Okay so we've got our conveyor and
07:57 - I'm just going to select the model of
07:59 - this conveyor over here
08:01 - and you're going to right click and
08:03 - rename it as conveyor
08:05 - now what we need to do is we need to set
08:08 - some attributes and attribute is a
08:10 - little bit like a property it's just a
08:11 - way to store some information about a
08:14 - specific item and in a tycoon we're
08:16 - going to need to save the contents of
08:19 - our Tycoon at some point so rather than
08:21 - doing this by saying there's a conveyor
08:24 - here and there's a conveyor there we can
08:26 - just give every single item an ID and
08:29 - then we can store information about what
08:31 - items a players unlocked in their Tycoon
08:34 - by just listing off the IDS for every
08:36 - single item because if every item has an
08:38 - ID it will just make it really simple to
08:41 - track so let's give our conveyor some
08:44 - attributes for the ID as well as that
08:46 - we're going to want to have a cost
08:47 - attribute a price attribute so that the
08:50 - game knows how much each item is going
08:52 - to cost so down in the properties tab
08:55 - when you have your conveyor selected as
08:57 - you can see in the corner here there it
08:59 - is we're going to go to the attribute
09:01 - section I'm going to click on ADD
09:02 - attribute
09:04 - now a pop-up will appear down here and
09:07 - we're going to set it to be a number and
09:09 - we'll just call it cost to begin with
09:11 - okay and we'll do the same thing again
09:13 - add attribute the pop-up will appear
09:16 - we'll set the type to be a number and
09:18 - this one will be called ID
09:21 - so we've now got our attributes these
09:23 - are just custom properties so let's set
09:26 - the cost of this of this conveyor to be
09:28 - 50 for example you can change this to
09:30 - whatever you'd like and the ID will just
09:33 - set that to be number one so the next
09:35 - item we add to the game we'll just set
09:37 - the ID to be two we don't want any items
09:39 - to have the same ID every single ID
09:42 - attribute will need to be unique for
09:44 - every single item this is how we'll be
09:46 - able to uniquely identify and
09:48 - distinguish between them
09:50 - so now we've done that what we're going
09:52 - to do is we're going to take this
09:54 - conveyor and we're just going to store
09:56 - it temporarily in the replicated storage
09:59 - but before we do that let's just
10:01 - position it where we'd like it to go in
10:03 - our Tycoon so I'm just going to drag it
10:05 - and I'm going to put it about here now I
10:08 - can see that the conveyor is a little
10:10 - bit too big and that's fine I'm just
10:12 - going to move my walls over slightly and
10:16 - just resize everything
10:18 - and once I've done that and it's all in
10:21 - the correct position where I'd like it
10:22 - to go I'm just going to move the button
10:25 - over here as well
10:27 - there it is and finally I'm going to
10:30 - right click on my conveyor choose copy
10:34 - and then in the Explorer window we're
10:36 - just going to create a folder in the
10:38 - replicated storage
10:40 - and we're going to name this folder
10:42 - items
10:44 - and then I'm just going to right click
10:46 - and select paste into
10:48 - that's going to create a clone of our
10:50 - conveyor and store it in the replicated
10:53 - storage
10:54 - so what we're doing here is we're having
10:55 - a conveyor stored in our Tycoon so we
10:58 - can actually take this conveyor that's
10:59 - in the workspace and now drag it into
11:02 - our items folder this is just going to
11:04 - be our way of telling the game where we
11:06 - want the conveyor to be positioned and
11:08 - then what we're going to do is when we
11:10 - start the game we're going to strip out
11:12 - all of these items from the Tycoon and
11:16 - when the player buys the item we will
11:19 - then bring it back by creating a clone
11:21 - of it from the replicated storage so
11:24 - this uh conveyor that's in the workspace
11:26 - is just here so that we can position all
11:29 - of our items where we want them to be
11:31 - and then when the game starts up we'll
11:33 - delete these items until the player
11:35 - unlocks them
11:37 - that may be a little bit confusing but
11:39 - don't worry it will all make sense when
11:41 - we see it happening with code later on
11:44 - so everything is now all set up and all
11:47 - that we can now do is write some code so
11:50 - what we'll do is back in the Explorer
11:53 - here let's click on the plus next to the
11:56 - server script service this is where all
11:58 - of our code is going to be stored so
12:00 - click on that plus and just search for a
12:02 - script and make sure whoops I've
12:04 - inserted the wrong script make sure that
12:06 - you insert a normal script okay a gray
12:09 - script
12:11 - now inside of this script we're going to
12:14 - write quite a few lines of code I'm just
12:17 - going to hide this one here so in this
12:18 - script this is the script editor it's
12:20 - where we write all of our code we're
12:21 - going to write some code which will
12:23 - detect when a new player joins the game
12:25 - we'll assign a tycoon to them we will
12:28 - set up all of the buttons and handle the
12:31 - logic for when they step on a button we
12:33 - will handle the currencies so the player
12:37 - will be able to deduct cash when they
12:39 - step on a button and will also handle
12:41 - the positioning of items in the Tycoon
12:44 - as well when you step on a button
12:47 - so to start with let's write some code
12:49 - that will set up a leader stats and some
12:53 - cash for a player when they first join
12:57 - so here we're saying game.players dot
12:59 - player added colon connect function
13:01 - player and this is going to trigger
13:04 - every single time a new player joins and
13:07 - when they do join we want to set up some
13:09 - leader stats so they appear on the
13:11 - leaderboard so we can say
13:14 - local leader stats
13:16 - equals instance dot new we're going to
13:19 - create a folder
13:21 - and within this folder well firstly
13:24 - let's just give this folder a name and
13:27 - we can call it leader stats and we can
13:30 - parent that to go inside the player's
13:33 - object so we've now got a leader stats
13:36 - folder and any uh values that goes
13:39 - inside this folder will appear on the
13:41 - in-game leaderboard so we want the
13:43 - player to have some cash so we can say
13:45 - local cache equals instance dot new into
13:48 - value
13:49 - and cache dot name equals cache
13:54 - and I'm just going to change this to
13:58 - speech marks just to be consistent
14:01 - rather than
14:02 - quotation marks there we go cash dot
14:05 - parent equals leader stats and I'm going
14:09 - to set the player's cache to be 500 when
14:11 - they first join the game we'll handle
14:13 - data saving probably in another video
14:15 - for now this is good to go so if you
14:18 - click on the play button in the script
14:20 - editor up here
14:22 - you should see that when the player
14:23 - joins the game they have some leader
14:26 - stats
14:28 - all right
14:30 - there they are you can see we're now
14:31 - appearing on the leaderboard with our
14:33 - leader stats and if we were to head into
14:35 - the players you can see we've got this
14:37 - folder with our leader stats so that's
14:39 - what we've just set up using Code when a
14:41 - new player joins this folder gets added
14:44 - to their player
14:47 - next we want to be able to assign a
14:49 - tycoon to a specific player we've only
14:52 - got one Tycoon at the moment but you
14:54 - know what we could do is we could just
14:55 - take our Tycoon up here in the Explorer
14:58 - right click it duplicate it and move it
15:02 - across over here so we've now got two
15:04 - tycoons okay we could do that and have a
15:07 - third Tycoon doesn't matter we can have
15:09 - loads of tycoons but out of all of these
15:11 - tycoons which one are we going to assign
15:13 - to a player well that's what we're going
15:15 - to work on now but before that we just
15:17 - need to set up a few more attributes
15:19 - because we need to store information
15:20 - about who owns a specific Tycoon
15:24 - so if we head back to the Explorer panel
15:27 - and just select all of our four tycoons
15:29 - at the moment and then head down to the
15:31 - properties panel let's select add
15:33 - attribute and we want a Boolean value
15:37 - which is a true or false value I'm going
15:39 - to call that taken so that will let us
15:42 - know whether the plot is being used by
15:45 - someone or whether it's vacant and we
15:47 - can use it
15:48 - so we'll then add another attribute and
15:50 - this one is going to be the user ID of
15:53 - the person who owns this Tycoon
15:57 - so this is going to be a number and
16:00 - we'll just call it user ID with a
16:02 - capital u for user and a capital I for
16:05 - ID
16:06 - so now all of our tycoons will have
16:08 - these attributes and we can now check
16:10 - those attributes using code and also set
16:13 - them when a new player joins the game
16:16 - so back in our script let's create a
16:18 - function which will assign a tycoon to a
16:21 - player so we're just going to create a
16:23 - local function call it assigned Tycoon
16:26 - and we're going to take a parameter on
16:28 - argument sorry of the player who has
16:32 - called this function so we'll call this
16:34 - function from the player added event
16:36 - down here and what we want to do is we
16:38 - just want to Loop through all the
16:39 - tycoons in the game that are in the
16:41 - tycoons folder so we can say four
16:45 - underscore comma tycoon in game dot
16:50 - workspace
16:51 - in fact let's create a variable for our
16:53 - tycoons folder
16:55 - so we can say local tycoons equals game
16:58 - dot workspace wait for child
17:01 - tycoons
17:04 - okay
17:05 - and so for underscore comma tycoon in
17:08 - tycoons colon get children so this is
17:12 - going to return a table of all of the
17:14 - tycoons within this folder and then
17:17 - we're going to Loop through each
17:18 - individual Tycoon and just check to see
17:21 - if that taken value is false and if it
17:25 - is false then we know that this is a
17:27 - tycoon that is not currently being used
17:29 - so we can say if Tycoon colon gets
17:32 - attribute taken
17:35 - then continue end because this will just
17:39 - check to see if it is true so if this is
17:41 - true then this if statement is going to
17:43 - resolve and by saying continue we can
17:46 - just skip to the next Tycoon because we
17:49 - know that this one will be taken so this
17:51 - is just a check to make sure whether the
17:53 - Tycoon is free or not
17:55 - so then if the code doesn't continue and
17:58 - it just carries on to the next line
17:59 - we'll know that this Tycoon is free so
18:02 - we can say Tycoon colon set attribute
18:04 - taken we'll set that to true and also
18:08 - Tycoon set attributes
18:11 - user ID
18:13 - we're just going to set that to player
18:16 - dot user ID
18:18 - so we now
18:19 - what we'll also do is because we found
18:21 - our Tycoon we can just say return Tycoon
18:24 - which will break out of our for Loop and
18:27 - stop this function because we no longer
18:29 - need to keep it running
18:31 - and we can also return nil just in case
18:35 - no tycoons get found it will just break
18:38 - out of this for Loop and return nil so
18:41 - that we won't continue any further
18:43 - because there's obviously some sort of
18:44 - error that's occurred for there not to
18:47 - be enough tycoons available
18:49 - so now back down here with our player
18:52 - added function we can create a variable
18:56 - for the Tycoon which we're going to give
18:58 - to our player so we can say local Tycoon
19:02 - equals sign Tycoon and we can pass the
19:07 - player through there
19:08 - as our parameter
19:10 - and what this will do is because we're
19:12 - returning the Tycoon once we have found
19:15 - a plot for them the Tycoon variable will
19:18 - become the Tycoon object which will be
19:20 - in the Explorer so one of these tycoons
19:22 - will get returned to this variable and
19:25 - we'll be able to reference that Tycoon
19:27 - model as a variable
19:30 - and in case there's an error and for
19:32 - some reason we can't give them a tycoon
19:34 - because it's none available and we
19:35 - return nil we'll just do a quick check
19:37 - to say if not Tycoon then warn
19:44 - could not assign Tycoon to dot dot
19:49 - player dot name
19:51 - and we can just say return end
19:55 - so that will print out into the output
19:57 - an error message in case the Tycoon
19:59 - isn't available
20:01 - but what we've just done is we've
20:03 - created a script to find an available
20:06 - Tycoon and assign it to our player so if
20:09 - we now click on the play button up here
20:11 - in the script menu
20:14 - we should join the game
20:16 - and we should have been assigned a
20:18 - tycoon if we just go to the Explorer
20:21 - and we have a look in here in our
20:24 - tycoons folder we'll just pick a random
20:27 - one
20:28 - probably the first one and you can see
20:30 - the attribute of Taken has been checked
20:32 - and the user ID is indeed my user id
20:35 - here and just to prove if I select
20:37 - another Tycoon the second one for
20:40 - example you can see it is not taken and
20:43 - there's no user ID so it's picked one
20:45 - Tycoon to be mine and it set the
20:48 - attributes to my user ID and it's set
20:52 - its taken value to be true
20:55 - now what we've got to do next is set up
20:58 - our buttons so that when we step on them
21:00 - it unlocks the items we'll also need to
21:03 - set up the Billboards for the buttons
21:05 - we'll also have to clean up the Tycoon
21:09 - when the player leaves but aside from
21:12 - that that's all we're going to have to
21:13 - do in order to create a functioning
21:15 - Tycoon and that will be in the next
21:18 - video which will be linked in the card
21:20 - or in the description so I'll see you
21:22 - there don't forget to subscribe and like
21:24 - the video if you found this useful and
21:27 - I'll see you next time
