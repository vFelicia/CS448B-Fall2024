00:00 - today I'm gonna be showing you how to
00:02 - make a car spawner on roblox so you can
00:05 - pay money to buy a car and then you can
00:08 - spawn it let's get started is we're
00:17 - gonna insert a leaderboard script which
00:19 - will control the amount of cash that
00:21 - each player has in the game so we're
00:24 - gonna click on this little plus icon
00:26 - next to service crypt service and then
00:29 - we're going to click on script and once
00:31 - you've done that we're going to do a
00:33 - player added event so you need to type
00:36 - game dot players dot player added :
00:40 - connect function
00:42 - PLR just as it is shown on screen now
00:45 - what will happen is when a player joins
00:48 - the game there will be any code inside
00:52 - of this this little event here will run
00:56 - and you can see it says PLR this is the
00:59 - player that's going to join the game so
01:02 - what we're gonna do is we're going to
01:03 - insert something called leader stats and
01:05 - inside of there we're going to put all
01:08 - of their cash and maybe other values in
01:10 - there later so what we're gonna do is
01:13 - we're gonna say local leader stats
01:18 - equals instance new bracket close
01:23 - bracket and then in these speech marks
01:26 - we're gonna say int value or actually
01:30 - wouldn't say folder it doesn't matter it
01:32 - could be a model it could be a folder
01:34 - but we need to call these leader stats
01:37 - leader saps
01:38 - all in lowercase so we're gonna say
01:40 - leader stats don't name equals and in
01:43 - speech marks a leader stats just like
01:47 - this and it has to be lowercase and it
01:49 - has to be spelled correctly else the
01:51 - cash won't show up on your screen we
01:54 - then need to put these leader stats in
01:57 - the player so in the same leader stats
01:59 - got parents equals PLR you always have
02:03 - to put the parent you have to specify
02:06 - the parent of the object at the end and
02:09 - once you've got all the properties done
02:11 - so now that we've got our leader starts
02:13 - we need to insert a cash object so we're
02:16 - gonna do the same thing again we're just
02:18 - gonna drop a line I'm gonna say local
02:20 - cash equals instance don't you open
02:24 - bracket close bracket and then in these
02:26 - speech marks we're going to say that
02:28 - cash if you want yours to be called
02:30 - money or something else get change cash
02:33 - to money okay
02:35 - so what we've done or what we need to
02:37 - actually call this an int value and then
02:41 - down here you can say cash drop name
02:43 - equals and then speech marks you can
02:46 - call it cash so you have to say that
02:49 - it's an int value because it's going to
02:51 - carry a number and then we give it a
02:53 - name and let's give the player a number
02:57 - of cash suing say cash drop value equals
03:00 - and then we'll give them 500 cash to
03:02 - start off with now I have a data saving
03:05 - tutorials if you want to save your data
03:07 - in game you can watch that it will be in
03:09 - the card in the top right corner of the
03:11 - screen
03:11 - but now we should have our cash our
03:14 - leaderboard so let's just go and play
03:16 - the game and hopefully we should have
03:18 - our leaderboard in the top right corner
03:19 - and I just realized we need to put the
03:23 - cash inside after me to stop so you can
03:25 - say cash drop parents equals leader
03:29 - stats and then if we go and play the
03:31 - game the leaderboard should be in the
03:34 - top right corner there we go so now
03:36 - we've got our currency system done we
03:39 - can start making the purchase GUI so
03:43 - what we're going to do is we're going to
03:45 - first create a folder in replicated
03:48 - storage called folder okay and we're
03:52 - gonna call this cars and once you've
03:57 - done that we actually we're going to
03:59 - drag this into server storage we're
04:01 - going to get our cars so if you've got
04:03 - some cars already make them a model make
04:06 - sure they're a model and just drag them
04:08 - inside this server storage I'm gonna get
04:11 - some cars from free models we're gonna
04:13 - take an army car a transporter and a
04:15 - basic car as well as an off-roader and
04:18 - you can see they've all got names you
04:20 - need to make sure they've got a name and
04:22 - then you're just going to drag them all
04:24 - into server storage like that
04:27 - now let's get started by designing our
04:30 - GUI so I'm going to click on start to do
04:32 - I'm gonna click on the plus then I'm
04:34 - gonna click on screen GUI and I'm gonna
04:37 - call this purchase GUI once you've done
04:42 - this we're gonna insert a frame so we're
04:44 - going to click the plus and click frame
04:46 - and then what we can do is we can change
04:50 - the size of it if you want I'm going to
04:52 - change mine to 500 by 400 and then I'm
04:57 - going to put it in the middle of the
04:58 - screen by changing the position to not
05:00 - 0.5 negative 250 as the offset and 0.5
05:05 - is the scale for the vertical and we're
05:09 - going to do offset or minus 200 as
05:11 - that's half of the scale and now the GUI
05:16 - is in the middle of our screen so what
05:19 - we want to do now is why sure you can
05:20 - make the G or you can make the GUI look
05:23 - a bit better if you want I'm going to
05:24 - change the style to drop shadow because
05:27 - it looks it looks more professional and
05:29 - much nicer and then what we're gonna do
05:32 - is we're gonna insert an image button
05:34 - into our GUI in fact we're going to do
05:39 - an image label instead and then we will
05:41 - do a button underneath it so what we're
05:44 - gonna do is we're going to call this
05:46 - image label car for now and then what
05:51 - we're going to do is we're going to just
05:53 - move it so that it's just away from the
05:57 - edges of our GUI so we can say in 0.1
05:59 - and with the same note point 1 for the
06:03 - horizontal and vertical positions and
06:06 - this will just put it a little bit out
06:09 - from the border so once you've done that
06:13 - we're going to insert a text button
06:16 - inside of there and we're going to set
06:18 - the scale of this we're going to set the
06:20 - size to 1 0 0 25 and then we can click a
06:27 - button we can click on the text property
06:30 - of this button and we can change it to
06:32 - say purchase and then we're going to
06:36 - click text scaled and we're going to
06:39 - change the font to bold
06:41 - now you can also change the style of
06:43 - this if you want I'm gonna have a look
06:45 - at what there is and I'm gonna change my
06:48 - actually I'm not going to change it I'm
06:50 - just gonna keep it to custom I'm going
06:52 - to make the background color a little
06:55 - bit green though so we can see that it
06:57 - is a purchase button and then what I'm
06:59 - going to do I'm going to set the
07:00 - position to a 120 we're just going to
07:05 - set it to 1 actually so it's underneath
07:07 - the image label so we've got our picture
07:11 - of our car we will put the image of it
07:13 - in the image label soon and we've also
07:16 - got our text button so you may have
07:20 - multiple cars in your game so if you
07:21 - have more than one car just copy this
07:24 - image label and paste it and then you
07:27 - can move you can change the position to
07:30 - let's see not point 4 so I just added
07:32 - point 3 on to the position and you can
07:36 - see it's moved across I'm gonna add
07:38 - another one I'm going to change it to
07:39 - not point 7 and then you can if you want
07:42 - even more what you can do is you can
07:44 - just copy another one so I'm going to
07:47 - copy the first one and I'm just gonna
07:48 - change the vertical position to not not
07:52 - wait for let's change it to not 0.5 so
07:55 - that it's just underneath the first
07:57 - button so I've got 4 cars so I'm gonna
08:00 - have 4 different buttons so what we're
08:03 - gonna do now is we're gonna get the
08:04 - pictures for our image labels so we're
08:07 - just going to click visible we're gonna
08:10 - uncheck it so that we can take some
08:12 - pictures now what I'm gonna do is I'm
08:15 - gonna go into the tool box and because
08:18 - I've already got pictures of my cars
08:19 - here I can just screenshot them and then
08:22 - I can just upload them to roblox but if
08:25 - you've got your own custom cars you can
08:27 - just drag your cars out of this folder
08:30 - into the workspace and then you can just
08:33 - take some pictures of them so I will
08:35 - just take a screenshot of this and then
08:40 - I'm going to copy up and I can upload it
08:43 - to roblox ok so I've got all of my
08:46 - images uploaded to roblox I uploaded
08:49 - them by going to the create tab and then
08:51 - I click on decals and then I can just
08:54 - select all of my images and
08:55 - upload them so I'm gonna get the ID from
08:58 - each decal on the website so you just go
09:01 - to your decal and in the website link
09:04 - there is a number that is the ID of the
09:06 - decal and you just want to paste them
09:09 - into this property down here we're gonna
09:11 - make the frame visible and then we're
09:13 - gonna select each car
09:15 - and we're going to paste in our IDs so
09:18 - here's my first one and there we go we
09:21 - have our we have our car and we're now
09:25 - gonna get the off-roader
09:26 - and we're gonna put it in here on the
09:29 - next one so you just need to put all of
09:31 - your images in here so now we're gonna
09:34 - get the normal red car and that's going
09:38 - in and we'll finally we're gonna have
09:40 - the army truck and I'm gonna put the ID
09:42 - in here so there we go we've got all of
09:46 - our four cars now in our GUI now what we
09:49 - need to do is we need to click on each
09:52 - image label and we need to name this
09:54 - image label the same name as the as the
09:58 - cars name so this is the let's have that
10:02 - I think it's the van yep so this blue
10:05 - car is called van so I'm gonna select
10:07 - this image label I'm gonna go to the
10:09 - name property and I'm going to change it
10:11 - to van I'm gonna click on enter then
10:14 - when you go to the next one which is the
10:16 - off-roader I'm going to name it exactly
10:19 - the same so off - loader
10:22 - because that's how it's spelt up here it
10:25 - has to be the same name as the model
10:27 - then we go to the next one which is the
10:29 - red car and then what we're going to do
10:32 - is we're gonna change the name of this
10:34 - image label to car but it's already set
10:36 - to car because we that's what we called
10:38 - it earlier and we can go to the last one
10:40 - which is called the army truck so we're
10:44 - just gonna click on enter and we've got
10:46 - all of our image labels named so what we
10:51 - need to do now is begin scripting our
10:54 - cars so what we need to do we need to
10:57 - work out how much each car should cost
11:00 - so maybe one should be more expensive
11:02 - than the other so what we're going to do
11:04 - is we're going to go into each model of
11:06 - our car here and we're going to insert a
11:08 - value
11:09 - called price now what we do we're gonna
11:11 - search for an int value and we're gonna
11:15 - click on it and where is it there we go
11:18 - is called value and we're just gonna
11:20 - change this to price now you can put
11:23 - your own price number in here I'm gonna
11:25 - set this one to 500 and then I'm just
11:28 - going to copy this value
11:30 - I'm gonna close down the army truck I'm
11:32 - gonna paste it into the car and I'm
11:35 - going to change the price of the car to
11:36 - 200 and then we can just close that down
11:39 - paste it into the off-roader and change
11:42 - the price of that I'm gonna set this one
11:44 - to 1000 and then what we're going to do
11:47 - is we're just going to do the same thing
11:50 - in the van I'm going to change the van
11:53 - to 750 so they've all got different
11:56 - prices and their price in value has been
11:59 - added into the into the into the cars
12:04 - what we need to do now is we need to put
12:07 - a text label into each image label which
12:12 - shows the price of the cars okay so
12:15 - we're going to just change this to 50
12:19 - and we can set this one to 20 I'm going
12:23 - to change the background transparency to
12:25 - 9.5 and I'm going to click on text
12:29 - scaled now we can put price as the text
12:32 - and then we can insert a local local
12:39 - scripts into here and later on we'll be
12:41 - able to display the price of the cars as
12:44 - we will script that later on so we're
12:47 - just gonna leave this text label in here
12:49 - for now we can call it price label and
12:52 - we will deal with that later on so now
12:55 - it's time to start scripting the buying
12:58 - off of the car now because this is going
13:01 - to be filtering enabled compatible we
13:03 - can't put the prices of the cars on in
13:07 - the GUI because if a hacker joined the
13:09 - game they could change the prices to
13:11 - whatever they want so we have to keep
13:13 - the prices on the server and the prices
13:17 - are inside the trucks which are hosted
13:18 - on the roblox service so hackers can't
13:21 - change the prices but
13:22 - this means that we have to use something
13:24 - called a remote remote function to get
13:28 - the price from the server and send it
13:30 - back to us just to tell us how much it
13:32 - costs so I did a video on remote
13:34 - functions if you want to learn more
13:36 - about them I'll put a card in the top
13:37 - right of the screen but what we're going
13:40 - to do is we're going to insert a remote
13:43 - function into replicated storage I'm
13:46 - gonna call it check price okay and then
13:53 - what we can do is we can go into our
13:54 - text button we're gonna change the name
13:56 - of it to by button and we're going to
14:00 - insert a local script into it so what
14:04 - we're going to do is we're going to have
14:05 - another event here and this event is
14:08 - called the mouse button worn-down mouse
14:11 - button one click event sorry so what
14:15 - will happen is when a player clicks on
14:19 - the GUI on Gy button the event will run
14:22 - and we can make them purchase the car so
14:26 - we can say script or parents because
14:28 - that's the button and then we say dot
14:30 - mouse button
14:31 - one click : the connects Open bracket
14:35 - function open bracket close bracket and
14:38 - then we can just drop a line so anything
14:41 - inside of this event will run when the
14:44 - player clicks on the button so what we
14:47 - want to do is we want to check if the
14:49 - player has enough money to buy this
14:51 - vehicle so we're going to want to send a
14:55 - request to this remote function which is
14:59 - going to check the price of the car and
15:01 - it's going to send it back to us
15:03 - so we can check to see if they have
15:04 - enough money so what we can do is we can
15:07 - say check a price actually once a price
15:11 - of item equals game lot replicated
15:15 - storage and then we can say : wait for
15:18 - child we just say check price inside
15:21 - please
15:22 - speech marks and then we can say :
15:26 - invoke server
15:31 - okay and we're going to put in speech
15:33 - marks the name of the car and so the
15:36 - name of the car is equal to the name of
15:39 - the image label so we can just say
15:42 - script doc karent's dot parents name
15:47 - because script parent dot parent is this
15:50 - image label and it's called van so we
15:53 - are sending the name of the car that we
15:55 - want to check the price off and what
15:57 - this is going to do is it's going to
15:58 - return back that price ask this variable
16:01 - so this variable will be a number I'm
16:04 - just gonna make this local as well what
16:06 - we need to do now though is we need to
16:08 - actually script this remote function
16:10 - then when it gets the request it knows
16:12 - that it's going to check the price of
16:14 - the car and it's going to send it back
16:15 - to us so to do this we're just going to
16:18 - say game don't write the paper storage :
16:21 - wait for child and then in speech marks
16:24 - we can say check price and then what
16:29 - we're going to say is dot on server
16:32 - invoke so when the server has been
16:34 - invoked by the client wanting to know
16:36 - how much your car is we're then going to
16:38 - say equals function and then I'm gonna
16:42 - have a set of brackets and then we can
16:44 - say inside of here player comma and then
16:48 - we can say name of car okay
16:50 - so the player has to be automatically
16:53 - defined and the client will send over
16:56 - the name of the player who called this
16:58 - this remote function and we've also got
17:02 - our parameter which is the name of the
17:04 - car and remember how in the local script
17:07 - we're sending script or parent a parent
17:09 - name well that is going to be the name
17:13 - of the car so what we can do is we can
17:16 - drop a line here and you see ID is in an
17:18 - end now all we need to do to send back
17:21 - how much this car costs to the script
17:24 - we just need to say return game dot
17:27 - serve storage dot cars curl on find
17:31 - first child and then because we all the
17:35 - cars are going to be inside this folder
17:37 - they're currently in the workspace but
17:39 - we can move them into this folder now
17:41 - because we don't need them
17:43 - and what we're gonna do we're just going
17:45 - to put speech marks actually we're not
17:48 - going for speech marks we're just gonna
17:50 - write a name of car okay
17:53 - and then we can just say dot price drop
17:55 - value because we've got that value
17:57 - called price which we added in earlier
17:59 - on into the cars we're just finding that
18:02 - value and we're gonna send over back to
18:04 - the local script the value of that price
18:08 - object so if it was 500 it would be
18:11 - returning 500 so let's go and test this
18:14 - out in the command bar so we click play
18:17 - and let's just print down here in the
18:20 - command bar we're gonna say game dot
18:22 - replicated storage check price invoke
18:25 - server car with a name car that's there
18:28 - we want to check the price of the car
18:30 - which is called car which is the red car
18:32 - I'm gonna print that okay so let's go
18:35 - and invoke that and you see it has
18:37 - returned back 200 because the red car in
18:41 - service storage the red car had a price
18:45 - value of 200 let's try this with the
18:48 - off-roader
18:50 - you can see it's sent back 1000 because
18:54 - the off-roaders price value is 1000 just
18:58 - like that
18:59 - so our remote function is ready to go
19:01 - and we can now return back the price of
19:05 - the item okay so the price of the item
19:08 - will be the value which will be returned
19:11 - so just imagine that that's 500 or 1000
19:14 - or have a match however much the car
19:16 - costs so we need to check if the user
19:18 - can afford this car so we're gonna say
19:21 - if game dot players not local player
19:25 - don't lead us that's got cash dot value
19:29 - is greater than or equal to the price of
19:32 - the item so if they have just enough or
19:34 - more then the we can put a comment
19:39 - saying that the player has enough cap so
19:45 - we're going to deduct the cash from
19:47 - their account because they've just
19:48 - purchased it so we can say game dot
19:51 - players locally player but leader stuff
19:55 - got cash got value equals Runa just copy
20:00 - and paste the same thing cuz we want to
20:02 - get their current value and we want to
20:04 - take away the price of the item okay
20:07 - so now their account has been deducted
20:09 - by the amount of how much this car costs
20:12 - and now they have officially purchased
20:16 - this car and now they're able to just
20:20 - spawn it in okay so what's going to
20:23 - happen is when the player first
20:25 - purchases it there's going to be a value
20:28 - inside of the image label and we're
20:31 - gonna click on the plus here and we're
20:32 - gonna click on food value okay and we're
20:37 - going to then change the name to
20:39 - purchased so have they already purchased
20:43 - it or not if they haven't already
20:44 - purchased it then the if they already if
20:48 - they buy it then it's not going to spawn
20:50 - but if they click it again
20:51 - after they've already bought it then the
20:53 - car will spawn so what we're going to do
20:57 - is we're going to head into the script
21:00 - here and if they've bought it we're
21:02 - going to say script dot parent dot
21:06 - parent purchase dot value equals true so
21:12 - we know that they've now purchased it
21:13 - and we also in this if statement we want
21:16 - to say if they have enough money and
21:19 - script dot parent script dot parent dot
21:26 - parent purchase value equals equals
21:30 - false since they haven't already bought
21:32 - it then we'll let them buy it and we
21:34 - also then want to say at the top of this
21:38 - script if script dot parents dots of
21:44 - parents purchased value equals equals
21:48 - true then okay and you can see we've got
21:52 - this end added in here we're going to
21:54 - copy that and we're going to paste it
21:56 - right at the bottom of the scripts like
21:59 - this and then we're just going to
22:01 - highlight everything inside these if
22:03 - statement and click on tab just to
22:06 - indent it and make it look
22:08 - nice and neat okay so what we want to do
22:12 - here is if they've already purchased it
22:13 - we want them to be able to spawn it so
22:17 - we're gonna add an else here because
22:19 - inside this else then we're going to let
22:22 - them purchase it because they haven't
22:24 - already purchased it because it will be
22:25 - equal to false so we're gonna say let
22:27 - them purchase it but if it's already if
22:31 - the value is set to true and they've
22:33 - already purchased it then we want to
22:35 - spawn this a car so to spawn the car
22:40 - what we're going to do is we're going to
22:42 - have a remote events in replicated
22:44 - storage so let's click on the plus and
22:47 - click on remote events or let's type it
22:49 - in we're then going to give it a name
22:50 - called spawn car and we're going to then
22:56 - say game don't replicate the storage dot
23:01 - spawn car coal on fire server and then
23:05 - we can say scripts parent stock parent
23:09 - don't name because that is the name of
23:11 - the car the name of the image label is
23:13 - the same as the name of the car so we
23:16 - can just call this remote event I wanna
23:20 - say okay spawn in the car which has this
23:22 - name we now need to go back into our
23:24 - main script on the server and we need to
23:29 - create another event for the remote
23:32 - event don't forget to save your work if
23:34 - you haven't already just click on the
23:35 - Save button up here and it's gonna save
23:37 - your work okay so we're going to drop a
23:41 - few lines in this main script and then
23:43 - we're gonna say down what replicated
23:45 - storage and then we can say come on wait
23:49 - for trial and then in speech marks we're
23:52 - gonna say spawn car like this and then
23:55 - we can say dots on silver events colon
23:59 - connect open bracket function open
24:03 - bracket close bracket and then we're
24:06 - going to have player as our first
24:08 - parameter and name of car as the second
24:12 - one so what we can do now is we can drop
24:17 - a line and we want to spawn the car
24:20 - next to the player so what we're going
24:22 - to do is we're going to we're gonna say
24:26 - game actually we need to first get the
24:29 - car from the cars folder so we're going
24:33 - to say local car equals game but server
24:38 - storage dot cars : flying first child
24:42 - and then in speech marks we're gonna
24:45 - actually not in speech marks I'm just
24:47 - gonna say name of car and like this okay
24:50 - so we've got the car out of server
24:53 - storage and we now want to just put coal
24:57 - on loan like this so we've made a clone
24:59 - of it okay so what we're going to do now
25:02 - is we're going to change the see frame
25:04 - of the car so that we can move it just
25:07 - next to where the player is so to do
25:09 - this we can just say car : set primary
25:13 - Part C for him and then we can do in
25:17 - brackets player dot character dot
25:21 - humanoid root parts dot C frame plus
25:28 - vector three dot new open bracket close
25:32 - bracket zero comma zero comma 15 make
25:37 - sure that your C frame has capital C and
25:39 - a capital F and the reason that we add
25:43 - the extra vector 3 new 0 0 15 is so that
25:48 - it doesn't spawn on the player but it
25:49 - spawns just a few studs away from them
25:52 - and we're set in the primary part C
25:54 - frame of the model so you need to make
25:57 - sure that your car has a primary part so
26:00 - you need to if you're just if you're to
26:02 - check if it has a primary part you need
26:04 - to open up the properties window and
26:06 - click on your model and if there is
26:09 - something in the primary part here then
26:11 - that's all good you have a primary part
26:14 - if it doesn't you need to click it and
26:16 - you need to then find any part inside of
26:19 - this model you should use the driving
26:21 - seat though and just click it to add
26:23 - that primary pup if you don't have a
26:25 - primary part it won't work because
26:27 - that's what we're moving and if there
26:29 - isn't a primary part then it won't be
26:31 - able to be moved so make sure you've got
26:33 - your primary
26:33 - pop and then after that what we're going
26:36 - to do is we're going to put the car in
26:38 - the workspace why sitting car what
26:40 - parent equals workspace and then to stop
26:43 - it from breaking up when it gets in the
26:45 - workspace we're gonna say car : make
26:49 - joints so there doesn't fall apart so
26:53 - let's go and try this out let's click on
26:55 - the play button and I'm going to call
26:58 - the event down here from the event from
27:00 - the command bar to just test it will
27:03 - click enter and our car has been spawned
27:06 - in so there we go we've got our car and
27:09 - we're almost ready to go ok so there we
27:13 - go we have our Buy button and what we're
27:17 - doing is we are going to spawn the car
27:19 - if the player has bought has already
27:22 - bought it what we're also going to do is
27:25 - we're going to head back into the main
27:27 - script and we're just going to say car
27:29 - dot name equals and then when you say
27:32 - player dot name dot dot and then we can
27:36 - say in speech marks and apostrophe s and
27:40 - then we can do another two dots and we
27:44 - can say name off car now what this will
27:46 - do is it will set the cars name to the
27:49 - players names and then the name of the
27:51 - car so for example if we just go and run
27:54 - this again the car has spawned in but
27:58 - it's called Alvin blocks his car now
28:00 - let's just go and put a space after this
28:02 - s so that now there should be two words
28:05 - and it should be called Alvin blocks his
28:08 - car there we go so you can see the car
28:10 - spawned in and it's been called Ivan
28:13 - blocks his car because I am the person
28:15 - who spawned it in now all we need to do
28:17 - is we need to we need to make this work
28:22 - for all the other cars so what we're
28:24 - going to do is we're going to take this
28:26 - local script and we're just going to
28:28 - paste it into the text of buttons here
28:31 - we're going to paste it into every
28:32 - single one and we also want to make sure
28:35 - that we copy this purchase to value and
28:37 - we paste it into each image label as
28:40 - well so now that we've done that we
28:42 - should be able to purchase some cars now
28:45 - make sure that you just go into these
28:47 - script service into the script and you
28:50 - give yourself enough cash to be able to
28:53 - purchase the cars and there we go let's
28:56 - try and purchase the red car so I'm
28:58 - gonna click on purchase and now if we
29:00 - click it again
29:01 - we should have spawned it and there we
29:04 - go now if we try and spawn it again we
29:07 - can spawn it in as many times as we like
29:09 - because we've purchased it and we can go
29:12 - and try and buy another car so we can
29:14 - just keep buying all of these cars until
29:16 - we run out of money but make sure that
29:18 - you don't spawn them on top of each
29:20 - other else they will go a little bit
29:22 - messy like that one over there there we
29:23 - go the next thing that we're going to
29:27 - want to do is we want to click on the
29:28 - purchased GUI and make sure that reset
29:30 - on spawn is unchecked otherwise if the
29:33 - player resets they're gonna have to buy
29:35 - the vehicle all over again so make sure
29:38 - that that's on checks and then we're
29:39 - also just gonna do one last little
29:41 - addition to the script we're going to
29:45 - make it show on the text label whether
29:47 - you've bought it or not and whether you
29:49 - can spawn it ok so to do this what we're
29:52 - going to do is we're going to change the
29:57 - text of the buy button so we're gonna
30:00 - take script your parents got x equals
30:02 - spawn just like that okay and that's all
30:05 - we need to do let's go and test this out
30:07 - on the run so we click purchase and then
30:13 - it says spawn and if we reset because we
30:16 - unchecked reset on spawn it should say
30:18 - of stea spawn and we should be able to
30:21 - spawn it in as many times as we like ok
30:23 - it did not it reset that was because
30:27 - reset on spawn was was checked let's go
30:29 - and uncheck it and try again we click it
30:33 - once it says spawn and if we reset it
30:36 - should stay as spawn on our screen there
30:41 - we go and were able to spawn it in again
30:43 - so there we go we are now just going to
30:46 - update this again by taking this local
30:49 - script copying everything inside it and
30:52 - updating it for every other Buy button
30:55 - ok so that is the purchasing side done
31:00 - let's just go ahead and just show the
31:03 - prices of the cars like we would we're
31:06 - doing at the at the start of the
31:09 - tutorial so this is very simple all we
31:11 - need to do is we can just go back to our
31:15 - one of our Buy button scripts and we can
31:19 - take the price of item code here and we
31:22 - can just go back to the price label
31:23 - script and paste that in so we've now
31:26 - got the price of our item what I'm gonna
31:29 - do is I'm gonna add a quick weight here
31:32 - just to make sure that everything's
31:35 - loaded and ready and then what we can do
31:37 - is we can say script parent text equals
31:41 - price of item and if we're going run the
31:44 - game the price should show up and there
31:48 - we go 750 is the price and if you want
31:51 - to add a little dollar sign in there you
31:54 - can just add speech marks add your
31:56 - dollar sign in and then put two dots to
31:59 - concatenate this together and have the
32:02 - price with it so it's just going run
32:05 - again and there we go 750 dollars is how
32:09 - much it costs so let's go back to this
32:11 - price label and we're going to just copy
32:15 - the price label and paste it into all of
32:18 - the image labels remember if you have
32:19 - more than four cars you'll need to do
32:21 - this for every single car you add in and
32:24 - I think that should be the end of the
32:26 - tutorial
32:27 - I think that is yep yeah oh wait no we
32:33 - need to add a close button for our
32:35 - purchase GUI we need to have a special
32:38 - button which will open and close it so
32:40 - we can just add a text button here let's
32:43 - scroll down and let's call it open slash
32:46 - close actually let's call it car
32:49 - purchase cast warning and we'll click
32:53 - text scaled we'll just put it in the
32:56 - middle of the screen vertically by
32:59 - setting not 0.5 and minus 25 and let's
33:02 - insert a quick local script in here and
33:04 - let's say scripts for parents got mouse
33:07 - button one click : connect open bracket
33:11 - function I
33:13 - close bracket and then when you say
33:15 - Scripps dot parent dot parent dot frame
33:18 - visible equals not and then we can just
33:22 - take this and copy it and paste it in
33:24 - again and what this will do is it will
33:27 - invert the current status of the frame
33:30 - visibility so if it's currently set to
33:32 - true it will be set to false and if it's
33:34 - set to false it will be set to true
33:35 - because we use this not to invert it
33:39 - let's go and test this out and click
33:41 - play and there we go we can open and
33:44 - close the GUI we can purchase all of our
33:46 - cars and if we don't have enough money
33:49 - let's go and just change our money to
33:52 - zero we shouldn't be able to spawn the
33:57 - cars yeah there we go we're not allowed
34:00 - to spawn them only when we have enough
34:02 - money so there we go we have just
34:04 - created a car spawn of GUI in roblox
