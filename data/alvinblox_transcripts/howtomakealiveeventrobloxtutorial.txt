00:01 - hello everybody and welcome to this
00:03 - roblox live events tutorial and when it
00:10 - does every single server so keep
00:14 - watching so a lot of people want to know
00:21 - how to add live events into their games
00:24 - and the way they work is by using
00:26 - something called OS dot time so if you
00:31 - were to go into a roblox script and
00:34 - print out OS dot time like this it
00:40 - prints out a number and this number is
00:43 - called the you next time so we can see
00:45 - over here on the right the unix time
00:47 - it's a system for describing a point in
00:50 - time so it could be in the future which
00:52 - is what we want for our live event
00:53 - because we want to pick a time in the
00:55 - future for the event to begin it is the
00:57 - number of seconds that have elapsed so
01:00 - the number of seconds that have gone by
01:02 - since the UNIX epoch or what's that
01:05 - well the UNIX epoch was on at midnight
01:10 - UTC so that's just the standard timezone
01:16 - universal timezone but anyway it
01:19 - happened at midnight UTC time on the
01:22 - first of January 1970 so what they did
01:25 - on the first of January 1970 at midnight
01:28 - they started a stopwatch pretty much and
01:32 - every second ever since the first of
01:35 - January in 1970 at midnight that
01:37 - stopwatch has increased by a second
01:40 - every every second it's gone up by one
01:42 - so obviously since then a lot of seconds
01:45 - have gone by so the time is going to be
01:49 - a big number and you can easily work out
01:52 - what this time is you can you know use
01:55 - OS dot time to find the current time the
01:58 - number of seconds that have passed since
02:00 - January the first in 1970 and you can
02:02 - see if I keep on calling it OS dot time
02:05 - here you'll see that it gets bigger as
02:09 - we get as we go go along
02:11 - every second if I keep doing it it's
02:13 - increasing so OS dot time is just a way
02:17 - in lure of getting the UNIX time since
02:20 - the epoch the epoch was the time when
02:23 - they began the time when was the epoch
02:26 - is the first of January 1970 okay
02:28 - and the unix time is tracking how long
02:31 - it has been since the epoch but it
02:33 - doesn't tell us how long in years or
02:35 - months or days or minutes or hours it
02:39 - tells us how long it's been in seconds
02:41 - so obviously this is a big number as
02:44 - I've told you if you were to put it into
02:46 - Google and divide by 60 to get the
02:51 - number of minutes then divided by
02:53 - divided by 60 again because you need to
02:55 - get the hour then divided by 24 then
02:59 - divide it by 365 you'll get 50 years and
03:05 - guess what 1970 was 50 years ago because
03:10 - you do 20 20 minus 50 1970 so it was 50
03:16 - point something years that's because
03:17 - it's taking into the month into account
03:19 - as well but what you need to know is
03:21 - that the unix time is the number of
03:23 - seconds that have elapsed since the
03:25 - first of January 1970 and how does this
03:28 - help us with our live event well because
03:30 - it updates every second as we've noticed
03:33 - it gets bigger every second and we we're
03:36 - able to know what this number will be at
03:39 - a certain point in the future right
03:41 - because if we wanted to get the unix
03:43 - time what it will be in ten minutes we
03:46 - just need to add on 600 because 600
03:50 - seconds is 10 minutes so if I show you
03:53 - this website here it's called epoch
03:54 - converter you can sure there's loads of
03:57 - other websites that do this because this
03:58 - is standard across in your computing and
04:01 - all that we need to pick a time for our
04:04 - live event to begin so I've gone to this
04:07 - website very useful and I'm gonna set
04:12 - the year to be 2020 the month to be 6
04:14 - for June the day to be the first because
04:17 - it's the first of June today and the
04:19 - hour it's currently 31 minutes past 6 so
04:22 - I'm going to make this
04:23 - the 6:33 and we'll have zero seconds so
04:30 - it's right on the dot and really
04:32 - important that you I you said a.m. or
04:34 - p.m. in the morning or the evening and
04:36 - then you set GMT you set it to your
04:40 - local time okay so it's going to go by
04:43 - the current time in your time zone so
04:45 - because I'm in the UK and it's 631 this
04:49 - will go off at 6:33 UK time so in two
04:51 - minutes
04:52 - so I then click on human date to time
04:55 - stamp that will give me the what the
04:58 - unix time will be when it gets to that
05:00 - time so when it gets to 6:30 three zero
05:03 - seconds the epoch time stamp will the
05:06 - unix time which is currently here so the
05:09 - the time don't forget is the amount of
05:11 - seconds that have passed since January
05:13 - the 1st 1970 and that is going up every
05:16 - single second so this number is the
05:18 - current epoch time and this number here
05:21 - which is the gonna be the epoch time at
05:23 - 633 is larger than this number because
05:26 - it's in the future so what we're gonna
05:28 - do is we're just going to go into our
05:29 - script and the copy this epoch time
05:31 - stamp I'm going to go into my script
05:33 - here so I'm gonna put this as the time
05:35 - to start okay and I'm also going to set
05:38 - the time to stop so when do I want my
05:40 - live event to stop what I want it to
05:41 - stop it 6:35 I'm gonna get a new time
05:44 - stamp so this time to stop is going to
05:48 - be the time after which say if you
05:50 - joined a new server it would play the
05:53 - live event but when it got to 6:35 it
05:55 - would no longer play it so now if we
05:58 - join the game it's saying that I've got
06:00 - 12 seconds to go and if we look at our
06:03 - timer
06:03 - well that's true there's only 7 6 5 4 3
06:08 - 2 1 seconds until it is 6 33 and it's
06:13 - saying start the live event so what
06:16 - we've done is we've picked a time in the
06:18 - future and we've got its unix time by
06:21 - converting the time and the human date
06:24 - to a timestamp and that's going to be
06:27 - the number of seconds since that first
06:28 - of January so we can make this our time
06:32 - to start and so we've got OS dot time
06:35 - we've got a while loop and
06:37 - every second with getting the current
06:39 - time so the OS dot time which is going
06:41 - to be this value here then we're
06:44 - checking will just deal with this if
06:47 - statement first we're checking to see if
06:50 - that OS dot time the time right now that
06:52 - number of seconds is greater than our
06:54 - time to start if it is greater than the
06:56 - time to start the moves off obviously
06:57 - exceeded the time which when we wanted
07:02 - to start so because the time to start
07:05 - will be in the future
07:06 - eventually the time now we'll catch up
07:08 - with it and it will become equal to or
07:10 - greater than that time more in it
07:12 - because you know we set our live event
07:15 - to begin at fifteen nine one zero three
07:17 - two seven eight zero and if you look
07:20 - here it's fifty nine 103 to eight so it
07:23 - was if you look at the last five digits
07:25 - it was three two seven eight zero it's
07:26 - now three two eight five four and it
07:28 - increases every second it's just that
07:30 - sometimes when I go out of having the
07:32 - view and I don't keep the window in
07:34 - focus it stops but it will come back
07:36 - down or if you're wondering so every
07:39 - second I'm checking to see if the
07:40 - current number of seconds is greater
07:42 - than the time to start and if it is then
07:44 - we can begin the live event but if it
07:46 - isn't and the time to start is still
07:49 - bigger than the current time we'll just
07:52 - print out how long it is until it is the
07:54 - next live event and a really quick way
07:57 - to find the amount of time until you're
08:00 - live again event begins is by saying
08:02 - time to start - time now because if time
08:06 - to start is bigger than the current time
08:09 - and we've not exceeded it yet then if
08:12 - you take away the time now from it
08:13 - you'll have a number of seconds so yeah
08:18 - I'll give you an example so it's 6:35
08:20 - let's create a timestamp for 637 so if I
08:23 - take with the timestamp and I just get
08:26 - up my calculator so if I take in this
08:28 - time stand here and we take away the
08:31 - current time which will be smaller right
08:33 - now you can see it's 96 seconds to go
08:36 - and if we were to keep doing this
08:37 - calculation it would eventually come
08:39 - down to zero that is what is going on in
08:42 - the script I forgot to update my time to
08:45 - stop denying let's just make that even
08:47 - further in the future I'll not explain
08:49 - that very soon
08:51 - so here we go so yes 62 seconds now so
08:55 - that's going to count down right because
08:57 - it's just subtracting the current time
08:59 - from that time to start so when the time
09:04 - now which is current always going up
09:06 - every second eventually it will be
09:07 - greater than all the time to start so
09:08 - that will begin the live event so I
09:10 - trigger a function and I break the loop
09:12 - because once the live event has happened
09:14 - we no longer need to be checking for it
09:16 - okay but if you think about it if you
09:18 - open up a new server which is it's past
09:21 - the time to start say the time to start
09:23 - with 7:33 and you've opened a new server
09:26 - at 7:35 then it's going to launch the
09:31 - live event straight away and what if you
09:32 - want a cut off time you don't want to
09:34 - show the live event in new servers after
09:38 - a certain time so say the live event
09:40 - happened at 7:35 and maybe you want it
09:42 - to occur in new servers for five minutes
09:45 - afterwards then you would just set this
09:47 - time to stop to be 7:40 because it's
09:50 - five minutes in the future
09:51 - that's when after that time live events
09:54 - will no longer play in new servers
09:56 - because we've gone past the live event
09:58 - and it's over now so the time to start
10:02 - it's going to be in the future it will
10:04 - be greater than the OS dot time which is
10:06 - the current number of seconds this epoch
10:09 - time so whenever OS dot time becomes
10:11 - equal to or greater than the time to
10:13 - start we know it's time to begin the
10:14 - event however time to stop will also be
10:17 - in the future but it'll be greater than
10:19 - the time to start value so this is the
10:21 - time at which the live event will no
10:23 - longer be played anymore so if a new
10:25 - server is started up in the future after
10:27 - the live event has played it will no
10:29 - longer play the live event if the time
10:31 - stop hasn't been exceeded so once it has
10:33 - been exceeded it will no longer play the
10:35 - live event in new servers after that
10:37 - time so how do you trigger things to
10:39 - happen when you when your live event
10:41 - happens so I've created a function
10:43 - called live events and I'm calling it
10:45 - when the time now gets greater than the
10:47 - time to start and I can you can do any
10:50 - code in here so if you wanted to launch
10:52 - a rocket for example I could insert a
10:55 - body force into this rocket here so what
10:58 - I've just done I've made some code in
10:59 - this live event function which is going
11:01 - to insert a body force into the rocket
11:04 - and an anchor it and turn on some
11:05 - particle images so it looks like it's
11:07 - blasting off into space we now just need
11:09 - to create our new time to start and time
11:10 - to stop so in the UK it is six forty one
11:13 - sixteen and that's the current time so
11:16 - I'm gonna make this event happen at 6:42
11:18 - we're gonna go on human dates to time
11:20 - stamp I'm gonna copy that and put it as
11:23 - our time to start I want the event to no
11:26 - longer be played after 643 so I'm gonna
11:30 - create another time stamp and I'm gonna
11:33 - copy that
11:34 - you see it's 60 seconds ahead of the
11:37 - time to start so let's head in I'm gonna
11:40 - just spawn find my little rocket and
11:45 - let's just clear the output to go to
11:48 - that error from a different script and
11:50 - it is um off the ground a little bit and
11:52 - that's my own fault sorry about that
11:54 - but if we watch now three two one and we
11:58 - should have liftoff and there we go it
12:00 - fires itself into the air and off goes
12:03 - the rocket now I said about that time to
12:05 - stop window right so because you will
12:08 - still be able to see it in new service
12:10 - even though the time the timer has gone
12:12 - past 642 it's still launching itself
12:17 - right every time we open a new server
12:19 - that's because the time to stop will
12:22 - stop us from from launching it in new
12:24 - servers after 643 so we can do it you
12:28 - know as many times as we like as long as
12:30 - the time is is lower than 643 so as soon
12:34 - as it hits 643 on the clock will no
12:36 - longer be able to launch the rocket in a
12:38 - new set but the live event won't play
12:40 - because we're breaking the while loop if
12:43 - the time to stop has been exceeded so
12:46 - let's just go back here and it's about
12:48 - to be 643 so we'll wait for 643 and then
12:53 - we'll open up a new server so here we go
12:56 - you can see 383 80 so now the unix time
13:00 - is greater than this timestamp which
13:03 - ends in 380 which means that if the time
13:06 - now is greater than the time to stop
13:08 - which it is it's just going to break out
13:09 - the while loop it won't even get to this
13:11 - if statement and it won't be able to run
13:12 - the live event so if I go into the game
13:15 - it
13:16 - but it's to launch the rocket but it
13:18 - actually doesn't because the time to
13:20 - stop has been exceeded so the live event
13:22 - will no longer work in new service so
13:25 - that is all you need to know about live
13:27 - events on roblox we're using math sorry
13:30 - OS time to get the current UNIX epoch
13:33 - time which is a universal time used in
13:37 - computing so I'm also using the epoch
13:39 - convert their websites to change a human
13:42 - date into an epoch timestamp and then
13:45 - then using these variables time to start
13:47 - on time to stop to tell the script when
13:50 - I want my live event to begin and I'm
13:52 - having a wild loop which will track
13:54 - every second to see if it's time yet by
13:56 - comparing that os time to the time to
13:59 - start on time to stop values and when
14:01 - that's the current time is greater than
14:03 - that time to start we know it is time to
14:05 - start the live event so I hope that was
14:08 - useful if it was please leave a like and
14:10 - don't forget to subscribe to my channel
14:12 - for more scripting videos why not check
14:14 - out some others I've got loads of
14:15 - interesting videos and an advanced
14:17 - series as well if you're trying to push
14:19 - your knowledge on roblox scripting
14:20 - thanks for watching and I'll see you
14:22 - next time
