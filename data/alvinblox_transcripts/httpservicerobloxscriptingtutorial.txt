00:00 - how to use HTTP service to make requests
00:04 - to external web servers from a Roblox
00:06 - game so firstly you have to insert a
00:09 - script into server script service or
00:11 - anywhere on the server because you can
00:13 - only use HTTP service on the server this
00:16 - is to prevent exploiters from having a
00:18 - field day sending requests from Roblox
00:21 - next you need to turn on the HTTP
00:23 - service so we'll go to game settings
00:26 - permissions sorry security and enable h
00:29 - HTTP requests then click on Save okay
00:33 - now in our script let's get the HTTP
00:36 - service by saying
00:39 - this okay and then let's create a
00:42 - variable for our URL okay so the the URL
00:47 - of the web server that we're going to
00:50 - request so let's just get a URL I'm
00:54 - going to use this URL which is row proxy
00:59 - uh it's a way of reaching the Roblox
01:01 - apis uh because you can't use the Roblox
01:04 - apis on your own you have to use a proxy
01:06 - server and what this will do is it will
01:09 - return a bunch of information about my
01:12 - Roblox user and I'll see if I can get it
01:14 - on the
01:15 - screen okay here is the data that you
01:18 - get from going to this URL so by using
01:20 - HTTP service we can pull all of this
01:23 - data into our game and then use it
01:26 - however we
01:27 - like so I'm just going to keep that down
01:29 - in the corner corner so that we can uh
01:31 - we can see it as we're making the
01:33 - request and what we're going to do in
01:36 - order to get that data into our script
01:38 - we need to make a call so we'll say HTTP
01:41 - Service uh colon get async and then
01:45 - we'll put the URL in and then we will
01:50 - store this as a variable so we'll just
01:51 - put this as HTTP response for now and
01:54 - what we then need to do is we need to
01:56 - decode it okay because it's it's
01:57 - currently in Json for all right
02:00 - JavaScript object notation we want to
02:04 - decode that so we can access it like a
02:06 - normal table in L so we will say local
02:09 - decoded equals HTTP service colon Json
02:14 - decode and we'll put HTTP response in
02:17 - there and then we can print out the
02:20 - decoded table now this is assuming it
02:23 - exists so let's just say if HTTP
02:26 - response then and we'll put this in here
02:28 - just in case
02:30 - and then it should all be good so let's
02:33 - click on
02:34 - run see what happens okay so we've got a
02:37 - table returned here and if we look at
02:39 - this table you can see it's exactly the
02:41 - same as what we've got down here in the
02:43 - corner so we've got created description
02:45 - display name has verified badge ID is
02:48 - Ban name all right so there you go
02:51 - that's a very simple request you can
02:53 - then pull out any of this data from this
02:54 - table say I wanted to get whether I'm
02:58 - banned on Roblox or not you could say
03:00 - decoded do is band and then print is um
03:05 - and we can get my name as well is
03:07 - decoded dot uh name band and we can say
03:13 - is
03:15 - band and we'll just make that a string
03:18 - so that it doesn't cause an error and
03:21 - we'll run this
03:22 - again and you see no I'm not banned so
03:26 - that is how you can use HTTP service to
03:28 - make requests now what is this usually
03:31 - used for well you see a lot of Roblox
03:33 - games these days that have uh code
03:36 - verification so it will check to make
03:39 - sure you're a user of their group or
03:41 - whether you follow them on social media
03:43 - or whether you're a member of their
03:45 - server or not uh and also lots of games
03:48 - now use HTTP service to log uh things
03:52 - about their game so log when users join
03:55 - uh use they sometimes use it for band
03:57 - systems for external data storage it's
03:59 - really useful to know um because you can
04:02 - do lots of fun things such as this um
04:05 - but also you can do other things you can
04:07 - also send requests to servers I've just
04:09 - shown you how to get data from a URL um
04:13 - such as roxy.com but there's so many
04:16 - more apis out there um which you should
04:18 - check out which will let you pull in all
04:20 - sorts of data for your game you know for
04:22 - example you could pull in the amount of
04:24 - likes that your Roblox game has got to
04:26 - create a like goal or you could uh um
04:30 - you know you could pull in details about
04:33 - when the next live event is going to be
04:35 - so that is how you do HTTP Service uh
04:39 - requests let me know if you enjoyed it
04:41 - let me know if you have any more video
04:43 - ideas um subscribe to the channel if you
04:46 - want to see more of them and I'll see
04:47 - you in the next one
