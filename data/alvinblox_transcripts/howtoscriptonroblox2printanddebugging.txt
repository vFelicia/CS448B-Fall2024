00:00 - hello everyone and welcome back to your
00:03 - second roblox scripting tutorial
00:05 - now in the previous video which i
00:06 - recommend you go and watch if you have
00:08 - not already it was on
00:09 - properties and in that video we
00:12 - encountered an
00:12 - error and the error was that we were
00:16 - writing some code which set the
00:18 - transparency
00:19 - property of a part which was named part
00:22 - in the workspace but actually we had
00:25 - then gone on to rename the part before
00:27 - we run the script
00:28 - and so it threw an error in our code
00:32 - now i'm going to show you how you can
00:34 - debug these errors because sometimes
00:36 - you'll be thinking
00:37 - well you know why is this script not
00:38 - working sometimes it might not even
00:40 - throw you an error message
00:42 - so how do you figure out the line where
00:45 - your script
00:46 - stopped working so imagine we've got
00:48 - lots of lines of code here all right
00:50 - let's just set this one to alvin block
00:52 - so it will actually work
00:54 - let's put this at the top here let's
00:56 - just do a couple of these
00:59 - right so in these lines of code one of
01:02 - them is not going to work
01:03 - so let's imagine we didn't know which
01:05 - one was going to cause the error
01:07 - what we could do is we could use
01:08 - printing so if we print
01:10 - we can print a message to this output
01:12 - window which i spoke about yesterday
01:15 - yesterday in the last video so we can
01:17 - print out a message
01:18 - and that message could be a number like
01:21 - 32
01:22 - and it will appear in the output window
01:24 - here there you go can you see that
01:26 - it's printed out 32. now you can also
01:29 - print out
01:30 - text but like i said in the previous
01:31 - video you can't just go
01:33 - writing out text like this you know
01:36 - hello guys
01:36 - that's not going to work and then you've
01:38 - got these lines underneath because the
01:40 - script
01:41 - is confused so what you need to do is
01:43 - because it's text we need to wrap it in
01:45 - a string
01:45 - by using speech marks so if we use
01:48 - speech marks
01:48 - it goes pink that tells us it's a string
01:51 - and now
01:52 - if we run the code is going to print
01:55 - my text hello guys so this is just
01:57 - printing a message
01:59 - to the script so you can see the
02:01 - potential uses
02:02 - of printing you could print out to say
02:05 - that a certain line
02:06 - has ran so we could do a print saying
02:09 - the script has started running
02:12 - and we can do another one after the the
02:15 - second line
02:16 - to say executed line two
02:20 - and let's do another one saying we've
02:22 - executed line four
02:24 - so we've we've got past line four and we
02:27 - could do another one to say we've got
02:28 - past
02:29 - line six and let's do another one at the
02:32 - end
02:32 - to say we have finished
02:36 - running now you don't have to do prints
02:37 - you know they're not you don't have to
02:39 - have a print
02:40 - to make your script work this is just to
02:42 - um
02:43 - tell you to give you messages to make
02:45 - sure that your script has
02:47 - operated and ran correctly right you
02:49 - don't have to do this for every script
02:50 - i would only do this when we encounter
02:52 - an error
02:53 - so let's run the code again and see what
02:55 - happens right so we've got our error
02:57 - here
02:58 - and we can see that the script had
03:00 - started to run printed the first print
03:03 - and then it's set the transparency of
03:05 - the part alvin blocks to zero
03:07 - that worked fine no errors there and
03:09 - then we go on to line three
03:11 - you see it's printed out executed line
03:13 - two so we've got here
03:15 - and then uh it doesn't print out this
03:18 - one so it doesn't print out executed
03:20 - line four
03:21 - instead we just get this error so you
03:23 - can see it works in order so
03:24 - script started running that's line one
03:27 - then it's executed line two
03:28 - because it's got this far but then we've
03:31 - got an error on line four
03:33 - so the script has totally stopped so
03:35 - when you get an error
03:36 - the script just uh grinds to a whole it
03:38 - stops in its tracks so it doesn't go any
03:40 - further
03:41 - it's got to this line and it's thought
03:43 - right okay
03:44 - game dot game.workspace.part so i'm
03:46 - going to look in the workspace
03:48 - for an object that's called part oh it's
03:50 - not there
03:52 - there's no object called part in the
03:53 - workspace i don't know what to do now
03:56 - so it's going to just stop right there
03:58 - and it's going to say right that's it
03:59 - i've had enough
04:01 - and that's the end of this script so
04:02 - it's not even going to print
04:04 - executed line 4 it's not going to do any
04:06 - of this even though this code is correct
04:09 - because we had an error up here this
04:11 - script has stopped
04:12 - and you can already see why errors are
04:14 - such a problem in scripting
04:16 - because imagine if this script was your
04:18 - main game script
04:20 - which was like controlling your game
04:21 - loop so you had a murder mystery game
04:23 - and then you get an error right it's
04:25 - gonna just stop the game
04:27 - everyone's going to crash out the game
04:28 - and leave so errors
04:30 - are really bad and most of the time
04:33 - they're caused due to typos
04:35 - and in this case they are indeed caused
04:38 - by a typo because we called this part
04:40 - part instead of alvin blocks so if you
04:43 - see an error in the output window
04:45 - don't fear just try and use printing to
04:48 - identify
04:48 - where the problem happened if your
04:50 - script didn't work your script when you
04:52 - get an output message like this an error
04:54 - message
04:55 - it should usually say which line it
04:57 - fails on in this case
04:59 - it said line four and it gives us the
05:01 - script name it tells us
05:02 - that it was a server script we'll get
05:04 - into what server scripts are in a later
05:06 - video
05:07 - but it gives you a decent error message
05:09 - saying part is not a valid member of
05:11 - workspace
05:12 - you can interpret that as the script
05:14 - saying i looked in the workspace for an
05:16 - object
05:16 - called part but it wasn't there so i
05:18 - stopped running
05:19 - and now that i fixed the problem let's
05:21 - run the script again
05:23 - and here you go so again ignore this
05:26 - error here
05:27 - it's completely unrelated you can say
05:30 - you can see here the script started to
05:31 - run
05:32 - executed line two executed line four
05:34 - executed line six
05:36 - and we have finished running so there
05:38 - you go the script
05:39 - ran perfectly without any errors and
05:41 - once it gets to the bottom of the script
05:43 - with no more
05:44 - lines of code to go it will just stop
05:47 - running so this script is no longer
05:48 - running
05:49 - it says executed it is at the end of
05:52 - its life thanks for watching drop a like
