00:00 - in this video I'm going to be showing
00:03 - you how to use bindable events on roblox
00:06 - let's get started
00:08 - [Music]
00:11 - so welcome back to another tutorial my
00:14 - name is Ivan block sniffs it's your
00:15 - first time here make sure that you
00:17 - subscribed and that you've turned on the
00:19 - notification bow so you never miss out
00:21 - on when I upload a brand new video so
00:24 - what are bindable events one a bindable
00:26 - event is it's a type of event similar to
00:30 - remote events which you might have heard
00:32 - of before and what it does is it allows
00:34 - two scripts to talk to each other so one
00:37 - script will fire the bindable event and
00:39 - the second script will pick it up and
00:41 - listen out for this event to be
00:43 - triggered and when the event does get
00:45 - triggered it can run another piece of
00:47 - code so it's one script telling another
00:50 - script to do something else so it allows
00:53 - your script to communicate with each
00:55 - other talk to each other and they're
00:57 - quite useful when you're making your own
00:58 - games because you might want to only
01:00 - trigger a certain piece of code at a
01:02 - specific time so you can use a bindable
01:05 - event and trigger it from a different
01:07 - script to do different things so the
01:11 - difference between bindable events and
01:12 - remote events is that bindable events do
01:16 - are not useful for when you're trying to
01:18 - make your game filtering enabled or non
01:22 - experimental because remote events they
01:25 - aren't they allow you to talk they allow
01:29 - the client to talk with the server so
01:31 - the player to talk with the server
01:34 - however bindable events only allow you
01:37 - to talk on the server so you can have a
01:41 - server script talking to another server
01:43 - scripts but let's say you couldn't have
01:45 - a server script talking to a local
01:48 - script in the player everything has to
01:51 - be on the server so in the workspace
01:54 - service script service server storage
01:56 - when you're using bindable events so two
01:59 - scripts which can talk to each other on
02:01 - the server that is what a bind book
02:03 - event does so yeah it's intended for
02:07 - server to server not client to server so
02:09 - let's go and do a little example of how
02:12 - they work so I've got a bindable event
02:15 - in the workspace if you want to add one
02:17 - you just click on the plus and type in
02:19 - bindable event and I've also got two
02:21 - scripts in here so
02:22 - once called event fire and one is called
02:24 - event listener so the way that a
02:26 - bindable event will work is you have one
02:29 - script which fires the event and then
02:32 - you'll have a second script which is
02:33 - listening out for this event to be fired
02:35 - and when it's fired by the first script
02:37 - the second script which will be
02:39 - listening out for it will pick it up and
02:41 - will execute its code so we're going to
02:44 - start off with our fire swoops and we're
02:46 - gonna trigger this event so that it can
02:49 - be picked up in the listener script so
02:52 - an example of how this might work is
02:54 - let's say for example you are trying to
02:57 - make the bass play a different color but
03:02 - we're going to trigger it from a
03:03 - different script so let's go into our
03:07 - fire script and we're going to create a
03:09 - variable for our bindable event so let's
03:11 - say local bindable
03:13 - Advent equals game plot workspace : wait
03:19 - for child and inside the speech marks we
03:22 - can save find a ball event just like
03:25 - this once we've done that what we're
03:27 - going to want to do is begin
03:29 - constructing the trigger so to trigger
03:32 - the event and to send it off to the
03:36 - listener we're going to do is we're
03:38 - going to say bindable events because
03:40 - that is the name of the event something
03:42 - on the variable and then we're gonna say
03:43 - : a fire open bracket close bracket and
03:46 - that's all you have to do to fire off
03:49 - your bindable event so now that we fired
03:51 - it we need to go into the listener
03:53 - script and we need to write some code
03:55 - which will execute whenever this event
03:58 - gets fired by a different script so to
04:00 - do this we're going to create another
04:02 - variable for our bindable event just
04:06 - like we did in the first script
04:10 - wait for a try old open bracket close
04:14 - bracket and inside of these we're going
04:16 - to just say in speech marks find will
04:18 - event so we've got our bindable event
04:21 - which is in the workspace and now what
04:24 - we're going to do is we're going to
04:27 - create a listening event which will
04:32 - always be on the lookout to see when
04:34 - this event gets triggered when it is
04:36 - triggered what's going to happen is it's
04:38 - going to execute some code and in this
04:41 - case we're going to change the color of
04:42 - the base plate so let's say bindable
04:45 - event dot events color on connect open
04:52 - bracket function open bracket close
04:54 - bracket drop a few lines and now we've
04:58 - got our listener event so any code which
05:01 - goes in here in here will run when the
05:05 - bindable events is fired so when we fire
05:09 - it from this script this second script
05:12 - is going to run the code which is inside
05:15 - of this event so let's go and set the
05:18 - base plate to a random color so that's
05:21 - the game dot workspace stop face plate
05:24 - topper it color equals brick color new
05:29 - open bracket close bracket and we can
05:32 - say really red in fact let's make this
05:35 - random let's say brick color random open
05:39 - bracket close bracket so this is going
05:42 - to make me baseplate a random color so
05:45 - let's go and test this out we're going
05:47 - to head back into the base plate I'm
05:52 - going to click on run and if you go into
05:55 - the output you can see nothing has
05:58 - happened in fact something did actually
06:03 - happen the base plate just got chained
06:06 - to the same color because it was random
06:08 - so what are the chances so what I'm
06:10 - going to do is we're going to just go to
06:11 - the fire script and let's just add a
06:14 - weight 3 just so we can see the change
06:17 - happen and see it change to a different
06:20 - color so let's run the script again
06:23 - I'm gonna wait 1 2 3 and you can see it
06:27 - has changed to a random color let's go
06:30 - and run it again
06:32 - after 3 seconds it should change to a
06:34 - different color okay and it'll keep
06:38 - going I think it might change to the
06:40 - same color yeah he is because of some
06:43 - issues with random but let's change this
06:47 - to brick color got new open bracket
06:51 - close bracket really red let's run this
06:55 - and it should change to red after 3
06:58 - seconds there we go so what's happened
07:02 - is we have got our fire script and after
07:06 - 3 seconds this script is firing the
07:09 - bindable event and then our second
07:11 - script is picking up this event which
07:14 - just got triggered and it's running this
07:16 - code which will make the baseplate
07:18 - red but what if you want to change it to
07:23 - a different color but you want to
07:26 - specify that from the fire script so
07:30 - what we can do is we can pass an
07:31 - argument here and this argument will get
07:34 - sent over to the listener scripts so
07:36 - that the listener script can update the
07:38 - baseplate color to whatever we specify
07:41 - it to be so let's say in brackets in
07:44 - this in these brackets in in the string
07:46 - let's say really blue that's gonna be
07:50 - our color and we've passed it as an
07:52 - argument you can have as many arguments
07:53 - as you want just separate them by commas
07:55 - and when you're in the listener scripts
07:57 - it's going to be done in order so the
08:00 - first argument is going to be the the
08:04 - color this string because it's the first
08:06 - one which we have which we've typed out
08:09 - but in our case there's only one
08:11 - argument which we've specified so we
08:14 - only need to say we need we need to
08:16 - write one place placeholder argument
08:18 - here so let's just say color because
08:20 - this color will be updated to the color
08:24 - that we actually specify when the fire
08:28 - script sends over really blue so it's
08:31 - going to take this really blue and tell
08:33 - the listener that the
08:35 - is going to be really blue so let's go
08:38 - and run this and hopefully the baseplate
08:40 - should turn really blue after three
08:42 - seconds so there we go it's turned blue
08:45 - you can see we sent the argument of
08:47 - really blue it's picked it up as color
08:51 - and it has updated the brick color to
08:54 - whatever that color was so that's how
08:56 - used bindable events and and arguments
08:59 - in roblox to do I hope this video helped
09:02 - you if it did please leave a like make
09:04 - sure to subscribe
09:05 - turn on the notification box in Everton
09:08 - Sierra myself I want to upload a new
09:10 - video and this is Alvin blocks telling
09:12 - you to keep scripting
