00:00 - if you new to my channel make sure to
00:01 - subscribe and click on the notification
00:03 - bow so you never miss out when I upload
00:07 - a brand new video
00:08 - so let's just go ahead and make that
00:10 - folder right now so we can go back into
00:13 - the studio back into our main script and
00:16 - that we're gonna do we're gonna create
00:18 - another script just to keep it just to
00:20 - keep our data saving and I'm on our
00:23 - remote events function scripting a
00:25 - separate gonna create another script and
00:27 - we're going to call this script saving
00:34 - okay and in the scripts we're just going
00:38 - to quickly create a player added script
00:41 - which looks like this and inside of this
00:45 - what's going to happen is we're going to
00:48 - create a folder in their in their player
00:52 - sorry in play tools and we can later on
00:57 - in the tutorial we all scripts it so
00:59 - that it can save and load their data so
01:02 - what we're just gonna do is we're gonna
01:04 - create a folder by saying a local player
01:07 - tools folder equals instance new folder
01:12 - and then we could say a game it's gonna
01:16 - go into game dot service storage in fact
01:19 - we're gonna do we're just gonna end it
01:20 - there
01:21 - then we can say player tools folder name
01:24 - equals player dot name and we can say
01:28 - player tools folder lock parent equals
01:31 - game got server storage dot player tools
01:35 - now if we go and play the game a folder
01:40 - for us should be created in there tools
01:43 - so let's go check it out
01:45 - there we go we've got our folder so if
01:47 - we try and run the open shop event
01:51 - hopefully there we go you can see that
01:55 - the script which we just did earlier we
01:59 - just zoom in here you can see that it
02:03 - has printed out all five values from the
02:05 - table so it's looked in the tool models
02:09 - it's looked in the information it's got
02:11 - the cost of 550 and it's printed that
02:14 - out it's printed out in order so we've
02:16 - got the title first we've got the
02:19 - description then we've got how much it
02:21 - costs and then we've got the cost type
02:24 - and then we've got our false value so
02:27 - that tells us that we haven't bought the
02:30 - item yet which is true because it's not
02:33 - in our player models so you can see
02:36 - we've been able to loop over the table
02:38 - here
02:40 - we've been able to loop over it and
02:42 - we're printing each value from that
02:45 - table so all the ice all the variables
02:48 - are together
02:50 - so what we're gonna do now is we're
02:52 - going to update our GUI elements with
02:55 - this data so what we can do is we can
02:58 - start off with the title and we can say
03:00 - title text because don't forget we
03:03 - defined a variable for our title you say
03:06 - title text equals data and then in
03:10 - square brackets one okay so this is the
03:13 - first element or for first object in our
03:17 - table which we said was going to be the
03:21 - the title text because we put the title
03:24 - at position 1 so the title will be the
03:28 - first index of data and we're just
03:30 - getting that we also need to convert it
03:32 - to a string so we need to say to string
03:35 - and put brackets around it like that so
03:38 - now it's a string and it can go in the
03:40 - text field now that we've done that we
03:44 - can do the exact same thing by popping
03:46 - and pasting it for the description we
03:49 - say description text equals data 2
03:52 - because it's the second index and we
03:54 - said in the server script that the
03:57 - description would come second and what
04:00 - we want to do now is we want to we want
04:04 - to check to see if it's bought or not
04:06 - right so we need to say if data 5
04:10 - remember that's the true or false value
04:12 - whether it's bought or not equals equals
04:15 - false so if it's equal to false then we
04:18 - know that they haven't bought it yet so
04:25 - we need to set the text of the Buy
04:28 - button to how much this item costs so we
04:31 - can say by
04:33 - dot text because remember we've got a
04:36 - variable called by
04:39 - text equals and then we have a dollar
04:41 - sign in in quote marks and then we can
04:45 - do double dot to concatenate the string
04:49 - with how much it costs so we can't set
04:53 - the value with a dollar sign because
04:55 - it's an integer and we can't have a a
04:58 - string character with an integer so we
05:00 - put our dollar sign as a string and then
05:05 - we use the two dots to concatenate it
05:06 - with a number and that number is going
05:08 - to be data so it's gonna be two string
05:11 - because we are combining it to a string
05:14 - and we can say data three because the
05:18 - third index in our script was the cost
05:22 - so we're gonna have the dollar sign
05:24 - whoops and then the cost so else so if
05:29 - it has been bought we need to see
05:33 - whether it's equipped or not okay so
05:38 - what we can do is we're going to we're
05:42 - gonna insert a value in the player
05:44 - called equipped and that value is going
05:48 - to be updated whenever a tool which we
05:51 - own gets equipped so whenever we click
05:54 - the equip button the equipped value is
05:56 - going to be updated and then we can
05:58 - check to see if at all which we're
06:01 - working on the minute is already
06:03 - equipped and if it is and we will say
06:05 - unequip but if we know it isn't equipped
06:07 - we can set the text to say equip so it's
06:10 - a bit like an on/off system to toggle
06:12 - the equipping of a tool so we're gonna
06:16 - go into our service script now and just
06:18 - have a look and see if we can do that so
06:20 - let's head into the server script called
06:21 - saving and we're gonna want to create
06:24 - this value called equipped now it's very
06:26 - simple we just need to say a local
06:28 - equipped equals instance new so we're
06:33 - creating a new object here we're giving
06:36 - it the class name of a string value
06:40 - because we're updating this value with
06:42 - the name of the tool that's currently
06:44 - equipped
06:47 - and now we're gonna give it a name so we
06:49 - say equipped dot name equals whoops
06:52 - equipped with a capital e and we're not
06:57 - gonna set a value because when they join
06:59 - the game no tools are going to be
07:01 - equipped so now if we head back into the
07:04 - local scripts here and we go back what
07:09 - we're going to do is we're going to
07:10 - check to see if the tool is equipped or
07:13 - not so you can say if Claire doctor
07:17 - equipped dot value is equal or double
07:21 - equals if it is equal to model dot name
07:26 - then if it's so if the model that we're
07:30 - currently working with is currently set
07:32 - to the equipped value we know that the
07:34 - player has equipped and they're using it
07:36 - at the moment
07:37 - so we can set this the by text to say
07:40 - equipped but if it's not the equipped
07:46 - value we know that it's not equipped so
07:49 - we can say by text equals equip so that
07:54 - when they click the button instead of
07:57 - buying it they'll be equipping the item
07:59 - instead and we'll work on that later on
08:01 - when we script the Buy button and that
08:04 - is all we need to do for the initiate
08:07 - shop event so this is what we just
08:08 - worked on we've defined a variable for
08:12 - our current box value and we've set it
08:13 - to zero because when the shop opens up
08:16 - the camera will be pointing to the the
08:19 - first box which is called box zero we're
08:22 - setting the back button to be the
08:25 - disabled color so that it looks gray ish
08:27 - and the forward color will be the
08:29 - enabled color which we defined up here
08:31 - and then we're creating a variable
08:34 - called model which we're setting to nil
08:36 - because over here we're looping through
08:39 - everything inside our box which are
08:42 - currently on we're checking to see if
08:45 - the object inside of the box is a model
08:47 - and if it is we know that we found our
08:50 - tool objects and we can use this model
08:53 - to set
08:57 - our model name value okay which is in
09:00 - the shot in the shop frame here which
09:02 - we'll use later on then so this for loop
09:06 - is basically getting the name of the
09:08 - tool from the specific box so it's
09:11 - kissing the corresponding tool to the
09:13 - box and then we're getting the data for
09:16 - that specific tool by using a remote
09:19 - function to get the information and send
09:21 - it back so they can't be exploited by a
09:24 - hacker because it's taking place on the
09:27 - server and a client can't interact with
09:29 - the server well then just looping
09:31 - through the data to print out so we can
09:33 - see that everything went okay and then
09:35 - we're setting the title text the
09:37 - description text and the by button text
09:39 - to whatever that data is so we set in
09:43 - the title we sitting the description and
09:44 - then we're seeing if the item has been
09:47 - bought or not and if it is then we're
09:50 - setting the Buy button text so that's
09:52 - what we've done for the initiate shop
09:55 - event and now what should happen is if
10:00 - we try this out
10:01 - I think the GUI might hold some data
10:06 - let's go and just a zoom out from the
10:08 - input here the output sorry let's fire
10:12 - the events and you can see what's
10:15 - happened is we've got the super power
10:18 - drill which is the title we've got the
10:20 - description you can see the back button
10:23 - is sort of darkened out and the forward
10:26 - button is looking good so it's looking
10:30 - like proper user interface or we can
10:33 - click it and you can see that the Buy
10:36 - button has got the price of the item as
10:39 - it's text so it doesn't work yet none of
10:42 - the buttons actually work but you can
10:44 - see we're making some good progress
10:46 - towards the end and I'm not too sure why
10:49 - there are two tools in the box I'll have
10:53 - a look and see if we can sort out
10:55 - hi so I think I accidentally left a copy
10:58 - or a super power drill in box zero from
11:02 - earlier when I was showing you yep there
11:04 - we go when I was showing how it's gonna
11:06 - work so if we go into item roller and
11:09 - box zero I delete the super power drill
11:12 - we should be good to go with the next
11:14 - part let's just test it again now you
11:18 - let's just go and have a
11:19 - behind-the-scenes look here now if we
11:24 - weren't a player if we weren't currently
11:26 - in the shop this is what it would look
11:29 - like so we've got our backdrop here and
11:32 - we've got our four boxes which have been
11:35 - generated now each box has got the tool
11:39 - inside of it because we set the primary
11:41 - part C frame of each tool and what's
11:44 - happening is when we fire the event I'm
11:46 - just going to fire it in the command bar
11:47 - it fades the camera position is set to
11:52 - that box and the GUI is just added in so
11:56 - it's a bit of an illusion because your
11:59 - camera is being set there and you see we
12:01 - can walk into the box so our players
12:03 - still in the game it's just that the
12:05 - backdrop and everything else will be in
12:07 - another part of the game world and we
12:09 - can cut to it so there we go
12:13 - okay so I think now is a good time to
12:17 - switch from the client-side coding to
12:20 - the server-side now we've done a lot to
12:23 - do with the camera and the GUI and we
12:26 - need to add some important values into
12:29 - our player when they join the game so
12:31 - that we can script the rest of this shop
12:33 - so what we're going to do is we're going
12:36 - to head back into the saving script and
12:39 - we're going to define a few more values
12:41 - to go inside the player now eventually
12:43 - we'll be working on datastore we'll
12:45 - leave that towards the end there are a
12:48 - few more important things we need to
12:50 - insert into the player so at the top of
12:52 - the script we're going to start off by
12:54 - inserting some leader stats so we can
12:56 - say local leader stats equals instance
13:00 - got new and then we're going to give a
13:04 - folder
13:06 - okay I'm gonna call this folder lead a
13:09 - startup name with the leader stats and
13:12 - it has to be spouts leader stats like
13:14 - this with a lowercase L everything in
13:17 - lowercase for the leader starts now that
13:21 - we've done that we can insert our
13:23 - currency into these leader stats and we
13:26 - can call it coins so local coins or cash
13:31 - we can call it cash if you want cash
13:33 - equals instance new we're gonna insert
13:37 - an int value we're gonna call this cash
13:41 - value so cash don't name equals cash and
13:45 - we're not gonna give it a value in fact
13:48 - the end let's go on and give it a value
13:49 - for now let's give it a value of a 5,000
13:53 - cash or there when we get on to the data
13:55 - store we won't be giving it a value
13:57 - because it will be saving and loading
14:00 - these saved value so now that we've done
14:05 - that we need to create another value so
14:07 - we can just copy this code for the cash
14:10 - and paste it in again but this time
14:13 - we're gonna call it in shop and so in
14:17 - shop so a capital S for shop everything
14:20 - asked me lowercase so this is what it
14:23 - looks like and then we're just gonna
14:25 - call it in shop okay now I've called my
14:29 - variable in shop with a lowercase I
14:32 - but with a capital S but that I've named
14:36 - it with an uppercase I in an uppercase s
14:40 - so just be wary of that that's what
14:42 - we're calling it I guess I could change
14:44 - it to in shop it really doesn't matter
14:47 - but we're going to change in shop value
14:52 - to false because this value is going to
14:54 - be used to see if the player is already
14:57 - in the shop looking at browsing items to
15:00 - buy so when they join the game there are
15:03 - C not going to be in the shop so we can
15:05 - set this to false
15:07 - okay so I think it's everything we need
15:10 - to do for now
15:11 - all the values so we can carry on with
15:13 - the rest of the scripting so there's a
15:17 - few things left that we need to do we
15:19 - need to script the back and forward
15:22 - buttons what you're going to do now we
15:24 - also need to script saving we need to
15:28 - script the exit button and we also need
15:31 - to script the transactions so that when
15:35 - a player actually clicks the Buy button
15:37 - we can check to see if they have enough
15:39 - money to buy the item and if they don't
15:42 - then we won't allow them to purchase the
15:44 - item so what we're going to focus on now
15:46 - is the back button so we're going to go
15:50 - into the back button the image put in in
15:53 - the shop frame and we're going to insert
15:56 - a local script whoops we insert of the
16:02 - localization table we're going to insert
16:04 - a local script
16:08 - so when we click this button we are
16:11 - going to move the camera along to the
16:14 - previous item if there's one there so
16:16 - the first thing we're gonna do is
16:18 - declare a few variables first so we're
16:21 - gonna declare the GUI for the entire
16:24 - shop so we're gonna say local GUI equals
16:28 - script parent dot parent dot parent now
16:33 - we can use the GUI to help reference our
16:37 - other variables now so we can say a
16:40 - local frame because GUI dot shop frame
16:45 - you can say local buy equals for in fact
16:49 - we can just say GUI wait for child shop
16:53 - frame over here we can say local bike
16:56 - equals frame wait for child buy and then
17:02 - we can just copy this line of code or
17:05 - the title description and the forward
17:10 - button so we can do title
17:16 - and just update the names we that we
17:20 - have meet other variable description
17:24 - just changed description
17:27 - and don't forget the forward
17:31 - now the variables I am writing in
17:34 - lowercase but the actual names of the
17:37 - items have a capital letter so make sure
17:40 - to be aware of that so that's all the
17:45 - variables that were going to need and
17:46 - we're going to want to have a mouse
17:49 - button one click event which looks like
17:52 - this and any code inside of this event
17:54 - it's going to run whenever the button
17:57 - has been clicked so actually this is an
18:01 - image button so we can actually use the
18:03 - activated event instead so inside of
18:07 - this event we're going to want to have
18:11 - the current box which is which we're
18:15 - looking at right so this is going to be
18:19 - whatever the current box value is set to
18:22 - so we can say local so box name is going
18:30 - to be script doctor and parent dot
18:34 - parent got current box okay so this is
18:37 - going to be our int value so it's not
18:39 - really the name of the box it's the
18:41 - number of the box so is it it's 0 or 1
18:45 - would say what if it's box 0 or box 1 so
18:48 - you get how it works but the box that we
18:51 - want to move to because when we click
18:53 - this button the back button you we're
18:55 - moving backwards so we're going the
18:57 - other way so the local box to move to is
19:02 - going to be the box name got a value
19:07 - minus 1 so for it box 1 the box to move
19:11 - 2 is going to be box 0 if we're on box
19:14 - 500 the box to move 2 is going to be 499
19:17 - because it's 1 previous than the current
19:20 - box
19:22 - so we're gonna have to actually check to
19:24 - see if there was a box to go to if we
19:29 - flick the button because obviously we
19:30 - wrote a box zero
19:31 - we can't go to box -1 because box 0 is
19:34 - the starting point so we can say if game
19:37 - dot workspace the item roller curl on
19:40 - find first child
19:43 - and then we can save Fox dot box to move
19:48 - to then we know that there is a box for
19:55 - when we click the back button so there's
20:00 - a box where we can go to there's a box
20:02 - for us to move the camera to so what we
20:06 - want to do is now that we know that the
20:08 - button will actually work if we press it
20:11 - because we can go to an item previous we
20:15 - can make this button active okay so we
20:17 - can we can change the color of the image
20:20 - so you can say scripts dot parent dot
20:24 - color 3 so image color 3 equals and then
20:29 - we're gonna want to have our disabled
20:31 - and enabled colors so we can go back to
20:33 - our local script and just copy these
20:36 - variables and put them into our scripts
20:40 - and we're gonna want to set the image
20:42 - color three of our back button to the
20:44 - enabled button color because if there
20:46 - was a box to move to we know that the
20:50 - the image the the back button is going
20:53 - to be enabled so we want to set it from
20:55 - that darkened image to that bright image
20:57 - telling the user that the button is able
21:00 - to be clicked what we're going to want
21:02 - to do the same for the forward button
21:04 - because of course if you're going back
21:05 - one you're also gonna be able to go
21:07 - forward to the one that you were on
21:09 - before so once a forward lock image
21:11 - color 3 equals enabled button color so
21:15 - they're both going to be enabled and
21:16 - they're both going to be able to be
21:18 - clicked
21:20 - well then gonna want to interpolate the
21:22 - camera now if you are listening earlier
21:24 - remember that interpolating the camera
21:26 - is smoothly moving it between two points
21:28 - and we moved it between the same points
21:31 - so that there wasn't actual any
21:34 - animation it just jumped to that point
21:37 - however this time we have two different
21:40 - points the point that we're at now and
21:42 - the point of the next box which we're
21:44 - going to so we want to interpolate the
21:47 - camera to the next box so we can say
21:50 - game drop workspace up current camera
21:55 - rah cut on interpolate and then in
22:00 - brackets we're giving the starter
22:02 - position which is going to be the cam
22:04 - part of the box we're currently on so we
22:06 - can say game dot workspace dot item or
22:09 - roller and in square brackets we're
22:11 - gonna say box dot dot box to move to dot
22:16 - camp art dot C frame so this is this is
22:22 - this is where we're going to okay this
22:24 - is the box where the camera is going to
22:27 - be looking at okay so this is the next
22:29 - box because we've got box and then we're
22:32 - concatenating it with the number which
22:34 - is the box to move to so if if the box
22:37 - name is one and box to move to it's
22:40 - going to be zero so it concatenates
22:42 - the zero with the box to form box zero
22:45 - which is the name of the box and the
22:48 - model which has the camp art which we're
22:51 - going to be interpolating to so that's
22:55 - why we're going to we also want to set
22:59 - this we want to set the other camera
23:03 - position which is going to be the item
23:07 - roller box box to move to which is the
23:10 - same thing if they gamed at once where's
23:15 - the item roller
23:17 - and then we say box dot dot box to move
23:24 - to
23:26 - dot cam part so we need to close the
23:28 - square brackets doctor cam part dot C
23:31 - frame and then we're going to give a
23:35 - time of 0.5
23:40 - actually no interplay is you you you
23:45 - don't have to specify where the camera
23:47 - is currently you have to specify where
23:49 - you're going to first and then you
23:51 - supply the focus of the camera so what
23:53 - it's focusing on so the cameras going to
23:56 - be moving to the new part but we're
23:58 - gonna stay focused on that part as well
24:00 - so that the camera doesn't look anything
24:03 - different it just keeps looking in the
24:05 - orientation of that part so we've kind
24:08 - of got a position to go to and an
24:10 - orientation it's not two of the same
24:13 - parts we're just using the same see
24:15 - frame one for the position and one for
24:17 - the rotation so there we go we've got
24:19 - our interpolate done and I'm just going
24:21 - to zoom out so you can read that you
24:23 - might want to pause the video so that
24:25 - you can copy that down so now let's
24:28 - carry on let's continue with the rest of
24:31 - the act button now that we have tweened
24:36 - the camera interpolated the camera to
24:38 - the previous item we want to update the
24:41 - Box name so we'd say box name value
24:43 - equals box name value - one differ on
24:48 - box one will now be on box zero what we
24:52 - want to do is we want to do the exact
24:53 - same thing that we did in the local
24:57 - scripts and that was getting the
24:59 - information in the issue in the initiate
25:02 - shop we're getting the information about
25:04 - the specific object so we can just copy
25:07 - all of this code which we did earlier
25:10 - copy it with ctrl C and then we're going
25:13 - to want to in fact we want to copy all
25:16 - of it we just want to copy the parts
25:21 - leading up to here
25:25 - okay well we'll use the title text and
25:27 - the description text
25:31 - so we're going to copy this code
25:34 - and I'm going to go back into the back
25:36 - button and we're going to paste it into
25:39 - this if statement
25:42 - and let's just make sure it's all
25:43 - indented
25:45 - so we're gonna select the data and it's
25:48 - all reset the code and then tick using
25:50 - tap and what we're gonna want to do is
25:53 - we're gonna have to change a few things
25:54 - here we haven't got item roller defined
25:57 - as a variable so we can say a local item
26:00 - roller equals game dot workspace item
26:04 - roller we're also gonna want to make
26:07 - sure that the frame is changed to the
26:10 - shop frame has changed to frame and we
26:12 - can also just define a replicated
26:14 - storage up here so local replicated
26:18 - storage equals game doctor replicator a
26:22 - game gets service replicated storage now
26:25 - i've spelt replicated storage with a
26:28 - lowercase R and uppercase s okay so now
26:32 - that we've done that we just want to
26:35 - handle the part where we display the
26:37 - price of the item because we're not
26:40 - going to handle the equipping here will
26:42 - we handle that with the initiate shop
26:45 - event so we can say if beta 5 equals
26:50 - equals false then and we're going to say
26:54 - bye dot text equals now dollar sign
26:59 - dot dot to string data 3 so if the is so
27:06 - data 5 is whether it's been bought or
27:09 - not so if it hasn't been bought then we
27:11 - want to display the price otherwise we
27:14 - will display the equip flush and equip
27:17 - messages because they will already be be
27:20 - there
27:22 - now what we now want to do we can now
27:25 - exit out of this this if statement here
27:28 - and we want to want to check to see if
27:33 - there is a previous box for the next one
27:37 - so if we if we start off at box to add
27:41 - so if we start off at box one and we
27:43 - click on the back button and we'll be at
27:46 - box zero but we want to check to see
27:48 - whether we can go back another one to
27:50 - see whether we can we can change the
27:53 - color of the whether the darkness of the
27:55 - button or the brightness well that user
27:57 - interface to show whether it's disabled
27:59 - or enabled so what we can do outside of
28:03 - the if statement we can see if game dot
28:05 - workspace item roller come on find a
28:10 - first child and then in brackets we can
28:16 - say box box to move to minus one and
28:22 - because remember box to move to is
28:25 - already the current box about box name
28:28 - value minus one but what what we're
28:30 - doing is we want to go another one you
28:35 - want to go another one from what it's
28:36 - currently at so we're kind of going to
28:38 - and back to but because it's already
28:41 - been - it's been negative is had one
28:44 - taken off it we're just taking another
28:46 - one off it to check so we can say then
28:49 - and then we can say script lock parent
28:53 - dot image color three equals and then we
28:59 - can say the enabled button color else we
29:03 - can do the exact same thing image /
29:07 - three equals is say board button color
29:10 - sure if there is an item
29:13 - before the one that we're currently at
29:15 - we can make the image clip set to the
29:18 - enabled color else we can make it the
29:21 - disabled color so that is everything
29:24 - that we need to do or the back button
29:29 - what we're gonna do now is we're gonna
29:30 - take this local script copy it and paste
29:34 - it into the forward button but there's a
29:37 - few changes which we need to make all
29:39 - we're going to do is we're going to
29:40 - change the negative signs to a positive
29:43 - sign because we're going forward so make
29:47 - sure that you change all of those even
29:50 - at the bottom
29:53 - and then what we're going to do is we're
29:56 - going to at the bottom of or near to the
29:58 - bottom of the scripts just after the
30:01 - if-statement checking to see if data 5
30:03 - is equal to false we're going to say
30:05 - else and then we're gonna have another
30:10 - end here
30:14 - and inside of this else statement we're
30:17 - going to do script doctoring
30:19 - image color 3 equals and then we can
30:22 - just do our disabled button color and
30:25 - we're gonna set back wouldn't change
30:29 - forward up here where it says forward
30:32 - we're going to copy up and just do a
30:34 - paste I will miss it
30:36 - back sorry we're going to change forward
30:42 - to back
30:44 - I'm gonna change order back here and
30:46 - then we can change back so wherever it
30:50 - says forward we can change to back here
30:53 - so let's have a look oh so we can do a
30:57 - find find all forward just to see if
31:03 - there's any forward in here nope
31:05 - just wherever there was a forward change
31:08 - that to back
31:12 - and then what we can do down here is
31:14 - save back got image color three equals
31:19 - and we can set that to enabled so if
31:23 - there's no if there's nothing more if
31:26 - there's no box left we can't go forward
31:28 - anymore we're gonna make the back button
31:31 - enabled and we're just changing board to
31:36 - back because we're on the forward button
31:38 - not the back button anymore we're
31:40 - inverting it all that's why we did the
31:42 - plus until the - I'm setting the back to
31:45 - the four just to save some time so that
31:48 - we don't have to write this all out
31:49 - again it's pretty much the same thing
31:51 - just with a few changes so if we go and
31:53 - have a look now and play the game it
31:56 - should work although you might have a
31:57 - couple of issues but hopefully not and
32:00 - so let's go ahead and run the event
32:02 - trigger it
32:05 - in a replica storage open shop you can
32:09 - see that the back button is disabled
32:12 - because we're on box zero and if we
32:14 - click the forward button and see that
32:17 - the camera tweens but we have some
32:19 - issues so it interpolates but we have a
32:22 - little a few issues with the with the
32:25 - camera and where it's being positioned
32:27 - so we're going to sort those out now
32:30 - okay so the reason for those black
32:32 - issues was because we I said here the
32:36 - first parameter in this interpolate
32:41 - function is the position okay so the
32:45 - position of where you want the camera to
32:46 - be the second one is the orientation of
32:50 - the camera and we've accidentally
32:52 - pointed it to the camper instead of the
32:54 - hitbox because we want it to be looking
32:57 - at the hitbox which is a m-- which is
33:00 - the big box in the center of of the box
33:03 - here it's a big part in the center of
33:05 - the box so we want it to be looking at
33:07 - this and not looking at the the camper
33:09 - which caused a few issues with the the
33:12 - orientation a/c frame of the cam part
33:15 - was looking into something which was was
33:18 - black was hence why we saw the camera
33:21 - went to that black screen so if you go
33:23 - into the forward button and we change
33:24 - cam part to hitbox over here but keep
33:27 - cam parts for the position what are we
33:31 - going to the back button do the same
33:32 - thing and if you run the game hopefully
33:37 - it should smoothly interpolate between
33:40 - the two boxes
33:42 - so we've got our first one we click on
33:45 - the forward button and there we go
33:47 - we get to see some smooth animation
33:51 - between the different products and you
33:54 - see when we get to the end of the list
33:55 - the forward button turns to darkness and
34:00 - you can see the back button does the
34:02 - same when we get to the front and as we
34:05 - move they change really well so that's
34:10 - another part of the video done we've got
34:12 - some really good progress now we've got
34:14 - the we've got the currency system in
34:17 - we've got the animation for the camera
34:19 - we've got the boxes done and there's
34:23 - only a few more things to go until we
34:25 - have our mining simulator shop complete
34:37 - you
