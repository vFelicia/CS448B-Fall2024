00:00 - so in the last video I showed you how to
00:02 - make the buttons in your Tycoon work
00:05 - however they're sort of useless at the
00:06 - moment because we don't have any
00:08 - currency that we can use to purchase the
00:11 - items so the Tycoon can be completed
00:14 - straight away so I'm going to show you
00:16 - how to add um the cash or money values
00:20 - to your game so that players actually
00:22 - have to spend it in order to unlock
00:24 - things so the first thing we're going to
00:26 - do is we're going to go to the Explorer
00:28 - panel and we're going to insert another
00:30 - script um just before we do that though
00:32 - I'm just going to look at this script
00:34 - that we worked on um
00:37 - previously and I realized that we we
00:40 - didn't use it in the end so I was going
00:42 - to have a separate script for the for
00:43 - the buttons but um we ended up putting
00:46 - it all into the plot Handler so that's
00:49 - okay I'm just going to delete that
00:50 - script from last
00:52 - time uh and instead we're going to
00:54 - insert another script and I'm going to
00:56 - call this script um uh data okay cuz
01:00 - it's going to handle the players data
01:02 - such as their currency whatever and then
01:06 - in the code here I'm going to firstly
01:09 - create another player added event so
01:11 - when a player joins a
01:14 - game I'm just going to do a comment here
01:16 - so that we can understand what we're
01:18 - working on so when a player joins the
01:20 - game we're going to say player added
01:22 - code on connect function and we have the
01:25 - argument of the player so we can
01:27 - actually do things to this this player
01:30 - and what we want to do is we want to
01:32 - obviously give them a money value to
01:34 - keep track of how much they've got and
01:36 - we want this to appear in the
01:37 - leaderboards in the top right of the
01:39 - game and to do this we need to uh
01:42 - actually create a folder so we're going
01:44 - to say local folder equals instance. new
01:48 - folder folder. name equals leader stats
01:52 - and you have to make sure leader stats
01:53 - is in lower case complete lower case
01:56 - otherwise this isn't going to work so
01:59 - folder parent equals player so we've
02:02 - created a folder which is going to store
02:04 - all of the players values that we want
02:06 - to appear on the leaderboard such as
02:08 - their cash so we're now going to create
02:11 - that specific cash or money value now I
02:15 - am going to call it cach again you can
02:17 - call it whatever you want but probably
02:19 - for this tutorial it's best to just
02:21 - stick to what I'm doing for now so we're
02:23 - going to insert an INT value okay an
02:27 - integer uh int is short for integer that
02:29 - just means any whole number like 1 2 or
02:32 - three it can store a number as long as
02:34 - it's not got decimal places so cash.
02:37 - name equals cach cash. value we're just
02:41 - going to set that to zero for now and
02:44 - cash. parent equals folder we're putting
02:47 - this cache value into this folder and
02:49 - when a value enters the leader stats
02:52 - folder it will then appear in the top
02:54 - right corner of the screen on the
02:56 - leaderboard so let me show you that
02:57 - right now if I click on the play button
03:00 - and we have a look at the um top right
03:03 - corner
03:05 - here you'll see that we now have a
03:08 - leaderboard so now what we need to do is
03:12 - we need to be able to purchase things
03:15 - right using this value so let's click on
03:17 - the stop
03:19 - button and now we're going to head back
03:21 - to our plot Handler which is where we
03:24 - have got the code for when we touch a
03:26 - button now we're going to want to scroll
03:28 - down to the part where We Touch our
03:30 - button here so around line 30 and what
03:33 - we want to do is we firstly once we've
03:35 - made sure that the player that is
03:37 - touching the button is in fact the owner
03:40 - of the plot we want to make sure they
03:42 - have enough
03:43 - currency so firstly we need to actually
03:46 - get the price of the item that they want
03:48 - to unlock so what we'll do is we will go
03:53 - back to our template plot which is over
03:56 - here and we'll select every single item
04:00 - and then we will click on the attribute
04:05 - in the properties panel we'll click on
04:07 - the plus we will then insert a number
04:10 - attribute and we'll call it
04:13 - price so click on
04:16 - Save and then we're going to insert a
04:18 - price value here so for example
04:22 - 300 in fact you know what we're not
04:24 - going to do that we're going to delete
04:26 - this attribute because rather than
04:28 - having the attribute set to the specific
04:30 - item I think it's better to actually set
04:32 - it to the specific button because we
04:34 - could have um multiple items and rather
04:39 - than just setting the price for each
04:41 - item I think it's better to do it per
04:43 - button so we're going to go down we're
04:45 - going to make sure the button is
04:46 - selected first so this button we're
04:49 - going to go to the properties panel and
04:51 - we're going to insert an attribute we're
04:53 - going to name it uh price and we're
04:56 - going to set the type to
04:57 - number and we're going to set this to
05:00 - let's say 50 for example okay so to
05:02 - unlock this button it will now cost 50
05:05 - cash so now we've set that up we just
05:08 - need to read it in our script so we're
05:11 - going to get the price
05:13 - value by saying local price I'm just
05:16 - going to zoom in Here Local price equals
05:19 - button K on get attribute price now
05:24 - let's just make sure there is a price
05:26 - value because there might not be a price
05:27 - value we might have forgotten to set up
05:29 - price and if we've done that um then
05:32 - we'll just let the player have the item
05:34 - for free why not but if there is a price
05:37 - then we will say uh if player. lead
05:41 - stats. C.V Val is less than price then
05:48 - we're going to put a message to the
05:51 - output a warn message which is just an
05:53 - orange message saying you cannot afford
05:57 - this item and and then we will just say
06:01 - return and that will kill the script
06:03 - where it is it won't go any further it
06:04 - will kill this event so it will stop
06:06 - here uh until we we press the button
06:09 - again so we've just checked to make sure
06:11 - the player can afford the
06:13 - item uh and if they can't if their cash
06:16 - value is less than the price we will
06:19 - return and if there is no price then
06:21 - this if statement won't run it will just
06:23 - carry on so let's apply the edits and
06:27 - just head back to the game you can just
06:29 - press the play button and it should save
06:30 - your script and I'm just going to pause
06:33 - the video whilst I walk over to the
06:36 - plot so here we are in the plot I've
06:39 - opened up the output window I'm just
06:41 - going to clear it so it's easier to see
06:42 - any new messages and I'm going to step
06:44 - on the button now we have zero cache so
06:47 - what I expect to happen is when I step
06:50 - on the button we should get some
06:51 - messages in the output saying I can't
06:54 - afford the item and the poster shouldn't
06:57 - appear there we go so it's printing out
06:59 - you cannot afford this item and it's
07:01 - printed out 11 times because it's
07:03 - registered 11 separate touches from my
07:06 - different body parts because it keeps
07:08 - touching the item but the good news is
07:11 - we can't afford it now let's just give
07:13 - ourselves some cash to make sure that
07:16 - this is actually working now whenever
07:18 - you're working with leader stats and
07:20 - cash and these sort of values if you
07:23 - want to give yourself some additional
07:24 - cash it's quite easy however you can't
07:27 - do this from your client you have to go
07:30 - into server mode because if you do it on
07:32 - the client uh it won't be registered on
07:35 - the server this is because it's
07:36 - preventing exploiters from changing
07:38 - their own cache so what you need to do
07:40 - is you need to and you can only do this
07:42 - in Roblox Studio but if you click on
07:45 - current client and you set it to server
07:47 - mode what you can then do is go to the
07:50 - Explorer click on the players tab select
07:53 - your player and then select the leader
07:55 - stats folder inside of it and then
07:57 - select the cach value and you you can
07:59 - set this to whatever value you'd like so
08:01 - for example we're going to set it to 500
08:04 - and when you've done that if you head
08:06 - back to current client by clicking on
08:09 - the current server button which is up
08:12 - here we can now see that we have got 500
08:16 - cach so this time if we step on the
08:18 - button let's see what happens I'm going
08:20 - to clear the output one more time I'm
08:22 - going to step on our button and there
08:24 - you go we were able to purchase the item
08:27 - however we haven't deducted the 50 cach
08:30 - from our 500 cash so in theory the
08:33 - player could still complete the game
08:34 - very quickly because we're not taking
08:36 - their money away so in order to remove
08:39 - the money very simple we'll just click
08:41 - on the stop button head back to the plot
08:43 - Handler and we're going to then add an
08:46 - else here to our if statement because at
08:49 - this point if the um actually what we
08:54 - could just do is outside of this if
08:58 - statement because it's is going to
08:59 - return if the player can't afford it so
09:02 - if we get to this point we know the
09:05 - player can afford the
09:07 - item so we know there's a price and we
09:10 - know that they can afford it because
09:11 - otherwise it would have returned by now
09:13 - so at this point in the code we can just
09:15 - say player. leer stats. C.V value uh
09:21 - minus equals price and when you say
09:24 - minus equals it takes the current value
09:27 - and it removes this value from it so
09:30 - this is just deducting the price from
09:32 - the leader stats so again let's click on
09:35 - the play button in the top uh left area
09:38 - of the screen and let's try this one
09:40 - more
09:41 - time so I'm going to step on the button
09:44 - let's just uh go and set our cache to
09:46 - 500 again on the
09:49 - server so Explorer leader stats cach we
09:54 - set it to 500 go back to client mode and
09:57 - let's step on the button let's see what
09:58 - happens
10:00 - there we go it took away the cash and we
10:02 - now have 450 so we've just managed to
10:05 - add leader stats which has now taken our
10:07 - Tycoon to the next level the next thing
10:09 - we need to do is we need to add some way
10:12 - of earning cash so we're going to look
10:14 - at how to make a dropper in the next
10:16 - video so I'll see you there if you
10:18 - enjoyed this one please do like share
10:20 - subscribe and I'll see you in the next
