00:00 - in this video I'm going to be showing
00:01 - you how to create a GUI shop which will
00:04 - allow players in your game to buy
00:06 - virtual items let's get started welcome
00:11 - back to another video my name's Alvin
00:12 - blocks and today it wouldn't be creating
00:14 - this GUI which will allow players to buy
00:18 - items in your game with virtual currency
00:20 - now my last video I taught you how to
00:23 - create a currency system which saves and
00:26 - which will allow you to buy stuff and
00:27 - today we're making a shop which will
00:29 - allow you to spend that currency so the
00:32 - first thing that we're going to do is
00:34 - we're going to make sure that we've got
00:35 - this GUI in our game so I've already
00:38 - made the GUI now if you want to make
00:39 - your own GUI and also want to use this
00:41 - script you're gonna have to make it look
00:43 - the same as mine okay so it's gonna have
00:46 - to have a main frame item description
00:48 - it's gonna have to look like this but if
00:50 - you want to take this GUI you just need
00:52 - to go to the description of this video
00:54 - and there'll be a link to the model you
00:56 - need to take that model then go to the
00:58 - toolbox and it should be in your models
01:01 - you just click my models you'll be able
01:03 - to drag it in and place them into these
01:06 - start at GUI so we're going to just
01:09 - script this GUI today we're going to
01:11 - Swift it so that it shows the item
01:13 - you've currently selected and then we're
01:15 - going to get some information about the
01:16 - item and show it on the right here and
01:18 - then whenever you click the buy button
01:20 - we're gonna make a request to see if you
01:22 - have enough money to buy the item and if
01:24 - you do we will give the player or you
01:27 - the the item well to get started you can
01:30 - see we have two frames we have item
01:32 - description and a list inside of this
01:35 - main frame and the list is where all of
01:37 - our items are going to go so each item
01:40 - is going to be an image button and the
01:41 - name of that image button is going to be
01:43 - the name of your gear okay so if you're
01:45 - wanting to give a sword the name of your
01:47 - image button would be sword the same as
01:49 - your tool on the item description we
01:52 - have a Buy button we also have an image
01:54 - label which is going to be the selected
01:56 - image and then inside that image label
01:58 - we've got a text label and that's going
02:00 - to display how much these selected item
02:02 - costs and this far you hear selected
02:04 - item will change whenever we click one
02:07 - of these image wear buttons so we're
02:09 - going to start by coding
02:11 - I leaderboard scripts if your game
02:13 - curtain does not have a leaderboard I'm
02:15 - just going to quickly add one to our
02:16 - game so we're going to insert a script
02:18 - into service script service and we're
02:20 - just going to want to get a a normal
02:22 - leaderboard script and it looks like
02:25 - this okay you should know how to do
02:29 - leaderboards if you have watched my
02:32 - tutorials before or you're getting into
02:33 - monetization it's very simple when a
02:36 - player enters the game we add a folder
02:38 - who leader starts and inside of that we
02:39 - put some currency called points you just
02:42 - want to change points to the name of
02:43 - your currency so if it was called cash
02:45 - you change this to cash for example but
02:47 - we're gonna keep at points for today in
02:49 - our shop and there we go that as our
02:51 - leaderboard done I'm just gonna call
02:53 - this script the server handler so we're
02:55 - gonna put all of our service scripts in
02:57 - this in this one big script here and
02:59 - we're going to get started then by
03:01 - coding our image buttons here so that we
03:05 - can show the selected year on the right
03:06 - so to do that we're gonna have to insert
03:08 - a local script into our first gun which
03:10 - is called hyper and also we also need to
03:15 - insert into the server storage a folder
03:18 - called shop items
03:22 - just like that and you need to make sure
03:24 - the s and I are capitalized for shopping
03:27 - items and inside of here is where we're
03:29 - gonna put all of the tools which the
03:31 - player can buy so for each tool which
03:33 - you're gonna sell you're gonna want an
03:35 - individual folder okay so this is what
03:37 - its gonna look like so a plate we've
03:39 - pasted this folder inside of shop items
03:42 - so whenever you've gone your item just
03:44 - copy and paste this folder and change
03:47 - hyper to the name of your tool so you
03:50 - can see the tool currently inside the
03:52 - folders called hyper and that's what
03:53 - we're gonna give the hyper gun here so
03:55 - inside the folder we've got the tool and
03:57 - we've also got a value called points
03:59 - this is how much you want this gun to
04:01 - cost if you want it to cost 300 points
04:04 - you'd want to set this value to 300 but
04:07 - we're just gonna keep at 99 for now and
04:09 - I'm also just gonna do another folder
04:12 - and which I can just copy in here called
04:15 - portal gun so we've also got a gun
04:18 - inside this folder called portal gun and
04:20 - that is gonna cost us 77 points so we've
04:24 - got our two guns now in the shop items
04:26 - folder we've got our server handler
04:28 - script we just need to add one more
04:29 - thing which is our remote functions so
04:32 - remote functions they allow you the
04:34 - client which is the player to talk to
04:37 - the server so the client can make a
04:39 - request the server and the server can
04:41 - send some information back so for
04:43 - example when we click on the image
04:46 - button here we're gonna make a request
04:48 - from the client to the server and we can
04:50 - ask how much the gun costs and then the
04:53 - server is gonna send back to us he's
04:56 - gonna send back feedback the cost of
04:58 - that item so that you can't exploit
05:00 - either game to change how much
05:02 - everything costs so let us insert a
05:05 - remote function in here and we're just
05:07 - gonna call this one get info so one of
05:10 - them is going to be for getting
05:11 - information about the tool and we're
05:13 - going to just duplicate it I'm gonna
05:15 - have another one which is called check
05:17 - sale I'm gonna get onto that a bit later
05:19 - on but check sale is going to make sure
05:21 - that the player that the transaction is
05:24 - legal and that the player is allowed to
05:26 - buy the specific tool so let's head back
05:31 - to our local script then and we're gonna
05:32 - want to do we want to define a couple or
05:34 - variable
05:35 - right now so we want to firstly define
05:38 - replicated storage so that is where the
05:40 - remote functions are so we can say local
05:43 - replicated storage equals game
05:46 - come on get serviced and then in speech
05:49 - mark so we can say replicated service
05:53 - that's replicated storage okay so this
05:58 - is a replicated story it's where all of
05:59 - our remote functions are and we can just
06:02 - quickly say replicated storage to get to
06:04 - them next we want to define the selected
06:08 - item value so we can say local selected
06:10 - item equals script doctor and got
06:15 - parents doc parent weight of child
06:18 - selected item so we're just waiting that
06:21 - selected items to be added into the game
06:23 - and this is the value that were going to
06:24 - update whenever you click on the one of
06:27 - the gears we can update the selected
06:29 - value so that when we click the Buy
06:31 - button we know what we're going to
06:33 - purchase so the next thing the next
06:36 - variable want to declare is the selected
06:39 - image label here so you can say local
06:41 - selected image equals script not parent
06:45 - dot parent dot parent the item
06:49 - description and then we can say wait for
06:53 - child in fact now we don't need we can
06:55 - say wait for child item description dot
07:00 - selected image okay and then what we're
07:04 - gonna want to do is we're going to want
07:06 - to define the selected name which is the
07:09 - text label inside of the selected image
07:10 - so we can say local selected name equals
07:15 - selected image and then we can say dot
07:19 - selected name and that is what we're
07:22 - going to update with the number of
07:24 - points of how much something costs so
07:27 - we're going to want to now have a mouse
07:29 - button one click event so this is gonna
07:31 - run whenever one of the image labels
07:33 - have been clicked and what we want to do
07:36 - is we want to make your remote function
07:37 - request now so we want to request to one
07:40 - of our remote functions to get some
07:42 - information about the tool which has
07:44 - just been click
07:45 - so we want to get the price of the tool
07:49 - so we can say local price and then we
07:51 - can make a call to our remote function
07:53 - we can invoke it by saying we can say
07:56 - replicated storage and then once they've
07:59 - got get info and then we say : invoke
08:03 - server and then we can pass we can pass
08:08 - through to the server script a parent or
08:10 - name because this is the the name of the
08:13 - tool remember I said the image buttons
08:15 - need to be called the same as the actual
08:17 - tool object this is because we are
08:20 - passing the name of the image button and
08:22 - that is going to work as the tool name
08:24 - so that when this request is seen by the
08:27 - server we can see that the player wants
08:29 - to buy this specific tool so just so
08:32 - that the both the tool name and the
08:34 - image button are the same it just makes
08:36 - it easier to know what the player wants
08:38 - to buy so we just need to make sure that
08:40 - there is actually a value that's been
08:42 - returned for the price so if price is
08:44 - not equal to nil then what we can do is
08:47 - we can update the selected image
08:49 - selected name and selected item values
08:53 - to the to link to the tool which is
08:56 - going to be bought so we can say
08:58 - selected name dot text equals price and
09:03 - then double dot and then in speech marks
09:06 - we say points with a space so we're
09:09 - concatenating the price with with points
09:12 - so it will show up how much the items
09:15 - going to cost what's wrong here
09:17 - selecting that home a spelling mistake
09:19 - up here on the variable just make sure
09:21 - that selected name and then what we're
09:24 - going to do is we're going to update the
09:25 - selected image so reflected image dot
09:29 - image equals and then we can say script
09:31 - dot parent or image because we just want
09:34 - to update this image here well to update
09:37 - that to whatever the clicked image will
09:40 - be so you can just say script or parent
09:42 - or image and then we just want to say
09:44 - selected item value equals script dot
09:48 - parent got name so we're dating this
09:51 - value here to whatever the image buttons
09:53 - called
09:54 - so if we selected hyper then this would
09:56 - be called the value of this
09:59 - during value would be hyper so when we
10:01 - click on the Buy button we can easily
10:03 - find out what is selected so that is all
10:06 - we need to do for the for the first part
10:09 - which is actually getting how much it
10:11 - costs let's just have a look and see if
10:13 - it works
10:14 - you can open the game and we have a
10:17 - small error let's have a look what it
10:19 - says it says silletti name is not a
10:21 - valid member of image label on line 4
10:24 - let's have a look
10:26 - selected name is it has a capital S
10:30 - force let's name let's try it again
10:32 - I tries to leave the errors in for you
10:35 - guys so you can see what's going wrong
10:36 - and how to fix it I so you can see we've
10:38 - got the hyper laser gun and if we click
10:40 - on it nothing happened ok
10:42 - and we can click on this one and nothing
10:45 - happens ok let's just have a look
10:47 - something might be going on here so our
10:50 - heart of course no wonder it's not
10:52 - working we haven't coded it on serviette
10:54 - whoops that was my bad so we actually
10:56 - need to code the request here to to
11:01 - actually get the information and send it
11:02 - back so no wonder it's not working
11:03 - because you haven't done that yet so
11:06 - what we can do in this service scripts
11:08 - and the server handler now what we can
11:10 - do is we can create an event for when
11:12 - the remote function is fired so to do
11:15 - that we can just say replicated storage
11:18 - I want to make a variable for that at
11:21 - the top so local replicated storage
11:24 - equals game get service replicated
11:30 - storage ok and then we just want to do
11:37 - another variable for the shop items it's
11:41 - a game and get service server storage
11:46 - because that's where the shop items held
11:48 - wait for child shop items so this is
11:54 - where the tools are held
11:59 - okay so we've got our two variables we
12:01 - just now want to get the replicated
12:04 - storage and then we say dots get info on
12:10 - server event kernel connect function and
12:15 - then we want to have an argument here
12:17 - that will be the player that requested
12:19 - this remote function and also the item
12:23 - which they have chosen and then we just
12:26 - want to return back the price of our
12:29 - item so we can say return shop items and
12:33 - then we say item in square brackets
12:35 - because that's the name of the item got
12:37 - points value so that's gonna return back
12:40 - the the points how much it costs so if
12:46 - we try out the game now and let's just
12:48 - have a look on server event it's not
12:50 - over our course yet I know what's wrong
12:52 - here so this is a common mistake what's
12:55 - happened is it's this event has been
12:57 - written as if it's a a remote event but
12:59 - it's actually a remote function which is
13:01 - a callback function so because we're
13:04 - returning something we have to actually
13:05 - write it like this so we can say dot get
13:09 - info and because it also Roemer event
13:11 - we're gonna have to say on server invoke
13:14 - equals function so on server invoke
13:19 - means that when it's been invoked so
13:20 - it's it's a remote function not over my
13:24 - event so you have to invoke it and then
13:26 - the event looks a little bit different
13:27 - because you say equals and then we just
13:29 - declare this function here so if you try
13:32 - this again I think there might be
13:34 - another error yet because we need to get
13:35 - rid of this this bracket let's run it
13:39 - again and there we go you can see it
13:41 - we've clicked the hyper laser gun is
13:44 - found how much it costs and it has
13:46 - returned back at the price so it update
13:49 - that text label and we've also updated
13:51 - the image labels image so we need now we
13:54 - need to put this local scripts into the
13:57 - other gun so whenever you're making a
13:59 - new gun make sure that this local script
14:01 - is inside it's image button and now we
14:03 - can get started with the Buy button so
14:06 - let's insert a local script into the
14:08 - Bible synth and let's get rid of this
14:10 - print hello world and
14:12 - what's happened here is we want to
14:13 - define a couple more variables so we can
14:15 - just quickly take this replicated
14:18 - storage variable to get us started from
14:20 - the other script and then we want to
14:22 - define the selected item so we're going
14:25 - to want to say local selected item
14:27 - equals script dot parent parent or
14:30 - parent weight for child selected item
14:34 - and we want to also get the well we also
14:38 - want to now have some variables for the
14:42 - button so if the purchase failed we want
14:45 - to show a / ed color so local red color
14:48 - equals and then we want to do is you
14:50 - want to select a color for this so color
14:54 - 3 so I can just say cut a 3 from RGB and
14:58 - then we can do a red value so let's just
15:01 - do 255 so that's 4 red unless add a
15:04 - little bit green and blue in so it looks
15:06 - a bit like a persimmon color and then we
15:09 - can do local green and color equals
15:12 - color 3 dot from RGB and then for this
15:17 - one the color that we're going to use is
15:19 - 2 2 3 4 1 1 1 so it's mainly a green
15:24 - color just to show that the purchase was
15:26 - a success so now that we've done that
15:29 - the next variable we want to create is a
15:31 - time delay which is going to be 2
15:34 - seconds so when they click the button
15:36 - and it says purchase failed or put your
15:38 - success there'll be a 2 second delay
15:40 - before it goes back to saying bye
15:43 - so we want to do is we also want to just
15:45 - define another variable called success
15:47 - and you'll see why we're doing this in a
15:49 - moment but this is just so if we can
15:53 - tell whether the purchase will success
15:56 - or not and then we'll allow them to to
15:58 - buy the item so we're going to want to
16:01 - insert a mouse button click event like
16:03 - this and we want to make a remote
16:06 - function request again okay so we want
16:12 - to set success to false for now whoops
16:17 - spelt it wrong so Express because we
16:19 - don't know whether it's gone right or
16:21 - wrong but if it did go all right when we
16:23 - get the request back we
16:25 - updates the success value back to true
16:27 - so we can say if selected a voucher
16:30 - selected item value is not equal to nil
16:36 - then we can make a request to the remote
16:42 - function so if there is a selected item
16:44 - then we can actually request to make a
16:47 - transaction so we can say success equals
16:51 - replicator storage check sale invokes
16:55 - server
16:57 - and let's add in the other bracket and
17:03 - let's give Li selected
17:05 - let's pass through the selected I can't
17:07 - talk today selected item value we want
17:10 - to pass that through and what happen is
17:14 - we're gonna script it so that the you
17:17 - remote function the server script will
17:19 - either return true or false so it would
17:22 - either be a success or it won't so we
17:24 - can check to see if the success then we
17:29 - can have an else here and in this block
17:31 - of code we're just gonna say script a
17:34 - parent of text equals success and what
17:38 - do we say purchased we can wait two
17:41 - seconds
17:42 - in fact we wait the time delay because
17:45 - that's what we've defined as a variable
17:46 - and then with no script or parent text
17:49 - equals
17:52 - by just like that and then we just want
17:55 - to do the same thing in the house doing
17:58 - in case something did go wrong we want
18:01 - to say purchase failed and we want to
18:04 - wait the time delay and we're also just
18:06 - gonna put it back to buy but we also
18:08 - want to change the text color here so we
18:10 - want to say script or parent text color
18:12 - 3 whose green color and let's just put
18:19 - that over here as well in the success
18:23 - just so that if it was I clicked while
18:26 - it was red it goes back to green and
18:28 - then we can just make it red here for
18:30 - when it's a purchase failed 3 equals red
18:34 - color just like that so there we go we
18:36 - have got our Buy button complete all
18:39 - that's left is for us to code the check
18:42 - sale server-side so we can do the same
18:46 - thing here we can copy this this one
18:49 - server invoke and just paste it and
18:51 - change get info to check sale because
18:54 - we've got the same arguments of player
18:56 - and item and then what we're gonna do
18:58 - we're just gonna get rid of this return
19:00 - we're gonna make it a bit bigger and
19:02 - we're gonna want to say local price
19:05 - equals shop items so we're getting the
19:09 - price again so item in square brackets
19:11 - that's the name got points got value and
19:14 - then we can say if player leader stats
19:17 - got points value is greater than or
19:21 - equal to the price then we've got
19:24 - another if statement here and inside of
19:28 - here we're gonna want to have an else
19:29 - where we can return false because if
19:33 - they haven't got enough money
19:34 - we know that the purchase is gonna be a
19:36 - fail so we want to return success as
19:39 - false otherwise we're gonna return true
19:41 - and here's where we want to handle the
19:45 - we want to deduct the points from their
19:48 - balance so we can say player dot lead
19:50 - you start stop points dot value equals
19:52 - player that leader starts two points to
19:53 - allow you take away price this deducting
19:56 - it from their account balance and then
19:58 - what we're gonna do is we're gonna say
20:00 - local gear which is the tool equal shop
20:03 - items
20:04 - and then square brackets item because
20:06 - that's the folder then we want to say
20:09 - item again because inside the folder
20:11 - there will be an object with the same
20:13 - name which is the tool and I want to
20:15 - clone up and we want to put this in the
20:20 - players starter gear so that they get it
20:25 - when they reset and we also just want to
20:27 - clone it once more so that we can put it
20:29 - inside of their backpack
20:34 - so the backpack is where it shows up on
20:36 - your inventory you can select it but if
20:40 - you reset the backpack gets cleared but
20:42 - if it's in your starter gear as well
20:43 - then it's gonna go back to your backpack
20:47 - when you reset but it doesn't save I do
20:50 - I'm gonna have a weapon saving tutorial
20:53 - out very soon so make sure to watch out
20:56 - for that on my channel but apart from
20:58 - that I think that is everything let's go
21:00 - and test this out and make sure that it
21:02 - works so there might be a couple of
21:03 - errors so we'll sleep so we're gonna
21:06 - click on the items you can see the
21:08 - updates with a selected item click on
21:10 - buy you can see we have been given the
21:13 - tool you might not be able to see it
21:15 - because the GUI is in the way just try
21:17 - and buy another item being see we can
21:20 - buy as many items so you want don't
21:21 - worry about the error it's just an error
21:23 - in the tool I didn't make the tool but
21:26 - you can see we can shoot you can do
21:27 - anything you can update this with your
21:29 - custom weapons and it will still give
21:31 - you the weapon as long as you change the
21:33 - names of everything but just to finish
21:36 - off let's just add a little toggle
21:38 - button which will allow us to open and
21:40 - close the GUI so to do this we're just
21:43 - gonna wait for it to come back
21:45 - I know roblox studio has been having a
21:47 - couple of loading issues recently but
21:49 - that's alright and we're gonna insert a
21:51 - text button I'm just gonna quickly drag
21:54 - it over here it's not gonna be the best
21:56 - button and we're gonna change the style
21:58 - I'm gonna make the text white I'm gonna
22:02 - make it text scaled and just say shop
22:05 - and inside of here we now have a local
22:07 - script and then we can say mouse button
22:12 - one click event so swept up parent or
22:14 - muss one button one click so when it's
22:16 - been clicked when you say script doctor
22:18 - and doctor in mainframe doc visible
22:22 - equals not
22:23 - script or parent or parent up mainframe
22:26 - not visible so this will just change the
22:28 - main frames visibility to the opposite
22:32 - of what it currently is so it's kind of
22:33 - like a toggle so if it's on it'll go off
22:35 - if it's off its off it'll go it will
22:37 - come back on so there we go we've got a
22:39 - little toggle you can see you can close
22:41 - it and we can reopen it and we can buy
22:42 - things
22:44 - I think if we reset you should be able
22:46 - to keep your items hopefully because
22:49 - it's in the starter gear yep you get to
22:53 - keep the item and I think that is
22:56 - everything we just want to actually
22:58 - change this to we want to make this GUI
23:03 - I want to make the mainframe invisible
23:06 - for now so that it can be opened it
23:08 - doesn't open up straightaway but there
23:09 - we go that's the end of this tutorial on
