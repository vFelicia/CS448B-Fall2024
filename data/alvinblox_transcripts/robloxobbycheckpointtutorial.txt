00:00 - in this video I'm gonna show you how you
00:01 - can create your own OB checkpoint system
00:03 - in roblox studio so that when you reach
00:05 - the next stage in an obstacle course
00:08 - your checkpoint will be saved and so
00:10 - that if you die you won't get teleported
00:13 - back to the start you will only get
00:14 - teleported back to your most recent
00:16 - checkpoint now my name is Alvin blocks
00:19 - I teach loads of people like you how to
00:20 - make their own road blocks and games and
00:22 - earn lots of robots from them so if
00:24 - you're interested in that type of video
00:26 - content then do consider subscribing and
00:28 - hitting the bell so you don't miss out
00:30 - on future videos really does help my
00:32 - channel shout-out to Wolfie games who
00:34 - suggested the idea for this video in the
00:36 - last vid let's get straight into it
00:39 - firstly we're going to insert a folder
00:40 - into the workspace I'm going to call
00:42 - this folder checkpoints next we're going
00:47 - to insert the team's service so he can't
00:50 - see teams listed in the Explorer you're
00:53 - gonna need to click on model and then
00:54 - service but you should see the team's
00:57 - folder so click on the + next to it and
00:59 - insert a team now for each stage in your
01:03 - obby you're going to want to create a
01:04 - new team so the first team is going to
01:07 - be called stage 1 ok and you're going to
01:10 - want to set Auto assignable to a false
01:12 - so uncheck that Auto assignable box and
01:15 - you can also give a team color ok now
01:18 - you're also going to for each stage
01:21 - you're going to want to insert a spawn
01:23 - so click on the model tab and click on
01:25 - spawn this will insert a spawn location
01:28 - now it's really important that you set
01:31 - the name of the spawn location to the
01:33 - same as the stage name in teams so for
01:37 - stage 1 this born will be called stage 1
01:40 - because we've got a stage one team 4 as
01:43 - well we're going to put it inside with
01:44 - the checkpoints folder they all need to
01:46 - be inside the checkpoints folder but
01:48 - also what's most important is that you
01:50 - go into the properties window and you
01:52 - can open that by clicking on view
01:53 - properties and if you scroll down here
01:57 - to the team section you want to make
01:59 - sure that allow team change on touch is
02:01 - checked you want that to be true but
02:03 - change neutral to be unchecked ok and
02:06 - you don't need to bother about the team
02:08 - color we'll get to that later on so what
02:11 - we should have
02:12 - is a spawn location and a team both with
02:16 - the same name for each stage so once
02:19 - you've done that you can copy the spawn
02:22 - location I'm gonna duplicate it by right
02:25 - clicking and clicking duplicate and that
02:27 - will create a clone of it I'm going to
02:28 - drag this one all the way over to my
02:30 - next stage okay and now that it's there
02:34 - I need to rename it because we're no
02:35 - longer at stage one so we'll change this
02:38 - one to be called stage two so we should
02:40 - have a spawn location called stage one
02:42 - over there and one called spawn location
02:44 - over here now you need to do the same
02:46 - thing for the team's we're gonna insert
02:48 - a another team in fact I'm gonna right
02:51 - click and duplicate this team I'm going
02:53 - to call it stage two and I'm going to
02:56 - change the team color to something
02:58 - different it has to be a different color
03:00 - you can distinguish them so I'm gonna
03:02 - keep doing this for all the other stages
03:04 - so duplicate the spawn location drag it
03:08 - over to the next stage I know we've got
03:10 - two stages in one here but that's
03:12 - because there's no space over here that
03:14 - doesn't matter I'm gonna call this spawn
03:16 - location stage 3 but because we need a
03:19 - team to go with it I'm gonna duplicate
03:22 - one of these teams
03:22 - rename it to stage 3 and choose a
03:25 - different team color now really
03:27 - important that auto assignable is set to
03:29 - false here it must be false and also
03:32 - very critical that each spawn location
03:34 - again allow team change on touch is
03:37 - checked that's so that when you step on
03:39 - a new spawn you you your checkpoint will
03:42 - get saved so you can spawn back at that
03:44 - checkpoint and the neutral is false and
03:47 - that just stops people from skipping to
03:50 - the end and being assigned to a random
03:53 - spawn we don't want that so make sure
03:55 - it's false and you can leave the team
03:57 - color as well that's important so just
03:58 - leave as is okay so I'm going to do one
04:01 - more now for the final stage you can
04:03 - also press control D to duplicate by the
04:05 - way change to stage four I'm gonna
04:08 - duplicate another team if you have more
04:10 - stages just keep on doing this for for
04:14 - all the different stages so there we go
04:16 - we've got stage one two three four and
04:18 - for each team there was a spawning
04:19 - location to go with it excellent so now
04:22 - we can begin the coding
04:25 - so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
04:27 - click on the plus on service crypt
04:29 - service and I'm going to insert a script
04:31 - you need to do that as well
04:33 - now once the scripts in the game I'm
04:35 - gonna rename it to checkpoint scripts
04:40 - just so that we know that's what it's
04:42 - going to be managing it's going to be
04:43 - doing the checkpoints but you can name
04:45 - it whatever you like now in the script
04:48 - firstly I'm going to write a variable
04:50 - and that variable is going to be a
04:52 - reference to this folder and it's going
04:55 - to get all of the spawns which are
04:57 - stored inside this folder and it's going
04:59 - to return it to us in table form now
05:01 - table form is kind of like a list and
05:03 - it's going to be a list of all of the
05:05 - spawn all of the stage spawns in that
05:07 - folder so I'm then going to write a for
05:11 - loop and what this for loop will do is
05:13 - it will loop through every single spawn
05:15 - checkpoint in that folder in that list
05:18 - table that we've just gotten from this
05:20 - variable that's why we've got that
05:21 - variable in here because that's what
05:23 - we're looping through so basically what
05:25 - it's going to do is any code inside this
05:27 - for loop will run for every single
05:30 - checkpoint so currently we haven't set
05:34 - the team color of the spawn locations
05:37 - yet and we've done that for a reason
05:38 - because for each spawn location you need
05:41 - to set the team color to the same color
05:44 - as that team okay but because that can
05:50 - get you know quite boring having to do
05:53 - that over and over and over again for
05:54 - each spawn what we can do is we can use
05:57 - a script that will do it for us and
05:58 - that's why it's so important that you
06:00 - use a different team color for each
06:02 - stage so you don't want to have two
06:05 - teams with the same color okay so what
06:09 - we'll do is we will say checkpoint dot
06:13 - team color equals and then we can get
06:17 - the team object out of the team's
06:20 - service by saying game dot team's
06:22 - Kurland find first child and that's
06:25 - going to find the first team object in
06:28 - there with the name that we give so the
06:30 - name that we wanted given these brackets
06:32 - is going to be the name of the
06:33 - checkpoint because if you remember we've
06:36 - named the checkpoint the same thing as
06:38 - team so we know that the team name is
06:41 - going to be the same as the checkpoints
06:43 - name so he can just get the team by
06:44 - saying game teams find first child and
06:47 - then the checkpoint name goes in here oh
06:49 - yes when you say dot team color on the
06:51 - end here because we're getting the team
06:53 - color property and what that will do is
06:56 - it will update the team color for every
06:58 - single spawn location and when you do
07:00 - that when we're setting the team color
07:02 - of the spawn location checkpoint we are
07:04 - connecting it to that team so that when
07:06 - you step on it it's gonna change your
07:08 - team color to look at that team so when
07:12 - you step on stage three and the team
07:14 - color will be set to really blue that's
07:18 - a way of connecting them so that your
07:19 - team can be set to stage three and when
07:22 - you die you will go back to the spawn of
07:24 - stage three and now each spawn location
07:28 - should be linked to that spawn it's that
07:31 - team sorry let's have a look in the
07:33 - properties window you can see yep the
07:35 - team color for this spawn is bright red
07:38 - if we go into team's stage one you can
07:40 - see it's also bright red so stage two is
07:42 - lime green let's look at stage two the
07:46 - spawn location that's also a lime green
07:47 - so they're now connected and that means
07:49 - when I get to the next stage and I step
07:52 - on that stages spawn location because
07:55 - the allow team change on touch property
07:57 - is true look at the leaderboard it's
07:59 - gonna change me to step two to stage two
08:02 - because stage two shares the same color
08:04 - as the team color of this spawn so when
08:06 - I stepped on it it would change my team
08:09 - color and if we now were to die we
08:12 - wouldn't want to restart all the way at
08:14 - the beginning it would teleport us to
08:16 - that spawn the spawn of the the links
08:19 - born of that team and it's linked
08:22 - because it's connected through team
08:23 - color
08:24 - so we've respawn back at our checkpoint
08:26 - how cool is that
08:27 - okay now what you can also do in the
08:30 - checkpoint scripts is do the same thing
08:32 - but with the color so you could say
08:34 - checkpoint brick color equals and just
08:39 - put the same line of code here because
08:41 - it's still the same color of the team
08:42 - and that should change the color of the
08:44 - checkpoint let's have a look there we go
08:47 - so now we've got the different colors
08:49 - and if you want to update the color for
08:51 - each spawn
08:52 - don't change it on the spawn location
08:55 - brick change it in the teens in the
08:59 - team's service he changed the team
09:01 - object so if I change the first one to
09:03 - electric blue I haven't changed the
09:04 - spawn location and that's because it's
09:06 - automatically going to update so it
09:08 - saves us all the work and now if I need
09:10 - to add more stages I just need to add a
09:12 - new spawn location change its name and
09:14 - add a new team and the work has been
09:16 - done for me so you can now put in as
09:18 - many spawns and stages as you like and
09:21 - it will work seamlessly now the final
09:25 - thing that we have to do is we need to
09:26 - set the players team due stage one when
09:29 - they begin because right now we're just
09:30 - spawning above the first sport and
09:33 - that's because it's in the center of the
09:34 - map so what we're going to do is when
09:36 - I'm making new script we're going to
09:37 - duplicate the checkpoint script and when
09:39 - I call this script player team and what
09:42 - we're gonna do is we're gonna say game
09:44 - dot players dot player added this is an
09:46 - event and it will run whenever a new
09:48 - player joins the game so game dot
09:51 - players the player added connect
09:52 - function player and then we can save
09:54 - player dot team equals game dot team's
09:58 - dot Stage one and that will set the
10:01 - players team to stage one as soon as
10:04 - they join the game if we have a look
10:05 - here before we even step on the spawn
10:07 - our team is already stage one so that's
10:10 - brilliant ok so that's the end of this
10:13 - video and I've shown you how to create a
10:15 - or B checkpoint system please do like
10:17 - the video and subscribe to my youtube
10:18 - channel if it has helped you and share
10:20 - it with a friend as well who you think
10:22 - will be interested in learning this
10:24 - because it didn't take long did it under
10:26 - 10 minutes and in the next video I will
10:29 - show you how to save a player's team
10:31 - because you don't want a player to leave
10:32 - the game and then rejoin later on and
10:34 - have to complete the obby all over again
10:36 - so we're gonna learn how to save their
10:39 - checkpoint and load it so that they
10:41 - spawn back where they left off so make
10:43 - sure you're subscribed and you've got
10:44 - the notifications on my channel so you
10:45 - don't miss that you really don't want to
10:47 - miss that one and I'll see you in the
10:49 - next video you can go to the next video
