00:00 - in this video I'm going to show you how
00:02 - to change the color property of objects
00:06 - in Roblox studio so for example if you
00:08 - wanted to change the color of a part
00:11 - such as the base plate or even some kind
00:14 - of GUI object such as the background
00:17 - color of a frame I'm going to show you
00:19 - how to do that so very very simple and
00:22 - all you need to do is when you've got
00:24 - your color property for example we'll
00:26 - just say game. workspace do spawn
00:29 - location you say color and then you have
00:32 - to give a color three so color three is
00:35 - just a data type it's a way of giving
00:38 - three numbers which will form a color
00:41 - value and what you'd usually say is
00:44 - color 3. new but this is confusing
00:47 - because it won't let you use an RGB
00:50 - value well it will but it's not the
00:51 - typical 0-255 values that you expect so
00:56 - instead of saying color 3. new say color
00:59 - 3
01:00 - do from RGB and then you can put your
01:03 - three RGB values in here and even better
01:07 - you can click on this little color wheel
01:09 - which appears underneath the numbers and
01:11 - this will open up the Color Picker and
01:13 - when you choose a color press okay it
01:16 - will automatically update the numbers
01:18 - for you but it's not just color 3. from
01:21 - RGB you can also use color 3 Dot from
01:25 - hex and you can paste in your hex string
01:29 - which would look something like
01:32 - this or you can also do from HSV which
01:36 - is Hue saturation and and value but
01:39 - typically you will just use from RGB
01:42 - because it's super convenient lets you
01:44 - use the Color Picker and it's the wide
01:46 - widely accepted standard you know you
01:48 - click on the properties Tab and you can
01:49 - see that the color gives you three
01:51 - values they are your RGB values so that
01:54 - is how you change the color of an object
01:57 - and let's just have a look here there
01:59 - you go it's changed to our color now one
02:02 - thing to note is you cannot save color 3
02:04 - values into a data store so what you'd
02:07 - have to do is instead store these three
02:09 - values you could store them in a table
02:11 - that's fine but what you'll need to do
02:13 - is you will need to uh convert them back
02:16 - to a color
02:17 - three uh that's just something you'll
02:19 - need to know but for the most part that
02:21 - is how you change the colors of things
02:24 - using Color 3 there's also brick color
02:27 - as well that's the old style way of
02:29 - changing colors but the way that works
02:31 - is instead of saying spawn location.
02:33 - color you say brick color with a capital
02:36 - B and C and you set it to Brick color.
02:40 - New and then in a string in speech marks
02:43 - you will put the name of the color but
02:45 - to find the name of the color you'll use
02:47 - this little palette it's uh it provides
02:49 - you these colors but you have to keep
02:52 - them case sensitive so for example if we
02:54 - say uh bright red it's got a capital b
02:57 - and a lowercase R so we have to type it
03:00 - exactly as it is just like that and that
03:03 - will also let you change the color but
03:06 - these days really all you need to use is
03:09 - color 3 and when it comes to uh guis
03:13 - things like frames text labels text
03:15 - buttons you always use the color three
03:19 - values however in a GUI you'll commonly
03:22 - see if we just show you that they have
03:25 - background color 3 border color 3 text
03:28 - color 3 they all end in three so just be
03:30 - careful of that when you're writing the
03:32 - property but that is how you change
03:35 - colors using color 3. from RGB
