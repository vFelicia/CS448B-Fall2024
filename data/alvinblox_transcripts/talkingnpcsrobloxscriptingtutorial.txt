00:00 - okay today we're going to look at how to
00:02 - make objects talk in Roblox and that is
00:05 - by giving them an overhead GUI bubble so
00:09 - we'll just insert a part here and I'm
00:11 - going to run the game just to have this
00:13 - in a live running server and I'm going
00:15 - to show you how to add a chat bubble
00:18 - above the head of this uh part so let's
00:22 - just create a script and have it to the
00:24 - side here you don't have to create this
00:26 - script I'm just going to do it for
00:27 - demonstration first thing you want to do
00:29 - is you want to get a service called chat
00:32 - so game get service chat just like this
00:35 - and then you say chat
00:37 - colon uh where is it I've forgotten what
00:40 - it's called chat I think it might just
00:43 - be chat yeah it's called chat okay so
00:46 - this function of the chat service called
00:48 - chat you supply the specific part which
00:52 - you want the bubble to appear above and
00:55 - then secondly you provide a message like
00:58 - hello and what we'll do is we will just
01:01 - run this
01:03 - script by saying reload script uh reload
01:07 - is that working no it's not working
01:09 - let's put it in the command bar instead
01:11 - down here okay still not working why is
01:15 - that okay I don't know why that wasn't
01:18 - working in run mode it might be because
01:20 - things like text bubbles don't get
01:21 - rendered but if I go into play here and
01:23 - I run this code in the command bar you
01:25 - can see it is inserting chat bubbles now
01:28 - Roblox will say when you try and use
01:31 - this service the chat service that it is
01:33 - technically deprecated which means
01:36 - you're not supposed to use it in new
01:37 - work because it's so old and yes that is
01:41 - true but I don't see a time where
01:43 - they're going to completely get rid of
01:45 - this uh function because it would break
01:47 - a ton of games that use it so use it at
01:50 - your peril I still use it in my games
01:53 - it's completely up to you whether you
01:55 - use it however there is an
01:57 - alternative and that alternative is text
02:01 - chat service display bubble and it does
02:04 - the exact same thing okay we go into
02:07 - play
02:07 - here and we run this code again in the
02:10 - command bar you can hardly tell the
02:13 - difference uh the only real difference I
02:16 - suppose is it uses the new text chat
02:18 - service so if you wanted to you could
02:21 - have a little bit more control over the
02:23 - font the text color whatever um but this
02:27 - is probably the best way to do it
02:29 - because you then have access to more
02:31 - events and things uh such as bubble
02:34 - displayed which will fire when a text
02:37 - bubble appears uh however if you just
02:40 - want to send a message then really it's
02:42 - not going to make much of a difference
02:44 - so that is how you do it for a part and
02:47 - same thing goes with NPCs really there's
02:49 - not much difference we'll just insert a
02:52 - rig of my avatar and uh we'll go back
02:57 - into the script we'll just do a task. we
02:59 - here of about 3 seconds we'll say
03:01 - Gameworks space.
03:04 - rig and that's it really click on play
03:08 - here wait 3 seconds and oh sorry it
03:11 - needs to be a part so we'll just say
03:13 - rig. head and play
03:16 - here and you'll see that my character is
03:21 - not displaying the bubble for some
03:23 - reason let's have a look and see why
03:25 - that might
03:27 - be okay so I did some investig ation and
03:30 - it turns out the main difference between
03:33 - text chat service and chat service is
03:35 - that you can only use text chat service
03:37 - display bubble on the client so if I was
03:40 - to call this from the
03:42 - server you don't see anything and the
03:44 - difference with the normal chat service
03:46 - that we showed you at the start of the
03:48 - video is well let me show you here it
03:53 - works on the
03:55 - server okay I posted a message from the
03:57 - server saying hello from the server
04:00 - and it appears on the clients so this
04:03 - means if you were to send a message from
04:06 - the server using text chat service it
04:08 - wouldn't work because you can only use
04:10 - it on the client so you'd have to use a
04:12 - remote event which opens a complete
04:14 - other uh can of worms because that's a
04:17 - separate issue that you'd probably need
04:18 - to learn
04:20 - however like I say if you just want the
04:23 - easy method use chat service right you
04:25 - use the the chat uh chat that we showed
04:27 - you at the beginning if that doesn't
04:29 - work anymore then you'll have to use a
04:31 - remote event which would look something
04:33 - like this so you insert a remote event
04:35 - we'll just call it chat and we'll say
04:37 - game. replicated storage. chat fire all
04:42 - clients and we'll just put hey from the
04:46 - server and we'll also pass the
04:49 - rig like this and the rig's head sorry
04:53 - and then on the client in a local script
04:56 - you would say game replicated storage do
04:59 - CH on client event connect function part
05:05 - message text chat service display bubble
05:09 - part message like this and we'll just
05:13 - get the text chat
05:15 - service and we'll just do a task. wait 3
05:18 - seconds on the server to so that we can
05:21 - actually see this going
05:23 - through and there we go so we've been
05:25 - able to send the message from the server
05:27 - a little bit more work there cuz we have
05:28 - to use a remote event
05:30 - uh but there you go that is the
05:33 - difference between chat and text chat
05:35 - Service uh tldr is essentially text chat
05:38 - service is the newer version but it only
05:40 - works on the
05:42 - clients and the the Legacy chat service
05:46 - works on the server you can send
05:48 - messages from the server and it will
05:50 - just appear to all clients now one last
05:53 - thing uh the reason why text chat
05:57 - service it doesn't work on the server uh
06:01 - it's because they want you to make sure
06:04 - that text gets filtered right um if you
06:10 - wanted to send a message from the
06:12 - client to all servers we would have to
06:16 - filter that string on the server so if
06:18 - you're not sending messages from the
06:20 - server for example if you had I know
06:23 - this is getting a little bit confusing
06:24 - and complicated but let's say you wanted
06:26 - players to be able to set messages for
06:28 - NPCs you would firstly have to process
06:31 - that on the server use the filter string
06:34 - async as text filtering service to
06:37 - filter that before you then send it to
06:39 - all the clients um so just something to
06:42 - be aware of there so that is everything
06:44 - you need to know about how to make NPC

06:50 - see you in the next video thanks for
