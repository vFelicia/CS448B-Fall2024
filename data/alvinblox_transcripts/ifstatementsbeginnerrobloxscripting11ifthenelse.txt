00:00 - hello and welcome to episode 11 in my
00:02 - scripting series today we're going to be
00:03 - looking at if statements so if
00:06 - statements they allow you to run code
00:09 - depending on whether something has
00:12 - happened or if something or a condition
00:15 - or something that we tell the script is
00:17 - true or not so for example if the time
00:21 - of day is nighttime then we can turn our
00:25 - light on or if two plus two is equal to
00:30 - four which it is then we can do
00:32 - something so firstly when we're doing an
00:35 - if statement we have to say if and that
00:38 - basically tells the script that this is
00:40 - an if statement and we're checking
00:41 - something so an if statement is made up
00:44 - of an if-then and an end so we have if
00:49 - and then we have something that goes in
00:51 - between if and then and if whatever we
00:55 - put here is correct if it's true if you
00:59 - know if it's if it's right then it's
01:02 - going to run whatever code goes in
01:05 - between these two lines so if I was to
01:08 - print out correct and I was to put
01:12 - something in here obviously it has to be
01:13 - right this is a condition it has to be
01:15 - something that we can check so for
01:18 - example we could check to see if a
01:21 - number add another number was equal to
01:25 - four so if to add two is equal to four
01:29 - then it's gonna print correct now let's
01:32 - run this script and see what happens
01:35 - well there we go prints correct
01:37 - so what's what it's done is it's
01:39 - basically said right is to add to equal
01:41 - to four while two plus two is equal to
01:44 - four so this condition is true and
01:47 - whenever the condition is true then it's
01:50 - always going to print correct now if I
01:54 - put false then it's not gonna say
01:59 - correct because the condition that we've
02:01 - put in here is false now I know we've
02:04 - written false but basically when an if
02:06 - statement sees a condition which is
02:09 - false then it won't run the code inside
02:12 - of it
02:13 - when it sees true then it will run the
02:16 - code inside of it but what we did we
02:19 - didn't say whether 2+2 was 4 or not we
02:23 - didn't say that was true so what happens
02:25 - is when you put a condition in here like
02:27 - 2 plus 2 is equal to 4 it's gonna work
02:29 - it out and then if it is correct then
02:32 - it's either gonna be true or it's gonna
02:35 - be false when it's false it doesn't run
02:38 - anything inside of the if statement when
02:39 - it's true it does so our conditions can
02:42 - either be true or they can be false and
02:45 - depending on whether they are it's
02:47 - whether the code will run or not so
02:49 - these conditions you think about them as
02:51 - like the scripts checks them and they're
02:55 - either true or false and if they're
02:57 - false it won't run if it's true it will
02:59 - run the code inside of the if statement
03:01 - so what do we want to check well you can
03:05 - check properties of things so we could
03:08 - check to see if the time of day was
03:09 - night time
03:10 - so let's look in the lighting the
03:12 - lighting has a property called time of
03:14 - day and if we were to say if game
03:16 - lighting dots time of day and because
03:24 - it's a string a time of day the data
03:26 - types are string then or by the way when
03:29 - we're checking something and we want to
03:31 - say if something is equal to something
03:33 - we always have to do a double equals and
03:36 - this is because when we're setting a
03:39 - value if we were to set the time of day
03:42 - we would say equals and then we'd put
03:45 - the time of day in there so we're
03:47 - setting time of day to be 12 o'clock
03:50 - but if we were to have one equals the
03:53 - script would think that we're setting
03:55 - the value to 12 o'clock but we actually
03:59 - just want to check it we want to see if
04:01 - it's equal to something we want to see
04:02 - if it's equal to 12 o'clock so because
04:05 - it thinks we want to set it to 12
04:07 - o'clock we have to do a double equals so
04:09 - whenever you're in leaf statement just
04:10 - make sure that you have two equal signs
04:12 - when you check in something that's just
04:13 - the way it is because it's not going to
04:15 - work if you just have one so make sure
04:16 - you have two in there so we're gonna do
04:18 - a string we're gonna do 12 o'clock
04:20 - because it's not a number at time of day
04:22 - time of days of string because it's got
04:24 - these are colons in the middle
04:25 - it didn't have the colon then it
04:27 - wouldn't be but that's just the way it's
04:28 - formatted so it's a string so we can say
04:30 - if time of day is at 12 o'clock then
04:33 - make it correct the work then prints out
04:36 - correct so if we clear the output and
04:39 - run the game it's currently set to a 14
04:41 - or 2 o'clock so it's not going to print
04:44 - correct but if we were to change the
04:47 - time of day to 12 o'clock and run it
04:54 - again you can see it prints correct now
04:57 - this if statement is only gonna run once
05:00 - it's only gonna run once the game starts
05:03 - and then if you change the lighting
05:04 - later on it won't it won't update so if
05:08 - we start it off and reset and the time
05:10 - is currently at 3 o'clock and we change
05:13 - it to 12 o'clock you can see it doesn't
05:16 - print out correct that's because the if
05:18 - statement has already run it says run
05:20 - once and it's it's it's not printed
05:23 - correct because the time of day wasn't
05:24 - 12 o'clock when we started the game it
05:27 - was 15 or 3 o'clock so only runs once
05:31 - and then once it's already run it'll
05:33 - just move on it won't it won't keep
05:35 - checking like an event keeps running
05:38 - won't do that it will only keep it will
05:40 - only keep checking if you put it in a
05:42 - while loop and I'm not sure if we've
05:44 - done a while loop yet but a while loop
05:46 - will just keep repeating any code inside
05:49 - of it like this if we were to do this
05:51 - every one second in our while loop it
05:54 - would constantly check and now if we
05:56 - change the time of day to 12 o'clock
05:58 - every one second it will keep checking
06:00 - and there we go
06:01 - it's correct because the time is now 12
06:04 - o'clock if you change you back to 15 or
06:06 - 14 or 0-0 you can see it's it's it just
06:11 - say correct still but you can see it's
06:13 - not increasing over here where it goes
06:15 - times 7 is just because if we want to
06:17 - clear the output you see it still
06:19 - wouldn't print the message so that is
06:22 - what an if statement is really you say
06:24 - if you put a condition in there if the
06:27 - condition is right then it will run the
06:28 - code inside of it if it's not right it
06:31 - won't so let's get rid of this ifs take
06:33 - this wire loop here now I'm gonna show
06:36 - you another thing here
06:38 - going to show you else now if you say
06:39 - else if this condition is false then it
06:44 - will immediately run the whatever's in
06:46 - between the elves and the end so if you
06:49 - were to print incorrect what would
06:51 - happen is it would say well let's this
06:53 - is the time of day twelve o'clock I know
06:55 - it's not as three o'clock so it's not
06:57 - gonna print correct it's gonna go else
06:59 - because if if the time date isn't twelve
07:01 - o'clock if our conditions false this is
07:03 - our backup this is what's gonna run if
07:05 - it's if it's if it's false so what will
07:08 - happen when condition is false so when
07:13 - the conditions false it will print
07:15 - incorrect and I'll just show you that it
07:17 - prints incorrect because the time of day
07:19 - is fifteen if you were to go back change
07:22 - it to 12 which is defined as in the
07:25 - script boom it prints correct so you can
07:28 - see if the condition is false then it
07:31 - will do the else it will print what I
07:34 - was in between the elves on the end if
07:35 - it's true it will print whatever is
07:37 - between the if and the elves over here
07:39 - so it will print the correct if it's
07:42 - true it will print the incorrect if it
07:44 - is false so you can apply an if
07:46 - statement to anything in your game you
07:48 - could say if the time of day is zero 0
07:56 - which is nighttime then we could set
08:00 - this light to be unable to explain the
08:03 - work space dot light dot point lights
08:05 - dot enabled equals true else game work
08:10 - space got lights got point lights got
08:12 - enabled equals false okay
08:14 - so if the time of day is midnight then
08:17 - it will turn this light on else it will
08:19 - not so currently it is not a zero zero
08:22 - all we have an error my bad about work
08:24 - space wrong give me a second there we go
08:27 - I say if it is midnight it will turn on
08:31 - obviously it isn't midnight right now
08:33 - it's 12 o'clock so let's go out let's
08:35 - change it to midnight there we go and
08:38 - let's run the code and boom the light
08:41 - turns on now if we were to put this in a
08:43 - while loop so it constantly checks even
08:45 - after it's we run the first time let's
08:48 - do a while wait
08:49 - in there so it just updates every nought
08:53 - point three seconds and again you don't
08:57 - need to know about while loops yet
08:59 - because we'll go over them in a future
09:00 - video if I change it to 2:15 it turns
09:03 - off if I change it to twelve still
09:07 - doesn't work if I change it to 11:59 and
09:10 - 59 it still doesn't work I change it to
09:12 - zero boom it turns on turn it to zero
09:15 - zero one turns off so you can see that
09:19 - an if statement the condition is if it's
09:22 - equal to midnight so if it's one minute
09:26 - past midnight won't work so an if
09:29 - statement your condition determines
09:31 - whether something happens or not so you
09:33 - can see if the condition is true if it
09:35 - is midnight the light will turn on else
09:37 - if it isn't it will turn off so you can
09:39 - see what if statements are they allow
09:42 - you to enter a condition if the
09:44 - condition is true then it will run one
09:46 - set of code if not you can get it to run
09:48 - a different set of codes so very brief
09:50 - introduction into if statements there we
09:52 - will be going more in depth on them
09:54 - later on but you just need to know how
09:55 - they work you can also do things such as
09:57 - if a variable is greater than a number
10:03 - so let's say my var is equal to 20 my
10:09 - var is 20 so it's greater than 10 so the
10:12 - light should turn on there we go but if
10:14 - I was to set my VAR to 2 which is less
10:16 - than 10 it wouldn't work so you can have
10:19 - loads of different conditions you could
10:21 - have my VAR sets of hello and then you
10:23 - could say if my bar is equal to hello
10:26 - then it will run the true we will run
10:31 - the turning on other light because it's
10:32 - true but if you said if it's by while
10:34 - we've set it to say hello it won't run
10:36 - so lots of different use cases for if
10:38 - statements you may be thinking well a
10:40 - bit pointless at the minute because I've
10:41 - got nothing to check but when you make
10:43 - again there are loads of things that you
10:44 - need to check you'll need to check how
10:45 - many players are left in your game
10:47 - because you might want to end the round
10:49 - if there's only one person remaining
10:50 - loads of uses and it's a thing that you
10:53 - really need to know so very brief
10:54 - introduction into if statements we'll be
10:56 - doing more of them in future videos so
