00:00 - in this video I'm gonna be showing you
00:02 - how to convert a GUI which allows you to
00:05 - spawn parts into the game to
00:08 - non-experimental mode so that your game
00:10 - can be compatible with filtering enabled
00:12 - let's get started
00:14 - [Music]
00:22 - okay so in recent weeks
00:25 - roblox has added a new change which
00:28 - means that nobody can play games which
00:31 - are filtering enabled turned off which
00:34 - means experimental mode on so now
00:37 - developers need to start making their
00:39 - games featuring enabled so I'm gonna
00:41 - start making some videos which shows you
00:44 - how to convert things in your game which
00:47 - probably are broken which or are
00:50 - restricting your game from being non
00:54 - experimental so today what we're going
00:57 - to be looking at is we're going to be
00:59 - converting this GUI right here which
01:01 - allows you to spawn apart we're going to
01:03 - be converting it to filtering and
01:05 - labeled so if we go and play it right
01:07 - now what happens is when I go and click
01:09 - this button it spawns randomly colored
01:12 - parts into the game now this works fine
01:14 - but in a filtering enabled game so if
01:18 - this game had filtering enabled turned
01:20 - on I'd I would only be able to see this
01:22 - change no one else in the game would be
01:24 - able to see it and so the game kind of
01:27 - gets broken so we need to convert this
01:30 - game to filtering enabled so that
01:33 - everyone can see the parts which I spawn
01:35 - in and that no one else can do malicious
01:40 - things to the game so let's go into our
01:44 - local script and I'm just going to show
01:46 - you one of me so I've got a little event
01:49 - here which will run whenever I click the
01:53 - button and it just creates a new part in
01:55 - the workspace and gives it some
01:58 - properties as well describes it a little
02:00 - bit so we want to insert this part into
02:04 - the workspace but we need to do this on
02:07 - the server we can't do it on the client
02:09 - because the server will not replicate
02:12 - any changes made to the rest of the
02:15 - clients so we need to do this change on
02:18 - the server so that everyone else can see
02:20 - the new parts being added because at the
02:22 - moment only I will be able to see this
02:24 - change because I am the person executing
02:27 - the code and the parts are being created
02:30 - on my end so to do this we're going to
02:33 - insert
02:34 - a remote event into applicator storage
02:37 - so let's just go and insert that in now
02:40 - and let's just give it a name cooled
02:42 - parts create okay and I'm just going to
02:46 - want to go into the walk into service
02:49 - script service and put a script in here
02:51 - as well this is where the parts are
02:53 - going to be created and what's going to
02:56 - happen is we're going to make a request
02:59 - to this remote event from the local
03:01 - script and we're going to tell it that
03:03 - we want to insert a part into the game
03:05 - and then this script here on the server
03:08 - is going to listen out for a call to
03:10 - that remote event and when it gets
03:12 - triggered by the local script what's
03:15 - going to happen is the remote event is
03:17 - going to tell the script to execute the
03:20 - code and the code will be to insert a
03:22 - new part so let's go into our script and
03:27 - let's just create our event for when
03:30 - this remote event gets triggered because
03:33 - the local script on the client will be
03:35 - firing off this remote event and the
03:37 - server scripts which is in service
03:39 - script service will be listening out for
03:41 - this request to make the part and then
03:43 - we will be able to make it once once
03:45 - that request has been fired so to do
03:48 - this we're going to say game don't
03:50 - replicated storage and then really get
03:53 - the name remote event
03:54 - which is part create and then we're
03:57 - gonna say dot on server event so when
04:00 - there's been an event on the server when
04:02 - it's been triggered we're gonna say :
04:04 - Connect and pair parenthesis and we can
04:08 - say function and another pair inside of
04:11 - here and go and just drop a line so that
04:14 - we've got end and we've got our closing
04:16 - bracket on the end so inside of here any
04:19 - code inside of this events will run when
04:25 - the remote event is fired by the local
04:30 - scripts
04:32 - okay so we're going to have our code to
04:35 - create the part inside of this service
04:38 - script so let's go and just copy this
04:39 - out of the local script into the server
04:43 - script okay there we go and what we're
04:46 - gonna want to do now is head back to our
04:48 - local script because we want to detect
04:50 - when the player clicks the button and
04:53 - then we need to fire the remote event
04:55 - once it's been clicked so inside of this
04:58 - event the activated event when the
05:01 - button is clicked any code inside of
05:05 - this event run what we want to do is we
05:10 - want to fire the remote event okay so
05:15 - you do this it's quite simple we just
05:17 - have to say game dot replicated storage
05:20 - and we're getting the remote event again
05:23 - part to create and then what I want to
05:25 - do is we want to fire code on fire
05:28 - server and what this will do is it will
05:31 - fire off the trigger to anything which
05:35 - is listening out for it so you can have
05:37 - multiple scripts listening out listening
05:39 - out for a call from this remote event
05:41 - and then when there is a server event
05:44 - we've just fired the server event when
05:47 - that does get fired the code inside of
05:50 - here will run and the part will be
05:52 - crated so let's go and give our code a
05:54 - test let's go and run out the game in
05:57 - fact what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go
05:59 - and run this in a in a server in a test
06:03 - server so that we can see the game from
06:07 - two different players perspectives and
06:10 - have filtering label turned on as well
06:12 - in workspace and let's go and load up
06:15 - this test server so we've loaded up the
06:18 - game here in a test server and this is
06:20 - what would be like in a real roblox game
06:23 - with filtering enabled turned on so in
06:26 - if filtering enabled was turned off
06:29 - anyone would be able to insert the parts
06:32 - and we wouldn't have needed to do the
06:34 - changes we just made but now now that we
06:37 - have got filtering enable turned on if
06:39 - we hadn't have just made the changes
06:41 - which we just did with the remote event
06:43 - and the sir
06:44 - script the player who clicks the button
06:46 - would only have been able to see the
06:48 - part for themselves but now that we have
06:50 - made this game compatible with filter
06:52 - enabled by using remote events to send
06:56 - the trigger from the local script to the
06:59 - server script which creates the part on
07:01 - the server so that everyone can see it
07:03 - if we click on the button on player 2
07:06 - who's on the Left player ones on the
07:08 - right if we click the button and we fire
07:11 - it from player 2 player 1 on the right
07:14 - should be able to see the part being
07:16 - added and there it is so you can see the
07:19 - part was added on each player's client
07:23 - or it was added to the server and they
07:26 - got replicated to each client so
07:28 - everyone was able to see it and so now
07:30 - instead of just one person being able to
07:33 - see the change everyone in the server
07:35 - will be able to see and interact with
07:38 - the part which has just been added now
07:40 - let me show you what this would have
07:42 - been like if we just didn't make the
07:44 - changes we just did but if we kept
07:46 - filtering enabled turned on so here we
07:50 - are we're in the same test server again
07:52 - but this time filter enabled is still on
07:55 - but I've just reverted the changes we've
07:58 - just made and the part is being created
08:01 - in the local script or it and that's
08:02 - what it looked like at the start so
08:04 - there's no remote events there's no
08:06 - server scripts controlling any of this
08:08 - the part is being created on the client
08:10 - in that local script so this means that
08:13 - if the player if player two on the Left
08:16 - clicks this button the part will be
08:19 - created for them but for player one and
08:22 - everyone else in the game there's no
08:25 - part there and this is because the part
08:28 - what happened was the the player player
08:31 - two on the left click this button and
08:34 - the client his client his or her client
08:37 - said to the server I want to add a new
08:40 - part into the game and because we've got
08:41 - philtrum enabled on which prevents the
08:44 - client talking to the server and making
08:46 - changes the server said no I'm not going
08:49 - to add this part into your game I'm not
08:52 - so I'm not going to add the part into
08:53 - the server so it will only be added on
08:56 - it'll be
08:57 - it only be visible to you on the client
08:59 - but you could be doing something
09:01 - malicious so I'm gonna block this
09:02 - request so it's only been added to the
09:06 - client who clicked the button okay so
09:08 - it's only on there it's only on their
09:10 - game it's only on their screen because
09:13 - it's it's it's locally on their client
09:15 - however for the other players because
09:18 - what happens when the client makes a
09:20 - change
09:20 - what would usually happen is the change
09:22 - goes to the server and the server
09:24 - replicates that change to all the
09:26 - clients because the server has blocked
09:28 - that request it's not going to be
09:29 - replicated to anyone else so no one else
09:31 - will be able to see the part being added
09:33 - only the player who clicked the button
09:36 - hence why player 2 cannot see it so if
09:40 - we move player 2 over here you can see
09:42 - player 2 he's he's moving you see on
09:46 - player 1 screen so on play a 2 screen on
09:50 - on the left you can see that player 1 on
09:52 - the right he is actually pushing he's
09:56 - pushing the the brick but on the right
10:00 - screen are on player 1 he's not actually
10:03 - pushing anything to him because there's
10:04 - no there's no block there so the
10:08 - illusion is only there for player 2 on
10:11 - the left because it's like the part is
10:14 - locally on their client and only they
10:17 - can see it so that was a little tutorial
10:19 - on how to convert GUI buttons which
10:24 - spawn parts or make changes to parts on
10:28 - the server you have to use remote events
10:30 - if you're calling them from the client
10:31 - so I hope this helped you if it did
10:33 - please leave a like subscribe any if you
10:36 - are having troubles with experimental
10:37 - mode you want to make your game philtrum
10:39 - enabled compatible but you it's
10:41 - something stopping it from happening let
10:43 - me know what you want me to cover next
10:44 - in this series I'm going to be doing
10:46 - lots of videos on how to correct issues
10:49 - which are arising from experimental mode
10:52 - so if something's not working for you
10:54 - because of this new change then do let
10:57 - me know in the comment section below and
10:59 - I will try my hardest to make a video on
11:00 - it so this has been me
11:02 - blocks if you enjoyed the video please
