00:00 - hello and welcome to part two in how to
00:02 - create a simulator game on roblox series
00:05 - now in the last part we learn how to
00:09 - create a wait which when you lifted it
00:13 - gave you strength and in this video
00:15 - we're going to be creating the rebirth
00:18 - system so when you hit a certain amount
00:20 - of strength you'll be able to rebirth
00:22 - give it up
00:23 - go back to zero and then you'll gain one
00:26 - a rebirth point and then over time the
00:30 - more rebirths that you get the higher
00:32 - the more strength you get and the higher
00:36 - the boundary it is to rebirth again so
00:39 - let's go ahead and get started now I
00:42 - have been very nice I have created a
00:44 - rebirth GUI it looks like this and has a
00:48 - rebirth button and also shows how much
00:51 - strength you need to rebirth I've put
00:53 - this in the description for you go ahead
00:55 - and take the model add it to your
00:58 - inventory then go to home toolbox go to
01:01 - my models and drag it in to the start of
01:06 - GUI what we're going to do is we're
01:08 - going to have the main frame set to
01:10 - visible and I've also given you the
01:12 - local script but I've only defined the
01:15 - variables if you want to take the entire
01:17 - code then you can become a channel
01:20 - member but we're going to be scripting
01:22 - this rebirth system shouldn't take too
01:23 - long
01:24 - let's get into it so first thing that
01:27 - we're going to want to do is we're going
01:29 - to want to script the rebirth button so
01:32 - what we're going to do is we're going to
01:34 - go into the local script here in our
01:36 - wait sorry not gonna wait in the GUI and
01:39 - then I'm just going to make it little
01:40 - bit bigger and what I'm going to do is
01:42 - I'm going to firstly set the text okay
01:46 - so I want to set this text to say how
01:49 - much strength only three berths alright
01:51 - because let's say that the player just
01:53 - joined and their data was saved we're
01:55 - gonna do data saving soon but it's not
01:57 - gonna be 5,000 if they've already
01:59 - rebirthed so what I want to do is we're
02:02 - going to say strength - rebirth which is
02:05 - our our text label inside of the main
02:10 - frame in the rebirth menu there is a
02:12 - text label
02:13 - would strengthen rebirth and it
02:15 - basically says how much strength you
02:16 - need so we're gonna go and say strength
02:19 - to rebirth doctor text equals and then
02:22 - in speech marks we're gonna say you need
02:25 - at least and then space dot dot and then
02:30 - we're gonna say math dot floor which
02:32 - rounds a number and then inside of here
02:35 - we're gonna do inside these brackets we
02:37 - can do another pair of brackets and say
02:39 - start to rebirth amount which is the
02:41 - amount of rebirths which is the amount
02:44 - of strength you need to rebirth for the
02:45 - first time i've set this to five
02:47 - thousand at the top of the script so
02:49 - we're gonna take this number and we'll
02:52 - get it add to it the number of rebirths
02:54 - that we have so rebirths dot and value
02:58 - because I've defined rebirths here to
03:01 - just get their leader stats and get the
03:02 - rebirth stat so we're getting that value
03:05 - and we're timesing it by math dot square
03:11 - root I don't know we can just put a
03:13 - random number in here okay so it's gonna
03:15 - times that number by the square root of
03:19 - fifty million okay you don't have to do
03:23 - math on square root I guess you could
03:24 - just actually write in the square root
03:26 - of five million it's up to you you can
03:28 - write it however way you want completely
03:31 - up to you but then what we're gonna do
03:33 - is we're gonna just close off this
03:35 - bracket for the math dot floor that's
03:38 - going to round it to the nearest whole
03:40 - number and then we're gonna do another
03:43 - two can't walk to concatenate it back
03:45 - together and we can say strength to
03:48 - rebirth just like that so it's gonna say
03:51 - you need at least and it's going to put
03:53 - the number in and then then it will say
03:55 - strength to rebirth the next thing that
03:58 - we're going to do is we're going to want
03:59 - to code the the button the menu button
04:02 - which you see over here so that it
04:04 - toggles the GUI on and off so we can go
04:06 - back into the local scripts and we can
04:09 - drop a line and I'm going to get the
04:12 - main button which is the variable that I
04:14 - declared it starts main button dot mouse
04:17 - button wanna click current connect and
04:21 - then we can say in bracket and in
04:24 - bracket function with another pair
04:25 - brackets and then close that off with an
04:28 - end and closing bracket so this is it
04:30 - this is an event it will listen out for
04:32 - when the the main button has been
04:34 - clicked and when it has we're just going
04:36 - to set the main frames visibility to the
04:39 - opposite of whatever it is now so we can
04:41 - say main frame dot visible equals not
04:44 - main frame visible just like this okay
04:47 - and then outside of here we don't need
04:50 - to do anything else because that is that
04:52 - is managing all of the the button now it
04:56 - will open up the GUI when it's closed
04:58 - and obviously close it when it is open
05:02 - so what we want to do we want to do
05:04 - another one of these events for the
05:05 - rebirth button so we can say rebirth
05:08 - button doctor mouse button wanna click
05:12 - Perl on connect and then function again
05:16 - but inside of here
05:18 - what we're going to do is we're going to
05:19 - we're gonna in we're going to create a
05:21 - remote function and we're going to
05:23 - invoke that remote function and that
05:26 - remote function is going to well on the
05:28 - server it's going to check whether a
05:30 - player has enough strength so that they
05:32 - can rebirth now as I said in part 1 we
05:35 - use remote functions and remote events
05:37 - so that the player can't exploit so that
05:40 - they can't give themselves infinite
05:42 - strength and so they can rebirth
05:45 - immediately we do the checks on the
05:47 - server so that we can verify that a
05:51 - player is allowed to do something so
05:54 - we're going to crate the remote event
05:56 - here so I'm going to say in the remotes
05:57 - folder we're going to add in a what I've
06:01 - already added it in but you'll need to
06:03 - opt in yourself it's a remote function
06:05 - called rebirth ok and what I'm gonna do
06:08 - is we're going to then just do a
06:10 - variable ok this is going to store the
06:12 - result which the server returns back to
06:15 - us so we can say local results equals
06:18 - replicated storage and then we can say
06:21 - dot remotes because it's in that remotes
06:23 - folder dot rebirth colon invoke server
06:26 - and that's going to store the resort so
06:29 - what we need to do now is we need to go
06:31 - into the server and we need to script ok
06:35 - so we're going to go into the remotes
06:37 - grits and and begin coding this on the
06:40 - server so here we are in the server
06:42 - script and what we're going to do is
06:43 - we're going to just create a another
06:46 - well not it's not a non server event
06:49 - it's an on server invoking it's a
06:50 - callback function so we have to link up
06:53 - to it to a function and you'll see what
06:55 - the difference is here so we'll say
06:57 - replicate a storage dot remotes dots
07:01 - rebirth and we can say dot on server
07:05 - sorry on yeah on server invoke and then
07:09 - we say equals function okay and then we
07:13 - can just drop a line and add in an end
07:17 - like this you don't need a closing
07:18 - bracket on the end okay
07:20 - so inside of here what we need to do we
07:23 - need to do the same thing as we did in
07:24 - lift and we need to copy this line which
07:27 - checks whether they have a remote data
07:30 - folder okay and we're also going to pass
07:33 - through the argument of the player so we
07:36 - are going to say player over here so we
07:38 - know who called it and then what we're
07:41 - going to do is we're going to store
07:42 - their amount of rebirths as a variable
07:45 - so local rebirths equals player
07:48 - thought-leader stats dot rebirths and
07:51 - that will just be the number of rebirths
07:52 - that they've got so what we want to do
07:54 - now is you want to check to see if they
07:56 - have enough strength all that required
07:58 - rebirth so we can say if player
08:02 - thought-leader stats dot strength dot
08:05 - value is greater than or equal to and
08:08 - then in brackets we're going to do the
08:09 - same thing as we did in the local script
08:11 - which is the criteria to be able to
08:14 - rebirth so we're just going to copy this
08:16 - okay and so we're going to do the math
08:20 - dot floor copy that we're gonna go back
08:22 - to the remote script and just paste it
08:24 - in there okay and then we're gonna just
08:26 - say then drop a line and so what we need
08:31 - to do here is we need to define our star
08:33 - to rebirth amount again so at the top
08:36 - what what we could actually do is we
08:38 - could send the star to rebirth amount
08:41 - but then it can easily be exploited so
08:44 - we're just gonna say local starter
08:46 - rebirth amount equals 5,000 the same as
08:50 - we put it
08:51 - local script okay so back in the remotes
08:54 - script what we need to do now is we just
08:57 - need to well obviously if they do have
08:59 - enough strength then we can say rebirth
09:02 - value equals rebirths value plus one so
09:05 - we can add a rebirth we then want to put
09:08 - their strength back at zero so Claire
09:10 - don't leave the SATs dot strength dot
09:13 - value equals zero and then we couldn't
09:15 - respawn them by saying player code on
09:18 - load character just like this okay and
09:21 - then we're going to return back to the
09:24 - local script true to let them know -
09:27 - what - let the script know that they
09:29 - rebirth successfully and we can display
09:32 - like a success message on their screen
09:33 - but if they don't have enough strength
09:37 - to rebirth we can just say else else
09:42 - return not enough strength okay so
09:49 - that's all we need to do on the server
09:51 - to check to see if they're eligible to
09:53 - rebirth what we can now do is go back to
09:56 - the local script and we can pick up the
09:58 - result which we just returned which we
10:00 - are storing in this result variable and
10:03 - then we'll be able to check it and say
10:06 - whether it was a success or not so what
10:09 - we can do is we can say if results
10:11 - equals equals true so if it is true then
10:14 - we can say rebirth button dot text
10:17 - equals successfully rebirth okay and
10:24 - then we can do wait one so wait one
10:26 - second and then we can set the text
10:28 - again back to what it originally was and
10:31 - that is click here to rebirth okay but
10:36 - else if results equals false
10:39 - sorry not false not enough strength
10:42 - because that's what we returned in the
10:44 - server script then we're just gonna set
10:47 - the rebirth buttons text to whoops we
10:51 - set the back button rebirth button
10:54 - actually we are just gonna interrupt
10:56 - there you don't need the back button
10:59 - here because I actually added it in by
11:01 - mistake because I was trying to add
11:03 - something laughs to the GUI but we
11:05 - need at this part in the tutorial so I'm
11:07 - just going to delete that from the from
11:10 - the variables here so if you don't have
11:11 - it don't panic you can delete it if you
11:14 - have added it in yourself rebirth button
11:16 - dot text equals not strong enough or
11:21 - your own custom message if you want to
11:23 - change that and once again we can wait
11:26 - one second and say rebirth button dot
11:28 - text equals click here to rebirth so
11:32 - what we've done is we've just made it so
11:35 - when they click the button we will make
11:37 - them rebirth and if it's a success then
11:39 - we can display on the GUI that it was
11:41 - else we can say that they don't have
11:43 - enough strength and the last thing that
11:46 - we need to do is we need to have an
11:47 - event which checks to see if their
11:50 - rebirth value changes and if it does
11:52 - we're going to update this strength to
11:54 - rebirth text because this is only
11:56 - updating when they first join the game
11:58 - what if they rebirth during their stay
12:00 - in our game so we can say player and if
12:03 - I we don't see that we can just say
12:04 - rebirth will say rebirths current gets
12:08 - property changed signal and then inside
12:12 - of these brackets the property that
12:14 - we're listening listening for to be
12:16 - changed is going to be the value so when
12:19 - that is changed we can connect up to
12:21 - this function and inside of here we can
12:23 - just copy this code from line 13 and
12:27 - paste in and that's going to update the
12:30 - strength to rebirth text and we don't
12:33 - need to do anything more with that so
12:35 - that should be our rebirth system fully
12:38 - integrated now let's go ahead and test
12:41 - it out so I'm going to close down at the
12:44 - mainframe and see if the button works
12:46 - first I'm going to keep the output open
12:49 - in case we have any errors but the the
12:51 - the menu is opening perfectly if I click
12:54 - on click to rebirth it says not strong
12:56 - enough so let's go ahead and start
12:59 - lifting what I'm going to do is I'm
13:00 - going to go on to the server and give
13:02 - myself 4999 strength and that should say
13:10 - not strong enough there we go
13:13 - my camera seems to have glitched out a
13:15 - little bit or that is because I'm really
13:17 - big and I've gone into the base
13:19 - so don't worry but I'm convened go ahead
13:21 - and left to put me over 5000 strength
13:24 - I'm gonna click here to rebirth and
13:27 - there we go the strength has been reset
13:30 - to zero and I gained a rebirth and if we
13:33 - try again you can see I now need even
13:36 - more strength rebirth and I'm not strong
13:38 - enough I need to start rebirthing again
13:41 - but this time I'm gaining 50 strength
13:44 - per time per click so there we go guys
13:47 - we've just added a rebirth system to our
13:51 - simulator so if you enjoyed this video
13:54 - make sure that you click on the like
13:56 - button don't forget to subscribe
13:58 - turn on the notification bell and if
14:00 - you'd like to take the code from this
14:03 - series so you don't have to put in the
14:06 - work or if you just want to you know
14:08 - take it to use for yourself then you can
14:11 - become a channel member by clicking the
14:12 - join button next to the subscribe button
14:15 - and then you'll be able to take the code
14:17 - alright guys I'll see you in part 3
