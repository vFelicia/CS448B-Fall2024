00:00 - so you might have been watching my
00:01 - previous video on how to make cutscenes
00:03 - in roblox I do recommend you go and
00:05 - watch it you might be wondering well how
00:07 - do i trigger the cutscene to happen at a
00:10 - certain time so for example when a
00:12 - player when a round starts or when a
00:15 - player escapes you know from from a
00:17 - piggy room or you know maybe if they
00:20 - just step on a brick or something like
00:22 - that how do you make the cutscene happen
00:24 - at a specific time because out of the
00:25 - minute you play the game the cutscene
00:27 - will happen pretty much straightaway
00:30 - after 5 seconds so you know how can we
00:32 - make this cutscene only happen when
00:35 - you've done something and I will show
00:36 - you how that works so in roblox we
00:39 - obviously have local scripts which run
00:42 - on the client on your computer and
00:44 - they're the script that will be in the
00:46 - started GUI with a starter pack we'll
00:48 - start player ok in their local because
00:50 - they run on your computer whereas the
00:53 - game and the server scripts which
00:56 - control you know what what happens in
00:58 - the workspace and in the game and in
01:00 - your controls everything that all the
01:02 - players see which aren't things like
01:04 - your camera and GUI because they're
01:06 - specific to certain players well are
01:09 - most of our code is server code right
01:11 - running on the server so how do we
01:12 - trigger these cutscenes in these GUIs or
01:15 - whatever to appear on a player screen a
01:17 - specific time well if our code is
01:20 - running in a server script we can
01:21 - trigger this cutscene so you can see
01:24 - here I've got this function called tween
01:27 - and I'm just calling it after 2 seconds
01:29 - to tween the camera what we can do is we
01:32 - can use a remote event or remote events
01:34 - very simple or remote function only use
01:36 - a remote event because we don't need to
01:38 - return anything back to the server so a
01:40 - remote event is something that you can
01:43 - trigger on the server and you can then
01:46 - on the client listen out for when it's
01:48 - fired and when it does get fired from
01:50 - the server we can trigger this code to
01:53 - happen locally on the client so I'll
01:55 - give you an example right I'll create a
01:57 - remote event I'll call it cutscene you
02:01 - have to call it cutscene but if I fire
02:03 - it by saying game don't replicate this
02:05 - storage dot cutscene curl on fire
02:08 - clients cuz I'm firing it for a specific
02:10 - client I only want it to fire for a
02:12 - specific player
02:13 - and so we need to tell it which player
02:17 - are we gonna fire it for and so for
02:20 - example let's create an event right so
02:24 - let's create a part and we'll just call
02:28 - this test and we can say game don't work
02:32 - space test doctor
02:34 - Colonel connect function so whenever the
02:38 - brick is touched by something if the
02:43 - thing that touched the brick so hit if
02:46 - game so we'll create a variable for the
02:49 - player it's gonna be game dot players
02:50 - get player from character hit rock
02:53 - parents because hit dot parent is going
02:55 - to be their character and then if that
02:57 - is a player so this will either be true
02:59 - or false depending on there is a player
03:00 - in the game with character so if there
03:03 - is a player then we can fire a cutscene
03:07 - remote event for that specific player
03:10 - right and then on the client we can say
03:15 - game don't replicate the storage
03:19 - cutscene on client event when it's fired
03:22 - from the server to the client we can
03:25 - connect and we can run a function and in
03:28 - this function we're going to have our to
03:30 - the lines of codes that trigger this
03:32 - cutscene to happen so what will happen
03:34 - is only when this remote event gets
03:38 - fired and that will only be when
03:40 - something to when a player touches the
03:42 - brick it will start the cutscene so let
03:45 - me show you so we go in here now and we
03:48 - step on the brick you can see it hasn't
03:50 - happened straightaway the cutscene when
03:52 - I step on the brick you can see it
03:54 - started the cutscene now you did see a
03:56 - bit of a glitch there because it's it
03:58 - run it twice and that's because I didn't
04:00 - add a debounce
04:01 - to the brick I didn't stop it from like
04:05 - there's not a cool-down on it so I could
04:07 - keep jumping on it and it will restart
04:08 - like that but that is how you trigger
04:11 - the cutscene to happen okay and you know
04:14 - you might also be thinking what it I'm
04:15 - in my game and I want to trigger it for
04:18 - all players in the game how can I do
04:19 - that well if you want to trigger it for
04:21 - all players that are currently in the
04:22 - game you could say fire all clients like
04:25 - and if you just do a wait five seconds
04:28 - to allow the players to join before it
04:31 - runs when you do fire all clients it
04:33 - will fire their own motor vents for
04:35 - every player in the game so obviously
04:37 - there's only one in this game but if
04:39 - there were say ten players they would
04:40 - all see this happening at once whereas
04:42 - if you do fire a client and you give a
04:44 - specific player it will only fire the
04:46 - remote event and run the code on the
04:48 - client for them so of course you can
04:52 - also fire it for a specific player
04:54 - outside of a touched event or something
04:57 - like that if you know the player so
04:59 - let's say you could put game dot players
05:05 - wait for trial
05:07 - Alvin underscore blocks and this is
05:09 - assuming that I'm already in the game
05:10 - this wouldn't work normally because you
05:12 - can't tell the players that will be in
05:14 - the game but I'm just saying because
05:17 - obviously we know that I'm going to be
05:18 - joining the game it will work for me so
05:20 - if we just wait 15 seconds
05:22 - that should start the cutscene but you
05:25 - usually be using things like for loops
05:26 - to find out what to do it to all players
05:29 - or to find a specific a specific player
05:31 - you can see it started as well or you'd
05:35 - be able to you have maybe like a from my
05:38 - piggy game for example you know who the
05:40 - piggy is and you know who the
05:42 - contestants are so you could loop
05:44 - through all the contestants and you
05:46 - could fire a client for those that are a
05:48 - contestant whereas if you knew who the
05:51 - piggy was you could put the pig in in
05:53 - this brackets here so that's how you
05:57 - trigger the cutscenes to happen on the
05:59 - on the client but what if you wanted to
06:01 - every time you had a new cutscene you
06:03 - wanted to specify a new start and end
06:05 - point or you could take some information
06:06 - you could have B you could have the
06:10 - start point and the end point right and
06:13 - the time time length I'm just going to
06:17 - call it and then you could just get rid
06:20 - of this second tween and you could
06:21 - instead of having the information here
06:23 - you could just put start points end
06:25 - points and time length and then when you
06:28 - fire the cutscene from that from the
06:30 - client let's do fire all clients
06:34 - you could put the information in here
06:36 - right so game toys space test-1 again it
06:38 - was we still test two and one and that
06:41 - would still work so let me show you
06:43 - again and play the game
06:46 - and just wait the five seconds obviously
06:50 - oops I accidentally started it my bad
06:51 - because I stepped on the brick or in
06:54 - fact no it did itself it did it
06:56 - automatically starts automatically
06:57 - because we haven't got that touch
06:59 - detection anymore so you can see it
07:01 - works and it only did the one tween so
07:03 - if you wanted to do more tweens of
07:05 - course you could just keep on firing
07:07 - this you know from test to test three
07:11 - and you go test three about to test one
07:14 - for example and that would still do its
07:17 - job so that is how you do the cut scenes
07:19 - from a server scripts and you know
07:22 - trigger that triggering them for certain
07:25 - players as well so I hope that was
07:27 - useful don't forget to leave a like on
07:28 - the video if it was subscribe and also
07:31 - this applies to GUIs as well right if
07:32 - you wanted to make a GUI appear and you
07:34 - could have a remote event fire client
07:37 - for it and then pick it up in a local
07:38 - script and when you do pick it up in the
07:41 - local script you could make the GUI
07:42 - visible or invisible or between its be
07:44 - on your screen etc anyway hope it was
07:46 - useful if it was drop a like make sure
07:48 - to smash the subscribe button share it
07:50 - with a friend so they can get this
07:51 - knowledge as well and please check out
07:53 - my other videos including my cutscene
07:55 - video and my live events video which I
07:57 - went which went live this week so hope
07:59 - you enjoy and I'll catch you in the next
08:01 - video thanks for watching
