00:00 - hello everyone and welcome back to the
00:01 - fourth episode in my how to make a piggy
00:04 - game on roblox series now in this video
00:07 - we're going to be making the tools such
00:10 - as the stunt script for the crossbow and
00:12 - also the piggy batt work as well as the
00:15 - remote events we're going to set those
00:17 - up so we can have the announcements that
00:19 - come up when someone gets killed and
00:20 - also going to do the animations for the
00:23 - piggy bats as well as some general
00:24 - things as well to do with the game logic
00:26 - scripts as I said in the last video if
00:29 - you found a book check out the link in
00:31 - the description down below I am human
00:33 - and so I can't answer all of your
00:35 - comments because I'm getting a hundreds
00:37 - every single day it's just
00:38 - mathematically impossible for me to
00:40 - answer them all so try your hardest to
00:42 - debug your code look at the output
00:44 - window and scan your code line by line
00:46 - really carefully to see if you spell
00:49 - something wrong or made a mistake
00:50 - because that's going to be the cause of
00:52 - your books or your errors because as you
00:55 - can see on my end it's working
00:57 - completely fine so that any further ado
00:59 - let's get straight into episode 4 so
01:01 - what we're gonna work on next is
01:02 - cleaning up after the round is finished
01:04 - so things like teleporting the players
01:06 - back to the lobby
01:07 - removing everybody's tags destroying the
01:10 - map etc so after the start round
01:13 - function is called what we're gonna do
01:14 - is we're going to make the contestant
01:17 - stable in the game logic script we're
01:19 - gonna make it blank again so we're going
01:22 - to say contestants equals and then a
01:24 - blank table to reset it to a blank table
01:26 - then what we're going to do is we're
01:28 - going to loop through all of the players
01:30 - in the game again and just like we did
01:33 - at the beginning we're gonna copy this
01:34 - for loop and we're gonna paste it down
01:36 - here again and what we're gonna do is
01:39 - we're just gonna insert all of the
01:40 - players that are not in the menu into it
01:43 - okay just so that we've got all of the
01:45 - players in the game and then what we'll
01:48 - do is we'll teleport them back to the
01:50 - lobby
01:50 - so because obviously if they are in the
01:53 - menu that now they're going to be
01:55 - already in the lobby so this for loop is
01:57 - just in in adding them to the table
01:59 - again including those though the reason
02:02 - we have made the table from scratch
02:04 - again is because some people might have
02:06 - joined halfway through the round which
02:07 - is what we'll be working on later on and
02:09 - they won't have been counted in the
02:11 - original contestant table because it
02:13 - made before the previous round started
02:15 - so getting all the players again and
02:17 - then what we're gonna do is we're gonna
02:18 - put them back in the lobby so firstly we
02:20 - need to check if there are spawns in the
02:22 - lobby so make sure that you've named
02:24 - your lobby model lobby and you've got
02:27 - that spawns folder in there containing
02:29 - all of these spawn locations they need
02:30 - to be spawn locations and not just
02:32 - normal parts so make sure the fall is
02:34 - called spawns and you've got the lobby
02:40 - so once you've got all of the players in
02:42 - that table we obviously need to check
02:45 - that they were spawned so if game
02:47 - thought workspace Lobby caught on find
02:49 - first child spawns so she's got spawned
02:53 - in your lobby then we're gonna do around
02:56 - we're gonna call that teleport players
02:58 - function on the contestants and then
03:06 - we're going to do we we need to give the
03:09 - spawns to the teleport players function
03:11 - so that's going to be game dot workspace
03:14 - dot lobby again but spawns
03:20 - : get children and that will return a
03:23 - table of all the spawns in that folder
03:27 - okay all these spawn locations so that
03:29 - the teleport players can put all the
03:32 - players on different ones and that
03:34 - should do it for the piggy as well
03:35 - because the piggy won't be in the menu
03:38 - so even though we were counseling the
03:39 - piggies our contestant here we're not
03:41 - actually checking if they have a
03:42 - contestant value we're just checking to
03:44 - see if they're they're not in the menu
03:46 - which the piggy won't be so the piggy
03:47 - should be included here but if you
03:50 - haven't got any spawns we can do another
03:53 - fatal error warning just to warn the
03:56 - Creator so if you add a if you change
03:59 - the lobby it's a later date and you
04:01 - forget to add the spawns this should
04:03 - warn you in the output so you don't have
04:06 - to do it if you want but so it's a good
04:07 - way of reminding yourself if you don't
04:10 - know what you've done wrong and it just
04:11 - helps reduce the amount of errors that
04:12 - you might get after that we're going to
04:15 - need to delete the map delete the
04:18 - chapter that's currently in the work
04:19 - space so we can say cloned chapter :
04:21 - destroy and that will remove the map we
04:24 - don't want lots of maps being create
04:26 - that each round and then we need to
04:28 - remove everybody's tax and just clean up
04:30 - the whole game in general we've got
04:32 - quite a lot of things that we do need to
04:33 - clean up and which you might not have
04:35 - thought of so things like obviously the
04:38 - Piggy and contestant tag but also
04:40 - removing everybody's tools if they've
04:42 - got one equipped and all that other good
04:45 - stuff so we're gonna go back into the
04:47 - round module where we've got all of our
04:48 - functions and we're going to create
04:50 - another function I'm gonna call it
04:55 - function module dot remove tanks and
05:00 - then inside of this function firstly
05:03 - just going to do another for loop so for
05:04 - I comma V in pairs game dot players
05:08 - colon get players do so for every player
05:13 - who is going to be represented as V we
05:16 - are going to firstly check to see if
05:18 - they have a piggy tag if they do have a
05:24 - pig attack we'll say V dot piggy column
05:26 - destroy him to remove that piggy tag
05:30 - else else if V has a contestant tag
05:37 - which they probably will because there's
05:40 - only one piggy if they have got the
05:42 - contestant tag we will say V dot
05:43 - contestant :
05:45 - destroy so we'll firstly delete those
05:47 - tanks very nice and and then we will
05:53 - remove the tools so if they're the piggy
05:59 - gonna have a piggy bat so if V dot
06:02 - backpack find first child
06:06 - piggy bats then V dot backpack piggy bat
06:11 - : destroy and and we're gonna do the
06:15 - same thing again we're gonna copy that
06:17 - line I'm just paste it underneath but
06:19 - change the backpack to character in case
06:21 - they have it equipped so change it there
06:23 - but also change it after the then you've
06:25 - got to change it two times so if leader
06:27 - character find for his child to pick you
06:29 - bat then they'll have it in the hands
06:30 - currently we need to destroy it from
06:31 - there as well because it'll either be in
06:34 - the backpack or it will be in the
06:35 - character
06:36 - it'll be unwanted but not both but now
06:40 - we've done that we need to remove all of
06:44 - the contestants tools so we can say for
06:47 - now because we've got a for loop inside
06:50 - another for loop I'm going to use two
06:52 - different variable names for my I and V
06:55 - so we're gonna say for underscore comma
06:57 - P in pairs V backpack : get children do
07:04 - so looking through all the tools in the
07:06 - players backpack if P is a tool then he
07:12 - : destroyed as I've said it doesn't
07:14 - matter what you call these two values
07:15 - okay I've just used a - because I'm not
07:17 - even gonna use the I value the index
07:19 - value I'm only using the P and the P
07:21 - represents the thing that's going to be
07:23 - inside the backpack or anything that's
07:24 - going to be inside the backpack so we're
07:26 - looping through everything so it's going
07:27 - to be done to everything in the backpack
07:29 - so if it's at all gonna destroy it then
07:31 - we need to copy this for loop make sure
07:35 - you only copy the right amount of n so
07:38 - we should only need two ends one for
07:40 - ending the for loop one for ending the
07:42 - if statement and once again change the V
07:44 - dot backpack to V dot character so
07:46 - you're just looping through all of the
07:47 - things in the character and if there's a
07:49 - tool stored in the contestant character
07:52 - we're going to destroy it so now that
07:54 - we've done that we've deleted their
07:55 - contestant value and removed their tools
07:57 - we should be good to go on that front
08:00 - one other thing I'm going to do is I'm
08:02 - going to go into server storage and
08:04 - inside of here
08:07 - in fact yeah in self storage I'm going
08:13 - to insert a folder called game values
08:16 - and inside of here I'm going to insert a
08:21 - bull value and this value is going to be
08:24 - called game in progress and it's just
08:27 - useful because we can set it to be true
08:29 - or false when a game is happening and
08:31 - then from other scripts we can tell if a
08:33 - game is currently in progress for
08:35 - example when we're going to work on the
08:37 - menu script soon which is going to run
08:40 - when they press the play button we want
08:42 - to check to see if a game is currently
08:43 - in progress and if it is we want to put
08:45 - the player into the current around if
08:47 - they've joined halfway through so to do
08:49 - that we need to check our games in
08:50 - progress so I'm gonna set this value to
08:53 - be true when around starts and then at
08:55 - the end when we do the remove tags we
08:57 - can set the value of it to be false so
08:59 - I'm gonna say outside of this for loop
09:03 - that's where it ends
09:04 - don't do that I'm going to say game but
09:09 - service storage game values dot game in
09:12 - progress store value equals false okay
09:14 - I'm gonna make that false then what I'm
09:17 - going to do is we're gonna set it to
09:19 - true in another scripts okay and the
09:23 - script we're gonna put that into is
09:24 - gonna be in the game round module but
09:30 - it's going to be it's gonna be in the
09:34 - start round because that's when the
09:35 - round begins so we'll just do this
09:37 - little whoops we'll just copy it and
09:38 - paste up here but this time I'm going to
09:42 - set it to true because when the round
09:43 - starts we're going to set the game in
09:45 - progress value to be true but then when
09:46 - it ends and we do the remove tags to
09:49 - clean up the game to the general clean
09:51 - up so we can do the next round we're
09:52 - going to set it to false because off to
09:54 - the game isn't in progress anymore in
09:56 - fact we'll put that at the top because
09:57 - it should be executed first in my
10:00 - opinion the script does everything in
10:01 - steps and so we want to firstly set the
10:05 - game in progress value to be false
10:06 - obviously because that's the first thing
10:08 - that should be done just in case somehow
10:10 - some of this is so fast that they click
10:12 - the play button before we set it to
10:14 - false even though the round has finished
10:17 - okay so that's that done and that is the
10:19 - cleaning up needed so that we can start
10:21 - the next round but you will be wondering
10:24 - well how do we start the next round
10:25 - because currently when the game finishes
10:28 - that's it it doesn't restart and it's a
10:31 - good question first things though we
10:33 - need to call that's remove tax function
10:36 - just like that after the clone chapter
10:38 - colon destroy now we need to wrap all of
10:43 - this code that we've just written well
10:44 - nearly all of it into a while loop so
10:46 - where we start this intermission here
10:48 - we're gonna say while while wait do and
10:54 - then we're gonna add an end right at the
10:57 - bottom so make sure you've got that
10:58 - while wait do at the start just after
11:01 - where you've acquired the door module
11:03 - but just before the intermission and
11:05 - then at the very end of the script after
11:07 - the remove tags you add that end then
11:11 - selects everything in between those two
11:13 - lines in between the while wait do and
11:16 - the end select it all and press tab on
11:18 - your keyboard that will indent it and
11:21 - that just makes it a lot more organized
11:24 - and clean it shows us the code that is
11:26 - inside this while loop and now that
11:28 - we've put it in a while loop that means
11:29 - that it will repeat forever so it will
11:32 - just keep running this code over and
11:34 - over again so we start off on the
11:36 - intermission but when we get right to
11:38 - the end and we've removed the tags and
11:40 - we get to this end here we're gonna go
11:42 - right back up to the top and do it all
11:44 - over again and that is how the rounds
11:45 - repeat themselves forever and ever and
11:47 - ever because the while loop when it gets
11:50 - the bottom it will go straight back up
11:51 - to the top so after we've cleaned up the
11:53 - round and destroyed the map and
11:54 - everything and teleported everyone back
11:56 - it's gonna do an intermission again for
11:57 - 30 seconds then it's going to choose a
11:59 - new map because it's firing this round
12:01 - select chapter function and then it's
12:03 - going to teleport everyone then it's
12:04 - going to start another round and that
12:06 - round is only gonna finish when the
12:08 - round start round function gets to the
12:11 - end which will only gets the end when
12:13 - this for loop is broken so either when
12:15 - the time's up or someone dies or the
12:17 - piggy dies or whatever so you can now
12:19 - see that we have this game loop which is
12:21 - running over and over and over again so
12:23 - this is how the game works
12:25 - and we've pretty much finished the game
12:27 - loop for itself
12:31 - now obviously we don't want the round to
12:33 - start unless there are two players
12:35 - because that way is going to do the
12:37 - intermission and if there's only one
12:38 - player is going to choose the piggies
12:40 - and then it's going to get stuck because
12:42 - there's no other contestants to choose
12:44 - from because we've removed the piggy
12:45 - from the table so we need at least two
12:47 - people to start the game and obviously
12:49 - we can test with two people because we
12:50 - can start up our test server so we're
12:53 - going to implement a repeat until loop
12:55 - in our while loop at the top here before
12:57 - the intermission
12:58 - but inside the while loop still so we
13:01 - write repeat until and we want to repeat
13:05 - checking to see if there's enough
13:07 - players in the game so we'll do local
13:09 - we'll create a table and when I call
13:11 - that table available players and we're
13:13 - going to add all of the players that are
13:15 - not in the menu to this table then we're
13:17 - going to see how many items are in this
13:18 - table so how many players are available
13:20 - to play and then we can see if that
13:22 - number of valuable players is greater
13:24 - than or equal to two we can start the
13:26 - game so we're going to repeat and we're
13:28 - going to use a for loop for I comma
13:31 - player in pairs game dot players come
13:36 - get players do if player so if not
13:43 - player find first child in menu so if
13:48 - there isn't a tag in the player called
13:50 - in menu then we're going to insert them
13:53 - into that table so table dot inserts
13:55 - we're going to add them into the
13:56 - available players table and the thing we
13:58 - want to insert is that player so then
14:01 - what we've done that we can say we can
14:05 - set the status to say say to stop value
14:09 - equals in fact we haven't got a variable
14:14 - for the status yet so we're gonna say
14:15 - local status equals game but replicated
14:19 - storage come on wait for child status
14:21 - because we have we have the status value
14:24 - in the round module which is where we've
14:26 - been was well been updating the status
14:29 - from currently but we have no need to
14:31 - actually update the status from the game
14:32 - logic script yet so status door value
14:34 - equals to ready
14:37 - players needed okay
14:41 - and then what we'll do we'll do a
14:42 - bracket and open bracket and then we'll
14:44 - do a dot dot and then we'll do hash tag
14:47 - available players dot dot and then open
14:50 - the bracket again open the speech marks
14:51 - and close the bracket off and that way
14:53 - it just it will tell us the number of
14:55 - players current in the game and in fact
14:57 - I'll do it / - in this in this end
15:01 - string here so that it will it will look
15:04 - like a fracture and so if this one
15:06 - player in the game it will say to Eddy
15:07 - players needed and then it will say one
15:09 - out of two not just updates the status
15:10 - makes it look really nice then we're
15:12 - gonna add a weight to just so that it's
15:15 - not repeatedly repeating this every you
15:17 - know hundreds of times per second or
15:20 - whatever we need a nice delay so that it
15:22 - doesn't crash off script so a weight too
15:24 - will do perfectly and then we want it to
15:26 - keep on repeating this and keep on
15:28 - checking to see if there's two players
15:30 - until the number of available players is
15:34 - greater than or equal to two and when it
15:37 - is greater than or equal to two it will
15:39 - break out of this loop it's kind of like
15:41 - a for loop or a while loop it will keep
15:42 - on running until there are two or more
15:47 - objects in that table when I say objects
15:49 - in that table I mean players in the game
15:51 - because if there is a player that is not
15:53 - in the menu then we insert them into
15:55 - that table and every time we go around
15:57 - again we reset the table so we make it
15:59 - blank again we insert all the players
16:00 - that are ready to play and then we count
16:02 - up how many are ready and then if there
16:04 - are enough players then it will break
16:06 - out of this repeat loop okay so now we
16:10 - can test the game and I'm gonna put this
16:13 - intermission back down to 5 seconds
16:15 - because it doesn't matter about it being
16:17 - long or short because the game is only
16:19 - going to start when we have those two
16:21 - players in the game okay so you can see
16:27 - that we are in the game but we haven't
16:29 - been teleported or anything you know
16:31 - nothing has come up on the screen and
16:32 - that is because we're in the menu and we
16:35 - told the scripts not to count us if
16:38 - we're in the menu and if we open up the
16:39 - server here oops if we just bring the
16:42 - server over here and we look at player 1
16:44 - we can see that player 1 is in menu and
16:46 - player 2 is in the menu when we exit out
16:49 - of the menu look at player 1 you can see
16:51 - that that in menu gets destroyed and now
16:53 - it says that there's one
16:54 - out of two players that are ready to
16:56 - start the game if we do the same for
16:58 - player two it will now say two out of
17:00 - two players already and it's gonna say
17:02 - next round starts in five four three two
17:04 - one one of us is gonna be selected to be
17:05 - the piggy but then we have our game loop
17:08 - and it's still going really really
17:09 - quickly so if I die for example if I
17:14 - reset then it's gonna say the piggy has
17:18 - killed everyone then hopefully it should
17:22 - it will get rid of the map let's see
17:24 - yeah the maps gone I could see it on my
17:26 - server it's completely gone but the next
17:29 - round is starting so it should insert
17:30 - them up again there we go it's been
17:31 - inserted and now you can see we're both
17:35 - the piggy and that's because we haven't
17:36 - undressed the piggy yet and we haven't
17:39 - actually removed the old piggy so that's
17:42 - what we need to do next so to reload the
17:46 - piggy we're going to go into the round
17:47 - module we're gonna go through our remove
17:49 - tags and in the if if statement where it
17:52 - says if the fine first hard piggy what
17:54 - gonna do is we're gonna say at the end
17:56 - of this V curl on load character and
17:59 - what I will do is will respawn the piggy
18:01 - without their outfit so it will just
18:02 - respawn them as they were with their
18:04 - normal player outfit okay and then that
18:07 - way when the next round starts they will
18:10 - be back to normal they won't have their
18:11 - piggy bath anymore because we've
18:13 - destroyed it from the backpack yeah and
18:17 - one other thing I'm gonna do is I'm
18:19 - going to go to the game logic and I'm
18:21 - gonna add some weights so I don't want
18:24 - to activate the doors as soon as the map
18:27 - has been loaded because just in case the
18:29 - map hasn't fully loaded yet and we
18:30 - accidentally miss out a door I'm gonna
18:32 - add a wait two seconds there I'm also
18:34 - going to have a wait two seconds between
18:38 - the actual teleporting of the players
18:41 - and the math being loaded because
18:44 - sometimes the map can't be fully loaded
18:46 - and if you teleport people straight away
18:48 - they might get stuck halfway in the map
18:51 - because they'll start falling and then
18:52 - suddenly the map gets loaded so their
18:54 - torso is stuck in the map so if we get
18:59 - where the map yeah when the map has been
19:02 - loaded and when the piggy has been
19:04 - chosen if we just
19:07 - do another wait here for two seconds
19:10 - that looks good to me and we'll also do
19:14 - another wait here just so that when the
19:19 - rounds all finished we can just wait two
19:22 - seconds after everything's been cleaned
19:24 - up before we start the next one okay I
19:28 - think that's all good
19:32 - let's go ahead and test it again okay so
19:39 - the next round is starting and if we
19:41 - just die again as soon as we load in get
19:46 - ready to reset okay so the current PE
19:50 - has reset and so he should yeah so he's
19:54 - now responding as my default character
19:57 - and hopefully a different piggy gets
20:00 - chosen next time maybe it's gonna be
20:02 - player one on the rise see so now we've
20:07 - got those weights in there were just
20:08 - allowing some time for the everything to
20:12 - get loaded but now we actually have a
20:13 - proper game loop which seems to be
20:16 - working which is really really good so
20:18 - what is left to do got quite a few more
20:21 - things left to do such as the piggy bats
20:23 - and all of the different remote events
20:25 - that we need for our duis and things
20:28 - like that
20:28 - and also things like teleporting players
20:31 - if they've joined halfway through
20:33 - crouching placing traps lots more to
20:37 - come because we want to make our piggy
20:41 - back work so that's one of the remote
20:43 - events that we are we're going to have
20:44 - to set up so I thought I'd walk you
20:48 - through how the piggy batt works so
20:51 - inside the tool piggy bat which is in
20:54 - service storage firstly we have a local
20:56 - script and this handles all of the
20:58 - clicking that's done on the players
20:59 - computer so we've got two events here
21:01 - script dot perparing dot equipped and
21:04 - that's going to run when the tool is
21:06 - equipped and opened up it's going to
21:07 - show the GUI that says click a player
21:09 - within eight studs to kill them just a
21:11 - little helpful guide and this one as
21:13 - well unequipped will hide it when you
21:14 - want equipped at all but this one let's
21:16 - cook the pound activated it's going to
21:18 - fire or be triggered when you click the
21:20 - mouse
21:21 - so Mao stop target is gonna be the thing
21:22 - that you clicked so if the mouse top
21:24 - target is a hip is called hitbox okay or
21:27 - it's inside of a model the thing that
21:31 - you touch then it's likely there's gonna
21:34 - be a player okay so what we'll do is we
21:38 - will use get player from character with
21:41 - the mass target and that will check
21:42 - whether the player that you've clicked
21:44 - is an actual player and if they are a
21:46 - player then we can fire this remote
21:50 - event inside the piggy bat called hit
21:52 - and supplying the player that we've
21:56 - clicked and then in this server scripts
21:58 - is going to pick up the hit event and
22:02 - it's going to play an animation which
22:05 - looks like you're swinging the bat if
22:07 - you're the piggy and what's going to
22:09 - happen is it's quite it looks a bit you
22:13 - know confusing to you but all that's
22:14 - happening is it's checking if the victim
22:16 - the person that you've passed to the to
22:18 - the server script to the through the
22:21 - remote event the victim if they have a
22:24 - character is checking to see if they
22:27 - haven't already escaped that's something
22:29 - that we're going to work on very soon
22:30 - but also it is going to check to see if
22:35 - you are within eight studs of the player
22:38 - so this victim dot character the
22:40 - humanoid root part opposition - player
22:42 - character to human rapport position dot
22:44 - magnitude that is basically the distance
22:47 - between you the piggy and the victim so
22:50 - if it's less than or equal to eight
22:52 - studs then it will let you kill them so
22:54 - you have to be within close range and
22:56 - then what it will do is it will slow
22:58 - them down it will make them freeze
22:59 - you'll freeze as well and we've got this
23:02 - function called freeze which will
23:03 - basically kind of like it will weld all
23:05 - of your body parts together so you can't
23:07 - move sorry the victim's character and
23:10 - then we're gonna fire this remote event
23:12 - called piggy hit and that's what we've
23:14 - got to insert so let's create the remote
23:16 - event in a replicated storage and call
23:18 - it piggy hit now what this will do is it
23:23 - will tell the player or the victim to
23:27 - show a GUI on the client end and that's
23:31 - going to be the black GUI that appears
23:32 - and then
23:34 - what will happen is after naught point
23:35 - 65 seconds which is going to be how long
23:38 - it takes for the swing to actually
23:40 - unlike hit the player it will again slow
23:46 - the player down and it will kill them
23:47 - and sorry yeah it kills them and then it
23:50 - plays a death sound and the death sound
23:52 - is the same one you'll hear in piggy and
23:53 - then after they've died it will make the
23:56 - piggy be able to walk again and it will
23:58 - fire this other remote event called kill
24:00 - feed and the kill feed is what makes the
24:02 - GUI pop up on the screen saying that the
24:06 - victim was killed by the piggy so that's
24:07 - another remote event that we're gonna
24:09 - insert and we're gonna call it kill feed
24:11 - so by now you should have three remote
24:14 - events one called menu play one called
24:16 - kill feed and one called piggy hit now
24:19 - if you're interested in learning more
24:20 - about how I made this piggy bat I'm
24:22 - gonna make a tutorial I'm gonna link to
24:24 - it in the card or put it in the
24:25 - description I'm not sure if I've run out
24:26 - of cars yet cuz there's a max limit of
24:28 - five but I will film myself making this
24:31 - from scratch so if you want to enhance
24:34 - your scripting knowledge maybe a little
24:35 - bit more advanced at scripting and you
24:37 - want to know how I made this tool from
24:38 - scratch then I will have a tutorial on
24:41 - how I did that I'll put it in the
24:42 - description okay so they are the road
24:48 - events that you need for the bats now
24:51 - the next thing we'll look at is the stun
24:54 - script so there's also a tool called the
24:58 - crossbow and that's for use by the
25:00 - players the contestants and if they
25:02 - click the piggy basically like shoot the
25:05 - crossbow at the piggy the piggy will
25:07 - become stunned for 20 second so 20
25:11 - seconds so yeah so inside of this local
25:15 - script it's a little bit different to
25:17 - the other scripts because it fires a rep
25:19 - a remote event called stun so that's
25:21 - another remote event that we'll need I'm
25:23 - gonna add another remote event in
25:25 - through applicators storage and so
25:27 - should you and I'm going to call it stun
25:29 - so what it will do it will fire that
25:31 - remote event and then it will destroy
25:32 - the crossbow because it can only be used
25:34 - once unlike other tools we don't want
25:36 - any player to always be able to kill the
25:38 - auto stone that the piggy house it would
25:41 - be unfair so you only get one use and so
25:43 - it will destroy after use but there are
25:45 - two crossbows available in the map
25:47 - in different places but they were both
25:49 - destroy when they've been used once okay
25:51 - so when this stun remote event is fired
25:55 - it gets picked up on the server in this
25:57 - stun script which came with your piggy
26:00 - kit again I will have a video up
26:02 - teaching you how to make the stun script
26:04 - and the crossbow from scratch although
26:06 - for most of you it probably will be
26:08 - quite advanced and if you don't want to
26:12 - learn how to make it then that's fine
26:13 - but the video is in the description or
26:15 - in the card if I do have a space for a
26:17 - card if you want to learn how to do it
26:19 - but basically a quick overview is that
26:21 - when it's picked up on the server your
26:23 - mouse target so the thing that the
26:24 - player clicked is sent it just checks if
26:27 - the target is um is a member of a model
26:29 - and if it is then it's probably the
26:32 - piggy so we look up the piggy player
26:34 - from their character check to see if
26:36 - they have that piggy value and if they
26:38 - do we're inserting a tag into the piggy
26:41 - called stunned and after 20 seconds that
26:45 - tag gets destroyed
26:47 - so from other scripts we can tell
26:50 - whether the piggy has been stunned for
26:52 - example in the bat script the piggy is
26:55 - not allowed to kill anybody
26:57 - whilst they're stunned so if they try
27:00 - and click and fire this hit event then
27:03 - we will check if not player a fined for
27:06 - his child stunned and that basically
27:08 - means if the piggy isn't stunned then
27:10 - we'll let them kill this player but if
27:12 - they are stunned and they have got that
27:14 - value in them called stunned we're not
27:15 - going to let them we're not going to let
27:18 - the player kill the victim so the victim
27:21 - gets away because the piggy is stuck
27:23 - remember in the stun script the piggy
27:26 - also gets sparkles added to their head
27:29 - which makes it look like they're
27:31 - confused we also announce to all players
27:34 - that piggy is gone for 20 seconds now
27:36 - this is another a most event that you
27:38 - need to insert so go ahead insert
27:40 - another remote event into replicated
27:42 - storage and call it announcement now the
27:45 - announcement remote event gets fired
27:47 - from the server and what you can do is
27:49 - you can send a message now you can
27:50 - either send a message to a certain
27:52 - client a client is basically a player or
27:54 - you can send it to all clients so all
27:56 - players in the game will get the message
27:57 - and when you do if we go into the GUI in
28:00 - the client
28:01 - mein which does again come with your
28:02 - picky kit because I made it for you if
28:04 - you look in here we've got game dot
28:07 - replicated storage that announcement on
28:09 - client event so when it gets fired from
28:10 - the server it's gonna make it's gonna
28:12 - change the announcement GUI so it's
28:14 - gonna change the announcement text
28:16 - labels text to your whatever the text is
28:18 - that we sent it's gonna make it visible
28:19 - for five seconds so you can see that
28:21 - announcement all players will be able to
28:23 - see some something get announced so kind
28:26 - of like a message like piggy has gone
28:29 - for 20 seconds we've also got one the
28:31 - kill feed which we've already created
28:33 - we've already created our remote event
28:35 - for and that is when somebody gets
28:38 - killed with the bat with with a bat
28:41 - script we will fire that event to all
28:43 - players saying that the player whoever
28:46 - it was was killed by the piggy and it's
28:48 - basically the same thing so the remote
28:51 - events that you will need are going to
28:53 - the stun piggy hit announcement kill
28:56 - feed and menu play make sure that you've
28:59 - named them exactly the same as I have
29:01 - and you've got the capitalization
29:02 - correct really really important and as
29:04 - always I am gonna put tutorials into the
29:07 - scripture on how I made all of these
29:09 - realized events work and all of the
29:12 - tools as well it may be a little bit
29:14 - delayed after the video that's just
29:16 - because I have got a lot of content but
29:18 - over at the moment I've already got gone
29:21 - into three hours of filming this video
29:23 - so a lot to to edit so please do back
29:25 - with okay so now that we have done these
29:29 - stunt scripts let's go ahead and try it
29:31 - out and see if it works now like any
29:35 - other item I'm gonna have to go into the
29:37 - map and find the crossbow so hopefully
29:41 - we can do that before the time runs out
29:43 - here we go so try and do it as quick as
29:47 - I can
29:47 - I know it's in here in a dining room and
29:52 - pick it up and hopefully I don't out of
29:55 - time look we've got not long left to
29:57 - talk if I click the piggy he's gone for
29:59 - 20 seconds he can't move I'm trying to
30:01 - move him but he can't move at all
30:03 - he's just trapped and he can't kill
30:06 - anybody so look the contestants everyone
30:08 - so brilliant so the stun script has
30:10 - worked perfectly now
30:13 - let's also test out the bats because I'm
30:15 - wondering if that's working with your
30:18 - most events that we've just added I
30:20 - wonder if it does so wait for the piggie
30:24 - and this will be awesome if it does work
30:27 - so we're gonna click on the player look
30:32 - at that boom player one was killed by
30:35 - the piggy so we've now got our piggy bat
30:37 - working and it says to the piggy has
30:39 - killed everyone so we've got a working
30:41 - piggy game which is awesome so I'm going
30:45 - to try this again and what I love about
30:47 - this is that the camera will change to
30:50 - the piggy when you get killed just like
30:52 - in the normal game so if the piggy kills
30:54 - you it will look like the piggy is
30:57 - hitting you with the bat which is really
31:00 - really awesome so let's have a look
31:01 - again I try and boom and you heard that
31:04 - as well the death sound is the actual
31:07 - one from the piggy game as well so
31:10 - awesome we've got a lot of our piggy
31:14 - game finished so far although there's
31:15 - still a lot more to do things like traps
31:17 - crouching lots more to do and if we just
31:21 - check the output see if anything's gone
31:23 - wrong I don't think it has no errors
31:25 - which is awesome so you can tell that
31:27 - the tutorial is working so there we go
31:33 - okay the next thing that we're going to
31:35 - do is we're going to work on this menu
31:37 - play on server event in the event
31:39 - handling script and we're going to work
31:41 - on when a new player joins and around is
31:44 - already in progress we can insert them
31:47 - into the current round which we know
31:48 - it's going to be pretty easy to do trust
31:50 - me
31:50 - so after this if in menu if statement
31:54 - we're going to do another one underneath
31:55 - it we're gonna say if game got service
31:57 - storage dot game values got game in
32:00 - progress dot value is equal to true
32:03 - double equals then so if a game is
32:06 - currently in progress
32:07 - what we're gonna do is we're going to
32:09 - put the player into the round so what do
32:11 - we need to do well firstly we need to
32:12 - give them a contestant value we're going
32:15 - to put that contestant value into their
32:17 - player so very very simple just as we've
32:19 - done before
32:20 - local contestant equals instance new
32:22 - ball value give it a name contestant and
32:25 - we're going to put that we're gonna
32:26 - parent it inside
32:27 - their player objects then we're going to
32:29 - do is we're going to teleport them into
32:32 - the round using the teleport players
32:35 - function of the round module so we're
32:38 - going to have to in we're gonna have to
32:39 - require the round module by saying a
32:41 - local round module equals require script
32:44 - or parent wait for child game logic
32:46 - round module and then underneath this
32:50 - instance new ball value but still in the
32:52 - if statement we can say round module dot
32:55 - teleport players and we have to supply
33:00 - the player table so the table of players
33:03 - that we want to teleport obviously we
33:05 - just want to teleport this one player so
33:07 - we have to put them in their own table
33:08 - like this just as we have to do with a
33:10 - piggy and then we're gonna do comma and
33:12 - we also need to give the function the
33:15 - map spawns so we will get the current
33:18 - map from the workspace which will be
33:19 - games don't work space dot map as we
33:21 - change the name of the map to be map
33:23 - doctor player spawns in fact we will say
33:26 - find first child map in case it's not
33:30 - there and then we will save dot player
33:33 - spawns : get children like this okay and
33:37 - that will teleport that player into the
33:40 - map it and then they will be in the
33:42 - round so now let's go ahead and test
33:47 - this out so we're going to go into test
33:49 - mode this time however with three
33:51 - players because obviously we need to to
33:53 - start the game and then we're gonna have
33:55 - the third one who joins halfway through
33:57 - so let's check it out
33:58 - okay so we've got player player two on
34:02 - the left to play one on the right and
34:03 - player three in the middle now we're
34:05 - going to insert player three into the
34:07 - game when the current round starts and
34:10 - so let's click on play and boom they get
34:14 - inserted into the round and if the piggy
34:16 - kills player three well they still play
34:19 - a two left so they're still being
34:21 - counted so they're being counted as an
34:22 - actual player so the game registered
34:26 - them as a contestant because we inserted
34:27 - that contestant value into their player
34:30 - excellent so we have just been able to
34:33 - allow players who join late or you know
34:36 - midway through a round into the game
34:39 - halfway through and I think that's fair
34:40 - you know these rounds they're quite long
34:42 - ten minutes they can last a while you
34:44 - only be waiting for ages so so yeah okay
34:51 - so next thing that we're going to do is
34:52 - to do with the piggy bat again and I
34:54 - said earlier about a hitbox which we
34:57 - talked about in the bat script so either
35:00 - to see if it's if the victim is a I'm
35:05 - sorry so two hits a player the piggy
35:08 - currently has to hit the player's
35:10 - character so one of their body parts and
35:12 - that can be hard to do especially if
35:15 - they're moving and jumping is hard to
35:17 - click it especially if you're on a
35:18 - mobile device as well so what I've also
35:21 - done is I've allowed a I've allowed for
35:24 - the piggy to also be able to touch a
35:27 - part called hitbox and so what we can do
35:30 - is we can create a big part which
35:32 - surrounds the players boundaries and
35:35 - it's kind of like a big square part so
35:37 - even if you click an edge of a player's
35:39 - character or maybe just a little bit
35:41 - outside of their head you will still hit
35:44 - their hitbox which will be attached to
35:47 - their character so it will still
35:48 - register as being able to kill the piggy
35:50 - which is why I've said if Mouse target
35:52 - name is hitbox so what we need to do is
35:54 - we need to weld this hitbox to the
35:57 - player if you haven't already seen the
35:59 - hitbox is currently in the server
36:01 - storage it came with the piggy kit and
36:04 - I'm going to show you what it looks like
36:06 - in the workspace it's currently
36:07 - transparent but if we just make it
36:09 - visible you can see so the player would
36:14 - be inside of this hitbox so imagine that
36:16 - the head is like in the middle here you
36:18 - still have a little bit of leeway in
36:20 - that you can hit anywhere within this
36:23 - box and you will still hit the player
36:25 - which is kind of fair I think and it's
36:27 - worked very well in testing so I'm going
36:28 - to make it transparent we're gonna put
36:30 - it into the server storage and the way
36:32 - we're going to do it is we're going to
36:33 - clone at this hitbox and then weld it
36:36 - using a weld object so that it sticks to
36:38 - the players character even when they're
36:39 - moving so make sure that anchored is set
36:42 - to false and can collide it's also set
36:44 - to false okay so both need to be false
36:46 - unchecked but what we're going to do is
36:50 - okay so inside the round module in the
36:56 - teleport teleport players here we will
37:05 - let's think about this yeah so I'm going
37:08 - to I'm going to do a wiener inserts the
37:10 - hitbox so local hitbox clone equals game
37:14 - dot server storage dot hitbox cut on
37:17 - clone I'm gonna say hitbox clone got
37:21 - parents ah yeah got parent equals game
37:28 - sorry
37:29 - player character then we're gonna say
37:31 - hit in fact before we parent it will say
37:33 - hitbox clone dot C frame equals
37:38 - character dot humanoid a root part dot C
37:42 - frame we need to attach it first before
37:43 - we parent it because we need to weld it
37:46 - in a minute
37:46 - then we're gonna say local weld it was
37:49 - instance gotten you by the way if you
37:51 - don't know what a weld is a weld is an
37:53 - object in roblox which joins two objects
37:56 - together even if they weren't anchored
37:57 - so that they stick to each other so
38:00 - instance new weld weld dot part one so
38:04 - you have to set the two parts that
38:05 - they're that they that they stick
38:07 - together so the first part is going to
38:09 - be the characters humanoid root part the
38:13 - second part we don't say part two
38:15 - instead we say part zero I know it's
38:17 - weird but that's the way roblox works
38:19 - part 0 equals hitbox clone okay and then
38:23 - we're going to put the weld objects
38:25 - inside of the character just like that
38:29 - and then we can do the hitbox cloned or
38:33 - parent equals player character so
38:34 - firstly we're cloning it in we're
38:36 - putting it in the right position we're
38:37 - still keeping it in server storage for
38:39 - now
38:39 - just so that we caught it in the right
38:40 - position it won't fall out of place or
38:42 - whatever then we're welding it together
38:44 - and then we're putting the hitbox inside
38:48 - the players character now if we check
38:50 - this out again and load the game up
38:51 - let's have a look okay
38:56 - new round is about to start if we open
38:58 - up the Explorer and have a look in our
39:00 - if we have a look here in this list you
39:04 - can see we have a hitbox for player one
39:07 - who is the other player if we have a
39:09 - look over here you see that they've now
39:11 - got a hitbox surrounding their character
39:13 - so if I was to click maybe just a little
39:16 - bit a little bit off by their next to
39:18 - their head but still click in the hitbox
39:21 - they would still die and it didn't
39:24 - register the first time because I was
39:26 - just a little bit out of bounds so I
39:28 - wasn't within the eight studs but you
39:29 - can see that the hitbox gets created now
39:32 - if your watch again closely obviously we
39:34 - don't know who the Piggy's going to be
39:35 - so it could do insert into any of these
39:37 - players let's have a look who's gonna be
39:43 - ok was player two so this time I've got
39:46 - the hitbox on me so if I was to make
39:50 - open at the properties window and change
39:51 - the transparency ignore point five you
39:53 - can see it surrounding me so the piggy
39:55 - could click anywhere wherever this
39:59 - hitbox is surrounding so here wouldn't
40:01 - work but if I was to click there it
40:03 - would work so it makes it easier for the
40:04 - piggy to kill you but it was hard in the
40:06 - first place especially if you're on
40:08 - mobile so and especially as well if
40:10 - you're a small character and your are 15
40:14 - sliders are ha the lowest is even harder
40:17 - to kill somebody
40:18 - so this hitbox makes it easier for the
40:20 - piggy and trust me if you've ever played
40:22 - with the piggy it is it is it's a
40:25 - godsend it's it's much much better to
40:27 - play with it like this so yeah that's
40:30 - the hitbox complete and it just makes
40:33 - for a better game
40:35 - and also those of you who are using the
40:39 - bats the animation most likely will not
40:41 - play for you and that's because we can't
40:43 - share animations in roblox so you're
40:45 - gonna have to create it yourself
40:47 - now if the bat isn't working for you
40:49 - because of this I recommend that you go
40:53 - into the bat script and you just remove
40:55 - this part here where it says local
40:57 - animal equals player character find
41:00 - first child humanoid load animation
41:01 - script the pound or swing ok remove
41:03 - these lines of code this highlighted
41:05 - block remove that and it should work but
41:08 - I'm going to show you how you can make
41:09 - the animation so what you need to do is
41:12 - you need to go to server storage we're
41:15 - gonna copy the piggy we're gonna put the
41:17 - piggy into the workspace and if we open
41:20 - up the animation editor again set the
41:22 - animation property to be action just
41:23 - make sure that you click the three dots
41:25 - by the play button on the animation and
41:28 - then you've clicked on set animation
41:30 - priority and then you've clicked action
41:32 - if you don't do this then your animation
41:34 - is not going to play when we load the
41:38 - game because it's priority is lower than
41:41 - the default core animation so make sure
41:44 - if your animation doesn't work that you
41:47 - have set the animation priority to be
41:49 - action and then we're gonna do is when
41:53 - you go to about noir point one we're
41:55 - going to drag the arm up into the air
41:58 - I'm gonna move along a bit move it even
42:02 - further back and then drag the blue
42:05 - along and we're gonna swing it so we're
42:08 - gonna move the arm background but turn
42:10 - it a little bit like this let's play
42:13 - perfect I like this one looks good to me
42:16 - so I'm gonna right click export' okay
42:20 - and then it's going to say create new go
42:23 - ahead and do that and give it a name and
42:26 - click finish then carefully click and
42:31 - drag to select this ID then right click
42:35 - and copy it click OK if you can't see
42:40 - that that animation ID go to roblox go
42:43 - to the create page and then go to my
42:46 - animation
42:47 - in the left column and it will appear
42:49 - for you then you can close down the
42:51 - animation editor and then go into the
42:54 - swing animation and paste your animation
42:56 - ID into there and then if you go back
42:59 - into the game it should work I have been
43:02 - filming for over three hours I know the
43:04 - video isn't that long that you're
43:06 - watching but all of this footage has to
43:08 - be edited really really carefully so
43:09 - I've been filming for over three hours
43:12 - today so reads appreciate all the
43:13 - support the likes the subscribes and
43:15 - everything much appreciated
43:17 - ok let's try it again then let's go over
43:19 - here and see if our animation will play
43:20 - boom look at that
43:23 - the animation has played now if you
43:25 - think the player got killed too early or
43:27 - too late and you want to change the
43:29 - timing that's fine just go into the tool
43:32 - and the piggy bat and play around with
43:35 - these weights okay so this weight here
43:37 - change it to maybe a smaller number so
43:40 - in 0.55 100.75 have a quick play don't
43:44 - mess around too much with the other
43:45 - things because you might break the bats
43:47 - and I can't help you you've messed it up
43:49 - okay so the next thing that we need to
43:50 - do we need to actually make it possible
43:51 - for players to escape so in the map we
43:55 - have a final door now I'm going to just
43:58 - take the chapter 1 out of the folder and
44:01 - put it in workspace to show you so the
44:02 - final door is this one and it's unlocked
44:04 - by the white key firstly you need to use
44:07 - the wrench to turn the generator on and
44:09 - the generator has a value inside of it
44:11 - called on and when you click the wrench
44:13 - it will check to see if you've clicked
44:15 - the generator and if you have it will
44:17 - set this on value to be true
44:19 - then when you use the hammer to click
44:22 - these two wooden blocks they will get
44:23 - deleted and then finally when both of
44:26 - these things have been done you'll be
44:28 - able to use the white key to unlock the
44:29 - door so what I've done is I've named
44:33 - this door the exit door so the door that
44:36 - you want people to escape from you must
44:38 - call it the exit door with a capital e
44:40 - and a capital D that is so important you
44:42 - need to call it exit door I've also
44:45 - added a padlock mesh onto every single
44:49 - door so if you want to add if you want
44:52 - to make another door which is locked
44:56 - you need to have two things you need to
44:57 - have this value called key and you also
45:02 - need to take this pavlok so you'd copy
45:03 - it and then you'd get the door you want
45:06 - and select it I press alt and click to
45:09 - select the door itself and then you
45:10 - right-click and paste those two things
45:12 - into it now the padlock is going to
45:15 - appear far away so you need to click the
45:17 - padlock by pressing alt and click and
45:19 - then alt again and click and drag ok let
45:23 - go of alt and then you can drag it onto
45:25 - your door so I'm going to drag it onto
45:27 - the door here then I'm going to use the
45:29 - Move tool just to push it into the door
45:31 - a little bit and I'm going to change the
45:32 - color of the door to a different color
45:35 - okay what I've done that I then need to
45:38 - in fact we would have got a green key so
45:40 - I'm gonna do a a black key it's kind of
45:45 - hard to see there we go
45:46 - black but I'll make it hmm okay we'll go
45:50 - with that
45:51 - so yeah when you've done that you need
45:53 - to then change the value of this key
45:56 - value to say to be the name of your key
46:00 - so it needs to be the name of the tool
46:02 - now I'm gonna create a tool called black
46:04 - key so I'm gonna change this value to
46:06 - say black key so this is the the key
46:09 - that you'll need to unlock this door ok
46:11 - you need to have the value you need to
46:13 - set the value the value property of the
46:15 - value and have the padlock in there as
46:17 - well next you then need to make the key
46:20 - so what I do is I will just take a key
46:23 - so the green key for example right click
46:25 - and duplicate and change it to black key
46:28 - make sure you name it black key and then
46:31 - going to change the color to be black
46:36 - and then I'm gonna go into key handles
46:38 - and I'm going to duplicate one of our
46:41 - current keys so the black and the blue
46:42 - key I'm going to name it black key and
46:45 - again I'm going to change the brick
46:47 - color to be black so we've created a key
46:49 - handle which will allow us to click it
46:52 - and equip it and then we've created our
46:54 - tool objects called black key and we've
46:57 - also got our door with the key value
46:59 - inside which tells this the black key
47:01 - that's needed to unlock it as well as
47:03 - the padlock which will fall off when you
47:05 - click the the key against it so you need
47:07 - a padlock in every single door and
47:10 - key it's not gonna work and you'll get
47:12 - an error then obviously you need to take
47:16 - the black key out of the service storage
47:20 - key handles and you need to put it into
47:21 - the items folder so I'm right clicking
47:25 - and pressing paste into or ctrl shift V
47:28 - and that puts the black key into the
47:31 - items folder and I'm going to press F
47:32 - when selected to move the camera to it
47:35 - and we now need to move it somewhere
47:37 - into our map so that players can pick it
47:39 - up so for example I'm gonna go put it on
47:42 - the bottom for all here okay now if I
47:45 - take the map and I put it into
47:47 - replicated storage into the chapters
47:49 - folder and I play the game again we'll
47:52 - be able to use it so very very essential
47:54 - things firstly you need to have the door
47:57 - with the key string value inside and
48:01 - that needs to the value property of that
48:03 - needs to be the name of the key used to
48:05 - unlock it you then need to create that
48:07 - key and put it into the service storage
48:08 - tools folder and then you need to create
48:12 - the key handle which is basically the
48:14 - the the parts inside of the key inside
48:18 - looked at all so what I did I just
48:20 - duplicated the current key that I had
48:22 - the blue key changed its name changed
48:24 - the color and that way I just had a
48:28 - quick way to make the key and then you
48:30 - had to okay so it's not working for some
48:33 - reason so I can't open the door and if
48:34 - you can't open the door it's a sign that
48:36 - your door manager has gone wrong and
48:39 - there's an error in your door manager
48:41 - scripts so let's just have a look and
48:43 - see what the error is in this server so
48:46 - going into the server window nothing
48:48 - seems to have gone wrong hmm no nothing
48:53 - needs to be wrong here let's try and
48:55 - debug oh I just realized I'm so stupid
49:01 - um so it's locked isn't it it's locked
49:05 - we need the key but the key is on the
49:06 - other side of the door so we kind of
49:10 - chose the wrong door to do there but
49:12 - we'll try again and see we get a
49:13 - different spawn point but then
49:14 - afterwards what we will delete the door
49:17 - there because we don't want that door to
49:18 - be locked
49:21 - by the way unclear into the round module
49:23 - and change the weight here for the for
49:27 - loop to go back to one so it's actually
49:29 - a true countdown of ten minutes so I got
49:33 - lucky this time so if I take the well
49:36 - firstly let's check out the door so I
49:38 - can't currently go through it but if I
49:40 - pick up the key which I can do because
49:44 - it's got that click detector and the key
49:47 - the key scripts inside which you need to
49:50 - put into each key handle by the way so
49:54 - put that a click detector and the key
49:56 - script in there in all the other keys
49:57 - and items so you can pick it up if we
50:00 - put it against the door you can see the
50:01 - door manager automatically makes the
50:03 - padlock for when the key touches it and
50:05 - the door will disappear so that works
50:09 - perfectly so that's how you add your own
50:10 - door or key I'm gonna go back into the
50:12 - chapter now and remove the black key I'm
50:18 - also going to remove the padlock and the
50:21 - key value I'm gonna rename the door as
50:24 - well good practice to name your door to
50:27 - whatever it is so if it's unlocked by
50:29 - the black key name it black door that's
50:32 - what I've done with will leave the door
50:33 - so this is the blue door this is the
50:34 - purple door this is the red door etc so
50:37 - remove the door and the Black Keys also
50:42 - gone from the items folder so that can
50:43 - go back into chapters folder make sure
50:46 - you do put it in wrap the kg storage
50:47 - chapters then I'm gonna go into the key
50:50 - handles and remove it so when I was
50:52 - talking about the key script if you're
50:53 - adding a new key make sure you add this
50:55 - item script into the black key key
50:59 - handle it's in all the other keys so you
51:01 - can just copy it and paste it in but if
51:03 - it's a model like the crossbow as I've
51:05 - said before put it in a part inside the
51:07 - model but change script or parent to
51:09 - script a pound a parent because we want
51:12 - to send the model not a part to the
51:16 - clicked function in the key module so
51:19 - delete the black key and also delete the
51:21 - tool as well if you're not going to use
51:23 - it okay so we're nearly finished with
51:25 - our piggy game the last thing that we
51:26 - need to do is work on the crouching
51:28 - system so that a player can Crouch
51:30 - through certain holes in the map and
51:32 - also the trap system
51:34 - that the piggy can lay down traps which
51:37 - the players can get stuck in so that's
51:39 - what we'll be doing next but we do have
51:42 - a functional piggy game as we speak so
51:44 - you can go ahead and play it and try to
51:46 - escape from the piggy
51:47 - perhaps publish it and try it out with
51:49 - some friends so click on file and then
51:51 - if you go to publish to roblox you'll be
51:54 - able to publish this as your own roblox
51:57 - game also you might not have seen that
52:00 - this main menu actually changes your
52:02 - camera to be looking into that intro
52:04 - tunnel I showed you about earlier this
52:06 - is because in the client main scripts
52:09 - after two seconds your camera see frame
52:12 - so the position of your camera gets
52:13 - changed to the to be looking into the
52:16 - intro tunnel so if you wanted to add
52:18 - your own piggy inside of this tunnel
52:20 - what you need to do is go into server
52:22 - storage where we have currently got our
52:24 - piggy right click and copy and then
52:27 - paste piggy into the intro tunnel now
52:31 - we're gonna use the Move tool to move
52:33 - him all the way over there and we're
52:35 - gonna press F to move our camera to him
52:37 - I'm just gonna move them over here and
52:40 - because the cameras looking like this
52:42 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to use
52:44 - the scale tool and a press down shift
52:47 - and drag to make him bigger then I'm
52:49 - going to use the rotate tool to make him
52:52 - look at the camera like this oops I've
52:57 - dragged it too far out so I'm gonna
52:58 - press ctrl Z and now if we select
53:02 - everything inside of this piggy and we
53:06 - set it to anchored so that he won't move
53:08 - around we can also delete this animate
53:10 - script because it's not needed now if
53:13 - you play the game then after 2 seconds
53:17 - of being in the menu it's 2 seconds just
53:19 - to let you load in you'll see that the
53:21 - piggy has appeared because our camera is
53:24 - now looking at the piggy so if you
53:26 - wanted to you could rotate him even
53:30 - further like this so he's actually
53:31 - looking at you and we'll try it again
53:33 - and you can add whatever things you want
53:36 - to this intro tunnel and it makes it
53:40 - look more like the real game doesn't it
53:42 - because you've got your picky looking at
53:43 - you and you could have more things down
53:45 - here if you want to improve the lighting
53:48 - you can if we go into the lights parts
53:51 - and change the surface light range you
53:53 - can increase that or you can change the
53:55 - brightness or even the angle of the
53:58 - light like this I'm gonna have mine set
54:02 - at 90 there you go very very nice touch
54:04 - and again that intro tunnel came with
54:08 - the piggy kit so make sure that you
54:10 - don't change the name of the intro
54:12 - tunnel or the name of the camera face or
54:14 - camera origin parts because it will it
54:16 - will and break itself if you do want to
54:18 - change it and you do have knowledge on
54:20 - see framing the camera then go ahead but
54:23 - I won't be able to help if you if you
54:25 - mess it up so I hope you enjoy the

55:03 - which I'm working on right now so you

55:10 - other cool perks such as a little badge
55:13 - next to your comments in in the chat and
55:16 - also priority responses for your
55:18 - comments and also if you want to tinker
55:21 - around with the effects that come on the
55:24 - screen when the piggy does hit you then
55:26 - you're gonna want to go into the piggy
55:27 - hit local script in the main GUI and
55:29 - mess around with this noir point 65
55:32 - value as well because this is the time
55:35 - that the camera will be looking at the
55:38 - piggy before the screen goes black so
55:40 - the longer the the higher the number so
55:44 - maybe noir point seven five or more
55:45 - point eight the longer will stay looking
55:48 - at the piggy but the the less the number
55:50 - then the the less time it will it will
55:51 - between looking at the piggy and the
55:54 - screen going black so you kind of want
55:55 - it to be synchronized with the piggy
55:57 - batt script so if you set it to nought
55:59 - point eight five over here you want
56:01 - have it the same in this piggy hit
56:03 - script as well so we will leave it there
56:04 - for episode 4 I recommend you go
56:06 - straight to episode 5 it should be
56:09 - released by the time you're watching it
56:10 - or if you're watching it just as it's
56:12 - come out then you'll have to wait until
56:13 - tomorrow to watch that but it should be
56:15 - on your screen now so go ahead and click
56:17 - the thumbnail to head straight to the
56:20 - next part episode 5 I'll see you there
