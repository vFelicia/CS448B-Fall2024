00:00 - okay in this part we're going to learn
00:02 - how to create buttons that can only be
00:06 - unlocked once another item is purchased
00:08 - so for example if we want the player to
00:11 - firstly buy the conveyor and then once
00:14 - they've bought the conveyor the button
00:16 - for the dropper then appears okay rather
00:18 - than every single button being visible
00:21 - when the player first joins so to do
00:25 - this uh there's a few ways and I'm sure
00:28 - there's you know per L acceptable ways
00:32 - of doing this um but the way I've
00:34 - decided to do it is for every button if
00:37 - you want it to uh then unlock some other
00:40 - buttons once you've purchased the item
00:42 - we're going to create an attribute for
00:44 - it so I'm going to create a string we're
00:46 - going to call it item
00:48 - IDs um to appear once
00:54 - bought okay and then I'm just going to
00:58 - put the IDS of the items that I want to
01:02 - um appear when they've purchased this
01:05 - item so let's say they want to unlock
01:07 - they want to make the The Dropper appear
01:09 - okay so it doesn't mean they're going to
01:10 - buy the dropper it just means the
01:11 - dropper becomes
01:13 - purchasable so that has an IDE of
01:16 - two so we're going to change the item
01:19 - IDs to appear once bought to two now we
01:24 - set this to be a string okay um we
01:27 - didn't set it to be a number so whilst
01:29 - we have a number here it's actually a
01:31 - string okay and and this is because you
01:33 - might want to have multiple item IDs
01:36 - right so let's say we wanted to have
01:38 - items 2 3 4 and five um appear once
01:41 - we've bought them we can do this because
01:43 - it's a string uh so it's essentially
01:45 - text it's not actually a number this is
01:48 - just some text uh however you can see
01:50 - the ID of item to unlock is a number if
01:53 - we try to give it multiple values it
01:55 - won't let us so um the the reason I I've
02:00 - made this a string is so that we can
02:02 - allow multiple items to then be visible
02:06 - or purchasable once this stter well this
02:09 - this conveyor has been has been uh
02:11 - unlocked and what we'll do is we'll
02:13 - write some code which will uh extract
02:16 - the numbers from this string and we can
02:18 - make them all appear so what we now want
02:22 - to do is we want to go to our code and
02:24 - when this item is unlocked we're going
02:26 - to want to um individually make the
02:29 - buttons appear so in the plot Handler
02:32 - around line 79 where we've got the
02:35 - button do touched we want to scroll down
02:38 - past the point where we know that they
02:40 - can afford the item and what we want to
02:42 - do is we then want to see if the button
02:46 - has an item IDs to appear once bought
02:49 - attribute so we can say local item IDs
02:53 - to appear once
02:56 - bought equals uh button get get
03:00 - attribute item IDs to appear once bought
03:05 - like this okay and then we can see you
03:08 - can check to see if that actually exists
03:10 - because it might not exist we might not
03:11 - have set an attribute for that button so
03:14 - if item IDs to appear once bought then
03:18 - we want to take this string and we want
03:20 - to turn it into the individual numbers
03:22 - because this is just one string right
03:24 - now we want to get these four numbers or
03:26 - however many numbers there are from this
03:29 - string so we're going to say um local
03:33 - numbers so always say local item IDs to
03:37 - uh item IDs equals uh string dot uh
03:43 - split okay and this is going to split
03:45 - the string up into pieces so we can get
03:48 - the individual numbers so item IDs to
03:51 - appear once bought that's our string and
03:53 - then we tell the game what the separator
03:55 - is and the separator is the character in
03:58 - between the numbers you in our case it's
04:00 - commas okay cuz we've got 2 comma 3
04:02 - comma 4 comma 5 so we're basically
04:04 - saying where there's a comma in this
04:06 - string split it up and so that we can
04:09 - get the individual character that's to
04:11 - the left or to the right of it in that
04:12 - case the numbers whether that's number
04:14 - two number three number four or number
04:15 - five so if we put our comma in here in
04:20 - uh in as a string by using the quote
04:22 - marks or speech marks we can then this
04:26 - will now be the table of our numbers so
04:28 - it will look something like this 2 3 4 5
04:32 - but because this is a table we can then
04:34 - get the individual numbers from it by
04:36 - indexing that table so we want to Loop
04:38 - through this table so for underscore
04:42 - comma uh Item ID in item IDs do we now
04:47 - have the individual item ID number so we
04:50 - will Loop through and we will do it for
04:52 - two three four and five so what we want
04:55 - to do is we want to firstly get the item
05:00 - uh in the template
05:02 - items uh by its ID sorry I mean get the
05:06 - button okay um so
05:10 - local uh we can just call it local
05:13 - button I am wary that we have gotten a
05:15 - variable already called button here um
05:18 - but since this is nested within our for
05:20 - Loop it will only apply to this for Loop
05:23 - so it's okay so button equals uh we want
05:27 - to find the button in the buttons folder
05:31 - here in the workspace that has the ID of
05:35 - item to
05:37 - unlock so what we're actually going to
05:39 - do is I'm going to create another
05:42 - function like we did earlier which just
05:45 - like these ones which will let us do an
05:47 - action like this without having to Nest
05:49 - that code in this for Loop here so I'm
05:52 - going to call the function get button by
05:56 - ID of item to unlock okay and I'm going
06:00 - to pass that item ID to our function and
06:03 - we will we will code the function to
06:06 - return the button object to this
06:08 - variable so let's just copy the name of
06:10 - this function and go to the top of our
06:13 - script and we're going to create a local
06:15 - function and we're going to call it the
06:18 - same get button by ID of item to unlock
06:22 - now we're also going to need to pass the
06:23 - player and the item ID so let's go back
06:26 - down and let's just pass the player as
06:31 - well to this function because this
06:33 - function is outside of our um create
06:37 - plot event which passes the player so we
06:39 - have to keep a reference to that player
06:42 - so that we can access that player from
06:43 - this function so that's why we pass it
06:45 - to this function and so what we're going
06:47 - to do is we're going to Loop through
06:49 - this player's plot so we're firstly
06:51 - going to want to get their plot so I'm
06:54 - just going to move this function below
06:56 - the get plot
06:58 - function um and then I'm going to call
07:00 - it so local plot equals get plot player
07:04 - if not plot then return end because we
07:07 - obviously don't want to carry on if
07:08 - there's no plot for some reason this is
07:10 - just like a fail
07:11 - safe now we can Loop through the buttons
07:14 - folder in that plot so for underscore
07:17 - comma button in plot. buttons colon get
07:21 - children
07:23 - do if button get attributes ID of item
07:28 - to unlock
07:30 - lock um in fact we will create a
07:33 - variable for
07:35 - this local ID of item to
07:39 - unlock if ID of item to unlock we just
07:43 - need to make sure it exists just in case
07:45 - you forgotten to set up this attribute
07:47 - it would be nil and it would then cause
07:49 - an error so um we can actually say if
07:53 - not uh ID of item to unlock then
07:57 - continue end and that will just move on
08:00 - to the next button in the loop uh by
08:04 - this point we know that the the
08:05 - attribute exists so we can say uh if
08:09 - item
08:10 - id uh is equal to ID of item to unlock
08:15 - then return button end okay and I'm
08:19 - going to actually put this onto another
08:21 - line just to make it more readable so
08:23 - this is going to return the button and
08:26 - if there is no button it won't return
08:28 - anything at all
08:29 - so we can now go back down to our
08:34 - code and uh where is it here it is so we
08:36 - now have the button but let's just make
08:39 - sure it exists so if not button then
08:42 - continue
08:44 - end and then by this point we know that
08:46 - the button exists uh we have now found
08:49 - the
08:49 - button so we want to make it visible now
08:54 - it's it's going to be visible already
08:57 - because we haven't actually written any
08:59 - code that hides it so I think we should
09:01 - do that first um so let's figure out how
09:04 - we should hide this
09:07 - button now there's two ways we can do
09:09 - this um the first method which is the
09:12 - easier method is we just add an
09:14 - attribute to every button that we want
09:18 - to only appear once another button has
09:21 - been uh touched and we can just add an
09:24 - attribute to that to say hidden and then
09:26 - when the game first loads it will hide
09:29 - all of those
09:30 - buttons the other option is we Loop
09:34 - through every single button and we see
09:38 - if it is listed in another button uh in
09:42 - the item IDs to appear once bought uh
09:46 - string however that would mean if you
09:48 - have a lot of items it's going to be
09:49 - looping over every single item and it
09:52 - might might cause some performance
09:53 - issues so that's the way I see it some
09:56 - people in the comments might have their
09:57 - own um you know view so personally what
10:02 - I'm going to do is I'm just going
10:04 - to choose the buttons I don't want to
10:07 - appear by default when the Tycoon loads
10:11 - and I'm just going to add a Ulan
10:14 - attribute okay and I'm going to call it
10:17 - hidden and I'm going to click save I'm
10:20 - going to make it
10:22 - true now some people would argue that
10:25 - having to set another attribute is just
10:28 - another thing you have to remember to do
10:30 - and that's true however I think for this
10:33 - Tycoon and for this series it's the
10:35 - simplest method of doing it so there's
10:37 - no right or wrong answer this will work
10:40 - either way I just wanted to explain
10:42 - myself so what we can now do now that
10:45 - we've set up this hidden attribute in
10:47 - the button is when we load in our
10:50 - buttons in the plot Handler around line
10:53 - 86 we want to firstly check to see if
10:59 - this is hidden so we can say if button
11:02 - get attribute
11:05 - hidden
11:06 - then uh we want to hide the button so
11:09 - button.
11:11 - transparency equals 1 and we also don't
11:14 - want it to um unlock the item when you
11:17 - touch it because you can still obviously
11:19 - touch it when it is hidden so firstly
11:21 - we're going to say button. canide equals
11:23 - false and then in the button. touched
11:25 - event we want to say if button get
11:29 - attribute
11:31 - hidden then return end
11:36 - okay because if it is hidden if it is
11:38 - true then it will just end the event
11:41 - there so let's just uh also we're going
11:46 - to need to hide the items as well so
11:48 - we've hidden the button we we just now
11:50 - need to hide the uh items I believe uh
11:54 - or actually that might be done um by
11:57 - itself right because we haven't actually
11:58 - touch T that button yet so I think we're
12:00 - good there um so I think let's just
12:02 - let's just um go back to our conveyor
12:05 - button and let's change the item IDs to
12:08 - appear once bought I only want to unlock
12:12 - the dropper so the dropper has id2 so
12:15 - we're just going to change this value to
12:17 - two because obviously we don't have any
12:19 - any other items with the IDS of four or
12:22 - five yet so you've set this to be two so
12:25 - that when this button the the conveyor
12:29 - is pressed then the item IDs to appear
12:33 - once bought are going to be two and that
12:36 - is the dropper so the dropper is going
12:37 - The Dropper button is going to appear
12:39 - when we've stepped on the conveyor
12:41 - button and we've bought the conveyor
12:43 - anyway Let's uh
12:46 - just um check this out now what I'm also
12:50 - going to do is I'm going to just um in
12:57 - my uh no I'm not going to do that
12:59 - actually I'm just going to click on
13:01 - play now if you're like me and you've
13:03 - tested the game a few times and you
13:05 - realize you can't go back to the start
13:07 - because you've unlocked everything let
13:09 - me show you how to solve that because
13:11 - that's what I've just realized so you
13:13 - want to go and get the data store editor
13:15 - now I think it costs 100 Robo so if you
13:18 - don't want to pay for it you just want
13:20 - to change player
13:23 - data sorry um do something else so you
13:26 - might want to change it to player data
13:28 - too if you do that it's going to reset
13:30 - every player's data okay so if you want
13:32 - to get the old data back just change it
13:34 - to what it originally was called but
13:36 - like I'm saying the better way to do it
13:38 - is to use the data store editor plugin
13:40 - which we talked about in the last uh
13:42 - episode so you click on it and then you
13:45 - I'm just going to drag it to fill up the
13:47 - whole
13:48 - screen right and then you type in your
13:51 - name of your data store which is in that
13:54 - script so it was called player data for
13:56 - me and then you put player and then the
13:59 - user
14:00 - ID which is the format we set it up in
14:02 - the data script player underscore and
14:05 - then the user ID so in my case it's
14:09 - player1 49430 69 which is my user id you
14:14 - click on data you don't even have to
14:16 - click on data you can just uh click on
14:18 - the delete and click on delete and that
14:20 - will delete my data for that slot so it
14:23 - only affects me if you had other players
14:25 - in your game wouldn't affect them
14:27 - obviously cuz it's just deleting my data
14:29 - my specific user ID so now we're back uh
14:33 - let's walk over and going to need to
14:36 - give myself some cash so whilst I'm
14:38 - walking over I'm going to switch to
14:40 - server mode by clicking on current
14:41 - client going to go to the properties
14:44 - sorry go to the Explorer find my player
14:46 - find my leader stats go to my cache I'm
14:49 - going to set it to
14:51 - 500 and go back to current client mode I
14:55 - walk over
14:56 - here and you can see that the dropper
15:01 - button is not there although the text
15:05 - above it is and that's cuz we just
15:06 - forgot to turn that off um but I can
15:08 - walk over it technically sorry you can't
15:11 - see that I just realized technically uh
15:13 - you can see the the text is there but
15:15 - the button isn't but the button is still
15:17 - there like if I get the uh select tool
15:19 - out and hold down uh alt you'll see it's
15:22 - here um the button is here I can step on
15:25 - it whatever it's just not working
15:27 - because it's set to be transparent
15:29 - and in the properties panel you can see
15:31 - that the hidden property is true now let
15:34 - me just walk over I'm going to try and
15:35 - keep it in view okay um you can't see my
15:39 - character but if you just watch closely
15:41 - I'm about to step on the conveyor button
15:42 - which is right here if you watch this
15:44 - hidden attribute I just step on it okay
15:47 - I've bought the
15:49 - conveyor uh however the uh dropper
15:53 - button is still not appearing so let's
15:56 - go and fix that
15:59 - so firstly let's fix the text appearing
16:01 - above the button so we go to the plot
16:03 - Handler we go to the if statement here
16:06 - where we set the transparency and we're
16:08 - just going to say uh button. billboard
16:12 - gy. enabled equals false okay so that's
16:15 - the first part done secondly we need to
16:19 - set the
16:21 - buttons hidden attribute to be false
16:24 - when the player buys an item so we'll
16:27 - just scroll down here to the item IDs to
16:30 - appear once bought this is where we left
16:32 - it right we left it here uh because we
16:35 - had a comment that we wanted to make the
16:36 - button
16:37 - visible so we can now say button.
16:40 - transparency equals z button. billboard
16:43 - GUI enabled equals true and button. can
16:48 - cide equals
16:49 - true uh and also button set attributes
16:54 - hidden and we can just set this to nil
16:57 - uh and that should just remove it I
16:59 - believe uh or you could set it to false
17:01 - it doesn't really matter I think nil
17:03 - will just remove it um so let's uh I
17:07 - think that's all good so what we're
17:09 - going to want to do is we're going to
17:10 - want to go back to the plugins data
17:13 - store
17:14 - editor and then we're going to put in my
17:16 - data player
17:19 - data uh and then player uncore 14943
17:23 - 069 and then I'm just going to delete
17:27 - the items table because I want to keep
17:29 - my cash at 450 I don't want to have to
17:30 - bother with you know setting my cash
17:33 - again on the server and all that um so
17:35 - if we go
17:36 - back and click on
17:39 - play and we're just going have to walk
17:41 - over again this time you can see that
17:44 - the text above the billboard is gone of
17:46 - the button that was hidden so that's a
17:47 - good thing um and hopefully when we step
17:52 - on this button if we just go back to
17:55 - have a look at our button which is
17:57 - hidden over there you have a look at the
17:59 - hidden property you just watch this
18:01 - hidden property when I step on the
18:03 - button okay I'm going step on it uh it
18:07 - is still true for some reason
18:10 - hm okay um well we're going to have to
18:12 - look into
18:13 - that so for some reason the dropper
18:16 - button is still um true and I I have a
18:21 - feeling this might be because the when
18:23 - we do the string dos split on the item
18:27 - IDs
18:28 - these are still strings aren't they um
18:31 - they're not
18:32 - numbers and we are sending this uh Item
18:36 - ID to our function but this item ID is
18:38 - still technically a string because it
18:40 - was a string when we set it in the item
18:44 - IDs to appear once bought we only just
18:46 - split it up so that we had um separated
18:51 - the IDS but they were they're still
18:52 - strings so let's see what happens if we
18:57 - change these to be a string we say item
19:01 - id equals two number item id this will
19:04 - change it from a string to a number so
19:07 - let's go back let's go back to the data
19:09 - store editor just look up my player
19:14 - data player1 14943 069 and this is
19:18 - really uh what debugging is about like
19:21 - you know it only took me a couple of
19:23 - seconds to realize what the problem was
19:25 - here but for you watching this video you
19:27 - might have been stuck on this problem
19:29 - for a very long time it might have even
19:31 - driven you to give up because it's not
19:33 - something you can just see it's
19:35 - something you have to know because you
19:36 - have to think uh logically and you have
19:39 - to think about the reasons why something
19:41 - might be going wrong and all of the
19:43 - underlying causes um which is a key
19:46 - skill in programming really so that's
19:49 - why I leave these sort of problems in
19:50 - the video uh and you can see if you just
19:53 - missed that I stepped on the
19:55 - conveyor and uh The Dropper button has
19:57 - now uh appeared which means it is
19:59 - working um which is perfect so if we now
20:02 - step on the dropper we can purchase that
20:05 - and uh there we go we've just managed to
20:07 - set up uh buttons which uh unlock
20:10 - themselves uh once you've uh unlocked
20:13 - another button which is uh really cool
20:15 - so let's just click on stop and let's
20:17 - load our plot one more time just to make
20:20 - sure everything's going
20:25 - well and there you go it all seems to be
20:27 - working perfectly so uh there you go
20:30 - that's how you add a set of buttons that
20:33 - keep on unlocking other buttons all you
20:35 - have to do is just add the hidden
20:39 - attribute uh uh to the to the button
20:41 - that you want to hide and then on the
20:43 - button which you want to um step on to
20:46 - unlock more items you add the item IDs
20:49 - to appear once bought make sure it's a
20:51 - string uh that way you can set it to
20:53 - unlock multiple items uh and we can test
20:56 - this actually uh if we change this to
20:59 - two and comma 1 so it also unlocks the
21:02 - painting and then we add the uh hidden
21:07 - you have to add the hidden billboard as
21:09 - well attribute to the item as well uh
21:13 - that you want to hide um we can try this
21:16 - one last
21:17 - time just going to reset my data layer
21:21 - data layer 14943
21:24 - 069 delete delete
21:28 - uh and if you don't know what your
21:30 - Roblox user ID is go to your Roblox
21:32 - profile and it will appear in the
21:35 - URL alternatively you can just go to
21:39 - players choose your player and it's
21:42 - right here character appearance ID so
21:44 - that's how you find it it's worth
21:46 - memorizing I know mine off by heart uh
21:49 - and if you're a developer you probably
21:50 - also know yours uh so we'll just give
21:53 - ourselves some cash on the server
21:59 - and you can notice that the painting
22:01 - button is also gone um so what should
22:03 - happen is when we step on the uh
22:08 - conveyor uh it should appear both the
22:12 - dropper and the
22:15 - um both the dropper and the painting now
22:18 - I also want to test one more thing which
22:20 - is now that we've unlocked the
22:21 - buttons uh if we leave and
22:24 - rejoin are they going to still be there
22:27 - now I have a hunch that they
22:29 - won't no they are gone and this is a
22:32 - flaw so this would break the game
22:34 - because if you have unlocked the buttons
22:37 - but you've not unlocked the items they
22:39 - are gone for good so how are we going to
22:42 - solve
22:43 - this well really we just need to take
22:46 - this code that we've written already
22:49 - which will unlock the items when you
22:50 - step on the button and up here when we
22:54 - load in all of the buttons we have this
22:56 - if statement that checks to see if the
22:58 - item's already been unlocked and we just
23:00 - continue if that's the case however just
23:03 - before the continue I think if we paste
23:05 - this
23:06 - here uh it should just load the buttons
23:09 - so I want to test this let's just see if
23:11 - this works because this would be a
23:13 - really quick fix if that is the case so
23:15 - let's click on the play button and see
23:17 - what
23:21 - happens okay we have an error which says
23:24 - buttons is not a valid member of part
23:26 - let's have a look into that that so line
23:30 - 18 uh line 18 line
23:34 - 95
23:39 - um apologies I also just realized you
23:42 - couldn't see what I just uh typed in but
23:44 - all I did was I went and took this code
23:47 - which is here um for the item IDs to
23:51 - appear once sport I've copied it and
23:53 - I've just pasted it up here so apologies
23:55 - about that um so yeah so we have a
23:58 - problem on line 18 here let's go to line
24:02 - 18 line
24:04 - 18 okay uh plot do buttons buttons is
24:09 - not a valid member of plot one uh
24:13 - okay uh plots buttons so there should be
24:17 - a but so ah it's because I think the uh
24:20 - buttons
24:21 - folder is not yet in the
24:26 - plot um
24:28 - okay yeah so let's take this code and
24:31 - we'll just remove it so it was as you
24:32 - were you don't have to worry about
24:34 - changing any of this um but I'm just
24:37 - going to take that code I'm going to
24:38 - wait until we've looped through all of
24:40 - the buttons and I'm going to do another
24:42 - loop uh once the buttons folder has been
24:45 - added to the plot I'm going to say 4core
24:49 - button in template buttons get children
24:53 - do I'm going to
24:56 - paste uh I'm going going to
24:59 - um hold on I'm going to
25:01 - take this again this uh condition which
25:06 - checks to see if um the items ID of the
25:10 - buttons item id of item to unlock is in
25:13 - the item ID's table which means they own
25:17 - the button and they've unlocked
25:19 - it and then this will um make they
25:24 - should make the items appear that are in
25:27 - the buttons ID of items to appear once
25:30 - bought it should make them appear just
25:32 - like we do at this part of the script
25:34 - when you tap on the button so let's
25:36 - click on play
25:39 - again
25:41 - and okay there we go so it seems to be
25:43 - working
25:45 - now uh the items are indeed the buttons
25:49 - are indeed appearing last time they
25:51 - weren't so that seems to be working just
25:55 - fine and we will try it one more time
25:57 - from a new save just to be completely
26:00 - sure it's always good to test make sure
26:03 - everything is working so plugins data
26:06 - store editor and then player data and
26:10 - then player1 14943 069 we're just going
26:14 - to remove the items table and click on
26:16 - Save we'll rejoin I'm going to click on
26:19 - play here just to teleport me straight
26:21 - to the
26:22 - plot
26:25 - and there we go so we now going to walk
26:28 - over and the only button that appears is
26:32 - of course the starter item but we now
26:35 - have our other two buttons appearing
26:37 - going to click on stop and then going to
26:40 - rejoin just to make sure it's all good
26:42 - it's all
26:46 - working and there we go all good seems
26:50 - to be working I'm going to leave
26:51 - again play one more
26:54 - time so this time the painting should
26:56 - load the conveyor should load and the
26:59 - dropper button should load but the
27:00 - dropper shouldn't be there and it all
27:02 - seems to be working perfectly fine so
27:05 - that was how to add um extra buttons
27:09 - which appear once you've unlocked an
27:10 - item I know we haven't added the um the
27:14 - item name yet to the uh to the uh
27:17 - billboard
27:18 - GUI uh but we'll we'll get to that I
27:21 - mean I'll show you I'll show you how to
27:22 - do it right now um all you need to say
27:26 - is button billboard
27:29 - GUI
27:31 - dot text label. text
27:36 - equals
27:39 - um uh uh get item from template
27:45 - plot
27:47 - um button get
27:51 - attributes ID of item to
27:54 - unlock do name or empty string just in
27:58 - case it doesn't exist and then if you
28:00 - click on play
28:03 - here ah I've just realized all of my
28:05 - buttons I've been purchased um so I'm
28:08 - going to have to reset my data one more
28:11 - time I will just speed up the video for
28:13 - this part okay I've just reset my data
28:16 - and I'm going to join the
28:19 - game and there you go it now has the
28:21 - name of the item above the button so it
28:23 - says conveyor I purchase the conveyor
28:26 - and then suddenly The Dropper appear
28:27 - appears and then the painting appears
28:30 - perfect so there you go that was how to
28:32 - add sub buttons into your Tycoon I hope
