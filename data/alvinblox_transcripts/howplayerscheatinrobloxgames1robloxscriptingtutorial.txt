00:00 - okay in this video I'm going to show you
00:02 - how people cheat or exploit in Roblox
00:05 - games so usually what happens here is
00:08 - you have remote events which let clients
00:11 - and server communicate with each other
00:13 - you might have a remote event for
00:14 - example which gives you some cash right
00:17 - say you step on a a button okay um
00:21 - actually that's not a good example uh a
00:23 - good example would
00:25 - be uh buy item okay so if we had a
00:28 - remote event that buys item and say
00:30 - game. replicated storage bu item blah
00:34 - blah blah okay player
00:38 - whatever what happens is so you have you
00:42 - have the cost of the item which is
00:43 - stored on the server and the player will
00:46 - fire this remote event because they want
00:47 - to buy an item and you don't check on
00:50 - the server to see if they have enough
00:51 - money you just give it to them straight
00:53 - away so this is like one of the number
00:55 - one ways that that the games get
00:57 - exploited because you don't do proper
00:59 - check on the server before you give the
01:02 - player the item okay and what happens is
01:05 - you know you might have um you know what
01:09 - happens to to fix this is you would just
01:10 - literally say if player. leer stats doc.
01:14 - Val is greater than or equal to item
01:17 - cost then you would give them the item
01:20 - okay it's as simple as that but a lot of
01:23 - the time developers would check this on
01:26 - the client okay when they press the
01:28 - button they check it on the client but
01:29 - that's no good because exploiters can
01:32 - just fire the remote event from their
01:34 - their own software right so they will
01:36 - basically jump over your little check in
01:39 - the button so you have to do the checks
01:41 - on the server to make sure that the
01:43 - player has actually got enough um coins
01:48 - because the player can change their
01:50 - coins value or their cash value on their
01:53 - end from using their exploit equipment
01:55 - you know if if if I'm an exploiter I can
01:57 - change my cash to say .5 billion when in
02:01 - fact if you look at it on the server I
02:04 - actually only have zero cash still so
02:06 - they can on their end on the client's
02:08 - end they can make it look like they have
02:10 - enough money and so if you're not
02:11 - checking this on the server all right
02:14 - then um you know because when they
02:16 - change something on their end the server
02:18 - rejects that change so the server is not
02:21 - going to accept that change which is why
02:23 - it says that they have 1 billion cash
02:26 - but to the rest of the game and to the
02:28 - other players they still have zero
02:30 - because the server doesn't let that go
02:32 - through um so if you check things on the
02:36 - server then you're obviously not going
02:37 - to let the player um get around that so
02:40 - that's just a very simple explanation of
02:42 - one of the ways in which Roblox games
02:45 - are uh vulnerable uh typically new
02:48 - developers will realize this they might
02:50 - release a game realize that it's super
02:52 - easy to um to break through and uh give
02:55 - things to exploiters so I think I'll do
02:57 - a couple more videos on this explaining
03:00 - ways in which uh you can secure up your
03:03 - Roblox games so let me know uh what
03:05 - other sort of videos you'd like to see
03:07 - as always subscribe and I'll see you in
03:09 - the next one
