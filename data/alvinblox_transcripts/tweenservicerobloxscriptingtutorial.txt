00:01 - okay so tween service is a really useful
00:04 - way of animating things in Roblox so
00:07 - that could be objects if you want to
00:09 - move them for example or guis as well so
00:12 - if you wanted to smoothly have a UI that
00:15 - fades in Fades out flies in whatever all
00:18 - of that will be done by tween service so
00:21 - let's firstly show you how to use it on
00:24 - something such as a part so you're
00:26 - firstly going to need to get the tween
00:28 - service which is just a simpl saying uh
00:31 - game get service tween service and then
00:34 - all you have to do is say tween service
00:37 - C on Create and this creates the tween
00:40 - and we will put some information in here
00:42 - to tell the script uh Which object or
00:46 - instance we want the tween to play on
00:50 - we'll give a tween info which is a set
00:53 - of properties about how fast the tween
00:56 - should be what style of tween what style
00:59 - of animation
01:00 - and then finally we'll give the
01:02 - properties that we want to animate so
01:05 - we're just going to firstly put our
01:06 - spawn location in here because that's
01:08 - what I want to animate or tween and then
01:12 - secondly we're going to do the tween
01:13 - info so we say tween info. new and this
01:16 - lets you put in the time easing style
01:19 - easing Direction and a load of other
01:21 - properties but for now we're going to
01:22 - leave that as just having the time
01:25 - because I'm going to have this set to be
01:27 - half a second and then we're going to
01:30 - have a table for the properties that
01:31 - we're going to change but we won't put
01:33 - anything in that table for now we'll
01:34 - just close it off with the closing
01:36 - bracket and then to play the tween we
01:40 - put another colon and we say play like
01:42 - this okay so this is a quite a sped up
01:45 - way of doing it because normally what
01:47 - you might do is you might uh not have
01:50 - the play here you might instead want to
01:52 - store this as a variable and then you
01:54 - could say tween colon play like this
01:57 - either of them work uh but what we
02:00 - actually need to do is we need to tell
02:01 - the script what we want to change about
02:03 - this part so if we want to move it for
02:05 - example let's say we want to move it up
02:08 - in the air by 10 studs we would just put
02:12 - um C frame equals cframe do new 01 0 and
02:18 - this is a position in the world it's not
02:20 - saying move it by X Y or Z amount on
02:24 - each axis this is an actual position so
02:26 - it's moving it to these coordinates and
02:29 - so so what will happen is when we click
02:31 - on play we click on run even you'll
02:35 - notice it moves very quickly up to that
02:38 - position so if we just head back to the
02:41 - script let's change the time to 3
02:44 - seconds and just see what happens there
02:46 - it should make it a lot slower so we can
02:48 - actually see it in progress and there it
02:50 - is so it's moving to that position if we
02:53 - move the spawn location further away
02:56 - it's going to move from that location to
02:59 - the same position of 0 10
03:02 - 0 so what else can we do here well of
03:05 - course you could add some other
03:07 - properties I think you can also change
03:10 - things such as um colors I mean we can
03:12 - give it a go let just say color 3 equals
03:15 - color 3 from RGB
03:19 - 25500 let's see what
03:24 - happens okay nothing happened must must
03:26 - be an error that must not be must must
03:28 - be unable to do that oh no you can't
03:30 - it's because uh the uh the property is
03:32 - color not color three my bad let's try
03:35 - this one more
03:36 - time cck on run and you can see it
03:39 - slowly twns to that color so you can
03:42 - tween colors you can tween C frames I
03:45 - can't say I've ever twe a color which is
03:47 - why I was uh wondering whether it would
03:49 - work or not so we can tween C frames
03:51 - color um loads of other properties as
03:54 - well things that are number properties
03:56 - can obviously be Tweed I'm talking about
03:58 - things like trans parency
04:01 - uh
04:03 - reflectance all of these different
04:04 - properties you can tween and because
04:07 - this is all these properties are in the
04:08 - part of the same tween here they will be
04:11 - controlled by the tween info so if you
04:15 - wanted the tween to be faster you would
04:17 - just make this number uh a lot smaller
04:20 - so for example 0.1 would be a tenth of a
04:23 - second
04:25 - um what you've also got is you can do
04:27 - easing
04:28 - styles easing Styles control the type of
04:33 - Animation there's loads of different
04:34 - easing Styles it's basically a way of
04:37 - determining how quick or slow you want
04:40 - the twe to start out and how quickly it
04:42 - should accelerate or how slowly it
04:44 - should accelerate to its goal and if you
04:46 - want to see a visualization of these
04:49 - easing Styles there's a great website
04:50 - for it uh called eings Donnet which I'll
04:54 - bring on screen right now eings Donnet
04:56 - let me just bring it
04:58 - up okay here it is is so all you need to
05:00 - do is you just hover over one to see
05:03 - what the animation looks like you can
05:05 - see this little indicator here moving
05:07 - along the chart that will sort of give
05:09 - you an indication of how fast or slow um
05:12 - the the the easing style is so there's
05:16 - an easing style which is the um word at
05:20 - the end here so s cubic Quint Circ
05:24 - elastic and then you have the easing
05:26 - Direction which is basically in out or
05:28 - in out and if you have a look at the
05:30 - different easing directions um you can
05:33 - see they move at a different rate so
05:36 - just choose the one you want I'm going
05:37 - to choose uh in out
05:40 - sign in fact I'm going to go for this
05:42 - one because it starts off quite quickly
05:44 - ease out Quint so we want Quint and we
05:47 - want out so we're going to go back to
05:49 - roblock we want the easing style which
05:52 - is Quint and we want the easing
05:55 - direction of out and these are enums so
05:58 - it's a a pre preset choice for you you
06:01 - just have to say enum doing style. Quint
06:04 - or enum doing direction. out if you
06:07 - don't want to use these ones that's fine
06:09 - you can choose from all of these
06:10 - different ones I'm going to still stick
06:12 - to uh quintz though and same with the
06:16 - easing Direction you've got in out or in
06:19 - out which is a combination of them so
06:21 - just play around see which easing Styles
06:23 - you like uh and then click on run and
06:25 - you should see that it accelerated from
06:29 - that position to over here much much
06:32 - faster than before so the easing style
06:35 - and the easing Direction allows you to
06:37 - choose your own custom function for rate
06:43 - of change or acceleration so if you want
06:46 - something to bounce you've got some
06:48 - bouncy ones if you want a to slow a slow
06:52 - start but then a fast ending uh all the
06:55 - other way around this will help you and
06:57 - it's pretty Universal this isn't a
06:59 - Roblox documentation website but it
07:02 - applies to most programming languages so
07:05 - just find a few that you like and you
07:08 - know you'll have fun using them with
07:10 - with tween service now what you can also
07:12 - do is you can stop a tween halfway
07:15 - through let's imagine our tween is 10
07:17 - seconds long and we suddenly want to
07:18 - stop it well as long as we've got it
07:20 - stored as a variable so we can do things
07:22 - to it after it's been created we could
07:25 - stop it early you could say tween uh you
07:28 - could say tween pause if you wanted to
07:30 - that would pause the tween after say 3
07:33 - seconds here I'll just show you so the
07:36 - tween starts after 3 seconds though it
07:38 - suddenly pauses it hasn't gotten to the
07:40 - destination yet uh and maybe you want to
07:44 - restart it after a short pause that's
07:46 - fine you can just say
07:48 - twe play like this and it will start
07:51 - playing again after it paused and
07:54 - finally what you can also do just see
07:57 - there it starts moving again after two
07:58 - seconds what you will also be interested
08:02 - in is you can completely stop it all
08:05 - together so you can say cancel and that
08:08 - will just cancel the tween it's over
08:10 - okay that will delete it and it will be
08:13 - it will be gone okay you don't have to
08:14 - worry about it anymore but the last
08:17 - thing I wanted to show you was you can
08:19 - also have an event called tween do
08:21 - completed which will fire when the tween
08:24 - is
08:25 - done so you might want to have some code
08:28 - that runs when the tween is finished
08:30 - that's fine you just put it into this
08:31 - event now one thing to note is if you
08:34 - have a tween when you uh play the tween
08:38 - the script will just move on to the next
08:39 - line it won't yield so it won't wait
08:42 - here at this line for the tween to
08:43 - finish it will just move on so rather
08:45 - than wait for 10 seconds it will play
08:47 - the tween in the background almost like
08:50 - creating a second thread and we'll just
08:52 - move on with the rest of the script so
08:54 - as you can see we wait for the event to
08:58 - fire that the tween is finished
09:02 - and there it is tween is done okay it
09:05 - took a little bit of time because the
09:08 - easing style that we used meant that it
09:10 - went really slowly towards the end there
09:13 - and it hadn't completely finished but
09:15 - when it has finished it will print out
09:17 - that the tween is done okay so that was
09:19 - a very very brief introduction into
09:21 - tween
09:22 - service now same thing applies to guis
09:26 - you just put your GUI element into here
09:29 - and then you might want to change some
09:31 - properties such as the position which
09:33 - would be a udm 2 value or the
09:36 - transparency or other number values like
09:38 - I say they're numbers so you would just
09:40 - input the number you want and it will
09:42 - tween so fairly straightforward standard
09:44 - practice might do another video on GUI
09:47 - tween in the future let me know if you'd
09:49 - like to see that but that was the tween
09:51 - service hopefully you found it useful
09:53 - and I'll see you in the next one
