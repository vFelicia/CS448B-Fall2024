00:00 - welcome to the first scripting tutorial
00:02 - in this series so this series is gonna
00:05 - teach you how to script on roblox it
00:08 - doesn't matter whether you are a
00:09 - beginner you have a little bit of
00:10 - knowledge or there are just a few things
00:12 - which you want to learn you don't
00:14 - already this series is for anyone really
00:16 - and we're gonna be going over in detail
00:19 - everything to do with roblox scripting
00:22 - so that you can become a pro alright so
00:26 - let's open up our box to do if you don't
00:28 - have it installed you can go get it from
00:30 - roblox
00:31 - although if you played a robot's game
00:32 - before chances are it's probably
00:33 - installed on your computer I've also got
00:36 - another video going over the basics of
00:37 - studio and how to install it which I'll
00:39 - link in the card and description but
00:41 - let's go and open it up and usually to
00:44 - wait it's usually quite quick you might
00:48 - have to login if it's your first time
00:49 - but don't worry if you see a screen like
00:51 - this as well just ignore it we're gonna
00:54 - go and click on baseplate and that will
00:56 - just give us a blank area to work in
00:59 - okay so in this video the first video in
01:03 - the series we're going to be looking at
01:05 - properties and what properties are to
01:08 - begin with you need to have these two
01:11 - panels enabled okay these two panels are
01:16 - the Explorer panel and the properties
01:18 - panel and to enable them you need to
01:20 - click on View at the top in this ribbon
01:23 - menu and then you should just be able to
01:26 - click Explorer and properties and that
01:28 - will open them up like this okay so the
01:31 - Explorer and properties window they are
01:34 - the most important panels you'll be
01:37 - using when you create games and the
01:40 - Explorer lets you search for and see all
01:43 - of the objects stored in your game and
01:45 - the properties window lets you change
01:49 - them so how they look or how they
01:52 - function okay so properties there are
01:56 - lots of different objects in roblox
02:00 - studio ok to get a list of all these
02:03 - objects you can go on the model tab and
02:05 - click on advanced objects just make that
02:09 - a little bit bigger and here we go there
02:11 - are loads of
02:13 - objects which you can insert into your
02:15 - game they do different things
02:17 - now each objects will have properties
02:19 - which contain which contains information
02:22 - about what they do how they look
02:26 - etc okay so we're going to insert a part
02:30 - to begin with all right so you can
02:33 - either insert a part by finding it in
02:35 - advanced objects you can either look for
02:37 - it or search for at the top or you can
02:40 - just click on parts over here okay and
02:43 - that's just one way what a few ways to
02:45 - insert a part so we're going to be
02:47 - focusing on a part today we're going to
02:49 - worry about all these other objects
02:51 - we'll get to them in a future video but
02:53 - we're going to be using a script to
02:55 - manipulate and do some cool things with
02:58 - this part by changing its properties so
03:00 - to have a look at a part or any other
03:04 - objects properties you just need to
03:06 - select it okay so you can click it or
03:08 - you can locate it in the workspace for
03:11 - example if you didn't know where this
03:12 - part was or you have lots of parts in
03:15 - your games and it was hard to find a
03:16 - certain one you could just look in the
03:18 - workspace or you could search for it
03:20 - okay and that will find all of the
03:24 - objects with the name that you searched
03:26 - for so once you've found your parts you
03:29 - can press F on the keyboard and that
03:31 - will move the camera directly to to this
03:34 - object so you can see we have lots of
03:38 - properties in the properties window so
03:41 - we have properties for its appearance
03:43 - which change how the part looks such as
03:47 - the color of the brick you have brick
03:49 - color which is a set of colors from from
03:52 - a palette which you can choose from or
03:53 - if you want a more detailed color you
03:55 - can awfully pick one in this RGB picker
03:58 - things like material as well you can
04:00 - change the material of the part
04:02 - reflectance as well which if I set it to
04:05 - something like smooth plastic it's
04:07 - basically reflecting the light in the
04:09 - game say from from the Sun and things
04:12 - like transparency as well we've got data
04:15 - properties such as the name of the parts
04:17 - so I could change the name to be hello
04:20 - and you can see the name of the part
04:23 - that's changed so that's what we
04:25 - reference with we reference the name to
04:28 - find the specific parts we've also got
04:31 - orientation which basically is the
04:33 - amount of degrees it's been rotated if
04:35 - you use the tools up here things like
04:37 - position velocity we won't really get
04:39 - into that today but we have some
04:42 - important properties which you need to
04:44 - know
04:44 - okay so anchored is a property and the
04:48 - anchored property if it is set to if
04:52 - it's checked then the part is going to
04:55 - stay in the air okay it's gonna stay
04:56 - fixed in the air but if we set anchored
04:59 - to unchecked it's gonna fall out of the
05:01 - sky okay so anchor just means that it's
05:03 - it's locked in its position and it's not
05:05 - going to be affected by say like
05:08 - collisions if it if it hits something
05:10 - then this brick isn't going to move
05:12 - because it's it's it's frozen in the air
05:14 - we've got can collide and can collide is
05:18 - it determines whether a part will
05:21 - collide with another part if it hits
05:23 - something okay so we've got count
05:25 - collide set to true on both of these
05:27 - parts now let's just change the color if
05:30 - I get this part and I uncheck can
05:32 - collide then the red part is going to
05:34 - just fall into it like this okay in fact
05:38 - the green part fell out of the world
05:39 - because it's not colliding with the base
05:41 - plate either so they are important
05:45 - properties which you need to know and
05:47 - we've also got size but we're not going
05:48 - to focus on on those today there they
05:51 - are just some simple properties and you
05:53 - can see that by changing these
05:55 - properties the part looks and acts in a
05:59 - different way okay let's just make it
06:01 - transparent and sorry opaque and not
06:05 - reflective but we had to manually change
06:08 - those properties okay but in a roblox
06:11 - game that's running we can't just
06:15 - manually change these properties we have
06:17 - to use a script because a script can
06:20 - automatically change these properties
06:22 - for us and automate our game every
06:26 - roblox game that you play such as
06:28 - jailbreak or death run has got a script
06:31 - running behind the scenes which is
06:33 - making the game work so like running the
06:35 - rounds
06:36 - checking to see if he's worn the game
06:37 - etc and it's always changing properties
06:41 - because properties is one of the most
06:44 - basic things you need to know to even
06:46 - get scripting so a script allows us to
06:49 - carry a carry out tasks in a specific
06:53 - order we can tell the game what we want
06:56 - to happen and then the game will be able
06:58 - to do these things and run itself
07:01 - automatically so let's insert a script
07:04 - into server script service so we're
07:06 - going to click on the plus and then
07:08 - click script we're not going to do
07:10 - module script just a script okay now as
07:14 - I said a script will carry out tasks in
07:17 - order
07:18 - okay so whichever line comes first that
07:21 - line will be the one which is executed
07:24 - or run first
07:26 - so to change properties of a part let's
07:30 - say we're going to change the property
07:31 - or some properties of this
07:33 - hello part which we created okay we're
07:35 - going to need to reference this part and
07:37 - reference just means tell the script
07:41 - where this part is because the script we
07:44 - can't just say hello and then we can't
07:47 - just we can just say that okay we have
07:49 - to reference it and tell the script
07:51 - where this part is located and that
07:53 - always comes first so in our script
07:55 - we're going to firstly get this part and
07:58 - to get it to reference it we firstly
08:01 - need to say where the part is stored so
08:06 - it's stored inside the workspace the
08:08 - workspace is a store for all of the
08:11 - parts and things that you see in the
08:14 - game okay for example if I take Hello
08:16 - out and I put it somewhere like
08:18 - replicated storage we can't see it okay
08:20 - so workspace is where all of the parts
08:22 - that are currently in the game world
08:24 - being rendered are okay so everything
08:27 - that you see in your game will be in the
08:31 - workspace so we just need to get this
08:36 - part which is inside of the workspace
08:37 - now the workspace is a service and there
08:41 - are loads of different services here you
08:42 - can see all of these ones here and these
08:45 - services they do lots of different
08:46 - things they house different objects for
08:48 - different reasons but all of these
08:50 - all of these services they are together
08:54 - stored inside something called the game
08:57 - okay so if you think of our services as
09:00 - being in the pink squirt square and then
09:04 - we have our game which is the outer
09:09 - scope okay so everything in the pink box
09:13 - switch sauce services such as the
09:15 - workspace the lighting etc they are a
09:18 - part of game so whenever we want to
09:21 - reference it we have to say game first
09:24 - okay so we say game and then we can do a
09:28 - dot and a dot and allows us to reference
09:32 - something that's inside of of game or
09:35 - the thing before the dot okay so if we
09:39 - said workspace okay which is after the
09:41 - dot workspace is inside of game and game
09:45 - is its parent okay
09:46 - and workspace is known as the child so
09:49 - game dot workspace we've just referenced
09:52 - the service but we now want to get the
09:55 - part called hello which is which is
09:57 - inside of the workspace now hello is
10:00 - going to be a child of the workspace as
10:02 - it's inside of it and workspace is the
10:04 - parent so we're gonna do another dot
10:06 - because we want to get something from
10:08 - the workspace and we're gonna just get
10:10 - the name of the part which is hello and
10:12 - you can see world looks to do begins to
10:15 - it begins to autofill the the result so
10:19 - we just write out hello and we have just
10:22 - referenced our part in a script it's
10:25 - just the same as selecting a part and
10:27 - now we can see all of its properties
10:29 - that we can change okay when we don't
10:31 - when we haven't clicked on a part we
10:33 - haven't referenced it and the game
10:35 - doesn't know what we want to change so
10:37 - we have to tell it what we what we want
10:39 - to change
10:39 - okay so we've selected it and now we can
10:41 - see its properties and that's that's
10:43 - pretty much the same as what we've just
10:44 - done here in the script so now if we do
10:47 - a dot
10:48 - we know that the properties are a part
10:50 - of that part of that of the brick called
10:52 - hello so if we do a dots you can see the
10:56 - script it starts to autofill all of
10:59 - these different properties which can
11:00 - change look we've got transparency
11:03 - anchored and brick color so you can
11:06 - choose any of these properties so we're
11:09 - going to we're gonna do a couple
11:11 - properties to begin with only you could
11:14 - prove oh just to keep it simple so the
11:16 - property that we're gonna change first
11:17 - is transparency okay and all properties
11:22 - aren't the same they take different
11:24 - types of data okay so for example we
11:27 - have transparency over here and you can
11:29 - see the amount of transparency which
11:32 - this part has transparency is basically
11:35 - whether it's see-through or not you can
11:38 - see it's a number so we could have 0
11:40 - which means no transparency at all we
11:42 - can't see through it or one which means
11:45 - fully transparent so any number between
11:48 - 0 and 1 is going to affect the
11:50 - transparency so not 0.5 would be half
11:52 - transparent okay so it's a number
11:55 - transparency is a number property okay
11:59 - because the value it takes which changes
12:02 - how the part looks is a number okay
12:05 - whereas something like the name property
12:07 - isn't a number it's a piece of text but
12:10 - we call a piece of text a string okay so
12:13 - if you want to change the transparency
12:15 - of this part we know we have to give it
12:17 - a number so we've referenced the
12:19 - property and now we want to set it to a
12:22 - new value and because it's a number
12:25 - we're going to say equal to so we're
12:27 - making this track this this property
12:29 - equal to a new number a new value and so
12:32 - we just put the new value after the
12:34 - equal sign so I'm gonna set it to 1
12:37 - which means fully transparent okay now
12:40 - if we just go back to the game and we
12:44 - select our parts let's just set it to
12:48 - completely opaque so we can we can't see
12:52 - through it and now we can run our script
12:55 - to see if we've successfully been able
12:58 - to change the transparency so we're
13:01 - going to click on the Home tab here and
13:04 - then click on this arrow which is
13:07 - underneath run it might say play so
13:09 - click on the arrow and click on run run
13:11 - basically lets us run all the scripts in
13:14 - our game without having to join it so
13:17 - let's click run
13:18 - and there we go the part has gone fully
13:20 - transparent and we can see through it
13:22 - but it doesn't mean that the parts been
13:23 - deleted it's still there we just can't
13:25 - see through it because we can select it
13:27 - in the workspace and look it's still
13:29 - there and if we go ahead and change the
13:31 - transparency again you can see one it's
13:33 - at the end of the spectrum and as we
13:35 - move it further to the left
13:38 - it becomes opaque again and that script
13:40 - is only ran once once it's finished
13:43 - setting the transparency it will see
13:45 - that there's no lines left to execute so
13:49 - it will just stop running okay so that
13:51 - is a very very simple property
13:53 - transparency but I said there were other
13:55 - data types which properties take because
13:59 - not all properties are going to take a
14:01 - number for example the material property
14:04 - that is text but you can also select
14:09 - them from a drop-down so there are two
14:11 - ways to set the material of a of a part
14:16 - so we're just going to get rid of the
14:18 - dock transparency but this time we're
14:20 - going to set the material now the first
14:22 - way is just by putting the text okay the
14:25 - name of the material in quotation marks
14:28 - or speech marks okay so if this is
14:33 - smooth plastic that it's currently on
14:35 - and we want to set it to grass we could
14:37 - just write grass in here okay and if we
14:40 - go and run the game it's sure to change
14:42 - the property to grass there we go and if
14:46 - we click on the part again and have a
14:48 - look in the properties tab the script
14:50 - has automatically changed it to grass
14:52 - for us okay now the second way of doing
14:55 - this is by using an enum okay so an enum
14:58 - is kind of like it gives you a list of
15:01 - properties to choose from so you could
15:03 - write enum and then you could say dot
15:06 - and you then have to write the name of
15:09 - the property okay so I know we've
15:11 - written out before but we have to write
15:12 - out again for enum so when we write out
15:15 - and then do another dot it will give us
15:16 - a list of all of the materials just like
15:19 - when we typed in the property name sorry
15:21 - the the name of the parts it gave us a
15:23 - list of properties before we wrote the
15:26 - property so you can select a property so
15:29 - material here such as wood
15:31 - that will do the exact same thing okay
15:33 - it will set the property so there's two
15:35 - ways for you and can choose whichever
15:37 - one works for you I prefer doing it this
15:39 - way because it gives you a list of
15:40 - materials but you can you can use enums
15:43 - for all types of properties well all
15:46 - types of like drop-down properties like
15:47 - this okay where you can select one from
15:50 - from a list and we you also have brick
15:54 - color so there's two ways to change the
15:56 - color of parts so you could either do
15:58 - brick color and brick color lets you set
16:01 - a preset color which from this palette
16:04 - okay if you click on brick color you can
16:06 - see a list of all these colors and each
16:08 - color has a name which represents its
16:10 - RGB value an RGB value is just a set of
16:13 - three values red green and blue and it
16:16 - makes it one big color but brick color
16:18 - is simpler than that
16:19 - and it just gives you the name of the
16:20 - color so to set a brick color we
16:23 - obviously have to say the name of the
16:24 - property but we can't say it in speech
16:27 - marks like this because brick color is a
16:29 - special type of property and we have to
16:31 - say Bricker dot new because because it's
16:35 - roblox's color palette and this is the
16:37 - way of picking the color so you say
16:39 - brick color and then you say dot new the
16:41 - new in lowercase and then you have a set
16:44 - of parentheses or brackets after it and
16:46 - then in quotation marks or speech marks
16:48 - inside of these brackets you can write
16:51 - the name of the color but it has to be a
16:53 - color from their palette and has to be
16:55 - spelled correctly with the
16:57 - capitalization correct as well you can
16:59 - see we have a capital R for really but
17:01 - then it goes lower case for red now if
17:03 - we go and try this out you can see the
17:05 - part that goes red alright and there's
17:08 - one more way of changing the color with
17:10 - this color palette if you wanted to give
17:11 - an RGB value so instead of saying brick
17:14 - color you could just say color and don't
17:16 - forget this is the American spelling so
17:18 - those of you that are British we spell
17:20 - it with a u you have to spell it Co lor
17:23 - the american way so when we set a color
17:26 - we can say color 3 because a color 3
17:30 - value is made up of three RGB values ok
17:33 - color 3 and then we can say dot from RGB
17:37 - and then we can give a number between 0
17:40 - and 255 for each color so the amount of
17:43 - red the amount of blue and
17:45 - Green and it will mix it together kind
17:47 - of imagine it like paints if you're
17:49 - mixing red green and blue paint you're
17:51 - also gonna get a color right so if you
17:54 - did 255 comma zero comma zero that would
17:57 - be completely red but um you shouldn't
17:59 - really have to understand this for now
18:00 - I'm just showing you how color 3 works
18:03 - and you can see if I choose a color on
18:06 - the color picker it gives me a red value
18:07 - green value and a blue value so 255 one
18:10 - five seven and thirty seven one five
18:14 - seven and thirty seven and that should
18:17 - give us the orange car yeah there we go
18:19 - so that's how you change the color now
18:22 - there's one last type of property I want
18:24 - to show you and that is the behavior
18:26 - properties so anchored archivable can
18:30 - collide locked masses etc they're all
18:33 - check boxes and a check box is either on
18:36 - or off so true or false so there's two
18:39 - values you can choose from and this is a
18:40 - boolean value a boolean value is either
18:44 - true or false it can't be anything else
18:46 - so if it's true then it's gonna be what
18:51 - if we were looking at the anchored
18:52 - property for example
18:54 - okay anchored and we set this to true if
18:57 - it's true then it means yes it is
18:59 - anchored but if it's false think of it
19:01 - as being unchecked or not I'm good
19:03 - so if we keep anchored as false and we
19:06 - lift it up into the air and we run the
19:07 - game it's going to fall straight to the
19:09 - ground but if we change anchor to true
19:12 - which means it is anchored and the
19:14 - anchored property is turned off then
19:16 - there you go it stays up in the air and
19:18 - you can see again in the properties
19:20 - window we have managed to change the
19:22 - property from script now you may be
19:24 - thinking this is really really simple
19:26 - can we just get into the really good
19:27 - stuff I know it's done that but we have
19:30 - to really go really really simple to
19:32 - begin with with the properties because
19:34 - then we can do really really cool stuff
19:36 - in the future use need to make sure you
19:38 - have a good understanding of how to
19:39 - reference okay by saying the service and
19:43 - then getting the name of the parts
19:44 - parents children and the property as
19:47 - well okay I think we're gonna leave it
