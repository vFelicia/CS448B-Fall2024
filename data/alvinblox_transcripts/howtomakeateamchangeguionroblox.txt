00:00 - today we're going to create a team
00:02 - change to you I like this one where you
00:03 - can open it up and select which team you
00:06 - want to switch - just like in jailbreak
00:09 - and other game so let's get straight
00:11 - into it so firstly let's make the GUI
00:14 - I'm gonna insert a screen GUI into
00:17 - started UI and I'm going to call it team
00:19 - change and then inside of that I'm gonna
00:22 - insert a frame
00:23 - okay now this frame I'm going to set the
00:26 - size to zero so not point three zero not
00:32 - point one seven five zero and that just
00:34 - scales it on the x and y axis and then
00:37 - I'm going to position it in the middle
00:39 - of the screen so we're going to set the
00:41 - anchor point to not point five zero
00:43 - point five so that goes into the middle
00:45 - and then we can position the anchor
00:47 - points and halfway down the screen by
00:50 - setting the position to not point five
00:52 - becomes zero at nor point 5 comma zero
00:55 - now that will put it in the middle of
00:57 - the screen and now we can insert our
00:59 - buttons so I'm gonna I'm gonna insert
01:02 - one text button for now this is going to
01:05 - be the team which we can choose if you
01:07 - want more than two teams then just keep
01:10 - adding these buttons but let's do the
01:11 - first one the first one is going to be
01:13 - for criminals so I'm just going to set
01:15 - it to criminals like that and let's just
01:21 - go and set the size of this this button
01:24 - so I'm going to set it to do not point
01:27 - for for the x-axis comma zero and then
01:30 - not point nine comma zero because we
01:31 - want it to take up the entirety or
01:33 - pretty much nearly all of the y-axis
01:35 - okay and then we can leave a little bit
01:37 - of white space for border so we're in
01:40 - the position I'm not going to set an
01:42 - anchor point because it's inside of that
01:43 - frame locked into it I'm instead gonna
01:46 - set the position to naught point naught
01:47 - three so it's just away from from the
01:49 - side comma 0 and then naught point
01:51 - naught 5 0 okay that'll put it with it
01:55 - with a nice bit of white space around it
01:57 - and I'm going to set the border size
01:59 - pixel to two and let's make the
02:01 - background yellow for criminals and
02:04 - let's just make text scaled checked we
02:08 - can change the font as well if you'd
02:09 - like and I'm going to call the text
02:12 - criminals okay
02:13 - and so we're gonna do exact same thing
02:15 - just copy this and paste it and this is
02:17 - gonna be the second team for the police
02:19 - so we'll change the name to police here
02:22 - and we'll change the position to nought
02:25 - point five seven comma zero and then
02:27 - comment naught point naught 5 comma zero
02:30 - and that will put it same place on the
02:32 - y-axis but just moving it along the x
02:34 - axis okay all right so now if we can go
02:38 - ahead and set the background color of
02:39 - three to a police color and we can
02:41 - change the text to say police okay so
02:45 - now we can start scripting it so let's
02:48 - insert a local script into here
02:51 - local Swift and inside of this local
02:53 - script we're just going to code it so
02:55 - when you click each button your team
02:57 - gets changed okay so first thing that
02:59 - we're gonna need to do is we're going to
03:00 - need to create a remote event okay so
03:02 - that we can tell the server that we want
03:05 - the players team to be changed okay so
03:07 - in replicated storage just add a remote
03:09 - event and I'm going to call this event
03:12 - change team all right
03:14 - so we're gonna say and this is a team
03:17 - change script now firstly we need to add
03:20 - our team's okay so to add the team's
03:23 - into the game we're gonna go back to the
03:24 - game and click on model go to service
03:28 - and make sure that the team service has
03:30 - been added then you can insert a team
03:33 - into this service so add one for police
03:35 - and add one for criminals but so what
03:39 - we've got to do is for each team we've
03:41 - got to assign it a team color so the
03:45 - criminals are going to have a team color
03:47 - of cyan sorry of orange bright orange
03:51 - and the police are going to have cyan
03:53 - and so when you want to assign a team to
03:56 - a player you change a property in in
03:58 - their in their player called the team
04:00 - color if we go into the players service
04:02 - here click on my player and scroll down
04:05 - you can see team color if I was to
04:07 - change that to orange I'd go into the
04:09 - criminals team so we're actually just
04:10 - changing their team color so now that
04:13 - we've got them added select both of them
04:15 - and set Auto assignable to false so they
04:18 - can't be given a team straight away all
04:20 - right and so let's just make a variable
04:22 - for a remote event so local remote event
04:24 - equals gay
04:25 - don't replicate the storage and we can
04:28 - say change team all right because that's
04:31 - our remote events you then are going to
04:36 - say local menu button we're going to
04:38 - assign it to the menu button tsunami add
04:41 - that I'm also going to make a variable
04:43 - for the frame which houses our button so
04:45 - we can say script dots parent curl on
04:47 - wait for child frame and then we're just
04:51 - going to get our team colors here so
04:53 - team colors and so if you are in the
04:56 - police so the police color is going to
04:59 - be cyan and the criminals color is going
05:05 - to be bright orange all right because
05:07 - they are the two colors which we defined
05:09 - over here so just make sure you got some
05:11 - variables for those and then we're just
05:14 - going to do an event so when one of the
05:16 - buttons has been clicked we changed the
05:17 - team so frame dots criminals okay
05:22 - because the criminals at button here is
05:24 - inside of the frame and then we could
05:26 - say dot mouse button one click
05:28 - : connect a bracket function and this
05:33 - function is going to fire off the remote
05:35 - event so you can say remote event curl
05:38 - on fire server and then we're gonna say
05:41 - brick color dot new because team colors
05:44 - are brick colors a brick color is
05:46 - basically a color from this palette so
05:48 - not an RGB color made up of three values
05:50 - which we can choose so this is a brick
05:53 - color and so we say brick colored new
05:55 - and then we're gonna say criminal cover
05:57 - okay because let's see criminals color
06:00 - because that is the color we defined up
06:03 - here and so when the criminals button
06:05 - gets clicked we fire the remote event or
06:07 - we fire a motor vent because you can't
06:08 - change a player's team from the clients
06:10 - and because that would be quite
06:13 - dangerous so we can't do that and then
06:16 - if we go back to and back to the script
06:19 - here and just copy this events and paste
06:21 - it but we change criminals to police and
06:24 - then down here in the remote event
06:26 - section we're just gonna change
06:28 - criminals color to police car all right
06:32 - police color and that's all that we need
06:35 - to do now we need to go over to the
06:37 - server script
06:39 - and code it so let's go ahead and do
06:41 - that now we're gonna create a server
06:43 - script in service script service and
06:45 - this is gonna be used to handle the
06:47 - remote events okay because basically
06:50 - local scripts they can't make changes to
06:52 - do with things such as teams so we have
06:55 - the fire and events and then that event
06:57 - gets picked up on the server and the
06:59 - server is able to change it all right
07:01 - you don't need to know too much about
07:02 - that but we're gonna do the team
07:04 - changing in here in the service script
07:06 - so all that we need to say is game
07:09 - replicated storage doctor change team
07:12 - doctor on server event so one that have
07:14 - ents been fired we can connect it to a
07:16 - function and in that function we've got
07:20 - some arguments which is basically some
07:22 - data we've passed over from the local
07:23 - script and that's going to be the player
07:25 - that fired this remote event or wants
07:28 - the team to be changed and the team
07:30 - color alright because we were saying
07:31 - team color here and that's the second
07:33 - bit of data that were passing over we
07:35 - just don't say what player is being sent
07:38 - it automatically gets sent so we're
07:39 - sending the color here and we're picking
07:42 - that up as the team color so all we need
07:44 - to say is player dot team color equals
07:48 - team color and then we can say player
07:50 - per long load character and that's going
07:53 - to respawn them so that they get placed
07:55 - onto and the spawn for that team okay
07:58 - now I've just realized what you also
08:00 - need to do we need to have a team which
08:02 - is auto assigned to the player and when
08:04 - they join because they're going to be
08:05 - choosing so if we just go back here to
08:08 - the team section and we add a new team
08:10 - and we set that so that it is Auto
08:12 - assignable and we just changed the name
08:14 - to be something like choosing this will
08:17 - be given to the players when they join
08:18 - but we're going to keep police and
08:20 - criminals sets - so the unassigned ball
08:23 - is unchecked so that they immediately
08:25 - immediately get placed into this team
08:27 - and if we go ahead and run this game it
08:31 - should work for us so I get placed into
08:33 - the choosing team and if I click on
08:35 - criminals it puts me in a criminal team
08:36 - and police puts me on the police side so
08:39 - the last thing that we to do is we need
08:41 - to add a menu button okay so I'm going
08:43 - to add a text button to this GUI and I'm
08:47 - just going to set the anchor point to
08:49 - zero comment not 0.5 so
08:51 - to say it scales perfectly on the y-axis
08:54 - and we're going to set the position to 0
08:57 - and then comma 10 so 10 pixels offset
09:01 - from the side so that it's not touching
09:02 - the corner of the screen and comma
09:04 - not 0.5 comma 0 okay and that's going to
09:07 - put it in the middle of the screen on
09:09 - the y-axis and if we go ahead and set
09:12 - tech scale to true and we just give it a
09:15 - nice of font and just change the text to
09:18 - say change team then there's our button
09:20 - and if we just change the name of this
09:24 - to be called menu button then we can go
09:28 - back into our local script and now we
09:30 - can use this variable we declared and we
09:32 - can set it to script dot P Hrant curl on
09:36 - wait for child and we can say menu
09:39 - button okay and then down here all we
09:42 - need to say is menu button dot mouse
09:45 - button one-click curl on connect
09:48 - function and in this function we're just
09:52 - going to set the frames and visibility
09:54 - property to the opposite of what it
09:57 - currently is so we can do that by saying
09:59 - frame not visible echo was not framed
10:01 - dot visible so now if you go and click
10:04 - on the frame and make sure visibles
10:06 - unchecked and we go ahead and play then
10:09 - you can see we get put into the choosing
10:11 - team again if we click on change team it
10:13 - appears we can become a criminal and
10:15 - there we go it goes off our screen again
10:18 - so what that was how you make team
10:21 - changed you I if you liked the video
