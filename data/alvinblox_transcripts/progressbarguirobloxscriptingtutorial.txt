00:00 - how to make a progress bar in roadblocks
00:03 - so firstly you'll need a screen GUI and
00:05 - then you'll need a frame this is going
00:07 - to be our bar so I'm just going to make
00:10 - it cover uh a small section of the
00:13 - screen and I'm going to put it in the
00:14 - middle of the screen like this and then
00:16 - I'm going to just set the Anchor Point
00:18 - so that it's definitely in the middle
00:20 - and now how do we actually make this be
00:23 - an actual bar how do we show a
00:26 - percentage uh as a portion of this Frame
00:30 - Well what we'll do is we'll insert
00:32 - another frame inside of this one and
00:35 - this will be the green section or
00:36 - whatever color you choose I'm going to
00:38 - choose green because your typical
00:39 - progress bar is green and we're going to
00:42 - set the size to be 1 comma 1 so it's
00:46 - going to fill the entirety of the parent
00:49 - frame and you'll notice that we can
00:51 - actually adjust the x width of this uh
00:55 - so it actually looks like a progress bar
00:57 - now what I'm also going to do is I'm
00:59 - just going to add a I corner I'm going
01:01 - to set the corner radius to 1 comma 0
01:04 - and we're going to right click copy and
01:07 - paste this into our other frame so both
01:10 - of them have got that uh progress bar
01:13 - sorry that UI Corner uh and you will
01:16 - notice one thing and that's when the
01:18 - inser bar the green bar um gets quite
01:21 - small you see that you get this this uh
01:24 - annoying little visual issue now uh how
01:28 - can you fix this well
01:30 - uh I'm not sure to be honest and that's
01:32 - why I typically don't use UI corners on
01:34 - my progress bars but if anyone has a
01:36 - solution for this let me know in the
01:38 - comments anyway back to the general
01:41 - point of how to make a progress bar so
01:43 - what I'll do is I'll name the alter
01:45 - frame the main frame and I'll name this
01:48 - inner one the inser just so that we
01:51 - don't get
01:52 - confused and then what we'll do is we'll
01:56 - insert a local script so I can show you
01:59 - how to code this progress bar so I'm
02:02 - going to create a function I'm going to
02:04 - call it update progress bar and I'm
02:08 - going to take a number into this
02:09 - function which is going to be the
02:12 - percentage and then what we'll do is now
02:14 - I don't want to use code assist please
02:16 - go away thank you to change the progress
02:20 - bar all we need to do is we need to get
02:22 - the
02:23 - inser and then we'll say do size equals
02:26 - udm 2. from scale and we'll put number
02:30 - comma 1 and the number is going to be a
02:34 - value for the X scale so it's going to
02:36 - be between 0 and 1 so when we call this
02:39 - function we need to provide a number
02:41 - between zero and one if we wanted half
02:44 - of the progress bar to be um if want the
02:47 - progress to be here or half you would
02:49 - set the size position to 0.5 if you
02:52 - wanted it to be 3/4 of the way you'd say
02:55 - 0.75 and if you wanted it to be
02:57 - completely full you would say one so
03:00 - let's imagine you have a value of cash
03:03 - 500 cash and let's say you have an
03:05 - achievement which is going to be at
03:07 - 1,000 cach then to get our progress
03:11 - towards the achievement we're going to
03:14 - say cach divided by achievement and then
03:16 - we can update our progress bar with this
03:19 - progress towards the achievement because
03:21 - this is going to return a decimal value
03:24 - between 0er and one and then we can pass
03:26 - this into our upgrade update progress
03:30 - bar uh function and you don't have to
03:33 - use a function you could just say
03:36 - script. main. inset do size equals udm
03:39 - 2. from scale and you could just put
03:42 - that decimal number right in there
03:44 - without having to do any of this
03:45 - function stuff but I like functions
03:48 - because it just makes it look a little
03:49 - bit more neat and and organized so what
03:52 - we'll do is we'll just set our inser
03:56 - size to be0 comma 1 so that we have a
04:00 - progress bar which isn't filled up and
04:02 - we'll click on play and what should
04:04 - happen is yeah there we go it fills half
04:07 - of the way what we could also do is we
04:10 - could set up a changed event if we had
04:12 - this as a leader stat so let me go make
04:15 - a quick
04:17 - leaderboard okay so I've created a quick
04:19 - little leader stats uh script and I've
04:22 - also just added a get property changed
04:25 - signal which will detect when the value
04:27 - changes and when it does we can update
04:30 - the progress bar to have the cash value
04:33 - divided by our achievement value of
04:35 - 1,000 and that will update the progress
04:37 - bar so let's click on play and our
04:40 - leader stats are added so let's just go
04:42 - and change them here we'll set it to one
04:46 - 50 200 300 500 and 1,000 and it's
04:53 - updating our progress bar now there's
04:56 - one small issue which is if we set the
04:58 - value to be greater than a000
05:00 - the progress bar is going to go off the
05:02 - screen so how do we prevent that well
05:05 - all we have to do is we just need to
05:07 - clamp our number by one so we can say
05:10 - number equals math do clamp number
05:13 - between 0 and one and that means our
05:15 - value will never go over one even if
05:17 - it's greater than one we'll cap it at
05:19 - one so it will never extend to go past
05:22 - the bar and if I set it to 5,000 which
05:24 - is greater than 1,000 you can see the
05:26 - bar does not go past one so that's how
