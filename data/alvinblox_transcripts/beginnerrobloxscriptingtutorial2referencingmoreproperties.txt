00:00 - welcome back to the second video in my
00:02 - scripting series now if you're enjoying
00:03 - the series so far please don't forget to
00:05 - give me a like on the video and
00:07 - subscribe if you're interested in more
00:09 - scripting content so in the previous
00:11 - video and if you haven't already seen
00:13 - that video by the way I recommend you go
00:15 - and watch it I'll leave a card to it in
00:16 - the top right corner of the screen and
00:18 - link in the description the previous
00:20 - video was about properties and we also
00:22 - went over roblox to do a little bit so
00:24 - we'll definitely recommend watching that
00:25 - first now we're gonna go over properties
00:28 - a little bit more in this video but it
00:30 - won't be as long as last time now you
00:33 - might be getting a little bit bored of
00:34 - doing properties and I know you want to
00:36 - jump to the good stuff but we have to
00:37 - learn this stuff because it is vital
00:40 - which you need to know and if you don't
00:42 - then you'll get confused later on so
00:45 - let's say you have a brick okay or part
00:49 - or any objects and you give it a name
00:51 - such as my brick okay but you have a
00:56 - space in the name alright that's fair
00:58 - enough
00:58 - so let's go into the script and now
01:01 - let's try and reference it so it softly
01:03 - game dot workspace and the brick we're
01:07 - gonna say dot my brick okay so my brick
01:11 - dock transparency equals one right it
01:14 - doesn't seem to like the name of this
01:16 - obviously because it's got a space in it
01:18 - and Lua won't allow spaces in names so
01:23 - when we go and run this and it's not
01:25 - going to go transparent because the
01:27 - script has encountered an error so when
01:29 - a script encounters an error is going to
01:31 - stop and you're not going to see the
01:33 - expected result so we're gonna open up
01:36 - the output and the output will allow us
01:38 - to debug our scripts now don't worry
01:41 - about this stuff this is just because
01:42 - plugins I have which don't work but you
01:45 - can see here the script has given us a
01:48 - message so it's saying sir script
01:49 - service dot scripts that's telling us
01:51 - where the script is so here it is and
01:53 - it's saying one so one means the line
01:56 - number you can see how it counts the
01:58 - lines as you go down so it's telling us
02:00 - which line it's stopped on so line one
02:03 - and it says and equals expected near
02:06 - brick and we've got on equals but the
02:08 - issue is because of this red line
02:10 - because of this name so how do we get
02:12 - around this
02:13 - if you've got a space in the name of
02:16 - your instance or objects you can put it
02:19 - in square brackets okay so you're not
02:21 - going to need the dot over here by
02:24 - workspace but you're going to need it by
02:26 - Transparency so instead of saying game
02:28 - that workspace dot my brick we can do
02:31 - square brackets and then inside of these
02:33 - square brackets we can do quotation
02:35 - marks or speech marks and then you can
02:38 - write the name of the brick no problem
02:40 - because it's a string and a string is a
02:42 - data type of text and which is
02:45 - acceptable by roblox
02:46 - so this time if we go and try try it out
02:49 - it goes fully transparent and if we look
02:52 - in the output there's no errors from our
02:54 - script
02:54 - okay so that's the first thing I had to
02:57 - get around the second problem is if your
03:00 - name is a number okay
03:01 - so 56 okay and we try and do the same
03:05 - thing again game don't work space dot
03:07 - fifty-six dot transparency equals one
03:10 - this is gonna cause an error as well
03:12 - because you can't just have what is
03:16 - because the name property of a part is
03:18 - is a string and a string is text and a
03:22 - string should be written like this
03:24 - okay because the data which goes into
03:28 - this this name property is a text not a
03:30 - number and we have to again put it in a
03:33 - string so you can't just put numbers
03:36 - like this because it would just go blue
03:38 - and then the script will get confused
03:40 - again
03:40 - so again square brackets and as a string
03:44 - I just in speech marks like this we put
03:49 - 56 and then we need the dot after the
03:52 - square brackets to indicate what
03:54 - property we're trying and again we're in
03:56 - the game and it will go transparent so
03:59 - that's they are just a couple of things
04:01 - that you could have when you're trying
04:04 - to reference apart and again another
04:08 - problem you may face is let's say you
04:12 - are finding a part in the workspace and
04:14 - we call this part of gravity okay but
04:19 - the workspace also has a property called
04:21 - gravity so we have a part called gravity
04:24 - in the workspace and a property of
04:26 - workspace called
04:27 - gravity so when we say gamed it works
04:29 - list of gravity how does the script know
04:31 - that we want to change this property of
04:34 - workspace or whether we want to
04:37 - reference and access the part called
04:40 - gravity what you'll want to do if you
04:42 - want to get to the property then it's
04:44 - gonna by default find this property okay
04:47 - it's gonna go to this first but if you
04:49 - actually just want to find the the name
04:52 - of that you want to find the power
04:53 - instead of doing a dot you could say
04:55 - code on find first child and what find
04:58 - first child does is it looks for only
05:01 - the things inside of workspace so we're
05:03 - not talking about the properties here a
05:04 - child as I said is something inside of
05:07 - another thing so these parts camera
05:10 - terrain base pay and gravity are all
05:12 - part of the workspace they're all
05:13 - children of the workspace so we're
05:15 - finding the first child with a name
05:17 - gravity and then you can do something
05:20 - like setting the transparency to not
05:24 - point five okay so try that again and
05:28 - there you go it goes half transparent
05:30 - but again if we had just said gravity
05:34 - transparency and there we go and run the
05:37 - game it's got confused because it's gone
05:40 - to the workspace it looked at its
05:42 - property called gravity and it's try to
05:44 - set it to a number but what no it's try
05:47 - to set it transparency because it's
05:50 - trying to find a property of this
05:51 - property and you can't have a property
05:53 - of a property so they're just a couple
05:56 - things which could go wrong and I've
05:58 - shown you how to get around them by
06:00 - using square brackets and speech marks
06:04 - another problem which you might have is
06:06 - if you have two parts that have the same
06:08 - name so if we have let us change this
06:11 - from gravity to I don't know dog okay
06:15 - and we clone this part and we now have
06:18 - two parts called dog and then what if
06:23 - you wanted to say game dot work space
06:25 - dog dot transparency right because you
06:28 - want to make them both transparent well
06:30 - you can if you try and do this it's
06:33 - going to only set the transparency of
06:35 - one of them okay and this is because the
06:38 - script it can't tell them apart because
06:40 - they have the
06:40 - same name so it goes into the workspace
06:42 - and it only picks one of them it only
06:44 - picks the first one which it finds so
06:46 - you're gonna have to name one of them
06:48 - dog one and the other one dog two and
06:51 - then you're gonna have to change the
06:52 - transparency of dog one and dog two on
06:55 - two different lines like this so it's
06:58 - only going to it's only going to pick
07:00 - one when they have the same name and one
07:04 - more thing that I want to go over we had
07:05 - an error earlier in our code and these
07:08 - can happen these errors can appear quite
07:11 - a lot when you're scripting so don't be
07:13 - disheartened if you get an error because
07:15 - usually most the time they are really
07:17 - easy to fix
07:18 - okay so let's try and let's firstly
07:22 - insert another part okay and we'll just
07:25 - keep it named part if you make a simple
07:29 - capitalization or spelling mistake and
07:31 - the scripts gonna error so for example
07:33 - she said Gamay into the game got
07:35 - workspace dot parts dots brick color it
07:40 - was brick color dot new and we give it
07:42 - really red you can see it's highlighted
07:46 - that you've you've made it a mistake and
07:47 - it's saying unknown global because it
07:49 - doesn't know what what you may means
07:51 - right and if you try and run it it's
07:54 - going to have an error so if you ever
07:57 - get an error make sure you've checked to
07:59 - see if you're spelling things right and
08:00 - attempt index global may and no value
08:04 - that's because it's tried to find may
08:06 - but it can't find it and the same thing
08:08 - goes for things like if you spell
08:11 - something with lowercase okay it worked
08:15 - that time because you can you can
08:16 - actually say workspace in in lowercase
08:18 - because it's a service but if you said
08:20 - say part with lowercase okay but it's
08:23 - actually got a capital letter too big to
08:25 - start off with and we run this it's
08:28 - trying to find the the name exactly how
08:32 - we wrote it so part and said parts is
08:34 - not a vibe member of workspace that just
08:36 - means it can't find a brick called part
08:40 - as you've actually spelt it with a
08:42 - capital P in the workspace okay because
08:45 - you could have two parts one spelt with
08:48 - lowercase one spoke normally okay and
08:50 - that would be the way to distinguish
08:52 - between them so you have to make sure
08:54 - that you get the spelling capitalization
08:56 - and everything correct I'm not sure if
08:59 - it's the same with Britt with properties
09:01 - I wouldn't think so yeah exactly so you
09:05 - can you don't have to you know get the
09:07 - capitalization correct but it's good
09:09 - practice to on things like brick when
09:11 - you're stating the name of the property
09:12 - but I think if you did something like a
09:15 - spelling mistake like this and you said
09:17 - brick claw it's gonna get confused okay
09:19 - yeah it's trying to find a brick claw
09:22 - but you can't find it and the same thing
09:24 - goes for if you make a spelling mistake
09:26 - in in the name of your color it's gonna
09:30 - error so always make sure you spell
09:32 - everything correctly and you you're
09:35 - using capital letters correctly etc okay
09:38 - what you should do as you keep scripting
09:41 - is you know just keep checking your
09:43 - scripts as you write them to make sure
09:45 - that the capitalization is right and
09:47 - that you've spelled everything correctly
09:49 - so and that way you reduce the chance of
09:52 - making mistakes and having to then debug
09:55 - them later on and also if you get an
09:57 - error and you don't know what is wrong
09:59 - with it you can always ask people online
10:01 - you can go to places such as the roblox
10:03 - developer forum or ask a friend but it's
10:06 - good if you're trying to work out fixes
10:11 - to your own errors and mistakes because
10:13 - that way it will help you later on when
10:15 - you're trying to solve more complex
10:16 - problems and and it builds your
10:19 - problem-solving skills and you won't
10:21 - have to ask for help all the time so
10:23 - arrows are good and they can be annoying
10:26 - at times but you just have to deal with
10:28 - them you have to try and solve them
10:30 - think logically and you know don't be
10:32 - disheartened if you can't find the the
10:35 - solution yet so I think that was
10:36 - everything that I was gonna cover in
10:38 - this video I wanted it to be a lot
10:39 - shorter than the last one
10:40 - if you do want to go to the next video
10:42 - then I'll leave a thumbnail on the
10:43 - screen right now which you know and
