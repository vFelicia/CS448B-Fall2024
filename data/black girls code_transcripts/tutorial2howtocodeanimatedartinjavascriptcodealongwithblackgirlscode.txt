00:00 - what's up brilliant coders it's your
00:02 - girl Jillian welcome back to video two
00:05 - of our mini series of coding animated
00:07 - art in our last video we created artwork
00:10 - centered around our identity and loving
00:12 - all of who we are including our natural
00:15 - hair I wanted to take that a step
00:17 - further and include all types of people
00:19 - and their wonderful hair textures hair
00:22 - can be an expression of our personal
00:24 - style and even our religious and
00:26 - cultural identities which is why I made
00:29 - this art that changes from an afro to a
00:32 - hijab to straight hair and I'm going to
00:34 - show you how to do it yourself so are
00:36 - you ready awesome let's get into it
00:39 - [Music]
00:45 - first let's start by adding an animation
00:48 - that includes afros of different sizes
00:51 - we are going to open up our previous
00:53 - piece of art and comment out our curls
00:56 - for now just so that we have the round
00:58 - afro when we comment out a section of
01:00 - code we make our code invisible and it
01:03 - can't be used or seen by our functions
01:06 - that means we'll no longer see the curls
01:09 - for now select the code you want to make
01:11 - invisible and then press command
01:14 - backslash if you are a Mac User or
01:17 - control backslash if you have PC
01:20 - now that the curls are commented out or
01:23 - temporarily hidden we have to think what
01:25 - we need to change in the code to make
01:27 - the afro go from large to small we need
01:31 - to adjust the width and height of the
01:33 - circle in our previous video we learned
01:36 - how stored values and variables can be
01:38 - used in different parts of our functions
01:41 - below curls let's create a variable
01:44 - called afro size that stores our current
01:47 - afro size of 380. next replace the value
01:51 - 380 in the afro Circle function with
01:54 - afro size
01:55 - if nothing changes then you have
01:58 - completed the step correctly now we want
02:00 - the afro size of the afro to shrink at a
02:04 - constant rate we can reuse our total sum
02:07 - operation to achieve this goal below
02:10 - Afro type afro size equals afro size
02:14 - minus one remember we are subtracting
02:17 - from the total size instead of adding to
02:20 - it like we did when we grew the curls of
02:23 - the afro because we want to make it
02:25 - smaller this way we'll see the afro
02:27 - shrink into infinity and then grow into
02:31 - Infinity so let's reset the afro size
02:34 - once we get to a certain size just like
02:37 - we did when the afro was growing to
02:39 - Infinity in our previous video below the
02:42 - afro size operation write the following
02:45 - if the afro size is less than 210 then I
02:48 - want to reset the afro size to 400. now
02:52 - we have an afro that shrinks to show all
02:55 - the different sizes it can be then
02:57 - resets itself to a size slightly larger
03:00 - than the original starting point even
03:03 - though I love afros and all of their
03:06 - Glory not everyone's hair grows that way
03:08 - or is worn that way so it's important
03:11 - for us to be able to have our art
03:13 - reflect a variety of hair types and
03:16 - hairstyles next in this piece we will
03:19 - show a woman with straighter hair and
03:21 - also a woman with a hijab which is a
03:23 - head covering worn by some Muslim women
03:25 - the way that I can do this is to comment
03:28 - out our afro section for now above it I
03:32 - will label straight hair slash hijab I
03:36 - want to draw a black rectangle that will
03:38 - span slightly larger than the width of
03:40 - the face
03:41 - we also have to adjust the hairline to
03:44 - span the width of the hair
03:45 - now let's shrink the afro while
03:48 - transitioning it to the hijab and
03:50 - eventually the straight hair
03:53 - I want to use the same logic we applied
03:55 - to shrink the afro to grow the straight
03:58 - hair this time we are changing the
04:01 - height of the rectangle to increase
04:02 - every time the draw function runs So
04:06 - Below the afro size variable I'm going
04:08 - to make a hair height variable and set
04:11 - its initial value to that of our
04:13 - rectangle height of 160. then replace
04:16 - 160 with hair height in the rectangle
04:19 - now I want the hair height to increase
04:22 - by half speed but you can change it to
04:24 - any speed you want I want the hair
04:26 - height to reset to 160 after it reaches
04:29 - a length of 300. now you see the hair
04:32 - height of the straight or hijab covered
04:35 - hair grow and grow until it reaches a
04:38 - length of 300 then it resets
04:41 - the next step is to uncomment the afro
04:44 - section and watch both animations at
04:47 - work
04:48 - [Music]
04:49 - hey that looks so dope
04:54 - well that's all the coding for today
04:56 - make sure you save your work
05:02 - now real talk major props to you for all
05:05 - of your hard work
05:07 - make sure to come back next week to
05:09 - learn how to take your animated art to
05:11 - the next level by adding moving
05:13 - animations to the background but in the
05:16 - meantime an in between time stay cute
05:19 - and stay coding
05:22 - foreign
