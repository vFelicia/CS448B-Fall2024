00:00 - through the tireless work of modern
00:02 - pioneers in
00:03 - truly the superpower working on in the
00:06 - fields of pure science to reveal more of
00:09 - the mysteries of the universe
00:15 - on the surfaces it's exactly what it
00:17 - says which is black girls code they're
00:18 - learning how to code
00:20 - web pages and code programs for robots
00:24 - so it's that in a literal sense but
00:27 - figuratively
00:28 - is i think it's a way that we move
00:30 - forward into the future with how we do
00:31 - things how we innovate how we bring our
00:34 - essence back to dominant culture because
00:36 - right now
00:38 - our narrative is kind of left out of the
00:40 - story
00:50 - just to say the word black girls is
00:53 - revolutionary in and of itself
00:56 - so for kimberly to step out to open up
00:59 - that particular industry to girls at
01:01 - such a young age i mean the sky is the
01:04 - limit for what they can bring to society
01:05 - as a whole so it's very innovative
01:08 - [Music]
01:10 - the mind is the most powerful machine
01:14 - that we possess as human beings i
01:16 - founded black girls code because i
01:18 - noticed there was a huge need in terms
01:21 - of girls of color and introducing them
01:24 - to
01:25 - computer programming and technology
01:27 - we're feeding the mind of the next
01:29 - generation
01:31 - so far we went to ibm
01:34 - we made
01:35 - the robot that we had to program but we
01:39 - had to debug it
01:41 - and that was hard the robot really is a
01:44 - piece of equipment that
01:46 - humans
01:48 - program so the question is can you do
01:50 - you want to play a role in in the future
01:52 - in terms of technology
01:55 - the lack of people of color in the
01:57 - technology field a lot of it stems from
01:59 - education we see an underrepresentation
02:01 - in that area from all minorities ethnic
02:03 - backgrounds and also people of color and
02:06 - i think it's a tremendous program in how
02:08 - it reaches out to young girls and
02:11 - introduces them very early to the
02:13 - concept of new technology
02:15 - this is silicon valley this is like the
02:18 - center of
02:19 - technology so when the girls go to those
02:23 - organizations to those companies to do
02:25 - hands-on activities
02:27 - that's how all education should be
02:30 - but just to see them flourish and grow
02:32 - in self-confidence and their sense of
02:34 - self their identity
02:36 - that's all part of the elements that we
02:38 - try to build into our program
02:40 - it shapes their soul and their self
02:43 - esteem and their self worth by saying
02:45 - look this is what i did you can see
02:48 - their little spirits changing and
02:50 - empowerment
02:51 - black girls code can help little girls
02:55 - if we have a black girls code
02:57 - when we grow up we might become people
03:01 - in technology
