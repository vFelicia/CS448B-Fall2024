00:00 - hey hey brilliant coders I'm Cheyenne
00:03 - your host for code along developing an
00:06 - Obby in Roblox brought to you by black
00:08 - girls code in this video series we will
00:11 - be working together to learn how to
00:13 - create an epic multi-level Hobby in
00:16 - Roblox that everybody's going to want to
00:18 - play
00:19 - [Music]
00:25 - I know you may just want to jump into
00:27 - developing the game trust me I do too
00:29 - but it's super important that we take
00:31 - the time to plan out our game like what
00:34 - kind of hobby are we going to build and
00:36 - wait
00:37 - what even is an Obby anyway if you are
00:40 - new to the world of Roblox and Abby is
00:42 - simply a game made of obstacle courses
00:44 - that you need to get through in order to
00:46 - win and we all want to be winners here
00:48 - okay I know that's right game developers
00:50 - normally spent hours brainstorming what
00:53 - will the characters the story and the
00:55 - design be storyboarding is a step used
00:58 - by most game developers and since I'm a
01:01 - game developer and you're a game
01:03 - developer let's not skip this step
01:05 - storyboarding your game involves
01:07 - creating a collection of cards or boards
01:10 - that tells your game's Story movie and
01:12 - TV directors often use storyboarding as
01:15 - a way to plan out their film sequences
01:16 - and to include important details about
01:19 - characters props costumes and sets
01:22 - storyboarding and video games are not
01:24 - much different similarly we can use the
01:27 - cards to depict your game's scenes in a
01:29 - logical order you can also use the
01:31 - storyboard to plan your game's
01:33 - characters plot points gameplay
01:35 - functionality character actions game
01:38 - items and much much more
01:41 - great
01:42 - now all I need is an idea
01:45 - okay
01:46 - so I know I want to build an Obby
01:49 - and that's pretty much all I know okay
01:53 - all right let me take a deep breath
01:55 - [Music]
02:01 - that was good sometimes when I want to
02:04 - get a good idea I do things that calm me
02:07 - and clear my mind maybe I should go for
02:09 - a walk or take a shower one time I got
02:12 - an idea for a winning science project in
02:14 - there maybe I'll scroll on social media
02:16 - or or play a video game playing a video
02:18 - game might help in this instance because
02:20 - I often get game ideas by thinking about
02:23 - what I love or would want to improve in
02:26 - other video games okay so BRB
02:29 - [Music]
02:30 - all right
02:32 - sorry I was gone for so long but I think
02:35 - I have it after my walk social media
02:37 - scroll and video game sessions I've
02:39 - decided that my game will be a
02:41 - futuristic Hobby
02:44 - so let's get started
02:47 - before I dive into storyboarding all my
02:49 - ideas about a futuristic hobby I want to
02:51 - make sure my storyboard is all prepped
02:53 - and ready to go for my game storyboard I
02:55 - am going to use canva canva is a free
02:58 - graphic design tool that people all over
03:00 - the world use okay to get started we go
03:03 - to
03:05 - www.canva.com and simply sign up for an
03:07 - account
03:10 - once you're in in the search bar simply
03:13 - type storyboard
03:15 - then a variety of templates are going to
03:17 - show up
03:18 - on the left hand side I'm going to apply
03:20 - the free filter because your girl is on
03:24 - a budget okay Queen
03:26 - I know you know what I'm talking about I
03:28 - am going to choose this template I like
03:30 - how it allows me to include both images
03:32 - and text so I can jot down my vision and
03:35 - notes all in one
03:36 - now that I'm in I can see my storyboard
03:39 - template to the right and a variety of
03:40 - tools I can use on the left to edit and
03:42 - make it more of my vibe I'm going to
03:45 - choose the second page of my storyboard
03:46 - template to start working in since it's
03:48 - more of a blank slate now we're truly
03:51 - ready to start building our storyboard
03:53 - while I was on my break I scrolled
03:55 - through social media and saw so many
03:57 - posts about the state of our world which
04:00 - made me overwhelmed but there were also
04:02 - some posts encouraging me to get
04:04 - involved and to help so I was also
04:06 - hopeful generally I was feeling a lot I
04:09 - mean hashtag mood am I right I decided I
04:13 - wanted to make an Obby that both
04:15 - acknowledged the problems of the present
04:17 - and also the hope for the future I
04:19 - thought it would be awesome to build an
04:21 - Obby that takes the player through the
04:22 - world of today into a better cleaner
04:25 - more beautiful future of tomorrow now
04:28 - what do you imagine the future to be is
04:31 - it a world full of robots and artificial
04:33 - intelligence
04:34 - then your Obby would probably have
04:36 - high-tech robots and some awesome
04:39 - futuristic obstacles or perhaps you
04:42 - imagine a world free of violence that's
04:44 - filled with love and with hope then your
04:46 - Obby might be filled with bright colors
04:49 - and rainbows
04:51 - I picture the future to be a place where
04:53 - humans have worked to reverse climate
04:56 - change I imagine that there will be less
04:57 - pollution more Lush forests and cleaner
05:00 - oceans I mean when I dream I dream big
05:03 - anyway to reflect that it will be a long
05:07 - and sometimes difficult journey ahead to
05:09 - get to a better future I want the player
05:11 - to navigate through different levels
05:12 - that get harder and harder at the end of
05:15 - my hobby I want to celebrate the winners
05:17 - on a platform that displays the beauty
05:19 - of our new world let's start getting
05:21 - some of these ideas down to start I know
05:24 - I want my Abby to be six levels
05:29 - I mean I'm just starting out on this
05:32 - whole game development wave so I
05:35 - definitely don't want to overwhelm
05:36 - myself for level one I think I want the
05:38 - player to start in a very polluted city
05:44 - all the parts of my hobby will look dark
05:47 - gray and black to represent the many
05:49 - high-rise buildings in the city as well
05:52 - as the smog
05:54 - gross for now I'm just going to name
05:57 - this level the polluted city
06:00 - [Music]
06:01 - I know not too creative but we'll work
06:04 - on the names later okay so level one is
06:07 - planned we've got our first addition to
06:09 - the storyboard period
06:11 - for level two I am thinking I want the
06:13 - player to go through a forest that has
06:15 - suffered from deforestation right now
06:17 - it's the unfortunate truth that forests
06:20 - are being cut down for human needs
06:22 - causing animals to lose their habitats
06:24 - I'll call this level the scarce Forest
06:28 - picture it as having scattered trees
06:30 - Fallen logs and tons of human
06:33 - construction tools laying around
06:35 - I promise it will get better we will
06:38 - literally code it to be moving on to
06:40 - level three
06:41 - for this level I want to address one of
06:43 - the biggest problems in today's world
06:45 - our water I imagine this level of having
06:48 - brownish green ocean water
06:51 - and melting icebergs again I know it's a
06:54 - little sad but just go with it for now
06:55 - I'll call this level the contaminated
06:58 - ocean
07:00 - now it's time to change the narrative
07:03 - for level four I'm going to take the
07:06 - player through a city again but this
07:08 - time the obstacles will be pedestrians
07:10 - and trees rather than cars and ugly City
07:12 - buildings I'll add a blue sky now
07:14 - instead of the smoggy dirty Sky of level
07:17 - one I'll call this level the city of the
07:20 - future
07:21 - I know I know my name conventions are
07:24 - just so creative and now for level five
07:28 - I'm going to take the player back
07:30 - through the forest but this time it will
07:32 - be a lush rainforest where the player
07:35 - will need to watch out for all the
07:37 - living species along their path I'll
07:39 - call this level the return of the Wild
07:44 - finally we are at level six where the
07:48 - player will Traverse the ocean except
07:50 - this time it will be a beautiful blue
07:53 - ocean with a horizon Colored Sky the
07:55 - obstacle course will be filled with
07:57 - beautiful corals and wonderful aquatic
07:59 - creatures for now
08:01 - I'll name this level the ocean blue
08:06 - and done I told you it was all gonna get
08:10 - better
08:12 - I did it you did it we did it together
08:15 - we sketched out ideas for a futuristic
08:18 - Obby and remember these are just initial
08:20 - ideas if I get any more random Sparks of
08:23 - Genius I'll be sure to add more to my
08:25 - storyboard and of course my game I can't
08:27 - wait for you all to join me for our next
08:29 - video where I'll show you how to get
08:31 - started in the Roblox Creator studio so
08:33 - you can build a basic Obby until next
08:35 - time game on my coding fam
08:46 - thank you
