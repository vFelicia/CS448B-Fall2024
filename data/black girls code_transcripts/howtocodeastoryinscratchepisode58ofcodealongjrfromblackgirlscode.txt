08:10 - [Music]
08:27 - out you can follow similar steps to add
08:30 - dialogue to the rest of the characters
08:32 - in the story since we hid the rest of
08:34 - the characters in the beginning we need
08:36 - a way to show them once it's their turn
08:38 - to talk I'm going to click on Grace then
08:41 - drag and drop the when I received talk
08:43 - to Grace block to the scripts

09:03 - then say hey Mia long time no see you
09:07 - look warm and broadcast respond to
09:12 - [Music]
09:26 - Mia now you know all the steps to create
09:28 - a conversation between all the
09:31 - characters in the story to keep the
09:33 - story moving along but wait there's more
09:36 - I want to show you how we can get our
09:38 - characters to ask and respond to
09:40 - questions watch this I'm going to click
09:42 - on
09:43 - Mia then go to the sensing Tab and add
09:46 - the ask blank and wait
09:49 - block the block displays a question or a
09:52 - prompt that you define to the user the
09:56 - block then waits for the user to type in
09:58 - an answer and press the enter key or
10:00 - click on the check mark let's ask Sarah
10:03 - hey Sarah I've been searching all over
10:06 - for you have you found my
10:10 - laptop then go to the control Tab and
10:13 - add an if else block below my when I
10:16 - receive blank block the if block is
10:18 - where you place a condition if this
10:21 - condition is true then the code inside
10:24 - this section will run if the condition
10:26 - in the if block is false the code inside
10:29 - this lse section will execute
10:35 - instead so Sarah answers yes then Sarah
10:39 - will say awesome what a relief now I can
10:43 - finally finish my coding assignment I've
10:45 - been working so hard to build my own
10:49 - [Music]
10:58 - game
10:59 - then broadcast a final response to hide
11:02 - Sarah and
11:03 - [Music]
11:06 - Naomi after that I want Mia to go back
11:09 - to a room with her newly found laptop
11:12 - add the variable answer from the sensing
11:15 - Tab and the equals block from the
11:17 - operator tab then put the answer set
11:19 - inside the equals block and set it equal
11:22 - to yes next I'll drag it inside of the
11:25 - if statement like
11:27 - so the last part is to add Mia's
11:31 - response if Sarah says no so what should
11:34 - Mia
11:38 - [Music]
11:42 - say I think she would say oh no oh no
11:46 - what am I going to do now I'm totally
11:49 - going to fill my coding assignment next
11:51 - time I should really take better care of
11:53 - my
11:57 - things
12:03 - [Music]
12:06 - I'm going to broadcast a final response
12:08 - to Sarah and Naomi then switch the
12:10 - backdrop to her
12:13 - house let's review to create a story
12:16 - script in scratch start by using the
12:19 - event blocks to determine when your
12:21 - Story begins or when the characters get
12:24 - activated use the motion blocks to
12:27 - animate your Sprites and make them move
12:30 - use the control blocks to help you
12:31 - sequence events add pauses or introduce
12:35 - repetition you can also set conditional
12:38 - statements in your story such as if the
12:42 - character says yes then do this use the
12:46 - looks blocks to change the appearance of
12:48 - Sprites allow them to speak through
12:51 - dialogue bubbles change costumes or
12:54 - alter the backdrop to enrich the visual
12:56 - Narrative of your story lastly remember
13:00 - you can use sensing blocks to have your
13:02 - characters ask and respond to
13:05 - [Music]
13:06 - questions let's see how I combine all
13:09 - those elements together to make my final
13:12 - [Music]
13:27 - story
13:32 - [Music]
14:22 - [Music]
14:26 - if you want a closer look at my code be
14:29 - sure to click the project link
14:31 - below the last step is to save our work
14:35 - let's give our project the title then
14:37 - click save now in the top right hand
14:39 - corner or go to file and select save now
14:44 - if you want to share your wonderful
14:45 - story with other coders or friends then
14:48 - click the share button I can't wait to
14:50 - see how your stories turn out until next
14:53 - time
