02:16 - to introduce you to the speakers as I
02:19 - said I'm Samantha but we have Joanne
02:21 - Hill
02:23 - Leah Castleberry and Dr Patrice Johnson
02:26 - here
02:28 - so let's get started so let's talk about
02:31 - the journey and the vision
02:33 - so this conversation is grounded in our
02:36 - visual visual our vision of radical
02:39 - change in Tech
02:40 - so we're going to start with giving you
02:42 - the opportunity to learn about our panel
02:46 - so to the panel tell us about your
02:48 - journey why Tech what made you choose
02:51 - the roles that you got into
02:53 - and what was the what was guiding you in
02:56 - your journey to Tech and through Tech
03:05 - I guess I'm gonna go first yes thank you
03:10 - I I will break the ice Samantha
03:13 - um so I am Dr Patrice and I work with
03:16 - the amazing wonderful organization that
03:20 - is hosting this Summit black girls code
03:22 - I serve as the chief programs officer
03:25 - for black girls code and this is my
03:28 - first role squarely in the tech industry
03:32 - and the only reason why I chose to come
03:36 - to black girls code was because it is
03:39 - not like any other Tech organization
03:42 - it's sole purpose is not just a center
03:45 - black girls in their genius but it is an
03:48 - organization that seeks to disrupt
03:50 - so I was not necessarily interested in
03:53 - Tech before BGC what piqued my interest
03:56 - was that Tech was just one of the tools
04:01 - used to talk about disruptive
04:04 - Innovations utilizing Tech and looking
04:08 - at centering social inequity and
04:11 - considering what it looks like to
04:13 - liberate black girls and what that looks
04:16 - like to liberate everybody
04:18 - so that is one of the reasons why
04:21 - um I took this path
04:23 - um even the name or name black girl's
04:26 - code is disruptive
04:29 - it's disruptive
04:31 - um if you look at our founding and our
04:33 - history we were challenged on that name
04:36 - why are black girls cold right there's
04:39 - something different to say I'm gonna
04:41 - Center black girls
04:42 - in what other space do we
04:45 - unapologetically since are black girls
04:48 - and so Tech was just the icing on the
04:51 - cake for me but understanding that
04:54 - technology as an industry has always
04:56 - been here we're going back to the way we
04:59 - got our electricity right like these
05:03 - these inventions and how we plug up our
05:06 - phones and how we you know Iron our
05:08 - clothes and the way that you get stop
05:10 - lights all of that is technology but in
05:13 - this day and age I think technology
05:17 - um is Shifting us in a way that we can
05:19 - use it as a tool to change the way race
05:24 - and gender in class are experienced in
05:26 - our country so I think that that's to
05:29 - answer your questions Samantha to be the
05:31 - brave first person to go because now I'm
05:33 - going to tease Leah and Joanne
05:36 - um that is why uh I've chosen this work
05:43 - that is wonderful
05:46 - it's wonderful let's keep the
05:48 - conversation
05:48 - oh okay go sorry Joanne
05:52 - um hi everyone I'm so happy to be here
05:54 - thank you Samantha for this great
05:56 - introduction and thank you to the black
05:58 - girls co-organization for having us for
06:00 - the alumni Summit
06:02 - um so much of my career up to this point
06:04 - has been at the intersection of business
06:06 - technology and policy so I studied
06:10 - um international business at Howard
06:12 - University for undergrad and uh I'm very
06:15 - much and have always been very
06:17 - passionate about history culture and
06:19 - people and so as I approached my journey
06:24 - in studying business I didn't
06:26 - necessarily want to just go the
06:28 - corporate route but wanted to do
06:29 - something that had more meaning and
06:31 - impact in my day-to-day work
06:33 - um so I did different opportunities
06:35 - Fellowship programs internship programs
06:37 - that allow me to explore those other
06:39 - areas like the ppia public policy and
06:43 - international Affairs fellowship at
06:45 - Carnegie Mellon University which was my
06:48 - first introduction to Tech policy and
06:50 - turned at the state department but
06:53 - ultimately I ended up going the
06:55 - corporate route and I started my career
06:57 - as a business consultant at IBM Global
07:00 - business services and at that time they
07:03 - were really building out the Watson
07:05 - division the Artificial Intelligence
07:07 - Division as a solution for IBM's other
07:10 - corporate clients and I joined that team
07:13 - and I began studying I was immediately
07:15 - so intrigued by Watson and by Ai and the
07:19 - potential that it had but because of the
07:21 - lens that I see through the world as a
07:24 - black woman in my my lived experience I
07:26 - had a lot of questions about what we
07:28 - were doing to make sure that we were
07:31 - centering different types of
07:34 - lived experiences different cultures my
07:37 - International my international business
07:39 - background tapped in there and I started
07:41 - asking those questions and I decided to
07:44 - go back to school I went to grad school
07:46 - at the University of Chicago Harris
07:47 - School of Public Policy because I
07:49 - thought public policy might be a way
07:52 - that we can address some of these
07:53 - questions so a lot of what I did there
07:56 - centered on public policy and the
07:58 - question of how in a radical way in a
08:02 - disruptive way how can we think about
08:05 - Innovative Technologies and an
08:07 - opportunity to dismantle as opposed to
08:10 - perpetuate systematic oppression so how
08:13 - can we think about not just making
08:16 - things Equitable but tearing down
08:18 - historical barriers that have existed
08:21 - for different people
08:22 - currently I am back in the back in the
08:25 - private sector and really thinking about
08:28 - products so how do we really Center
08:31 - those experiences in the ways that
08:33 - different people from different
08:35 - communities different experiences engage
08:38 - with both hardware and software products
08:44 - that is wonderful wonderful all right
08:48 - and so as Patrice said she kicked it off
08:50 - so I'm ending it'll get the introduction
08:53 - but that is so appropriate because uh
08:56 - she mentioned definitely dived into
08:58 - Innovation and I work for IBM we're one
09:01 - of the most Innovative
09:03 - companies and Leah I did not realize you
09:06 - know also so this is this is really
09:08 - great I actually attended an HBCU I got
09:12 - my computer science degree from
09:14 - Mississippi Valley State University so
09:16 - my journey actually started I'd say
09:18 - pretty much College I actually my first
09:21 - semester I I chose accounting as my
09:24 - major but then with then after the first
09:26 - semester I switched to computer science
09:28 - so my journey has been long as in Tech I
09:31 - pretty much started with computer
09:33 - science and then I interned with IBM uh
09:36 - the summer before I graduated and I've
09:38 - been with IBM so I'm still with IBM and
09:42 - I know but with that I've been in so
09:46 - many different roles because it has
09:48 - afforded me the opportunity too I worked
09:51 - in Global Services which is Consulting
09:53 - now I started in Hardware in uh in
09:57 - Upstate New York so that's that was that
09:59 - that uh you know my initial introduction
10:01 - as a programmer and then a few years
10:04 - into that I wanted to also just maybe
10:08 - get a little bit closer to the customers
10:11 - just to see how the technology was
10:13 - working so I started or was able to do a
10:16 - shadow somewhat of a systems engineer at
10:19 - the time and that was a way of me being
10:22 - able to continue my technology uh you
10:26 - know uh expertise and experience along
10:29 - with working with clients and becoming
10:31 - client-facing and so I've been in I've
10:34 - been project management product
10:36 - management technology manager just uh
10:38 - ran the gamut IBM also has supported me
10:41 - I eventually also got my Master's in
10:45 - software engineering and uh in my master
10:48 - certificate in project management so I
10:50 - continue to learn and that's one thing
10:52 - that I would love the um you know the
10:55 - black girls alumni to understand
10:56 - constant learning when we talk about
10:58 - Innovation you have to keep learning and
11:01 - seeing what's happening you know uh in
11:04 - the world and just just to finish up as
11:07 - far as where I'm working now it's a
11:09 - really cool initiative is within IBM
11:12 - called call for code and that is a way
11:15 - of I work with uh clients and then there
11:19 - are students involved where we invite
11:21 - developers and problem solvers at a
11:24 - global scale to work on Solutions
11:26 - somewhat in a hackathon fashion a
11:29 - competition but working on real world
11:31 - problems working on solutions to real
11:34 - world problems because we don't want to
11:35 - just identify problems we want to work
11:37 - on solutions to problems so uh so very
11:39 - glad to be here uh not I can't speak for
11:43 - IBM but uh very very much uh you know
11:45 - big big proponent and it there are a lot
11:48 - of opportunities and we have a lot of
11:49 - Technology AI as Leah mentioned so yes a
11:53 - lot of a lot of technology in order to
11:56 - uh to disrupt thank you
12:00 - Samantha just a shout out to IBM IBM's
12:04 - team is with our team in South Africa as
12:06 - we speak uh bringing back our South
12:09 - Africa chapter so we I appreciate IBM as
12:12 - well yes so we're here in the U.S doing
12:16 - this but we got a team in South Africa
12:18 - teaching about 55 girls in Johannesburg
12:21 - right now with IBM so we appreciate you
12:23 - yes yeah Yolanda raver and who's really
12:27 - really uh pulling that together so thank
12:30 - you
12:31 - I I saw the photos on social this
12:33 - morning they were beautiful I'm so
12:35 - excited for those students and their
12:37 - experience
12:38 - on to the next question thank you so
12:40 - much for telling us about yourselves and
12:42 - connecting these dots uh but we want to
12:45 - talk about the tech ecosystem as an
12:47 - interconnected and independent pipeline
12:49 - of entities such as K-12 education
12:52 - post-secondary Tech Pathways the
12:55 - workforce and Entrepreneurship forward
12:57 - slash Venture Capital within your field
12:59 - in the tech ecosystem what does an
13:02 - inclusive and Equitable future look like
13:04 - to you what steps are you taking in your
13:08 - role career to build towards this vision
13:10 - and I want to start with Leah
13:13 - sure I'm happy to kick it off
13:15 - um
13:16 - what does an inclusive and Equitable
13:18 - Tech future look like for me
13:19 - um
13:21 - I think we are and people that I work
13:24 - with
13:25 - um are really working towards how do we
13:29 - mitigate proactively as opposed to
13:32 - reactively when it comes to building the
13:35 - technological future
13:38 - um in an inclusive way so how do we make
13:42 - sure that on the front end and as I'm
13:44 - sure many folks in this room know it is
13:47 - so much easier to build something
13:50 - proactively and address it as opposed to
13:52 - going back and fixing something
13:54 - particularly in the product space
13:56 - retroactively once it's already been
13:59 - done we know that you know Hardware
14:00 - product roadmaps for example can be five
14:04 - years six years or longer you know
14:07 - software is a little bit easier but when
14:10 - it when it comes to trying to address
14:14 - um ensuring that everyone has an
14:17 - inclusive experience we have to make
14:20 - sure we're asking the right questions
14:22 - and taking the extra time that it takes
14:24 - to address uh those those things in mind
14:28 - so how how are we thinking about all of
14:30 - the possible users who will come in
14:32 - contact with this product right how do
14:34 - how do people who are differently abled
14:37 - engage with products how do people with
14:40 - big hair wear VR glasses right how do we
14:44 - think about these things to make sure
14:46 - that everyone is having an inclusive and
14:48 - Equitable experience we know that also
14:50 - in the regulatory space we do anticipate
14:52 - that there will be some government
14:54 - regulation that will require big Tech to
14:58 - address these things but we know that
14:59 - that may be some time off and we can't
15:01 - wait we can't wait to start thinking
15:03 - about these things that has to be done
15:05 - now it's not an option so for me
15:08 - um
15:09 - thinking about how we build an inclusive
15:12 - text future and what that looks like
15:14 - we're addressing these things and
15:16 - thinking about and and doing our due
15:18 - diligence to address issues on the front
15:21 - end before they actually arise
15:25 - yes yes thank you let's move on to Dr
15:29 - Patrice
15:31 - I'm just soaking it all and I'm learning
15:33 - from Leah and Joanne on this call this
15:35 - is good I would I gotta concur with what
15:38 - Leah is saying and for me and I think
15:40 - for an organization like BGC it's it's
15:44 - building the space and the opportunity
15:47 - for those who have been historically
15:49 - distant disadvantaged or
15:52 - disenfranchised the space to build and
15:54 - to innovate because the way you think
15:57 - about the big hair or braids or the way
16:00 - you think about the lighting on our
16:02 - darker skin tones you have to have a
16:05 - person of color in the room and are we
16:08 - giving those are we giving people that
16:11 - look like a space to innovate and to
16:14 - create and so I think we have been
16:16 - ostracized from a lot of different
16:18 - Industries and I think we're in this
16:21 - intersection where technology really
16:23 - needs to consider how they support and
16:26 - invite black folks in right
16:29 - um so we think about
16:31 - we are the answer to our to our issues
16:34 - right like you think about the gentleman
16:36 - who created the cop stop app right so we
16:39 - know that technology can be a solution
16:41 - for social issues but the only way we do
16:44 - that is if we allow us to be the folks
16:46 - that are doing that and I think not only
16:49 - do we need to be supported with
16:50 - mentorship but we got to start give us
16:53 - the money can I just let out say I want
16:55 - all the money and shout out to the CEO
16:58 - Sophia because I always say to her just
17:00 - give me the money right I'm always
17:01 - asking for the money and I think it is
17:03 - true for uh black creators and black
17:06 - Founders and black folks who are being
17:08 - Innovative and creating apps and
17:10 - um experiencing technology in new ways
17:13 - they need the money and the resources to
17:15 - build we need the same resources good
17:18 - brother Mark Zuckerberg had I want the
17:20 - same resource okay
17:22 - um so I think that is how we become more
17:25 - inclusive we need the space to create
17:27 - and we need the money and the resources
17:30 - to create
17:34 - yes yes
17:37 - um last but not least let's move on keep
17:40 - the conversation going let's add some
17:42 - some more volume Joanne okay yeah and
17:45 - and pretty much uh Leah and Patrice had
17:47 - you know said it and described it the
17:49 - only additional thing that I can add is
17:52 - uh volunteerism and Patrice mentioned
17:54 - mentorship of course so and that is a
17:57 - big thing that I truly believe in and
18:00 - and I do and in order you for various
18:03 - organizations you have to be in the room
18:05 - you know as as Patrice mentioned that's
18:08 - got that's very key so we've got to be
18:10 - there
18:11 - um and I know it can be hard sometimes
18:13 - you know if you're the only one in the
18:15 - room but you you have to you have to
18:17 - continue
18:18 - um you know being a part of the back to
18:20 - my what I said earlier you got to be a
18:22 - part of the solution you know not just
18:25 - uh you know identifying problems so
18:27 - that's the only way is uh we just gotta
18:30 - make room find find the space find a
18:33 - chair you know some where in the room in
18:35 - whatever organization within your
18:37 - company wherever you can in order uh you
18:40 - know to to be included and to be insured
18:42 - to be sure that that we're all
18:44 - especially black women you know are are
18:47 - included
18:49 - can I make one addition before we move
18:51 - on to the next question
18:53 - of course thanks Samantha um so in terms
18:57 - of
18:57 - uh career opportunities and thinking
19:00 - about different ways to address this
19:02 - question so as you know Samantha teed up
19:04 - for this question in particular the the
19:07 - technological ecosystem is made up of
19:09 - many different components and so there
19:11 - are opportunities in all of those
19:13 - different areas whether it be the
19:15 - educational sector the non-profit sector
19:17 - the entrepreneurial sector so think
19:19 - about which from which angle you would
19:22 - like to contribute and then also think
19:25 - about
19:26 - um going into the policy space so in
19:29 - order to make sure we're equally
19:31 - dividing those resources and making
19:33 - giving access to resources like Dr
19:35 - Patrice mentioned we have to make sure
19:37 - that we have the right folks in those in
19:40 - those policy rooms and in the in on the
19:43 - hill and in different governmental
19:45 - spaces to be the voice and to Advocate
19:47 - to make sure that our communities are
19:50 - represented and we're making sure that
19:52 - there's Equitable access for for example
19:54 - for computer science programs funding
19:57 - for computer science as programs in
19:58 - public school systems and historically
20:00 - marginalized communities access to
20:03 - different resources for entrepreneurs
20:06 - Etc
20:08 - yes yes so true let's keep the
20:11 - conversation going and let's talk about
20:12 - challenges and realities
20:15 - um let's delve into a little bit the
20:17 - current challenges and how we can
20:19 - disrupt these uh systems of Oppression
20:22 - so with this first question so the
20:24 - effects of tech Innovation are
20:27 - immeasurable it significantly impacts
20:30 - our democracy our economy our society
20:33 - yet not all communities are benefiting
20:36 - equally from this Innovation we recently
20:39 - saw during this pandemic which
20:42 - spotlighted the Stark economic health
20:44 - education inequities
20:46 - um you know virtual learning for
20:48 - instance we saw instances where some
20:50 - communities had to I don't know go to to
20:53 - local uh open areas just to find Wi-Fi
20:57 - just to be able to be a part of the the
21:00 - shift in learning we saw that a lot of
21:03 - infrastructures and cities didn't have
21:05 - anything available to make sure that all
21:08 - the students could equitably access
21:10 - anything the tech whether it's
21:12 - technology whether the hardware at home
21:14 - to the broader technology that they
21:16 - needed to connect with
21:18 - um what does it look like to innovate
21:21 - with accessibility and equity in mind
21:23 - what steps can we take to intentionally
21:26 - Center historically disadvantaged
21:27 - communities and we're going to start off
21:29 - with with Dr Patrice Johnson on that one
21:32 - so I love this question and I think it
21:35 - it what Leah has led us to in her last
21:38 - response definitely talks about it and I
21:40 - love that response Leah
21:43 - um I would say what gives me Paul's
21:47 - um is the infrastructure even if you
21:51 - look at the last week Jackson ain't got
21:54 - no water
21:55 - here in Detroit we had power outage for
21:58 - about four days so how can we say that
22:01 - we can equitably allow people to engage
22:05 - in technology when our infrastructure we
22:08 - are still like living in 1945
22:12 - in some of our community we I mean we
22:14 - talk about basic water right now we
22:16 - ain't even talking about we ain't even
22:18 - talking about Wi-Fi can I get good water
22:21 - can I get lights right
22:25 - um so so that's what right now kind of
22:27 - gives me pause to to think that our
22:30 - infrastructure primarily in urban
22:32 - communities
22:34 - has not been addressed so we're you're
22:37 - right and say the pandemic just exposed
22:41 - to the larger Community these
22:45 - um grave disadvantages right where kids
22:48 - who who are in urban cores don't have
22:51 - iPads and laptops like when you go to
22:55 - for example in Detroit is West
22:57 - Bloomfield they already have MacBooks at
22:59 - home in fact their parents had to buy
23:01 - the MacBook for them to start the class
23:03 - right that was post that was
23:05 - pre-pandemic so we are already Gravely
23:09 - behind right so I I think
23:13 - my vision or what I would love to see is
23:16 - can we start utilizing technology to
23:18 - give give me the basic things right now
23:20 - I don't think Jack I don't think folks
23:22 - in Jackson Mississippi really care about
23:25 - me giving them an iPad so that they can
23:27 - they can code or they can hack they need
23:30 - water
23:31 - and that's what just gives me great
23:33 - pause because it's not just Jack said it
23:35 - was Flint 10 years ago I mean so I don't
23:39 - know if I can adequately answer that
23:41 - question Samantha because I think the
23:44 - way I feel if I'm being authentic right
23:46 - now is I'm angry that my folks ain't got
23:49 - basic stuff
23:51 - so how can we innovate when the best
23:55 - creators don't even have water right now
24:00 - and and I you're gonna have to tag Lee
24:02 - and Joanne I can't even answer that
24:05 - yeah points were made yeah well I I can
24:10 - jump in with with something that we're
24:12 - doing at least with an IBL uh for two
24:14 - weeks but it's so interesting it's
24:16 - following you because um I'm from
24:18 - Mississippi my family is in Jackson so
24:20 - definitely you know they've been um
24:23 - impacted you know by the water situation
24:25 - just as you know across the others are
24:28 - are impacted as well but one thing and I
24:31 - think I mentioned earlier that I'm
24:32 - working on a team called call for code
24:34 - and so it definitely it takes it's not
24:38 - not IBM alone it's partnership with
24:41 - other you know other companies everybody
24:44 - needs to to
24:46 - um jump in and work on Solutions but
24:48 - with our call for code that is the
24:51 - overall idea it's open source working on
24:53 - some open source Solutions and that's
24:56 - pulling in like I said experience uh you
24:59 - know technologists uh designers people
25:02 - from Global all over the world to work
25:05 - on some of those Solutions and
25:07 - ironically for this year that the thief
25:10 - is sustainability so that really you
25:13 - know dives into the uh you know the the
25:16 - water you know issues the disparities
25:18 - education gaps um I would say back to to
25:23 - answer I think at the top of the
25:25 - question uh Leah had already covered it
25:27 - too I mean it's going to take
25:28 - legislative changes you know policy
25:31 - changes to really make a difference but
25:34 - I will say I mean the technology is
25:37 - there just the base technology I mean
25:39 - you got the software you got the
25:40 - hardware but it just takes uh a lot of
25:44 - us it's going to take everyone uh to
25:46 - really I think impact you know the the
25:49 - main issue I'm I'm with you I I get very
25:52 - angry as well because it's like yes
25:55 - we're doing things and you know others
25:58 - are doing things but the problem's still
26:00 - you know still remain and you can't you
26:02 - just can't affect it for everyone all at
26:05 - the same time it's moving you know too
26:07 - slowly for sure
26:09 - um but um you know together we can start
26:12 - making some impacts
26:15 - Leo that's great I totally agree
26:18 - um I
26:19 - I've also been thinking a lot about
26:22 - about Jackson and and what I can do to
26:25 - play my role to support the communities
26:27 - there
26:28 - um and it it really just gets to the
26:32 - Maslow's hierarchy of needs right so if
26:35 - you're very foundational needs as an
26:38 - individual
26:39 - are not being met as a community are not
26:42 - being met how can you get to that point
26:46 - of living in this ideal state where you
26:51 - can be your most creative your most
26:53 - Innovative if you don't have the basic
26:57 - necessities for life so that is
26:58 - something that we definitely need to
27:00 - think about but I will also say the
27:03 - other side of that is when things like
27:06 - this have happened
27:07 - people have come up with creative ideas
27:10 - of how do we filter the water to you
27:15 - know make it drinkable and different
27:16 - technologies that have come about as a
27:19 - as a result of kind of these
27:21 - um very
27:23 - uh impactful and devastating scenarios
27:27 - so
27:28 - um you know I think we all are thinking
27:30 - through kind of what we can do to
27:31 - support and and and thinking through
27:34 - what new Innovations might different
27:37 - scenarios Spark
27:39 - I I would add if that's okay Samantha I
27:43 - would add that
27:45 - one of the
27:46 - beautiful components of the work that
27:49 - we're doing is when you get uh for
27:53 - summer camp for example 50 girls in a
27:56 - room and they have that space again to
28:01 - create and we had a hackathon this year
28:03 - too uh it's a beautiful it's a beautiful
28:06 - experience it's the impact is it will
28:09 - floor you right because all of a sudden
28:12 - uh black girls are forming their own
28:15 - Community
28:16 - uh they're centering themselves around
28:18 - joy and they're creating these amazing
28:21 - apps that are that can solve real issues
28:24 - right so so I would say
28:27 - um although
28:29 - and I love your theoretical component
28:31 - Leah with Maslow's hierarchy of me but I
28:34 - think
28:35 - um although it does look dire there
28:38 - there are moments of Hope right that we
28:41 - can hold on to and for me I can reflect
28:43 - on those girls being at camp and the
28:46 - smiles on their faces and the way that
28:49 - they light up when they figured out how
28:50 - to do some stuff that I can't do
28:52 - um our education team will see they try
28:55 - to teach us how to code this art last
28:57 - week and I and my I had a stick figure
28:59 - right where our girls were creating
29:02 - these beautiful art images and so
29:05 - um there there is space for us to Hope
29:08 - right but I think we've got to put some
29:10 - pressure on the entire ecosystem from
29:13 - the legislators to these big companies
29:16 - to say we got to do some Grassroots
29:19 - basic stuff
29:23 - yeah so very true I think you've kind of
29:26 - answered this but we did have a question
29:28 - from the audience uh as someone who was
29:30 - breaking through barriers that's why it
29:33 - is so hard to get into the sector how
29:35 - does one find a breakthrough
29:41 - I think that this is going towards a
29:44 - breakthrough into career opportunities I
29:47 - believe that's what this is speaking
29:49 - towards I'll answer it from that lens
29:52 - um for me and it is not easy
29:56 - we know that things can often be more
29:58 - difficult for people who look like us
30:01 - even when we have the same credentials
30:05 - um
30:05 - my strategy I'll speak to my personal
30:07 - experience and my personal strategy my
30:10 - personal experience I've really honed in
30:15 - on something actually that Joanne
30:16 - mentioned earlier was being a constant
30:18 - learner how can I make sure that I am
30:22 - continuing to increase my heart skills
30:25 - my soft skills right so hard skills for
30:29 - this for this particular group would be
30:31 - things like making sure you're learning
30:34 - new coding languages if you can
30:36 - continuing to you know improve your
30:38 - skills those technical skills are so
30:41 - valuable in the industry maybe it's
30:45 - studying project management getting a
30:47 - project management certification
30:50 - um
30:51 - thinking and studying user-centered
30:53 - design user experiences design thinking
30:56 - those types of Prudential soft skills
30:58 - like public speaking
31:02 - um writing different things of
31:04 - relationship building
31:06 - um
31:07 - also networking and mentoring when we
31:10 - talked about mentoring earlier
31:12 - networking and building mutually
31:14 - beneficial relationships making sure
31:16 - that you're building relationships that
31:18 - aren't just meant to be transactional
31:20 - and seeking to get something out of it
31:22 - but also what can you give to the
31:24 - relationship how can it be something
31:27 - that's long term where you can support
31:29 - one another whether that's up here or
31:31 - maybe that's someone who is more
31:34 - experienced than you or has more
31:35 - knowledge so for me those have been ways
31:38 - that I have uh tried to continue to
31:43 - build on my resume but also open
31:46 - different doors to Opportunities and
31:48 - break down some of those barriers
31:54 - anyone would like to add
31:58 - well I think Leah has covered it but I
32:01 - mean Network attending events like this
32:04 - uh you know networking uh it's it's it's
32:07 - all about continuous learning you know
32:10 - as Leah um mentioned as well uh that's
32:13 - the way to if you're talking about
32:14 - breaking into different Industries or
32:17 - just breaking into anything Tech I will
32:19 - say I mean technology it runs the gamut
32:22 - so I mean whether it's in education uh
32:26 - you know it's in healthcare I mean
32:29 - government it's technology is everywhere
32:32 - so it's not really essentially breaking
32:35 - into technology but you do have to learn
32:37 - you know certain skills if it takes uh
32:40 - back to being you know data scientists
32:42 - you know python or R learning things
32:44 - like that
32:46 - um so that you just have to start you
32:47 - got Network you got to reach out uh use
32:50 - all the you know all the social media
32:52 - you know connections that that you can
32:54 - and just show up you know at events um
32:58 - and just ask for help and and you know
33:00 - it can happen
33:05 - thank you and also join those digital
33:08 - communities whether they're on Facebook
33:09 - or elsewhere
33:11 - um there are a lot of opportunities that
33:13 - are presented there are a lot of people
33:14 - that are willing to crowd uh Source
33:17 - resources answer your questions to
33:19 - support you in any way I know I've been
33:21 - an online uh communities like sister
33:24 - Circle black women in Tech where someone
33:26 - says I've just lost my job or I'm having
33:28 - this issue or I'm navigating this
33:30 - difficult conversation with my boss and
33:32 - folks are happily are willing to share
33:35 - their their expertise their experiences
33:38 - their connections so I think being in
33:40 - community can be a major way in which we
33:43 - break through these barriers let's keep
33:45 - it going
33:46 - um next question a reality of tech is
33:49 - that it can be used for good or bad
33:51 - we've seen Tech amplify social justice
33:53 - movements and help us utilize our
33:55 - Collective agency via social media we've
33:57 - also seen how racial and algorithmic
34:00 - biases in Tech can have negatively
34:02 - impacted specific communities via
34:04 - surveillance so surveillance or facial
34:06 - recognition software and even in in ways
34:09 - we're employed as we work toward
34:12 - Innovation how can future innovators
34:14 - intentionally keep the moral and ethical
34:16 - consequences of tech at the Forefront of
34:19 - their work whether it's government
34:20 - regulation or accountability policies
34:23 - let's start with you Joanne
34:27 - okay not to sound like a repeat record
34:29 - this is your broken record but I think
34:31 - Leah covered it you know already and
34:33 - we've talked about it it's essentially
34:35 - you you have to be in the room you need
34:39 - to be part of you know part of the
34:42 - solution uh put I would say one key
34:45 - thing is
34:47 - um taking the initiative to understand
34:51 - uh kind of see through the lens of those
34:54 - in disadvantaged areas or economically
34:57 - disadvantaged that that is going to be
34:59 - key in order to really make a difference
35:02 - and understand how to utilize the
35:05 - technology so technology can you know as
35:08 - as you say it can be it could be used
35:10 - for good for bad but it could be it's
35:12 - used for good mostly so but awareness is
35:16 - very key about like what is it really
35:19 - doing what what are the intended you
35:21 - know outcome and I know especially when
35:24 - you start talking about you know AI you
35:26 - know artificial intelligence I think
35:28 - that gets some people a real you know a
35:31 - little bit of free because it's like
35:33 - okay the you know robots are going to
35:35 - take over or whatever but you know
35:38 - behind those computers behind the robots
35:40 - they're humans so that's why it's very
35:44 - important that you have a diverse uh you
35:47 - know set of people in the room that's
35:49 - working on Solutions so if there's an
35:52 - opportunity for you to be a product
35:54 - manager you know that is very very key
35:57 - because you can really provide a lot of
36:00 - input in how that product is going to
36:03 - you know be developed and how it will
36:05 - eventually uh you know be deployed so so
36:08 - I would say that's key uh we do of
36:10 - course need more you know diverse uh
36:13 - people at the top because those are the
36:15 - ones that are making the decisions uh
36:17 - but so just continue back once again
36:19 - back to learning you know figuring out
36:22 - you know the various angles uh where you
36:24 - can can be in the room or you know at
36:26 - the table table even if you're not at
36:28 - the table you know once again just
36:30 - somewhere but making a contribution uh
36:33 - you know to the solution that I think
36:35 - that would that would be that's one of
36:36 - the key things
36:40 - that I think what what Joanne just said
36:43 - is so powerful because she gave us I
36:47 - will say this what we've seen with
36:49 - technology over the last 10 years
36:53 - um the ability to utilize social media
36:56 - as a form of activism right I believe I
36:59 - believe that
37:01 - a couple days after George Floyd was
37:03 - murdered it was like eight million
37:05 - tweets that use the hashtag black lives
37:08 - matter right so to be able to utilize
37:12 - social media in a way that can Galvanize
37:16 - folks and build a communication system
37:19 - across the globe right is immensely
37:24 - powerful I mean you think if they would
37:25 - have had that in in 68 right uh I think
37:29 - my My Hope has been how do you take that
37:32 - massive engagement and shift it from uh
37:37 - the social space to
37:39 - actual uh material change and I think
37:43 - what Joanne just said is exactly that I
37:46 - think she's saying for us to really
37:49 - utilize technology as a solution to some
37:53 - of the social experiences that we have
37:54 - how do we put our folks in a position
37:57 - like a product manager that could tell
38:00 - Apple don't you put out that phone and
38:03 - you know good and well the facial
38:04 - recognition is biased right
38:07 - it does not adequately see my skin tone
38:09 - and or
38:11 - um you have these new vehicles that are
38:14 - supposed to be self-driving and you
38:16 - hitting black folks right because you
38:18 - don't recognize us
38:20 - um and I'm smiling but it's also it's
38:21 - it's not it's you know
38:24 - um
38:24 - so I love the fact that connecting both
38:28 - what Leah and Joanna is saying they are
38:30 - really diving on to Solutions right
38:33 - which which I adore
38:35 - um so how do we move from that matter
38:38 - massive way we can benefit from
38:40 - technology in the social space and
38:42 - engaging socially to the material change
38:46 - the material change and using technology
38:49 - as a solution for an app like cop stop
38:53 - or you know identifying as Leah said
38:57 - proactively the ways Tech can
39:00 - potentially be biased but solving those
39:02 - problems by having the right people in
39:04 - the spaces to make those decisions
39:09 - I totally agree I was going to mention
39:13 - product management I'm so glad that both
39:16 - of you already brought it up
39:18 - um I think particularly in this room
39:21 - that is specially curated for black
39:23 - women and girls it's important that we
39:25 - think about these types of careers where
39:28 - yes we are underrepresented however we
39:32 - bring a unique lens and unique
39:35 - experience to these types of roles right
39:38 - for a product manager or a technical
39:41 - program manager for example so in these
39:43 - types of positions you have a
39:46 - significant level of influence over the
39:49 - entire product development process from
39:51 - start to finish right you have the skill
39:55 - set to be able to understand and speak
39:58 - the language of the engineers and the
40:01 - technical folks working on the product
40:03 - while also translating for the people in
40:07 - the business who are driving
40:09 - um towards the you know the the business
40:12 - goals right and and you're the person
40:15 - who bridges that Gap and makes sure that
40:18 - along the way the right questions are
40:20 - being asked you know you're considering
40:23 - for all of the different factors that
40:25 - need to come into account and as black
40:27 - women we have a unique land through
40:30 - which we look at the world right and so
40:33 - and and you know we have that in common
40:36 - but we also have unique experiences
40:38 - right so what are your unique
40:39 - experiences that allow you to think
40:42 - about
40:44 - um how different people might engage
40:46 - with a product and ensuring that you you
40:48 - can be a voice in the room that say we
40:51 - need to diversify the the the data set
40:54 - and make sure we're including more users
40:58 - who
40:59 - of of X background right and making sure
41:03 - that all of that is considered along the
41:05 - way so definitely do consider
41:08 - um careers and in either you know
41:10 - technical program management or product
41:13 - management because as having that black
41:15 - girls cold technical Foundation is a
41:18 - great differentiator
41:19 - um even if you don't desire to be an
41:21 - engineer there are other opportunities
41:23 - and and
41:25 - um career paths that will allow you to
41:27 - still utilize that skill set and and uh
41:30 - you know kind of different differentiate
41:32 - you
41:33 - um amongst the the applicant pool for
41:35 - such roles
41:39 - yes yes
41:41 - um also if if anyone's interested in
41:43 - kind of learning more about this topic
41:44 - I'm in the middle of reading uh race
41:47 - after technology by ruha Benjamin um
41:49 - where they discussed abolitionist tools
41:52 - for the new gym code
41:54 - um and it goes into historical context
41:56 - current realities and future outlook
41:58 - um there's a lot of really good
42:00 - information in there that we can kind of
42:02 - equip ourselves to come to these tables
42:04 - and talk about these things
42:06 - utilizing broader data research and and
42:10 - just knowing the language to use as we
42:12 - discuss these things because these are
42:14 - age-old issues
42:16 - um that are now connected to
42:18 - far-reaching Technologies so there's
42:21 - there's a lot of work to be done and I
42:22 - think all of us equipping ourselves
42:23 - being aware and not being afraid to
42:25 - adjust these Topics in any place in
42:28 - which we hold any amount of power or
42:30 - influence is important uh in the name of
42:32 - the book again because someone just
42:33 - asked is race after technology by ruha
42:38 - ruha treatment
42:40 - all right so let's keep the conversation
42:43 - moving let's talk about the progress and
42:46 - call to action
42:48 - circling back on your journey how have
42:50 - you seen progress in your sector
42:53 - what legacies Will Young innovators be
42:56 - building on
42:59 - and let's start with Leo
43:03 - sure
43:05 - um I think when I think about the Legacy
43:09 - um we've already touched on the fact
43:10 - that none of this is new our ancestors
43:14 - were extremely Innovative and creative
43:17 - people and we are products of their
43:20 - genius and
43:22 - keeping that in mind is one of the
43:25 - things that keeps me going
43:27 - um
43:28 - there's a a concept African concept of
43:32 - Sankofa you know understanding the past
43:35 - so that you can best forward and and
43:37 - drive towards the future
43:41 - um knowing our history and the shoulders
43:44 - upon which we stand uh is really
43:47 - important and also it keeps it keeps me
43:50 - going because
43:52 - this work is hard right if you choose to
43:57 - actually take a stand and be a person
43:59 - who wants to speak up and be that Agent
44:02 - of Change it can be challenging so along
44:06 - the way it's really important that we
44:11 - take care of ourselves right make sure
44:14 - that we're pouring into ourselves
44:16 - and that if we're not you know
44:19 - prioritizing our our Wellness physically
44:22 - mentally emotionally spiritually we
44:25 - can't do this work and so
44:28 - I really try to hone in on that
44:32 - um folks like Dr Benjamin who Samantha
44:35 - mentioned
44:37 - um there are just so many folks who are
44:40 - continuing to drive this work forward
44:42 - continue to study and read those books
44:46 - and think about
44:49 - um Dr Charlton McGowan has a book who
44:52 - talks about the black history and
44:55 - Technology you have to forgive me
44:57 - because I don't remember the name of the
44:59 - book but if you look up Dr Charles
45:01 - Charlton mcgillin it will come up
45:05 - um but just keep that in mind and that
45:09 - and that's something that keeps me
45:10 - grounded and keeps me going along this
45:12 - journey so that Legacy is very much
45:14 - important
45:18 - I think uh for me looking at the
45:21 - progress in the sector and what legacies
45:23 - we think young people will build on I go
45:26 - back to my experience with the girls
45:28 - over this summer we had
45:30 - technically six summer camps that uh I
45:34 - jokingly tell the team we were in it we
45:36 - don't know what happened with the rest
45:38 - of the world for those five camps five
45:40 - six camps but I will tell you
45:43 - um uh even though we might have been
45:45 - physically tired we were emotionally
45:49 - full because we we could see firsthand
45:53 - after not having in-person camps for two
45:56 - years or so because of covet you can see
46:00 - the way when a young lady gets it right
46:04 - when she's figured it out when she is
46:06 - able to
46:08 - um create something uh I mean we had
46:11 - girls at the Atlanta Camp during lunch
46:14 - time doing races with each other so I
46:16 - would say when we talk about
46:18 - their ability to innovate and the Legacy
46:22 - the legacy is
46:24 - um really about whole person development
46:26 - it is not only about the technology it
46:30 - is also about experiencing Joy it is
46:34 - about their leadership Journey right it
46:37 - is about community and then lastly as we
46:41 - like to say is also about economic
46:43 - Mobility right and and changing our
46:47 - material reality so for me that's what I
46:52 - see as the legacy of us continuing to
46:55 - encourage the girls that are on this
46:57 - call watching this session the uh you
47:01 - know five thousand ten thousand girls
47:03 - that will reach in a year
47:05 - those girls being able to form Community
47:07 - where they feel safe to create to
47:11 - experience their joy and and to to have
47:15 - the life that they want to live
47:23 - and and I'll just finish up uh Leah and
47:26 - Patrice you know have pretty much
47:27 - covered it as well
47:30 - um once again you know continuous
47:32 - learning I I would say the um the Advent
47:35 - of of there are so many ways of getting
47:39 - um getting upskilled getting educated
47:42 - you know getting a certifications
47:44 - getting badges just learning there's you
47:46 - know I don't want to advertise for
47:48 - different companies but you know like
47:50 - Coursera courses seeing a lot of
47:51 - pre-courses just a lot of online courses
47:54 - IBM by the way actually has a lot has a
47:57 - platform as well where continuous
48:00 - learning so definitely take advantage of
48:03 - all of those you know opportunities I
48:05 - think that is something that has
48:07 - progressed you know especially during my
48:09 - career I mean just so easy to to learn I
48:13 - mean we have a lot of internal learning
48:14 - but you know there are there are
48:16 - multiple uh external uh vehicles to
48:19 - learn from so I would say just incur
48:22 - urge just to continue uh continuous
48:25 - learning because that is going to to be
48:28 - key uh to the Future for the future
48:31 - innovators
48:32 - um the other thing is
48:34 - um wherever you are if there I mean if
48:36 - you are working or you know when you do
48:38 - start working uh there are various
48:40 - groups I think Leah touched on some
48:42 - there are different groups within
48:43 - companies you know the Affinity groups
48:45 - or the uh business resource groups uh
48:48 - that is very very key uh that wasn't
48:51 - available many many years ago so utilize
48:54 - those um you know vehicles uh you know
48:57 - to continue to innovate and learn as
48:59 - well I think that's that's the only
49:01 - additional uh thing I can can say
49:05 - I'll just add one last thing in terms of
49:08 - progress I do think that we have made
49:10 - tremendous progress even this is a very
49:13 - nascent space still when you think about
49:15 - inclusive technology or Equitable
49:17 - technology and conversations and
49:19 - resources around this
49:21 - um and so I think that there is
49:24 - tremendous opportunity to continue
49:26 - building and only amplify uh the work
49:29 - that has already been done so if I do
49:31 - want I did want to just circle back and
49:33 - acknowledge that I do think that
49:36 - um particularly in the last Maybe
49:40 - five or ten years there's been a lot of
49:43 - evolution growth and progress
49:45 - um and you know as Joanne mentioned that
49:48 - continuous learning allows you to kind
49:50 - of stay abreast and on the front curve
49:52 - of this ever evolving uh still growing
49:56 - and nascent uh space that we're in
49:59 - yeah I would agree with that yeah
50:01 - because technology as they say you know
50:03 - it doesn't stand still you know so it's
50:06 - continuing continuing to evolve
50:10 - yes I'd have to agree I would think what
50:13 - what's so beautiful is when you see just
50:17 - folks finding each other because they've
50:19 - been able to use different technology
50:20 - different platforms social media to find
50:23 - corners of the internet with people that
50:26 - they can relate to on multiple levels
50:28 - and start building together so in the
50:31 - way that
50:32 - um these inequalities the systemic
50:34 - issues exist you see so many individuals
50:38 - or even smaller Collective groups having
50:41 - even greater impact for their
50:42 - communities because they can leverage
50:44 - these Technologies they can leverage
50:45 - these tools they can self-educate they
50:48 - can mobilize they can immediately
50:50 - respond they can get to the heart of
50:53 - these issues and have the conversation
50:55 - you don't need to feel alone you don't
50:57 - need to wonder if you're the only one
50:58 - thinking or wanting or creating you can
51:01 - find someone to create with across the
51:03 - street or across the world and as many
51:07 - issues as there are in this world
51:09 - there's individual Minds with a
51:12 - willingness to try to tackle them and no
51:14 - matter how niched or or how broad that
51:17 - is so like as we talk about progress and
51:19 - call to action a big part of what we're
51:22 - seeing now and what we saw during the
51:23 - pandemic and we when we saw we've seen
51:26 - in recent social justice movements as
51:28 - people being able to self-identify uh
51:31 - mobilize and do the work wherever they
51:34 - are and that makes it more inclusive
51:36 - that makes it
51:38 - um uh more fast acting and that is
51:42 - something that I think will continue to
51:43 - be a powerful tool for further
51:45 - Generations even as you get into the
51:46 - metaverse even even as you think about
51:49 - how you're going to operationalize
51:51 - Future technology so get taking your
51:54 - seat at whatever table you can create
51:56 - not necessarily always having to
51:59 - um try to fight for a seat at someone
52:00 - else's table so so let's keep the
52:02 - conversation going what opportunities
52:04 - roles exist that uh to affect change in
52:08 - the tech space What should Young
52:10 - stemmists be doing now to build their
52:13 - way towards these impactful roles and
52:15 - what resources have been helpful in your
52:16 - journey
52:19 - yeah I'll jump in um I think we've
52:21 - touched touched a lot of different
52:24 - um areas of opportunity in the space
52:27 - whether that be in the private sector
52:30 - um in product technical program
52:31 - management project management
52:35 - um a user user experience design
52:38 - um engineering there there are so many
52:41 - um ways to address it in the private
52:43 - sector in the public sector there are
52:45 - opportunities at all level of government
52:47 - whether that and I know I mentioned the
52:49 - hill earlier but I will be remiss not to
52:51 - mention the importance of state and
52:52 - local government as well in ensuring
52:55 - access and advocacy
52:57 - um and access to resources for
52:59 - marginalized communities
53:02 - um there the the opportunities are are
53:04 - endless so it's really a matter of
53:07 - carving out the space and and figuring
53:09 - out what area you want to tackle and and
53:11 - also recognizing that you can change so
53:14 - I have done so many different things
53:17 - over the course of my relatively short
53:19 - career already because I've been trying
53:21 - to figure out and act that question of
53:23 - which way is the best path to address
53:25 - these very critical questions is it
53:27 - through the government is it through uh
53:29 - policy in the nonprofit sector is it
53:31 - actually being at the at the table or
53:33 - trying to pull up my own chair at the
53:35 - table in the private sector and in big
53:37 - Tech
53:38 - um so you know think about what what you
53:40 - might want to uh do and that uh breadth
53:45 - of experience also is very much a
53:48 - selling point when you come into any of
53:49 - those spaces being able to say well I've
53:51 - thought about it from this angle and I
53:53 - have experience that I can bring to the
53:55 - table from each of those different areas
53:57 - that's really important and that
53:58 - continuous Learning Journey definitely
54:00 - helps along the way with that
54:03 - yeah and and that very well said Leah
54:06 - and and I'll just add because I know we
54:07 - talked about you know product management
54:08 - project but any of those areas you know
54:11 - should be a focused data analyst just
54:13 - wherever you feel comfortable
54:14 - comfortable
54:16 - um and then from an industry uh as Leah
54:19 - I mean with the even though I've been
54:20 - with IBM but within there I've had uh
54:24 - opportunity to be exposed to various
54:25 - Industries within IBM so you know
54:28 - government Healthcare one of my
54:30 - favorites and you know Healthcare there
54:33 - are so many changes are so there are
54:35 - plenty of opportunity for some
54:37 - Innovation there uh with regard to
54:39 - health care just as with others but
54:41 - government insurance uh banking I mean
54:44 - there are the lots of of Industries in
54:47 - which you can apply you know those
54:49 - skills so I would say definitely just
54:52 - you know pick up the the key skills I
54:54 - mean uh Leah had started off earlier
54:56 - saying you know so you got the hard
54:58 - skills but you know the soft skills talk
55:00 - with get get an opportunity or learn to
55:03 - to work with with clients and partners
55:06 - and you know just it even within your
55:08 - community as I mentioned very big on
55:10 - volunteering so that is a way to get
55:13 - involved with your schools I mean that
55:15 - definitely they would really love you to
55:17 - go in and just talk you can learn a lot
55:19 - from the kids and from the teachers find
55:22 - out what they need help with as well so
55:25 - just just pick up the hard skills and
55:27 - you know definitely focus on the the
55:29 - soft skills and and you'll you'll be
55:31 - fine
55:33 - and I I would say to wrap it up
55:38 - um
55:39 - BGC alumni our alumni uh you got a
55:43 - portal
55:44 - that we have launched that will have
55:46 - tons of resources for you to dive into
55:50 - you have a team dedicated to servicing
55:54 - you and helping you identify uh any of
55:57 - the tools that you might need and so I
56:00 - would just say
56:02 - a action item for you is to stay
56:06 - connected to BGC as a community that
56:08 - wants you to do well and wants you to
56:10 - reach your full potential that is the
56:13 - action item that I think stimulus should
56:15 - pursue to allow us to continue to engage
56:18 - with you so that we can help you get to
56:20 - the next level that's what we're here
56:21 - for
