01:39 - just want to chat with you a little bit
01:40 - Mackenzie about this opportunity and
01:42 - what it means for high schoolers like

01:46 - introduce yourself to our viewers hi
01:48 - everyone I'm Mackenzie and I'm a 10th
01:50 - grader from South Carolina I love coding
01:52 - in anything Sim related for example I
01:55 - love robotics I've been participating in
01:57 - competing in robotics since third grade
01:58 - I started as one of the team Builders
02:00 - and then I eventually became a
02:01 - programmer I've done Lego robotics and
02:03 - tetric robots through several stem camps
02:05 - I attended I fell in love with coding
02:07 - well McKenzie is basically a stem
02:09 - celebrity I mean she was chosen as a
02:12 - rising star to represent her home state
02:14 - of South Carolina as part of the million
02:17 - girls moonshot flight crew tell us a
02:19 - little bit about that so Milling girls
02:21 - moonshot is a youth program whose
02:22 - mission is to amplify the power of using
02:24 - after school and stem learning to engage
02:26 - 1 million more girls in stem I'm so
02:29 - honored they chose me and I'm hoping I
02:30 - can share my love coding to inspire more
02:32 - girls to get into Tech okay so Mackenzie
02:35 - what would you say to our viewers out
02:37 - there who are thinking about coding a
02:39 - piece of art to get some of this
02:40 - scholarship money but are maybe too
02:42 - nervous or aren't sure about it what
02:43 - would your advice be coding seemed
02:45 - really intimidating to me at first when
02:47 - I went to my first robotics meeting they
02:49 - were only boys and it was a very scary
02:50 - experience for me but I am so glad that
02:53 - I stuck with it because there are so
02:54 - many amazing things you can build with
02:55 - code it's kind of like learning a new
02:57 - language it takes practice and hard work
02:59 - but the great thing is you don't have to
03:00 - do it alone you can code with your
03:02 - friends or you can even cut along with
03:03 - Jillian she's an amazing teacher give
03:05 - coding a try it opened up so many doors
03:07 - for me and I know it can do the same for
03:09 - you too amazing okay everybody you heard
03:12 - it from Mackenzie give this a try we
03:14 - can't wait to see what you create and we
03:16 - can't wait to give away this scholarship
