00:00 - one thing lesson that I've learned that
00:01 - I want to share is that you can do both
00:03 - so I think there's this thing where you
00:05 - have to be either a starving artist or
00:06 - you have to you know have a career first
00:08 - off you can love your day job right
00:09 - obviously you would want to you don't
00:11 - want to just have a job but you can have
00:13 - a career you can have the security that
00:14 - it brings and not have to worry about oh
00:16 - you know maybe I didn't sell a piece
00:17 - this week or maybe I didn't you know I
00:19 - haven't I haven't made anything that's
00:21 - profitable because at the end of the day
00:22 - that shouldn't be the goal you should
00:23 - just want to create and then when you're
00:25 - off from that job you can create like
00:26 - you I feel like there's a lot of stigma
00:28 - about like I said Gee you got to devote
00:30 - to either one and if you if you're
00:31 - career driven you're giving up on your
00:33 - dreams and if you just want to be a
00:34 - starving artist you know
00:36 - you're risking that you know maybe you
00:38 - don't you're not successful but I found
00:40 - that doing both it's completely doable
00:43 - and um I find joy in doing both and
00:45 - sometimes people at my job you're like
00:47 - why are you still working I'm just like
00:48 - I I enjoy still doing this and doing the
00:51 - other one I don't feel like I'm
00:52 - sacrificing my business
00:54 - to do you know to have a job a career
