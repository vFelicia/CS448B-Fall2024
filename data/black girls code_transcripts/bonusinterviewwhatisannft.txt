00:00 - what's up my brilliant coders it's your
00:03 - girl Jillian and I'm here in the code
00:05 - zone for another surprise code Along
00:07 - video you thought we were done no we are
00:10 - just switching things up today we're
00:12 - doing things a little differently we're
00:14 - gonna mix it up with a one-on-one
00:15 - conversation to discuss everything nft
00:18 - my favorite
00:21 - [Music]
00:26 - now before we jump in let's cover the
00:28 - basics so what is an nft well an nft is
00:32 - short for non-fungible token like most I
00:35 - was like what is non-fungible it's where
00:38 - we put the fun in digital you know
00:40 - because fun is in fungibles
00:43 - get it non-fungible means that there is
00:46 - only one of each token yep just one it's
00:50 - extremely unique like you and that's why
00:53 - so many people have become obsessed with
00:55 - collecting them did you ever collect
00:57 - Pokemon cards back in the day you could
00:59 - collect them and trade them with your
01:01 - friends people even sold them for
01:04 - thousands of dollars some of the rarest
01:06 - ones are now worth millions of dollars
01:09 - well nfts are basically our new age
01:13 - Collectibles so when an artist develops
01:16 - an nft they create a record of their
01:18 - digital or physical assets sold and
01:21 - traded on a specific blockchain a
01:24 - blockchain is an online database that is
01:26 - shared amongst a Cyber Network different
01:29 - cryptocurrencies and nft platforms use
01:32 - blockchains to securely share digital
01:35 - files and funds within their third-party
01:38 - Network think about it as your online
01:40 - security system so since we're talking
01:43 - crypto we have to cover for
01:45 - cryptocurrency
01:46 - well cryptocurrency is a digital
01:49 - currency it's like an alternative form
01:51 - of payment to our boring cash or credit
01:54 - card options that most people are used
01:56 - to it's created using encryption
01:58 - algorithms to transform plain text Data
02:01 - into ciphertext now I know that's a lot
02:04 - of digital talks and a lot of
02:06 - information but the most important
02:07 - takeaway is this an nft is a unique
02:10 - record there's only one of each and it's
02:13 - extremely valuable to help us chat about
02:16 - everything nfts today I'm so excited to
02:19 - introduce you to today's guest Imani
02:21 - larussa is a two-time emmy-winning
02:23 - motion graphics artist nft entrepreneur
02:26 - and the founder of the non-profit
02:29 - organization jumpstart designers
02:32 - welcome hi first I'd love to know your
02:35 - story so how did you begin developing
02:37 - nfts so I think it all starts from when
02:42 - I was like a kid and getting into
02:44 - digital art so I would make music videos
02:47 - with my sister it then spiraled into
02:50 - like making videos in high school like
02:53 - in the film program I started pursuing a
02:56 - bachelor's degree in digital filmmaking
02:58 - and then from there I started working at
03:01 - CBS News and while I was there I was
03:04 - making like digital art all the time so
03:05 - I would work there 40 hours a week and
03:07 - then an additional 20 30 hours a week on
03:10 - top of that just like making Motion
03:12 - Graphics stuff for potential like
03:15 - artists that I wanted to work with and
03:17 - that led me to working with like the
03:21 - biggest record labels in the world and
03:23 - then when nfts arrived I was like like
03:27 - you get paid for doing this like I've
03:29 - been doing it for free for like
03:30 - Instagram likes and so like it was it
03:33 - was a lot more difficult for digital
03:35 - artists to be able to like sell their
03:37 - art and when this came out I was like
03:39 - no-brainer like this is something that I
03:41 - need to do and pursue so yeah it's been
03:44 - a journey for sure that's awesome yeah
03:47 - so do you remember your very first nft
03:49 - sold oh my God like it was yesterday
03:53 - um I was still like doing a whole bunch
03:56 - of like music industry stuff and the
03:58 - thing with those deadlines is that like
04:00 - they need it yesterday so it's like boom
04:02 - boom and so in between projects I
04:06 - probably had like a day or two to like
04:08 - chill out and in that time I would try
04:11 - to make work that was just for my
04:13 - Instagram and so I made this piece with
04:16 - the intention of like trying to manifest
04:18 - getting on one of these nft platforms
04:20 - and I was like this is going to be the
04:22 - first piece that I put out and I ended
04:24 - up getting an invitation on foundation
04:27 - and I put it out and like within 45
04:30 - minutes I got a bid of like fifteen
04:33 - hundred dollars what is absolutely crazy
04:35 - about it was the person who bought the
04:38 - piece for 3 thousand dollars was a 15
04:41 - year old uh digital artist
04:44 - it just goes to show like it's just a
04:46 - crazy weird Market ah
04:49 - programs and tools d you use I use
04:53 - primarily Adobe After Effects with a
04:55 - little sprinkle of Cinema 4D so I am
04:58 - like Motion Graphics native and so after
05:01 - effects has just been my ride or die I
05:04 - don't know what I would do without After
05:06 - Effects and it's so funny because it's
05:08 - such a daunting looking program
05:11 - um but I wouldn't have it any other way
05:13 - so what platform options are there for
05:16 - selling nfts and what platforms do you
05:18 - use I always say like spend two months
05:21 - researching and in the space before you
05:24 - even think about dropping something
05:26 - there's things like open C open C is
05:30 - like for like the public and then you
05:32 - have Foundation which is artist invite
05:35 - so if I am on Foundation I have an
05:38 - invite and I can invite you then they
05:40 - have super rare which is like one of the
05:42 - most like prestigious nft platforms to
05:45 - get on so it's kind of like finding what
05:47 - works for you and just building from
05:50 - that so can you tell us how you go about
05:52 - setting up a profile on one of these
05:54 - platforms it's really easy like the big
05:58 - thing is like creating a metamask wallet
06:00 - and that basically connects to like your
06:03 - Google Chrome extension each platform is
06:06 - different but they all kind of rely on
06:09 - the same thing of having a wallet for it
06:12 - okay yeah so is the platform that you
06:14 - use now different from the one you used
06:16 - as a beginner yeah for sure when I
06:19 - started I used foundation and I got
06:23 - accepted to super rare So since that
06:26 - happened
06:27 - um I've been on there are there any
06:28 - platforms that are like beginner
06:30 - friendly that you would recommend open C
06:32 - is definitely the beginner friendly
06:35 - because you get to understand the
06:37 - process of how the menting goes but
06:39 - there's also like gaspies included so if
06:42 - you want to just learn how it goes like
06:43 - I'm sure there's tutorials out there
06:45 - that just shows how to do that so that
06:48 - you don't have to waste any money do you
06:50 - have any tips for viewers who want to
06:52 - monetize their work just being a good
06:55 - artist doesn't necessarily mean that
06:58 - your work is going to sell I think the
07:01 - big thing is going into it
07:04 - knowing that you're going to invest more
07:07 - time than anything else I don't want
07:10 - people to just quit their jobs and be
07:11 - like I'm gonna do nfts now like that's
07:13 - just it's not realistic but it's 100 has
07:17 - so many opportunities so a lot of people
07:20 - ask why are nfts so important in your
07:23 - opinion why do you think nfts are
07:26 - important
07:27 - I think mfts provide opportunities I
07:31 - feel like I've made my best work with
07:33 - not having the restrictions of working
07:35 - under a client so what advice would you
07:38 - give to viewers who want a career in the
07:39 - nft industry it is not a Sprint it is a
07:43 - marathon and don't quit your job invest
07:47 - your time into it and spend all the
07:50 - energy that you have to just do research
07:52 - and like that starts opening doors that
07:54 - starts bringing more inspiration and
07:56 - that eventually will lead you into being
07:59 - able to monetize it and eventually
08:00 - become an artist in the space it is a
08:04 - balance that is worth figuring it out
08:06 - yeah yeah I definitely agree yeah so are
08:09 - there any mentorships or educational
08:12 - programs that you would recommend for
08:14 - artists who want to be in the nft
08:15 - industry it's something that I have been
08:17 - really focused on especially with my
08:20 - non-profit jumpstart designers so our
08:22 - main goal is to get computers and Adobe
08:25 - CC digital art programs to kids and
08:28 - underserved communities but not only
08:30 - that like we don't just want to give
08:31 - them the tools and be like okay like
08:33 - have fun like we want to be like here's
08:34 - the tools and here's like courses and
08:38 - here's mentorship I come from a
08:40 - background where I didn't have a whole
08:42 - lot of money and so my mom went to go
08:44 - buy me a laptop and her credit card
08:46 - declined and we'd like walked out
08:48 - empty-handed and it was it was
08:50 - absolutely devastating because I'd
08:53 - realize like like as a kid it was like
08:56 - when you grow up you could be whoever
08:59 - you want and as long as you put your
09:01 - mind towards it like that's what you
09:02 - will become and it's like well that's
09:04 - not necessarily true for people who
09:06 - don't have money yeah like this is a
09:08 - like money driven field you need to have
09:11 - a computer you need to have the digital
09:12 - art program so it just made me realize
09:15 - that like wow I ended up being able to
09:20 - get that laptop and I think about like
09:23 - what happened to the kid that never went
09:25 - back and got that laptop like what
09:27 - happened where do they end up that's why
09:30 - like we have basically brought together
09:32 - like the top nft artists in the space
09:35 - and we're raising money to get computers
09:39 - for kids so it was awesome well
09:41 - congratulations thank you
09:43 - I don't know about you but I had so much
09:46 - fun today thanks for coming by to the
09:48 - code Zone I really hoped you enjoyed our
09:51 - little nft talk now you're ready to
