00:09 - we love black
00:24 - girls so 4 years old I wanted to learn
00:28 - how to swim I beg my parents parents
00:30 - please let me take some lessons let me
00:32 - do it he said no you're too little
00:34 - you're too young way to older so then
00:37 - one day my little cousin who was three
00:39 - at the time fell into the pool at the
00:42 - other side and not even thinking I
00:45 - jumped into the water doggy pedal my
00:48 - little way over to her heard my aunt
00:49 - screaming and wailing in the background
00:52 - and I pulled her to the side of the pool
00:54 - so from that moment I became known to my
00:56 - family as the girl who taught herself
00:58 - how to swim and I used use that story
01:00 - because it's parallel to my career
01:02 - because each step that I've taken I've
01:05 - either been the only black person the
01:07 - only woman and and in this case um I am
01:11 - a black woman that works in Tech here in
01:13 - San
01:16 - Francisco right now in the Silicon
01:19 - Valley in the tech industry you only
01:20 - have 5% of people of color who are
01:23 - founders and in many companies that are
01:26 - popular Facebook to Google to LinkedIn
01:29 - you only have one % who are uh people of
01:32 - color that work in Tech so that's one
01:35 - sense of urgency you have these fields
01:37 - where there is a great NE need for
01:39 - employment um but yet we don't have
01:42 - enough people who know how to do the
01:46 - job I believe that if you Empower a girl
01:50 - you have the potential to change her
01:52 - community and to change her future and
01:54 - when you teach her the skills and you
01:56 - give her the tools and the technology to
01:58 - share that story you have the
02:00 - opportunity to change the
02:08 - world today we built our Lego robot
02:12 - called Bella but my team called it
02:15 - Isabella and we learned how to use the
02:17 - computer to program it and um show it
02:20 - what ways to go like what direction and
02:24 - it always say it says stuff like it says
02:28 - hooray hooray thank you and goodbye um I
02:32 - liked how we got to um work on computers
02:39 - and we got to actually build the robot
02:41 - it's pretty awesome and it can roar and
02:58 - S
03:02 - in terms of women of color and
03:04 - Engineering I think that strides have
03:06 - been made but there's still this
03:09 - enormous Gap in terms of having women
03:12 - and especially women of color in the
03:15 - field of engineering and I say
03:17 - Engineering in general because there are
03:20 - inner like subcategories of engineering
03:23 - but across the board there are few women
03:27 - of color in positions of authority in in
03:32 - the field in general my name is ALU I'm
03:35 - doing a PhD here in computer science and
03:37 - education with Alice's group and I'm
03:39 - almost done with my PhD to Summers AG go
03:43 - thank to Summers AG go I taught a middle
03:47 - school computer science class at
03:49 - Stanford University for Middle School
03:52 - Earth and in that class we actually had
03:54 - the students on a whim design robotics
03:58 - excellent so it's the same exact you see
04:01 - it's the same exact similar similar
04:03 - robot that you're using in here so you
04:06 - guys have actually learned some of the
04:08 - things that we take to build as an
04:10 - aspect of this and I hope is that as you
04:14 - guys have handson Project work that
04:16 - black do code is creating for you you
04:19 - get a more intuitive sense of what you
04:21 - can actually do with
04:25 - computation I think for the first time
04:27 - these girls are began to see that oh I
04:29 - can do this too I think that's literally
04:31 - what it is like oh there's a space for
04:34 - me here and oh I can actually do this
04:36 - and this is fun I want to do this to me
04:39 - I think that's probably the core of
04:40 - black girl good and I think more
04:42 - importantly not just the girls the
04:44 - parents the parents are beginning to
04:47 - understand that this is important that
04:49 - their daughters love it and they want to
04:51 - empower their daughters to be ready for
04:52 - the 21st century so I really think it's
04:55 - more evangelizing to the parents because
04:57 - children don't have any limitations in
04:59 - them they don't know any better they
05:00 - just want to do whatever they have no
05:02 - sense of limitation it is the parents
05:04 - the adults in their lives that have
05:06 - those kinds of limitations or they
05:08 - haven't seen those images
05:11 - um the presence of having women of color
05:14 - is so important because I think that it
05:16 - would encourage
05:17 - more um children both male and female of
05:22 - children of color to see someone that
05:25 - looks like them to see somebody that
05:27 - they can strive to be like because it it
05:30 - helps to have somebody to look up to
05:32 - have somebody to say hey I could be like
05:34 - that person black girls code gives girls
05:37 - the opportunity to own their story to
05:39 - own their Brilliance and then share it
05:42 - with their communities with their
05:43 - families and then hopefully with the
05:46 - world if they so decide to take u a
05:49 - career path in
05:51 - technology in the future I hope that
05:54 - there is no need for a black girls code
05:57 - because I hope that black black girls
06:00 - will be dominating these Tech spaces
06:03 - that there no longer will be a need to
06:05 - create a safe space because we're
06:07 - already there that enough of us have
06:09 - already showed up that when girls come
06:12 - behind us they feel comfortable they see
06:14 - a mirror to themselves and they know
06:17 - that this is something that they can
06:28 - do
