00:04 - oh my God you're already back wait did
00:07 - you knock
00:08 - oh my gosh you weren't supposed to see
00:10 - that uh okay just act surprised when I
00:13 - tell you this is the art we'll be making
00:14 - today I don't want any spoilers all
00:16 - right be right back
00:18 - [Music]
00:25 - it's okay
00:26 - all right then what's up my brilliant
00:28 - coders it's your girl Jillian and I'll
00:30 - be your host as we learn how to code
00:32 - digital art in this series from black
00:34 - girls code now in this video we'll
00:37 - continue to learn how to create new
00:39 - shapes in p5.js and make a second piece
00:42 - of artwork which you've never ever seen
00:44 - before which I'll reveal right now ready
00:48 - [Music]
00:51 - ah we love a reveal when I designed this
00:54 - digital art I wanted to Channel all the
00:57 - great artwork with empowering social
00:59 - justice messages that I've seen before
01:01 - so in my own artwork I chose purple to
01:04 - draw in the viewer's eye I also included
01:07 - three fists as symbols of empowerment
01:09 - and unity and I decided to put a cell
01:12 - phone in the center of the image because
01:14 - in the digital age our phones are one of
01:17 - the most powerful tools we can use to
01:20 - let our voice be heard and advocate for
01:22 - causes that matter to us next I drew a
01:24 - microphone to represent the power of
01:26 - using our voices and last but not least
01:29 - I drew a pencil and brush to represent
01:31 - how our writing and art can be powerful
01:34 - tools of protest advocacy and activism
01:37 - as well so I hope that the art we create
01:40 - in these videos can inspire you to
01:42 - continue to use your various crafts and
01:44 - talents to make our world a better place
01:46 - feeling inspired to get started all
01:49 - right then let's get into it here at the
01:51 - code zone so as you probably remember
01:54 - we'll first need to set up our canvas in
01:57 - your text editor we are going to change
01:59 - the default canvas values from 400 to
02:02 - 600. so now it is 600 by 600. this will
02:07 - give us a little more space for our
02:08 - shapes then change the background color
02:11 - in the draw function to purple
02:14 - this looks good but I'd like a lighter
02:16 - color purple in order to do that I'll
02:19 - click on the small box next to my color
02:21 - and change it to anyone on the gradient
02:24 - and voila we have a light purple
02:28 - background
02:29 - okay so now I'm gonna let you in on a
02:31 - life hack an actual useful one in order
02:34 - to make things easier for us today we're
02:37 - going to use the X Y tool as we create
02:39 - our artwork p5.js has many built-in
02:42 - functions to help you draw if you want
02:45 - to find the exact coordinates of an
02:47 - object or an area you want to place an
02:49 - object then you can use the XY tool p5js
02:53 - uses Mouse X and mouse y to track the
02:56 - horizontal and vertical position of the
02:59 - mouse when it hovers over the canvas you
03:02 - can use the console to see the values
03:04 - from your mouse X and Y coordinates
03:07 - we didn't cover that did we
03:09 - let's rewind for a second
03:13 - the console is the area right below our
03:16 - text editor it allows us to input
03:18 - commands as well as show values from our
03:21 - text editor so now let's add console log
03:25 - X Plus Mouse X
03:28 - plus y plus Mouse y to the bottom of our
03:32 - draw function now our canvas will update
03:36 - and we can hover over the canvas with
03:38 - our Mouse you should be able to see
03:40 - different X and Y coordinates in the
03:42 - console now that we've learned how to
03:44 - find X Y coordinates faster let's put it
03:48 - to the test I'm going to use it as we
03:50 - create the top of our fingers for the
03:52 - fist on the left side I'll choose a
03:54 - shape that best represents a fist which
03:56 - would be a rectangle but if I use a
03:58 - rectangle function then I won't be able
04:01 - to change each point around the
04:03 - rectangle thankfully p5.js has a
04:06 - function that allows us to connect the
04:07 - Four Points of a square or rectangle
04:10 - independently the quad function allows
04:13 - us to set each point in a quad to create
04:15 - many different shapes quad means four in
04:19 - Latin and it is considered a freestyle
04:22 - four-sided shape it's similar to how the
04:25 - triangle function works you choose your
04:27 - starting position in X1 and y1 then you
04:31 - can move in either a clockwise or
04:33 - counterclockwise position setting the
04:36 - rest of your points X2 Y2
04:39 - X3 Y3
04:42 - X4 y4 let's add the first finger using a
04:46 - quad below background I'm going to label
04:49 - left fist
04:54 - now let's start adding our coordinates
04:57 - to quad the simplest way is to hover to
05:00 - a place on the canvas where you want
05:02 - each point to go then type it into your
05:05 - shape now rinse and repeat I want the
05:08 - first point to be at 45 100 then the
05:12 - next a 60 100 the third point at 65 131
05:19 - and the last point at 50 134 okay that
05:24 - was a lot like a lot a lot as a reminder
05:27 - you can always take a snack break or a
05:31 - power nap or simply sit still deep
05:34 - breath in
05:34 - [Music]
05:36 - deep breath out
05:39 - I was definitely meditating and not
05:41 - sleeping okay shall we continue I can
05:44 - copy and paste the second finger below
05:46 - the first then find my coordinates after
05:49 - you have found the coordinates for the
05:51 - second finger repeat the process for the
05:54 - third and the fourth
05:56 - foreign
06:00 - [Music]
06:01 - look at you you did that
06:05 - oops I forgot these speaking of which we
06:08 - have the top four fingers but we still
06:10 - need to add a thumb to that hand don't
06:13 - we and we also need to add the Palm
06:15 - below the fingers to complete the fist
06:17 - below left fist label thumb for the left
06:22 - fist thumb we are going to use a
06:24 - rectangle for symmetry
06:27 - okay I'm gonna break down the thumb into
06:29 - two parts the top of the thumb going
06:31 - across the fingers and the bottom part
06:33 - that connects to the palm the top part
06:36 - of the thumb should overlap parts of the
06:38 - finger to show that it is gripping an
06:40 - object which we'll put in later and the
06:43 - bottom part will connect at the end of
06:45 - the thumb and push down from there we
06:48 - can also use the X Y tool to find the
06:50 - coordinates now below the thumb let's
06:53 - make a label Palm the color scheme will
06:56 - be the same as above and to create the
06:59 - unique shape of the Palm we'll continue
07:01 - using quads now I'm going to break the
07:04 - Palm down into two parts the right side
07:06 - of the Palm that is connected to the
07:08 - thumb and the left side that connects to
07:10 - the rest of the hand I want the first
07:12 - point of the Quad to be a little
07:14 - off-center from the start of the thumb
07:16 - and also leave a gap so that we can add
07:20 - our mic later so I'm going to go below
07:22 - the thumb on the canvas and find the
07:25 - exact point x e equals 100
07:28 - and Y equals 170 looks like a good
07:31 - starting point 0.2 will be at the outer
07:34 - lower edge of the thumb then we'll
07:36 - create the angle from the thumb to the
07:38 - wrist
07:39 - the last point will also be slightly
07:42 - off-centered creating the angle of the
07:44 - thumb now we'll use the same process to
07:47 - create the left side of the Palm
07:52 - okay we've completed our first fist for
07:55 - the drawing next we will create the
07:57 - fifth in the middle of the canvas but
08:00 - before we do that I thought you might
08:02 - find this interesting have you ever
08:03 - wondered how the image of the raised
08:06 - fist we are drawing now turned into an
08:09 - iconic symbol for standing up against
08:11 - Injustice in America the raised fist has
08:14 - been used by many types of people from
08:16 - different parts of the world throughout
08:18 - history to represent Revolution
08:21 - solidarity and fighting the good fight
08:23 - in the 1960s the Black Panther Party
08:27 - adopted the raised fist as a
08:29 - representation of Black Liberation but
08:32 - everything changed when two black
08:34 - American athletes raised their fist on
08:37 - the Winner's podium in protest at the
08:39 - 1968 Olympics for the first time ever
08:43 - the raised fist became internationally
08:45 - synonymous with the struggles that
08:48 - people of color faced in America one of
08:51 - the athletes Tommy Smith said that he
08:54 - saw it as a human rights salute and
08:56 - today that sentiment still Rings true so
09:00 - I hope that's a reminder to you that one
09:02 - person well two in this case can change
09:05 - history now let's jump back into making
09:08 - our digital art so that you can start
09:10 - changing the world so we left off at
09:13 - drawing the middle fist now as you can
09:15 - see it's also a little bit bigger and
09:17 - slightly different than the first fist
09:19 - but you'll still use the same steps in
09:22 - logic to create another fist so let's
09:24 - first start creating the brown middle
09:26 - fist while we're at it I will also go
09:29 - ahead and start working on the fist on
09:31 - the right as well why don't we both work
09:34 - on it and link up here when we're done
09:37 - foreign
09:43 - [Music]
10:13 - foreign
10:24 - it's really coming along so far we have
10:27 - created three different colored fists on
10:30 - our canvas and now it's time for a pop
10:33 - quiz
10:37 - when setting your points for the quad
10:40 - function what directions can you move in
10:46 - yes that's right clockwise and
10:49 - counterclockwise I asked that question
10:51 - because we are about to learn how to
10:53 - make another Advanced shape an arc and
10:57 - the direction we move is really
10:59 - important an arc is part of a circle not
11:02 - the full circle just a piece so in a
11:05 - circle there are 360 Degrees zero starts
11:09 - in the middle of the right hand side and
11:12 - the degrees increase as you move
11:14 - clockwise around the circle
11:16 - so if we want to draw an arc like the
11:18 - ones in our picture that surround our
11:20 - fists you have to tell the canvas by
11:23 - using degrees to draw our arcs to do
11:26 - that we'll go to the setup function and
11:28 - type angle mode degrees
11:32 - four values act the same as an ellipse
11:34 - but the fifth and sixth values determine
11:37 - where the arc starts and stops let's
11:40 - take a look at an example of an arc if I
11:42 - wanted to draw a smile using an arc then
11:45 - I can start at zero and end at 180
11:48 - degrees
11:49 - and because I know you can't get enough
11:51 - of my pop quizzes
11:52 - [Music]
11:57 - I've got another question for you ready
11:59 - of course you are now suppose I was sad
12:03 - because my friends got Boba without me
12:05 - when I specifically asked them to get me
12:06 - some and I wanted to draw a frown then
12:10 - which degrees would I start and end at
12:17 - did you say 180 zero that's the right
12:21 - answer the last value in an arc
12:23 - determines how the arc is drawn you have
12:25 - three options to choose open cord and
12:30 - Pie open looks like a sliced orange with
12:33 - the Border going around the edge peel
12:35 - cord looks like a moon with the Border
12:38 - going around all sides and Pi looks just
12:41 - like it sounds
12:43 - now we're ready to add the arcs to our
12:45 - background I want the first Arc to be
12:48 - purple with a border thickness of eight
12:51 - it will be in the top left corner of the
12:53 - canvas and look like a half smile the
12:57 - width and height will be the same as
12:59 - 600. in our example we started at zero
13:02 - and moved to 180 to make a smile so for
13:06 - a half smile we will start at zero and
13:09 - stop at 90. now we'll add the second Arc
13:12 - to the bottom right hand corner the
13:15 - width and height of the second Arc will
13:18 - be the same as the first Arc and will
13:21 - start at 180 and stop at 270. okay time
13:25 - to color our second Arc we'll make the
13:27 - color a light purple now to do that we
13:30 - can click on the purple box color and
13:33 - change the Color Picker to a lighter
13:35 - color on the bottom Arc I don't want a
13:38 - border so we don't need to code that in
13:40 - now as you can see we're about halfway
13:43 - done
13:45 - in our next video I'll show you how to
13:47 - make a background so we can finish
13:49 - building our art piece but for now why
13:52 - don't we take a break to rest our brains
13:54 - scroll on Tick Tock and stretch our
13:56 - bodies
13:57 - and feed our tummies but before we do
14:00 - that we have to save your artwork go to
14:03 - file at the top of the page at the left
14:05 - hand side and select save awesome done
14:09 - and done okay that's all for now thanks
14:12 - for rocking with me today and until next
14:14 - time live your best life and as always
14:17 - stay cute and stay coding
14:26 - [Music]
