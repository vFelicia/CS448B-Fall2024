04:36 - great all right okay tell us about
04:38 - partnering with friends I feel like when
04:42 - you do have the opportunity to partner
04:44 - with a brand you have to see if that
04:47 - brand aligns with what you believe in
04:50 - um also knowing your worth too
04:52 - um you know with any industry or
04:55 - partnership like there's always going to
04:56 - be companies that try to you know try to
04:59 - figure out what they can pull from you
05:01 - you know and so you really have to know
05:03 - your worth and stand firm in what you

05:29 - beautiful if you could create a game
05:32 - what would it be describe it for us I
05:35 - would do a story based open world game I
05:39 - would let you customize your character I
05:41 - would give you more hairstyle options
05:43 - than just an afro and braids first
05:45 - things first I would give you proper
05:48 - skin tones
05:49 - um open world where you can go out and
05:51 - explore the lay of the land and kind of
05:53 - get lost in it I'm also really big on
05:55 - like Choice based games like um
05:57 - telltale's like The Walking Dead and
05:59 - things like that where it's like you
06:00 - play the game and what you do in the
06:03 - game affects the rest of it like your
06:04 - choices matter so I also feel like
06:06 - that's really important and that's all I
06:09 - got so far I
06:15 - [Laughter]
06:20 - oh this one yes okay that's the one easy
06:23 - one that's the one yes okay
06:29 - childhood memories by the way did you
06:31 - always want to be a gamer if not what
06:34 - inspired you to change careers I always
06:36 - loved video games but I didn't know that
06:39 - it could be a full-blown career once I
06:41 - graduated I knew I didn't want to be at
06:43 - my restaurant job anymore I couldn't
06:45 - really find a teaching job and I wasn't
06:48 - really excited about subbing either and
06:50 - so I had the conversation with my

07:06 - pandemic hit during that time so like I
07:09 - went full time streaming in February of
07:11 - 2020 that's also when I quit my
07:14 - restaurant job during that first year

08:51 - with who I was too and you know
08:53 - sometimes the coolest thing is just like
08:54 - being yourself and like owning the skin

08:58 - and it also makes life a lot easier too
09:00 - I feel like I'm always like my biggest
09:02 - critic and I put the most unnecessary
09:05 - pressure on myself and it doesn't need
09:07 - to be like that just own who you are and
