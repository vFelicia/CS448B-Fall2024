00:00 - what's up my brilliant coders it's your
00:02 - girl Jillian and I'm your host for code
00:05 - along welcome back here's where we left
00:07 - off we drew three fists using quads and
00:10 - rectangles and we also created two
00:12 - different colored arcs to give some
00:14 - Dimension to our piece and now we're
00:16 - gonna finish together what we started
00:17 - all right then let's get into it
00:20 - [Music]
00:27 - so before we jump back into drawing I
00:30 - just wanted to let you know that if you
00:31 - ever get stuck or forget how to draw a
00:33 - shape we have a super handy cheat sheet
00:35 - that you might find helpful and as
00:37 - always feel free to pause whenever you
00:39 - need time to complete a task sound good
00:42 - alright let's start our session by
00:44 - adding four arms to the fists we've
00:46 - already drawn we'll start from left to
00:48 - right and add them using quads below
00:51 - Palm on each fist label forearm and
00:54 - using the quick and convenient X Y tool
00:56 - we can find all the points to the quad
00:59 - very quickly for all three forearms why
01:02 - don't we take a moment to draw and color
01:03 - all of the forearms now
01:07 - foreign
01:09 - is looking really really great we'll now
01:13 - focus on adding our art tools the
01:15 - microphone phone paintbrush and pencil
01:18 - once again let's move from left to right
01:20 - starting with the microphone above left
01:23 - fist label mic we can use a rectangle as
01:26 - the base of the mic from the sample
01:28 - drawing there is a small gap between the
01:30 - edge of the canvas and the mic so X will
01:33 - be 10 and Y is 120 because it will be
01:35 - centered in the middle of the Fist now I
01:38 - want the mic to expand 190 and have a
01:41 - height of 40 as well as round the
01:43 - corners at six
01:44 - then we'll want to add the gray band
01:46 - around the top of the mic that connects
01:48 - to the grill or windscreen we'll also
01:51 - use a rectangle for this part and now
01:53 - the last step is to add a black round
01:55 - Grill to the top of the mic base
01:58 - to do this we'll use a circle function
02:00 - it just takes in three values the X and
02:03 - Y coordinates and the size of the
02:05 - diameter meaning how big you want the
02:07 - circle to be y'all that microphone looks
02:10 - good enough for me to sing on
02:13 - a minute I'm gonna need a cinnamonome
02:15 - and a woman to pump okay now it's time
02:18 - to add the phone to our middle fist I
02:20 - know it might seem a little ironic for
02:22 - us to include a phone in this art piece
02:24 - on activism because people are usually
02:26 - on their phones for entertainment I mean
02:28 - it doesn't love a cat video
02:32 - but really though the phone is one of
02:34 - the most transformative tools when it
02:36 - comes to social justice and that's
02:38 - because phones are ultimately
02:39 - communication tools and sharing
02:41 - information is one of the most effective
02:43 - ways to stand up for what you believe in
02:45 - above the label middle fist label phone
02:48 - I want the phone to be black with a gray
02:51 - border of six we can accomplish this
02:53 - with a rectangle but you knew that
02:55 - you're basically the Beyonce of coding
02:57 - at this point so we now have a
02:59 - microphone and cell phone and the last
03:01 - two tools we need to create are our
03:04 - paintbrush and pencil above the right
03:06 - fist label pencil let's make this an
03:09 - orange pencil with no border and give it
03:11 - a width of 190 and a height of 15. now
03:14 - let's sharpen the pencil by adding a
03:16 - beige triangle with no border but we
03:18 - can't have it be a random triangle so
03:20 - we'll connect the base of the triangle
03:22 - to the top of the pencil finally the
03:25 - last tool we need to add is our
03:27 - paintbrush I broke the paintbrush down
03:29 - into three parts the handle the Fastener
03:32 - and the bristles the handle and Fastener
03:35 - will follow almost the same steps as
03:37 - when we created the microphone using a
03:39 - rectangle as the base except the height
03:41 - of the handle will be the same as the
03:43 - pencil 15 and the corners will be
03:46 - rounded at six okay now on to the
03:49 - paintbrush which I'm actually the most
03:51 - excited to draw I'm sort of in my cool
03:53 - art girl era if you couldn't tell the
03:55 - pay paintbrush is created using two
03:58 - parts we will use an ellipse to draw an
04:00 - oval which will serve as the body of the
04:02 - brush the width of the oval will be 60
04:05 - and a height at 20. that's a throwback
04:07 - all the way to video one and we'll make
04:09 - the tip of the brush using an arc The
04:12 - Arc will be the same color as the oval
04:13 - and have no border we'll start the arc
04:16 - at 180 and end at zero
04:19 - yes and you did it we finished drawing
04:21 - all our art tools
04:24 - oh wait we have just one more thing to
04:27 - do adding Stripes to the background we
04:30 - can use a line function to accomplish
04:32 - this task but if I added line by line it
04:34 - would take a long time and I don't know
04:36 - about you but I got places to be if only
04:39 - there were a better way to do that I'll
04:42 - let you in on a little secret
04:44 - we can use something called the for Loop
04:47 - function the for Loop function basically
04:49 - takes in three values and it runs the
04:52 - block of code inside of it until the
04:54 - conditions are false
04:55 - a bit like a hula hoop that just keeps
04:57 - going around and around and around until
05:00 - we stop so this is what the for Loop
05:03 - looks like in p5.js
05:05 - the first value is where you want your
05:06 - for Loop to start the value is stored in
05:09 - a variable they're called variables
05:11 - because they represent information that
05:13 - can change our variable is called I and
05:16 - it is storing the value of zero now
05:19 - let's change the length to 600
05:21 - representing the length of the canvas
05:23 - and console log the values of I
05:26 - so now that I've changed the length to
05:28 - 600 I wonder what values I'll see
05:31 - so I'm just going to scroll down and it
05:33 - looks like you can see the change in
05:34 - values start at 0 to 5.99
05:37 - that's a little sus this one's another
05:40 - thinker I wonder why the values stop at
05:43 - 5.99 maybe it's because the second value
05:46 - is the condition you want to check each
05:48 - time we go around the for loop as the
05:50 - variable increases the second condition
05:52 - checks whether I is less than 600. if
05:56 - that is true then I want to run the
05:58 - block of code inside the function if the
06:01 - condition goes from True to false then
06:03 - we stop I is increasing and the
06:05 - condition is true until we reach 600. at
06:08 - 600 the condition is false because 600
06:11 - is not less than 600 it's equal so the
06:14 - last True Value will be 5.99 remember
06:17 - how in Cinderella the Fairy Godmother
06:19 - tells Cinderella that midnight her
06:22 - carriage will turn into a pumpkin her
06:24 - dress back into her old clothes and her
06:26 - horses back into mice that means that
06:28 - Cinderella will only have until 11 59 to
06:31 - be bougie Cinderella 1159 is like the
06:35 - last True Value in the loop and at
06:37 - midnight the condition becomes false and
06:39 - Cinderella has to go back to her old
06:41 - life sad but it does have a happy ending
06:44 - don't worry oh shoot I said no spoilers
06:47 - in the last video right actually I think
06:48 - I get a pass on this one I mean it is a
06:51 - tail As Old As Time
06:53 - the third value in the for Loop is how
06:56 - much we want our variable to increase by
06:58 - I plus plus means we want to increase by
07:01 - one every time the condition is true
07:04 - we were able to see our variable
07:06 - increase by one in the console now let's
07:09 - add our line pattern to the background I
07:12 - want to start at 0 and expand the width
07:14 - of the canvas but I want to increase the
07:16 - space between the lines to 20 instead of
07:18 - one I'll now add a pink line with
07:21 - thickness of 10 inside the for Loop
07:25 - foreign
07:32 - okay now remember the line function
07:33 - takes in four values
07:35 - the first two values are where you want
07:37 - the line to start and the last two
07:39 - values are where the line will end
07:42 - I want to start in the upper left corner
07:44 - of the canvas I want the y coordinate
07:46 - for the first point and the x coordinate
07:48 - of the second point to increase every
07:50 - turn of the for Loop I can replace those
07:53 - with I creating a sloped design
07:59 - foreign
08:08 - wow we have come such a long way and I'm
08:12 - so proud of you for taking it step by
08:14 - step and using the concepts we learned
08:16 - to make this amazing digital art now I
08:18 - hope you take your new skills and art
08:20 - and make something with the message that
08:21 - you care about and hey maybe you'll even
08:24 - share it with the world until next time
08:26 - stay cute and stay coding foreign
