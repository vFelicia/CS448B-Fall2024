04:09 - technical sides of my brain when you
04:11 - think of marketing you probably think of
04:12 - things like what's on TV and what's on
04:14 - social media and that's definitely true
04:16 - but there's also a really great side to
04:18 - what I do that has required me to be
04:19 - technical I not only have to understand
04:21 - the products that I'm marketing but I
