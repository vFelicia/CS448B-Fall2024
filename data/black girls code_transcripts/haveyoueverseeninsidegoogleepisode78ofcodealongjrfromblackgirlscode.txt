00:49 - [Applause]
00:56 - go let's
00:58 - go so how did you end up at Google funny
01:02 - story I applied to Google when I first
01:04 - graduated from college but I actually
01:06 - did not get accepted um so it was kind
01:09 - of sad but you know what it taught me a
01:12 - lesson just to keep going and keep
01:14 - trying and maybe there's a place you
01:16 - have to start um a little bit smaller so
01:18 - I kept applying to some smaller
01:20 - advertising uh companies and got my
01:22 - start there in digital advertising and I
01:25 - always kept thinking about what about
01:27 - Google what can I do so I kept applying
01:30 - and finally one day I actually got an
01:33 - email from a Google recruiter reaching
01:35 - out to me and I finally got my
01:37 - acceptance at Google that's great you
01:39 - know I think it really taught me just to
01:41 - never give up but to you know work on
01:45 - what can you bring to a company right
01:48 - that's awesome yeah so it was really
01:49 - cool to get here yeah that's fantastic
01:52 - so what do you like most about working
01:54 - in Tech I really like all of the smart
01:58 - and cool people and new inventions we
02:01 - can really build cool things for
02:03 - everyone so I think Tech allows us to
02:06 - connect the pieces and honestly interact
02:08 - with more people I'm from Nigeria
02:10 - originally and a lot of my family is
02:12 - still there so I can use social media to
02:14 - connect with them or we can use Google
02:17 - search to find things to like that we
02:20 - like to do together yeah that's great so
02:22 - what's your job yeah I'm actually a
02:24 - global product Solutions lead which is a
02:27 - handful but what it really means is I
02:29 - sit between our Market which would be
02:31 - our advertisers and our sales teams and
02:33 - between the engineer teams so if our
02:36 - advertisers have some feedback or
02:39 - product suggestions I can take all of
02:41 - that in and then share it back with our
02:43 - engineers and our product teams to see
02:45 - if we could build those features for
02:47 - them so are you a coder like
02:49 - me you know I actually am not but I do
02:52 - work with a bunch of coders and engineer
02:55 - teams our engineer teams and en coders
02:58 - will build features and scripts to help
03:03 - our search campaign serve better and so
03:06 - if they build new features and want to
03:08 - know if it's actually going to work or
03:10 - be useful to our customers I'll then
03:13 - take some of those ideas that they have
03:15 - to our customers and get their feedback
03:17 - to see like if it's helpful and if they
03:20 - really like it or if it's not helpful
03:22 - how can we improve it so that it would
03:24 - be helpful for you so what kind of
03:25 - skills do you need for your job my job
03:28 - is actually more about relationship
03:30 - building building relationships with my
03:33 - Engineers with my product managers and
03:36 - my advertisers um and these
03:38 - relationships are really key to make
03:40 - sure we're hearing from everyone we want
03:43 - to hear from our advertisers about what
03:45 - they like about our products and we also
03:47 - want to hear from our Eng teams and
03:49 - really figure out what are they trying
03:50 - to build so when I hear from both
03:52 - parties I bring these conversations
03:54 - together yeah it's not as technical as
03:56 - you would think but it's really
03:58 - important to have good relationship
04:00 - management and building skills so you
04:03 - can you know work and collaborate
04:05 - efficiently thank you so much for
04:07 - telling me about your job it was my
04:09 - pleasure so I actually have a really fun
