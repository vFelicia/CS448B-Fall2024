00:00 - what's up future programmers I'm kaani
00:03 - and I'm your host for COD along scratch
00:06 - is a platform made for kids that allows
00:08 - you to build games animations and
00:10 - interactive stories without needing to
00:12 - write complex code woo but today it's
00:16 - all about
00:17 - AI we're going to make our very own chat
00:20 - bot using scratch and when we're
00:22 - finished you have a cool new buddy to
00:24 - talk to are you ready get
00:28 - started let's
00:31 - [Music]
00:37 - go go to
00:39 - scratch.mit.edu
00:43 - if you don't have one already create an
00:45 - account so that we can save and share
00:48 - our
00:49 - projects now I'm going to create a new
00:51 - project you can do this by clicking on
00:54 - file then new before we start let's use
00:57 - our imagination imagine your chatbot is
01:01 - a character is it a funny robot a wise
01:05 - robot or a weird alien from outer space
01:09 - giving our robot a character or
01:11 - personality will help make our chatot
01:13 - experience even more fun are you ready
01:16 - to make a super cool AI robot as I build
01:19 - my robot you can build an identical one
01:22 - or let your imagination run wild and
01:25 - build your own if you need a refresher
01:27 - on how to navigate scratch go check my
01:30 - intro to scratch video to learn all
01:32 - about how to use the basic scratch
01:34 - blocks all right time to get coding
01:38 - first off look at that scratch cat on
01:41 - your screen that's your Sprite or your
01:43 - little robot buddy if you're thinking of
01:45 - getting a different robot friend just
01:47 - click on this cat or Sprite icon in the
01:50 - bottom right corner and select a new
01:52 - Sprite I'm going to
01:54 - [Music]
01:56 - choose this robot I'm going to delete
01:59 - delete the cap for now and leave the
02:01 - robot once you've got your Sprite it's
02:04 - time to give it a stage to stand on
02:07 - click on the mountain icon to pick any
02:09 - backdrop you like I'm going to choose
02:13 - this awesome spaceship now for the fun
02:16 - part make sure to click on your Sprite
02:18 - so that it's glowing blue to create my
02:21 - robot I need to create its brain to
02:23 - store and answer questions then I need
02:26 - to teach the robot what questions to
02:28 - check for and finally I need to teach it
02:31 - how to
02:32 - respond to start I'll head over to the
02:35 - events category and pull in the when
02:37 - green flag click block to keep our chat
02:40 - going use a forever loop from the
02:43 - control
02:44 - category inside that Loop let's place an
02:48 - Ask block from the sensing section and
02:51 - type in say something or ask me a
02:54 - question our robot has to remember stuff
02:57 - right so let's create its break bra is
03:00 - anyone else starting to feel like a mad
03:05 - scientist head to the variable section
03:08 - and click make a variable create one
03:11 - named found and another called prompt
03:17 - location these variables will let me
03:19 - know if I found the answer and the
03:21 - location of the answer to the
03:24 - question next create two more variables
03:27 - called prompts for questions and resp
03:29 - responses for the robot's
03:34 - answers before we get into the heavy
03:36 - coding let's set some things up I want
03:39 - the robot to ask say something or ask me
03:41 - a question to
03:43 - start if the robot does not find the
03:45 - answer to the question then I'm going to
03:48 - set the found variable to
03:54 - false then change the prompt location
03:57 - variable to one because we're going to
03:59 - add a new
04:02 - question now let's go on a little robot
04:05 - search mission take a repeat loop from
04:08 - the control
04:10 - Tab and set it to go through the length
04:13 - of the prompts
04:17 - list control blocks tell the other
04:19 - blocks what to do and when to make a
04:21 - choice inside this Loop you can use an
04:24 - if else block combined with the contains
04:27 - option from the operator tab to check if
04:31 - our robot already knows the
04:33 - [Music]
04:35 - answer operator blocks are like many
04:38 - puzzle solvers on your project they help
04:40 - Sprites figure things out make choices
04:43 - and create
04:45 - surprises but what if our robot only
04:47 - kind of knows the answer but not exactly
04:50 - it's teaching time inside the loop you
04:53 - can use the if not and contains block to
04:57 - make it
04:58 - check
04:59 - [Music]
05:12 - [Music]
05:18 - if our robot doesn't know the exact
05:20 - wording of the question use the add to
05:22 - blocks to teach
05:28 - it
05:37 - [Music]
05:54 - when our robot does know the answer
05:56 - let's have it shouted out loud to to do
05:59 - this we'll use the say block from
06:03 - [Music]
06:08 - looks next we'll change the found
06:11 - variable to
06:12 - [Music]
06:14 - true then I want to search each item in
06:18 - the prompt list and return the response
06:21 - that matches my
06:25 - [Music]
06:28 - question
06:31 - [Music]
06:38 - all right let's tell the robot to grab
06:40 - the answer and say it out loud just in
06:43 - case our robot doesn't recognize the
06:45 - question let's teach it to move on to
06:47 - the next item use the change by one
06:50 - block for
06:51 - this the change by one block will add a
06:54 - new space for the question you want the
06:56 - robot to learn what if our robot
06:58 - finishes its list and still looks
07:00 - confused well we need to teach it
07:04 - [Music]
07:16 - [Music]
07:24 - more let's ask our user sorry I don't
07:28 - know that what should I say next
07:31 - [Music]
07:38 - time then we'll save that answer so our
07:41 - robot knows what to say in the future
07:44 - let's review to be sure you understand
07:46 - what each chunk of code is doing in this
07:49 - section we had the robot ask us for a
07:51 - prompt then wait for our response in the
07:54 - next section we had the robot search our
07:56 - list of prompts to see if what we asked
07:58 - was already already in its list of
08:00 - prompts and if it was then the robot
08:03 - will give us a response or answer in the
08:06 - last section we had the robot do add new
08:08 - prompts to its list that it did not know
08:11 - then asked us what the answer or
08:13 - response should be to the new
08:15 - prompt wo that was a lot of code for our
08:19 - robot now that we truly understand our
08:21 - code Let's test this out I want to clean
08:24 - up the screen a little bit by hiding the
08:27 - prompt and responses variables by right
08:30 - clicking on them then selecting
08:33 - [Music]
08:40 - hide everybody come on that looks so
08:45 - much
08:46 - [Music]
08:56 - better everybody come on
09:02 - [Music]
09:12 - everybody mbody come
09:16 - [Music]
09:28 - onbody
09:29 - and there you go you've just built a
09:31 - smart AI robot the coolest part the more
09:34 - you chat with it the smarter it becomes
09:37 - if you want a closer look at my code be
09:40 - sure to click the project link below
09:42 - let's make sure to save all of our hard
09:46 - work give your project the
09:48 - title then click save now in the top
09:51 - right hand corner or go to file and
09:54 - select save
09:56 - now if you want to share your robot with
09:59 - friends for them to test it out then
10:01 - click the share button have fun chatting
10:04 - with your new robot buddy and keep
10:07 - [Music]
10:11 - coding
