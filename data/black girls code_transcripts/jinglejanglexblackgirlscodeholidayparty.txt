01:35 - part of the film
01:37 - i really love to watch the tunnel scene
01:40 - when they're going through the tunnel
01:41 - saving buddy and it's like a roller
01:43 - coaster ride
01:44 - because it's so intense you're just like
01:46 - you know everything comes so close to
01:48 - when they're about to hit something
01:49 - you're like
01:51 - so i kind of like that i really like

01:58 - famous holiday drink is called milk
02:01 - punch
02:02 - oh camille your hand went right up okay
02:05 - i believe it's eggnog fantastic nailed
02:08 - it
02:08 - i wouldn't have known that like milk
02:10 - punch grubs
02:12 - was there any um humorous behind the
02:14 - scenes
02:15 - that any of the cast had there was a
02:17 - moment where we had to do a very serious
02:19 - scene but i just couldn't stop laughing
02:22 - um when don juan gets stolen by mouse
02:25 - we have to run up being really really
02:27 - sad but i just went out and started
02:30 - laughing
02:30 - thank god i could hide my face into her
02:32 - coat so i was like
02:35 - i know it really looked like she was
02:36 - just crying her eyes out but she was
02:38 - high
02:41 - it was something sad i was supposed to
02:42 - be crying you didn't say which way
02:46 - that's right that was perfect i love
02:48 - hearing the bloopers because now when i
02:50 - re-watch the film that's all i'm gonna
02:51 - see
02:54 - were you ever nervous or like
02:57 - at a scene or in a park yeah that there
03:00 - was some parts i was nervous but i
03:02 - didn't take nerves as a bad thing i take
03:04 - it as something to drive me through the
03:06 - scene
03:07 - so i take it as it means that i actually
03:10 - care about it so then
03:11 - if i'm nervous i just use that to
03:14 - embrace the character more
03:15 - that's some really good advice i wish
03:17 - you were there to help me talk me
03:18 - through my moments of nervousness where
03:20 - i'm just like
03:21 - profusely sweating like i am right now
03:26 - misty glow on my face
03:29 - so next question this is probably my
03:31 - favorite
03:33 - all i want for christmas is you is the
03:35 - biggest selling holiday song
03:37 - of all time by a female artist can you
03:40 - name that singer
03:41 - camilla i saw you girl i see you go for
03:43 - it um by mariah carey yes can you sing
03:46 - it for us for a bonus point
03:48 - um okay i won't do that to you that's
03:51 - mariah too much range
03:55 - so i rewatched it multiple times and
03:57 - kind of on each run
03:59 - i noticed something new about it so on
04:01 - the second run
04:02 - i started noticing kind of like the
04:04 - instrumentals and
04:05 - the music that was being played do you
04:07 - have any like
04:09 - insight on explaining some of the
04:12 - instrumental or music choices
04:14 - so we had an amazing composer named john
04:16 - debney who did the score for the film
04:19 - you know music is very important in a
04:21 - film because it takes you in
04:23 - all different directions and you don't
04:24 - even realize it if you
04:27 - watch dialogue in a film or you're
04:30 - watching you know two actors engage
04:33 - you may be sitting there you're feeling
04:35 - one way
04:36 - when you're watching it and you're like
04:37 - okay and then as soon as they lay a bed
04:40 - of music on it
04:41 - it takes you somewhere else completely
04:44 - music will always help with that just
04:46 - like when you're watching
04:48 - and you hear you see that snowball scene
04:51 - and you hear
04:52 - the music that boom boom boom you like
04:54 - oh
04:55 - okay we bout to have some fun right now
04:57 - you know
04:58 - but then when you hear the music when
05:01 - they are just now bringing buddy after
05:04 - they've taken him from gustafson's to
05:06 - put him back together
05:08 - it's like oh you know it's
05:09 - heart-wrenching
05:11 - all right well we're gonna wrap it up
