00:00 - hi I'm kaani and I'm your host for codal
00:03 - along welcome to the exciting world of
00:06 - game development with scratch if you've
00:08 - ever dreamed of creating your own video
00:10 - game but didn't know where to start
00:12 - you're in the right place today we're
00:13 - going to take the very first steps
00:15 - towards creating your very own video
00:18 - game whether you want to design a
00:19 - thrilling space adventure or a puzzle
00:22 - that challenges the mind scratch
00:24 - provides all the tools you need ready
00:27 - let's
00:28 - go
00:35 - let's go to the scratch website go to
00:39 - scratch.mit.edu
00:41 - make sure to log into your account if
00:44 - you didn't create an account with me in
00:46 - our first video let's do that now go to
00:49 - the top right corner of the page and
00:51 - click join scratch and follow the
00:54 - prompts to activate your account in our
00:56 - last episode we learned all about the
00:58 - basics of creating in scratch if you
01:00 - need a little refresher feel free to go
01:02 - back and watch that episode today I'm
01:05 - going to create a Chase game when I
01:08 - think of a Chase game I know I need a
01:10 - few major elements a character or Sprite
01:13 - that chases the thing that's getting
01:15 - chased a cool backdrop and a sound oh
01:18 - and we need an area to keep score it is
01:20 - a game after all before I get started I
01:23 - want to think about what kind of Chase
01:25 - game I want to create H first thing that
01:28 - comes to mind is a catch version of the
01:30 - chase game that makes me think of my dog
01:32 - and how she's always begging me to play
01:34 - fetch that's it I'm going to build a
01:36 - game where a dog chases the ball and
01:38 - whenever she catches it she gets a point
01:40 - what kind of Chase game do you want to
01:42 - create it can be anything the
01:44 - possibilities are endless okay so now I
01:48 - planned out my game and have a basic
01:50 - idea of what I want it to be about it's
01:52 - time to get started the first thing I
01:55 - need to do is choose my Sprite I'll
01:57 - delete the current Sprite by clicking
01:59 - the X above it in the Sprite area then I
02:02 - click the Sprite
02:03 - icon choose animals and select the puppy
02:08 - oh my goodness this puppy looks so cute
02:11 - I'll name her pepper this is going to be
02:15 - great my dog's favorite thing to play
02:18 - catch with in real life is a ball so
02:20 - let's give this dog a ball
02:22 - [Music]
02:24 - too I'm going to select this ball and
02:27 - then change the size of the puppy and
02:29 - and the ball to
02:35 - 60 oh I just got the best idea my dog
02:39 - and I play cats everywhere in the house
02:42 - in the backyard and at the park so I'm
02:45 - going to add different levels to our
02:46 - game to show all the places where we
02:48 - play to do this I'll click the backdrop
02:51 - icon next to the Sprite icon I'm going
02:54 - to choose four different backdrops to
02:56 - represent four different levels each
02:58 - backdrop will be add added to the
03:00 - backdrop tab where you can change the
03:02 - order you want them to show remember you
03:05 - can choose whatever Sprites and
03:06 - backdrops you like for your
03:09 - [Music]
03:23 - game I want the puppy to move left to
03:26 - right trying to catch the ball so I'm
03:28 - going to add action to the left and
03:30 - right arrow keys select the puppy in the
03:32 - Sprite area then from the events tab
03:35 - drag and drop the when green fly click
03:38 - block to the scripts
03:40 - area next I'll go to the control Tab and
03:43 - add the if block the if block is a
03:47 - conditional statement meaning if this
03:49 - statement is true then run the code
03:51 - inside well if I press the right arrow
03:54 - then I want the puppy to move to the
03:56 - right in the sensing tab I'll add the
03:59 - keys space pressed to the if block
04:02 - change space bar to right
04:05 - arrow then I'll add the change X by10
04:08 - from the motion tab inside the if
04:12 - block now press the green flag then
04:15 - click right
04:17 - arrow did the puppy move to the right no
04:20 - I know why it's because I forgot to add
04:23 - one more block I need to add a forever
04:26 - block from the control tab to surround
04:27 - the if statement without the forever
04:30 - block the program would only check the
04:32 - condition once and would likely miss
04:34 - most of the times the right arrow key is
04:36 - pressed adding a forever block around an
04:39 - if statement will make sure that our
04:40 - code runs
04:42 - continuously now I'll press the green
04:44 - flag again and then press the right
04:46 - arrow it worked great the puppy is
04:49 - moving to the
04:50 - right now I'll copy or duplicate the
04:54 - current block and change right arrow to
04:56 - left arrow and add a negative sign to 10
05:00 - do you remember what happens when you
05:02 - add a negative sign before a number
05:04 - that's right the Sprite will move in the
05:06 - opposite direction now that the puppy
05:08 - can move left and right let's code the
05:11 - ball I want the ball to come from the
05:13 - top of the stage down towards the puppy
05:16 - the stage is measured along the X and Y
05:19 - AIS if you drag the ball from the top of
05:21 - the stage to the bottom you can see his
05:23 - y-coordinates change from 170 to 0 to
05:28 - 170 I'm going to add my starter blocks
05:31 - when green flag click block and the
05:33 - forever block and the if block as my
05:36 - instructions for the
05:38 - ball when the green flag is clicked I
05:40 - want the ball to change wide
05:43 - [Music]
05:46 - by5 this will move the ball down the
05:48 - screen towards the puppy but what if the
05:50 - puppy can't catch the ball then I need
05:53 - to reset the ball to the top of the
05:55 - stage I need two blocks to add to the if
05:58 - statement I'll go to the operator's Tab
06:01 - and add the less than block then go to
06:04 - the Motions Tab and add the Y
06:09 - position the Y position keeps track of
06:12 - the current y position of the Sprite if
06:14 - the Y position of the ball is less than
06:17 - - 170 which is the bottom of the stage
06:20 - then I want to go to random
06:23 - [Music]
06:25 - position and set y to 180 which is the a
06:29 - area above our stage now click the green
06:33 - flag the ball should be moving towards
06:35 - the dog and resetting itself to a new
06:38 - position at the top of the stage once it
06:40 - reaches the bottom okay now I know what
06:43 - happens when the puppy doesn't catch the
06:45 - ball but what should happen when it does
06:47 - when my dog catches the ball in real
06:49 - life she gets a treat so when the
06:52 - virtual puppy catches the virtual ball
06:54 - let's give it a virtual treat AKA a
06:57 - point I want to add a block of code that
07:00 - says when the puppy touches the ball the
07:02 - puppy gets a point then it should play a
07:04 - sound to celebrate then I'll reset the
07:06 - ball to the top of the screen to do that
07:09 - first We'll add our starter
07:12 - [Music]
07:17 - block then I'll go to the sensing Tab
07:19 - and add the touching Mouse pointer block
07:21 - to the if
07:26 - statement I'm going to change the mouse
07:28 - pointer to Pepper for the puppy
07:31 - excellent now when the ball touches the
07:33 - puppy something will happen but what I
07:37 - know let's keep score of how many balls
07:40 - the puppy catches in order to keep
07:42 - scoring scratch we have to go to the
07:44 - variables Tab and click make a
07:48 - variable variables can be used to keep
07:50 - track of scores in a game store user
07:53 - inputs control different aspects of
07:55 - animation and so much
07:58 - more let's make a variable called score
08:02 - you'll see a score tracker on the top
08:04 - left of the stage now drag the change my
08:07 - variable by one block inside the if
08:11 - statement then select score from the
08:13 - drop- down menu and change variable by
08:17 - one now I'll click the green flag and
08:19 - try to catch a ball to test it
08:23 - out hm it looks like some balls get
08:26 - stuck on the screen after touching the
08:28 - puppy I have to reset the balls after
08:30 - each one is counted but first I want to
08:32 - add a sound after each ball is caught to
08:35 - do this I'll go to the Sound area and
08:38 - drag the start sound block below the
08:40 - change score
08:42 - block click the sound tab then click the
08:45 - sound icon at the bottom of the page and
08:47 - select
08:49 - pop now try catching it again press the
08:53 - green flag then move the puppy left to
08:55 - right to catch the
08:57 - ball do you see see your score going up
09:00 - does each ball reset do you hear the pop
09:03 - great we're making so much progress in
09:06 - our game the last thing I want to do is
09:08 - move the puppy to the next level in our
09:10 - game every time she catches 10 balls to
09:13 - do this I'll need to duplicate the last
09:15 - scripts block I'm going to replace the
09:18 - touching block with an equals operator
09:20 - block then dragging my scores variable
09:23 - and set it equal to 10 now replace chain
09:27 - score to set score to zero
09:29 - [Music]
09:34 - I want to reset the score after each
09:35 - level then change to the next bath drop
09:39 - Let's test out our Chase game we want to
09:41 - make sure all of our blocks of code work
09:44 - together I have to double check to make
09:46 - sure that whenever the puppy catches the
09:48 - ball he gets a point and then if he gets
09:51 - 10 points he goes to the next level
09:53 - let's press the green flag and give it a
09:58 - try
10:02 - yay it worked yes okay now I want to
10:05 - save my work so I don't lose my awesome
10:07 - Chase game make sure you save your work
10:10 - too first we have to give our project
10:12 - the
10:13 - title then click save now in the top
10:16 - right corner or you can go to file and
10:18 - select save
10:20 - now I can't wait to see all the fun
10:23 - chase games you've made in scratch but
10:25 - now I think I'm going to spend some time
10:27 - playing catch with my dog in real life
10:31 - hi Cloud you want to play
10:33 - catch see you next time
