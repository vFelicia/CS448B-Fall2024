00:00 - women were becoming more educated women
00:02 - were becoming more present as
00:04 - technologists and consumers of the
00:06 - technology but we were still
00:08 - experiencing things that my mother's
00:11 - mother made experience and that was
00:14 - something that bothered me greatly I get
00:18 - a lot of joy from just encouraging girls
00:20 - to not be afraid to say I'm good at
00:23 - something especially if it's something
00:25 - that were not normally supposed to be
00:27 - good at where I grew up in the inner
00:29 - city of Memphis Tennessee at a time that
00:32 - you know there weren't many women going
00:34 - into the fields of engineering
00:35 - especially for a young woman of color so
00:38 - I think for me it was a bit of a
00:41 - surprise perhaps to my family that I
00:43 - would choose this particular career
00:45 - field
00:48 - I definitely experienced bias throughout
00:51 - my college career I was just determined
00:54 - that I would make it through there no
00:56 - matter what even though the first few
00:58 - years of college were extremely
01:00 - difficult there weren't too many folks
01:02 - in my room that looked like me I didn't
01:04 - even have any female professors for a
01:06 - whole four years I think one of the
01:09 - things that has always helped me was
01:12 - finding my community finding this bond
01:15 - other sisters in the field that could
01:18 - share a bit of their experiences of me
01:21 - that could give me advice I had to
01:24 - actually go into this very male centric
01:27 - manufacturing environment where I had to
01:30 - lead a team of men that could be my
01:33 - grandfather literally as a 20 year old
01:36 - student coming out of college and I had
01:38 - to figure out how to do that and show
01:41 - that I was knowledgeable and capable
01:43 - [Music]
01:44 - black girls code was born out of my
01:47 - recognition as a mom to my daughter who
01:51 - at the time was going into middle school
01:53 - and really interested in computer
01:55 - science and engineering and game
01:57 - development specifically and I
01:58 - discovered that the classrooms in the
02:01 - world that she was entering at that
02:03 - really pivotal point in her development
02:05 - as a kid look just like my college
02:08 - classroom 20 plus years ago so I created
02:11 - microscope to create a community of
02:14 - girls that look like my daughter has
02:17 - similar interest as my daughter and
02:19 - could give her that sense of community
02:21 - and support if we teach a hundred or two
02:25 - hundred thousand those girls will become
02:27 - exponential leaders in their own right
02:30 - the most impactful leaders can connect
02:34 - on a level that goes beyond just the
02:37 - surface element the mission of the
02:39 - company and really get to the human
02:41 - quality of the work
02:43 - I love being a mentor that's something
02:46 - that I get so much joy from because I'd
02:49 - love to encourage be the encourage er
02:53 - because I didn't necessarily have that I
02:58 - really want us to get to a point where
03:01 - it's not an anomaly for a girl to be a
03:04 - computer scientist it's not an anomaly
03:07 - for a woman or a girl to be a robotics
03:09 - engineer
03:10 - I don't want those gender barriers to
03:12 - hinder the next generation from being
03:15 - whoever they are and I think it goes
03:18 - beyond that right I wanted them to
03:20 - understand that they have the right the
03:23 - power to create the life that they want
03:25 - for themselves and it can't be
03:27 - constricted by others opinions on what
03:29 - they can and can't be
03:33 - [Music]
03:37 - you
