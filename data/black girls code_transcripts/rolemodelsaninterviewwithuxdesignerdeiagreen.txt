00:00 - are you ready to meet a virtual reality
00:02 - artist I am Dia green does not only
00:05 - create animated worlds as a VR artist
00:08 - but she is also a user experience and
00:10 - immersive designer at the Walt Disney
00:12 - Company she's a multi-faceted creative
00:15 - and she's front line in this whole new
00:17 - digital world of ours
00:20 - [Music]
00:25 - so welcome Dia thank you
00:29 - of course thank you for coming to the
00:31 - code Zone this girl I'm so excited
00:33 - awesome okay so we're gonna be playing
00:36 - Jenga to get to know you a little better
00:37 - okay so basically each of us will remove
00:40 - one block and place it at the top of the
00:42 - tower without making it collapse if it
00:45 - collapses that round of the game is over
00:47 - and another one begins so as you can see
00:49 - the tower has four different colors each
00:52 - color represents a theme when you pull a
00:55 - specific colored block you will have to
00:56 - answer a question from that color theme
00:58 - the color themes include purple for
01:00 - childhood memories red for career green
01:03 - for inspiration and blue for a challenge
01:06 - okay
01:07 - ready to jump in yes awesome go ahead
01:11 - okay I've never played Jenga before so
01:14 - well this is a great way to start at the
01:17 - code Zone like yes I love that let's try
01:22 - this
01:25 - first green black
01:27 - okay and then when you're ready you can
01:29 - stack it on top okay and then we'll put
01:31 - it on the top like that yep awesome so
01:34 - green for inspiration yes ma'am what's
01:38 - your design process and our storyboards
01:41 - involved for AR design storyboarding I
01:44 - think is a little bit more important
01:46 - because it's a lot more Visual and
01:48 - interactive than ux is on ux design is
01:51 - more foundational and then AR is like
01:54 - more Hands-On with a phone or with a VR
01:57 - headset so storyboarding really helps to
01:59 - like lay out the visuals for that
02:01 - particular interaction if that answers
02:04 - the question that definitely is the
02:05 - question yeah awesome great first
02:08 - question
02:11 - try foreign
02:22 - ER let's see so explain to us what a ux
02:27 - designer is how is your job different
02:29 - than others in the industry my favorite
02:32 - example to use is how do you watch
02:36 - Netflix on your phone versus how do you
02:38 - watch it on your laptop versus your TV
02:42 - versus your like game station like
02:44 - Playstation or Xbox all those uh require
02:47 - different user needs no that's kind of
02:49 - like what a ux center does they think
02:52 - about how a user interacts with these
02:54 - different digital products and
02:56 - interfaces and we try to make it an
02:59 - enjoyable experience for the user I'm
03:02 - gonna go for
03:04 - [Laughter]
03:09 - okay good good choice and we haven't
03:11 - done purple yet no really
03:15 - um
03:15 - it's these middle ones that are easy
03:17 - Once I run out of the little one
03:27 - okay that's okay okay guys we are back
03:29 - for round two yes I unfortunately lost
03:34 - that round it's okay so they are all
03:36 - winners in the code Zone okay
03:37 - okay all right your turn I think you can
03:40 - get a purple one because I think I can
03:41 - get a purple one too it's not meant for
03:43 - me I want to get into these childhood
03:44 - memories girls
03:46 - okay look at that easy peasy
03:49 - nice so describe how you became a ux
03:52 - designer I went to undergrad at Virginia
03:56 - Tech for industrial design which is like
03:58 - physical product design and then I
04:00 - quickly realized that industrial Zone
04:03 - was not what I wanted to do so I was
04:04 - like what can I do that still
04:05 - incorporates that same design process
04:07 - but less Hands-On and more on the
04:10 - digital side so people that graduated
04:13 - from that industrial design program they
04:15 - went on to be ux designers so I just
04:17 - like reached out to them connected and
04:20 - after I realized that okay this sounds
04:22 - really interesting this is what I want
04:23 - to do
04:25 - plus when I started to look at grad
04:28 - school programs I got into grad school
04:29 - in 2019 I was getting my Master's in
04:32 - human computer interaction for ux design
04:35 - I feel like once I took that step just
04:38 - the doors opened up for me it was like
04:40 - the best decision ever for me okay let
04:44 - me try this orange and like I said these
04:46 - middle ones that's all me that's all me
04:51 - perfect okay career we're doing pretty
04:54 - good though no good way better than the
04:56 - first one way better okay how is
04:59 - designing AR different from designing
05:02 - any other piece of digital art I feel
05:04 - like AR it's a mix between 2D and 3D
05:09 - elements versus other I guess digital
05:14 - pieces of art it's usually 2D augmented
05:17 - reality is still very very very very new
05:20 - still very young so I think that sets it
05:23 - apart like how new it is how much of an
05:25 - unknown it still is and how it brings
05:28 - together like different elements into
05:31 - one handheld experience
05:34 - and look at that we literally won with
05:37 - two rounds I didn't mess up I know
05:39 - awesome
05:41 - awesome thank you so much for coming to
05:43 - the code Zone and playing Jenga with me
05:45 - you are such an inspiration thank you so
05:47 - much of course well I hope to have you
05:50 - back oh yeah let's do this next week
05:52 - awesome all right see you guys
06:01 - foreign
