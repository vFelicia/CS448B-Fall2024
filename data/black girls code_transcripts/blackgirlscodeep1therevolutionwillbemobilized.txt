00:08 - we love black girls
00:13 - [Music]
00:18 - C I think black girls code empowers all
00:23 - of us you wouldn't learn coding web
00:26 - design or app designing on a regular day
00:29 - and it just gives you a chance to get a
00:31 - glimpse of what you can do and it gives
00:34 - them a chance to feel like oh I'm all
00:41 - that what I really love about the black
00:44 - girls code movement is that they see the
00:47 - potential the great vast potential in
00:50 - these young black girls and not only do
00:52 - they see the potential they're actually
00:54 - acting on it by making sure that they're
00:56 - serving these girls
00:57 - [Music]
01:05 - this week the girls have been learning
01:06 - about entrepreneurship and business
01:09 - planning for mobile app development and
01:11 - they have been creating ideas for a
01:14 - mobile app that they would love to bring
01:15 - to Market so during the week of the camp
01:18 - we've been learning about App Inventor
01:20 - and all aspects of Entrepreneurship and
01:23 - Business
01:28 - Development the girls broke up up into
01:30 - teams and they've been brainstorming
01:33 - ideas and working on prototypes paper
01:36 - prototypes for their apps sometimes if
01:38 - you're on a page and if you want to go
01:40 - back to a page sometimes when you press
01:43 - this it actually brings you back to the
01:45 - home page uh we put a back button at the
01:49 - top right there and instead of having
01:52 - the name right there we were going to
01:54 - put it at the top so then it doesn't
01:55 - have to before I started with black
01:57 - girls code I didn't even know what HTML
01:59 - was
02:01 - let alone had a code in it I didn't
02:03 - really know how to make a game like the
02:05 - components of games I didn't know what a
02:07 - Sprite was what they're teaching us is
02:10 - like really good to know so if I ever
02:12 - want to make like my own mobile app
02:14 - it'll be
02:17 - [Music]
02:21 - easier it's a little bit difficult and
02:24 - it's very tiring but we're doing a good
02:27 - job and we're learning about the field
02:29 - of marketing what the people were trying
02:32 - to get to want so far I've made an app
02:37 - prototype made like three tutorial apps
02:40 - I was about to design an a
02:44 - [Music]
02:47 - website I think one of the big problems
02:51 - with inclusion is that I think our
02:53 - community is
02:55 - underestimated and the importance of
02:59 - having that adverse perspectives in the
03:01 - room to build solutions to talk about
03:04 - solutions to take action to change the
03:07 - world um if you don't have these
03:10 - different perspectives in the room and
03:11 - these different experiences then you're
03:13 - not going to build the best place
03:17 - [Music]
03:35 - so I think it's really important and
03:38 - awesome the black girls code is here
03:40 - today and we have so many young women
03:43 - here today at Facebook with the
03:45 - opportunity to meet people who work at
03:47 - Facebook work meet Engineers meet people
03:50 - who work on our product as well as just
03:52 - walk around campus and see what it looks
03:54 - like to work here I know when I was
03:56 - their age I wish I had the same type of
03:58 - opportunity and access to visit
04:00 - companies like this to really open my
04:01 - eyes to understand what is possible and
04:05 - it's also really cool because we're
04:06 - working with the Bay Area chapter of
04:08 - black girls code and so we're literally
04:10 - in their backyard and it's awesome to be
04:12 - able to provide access to these young
04:15 - women to come here and just get to meet
04:17 - us and see what's possible for them in a
04:18 - few years I got into programming
04:21 - actually not that long ago last summer
04:24 - um because I come from a low-income
04:25 - family so my family actually couldn't
04:27 - afford to have our own computer at home
04:30 - until I was a freshman in high school
04:32 - and my public school did not offer any
04:34 - computer science classes so I was never
04:36 - actually to get into uh programming as
04:38 - early as all of you guys so you guys
04:40 - actually have a head start on me and
04:42 - it's also very equalizing in a way
04:45 - because I didn't I mean I only started
04:47 - last summer and I'm already interning at
04:49 - Facebook so I think that it's definitely
04:50 - something that anyone can do and anyone
04:52 - can get behind and it's just a very
04:55 - empowering um area not only for you who
04:59 - are learning to program but also the
05:01 - impact you can have on other people as
05:04 - well it's absolutely imperative that we
05:07 - as a company do all that we can to
05:10 - figure out how we can make technology uh
05:13 - more accessible to all the communities
05:15 - out there the biggest thing that the
05:18 - girls got out of this week was a
05:20 - confidence in presentation and really
05:24 - owning the work that they did so we
05:27 - decided to make an app called get green
05:30 - my team we're making an app called
05:33 - summertime fun our app is about cleaning
05:38 - basically it will tell you what to clean
05:40 - your room
05:41 - [Music]
05:46 - with um so our app is about Recycling
05:50 - and how to keep the earth clean which
05:52 - that flower is basically you could scan
05:55 - or take a photo of a flower and the
05:58 - definition will pop up and if if it's
05:59 - edible like to eat and if it's
06:06 - harmful I've done a lot of work and I'm
06:09 - continuing to do a lot of work on
06:16 - women and the fact that women and men do
06:18 - not have equal positions in our society
06:21 - yet because again technical fields are
06:23 - where a lot of our leaders come from
06:24 - technical fields are much better paid
06:27 - and the percentage of women graduating
06:29 - from computer science right now in this
06:31 - country is
06:32 - 13% 13% for every 100 people graduating
06:36 - with a computer science degree 13 of
06:38 - them are women but these are jobs where
06:40 - you really make a difference you build
06:42 - technology you build something like
06:44 - Facebook and then the whole world can
06:46 - use it and so I think on any level
06:49 - whether it's future Financial Security
06:51 - for your families whether it's future
06:53 - just fun for you or future meaning for
06:57 - the work you do having technical degree
07:00 - technical background is so important we
07:04 - know that the women who make it through
07:05 - the girls who make it through they are
07:08 - just as good at this as bu is they
07:10 - always were they just don't get the same
07:13 - encouragement and they don't see the
07:15 - same role models so you can do this
07:17 - because you have this amazing
07:19 - opportunity and you do it not just for
07:21 - yourself but you do it and you become
07:23 - the role model so I hope you're taking
07:26 - full advantage of this great opportunity
07:28 - I'm thrilled we're able to do
07:31 - Facebook they're working with these
07:33 - girls they're they're teaching them
07:35 - these skills and they're they're
07:38 - allowing them to build amazing things I
07:40 - want to reach everyone
07:42 - [Music]
07:59 - aahah
