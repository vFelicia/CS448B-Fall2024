00:03 - foreign
00:08 - places in the world that centers black
00:11 - girls and their Joy but I really think
00:13 - it's seeing other black and brown girls
00:16 - around them the staff looking like them
00:19 - the projects reflecting people that look
00:23 - like them I think that will have the
00:25 - most impact alongside the coding itself
00:29 - I really think it's cool that we have
00:31 - programs especially like targeted at
00:33 - uplifting minority women I think they
00:36 - love being around people that look like
00:37 - them feels like representation it feels
00:40 - like belonging it feels like inclusion
00:41 - it feels like they really have their
00:43 - future at heart black girls code is
00:45 - unique because it's a community
00:47 - everybody has similar like backgrounds
00:50 - and like similarities so it's like easy
00:52 - to like connect with people you get to
00:54 - Pioneer your space and you get to be
00:56 - yourself in this space so you get to let
00:58 - go of all your worries and just you know
01:00 - pursue what you really want to pursue
01:02 - and dream what you want to dream
01:03 - you get to learn something that can
01:06 - carry you for the rest of your life the
01:08 - curriculum not only teaches them these
01:10 - foundational components of coding but
01:13 - it's merged with this idea of you're a
01:15 - beautiful girl uh you're a beautiful
01:17 - person you can do big things one thing
01:21 - that hope that the girls take away from
01:22 - this experience is the fact that they
01:25 - can do anything
