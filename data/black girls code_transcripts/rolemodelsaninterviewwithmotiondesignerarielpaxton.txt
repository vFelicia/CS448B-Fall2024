00:36 - making it collapse if it collapses then
00:39 - that round of the game is over and
00:40 - another one begins now as you can see
00:43 - the tower has four different colors each
00:45 - color represents a theme when you pull a
00:48 - specific colored block you will have to
00:49 - answer a question from that color theme
00:51 - and the color themes include purple for

01:09 - describe how you became an animator did
01:12 - you go to college or university what did
01:14 - you study and why did you choose that
01:15 - major I went to Savannah College of Art
01:18 - and Design which is scad campus in
01:20 - Atlanta and I chose to like get my
01:23 - degree in animation and the reason I
01:25 - chose that is at a young age I watched a
01:27 - lot of cartoons and since I fell in love
01:30 - with it I really wanted to bring that
01:32 - Joy of watching cartoons to a younger
01:35 - audience as well so that's kind of where
01:37 - I started okay so I will go ahead and
01:40 - pick one okay I think this one Yep looks
01:43 - pretty easy
01:44 - okay so blue challenge okay let's see
01:48 - what is your experience being a black
01:51 - woman working in a tech space so far
01:53 - it's been like a good experience but I
01:56 - feel like the thing or the few Studios
01:58 - that I have worked or had the privilege
01:59 - to work in I feel like there's not as
02:02 - many of me there might be some black
02:04 - people that do work there but it seems
02:06 - like it's very few so it's like I'm not
02:09 - sure if there needs to be more Outreach
02:10 - programs so that way more people know
02:12 - that the jobs are available or if people
02:14 - aren't sure of those jobs are something
02:16 - they actually want to take but that
02:17 - seems to be my experience so far in my
02:19 - field okay
02:21 - um
02:22 - here for this one
02:25 - okay cool career
02:28 - what is the role of an animator or
02:30 - digital development artist
02:32 - well a 2d animator usually takes a
02:35 - character and make it move have action
02:38 - and kind of like interact in the
02:39 - environment that it it's in and for me
02:42 - like I'm a junior motion designer so I
02:45 - take basically pre-existing designs and
02:48 - I create stories and storyboard those
02:50 - characters so that way whenever there's
02:52 - like basically a main plot the animators
02:55 - have something to work off of
02:57 - uh Let's do let's do green inspiration
03:00 - uh
03:03 - yes honestly it's it's like 50 50. okay
03:06 - you got it there you go cool cool pretty
03:09 - nice awesome all right so green for
03:11 - inspiration tell us about designing a
03:14 - character where do you start and how do
03:16 - you get inspiration I like to start on
03:19 - who the character is where the
03:21 - characters from what they want kind of
03:23 - like already imagining them as like a
03:25 - real life person which sounds weird in
03:27 - retrospect but it's like you're trying
03:29 - to make this character believable to the
03:31 - audience so you want something that you
03:33 - can kind of pull from real life so if
03:35 - you know someone that you kind of want
03:36 - to like make a character design off of
03:38 - maybe take someone who you know
03:39 - personally or someone who you have
03:41 - you've met in your life and start there
03:43 - and then rough out that process start
03:46 - off with forms like simple shapes and
03:49 - from there like you go ahead and line it
03:52 - out and then you have your final
03:53 - character design
03:55 - oh gosh it's getting harder um I know
03:57 - okay that's a good one to pull in the
04:00 - middle oh it's trying to come out wait
04:02 - wait ah wait here here I'll just oh
04:05 - thank you for you okay okay that's
04:08 - childhood memories love that what are
04:10 - some tools that you would recommend For
04:12 - Young Artists now you could use
04:14 - storyboarding which is a good
04:15 - alternative for storyboard Pro if you
04:17 - don't want to spend that much money
04:18 - they're also like the regular Adobe
04:20 - suite programs if you do have a little
04:22 - bit of money saved up you can get
04:24 - Photoshop illustrator after effects if
04:28 - you're wanting another free program
04:30 - there's open Tunes there are definitely
04:32 - a wide variety of options you could
04:34 - choose but definitely do your research
04:35 - and make sure that you're using your
04:37 - resources so that we are not spending
04:38 - too much money on like the most
04:41 - expensive programs first right better
04:44 - just start small yeah yeah
04:46 - I keep choosing the like loosest one I
04:49 - mean it's working for you though
04:50 - inspiration
04:52 - tell us about your favorite artist or
04:55 - art piece and why they inspire you oh
04:58 - wowie Norman like I think he's like the
05:01 - Pinnacle of like animation for me
05:03 - because he's like basically one of the
05:04 - first black animators at Disney so it's
05:07 - almost like he paved a way for other
05:10 - animators or at least for other black
05:11 - animators to realize oh this is a career
05:13 - that I can actually like try out for I
05:16 - think really changed the game for a lot
05:17 - of people I think it's your turn okay oh
05:20 - it's getting it's getting
05:22 - difficult so I'm gonna try a Little
