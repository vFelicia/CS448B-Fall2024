00:00 - hi I'm kaani and I'm your host for
00:03 - calong today we're going to dive into
00:05 - something super fun making our very own
00:08 - music in scratch that's right by the end
00:11 - of this session we'll have our own
00:13 - unique piece of music remember if you
00:16 - need a refresher make sure to check out
00:18 - the first video in the series where I
00:20 - teach the basics of coding and scratch
00:23 - let's go
00:25 - [Music]
00:28 - coders
00:32 - for my music piece today I want to
00:34 - create a hip-hop style beat coming from
00:37 - a boom box and a speaker my favorite
00:39 - place to dance with my friends is on the
00:41 - playground at recess let's build that
00:44 - together you can code along with me and
00:47 - build the same project as I do or build
00:50 - your very own piece of music I'm going
00:53 - to change my background to the
00:54 - playground and delete the cat Sprite
00:57 - since there's no cats allowed in school
00:59 - of course
01:00 - next I'm going to add two instruments a
01:03 - boom box and a
01:05 - [Music]
01:13 - speaker I'll drag and drop the one green
01:16 - flag click block to the scripts area of
01:18 - the boom box then the play sound until
01:21 - done block from The Sound tab this will
01:24 - make sure that as soon as my project
01:26 - begins music will play to start building
01:29 - my music p piece I'll need to click on
01:31 - the sound tab I'll click choose the
01:34 - sound at the bottom of the page then I
01:36 - can choose from different categories on
01:38 - the navigation bar I'm going to choose a
01:41 - sound from Loops sounds from the loops
01:44 - category repeats a sound a couple times
01:47 - unlike other sounds that play once I'll
01:50 - choose the dance slow-mo sound but feel
01:53 - free to play around with all the
01:55 - different sounds before choosing your
01:57 - own there are so many cool ones to
02:00 - choose
02:01 - from I'm going to choose trombone from
02:04 - the drop- down menu then click the green
02:09 - flag
02:10 - excellent I want the sound to keep
02:12 - playing forever so I'll add the forever
02:16 - block from the control
02:18 - tab now that I've created my Baseline
02:21 - sound I can add other sounds to it I'm
02:24 - going to broadcast another block to
02:26 - start a different sound once I click the
02:28 - green flag in scratch we can make
02:31 - Sprites communicate when a message is
02:34 - broadcasted by one Sprite then the other
02:36 - Sprite or Sprites can receive the
02:38 - broadcasted message and perform a set of
02:41 - actions I can add the broadcast message
02:44 - block from the events tab then add a
02:47 - start second sound
02:49 - [Music]
02:53 - message next I'll click on the speaker
02:56 - and add the when I reive message block
02:59 - to the scripts area select the message
03:01 - from the drop- down menu and add another
03:04 - play sound drum funky until done
03:07 - underneath sounds kind of funny to read
03:10 - all out loud but remember we read the
03:12 - code from top to bottom now I'll click
03:15 - the green flag and hear how it
03:17 - [Music]
03:20 - sounds wow that actually sounds terrible
03:23 - I'm going to choose another song for the
03:25 - tempo let's try this one
03:28 - out
03:33 - I'll change drum funky to crowd laugh
03:36 - now I'll add the forever block to keep
03:38 - the tempo
03:40 - [Music]
03:51 - going great that sounds better much
03:55 - better in scratch you can also add more
03:58 - actions to your music by downloading the
04:00 - music extension
04:03 - below a new music tab will appear in the
04:06 - block palette the music extension
04:09 - includes blocks that let you play
04:11 - different musical instruments set the
04:13 - tempo play notes or drums for a certain
04:15 - beat and create more complex musical
04:19 - patterns the possibilities are
04:22 - endless in the speaker Sprite I'm going
04:25 - to add the play drum bass drum for .1
04:28 - beats block under under the play sound
04:30 - block change the drum to open high hat
04:34 - and point one to one this will make my
04:36 - beat sound even
04:38 - cooler okay now I feel good about how my
04:41 - speaker sounds I want to add some beats
04:44 - to the radio Sprite on the radio Sprite
04:46 - I want to add a wait for 1 second block
04:49 - this will add a pause to the beat before
04:51 - it starts again I want to signal for the
04:55 - beat to start again with a side stick
04:57 - sound so I'm going to add a rest for 25
05:00 - beats block followed by another play
05:03 - drum for 25 seconds I'll try changing
05:07 - drum to side stick and 25 to one
05:11 - remember you can play around with all
05:13 - the options you want to find the sound
05:15 - you like best now I'll press the green
05:17 - flag and listen to what I
05:20 - [Music]
05:24 - created okay I like it scratch is so
05:29 - awesome because it gives us so many ways
05:31 - to customize our
05:33 - sounds watch this in the sounds tab I'm
05:36 - going to click on the crowd laugh sound
05:39 - then play around with the different
05:40 - effects you'll see a purple box appear
05:43 - and you can change its
05:47 - width I'm going to select the first
05:49 - portion of the sound and click louder a
05:52 - few times from the options below then
05:54 - I'll test out the new sounds in the
05:56 - scripts
05:58 - area
06:02 - that sounds all I think I should play
06:04 - with the sound some more I'm going to
06:06 - select the whole sound then reverse it
06:08 - to make the middle section a little
06:11 - [Music]
06:24 - louder wow that sounds interesting but I
06:28 - like it
06:30 - let's take it a step further and create
06:32 - a beat with the music blocks I think
06:35 - adding a piano to the playground will be
06:37 - just the right
06:41 - touch I think I want the piano to make a
06:44 - familiar sound so I'll make the tempo
06:46 - sound like a nursery rhyme let's add
06:48 - some starter blocks when I click the
06:51 - piano I want to start my first tune on
06:53 - Loop then add a snare like tune on top
06:56 - of my Loop to do this I'll add the
06:58 - following blocks
06:59 - when this Sprite clicked broadcast to
07:02 - start tuned
07:03 - [Music]
07:09 - forever now I'll add four play out 60
07:12 - for 25
07:15 - beats each number refers to a sound
07:18 - frequency and each frequency is assigned
07:21 - to a note on the piano I'm going to
07:24 - click on 60 from the second block you
07:26 - should see a small piano click the top
07:30 - arrows to move up and down the piano to
07:32 - find higher or lower notes you can also
07:34 - change how many times the notes play per
07:37 - turn currently the first block is at 25
07:41 - so I'm going to change it
07:43 - to5 and I'll change the second block to
07:46 - 0.1 let's repeat the same pattern for
07:49 - our last two
07:50 - [Music]
07:52 - blocks okay time to test out what we
07:55 - have so far by clicking on the
07:58 - piano
08:04 - you can press the stop sign on the top
08:05 - of the stage to stop and reset the sound
08:09 - now I'm going to choose my snare-like
08:11 - sound to play with my
08:13 - Keynotes add don't when I receive my
08:15 - message and a forever block to the
08:17 - script
08:21 - area I'm going to play another
08:23 - instrument so let's add play drum open
08:26 - high hat for One
08:28 - Beat
08:31 - Let's test it out by clicking on the
08:35 - [Music]
08:38 - keyboard wow now we have two different
08:41 - ways of creating our own music we can
08:44 - choose from different blocks of the
08:45 - sound Tab and put the various sounds on
08:47 - a loop we can also use the music
08:50 - extension to add different instruments
08:52 - and notes to create Unique Sounds let's
08:55 - play this all
08:58 - together
