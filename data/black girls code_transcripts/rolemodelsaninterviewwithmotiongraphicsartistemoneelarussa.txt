01:13 - obviously I did After Effects and stuff

01:17 - was video co-pilot uh it was a website
01:21 - ran by Andrew Kramer and he basically
01:24 - just made all these free tutorials of
01:27 - like really great quality like visual
01:30 - effects and that was a huge thing for me
01:32 - to be like oh I could do this type of
01:34 - stuff and and so that really helped me
01:37 - and also School of emotion they make
01:39 - courses that are just phenomenal cool
01:42 - yeah thank you for sharing yeah okay I
01:45 - guess it's my turn yes from the bottom I
01:48 - think that would like balance it out yes
01:50 - yes yes yes and then go oh look at that
01:52 - easy peasy super easy peasy so have you
01:55 - always been an entrepreneur
01:57 - um I would say uh back in the day
02:02 - um back when I lived in Chicago I
02:04 - remember this is probably like my first
02:06 - memory of being an entrepreneur my mom
02:08 - would bring home twinkies and I would
02:10 - sell them at school for like 50 cents so
02:12 - I was like I knew I was a businesswoman
02:14 - like I knew from that day I was like
02:17 - stocks money Investments so yeah okay
02:21 - cool okay
02:23 - I honestly we're doing pretty good I
02:25 - know
02:27 - um I'm gonna pick a challenge because
02:29 - this one's sticking out it's calling my
02:32 - name okay
02:33 - [Music]
02:35 - yeah oh yeah yeah that's what it was
02:39 - okay name as many digital art programs
02:42 - in 10 seconds as possible okay the
02:45 - program can be for any level okay ready
02:48 - do you want me to give you 15 seconds
02:50 - yeah okay go after effects blender
02:54 - Cinema 4D
02:56 - um illustrator Photoshop InDesign
02:59 - um Arrow
03:01 - uh five seconds
03:06 - um uh I got pressure oh you got a lot
03:09 - though you did say a lot that was good
03:11 - the last few seconds as soon as I knew
03:14 - there was only five seconds left I was
03:15 - like blank I know honestly that happens
03:18 - to all of us yeah
03:20 - let's pick from the bottom here I think
03:21 - I feel like this would be easy I think
03:24 - yeah
03:29 - but it's good good you're good okay so
03:32 - career
03:33 - what is your favorite nft sold or
03:36 - created and why my favorite piece I mean
03:39 - I had to go with my last piece because
03:42 - it was like the most time I've ever
03:44 - spent on a piece but it was also this
03:46 - thing of like I am going to invest my
03:50 - time into something that I think will
03:53 - come out good and that is the most
03:54 - scariest thing because you're basically
03:57 - just putting all your eggs in one basket
03:59 - and you're willing to like take the
04:03 - consequences of not getting paid and not
04:06 - selling it based on like faith in
04:08 - yourself and so that was like really
04:12 - it just felt amazing to be able to
04:15 - accomplish exactly what I set forth and
04:18 - so yeah it was a very fun project it was
04:20 - a long time but I think it was worth it
04:23 - for sure yeah
04:25 - okay okay
04:27 - um which one looks good done like not
04:30 - that much of I don't know I like the
04:33 - challenge challenge just keeps me on my
04:35 - toes
04:37 - okay oh this one's good oh yeah that one
04:40 - yeah yeah yeah yeah
04:42 - I practiced Jenga before I got here oh
04:45 - really wow look at you
04:48 - okay another challenge
04:50 - what is your experience being a black
04:53 - woman working in a tech space it's
04:56 - interesting because ever since I was
04:59 - going to film school I had realized how
05:04 - little black girls are involved at all I
05:09 - actually wanted to pursue
05:11 - um cinematography before like doing
05:14 - Motion Graphics but like being a girl
05:16 - being a woman color
05:18 - um I just face a lot of discrimination
05:20 - at like the school that I was going to I
05:23 - just had men that were intimidated or
05:25 - just like didn't feel like I was
05:28 - deserving of respect one person had said
05:31 - like well how do you expect to get
05:33 - respect when you dress like that and it
05:37 - was like hmm judge me on like being a
05:40 - bad person like judge me on being a bad
05:42 - worker like don't judge me on a piece of
05:44 - cloth like right it just doesn't make
05:47 - sense and so when I started like
05:51 - trying to pursue cinematography I
05:54 - realized I couldn't do this without
05:56 - other people like I need a crew and so
05:59 - it pushed me more towards doing Motion
06:01 - Graphics which I am so thankful for
06:03 - because I have such a deep love
06:05 - promotion Graphics but it had made me
06:08 - realize like it started
06:11 - um started Sheltering myself and I
06:13 - started like really putting myself like
06:15 - behind the scene you know where I'm like
06:18 - behind a computer like oh you don't need
06:19 - to know who I am and I realize how bad
06:23 - that was for me to do that like I needed
06:25 - to show my face because I needed other
06:28 - little girls that look like me to be
06:30 - able to see that like look like we are
06:33 - in this field right because before it
06:35 - was like oh like I can't wait to grow up
06:38 - and work for an animation studio and it
06:40 - was never this idea of like I can't wait
06:42 - to grow up and own my own Animation
06:44 - Studio I think a part of it has to do
06:47 - with access another part of it has to do
06:50 - with lack of representation if we could
06:53 - start changing that we could start
06:54 - having the conversation more not that
06:55 - like I want people to feel uncomfortable
06:57 - about having this conversation I want
06:59 - people to feel empowered of being like
07:01 - yeah like let's change this like this is
07:03 - totally possible and doable yeah like we
07:06 - could just continue having this
07:07 - conversation and like it could really
07:09 - change the lives of so many people so
07:12 - yeah it's interesting though
07:15 - I just oh no
07:19 - it's okay
07:21 - it's okay though because I still want to
07:23 - ask you one last question yes okay we're
07:25 - just gonna yeah we'll just pretend that
07:28 - didn't happen Okay what is one thing you
07:30 - want to tell us but we haven't asked you
07:32 - yet I guarantee you I pinky promise that
07:35 - you will get better at whatever it is as
07:38 - long as you spend an hour a day like an
07:40 - hour really isn't a lot and it's like if
07:42 - you can invest that time into yourself I
07:45 - wholeheartedly believe that you will
07:47 - become better without a doubt I agree
07:50 - yeah we can spend an hour on Tick Tock
07:52 - we can definitely spend an hour doing
07:54 - absolutely and that we love I'll be
07:57 - spending like three hours on Tick Tock
07:58 - so I can spend at least an hour at least
08:00 - an hour exactly yeah thank you to all my
