00:18 - we can't have like film education or
00:23 - dance classes or any of that stuff the
00:25 - only thing we have right now is banned
00:28 - which is porous or Shawn was shot we got
00:32 - PE and Nessie
00:40 - South Florida is one of those things
00:42 - where we have invisible lines and it's
00:45 - an invisible line that you do not cross
00:47 - if you're coming from a black community
00:49 - trying to get the opportunities that are
00:50 - in the white community we just have
00:53 - lines that we won't cross we know that
00:56 - it's a way out unfortunately in our
00:58 - communities especially in South Florida
01:00 - we have a lot of real schools that are
01:02 - underperforming and they're under
01:04 - serving our kids so if that's the dialog
01:06 - you know if you're if you're a student
01:08 - and you have a teacher that doesn't want
01:10 - to be there and it's only there because
01:12 - to get a paycheck
01:13 - well that trickles down to how a child
01:15 - ends up feeling about their own
01:17 - education now we have a system on in an
01:20 - educational system especially in South
01:21 - Florida we have the FCAT so we have a
01:23 - system that only teaches to the test now
01:26 - they're not really teaching they're not
01:28 - fostering creativity they're not really
01:30 - promoting to kids to go to college or
01:32 - start businesses because that's not what
01:34 - passes the FCAT test it's not that black
01:39 - children minority children aren't smart
01:41 - enough a lot has to go back to their
01:43 - school systems aren't good enough so
01:45 - when you come from a school system that
01:47 - Hillary hugs you behind when you get to
01:49 - college you get explained you get
01:50 - exposed to people with much more diverse
01:53 - backgrounds and you're able to kick keep
01:56 - up it's just harder magnet oh they're
01:58 - just not smart my story is you know I'm
02:02 - from Baltimore no inner city you know I
02:06 - did a lot of things that inner city you
02:09 - know kid does you know I initially live
02:11 - in inner city I hung out my friends were
02:13 - they that's the cool thing to do you
02:14 - know there's all the rappers you wanna
02:16 - be a drug you know that's doesn't
02:17 - definitely tell us there's so many
02:20 - factors that contribute to why students
02:24 - why
02:25 - young minority use our help back don't
02:27 - have the same don't have the same skills
02:30 - such as others but that doesn't mean
02:32 - that they can't get
02:54 - they take what they see in our children
02:57 - and use it and
02:59 - man Jamaica babies look like
03:02 - they are part of something that
03:06 - they take them and make our children
03:09 - look like they will not get nowhere no
03:12 - further than the corner this with the
03:16 - whole culture is people's trend oh if I
03:19 - do this if I'd be smart if I go to
03:21 - school I'm not black enough it's no such
03:23 - thing as being black enough you can be
03:25 - you can be like that why don't because
03:27 - we're black why do we have to knock why
03:29 - wouldn't I have the 19 degrees why don't
03:30 - we have to not do the right thing
03:32 - you know just because you can from
03:34 - Overtown you came from living city or
03:35 - you came from the foot bring projects
03:37 - they don't mean you can't make it out
03:38 - the hood don't mean you can't be
03:40 - something so I could have been a drug
03:43 - dealer I could have been a gang member
03:45 - but I chose to not do that even though I
03:47 - grew up around it I chose to be smart I
03:49 - had my whole mind so with meat having my
03:51 - own man I knew I'm not gonna do drugs

03:55 - not gonna talk guns around I want to be
03:57 - better I want to be able to take care of
03:58 - my family one day I want to make it out
04:00 - there I want to be something their life
04:03 - our kids our families our communities in
04:06 - general are dealing with so much that
04:10 - that's why it's important for folks like
04:12 - myself for other entrepreneurs that look
04:16 - like our kids
04:18 - we're technologists that look like our
04:20 - kids to create platforms to really
04:23 - engage the young people and introduce
04:26 - them to these concepts because the
04:28 - schools can't and
04:30 - aren't able to do everything
04:34 - technology sitting my life because it
04:37 - gave me something that I thought was
04:38 - cool so now my thought was interesting
04:40 - and it gave me a pathway to know there
04:43 - was something I could do after high
04:45 - school
04:45 - no you just don't know where to go you
04:48 - don't have a community center for if the
04:50 - goals that's why I love black
04:58 - the director of the miami-dade College
05:00 - Carrie meek entrepreneurial education
05:02 - center and I'm also a board member of
05:05 - the miami-dade Economic advocacy trust
05:07 - the group that's responsible for
05:09 - bringing black both code to Miami
05:12 - this is the fastest best way that we
05:16 - thought we could just accelerate this
05:24 - one we're targeting underprivileged
05:27 - girls a lot of them are consumers of
05:29 - technology where they're using popular
05:31 - applications such as Instagram Facebook
05:33 - etc however learning how to create those
05:37 - is something that just doesn't exist
05:39 - unless they're being exposed to it so
05:42 - today we were doing our workshop called
05:44 - build a game in a day and basically
05:46 - basically we taught the building blocks
05:49 - of HTML and CSS so they need to put
05:52 - their spin on it and bring to the
05:54 - environment or to the cultures the world
05:56 - what they see is a need Iran China
06:00 - like I had to make to learn how to make
06:03 - my own website uh yesterday it was
06:05 - actually fun because I was able to hike
06:07 - up to another website and mess up
06:08 - everything on purpose I love black girls
06:11 - code because it's a much-needed movement
06:15 - to really create community as far as our
06:19 - young girls in particular and get them
06:22 - integrated with the opportunities as far
06:25 - as technology and the prepare them for
06:26 - the jobs today and tomorrow Black Rose
06:31 - Bowl is astronomical and influential
06:33 - black girls code represents a beginning
06:37 - you know it's almost like Alex through
06:39 - the looking glass
06:40 - it propels little girls into this world
06:45 - that they had no idea existed
07:18 - you
