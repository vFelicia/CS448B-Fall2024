00:05 - creates bold colorful illustrations
00:08 - inspired by black women she not only has
00:10 - her own collection at Forever 21 but I
00:13 - loved her art so much that I had to fill
00:15 - the code Zone space with it

00:21 - are too
00:23 - [Music]
00:28 - so welcome Shea thank you for coming by
00:32 - are you excited to play Jenga I am it's
00:34 - been a very long time so just bear with
00:36 - me but yes no problem so we're gonna
00:38 - basically be playing it to get to know
00:40 - you a little better each of us will
00:41 - remove one block and place it at the top
00:43 - of the tower without making a crumble if
00:46 - it crumbles that round of the game is
00:48 - over and another one begins so as you
00:50 - can see the tower has four different
00:52 - colors each color represents a theme
00:54 - when you pull a specific colored block
00:56 - you will have to answer a question from
00:58 - that color theme
01:00 - the color themes include purple for
01:02 - childhood memories red for career green
01:04 - for inspiration and blue for a challenge
01:07 - so are you ready to get started let's go
01:09 - awesome I always give my guests the
01:11 - honors okay
01:13 - let's see here again bear with I mean
01:17 - it's been a it's been a minute so I
01:18 - don't have any
01:19 - yeah the blues are a little rough today
01:21 - that was easy
01:25 - love it
01:27 - okay so tell us a challenge that you've
01:30 - dealt with as an artist and how you
01:32 - overcame it when I first got out of
01:34 - school I thought that I wanted to be an
01:37 - artist and that to be my main source of
01:39 - income and what that ended up doing to
01:41 - me personally is making me create things
01:43 - just to sail sometimes those things I
01:45 - didn't like they were just things that I
01:46 - was focused on other people lacking
01:48 - enough to buy and so it starts to mess
01:50 - with your the way you look at yourself
01:52 - as an artist but now I've learned to
01:54 - just you create what you love and then
01:56 - the tribe will come like my mom used to
01:59 - say the people that want it will come
02:00 - they will find you
02:01 - okay let's do let's do another career
02:04 - let me see oh gosh it's this one looks
02:08 - kind of loose so yep
02:11 - got it
02:17 - what are your favorite elements to
02:19 - create and what are your favorite colors
02:21 - to use I love Line work in abstract
02:24 - shapes like anything with patterns
02:26 - multiple rip repetition I absolutely
02:29 - love that and I love organic shapes I've
02:31 - always loved abstract art my favorite
02:33 - color palette kind of as we see here
02:35 - yeah 11 oranges teals turquoise uh this
02:40 - hot pink is really really one of my big
02:42 - babies and then like a chartreuse green
02:44 - always love those maybe if I pull this
02:47 - way let's go on that's good oh gosh why
02:49 - do I feel like it's gonna fall let's
02:51 - just try it anyway if it falls then oh
02:53 - well
02:59 - and we're back okay so I'm gonna do
03:04 - let's uh what's some inspiration okay
03:09 - um oh this one's loose perfect nice
03:13 - okay last inspiration question so tell
03:17 - us what your design process is and our
03:19 - storyboards involved uh no I would love
03:22 - to say that I'm some very organized
03:24 - artist who has like you know a wall full
03:26 - of planned out art but I don't because
03:27 - when I used to plan out art or plan out
03:30 - creating something it was very necessary
03:33 - and forced whereas now I just literally
03:35 - love sitting on the couch and being like
03:37 - Oh get my laptop I want to make
03:38 - something real quick I'll come back to
03:39 - it I'll add to it next week or maybe
03:41 - never you never you know but again I
03:42 - just love that not having a need to
03:44 - finish something or pump out this art
03:47 - constantly you just you create when you
03:49 - want to create
03:51 - yes yes
03:53 - okay so tell us about partnering with
03:56 - Brands I think one of my favorite ones
03:59 - that I work with HBO on doing a mural in
04:02 - Atlanta and being from Atlanta and being
04:05 - someone who absolutely loves street art
04:06 - and graffiti on walls having someone say
04:09 - can we put some of your art on a wall
04:11 - with absolutely insane for a new show
04:13 - that they were premiering one of my
04:14 - favorite shows actually Fresh Prince and
04:16 - they were doing the reunion and I got to
04:18 - create a piece for that it was just an
04:20 - amazing experience that's been one of my
04:22 - highlights working with a I'm a brand or
04:24 - a company well congratulations on that
04:27 - that's lovely okay I think I want to
04:29 - finish up our careers okay
04:33 - um okay oh that was too easy I don't
04:36 - know what it is okay so I like this
04:40 - question how do you make your art
04:41 - profitable so I think for me not trying
04:44 - to be profitable has been what's been
04:46 - successful for me I'm just telling my
04:48 - story and somebody says oh I can relate
04:49 - to that I want to support that person
04:51 - and they do but if if you can don't
04:55 - don't aim to make make sales right
04:57 - because that kind of thoughtful you're
04:58 - working what you're creating and I think
05:00 - people can like sense that too right
05:04 - I think we're gonna finish off with a
05:05 - bang
05:07 - okay finishing up our childhood memories
05:10 - have you always wanted to be an artist I
05:12 - didn't always want to do it as a career
05:14 - but I've always been one like I said I
05:16 - wanted to be a doctor you could have
05:18 - never told me otherwise up until about
05:21 - 11th grade but I'm always just it's
05:23 - always been me to be a maker it's always
