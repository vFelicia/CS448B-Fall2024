00:05 - game industry executive Jen has produced
00:08 - some of your favorite games such as Tony
00:10 - Hawk Skylanders and Crash Bandicoot
00:13 - [Music]
00:19 - hey Jen hi how are you I'm doing well
00:23 - we're going to be playing Jenga to get
00:25 - to know you better today basically each
00:27 - of us will remove one block and place it
00:29 - at the top of the tower without making
00:30 - it crumble if it crumbles that round of
00:33 - the game is over and another one begins
00:35 - as you can see the tower has four
00:37 - different colors each color represents a
00:39 - theme when you pull a specific colored
00:40 - block you will have to answer a question
00:42 - of that theme the color themes include
00:44 - purple for childhood memories red for
00:47 - career green for inspiration and blue
00:49 - for challenge let's get started
00:51 - all right okay
00:53 - alrighty
00:55 - challenge question all right all right
00:58 - oh we're starting crazy all right all
00:59 - right list as many female game
01:02 - characters as possible you have 10
01:04 - seconds so Princess Peach from Mario
01:06 - Coco and tana for Crash Bandicoot
01:10 - um Tales From Sonic
01:12 - ikora and Anna Bray from Destiny Cortana
01:17 - from Halo
01:19 - um
01:23 - it shouldn't be that hard but
01:26 - awesome it's my turn Okay
01:29 - um let's see we got a blue and a green
01:31 - let's try oh let's try an orange here oh
01:33 - yes this Jenga is tricky I know oh there
01:36 - we go beautiful
01:39 - do I I'm gonna get like that there we go
01:42 - all right perfect okay career tell us
01:46 - what you do as a game producer give us
01:49 - your day to day you can think of a game
01:51 - producer as kind of like air traffic
01:52 - control so you have a team that could be
01:55 - very large and they're all making
01:58 - different parts of the game and you have
02:00 - to make sure that things are coming
02:01 - together at the right time so the game
02:03 - producer is essentially managing the
02:05 - schedule making sure that there if
02:07 - there's any barriers to any of the
02:09 - developers that they're removing them
02:11 - they're managing the budget they're
02:12 - managing the scope of the game the
02:14 - timeline wow I love it so you're like
02:16 - the glue that holds everything together
02:18 - pretty much it's it's hard when you know
02:21 - the developers are so talented and
02:23 - sometimes they can get so just narrowly
02:25 - focused on the thing that they're
02:27 - working on where the producer has to be
02:29 - zoomed out and looking at the entirety
02:31 - of the game and making sure that the
02:33 - pieces fit together right
02:36 - [Music]
02:40 - oh my gosh see I knew I should good job
02:43 - all right
02:44 - okay another career question so
02:49 - who do you usually work with to develop
02:51 - a game so there's a lot of people
02:53 - involved in making a game you'll have
02:55 - some concept artists there's designers
02:58 - and there's all manner of designers you
03:01 - can have designers that are focused on
03:03 - level design how does the space feel how
03:05 - is it laid out what's the user
03:07 - experience as they travel through it
03:09 - they're systems designers there's combat
03:12 - designers how does this character move
03:14 - and react there's all manners of artists
03:17 - you have animators you have 2D artists
03:19 - who do the user interface of the game 3D
03:23 - artists could be character artists or
03:26 - environment artists of course lots of
03:29 - programmers and again many flavors of
03:32 - that there are people who work directly
03:35 - on the game these are gameplay engineers
03:37 - and then there's people that work on all
03:39 - the stuff underneath so tools Engineers
03:42 - for example they're they're building the
03:45 - stuff that allows the designers to
03:47 - create the creative experience that you
03:49 - have
03:50 - there's Network Engineers people who are
03:54 - focused on making sure that you can play
03:57 - online with your friends and that you're
03:59 - connecting with each other and of course
04:00 - there's the production team that as I as
04:03 - I mentioned earlier is kind of the glue
04:05 - that brings it all together
04:07 - interesting alrighty
04:09 - um oh it's your turn oh yeah okay it's
04:11 - gonna pick another block all right let's
04:13 - see
04:13 - um
04:14 - challenge myself oh
04:20 - I'm scared
04:23 - look it it's wobbling can I do it can I
04:26 - do it can I do it
04:28 - that was amazing wow okay name a
04:32 - misconception people have about the
04:34 - gaming industry one misconception that
04:36 - people can have is just sort of they
04:38 - have this old school idea of what a
04:40 - gamer looks like and what a person who
04:43 - is in the industry looks like and it's
04:45 - really off quite frankly half of the
04:47 - gamers out there are women
04:49 - I won't say that the industry matches
04:51 - that demographic yet but we need to get
04:55 - closer for sure and we've got an
04:57 - audience that needs to be represented
05:00 - appropriately in the industry itself
05:01 - yeah absolutely representation is key
05:05 - absolutely okay I'm gonna go for a
05:08 - purple one okay
05:10 - oh
05:13 - very good you've got to push through the
05:16 - middle down I learned it from you
05:20 - alrighty okay what do you know now that
05:23 - would have made an impact on your life
05:25 - when you were younger anyone can code
05:27 - and anyone who wants to should you know
05:30 - I I brought up stardew Valley as one of
05:32 - my favorite games and this one person
05:34 - was able to create this labor of love
05:37 - because they had the tool set to do so
05:39 - and that's the thing when you want to
05:41 - create you've got to you've got to do
05:42 - the labor of understanding your craft
05:51 - oh man I wow let me think of what color
05:55 - I want to pick I'm gonna do
06:01 - yeah all right I knew that was
06:03 - interesting smooth
06:04 - nice all right okay
06:09 - if you could create a game with no
06:11 - restrictions at all what would it be
06:14 - describe it for us I I have two is that
06:16 - okay so I love jrpgs
06:20 - um these are Japanese RPGs and I love
06:23 - life simulations like Animal Crossing
06:26 - something that blends the two I think
06:28 - would be really fun and cool to make one
06:31 - other game that I've just been Milling
06:33 - around in my head forever is I used to
06:36 - be a dancer I was a ballet dancer and
06:38 - I've always wanted to do some kind of
06:41 - dance game not Dance Dance Revolution
06:43 - where it's just kind of following steps
06:45 - but something that's more allows you to
06:48 - be more creative I mean if you could
06:50 - choreograph your own Show musical
06:54 - production or something given the right
06:56 - set of tools yeah I mean I don't know
06:59 - how many people would want to play that
07:01 - but I would love to make it I would I
07:03 - would play that
07:06 - oh my God my God oh my goodness
07:11 - I can't even do purple
07:23 - all right there we go what is one thing
07:26 - you want to tell us but we haven't asked
07:29 - you yet one thing I would love to say
07:30 - especially to this audience is we really
07:33 - need you I mean we we need uh young
07:37 - women women of color to come in to this
07:40 - industry and help us create these games
07:42 - there's no way that we can truly
07:45 - authentically represent the wide range
07:48 - of characters that we need to to
07:50 - represent if we don't have diversity in
07:52 - our in our ranks we need people sitting
07:55 - at the creative table making those
07:57 - decisions and so you know please
07:59 - consider it we we need you and I think
08:02 - that you'll really love it there's no
08:04 - there's no other industry like that like
08:07 - this that brings together technology and
08:10 - creativity all in one place yeah you
