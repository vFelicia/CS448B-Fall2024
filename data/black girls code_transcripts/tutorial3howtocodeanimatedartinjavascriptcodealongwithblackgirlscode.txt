00:00 - what's up brilliant coders it's your
00:02 - girl Jillian and I'm your host for code
00:05 - along in our previous videos we added
00:07 - animations that happen after multiple
00:09 - clicks of the mouse in this video I'm
00:12 - gonna spill the tea on how to add
00:14 - animations to the background
00:16 - like this moving ball for example
00:20 - all right then let's get into it come
00:22 - with me to the code Zone
00:24 - [Music]
00:29 - let's start learning how to animate a
00:32 - moving object in our background for
00:34 - today's purposes we'll practice this
00:36 - skill with a circle or ball
00:39 - [Music]
00:40 - like that so you probably remember that
00:43 - we can create and name our own functions
00:46 - to use on our canvas functions are
00:48 - blocks of reusable code that perform a
00:51 - specific action just like angle mode and
00:55 - create canvas since we want to show a
00:57 - ball moving in the background of our
01:00 - picture inside of our draw function
01:02 - above our afro we'll create another
01:05 - function called Draw ball then below our
01:08 - draw function let's add the following
01:14 - inside our draw ball function let's
01:17 - start with the really easy step of
01:19 - creating a yellow ball with the circle
01:21 - function the X and Y coordinates can be
01:24 - 50 and 350 because I want to be able to
01:28 - see the starting point of the ball on
01:31 - the canvas you can also comment out the
01:34 - face and afro so that you have a blank
01:36 - canvas
01:37 - now I want the ball to bounce up and
01:40 - down in the Y directions but I need a
01:43 - variable to store the position of the
01:45 - ball in the Y Direction Let's create a
01:48 - variable called Circle Y and assign its
01:52 - value to 350 then replace 350 in the
01:55 - circle function
01:57 - if we add the total sum operation from
02:00 - the previous videos then the ball should
02:02 - move in the y direction
02:04 - so add circle y equals Circle Y plus one
02:11 - great the ball is moving
02:16 - but it's moving off the canvas to where
02:20 - I can't see it anymore we need to set a
02:22 - boundary so that the ball stays on the
02:25 - page in previous instances that we've
02:27 - set a boundary like with the afro
02:30 - growing we reset the item to the
02:33 - beginning position once it reached a
02:35 - certain size or length but that's not
02:37 - going to work here in order to create a
02:40 - functioning boundary in this scenario we
02:43 - need to send the ball in the opposite
02:45 - direction once the ball hits one edge of
02:49 - a boundary so we'll want to use the edge
02:51 - of our canvas to set the boundaries and
02:54 - if the ball hits the boundary then it
02:56 - will return in the opposite direction
02:59 - so if the y-coordinates value is greater
03:02 - than the height of the canvas or less
03:05 - than zero then that means you reach the
03:07 - edge
03:08 - once you have reached the edge the ball
03:10 - should move in a constant negative y
03:13 - direction
03:15 - so how do we do that let's create
03:18 - another variable to store the speed of
03:21 - y-coordinate and assign a value of one
03:25 - now we have two variables for y
03:28 - Circle Y keeps track of its position and
03:31 - why speed stores how fast the ball will
03:34 - move in the opposite direction replace
03:37 - one in the sum total operation with Y
03:40 - speed
03:41 - let's also put a console log open
03:44 - parentheses Circle Y circle y y speed y
03:50 - speed close parentheses below are sum
03:53 - total operation
03:55 - this will allow us to see the change in
03:58 - the ball's position and the speed
04:00 - look at the console and you can see the
04:03 - balls starting at 350 and increasing to
04:06 - Infinity we can change the direction of
04:09 - Y speed by multiplying its current value
04:12 - times negative one
04:16 - every time Circle Y comes into contact
04:19 - with the edge of the canvas it will
04:21 - switch from positive to negative now
04:25 - look at the console again you can see
04:27 - Circle Y go from increasing to
04:30 - decreasing values and why speed change
04:32 - from positive 1 to negative one
04:37 - great the ball now bounces off the
04:39 - canvas walls now let's repeat the
04:42 - previous steps but for your circle's x
04:44 - coordinate let's add a circle X variable
04:46 - and set it to 50. then a x speed
04:50 - variable and set it to two I set the x
04:52 - speed value to 2 because I want the ball
04:55 - to move faster side to side than up and
04:58 - down replace 50 with circle X in the
05:02 - circle function and set your conditional
05:04 - to bounce off the left and right walls
05:07 - of the canvas
05:09 - the right wall of the canvas is the full
05:12 - width just like the bottom of the canvas
05:14 - is the full height
05:15 - okay fam we have come a long way we
05:19 - combined all that we have learned from
05:21 - the previous videos to create an
05:23 - animated background and listen
05:25 - I've got a little secret to let you in
05:27 - on see that animated ball we just coded
05:30 - well what if I told you that the ball is
05:32 - interchangeable with other shapes and
05:34 - words that's wild now so let's take it a
05:38 - step further and turn our ball into a
05:41 - moving message to our animated art piece
05:44 - I'm going to comment out our ball
05:46 - section and add a variable called
05:49 - message under X speed
05:54 - remember that variables can store
05:56 - different types of values such as
05:58 - numbers and text the message will say I
06:03 - love my hair
06:04 - [Music]
06:08 - now I want my message to be in white and
06:11 - size 32 but you can adjust this to your
06:14 - liking then replace the X and Y
06:16 - coordinates in the text function with
06:19 - circle X and circle y
06:21 - now we have a powerful message that
06:24 - bounces all over the canvas hey let's
06:27 - get it yes we did it we did it
06:31 - all right I guess we should probably get
06:34 - back to work now now I promise the rest
06:36 - of the work is just as exciting I want
06:39 - to add an awesome feature to the face so
06:42 - that when I scroll over the canvas with
06:44 - my mouse the face will change to show
06:47 - all skin tones first I will create a
06:50 - variable called skin tones that will
06:53 - store a list of skin tones
06:55 - this variable uses an object called an
06:58 - array that stores different types of
07:00 - values after we create the variable we
07:03 - will go to Google and type in skin tones
07:06 - hex then click on the first link
07:08 - go to the colors palette and select all
07:11 - the skin tones hex code copy and paste
07:14 - the hex codes inside of the skin tones
07:17 - array each color should be surrounded by
07:20 - quotes and separated by commas just like
07:23 - this
07:25 - now we have a list of skin tones we can
07:27 - use for the colors of our face the next
07:29 - step is to add skin tone to the actual
07:32 - face we've drawn so p5.js has a function
07:35 - that allows us to see every time the
07:37 - mouse is moved on the canvas called
07:40 - Mouse moved it's very similar to The X Y
07:43 - tool that tracks the X and the Y
07:45 - coordinates on the canvas so scroll all
07:48 - the way down to the bottom of your
07:50 - canvas below your draw function and add
07:53 - the following
07:55 - type in console log open parentheses I
07:58 - moved the mouse close parentheses
08:01 - move the Mouse anywhere on the drawing
08:04 - then look at your console we can use our
08:07 - object array to move through our list
08:09 - each skin tone in the list is
08:12 - represented by a number starting with
08:14 - zero and increases along the number line
08:17 - to go from one tone to the next I will
08:21 - need to add one to a counter every time
08:23 - I move the mouse so let's make a
08:26 - variable called counter and set its
08:29 - value to zero
08:30 - just like we said our afro size and hair
08:33 - height values to 380 and 160. we can set
08:38 - skin tones to one value using our
08:40 - counter go to the face section replace
08:43 - the current color with skin tones
08:45 - counter
08:46 - the face of the color should match that
08:49 - of the first tone in our list so let's
08:52 - add the following if the counter becomes
08:54 - greater or equal to the length of the
08:57 - list of skin tones then reset the
08:59 - counter to zero
09:01 - great now we can go through the list of
09:04 - tones and start over again once it
09:06 - reaches the end
09:08 - dope right okay it's your turn to add
09:11 - other features using the mouse mood
09:13 - function but before you go don't forget
09:16 - to save your work or share it with a
09:19 - friend by going to file then save or
09:22 - share
09:23 - you are a legit animator after today we
09:26 - created an animation that was activated
09:28 - by just moving the cursor across the
09:31 - screen be sure you come back for our
09:33 - last animated art video where we will
09:35 - create a dynamic animated art piece with
09:38 - pulsating animations well until next
09:41 - time remember to show yourself a little
09:43 - love and as always stay cute and stay
09:47 - coding
09:56 - thank you
