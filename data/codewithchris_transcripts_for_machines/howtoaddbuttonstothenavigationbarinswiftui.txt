hi I'm Chris and I'm going to show you how to add buttons to your navigation bar so I've got a simple xcode demo here that is just a single text element let's add a navigation bar by wrapping this element inside a navigation stack all right and now we have a navigation bar although you can't see it in order to help you visualize it why don't I add a navigation title this isn't necessary uh for adding the buttons in the navigation bar but it does sort of give you a reference of where that bar is now the actual modifier you want to use to add the bar buttons it's called toolbar and it's a common mistake to try to add it here on the navigation stack what you want to do is add it to the element inside of the navigation stack so while we go ahead and do that and inside the toolbar you're going to add your buttons there is is a toolbar button item and first of all we're going to use this one and let's just add the you know a text that says settings perhaps now it just appears there by default but if you wanted to uh customize the placement let's say you want to put it on the left well the toolbar item has a parameter called placement and you can specify uh it is going to be top bar leading or trailing so this would move it to the uh left if you wanted to make this a button you definitely could I just made it a text for demonstration purposes so let's assume that we want to add another one on the right hand side and for the placement I'm going to put it on the right and for the content why don't we try making this a button and we are going to um for the action let's leave it as a todo and for this let's put an image and we're going to add an icon here or it say plus and it's really that simple and that's how you add buttons to your navigation bar in Swift UI for more Swift Joi tutorials check out our playlist here and if you're brand new to iOS development check out our 3hour beginner class linked right over there thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video oh and one quick thing if you want to download the sample code for this we've got it all in a single handy exco project in fact it contains sample code for all of the Swift UI components so that you can learn from it or copy and paste the code into your own project just visit cc. swiftui dkit it's a free download I'll leave it in the description below the video too
