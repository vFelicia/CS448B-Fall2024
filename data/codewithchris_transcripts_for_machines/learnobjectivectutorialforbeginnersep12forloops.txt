hey guys in this episode we're going to learn about for loops and objective c which are really going to help you when you need to execute similar code or the same code over and over again for a number of times alright so let's see how you do it you can download this project in the link in the description below or you can click on the link in the annotation on the screen and in this video we're going to talk about the for loop sometimes when you're writing code you have a repetitive task or you're calling a method a couple of times or you're adding something up and in this case that's what loops are used for so there's something called a for loop which lets you specify statements which you can loop predetermined number of times let me show you there's three parts to it the initialization the condition in the increment in initialization what you're going to do is to declare a variable that you're going to use to keep track of how many times your loop is going for so i'm going to use an integer called i and i'm going to initialize that to zero and then in the condition this is where i specify the condition for which the loop will terminate so i'm going to say terminate my loop when i is greater than 10. so in other words this would read keep looping if i is less than 10. in the increment after every single loop how much would i increment i by and plus plus is kind of a shorthand notation of writing something like i equals i plus one which just increments i by one every single time by every single loop so let's say for example i have an integer up here called age and let me initialize that to zero and then in my for loop let me say age is well let me just go h plus plus so after this for loop runs what would you expect age to be well it would be 10 because in the first loop i is zero and then in the second loop i is one and it goes all the way up until the ninth loop when i is nine and then on the tenth loop i would be ten and this condition would be false and then it would break out of the loop so this is a way for you to be able to write any sorts of statements in here to repeat so you wouldn't have to write it out a whole bunch of times now the other thing that makes for loops even more useful is the fact that you can actually use the variable i inside the loop to do something so let me say age equals age plus i and let me actually quickly show you another way to write this an equivalent way to write this would be age plus equals i and these two statements are equivalent let me just comment this one out so what's happening here this statement is saying for every loop add whatever value i is to the age so at the end of this loop well in the first loop it adds zero to zero and the second loop would add one to zero and then third loop at that two to one and then three two three i'm trying to do addition on the fly in my head uh but basically you kind of get the idea for loops can also be used another way and i know i haven't showed you guys what arrays are yet but an array is simply think of it as a container of objects so if i say something like um let's say container of names and let's assume that this array let me just write name it this way let's assume that this array contains 10 different strings and each string represents represents a name another way i can use for loops is something like this so again i initialize my i is equal to zero at the beginning and then my condition would be so what i'm doing here is i'm saying i begins at 0 and then i want to loop as many times as there are items in this array so that's what this count property means it gives me the amount of items in the array of names and then in here i can say something like my name is equal to the array of names at index i so remember i told you the array contains 10 different names this method object at index returns basically the name at a position that i pass in so in the first loop i would be passing in 0 which would give me the first name in the second loop it would give me the name at position the next position and so on and so forth now another way to write this is i can you know if i know that this array contains strings i can go like this and in this for loop this would be equivalent to the one up here and in this for loop it's basically saying for each name or for each ns string in this array assign it to a variable name and i can do stuff with name in here so now you can see how useful for loops are in objective c for your fact of the day did you know that apple once made its own video game system neither did i check it out in the link below you
