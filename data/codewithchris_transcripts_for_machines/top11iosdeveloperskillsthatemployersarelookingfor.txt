hey coke crew what's up in this video I want to share with you the top 11 skills you should have as an iOS developer if you want to maximize your chances to get an iOS developer job alright let's jump right in hi my name is Kris Ching and welcome to code with Kris where we teach people how to build apps now Before we jump into number 11 I just want to say one thing upfront and that is that if you're just starting out and you're just learning iOS with the intention of getting an iOS developer job in the future don't treat this list as something that you need to know before you start applying yes knowing everything on my list is going to help increase your chances of getting a job but you can always apply for a junior developer positions and a lot of these things that I named can be learned on the job just be honest and upfront about what you know and what you don't know and most employers will be more than happy to grow your skills if they sense that you're an enthusiastic learner and that you have a real passion for this stuff alright with that said let's start with number eleven networking and working with the api's these days it's going to be hard to find an app that doesn't do some sort of networking or download some sort of feed so that's why it's going to be really hard to get your dream iOS job if you don't even know what JSON is which is pretty much the standard format when it comes to working with data from api's or data feeds that also means that you should be familiar with your Apple networking libraries like URL session and popular third party in networking libraries such as Alamo Fire you should be able to parse your JSON using the codable protocol or json serialization number ten Grand Central Dispatch now many iOS developers can tell you differences between the main thread versus a background thread without really knowing much about Grand Central Dispatch but if you understand in their workings of iowa's concurrency then that is definitely going to give you a leg up when it comes to showing and demonstrating your expertise to the interviewer number nine working with databases now there are so many database options out there that it's hard to know them all however knowing some of them will be helpful for your resume and your interview my recommendation brush up your skills on some of the most popular databases to use with iOS apps number eight working with thirdparty libraries now some iOS development teams will swear not to use them because they don't want to rely on a thirdparty library but I think the majority of teams do use them the fact is that using a thirdparty library can speed up your development cycle tremendously I recommend going with timetested consistently updated ones and that means that you should know how to integrate thirdparty libraries into your Xcode project using something like cocoa pods or the Swift package manager number seven unit testing if it's your first Iowa s development job and you've never worked in the team before you'll quickly realize how important unit testing is because multiple developers will be submitting code on top of each other and functionality is bound to break and if you discover it late it's going to be a nightmare to unravel that's why creating a test suite to validate the functionality of your app is so important as a professional developer in any programming language you should at least know how to write a test case number six source control and team collaboration tools team collaboration tools are going to be a musthave skill that employers are going to look for on your resume because chances are you're going to be working on an iOS development team so make sure you know your kit commands and spend some time working with github and bitbucket so that you can put it on your resume some iOS development teams will also make use of lint tools such as Swift lint to enforce a consistent coding style so if you've never used it before just spend an afternoon with Swift lint trying it out so that you can put it on your resume continuous integration with Jenkins bit riser circles CI is something that some development teams will use as well especially with large enterprise type of applications don't worry about it if you've never used them before that's something that you can definitely learn on the job but definitely read up on it so that you can speak intelligently about it in your interview if it happens to come up number five Xcode love it or hate it Xcode is still the most popular IDE when it comes to iOS app development now it can be pretty easy to pick up just by spending a few days learning the ins and outs of Xcode with some tutorials however Xcode does have some deeper features that takes years to master such as advanced debugging and using instruments to diagnose your app performance and mastering all of the Xcode shortcuts alright number four now you didn't think there would be a list and Swift wouldn't be on it right if you're just starting out and you're debating whether you should learn objectivec as well or maybe instead of Swift let me just tell you that Apple is going forward with Swift and that is what you should learn there are companies out there that are still looking for objectivec developers but that's usually to support some sort of legacy application that was built in objectivec years ago that has been passed down through lines of developers and you're going to be end up supporting or trying to fix bugs in that app and who wants to do that so objectivec can be a nice to have but definitely focus on Swift programming number three building user interfaces now you can't call yourself an app developer if you can't actually build an app right and half of the app is the UI the problem is that there are different ways to go about it you could use interface builder and storyboards you could build it programmatically and now you can use Swift UI as well between using storyboards and building your UI programmatically I would say that it's best to be able to do both now in my experience building the UI programmatically has been the way to go at the workplace but some workplaces use storyboards an interface builder as well and some use a hybrid approach combining both so it's in your best interest to know how to do it both ways and in regards to Swift UI it's still an infant technology and many companies aren't willing to invest in unproven technology that being said I do think Swift UI is an investment for your future because as we all know with what happened with Swift and objectivec when Apple decides that this is the way that's going forward everyone is going to follow suit so apple says Swift UI is the new thing it's in your best interest to learn it but just know that you might not be able to use this skill right now number two integrating design assets now chances are in the professional environment there will be a dedicated professional graphic designer that is to design how the app looks and give you the graphic assets to implement into your app now a good iOS developer is going to be able to identify which design elements actually needs a graphic asset and which ones can be styled programmatically and if there's ever a decision on which one to use if you can do it programmatically that's going to be preferred because it's going to be faster than loading images into memory as an iOS developer you should also be able to style Vanilla UI kit elements and create custom controls if you need to and number one know your design patterns in design patterns are simply just software development best practices and their programming language agnostic which means that these design patterns can be applied no matter what language you're using so learn your design patterns using best practices especially in a team environment is always a good thing now I listed these 11 skills in no particular order but knowing these ones will maximize your chances to get a job as an iOS developer now did I miss any do you agree or disagree please leave me a comment below and let me know and lastly this video is actually part of a larger piece of content on my website titled how to become an iOS developer and land your first job now in that article I have resources and links to learn all of the 11 skills that I presented today so if you're interested in reading the full article with all of the resources I'll leave the link in the description below so you can click through to my website and read that lastly I want to ask you guys to give this video a thumbs up if you liked it subscribe to my channel if you haven't already because that is a huge help and let's YouTube know that more people should know about code with Kris so thank you so much for your support and I'll see you in the next video
