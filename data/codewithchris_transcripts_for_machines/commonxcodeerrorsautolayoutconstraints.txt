hello welcome to this lesson where I'm going to show you some common auto layout constraint errors and how to fix them so you can add Auto layout constraints in two ways one is through the storyboard like I'm about to show you and the second way is programmatically through Swift code I'm going to show you both ways but we're gonna start with the storyboard version so first let me just put the text field onto the view and I'm going to add some constraints to it now by horizontally and vertically centering it in the container and then I'm gonna go here and select update frames and you can see how it's so small because I don't have any height and width constraints to it so I'm gonna select that click this icon right here and I'm gonna add a height and a width so for width I'm gonna add a hundred and for height I'm gonna put 40 so let's add these two constraints now let's update frames again and now we have this text field that's in the center now sometimes because you have so many elements on the screen and you're adding so many constraints that you can accidentally add constraints that would conflict with the constraints that you have already added so in other words that element can't simultaneously satisfy all of the constraints that you've put on it and remember constraint is nothing more than a rule so if you're you know having two rules here saying that it should be horizontally centered in the screen and vertically centered on the screen and then I'm going to add another rule to say that it should be zero margin from the top and zero margin from the left let me add these two so you can see now instantly there's all these red lines because on one hand two of my constraints put the location of the text field up here on the other hand the other two constraints put it in the middle here so you see all these red lines indicating that there are it's an error conflicting constraints you click this red button up here and if you don't see this doc there's a little button here in the lower left hand corner where you can hide and show this document outline so you click this little red guy right here you can see that here are the conflicting constraints and if you just run your mouse over it you can see which ones they are and you can fix them so what happens if I just run the app now which I'm going to do to show you well the system in order to produce a layout it's going to break some constraints in order to satisfy as many constraints as it can so you can see right here there's a faint grey outline along the edges of the simulator you you might have to look hard to notice it but what it's done is it's broken my height and width constraint for the text field so it's broken those two constraints so that it can adhere to the centering constraints as well as the left and top zero margin constraints so by breaking the height and width constraint it's just made my text box or my text field huge in order to satisfy those four constraints the or the two different positioning ones that were conflicting so that's how it would work and furthermore in the console down here you scroll all the way to the top you can see the it tells you unable to simultaneously satisfy the constraints and so that's your indication that something is wrong so when you're laying out these constraints on the storyboard it's it's very easy to see what's wrong or it's really easy to get an idea of what's happening because of all these red lines and actually an aside if you don't see this console what you want to do is make sure that you have this tab highlighted because you can close the console window like that and if you don't have this bottom drawer at all its this top icon here you can hide it and show it okay so now let's go into programmatic constraints so I'm just going to get rid of the text field here so our view is empty and I'm gonna save it I'm going to go into the view controller here I've commented out all of this code but I'm gonna comment them back in and I'm gonna show you with programmatic constraints you can also have errors it's a little harder to debug but in my experience it's usually at least for beginners it's usually one or two different things that could be the problem so just remember when you have an element that you want to add constraints to if you're adding size constraints like I'm doing here adding the height and width you want to add the constraints to the actual element so my text field add constraints now if you're adding layout constraints here be sure to add them to the parent container of the element that you want to position so in this case we want to position the text field right so these two constraints we want to add it to the parent that contains the text field in this case it's the view controllers view so self refers to the view controller because I'm writing this code in side view controller dot Swift and view is the view property of the view controller which references the view and you can see up here that I've placed the text field as a sub view of the view so in other words the view is the parent container of this text field right so that's why I'm adding these positioning constraints to the view now if you added these positioning constraints to the to the text field itself you're gonna get an error I'll show you so let's do my text field dot add constraints and I'm adding these positioning constraints this is gonna cause an error because I'm gonna run it now because remember the positioning constraints you want to add it to the parent container of the element so let's see what we have in the console here we scroll all the way up and you can see it doesn't even highlight the line that is wrong so you can't always rely on this where it's crashing so go into the console here scroll all the way to the top the view hierarchy is not prepared for the constraint so that's your clue that indicates that that might be a problem so check that your size constraints are being applied to the element and your position constraints are being applied to the parent container of the element okay so let's stop this and let's undo so it will run again so that's one common problem that I see another common problem is that when you're adding these position and constraints even though you're adding it to the view you know the container the parent of the element you have to make sure that that element is actually added to the view first so if I forget to add the element to the view you can see up here I've just created it I've created some size constraints then I've added those size constraints to the textfield element and then I proceed to add these positioning constraints to the view but nowhere have I actually put the textfield element into the view and because these two positioning constraints refer to the text field for positioning within that view it can't because the text field actually isn't in the view yet so now if I run it I'll show you what kind of error you get so it crashes scroll up all the way up here in the console the view hierarchy is not prepared for the constraint yep you read that right it's the same error message as the the other mistake that I just showed you right so if you see a mistake like this an error message the view hockey is not prepared for the constraint then you want to check two things first of all if you're positioning that element I'm gonna undo now has that element been added to the container view or the the view and if you're adding positioning constraints are you adding it to the parent container of that element and if you're adding size constraints are you adding it to the element itself so those are the things to check when you get that that sort of error and I see this quite it's quite common so be sure to keep an eye out for it I hope that was helpful to you guys and stay tuned for more helpful videos to help you resolve Xcode err
