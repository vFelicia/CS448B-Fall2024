so it was a little bit of an accident really I remember this was back in January of 2013 I was working at a software consulting company where we built apps and web apps and software for clients and for that year our CTO said has a mandate to all developers a company you should get involved in the community this year and for me being an introvert that was kind of a problem didn't really want to talk to anyone and so I decided I was gonna create a blog and I was going to write my lessons learned and I was gonna create a YouTube channel where I would teach iOS development because that was what I was doing and I wasn't intending to show my face even so I remember recording those first few YouTube videos were really really rough and I really took so many takes to do it I hated the sound of my voice and then I didn't even show my face for the first bit and those videos are still up so you can actually check them out if you scroll all the way to like my first videos I was so monotonous so boring in my opinion but then I just kept at it you know I got better and better got more comfortable with myself and I started getting feedback from people you know that they were using my material and they were learning and they were really able to get value out of it and that made me so happy I didn't even intend for there to be any audience really I started the blog and the YouTube channel because of what our CTO said and for the reasons that I wanted to climb and better my career at the job that was the reason I started all of this but just seeing people read my articles and watch my videos and give me that good feedback that it was helping them it gave me so much satisfaction more satisfaction than building apps at getting building after the clients for the consulting companies and getting props from my boss or whatever you know so it was so good like I like helping people in that way so much that I wanted really to make it a fulltime job if I could and at that time I was making a bit of an ad revenue from YouTube something like eight dollars a day and I was like if I produce more videos then I should make more ad revenue and pretty soon that could be a fulltime income and so that was my plans produce more videos make more ad revenue quit my job and do this fulltime because I love it that didn't really work out because the ad revenue if fluctuates you have you have videos which which you know are hits in some heart and I think at my highest point I was like at $15 a day but you know really it really wasn't working out and I had actually taken a sabbatical to think about that and I was on such good terms with a boss that he let me take two months off just to relax after a bad project and after a tough project and I I told him I really really needed this time off just to figure out reset myself figure out what I wanted to do and yeah that's what I did so for two months I I just relaxed and I worked on my youtubechannel worked on my blog and I only got it up to like 15 dollars a day and that wasn't enough to quit my job I went back to work I refocused myself on my career and I was gonna climb my career that was my that was I realized my self with those goals and then I hit this bad project a little later on so I hit a hit a bad project and there were bad projects before but this one was particularly bad it was during the last two weeks of the project that's always crunch time trying to wrap up all the bugs trying to ship the product to the client and you can expect some late nights but that night was particularly bad it was like the straw that broke the camel's back and we we had left office at like 300 a.m. and parking lots empty you're driving home snow cars on the road and then we had to come in the next day I like 930 a.m. and I remember sitting back down at my desk in the morning my back was hurting and I could barely keep my eyes open they were hurting and I was just thinking about wow if I retired at 65 how many more years do I have to work you know and it if I can't keep this out my body my body wouldn't be able to keep this up and my health is more important than anything else and so you know and in the satisfaction that I got from my youtube channel and listening to how I was helping people that you know that was that was the greatest thing I didn't get any more satisfaction from anything else than that and I really really wanted to make that my fulltime job so what I did was I quit my job and I gave myself eight months to try and make it full time he come and I thought if I can't make it work I can always look for a new job because the job market was pretty good for iOS developers that wasn't really that afraid of that but the thing is at that point of time I was married and I had my wife and we're thinking about having kids and we were thinking about buying a house so there's all these like big expenses and big life milestones coming up and so it was kind of scary in that regard my wife continued working she was so supportive of me to try to do this and I realized that in eight months time I was able to produce a course actually how I arrived that producing course was actually you guys I have such a supportive audience and I just asked you guys if I created a product or a course that was paid would you guys purchase it and enough people said yes that it gave me the confidence to go ahead and spend that time to produce it and so I made my first course it was on objectivec teaching complete beginners I was app development and from then that point on I've just continued updating that course when Swift came out and converted it to Swift and that's really been my main income asset for all this time right that it's 2019 now that was 2013 so I'm so thankful that I've been able to do this full time and live my dream teach you guys and I'm so satisfied every day to hear about all the accomplishments and all of the people who are learning Iowa's app development for me so it's all thanks to your support you're watching my videos and you're reading my articles and yeah that's how code with Chris started never that I think that it would turn into what it is and now my wife she's working on code with Chris as well so we have three people we have my wife myself and we have Adrian who edits all the videos and and talks with you guys in the community and the YouTube comments so it's so awesome it's so awesome and I'm also so excited for what's to come because I feel like we're just getting started as code with Chris's starting to mature a little bit and starting to become a little bit more of a real company we're gonna be able to produce higherquality stuff we're gonna be able to produce more stuff and be in more places and get more exposure and all that stuff I can't wait but in the end all it really comes down to is the ability to affect more lives right and I've come to realize that at first when Cola Chris started it was really you know you could say that it was for selfish reasons right I wanted to I wanted to be able to do this fulltime and it made me really happy right those are me reasons but later on as I as I did it through the years the reasons kind of morphed and I realized that I was touching people's lives and I was affecting people's lives I was helping people a lot of people who are completely not coders coming to the coding world get jobs changed the directions of the careers or people you know decide that they want to go into this for school things like that I saw affecting people's lives that really ultimately that is my mission now to build up this platform and so I can reach more and more people and more lives change more lives and you know I couldn't be happier that this is what we're doing is what I'm doing asked my job so thank you guys all for helping me get started on my feet with this I can't thank you guys enough for watching I'll see you guys next time
