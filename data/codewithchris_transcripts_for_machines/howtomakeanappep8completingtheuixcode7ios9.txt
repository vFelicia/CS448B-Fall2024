hey guys welcome to lesson eight of how to make iphone apps with no programming experience in this lesson we're going to complete our user interface by adding the second card image view a background image view in the deal button all utilizing the auto layout constraint and size class concepts that we learned in the previous lessons now that you know the basics of auto layout constraints and size classes this part is going to be pretty easy for you so what I'm going to do is drag another one another image view onto the view but what you can also do delete this for now what you can also do is click your image view press command D to duplicate it and you can see here I've got another copy of it but what I would do first and foremost is go over to the document outline here it's named the same way so I would highlight that and press ENTER and then change that name just so it doesn't get too confusing so as you can see it also copied the sizing constraints because the sizing constraints are part of the actual element however it did not copy the positioning constraints so we're going to have to add those so what I'm going to do is click the second card open up the alignment menu vertically Center in the container and then I'm missing an x position constraint but remember I want it to be 50 from the right edge on portrait size classes and I want to be 150 from the right edge on landscape size classes so now I'm going to go into the specific size classes so I'm gonna go do this one for all iPhones in portrait and actually I don't even see my card so where is that let's go resolve Auto that constraints update frames no there it is it's right over top so make sure that you've selected second card if you're not sure which is second card go here in the document outline just select it from here so you're sure select second card go to this pin menu uncheck constraint margins enable the right margin this time select 50 press tab and then add one constraint so now let's update frames and there we go this is only in the portrait size class remember so now we're going to jump over to the landscape size class and again my second card is probably over top this one so I'm gonna select second card and go back to the pin menu uncheck constrain margins enable the right margin and this time we're gonna set to 150 press tab add one constraint click this button and go update frames let's give this guy nobody he's got a background too so now let's command R to run the project and we are gonna see both cards like that so there we go next we're going to add a button so I am going to go back to the any width in any height size class now I'm going to search for button down here and in this size class Xcode complains about this second card imageview not having a an exposition constraint but I'm just going to ignore that because I know in the specific size classes I do have those constraints okay so this is my button I'm going to select the button I'm going to go up here and change the title to deal and I am also going to set some constraints for this guy so remember I'm in the any within any height size class I'm going to horizontally Center it but in terms of where it is vertically from the bottom of the screen I'm going to make that specific to whether it's important or landscape so again I'm going to jump into the portrait size class so you can see my deal button is way off there but I'm going to highlight it I'm gonna go into the pin menu you know uncheck constrain to margins I'm gonna enable the bottom constraint I'm gonna say 200 add one constraint okay now I'm going to click this button and update frames so there's my deal button for the portrait orientation I'm gonna jump into the landscape one and you can see my button is way down here I can't even see it can't click it but I can click the button from the document outline so I'm going to select it from the document outline like this I'm gonna go into the pin menu uncheck constraint margins enable the bottom margin and now I'm going to say 50 press tab add one constraint actually you can also select this drop down update all frames and containers and then click Add constraint and it's going to add that constraint and then update all of the views so you don't have to go here and update frames from this button here so you remember to do that you save a step okay so now we've got our deal button and let's how it looks by running our app pressing command R okay so we've got our button right there that might be a little too high in portrait so we can change that and there's the button in the landscape view so I'm just gonna adjust it in portrait to something else let's jump into portrait really quickly I'm gonna select that constraint and instead of 200 here I'm just gonna say 150 and it lets at the background so let's search here for image view before we add it to the view however make sure you change it back to any width in any height because you want that background to be visible on any within any height if you only add it to this size class then it's only gonna show up in portrait mode so I'm gonna go back to any within any height I'm gonna just drag the image view here so what we're going to do is we're going to add constraints for this background so go into the pin menu and I'm going to uncheck constraint to margins what we're going to do is enable all four margins but you got to be careful here because of the spacing says spacing to the nearest neighbor now this image view for this right margin you may think that if I set this to zero it's going to be flush against the right edge right but that's in fact not true because that spacing is relative to the nearest neighbor and the nearest neighbor for this image view is actually this 2nd card image view if you click this little drop down arrow here you can see it's going to be positioned zero against the the left edge of this second card instead I want to change this to the view okay and change that to zero so just double check that pull down the drop down make sure it says view and when you do that it changes the number on you but enter zero same for this one I'm going to change it to be relative to the view and not the bottom layout guide change that to zero here that's fine and for the top margin I'm going to say vo and not the top layout guide because I want the background to stretch even up to the top edge of the screen even if it's the status bar so I'm going to go view I'm gonna hit zero and press tab now I'm going to add these four constraints I'm gonna click this little button here and update frames and then you can see that my image views here all got miss position and my button got miss position too because remember in this any width and any height size class we haven't positioned the the two card views for the xaxis and this deal button doesn't have any sort of position on the yaxis we added those constraints in the specific portrait size class in the landscape size class but you're going to see when we run the app that's going to work out right now we have to add a background to the image view because we actually can't see anything without an image so I'm gonna add this pink background for my background image view and then in the document outline I'm going to rename this to background now I'm going to run the app by pressing command R so now we've got this pink background that's covering all of our elements but we can fix that let's go back into our storyboard and you see how all of these elements we've got the first card the second card the deal button in the background well the background is over top everything right all we have to do is grab the background here click and drag it all the way up there so it's the element that is sitting behind all of these other guys now if we run it we're going to see that the background will be behind all of the elements ok so there we go so now we got the basis of our user interface what we can do now is remove the colors from these elements so that they're back to the default State so we're going to select my background and change it back to default select the first card change the background back to default select the second card and change the background back to default now when you run it you can't see anything but in subsequent lessons will be adding images to these image views
