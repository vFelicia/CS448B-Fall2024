so recently a mom asked me will AI make iOS developers Obsolete and she was asking for her son because he wanted to pursue a career in programming now my first instinct was to yell no absolutely not programmers will always be needed but I had to pause because if I'm being completely honest with myself we are on a path to writing less and less code so what does that mean for the future of IOS app developers well I share these thoughts in our latest you you video but I'll sum it up for you right now and that is that no I don't think we will become obsolete but I do think the role and what we do will change so if you want to find out what those changes are that I think of course this is all opinion and um how I think our role will change check out our latest YouTube video swipe up and go there thanks for watching
