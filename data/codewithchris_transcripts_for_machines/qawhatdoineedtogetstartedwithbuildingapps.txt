hello and welcome to the code with Chris Q&A where I take a couple of minutes to answer questions that you guys have today we have another beginner question and that is what do I need to get started with making apps I'm just going to rephrase this question a little bit to what do I need to get started with making iOS apps because I teach primarily how to build apps for iPhone and iPad and furthermore I teach you how to do that using the tools that Apple provides so those tools namely xcode is only available for the Mac so the short answer is that all you need to get started is a Mac computer because that application where you write your code called xcode that's available for free uh from the Mac App Store and then that's all you need you don't even need a device because you're able to uh write your code X code and then they have a builtin simulator which will pop out a screen of the device on your computer on your monitor and you're able to test your app in that simulator and if you don't have a Mac check out my other Q&A episode where I go through some of the PC based Solutions where maybe you can uh rent a Mac online or you can simulate the Mac environment on your PC or maybe use some of the crossplatform solutions that are available on a PC so you can check out that Q&A episode for that thank you for listening and I hope you enjoyed today's episode I'd really appreciate it if you share it with your colleagues and friends if you like the episode and to subscribe and rate depending on which platform you're listening to this on uh thanks for listening again and I'll see you guys next time bye for now
