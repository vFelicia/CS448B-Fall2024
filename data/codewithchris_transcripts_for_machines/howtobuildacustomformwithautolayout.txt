hey there how's it going so recently I got an email from one of my core students asking how we can create this forum using Auto layout I'm here to deliver so let's do it so here I've got a brand new Xcode project we're in the storyboard I'm going to show you how to build the form using stack views so first we're going to search for stack view we're going to use a vertical stack view and then we are going to I just add a margin to it all four sides doesn't really matter what you put right now that can be adjusted later but the strategy we're going to take is each row in this form is going to be a horizontal stack view containing a label and the text field and then so they're going to be five of these horizontal stack views all of them are going to be put together into a vertical stack view so so far we have the vertical stack view I'm just going to rename it here so it's easy for you to see I'm going to drag this horizontal stack view into the vertical stack view so you have something that looks like that and maybe we'll just call this like row stack for you and then next we want to add a label and a text field now I'm not going to drag it into the storyboard because it might be a little hard to see I'm going to drag it directly into the document outline search for text field put it in there now you should have something that looks like this when you collapse the row stack view it should contain those two elements and when you collapse the vertical stack view the horizontal one should be tucked into it now what this gives us is one row and it's stretched out for the entire length of the vertical stack view I'm actually going to give a height to this row stack view because even though I give it a height it's still going to work for multiple orientations because as the screen gets wider it's going to stretch width wise but I don't necessarily want it to get taller like it does now this looks ridiculous right to have a text field that tall so I'm going to click on the row stack view and I'm going to add a height to it I'm just going to make it 30 so notice that I'm adding the height constraint to the roast a few and not the textfield itself this way both the label in the text field inside will conform to this height that I've set on the horizontal stack view the next thing I want to do is highlight this row stack view I'm going to duplicate it a couple of times you can do that by pressing command D so I'm gonna do it four more times because we have a total of five rows and now I'm gonna highlight these four and I'm going to drag it underneath the vertical stack view now you have to be careful not to drag it into the wrong place but if you do you can just rearrange it again so now we have all five row stack views inside this vertical stack view and there are a whole bunch of errors but don't worry about them for now and the next thing we want to do is add some spacing between each row stack view so let's go ahead and change the spacing on the vertical stack view so let's just say 10 and for each horizontal stack view I want to add some space between the label and the text field so we're gonna highlight them all like that and hit 10 for the spacing so now we get something that looks like this the next thing we want to do is going to be customizing the text of the labels to match this so we have host port username password and type and then we're also going to fill in some of these now this is a placeholder text this is an actual piece of text in this text field placeholder placeholder and nothing in here so host port username password and type so let's see if I can remember this we've got host and the text field is 10.10 10.10 or me down dotcom now you can't see that placeholder text there right now but it is there when you run it in the simulator you'll see it this is port and the actual text so don't put it in placeholder text 0 this guy was user name don't worry that the text fields are of different sizes and widths this placeholder text was admin this label was password and this placeholder text was a couple of stars make sure you also enable secure text entry for the password and you can see that it's indicated by that dot there this label was type and there was no placeholder text or default text now we want to make sure that all of these text fields are aligned and the same width so what we do is we take the the label with the longest width so that would be username and we're going to have all of these other labels have equal widths with the username label so an easy way to do that is hold down ctrl on this host label click and drag and you're gonna see this blue line drag it to the user name label let go and you're gonna be able to select equal widths and as you can see there the host label has an equal width what the user name label now and then the text fields will be aligned so we're gonna do the same thing with port equal widths and password make sure you're selecting the right element it's really easy to get confused here and accidentally select the wrong one and if you do then you can simply look for the constraint and here and then delete it alright so now we have this form here and we can view it in a couple of different orientations maybe let me zoom out so we can do that you can see here that I want the width to stretch but I don't necessarily want the text fields to get taller that's why I have that high constraint there so you can see that even on smaller screen sizes okay so even on an iPad it would look like that where the text fields are stretching now one thing is if we wanted let me change the device back to an iPhone first if we wanted this form to be kind of at the bottom like the the other screen had this image I mean what we could do is actually just remove this constraint that says that this vertical stack view needs to be 20 from the top if we removed that then there is no constraint saying that and it can stick at the bottom or actually what we could do is take that top constraint and instead of deleting it you can change the relationship instead of equals 20 you can say that it can be greater than or equal to and you'll still have this constraint but this will be a flexible constraint so it can be more than 20 but these left right and bottom will be 20 now if you have the form down here you have to be careful because when you are typing into these text fields you're gonna have the keyboard slide up and it's going to cover the form I'm not gonna cover how to animate the form up in this video bye do you have another video that talks about that and how to implement that sort of functionality where this form will slide up if the keyboard slides up so I'll link to that video in the description or you'll see a little banner at the top right now linking you to that exact video to do that functionality so that's it if you like this video please subscribe so you don't miss any upcoming tutorials thanks and I'll see you guys in the next tutorial
