hey guys it's Chris here for another episode of the xcode tutorial series So today we're going to be talking about uh adding files to your excode project so let's get started hey guys so we're here talking about adding files to xcode and you can download this xcode project in the link below or you can click The annotation to download it but it's just the fresh project that I created right now so as you can see you know all the files are here in my project folder and if I pull up finder you can see that it's added all those files and dumped it all in one directory so I mentioned before that I kind of like to organize them into uh different folders now one way you might start to do it is you might right click on the project Navigator and you might say new group you know and view controller and I mentioned before that if you create that group and then you drag your view controller into it your files there and you organize it this way in the project that's great but it doesn't actually change any of the files on the file system it doesn't organize it there so you can imagine if you have a really large comp complex project with a ton of files and you organize it this way then um your source code in your you know actual file system is going to be a mess it's just going to be one folder with all of your files in it so what I usually do how I usually start off is I kind of remove all of these files here and you don't want to delete them so you right click delete I mean you don't want to move them to the trash you just want to remove the project reference to it so then I will go into my file system and I'll create the actual folders and now move the files into them on the file system and then I will actually drag it into uh my project so it brings up a dialogue like this and it's just saying so this check mark sometimes if you're dragging files from uh outside of the project so let's say you had some images and it was sitting outside of your project if you had this checked off then it would create a copy of that item in your project folder and you usually want to do this because if you don't copy it into your project folder and then you you zip up the source code and you send it to someone then you might be missing files and here we talked about groups versus folder references and I'm actually going to go into that a little bit more in the next video kind of pros and cons of each but for now I'm going to create uh them as groups so add to targets if you've if you just created a single application then you're just going to have this one Target and it should be the name of your app but some xcode projects may have multiple build targets and that's a future topic so for now you know that's checked that's fine but if you had multiple build targets you would be able to select which Target you want this file to be included into so finish and then it goes ahead and adds it as a group and adds it in there and in the future if I wanted to create a new file I would rightclick and then create a new file let's just create a attempt class and then it would ask me where to save it at this point so I could save it in the folder I created on my file system and then in this manner uh it would still be uh it'll still be organized on the file system as it is in your project Navigator so let me delete that this time I do want to move these temporary files to the trash now another way that you can add files um aside from drag and drop is to rightclick and then go to um existing so add files to xcode project and then I can just select my whole folder and again you have these options here so I'm going to add it and there it's going to add my folder and view controller so these are still groups don't get them confused with uh folders so for example if I you know move my view controller file into the app delegate group that's not reflected in the file system I just want to reiterate that so now you guys know how to add files to xcode but what about organizing them in the next episode we're going to talk about folder references versus organizing your files in the groups um now for your fun fact of the day so did you know that the most expensive part in the iPhone is the retina display screen and it only costs $28 so my question to you guys is do you think the price of technology has gotten too high or do you think that all of The Branding marketing and research and development all of those costs justifies the price that you know an iPhone commands these days I think it's something like $500 or $600 for an iPhone let me know in the comment section below and I'll see you guys next time
