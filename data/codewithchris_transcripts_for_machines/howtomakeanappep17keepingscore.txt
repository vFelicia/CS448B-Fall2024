hey everyone welcome to lesson 17 of how to make iPhone apps with no programming experience in this lesson we're going to finish off our war card game we're very close all we have to do is update the score labels so we're going to open up our xcode project and do that now here I am looking at the viewcontroller.swift and just to review we did add a couple of IB Outlets to connect uh these labels in our storyboard to the left score label and the right score label uh and just to remind you what they look like let's jump into the storyboard very quickly here there they are those two zeros and we are going to update those score labels so first of all what we need to do is declare two variables in order to track the scores um they need to be integers so we can increment them so I'm just going to keep things together let's let's do some organization here I'm going to cut and paste that right here and for the right side I'm going to put that right there and underneath here I'm going to call it the right score is an integer just assign zero into it our left score equals zero okay okay so what we're going to do down here is if the left card wins we're going to say left scores plus equals 1 and that's going to add one to the left score and if the right card wins I'm going to do right score plus equal 1 and if it's a tie I'm not going to do anything if the left card wins now we got to up update the label okay so let's just write a comment here update the label and here increment the score so update the label we have the left score label and the label has a property called text and we pass a string into this text property in order to update it so I need to pass in left score but the problem here you can see is that left score is an integer and this text property expects a piece of text or a string uh we can easily convert this integer into a string just like we converted the uint up here generated by Arc for random uniform into an integer type we're going to do the same thing here we're going to convert this number left score into a string data type and then we can assign it to the text property of the label okay so let's do something in here increment the score and here update the label so write score label. text equals string write score like that all right so that should do it let's run our app and let's see it in action all right let's click the deal button so right card wins CPU gets one king beats four player gets one and five beats three so player gets two so this situation here um this situation here we might want to change because if Ace probably should be the highest card but right now the ace is at the first index of our array so it's pretty much got an index of zero in this case the number two beats Ace number three beats Ace everything beats Ace because Ace is zero King is 12 if we want the ace to be the highest card want it to have kind of trump everything we can simp simply move that value up here now Ace is the biggest card and two is the smallest card so simply by doing that now Ace beats everything all right so there you have it that's our completed war card game application let me just run it again and I hope you guys learned a lot I hope you had fun building this project with me if you did please share your results on Twitter and spread the word share these free lessons with anyone you know who is interested with the work hard game and if you enjoyed this project chances are you will probably enjoy the course I'm offering as well uh where we're going to build multiple apps together each one with varying or increasing complexity uh to build upon the skills that you learned with this project so take a look at that too if you're interested thanks for learning with me I really appreciate it and I'll see you guys next time bye for now
