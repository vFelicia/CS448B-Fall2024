hello welcome to learn Swift for beginners lesson 16 today you're going to learn about how to manage a collection of data in what's called an array if you're working with many pieces of data it would be hard to manage them with simply constants and variables so let's take a look at how a race can make our life easier alright let's get started now arrays are one of three collection types that are available in the Swift programming language for us to use and manage our data in this language guide you can see a diagram of this array on the far left side we're going to come back to this diagram in a second but first a definition so you can think of an array as a collection of data that is ordered by indexes now if that doesn't tell you too much let's jump right into a swift playground and I'll show you exactly how beneficial they are and also had to clear them and how to use them so first I'm going to delete this default variable here and we're going to create a couple of variables ourselves so let's say VAR a equals dog VAR b equals can't or C equals bird and now let's say I wanted to concatenate or add the word my in front of each of those values there so that I would have my dog my cat and my bird so I would have to do something like this I would have to go a equals my space plus a and this would result in a being my dog because we're adding the word mine with a space to a and a is dog and then we're reassigning that result into a again thereby overriding what was there before so now a is actually my dog I would have to repeat this for cat and I'd have to repeat this with Birk I can't even use what we learn in the previous lessons in regards to loops to make my life easier I'd have to write this three times for each of the variables so here's the perfect chance to use an array to organize this collection of data so in order to create an array with the data already in it we're going to open up two angle brackets or square brackets if you'd prefer and inside these two square brackets we put each piece of data separated by a comma so we have dog we have cat and we have bird so just like that we have an array with three pieces of data and if you remember what I said in the definition that arrays are a collection of data organized by indexes what do I mean by that well you can see that there are three pieces of data here so there's three distinct spots you can think of it the leftmost spot here the beginning is index 0 or spot 0 if you'd prefer to think of it like that the next one is index 1 and the last one is index 2 so arrays start at 0 and because there are 3 items here the indexes go from 0 1 to 2 and now if I quickly bring up that language guide again you can see in this diagram that in this array there are 5 items and so the index is 4 6 eggs is 0 index for milk is 1 and so on until it which is 4 even though there are 5 items because it's zerobased ok so let's go back down here so this is great that we haven't know right here but we need some way to reference that array so actually what we do is we can create a variable let's call it D and we assigned this array or this collection of data into the variable D so now if I wanted to access dog for example I would write D and then I would write square brackets like that and in between the square brackets I would put an integer representing the index of the item that I want so let's say I want dog I would put 0 so you can see here I would get dog right and so we can print that out and that would print dog down here if I change the index to one then I would get cat instead now let's do an example where we have something like this just to duplicate that I would say let's say a equals my plus D 0 that I can do B equals my that's my cat and finally I would get my bird but then I mentioned that there was a better way to do it if we leverage what we learned in the previous lesson on loops well we can let's take a look at using for loops and simplifying our work here so remember for loops will loop a piece of code for a specified number of times and you can see here that I'm working with index 0 and x1 index 2 so this becomes really easy I can say for remember the next the next piece of the for loop is a counter so no it's my variable to hold the current index and then you write in and then you write your range so I can write 0 0 sorry I mean 0 2 and this is going to loop from 0 to 2 so I think you can kind of see where I'm getting at what I'm going to do is print my plus D and inside here where I put the index usually I'm going to put counter and you can see here took the playground a little second but that's exactly what I expected to do here so in the first iteration of this for loop counter is 0 right that's the starting range so 0 gets past the knee here and I would get this printed out this is dog D at index 0 right is dog in the next iteration of the loop counter is 1 and so I'm actually accessing index 1 of my array so that's why I get cat and then finally it loops again and counters and I would access this bird index here I want to show you another way to use your for loop with an array and that's simply to say for item in D so what this is going to do is it's going to loop through all of the items in the array D and in each iteration of the loop it's going to take that item or that piece of data and it's going to assign it to item so I can simply go like this so you can see that it gets printed out again right in the first iteration item is dog in the second iteration it's cat and the third it's bird so this is pretty simple way to write it and you can see that it saves a lot of work from doing it kind of one by one like this and one by one like this arrays in conjunction with loops really powerful stuff now with a race there's other cool things you can do let me just make some space here maybe I should delete this stuff you can actually declare an empty array so it's an array that would contain no data at first and the way you do that is just like storing things into a variable or a constant arrays can only store data of a certain data type that you specify so since it's an empty array how you would do it is you open up two square brackets you put the data type inside the two square brackets and that data type represents the type of the data that the array is going to store so I'm just going to put string here and then you end off with two round brackets like that and just like that now e refers to an array that is empty right now doesn't contain any data we the intention of storing string type data in this array now if you're going to create an empty array like this you better be able to add data to that array right so what makes arrays really useful is that you can add and remove data from that collection so I can add or remove from this collection right here I can add or remove from this collection here let me just show you how to do that there are a couple of different ways I can do something like this D plus equals to angle brackets like that again and let's say I wanted to add malleus and now my D array would contain four items as you can see here dog cat bird and mouse in fact I can even add two pieces of data at once comma and then here I can put a lull for example so it would add mouse and owl to that array so now my array has five items from zero to four right starts at zero one two three four make sure that you don't forget that plus sign right here because if you do that then essentially you're creating a brand new array with these two items and you're assigning it to D and you've just lost this data here so plus equal is for adding items now seeing this plus equals you might be tempted to use minus equals to remove items like this but that actually doesn't work unfortunately you can't remove items from the array like that what you have to do is the array actually has functions that you can call on it to remove items so you would say D and then you would press dot on your keyboard or the period key and out pops a list of functions that you can call on this array and using the append function is going to do exactly like this plus equal is it's going to add items into that array but let's look at the remove function so you have remove all which is going to remove all the items in our array but you can use this one here remove at and you can specify the index of the item you want to remove so if I put zero like that that's going to remove dog from my array so now it's only going to contain cat bird mouse and owl now what if I don't want to completely remove dog but I just wanted to change that element right there at index zero so let me get rid of this removed line you saw that you can access items in the array by doing that right putting in the index here well you can actually change the item you can change what is assigned at that index by typing d square brackets put in the index you want to change and using the equal sign to assign something new into that spot so here let's say turtle and that is going to now change your array if I print d 0 i'm going to get turtle instead of dog because i just changed it up here the last thing i want to point out is that arrays also you can check how many items are in there if you look at the count that's going to return the number of items in your rate that is sometimes useful when you want to use a for loop with a range and you don't know how many items are in the array you can use this array dot count and get this number here but just keep in mind that although D has five items right here the index of the last item is actually only four because the first item is zero it goes from zero one two three four right even though there are five items so just keep that in mind if you're going to use this array dot count in conjunction with a for loop or something like that okay so that's where we're going to end with arrays as you can see when you type array dot there are a lot of different functions with arrays that you can do what I've covered here in this lesson is enough for you to use a rate and leverage some of the main benefits of a race as we go on and we're building apps together you're going to be learning new ways to use a race but for now these are the main things you need to know about a race in order to start using them if you like this video please
