in this lesson we'll learn how to animate between two screens and figma using smart animate hello and welcome back for another video so in our previous lesson we recreated spotify's media player so to pick up where we left off we'll recreate the lyric screen and from there we'll learn how to animate between the media player and the expanded lyric screen that will design later on so this is going to be a very fun lesson so let's get started so to give you a little bit of information and background about our smart animate works in sigma you need to have two or more different states so that can be two screens two frames and so on basically you need to have a starting point and an end point so if we duplicate our frame here and change the position of this element to the center just like that and change its size if we enable the smart animate transition here so just drag this circle to the screen 4 and make sure smart animate is selected basically once we do this um figma will automatically calculate the difference between the two states as well as automatically create a smooth transition between these two for you so now here's the catch smart animate emulates um css transitions one to one so it's very important that the layering and the naming of your elements are the same across multiple frames or multiple screens so as you can see screen 1 is named circle basically all this our name circle just like that all elements are named circle however screen 2 is spelled incorrectly as you can see it's criclcle so we won't change that but i'm going to give you an example as to why this won't work so if we play select play so this is screen 1 and when we press screen 2 the transition is not seamless however if we go to screen 3 and screen 4 you can see that the transition is very seamless it's very smooth and there's some sort of logic between this screen 3 to screen 4. so like i said the reason why this flow 1 this screen 1 screen 2 doesn't have a smooth transition is because screen 2 is misspelled the element here is misspelled so because of this figma won't be able to calculate properly the difference between circle and this element that's spelled incorrectly so take note that when you are applying smart animate for your um designs you need to make sure that the structure and the naming of your elements are exactly the same so to remedy this you just need to make sure that to duplicate the screen and not recreate another screen from scratch because if you recreate another screen from scratch you are running the risk of not being able to smart animate properly so that's one thing to take note of so with that out of the way let's proceed to creating the design for this expanded lyric section so let's just duplicate this and let's remove and we'll use this as the reference material so let's just remove this image for now group one let's remove this let's just drag it here so we'll see we'll use this as reference from here we'll just delete this oops we won't delete this by the way and we'll just adjust the properties so so for the image we'll resize it to something smaller maybe 20 or maybe 50 and then we'll adjust the stroke to maybe 5 or even 2 something like that so that's enough and we'll remove this header as well and sunday morning maroon 5 let's remove this and just drag it here and adjust the properties to something like that so we just adjust the properties of this text as well so 18 let's make it 14 and this one will be 12 or even 11 and we'll adjust the spacing between these two or yeah i think they're already good they're already zero so we'll just change the um to packed and then let's just adjust the padding to 100 or something like that and 20 or that's good let's just keep this because we still have the pause button so let's remove the shuffle so let's just click this icon and then click on this icon as well click on the repeat and click on this eye icon as well and same goes for the other elements just like that so we won't be necessarily deleting them from the our layers panel we'll just make them disappear for now and then from there we will remove this as well and this one just like that and let's copy this and just like that and from here let's bring back the shuffle button make it appear like that let's just make it zero so we'll still have the play or rather the pause icon in the middle and the share icon on the side so it's here okay so from there we'll just delete this we'll just resize this lyric's master frame and make it full page but before we do that we need to make sure that this sunday morning text let's uh we won't rename this because it contains the same um layer name from screen one so we won't be renaming anything here to make sure that smart animate works so we'll just make sure that frame three is on the top layer as well as the image one so from there we'll just make sure that this lyrics frame will cover all the screen from top to bottom so let's just adjust it from here let's choose make sure to choose the lyrics frame and from there we'll adjust the size just like that make it snap zoom in if you want to get closer just like that so when in doubt you can just adjust it via here so to make more precise adjustments via the numbers so just like that i think we're all good so from here we'll be adjusting the properties of this text so this will be lyrics master make sure to select frame 16 because this contains this is the frame that contains the text or the lyrics itself so make sure to adjust the um padding tap top padding to maybe 44 or 100 even 200 or something like that or even 164 is a good then from there let's make sure it's 20 or even 40 or 32 that's closer and make sure to make it snap to the right and from here we'll remove this more icon just make it invisible and the lyrics as well basically this on frame 15 will make it disappear just like that so from here we'll also remove the gradient layer because we don't need it anymore and the share icon we don't need it as well let's make sure to make it invisible from there we'll just google sunday morning lyrics again let's just copy this and go back and paste everything else so as you can see we still have a lot of space here and i just realized that we don't have the media player and the scroll bar here and the reason is because it's in the bottom it's behind this frame layer so we need to make sure to put them on the front or on top so let's just find it so press on this frame and it's named as frame four and this one is named frame six so we'll look for frame four and frame six on our screen to frame and make sure to select them both by holding on command or control then once you've selected them both make sure to hold command option and right bracket and then from there they will just show up just like that now we have our media player so just make sure to adjust the properties of this um scroll bar so we'll just change this to maybe something lighter just like that maybe 50 and cool that's all good and i think we also need to look for frame five which contains our timestamps so look for frame five under screen two this is it as you can see it's highlighted here so press command option right bracket as well you can see it just pop up just like that and put it right below this scroll bar just like that make sure it snaps and change the um color of this as well to something that's similar so this is e9e9e9 let's just copy paste that color property make sure it's the same just like that oh double check so these three stacks on top of each other perfectly so that's all good and let's just make sure that this will snap just like that as well and from here we still have enough space here so let's just remove this by dragging up the canvas or the frame and also the home indicator needs to be on top as well so we can see that and also this status bar that just like that so we can have a better scale or understanding of our ui so from here um let's just select them all option l hold suck them all and just make sure that this will snap right here so from here we also have enough space on the top so let's just select this too and drag it make sure just make sure to that it will snap on this um status bar area and from here we also still have enough space and as you can see our frame bounding box isn't properly covering our text to do that just click on this resize to fit and just like that it's now showing properly so let's just resize it as well and just like that that's our lyrics master so let's adjust this um frame 16 make sure we can adjust this further maybe 120 oops 120 and that's all good 132. all right that's all good i think that's about it we just need to have the x icon so let's look for icons eight or your icons plugin of choice i'll look for the close icon in ios not go as close so from here we'll just change the color to something like set major to choose selection colors something white and then just drag it here and resize it to maybe 24 our usual sizes or maybe 32 or even 44. yeah that's good so it's not the same as the spotify ui i think this is a proprietary or this is a custom icon that spotify itself designed so we don't have that in our plugin so it's okay this is the best thing that we can find so just like that just drag it here maybe make sure that it will be inside the frame 3 or not because it's not in this as you can see right here it's not in the same box or same row so it's okay if it's just above sitting above this frame so if we close this and click on screen two you can see mac os close oops mac os close is sitting will be sitting on the top just like that all right that's good so let's double check on our um frames icons so from here our expanded lyric section is done so next thing to do is to make sure to enable smart animate so let's click on prototype on the right side so you can choose whichever element but i think i'd prefer this one either the lyrics or the more so let's choose the lyrics here make sure that the lyrics section is selected and then drag this circle and the arrow to here to the next frame make sure smart animate is enabled and ease out or maybe even ease in from there all we need to do is press play and as you can see right here is our screen one and if we click lyrics just like that our lyrics expanded beautifully expanded seamlessly so let's go back to our canvas so if you click x and click here and drag it here it will go back to our media player basically that's basically closing our lyric expanded lyric section so this will be ease in this will be this should be ease out and this will be ease in all right so let's read this prototype again so click on screen one click on play so let's scroll down and click on lyrics and that's a beautiful transition very seamless and then let's click with our new animation let's click close or the x and just like that so let's do it again and this one it's a very seamless beautiful transition and yeah that's all done with smart animate on figma so remember when using smart animate duplicate the screen and don't try to like recreate everything from scratch because that will just mess up how smart animate works alright so that's our two part lesson on recreating and animating this spotify ui all in figma so this is just the tip of the iceberg on when it comes to learning figmas prototyping and animation features so if you are interested to know more about it make sure to stay tuned for future lessons in the meantime i hope the past two lessons have inspired you to explore figma on your own and recreate apps that you like for practice figma is a very beginnerfriendly tool and we highly recommend using it when learning how to design uis so as usual the resource file for this lesson is in the description if you want to further study the design file yourself and if you have any questions feel free to post in the code group forum and i'll be happy to help again make sure to keep on practicing your design and figma skills because i know i will and it would mean a lot if you would too with those things said i hope you learned something and i'll see you in the next lesson
