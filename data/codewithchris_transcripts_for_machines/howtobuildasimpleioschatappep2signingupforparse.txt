hello in this lesson we're going to go through some of the features of the parse platform as well as sign up for our parse account so I'm on parse dog comma I just clicked into the products section I talked a little bit about what we're going to be using which is this thing called parse core and if you click into that you can see some of the cool things you can do with it so this feature save data in the cloud is primarily the reason we're going to be using it in this demo but if you keep scrolling down there are some other cool things you can do with par score you can make your app social so you can log in via social networks with just a couple lines of code and I've had a chance to use this one as well local data store which is really cool so if your app doesn't have a connection and it can't save data into the parse cloud it can store that data locally and furthermore some data doesn't need to be stored on the cloud so you can store it locally within the app they have this feature where you can have a web presence for your app creating a landing page but I haven't used that one before and if you need to create serverside code may be some sort of processing logic before putting the data into the database you can do that using the parse JavaScript SDK to write that serverside code and then furthermore this is getting into stuff that I haven't used before background jobs you can schedule things to happen so it says here whether that's sending emails or updating data or doing some maybe even running serverside logic and this is what makes it also useful there's a parse dashboard where you can create your table schema but they don't call it a table it's the concept of Records but you can view all of your data in here your analytics and stuff like that through this easytouse dashboard which we'll see in a couple lessons later and lastly like I mentioned before one of the benefits using a platform like parse is that this is all they do is to be the best at being a backend for your app so if your app takes off and gets really popular you don't have to worry about adding servers or making sure that your data is replicated across them and doing load balancing you know and all that sort of stuff that comes with managing it on your own it's very easy to scale up or down and you only get charged for what you use but they have a very generous free tier so you probably won't have to pay for a while unless your app really gets popular and lastly the reason why we're doing this is so that we can share data between different platforms right and across different devices so unlike using cloud kit which is iOS only using parse allows us to say we built an Android app it can also use the same parse backend instance that is shared with the iOS side okay and what we've gone through now is just par score there's two other modules that we can look at is parse analytics and parse push but I think that's good for now what I want you to do is go up into the upper right hand corner and click sign up and register for an account you can simply register an account using an email and a password or you can log in with one of your social accounts so once you do you'll be brought to a page kind of like this where you have a dashboard and here are just some of the sample apps that I've created to play around with parse but what we are going to want to do is to create a brand new app up here so we could name this let's name it chat app and click create and then it's created so that's really it you've just created a parse backend instance for your app in the following lessons I'll show you guys how to integrate the parse SDK into your Xcode project so that you can start connecting to this backend instance and start saving and retrieving data all right I'll see you guys in the next lesson
