hey guys welcome to this new series to build a dice roll application in xcode 5 and iOS 7 now some of you guys might still be using xcode 4 and you'll be building for iOS 6 but that's not a problem at all you'll still be able to follow along and at any point and there's very few points uh where it's going to differ I'm going to tell you exactly how it's going to look in xcode 4 and what the difference is so feel free to follow along I have total confidence that even if you're using xcode 4 you'll still be able to build the dice roll application so let me give you a quick demo of what it's going to look like so I'm going to launch it right here and we're just literally going to click a button and it's going to randomize two numbers and the label at the top changes and this demo is really building off of the skills that you learned in lessons 1 to9 in the basics series so if you haven't gone through that uh and you're a total beginner I would recommend that you do those videos first and then do this out if you're a season programmer or you've seen and worked with some iOS then feel free to jump in with the dice roll application all right let's get started okay so what we're looking at here is the new project window of xcode 5 and what we want to select is a single View application now in this screen if you're running xcode 4 you're going to see a couple of more check boxes here and the check boxes that you'll want to have checked on if you're running xcode 4 is use storyboards and use automatic reference counting so make sure those two are checked on other than that the rest are the same so I'm going to call my product a dice roll app and save it somewhere and it's going to create this basic application for us and just to review it's starts off with app delegate and we've got a view controller and we've got a storyboard now if you went through the basics series then you should uh be familiar with the setup already now in xcode 5 we have this image or asset catalog and you won't have this with xcode 4 but what you're going to be doing instead is just adding the images and I'll let you know when we get to it so I just wanted to remind you guys of the app flow the entry point is the app delegate and Then followed by The View controller which manages the view that you specify in the storyboard okay we're going to start by adding some image assets to our project now click on The annotation on the screen or in the link in the description below to go to my website and download a zip file with all of the image assets that we're going to be using now when you get to that page on my site you're going to have to create a free code with Chris account and then you'll be able to download the image assets from that very same page so go ahead and do that now and then once you've got those images come back okay I'm going to assume that you guys have downloaded the zip file of the image assets and have unzipped it into a folder so if you're using xcode 5 um what you can do is open up the asset library and then right click here and choose import and then you can import all of these images into your project like this now if you're using xcode 4 then you you won't have the asset catalog but what you can do is just drag all of the files into your project like this and you can copy the items into your project folder if needed you can choose this option here and click finish and you'll have the images into your project as well so since we're using X Cod 5 here I'm just going to delete this that was just for the purposes of showing you guys for the xcode 4 viewers okay so now the second thing we're going to do is go to the storyboard and this is our view so let's run the application right now and I'll show you guys that that's exactly what we have there you go and actually I want to be using the iPhone uh 4 in so you can just change the simulator that you're using from this menu up here I'm going to select the 4 in I'm going to stop it I'm going to rerun it and then okay I'm going to stop that right now and similarly in uh storyboard you there's this button here that you can click to apply 3.5 in form factor or the 4 in I hope hope that was pretty easy to follow along and I appreciate you guys watching please share it with any of your friends or colleagues who are interested in iPhone development and help me spread the word and as usual the notes are in the description below as well as the link to the source code and the image assets thanks for watching byebye
