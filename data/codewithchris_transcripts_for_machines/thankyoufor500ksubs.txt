hey code crew it's chris here it's been a long time since i've recorded a video like this but we've recently crossed the 500 000 subscriber mark and i want to thank you for all of the support that you've shown us for the eight or nine years that we've been on youtube it's really really incredible i couldn't have imagined that we'd get to this point today you know it all started like this just making videos now in recent months i hope you've learned a lot from our guest trainers over the years i've been so fortunate to make friends and i'm so happy that they were all willing to lend a helping hand stuart flo michaela jc and all of the other trainers that have appeared on our channel i respect you guys so much and thank you so much for appearing on the channel now if you guys want to see more from them i'll put the links to their channels in the description below i hope you learned a thing or two from them so the question is while they were teaching where was i and what was i doing well i was working behind the scenes doing things like business development content planning trying to set up partnerships and in general just trying to grow the business and the truth is i don't really know what i'm doing i'm just learning things as i go along i didn't go to school for business so just trying a whole bunch of different things and over the past eight or nine years this is how code with chris grew i would try a lot of things uh you know 99 of it wouldn't work but sometimes every now and then one thing would really hit and it would help grow code with chris just a little bit and um over the years that that little incremental progress got us to where we are today now i'm happy to say that despite just shooting in the dark like this we have done better each year compared to the previous year except for some of those early years but um all of this growth over the last eight or nine years have been thanks to you so thank you so much for all of the support that you've shown us so at this point we've grown a team to run the daytoday code with chris engine and really the last thing for me to do is to remove myself from the training role and that way i can focus 100 on steering the ship but before i tell you what i've decided to do let me give you some background information and some context you see spending all of this time learning business and marketing has really taken me away from the code and i still think i can do a pretty standup job of teaching the fundamentals of ios app development or else i don't think that we would still be here however if you put me into a room of fulltime ios developers well i don't think i would feel very comfortable the sad thing is when i think about that it actually it makes me sad because i really like coding it's just that i haven't done it for quite a while at least at a fulltime capacity or you know at a capacity where i can feel confidently calling myself an ios developer now feeling the way that i do there are two very specific memories that come up for me one of them is when i was an intern at a consulting company and my supervisor was a software architect but i was pretty much a powerpoint monkey uh preparing decks and sometimes ordering catering for their exact meetings i know that's a weird combination of duties right but anyways there was one specific time that's really clear in my head he said one of the things that he misses the most is just sitting down and coding because he can't do that anymore as a software architect i guess he spends a lot of times designing systems and software instead and then the team goes and builds the software the second memory is when i graduated and started working full time and at that fulltime job again my mentor was a lead architect i know lucky me right but he told me again one of the things that he misses the most is being able to put on a pair of headphones sit down and code and have nobody bug him or look for him and you know what i can really relate to that because when you're in the zone and you're coding that's some of the best time like time just flies and you're having you you end up having a lot of fun and one more bonus example just to hammer the point home my friend works at google and he's been working there since 2007 when we graduated together and he tells me that these days he doesn't touch code anymore he's just managing teams and he's doing important stuff that doesn't involve coding so all of these examples basically say that in order to move up in your career or to grow you end up moving away from the code all right so it feels very natural for me for code with chris for me to start moving away from the code as i have and now to the point where maybe i will i am you know pretty much removed from it to be honest it doesn't feel right i really had to stop and think about it and try to put my finger on why i was feeling this way so i started asking myself questions like why do i want to grow the business what would it feel like to have you know a ton of people working here would i be really stressed out would i feel eager to wake up every morning or would i dread it and that led me to i think the the bottom line like the most important question is what do i want to spend my day doing like what do i enjoy doing i think the answer is clear it's coding it's sharing my knowledge it's interacting with you guys you know those very elements that came together to form this youtube channel nine years ago and i'm so fortunate you know i recognize that that i can be in a position to make this decision that you know i want to spend my days doing this and this can be my fulltime job and i totally recognize that and i'm so thankful for you guys for your support that allows me to do this because not only are you supporting me and making this a fulltime job for me but also you're supporting a team now because we have a bunch of people working together to you know produce the content and release it and do the social media and newsletter and all of those different aspects so really on behalf of the entire team you have our sincere gratitude and appreciation so really this video was to thank you guys for your support for 500 000 subscribers this huge milestone for our youtube channel and for the business and also to tell you that it um it gave me pause and gave me a chance to reflect on you know how the business has grown and what do i want to optimize for right and i want to optimize for daytoday fulfillment rather than trying to grow the business for the sake of growing the business so thank you for giving me that moment right um and thank you for listening to me ramble and i'll see you guys in the next video you
