hi welcome to lesson two in this video you're going to learn how to build your apps user interface and that's just the technical term for the screen that the user sees you'll learn about Auto layout that's used to position and size elements by the end of this video you'll have built this user interface as you can see you're going to learn how to add images text and how to position them more importantly you're going to be doing it with Auto layout constraints and you're going to learn how to do it in a way that's going to make it work for all screen sizes so we're just going to start a brand new Xcode project just like we did in the previous lesson make sure you're looking under this iOS tab and that you've got single View app selected let's click Next and then in the product name I'm going to say app two and the rest of the properties should already be filled out from the project you created from the last lesson we don't need to change any of that let's click Next and then we are just going to save it on the desktop we're going to jump right into the main dot storyboard here because we're going to start customizing our view in the lower right hand corner do you remember that what this is called this is the library pane and we're going to be looking at this tab the object library this is where we are going to be able to select some elements to add into our view so in this filter text box I'm going to type in image view because this is the element we're going to use to display images in our screen so let's click and drag and then drop that into our view unfortunately right now we don't have any images to show in that image view we have to actually add those images into our Xcode project so if you look in the file navigator here on the left hand side right underneath the main that storyboard you'll see this assets thought EXCI assets if you click that it's going to bring you to a section where we store the images that we use for our project as expected there's nothing right here and in fact there's even an entry for the app icon but there are no image assets here so what we're going to want to do is add some images in here for us to use and if you check the description below this video I've got a link to the image that we're going to use in this project it's called less than two assets dot zip so just click that link right now download that zip file and put it on your desktop and then I want you to go ahead and unzip that file I'm going to double click the zip file and it's going to unpack it and out pops an image this is the image we're going to use so all you have to do is click this image and drag it into your Xcode project and you should have highlighted the asset sexy assets so you can drag it directly into this asset library you can either put it in this panel or this panel it really doesn't matter but when you let go of your mouse button you're going to have this image in your Xcode project now what we're gonna want to do is actually rename this asset and I'm going to click it and wait about a second it's going to open up a text box for us to rename it put landscape in there alternatively you can actually highlight it and just hit enter on your keyboard and that allows you to rename it as well so right now you should be looking at your assets without EXCI assets you should have this landscape entry and you should see this image here let's go back to main storyboard and now in this image view just highlight it in the document outline and right here in the inspector pane we're looking at the attributes inspector at the very top there is this image property pull the drop down down and you're going to see that image asset which we added so just click that and then immediately you're going to see your image view display that image now we're going to want this guy to be full screen so we're going to need to set some constraints for this uiimageview but first I want to show you something called the safe area in this document outline if you go ahead and click that you're going to see a portion of your view highlighted in blue and this is what is known as the safe area you can see this little bar at the top in white that's not part of the safe area and the safe area is just a space where you can be guaranteed that the stuff you add won't be obstructed so as you can tell up here this is where the status bar for the phone is all right you see your time you see the carrier you see you know a bunch of icons and stuff like that so it's just warning you you know if you highlight the safe area that the area highlighted in blue is an area where your elements won't get obstructed now that doesn't mean that you can't put anything up here I mean we can go ahead and stretch that image all the way to the very top we just have to understand that there may be some text overlaying that like the carrier the time the symbols and such so this is going to come into play because when we add Auto layout constraints we can specify do we want that constraint like for instance if we're specifying a top margin for this element do we want that to be zero from the safe area or do we want it to be zero from the very edge of the screen all right so I'm going to show you that right now we're gonna highlight the uiimageview and then we're going to go down here to the bottom right and we're gonna click this add new constraints button and this menu pops up it's going to allow us to add some margin constraints for our uiimageview you can see four text boxes here one on each side and each of these text boxes represents the margin that we want to set for that uiimageview right here there are some default numbers and these numbers are just the current values if we wanted to have the UI image view look like this so you can see 235 here right now this length right here is 235 so we're gonna go ahead and change this to zero oh and I should mention that the values you see here will be different because when you drag that uiimageview into the view you'll probably have dropped it in a different place than I have so where I dropped it into the view these are the current margins so I've set this to 1 to 0 you can see that this constraint is active or I'm about to add it because this red line is highlighted now the other three margin lines are blanked out and down here you can see add one constraint if I change the number it kind of automatically activates that constraint and you can see down here it says add to constraints now if I click this button right now it's going to add this top constraint and this left constraint now I can actually click that and turn it on or off right now I'm not adding any constraints and right now I'm adding two constraints another thing I want to mention is this little triangle here these aren't actually text boxes they're actually dropdowns so if I click this you're going to see the safe area and the view this is what I was mentioning before do we want it to be zero margin from the safe area or from the view so I'm actually gonna change this to the view like that and be careful because it changes back to 235 when I select that so I'm gonna go ahead and hit 0 again so even for these ones I'm going to change it from safe area to the view to make sure it's actually to the very edge of the screen this one again change it to the vo and this one down here I'm going to change it to the view and then I'm going to set all of these to zero so a fast way to jump through the different text boxes is if you just press tab like that and then lastly we're going to uncheck constrain 2 margins because we want it to be to the very edge and not toward some margin and then down here it should say add 4 constraints so click that and immediately you're gonna see that uiimageview stretch to all 4 edges now it doesn't go all the way to the top I'm gonna double check what we added there if you look in the document outline you'll see that now you have this entry called constraints if we expand that you can see the four constraints which we added and clicking each of them you can look in the inspector pane on the right hand side and you can look at some configurable properties for it so let's take a look at the top one landscape top equals so somehow even though I set it to the view somehow it's changed itself back to the safe area so what we can do actually before I do that let me explain to you what this means so this constraint is saying to make the landscape landscape is our image view right the top edge of our image view equal to the top edge of the safe area right and zero this is what we specified but I don't want it to be zero from the safe area I actually want it to be zero from the view up here so I'm gonna pull this drop down down and I'm going to choose super view and super view is just a term to describe the view that contains our UI image view so let's click on super view and then you can see that this constant has changed to 20 and you can see that there is this bar here this constraint is indicating that my UI image view is now 20 from the super view top well I'm going to change that back to zero hit enter and now you can see that it's actually zero from the very very top instead of the safe area so I've just showed you that you can click on a constraint and you can edit it from this inspector panel now I want to show you that you can actually just remove them so if you make a mistake go ahead into this document outline right here you can hold down command or shift and you can click each of them like this and then just go ahead and hit delete on your keyboard if we do that this image view it looks like it's positioned correctly but in reality there are no constraints dictating how it should be positioned or sized so that's going to be a problem we've just deleted all of our constraints as extra practice we're gonna just riad them so let's click on the landscape right here this UI image view that is now named landscape I mean and then go down here to the bottom right and go to add new constraints and we're gonna do this again so first of all it looks like this one is safe area so I'm going to choose view this one safe here I'm going to select view instead this one I'm gonna select view this one is view ok and it's double check that it hasn't changed on me again and let's click add for constraints so there we go we have four again all right the next thing is that this image actually looks kind of stretched and looks distorted right if we highlight the image view here and go into the inspector panel there is a property called content mode and this dictates how the image should be stretched or if it should not be stretched right now it's set to scale to fill which means it's just going to stretch it however it needs to in order to fill up the whole image view for instance we can set it to just center and it's just not going to stretch it and there's actually a lot of overlap that you can't see right now or we can set it to aspect fit it's just going to try and fit the entire image without stretching it or we can set it at the aspect Phil it's going to enlarge it so that it fills the entire image view but it's not going to distort it because it's going to maintain the same height and width ratio so that won't look squished or stretched or anything like that so that's the one we're going to choose so then we get something that looks like this alright now we have to add our labels but we can't just add our labels here because that text is going to be pretty hard to read so we're going to create a little bit of a black background here so that we can put our labels on top of it and then it'll be easier to read so down here in the object library let's change this filter text instead of image view let's type in UI view when you do that you're going to see this element here that says view so this is kind of like a generic view that we can color and we can put things in we're going to go ahead and click that and drag that onto our screen just like that and having it highlighted in this document outline I'm going to go over to the inspector pane we're gonna change the background color so go ahead hit this drop down and choose black color and then you're going to click this little black rectangle here that's going to bring up this little menu with a couple of tabs if you choose this tab here it's gonna be all blocked but you can slide this opacity and you can make it semi opaque like that and I'm going to set to about 80% you can also just type it into this text box here and then we're going to go ahead and click that red X to close it and you can see that we have this beautiful sort of semitransparent black which we're going to put our labels on top of but first let's position this uiview so having it highlighted in our document outline I'm going to go over here and click add new constraints I'm going to just off the bat uncheck constrain to margins and I'm going to go ahead and enable the left the right and the bottom constraints and then I'm going to choose veal instead of safe area like that and change that and then I'm going to set these to zero notice that I'm not touching this top constraint and I'll show you why in a second I'm going to be zero there zero I'm gonna do zero let me just double check that it hasn't changed back to the safe area all right and we're gonna click add three constraints this time alright so you you're gonna see a couple of things here first of all it's stretch to the left and right because we added those constraints but now there's this red line here and it's supposed to stick to the bottom because we said it should be zero from the bottom but there's this red line here and over on the document outline you can see this little red arrow here if we click that you're going to see that there are some auto layout errors right here it says that it's missing some constraints it can't determine the Y position or the height so before our bottom constraint is going to take effect we're gonna need to set either a height for this view or a top constraint so that auto layout system has all the information it needs to be able to position that UI view so what we're going to do is highlight this view while holding down the command key click on this root view as well this is kind of like the the overall view that contains everything so okay let me try that again so highlight this view hold down command and then click this root view so you should have both of these highlighted in blue now and now with that I want to go down here add new constraints again and I want you to choose equal Heights and that is going to basically make this block dimmed view the same height as the root view which basically is this entire view right here but we're gonna do a little something special in order to make it dynamic so you're gonna see that in a second but for now make sure you have equal Heights checked on and then click add one constraint then you're gonna see basically the whole thing dimmed out and then a couple more constraints added in this constraints menu you can see that it's starting to get pretty confusing I can't really tell unless I really really try to read it I can't really tell which constraints have to do with the landscape and which constraints have to do with this view right so one easy way to tell if I only care about the constraints for this UI view for instance let's highlight it in the document outline here and then I'm going to go into the size inspector tab and if I scroll down it actually shows me that there are four constraints that relate to this element and like this I can easily tell which constraints that I want to modify so I actually want to modify this one equal height to super view I'm going to double click it well it's automatically going to highlight the constraint that I selected and then it's going to show me it's configurable properties here on the inspector pane so let me read this constraint to you the views height should be equal to the super views height so this is the view and this is the super view remember super view is just a fancy word for the view that contains that element so you can see that if I collapse this view everything is inside of it right so this view actually contains everything inside of it all right so if you have this reversed if you have super view dot height is equal to view dot height I want you to go down here and click on reverse first and second item if I click that you're gonna see super view height equal view height i don't want that i want you to click this reverse first and second item the first item should be view height because that's what you're trying to specify so our rule states that the views height should be equal to the super views height and down here there's a multiplier I want to change this to zero point three when I do that that's saying that the views height should be equal to zero point three times the soup views height and this is going to set the height so that it's about a third or about thirty percent of the entire height and this is going to be dynamic it doesn't matter how tall the root view is it's always going to be thirty percent of that height all right now in the bottom right hand corner let's change this UI view filter text let's type in label because we're about to add some labels and let's click and let's drag this into this block area this UI view when you do that you can see that my label is actually inside of this UI view now because this UI view is actually a container view it can contain other elements and now that my label is inside that view when I specify my auto layout constraints let's say I want it to be zero from the top it's going to be zero from the top of this UI view it's not going to be zero from the top of this route view right because you're always specifying the positioning constraints relative to the parent that contains it alright so since this view contains my label if I position my label zero from the top it's going to be based on the top of this view which is fine that's exactly what I want so let's highlight this label in the document outline let's go into the attributes inspector here first of all let's change the color so we can actually read it we're going to choose white color and let's change the label the city by the sea and don't worry that it's kind of cut off right now we're going to address that and then I'm going to click this little icon here so we can change it to a bold type of font and I'm just going to up the size to something like 24 and then we're going to specify some auto layout constraints for this guy so with this label highlighted I'm going to go down here to add constraints and we are going to let's do those constraints the top the left and the right so for the top I'm going to say 20 from the left I'm going to say 20 and from the right I'm going to say 20 as well and then we're going to click add three constraints and you're going to see something like this we're gonna add a little description label below that so let's click this label and let's pop it into there as well and now you can see in this document outline that my view contains two labels so highlight this second label let's configure some properties so let's change it to white let's change the font and we'll leave it at seventeen and we're gonna set some constraints for this guy so make sure it's highlighted here and then click on add new constraints down here and this time we are going to again we're going to do that but if you pull this drop down down you're going to see that you can position it relative to the label that's directly above it so we're going to choose that we're not going to choose the view so position it relative to the element that's right above it and I'm going to say that it should be ten points below that title label the left will be 20 and the right will be 20 as well and then I'm going to add these three constraints and they see something like that now I'm going to go back to these properties there are a couple things I forgot to set for example I want to type a sentence so this is such a beautiful place and if we wanted to make it multiline all we have to do down here is change that lines by default it's 1 let's change it to 0 and if I typed more text it's going to be multiline but I'm gonna leave it like that for now now that we've created this beautiful layout we're going to preview it in different screen sizes and orientations and the way we do that you might have noticed down here it says view as iPhone 8 if I click this I bring it up you can actually see a whole bunch of different screen sizes and orientations so the one I'm looking at right now is iPhone 8 but you can go up so let's say click this this is the iPhone X sometimes if you don't see this entire view or some if it's blocked out or maybe it's the screen is all white try zooming in and then zooming out to force that view to kind of refresh and redraw itself now let's go up again this is the iPhone 8 plus so you see here I have a white screen I'm just gonna click I'm gonna zoom in so you see now it's just redrawn if you don't have these controls here and maybe that you're maybe on a laptop screen and you can't see this you need to make a little more space click this document outline button to just hide the document outline and you'll probably get your zoom buttons down here all right so let's go downwards now so we were looking at the iPhone 8 that's where we started let's go downwards this is the iPhone se and this is the iPhone 4s now we're going to change the orientation we're going to click on landscape here as you can see that everything's adapted itself because all of our constraints are dynamic and you can see that this still takes up a 30% of the height of the screen we're going to go upwards this is the iPhone se iPhone 8 the iPhone 10 and again part of it is cropped let's go like that so you can see that here it's kind of a little bit almost touching our text label here now if we had specified that the left side of the UI image view and the UI view should be relative to the safe area and not to the very edge then we wouldn't have come into this notch area actually this part right here this part is considered a safe area let me see if I yeah if I click on safe area right here you can see a blue outline you can see that this left edge of the screen this is not in the safe area and you can see that this part is not in the safe area and also this part down here is not in the safe area since we kind of ignored the safe area and we specified our elements the very edges that's why this text is so closely here in order to fix this we might just increase the margin on the left side or something like that all right let's move on let's go to the next device we've got the A+ this white screen let's zoom out zoom in so there you go now one thing I ought to mention is that this area down here lets you preview your layout in multiple screen sizes orientations but it also allows you to add constraints that are specific to a certain screen size and the way you do that is this button here very for constraints if you accidentally click this and then let's say you clicked something like that and then this area became blue then you're actually at this point you're going to be adding constraints that are specific to this right here and you're not actually specifying constraints to be specific to a screen size but there's something called size classes which each size class actually contains a bunch of different screen sizes it's like a category of screen sizes this is something that we'll cover down the line I want to warn you about it right now be just in case this area looks blue for you if it does you have to click on this done varying and chances are the constraints that you added were specific to whatever screen size you accidentally selected so I would at this point advise you after you you click on done varying if you had accidentally clicked it before is to now go ahead and delete all your constraints and kind of redo it and riad it but for most of you if you didn't click this button before and you didn't know about it or you didn't notice it and it's not blue chances are you don't have anything to worry about so now I'm gonna run it in the simulator so I'm gonna go ahead and select the iPhone 8 simulator I'm gonna click run I'm gonna see it launched in our simulator just like that and in order to rotate the device you can go up to hardware you can go down to rotate left or rotate right and as you can see there shortcut keys you can hold down command and press the left arrow or right arrow you can actually even just choose one like this from your orientation if I'm going to use the shortcut keys so on my keyboard let's press command and left you can see that it's just rotated rotate it back rotate it the other way now so there you have it today you learned about Auto layout and what the safe area is you learned how to add edit and delete constraints you also learn how to check your layout under different screen sizes and orientations now how would you like to get some extra practice and build another user interface I've got a worksheet for you to do just that go through it and build this user interface first I've got a question for you for the app that you want to build are you going to be focused on the iPad screen size or the iPhone screen size let me know by leaving a quick comment below if you liked this video please subscribe to my channel by clicking the subscribe button below and if you don't want to miss a single video make sure you click that Bell icon as well lastly don't forget to grab that worksheet and get some extra practice with Auto layout just follow the URL on the screen or click on the URL in the description below the video thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next lesson
