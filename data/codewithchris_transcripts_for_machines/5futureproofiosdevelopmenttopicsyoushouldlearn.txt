if you've ever tried to learn IOS app development you might have found yourself overwhelmed with the number of principles Concepts and Frameworks that you had to learn and on top of that each year Apple introduces new apis and new Frameworks into the mix it's tough to keep up but having said that here are five Timeless iOS development topics that beginners should learn number one the Swift programming language now this is the code that you write to express your app logic such as what should happen when the user Taps on a button on the screen Swift Powers all of Apple's platforms including iOS iPad OS Mac OS watch OS and so on having a basic understanding of Swift is a great start but as you get deeper and you learn more about things like optionals closures protocols generics and that sort of stuff you're going to be able to express your intentions that much better through your app to get started you can read the Swift programming language guide or you can watch our free master class on Swift basics for beginners number two Swift UI y now Swift UI is the code that describes the user interface for your app the Swift UI framework contains user interface components such as buttons toggles sliders but not only that it also contains layout containers and groups that let you describe how these components should be arranged on the screen the great thing about Swift UI is that it's a declarative framework meaning that you don't have to describe where every single element should be placed down to the pixel instead you can describe relative to other elements how you want your user interface components to be arranged and Swift UI will do its best to arrange it in a layout that is the best experience depending on the screen size that the user is on to get started learning Swift UI we have a three hour tutorial on Swift UI basics for beginners number three data flow now after you've got a good handle on Swift and Swift UI the next topic is to learn about how data moves through the screens of your app you might think that you have to write code to manually move data from screen to screen in your app but in a swift UI app it's actually much easier than that by learning about Concepts such as state bindings environment objects and the combined framework you can take advantage of Swift UI and have your views update automatically as the data source changes personally I had to change the way I thought about dataflow when Swift UI came out but I'm really glad that I did number four navigation and view composition after you understand dataflow in a swift UI app it's not a very big leap to start building multiscreened apps Swift UI makes it really easy to arrange the views in your app such as managing them in a tab bar across the bottom of your app or perhaps letting the user drill down into your views using the navigation stack on top of that composing more complex views out of smaller reusable views is very simple as well once you get the hang of managing and composing your use you'll be able to build bigger and more complex apps on our Channel we have a video about navigation in Swift UI go check it out number five Apple's human interface guidelines while Apple releases new apis and Frameworks each year their guidelines for what makes a great user experience and design don't change as often in Apple's human interface guidelines document you'll find best practices for each of their platforms including common design patterns and guidance around things like dark mode and accessibility by understanding the core principles and best practices of what makes an app experience on an Apple device you'll be able to build your app in a way that feels great and looks great even if you don't have a professional designer or if you're not a designer yourself now if you keep these five Timeless iOS development Topics in mind as you embark on your own app Journey you'll be building your skills on a solid foundation that will serve you for years to come to get started check out our three hour iOS development class for beginners you'll find it right here on YouTube in those three hours you'll learn skills in all of these five topics we covered today and you'll have built your very first app thanks for watching and I'll see you there
