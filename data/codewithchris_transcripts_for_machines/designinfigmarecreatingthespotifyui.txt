this lesson is going to be more of an exercise because we will recreate spotify screens from scratch hello and welcome to learning design the course where i share my learnings on becoming a better app designer this exercise is going to be a twopart lesson or two videos the first one which is this video will focus on recreating the media player screen from spotify the second video which will be released two weeks from now will be about recreating the lyric screen and not only that in the second video we'll also learn how to animate between the music player and the lyrics screen as you can see right here so it's pretty exciting right well if that's the case let's start learning design so before we get started you can take a screenshot of any song that you want to recreate in this exercise for me i have sunday morning by maroon 5 because it's one of my favorite songs well you can also download the resource file of this exercise down below if you want to follow along while using the same material so next let's have a quick look at our ui first so we have a lot of buttons icons and as you can see spotify is using quite a different font for the ui so first let's download the right plugins for this exercise which means that you should have your icons plugin in my case i have the icons 8 plugin but any icons plugin that supports ios icons will do also there's a link to the ios 15 ui kit figma file in the description below for you to copy paste a few system elements that we'll be using in this exercise now since we're going to recreate or replicate this as closely as possible we need to use the right font so i mentioned a while ago that they're using a different font for the ui and the font that they're using is circular std so this should already come along with your free figma plan because figma provides you with like a thousand fonts and circular std should be one of them because i know that i don't have circular sad on my desktop but it's available on my figma file so if it doesn't show um you can just google circular std and you can download it for free now for the actual design let's set up our frame or canvas by pressing f and choosing an iphone frame i like to use the iphone 10 frame so we'll choose that for this exercise next let me just resize this um reference image because it's too big it's occupying more than half of our workspace let me just resize this pick it smaller and done next let's choose the right background color and while we're at it let's create some shapes with colors in it so that we can easily access them when we need to use the eyedropper tool now if you look closely the background color of the screen is in a gradient type so the color sort of transitions from medium red to dark red so for our first shape it will be the medium red the second shape will be dark red and our third shape will be the combination of these two in the form of a linear gradient so to do the linear gradient style we just need to click the color settings change this from solid to linear and then we will use the eyedropper tool to apply the medium red and dark red colors to our gradient after that once we have the gradient applied to our third shape right here we will just save this as a style so we can apply it to our background and done we now have an exact duplicate of the apps background next let's design the header now the spotify screen has the downwards chevron the name of the album of the song and a more button for other settings so to do this we just need to open our icons plugin of choice and look for a download chevron and while we're at it why don't we look for other icons as well so we don't have to look for them later on so we have the more icon let's also look for the heart icon shuffle previews pause next repeat share list expand and bluetooth so make sure to organize them properly because we want a clean workspace so let me just organize them accordingly and voila so from here what i always want to do when designing a ui is to copy and paste the status bar and home indicator from the ios 15 ui kit that's available in the figma community so like i said a while ago the link to this ui kit is available in the description so once you're inside the file just look for the status bar and home indicator copy both of them and paste them to your artboard all right so before we put the actual ui elements on this frame let's first create the margins for this ui in my case i'll pull up the grids and columns that i use in our design system so don't worry if you don't have these columns as well because this is just a guide for myself in the future lessons we'll tackle everything you need to know about creating a design system as well so stay tuned for that meanwhile you just need to make sure that your rulers are turned on if they're not just press shift r and from there just click and drag from the left side of the ruler to activate a marginal line so so once you click and drag from the left side of the ruler just drag it to the frame until um it's sort of like 20 pixels from the left and create another one so 20 pixels from the right so this gives our design some breathing space which is essential for ui design now let's design the header by putting the chevron inside the frame before we do that as you can see right here our background color is a bit dark it's a bit dark red and we want to make sure that we have enough contrast for our ui elements so since our background color is dark our ui elements should be in the light side of things so that means our icons should be in white our text should be in white and all those sort of things so in that regard we'll first change the colors of our icons so as you can see right now it's all black so let's first select them all and change them all to white just like that and now we're ready to use them for our design now let's design the header by putting the chevron inside the frame so look for the chevron that we got from our icons plugin drag it inside the frame and done now for the album name let's just type it here the album name is songs about jane etc etc change the font to circular std change the font to medium so let me just put this below the album name of our reference material just so we can gauge how big the font should be so i think maybe it should be size nine so let's change the font size to size nine and then after awards let's just put it back on the frame and let's align the album name with the chevron just make them vertically aligned also don't forget whenever resizing an icon don't forget to lock the proportions because we don't want them to mess up their dimensions and then let's just align them together that looks good let's put the more icon here as well so before we change its size make sure the proportions are locked first and then once that's locked we can change it to maybe around 24 pixels and we're done finally we just need to select all three of them press shift a to convert that into an auto layout make sure that the spacing is set to space between and once you do that we're done let's just make sure that this header is 44 pixels from the status bar to give it enough spacing so to do that we will just quickly create a rectangle that's 44 pixels in height and once you create that 44 pixel tall shape just make sure that the elements snap and done our headers all good now for the next part we are going to create the album art or place the album art on our design so for this one we just need to look for this album art on google because we don't have that saved in our desktop so google search songs about jane look for the highest resolution possible right click to copy the image and paste it to our figma workspace so next let's just resize it to fit inside our margins and add a stroke while we're at it now for the color of the stroke we'll use our handy eyedropper tool and selecting this um pastel color around the album art from our reference material so we can set the stroke thickness to maybe 20 center and we're good to go our album art is done but wait um as you can see the stroke goes beyond the margins that we've set for this ui so a quick fix to this will be to reduce the width of our or reduce the size of our um album art to maybe around um 315 by 315 pixels and see if the outer line of the stroke aligns with the margins left and right and that's done it's that simple so what we're going to do next is to recreate the media settings and of course put the name of the song and the band among other things so let's type in sunday morning and change the fonts properties we'll set the song title to bold and maybe reduce the letter spacing to negative one percent its size to 18. now don't forget to adjust the spacing between the album art and the sunday morning text or the song title so let's make sure that this is around 48 and then let's type in the maroon 5 text by duplicating this um song title and then changing the text to maroon 5 and also we need to change the properties of this text so let's change this to light size 14 and at zero letter spacing and that's good so let's just convert them into auto layout by pressing shift a and done and of course we also need to put that um heart or favorite icon beside these details so but before we put our icon here we first need to press shift a again on our existing auto layout frame and make sure that the direction will be horizontal and from there we can now drop the heart icon in the frame and our heart icon will be placed instantly beside this um song details now from here we just need to make some adjustments on the auto layout frame so we'll adjust the sides on left and right we need to make sure that they will snap the edge of our canvas so not the margins the red lines so we will adjust this on to the edge of our canvas or artboard or our um frame and then adjust the padding from there so make sure that it's 20 on the left and 20 on the right and on the top will be maybe 32 and bottom will be 32 as well so from there we can just snap it right below that um album art and there you go so so that's our song details with the um heart icons so next thing we're going to create is the media slider so just select your line tool or press l and then put it right below the song details that we just designed and then change the color of this line so right now i so right now i'll change the color of design to maybe match our reference material so make it a bit translucent and then i'll adjust the thickness of this line to maybe five and then i'll change the starting and end points of this line to round and then from there we'll adjust the color and transparency and make it a bit transparent to reduce the transparency to maybe 44 and then adjust the thickness to three and then just make sure that the line will snap to our margins on the left and right so it will it should snap on the red lines on the left and right and then from there i'm going to duplicate this and resize the width so maybe change it to around 30 pixels and width and change the color of this um line this duplicated line to maybe around white but not pure white maybe something around um with a tinge of red to make it a bit more modern and then from there i'm going to create a circle so open up your ellipse tool by pressing o and create a circle maybe around 32 by 32 pixels and then from there let's make sure that the circle will be in the same color as the um bright line that we just created and then maybe resize the circle to 16 just make it suitable for the slider and then align them properly so from there we'll type in the timestamps so type in 19 seconds and type in the minus 3 45 minutes and then make sure that they are aligned so this one you can rely on the align bottom and from here i'm gonna convert the slider to frame instead of a normal group because we want to have that flexibility of adjusting their bounding box so i'm going to adjust the bottom padding of the song details we designed a while ago so that the slider will be able to move higher without merging with the frame above it now let's i'm gonna i'm gonna put the timestamps a few pixels up as well so reduce their size and adjust their size to maybe 12 or maybe 10 and adjust the um font weight and the color as well so let me just do some adjustments here and there you go so for this one make sure to select both timestamps and press shift 8 convert that into auto layout and make sure to adjust the left padding to 20 right padding 20 as well and make sure that they are spaced between from there we can adjust the boundaries of this frame of this other layout frame and let them snap to the edges of our ui frame and maybe adjust the bottom padding as well because there will be elements right below it we want to have enough space so we're almost halfway through our media settings so for the second half which are the main media controls um since we organized them already a while ago there's the beauty of organizing stuff what's left for us to do is to drag them into the frame and double check on the sizes make sure that the pause or the middle button is emphasized because it's the main button in this instance and the previous next will be secondary and the shuffle and repeat will be tertiary buttons so let's adjust the size of this let's also adjust the size of the shuffle and repeat buttons so make them smaller and then from there make sure to um align them horizontally so from there we'll convert them into an auto layout frame and for now we'll pack them in the center we'll make some adjustments later on so let's adjust the bounding box of this auto layout frame to the edge of our ui frame and then just let it snap right below that um media slider or the timestamp so from here i'm going to change the properties again of this media controls to space between instead of middle pack in the middle and then i'm going to put 20 for the left and right padding and then what i'm going to do next is to select these three main controls and then press shift a again to convert them into an auto layout so the reason we're doing this is because we want to separate these three main controls from the shuffle button and repeat buttons on the side so so if we don't frame this three buttons then all of the five buttons in this row will have equal space between each other which would lessen the emphasis that we want to have in this role so i'm going to select them and adjust the spacing accordingly to my taste and then we're done for our media controls so next thing i'm going to do is to drag and drop our bluetooth icon to the frame and type in jc's airpods pro so i'm going to change the color of this as well so i'm going to use our eyedropper tool and select the color of the color green from our reference material so that we will have the same color so change this colors as well and from there i'm going to resize the bluetooth icon maybe to um 20 because it's not that important so from here i'm going to select the bluetooth icon in the blue deflex and together i'll convert them into an auto layout frame and then from here um i'll make the necessary adjustments so the spacing between them will be four and then i'll change the font properties to light or maybe something lighter just to deemphasize this booth indicator because it's not that important and then from there i'm going to drag and drop our few remaining icons our share button and our list button right beside that bluetooth indicator so i'm going to resize the share and list icon as well maybe around 20 as well because they are not important on buttons so we want to have that visual hierarchy and then from there i'm going to select the um share and this icon and convert them into an auto layout frame from there once i resize them i'm going to select all of them and i'm going to convert them into auto layout by pressing shift a again and then from there i'm going to adjust the bounding box of this other layout frame and snap them to the sides of our ui and make sure that they are spaced between so let's zoom out a little bit and see our work so far so it's looking great and looking exactly like the spotify ui that we have so we just need to recreate the lyric section but as you can see we don't have enough space down here for the lyric section so we'll need to resize the frame but before we do that we need to first find our home indicator layer on our layers panel and make sure that the constraints will be left and bottom so that so this will make it stay at the bottom whenever we resize the frame so once that's done we can now resize the bottom of the frame by simply dragging it and as you can see the home indicator stays at the bottom because of the constraints that we set earlier now for our lyric section what i'm going to do first is to create a frame press f and make sure that it snaps to the both margins and then from here let's add a color red oops not this red this bright red make sure that it's bright red and also we'll adjust the corner radius of this to maybe four make it a bit similar to the corner radius of this um um lyrics section from our reference material then from there we'll type in the lyrics label like the title of this section and maybe change this to bold resize this to maybe 12 and there you go then let's just reposition this maybe here and then we'll just make some adjustments later on then next thing i want to do is to um create the more button right here so type in more um bold i think bold is okay or medium i think bold is but much better let's just make it a bit smaller so size 10 i guess or size 9 or maybe size 10 is okay then from here we don't have i think we deleted we accidentally deleted the expand icon so we'll look for it again in the icons eight plugin and there you go so from there we'll just resize this or first change its color to white and then resize this to maybe 16 or even 12. let's make it a bit smaller because it's um a secondary button so from here make sure to select both of them so the more and the enlarged icon so press shift a then from there make sure that they are um packed in the middle and the spacing will be 12 on the sides and four on top and bottom so we can tweak this later on so maybe we can remove um we can apply some color first this medium red and then from here we'll change the corner radius to 50 and that's good so i think that's a lot closer to our reference image and then from here let's select the lyrics and this more button and press shift a and this converts into an auto layout header so from here make some changes so spacing will be space between and the left padding will be 12 12 and um i think we can keep it to zero or maybe um 16 or maybe 12 here and then 16 at the bottom yeah that's right maybe 20. and from there we'll adjust the um size of this other layout frame make sure it snaps to the edge of this um lyrics frame just resize it and that's good and from here we don't have the um lyrics so let's just look for let's just google sunday morning lyrics and then just copy paste half of this um lyrics because we can just delete this later on so copy it and then paste it here and as you can see we already have it formatted in the right setting i will just change the alignment to left align and then maybe size will be 13 or maybe 20 and then change the letter spacing to maybe 100 oops to zero percent or 120 and then just make sure that this will be in an auto layout frame again so press shift a make sure that it will snap on the edges of this frame make sure that it will snap right below this header as well so as you can see the blue box is here it will just snap it right there let's make some adjustments let's make sure that we have enough space for our text so let's remove the percentage let's just change this to 140 or maybe 100 make it more accurate maybe 4 oops maybe 40 40 is good or maybe 35 and that's a lot better and then spacing will be one percent i guess yeah that's good as you can see we have the red spacing on one line for yeah sunday morning we don't we didn't copy this a music icon and it's okay because it's just a program in spotify we didn't have that when we copy pasted it so still some covers sharing skin clouds are shouting us in and next line will be moments are forgettable from here um we'll recreate this share icon so what we're going to do is just duplicate this more icon and command d and just drag it right here so let's just change the text to share and then let's just duplicate this share icon and command d and just drag it away from that frame and just drag it inside this beside the share or maybe right here and just delete this expand icon and resize this to maybe 16 or 12 16 yeah i think that's okay yeah 16 is much better and let's change this spacing four and this one to four as well and there you go so from here as you can see we didn't have enough padding here so let's change this back to zero and then the padding will be let's go to the frame make sure that you're selecting the frame and not the text padding will be 14 14 and let's reduce the letter spacing and go back to our and select the text tool go back and make sure that this is fill container so that it will automatically wrap um inside this um lyrics frame so as you can see we don't have any overlapping elements when we click on them so from here let's just resize this frame by dragging this um line and we can also reposition this frame right below this row maybe select them both and make sure that the spacing between this will be like divisible by four so maybe 24 is good or even 20 is good or even 16. yeah 16 is good from there um let's just resize this frame adjust this here and remove this text let's just cut it to the moment's unforgettable part and from here let's remove this text zero make sure it's a bit closer maybe negative three and then if we can make this a bit larger twenty one um each other one's good so from here as you can see the share is not inside the lyrics frame so if we um check our layers you can see the share frame let's name this to share it's not inside the lyrics frame this is the lyrics frame so we need to put this inside this lyrics frame just drag it inside here and there you go just make sure that it's aligned properly just let this software do the snapping for you because they will tell you if it's aligned or not then from there we can change this uh the color of this button you can just remove it simply and then apply a stroke and maybe white and there you go you can also change the thickness of the stroke to maybe 0.5 and there you have it now we can resize this frame again so our space should be 12 and now we have a 12 we'll use this um rectangle as a guide so it's 12 pixels all so we'll just let it snap and there you go and remove this then from there as you can see we have this um faded text effect so what i'm going to do is to lock this frame first and then create a rectangle make sure it's red and then from there let's just adjust the size properties of this and then check the color settings change this from solid to linear and then you can switch this to end points so this one will be the zero percent setting so this one will be in zero percent and this one will be in full color actually from here all you need to do is just drag it up and make sure that it will cover this moment's unforgettable part all right there you have it so this is just a simple faded text effect but that um we can change we can change later on so we'll make some further changes here so for the lyrics let's lock this rectangle first so we don't um select it accidentally so change this colors to um black or maybe dark red use the eyedropper tool and select this one and there you have it and going back to our faded gradient just put it right here lock this lyrics frame and then adjust the size of this rectangle and then maybe we can change the gradient effect here just make sure that it's a bit closer to the starting point just like that it doesn't have to be perfect but i think it's a lot closer to our reference material so from there let's just frame this again because the gradient effect is now a part of this lyrics frame so this will be lyrics master from here let's just realign this make sure that it snaps to the edges and we are done just some final touches maybe height will be 44 and resize the screen and there you have it that's our spotify ui alright so we've successfully created the first and main screen of our spotify music player for our next lesson we'll quickly go over how to recreate the lyric screen and from there learn how to animate between this music player and the lyric screen so just like what you're seeing right here so if you've encountered some challenges while designing this along the way well don't worry because i shared this figma file as a resource document for this lesson so feel free to download that to study the design yourself or if you have any more questions feel free to post on code google forum and we'll be happy to accommodate your concern so stay tuned for our next lesson which will go live in the next two weeks in the meantime go ahead and practice your design skills by recreating other apps that you like or restudying this lesson so with those things said i hope you learned something and i'll see you in the next video
