in this video you're going to learn how to use the Swift UI chart component which lets you turn data like this into a beautiful chart like this you can use a variety of different chart formats too and it only takes three steps Number One Import the charts framework number two declare a chart component and then lastly Loop through your data set and display each data point using a chart type of your choice now let's dive into xcode and try it out okay so here I've got an xcode project and all I've done so far is set up an initial struct and some dummy data so let's take a look at this struct it's called Sleep data point and it's got two properties one is day which is going to contain a string Monday Tuesday and so on so forth and hours the number of hours slept on that day now I chose this type of data and these two properties just to keep it simple because I think we can all understand the concept of each day and sleep in the view I've got a property called data which is an array of these instances and here I've just spaced it out so it's easy to read so here you can see I've got from Monday to Sunday in a number of hours slept on that day so in the view I've just got a text element let's start by importing the charts framework easy and then let's go into the view we're going to get rid of this and we're going to create a chart component I'm going to open up a pair of curly brackets and in here we're just going to Loop through this data array so let's use a for each we're going to pass in the data and we are going to Loop it through it now for each instance inside that data we are going to decide how we want to show that chart if you get an error like this make sure that your structure conforms to identifiable because we're going to Loop through it let's give it an ID so that it can differentiate between each data point all right so that's going to get rid of that error now there are several options depending on what kind of chart you want to show right now I'll just show you a simple bar chart so we're going to use something called a bar mark here there are also several different initializers you can use I'm going to use this one X Y I'll show you some documentation for what some of the other things are now this takes along the xaxis a plausible value and then on the yaxis the vertical axis also a plottable value so you have to decide based on your data what you want to go across the xaxis and the yaxis so for us let's say we want the days plotted horizontally and the number of hours plotted vertically so what you can do is you can say plottable value Dot and then you can create you can create a value using this so it takes two parameters one is a label so let's call this the day and where does it get its value the value is in the day property right so we're going to use this parameter d and we're going to specify the day so that's going to go along the xaxis now if you don't want to type out so much stuff you can simply hit Dot and choose value and let's along the yaxis let's go hours and the data the actual data is in the hours property right so let's get rid of that let me just space this out so it's a little easier to see all right so it looks something like that and you get this chart just like that so each time it Loops through the data it is creating one of these bar marks now keep in mind this also groups the data as well so let's say that for Monday I had two data points like that and let's say I slept six hours on Monday and then another two hours so you can see that it doesn't add another Monday to the xaxis it actually groups it together and now this is eight you can see the scale goes up to 10 because uh Wednesday was 10. now what we can do let me show you a couple of other things you can do so let's add some padding first of all to make it look just a little bit nicer very quickly I want to say that if you don't want a bar chart you can very easily change this bar Mark to a different type of chart marker and many of them also accept an X and A Y as an initializer so very easily for example I can change bar Mark to point mark you would have kind of like a scatter plot graph you can change it to line Mark you need to get a line graph or perhaps you might want an area graph which is kind of like a line graph just colored underneath and this part right here I think is due to our data right here us having of two pieces of data on Monday I don't think it that plays very nicely with the area chart all right there you go so if you want an area chart perhaps you you don't have that type of data but if you look at the documentation you're going to see there are different types of markers you can use rule Mark and rectangle marker to that we haven't looked at because I think those require a little bit more configuration let's go back to Let's undo so I have that data point again let's go back to the bar chart because I'm going to show you a couple of customizations that you can do to it for example if you want to add a label to it you can add what's called an annotation okay so we are going to add a text element and we are going to specify let's say the number of hours right as a text element and by default it positions it on top right there but notice however on Monday right since we have two segments six and two it's only showing the two and the reason is because that two segment is on top of the six segment and that little chunk is probably covering the sixth label and it's only showing the two labels so if you wanted a total for Monday you would probably have to do some calculations here because by passing in D we are only getting like one sliver or one instance of that sleep data you're going to have to calculate um probably grab all of the Mondays in that data set and add it together to show that total what we can try to do instead is actually change the position of this annotation so there are several parameters let's use overlay and what that does is actually put the number on the segment itself so now you can see that this segment is 6 and that is two but there is no color differentiation so it's kind of hard to see right because Monday actually has two segments in it so if we wanted to draw a distinction between the two segments we need to distinguish them in the data so let's add another dimension to our data right now we only have two Dimensions day and hours right so let's add a third dimension and call it type so this one is a string let's call it the type of sleep it is so nighttime sleep or nap perhaps or something else so by default it's going to be night and let's say for this data point this was actually a nap okay and then in here now you can color the segments depending on the type let's add another modifier to the bar Mark notice that I'm adding these modifiers to the bar Mark and not the chart so let's say that we want to color the foreground style and we want to color it by a certain dimension of the data so again it's plottable value we're going to hit dot value and the label we're going to use type and type is specified by our type property all right so now you can see that it's a different segment Let's uh let's change the foreground color to white and there we go you can see actually a legend has also appeared down here now that there are several colors let's add one more to Monday let's say uh or let's say Friday let's say Friday I had one hour of sleep so I needed to take first of all uh a nap as well as let's say I accidentally fell asleep has that ever happened to you where you're so tired you just fall asleep when you didn't intend to so now we have three different data types right and the legend updates by itself as well now there's a lot of customizations that you can do to charts so far we've been adding these modifiers to the Mark or the segment itself but there are also modifiers that you can apply to the Chart components so for example if you just type in chart autocomplete will show you all of these different things that you can do so for example if we do scale range and this one you can add some padding to the top and the bottom and you can see how there's padding at the top and padding at the bottom now so today we've gone through some Basics about how to add a swift UI chart to your app you might have noticed that there's no pie chart option well good news in iOS 17 it will include pie charts and donut charts and we're going to cover that next week in the meantime however if you're new to IOS app development definitely check out our three hour masterclass on Swift UI where you're going to build your first app no experience required alright thanks for watching I'll see you in the next video
