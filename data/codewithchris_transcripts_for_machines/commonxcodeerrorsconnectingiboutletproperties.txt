hello welcome to this video where I'm gonna show you guys some tips on how to create your IB outlets for connecting your IB outlets to the elements on your storyboard have you've gone through my beginner series the lessons where we create the war card game you would have had some experience with this where you're adding elements onto the view and then you're connecting those elements to expose them in your view controller so you can access them by a code now let me just demonstrate here I'm gonna do just a let's do a button this is a brand new project you don't need to follow along I just want to show you guys some of the pitfalls so here what we'll usually do is click show the assistant editor and then we're going to click the button we're gonna hold down control on our keyboard and we're gonna click and we're gonna drag it over here so it says insert outlet action or outlet collection and here you want to make sure that your outlet sorry your connection is outlet if you're planning to expose the button if you are planning to do a handle a button tap then you would choose action instead but let's choose outlet and let's say something like I'm gonna type in my my button and I'm gonna purposely spell it wrong because I want to demonstrate a common common problem that beginners run into so now I've called so now I've connected my button element to the view controller but I spelled it wrong so what some people do is they're just going to delete this property and then they're gonna do it again so now I'm gonna spell it the right way and when they run it the app is gonna crash and I'll tell you why in a second so there it's crashed and if you go down to this debug area if you don't have this pane here just go into the upper right and you can toggle it on and if you scroll all the way to the top you're going to see determinating Abdul uncaught exception MS unknown key exception this class is not key value coding compliant for the key my button this is the misspelling see it spelled with an eye so I thought we deleted that I'll let right why is it complaining that it can't find it well let's just stop this for a second well what happens is when you delete after you make this connection even if you delete this line of code right here the button is still connected to that property except now it's even worse because when you run your app it's expecting to connect this element to a property named my but tin with an eye but it's not there anymore so how do we fix this well you go back to your storyboard and you rightclick on the element or if you don't have a two button mouse you can press command and click hold down command and click and you can see down here in the referencing outlets it's connected to two properties in the view controller now the correct spelling in the incorrect spelling so all you want to do to fix this it's click this little X next to the the one you deleted and by doing that now that you run it it won't look for this misspelled outlet another tip is like you see this grey dot here this filled in circle that means that it is connected so this outlet is connected to some element right click if I kill this if I click an X kill that you can see that that circle is not filled anymore so that's just that just indicates to you whether or not it's connected another common mistake that I see people doing when have lots of elements laid out next to each other is sometimes there they may connect the wrong element so I just put a view on top of my button actually let me let me move the button like that so now my button is inside my view so sometimes they may accidentally select the wrong element so let me connect this view here right and I don't think they would type this but somehow they get into this situation where they're connecting the view as as the button so I'm going to delete this other one here so somehow they connected the view or some other element maybe it was the image view as the button so if I right click this button here you can see that there's no referencing outlets that it's connected to but if I rightclick the view you can see that it's connected to the button property in my view controller and my button property is of type UI button so you know I'm gonna write some code here and expect that the button dot let's say set title of the button is draw a card for state UI control state dot normal now I'm trying to set the title for the button here in this piece of code and I'm setting you know whatever element is connected to this property well this is gonna crash because what's actually connected to this property is a UI view element it's not a button so it's gonna crash again and it's gonna say set title select are not found on UI view so you already know how to fix this because we just went through it pretty easy right you just click right click the view and click the X next to the connection and then if your views are overlapping each other so that you are prone to making that mistake what you can do is from this document outline and if you don't have this I should have mentioned earlier there's a little button here in the storyboard to hide or show it and then you can click the element from this document outline hold down ctrl on your keyboard and connect the LF from here okay so you can see that this one's connected to the button now and if you hover over the circle look at highlights which element is connected to it so I can delete this one and finally one last tip is let's go back to let's hide some of these panes here and finally one last tip is when you open up the assistant editor in your storyboard and you're expecting to get the view controller dot Swift for the view for this view controller in your storyboard sometimes you may get something else you may get an error when you're trying to connect elements like in fauxfur view controller not found or something like that or maybe you can't even you can't even get the view controller dot swift on the righthand side well what you can do is you can actually click these little this breadcrumb here and you can manually go and select a view controller that Swift okay another way to do it is here instead of manual just over go down to automatic and you'll see the recommended file for the the view controller or the view that you're looking at and you can click it from there ok I think that does it for the tips for connecting IB outlets I hope this video was helpful for you guys and I'll see you guys next time you
