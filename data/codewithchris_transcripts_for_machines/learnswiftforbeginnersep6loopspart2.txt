hello welcome to learn Swift for beginners lesson 6 in this video I'd like to introduce you to two more types of loops and that is the while loop and the repeat long loop and these two loops lets you execute some code until some condition is met so that's different from the for and loop where it repeated a certain number of times okay let's do it so this lesson we're going to create a brand new playground and I'm just going to call this the loop playground okay so let's cover the while loop first take a look at this slide and let's go through how to declare a while loop so the key word here is while followed by that you have some sort of condition and it's very similar to an if statement so the while loop is going to repeat that chunk of code as long as the condition is true but as soon as that condition becomes false it's not going to repeat the code anymore after your condition you have a set of curly brackets and inside of the curly brackets that's where you have the code that you want to repeat so let's do a quick example back in our playground so I'm just going to declare a variable here I'm going to call this sake counter and I am going to set this counter to ten and then I would like to print hello count sees 5 instead so it doesn't print that many times and I would like to print hello as long as the counter is above zero let's say so I would say something like while counter is greater than zero I would I would do this print right here however this is going to keep repeating as you can see because counter is always 5 so inside my while loop I'm going to computer is dying okay you can see it eventually overflows and crashes okay so what I'm doing here is I am decrementing counter by one for each iteration of the loop so as you saw when I didn't have this line of code it just kept printing hello many many times because this condition would always be would always be false there was nothing changing the counter variable from five to zero so I'm just going to warn you about that if you're going to try this on your own computer you know if you have a slower computer and might it might take a lot longer for you to get out of that out of that loop so you can write this statement first and make sure you have a statement that is decrementing your counter so again this minus equals is the equivalent of writing something like this counter equals counter minus one so you're just taking whatever value counter is your minus thing one and you're setting that as a new value for counter as you can see here what it's what you would expect you get hello five times now let me point something out to you right here what if counter was let's say negative five you can see here that nothing gets printed out because this loop is going to see if this condition is false or true before executing the code right so it evaluates the condition and then it decides whether or not it should run this and repeat it now the second type of loop the repeat while loop is very similar to the while loop except that it checks the condition after looping once so check the condition down here let's take a look at the syntax so you start with the keyword repeat and then you have a set of curly brackets and inside the set of curly brackets you place the code you want to loop or repeat and then after the ending curly bracket you have a while keyword and you then you have the condition so the syntax of this repeat while loop is very intuitive actually it's basically saying repeat this piece of code while this condition is true okay so let's go back to the playground and let's do an example here so I am going to use the same example okay let's print hello here and we're going to have the same thing counter equals counter minus 1 and we're going to say repeat this chunk of code while counter is greater than 0 so as you can see it's pretty much the same loop or same condition rather write while counter is greater than 0 and that's the same thing I have up here for this while loop and let's just print something out here so we can differentiate it and you can see the repeat while loop actually prints it out once and then it checks the condition it realizes oh I shouldn't repeat this chunk of code because this is false right whereas this while loop it checks the condition first and it realizes this condition is not true and it won't print at all so that's that's the main difference between the two types of loop both types of loops will repeat a chunk of code until a certain condition is false except that the while loop checks first and the repeat while loop checks the condition after repeating once okay so that does it for this lesson please give the video a thumbs up and subscribe if you haven't already and I'll see you in the next lesson bye for now you
