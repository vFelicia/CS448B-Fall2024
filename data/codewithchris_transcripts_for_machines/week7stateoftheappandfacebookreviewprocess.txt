hey it's chris here wanted to give you a quick development progress update so uh i have just launched the app and this is a fresh install and what the user is going to see is a sort of onboarding sequence this first message is going to tell them what the app is about they click continue the next one is going to tell them that they can tap on a metric uh tap and hold i think we should say because that's actually the proper gesture they can tap and hold to bring up a tooltip and then they can also tap on the list tab to start tracking their own competitors so what we have here is sort of like a dummy profile this this one doesn't make any requests out to the instagram api at this point because we don't have their account token or sorry their access token to use for any sort of network api requests after they play around with this dummy profile they're going to click on list and they're going to be able to log in with facebook to access their connected instagram business profile and the reason again if you didn't catch the other videos the reason we have to log in with facebook is because we need to have all these requirements to use the specific instagram api that we are using so i'm going to hit login with facebook and because i've logged in before even though this is a fresh install i think it saves some sort of information on the system itself so although i deleted the app and i ran xcode to reinstall it it still knows that i've logged in before so i don't have to enter in my password uh you'll also see that i changed the icon this is just it was just a placeholder icon something we we whipped up really quickly to submit our facebook app for review didn't want to you know get hung up on that and i also changed the name from cwc app to profile scorecards so we'll do that and we're in okay so i am going to search for a username and i'll click this and we're going to come here and if you tap and hold on any metric you're going to be able to see a tooltip describing what it is and how to use it and why it's important something else we've implemented is copy hashtag so this works copying to your clipboard uh we also have this tapping on a post to bring up a bigger version of it you can see that things are still in development because things are out of place however this will show them you know the caption a truncated version of the caption and give them a button to open this in the browser or on instagram now if i close this i know it's gonna crash because you know we're still building this and that's a bug we still need to work out but yeah if you add um a test one for example a dummy profile that doesn't exist will show some sort of error message there we have a setting screen a lot log out button right there just to quickly show you uh the design part of it in case you missed the other video you can see that is the threestep onboarding process this is the profile analytics screen with the popup tooltips and there are still some error states that we have to program in we don't have this pay wall we might actually launch without that because depending on how much time we have left um because we do want to launch this and do some app marketing before you know maybe hopefully before end of april but we're targeting end of april to have the app at least launched and then here's the feed screen where you can add or the list screen where you can add profiles so that's the design here i think in terms of functionality it really is just we've got most of it down need to nail down all of the um the error cases and the edge cases to make sure that app doesn't crash or behave strangely and also you can see that we have quite a bit of work to do in terms of styling the app which i'll talk about in the future video like how we're going to apply this design to the app i'll talk about that later um in terms of other progress we've actually got our facebook app review approved from the facebook team so we submitted our you know it was quite an arduous process actually so if i go to app review here and go down to requests and you can see here that this review was completed and we requested these three permissions and that it was approved so that took way faster than we thought um even in the documentation it take it said it'd take a few weeks from stack overflow we saw other people's experiences that they said it took a few weeks for us we submitted it maybe 2 p.m in the afternoon and i heard back at about 9 00 pm that same day and luckily we were approved so that's amazing and if i didn't tell you before what we needed to provide for the review you actually need to provide an app for them and they provide instructions on how to do this but essentially when you build your xcode app and it produces this dot app file here you can go show in finder and then you can you basically zip up this dot app file and you upload it to them and they're going to be able to launch in the simulator and try it out we also have to explain why we are requesting these permissions so for every single permission you request you tell them why you need it and how you're using it and provide a little screencast a walkthrough of how you're using it so we did this for all three of the permissions that we were requesting and then yeah we got approved and in terms of the app website we've also made a little bit of progress on that so i mentioned before that our designer also happens to be a copywriter by trade and so he is going to be creating all of the copy and the graphics for our app website normally i would suggest for most people just to create like a onepage website website you know as long as you have i would say links to your app in the app store you know a place for people to provide feedback and to get support another good thing would be a way for people to sign up to a newsletter not a newsletter but like a mailing list so that you can email them if there's a new app feature or something like that capturing someone's email would be great if they want to hear more about the app in the future for us because we are planning to build future apps um after this one and we all want it to live under the same sort of family or the same name it's not going to be under code with chris we are going to have another name i registered a domain called madeapps.io there's nothing there right now but i imagine that you know all of the apps we build will will be under this sort of brand or name and we're going to have it's going to have its own website and then it's going to contain information about all of the apps that that we build so i would i would say for the website use what you know there's no need to learn a new skill like to go learn react or to go learn javascript or html or anything like that just to build this website use a website builder some people just use a facebook page right so don't get hung up on building a website for your app it's definitely not the most important thing in our situation our designer also happens to have some knowledge about using webflow so we're going to have him build the website using webflow which is a little more involved because it's not it i don't know if you've seen webflow before i've created a tutorial on it before but it is a way to like it's not completely drag and drop like squarespace or wix or something like that i think those would be a little more intuitive this is a visual builder but there's also a lot of coding components to it so it's sort of in between coding it by writing raw code and completely building it using a visual interface like wix or squarespace so it's somewhere in the middle um like i said i would not recommend to learn a new tool just to build the website yeah so that's that so that's what's happening i'm it we're really lucky in the sense that jc is able to do uh he's sort of multidisciplinary if it were up to me um i probably would have just whipped something up in wordpress because that's what i'm used to that's what word code with chris runs on wordpress slap a theme on it you know customize the text put some graphics on it and boom there you go you have a simple web page yeah so that's it and i hope you enjoyed this video in the next insight video i'll probably talk about how we're going to apply this design into our xcode project because as you can see it's looking pretty bare functionally most of it is there but it's still not looking like the designs quite yet alright this has been a long video thanks so much i'll see you in the next one
