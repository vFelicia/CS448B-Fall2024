pay coders what's up Chris here with episode 7 of how to make a youtube video app in the previous lesson we had created these video thumbnail labels Plus this little dimmed background covering the label so you can see it and we increased the resolution of the video thumbnails by downloading the correct one so thank you to commenter strange productions for that tip on how to get the higherquality thumbnail in this lesson we're going to work on clicking a video selecting a video to go to another view and I just noticed that clicking a thumbnail actually kind of removes that UI view in there so let's fix that first of all let's go into the storyboard and how we would fix that is if we click our basic cell right here in the document outline and for the selection let's choose none instead of the default is blue so let's run it again and see what happens ok so now it's good it's not doing that weird selection highlight ok so now what we want to do in order to navigate to another view is we're going to use what's called a navigation controller and it's just one of the ways that we can handle navigation in an iOS app but in this case it's going to be pretty simple for our two view controller application so our main view controller let me just close this document outline so we can see a little better this is the main view controller we have here the scrollable list or the table view of the videos and our second view controller is going to be the detail one when we select a particular video and that detailed view controller is going to show the actual video in the description so what we're going to do here is click this little white bar of the view controller so we make sure it's highlighted alternatively from the document outline you can select the view controller right here actually when you select that make sure it highlights in blue like that or click the view controller here go up to the menu I'm gonna go to editor embed in and choose navigation controller and when you do that let's just double click here to zoom out when you do that you'll notice that it added what's called a navigation controller and you see this little line pointing to our main view controller with the scrollable list of videos and also notice that this arrow I mentioned in the first lesson or second lesson that this dictates where the starting point is you'll notice that now it points to the navigation controller so this guy here actually controls what is being shown to the user it can keep track of a bunch of view controllers and it can manage the transitions in between them so right now the navigation controllers root view controller is this main view controller we've got here so this is going to be the first view that people see and if you run the app now you're not really going to see any difference well you do see that navigation header there so we can customize that a little bit later nothing happens still when we click these video thumbnails gonna stop it we're gonna add the second screen now so that's really exciting because we're going to get to navigate in between them very very soon so in here in the object library just search for view controller there's going to be a whole bunch but you want to select this top one that simply says view controller and what you want to do is drag it onto your storyboard it's gonna get a little crowded so what you can do is double click to zoom out and then just rearrange it there so I'm just gonna put it up here on top of the the main view controller there so how do we get it so that when we click a video it goes to this second view controller that we have here well what we're going to do is draw a little arrow just like this one here where the view controller is pointing to our main view controller and draw a little arrow from this view controller to the one that we just added and we want that little arrow to happen that indicates a transition we want that transition to happen when the user selects a cell okay so I'm gonna double click the empty area to kind of drill back in now what we're going to do is select the cell and actually I'm gonna sell like the sell because I click the sell here but I'm actually selected my image view so as you can see in the document outline want to make sure that we select the basic sell so I'm gonna hold down ctrl on my keyboard and while holding down ctrl I'm going to click and drag and then you'll see a little blue line start to follow your basic sell so we're gonna drag it all the way up here in the document line to this view controller line and this is the view controller that we just added I'm gonna let go you're gonna see a little menu pop up and under selection segue we're gonna choose show ok so selection segue is when that cell is selected we're going to transition to this view controller when you select show you'll see that this little arrow is drawn you see the little arrow there it's kind of hiding behind behind it ok so let's see how that effects the app I'm going to run it right now and then now when we select a video cell it transitions to our second view controller and it also has this little back button for us to go back so at this point no matter what video cell we select it goes to that view controller in the next lesson we're going to customize this detail view so that we can show a video thumbnail and a description so it was a short video today I'm sure you guys all have Black Friday deals to get to I know I do I'll see you guys on Monday at 12 p.m. Eastern have a great weekend talk to you then bye bye
