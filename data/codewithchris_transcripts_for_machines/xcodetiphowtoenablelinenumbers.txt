hey guys Chris here with another Xcode tip for you guys and this time I'm gonna show you guys how to enable the line numbers in your code editor so I think by default they don't show up and I forget that fact because I sometimes get people asking me how to turn on the line numbers and I'm like what do you mean I thought they were there by default but apparently they're not well it's very easy to enable just go to up to the Xcode menu here go to preferences and then go to text editing and here is a checkbox for line numbers all you need to do is enable that you know make sure that's checked and then you'll see line numbers
