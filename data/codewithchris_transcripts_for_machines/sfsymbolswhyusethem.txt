hello and welcome in this lesson we're going to talk about SF symbols a large collection of system icons that you can use in your iOS 13 apps not only are they very handy they also come with a lot of additional benefits which I'll demonstrate for you in this video all right stay tuned hey there my name is Chris and if this is your first time here welcome to code with Chris where we'll teach you how to build an app even if you've never coded before before we dive into SF symbols I've got a quick question for you do you use any sort of icon package or service for the icons that you use in your app or maybe you design your own let me know by leaving a quick comment below and on your way down there if you wouldn't mind it please give this video a quick like I really appreciate it alright with that said let's dive right in so here I have a basic Swift UI Xcode project and all I have is an H stack with an image and text element inside of it the text says like and the image is one of a heart now keep in mind that I don't actually have an image asset of a heart in my asset library in this project instead I'm using the SF symbols icon framework which I alluded to in the previous lesson so let's take a look at the Apple human interface guidelines I'm just going to pull that up right here and take a look at what exactly are these symbols so SF symbols are a set of 1500 icons and symbols that you can use in your iOS 13 apps now Apple designed these symbols to play really nicely with the San Francisco system font if you're unfamiliar with what this font is it's essentially the default font that you use in your app so if you're not using any sort of custom font then you are using the San Francisco font and as you can see using an SF symbol alongside that font looks really neat and tidy everything's aligned and arranged nicely whereas if you had supplied your own heart image you might have to play around with the sizing and alignment just to get it to look in line with the text so the other thing that is a huge benefit to using SF symbols is that it caves like a font as you can see here for each of these symbols there are different weights like ultra light thin light regular all the way to black there's different like line thicknesses and sizes as well and these symbols are vector based which means that no matter how large or small you scale them they're going to be really sharp and the fidelity is going to be consistent just like the font so let me go back into Xcode and demonstrate for you so you can visibly see some of those benefits that I'm talking about so for example if I want to change the the font that I have and I want to add a font modifier maybe I want to do a large title type of font as you can see it changes the text element as I expected but it also changed that image element that SF symbol had I used my own supplied image graphic that wouldn't have done anything this modifier I mean or let's say I want red font red text if I change the foreground color to red that affects my SF symbol as well so that's really nice and then for my next demonstration let me just remove this red color because I mean you're going to be able to see a lot more clearly and then I'm going to run this app in the simulator I'm going to just bring that over here and I'm not sure if you knew about this in Xcode 11 but there is a menu that you can bring up by clicking this button called environment overrides and this allows you to test your UI and test your app under different device specific conditions so things like whether or not the user is using dark mode or light mode what kind of dynamic type magnification are they using maybe they can't see the text very well so they have upped the magnification or the font size and also these different accessibility options you can see how your app plays nicely or not so nicely with them turned on so why don't we go ahead and try to turn on dark mode oops there we go now as you can see the text element changed to white because obviously black text on a dark mode you wouldn't be able to read it but what I didn't expect was that the SF symbol also turned light if you were to use your own supplied image or graphic asset you would have had to supply to one for the light mode and one for dark mode and then there's a way for you to configure it inside the asset library to tell the system which version to use for dark mode and which version to use for light mode but if you're using an SF symbol as we're using here you don't have to specify any of that because it behaves like a font so you kind of get this for free which is really nice the next thing is that you have dynamic type so some people might have this huge magnification on to make sure that they can read the text your SF symbol scales with that so you can see that with an image not so much and then same thing with these accessibility options anything that you would expect to happen to your font you know your symbol will also play nicely with that so that is awesome and there are 1500 of these symbols for you to use and if that weren't enough Apple has said that you can actually export these symbols and customize them to your own so let me show you where we can browse these symbols and how you can export one to configure it or to modify it to your needs into your liking so here is a link to the SF symbols app I've got it open right here actually it's a Mac OS app which allows you to browse all of the different symbols that are available in this framework and you can also choose the waiting and stuff like that and it's it's a nice way to browse all of the icons essentially and the way you use them is you take note of this name and all you have to do is specify this name let's say this one Mike dot circle dot fill and use the system name initializer for the image element and just pass that in what was that again Mike dot circle dot fill and let's take a look at that all right so there you go that's how easy it is to use if you wanted to export one of these icons and use them as a template to build off of you can also do that so just highlight the one that you want let's say Mike go up to edit sorry file and export custom symbol template the shortcut key is command e so when you do that it's going to produce an SVG file for you which is a standard vectorbased graphics file then you can save it somewhere and you can import that into your favorite vectorbased graphics software such as Adobe Illustrator or sketch or what I like to use figma because it's free to use and get started with so that's what I'm going to show you here I have figma open I'm just going to drag and drop that Mike SVG file into here and then you can see all of the different weights so it might be hard to read for you here there's thin all the way light regular mediums semi bold bold and then there's different sizes as well here and then down here in the lower left hand corner there are some instructions and some some guides and that's how you can customize these well this is granted if you know how to work with vectors and to edit vectors right so that is another learning curve but for let's say a designer that knows how to create their own icons and modify vectors then this would be great for them now there are a set of icons that Apple has said you should not touch and you should use as is so if we go back to the human interface guidelines and you scroll down these symbols are for use as is and these symbols mostly have to do with Apple brands so they are they don't want you to tamper with brand logos or brand iconography which is understandable so you have things like airplay AR KITT iCloud FaceTime face ID stuff like that for these symbols you want to use them as they are for anything else it's fair game for you to export modify customize to your liking and use now before we I'm out this video there are a couple of resources I do want to mention that might make your life easier so this one is called SF symbols calm it's not by Apple it's made by a developer named Noah and it's a very easy way for you to find an icon that you need in case you don't have the Mac app installed and let me just show you how that works so let's say I'm searching for that that looks like or sounds like the one that I need copy it and then simply paste it in here and just like that very easy so this is very handy there's another article from a van early on SF symbols that helped me out when I was learning this and this is very handy to go through if you'd like to do that so yeah I would highly recommend that you use SF symbols where you can especially for places like beside button text or in buttons in menu buttons even in tab bars those are all great places to use sf symbols but keep in mind that the use of SS symbols there are some restrictions and maybe I should have mentioned this up front but it says here that you can't use SF symbols in your app icons logos or any other trademark related use however I think using them inside of your app is fair game so in this lesson you learn all about SF symbols and how you can incorporate them into your app in the next lesson we're going to start building our first swift UI app together a slot machine if you enjoyed this lesson please subscribe to this channel and make sure you turn on Bell notifications as well so you
