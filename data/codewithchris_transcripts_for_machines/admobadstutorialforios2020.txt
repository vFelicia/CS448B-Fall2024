hey coke crew how's it going in today's video I'll teach you guys how to implement ads into your apps specifically we're going to be using Google AdMob to implement banner ads and you know it couldn't be easier to do as you're gonna see now before we begin one word if you're brand new to the channel welcome and if you're brand new to the iOS app development you're in the right place be sure to check out my beginner video series which I'll link to right now because watching that is going to equip you with all of the proper skills you need in order to understand what's going on in this video all right so without further ado let's get started so the first thing you're going to want to do is to go to AdMob comm and create a new account because that's we're gonna see your stats you're gonna get paid essentially so you're gonna want to do this go to AdMob comm sign in with your Google account or sign up for a brand new account and once you do you're gonna get to some sort of dashboard like this or you might get like a quick start wizard that's asking you to add a new app go ahead and click that because we're gonna need to create an AdMob app now I already created this as a demo so I'm just gonna click on add app here but I think when you first start your brand new account you're gonna get a screen that looks something like this since we're starting a new demo we're gonna click no for this I'm going to enter in our app information and also enable or select iOS for our platform I'm going to call this the ads demo and I'm gonna click Add and this app ID is very important because when we display an ad inside our app we're going to need to take note of this app ID that is what links those ads to this AdMob app that we're creating okay we're not going to create an ad unit now just go ahead and click I'll do it later now the next step is to create our Xcode project for the actual app where we're going to display our banners so let's create a brand new Xcode project we're going to choose a single view application I just call this the ads demo as well it's just okay so I'll click Next I'll save it on my desktop here and take note of that bundle ID that's sort of the unique identifier for your Xcode project now that we have this project created we need to add the AdMob SDK or the libraries into our project now if you happen to be using firebase this is going to be very easy because the AdMob service is actually part of the firebase platform so in the process of installing firebase you can also install AdMob and you're not familiar with firebase I've done a whole bunch of tutorials covering it it's basically a remote database that you can use it's offered by Google and so you can store and retrieve data it's very easy to use and it's got a very generous free tier so I highly recommend it if you're not using firebase you can still download the AdMob library separately and add them into your Xcode project but for this tutorial we're going to use the firebase way so if we go back to the AdMob dashboard there's actually a very easy link to proceed to link it to a firebase project and then get those firebase libraries and AdMob libraries installed what you're gonna do is come back here and then click on some of these icons are hard to understand what they are but if you hover over them you're gonna see it go to app settings and then there is see there's your app ID if that you're gonna need and firebase link so you can go ahead and just click this there is some sort of policy that you can read let's confirm that and we're going to need the bundle ID so this is very important because it can't be changed later we're going to come here and grab our bundle identifier for our project and then come back here and just paste it in there and it's gonna let us continue it can't find a specific firebase project for this guy and so I'm going to create a brand new firebase project I'm going to call this the ads demo click continue and it's creating a new fire based project in the firebase console for us it's kind of equivalent of coming here into your firebase console and then adding a brandnew project except that it's just doing it here for us so it's successfully linked the add demo that we created in AdMob to a firebase project that it just created for us so if we refresh this firebase console page we should be able to see it and let's see there it is other projects using firebase so we haven't finished setting this guy up yet at this point it's telling us to go over to the firebase documentation to setup the firebase project so we'll just click done here and in the app settings you can see now it's linked to that firebase project going back to the firebase console though we can now finish setting up this firebase project choose data sharing all right Google wants us to share some data with them for you you should actually read those for me says this is just a demo application I'm not as concerned so we need to set things up here let's click on this guy we're going to need to download this Google service info dot plist because this guy contains all of the configuration settings to point to this firebase instance so we're going to need to download this file and add it to our Xcode project so let's go ahead download it I'll just save it on my desktop and then just drag it into your Xcode project like that make sure that copy items if needed is enabled as is targets for that guy right there all right so we have it added here now what we're going to do is just close that Xcode project because now we're going to use something called cocoa pods to get those firebase and AdMob libraries into our Xcode project if you're unfamiliar with installing firebase with cocoa pods or if you don't have cocoapods installed in your system I'm gonna link to a couple of other videos that I've done right now and you can get cocoapods installed on your system first so you have this package manager which helps you manage all these thirdparty libraries that you're using it's pretty standard stuff and it's definitely something that you're gonna want to have if you're going to be building different apps utilizing thirdparty SDKs like we're doing now so cocoapods is a must or a really good thing to have and then the next thing would be using cocoapods to get the firebase and AdMob libraries now we're gonna do that together here using cocoapods but if you want a slower tutorial where I walk through everything in much more detail you can watch my firebase quick start video which I'll also link to right now alright so let's go ahead and use cocoapods to install the firebase and AdMob libraries we are you can see how I did it from a previous demo but essentially let me close this first so that we get a fresh start we're gonna open up terminal here and we are going to navigate to our project folder I've saved it on the desktop so I'm gonna go ahead and navigate there so here I am we're going to type in pod space in it to basically initialize our project to use cocoapods I'm gonna doubleclick my folder here and here I've got this pod file I'm going to open it up in a text editor like that and we are going to add a couple of pods so one of them we need is firebase core and this is all of the firebase kind of like the basic libraries and classes that we're going to need and then we're also going to add AdMob and keep in mind that this M has to be capitalized if you do a lowercase M it's not going to recognize it let's save this file and let's jump back into terminal and type in pod install that's gonna go out and fetch those libraries it's gonna be really fast for me here because I've done it before and so for you it might take a little longer take note of this though we're gonna have to use the XC workspace file from now if you have Xcode open right now go ahead and close it so you don't get confused this is what you used to open now we're going to open this so go ahead and open XC workspace in your file navigator under pods you're gonna see all of these different libraries that's downloaded for you go ahead and hit command B to build your project just to make sure that everything is working right now all right built succeeded so we can go on the next thing to do is go into app delegate where we are going to basically when the app launches we want to tell it to initialize firebase and configure it for use so in the app delegate Swift at the top we're going to import a firebase and then in the view did finish launching with options here we are going to type in firebase app dot configure and we have to do this before the return statement all right so this is initialized firebase we also have to initialize AdMob so if we go back to the documentation I don't I want to make this a habit for you to go through and I'll show you where in the documentation it is if you just go into the firebase documentation on the left hand side scroll all the way down under Google AdMob under iOS get started it's going to tell you all of the information that we're going to do right now so installing the firebase SDK we've done that create an AdMob account we also did that register an app did that link the app to a firebase project we did that and so this is where we're at right now we're adding these two pods right we did a pod install and now we need to initialize the AdMob SDK so you can see import firebase did that firebase app configure did that and now this part is what we need to do GAD mobile ads thought configure with application ID and this is our AdMob app ID so we go into your AdMob account that's where this ID is going to be needed let's copy app ID let's go here dad mobile ads dot configure with application ID create a string with that and that's where that goes let's go back to the documentation here you scroll down there are different ad formats that we can use we can do a banner interstitial native record rewarded video so I'll let you read those descriptions we're gonna create a basic ad banner that's the one that everyone knows and loves I don't know about loves but knows for sure we're gonna scroll down here this is very important always test with test ads because if you're showing live ads in your simulator an advertiser is paying dollars for that view and you're technically not showing it to anybody that's really going to click it and provide a return on investment for that advertiser so if if you do that a lot your account will probably get banned when you're testing in building your app you want to be using this this specific ID here which will show test ads and no one's gonna be paying any money to for those ads they're just placeholder ads so we're gonna take note of that we're gonna use that in a second we're gonna need to create a GAD banner view this is the class that's used to display that banner and there's two ways of doing it you can do it programmatically so I'll walk through this way with you first you import Google mobile ads you create a GAD banner view property and then in the viewdidload you can instantiate it with a whatever size you want and after that you set translates Auto resize a mask into constraints to false because you're going to be specifying those Auto layout constraints yourself so you don't want the system to automatically convert that Auto resize mask into constraints for you then you're going to add that view into the route view of your view controller and then finally you're going to add the constraints in this case they are centering it and then they're also adding a bottom attribute now there's a note here that says we don't give it a specific height or width as the provided ad size will give the banner and intrinsic content size to size the view so it's talking about this guy right here this ad size that you're passing in it kind of gives that better view and intrinsic size the other way to add a banner view is through the interface builder and for the sake of the beginners watching this video I'm actually going to do it this way now in this way we are going to be using the storyboard we're gonna be adding the banner of you and then specifying a height and width that we want to get ads for and then we're going to position it then we're going to connect this banner view as an iboutlet property so we can trigger the ad for it now the the thing is you're not going to find GAD banner view in the storyboard so we jump into the storyboard here and we open up the object library that's this button up here you type in gasps man interview you can't you can't find it right what you do is in the view controller you can import get or Google mobile ads and you can take a look at this class GAD banner view what sort of classes this is subclass of and if you just hold down option on your keyboard and click it you can see that its subclasses UI view so essentially you just need to add a UI view into your storyboard and set the custom class the GAD banner view so let's erase that come back here and we are going to add a UI view and we are going to set the height and width of this guy to 320 by 50 as the documentation set we are going to horizontally Center this guy and we are going to add a bottom constraint of let's say let's say 20 and you can see our battery there it's white on white does he can't really see it but when we display an ad in there you'll be able to see it oh I almost forgot highlight that uiview set the custom class to get a banner view yeah if you don't do that it's just going to be a basic UI view now go into the assistant editor we are going to connect this banner view here as an iboutlet let's call this banner view and then let's go back to the documentation it's going to the view controller here and see how exactly do we load up and add into that banner view element alright it's configured ad banner view properties so there are two that we need to set one is the root view controller this view controller is used to present an overlay when the ad is clicked it should normally be set to the view controller that contains the GAT banner view so that's easy we just set it to self the other one is the ad unit ID now inside your AdMob dashboard you would be coming here to ad units and you would basically create a if you are going to display a 320 by 50 banner ad in your app you need to create that ad unit in here and you're going to get a specific ID for it and then you're going to be setting that ID here so counter view dot ad unit ID you're going to set it to that banner view that view controller equals self that's the second one we need to set but remember what I told you about testing right so since we're testing we are going to use their test ID if we scroll all the way up that's this guy right here so we're going to use this test ad that's the ID for that and we paste it in there and then let's see what else we have to do we're gonna have to load an ad right so this is the code for that batter view download and then create a new guide request the object represents a single ad requesting contain properties for things like targeting information let's give that a try save it and then we're gonna run it so there we go we've loaded a test ad in the bottom right there and that's how easy it is to implement AdMob ads for your app now I highly encourage you to read further remember there are different ad formats you can do write interstitial native ads and rewarded videos and also you can listen to events for your banner view if you handle this GAD Banner View protocol and set your view controller as a delegate for it you can hear events such as when it's actually loaded and AD when the requests failed and stuff like that so I'll link to this documentation below the video so you can check it out and if you want the source code you'll also find it in the description below the video so what do you
