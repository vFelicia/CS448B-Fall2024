hey guys what's up it's Chris here I'm taking a short walk thinking about everything that's happened in 2018 and all the things that I'm thankful for as well and as you guys know a big part of my life is code with Chris and you guys and so I just have to whip out my phone and tell you guys thank you so much for all the support and love that you guys have shown me not just in 2018 but since code with Chris has started all the way back in 2013 with a simple blog I didn't think I'd still be doing it to be honest to this day and without you guys I definitely wouldn't be doing this so thank you so much again from the bottom of my heart for all of the support and all of the love that you guys have shown me I hope that I can continue to serve you guys better and better into 2019 and help you guys all with your iOS development journey so here's wishing you a safe and happy new year and I'll see you guys in January bye for now
