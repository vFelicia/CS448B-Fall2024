uikit did you know that UI stands for user interface you've used this library several times before mostly through the storyboard by dragging objects from the object library to your view and I mentioned that all of those elements that you're dragging from the object library there are objects of classes that are in UI kit so in this lesson I'd like to dive a little deeper into UI kit and tell you all about it and what it involves this webpage which I'll link to below the video is the reference page for UI kit you can see the classes that UI kit contains for instance if we go into views and controls under user interface you'll see those elements that are related to views and controls so for example we have used this UI image view class if you click into it you're going to see all of the methods and properties for that class and some of the more popular elements in UI kit will actually contain an article telling you how to perform common tasks with that class but if you scroll all the way to the bottom starting from this grayed out topics area you're going to see properties and you can tell that they are property by this VAR keyword here that's the name of the property followed by the datatype for that property if you click into it and it looks like this page is broken right now or maybe that link is broken I'm sure it's going to get fixed soon because that property for a UI image view is the most popular one it's the one that you set the image to display let's try to clicking a different one yeah and you should get a page like this that is going to give you a discussion about what that property is and what it does and it's going to give you some related items and if you click a function we scroll down a little bit you can see that functions have the function keyword and if you click into that you will get this one doesn't accept any parameters so it's kind of a bad example but if this function did a set parameters you would see a description of what each parameter is what it expects and why you need to supply that parameter no it doesn't look like actually we can click into one of these initializers like this so here for this you're gonna have a parameter section it's going to describe each parameter that you need to supply and if there are return values that would be under here as well so this documentation is great for looking up information on uiq classes however this is not the only way to access this information for example a lot of the times when I'm working with a class that I don't recognize I will just do a quick Google search for that class so here I've searched for UI image view and actually if that class has an apple developer documentation page for it usually it will be the first result so I find that just googling the class name is sometimes just faster to getting to this page then it is navigating through all of this stuff you know the actual UI kit framework page now another way that you can access this information is actually from within Xcode so here i've got a brand new Xcode project and I just wanted to demonstrate how you can access that same documentation from within Xcode so for example if I just declare a new image view here let's create that image view object and if I just put my cursor on that class and I look over on this righthand side and there is this tab here and the inspector pane it says a quick help inspector and here it tells you exactly what it is here so it's a class UI image view it is a subclass of UI view which is something you're going to learn in the following lesson so ignore that part for now but this description tells you what that class is and then you can see here it's declared an UI kit and you can click this class reference link and it will actually launch this window that is showing you the exact same page however this is just from within Xcode this is the same page that we saw through the website we can scroll all the way down here under topics you can see all of the functions and properties and actually let's try clicking this one the same link that was broken before oh and it works here so maybe just doing it in app is easier you don't have to go to Google search or anything like that alright so let me close this window for now we're going to actually get back to this window in just a second and I'll talk more about that but I want to show you yet another way to access documentation from with an Xcode so you just saw that I can put my cursor here and going over to the inspector pane on this quick inspector tab you can see some info here you can also just hold down alt on your keyboard and you can immediately see that if your cursor is over a class name you see that question mark don't know if you can see but if I hover off the class it just turns into this a little plus cursor but if I actually hover over the class you can see it's a question mark now if I click it you're gonna see just the context menu pop up and this information is just exactly what's here in this quick help but it's even faster you don't have to put your cursor in it and then go over to the tab and change over to this quick help tab or anything like that and again from here you can click on the class reference link and out pops this end and in fact it just saved where we were last time so there's a uiimageview now I just showed you some techniques to find out more information about a class that you are currently using that you're not sure about however what if you aren't working with a class and you're instead you're looking for a class to see if there's maybe an existing class and you like it that does something that you want to do already in that case you want to browse so you can either go through that webpage like I showed you this is the uikit reference page again the link is below and you can kind of go through these sections and you can browse another cool way to do it is actually from within the app so in here you can go up to window and then look for developer documentation and when you click that you're going to get this documentation window that we saw earlier and you can actually search for it or on the left hand side there's this button that will bring this pane out if you don't have it under UIKit you can more easily just click on these different classes expand these notes we're gonna work with a lot of these classes actually in the course but this is a good way to browse instead if you don't really know what you're looking for so for example under controls you have buttons and date pickers and page controls sliders stuff like that if you're not sure if you I could have the class that does something you want to do already you can just open up the developer documentation and do some browsing all right so in this lesson you learned about where to find information on the uikit classes and also where to find that documentation from within Xcode and just to remind you guys you can go to the Apple UIKit webpage or you can just type in that class name into Google and usually that top result is that reference page you can also put your typing cursor on the function name or on the class name and then on the right hand side and xcode in the inspector panel you're going to get some quick help information about that and don't forget you can hold down the option key on your keyboard and then go ahead and click that function or that class name again to bring up quick help and finally in xcode you can go up to the window menu developer documentation and bring up that in app reference guide that is also searchable so that's really great so that stuff is going to come in real handy as you're building your app and you're learning all of the classes that you can use if
