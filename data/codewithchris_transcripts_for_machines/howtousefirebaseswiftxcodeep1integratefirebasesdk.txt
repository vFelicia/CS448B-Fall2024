hey coders what's up it's Chris here and today we're going to look at firebase firebase is a backend as a service and that allows you very very easily to give your app database capabilities so if you ever wanted to do something with your app like user accounts or you wanted to store data on the cloud in a database firebase will allow you to do that very easily without having to set up your own servers and manage your own servers in this particular lesson we're going to sign up for a firebase account and then we're going to integrate the firebase libraries into our Xcode project using cocoapods so Google actually owns firebase which is why the sign up button you need a Google account if you don't have one it's gonna go and prompt you to either log in with a Google account or sign up for one so I've already done that I'm gonna click sign up with Google anyways and it's gonna detect that I'm already logged in so after you sign up for an account and you get logged in you're looking at your firebase dashboard by default they're gonna create an app for you right here notice that there is this URL here and this firebase URL is gonna be very important because that's gonna identify this particular database that we want to write and read data from we're not going to jump into the dashboard for this app yet what I want to do is go into quick starts and I'm gonna choose iOS here and then this is going to show us how to install their SDK with cocoapods so there's also a video up here if you want to watch the video instead what we're going to do is open up Xcode and create a single view application first okay so let's create a new Xcode project and I'm just gonna choose single View application here I'm gonna call it the firebase demo and make sure that the language is Swift and devices iPhone and we're not using any of those features I'm just gonna save it in my desktop and now that we've created our Xcode project we're going to have to close it because we're going to install the cocoa pod so first of all in my project directory I don't have a pod file so I'm going to have to create a pod file so that I can specify that I want to install the firebase cocoapod now if you don't know what cocoapods is then check out the video in the upper right hand corner right here and it's gonna open up a new window and show you how to setup cocoa pods on your machine so that you can easily install firebase so with that said I'm going to jump into terminal pressing command spacebar and typing in terminal and I'm gonna navigate to my project directory so let's see where we're at right here we're at my home folder type CD desktop to go into the desktop folder and then CD firebase I'm gonna press tab and it's gonna autocomplete that folder name for me and so there I am I'm gonna type in pod space in it and that's going to create the pod file as you can see here and then I'm just going to right click I'm going to open that with my text editor sublime text and then what we can do is follow this and there's a handy copy button right there okay we're gonna copy that and paste that between the target and the end and that just specifies that we're gonna want the firebase pod I'm gonna press command s to save it and now we're going to go back to terminal and we're going to type pod space install so that's gonna go ahead and grab the firebase libraries and pull them down let's go back to the documentation for a little bit okay so we didn't we didn't follow these instructions here actually this one was opening the pod file in Xcode so instead of opening the pod file in your text editor you can open it up in Xcode by typing this command in terminal so that's alternatively you can do that so we ran the pod install command and here through terminal you can type open and then firebase demo XE workspace to open that but we're just going to see if that's complete okay it's still going it might take a while okay there it goes okay let's check back on that in a little while so all we have to do in Swift is we're gonna have to import firebase before we use the firebase classes and reading and writing data is pretty boom keep in mind there's a toggle right here between Objective C and Swift and for Swift we're going to do something like this so we have to create a reference to the database by creating a new firebase object and passing in this URL so this one was the one that you saw in the dashboard for our app it points it points to the database where we're going to read and write data and then very simply to write data all you have to do is call set value on the database so in this lesson we're not actually going to do that yet we're just going to finish installing the cocoa pod and we're going to import firebase there it's done it's open up our project directory XC workspace and at this point I like to press command B to build the project just to make sure that nothing's wrong it's gonna compile the firebase libraries as well all right that's awesome so here in the view controller we want it to connect to the database we would import firebase here and then we would follow those instructions to write some data so we're gonna do that in the next lesson and I'm also going to show you how you can centralize all of those database writing and reading statements so that you're not connecting to the firebase database and reading and writing data all over the place it's gonna be really messy and hard to keep track of so we'll probably gonna want to create a database manager or something like that a new class that's gonna encapsulate all of those methods that interact with the database okay thanks for watching and I'll see you guys in the next lesson talk to you guys later bye
