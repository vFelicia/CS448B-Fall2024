hello it's Chris here our video editor Adrian is on vacation but guess what I'm not going to let that stop me from answering the question will AI take over our iOS Developer jobs now to give you some context a couple of weeks ago I got a question from a mom asking if AI was going to make iOS developers obsolete now you see she had a son who was interested in programming and she wanted to watch out for him and his future totally makes sense I get it my first instinct was to reply KN program rers will always be needed but I had to stop myself because I mean AI can do things today that a year ago we didn't think would be possible so who's to say that in the future AI won't be able to write an app an entire app with a single prompt and guess what it is kind of possible right now we'll dive into that a little bit more later in this video but right now when I get back to the story I really had to give some thought before I respond responded to this mom because when I think about it aren't we moving towards less and less code writing in recent years there's more and more no code solutions to build websites to build apps and all those sorts of things even apple is seemingly making this transition to no code or less code think back on the early days of iOS development and don't worry if you weren't there because I will paint this picture for you so we were working with The Objective C programming language the syntax was indecipherable you had to manage your own memory which means frequent crashes with obscure error messages taking hours to figure out oh oh and get this if you think excode is bad right now you weren't there for xcode version 3 and The Objective C syntax was more verbose meaning that you had to write a lot of code just to achieve something very simple and the keywords they were obscure they didn't make sense if you were missing a dash here or a semicolon there things would just not work and then we got Swift yay developers Rejoice I know I certainly did because it made my job teaching beginners a lot easier Swift took care of a lot of the under the hood nittygritty details you so you didn't have to worry about them in the syntax was more like natural language and the keywords actually made sense so that got a lot more people into IOS app development and then recently we got Swift UI with its declarative Syntax for building user interfaces you tell the system what you want it to do in various conditions and states and it does a sensible job of laying things out you no longer have to write code to tell the system position this button at x39 and Y 100 you know and you don't have to manually update the views all of that happens relatively sensibly and relatively well without your intervention and all of this results in less code needing to be written so even with apple we're moving towards less and less code being written and maybe eventually no code but you know what we don't have to guess about what is going to happen because it's already happened in multiple Industries time and time again what do I mean by that well think about car manufacturing plants factories manual labor what happened when robotics got better well I'll leave that thought with you because I want to use an example that's a little bit closer to home think about web development web development has gone through some form of this transition already because in the early days of the internet if you wanted to build a website you needed to know how to code in HTML and then we got tools such as Dreamweaver to build websites visually and that made setting up websites a little more accessible to people who didn't know HTML but what about those people who did know HTML what happened happened to them well as the tools got better web developers had to do less and less of the mundane and repetitive tasks perhaps to set up the initial frame or scaffolding of the website and they could focus on creating better websites more interactive maybe more visually appealing maybe better experiences or perhaps their time was freed up to build even better tools which then feeds into the loop as tools get better then web developers can focus Fus on something else better experiences better tools and then the loop just keeps going on and on and then if you zoom out and take a look at how websites have evolved take a modern website versus a website in the early days of the internet you'll see a dramatic difference and the same goes for iOS apps take a look at early day app store iOS apps versus the apps of today so let's bring this back full circle will AI Place iOS developers my personal opinion is that no it won't it's just going to redefine what an iOS Developer is and what they do perhaps there's less of an emphasis on doing the actual coding and more of an emphasis on building a better experience or a more complex and large product now take for example Vision OS you know the goggles that Apple introduced not to downplay it but you know what I mean can you imagine building software for that device trying to build a spatial experience without any of the tools that Apple provides or if Apple didn't provide you any tools to do that it would be a pretty big feat I think so it is my belief that AI is a tool that will eliminate a lot of that manual work that iOS developers do and allow us to focus on something farther down the workflow it won't completely eliminate the need for iOS developers at all okay but I think there's a bigger question here all of that stuff I just talked about that was future state but what can you do right now in preparation to ride the wave and position yourself to be there to take advantage when AI really hits the mainstream let's talk about that and I think I want to address this from two different perspective one is from an aspiring or current professional iOS Developer that means you're in the job industry and the other perspective is from one of being an indie app developer where you're publishing apps and you're making money from the App Store let's talk about the job industry first now would you agree with me if I said that AI code is cheaper than human code now don't get me wrong I'm not talking about the AI code of today which could be insecure which could be noncontextual to your environment I'm talking about future State AI code where it's perfected and it is secure and it is contextual and exactly what you need in your organization would that be cheaper than humans writing code and I think the answer is yes and do we all agree that companies are there to make money so I think that it makes sense that companies will adopt AI if it helps them make more money and they can figure out what role it plays in their workflow and in their organization it's just that right now ai is not 100% there and companies are still figuring out how to use it without having it blow up in their face and costing them tons of dollars and bad PR and ruined reputation if you are a current iOS professional chances are you're probably already using generative AI in your workflow whether or not company policy allows it if I were still working in Industry I would be really really tempted perhaps you use generative AI for things like writing test cases or documentation or even emails or if there's something that I don't know how to do use Ai and try to build it and then read the code and see if I can learn from it something like that if you're smart about it I feel like you would use generative AI as a draft as a starting point and then you would filter that output through your own expertise rather than fully trusting it generating it and submitting it I think you can get into a lot of trouble like that now if you do a good job of using AI in your workflow right now I bet you're probably pretty productive much more so than your peers who are are not using generative AI in their workflow now just be careful because you might be playing with fire if it's not allowed in your company and you are doing it as an aspiring iOS professional I think the decision is a lot more easy here I if I were you I would keep a pulse on the AI industry and how tools are evolving how good they're getting so that when companies do understand how AI plays a role in their organization you'll be there and uh you'll have a leg up against all of the the other candidates who have not looked at AI at all now let's talk about Indie app developers oh boy I think you guys are on a gold mine let me tell you why if you make money from publishing apps I think AI tools have just supercharged your workflow more and more frequently I'm seeing posts like this pop up on Reddit where someone has released fullfledged apps or products generated by Ai and they're getting users and they're getting Revenue but they have no idea how to code and what any of it does they just generate it and publish it Market it the problem is when they hit a snag such as this they don't know how to fix it because they have no technical knowledge but if you are an indie appdev you do have that knowledge and you also have no company policy telling you that you cannot use AI there are no rules so you could very well use AI to generate you apps tweak it modify it and publish it and that is so much faster than building your own apps from scratch Another Thing contentbased apps as a solo developer it's really hard to create contentbased apps because you need a lot of content and you probably need a team to create all of this content that's where the value of a contentbased app is but with AI do I have to connect the dots for you anyways I think it's a great time to capitalize on the app store and I think that as more apps get published things will get more competitive and you'll have to stand out from that the same thing happened in uh the webdev industry as websites became easier and easier to build there was so many tools you could just set up a website with no knowledge of code at all it just became more competitive and uh websites needed to become better if you wanted to stand out from the crowd it needed to provide a better experience I mean now for me personally I'm late to the game I haven't explored AI tools yet but as we are working on this mood Tracker app and it's back on by the way so I'm excited to share more updates with you going forward but as we are continuing to work on this mood Tracker app I'm very interested in diving into AI tools to see how it can improve and speed up that workflow and I'll definitely share all of my experiences and learnings with you through YouTube here so to wrap it up I want to turn over to you what do you personally think AI will do to iOS development do you agree with me do you disagree with me I look forward to reading your thoughts in the comments below thanks for watching thanks for chatting with me I'll see you in the next video
