hello youtube and welcome back to color with Chris so finally my quest has been updated and Xcode on version 10 now there's a couple of little changes the bigger one is the new theme that is available in that mode and a couple of color changes in font and the text now we have a lot of beginners who are starting to code now following the tutorial we have on the YouTube channel now the tutorials were all recorded with Xcode 9 from a couple of months back and there's not much changes but there's one that is big enough a change to throw off like new beginner say they cannot find a library pane with the uikit elements so as soon as you have in your main storyboard you are looking to add items to your converse now you can see that there's a note selection the library pen has disappeared now Apple decided to move this library pane into this little button right here so if you let's select this one you have the library is going to come back up here and you're going to be able to add your view controller all of your buttons that you need so yeah so it's this little button right here it's not part of the bottomright corner anymore I see it disappeared again on me I'm not particularly fan of this because I like the oldfashioned way to always have it next to me here if I need something can just drag drag right now if I select it code in the background it's gone again so I need to go back and press that button I feel like it's an additional step which I don't need and also another way to get it is from the view panel library and the show library that's right here so shift command alpha library hopefully in a new update of Xcode they give us a choice to actually bring it back in the corner because here there's no way to stitch it or glue it to it so we have Apple please make us an update and give us a chance to put it back there
