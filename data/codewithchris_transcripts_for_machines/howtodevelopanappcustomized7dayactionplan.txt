hey coke crew what's up by far one of the most common questions I get in my inbox is I have app idea of X how do I go about building it or does she of course teach me how to build this app or I have this milliondollar app idea I want to partner with you to build it together and I think where this all comes from is that these people have a vision of what they want to build and accomplish but they have no idea where to start or what road to take to get to that destination so that's why today I want to introduce you to a free email course that I created called a 7day tap action plan and the goal of this email course is basically it to take someone from not knowing anything and all I have is that app idea that vision to having a very concrete list of learning topics that they need to take that they need to learn in order to build that sort of app that they want to create so let's go inside and I want to quickly run you through just how this is achieved in seven days all right so we're inside now and I want to show you what the seven day app action plan is all you have to do is visit the URL in the description or just go to code with Chris comm slash action plan and as I said it's a seven day email course but I wouldn't run you through the seven days and exactly how we can create a personalized learning plan for anybody who wants to create their own app now in day one it's basically an introductory lesson if you know all about Xcode Swift and iOS app development then this is pretty much a wash for you but a lot of people you know they have an app idea they don't even know this stuff so that's what day one is about day two is about the eight steps building any app and that's really the app development process so how you go from and I fleshing out your business requirements to wireframing and then prototyping and design and stuff like that so it kind of walks you through all of those steps and it's basically the steps that we did when we did software consulting for people at my old job as well and I think for a lot of people who haven't built apps professionally they may not know these this app development process now day three is where it's supposed to get really interesting because you can start to build your personalized roadmap and this is what I alluded to before it's actually on a separate domain I'll just tell you right now it's app roadmap dot IO so if you visit this URL you're going to have a sort of like customized wizard that's going to ask you a bunch of questions or rather you go through it and you select which features are going to be in your app so let's run through a couple of things here for example in the design and prototyping session you can say I want to learn app design or I want to hire a designer user accounts is your app going to have let people log in right and you basically select all of the things that you anticipate your app needing and I try to phrase this in as plain English as possible not using any technical jargon and you know navigation is gonna have multiple screens it's gonna have a tab bar it's gonna have a side menu so you just go through it there's a whole bunch of questions but more accurately you can answer these questions the better your results are going to be and also I think this is going to force you to think about your app idea because a lot of people just have this general vision of what they want but they haven't really thought of the finer details and so what I'm asking you such specific questions it's gonna force you to be more specific and have a more concrete definition of what you want to achieve and that's kind of the first step to achieving something right you need to know exactly where you're going and what you want to do and then there's some like mapping features and you basically select everything you need so I'm just gonna randomly go select stuff at the bottom of the page there's a green button to say click here to get your roadmap and it's basically going to give you recommendations for all of the features that you selected it's gonna give you some tips some notes some recommendations on where and how to achieve and learn those things just a little bit of a caveat here first is that I don't want to overwhelm you because I think for a lot of people they're gonna start to get overwhelmed right away with the list of things that they have to learn and you know that's just the reality right if you don't want to accomplish a giant app that's really complex there's a lot to do and there's a lot to learn so I just have a little blurb here telling people that you know you got to take it easy and enjoy the journey and if you go you can download a copy a pdf version of your personalized roadmap if you want and then I have a whole bunch of links for basically everything that you wanted to learn that you said that your app would need places to learn all of those different things so you can go through that and then by the end of that you're gonna have a customized roadmap to achieve your goal then the problem is now you have a map but where do you start and how do you start so days four five six seven is to get you started along that path day four basically tells people about my beginner series that's a great place to start a lot of people have gone through that and kind of gotten their fundamentals at least gotten started got gotten the ball rolling right and day five is about how you can get more experience like after you finish the basic stuff where do you go from there and the gist of it is you just got to build more app so you just gotta go through more tutorials go through more demos get more practice hours in and every time you build one of those like little demos even if the app is kind of dumb and it's really small you're learning something each time you make a mistake and you get through it you're learning something day six is all about databases people always have questions about databases and how do I get one for my app how do I use one well they six will tell you some of the options that are available some of the differences and pros and cons and stuff like that day seven is about creating graphic assets for your app if that's what you're interested in doing right so again this is a free email course and it's not for everybody right if you're wellversed in app development and you're kind of learning the intermediate advanced stuff then to be honest this is probably not going to help you but if you know anybody who's just starting out or they have an app idea but they never really knew how to get started and they don't have the motivation to get started well bring them to this website code with Chris comm slash action plan all right all you have to do is click the green button and then enter in your name and email and it's going to give you one of those emails every day for seven days and that's it so hope this was helpful I hope you can share this with someone who you know wants to build an app and I'll see you guys next time
