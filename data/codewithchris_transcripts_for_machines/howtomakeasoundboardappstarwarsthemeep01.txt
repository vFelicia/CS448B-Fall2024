hey coders what's up hope you guys had a great new year it's the first day back in the office for me but you know I haven't been slacking because I've been creating videos for you guys up until December 31st now it's the first weekday of January and I'm back with a brand new video for you guys we're going to take a break from looking at github libraries and instead spend the next few lessons looking at building an app together remember when I asked you guys to tell me what you guys wanted to see well I was surprised that a whole bunch of people mentioned they wanted to know how to build a soundboard app and since it's a pretty simple app to build I'm going to spend the next few lessons maybe three or four lessons just building this out for you guys and there's probably gonna be enough time to even themed it and so I chose a Star Wars theme now probably would have been better if I did this before the movie came out in December but whatever I actually haven't even seen the movie yet I've been really meaning to and I do enjoy the Star Wars movies I'm not a diehard fan or anything but I do enjoy them but over the holidays my whole family got sick I'm the lone survivor I'm still not sick so I'm thankful for that but pretty much we were home ridden for the holidays did you guys see the movie and did you like it let me know in the comments section below but please don't spoil anything for me because I do intend to see it so don't write a comment like revealing the end or anything like that but anyways the app we're going to build here is a soundboard app it's gonna be very very simple I've got some Star Wars sounds here and let me play them for you and this one's my favorite how creepy is that so I got these sounds from this website The Sound Archive dotcom / Star Wars you can go to the URL as you can see on the screen or I'll put this link in the description below if you are going to use these sounds in an app that you're gonna sell or put in an app store or something I would just check the licensing I didn't check so I'm not sure please do not link to these files they're intended for entertainment purposes so you know I would just look for some information or permission regarding whether or not you could include these sounds in your app but here I'm just using it for the demo to show you guys how to build a soundboard app and this isn't the finished product I just whip this up quickly before recording the video I do want to theme it and style it I think we can spare a lesson to do that so I hope you guys are as excited as I am to build this and I'll see you guys in the next few lessons where we're going to do just that all right talk to you guys tomorrow bye
