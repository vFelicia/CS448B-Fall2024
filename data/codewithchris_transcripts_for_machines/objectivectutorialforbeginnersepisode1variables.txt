hi welcome to code with Chris and this series is about learning objective c now this is a great place to start if you've already got a programming background and you just want to learn Objective C syntax and structure and so on and so forth if you have no programming experience at all this is still a great place to start but you might want to check out the post in the description below that post I introduce people who are nonprogrammers to Objective C so read that first and then watch this video if you've got no programming experience in this video we're going to be talking about some common objectiv C data types and showing you some examples here are some of the common data types that you'll be using short and int are to store integers depends what size you need chars store a single character and for Strings we have a class called NS string uh which we'll introduce in a later episode float and double our for your floating Point decimal numbers again depends on what size you need bull is to store your Boolean type variables so you can assign it no or yes or zero and one accordingly and ID is to store object and class references now it's not strongly typed so you can assign any object to a variable of this type now let's see some of these in action I've whipped up a quick project here to show you guys the variable declaration statements please ignore the warnings on the left hand side here it's xcode's just telling me that I'm declaring these variables but I'm not actually using them anywhere so it's telling me that I should delete them uh but anyways I've declared here basically the the data types that we talked about in the chart before you might notice that in this short variable I've assigned 60,000 to it but in the chart prior I said that the range of values is from 32,000 and something to positive 32,000 well that really depends on on the size that your computer uses so if you're running a 64bit machine then obviously the sizes are going to be uh increased some things I want to bring up are you can add unsigned to your variable and what this does is it drops the whole negative range and it doubles the positive range another thing I want to show you guys is the static keyword so if I add static in front of the variable declaration it's effectively going to turn that into a static variable meaning that the first time this method gets called this variable gets created uh but subsequent times it will not create that variable again and it will uh retain its value that you've set and then there's the constant keyword so if I wanted to declare a variable that I would assign a value and it would never change I could use the const keyword in front of my variable declaration and that would turn that into a constant notice that here with the ID variable declaration I'm assigning it a value of self and self is a keyword to indicate that particular instance so in this case self refers to this instance of the view controller hey guys so that was the first episode of the learn objective c tutorial series and now for your fun fact did you know that over 10% of iPhones in the world are jailbroken so my question to you is do you own one an iPhone or an iPad and did you jailbreak it let me know in the comment section below and I'll post the results in a future video all right see you guys later
