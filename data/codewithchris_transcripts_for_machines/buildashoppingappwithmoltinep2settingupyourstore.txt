hate coders happy Tuesday Chris here with part two of our shopping app series in the previous video I gave you a tour of molten overview of the features and the dashboard well today we're going to get right into building our app starting with creating an account on Moulton and I'll show you guys how to set up your base currency for your store and add a couple of products so when we interact with our Moulton store we're going to be able to retrieve those products through the API so I'm on the Moulton calm home page here and there's a big register button on the right upper right hand corner so that's where I'm going to go to register okay so just a couple of pieces of information here first and last name email address password alright and we're off so I'm not going to provide this information right now skip that getting started we're going to do I OS and a cool little intro we're not going to do this part yet we're going to do that in the next lesson right now we're going to jump straight into our dashboard so let's go up to here from my account let's go into the forge dashboard and here we just specify the information we signed up with and this is going to bring us right into the dashboard of our store like this so depending on where you're doing business there may be a couple of things you want to change off the bat by default your store is in British pounds I want to do a store in US currency so I'm going to go into advanced I'm going to jump into currencies and I'm going to create a brand new currency and then we're going to delete the British pound one so I'm going to click create currency and for code we're going to put in USD for title we'll put in usdollar enabled is yes and for modifier because it's the base currency I'm not going to put anything in here maybe just plus zero so the modifier field just allows us to specify some amount to add subtract or multiply to the product amount if we choose to do so for this currency an example of where you may want to do this is if you want to charge the customer something extra for transacting in a certain currency because maybe your payment gateway or bank charges you extra fees for transacting in that currency and then next we have exchange rate so because I want the u.s. dollar to be our base currency I'm going to put one there but if you wanted to display your store product prices in multiple currencies you would create different currencies and then you can specify your own exchange rate so it will update the price based on the exchange rate and I want to make this the default currency so I'm going to say yes and then I'm going to hit submit oh I forgot one thing format field is required so there is a little tab over here where you can specify how you want this currency to be formatted so here's an example because the currency symbol may be different and so you have the flexibility to customize that here so ours is just going to be dollar sign curly brace price and close the curly brace so the decimal point the symbol we want to use is a dot and the thousand point comma and I'm not going to specify any rounding here but you can do rounding like this okay so we're going to submit that and we've created our currency so let's go back to the list of currencies now we can see that our US dollar is the default one and I'm going to delete the British pound one and then now we're going to go on and create some products in our inventory so no products found that's expected I'm going to hit create product up here and let's say that I'm an authorized Apple reseller so to go with the theme let's sell some Apple products let's say we have a MacBook Pro and this slug is going to be part of the product URL so status I'm going to leave as draft but when we want to hit live then we just change this dropdown to live description great laptop category we have to select one and by default there's an uncharacterrized so we're going to do that but we can create more categories under here and we then can add multiple categories next we've got brand but this is an optional field I don't have any brands set up but again you can set up something here on the left hand side for the different brands and I guess for us it would just be Apple for collection if you wanted to create different collections of products for example if you're a clothing retailer you could do something like a fall collection winter collection that sort of thing you can set up your collections here as well okay so for SKU that's just going to be our product identifier so I'm just going to call it MVP and for price let's say $1,400 stock level we've only got ten and it's in stock and catalogue only you have an option of nowhere yes if you selected yes then this product is only for show in the catalog and it cannot be added to cart so I'm going to select no because I want the customers to be able to buy it I also have instead of any tax bands and you would do that under the advanced option here so I'm just going to leave it at default and then lastly you can specify all of these measurements and the weight and require shipping or not so I'm going to say yes alright so finally we're going to hit submit and create our first product there's also a couple of other options here if you wanted to add images to your product you can do so in this tab right here and you can just drag and drop your images there so one of the things I found when I was working with Moulton just setting up some demos and some tests is that their support is really great so if you have a question about any of these fields or how to do anything with your store simply reach out there's this little button here you can always reach out and get help pretty quickly I'm going to go back to products I'm going to add another one so that we have something to see let's call this the iPad pro actually we need to set that one to live so let's just set this one to live right now we need to do that for the category uncharacterized I don't even know how much this thing is I think it's $1,000 okay so let's go back to the products and let's switch the MacBook Pro to live first before we forget there it is and let's just create one more maybe it's $2,000 or something like that alright so we've got three products in our store which is going to be sufficient for our demo a couple of other things before we end this video under advance we're probably going to want to set up a gateway if you're going to be running your store live for our demo we're not going to set up an actual gateway here but just to show you how easy it is I actually use on my website stripe and all you have to do is take the API key from stripe and put it into here and I also use PayPal Express and you can configure that here so all these details is available through your PayPal account and you just have to fill them out here to enable this gateway another thing that we didn't do and just to mention that they have a ton of gateway so chances are you will find the one that you used in here as well I'm going to go to the settings and change my time zone so Eastern is the one that I'm in alright so now we've set the time zone the currency we've setup some products and if this were your live store you'd probably want to set up some gateways and shipping rules as well if you're actually shipping products out so you could do that through here and taxes if you're going to be remitting taxes so we're going to go back to the dashboard and under my account here in the next lesson we're going to actually take the API keys we're going to be needing these guys for my store in order to integrate the moulton libraries into our Xcode project so you'll see that in the next lesson I hope you guys are setting up your own store to follow along and in the next lesson we're going to set up our Xcode project so I'll see you there bye for now you
