hey coders what's up I hope you guys are having a great week so far Chris here and in this lesson I'm going to show you guys how to set up and install cocoa pods now if you don't know what cocoa pods is or you've never used it then this video is for you because cocoa pods allows you to manage and use thirdparty code in your Xcode project and it's widely used by anyone who is building apps right now even the large companies who are building the bigname apps so in this lesson you will learn how to install and set it up and you're only going to have to do this once and then over the next few days I'll show you guys some of the musthaves thirdparty libraries for those of you guys who have used cocoa pods before let me know in the comments section what your favorite libraries are and then maybe in the future I can even cover it for everyone here so originally I showed how to set up cocoa pods in a video in the shopping app series but it's buried inside that video I really want to pull it out and draw attention to it because it's really important and useful for anybody who's doing app development so this is that video first of all let's install cocoa pods you're in luck because I just got a brandnew shiny iMac and I don't have cocoa pods installed so we're going to be able to go through that together now alternatively a couple of great guides to install cocoa pods can be found on the official cocoa pod site under guides getting started and then under installation and another great one is on ray Wonderlic site how to use cocoa pods with swift so I'll add these two links in the description below ok so what you're going to do first is open up terminal so you can either press command spacebar and search for terminal and open it up that way or if you go to your launch pad it is I believe in utilities or other sorry and it's this one right here terminal so when you click that it shows a little window like this and all you have to do is type sudo gem install cocoa pods now hit enter and it's going to ask you for your password after you enter in your password it might take a little while to get started as it did for me I had to wait about maybe 40 seconds before I started to see anything on the screen but I just cut out that waiting time in the editing so you didn't see any of it but when it's finished installing you should see something like this the next thing you want to do is type pod setup verbose and that's going to let you see the progress as it's setting things up so with those two commands we are done setting up cocoa pods and if you're not familiar with working in terminal or this kind of looks complicated don't worry because you only need to set up cocoa pods once and then after that as you're going to see soon it's very simple to set up for each new Xcode project that you do so there you have it pretty easy to set up right and you only have to do that once now in the coming days I'll introduce you guys to all of the popular thirdparty libraries that are really handy to have in your Xcode project and I'll show you guys how to set it up and use it using cocoa pods so thanks for watching if you know someone who hasn't heard about cocoa pods or hasn't used it before please send them this video and if you found it useful please share it thank you so much for watching again and I'll see you guys tomorrow
