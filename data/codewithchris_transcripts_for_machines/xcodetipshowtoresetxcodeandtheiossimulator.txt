hello in this video I have a very helpful Xcode tip to share with you guys and that's how to reset Xcode and reset the simulator so why do we want to do that well sometimes when you run your project and it doesn't connect to the simulator it's giving you some error or maybe your app doesn't run at all did you know that it could be a bug in Xcode or an error in Xcode and not necessarily your programming or your code or your storyboard so it's really quick to do and it's worth a try when you're running into problems anyways so to reset the simulator you have it in your foreground go up to this iOS simulator menu go to reset content and settings and then when it asks you just hit reset and what that does is it resets the similar to the original state okay so it takes a while to do that but usually after that finishes I just quit Xcode quit the simulator and kind of restart everything another way to reset your project is go up to the product menu here and select clean and what that does is it cleans out all of the built assets and code from your project the last time you ran it because the because Xcode will only recompile your code if it's changed or only the bits that have changed so sometimes if you want to start from a absolute clean slate then go to product and then clean here and finally one last thing that you can do is go up to window in the Xcode menu and go to projects and you can reset or delete rather the derived data for your project on the lefthand side here you can select which project and you know this is the one that I've got open here and then select delete derived data and what this is is it indexes all of your files and you know this output down here that stuff is all the logs and everything you can just delete it clear it and the next time it's going to rebuild it see it's already there right you can close Xcode and then you can start it again and so those are three ways for you to reset Xcode and reset your simulator and that might just do the trick if it's an xcode related error and not your code so I hope that was helpful for you guys and I'll see you guys in the next video
