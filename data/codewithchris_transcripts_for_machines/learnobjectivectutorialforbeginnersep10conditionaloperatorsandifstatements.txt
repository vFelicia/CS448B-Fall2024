hey guys welcome to another episode of code with Chris and today we're going to be talking about conditional operators within if statements so we're going to expand on what you learned in the last video about if statements alright let's get started okay so in the last video we talked about if statements and in this video i wanted to show you some more examples of different kinds of if statements using conditional operators now you can download this Xcode project from the annotation on the screen that you see right now or in the link below so what are conditional operators for example if you know once again I have the age variable and let's say I wanted to have a condition where I wanted to do something if the age was 5 or 10 now I could do something like if h is equal to 0 then do something and then down here I could have something like this do something and what would happen here is first it would run through this if statement and if it you know if it equals 0 do this if it wasn't to equal to 0 then I would check if it was equal to 10 now this would be the worst way to write it I could instead use the else if like we learned last time so first they would check if it equals to 0 if it if it's not then it would filter down here but what I meant to actually say was do something do same do the same code the better way to write this would be something like this if age is equal to 0 or h is equal to 10 do something because I'm intending to do the same code in both branches I can use these two pipes as an or claws too chained together to conditions so this reads if age is 0 or 10 you can also do conditions on multiple variables so let's say I have you know I have another variable called brothers age I could do something like you know what i want to write is if if age is zero and brothers age is 10 then it would become something like this that two ampersand signs together equates to an end clause let me just highlight those for you and here is an example of checking against two variables now you can get even more complicated and chained together various ends or ores and do something like you know if age is five and brothers age is five or age is six and brothers age is seven now let's make it clear here I want to execute some sort of code if either this part is true if ages five and brothers ages 5 or if this is true age of six and brothers age of seven so you would first start off by writing something like this now that's the first condition now you put it in it in its own set of brackets and that basically groups those two things together and now the other two condition sorry the other condition is if age is six and whether eight mother's age of seven this code will get executed if either this condition is true or this condition is true so there you have it with the conditional and boolean operators your code can now make decisions that's pretty exciting so until next time talk to you guys later bye you you
