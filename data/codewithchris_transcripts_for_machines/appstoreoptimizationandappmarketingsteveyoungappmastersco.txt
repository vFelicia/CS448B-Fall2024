hey guys what's up that's Chris here you guys are in for a treat last week I got to speak with Steve Young from Matt masters coke and he took me on a behindthescenes step by step App Store optimization process for my app magic hat now the cool thing is that normally he charges his agency clients thousands of dollars to go through this process and you're gonna get to see all of this for free have you choose your keywords how you optimize your app store listing questions like doing keywords in the description matter the text on the screenshots matter things like that in addition to that he reveals some of his profitable marketing campaigns that he does for his clients and how to do them such as the paid to free campaign and the Apple feature and more so you're gonna get to learn all of that in the upcoming interview I hope you guys enjoy here we go hey guys what's up it's Chris here and I'm here today with a special guest my good friend Steve from at masters Co and he's here today to share with us some of the his insights and expertise on the magic hat app listening that we've been looking at that we've been updating and that we are almost ready to submit so we're gonna let Steve take it away here cool Chris well we could talk about all marketing strategies related so I just picked ASO because I felt when I looked at the app I thought it would be something that would be worthwhile for you but then we can get into some of the other details about like what else you can do besides just ASO sure yeah all right so for those who are welcome guys for those who aren't familiar ASO just means App Store optimization which is SEO for the App Store and essentially what I did here is I put this spreadsheet now this is a patented app master spreadsheet I know so you Chris you could share this with your audience later on but this spreadsheet is something we put together and walks you through all the different strategies that we've talked about on our YouTube channel and our blog as well but essentially what I try to do is compile a long list of keywords now for you Chris just for this demonstration I just put a few keywords so the first thing I did Chris was I actually went into a penny and I put in your app it's completely free I put in your app and in the keywords field I wanted to see which keywords you are currently ranking for so right now your top ranking keyword according to a penny is preschool speech and then peekaboo animals and so forth so you know I'm gonna be honest with you Chris not really they're not ranking really well right preschool speech is 71 and then peekaboo animals is 116 so it's pretty low but what I did what was able what I was able to do because of this was like Oh peekaboo is obviously keywords that I I didn't think about so that I ended up throwing that keyword into this big old spreadsheet yeah okay so what we want to do is really compile a long list of keywords and also what I did was I did I just used the app store all right so everybody and then I put in I went to the app store and I put in peekaboo here's what I did right can you see that well Chris yeah okay cool so I just put in peekaboo and I let Apple tell me what it was Auto suggestion so a lot of these peekaboo related terms are because of what Apple said okay so I put in zebra and elephant because those are the first three animals that were given away for free so we have zebra elephant and parrot I put those in there and I thought about phonics related terms too so again I put phonics into the app store and then the phonics related terms are what Apple Auto suggested meaning there's pretty high decent traffic going for them or really relevant keywords and then everything else so I also I want to highlight this too Chris although there's not a lot of traffic volume for this but think outside the box this is inside the box I would say we're all inside the box we're thinking in the app store we're thinking directly related to what this app is about and then outside the box would be what other things would be people searching for so obviously Sesame Street but pretty competitive I thought Melissa and Doug I know we're both fathers it sounds like okay I got a lot of Melissa and Doug stuff so start thinking about different brand names that kids might be looking for her parents might be looking for ice that might have decent volume and low competition then it might be worth ranking for so with Melissa and Doug obviously the the search volume isn't high but what I love about these when you think outside the box is the competition is really really low so a lot of times when you start thinking outside the box you're gonna find some you're gonna like whoa really good call search traffic and very low competition you might be competing with one other app Sesame Street is a bad example because they've got ton of apps but you might find a brand name that hasn't really gone into the app space but has but people are searching for that brand name that's what we're looking for here okay and the traffic score on the leftmost column right there is that out of ten or five or yeah well so I'll go through this column stuff and this is the ASO exercise that we normally do for our clients but essentially once we compile these keywords we put them into our two favorite tools and what we found are the two most accurate tools so sensor tower and mobile action and I found that if you had to pick one so to the audience because we pay for both if you had to just pick one I would pick global action I found that to be the most accurate out of all the ones that I've tested out mmhmm but I guess all relatively new sorry to interrupt but I I when I originally published this app I knew about app Annie and sensor tower but I never knew about mobile action yeah it wasn't until a lot of our a lot of people a lot of my friends started saying hey have you checked out mobile action it's pretty cool and it took like three or four different people we said have you checked out mobile I came for me like all right let me check out my blocking because I was like you man I was like oh it's only cents at our I'm just gonna check out since it timer right yeah so yeah feel free to interrupt anytime but the the traffic score it is out of ten and the higher the better all right difficulty it's out of ten again now you want the lower the better so low difficulty means okay there's a high likelihood that you're gonna rank search core same thing it's out of a hundred this time because mobile action goes twenty like down to five zero I've seen some zeros but zero all the way to 100 and then chance you want a high score so it's usually how the chance that you'll likely be ranking high for that term so 100% means all right there's good pretty good chance there wouldn't be top five for this particular term so you know when I was looking at your app it's like okay the first potential growth channel that I would look at is App Store optimization and that's why I put this spreadsheet together for you Chris and what I did was so you know the keyword length is just I have this here because you know with iOS 11 you're gonna be limited to 30 characters in the app name and then you have the subtitle which is index as well and then you have the keyword field and so whenever I'm like I've put it together I'm like oh I have four more characters left this field allows me to see which keywords have four characters than it might be looking for nicely and then number four the yeah go yeah for the viewers out there when they're compiling this list of keywords for their own app like how big of a list should they shoot for I would so I'll just tell you what I normally shoot for I try to get anywhere from 80 and sometimes you go all the way to 300 but I would say like 40 or 50 or good because that really makes you think through what else you can because we're not even gonna fill fulfill the 100 characters all the characters I would say like when let's say 160 right just 30 30 and 100 with just these this lists mmm so we're not gonna fulfill at all and then I it's gonna force you to think outside the box so what I normally do Chris is I'll look at some of your competitors and I'll see which keywords are ranking well for and that only Spurs some thought about what other keywords might be able to target okay cool cool so the apps is just the number of apps ranked is your actual current keyword ranking for these particular keywords I see so normally if you were ranking really well I would sort this list and I would say okay well I don't want to lose this rank for Chris so let's see what the top ranking keywords are and then I would go into target is what I want to which keywords are one target so looking at this list Chris what I normally do is I I sort by chance just to see which keywords have the highest chance scores because I find that you know like mobile action is a little bit more accurate when it comes to difficulty and so what we find here is Picabo Wilde is pretty good and when I when you actually see that both keyword tools are telling you low competition and that's a keyword that we got to go after so for example what I'm really finding aren't there are two keywords that really stand out as a high chance for you to rank well Picabo Wilde and Animal Planet okay how how attached are you to the magic hat happening well it's kind of embedded into the app but not like I wouldn't say completely completely attached because it's not like I have a whole catalog or series of apps based on okay magic hat although that was kind of the eventual idea okay I want to hear what your thoughts are so if my thoughts would be if you're not completely attached to it then I might just because I want magic in there because you seem to like it I might put in magic so I'm putting in a new happening for you magic animal peekaboo or magic where's there's peekaboo animals right mmm I see that that kind of tells you a little more about what the app is about right tells you a little bit more about what the app is about and also has keywords that were really targeting mmhmm right so it could be magic and well let's say you wanted to go is it gonna be all peekaboo type of apps yeah that was kind of the thought okay perfect I love it then so I'll do magic peekaboo and then wild animals or wild animal all right let's play that while animals put animals so what I'm doing here obviously is peekaboo wild I want that's the that becomes the keyword that we're targeting right it has a high likelihood that we're gonna rank well for it so I'm putting them together and I'm still having trying to stick to your brand of magic so magic pinky boom and now I'm going after this and now you see Animal Planet being one right so very here's another the way I would do this would be so there's a trick where if you repeat a keyword that you're really targeting mmm twice in the app name and in the subtitle for this is for iOS 11 now it tends to help you rank well for it so I might go like all right Animal Planet it's probably too specific because Animal Planet I think is a trademark might be a trademark term but something like this you know or I was trying to put like explore right like explore animal explore Animal Planet peekaboo something like that but essentially what I'm trying to do is have Animal Planet and then repeat peekaboo again because that's the keyword that I'm really trying to target right and is it something that you want to actively avoid trademarks I mean like Melissa and Doug or Animal Planet I don't want to kind of have that blatantly in my list thing or I don't want to blatantly have it for me personally so for example I I was ranking really well for another like very similar app of yours but it was a phonics app and I wanted to go hooked on phonics so I called it you know phonics ABC fun oh no phonics DJ or ABC phonics and then I said get kids hooked on alphabet sound now this is when we could go really long app names and so I still had hooked on phonics in the app name but they just weren't completely together I miss max them so kind of like this what I'm doing now is I don't want Animal Planet together because then people like Oh Amy I know what you're doing but I might try to weave it in so that it's in the same sentence on that face that's cool that it would still kind of rank for that even though the words aren't together yeah awesome so this gives us what we want peekaboo wild and then we have animal twice we have peekaboo twice and then we have Animal Planet together now we don't just for the list don't viewers listeners we don't need to repeat what we're going after so generally what I do in this target tab is I'll put in where I put so US title and then I'll put this in like US subtitle just so I know I can come back where these keywords ended up falling in and now you're not there we use this right so if I we wanted to use let's say I wanted to target Animal Jam I could just put jam on here in the keyword field right so now then I put us keyword hmm all right and then this is u.s. title so wherever it is now I want to go after ABC phonics so I would put ABC phonics in here and notice that I'm not putting one of the big newbie mistakes I made was I put spaces so I put like this this just just because I thought it looked cooler which is Jam comma space ABC don't do that just but Jam comma ABC comma phonics phrases like this one last point what I'm going after phrases there's I don't have data to tell you which way is right or not but I tend to just keep it together cuz I find that ok I'll just keep this together it's like I send Doug for example I'll just put together now one of the things that is not very intuitive about this and it's awesome that you're showing us this because if let's say I wanted to target animal jam and this kind of goes against SEO and even YouTube tags like I would literally put animal jam somewhere in my article or my video tag but in this list thing they're completely not together but it still work yes right right and if you wanted to get aggressive and this is just generally what I do because Animal Jam has a really high search score so when I see discrepancies like this like Animal Jam mobile action saying chant score is really high meaning low difficulty Center towers saying pretty high difficulty so Chris like anything that's highlighted this is my I what I've deemed what Steve Young is deemed to be low competition that's anything under 3/4 Center tower and anything above 70 on mobile action but when I let's say I want to get aggressive on this right so I'm gonna so the us app store actually indexes the Spanish Mexico localization meaning if you put English keywords in there you can rank well for them so this is a great example in a great segue if I wanted to rank really well for that term I would put this I would hide here and then I might get aggressive here too and I just put Animal Planet right because then most likely nobody's gonna see this unless you're in Mexico but in the US which a lot of people are targeting nobody's gonna see it right but you will help index so if I have like the same listen Doug I want to get aggressive with it which I wouldn't suggest we do it because but I would put that into I would repeat it in the app name or the subtitle of the Spanish Mexico localization now I don't have data to support this and I frankly don't care if I have ever get the data support things but it's essentially because I know the biggest weight from an algorithms perspective comes from the app name and the subtitle so I want the key words that are really targeting to be in the app name and subtitle and I don't you know like and so certain key words that I really really want to target but they might be you know trademarked or something I'll like like that I'll hide it in the Spanish Mexico localization and I'll just put them into the app name and the keywords because my thought process is Apple is saying alright us app name subtitle keywords that's the biggest weight and then Spanish Mexico app name subtitle keywords have the next that's what I'm thinking the algorithm is saying in terms of priority and while we're still on the ASO front is this kind of like a oneanddone deal or is this like a monitor edit take some out put anyone's in type of deal yeah the latter so do this first initial optimization and I'm pretty much guarantee you Chris and that if you follow this track then we will see an increase in downloads and then after that let's say like this would be a good example well let's say we went after pronounce and or no not maybe not pronounce that's not a good example but let's say we went after Animal Jam right we try to optimize it maybe you get a little bit more aggressive next time and you put it into the subtitle or maybe you even put it into the US app name but you're still like 30 your ranking 30 that's the best you're gonna do so you try to optimize it because you know that one while mobile action says it's low competition since you're Thomas sensor tower saying it is very competitive keyword you're like I don't forget it so now you're gonna save it you're like I forget Jam I'm gonna remove it completely I'm gonna go after different keywords mmm because pronounce is decent right like there's actually good there's actually good like it's barely on the verge of being low competition sensor tower wise and I need 96 is a really high score so I would put that in there as well and you might reorganize it so after you do this optimization you're feeling Steve I'm I'm number 24 pronounce your number 209 cuz it might be in the key word somewhere I'm number 20 now hold that's great now let's go after this so now this might be like pronounced animal sounds right right now you're like okay well Animal Planet where I'm worried ranking really high for it maybe I put it somewhere else something like this right this is a little bit too long but something like this okay I see just that but you know like this this might be actually a better way and then we go after Planet Animal Planet here one more thing about I just thought about description wise what about that so iOS duh they don't right now they don't really index the description I the results that we've been able to achieve for our clients so anywhere on average 50 really like 400% we been able to do it without touching the description oh wow yeah that's that's on iOS on Google Play it is really important so I would say pay attention to it like it especially for certain things that you're going after right here I'm sorry I looked at your description but things like pronounced you might want to put in there you know like fallen eggs you might want to start putting the keywords that we're targeting in there just because Apple is now starting to show signs that they're probably going to start indexing the description because right now we can update the description anytime we don't need a new build but we need a new build for app names of title and keywords but right in the future with iOS 11 description is gonna be one of those things that you need an update for then the description might be a good place to write for the people who are potentially going to download the app right you're trying to entice them to go ahead and hit that download button yeah and screenshots so what about text on the screen shots does that count for anything based on what experience I think it's very small like I think about the biggest in terms of I get these questions and that's a great question but I think it's it makes a slight different it's just one of these things that's like oh it's kind of nice to have when it's like I guess the best analogy would be steak if you're making a killer steak and you start with the great beef and the cut you're gonna have a killer steak long as you don't you're right and then if you add a little bit seasoning just adds a little bit more and that's what I would think of the words on your screen shots because Google did start saying that here we're gonna start indexing those words just because Google is like very advanced than Apple and I would say the biggest bang for your buck is gonna come from the app name and the subtitle and the keywords and all that it's awesome let's move on to the the next part then so one thing that looked at when I was looking at your app was you need some reviews right so even if you get some friends anybody yeah right you yourself I've seen a lot of people who really their own review but you want to get at least 5 in there because then it shows some rankings and because you talked a lot about development Chris you know there is a you probably know better what the right word is but a reviews API the Apple has and that has seen some really good results from people right and so I would put that in there where Apple has some limitations on how often you can show it but it does make it a lot easier for people to leave reviews because they don't have to leave the app store anymore they just put 5 stars hit submit you don't have to write a long a review so you will see an increase in reviews that way so that's one other thing that I would do I love your screenshots you know I love it I think the the things that I would change are probably I would probably show like some a little bit more of like maybe the text talked about make it a little bit bigger and talk more about like what the benefit would be to the parents so right now it looks like a screenshot of the main menu the first moon shot and then the second screenshot talks about like tap the Hat colorful it could be just screenshots that you're pulling from the app and which is fine but what I really loved about your app is the graphics are really well done and so I might move the zebra one to the second one and then make the text a little bit bigger be like word breakdown in pronunciation so that people can read it a little bit more but I would put that as a second one because you know as parents that's one will want to see good graphic because we want our kids to be engaged and it's like what's the benefit of this app versus somebody else and I like the fact that you broke out those words that really spoke to me as a parent like oh that screenshot spoke to me out of the five so in the first screen shot I think is nice like boom you know kind of get sucked me into it and the second screenshot would be hey this is what we do this is why I work great and you might even lead with the first one I think it's strong enough to the zebra one is strong enough to be the first one to the next thing is so are there any paid it you know purchases in this it's just all completely free so you want people to buy the paid one yeah that was the idea because of the whole just paid like inapp purchases with parents you know and kids playing around with it yeah I don't know I don't have any data or any opinion on this I saw I opinion but I don't know how big data back it up and so usually I hesitate to say anything unless I have the data but I would think that it probably comforts better if you just had a net purchase in there you know people used to do this where they would have the light in the pro version and then they would try to crosspromote those two I think it works just fine but I I think having the inapp purchases and the reason why I'm telling you to go that in a purchase route is it allows you to run this campaign that I love the most it's called the pay to free campaign and you can run this with your paid app but you're obviously not gonna make any money off of this but what I would say is you give three animals away for free maybe it's ten for another like pack you have packs different packs and then another package for all of them so you have like three different packages and then the what I would then do is make one of the first packs free maybe like your least performing pack make that memory get pressed for it on app advice and say hey Tyler I'm making this inapp free purchase free for a couple of days love for you to cover it he will cover it and if he doesn't you come back to me Chris because I got a good really good relationship with him but you will cover it and what we seen is that there's thousands of downloads that happen and you actually see an increase in inapp purchases for your other ones just by making that one free I see yeah so it's a really great campaign it's something you can run every quarter on what each every single app mmhmm because Tyler doesn't want to cover too many at the same time all the time but I have a past client who does this every single week like if you see his if you go on a pin vise and you look at that you'll see his apps one of his apps cuz he's got a portfolio and Chris as you build up your portfolio you can start doing this every single week right because what happens is there's actually more downloads for your other apps too so there's this like natural organic crosspollination where people check out your other apps and they see in a boost in downloads yeah I mean that I always knew that was kind of like the endgame like you need a catalog of apps that you can cross promote and you can bundle and sell in bundles too so yeah I'm on a ped virus can free that's the one you're talking about yeah mmhmm that's that's where you want to be because I've done that I've done some case studies where I say here's what happen to my apps when I pitch a device here's what happened when I just made it free and didn't tell anybody not even Chris and like the downloads was thirty thousand when app advice covered it and like two hundred went out the Vice didn't cover it and this is why I totally told you about the reviews because if you read through app advices policies they want you to have a few reviews like you have them average three star rating mmhmm to be Mitch so you can actually do this on your paid version of magic hat and get some reviews you've got one right now but maybe get a few more and then like what I would do is just make it free for a little bit tell a few friends hey guys it's free can you please leave review I really need five to show up and then make it paid again and then pitch app advice and say hey Tyler I'm making this free free from tomorrow it's only free for a couple of days would love for you to cover it and then make it free get long as he covers it you'll get that boost in downloads and then make it paid right away like just make it free for a day make it paid again we did this for another client where his was twelve dollar app Chris but he did thirty thousand downloads Wow and then you mean extra thousand dollars just because we made it free for just one day that he ended up spiking the actual like Travel category I think it was that he made 27 Travel category and I forget it was probably I think it is probably under the paid but then he got a lot more money because he hit that chart and the press came from people ended up buying it so he made $1000 she was pretty happy with that cool now looking at this I want to ask you you know percentagewise if you had to focus your time would it be on ASL or would it be more on like marketing the app from external sources contacting press that sort of thing because it seems like there's a lot to do on that side more more so than that yeah so side right well I look at the app so if I look at first and foremost from an ESO perspective I know that's the it's controllable right if I do a little bit more homework if I put an effort Chris I can get you more downloads that's contributing more now PR I can put in the same down to effort I can do everything put so much passion into it but it's not controllable meaning I can still pitch that reporter and they'll be like oh great job Steve but they say no so what I found is PR when I think about that I don't focus too much on it anymore just because I haven't seen a huge amount of downloads coming from it now if you're thinking about like raising another round of funding or BD business development that is when PR would come into play but I would rather spend my energy on something that I can control and see the results and with PR you're just gonna kind of like amplify Stu but you're just gonna see a bump and then down right whereas ASO you see bump and then hopefully you optimize again you see bump and then you see more right so it becomes sustainable whereas PR just goes up it'll probably go higher than P then ASO but could come right back down yeah it's like a quick win yeah it's like a vanity thing oh hey I was covered on all this stuff now for kids apps I would say it is nice because as parents look to these awards right for some reason I don't know if you feel this way for some reason the fact that they want some silly reward means something to me so I'm like okay it's worth checking out right it's like voted best mom app or whatever it is like okay let me try this app out and so with kids apps I might try to go like featured on Common Sense Media or iPhone mom loves it something like that just to say on the to help my ASO in my conversion just having a screen shot essentially the other thing I mean I focus on is Apple features so this is where I I like Apple I'll just think about this morning but if you think about PR you there's like so many publications that you have to reach out to right and you have to impress and get them to say yes right yeah and so with Apple it's like trying to date or just like finding the person that you love and just going so aggressive on her and trying to get her to say yes right with Apple like you can make that with PR like if you think about them side by side Apple I can try to woo her if I get her to war that's gonna me like millions and millions of downloads a romantic life long life a folded love but if I go PR it's just like was that was a great date but now you're gonna have to find the next PR provocation the next lady the next lady and so I rather focus my energy on pitching Apple and what I would do for you is it I think you had a great graphics is you know like do the go the normal process apps or promotion or App Store comm slash promote and then we did another video before where we try to figure out who the right app store manager is full at Apple to pitch and so if you tell that good story you just have to get one person to say yes and that would lead to tremendous amounts of downloads so I would go after that because it doesn't hurt like there's no they can just say no and then what happens like nothing else you're you're back at where you normally were in is the App Store feature thing of only four new apps coming out like before you've published your app for usually four games there I think they're doing Apple is starting to highlight older games now but they all seem to be the same ones just like a different rotation like I've seen this Apple thank you but for kids apps or non games it's fine it's usually when you've got a good update or they it hits her radar it gets on their radar somehow and we got one of our clients we got featured it was a learn Chinese for kids like completely niche right Chris we got him featured by Apple and the in the US and I think of some other countries to be US and Canada maybe but essentially like I didn't think it would happen but we got it we help them get future and that sounds like an app that I need right now really right good yeah I've got a lot to go on Steve so I'm gonna put this into practice right away and we're going to submit this magic hat up in a couple of weeks so do you have any more words for the audience you have any closing words I would just say look there was a lot covered here start with the ASO I would say to try sign up for that mobile action I would just say start with that try to find these keywords that Kris and I have done where relevant to your app and low competition decent traffic and once you start at that and try to optimize its bits and pieces and you start getting the ball rolling a little bit then you're like home what else you know so get wet your appetite a little bit and just start with the ASO and then start thinking about what other channels you can you can work on cool and what if some people want to learn more about marketing ASO where can they find you or work and they learn more Chris I'm on YouTube you're an inspiration to me man that's like holy cow I've liked your channel before you know I've actually heard people who came in is like I saw you and Chris no I'm so if you go to app master geo you'll find all the information I have a podcast that chris has been on I've got a YouTube channel and the blog tune I interview a bunch of guess that's how I got started in spaces I just started interviewing some of my heroes in space to really learn from them and then started using what they taught and then started teaching back and then modifying obviously a little bit to improving on my learnings yeah actually that podcast is like gold yeah so guys check go check that out Steve runs a pretty frequent podcast anywhere he interviews people who have had a lot of success on the App Store and with their apps so you can learn a lot from that okay so thanks so much Steve and I guess I will let you know how things go when I submit my app yes dude I got a no I'm guaranteeing you I'm guaranteeing you there's gonna be enough tick all right yeah all right thanks take it easy Steve make sure is
