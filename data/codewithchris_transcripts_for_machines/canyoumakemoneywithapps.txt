hey guys it's Chris here and today I'm going to give you my opinion on the question can you make money with apps and I stress the word opinion because that's exactly what it is everyone's going to have a different perspective on this based on their own experiences so this is my take on the question so now on to the question can you make money with apps and my answer is yes Apple said earlier this year that developers made twenty billion dollars in 2016 in absolu that's twenty billion dollars so why aren't we all rich well if you scroll through the top grossing apps on the App Store you'll notice that all the apps are produced by companies or game studios or at least most of them are so if you're asking this question from the perspective of a company or games video I would say yes but unfortunately most of the time I'm being asked this question by a beginner who has no programming experience and they're trying to see if they should invest the effort to learn how to build apps in order to turn a profit on the App Store and unfortunately many of these people let's just say that they're not in the best financial situation and they're looking at this as an opportunity to maybe turn their fortunes around now unfortunately I have to be realistic with them and a lot of the time it comes as disappointing news or kind of the cold hard truth if you know what I'm saying if you're asking from that perspective where you're a beginner and you're trying to build apps to make money on the App Store I would still say yes but you know there there are certain hurdles you're going to have to pass and it's going to take a lot of time so there are independent developers who do very well on the App Store also known as indie devs but that's definitely the exception and not the norm these indie developers have the programming part down pat they're not worried about whether or not they can build this app what they're worried about and what they're trying to figure out is how to get exposure on the App Store maybe get featured on the front page by Apple or maybe rank highly for certain keywords in the App Store or maybe get impressed their app or getting their app for game reviewed by review sites and review favorably and coming up with a business or a marketing plan for their app you'll notice that all of these things have nothing to do with programming right just because the App Store is so saturated with apps the idea is that if you can do some good marketing for your app and if your app is decent and it's got the right cooks to keep people coming back that your app will build up momentum like a snowball and your app will continue getting downloads through wordofmouth or being viral so you can see as a beginner who has no programming experience you know what they must overcome me first of all you have to learn to code and then you have to keep building apps until you get good at it right because your first few apps or maybe your first 1020 apps aren't going to be very good and you're going to have to keep at it and you're going to have to have that persistence because you're going to fail and you're going to build apps that you know you know what a decent polish looks like in your head but you're not going to be able to get there initially so you can have to get there first and then next you're going to have to figure out the app store and how to get exposure and learn marketing app marketing learning the business side of things and all of that stuff so when a beginner asks me can they make money with apps I say yes but I tell them all of these things and you know I I don't want to sugarcoat things I don't want people signing up for my courses or learning with me thinking that you know they're going to be the next app millionaire you know that's definitely not the treat that's going to take a lot of work in a lot of effort to maybe potentially get there if you have the persistence and you put in the work so I've actually tried to make money on the App Store with a friend I took a stream and it took us three months to build this app called magic hat is it was a children's app and at the time we basically modeled it after a successful children's app that was already ranking high on the App Store and we thought you know the graphics for this app isn't very good we could do something better and what we created in three months was I felt was better and look better more polished but it didn't do very well and that's because we weren't familiar with the marketing and business side of things and part of us knew that this was just part of the learning curve part of the learning process that we'd have to build more apps and then if we built up a portfolio we could cross link and cross promote the apps and stuff like that but you know pouring three months of effort into an app only to see it not do so well it was genuinely disappointing and it's tough to recover from that so I actually I needed to take a break from doing it because to me it was just it felt like a lot of effort and I had such high hopes for it it didn't meet the expectations I needed to take a break from it and we kind of just never got back into building that second app so that was kind of my experience with trying to make money on the app store and later on I found out that app that we modeled with after it had other channels of marketing it was actually being featured on the back of children's books in the bookstore so that might have been driving its downloads as well so that's what I'm saying right you have to have a decent app but at the same time you have to have some sort of business or marketing plan for it to get exposure and to get you know reach that critical tipping point where it either travels through word of mouth you know all your friends are using it they're telling you about it it kind of goes viral right so maybe I'll tell you guys the lessons learned and kind of like how we went from idea you know through all that process to launching the app maybe I'll tell you guys that story in another video the story of magic hat so anyways that's my opinion on the question can you make money with apps I want to hear from you have you made money with apps if you have or if you haven't let me know your experience in the comments section below and if you haven't published an app yet let me know what your motivation is for learning how to build apps is it to make money or is it just a hobby or is it for you know a school project or business let me know in the comment section below thanks for watching guys and I'll see you guys next time bye for now
