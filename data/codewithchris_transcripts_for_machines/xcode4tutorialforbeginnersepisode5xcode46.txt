hey guys welcome to another episode of Code with Chris in the last xcode episode we talked about uh adding files to your excode project in this one we're going to talk about groups versus folder references so let's get started so we're going to be talking about groups versus folder references in this video and we're going to be using the same excode project as we did in the last video for adding files to your excode project so you can either download this project in the link below or Click The annotation on the screen to download the excode project so if you can remember basically what I did in the last episode was organize my files in the file system the way I wanted them and then I dragged it into the xcode project Navigator and added them as uh groups so if you can remember what I told you these are individual file references each file in this project Navigator is pointing is referencing the file on the local file system regardless of where I move this guy in the project Navigator so for example with this view controller group and these files if I were to go on the file system and I were to let's say rename my file or even delete my file if I go back to xcode it would show that as a broken reference because I can't find that file now let me show you what happens with uh a folder reference so let me drag view controllers in again but this time I'm going to include it as a a folder reference so it shows up in blue now if I rename it back it fixes this but also notice that for the folder reference it kind of reflects what's in the file system so let me let me show you that again so if I go to viewcontroller.h and I add you know some numbers below it in xcode Project Navigator this file reference would be broken but however if I added the whole folder as a folder reference it just takes whatever is in that folder includes it in your project let me rename that back now just from the very fact that a folder reference includes all of these files in that folder into your xcode project that doesn't give you as fine grain control as a group would because these are individual file references so I can rightclick an individual file and I can choose to delete the reference and I would delete the reference uh in the xcode project but that file would still exist in my file system with folder references you can't do that because uh you either include everything in that folder or you delete it off of the file system in that folder because it it just picks up everything in that folder and that also goes with Target membership so if you're creating an application with a single Target which is most of the time then I guess it's not that big of a drawback for you what I mean is this if I click on a certain file and then I open up the inspector here on the right hand side I can actually choose you know what Target if I had multiple targets what Target that this file would belong to if I had a single Target then it would just be that one and I could do this at a file level at an individual file level in a group in a in a folder reference I can't do that for these files in here I have to control it at the folder level so I would either have to include the whole folder and all of its contents in the Target or don't include that folder at all another thing I forgot to mention is that with a folder reference uh don't think that you can drag files around in here and have it reflect on the file system if that was your goal uh it doesn't so it it's kind of like a read only thing where uh if I try to drag this out it's going to ask me if I want to make a copy of it or make a reference to it and let's say I do that it's just going to create a reference outside of it but it's not going to change what's on my file system in this folder so should you use folder references or should you use groups in your xcode project the common practice seems to be using groups and that's what I prefer as well uh I don't like all my files in one big directory I've I've told you guys that in previous videos so what I actually do is I organize my files in the file system and I drag them back into my project Navigator as group references But ultimately I think it comes down to what you're comfortable with and what will make you the most efficient and keeps you organized so there you have it I think over time the more you work with xcode the more you're going to discover what works for you and now for your fact of the day did you know that a recent teenager survey done by market research firm Piper Jeffrey found that onethird of us high school students now own iPhones so that statistic is astonishing to me at least I don't know about you guys and I have a friend who had a baby girl a while back and she grew up playing with iPads and touch screens and stuff like that and he told me one time she walked up to the TV and then tried to SW wipe the TV as if it were you know some giant iPad and you know what the scary thing is that that's probably not too far off in the future so let me know in the comments section below what you guys think about this topic in terms of you know the younger generation growing up with all of this technology around them all right see you guys next time
