all we have to do is hook up this roll button to take some numbers from the dice data controller and then tell these die views basically to show the appropriate images okay so let's open up assistant editor and hook up this button to an action so verify that it's looking at viewcontroller.m the implementation file and we're gonna want to hold down control click and drag the role button and create a new action called uh roll clicked so this method gets called when the role button is clicked now because we'll be using the dice data controller we want to import that file the header file and here let's create a new variable which is a new instance of diced data controller and then we'll create two number variables to hold the two random numbers and we will call the method that we created on the dice data controller okay so we created the new instance of the dice data controller here and then in here we are calling the get die number method twice and assigning the two results to these two variables and finally we have to change the images we have to tell these die views to change the image and if we go to the header file of view controller we called it first dive view and second dive view so we expose these two elements as properties that we can access here so we're going to go self first die view and show dye number that's the method that we just created in dive view and i'm going to pass in first number self dot second eye view show die number second number okay so let's run it and see what happens okay let's click roll that's awesome so we've got the dice showing up um we have to change the label and as well as this background you can see this white because the background of the of the die view itself is white so we can just change it to a transparent color so that we just see the ui image view okay so if you look at the header file you you'll remember that we exposed the label as some label so let's go to this self dot sum label and we'll change the text property and once again we'll use the string with format class method so in a string string with format and we'll want to say something like the sum is and we'll have a wild card and what to put in that wild card well first number plus second number and this will be the sum and the next thing we need to do is make these transparent so you can either do it through interface builder let me go back to single view so you can either do it through interface builder by selecting it and selecting the background it's not the color selecting the background to nothing or another way you could do it i'll show you i'll show you i'll show you the other way since this way is pretty straightforward set it back to white you can go into die view and remember that this method gets called first so you can change the background property using code so self dot background color that's a property of a ui view and you can assign it ui color clear color now if you run it again you won't see any background and that works as we expect i hope that was pretty easy to follow along and i appreciate you guys watching please share it with any of your friends or colleagues who are interested in iphone development and help me spread the word and as usual the notes are in the description below as well as the link to the source code and the image assets thanks for watching bye
