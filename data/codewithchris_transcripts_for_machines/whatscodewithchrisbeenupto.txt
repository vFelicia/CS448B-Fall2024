hey guys it's Chris here I just wanted to give you a little update on what's been going on behind the scenes that code with Chris because it's been a while since I've sat down here to chat with you like this and I've got six updates for you today I know it's a lot but like I said it's been a while so update number one I've finally finished the 2019 beginner series they were really fun to make and they're perfect for beginners so if you're in that boat or you know anyone who wants to learn how to build an app well I'll link to those in the description below and number two I can't believe I'm saying this I'm still in awe but my code with Chris training materials were featured on a big screen in an Apple retail store to a live audience like I can't believe that never did I dream that code with Chris would show up in an Apple retail store well a retail store employee reached out to me and they told me that my tear he was using some of my material to demonstrate some coding in a live session in a retail store and I got a picture of it so that's really cool but I didn't know that they offer free live coding sessions in the store so it's an initiative called today at Apple and you can visit Apple comm slash today and turn your location and it's gonna give you a schedule of free live sessions that you can go to to not only learn about coding but you can learn about like photography art music all that sort of stuff completely for free so I didn't know that that existed I think it's a great resource and I just want to throw it out there just in case you don't know about it as well me being featured in an Apple Retail Store is a secondary thing but I was like still super super excited about that all right number three Xcode 10.2 and Swift 5 was released this week as you might have known but the good thing is that so if I didn't break a whole ton of stuff I do have a learn Swift video series which is still relevant but it's a little bit dated now it's a year old and it's about time I update and refresh those lessons I think most of you guys watching probably have gone through some sort of swift training already that's for people who are just starting out Swift so in terms of content for not beginners well that's where I want to ask you so my plan is to go back and update some of my older series and I just wanted to ask you what in what preference or what order you want me to do them in so some things that I've shortlisted are the molten video series and this is was an app where I integrated with the molten platform which enables ecommerce shopping cart functionality for your app there was the YouTube API app where I taught you how to work with the YouTube API to grab the feeds and grab videos to play them there was also the Pomodoro app video series where we started building an app together through livestream that we intend to submit to the app store together and work on it build like a website for it and a marketing plan and everything like that so let me know which of those ones you'd be interested in me working on first or maybe completely something else let me know by leaving a quick comment below all right and number five so that was number four number five I'm super duper hyped to say this but behind the scenes we've been working with a couple of teachers to bring the code with Chris curriculum into their classrooms now the real reason I started coded Chris was because I believe so strongly that the coding was for everyone anyone can learn to code and my mission was to bring as many non coders into the coding world as I could and what better way to do that than to work with young kids and inspire them and empower them to pursue coding so I'm super duper excited about this initiative and when it launches I'll keep you guys posted on how that goes now if you're a teacher and you're interested in bringing your classroom into our pilot program all you have to do is reach out to us at code with Chris comp slash contact and we'll send you the details for that now number six is recognition you guys are doing such cool stuff day in and day out and I really want to share in those milestones and victories with you guys so whatever you guys are doing if you're learning with some my material or you're building something let me know tweet at me send me a message on Instagram leave me a youtube comment you know where to find me just let me know and I'll share that across all my social media channels so that we can motivate each other and we can inspire each other to move on now I have started issuing completion certificates for people who have completed the work card game because I feel like that is a huge milestone for a beginner especially someone who has never coded before so if that's you you've completed the war card game those ten beginner lessons just visit the URL below to grab your digital certificate and also if you've submitted an app before in to the App Store and my tutorials have helped you in some way please let me know I really love to share your story in your app I do have a link in the footer of my website just visit code with Chris comm scroll all the way to the bottom there is an app submission link just click on that and fill out the details on a weekly basis we'll be sharing all of these victories and milestones with everyone across our social media channels all right so that's update number six number seven bonus update is this tshirt right here you might have noticed me wearing it says code crew which is a term I've been using with you guys for a while now to be quite frank I'm not that happy with the quality that this prototype turned out quality of the tshirt the quality printing so until I can get those things right I won't be releasing any code with Chris tshirts but it is something that is being worked on in the progress alright so that's it for this week thank you so much for listening and I'll see you guys next time
