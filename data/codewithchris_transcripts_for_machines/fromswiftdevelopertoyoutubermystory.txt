hey code crew this was a talk that I did at the Swift teal conference last week and just to give you a little bit of context to this talk at the audience the attendees to this conference were Swift developers and Swift enthusiasts mostly Swift developers and so my talk is about inspiring them to share their knowledge and I did this through my own journey and how I went from a swift and objectivec developer to doing what I do now so it was really fun and exciting and I was pretty nervous because I hadn't done any public speaking in a very long time in any case I hope you enjoy it a little testing testing hello yeah okay man when I wrote that I didn't think she was gonna read it out and use it as my intro so it's a little bit embarrassing but hey everyone my name is Chris Chang and for the last six years I've been teaching non coders how to code in Swift and I do this through my YouTube channel and my website code with Chris calm but the thing is I never dreamed of becoming a youtuber I was actually an objectivec developer before and through a series of weird twists and turns and unexpected decisions I found a passion for teaching and well here I am today and I didn't think I'd be doing this six years later but the point of this talk today is not to inspire you guys to also become youtubers instead I want to inspire you guys with my story to keep your door open for the unexpected and wonderful things that can happen by doing the four things that I'm going to show you how to do today now before this turns into some weird motivational speech I assure you it's not it's not gonna be fluffy like that I have some concrete examples that I'm gonna share with you all these people here have had lifechanging things happen to themselves and when I look back at my own journey and their journeys I realized that there were four things that I identified that we all did in common and that's really what I want to share with you today and I'm gonna do that in the context of my own journey so number one is I got involved with the developer community now why is this significant for me it was very significant because that was how I got exposed to Iowa's development and had it not been for this I don't think I would have so let me explain when I graduated at my first job I worked with Microsoft Silverlight and I see we have some civilized developers here and it was a lot of fun at that point it was a brand new technology to enable rich user experiences on the web as new not many people working with it was visual is fun for me but it was a pretty tightknit community because there it wasn't that widespread and as a result I got involved with the Toronto Silverlight user group and this user group was started by two founders from Mississauga who had a consulting company so I helped them organize events monthly and I would sometimes speak at these events or I would attend them but the bottom line is that I got to know these organizers really well and at the time I didn't know it but eventually they would become my bosses because you see I left my first job tried to start my own business failed tried to start another one failed and then eventually started freelancing for these two guys and then I joined their consulting company as maybe the twelfth employee or something like that but it was at this second company that I got involved with Windows Phone development so you see a trend here everything I work on just kind of like dies so that's not the case received but um Windows Phone development so being good at that led me to become that company's first objectivec developer and being the first objectivec developer and only one at that company was kind of tough for me because I struggled to learn memory management I didn't have a more senior mentor to guide me and I didn't have objectivec team members to bat ideas back and forth with so every obstacle that I overcame every hurdle that I solved it was really hard one but at the same time it was really satisfying I'm sure as you guys being developers you know how it feels like to solve a really tough problem and I think this slide really epitomizes that feeling right yes finally got it so when our CTO said you should share our knowledge I was totally on board with that you know spending time so much time trying to figure these things out I thought I could really help other people in case other people were facing the same problems and save them a ton of time so that brings me to my second point which is sharing your knowledge to me for me that took the form of a wordpress blog so I just whipped something up I started documenting my daytoday learnings and the things I was figuring out with no expectations of who would read it and trying to build an audience or anything like that but I thought if I could just help someone you know in the odd case that they were trying to figure out the same problem that I was I would save them a ton of time and I continued to do this I continue to document my learnings and over time I start to realize I had a pretty indemand skill set because up till that point I would tell my friends and family that I did da net I did C sharp I did Windows Phone what's that right and then now when I was doing this I told people I I built I phone apps and instantly they got it but then the next question was I have an app idea all right so it seemed like back then at least in 2013 everyone had their own app idea and everyone thought I'd be the next big thing it'd be the next million dollar billion dollar app idea and so I thought hey it'd be kind of cool to try to teach people how to build their own apps because everyone seems to want to but I was really doubtful because you know how can you try to teach a non developer objectivec I mean I was having enough trouble with it so it was a fun challenge for me to see if I could teach someone who's never coded a single line of code before to build their own app using objectivec and so I decided to use the video to do this because I thought for someone who had never coded before being able to see me go through the motions would be very beneficial and choosing video naturally led me to YouTube and so I bought a $30 mic and I started to produce videos now this snapshot kind of documents my sixyear journey on YouTube so far but we're gonna get back to this slide the most important thing is that I got started that brings me to my third point I got started now this might seem kind of like a copout point but actually getting started is really really tough because there's so many obstacles to stop us from getting started from doing anything and going back to Tim's talked about the MiG bella is actually natural for your brain to stop you from doing unknown risky uncertain things it's like a safety mechanism and so for me I had a lot of obstacles that I had to overcome just to start putting videos on YouTube and so I want to talk about a couple of them some of my biggest ones so number one is I knew my friends and family we're gonna see these videos and so I wanted them to be perfect my first video on YouTube was actually eight and a half minute long but I remember I kept tree recording it it took me days just to get it right and I thought it was perfect at that time but now when I look back on that first video I still cringe so you're just gonna have to believe that you're gonna get better at it over time it's like a skill number two is imposter syndrome and Tim touched on this it's just that feeling when you get up there and you're talking just like I am now what qualifies me to be up here to teach him to talk and whenever this still creeps up on me today and when it does I try to remember that it's like a path it's a journey so there are people ahead of you way ahead of you experts and there are people behind you just getting started and those are the people that you're helping that you're enriching their lives and you're trying to bring them up to where you are and so that's what I try to keep in mind and actually keep a page on my website with all of the heartfelt thanks and comments that I get when I feel like an impostor I read this and it reassures me that I'm doing the right thing and I'm changing people's lives and I'm enriching their lives and I'm I should keep doing what I'm doing another thing that might help you to get started is the thought that you are making the world a more efficient place because think about some of the problems that you're solving at work sometimes they can take days and by you sharing that knowledge to the community you could potentially be saving other developers hours of time and productivity that they could dedicate to something else and thereby you're making the world a better and more efficient place but getting started is one thing the next step is you have to have the right expectations because going back to this graph you can see that it was really long during six years and that is the one year mark and that's when Swift came out and along this way I also had two kids probably that plateau there but I didn't post regularly hey these big red bars represent months at a time where I didn't post at all and then the yellow arrows are time for when I posted like a madman it probably would have been better if I was consistent with it but I was doing it for the right reasons I knew I was helping people I was getting good feedback from people thanking me and stuff like that so that's what kept me going and had I stopped early on or had I had that thought of I'm gonna make X amount of dollars in the first year or have X amount of subscribers in six months or something like that I probably would have put in the first month and then I never would have seen that tail end I speak from experience because at eight months I did quit my job to try to make this my fulltime gig and there was a combination of different reasons for me quitting my fulltime job but the biggest reason was I discovered the satisfaction and teaching that I never knew existed I couldn't understand why anybody would want to be a teacher but once I started hearing feedback from people and see how people reacted when they ran their first a little bit of code it reminded me when I got exposed to programming at first that wonderment that aw that joy right and to think that I could help other people experience that that really blew my mind and I was like this is way more satisfying than what I was doing at work and so I was like if I could do this fulltime that would be my dream job just giving people this feeling changing their lives and storing them on this coding journey like I had when I discovered the only problem was that you too really wasn't paying me anything and so I quit my job and I ended up doing a bunch of freelancing that's a big blue part there I had built up a little bit of an audience so I had some course I made a course and I was selling that that's the green part and YouTube represents that little red sliver but like I said I kept doing what I was doing I kept producing videos and six years later the green parts are my core sales and the red part is my YouTube revenue and I would never have guessed that this would become my life but I love what I'm doing but you see my story isn't unique because this Shawn Allen he started his he started sharing his tech job interview experiences on YouTube and he was getting great feedback and he decided to continue to produce videos it was also a creative outlet for him he got involved with the Swift community on Twitter and now two and a half years later he's made the leap to become a fulltime content creator with some freelancing on the side and then there's Mark Morgan's he always loved his knowledge with his coworkers I worked but one day no one was in the office so he decided to record a video put it on YouTube for his coworkers to watch little did he know that it was public and he started getting good feedback on it which motivated him to continue producing videos and now four years later he's built up this little audience that it might possible for him and his wife see traveled the world with no end date and this was a totally unexpected result from him just teaching online and he also had to overcome a huge sense of impostor syndrome and then there's Johnson Nell I don't think this guy needs any introduction but this year he's made the leap to become a fulltime content creator he stopped doing his freelancing and there's this tweet that I really love because it really captures the essence of my fourth point now read it to you guys in case anyone can read it every blog podcast and github project started out with an audience of zero if you want to create content or open source do it because you love it and keep working hard even when no one is paying attention just look at my number of readers it's all about time and consistency so that goes back to just doing it for the right reasons so just to recap number one get involved with the community you guys being here you know that's on the right track and don't forget Twitter reddit user groups like I did start sharing your knowledge this doesn't have to be really hard just document your day to day learnings on Twitter or on Instagram give me it as easy as that and then get started the best advice I can give you is to take imperfect action I love that term because that perfectly captures you know it's not going to be perfect at the start and having the right expectations so for me it took six years but I think that had I been more consistent and maybe more focused on it it would have been shorter for a lot of people that I highlighted in this talk it was about two and a half to three years remember John's tweet and then I have a quote from Steve Jobs that really captures the essence of my talk here you can't connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards so you have to trust the dots will somehow connect in your future you don't you have to trust in something your gut destiny life karma whatever this approach has never me down and has made all the difference in my life so by you guys getting out into the community putting yourself out there sharing your knowledge you're in essence putting more dots on the map and you just have to have some faith that those thoughts will connect in some weird unexpected lifechanging way in the future so I've got some of my contact info there if you want to reach out and chat if you guys were thinking about starting your own journey feel free to reach out and contact the info of some of the other people I mentioned in this talk as well thank you so much you guys have been a great audience thank you so much Chris
