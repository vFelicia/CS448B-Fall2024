hello hey it's chris here last week apple presented a bunch of new updates for their ios ipad os watch os and mac os platforms in their annual wwdc presentation now after that they did another presentation for developers called the platform state of the union where they shared a lot of updates for xcode swift swift ui and new apis for developers now in this video i'm not going to go through all of those things because i wrote them all up in a blog post anyways link in the description but what i do want to share with you are the three big themes that jumped out at me as i was watching these presentations and what i think it will mean for you and your app development in the near future okay so theme number one apple announced that you can have widgets and glanceable information right on the lock screen not only that these widgets can display live data such as for sports games or workouts or the progress of your ride share even they also announced a new app intense framework that your app can implement so that your app's functionality can be surfaced at the os level and be exposed to features like siri shortcuts app spotlight search and so on now to me all of this points to an app experience that is freed from the traditional sense of the user having to launch your app in order to use it with widgets the user can look at your app's data on the lock screen or the home screen and with app intents the user can use your app's functionality through siri and shortcuts and more so i think the fact of the matter is if you're not leveraging these frameworks and you're still relying on the user to manually launch your app in order to use it i think you're going to be missing out big time especially with how many apps are on a user's device these days okay on to the next big theme apple also announced a lot of new improvements to swift ui including native chart components better management of app navigation more flexibility and options for laying out your components in your views and also easier ways to integrate swift ui into an existing ui kit project now some of these things have been a thorn in our site for a long time now such as with app navigation and swift ui we were limited to kind of the standard basic types of navigation and if we wanted to do anything more complex it was a real struggle but what these announcements show me and really there's no surprise here is that apple is really trying to get us all to join the swift ui bus so to say this is the direction that they're headed in and i've always said in the past don't fight against it just go with the flow swift ui is maturing it's gonna get to that point where you want to start your project in swift ui now let's face it ui kit still provides way more control and flexibility in terms of app development but i still feel that for someone who is new and someone who is just picking up app development swift ui is still the way to go because it's a much more joyful learning experience and you're less likely to give up and really when you're starting out and starting to learn that is the most important thing not giving up just getting past that hump getting to the point where you want to do it more and you see progress right so swift ui is perfect for that so if you're an existing app developer what does this mean for you well i think that you should consider when you're starting a new project basing it on swift ui and integrating ui kit into it that way your project will be more future proof as apple continues to refine and improve swift ui so the recap theme number two is apple pushing the migration and adoption of silk ui okay now onto the third big theme which is crossplatform shared code base i'm not talking about crossplatform such as android versus ios but more so across apple's other platforms like ipad mac and on the watch and even apple tv in the two presentations apple also announced improvements to swift and the xcode tooling to make it easier for us to build apps that work seamlessly across all their platforms in their presentation they showed how easy it was to add an additional target for another platform in your xcode project there are also improvements to swift ui preview to allow you to easily see how your ui would look on a different platform and also variations in that platform such as for your watch where you have different color sets that you can cycle through and things like that swift ui already adapts nicely to different screen sizes and now with additional options and flexibility with new types of layout components that we can use it makes it even easier to layout your ui for different screen sizes and if you need to you can write blocks of code and condition statements where certain pieces of code or functionality will only run on specific platforms now i can see why apple wants us to build apps on all of their platforms as i'm sure the nonios app stores probably need a boost but as developers we have to consider the impact on launching an app on multiple platforms as well yes you can get more eyeballs for your app however that also means more complexity when it comes to support right imagine getting bug reports on all the platforms and not just on one platform if you're a single person team or a small team with limited resources i would carefully consider uh which platforms you launch your app to focus on the platforms that make the most sense for the use case of your app in some cases for example a food tracker app perhaps having an apple watch experience really adds to the general use case of tracking food makes it a lot more convenient for people right so in that case it might make sense to build an apple watch experience in addition to the ios core app so the third big theme is apple pushing multiplatform so these were the three biggest themes that jumped out to me as i watched the wwdc presentation and the platform state of the union was it the same for you or did you notice something else let me know in the comments below what announcement you're the most excited about and by the way if you want to read the notes that i wrote up on both of these presentations check out my blog article right over there thanks for watching and i'll see you in the next video foreign
