in this video you're going to learn how to add your products to the revenue cat platform so that you can easily display your inapp purchases in the app take transactions to let users purchase them and check user access levels you'll learn how revenuecat manages products and makes it easy for us to experiment with which offers work best in our app hey code crew i'm chris and welcome to code with chris the place to be if you want to learn to code and to build apps this is the third video in the revenue cat series if you missed the previous videos make sure you check out the playlist right there and here's where we are in our seven step process all right let's get started all right now it's time to add our inapp purchases to the revenue cap platform now the first thought in your head might be we've spent all this time configuring those inapp purchases in the app store connect portal why are we also adding it to revenue cat doesn't that seem like we're repeating work or we're we're doing work twice well that's not the case because we're not reconfiguring things in revenue cat what we're merely doing is adding references to those product ids that we have configured in the app store portal and by doing that we're going to be able to a manage our inapp purchases across different platforms more efficiently because your app might be crossplatform your app might be on ios on android on web and revenue cap allows you to manage all of those products group them together it gives you different ways to present different mixtures of products and it also gives you detailed analytics as to which offers are performing the best and so you can continue to experiment and maximize your revenue per user now we're going to get into all of that in this video but first we have to actually add our app to the platform so log into your revenue cat account if you haven't already make sure that you sign up for a free revenue account account using the link below cwc.to slash revcat3 and again i don't get any compensation for you signing up through that link but it does let the team know that you are interested in more content in regards to inapp purchases at monetization and how to generate revenue from your apps so if that is the case definitely go through that link and sign up for a free revenue account after you do that you're going to see a dashboard like this and we're going to go up here and add a new app and then we're going to put our app name here so this is a revcat demo all right and for the app bundle id this comes from your xcode project way back in lesson one where we created this let's go ahead and grab that from the project properties and paste that in there and then this itunes connect app specific shared secret now this key allows revenue cat to take those product ids that you're going to add to this platform and go fetch the information what's the duration what's the price you know that sort of thing so the way to get this app specific shared secret is you go back to the app store connect portal under your app under the manage inapp purchases you're going to see a listing of all of the inapp purchases that you've configured but also there's this link here called app specific shared secret and this is what we need to click generate a new secret key and we're going to copy this and then we are going to paste it in here that's going to allow revenue cat to go look at those inapp purchases that you've configured we don't have any play store configuration for this demo so we're going to just click on add all right so now we get to the part where we can configure our products our entitlements and our offers so let me tell you what that's all about so to work with revenue cat you have to understand three things products offers and entitlements let's first talk about products these are simply the inapp purchases that you've configured on the app store or your google play store or other stores let's say you have an app that is both on the google play store and the apple app store and in this app you let users buy a one year pro subscription or a one month pro subscription that means you're going to have four products a google play store one year pro membership an apple app store one year pro membership you're going to have a google play store one month pro membership and an apple app store one month pro membership so that's going to be four products in total now offers are how you present those products to the user and you can have multiple offers each offer having a different mixture of products now under products you'll notice that we have a separate product for each platform but under offers you do not have to create an offer for the app store and a different offer for the google play store you're going to be able to use the same offer for both stores now that's why a single offer consists of multiple packages a package is simply a grouping of products that are the same but just on different platforms so let's say we have offer number one here and we want to offer a one year subscription and a one month subscription to the user and they can choose which one they want to buy well inside offer number one then we're going to have two packages the first package is going to contain the google one year pro inapp purchase and the apple one year pro inapp purchase as well package two is going to be for the monthly option and in that package contains the apple app store one month inapp purchase and the google play store one month inapp purchase so as you can see all a package is is a grouping of like inapp purchases on various platforms so at the end offer number one is going to consist of two packages one package represents a yearly purchase and the second package represents a monthly purchase now we can also create a second offer and maybe on this offer we only want to allow people to purchase the one year subscription so for this second offer we only create one package in there and we put the google oneyear inapp purchase in there as well as the apple oneyear inapp purchase in there as well and now that we have two offers what we can do is experiment and split test and present offer number one half the time and then offer number two the other half of the time and see which one ends up getting us more revenue alternatively with multiple offers you can choose which offer to present in different parts of your app or maybe different points in time depending on how often or how heavily your user uses your app so for example if your analytics show you that that particular user is using your app every day very heavily then you might only present offer number two with the yearly package but as for another user who maybe doesn't use your app quite as often and he or she is not ready to make such a big commitment you might present offer number one instead so just to recap offers are what you present to the users to buy an offer consists of multiple packages and each package is just a grouping of products that unlock the same thing but on various platforms now let's talk about entitlements so an entitlement is just a level of access that you can see if the user has in order to unlock whatever content that that entitlement level entitles to the user essentially an entitlement is sort of like a membership level imagine if your app has several membership levels let's say silver gold and pro so you create three different entitlements to represent those levels and let's say you have three different inapp purchases to represent those different tiers as well so you have a oneyear silver a year gold and a one year pro products so you have three different products so in revenue cat when you create these three levels of entitlement you just indicate which product unlocks which level so you might add the one year silver product in the silver entitlement which indicates if someone purchases that inapp purchase it's going to unlock that level of entitlement for them and keep in mind if you had a oneyear silver product and the one month silver product you can add both of those to your silver entitlement level and this way when you want to check if the user has the silver membership level you don't have to check which product the user has you just check if they have this entitlement because if they've purchased one of those products inside that entitlement that means they will have access to that silver entitlement level so essentially here you're just configuring which products would unlock which entitlement levels for the user all right now that you understand this let's hop into the revenue cat dashboard and let's actually configure all of this all right let's go ahead and configure our products offerings and entitlements first we're going to go to the app that we had created and added and here we're going to jump into products straight away because the first thing we're going to do is add those two inapp purchases that we created in the app store connect side now the thing we're going to need is the product id remember these ids are unique across your entire account so we're going to select the yearly one here copy that and let's go back to our revenue cat demo here and let's click on new product the identifier is just what we had configured on the app store connect we're gonna paste that in there and then we're gonna select the app store let's click add let's do the same thing with the second one here that's the monthly one and again it's an app store now if we had additional ones for the play store or any other store we would put that in here but this is what we have the next thing we're going to do is configure our offerings so let's jump into here and let's choose a new offering so for the identifier i'm going to put pro access all products and this is a string that we're going to be checking against later in xcode when we go to fetch the offerings from the revenue cap platform to present to the user for this offering i want to offer everything to the user all of the different durations and subscriptions that we have to access proaccess and so that's why i'm naming it this way i'm going to say pro access to all features and let's go ahead and click add now inside this new offering that we have it has zero packages so we're going to click into that and we're going to add two packages one for the yearly option and one for the monthly option so let's click new this is going to be annual let's say annual access to all pro features let's add that package and inside this annual package there's zero products we're gonna fix that in just a second but let me just add the second package while we're at it so the identifier is gonna be monthly for this one and this is monthly access to all pro features so let's go ahead and add that so now our offering has two packages annual and monthly let's proceed to add the actual products into these packages if you remember a package is just the grouping of similar products on various platforms since we only have apple app store right now each of these packages essentially only contains one product let's go ahead and attach and you can see here we're going to select the yearly one under app store if we had added the play store product or you know products um of a similar nature that represents a oneyear access on the other stores we would also configure that here but again we only have the app store one let's go back to packages and do it for monthly now and let's attach the monthly one you can see how easy it makes it to have all of the information when you name it this way that they recommended all right now we're done we have a single offering with the identifier pro access all products inside contains two packages annual and monthly and inside those packages contains the products that the user is going to see for that tier the next thing we want to do is configure our entitlements and so far i've only talked about pro access and that's the only entitlement that we're going to have we're not going to have multiple tiers but you can do that we're going to click on new under entitlements and this is just going to be pro all right and this side again is going to be a string that we check against in xcode so when we want to see if that user has the pro entitlement to be able to access all the pro level content we're going to see if that user has the entitlement with this id pro again pro access to all the features let's click add and now we have to add the products which actually unlock this entitlement level so far there's zero products that do that but i'm going to change that so let's go ahead and attach all of our products see the one year subscription is going to unlock this entitlement as well as the one month subscription that's going to unlock pro as well and essentially now we're completely done this is a basic configuration of your products offerings and entitlements but you can do so much more when you have more products and you really start diving deep into how to optimize your revenue per user so there's a lot more to this revenue cap platform than we're just covering here in this video series so if you want to see more complex use cases with revenue cat and ways to optimize your revenue peeking into the analytics and really diving deep make sure you show them some love make sure you comment make sure you thumbs up this video make sure you go through that link cwc.to revcat3 and that's going to let them know that we're really excited to see more content on inapp purchases and app monetization alright let's move on in this lesson you learned all about how revenuecat manages products offerings and entitlements if you haven't signed up for your free revenue cat account yet you can do so through cwc.to revcat3 now i want to turn it over to you do you have any apps in the app store and are you making any money from them let me know by leaving a quick comment below lastly if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe so you don't miss the next lesson in the next lesson we're going to be diving into xcode to build that tor app demo where we ultimately will display our inapp subscriptions for people to purchase all right thanks for watching and i'll see you there
