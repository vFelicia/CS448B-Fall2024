hello and welcome to lesson 6 of my Swift tutorial for beginners video series now in the last lesson you learned about the for in loop which lets you execute a block of code for a set number of times well there's another kind of loop too actually that allows you to loop your block of code indefinitely until a condition is met these kinds of loops are awesome when you don't know how many iterations it's going to take to get the job done all right so let's dive in and see how they work so in this demo we're going to go through two types of loops that are really good to use when the number of times that you need to loop for is unknown so the first one is called the while loop and this loop checks the condition to see if it's true and then it's going to run your code and then check the condition again and then run your code and check the condition again let's to quickly take a look at the syntax for this so you start with the wild keyword and then you have a condition and then you have a set of braces and then inside the braces you have the code that you want to loop now notice that the condition is up there at the top before it even execute your code it's going to check the condition first to see if it's true kind of like an if statement if that condition is not true then your code is not going to be run at all let alone loop let's jump into the playground now and let's do a demo of the while loop so I've got this guy right here brand new playground fresh out of the oven so far let's say let's cheese counter is equal to five and then let's say that I want to let's do the same example like we did before we're going to print hello and what we're going to do is say while counter is less than or sorry while counter is greater than zero I'm gonna print hello now before I finish writing the syntax for this while loop you can see here it's telling me you need a set of braces but before I finish writing the syntax for this while loop I just want you to notice one thing so first is going to evaluate this condition and it's true right you can see that counter is equal to five and five is greater than zero so it's true so it's going to print hello and then it's going to loop and check the condition again and it's going to be true again so it's gonna loop and it's gonna keep looping infinitely until we get a crash there's some overflow so let me demonstrate that I would not recommend this if you've got a slower computer and I'm not even sure if mine's very fast so it's it's just gonna keep going maybe now Xcode has something where it's oh I have to run my code let's do that so you can see it just it's going bonkers right so I'm gonna stop that right now it's not stopping okay yeah it's not stopping my computer is kind of going haywire right now so what you want to do actually is inside this while loop you want to write some code to actually make it so that this condition can be false so if we print it now sorry if I can actually get this yeah so you see I wouldn't recommend you to do this but we can still walk through the code so while that's running my playground let me just explain what happened here so I basically created a while loop that ran on indefinitely until I added this code here so this code decrement the counter by one just like you saw the other one which was plus equal one and that would actually add one to the counter this one minus is one from the counter so it starts at five right so the first iteration would be five and then print hello and then it would turn that counter into four because it decorated identify one then loop again and four is greater than zero loops and then this line would set counter to three and then go on and on and on until it hits zero and then 0 is not greater than zero so that is actually allows us to exit the loop I knew that was pretty bad idea so I'm gonna try and stop this there we go so can I run this down I think I broke it so I'm going to actually quit Xcode right now take a look let's see what we can do here nope okay all right guys we're back so all I had to do was quit Xcode and restart Xcode and run my playground again so let's run it here all right so we've got our hello five times which is great now we can talk about our second type of loop which is the repeat while loop so let's let me show you where that is just scroll a little down further here the repeat while loop and let's take a look at the syntax for this so here you have the repeat keyword followed by a set of braces inside the braces you have the code that you want to loop and then what's noteworthy is that behind the closing brace you have the wild keyword and then the condition so notice how the condition is at the end of the loop instead of the while loop where the condition was at the top so essentially what happens here is that your code statements are going to be run at least once and then after it is run it's going to check the condition and if the condition is true then it's going to repeat and loop it so that's different from the while loop which checks the condition first and it might not even run even once if your condition isn't true so let's go back to the playground now and test out the repeat while loop so I am going to declare I would say counter two plus two equal five again and I'm going to use the repeat keyword and print hello and then here I'm going to decrement my counter just like we have up there and I am going to say while counter two is greater than zero so while let me do ya help for a while loop from repeat while loop and let's do that so what happens is that we get five of these printouts from the first while loop and we get five of these printouts from the second while loop all right just like we expected however what if I changed counter to let's say negative five and I change the counter to negative five and I run it well you look at that the while loop doesn't even run once right because it checks the condition first that's not true it's not gonna run your code skip this one it's going to print it out first and then it's going to realize that a negative five is not greater than zero so I'm not going to repeat I'm not going to loop so the one that you use really depends on the situation and what you're trying to accomplish if you're writing some logic that you know you want it to happen once and it only conditionally repeats then you'll want to use the repeat while loop however if you want your code to only be run when certain conditions are met and as long as that condition is still true then you use the while loop all right let's recap you learned about the while loop and the repeat while loop that lets you execute a block of code and loop it indefinitely until a condition is met now the while loop checks the condition first before executing the block of code and then looping and the repeat while loop will execute your block of code first and then check your condition to decide whether or not it should repeat for another iteration you're doing amazing so far but I've got a question are you liking what you're learning so far if so make sure that you're subscribed to my
