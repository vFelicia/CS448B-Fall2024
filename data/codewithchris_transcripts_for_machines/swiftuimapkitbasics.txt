map kit for Swift UI man when they announced this at ww23 I was pumped and it's not that I use maps all the time in my apps it's just that when I do need it it's quite a chore to add a UI kit map to my Swift UI project plus the code is kind of complex to explain it simply to a beginner who wants to use maps in their project now all of that has been solved let me show you in this Swift UI map kit Basics tutorial you're going to learn how to add a map to your Swift UI project how to add markers to your map and how to customize them how to add annotations to your map they're kind of like markers but they let you add a custom view instead I'll also show you how to change the region that the map shows and finally how to change the style of the map now for reference I learned all of this stuff from this wwc23 video link in the description so Swift UI maps are only available on xcode 15 beta and later so depending on when you're watching this if xcode 15 has officially come out or maybe it's xcode 17 now things may change okay under iOS let's choose app and let's call this map kit demo interfaces with UI languages Swift click on next let's save this on the desktop let's make this window a little bigger okay so the first thing we're going to do is import map kit at the top next we are going to replace the entire vstack with a swift UI map component and it's literally as simple as that to add a map to your Swift UI project this used to take ages with the UI kit map okay step two we're going to add a marker to this map and that is very simple as well but first let me declare a point of Interest so I am going to take this lat long of the CN Tower and we're going to use that we need a CL location coordinate 2D and we're going to pass in the lat and the long all right so that's our Tower and in order to add this to the map you open up the content builder for the map this is where you can add content just open up a pair of curly brackets in here you're going to be able to add content okay so we're going to add a marker component and it takes in a title key and a coordinate so let's call this CN Tower and for coordinate we're just going to pass in Tower so you can see that right away the camera region goes automatically to the markers if I had multiple markers it would frame the map so that all of the markers are visible and does that automatically so here in the map already if I hold down control on my keyboard or option rather and you know I can sort of navigate around you can see all these things okay let's add a couple of markers so we're probably going to zoom ahead for this part because it's going to be a little bit tedious okay so now I have a few more points of interest let's add these to our map as well Okay so we've got the art gallery of Ontario and we've also got this is the museum the Royal Ontario Museum ROM now you can see it frames the map it zooms out and it frames it so that all of my markers are visible automatically now I want to show you how to customize these markers so this marker you can actually pass in a couple of different things instead of just this pin so this is the CN tower that's this one down here and you can pass in an image if you have one you just add it into your asset library and you can display that instead of this little pin icon but you can also add an SF symbol which is what I'm going to do here so I can search for unfortunately there's no Tower but there is a building so I'm going to use that all right you can see that changed into a building there in that corner the other thing you can do is you can use a monogram which takes up to three letters so now I can display a ago instead if I wanted to so those are a couple of options you can also change the color so for the tower let's say I want this to be blue for the art gallery I want that to be red and then for the museum let's give it a system image let's use this one that kind of looks like a museum right put it right there and then tint this one perhaps should be Orange all right so that's how easily you can customize these markers but if you wanted to completely change this little bubble and you wanted to put your own icon there you can as well you can use what's called an annotation instead of a marker and it actually looks really really similar so let's say for example for the art gallery I don't want to display the ago I can choose annotation instead and it accepts the title the coordinate and content in in this content you can then put your own view that you want to use so let's call this Art Gallery coordinate is ago and the content is anything we'd like so why don't we use something like this and then we'll also add some padding to that and we'll add a background color to thread so it could be something like that gives any idea you can put in your own shapes you can put in whatever you want as a view so what if we wanted to control what area the map shows by default the camera position is automatic so it frames all of your markers and annotations in view however there is a way for you to control that camera position to let's say single out a particular location so the way you control that is by specifying this position parameter and it is a binding to a map camera position right so let me show you how that works we're going to add a state property let's call this camera and it's going to be map camera position and we're going to set it to a default value of automatic which is actually what is happening behind the scenes right now create a position that frames the maps content right and what we can do later is for example when the user Taps on a button we can set this camera position to something that we want and that will then change where the map is framing so let's pass this property into our map component through this position parameter and it's got to be a binding oops there we go camera and then let's add some buttons so this is something really cool that I learned from that WDC video and it is called a safe area inset so you can overlay some controls on top of the map and it's ensured that nothing will cover it so it shows content above or below the modified View so we're going to put it along the bottom Edge and in content I can choose what to show so I'm going to put an H stack here and I'm going to put a button that says let's see here how about we Center on um okay so you see the button down there but it's kind of hard to read so then you can put a background on this and you can use a thin material to have a slightly opaque background but notice that it only takes up the width of the button so what you can do is add a spacer to the left and right of the button and you can also add some padding at the top so it's not so close to the text so that creates a little more space right there and then when this button is tapped on what we want to do is just set the camera position so we can set the camera equals there are a couple things you can set this to one of them for example you can Center it around an MK map item if you have a reference to a particular marker or map item sorry you can Center it around erect or a region or user's location even so if you want the the map to track a user's location as the user is like let's say driving or biking or something like that you can use that and then region is what we're going to use here and then we're going to specify an MK coordinate region and we are going to center it around the tower and specify a number of meters as the area to show so let me space this out a little bit so it's a little easier to see and read these all right so right here it's still automatic camera positioning but when I tap on the tower it's then going to change the the camera to show the CN Tower with the specified number meters here so I can very easily add another button here let's just copy and paste this and this is going to be let's do the ROM for this one all right so CN Tower ROM it's kind of a cool looking building actually and the last thing I want to show you guys is how easily you can change the style of the map so let us collapse that and collapse left and then we are simply going to add a matte style modifier and you can choose standard is what we're looking at right now and then you have imagery using satellite imagery or hybrid where you can read that has the road names and information layers on top so let's take a look at imagery because that looks really really different so we can zoom in and we can take a look at this imagery here or let's let's go to the ROM yeah that's how that building looks like so if you have time definitely check out that dub dub 23 video that I linked to in the description that's where I learned all of this and that video actually covers a lot more such as about how to add routes user locations and highlight different things on the map It's really informative video so have you ever tried to add a UI kit map to your Swift UI project using UI view representable if you have you'll know what I mean when I say it's quite complex to do and it took me a while to grasp what was going on and now we have this beautiful Swift UI syntax to work with maps it is awesome so what is your favorite part about Swift UI map kit let me know by leaving a comment below and if you are new to app development check out our three hour beginner master class on Swift UI where you will build your first app no experience required thanks for watching I'll see you in the next video
