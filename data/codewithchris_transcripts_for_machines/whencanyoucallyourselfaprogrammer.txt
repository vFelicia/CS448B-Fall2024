hey code crews so I got a quick question for you the other day I had an interview question and no this is not for a job interview a student actually wanted to interview me for their school project so that was cool but the actual question is how long have you been a programmer for and it seems like a straightforward question but I really really had to think about this because what does it mean to be a programmer and when can you start identifying yourself as a programmer and I really really wanted to get your opinion on this because to me is a programmer when you first get your developer job or programmer job in is that when you can call yourself a programmer or is it when you've picked up your first programming book and or tutorial and you've decided to take it up as a hobby is that one you can identify yourself as a programmer so I took it to mean the ladder now I'm really interested in your opinion that's why I created this video I want you to tell me when can you start identifying and calling yourself a programmer and by that definition are you a programmer and how long have you been a programmer for let me know by leaving a quick comment below I'm really really curious to see what you guys think all right I'll catch you guys next time bye for now
