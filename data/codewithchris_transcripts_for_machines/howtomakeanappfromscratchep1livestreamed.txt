hey guys can you see me can you hear me let me know in the chat below just so we know things are working out and we'll get started in just a minute hey guys can you hear me and hopefully you guys can all see my screen as well I'm super excited today to start this livestream because we're actually going to start an app from start to finish and this is not planned out this is I haven't built this out before there are things that I haven't figured out myself I don't know if this app idea that I have exists so we're gonna go through all of those steps together but I just want to wait a couple more minutes for people to join and we'll get started hey guys hey Chris hey Musa Angela Prakash hey Musa you should actually be able to see my screen I just have a quick agenda on there you guys should all be able to see my screen right now if you can't try refreshing the page I don't know but I am sharing my screen right now I am optimal if you have Windows 10 you have a couple of options we actually have an article for PC users and kind of the options that they have so Adrienne will send that link all right so let's get started if you guys don't know me my name is Chris this is the first time you're on the channel welcome to code with Chris where we teach people how to build iOS apps basically Adrienne is manning the chat and so please be nice to him send in your questions one by one and don't break up your messages into multiple messages and that's gonna help him be able to make sure all your questions get answered but in this live stream I don't know if we'll have a Q&A time we might this is gonna run for an hour and I'm not really gonna be teaching so much as showing in this live stream because like I said this live stream we're gonna start by taking an app idea that I have explain what it is we're gonna look into the app store check out what sorts of apps are existing for this kind of idea maybe check their reviews to see if people complain about certain things we're gonna go through some features and requirements and again this is all from scratch so I haven't I don't have these listed out beforehand I haven't given it any thought so there's gonna be some audience participation right you're gonna be able to suggest features for me for this app we're going to discuss mmm sort of which features should make it into the first version of the app which feature should be like a later phase and I'll show you how I break things up so that mmm I aim to get the project complete and out the door rather than trying to get the whole thing polished and perfect right and super duper feature full before shipping it that's not the way that I think we should work but I'll explain all of that later and then I'll talk about some of the challenges that I foresee with building this app some of the things that I still need to figure out some of the things that I've already figured out like I've done in the past so it shouldn't be a roadblock for me and I think that even though I don't have everything figured out that's that's why I'm doing this so I think it'll be very helpful for you guys to see that building an app isn't like isn't always a smooth process right it's a bumpy road and even for someone like me who you know I was doing it professionally in IT consulting for like five years it's still there's still things to figure out because there's always new features in the SDK there's you know things like even things I've done in the past I don't remember sometimes right so I have to go back and nowadays Google is awesome and having this resource and having all of these people create all of this content for iOS development and then all of the documentation available online it's great like I know some of the people who have been in the tech industry for a while and back then before you know before the internet so widespread we would have to dig through text books and try hopefully try to find the solution to your problem by just flipping through pages of thick tech book tech textbooks and relying on more senior people in the company to perhaps have encountered that problem before and help you solve it but these days development I think has changed a lot where as you can use Google and find your answers hopefully within minutes oh really do utilize that and I am going off on a tangent so I'll stop talking about that but let's get started with unveiling my app idea for this big project and it's basically a Pomodoro timer so if you know if you know what that is there are a ton of Pomodoro timer apps in the App Store already I can tell you that right now and I'll explain what Pomodoro is in a second for those of you guys who don't know but my idea for a Pomodoro timer and it's not an original idea is to integrate social features into the Pomodoro timer so that you can connect with friends like you can add friends to your account and then you guys can see each other's like Pomodoro's how many Pomodoro you have completed during that day so you can motivate each other and can challenge each other to do more Pomodoro's now before I get too far ahead of myself for those of you guys who don't know what the Pomodoro Technique is let me just explain very very quickly and I actually found a graphic on on Google and it talks about it like really really succinctly a Pomodoro timer is basically a timer what so let me back up the Pomodoro Technique I don't even know who developed it but if you google it there was a guy who invented this technique but basically overall revolves around productivity and how to stay productive so the idea works like this you set a timer for 25 minutes and during those twenty five minutes you remove all distractions you just focus on that one thing that you're doing for 25 minutes your timer is going to go off at the end of 25 minutes at that point take a short break which is a fiveminute break so for five minutes you just you know get up stretch whatever and then you do another Pomodoro for 25 minutes same task until you get it done so you keep repeating this process you know twentyfive minutes of work five minutes of break until you reach for Pomodoro so you've worked for a hundred minutes then you take a longer break and they recommend a 15minute break I think for a long break but there is some flexibility and how you use the system so you can you know you can take a longer break as long as you want and then you get back to it so the idea is that a it helps you remove all distractions because your mind thinks oh for twentyfive minutes I just have to do this task for 25 minutes and it makes it easier to start right for something that you really really don't want to do and you're procrastinating if you just think I'm just gonna do 25 minutes and then once you get into it you just obviously you do more and more until it's done number two it helps you estimate tasks because if you do that task a lot and you're setting your Pomodoro timers you'll be able to then better estimate how long like how many Pomodoro's that task will take and so you can break up your workday if you have like eight hours or six hours or whatever you can then gauge better how much work you can actually fit in so that's the whole idea of the Pomodoro Technique what I've been using myself is this website called tomato timer and it's like the most basic website you will ever find for this sort of thing but it works and that's why I use it so all you do is you hit start the timer goes for 25 minutes and when those 25 minutes are up it beeps and then you just stop it you reset it and then you go to this tab where it's going to give you a fiveminute break then you take your 5minute break and you go back to the Pomodoro for 25 minutes and after you've done four of them you take a long break so personally when I use this Pomodoro Technique to try to stay productive I don't keep track of how many Pomodoro's I've done I mostly use this as a way to remove distraction because in my mind I'm like I just have to focus for twenty five minutes and also as a motivator to do things that I don't really want to do and if I didn't have anything like this I would just put off those things continuously so I think we all have tasks like that so personally I find this very useful and I know there are apps out there there's like a ton of apps in the App Store for this sort of simple time work but I don't think there is one which has these social features integrated where you can kind of chair each other on and be like oh how many palma doors that you do how many did i do and then just help each other stay productive and again this is not my original idea I was reading a blog post from it was on search engine optimization and this guy he uses Pomodoro timers religiously and one way that he stays so productive is that he he has a partner which he works with and they chat through the messages app and they basically they just tell each other how many Pomodoro's they did and it kind of because they have a competitive nature they kind of spur each other on to do more and so he was he was saying like he can't find anything out there for this sort of social twist to the Pomodoro Technique and if someone were to create it then he would be the first to use it and so that kind of gave me the idea and I think it it would be useful like even if no one paid me any money to do it I think I would use it so that's that's kind of my motivation I'm not doing this for money or anything and I thought that this would be also a great project to share with you guys to go on this journey and take this idea or I build it out submit it to the app store build like a website for it just basically go through the whole thing and you guys can experience all of the ups and downs and the roadblocks and the challenges and I think that's what some of you guys said that you wanted to see and I thought it was a really good idea actually with that because there are a ton of iOS tutorials out there right but what's the problem with all of this knowledge it's that it relies on the reader or the watch or the viewer right to take that knowledge and turn it into practice right be practical with it because just consuming content just reading just watching it doesn't help you get anything done and unless you turn that knowledge into wisdom through doing the work right that's that's the point where that knowledge actually gives you dividends and gives you like a return on return on investment yeah so hopefully this candid real journey of me building this app and showing you guys all of the steps and processes helps you guys understand what it's really like all right behind the curtains and hopefully it inspires you guys to start now in the beginning of next month in the beginning of November I'll be it's kind of not hosting but I'll be starting like a challenge like an app challenge and I think I've talked about this in the previous livestream where I want to get as many people who feel comfortable building apps no matter how simple they are to be involved and the goal is to try to build and ship an app within a month and I think that's completely doable as long as your scope isn't like out to space right if you pick something that's gonna be doable for your skill level I think that's totally doable and I think the point is not to make money or not to you know not to do anything like that the point is to get into the practice of actually producing stuff actually putting into practice what you're learning and actually shipping products because I think you know there's this there's this sort of danger of always tweaking something and trying to get it perfect or always just working on designs and prototypes and daydreaming about stuff right that's not until you actually ship something and maybe get some feedback on it that we're we're you know that you're either onto something or maybe you should close the door on that so got that's gonna be the challenge starting November 1st and for those of you guys who aren't at the skill level where you feel like you can build anything yet I'll have another learning path for you guys to take for the next 28 days where you can get yourself up to speed so that's all coming up and really excited about that but anyways now that we have the intro out of the way let's get started with the next part which is uh so I've told you about my app idea the next part I wanted to do with you guys it's actually just check out the App Store now I've downloaded a couple of the Pomodoro timers by couple I actually mean two and one I found really confusing to use I feel like a timer should just when you launch it you should be able to just see a start button and start it but some of these are actually the way that they've done the user interface is actually a little bit confusing so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna plug in my phone and hopefully I can show it on the screen we're gonna check out the app store see what's available and hopefully I don't see a Pomodoro timer which already has the social features included because as I didn't look very hard and as far as I know it doesn't exist so we're gonna check that out let me plug in my phone right here alright so hopefully you guys can see my phone see it on the screen right now okay so in case you guys were wondering the app is not going to be submitted to the App Store today right today we are starting the journey to do this so I think by the end of this livestream we will have a list of requirements flushed out the bare minimum requirements to submit to the App Store as an MVP or Minimum Viable Product and I'll be able to tell you guys about what my next steps are in terms of figuring out some of the challenges that are gonna exist for me all right so I'm looking in the App Store here I'm gonna do a search for I'm just gonna search for the more general term just to see what comes up so focus keeper is one which I actually downloaded and this is the one which I'm currently using the nice thing about this one is that it has all of these nice graphs and I really like the idea of it logging how many Pomodoro's you've done and being able to see over time the work that you've done because that's one thing that I'm not doing right now I just use the timer I turn it I time it and I stop it and I just use that tomato timer I showed you doesn't keep track of any history so just by using the app which I've been using this one for the last maybe a couple of days it's nice to be able to keep track of that so this one is pretty easy to use right it's got a start start and a stop but this one doesn't have any of the social features which which I'm targeting and that has some pretty good rating so what I would do is probably take a look at some of the reviews and see what people do like about it and hopefully try to emulate some of those features into the app that we're building right now so there's that yeah this is another kind of like version I guess of a Pomodoro timer but it's not it's not really based off of the Pomodoro Technique for timers like this it's basically like you set the time that you want to work and if you take your phone and try to do something else with it like go on Facebook or whatever then the tree that you're growing is gonna die so the motivation is to stay focused is to not kill your tree so I want to consider this to be a Pomodoro timer it's a Productivity tool but the Pomodoro timer and this one here this one's just in Chinese it's not really my target market but I think it looks like at a bare minimum you've got the timers and then you've got charts right to keep track of how much you've worked which definitely we we should have and some of these some of these as well they're not just Pomodoro timers they're also like todo lists and there are gold trackers and stuff like that and personally this is my personal opinion I feel like if your app tries to do too much it's gonna be convoluted and it's gonna be more confusing to use and so when I built this Pomodoro timer app it's purely going to be for the Pomodoro Technique and I'm not gonna try to put todo lists or goals or anything like that and then we're gonna have the social aspect all based around the Pomodoro that you complete see this one has habit training and mono tasking I wouldn't call this like a pure Pomodoro Technique either based on the Pomodoro Technique yeah make a todo list now Rustom how to quit learning how to quit the learning regimen and start doing your own project so you you just got that you just got to start but I know it can be confusing as to where to start and so I do have a learning plan that I'm going to come up with starting November 1st that's gonna be free for everyone to use and it's gonna basically be like day one you do that stay tuned you do this and you just follow that and hopefully that motivates you guys to actually do stuff rather than just continually learning because I know it can be tempting to just watch like ten videos and then you know backtoback like a Netflix binging session but that's not really helpful creative rewarding daily have a routine you know what I don't see anything yeah okay this was the other one that I've used flat tomato I downloaded this one I found it really hard to use I didn't didn't really understand because the the interface was so minimal that when I launched it I saw this clock face but there were no like buttons to tell me what to press or what actions to take and I found it really confusing to use but it still got has pretty good rating so maybe I'm just dumb yeah all right so I'm kind of focus I'm sorry I'm kind of satisfied to me yeah see they're a ton of these things but I don't think any of them have had this the sort of social feature it's all very like focused on your own to do the next thing to do I'm not going to do with this right here because it's it's a little mindnumbing but it would be to go through some of the reviews for these apps and kind of see what people are saying about the app what did they like about it what do they don't like about it and that sort of knowledge will sort of guide you into what sorts of features that you should implement into your own app or maybe how to design the user interface of your app like if if a particular app has really good reviews I would suggest you download it and play around with it and see kind of how they did their UI and I want to say copy it but I would say let it guide you and your design when you're designing your own up and so I'm gonna I'm gonna move on now to writing out our own feature set for our app right here I'm just gonna minimize that and we're just gonna do this right here so I will just write it right here features and requirements see if you guys can see this on the screen all right so I would say and I'm gonna break this right right now into like a v1 youtube because I'm gonna tell you right now my v1 is going to be super simple because if you've seen my video right here which I released recently called finish your projects or five tips to help you complete your projects I recommend that you should take your overall feature set and break it down into an MVP that is manageable so what what is the minimum amount of core features your app needs to have to still be useful and so that's what I'm going to base it on to me this tomato timer on this website this is like the bare minimum I think that you need in order to follow the Pomodoro Technique so there's like no history there's no tracking there's no social features there's no charts nothing and so I'm gonna base my v1 off of something like this where you you literally just have three timers start and stop and reset and you know that that is literally it so my v1 is going to be something like we have the 25 minute timer right we have the five minute break timer and we have the long 15 minute fifteen minute long break timer and I think in order for it to be useful as well as a Pomodoro timer is if like let's say you get a phone call or something pops up in your app and if you're really sticking to your Pomodoro Technique you're not supposed to be distracted by any of that but let's just say if you do and this app goes into the background I feel like it should still be tracking the time right so that it doesn't like pause the timer when your app goes into the background so I feel like as even as a v1 the app needs to keep or how about let's just say timer needs to continue to run in the background like if you've had if you have that timer set so that's one of the things that I actually don't know how to do but I know it can be done because obviously it can because everyone has these Pomodoro timer apps out there I just need to figure out how to do it and I'm sure it's not very hard because in order to run things in the background I do know that you need to enable certain capabilities for your app so I think it it's just that I think it's just specifying that your app needs to run timers or maybe schedule the reminder or something like that I just need to investigate that so that's one of the challenges but I'll get into that let me see if you guys have any suggestions okay so if you guys do have suggestions type it in now I am keeping track of the chat now so I mean just two future so I don't have to organize those but definitely social features right we're talking about ability for users to create an account also abilities ability for a user to use it as a guest so if people want to use the timer and not create an account and just use the app without the social features out I do want to allow that as well so there or let's say let's break this up into social features timer features so for this would be like ability to set or to customize the durations of breaks or work timers see what you guys are saying ability to set targets Martin maybe you can expand on what you mean by targets do you mean ah so you mean like a goal for how many Pomodoro's you're gonna do that date integration into messages maybe Kevin you can expand on that like in what way would would it integrate into the messages app like would you share your progress with someone through messages that what you're talking about okay Martin we yeah I'm gonna write that down so this would be like goal setting ability to set a daily goal for the amount of palms mom's the palms you're going to do call this sharing I have to merge some of this actually sharing we probably go into social ability to share your progress with others so this would be kind of like a share extension type of thing so that you can share it with messages or whatsapp or anything like that let me just type out some more of these ability for user to follow follow let's follow the right word or add as to add friends ability to like we would need user profiles right so that you can see how many Pomodoro's your friend is doing or something like that Billy to to view user profiles I think what would be very cool is like if you could issue challenges right like if you can have a running challenge with another person or maybe a group of people where you set you set a goal like oh every day you have to do like the goal everyone agrees on is like every day you have to do ten Pomodoro's or something and then whoever doesn't do it gets like kicked out of the group or dropped out and then like you can see who's left standing like king of the hill styles I don't know that's just an idea but I'm gonna write it down ability to issue challenges with a single person or group and we can elaborate on that needs more detail see what you guys are saying yeah Martin I agree yeah I agree with sending daily weekly targets I just don't want to get too far out there that this turns into kind of like a habit tracker as well because I want to stay really focused that this is just like a very strict Pomodoro timer but I might you know I might change my mind on that that's the way I feel right now but see this is the this is why we do an MVP right so we're gonna release the v1 it's a simple timer v2 we might add some of the social features and then depending on what people start saying if people start using this and saying like oh I wish I had this I wish I had that then we're gonna have to start evaluating what's best for the users because you do want to the idea is to iterate on this idea in this product to turn it into something that people love using oh I know now you're saying the long break is 30 minutes yeah I have to verify I have to verify that it might be 30 minutes you might be completely right I don't I'm not so sure if it might be 15 minutes or not I'm just gonna say like X minute like what is the the long break that the Pomodoro Technique actually recommends I don't for me personally I I just take like X number of minutes I don't keep track of how long my break is I go off and do something and whenever I'm done taking a break I just come back and start another cycle of for Pomodoro's oh I don't really like that I really like the the messages like keep going the encouragement right Martin so the user profile is not going to be not not social profile it's gonna be like how many Pomodoro's have that has this guy done today and in you know in the last week or something like that so the idea is to keep each other come to stay productive and to to be doing work I'm gonna put Iona I'm gonna put your feature under goal setting so encouragement quotes yeah happy images so I've kind of decided that this is gonna be like v1 we can probably crank this out pretty quickly because I do like my goal is gonna be try to try to release this v1 by the end of the month so that when we start the app challenge on November 1st I can be ready to do like a phase 2 version of the app and I'm gonna use that as my monthlong app challenge so I'm gonna keep v1 really simple and probably not very useful to be honest compared to all of the other Pomodoro timers out there but I don't really care I'm just gonna because I think mentally just getting it shipped getting it released in the App Store is a milestone in my head and that's gonna keep me motivated to do v2 right I think when we're talking about motivation like I run into the same problems as you guys do if if any of you guys suffer from that like I said before I have tons of halfdone projects in a folder somewhere on my computer and I'm really scared to to publicly now right I'm doing this with you guys to cut the cord on this I don't really want to do that so I'm gonna set v1 to be very manageable to be something like I'm pretty confident like 99% that I can get this done and shipped and then we are going to improve on that from there so I'm I'm following my own advice guys in the five tips on how to finish your project follow my own advice here social features so you know I don't know if we have to decide on a v2 right now but I feel like if you two might be to be able to set durations like that seems pretty pretty necessary because everyone uses plummet or a little differently some people take longer breaks some people not and the social aspect like integrating the ability to create an account like even even having to create an account requires a backend so at this point we're getting into databases right and so that's compared to everything else that's a large part of work so it would be you also it would be useless to introduce the ability to create an account but that's it right oh I forgot so let me finish that train of thought so it would be useless to be able to create an account but not do anything with it so if we were to introduce this the ability to create an account we would have to also introduce the ability to like add friends and follow friends and maybe like like there you know maybe give them a thumbs up when they've completed a Pomodoro or something like that but I was about to say that we forgot a huge piece here and that would be like history I don't know if that's the right word but basically like tracking how much work you've done like keeping track of poems completed every day showing them in a graph oh I don't know why I'm capitalizing some of these ability to change date range on the graph so stuff like that like ability to manipulate the graph so that you can see how many you how many maybe Pomodoro's you've done in the last month versus the last week versus the last three days or whatever like that and maybe to be able to average it out so this definitely neat it needs more detail needs more thought around it but see doing this stuff doesn't require user accounts either so we can keep track of this data locally on their device right when they do create an account though we could with her sync that data somewhere so that if they logged in to that same account on another device or maybe they're using two devices at once or maybe in the future would create like a Mac app version of this app as well then the data can get synced into that same account so you know data syncing I actually don't know if this has an H or not I look right all right data syncing so ability to transfer data to another device or keep data in sync with another device let's see what you guys are saying right here oh you have tons of halfdone online courses same with me same with me it's you know like life happens things come up it's tough it's tough in a hair Here I am like I'm I have online courses right hate for people so like first hand I know how hard it is to to make time for this stuff yeah I own a thumb I don't want this app to have to be connected to the Internet to work because it shouldn't right just only for the social features it would be yeah Kevin you're right so Kevin says the ability to categorize the palms that you work on whether that's for like school or work or maybe another cat look Billy Billy to set categories so that when you're looking at your history you can see how much work you've done in each category I think that that kind of goes with goal setting I think no timer features I put this under here ability to choose a category for the palm you're running and filter based on category Sofer Khan I'm sorry if I am butchering your name but he's saying the integration with github or bitbucket to buy in the palm with a repository to track how many hours of code in the repo that's interesting that's interesting just get help a bit okay track hours like that I'm actually not familiar with that but I'm gonna write it down I just could make a Miska category with I just say source control so just for us well the social feature work with teams like setting a timer for an entire team I've actually seen that done with this app called a forest which is a Productivity app that revolves around timers as well and I think they've just released a feature or maybe it's not recent but I recently discovered that they have a feature where you can like put your phones together and sync up a timer so like you said if coworkers are working together they have like a group timer and if anyone picks up their phone I think it kills it kills the tree or whatever they're trying to grow for for the whole team so it keeps the whole team focused but to answer your question just for I haven't I haven't thought about it whether it will work together as a team I'm gonna write that down but in my head right now I don't have any I don't have any I haven't thought about doing that so I'm gonna write that down okay let's build a milliondollar Pomodoro app you know what I haven't even thought about monetization I don't like I said my goal isn't to to make money from the app I honestly would just like to use it and I think that's the best motivation although it's kind of idealistic because people need money to survive so if we were to to charge money for it I don't know we could try different forms of monetization now that would be an interesting experiment experiment I think we should do it we should try like just because we're building this together I think you guys would all be interested to see like how much potential you know money we could make off of often releasing an app and monetizing it too right so there are so many different ways to monetize it but like one one way that comes to mind right now would be to be like have a banner with an inapp purchase to remove it let's say for pro version and then like you see apps telling people they could use it for free right but then pro version unlocks maybe like the history version aspect of it or anything else I do believe we cannot put the social features behind a paywall because that's kind of what is the differentiator for this app right without the social features then how is this any different from any of the other Pomodoro timers out there in the app store right now right I wouldn't say any yeah so I'm gonna have to take some time away to take a look at these features which we've talked about and come up with a v2 but I don't think I have to do that until closer to the end of the month I'm gonna focus on doing this part v1 which is pretty doable the only thing I need to figure out right is is this timer in the background and the next time I talk to you guys I'm gonna make it a goal to have figured that out so I can tell you guys what I had to do but the next steps traditionally let me bring up another video that I've done that's this one called the app design process and that basically just runs through the different steps typically taken in building an app so we have now completed like the first step which is basically to gather the requirements for the app and figure out the core MVP version the next step would be to wireframe it out so that you can design kind of like the UI for the for the app and then it would be designed and then it would be development and then integrating the design testing it and releasing it so me coming from as a developer the thing that I like to do all the time is I like to figure out all of the technical challenges first a guy I like to make sure that I can actually do all of these things before starting on the UI and the design and stuff like that because I feel like there's no point in designing an element or a feature if when it comes down to it I can't achieve it technically right so there's nothing here that like the this I told you guys I don't know how to do right now but I know it can be done so I'm not that worried about having to completely figure that out first right so in the next video in this sort of how to make an app from scratch series I'll be mocking up the screens for this version now I'm not gonna go ahead and wireframe all of the screens for like all of these features because we haven't really figured out exactly which features are gonna make the cut and in what order what I'm gonna be focused on is the timer screen because that's really the screen that people are gonna be spending the most time on right and I think that screen has a lot it has a huge impact on whether that person will use the app or not and this is based on my experience I told you guys I downloaded two Pomodoro apps I launched the first one I tapped on the timer it was confusing I started it and I didn't know how to stop the timer or pause the timer and like I was just trying to figure out how to use it and I just gave up and I just like closed the app and then launched the other one and simply for the fact that I it was easy for me to figure out how to start and stop that timer I ended up sticking with that app and using that up so that's why it's so important for for the UI at some of the other Pomodoro apps out there like I told you reading their reviews especially for the highly rated ones taking a look at maybe I can find a commonality in the UI for all of the highly rated ones that I'm gonna take those considerations into my own design process when I'm like wireframing that up so I'm gonna do that work offline however in the next video I am going to recreate the wireframe with you guys if if I've already done that so that I can show you guys how to use the graphic design tools to create a wireframe I'm not gonna just show up and be like hey guys I created the wireframe here you go this is then you guys want wouldn't be able to do that for your own apps right so in the next video or a livestream whatever it might be I will show you guys how to navigate around a graphics design tool and how to create some wireframes I'm in that tool and I will have figured out what my UI will look like so we'll build that wireframe of that v1 version together in that graphics tool and then from there all right well we'll build it out which is like I'm looking at it it's a pretty simple app and then we're gonna launch it together in the app store so you're gonna get to see you know the things that you're gonna be testing the things that the assets that you'll need will create the app icon launch screen and stuff like that and we'll publish it together and then starting in November when we're gonna when I'm gonna run that challenge we'll take a look at v2 for the app and yeah so hopefully you guys stick around and now we've got about 12 more minutes I'm gonna take a look at what sort of questions you guys have if you have any questions oh sorry about that I will talk louder and into my mic I should move this mic sorry if you guys had trouble hearing me just now but let me take a look at your chat let's see if you guys have any questions for me well the November challenge have a have a theme do you think you guys would want a theme I don't want to restrict you guys to to building something so maybe maybe I could think of a theme that you can follow or not see yes this is how this is gonna be the first time that I'm doing this it might be a freeforall this time because my ultimate goal is just to get people to do things right to get people off of their butt and to actually do something so I haven't yet formalized like what's sort of prizes or recognition there might be and there will be recognition for sure prizes for this first one I'm not but it I do plan for it to be a monthly thing and I want to just motivate people to to get off their butt to do stuff so if you guys have any questions for me just type it into the chat right now I'm just going through the chat mmhmm Iona I missed this the speaker idea that you had which is changing the music or the alarm that sounds depending on the project you're working or maybe having an ability to customize that mmhmm that's kind of cool women right write that down right here just for we use the Pomodoro Technique while developing your Pomodoro up you have my chest my chest maybe you guys let me know like how many of you guys have actually heard of about the Pomodoro Technique before and how many of you guys actually use it yourself I'd be interesting to hear because I think it's a pretty wellknown technique Nelson thank you thank you for your compliment Lauren to ask storyboard or programmatically for the first little complex app it seems like I'm getting I've got this question once every live stream so you have to code well so could you have to sit maybe often uh yeah Lauren to answer your question like really quickly because I have answered this question before maybe I need to do a video on it but for beginners I would recommend using the storyboard because it's just so much easier to be able to visualize and especially when people aren't beginners aren't used to reading code yet or writing code even it can be daunting to create all your auto layout constraints in code and to create all of your elements and code and lay them out but if you're working in a team in a professional environment you're you will probably be forced to create everything programmatically because in my own experience it's working in the professional environment it's just so much easier to merge code like and resolve conflicts programmatically then trying to resolve conflicts in the next ML file which is what the storyboard is and then also there's the aspect that it's faster when you're generating everything programmatically so to answer your question I think they kind of serve different purposes for me Here I am probably going to be doing it via the storyboard I might be taking a hybrid approach when I start getting to the social features and basically when I pull that data down from the database I might be generating some of like the whatever social cards or social history or whatever aspects of it programmatically but for the timer aspect I might do it through storyboard just so because I'm gonna be demonstrating this and I'm then I'm gonna be using this project series as something for beginners to follow that's why I'm opting for that route you know a lot of you guys have heard of it before team film studies make a video on a pedometer core motion please I actually haven't looked into any of that stuff before so your best bet would be to try googling for it first to see of other YouTube or iOS content creators has created any tutorials for that that will be faster than I mean looking into it first and then creating a tutorial with it yeah Christopher awesome I'm glad there's someone that validates the the whole social feature aspect of it the telephone is your worst enemy Karl for me it's it's not my telephone because I never get calls from anyone but um it's probably like firing up a browser tab and like checking my stat YouTube stats or like I don't use Facebook that much so I'm not I'm not really distracted by Facebook because I know some people are and you know personally you know how they say Facebook is bad for you like it causes depression I kind of feel that way not depression per se you know not to that extreme but when I browse people's newsfeed and I see like people are going on vacation and they have these wonderful lives it just makes me like oh man I wish I was there or wish that was me and it just makes me feel bad about myself and so I I don't end up going on Facebook anymore because of that because I feel like people only post you know the best sides of their lives but everyone's lives just has ups and downs right no one has this perfect life that's all rainbows and sunshine but I'm just going off on a tangent I oh no once the next episode gonna be for this app well I am committing to do a livestream like every single Wednesday so if if not before then then it will be definitely next Wednesday but I'm thinking that I might create a standalone video I'm not going to commit to anything because I'm not completely sure but definitely next Wednesday if not before that but make sure you're subscribed it has the chance I'm gonna plug my channel make sure you're subscribed with the red subscribe button below and click that little bell icon to make sure you get notified if you don't want to miss the next episode so I own it thanks for giving me the chance to to plug my channel like that Android user do you prefer sketch or Adobe XD I actually haven't used Adobe XD before and I prefer sketch but I might not use any of those tools because I want to I want to make as much as possible I want to be using free tools so that you guys can follow along with it and so I'm gonna be using figma at least that's in my head that's what I'm gonna do right now and having used both sketch and figma figma is so similar to sketch it's crazy like all of the shortcut keys the buttons and the things that you can do there it's so similar and so yeah but personally if I like if I wasn't doing any demos or anything like that and I'm doing things for myself I I use sketch I haven't used the dhobi XD although I have a Creative Cloud subscription so I I think I will look into it in the future I can't compare I was about to say I haven't used the dhobi XD so I can't compare with Sketch team film studies I want to register user steps taken any experience no I don't have any experience with that but doesn't like does the health I know Apple watch does keep track of your steps but if you didn't have an Apple watch and you only had an iPhone does the health kit like the health app on your phone does it track steps like that I haven't I don't really use the health app on my phone but if it does track steps I would ask do you den need to track your own steps can you take the data from the health app you might be able to with your app excuse me voice prototyping Martin saying that Adobe XD has awesome new features for a voice prototyping I'd I don't even know what that is I gotta look into that that sounds pretty crazy like he's just narrate what happens or something like that I don't know but I'll take a look into it are you guys are some of you guys designers or like graphics professionals let me know let me know down below because when you guys see me using finger sketch I and and you guys are graphics professionals you guys will probably laugh I mean so I am NOT a professional designer but I I can do like the basic stuff and so I will be like I'm able to use it for what I need to use it for but I can still show you guys in case any of you guys don't know how to use fake more sketch at all no jesper so so my plan is to develop to finish the app well to finish V one of the app and launch it by the end of the month and that's like in two weeks right so I can't do it live in the live stream but what I'm gonna do is like I I will have to release videos in between the live streams in order to be able to show you guys start to finish V one out of the door so I know for a fact that I will have to record videos outside of the live stream to do some of this stuff to get it done so I hope that clarifies stuff Robin we have a Facebook group Facebook community you can go and ask those questions and there would be tons of people that'll help you out and just in case you guys don't know we have a CWC well code with chris communty it's a Facebook group tons of people helping each other out and I'm not just saying that I know some Facebook groups are completely dead not ours tons of people in there chatting helping each other out so if you have any questions on any of the tutorials that you see in here or you need help with something you're working on do join the group and post your questions in there and you'll get support so Adrienne thanks for posting the link there you are so anyways guys the hour is up I'm so happy to have spent this hour with you and I'm so glad you guys are on board with this and I feel like I am getting a little more comfortable in front of the camera and doing live streaming for you I've recognized some of the names you guys have attended like all of the three live streams I've done so far so thank you guys for that last question Mohamed what are you used for sketching I just sketch with pencil and a notepad so you know pretty basic stuff but then I'll translate that into wireframes and design which I'll show you guys the next time we talk thank you guys again so much and make sure you subscribe to see either the next video maybe like Friday or Tuesday or if not then I will talk to you guys Wednesday at the same time okay so thank you guys so much I'll chat with you guys later bye and this video will be recorded so if you guys are you coming late and you want to catch up with what happened in the beginning it will be recorded and published on the channel alright I'll see you guys next time bye
