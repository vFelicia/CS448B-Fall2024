hey guys welcome to another episode of learning Objective C with me Chris so today we're going to be talking about class declaration and how to create a new instance of the class hey guys so you'll notice that the font size is huge now so I hope you guys can all see this and I'll make sure that I upload my videos in 1080p so today we're going to be talking about class declaration and this is another this is just a new project that i created in xcode you can either create a new one yourself or you can download this exact sample project in the link in the description so I want to point out that a class in Objective C is made up of two files a dot H and a dot M file and the dot H file as you can see here in view controller dot H is the interface for your class and here you would put all the method declarations the property declarations and the variables that you would want other classes to be able to see and interact with and in your implementation file you would go ahead and implement those methods now let's go through creating a brand new class ourselves so in this project navigator you could rightclick and go new file and it has a couple of different things you can create here so go ahead and do Objective C class okay so you can type in a class name you can call it you know my class and for sub classing you can choose you can choose something like UI view UI view controller now explain what those are in the future video but you really want to choose nsobject for now and this object is the kind of the root class of most class hierarchies and objectivec and if we want to create a class let's say a helper class or a class for some data manager or for our models we would use NS object so I'm going to go ahead and put it in my root directory so as you can see Xcode created two files for us my class H and my class M now let's go ahead and declare it an instance of myclass in viewcontroller so go to view controller dot H and we're going to need to let you controller know about our class so we need to import the header file for our class there we go and in the implementation file we're going to declare a new instance of it I can't type today okay so declaring a variable to store our class so we're declaring a new pointer my class and right now it's nil because we haven't assigned anything to it so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to go class name space Allah and you could see it returns an ID type so remember from the last video that that is an object reference so what the a lock method does is it allocates in memory space for an instance of myclass and it returns an instance of that ok so the standard practice after I allocate an instance of my class is to call initialize on it and this method in it is already in the base class and it's object remember we subclass Dennis object so by default in NS object the initialize method doesn't do anything it just returns itself but what you can do in my class the class that you created is to override the init method with any you know variable initialization Zoar method calls that you need to initialize your class so there you go now instance of myclass would be ready to use now instead of writing this in three lines the common practice is to do it something like this so a class another instance equals my class I log in it so you can kind of chain method calls like this a lakh returns an instance of myclass and your calling in it on that instance but we're getting a little ahead of ourselves because on the next episode I'm going to talk about declaring methods and calling methods you kind of get a preview of it here so that's it for this video I want to thank you guys for letting me know that it's hard to read the text on the screen because it's only with that sort of feedback that I can improve these videos for you guys now the next question I want to ask you is would you rather me type as I did in this video and then I'm explaining the stuff as I'm typing it or would you rather me have everything typed out beforehand and just explain it to save some time so let me know in the comments section below so that I can tailor it the way you guys want now for your fun fact of the day did you know that the first iPhone was actually invented in 1983 well it's actually a prototype and apparently there were many prototypes after that but this one looks kind of cool so here's an image of it it looks like an iPad with a phone put together now do you think in 1983 that this would have taken off as the iPhone did in this age well let me know in the comments section below I'll see you guys next time you
