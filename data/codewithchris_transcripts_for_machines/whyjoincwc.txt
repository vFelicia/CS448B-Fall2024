hey it's Chris here thank you so much for learning with us now you may or may not have known but we do have a paid program called CWC plus and we've made some big improvements to it so I want to show you what it is full disclosure of this video is all about CWC plus and how it may be able to help you achieve your goals but if you're not interested in joining a paid program that's totally fine feel free to click out of this video and I'll see you in the next YouTube tutorial I still very much appreciate that you are here learning with us so thank you for that however if you are interested and hearing about the program or if you're on the fence about joining then let's dive in and see how CWC plus may be able to help you so if you're setting out to learn iOS whether it's to get a job or to build your own apps for Fun and Profit you have several options these are all The Usual Suspects and they all have their pros and cons but if we were to measure it in terms of time and financial commitment it would look something like this you might be confused about why free resources take up a lot of time and that's because you have to spend time digging through all of the free resources to find the ones that are right for you and then you have to spend time piecing it together yourself into a learning path and then often times the result is a learning path with material from multiple sources now I might be biased but I personally think that online courses are The Sweet Spot because they are typically not that expensive they're flexible for your schedule and there's usually some sort of curriculum that the course takes you through however even if you find a great online course there are still potential issues for example there may be a teaching Style mismatch for some reason you're just not understanding the way that the instructor is presenting it or maybe it's too technical it's too fast it could be a variety of reasons but the teaching style is just not for you the training material could be outdated with apple making changes and updates every single year training material gets outdated pretty quickly unless the instructor or the course owner is updating the material actively there may not be enough support for you as you are going through your Learning Journey if you have questions how fast are you getting a response are you getting helped personally or are you being sent to an FAQ or to browse comment sections don't overlook support this is a huge part of being able to learn something there could be a lack of direction does the course just get you to build a whole bunch of apps or does it actually have a clear goal that by the end of the course you will have gained some tangible skills that are actually useful towards a bigger Journey with which leads us to number five is there a lack of progression so you don't just want to take one course and that's it because usually one course is not enough to get you to the result that you want the thing you should look out for is there a progression or path that you are working towards to ultimately help you achieve your goal now let me explain to you how CWC plus addresses these problems you see cc+ used to be a big library of courses and this year we realized that it is not a very effective way to help students achieve a result so we had to make a change we've redesigned CWC plus to be for people who have a goal of building apps for Fun and Profit and for people who want to start a career in iOS so when you join CWC plus that's what we're working towards we're going to help you get there through a series of programs each with specific outcomes the first program that everyone starts with is launch your first app the transformation you'll make from taking this program is going from no coding experience to having a published app in the app store the program consists of Foundations networking databases and the App Store course each of these courses have their own agenda but they were actually designed together as a progression towards the end goal of publishing an app in other words each course builds off of the previous course so that by the time you get to the App Store course you have a wellrounded set of skills to design and publish your own apps after you graduate from launch your first app you're ready for the next program to take you another step closer to your ultimate goal we're designing and launching the rest of the programs in 2024 so that covers Direction and progression now let's talk about support and I would argue that having proper support is half of the learning experience and is absolutely crucial for you to make progress on your iOS Journey now inside CWC plus each student gets personalized chat support with one of our coaches to get through all of the material in the launch your first app program now I don't know of any other courses that do that and I think it's a huge advantage of learning with us now to talk about how updated these courses are all of the courses of launch your first app was recorded this year so that's about as updated as you can get finally in regards to teaching style I'm the instructor for all of the courses in the program and you can get a sense of my teaching from this video right here so you can watch that and you can see if you're actually getting results by learning with me before you commit to joining CWC plus so if CWC plus sounds like something that can benefit you right now we are running Black Friday Limited Time pricing go ahead and visit cc. to/ bf22 3 to see it and I'll also include the link in the description below the video now whether or not you decide to join the program I still really appreciate that you're here learning with us so give it some thought and hopefully I'll see you inside if not I'll see you in the next YouTube video thanks for watching and take care
