hey everyone in this lesson I'll show you guys how to play a sound within your app and it's actually very simple so I'm going to start with a demo Xcode project I'm just gonna create a single view application I'm gonna call it sound demo and I'm just gonna save it on my desktop okay so the first thing we're going to want to do is add the avfoundation framework down here and your project properties so you just click this Add icon and type in AV and you'll see it double click it and you're gonna add this framework to your project and this gives us the classes that we need in order to play sound and it happens to also be the same framework for playing video but that was covered in another video so the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to create a folder create a new group for my sounds just to keep things organized and I happen to have an mp3 sound which I'm just going to drag from my file system into this group so if you're if your sound file isn't in the project folder then you can check this check mark right here and it's gonna copy your sound file into your project folder and it's a good idea to keep all of your resources and files inside your project folder so that if you do happen to send it to someone or to let's say check in your code into source control that you don't leave out any files that it needs so if your Xcode project is referring to files you know all over your file system on your computer and you check in just your source code folder then when someone downloads your source code they're gonna have broken references in their project so that's one thing to watch out for now on the other hand if you copy the sound file into your project folder first and then you're dragging it into your Xcode project then you probably don't need to check this because it's already in your project folder so i'm gonna click finish and i can see that it's right here and you can even actually play it in here so it's just a single sound like that and i am going to just demonstrate a simple example to play that sound within the app and hmm why don't we invoke it on a button press so i'm gonna go into the storyboard here go into my object library and make sure that you're looking at this objects tab right here because there are a few and your objects library time might look like this so you know that's okay to just type in button and you should see it if you don't see this pane at all you can go like that click this icon up here to toggle the pane so I'm going to just strike the button on here I'm gonna flip over to the attributes inspector so I can change the name you just call it play sound and enlarge this button a little bit more and if you're a member of my course or you've read some of my tutorials might have already learned how to connect the button handler to this button so I'm just gonna do that right now I'm going to click this button up here to open the system editor and I'm gonna make sure that my righthand side shows the view controller dot M I'm gonna hold down control I'm gonna drag this guy over here and then let go okay so in this way I've created a method that will get fired when the button is tapped so in here I'm going to go back to single view here back to view controller dot M and up here I'm going to create an instance variable for my audio player I'm going to create a AV audio player actually you know what I have to import the framework first so this variable is just going to hold a reference to the audio player object that I'm going to create here so first of all I'm going to create a string for the path of the sound and this is going to be I'm going to have to construct it basically from the main bundle path along with the filename so the main bundle is just a name for your app package and getting the path of the main bundle is just a dynamic way of getting the path to this sound file within your app package so I explained this line in a second so we want to get the main bundle and I can get the three source I should be able to get the resource path of that okay so what I'm doing here is I'm accessing the main bundle which is our app package and I'm getting the path for the resources which is where my sound is going to be contained and that path is going into this wild card character here / drum 0 1 dot mp3 which is the sound file name and just like that I will have a string representing the path within my app package to the sound okay and because the audio player only accepts an nsurl I can create an nsurl variable from the path from the stream path using this class method here file URL with path and we can pass in the string path and just like that now we have an nsurl object ready to pass into our audio player so I'm going to assign to our audio player variable a new the audio player object so I locate the space for it and we're going to use an initialization method called init with contents of URL and we are going to pass in sound URL and for errors put nil so I'm not checking for errors and then simply when the button is tapped we can call audio player play the the method to play the sound so let's write some documentation here button is tapped play sound here construct your sound file in here create audio player object and initialize with a URL sound alright so let's give this a run and hopefully if everything goes well it works okay so just like that pretty simple example it's pretty easy to play a sound within your app as you can see so that's it for this video I'm going to link to the AV audio player class documentation in case you want to explore it some more and I'll also link to the source code for this demo but you should try to build it yourself just for practice that would be a very good exercise to do so I hope you enjoyed that and I'll see you guys next time bye
