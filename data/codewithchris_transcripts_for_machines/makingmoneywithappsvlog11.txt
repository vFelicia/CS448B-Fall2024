hello and welcome back so I've gathered up all of the issues and feedback from our internal testing and I want to show you what we have to fix with our app before we can submit it to Apple for review and I've also read your comments in the last Vlog where I asked for some advice about scroll Direction so I want to go through that as well by the way thank you for commenting but before we dive in I want to just let you know in case you're new here this is a raw and unscripted video series chronicling our team's journey and building apps for profit this entry is dated April 23rd 2024 with that said I hope you enjoy hello welcome back thank you everyone who commented in the last Vlog where I was looking for some advice just for context in case you didn't watch the previous one this is what I asked in this entry log here it's in chronological order which way should you scroll to see previous entries should the most recent entry be at the top of the list or at the bottom of the list right and the reason I struggled with this is because the way that it felt natural I felt like the most recent one should be at the top and these ones below it should be older ones but that is opposite of a calendar where future dates should be at the bottom and you're scrolling to see the future so I the calendar I had this flipped around because when you're reading a calendar April 30th when you go to the right this should be May 1st not March 1st so for the calendar this felt really wrong and so I'm going to flip this around but on a list it's opposite and that's exactly what everyone touched on in the comments here so let me just read some of most recent at the top in the past scrolling down feels more natural great video for sure it helps thank you so much um it's the difference between chronological order and a todo list mentality if it was todo list then most critical things at top if you're dealing with chronological I think the latest thing should be at the bottom as long as you don't have to scroll to find it um here I agree with what you said about the calendar it should move to the next month as you scroll down as you scroll down you're looking at the feature dates this paragraph is about the padding of the date or the entry field I think I'll take this into consideration I'm not going to read it right now because it doesn't pertain to the list scrolling but thank you so much much for commenting about that because I really value uh everyone's input that's how we're going to make a stronger product and that's part of the Great reason uh to share these Vlogs that I can hear all your input before I actually have to release it so thank you for talking about the padding I will read that and consider that on the log screen the historical entry date should be below the current date so it's almost like uh a log of your account purchases or in a bank statement if you imagine in a bank statement I think the most recent ones are always at the top and as you're scrolling down you're seeing older purchases like on a credit card statement for example so it's the opposite of both elements what you currently have yeah and can how do you design yourself an app icon any any tutorials you know what there are a lot of Cool Tools AI based tools where you can generate app icons I would take a look into that and see what you get it's Hit or Miss but I would take a stab at that just because sometimes you might get a quick win add the ability to log multiple moods per day you can actually do this first thank you code please yeah I don't think I'll be sharing the code for this particular app because we're going to be submitting this but I might show how to do something similar and I am recording a different app series I released a poll recently on the YouTube channel about what type of app you want me to build and do a tutorial series on and a YouTube API app was the winner so I'm going to be I'm building that right now I'm going to be recording that and I'll definitely give you the code for that okay so in conclusion based off of your comments and how I feel I think I'm going to fix the calendar so that as you scroll down you're seeing future months so this would be May 1st and then June 1st and so on and then on the list entry the log um of entries it's going to be the op opposite way so the most recent thing is going to be at the top and then you're going to be scrolling down to see previous dates and that feels the most natural to me at yeah as most of you have touched upon and then you would you wouldn't be able to see future dates this doesn't make sense you shouldn't be able to see entries for future dates or log entries for future dates so now I want to take a look at some of the test flight entries as I mentioned in the previous video right here we're doing internal testing through uh test flight and in case you don't know what that is it's where you distribute your app to uh people and they can beta test your app and they can submit feedback to you and it looks like this so inside App Store connect this is where you managed your app store listings we had a whole bunch of feedback what I've done I've taken all of them except these two because I don't think we're going to work on these two but I've taken all of them and I have gone into our project tracker and I have logged the items in the backlog for us to work on so I want to go through some of these things with you so the good news is that none of these items are really big issues to fix I think they're all very small some mostly cosmetic type of things let's take a look so in dark mode testing when I showed you in the simulator it was only in in light mode or natural mode the default mode but when your phone is on dark mode it uh it makes our titles unreadable this screen is messed up the setting screen here you know the yeah again the titles these pills are really hard to read so this is just a color tweak like I can't even read that text field so that's that apostrophes this is where we have SLS instead of apostrophes all over the app so that needs to be fixed let's see where here one word is that we're using Monday as our project management tool it doesn't really matter what you use to track all of your issues and bugs so this is not a recommendation to use Monday for this sort of stuff filter button does nothing so we're going to remove it that's a phase two type thing calendar direction we talked about this future dates was not to show we don't need to show future dates it doesn't really make sense custom entry error checking so this is a big deal actually so we have the ability for people to enter custom mood custom weather custom anything and I was able to enter like blank text so spaces essentially so we need to do some error checking on that and this button back to today there's supposed to be a green pill right here that's says back today let me see if I can it's not exactly working but sometimes it shows up I don't know when exactly it shows up but there's because you can get lost while scrolling there is a green button here that should take you back to today okay swipe down confirmation so this one was when you're logging your mood we implemented it as a slide up sheet let me see if I can show you so when you click this button it slides up if I'm logging my mood right here like this I've made some sele if I swipe down I lose all my work it's gone so I think we should add a dialogue to capture that event just to ensure that they know they're about to lose their work so this one is about Apple guidelines destructive things should be read save and exit that's not destructive they usually delete discard that's destructive and that should be read so this should not be read don't show scroll bar this is just one thing which popped up there shouldn't be a scroll bar and to implement analytics so we haven't done that we definitely should Implement anal analytics even if it is a first iteration so those that's it it's a pretty small feature set so there weren't too many things to nitpick on I think after this we are ready to submit the app so we're targeting actually I'm still waiting on estimations but I don't think this should take more than hopefully we submit this next week at some point that's my hope so that's where we're at right now again thank you so much if you've been watching and following Along on this journey it's been quite a ride so far but it doesn't stop after we submit this and get it reviewed and publish it because from then on we have to worry about marketing the app and getting users and reading their feedback and things like that and we're continually going to improve the app and in the meantime we're also going to think about the next app idea and work on the next thing stay tuned thanks for watching again and I'll see you in the next vlog
