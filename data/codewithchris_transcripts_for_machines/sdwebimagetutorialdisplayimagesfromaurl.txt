hey coders how's it going it's Chris here and today I'm going to show you how to use this library called SD web image now if you've ever used uiimageview in your application and you wanted to grab an image off the internet kind of like this one how I have it on my server you can very easily do that with SD web image now what does is it adds a method to your uiimageview class called set image with URL and then very simply it's going to fetch that image asynchronously in the background and then when it's done it's going to load it into your uiimageview so all you have to do really is to specify the URL of the image so like I said very handy to have now we're going to install this library as a cocoa pod and if you didn't watch my tutorial on how to install and setup cocoa pods just click on that thumbnail in the upper right hand corner and it'll take you to the video set up only takes less than 5 minutes you'll be up and running in no time so if you have cocoa pods installed and ready to go we're going to just scroll down to the section installing with cocoa pods and we're going to follow these instructions here but first let's create our Xcode project so I'm going to create a brand new single view application here so I'm just going to call it SD web image demo and make sure that the language is Swift and these options down here don't really matter for this demo and click Next and I'm going to save it on the desktop now that our project is set up I'm going to close Xcode I'm going to close that project and press command space bar and type in terminal because we're going to have to initialize the pod file for our project so I saved it on the desktop by pressing PWD I can see which directory I am and now I know I just have to type cd' desktop to go to the desktop folder and it since it's on my desktop I can type in CD SD web I'm gonna type tab to autocomplete that and now I'm inside my project folder and then I'm going to type pod in it so that's going to create the pod file let's take a look at our project folder to see if it indeed if it has that so there it is the pot file now I'm going to rightclick open with and I'm going to open it in my text editor sub lime text you can download that if you want but you can also open it in your own text editor now if we're using Swift it says here be sure to uncomment the use frameworks and set our target to eight so we're going to uncomment this platform we're going to uncomment use frameworks and inside here we're just going to copy this command C and command V we're going to put it in there now I'm going to save it by pressing command S and let's go back to terminal and then LS we can see our pod file there and let's type in pod install just to let you know it can take a little while you can see for me I cancelled it and restarted it because I thought it wasn't working but after I let it be for a few minutes it just went and did its thing so just a heads up it can take a little while so now that this is completed we can open up our Xcode project again so let's go into our project directory it's created this XC workspace file for us which is the one we're going to use and open okay so first off I'm going to press command B just to build the project and then next I'm going to go to the storyboard and I'm going to add an image view to our storyboard so I'm just going to put it right there I'm going to Center it horizontally and vertically and I'm actually going to give it a defined height and width as well because I have I'm going to download this logo and I know the height and width here so with this 522 and height is through 24 so let's go ahead and add those so height so with this 522 and height is 324 let's add those constraints and let's update the frames for that guy and so there it is next I'm going to go into assistant editor and then I'm going to create an outlet for this image view I'm going to call it I'm just going to call it image view because what I'm going to do let's go back to standard view control about Swift I'm going to do is load the image through this URL right here so let's just copy that URL for now let's go up here and write import SD web image because we're going to be using that and then now in the viewdidload I can type image view dot SD you can see there's a bunch of new methods that wouldn't have existed if I didn't use SD image view set image with URL okay and there's a couple of different ones where you can specify a completed block of code to execute after the image has been downloaded and set you can also specify placeholder image to show before the image has finished downloading I'm just going to use this basic one right here that's going to download the image at the specified URL and then it's going to set that image view with that downloaded image up here let's create an nsurl first so let image URL equals nsurl I'm going to create this one with a string take note that it returns an optional NS URL type so there's my URL and it returns an optional right so let's specify that and then if it does have a value so let's use optional binding if let URL equals image URL so if that URL exists then I'm going to set the image view with it after it downloads the image I'm going to pass it into this method right here alright and that's basically it so I'm going to run it and you're going to see hopefully this works all right there we go that might have been a little fast but it did go out and download that image and set it into my image view now it's a little bigger because I did actually set the width of my image view to be 522 and that's wider than this view is the great thing about this is if I stop the app and I run it again you're going to see that it's really fast because it does cache the image so it's not going to redownload the if it doesn't need to so this is just a quick video to show you how handy a little library like SD web image is I hope you guys have enjoyed it tomorrow there won't be a video because I'm going to be spending Christmas day with my family so I'll talk to you guys on Monday instead all right thank you so much for watching please subscribe and share and like this video happy holidays to everyone and I'll see you guys on Monday bye for now
