hey it's chris here and i just wanted to give you a week to summary so last week bowen worked on the back end so he set up the web server with the database and the authentication piece and i'm going to actually let him chime in on that experience and what it was like to build that in just a second but i do want to say that i sat down with ellen and we had discussed where this was going and what it would look like in three months when it was done and it made us realize that maybe we have taken on a lot more than we bargained for because this idea is essentially almost its own separate business right you're helping content creators um create their own app and get it in the app store and you're gonna have to have people supporting them um you know helping them walk through issues for submitting their app and wanting customizations and initially i thought about all the cool things that could come out of that like we could do you know consultation requests and all that but i still think there is a need for people who want to build apps who don't necessarily learn to code but i think for the scope of the case study that might be too big of a problem to tackle and i think that i basically bit off more than i can chew so um while it's still early while it's still two weeks in and we still have you know two and a half months um we're hitting the reset button and this time i want to create an app where the end user is someone in the app store finding the app and using it and we're targeting you know consumers rather than um business owners or other content creators or influencers so it's going to be a selfcontained app where the product is the app in the app store itself and i think this makes for a much stronger case study especially um for what we're trying to do here at code with chris which is to show people teach people how to code and to build apps and i think we can also control the scope so that it is you know maybe a single focus app that does one thing well something we can build in two and a half months get it launched do some marketing for it and um i think this is the direction that most people who are picking up coding and wanting to learn how to build apps this is the direction that they're going rather than trying to build you know a business that helps other content creators build their own apps you know so that's i wanted the case study to to reflect something that would be useful for people so in short we're going to hit the reset button next week you're going to see me give updates on this new direction we're going what new app idea we've decided on and we're going to go through that validation phase all over again but we're just gonna choose a smaller scope so that we can still finish in three months all right thanks for following along i'm gonna pass it to boa now to talk a little bit about his experience hi i'll be going over the simple web server and database that i built for our original app idea the purpose of this was so that users could create an account and create a config for themselves over here the server displays all the database items and over here we should see that we have two users one with test name and one with the new username through our front end we could create a new user so this demo with any password and then in our server we see that it updates the database appropriately we can update the information for the config like so save it and this gets communicated to the server which then updates the database as well and then we see over here in this entry the name channel and other information are all updated in the database item in the front end if we refresh the page and we log in again we see that the front end communicates with the server and pulls the data from the database overall this was extremely valuable learning experience for me in terms of figuring out how to set up a database how to set up server as well as communicating between the front end and the backend and integrating everything together and although there's still areas of improvement such as adding authentication using tokens and verifying password encryptions i believe that this was still extremely valuable learning experience and it will help me create better apps in the future thank you i just want to say although we're not using that server and back end piece right now it was really interesting to see that come together and also bo and i learned a lot from um you know having to think through how that would work and we learned a lot in the process and so that's something that i want to share with you guys in the future as well so it's not you know wasted work we're going to turn it into a meaningful tutorial and demo that we can present and hopefully you guys can learn from that as well alright thanks for watching i'll see you guys in the next video
