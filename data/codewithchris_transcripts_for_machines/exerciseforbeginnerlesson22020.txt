hello and welcome to the lesson to exercise now if you haven't checked out the beginner series yet I would highly recommend that you do that because this exercise is specifically intended to be done after you've completed lesson two so go ahead and check out the beginner series either in the link in the description below or check up in the upper right corner so this is what you're going to be completing as part of this exercise now have all of the image assets that you need for download just below the video so go ahead and grab those assets fire up a brand new single view application Xcode project and using what you've learned to try to put this together so at this point what I do is just pause the video and try this out for yourself if you get stuck something doesn't look right you can't get something looking the way you want then come back and watch this video from this point on because from here on out I'm going to be building this and showing you how to do it so here I've started a brand new Xcode project I'm going to choose single view app and let's call this a lesson 2 exercise solution and you know all of this stuff is fine I mean all we're doing is customizing how it looks in the storyboard so we're gonna be working in the storyboard here the first thing to do though is grab those image assets and put them into your asset library so I've actually got them right here so I'm just gonna grab them all and put them in so let's just take a look at what we have we have this breakfast image which is from pixels comm and I've got the icon and then I've got a gradient for the bottom and the gradient for the top now gradients can actually be done you don't have to use image assets but at this point in your iOS journey this is probably the easiest way for you to do it so I'm gonna start here by first putting in that big breakfast image let's open up the object library and choose image view and if you don't remember the shortcut key just click on this icon up here we're gonna add the image view so let's also stretch it out to all four sides we're going to uncheck constrain to margins because we want it to be to the very edge and we're also going to make sure that each of these margins that we're specifying is relative to the view and not the safe area and then we're going to proceed to set them all to zero so let's go ahead and add these four constraints and then set the image for this guy to our breakfast now just in case it's a little bit stretched change the content mode from scale to fill which is the default two aspect fill and that's going to maintain the proper aspect ratio while filling up the space of the uiimageview you can see that it looks a little bright we're gonna add our gradients now so again open up your object library and just put an image down there like that and this time we're going to add three constraints left right and top and this is going to be that top gradient so I'm going to go ahead and open this guy up uncheck constrain to margins again enable the three and then I'm going to make sure that it's relative to the view so it goes to the very edge because we want it to be at the very edge and not it doesn't matter if it's obscured by the battery indicator or the time or the notch or anything like that and so that's why we specify this relative to the view and not the safe area all right so we get some constraint errors but let's set the image first so we're gonna choose top gradient and that is going to that's going to look okay like that we're gonna add a second image view and put it near the bottom right here and this one's going to be the bottom gradient and we're going to set the left right and bottom constraints for this guy so same exact thing uncheck constraint margins we're going to enable these three and then we're going to choose relative to the view okay now let's set these guys go zero and then click add three constraints then we're going to set the image to bottom gradient so we get something like that now the next step is to add the icon first so again we're going to be adding another image view like that and I'm going to set the image to heart health and then I'm going to add a top and right margin and this time I'm going to leave this on and I'm going to leave it relative to the safe area I'm gonna say oops I don't want it add constraint just the left and the right sorry the top and the right let's add these two and we've got our little icon there alright we're nearly there so let's add our label right here and this one let's just change the text to white first so we can actually see what it's saying and then we are going to leave constraint margins on I'm going to do left and top and we're going to do 20 and 20 and again this is by default relative to the safe area so we know that this label isn't going to get blocked by anything so let's add these two constraints right there and we're gonna set the toast to I think it was hardcore above toast and then we're going to click this font and let's just make it a little bigger I forget exactly what size I used but let's say 30 and I think actually I had a custom font so I used that you can choose anything you want it doesn't really matter I'm going to choose a veneer next deme bold and just do 40 oh that's way too big 30 all right and what you can do at this point if you want it to wrap to two lines you can change your number of length is zero which just means multi lines and you can actually either set a width so if you set a width say cutting it off right here at the point at the a it's going to automatically wrap a vote oast to the next line or you can change your text and you can manually specify a line break so hold down control and hit enter like that to create a double line label you just hit enter so you've got that and we're gonna add another label this time down here and let's set this font to white and we're going to make this label cling on to the left the right and the bottom and just say 20 20 and 20 and again let's make this a multiline label by setting the number of lines to zero and I forget exactly what text I had but let me just write something here this breakfast is so healthy and will give you so much energy that you'll be able to accomplish anything today actually I don't think I had this much text in in the version I showed you but it's fine so you know even though I might not have chose the exact font size and the exact font that I used in the demo that I showed you in the beginning of the video you kind of get the idea about how to build this UI so I hope you were able to do it on your own if not I hope you're able to do it after watching this I would give it another try if you got stuck just so you can get some extra practice and because it's really once you start doing it you're going to then realize what you don't know if you're just watching me you don't know what you don't know right so definitely give it a try all right I'll see you in the next one
