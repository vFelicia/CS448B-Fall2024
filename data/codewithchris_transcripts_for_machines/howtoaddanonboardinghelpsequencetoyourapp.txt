pay code crew what's up it's Chris here in this video I want to showcase a code library written by one of my community members his name is Stuart and he's actually written quite a number of helpful libraries this one in particular that I want to show you is called CT help and it's a very easy way to drop in a help system or some sort of welcome screen in my opinion it can also be used like that so what it is it's a set of swipeable cards that you can configure so you can do images images with text you can do no images and text only you can have buttons to visit a website or to launch the ticketing system or something like that so it's flexible and it's really easy to drop into any app so I want to show you how that's done let's get to it so this is where you can get CT help it's on github and it's actually available as a cocoa pod here called CT help now if you're not familiar with cocoa pods I have a video just for you so you can go ahead and click in the upper right hand corner and watch that first to install it on your system I'm gonna do it the cocoa pod way so I'm going to create a brand new Xcode project I'm going to choose single view app for the purpose of this demonstration I call this CT help demo and I'm just going to pop this onto my desktop got a ton of stuff on my desktop there okay so now we're going to close it and we're going to open up terminal so that we can navigate to our directory CD desktop and the CT help now if any of what I'm doing right now is a little foreign to you I highly recommend that you go and watch that cocoa pod video that I have first because it shows you how to do all this setup that I'm doing so now that I'm in the project directory I am going to type in pod in it and then I'm going to open up that folder and I'm going to add the pod that we need so that's just this one right here yeah save it let's close it let's go back to terminal and type in pod install all right now let's open up the XC workspace and we are ready to go all right so first things first is we're gonna put a button on the main screen here to launch the help system so I'm just gonna put a button say Center it horizontally I'll just make it 200 from the top and I will call this guy launch help or something like that let's open up assistant editor and I am going to add an IB action help tapped all right so this is going to allow me to detect when the user has tapped on that button so that I can execute some code to launch that menu system let's go back to standard editor and go to the view controller here the next thing I want to do is import CT help that's gonna let me use all of those classes in his library now let's go back to the github page and take a look at how to do this so all we need to do is create a new CT help object here and each of the cards is represented by a CT help item now there are a couple of ways that you can configure each of these cards you can give it a title you can give it some text and then you can give it an image name now this image name references some assets in your asset library on Xcode so we're gonna have to put some assets in there if we want to see some images and then however many cards you need you just create CT help items and into your CT help object here using this new method there are more sort of configuration properties that you can set if you want to configure the way that that card system looks so you can take a look at this in more detail to configure it and lastly present help from the view controller or whoever you're trying to present this from and you're going to be able to show your help system alright so let's do that I'm actually going to I'm going to take Stewart's sample cards here okay so let's create a separate function just like he has show help and let's create a new CD help sit help equals CT help create a new object and let's name it how he named it here alright so I've got three cards I have to add some images this one is an image only so it's got a full sized image just got a small image on top of some text here and this last card has a whole bunch of text now one thing I forgot to mention if you want those last cards where you have these two and we're visit the company website or contact the developer that's actually coming from this right here this line of code so I'm gonna grab that as well alright and then lastly we're going to call CT help dot present help and do it from here all right let's go ahead and add a couple of images I'm going to use icons eight here for my images and this is an icon service which is really helpful I use it for everything if you want to find the link to this just check the description below the video let's see let's add this magnifying glass icon I'm choosing the size here so this is gonna be my big size image and I am also going to grab a smaller one let's just grab this phone one let's grab the green one and let's grab it as a smaller size I'm just gonna drag it right out of this helper app that icons eight has and it's going to create the file on my desktop and I'm going to add these two assets into my asset library like that this is called icons 8 search icons 8 the phone with a dash in the middle so I'm just going to change that this was the search this was the phone and now all I have to do is call the show help method that was going to run all of this code so let's give this a run and see what we get so as you can see it's literally just drop in and go so here goes let's click on the button and there we go we have our scrollable cards so this first one is the image only then we've got the smaller image with the text and we've got full text and this even has a built in scroll view so that's nice we've got the company card and then we've also got the contact card so this was very very easy to drop in and add to my app and I can see myself using this as a sort of welcome screen to or like a starter tutorial on how to use the app now stewards actually got his own set of videos and helped guide for this library so in addition to this video if you want more detail I mean there was a lot more detail on the github page itself with different configuration options like colors and stuff like that he also has an article I scroll all the way to the top where he has a lot more detail again so you can see more examples of how to use this library and he's even got a youtube video that walks through how to install it and how to set it up so I'm going to link to all of those things in the description below if you want to check out some more of Stewart's libraries feel free to go to his github page he also has another one which I want to take a look at in the future called the what's new template and it's an easy way of dropping in a dialog like this I just go ahead and click on Stewart Lynch right there and go to his repositories and you'll see a bunch of different things that he's written that could be useful for your app if you want to check out more cool and useful libraries that you can add to your app I have a github library's playlist make sure you check that out on the screen right now alright so thanks for watching if
