hey it's Chris here and today I'm going to show you how to use a disclosure group inside your Swift UI project now a disclosure group allows you to show or hide content depending on the state of the disclosure group all right let's Dive Right In before we begin one quick note we have a free exco project containing sample code for all of the Swift UI components use it for your own projects or just to learn from get it at scen I have a couple of toggle switches I have a stepper right here and sometimes when you're doing all of these settings you want to hide it under a group and that's exactly what the disclosure group is for so let me show you how that works all I'm going to do is I'm going to wrap this entire vstack that contains these elements inside of a disclosure group so here's what it looks like disclosure group and you just have to add a title so I'll call this audio settings and the content this can be a closure containing all of your stuff right here right so what's instantly happened is I have a category now a disclosure group and I can expand it to show my elements so let's go ahead and add some padding in there actually like that now what you can also do is use a disclosure group inside of a form so let's wrap this into a form inside a form and see what that looks like get rid of that padding there all right so this looks like a typical settings inside an IOS app right and that's how easy it is to use now let's take it one step further if you want to programmatically control the disclosure group or perhaps detect programmatically whether it's open or closed there's another parameter called is expanded and you can bind it to a Boolean State Property so create one here so we'll say false like that and then just bind to that and by using this you can control the state of the disclosure group and you can also detect whether it's open or closed if you want to download the sample code for this we've got it all in a single handy xcode project in fact it contains a sample code for all of the Swift UI components so that you can learn from or copy and paste the code into your own project just visit cc. swiftui dkit it's a free download I'll leave it in the description below the video too
