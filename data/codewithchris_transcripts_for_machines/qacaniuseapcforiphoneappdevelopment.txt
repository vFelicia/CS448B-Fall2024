hello welcome to the code with Chris Q&A where I'll take a couple of minutes to answer questions that you guys have so for today I have a question that I commonly get from people who are looking to get started in building apps and that question is can I use a PC or do I need a Mac to build apps and let me just put this into context because I teach how to build iPhone and iPad apps so the answer is yes you do need a map if you want to use the Apple supported tools basically the tools that Apple has provided for us developers to build their iOS apps however there are thirdparty tools and thirdparty solutions that can be used on the PC to build iOS apps so for the rest of this short segment I just want to go through some of those options and pros and cons before we get into that another kind of related question that I get sometimes is can I use an iPad to build apps for the iPhone or iPad and the answer is no because the tools that apple provides us it's called Xcode it's the application where we actually write our code in to build those apps that application is only available on the Mac on OSX to be specific so you can only install and use it if you have a Mac computer okay so that's the get an apple supported tool now onto the PC solutions one of the things which I've seen people do is to virtualize the OSX platform on their PC so they're having a virtual Mac running on their PC so it can get a little technical and how to set that up so I'll leave it up to you guys to look into that so that's virtualization another solution is that you can rent a Mac remotely so there are services like Mac and cloud comm where you can pay a monthly fee and you can remotely log into one of their Macs and you can use it for app development in fact on their site I believe that this is one of the the main features that they promote and lastly another set of solutions are all of these crossplatform tools that are available on the PC so some of them are AB cellar ater PhoneGap unity xamarin all of these tools that are available on the pc these development environments are designed for you to be able to write your code and build your app once but then be able to deploy and deploy it's just a fancy word for export into an app these tools allow you to code your at once and then deploy it onto multiple platforms and that's why they're called crossplatform tools now you might be thinking right off the bat that this sounds good this is exactly what you want to use but as with anything where there are alternatives there's definitely pros and cons so the pro obviously is that you can write your code once and you can deploy to multiple platforms however because they aren't Apple supported and basically they're taking your code and translating it to use the Apple software development kit and hit those device api's or device interfaces it's not perfect so if Apple releases a brand new feature tomorrow and they release it they release support for it on their support a tool on their official tool called Xcode and they you know they update to iOS 9 or whatever the iOS is at when you listen to this the other crossplatform tools will have to kind of play catchup there will be a little bit of time where they are retooling to provide support for these new features and the other thing is that there may be bugs because at the end of the day it's a translation that's not perfect so on many of these crossplatform tools you may encounter bugs which you otherwise would not have encountered if you are using the Apple the official Apple tools to build apps and furthermore there may be some features that are totally unsupported in these crossplatform tools I've only listed a handful of these crossplatform tools but maybe in the future I'll do another segment where I more indepth into these PC solutions if you guys are interested my focus and experience has been with Xcode the the tools that apple provides us so I can't comment too much about the other tools which I have mentioned I can't compare them too much until I do some research and look into them myself but the lessons that I teach in the courses which I provide on my site they are with the Apple provided tools so if you want to build a iPhone and iPad apps using the Apple tools then this is the place to be so thanks for tuning in and I'll see you guys next time bye for now
