hey it's Chris and today I'm going to show you how to use a swiftui group box you see them everywhere and they kind of look like this this gray box around these elements and I know I know you could use a rounded gray rectangle to put it as a background but why do that when you can use a group box all right let's dive in and check it out before we begin one quick note we have a free exco project containing sample code for all of the Swift UI components use it for your own projects or just to learn from get it at SL Swift ui kit so I've got a new xcode project here with simply a label on the screen now if we wanted to use a group box to wrap around this text element this is what you would do group Box open a curly bracket you have the closing one and then you simply put the label inside of it and get a group box and it's literally as simple as that so why don't we make it a little more complicated and I'll also show you a couple of options to make it a little more interesting so let's change the text label to be um a toggle and instead of constant let's just sorry instead of binding let's put a constant okay and then you can see how the group box is now push through the edge let's add some padding so you can actually see the whole thing and let's add a second toggle now let's say you wanted to change the background color of your group box you could do that by adding a modifier to it now don't add the background one what you actually want is background style and then let's say you wanted to change it to uh I don't know red no one would really use red um but if you did Black you'd have to change the text color and to change the text color you would do foreground style for example right um I'm going to remove those because I just want to keep it gray now there is another option for the group box if you open up the initializers there is a label parameter what is that well let's take a look so let's go back let's just add the label parameter ourselves so in this label parameter you can add an element let's say text uh settings that or better yet you can use a label instead of a text component you can use a label component so a label component lets you add a piece of text with a SF icon which is handy so we can do settings and then for the system image if you know the icon name that you would like to use such as as gear oh sorry yes gear then you would get that so that's how simple it is to use group box it's great for grouping groups of information so in particular if you look at the health app on your iPhone it uses a lot of group boxes for things like your weight your exercise uh log your you know heart rate log and things like that it groups all of those different categories of information using group boxes now you know how to use them as well if you want to download the sample code for this we've got it all in a single handy EXO project in fact it contains a sample code for all of the Swift UI components so that you can learn from it or copy and paste the code into your own project just visit cc. swiftui dkit it's a free download I'll leave it in the description below the video too
