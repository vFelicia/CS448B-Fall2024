hey YouTubers welcome to this video where I'm going to show you how to use sketch 3 to design the UI for an app and this video was actually released in the course uh we're building a sort of like a quiz type app and so this lesson was a course lesson uh that showed how to design the UI using sketch and so I just adapt it for YouTube and I'm going to show you guys the first part of at least designing the first two screens and yeah hope you guys can get uh a feel for sketch hey guys so in this video we're going to talk about the redesign of the objectiv C trainer app this time done with Sketch sketch three to be exact and I think in general it's a a major improvement from the old design I feel like this one is in general more pleasing to the eye and more exciting and we can definitely play with the gradients in the background which changes the whole look and feel of the screen so let's go through some of the screens and how it's changed this is the question screen specifically for a multiple choice question and as you can see here are the three choices and when you select one the two uh the two wrong answers fade away and the right one kind of slides up here's what a fillin the blank question would look like you just have a text box and uh a go button and here's what uh find the error question would look like and after you tap on the image uh the screen would dim and it would highlight where you were supposed to tap and here's what the menu would look like and this is probably where a lot of uh a lot of it differs from the old design because instead of having a separate stats screen I decided to incorporate it into the menu so there are three categories of questions easy medium and hard so I decided to incorporate this cell kind of like as a progress bar indicating how much you got right versus how much attempts you made at in that category so this kind of serves as a stats screen so we don't need a separate one the reset button is to reset the stats uh we still have the remove ads screen which you can see right beside it here it's just going to dim the whole screen and have these two buttons and then instead of an about screen which I also had in the old app I will have a button saying visit website which will bring the user to a web page on my site telling people about the app so I feel like in this way I've simplified the app a lot more uh and kind of removed a lot of sections so it doesn't feel as heavy so in this video I'm going to show you how I put together this design in sketch okay so to start sketch is kind of made for iOS design almost because if you create uh a new file from a template you have these options so I selected iOS UI Des design and it starts you off with uh this screen right here which you can kind of get rid of you don't need this stuff so what I did was I basically just deleted that I chose delete the layers uh deleted this I deleted all of this okay and I inserted an artboard from this side you can select a portrait and I called this the multiple choice screen it's my first screen I actually set the position to 0 0 you can hold down space bar and your mouse becomes a hand then you can pan around okay so the first thing I did was I I added a background to this guy and you can just select it select it right here I just gave it this light green background uh the second thing I hit R for a rectangle tool and I just drew drew a rectangle to about that and you might need to play with the sizing a little bit because if it doesn't snap into place you go into this part right here change to pos position 0 0 the width is 640 and the height you can leave it as is but this is uh where I disabled the border for the fill I went to this gradient right here and I just selected this gradient and then I selected the rectangle again and you can change the opacity either from this control or you can just simply hit one on your keyboard for 10% or two for 20% and so on I think for this one I did about um like a 50 or 60% so let's do a 60% there and then I I added the question I hit t for text and I just added a new piece of text there I Center aligned it so there's my question and what's cool is that you can actually select the element you want hold down alt and you can see you can keep holding it while you move it and you can see how to kind of move it into the middle it's a little fidgety but can even do that oh I must accidentally created another one let me delete the first one all right so that's in the middle okay then I hit R to create another rectangle and this time I wanted to do the questions area so I created another one this time for the whole thing position I always seem to have to change the position so go zero that's fine but the width is 640 you want to cover the whole thing uh I always get rid of the Border I don't need that I changed the fill I'll change it to something like that and then I was playing a lot with the opacity actually so this one I've got at a like 40% opacity uh and then I created some blocks here kind of like for a status bar okay I changed this one got rid of the Border changed this one to a a dark gray and then I highlight this and if you press command D you can actually just duplicate it and make another copy so that's what I did selected a different color for this guy and then finally I duplicated it again stretched it out and this time chose an even lighter gray uh T put some text here uh I did a bold with size smaller size something like that okay and then at this point I did a rectangle as you can see it's all very boxy kind of eyeballed it here uh for the color I chose a I chose three different shades of green I think I chose a kind of slightly Olive Type green here uh but but then what I did was for this one I made the opacity something like that then I duplicated it so that I have another one and then I made this one thinner like so and this one was at 100% so I think this one was maybe 80 wide maybe not that wide maybe 70 right and then I highlighted both of these I hit uh duplicate to move them down and I would select a different color for these guys so I think all I did was actually maybe use this dropper Tool uh and then go down a little that and then for this guy use the dropper tool select that so let's put some text on this guy so I chose light I made it pretty big that it might have been ultra light Maybe not maybe it was just light uh once again command D to duplicate it oops and the layering ordering is off so I'm just going to move this guy up there so the topmost layers are the one that's uh most visible I'm just going to play around with these colors a little bit I was playing around a lot with the opacity uh and then high like these duplicate by pressing command d okay and now I'm going to modify these colors again slightly lighter duplicate that move it down here now I've got three uh three question for selection now I'm a little bit off in this one because I have so much space left down here you know what I could do I could just select everything by holding down shift and then just slowly drag everything down like that and drag this one down a little bit now I can add some text here duplicate that duplicate it again the duplicate function is actually uh the shortcut key is actually very handy okay and then finally I created a kind of bar down here okay so width is 640 position is zero I got rid of the Border I made this a dark gray but I made it uh like a 20% opacity maybe or maybe 10% and what I did was I hit duplicate command D and I did that add some text there for skip button I'm so used to pressing V for move from Photoshop but in sketch V turns out to be the vector pen tool okay so that's how I made the multiple choice screen and to do the next screen basically all you do there's this handy command where um you can select the whole the whole kind of artboard and you go to arrange go to make grid and I if I want to duplicate one on the right I would say I want two columns and I want the margin to be 10 pixels and then it would just duplicate this right here uh so then now I can just go ahead and rename it over here right and then what I can do is for the correct answer can delete all of this delete delete because what I want the result to be move this up there and Skip would become next so that's what the result would look like for a multiple choice question okay so that was designing the first two screens of our app using sketch 3 and if you want to watch the rest of the video or more videos like this I highly
