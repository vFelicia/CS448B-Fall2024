hello welcome to lesson 14 of how to make iphone apps with no programming experience in this lesson we are going to hook up our button taps to randomize the card images in our card game before we jump into our Xcode project to do that I've got a playground open and I'm going to show you some of the tools that we're going to use here first so if you forget how to start a playground watch lesson 2 again and once you've got your playground open try to follow along okay so the first thing is how to randomize a number so it's actually really easy to generate a random number you simply use the function arc for random and there's a couple of them but we want to use this one arc for a random underscore uniform and this function accepts an integer so let's say we pass in a hundred so you can see there as soon as I complete it it shows 42 right there let's press ENTER again it refreshes and I've got 52 this time I can keep doing it and I'm gonna get a random number each time so you might be wondering where does arc for random come from and how can I just call this random function out of nowhere because it's not associated with any object so it's not an instance method and it's not associated with any class so it's not a type method so what is it well it's part of the standard libraries that are imported as part of UIKit so you'll see that if I comment out uikit there it no longer recognizes this function so in the same way that I can use print line you know to output a string arc for random is just like that and we're going to use this function to generate a random number between 1 which is our ace all the way up to 13 which is our King the thing is though if you put in 13 in here it generates a random number from zero to 12 so actually what we want to do is add one to it and this is actually going to get us random numbers from 1 to 13 so that's the first piece of the puzzle the second thing I want to show you guys is how to create a string that is based on variable so so far when we create strings we've been just opening up two quotes and typing in some text in the middle like this and that works fine but what happens if we want to combine a variable in the string well we can create a new string object by typing string and these two brackets right well that creates an empty string the cool thing about the string class is it also has a custom initializer just like the UI image class which we used in the last lesson and this custom initializer method will allow us to put in part of a string as well as dynamically specify some variables so let's take a look at how that works I'm going to erase these two brackets I'm gonna type in the opening bracket iona type in F because I know the first parameter is format and we're going to use this one right here it's going to prefill the parameters for me remember in a method call the first parameter needs to have the label and the following parameters don't so if the first parameter is a string and I'm gonna type in test ok and for the second argument it's basically the variable or a piece of text or whatever data that you want to substitute into the string so for my piece of data let's sub in hello okay well how does it know where to put in hello so my format string needs to have a wildcard character and Hello is going to be it's going to replace the wildcard character so the wildcard character looks like this it's percentage at and now you can see that this string object is test hello now if I put this wildcard character in the middle like that you can see the result is that Hello is substituted into the middle now let's expand on this I can go far some text equals balloon and then instead of this hardcoded string hello I can put some text like that and now you can see that the string object in this variable is inserted into the middle of my format string like that so maybe now you can begin to see where we're getting with this because we named all of the image assets in our Xcode project according to card one car to car three and so on and so forth right so we can actually do something like this card and then put percentage at and then this would dynamically give us card plus some number if we take this randomizing function and we put it in here we change some text to random number and then we replace that so it's gonna substitute random number to the end of this format string it's complaining right now because percentage ad is actually the wild card character for four strings so because random number is actually an int what we need is percentage I we're probably going to be using this string initializer method a lot to create dynamic strings so you can see here that the result of the two lines of code is this card six if I press ENTER now two card thirteen so this is the combination that we're going to use to randomize a number and then create a string for it that will represent one of the assets in our projects asset library so now let's go into our Xcode project and implement these two pieces of code okay so here I've got our Xcode project open where we left off last time and let's go into the view controller got swift into the play round attempt now right here we've got two lines of code changing the uiimageview image property to different images so we know card one is our ace and card eleven is our Jack so instead of hardcoding this I basically want to do what we did in the playground randomize a number create a string off of that number and substitute that into here and here and so each time we tap the play button it's going to run this method and it's going to randomize it's basically gonna change the image views to two random cards okay so let's do that so we can go VAR first random number equals arc for random uniform 13 plus 1 and this will give us a random number from 1 to 13 next we want to create a string off of that so I'm gonna save our first card string I'm just gonna label it string equals new string object using the format initializer that we just learned so I'm gonna write card percentage I I'm gonna press tab and here I'm just gonna pass in first random number which is the variable here so what I end up with is a piece of is a string a piece of text that's going to be card plus my random number and then all I need to do is instead of putting card one here I'm gonna erase that hardcoded string and put in first card string right so just like that it's going to give me a random card so I'm gonna run it to demonstrate okay so I'm gonna tap play now and our code is gonna get executed now each time we tap it it's going to randomize to a different number now we just got to do that same thing for the second card okay so now that we're beginning to write more code I want to introduce you to the practice of writing comments and documenting your code and comments are basically just these green statements right here they're not really code and they don't get executed but they're there to serve as documentation for your code both for yourself and for other people who read your code it's gonna make it a lot easier for them to understand what you're trying to do and when you revisit this code in the future believe me you won't remember right now when you're writing it you know exactly what's going on and what what you're trying to do but in the future when you read your code again after several months you'll have to relearn everything and reread everything and re understand everything unless you have some documentation or comments it makes it that much more easy so in order to start a comment all you have to do is do two slashes like that and when you do that anything you type after those two slashes is considered a comment and won't get executed so here I'm going to say randomize a number for the first image view right here construct a string with the random number in here I'm going to write set the first card image view to the asset corresponding to the randomized number another thing that commenting is good for is just temporarily commenting out a piece of code so for example if I didn't want to change my second card view in this method I could simply put two slashes like that in front of it and that would prevent this line of code from executing without having to delete the entire line because I could bring it back just by going like that and erasing the two slashes so it's a good way to temporarily disable a line of code when we get to debugging this can be a good thing to try if you're suspecting that this line of code is causing problems you can temporarily comment it out and then run your app see if the problem occurs and stuff like that so if you've got a big block of code there's another way to write a comment because doing these two slashes will just comment out that line but if you want to comment out a big block of code what you can do is do a slash star and then star slash like that and anything in between these two characters will be considered comments and won't get executed so just I'm just gonna undo that and you can see here that I'm putting a white space in between each line you know you you could do it like this there's no problem with that but it's just less readable it increases readability when you add some white space in your code okay so now I want to basically randomize another number for my second card image view so I'm going to create another variable second random number basically do the same thing randomize a number for the second image view construct a string with the random number VAR second card string and the first time you do this you probably won't be typing as fast as I am but you know by the end of the course if you keep practicing alongside using these methods and typing this code will seem like second nature to you so now I want to pass in the second random number and then here instead of this hard coded card 11 I want to pass in the second card string set the second card image view to the set corresponding to the randomized number okay gonna run it now if everything goes well I should be able to get two random cards each time I press the play button okay this is really great so we're on our way one last thing I want to mention before we go are these Xcode warnings telling us that this variable was never mutated consider changing to a let constant so we've been using var and a variable name to declare a variable and we're setting a value into that variable well with a variable we can always assign a different value into that variable and overwrite what was previously there if we change this var to a let keyword instead it's still a variable so first random number will still reference whatever value you put in there but let is a constant meaning that you won't be able to assign another value into that variable or that constant after you set the first value into it so let is good for when you want your constant to hold a value that isn't going to change which is why the name is constant but if you're gonna have a variable which you're going to constantly be changing its values then you would want to use var and this is something we're going to go through in more detail in the future and this Xcode warning right here is just an optimization that's telling you that hey I've detected that you'd never change the value in first card string other than the first time you assigned it so why not use let and that's valid when you're coding it might be a little hard to have that foresight to think whether you should use let or you use var so there's no harm in starting with var and once you finish coding up your method and you realize that you never have to change the value in that variable anymore then Xcode is gonna let you know that maybe you should use let so you can just change all of these to let like that and it's going to get rid of the Xcode warning so that's a little bonus tip now you know the difference between a variable and a constant you
