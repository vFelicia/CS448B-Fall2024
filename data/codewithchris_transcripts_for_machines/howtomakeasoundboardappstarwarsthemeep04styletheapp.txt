a coders how's it going Chris here and today we're going to do a little bit of styling for our Star Wars soundboard app and because I pretty much suck as a designer I'm gonna keep things pretty basic here so what I have is a star background like this and I just found this through Google Image Search I don't want to use any Star Wars characters in my background because I didn't want to run into any trademark or copyright issues but for my demo I'm sure it would have been okay but just be careful if you're publishing stuff so here I also have a Star Wars logo and I found this on Wikipedia Commons and I found this little note down here says that this image does not meet the threshold of originality needed for copyright protection and therefore is in public domain I don't know how correct this is but this is the logo that I plan to use in my application I also have a Star Wars font and there are actually four of them in here and I found this through this site diff'ent and it's 100% free to use so I'm going to be changing the button text to use this sort of Star Wars themed typography now if you guys complete this soundboard app and then you guys style it a different way I definitely want you to show me and if you do I'll share it with everyone else okay so let's go ahead and prepare our assets here I've got the two images downloaded you'll notice that I put at 3x because this is intended to be the largest size for the iPhone sixplus you want to make sure you have a nice healthy resolution for your images as a 3x so you can see here for this background it's huge alright so you want to make sure you have some large assets to work with and you're going to add the 3x suffix to your file name and then you're going to go over here to this app called prep oh you can download it for free from the Mac App Store and when you open it it looks like this I'm gonna go to artwork I'm just gonna drag both of these into here and then I'm gonna click export and just save it right there so that's going to create my two X versions and the One X versions right now I can close prep oh now I'm going to open up the Xcode project which we were working on we're going to go into the assets library and then we're going to highlight all of these images and then we're just going to drag it into there and it's gonna be smart enough to group them together into two image assets SW logo and SW stars so let's start off by going into the main dot storyboard and adding two image views one for the background and one for the logo so because my screen is a little small right now I'm just going to make sure I have my document outline open down to the view here and I'm gonna search for image and it's gonna show up the image view in the object library then I'm gonna click and I'm gonna drag this and move it into my document outline now I don't want to put it into the stack view I want to put it above the stack view into my view so I've right now I've accidentally replaced my view that's really bad press command said just undo that and try it again so sometimes if you have to just put it inside your stack view or below it just do that first and then you can move it so you want it right there in between the view and the stack view because you want the stack view to sit on top of the image view alright so I'm just gonna label this background so that we know and then I'm going to add some constraints to anchor to all four edges so I'm going to uncheck constrain the margins I'm just gonna go 0 it's gonna turn on all 4 constraints when you edit the values in there and you just want to make sure that the nearest neighbor click this little arrow to pull the drop down that it's relative to the view okay and then it might change the number back on you so press 0 again so check the top in the bottom make sure that the nearest neighbor is view and not the layout guide okay so when you add these 4 constraints and then you go update frames it's gonna stretch the image view to all four sides like that and if that doesn't work out for you just go under here and delete the constraints that relate to the image view and try it again so for the background I'm going to choose SW stars and as you can see instantly we see all these stars I'm gonna change it to a SPECT fill so it doesn't stretch out the background image the next thing I'm going to do is I'm gonna add another image view here and this is going to be the Star Wars logo so I'm just going to rename this quickly and I also want this to sit behind the stock view because I don't want it to block the buttons next what I'm going to do is add some constraints I want to add a constraint against the top and I want to add a constraint against the stack view right here so that's never going to overlap the stack view so make sure that the logo is selected go down here let's uncheck constrain to margins I'm going to click this arrow make sure it's against the view so 15 is alright just turn on the bottom margin and check that the nearest neighbor is the stack viewing I'm gonna also change this to 15 so now let's add two constraints we also want to horizontally Center it so let's do that and then finally we can choose the image SW logo and I'm gonna choose aspect to fit like that and it's gonna keep it nice and tidy in there so update frames okay so now let's run it so we can see the logo and the background and there we go so now let's change the font so that it looks a little more Star Wars II and the fact that I'm going to use out of these four is probably this one right here star Jedi TTF and if we look in the folder with the fonts that's this first folder right here so I probably need this one so I'm going to drag this star Jedi dot TTFN into the Xcode project but I'm gonna create a folder for group sorry for fonts first and then let's go ahead and add this into the fonts folder so I'm gonna copy items if needed so it's gonna include it in my project folder and make sure that this add two targets is checked it might not be checked by default so let's click finish by checking that it includes it in our app bundle okay so the next thing we have to do now is go into our info.plist and we have to add a key so click this plus icon and type in fonts or capital F fonts provided by application now the next step is to expand this and it should by default have an item 0 we just want to double click here in the value column and we're gonna add our font file name so make sure that you spell it exactly as the file name is with the proper capitalization and everything because it's actually pretty finicky so finicky in fact that I wrote a whole post about it on my site code with Chris comm called common mistakes with adding custom fonts to your iOS app and we've done probably steps 1 to 4 at this point okay so going back to it we're gonna press command B to build the project and usually I customize the font I change the font on labels using code but here we're gonna try to do it in the storyboard so hopefully just by adding the font to our in philippi list we can use it here when we want to customize the button text so I'm gonna select my lightsaber button and over here on the font section in the inspector I'm gonna click this icon change it to custom and under family look for star Jedi which is right here so that's great that's awesome and next I'm going to probably change the color to maybe a yellow or something like that or maybe white because the logo is yellow so you can see how my designer mind works or lack thereof so I'm gonna go with white and actually I'm just going to select blaster fire and hold down command and select the other two buttons so I'm gonna modify all three at once click the icon the font button choose custom for family go down to star Jedi and then I'm gonna change the text to white now it looks like I need to update frames because one of them is getting a little cut off I'm gonna select the stack view go down here say update frames okay still looks cutoff but I don't think it will be if we run it I think this is only because yeah see it's getting cut off here because I think this image or you know why I'm not sure why but it looks fine in our simulator so there's our styled Star Wars soundboard app don't forget that you can customize this to any sort of theme that you want and put in your own sounds now my customizations were pretty basic so if you build this demo and you theme it or you customize it for yourself let me know and if I get enough submissions I'll create a separate video showing all your creations and if I don't get enough submissions I'll still share your app on my social accounts so that everyone can see what an awesome job you did anyways thank you for watching and if you enjoyed this series please subscribe please like the video and please share them with any Star Wars fans that you know of so thank you once again and I'll see you guys tomorrow take it easy
