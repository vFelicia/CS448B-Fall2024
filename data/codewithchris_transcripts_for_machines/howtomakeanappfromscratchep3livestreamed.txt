hey hey hey guys what's up let me know first of all if you can see me and if you can hear me in the chat so go ahead and type let me know if you guys can see me and hear me it's gonna get set up make sure that there are no technical difficulties before we get started how's everyone doing nice to see some familiar faces from the Facebook community all right we'll just give a couple of moments for people to stop in why don't you let me know what time it is for you right now because right now it's 100 p.m. right in the afternoon for me after lunch what time is it for you guys all right well I'm gonna get started because I want to be respectful of your time today it's just me no Adrienne unfortunately he's at a Halloween party for his kids so that's that's okay one a.m. Lim thank you so much for joining but I will try my best to manage the chat as well as teach you guys what I have to talk about on the screen today and as you can see I have now I'm full screen right and I've done it so that I can transition to my desktop like this so when I'm doing long extended periods of talking you guys don't just see me in the little corner there all right so very quickly I'm going to do a recap of what we've done so far with the Pomodoro timer app and then we're gonna take a look at I'm gonna show you how I did the design go through a little bit about how to use sketch and how I did that and then I'm gonna go through a local notifications demo to show you how we can schedule notifications to show up for the user even if the app is off and that's something that we're definitely going to need to do because the Pomodoro timer is gonna run in the background even if the user doesn't have the app and I think all of that is probably gonna take only about half an hour and so whatever questions you guys have afterwards off topic or on topic I'd be happy to stick around and answer them for you that's kind of what we have in store but before I go into the recap I want to know what percentage of you guys well actually the best way to do this problem is probably like comment in the chat if you do not know if you haven't been following the how to make an app from scratch Pomodoro timer app thing because this is the third time that I've gone on livestream to work on this Pomodoro timer app so if you have no idea what's going on in your joining the stream for the first time welcome but please let me know so I know how much of a recap I have to do hey I'm so happy to see you guys Wow all sorts of time zones in here thank you so much for joining I am I'm super honored and super flattered that you guys are stopping by honestly okay well it seems like you guys are caught up so I won't go too much back in terms of a recap but I do want to show you what the design is so first of all in the previous livestream we did something like this just a simple wireframe to show just to show where the elements are gonna go all right and to remind you guys v1 will just be the three timers for Pomodoro Technique the work timer the short break timer and the long timer and then the timer also needs to work in the background so if the user exits the app that the timer's still running and if the timer expires when the user is out of the app we want to show a local notification and that's something that I didn't tell you guys I didn't think about before but then I realized that and I needed to figure out how I was gonna do that part of that local notifications demo though is I'm going to show you from the perspective of me doing it for the first time because I'll be completely honest with you guys and you know no matter if it's me or some other I was guru your following out there no one knows everything even though it seems like I might know what I'm doing when I'm doing a video for you there's a lot of like research and planning and the iOS SDK is so big that no one knows everything and so I think that's a very common misconception for beginners who are starting to learn they feel like these gurus know everything but the reality the honest fact is that you only need to know enough of how to use Xcode kind of Swift code how the app you know view controllers life cycle you need to have like a foundational base knowledge and the rest really is reading in implementing documentation because Apple has great documentation you're gonna be working with api's and libraries which you've never worked with before there's always new services platforms coming out but they're always they always come with documentation and so it's very important that you get used to reading documentation interpreting it trying it out and there's a lot of figuring out and so for this local notifications demo that we're gonna jump into in today's live stream I'm going to show you kind of like how I from not knowing how to do it to having to implement it in the demo so I think that will be an eyeopening experience for you if you're if you are a beginner alright cool so let's go into the design part first of all so we did this timer wireframes just to do a quick recap for those of you guys who missed the last lesson so you know what's going on there's basically a timer in the middle the start button I put near the bottom so that your thumb can reach it and then this ring it basically fills up as the timer nears the end of the timer and you can swipe left and right for the other rings because in the Pomodoro Technique there are three different timers so there's the short break one or you can swipe to the other side this is a wireframe of it running so the play button turns into like a stop and pause button and then when it reaches the end there is a restarting so I want to show you the simple design I came up with it's not like groundbreaking or anything but this is what I imagined kind of like almost like the Apple glowing ring so let me make this a little bit bigger so you guys can see so I want to show you how I created this inside sketch and even if you aren't using sketch of you're using figma I haven't touched the dhobi XD before so I'm not sure how close it is to that but I having worked with figma and sketches they're very very similar but aside from like weird buttons are how to use sketch or for use figma the actual techniques in putting this design together I think will be invaluable nonetheless so so this is the design that I came up with you can see part of the green ring and part of the blue ring here these are the other two timers so you can kind of swipe to the left or swipe to the right to get the other two timers and this background is playing right now but when we implement a couple more features like v2 I want to have some sort of animated moving background if you want like that could be maybe a paid upgrade or it could be you know you can have several options we're also going to have some quotes some inspirational or motivational quotes appear and if you didn't know what this Pomodoro app is all about we're gonna be integrating social features into it and so that's what makes this Pomodoro timer app unique from the other ones out there in the market right now and so I had to figure out like how am I gonna in like I want the interface to be nice and clean but how am I going to integrate like friends lists searching for friends social posts and all that stuff and still keep have this like clean interface for when you're running a timer and you just want to stay focused on what you're working on right and so what I came up with was actually to have this Pomodoro timing screen as something which you can slide up which reveals a bunch of tabs at the bottom so then you can go through these different tabs when you're not running your timer or even if you are running your timer check on like the settings the friends what your friends are doing and stuff like that like all of the other stuff we can use leverage a tab bar the reason why tab bars are so popular these days is because phones are getting longer well at least the Apple iPhones are getting hunger and longer so you can see this is an iPhone X or 10s and it's like very long compared to this is an iPhone 8 or same size that as an iPhone yeah this is an iPhone 8 that I started to design in and to compare this is an iPhone 10 so you can see it's much longer and so you have a lot more vertical real estate so that's why tab bars are so popular these days rather than having like a hamburger menu and having a slideout menu from the lefthand side I mean you still see those but if you only have like five tabs Mac's using a tab bar is a great option using the slideout menu you can put a lot more stuff in it so if you do have a lot more stuff you might want to consider that instead so that this is kind of like the simple design I'm going to show you guys how I put this together and I think it will be still very informative for you so I'm gonna use the wireframes here and move this up a little bit maybe I can make this window a little bit bigger for you guys there we go now the one cool thing about sketch is that you can kind of keep all of your documents inside this one sketch document you have this concept called pages so this where we have this page where we have these wireframes I can just name this page with wireframes and then I can create a new page and I couldn't call this like v1 design for example and then it's empty right now I'm gonna start a new artboard a new artboard is kind of like just a frame for your design so choosing something like this now for the background all I did was add a shape you'll have you'll have these shapes in figma as well so I created a rectangle and I use the shortcut key are you could also go insert up here and choose shape you have all these different types of shapes and usually the same thing in figma when you click on an object or an element on the right hand side you can find all of the configurable attributes and properties for it so for example for this guy actually they changed there it is so the recently I upgraded sketch to the latest version and they change the UI a little bit so all of the buttons placements which I'm used to they've kind of moved them around so if you see me fumbling a little bit that's that's kind of why so I'm gonna change this color and you can pick a solid color or pick a gradient so for example I have a couple of preset gradients but for this app I chose something like of a dark blue no I'm not actually married to this so here's the beginning color I really like the rich dark blue I like that let me just check on the chat someone using a super chat sorry oh sorry you guys oh you guys have been not looking at my screen sorry about this let me change this right now alright so it looks like I have not mastered the use of my livestream software so sorry about that you guys right now you should be seeing my screen you should be seeing sketch luckily we haven't gone too far into it yet but this is what I have so far so I apologize to you guys who are watching super super sorry about that alright alright cool cool cool so I'm super sorry about that you guys so basically what I did started with an art board okay and put a shape on it put a gradient on it and now we're going to create the design for it did you guys even see the design then here let me show you guys what I'm setting out to create I don't even know if the screen was on at this time if you guys were able to see this probably not but this is the simple design that I'm showing you how to recreate now so it's got the timer the other two timers on the left and right side it's going to slide up to create a tab bar sorry to show a tab bar with all of the different sections and that's basically it alright so the next thing we're gonna do is put a circular shape so we can go to shape oval and same thing I think into all graphics apps they do this if you hold down the shift button and you click and drag you're going to create a perfect circle but if you don't hold down shift you're going to be able to create ovals so I can create and oval like that I'll put it in the center and I'm gonna get rid of the fill and instead I'm going to use the border so for this width let's put something like 8 and it's arbitrary for me right now I'm gonna change this solid color to a gradient so for this gradient I'll show you something neat so gradients usually go from one color to another color you can also add kind of stops in between those two gradients and you can kind of change them to other colors like this but if you want to show progress like in the beginning when I was first using these graphics programs I could never understand what this angular gradient was used for but now I kind of understand it's to show progress so you know progress bar sometimes they have like a dark color to a light color or a light to a dark color for a circular progress ring like this this would be the perfect opportunity to use this sort of angular gradient so for example I can use and change like a maybe a dark pink to like a light pink so you can play around with that I'm not going to spend too much time fiddling around with this but there's that next we can insert like a piece of text so you can go here there it is so that's my default font it's way too big and I'll use the e the San Francisco font and we can customize the font if we'd like when we actually oops so put that in the middle we'll make it a little bigger you can even choose a variation so we can go light which i think is what I ended up doing or ultra light I'm gonna use display so I can go for the ultra light there and then for the icon I use a service called icons 8 which has this desktop app which gives me all these different icons for me I can use in my app it's not a free actually you can use it for free but I think there are certain limitations on the sizes that you get so for what I have right now I have I'm paying I think $99 a year for access to all of their icons at whatever size is that I'd like and I think it's totally worth it because aside from using it for apps I also use it for my thumbnails and websites and stuff like that so I can drag a play icon like that on the screen and then you can actually further customize it so I can change the color because it's an SVG so I can enlarge it a little bit or shrink it or do whatever like that so for the glow for this ring what I ended up doing was you can see here on the left hand side I have the Oval selected and I just duplicated it and I can call this layer the glow and for this one I gave it a blur effect so you can see I can blur it a lot more so it's actually like two rings one the first ring that's sitting on top is the solid ring with the the lines the rigid lines but then the ring behind it I'm setting it to like a blurry version of it so it almost gives off a glow so that's how you're going to achieve that and one thing I will mention now is that you know this is the design but when it comes to implementing this design into your Xcode project you're not going to be turning everything into graphic assets because a lot actually can be accomplished through code just programming so for example these labels right we can set we can use a UI label we can set a custom font to it as you know set the size and even gradients you can you don't need an image so you can do gradients in the code I'm for me personally I have to figure out how I'm going to be drawing the circle of progress rings but I know you can do it so I'm not going to be exporting those as images and the glows again you can do those through code so it's faster and so you want to do as much with code as you can instead of images so the next thing I'm going to do is basically group my two rings together like that and you can do groups in figma as well I'm gonna call this a I'm just going to call this a ring and I'm going to duplicate this ring and then I can drag it to the left and then I can duplicate another ring and I can drag it to the right and let me just check the messages just see nothing's going wrong oh and a kill are you making a wireframe so sorry guys with that technical difficulty in the beginning you guys might have missed it but I did create a set of wireframes for it it is in the same document there we go so this is what we did in the last livestream together so this is now kind of like the design composites off of the wireframes so for this I'll say this oval one I can just pick a different color a different glow color for this ring can do the same thing so I'm just changing the the colors on those guys and that's basically how I created this design it's gonna be very simple for this v1 version I'm just focusing on getting it launched and getting it to be a working Pomodoro timer oh yeah that's basically it using using figma will be pretty much the same thing and it's free so I would use that first personally but I already have a sketch license and I got used to using sketch before figma came out and so that's why I'm using this personally right now so let me save that and that's kind of me the basic design for the app and next up we're going to talk about the local notifications that's it let me just show you what we have done in the previous livestream let me launch this app in the last livestream I've showed you guys how to have a timer run in the background and it's not what you think it's not like you need to set some background tasks and you know have the timer actually running in the background it's actually setting an end date and when you come back into the app it's checking your current date versus the end date and we're doing some calculations to figure out how we should continue that timer or if the timer is actually done so this is what we created in the previous lesson or the previous livestream so it's just the timer like that seven and even if you leave it there you come back it's at 200 now right so we didn't program for that and it keeps going down but what I want to show you guys today is if the timer is running like this and I mean if we're in the app and it runs out we can notify the user and play a sound hey your your timer is done your Pomodoro is done so move on to your next task or start another Pomodoro or go to your break but what happens if you know the user launches it and then they leave the app and they go do something else and then the timer runs out right we still want to notify them that the the Pomodoro is up and so what we have to do instead is we have to schedule a local notification to fire it's like a push notification except it's scheduled locally by your app when when the user hits starts the timer we have to schedule that notification so that is what I set out to do and that's what I'm going to show you now I didn't know how to do it to be in with by I knew something like that existed and it could be done so I started off by typing in UI local notification because I knew that this was what the class was called never worked with it but the first result is Apple documentation and so that's great that's what you want but then I noticed that this whole class is actually deprecated which if you're not familiar with the term means that Apple retired that class and they will or may stop supporting this in future releases and this was deprecated I was 10 so that tells you how often I use this right and I didn't even know so the thing is they didn't tell me what class it was replaced with because usually when they deprecated something they roll that functionality into another class or they just changed the name or they created an entirely new class they didn't tell me right here what it was replaced with so I actually had just to go back to the Google results and I noticed that there was a stack overflow and usually that comes with some discussion so this told me this guy told me that it was now rolled into the user notifications framework and so that gave me kind of my next thing to figure out okay it's called user notifications so just grab that you go back to Google type it in and you can see some tutorials at the so that's great or if once you become familiar with reading documentation and interpreting it it's actually faster just to go into the documentation and look at the classes and Apple documentation is pretty good now because not only it usually just be a listing of like methods in that class and maybe the protocols and all that stuff but these days they actually it's pretty indepth but it's almost like a tutorial so going through this documentation and you go to topics I noticed that there is a tutorial or a little section on asking permission to use notifications and I noticed this myself when you're using apps they always pop up a little window and asks you can I can this app play notifications for you and so this piece of this piece is going to be something that we'll need but I continue to scroll down notification management remote notifications notifications requests and in here scheduling a notification locally from your app this is exactly what I want to do so I go ahead and click this and I read all of this stuff and basically what I did was just to try it things out I copied the sample code that they have right here so that's what I'm going to show you what I'm doing here right so configuring the notification content so I copied all of this right let's say and I just as a test right I just put it in the viewdidload so I want to see if this works configure local notification specify the conditions for delivery so you can either trigger it from a calendar or a time interval or a location so that's kind of cool right I don't know if you use any grocery apps with with loyalty cards but if you do like I have one called Longo's and whenever i'm close to a Longo's i'm driving by it it always gives me a notification pops up my loyalty card and tells me like oh you might be going to long goes right so here's her loyalty card so that's probably what it's doing there which is pretty cool but what we're going to do is use the calendar notification because we have a date and a time which that timer expires right and so we want to we want to trigger it based on that end date I'm just checking the chat really quickly thank thank you Marcus for letting people know that we have a Facebook on community Facebook community so you can go there and ask questions and get help on your iOS journey and lots of helpful people in there all right so the next part is we're going to configure the date now this is to configure a recurring date and I don't necessarily want to do that so this here is creating a date components class all right so I know I need a date component object because that is what gets passed into this UN calendar notification trigger so if you take if if you were following in the last stream you know that what we do is when the user starts the timer so here in this method we schedule a timer based on however minutes it is so 25 minutes and then we set an end date now this end date is just a date object so now in my head I know I need to convert this date object into a date components object so that I can pass that into this UN calendar trigger right and for repeats I would just put false because my timer is not gonna continually repeat so I copy this chunk of code and I just put here and here it starts saying like oh it doesn't know what this class is so what you have to do if you're using this is just import the user notifications framework so that it recognizes all of these classes right all right so it's complaining about date components because I actually don't have any date components right now so we're gonna have to to do change a date into into date components so we'll figure that out in a second but first we're going to continue with the next task so here it's creating a request based on a uu ID and this is going to be the identifier for that scheduled notification so that in the future if you keep track of this UID you can cancel it right you just in case you need to like modify it or cancel it or whatever this UUID string is this identifier is how you're going to get a reference to it and then you also pass in the content which is this guy right here so the meet of the actual notification and then the trigger which contains the date it's supposed to trigger at and whether or not it repeats so that all of that comes together into a notification request and then you pass that request into the user notification center and that's how that all gets scheduled so we're going to copy this chunk of code and we are going to put it down here so let's configure some of this stuff that we need so first of all back here in the trigger repeats is false because we don't want it to repeat date components let's create a variable for date component component so let's say we have an end date first so our end date let's let should we have a property so I'm gonna say end date is equal to the current date and time and we're add I'm gonna add like 10 seconds to it and then in order to come convert it to date components I had to look this up to let me see if I can remember it right now because I kind of don't remember it so let date components equal take components dot yeah I don't remember it so all you need to do is just google it date components to date or sorry it's the other way around date to date components Swift and yeah you can see that this is the post that I saw right here and by scanning the code you can see that all you need to do is this calendar the calendar class I get the current calendar and then use this date components method specify which components you want and then pass in the date that you want to convert to the date components all right so that's what we're going to do calendar dot current date components and we pass in the components that we want as a set and so we'll do a year month day hour minutes and seconds and then the date what you want to pass in is this end date okay so now we have a set of date components from our date object and let's see what this error is complaining about I'm going to force and rap it because why would this not be able to get a current date oh you know what end date is an optional we declared it up as an optional up here I forgotten so that's why we have to unwrap it down here all right so now we have our date components we're gonna pass that into the notification trigger and then we create the request off of the content and the trigger so let's change the content a little bit pomodoro app your Pomodoro is up and then we are going to just schedule it so then I tried this first and I'm gonna save you from the trouble I tried this first and it wasn't working and that's when I remembered going back here to the documentation that I needed to ask the user permission first to show them notifications and so I click this and this is what we're after we want to show this little popup to allow the user to choose yes or no request author a ssin at launch time so I just basically copied this piece of code and I put it here and then I was able to pop up that little window to let the user say allow or disallow I'm gonna move this piece of code to schedule the notification I'm going to move it to actually when the user hits start on the timer because it shouldn't actually run until here so when the user starts the timer that's when we're going to configure the notification we we don't have to set an end date because it was set up here and then we get the date component so we create the trigger we create the request and then we schedule it so let's try it if it were so here my main point is just to show you guys kind of like how to read documentation and like even for someone like me who has been working with Swift and building apps and stuff you know I don't know everything and that this is how easy it is to find out how to do something so again all you need is that kind of base foundation for Xcode and Swift and to understand how iOS works and everything else you can you can research and you can figure out there's no way you'll be able to explore all of the iOS SDK and don't feel like you need to memorize and know everything because you really don't so I'm gonna click allow' here and I'm gonna click start and I'm going to exit the app and then it will wait maybe five more seconds and we should see that notification pop up there see there it goes so that's pretty cool right let me check the chat really quickly hey Adrienne nice to see you man glad you can join how was the Halloween party Adrienne's kids are the cutest so my kids actually had a Halloween party too at school but I didn't have to go so this is how you know my point again is to show you guys how easy it is to read documentation and kind of give you a demo of that this is still demo code like this is not how the real live app is going to be but if you guys have been following on this Pomodoro timer app I'm treating this app seriously so it's not just a demo for you guys or for the channel I'm actually publishing this I'm going to create a website behind it I'm going to promote it put a marketing plan together for this app and we're gonna try to get a user base on it and try to hopefully in the future monetize it a little bit and you know I'm glad you guys are here on the ground so you can see kind of like how this all started so I have really high hopes for this app now I will be creating like the basic v1 version that you see here as a tutorial series on my channel alright so I am leveraging it as a tutorial series as well but personally I am also like I'm also personally invested in seeing this app succeed so that's kind of what I want to do oh and actually this design looks a little bit different from this one I forgot to put that sort of semitransparent circle right there but that's all I did was for the for the ring right here for the oval um instead of specifying no fill I did give it a fill so I just chose something like that whatever color it was and then I set the opacity to like semitransparent that's what I did there alright so that's all of the content I had for you guys today that's all I wanted to show you guys today I'm gonna jump into the chat now see if you guys have any questions or if you do type them in the chat right now I'm gonna answer your questions Joan for if you don't have a Mac but you have an iPad you can start learning so on the iPad Apple has a playgrounds app it's really really good oh you know what let me transition to this part yeah so that playgrounds app for iPad is really really good it teaches you how to use Xcode how do you Swift mostly though so you can start learning but eventually you will need a Mac to develop if you want to use like the official Apple tools and you want to develop natively for the iOS you will need a Mac and there are several options you could buy a used Mac even a Mac Mini will do you can use a remote service like Mac and cloud or Mac Stadium or something that allows you to remotely log into a Mac with a PC like a Windows desktop and then you can use it through that or you can you can virtualize it on your PC but we're starting to get a little technical if you're not we actually have an article on our website you can just maybe you can reach out and I can send you the link to that but gives you several options for PC users to create iOS apps Shane do you do this as a career coating Shane yeah so I started off as a software consultant building apps for other clients and I was part of a company I was basically an employee and then I discovered my passion for teaching and there was an audience a lot of you guys out there want to learn how to make apps and so I honestly found a lot more fulfilling than building apps for clients and so I think in the process of a year now this has become my fulltime job and I'm basically my income comes from you guys supporting code with Chris through the courses and through YouTube so thank you so much because I wouldn't be here without you guys let's see yeah fellow Roxy put your chat next to your working monitor so he can see both so I was thinking of of doing a dual monitor setup so I can put the chat right now I have my laptop which is I'm seeing myself livestreaming as well or you can get kind of fancy and you can have sort of frame and have your chat but as you can see you guys were watching my face when I thought you guys could see the screen so I need to figure that software out first but I think I'm gonna go dual monitor all right so Iona's asking can you connect this design and Xcode yeah you can so there is actually you can either so there are a couple of different options so the first option is you need to try to replicate as much as possible through code rather than relying on exporting image graphics and then putting it into Xcode barring that your next step is to take what elements that cannot be created programmatically and you can use images right to style your style your elements another cool thing which I showed in I think my very first lesson is figma actually if you select an element in figma it tells you the swift code to generate that element and I don't know how perfect it is because I haven't used it extensively but I just wanted to let you know that it's there and there's also something else which I talked to my coworker my ex coworkers who are still working at the consultant company and they tell me that they use something called Zeppelin now which kind of bridges the gap between the development team and the design team oh you guys can't see my screen again I'm sorry you see this live streaming thing thanks so much for bearing with me so Zeppelin this thing is supposed to bridge the gap between development teams and designer teams and I have never used it before I'm interested in taking a look at what kind of like how to use it but what my guess is that so like selecting a element gives you the code yeah it looks like it gives you the code for it and the cool thing is that you can upload your sketch designs and your figma designs straight into Zeppelin and then it looks like developers and designers can also comment on the design yeah so it's worth it's worth exploring I think so this is a another way which you can use sorry another tool to use to implement your design into Xcode but I think the main thing is to basically use use code to style your elements and then whatever else you can't style to use images Glenn v2 is actually a lot a ton of features so let me show you what that is so this basic Pomodoro app is just like v1 is just the timers right but we have all of these features that I have planned for this app to make it the app that I think is missing out there in the marketplace today and that is the ability to add friends and challenge each other motivate each other to basically complete Pomodoro's so for the productivity focused people it adds a social element to it because I think traditionally this Pomodoro Technique is a very individual thing you want yourself to be focused and complete work and stuff but I got this idea from someone else where they challenge each like there were two friends both using the Pomodoro Technique and they would share how many Pomodoro's they could finish that day and it would motivate them they've motivate each other to do more and to be more productive and to stay focused and so that I'm just translating that into an app which doesn't exist right now all of the apps out there in the marketplace their Pomodoro timers with built in maybe todo lists or like habit trackers or stuff like that but no social elements to it so that's the idea behind this whole project a v1 is just a simple barebones Pomodoro timer which most people which is even below what's out there today so I don't see why people would use my v1 versus a more fullfeatured app but I need to get it out there to motivate myself to keep going because I know that if I then too much time on a project without without getting some feedback and sending it out there and seeing some progress then I lose motivation and I'm not gonna get to all of this other cool stuff that's planned for the app so I need to get v1 out there in the App Store even if no one's gonna use it but once we get like v2 or v3 and we start getting people's feedback and we start implementing some of these features which don't exist out there right now that's when I see the app gaining some more traction so that's kind of the plan right there yeah karo so Doby XD i think is even if you don't have Creative Cloud now I don't know if you know this but Adobe XD is free actually they made it free maybe to try to get more adoption for the program so I've heard some good things about it if you searched up Adobe XD on YouTube there will be some tutorials for it I've seen that unfortunately I don't know how similar it is to sketch but if I had to guess I would say it's pretty similar yeah so Glen exactly yeah XD is free Iona so a lot of this design that you see here on the screen I think I can do through code so once I start once I get to that point where I'm implementing the design in code like for sure this this gradient background I can do through code the custom label I can do through code like these gradients I can do through semitransparency I can do through code the glow I can do through code the progress ring filling up I can do through code so like I think pretty much I can do most of it through code this button the simple shape you might even be able to do through code yeah at this point right now for this kind of like simple design I think a lot of this can be done via code once we get into like moving backgrounds and all that stuff maybe then it won't be as much any more questions guys fergan asks can we create this app using react native or any other crossplatform tool let me just change this back so my answer to you is probably yes to be honest I haven't used react native so I can't tell you definitely yes or no but this app is pretty simple I don't see why you wouldn't be able to to do that it's just a different discipline it's like a different set of tools right it's a different language yeah like I don't see why not and if your followup question is like why when I use react native to to create this and the only reason for that is because what kind of like what I've learned in the past and what got me to this point was just objectivec Swift and Xcode and stuff so that's what I know and that's what kind of like my comfort zone I guess you would say so that's why I'm building this for iOS using Xcode and Swift but if you were just getting into mobile app development I don't see why you want to explore react native first and it's something that I've wanted to look into myself it's just time is always a constraint right but that's that's my reasoning Glenn will the code be on github it will be it will be available to the public I don't know if it will be github or any other format but yes the code will be available maybe not the full feature set right because at some point if I'm going to be you know turning this trying to turn this into a viable business and trying to make some money off of it at that point doesn't make sense for me to just put the whole source code for the entire app out there right so I think I will be like I'll show you guys how to build this v1 for sure and v2 maybe with some social features and all that stuff but I have to cut it off at some point in terms of the the key code base but I will continue to share with you guys my learnings and the progress of how the app is doing in the App Store how I'm planning features kind of the setbacks that I'm going to experience with it all that stuff right I'm gonna be transparent about that Carl what assets can you import from sketch into Xcode so in sketch mainly you'll be exporting these elements so you're gonna have to see right in sketching and figma I'm not sure about Dobey XD but there's going to be some way for you to export some of these elements out as graphics or as PDF or something like that so you can see you can't see the screen sorry right here I've got the circle selected and in sketch you can choose a image format to export it in so PNG JPEG PDF or whatever and the sizes and you would basically export them and import them into the asset library of Xcode and then you'll be able to select those images when let's say you're styling an image view or a button or something like that you'll have access to those assets in the asset library the danger is to try to make everything in image asset and just do it that way it's gonna work for you but it's just not as optimized for performance as it could be so maybe as a beginner if you know you trying to get it out the door and try to get it done I wouldn't necessarily say it's a bad thing because I know for beginners from my experience teaching people the most important thing is not like how perfect your code is how you know what's the right way what's the wrong way and getting caught up with all of that it really is it's it's a mentality it's a motivation it's it's a it's it's a mental game really too because a lot so many people give up right and so I want to see as many people succeed as well so I always say there is a better way but I'm not gonna say that's the only way right so as a beginner I would put more importance on gaining more experience building more apps making more mistakes kind of you know getting those notches on your belt is more important than trying to write like the perfect code trying to design the perfect app trying to do everything the right way because you can get so caught up in that that it gets discouraging to be honest honestly as a as a beginner you're just gonna feel like wow this is so tedious this is so hard so convoluted to try to make this you know super optimized and you're not gonna have fun you have to be having fun with it if you're gonna stick with it and then when you get like really serious about it and you're gonna start applying for jobs and I don't know start building like a big apps trying to make money or whatever then you can start learning about how to optimize your code for performance and how to do things like follow best practices and stuff and it's not too late you know it's not too late it's not like golf I feel like when I was learning golf it was imperative that you kind of trained your muscles and your movements right from the beginning so you don't kind of develop these bad habits are become really hard to correct but for coding you can develop bad habits but it's not like you cannot correct it because it's not muscle memory right you just have to remember oh I should be doing it this way I shouldn't be doing it that way all right let's check out what other questions you guys have I own a so why do this with another tool if it can be implemented directly through code so that's an individual developer yeah you're free to just start like just implementing a design in Xcode but if you're following kind of like a traditional app development process and maybe this just applies because I was working with clients right you have to show them what they're gonna get before you go and work on it and so the doing the wireframes right showed them where all of the elements was going to be how how the user would interact with the screens and how many screens there were where the popups were and all of that stuff and they would basically sign off on that and say yes this looks good to us before we proceeded to this step which is styling everything in and adding color and emotion to the app showing how some of the animations might work and then they sign off on that and then then you start developing it so I guess maybe in a way it was to protect the company right but as an individual developer I feel like it's still a good idea to do this because it gives you like a roadmap for when you when you go down the development path because if you're trying to design things as you're developing it you there will be a lot of backandforth like a lot of backtracking and that can lead to a lot of code like bloat and you might leave pieces of code that you don't use anymore in your project so it's almost like having this doing it this doing these graphic comps in a graphics program gives you a roadmap to do your development aidan so thank you thank you about the compliment for the design I really wanted to make it minimal so you can focus like it's clean so it's not cluttered so you can focus on your work yes the background is gonna run in the background it's what we did in the previous livestream so you'll find out on my channel in part 2 I showed you guys how to keep a timer or how we're going to keep the time even if the user is out of the app and in this livestream I showed you guys how to notify that the timer is up even if the user is not in the app so yeah Timothy unfortunately I don't know too much about vapor but I know there are a lot of tutorials good a good tutorials out there yeah Glen so you meant v1 before yeah the v1 code it will be out there I don't know if it will be on you guys should start using github traditionally I just like zipped it up and sent it to people but what do you use for icon creation for the various sizes Glen I actually have a video on that in my channel so just go over to my channel page click on the videos and then it's maybe like four or five videos down it was pretty recent so you can check that out any more questions you guys I've got a couple more minutes left so again I want to thank you guys all for joining and helping me feel so comfortable on the live stream just hanging out with you guys so actually let me know I want to give you guys a question so in these live streams you guys are seeing me like build build stuff to show you guys code and all that stuff but I'm also thinking about having a like jam session you know how our name is code with Chris and so this live stream will basically be me like us just coding together so I'm coding my thing you can see my screen I'll have headphones on and I'll be coding we can have a chat going and you can code you can learn or code your own thing right well it's basically just the jam session a code jam session where as if we were all working like at a table and I won't really be focusing on teaching rather I'll be focusing on building stuff like maybe building demos for future tutorials or building apps that I would like to build just me or me learning through different tutorials because I'm constantly learning as well but just like hanging out chatting casual so I can do a lot more of those because I don't have to prepare anything for it so let me know if you is that's something that you would want to join and just you know you know when it's gonna be each week and it's just a time which you were gonna set aside so that you can learn some coding or do some coding and we can do it do that together let me know Glenn I missed your question what is your view on splash screens with an app so my my view I actually subscribe to the Apple view of what to do with splash screens which is or otherwise no one has launched screens and if you go into their human interface guidelines they have some guidance on what to do with launch screens and that is not to show your logo not to show like loading bars or whatever I know games are notorious for doing this sort of stuff but for in terms of apps their guidance is basically to show your home screen like a bear version of your home screen so that it gives the illusion that when people tap on your app icon your app launches really really fast because that launch screen if it looks like your home screen and then it transitions into your actual home screen with the data coming in it feels like your app was like really quick and speedy and I think when apps launch really slow people tend to not want to use them as much so that's the guidance that Apple gives and that's what I think like I agree with that alright thanks for giving me some validation on my coach ahem idea so you guys can actually be coding with Chris and I know for a lot of people they can't find time you know they want to learn how to code they want to learn Swift and Xcode but they just can't find time in their schedule to do it but for for a lot of people it's it's an issue of prioritizing it I think if if it's something that's high on your priority list to do then you're gonna make some time and prioritize it and so that's what my code Jam idea is is kind of revolving around the helping people have a time in their calendar they can set it there that during for that one hour they're gonna be sitting down with me and we're gonna be coding together I'm gonna be doing my thing you're gonna be even your thing and we can chat through chat if something you know if you is basically having some coding buddies do you think it's possible to make an app successful coding it only for Apple OS and Android I think those are the two major platforms but my point of view is that the app is the app but really what is gonna make your app successful is really the business plan and the marketing plan behind the app because I think it's pretty hard to like protect your app idea like once your app launches and it it's like one of a kind you're the first one there unique idea there's gonna be clones there's gonna be people who are who will create other versions of it so you know you you need to leverage that first mover advantage and have a solid business plan and marketing plan so that you you take that lead and turn it so so big that other competitors can't catch up with you is it difficult yeah exactly like floppy word is it difficult to write code out of your own mind or is this normal for a beginner yeah it's completely normal so if you ask me this is what the progression should be so as a beginner you should start doing so I have a I have a 28 day coding plan for beginners and I have that on my channel so you can actually follow those videos and that is the exact order of lessons of concepts taught and lessons to learn that I take all of my paying students through alright so after you get to that point you get that foundational layer I was talking about this the whole live stream after you have that base foundational knowledge you're not gonna know every single thing under the iOS SDK you're not gonna know how to do anything but no one knows how to do everything right there's the beauty of it once you have that foundational knowledge the next step is to build as many of these like demo type of apps as possible and you know there's a lot of content creators out there issuing tutorials on how to build different apps try to consume as many of it as possible because you're gonna get exposed to different architectures new new classes new how to do different features and stuff like that and you're gonna take all of that experience and when it comes time to build your own app you're coming up with something from scratch you you're gonna remember all of those demo apps that you've built and you're gonna be able to think in your head hey I did something similar to what I want to do now back then so let me pull that up take a look at it and you can you can adapt it and you can you know grow from there or stand on the shoulders of giants if you have no pool of experience to draw from it's really really hard for you to come up with something out of thin air right so just to reiterate have a plan like a lesson plan if you're starting out from scratch so that you at least get the foundation stuff in and then build as many like small demos as you can to get more to build up a pool of experience and then you can go and tackle your own app and because at that point you have this whole pool of experience to draw from all right so we're a little short on time um where can I find lessons to make a social media app phantom I would challenge you to define social media app a little bit more because a lot of people say they want to make social media apps and I have no idea what that means like you want to create the next Facebook or what but social media apps like if you're talking about a social network you want to create an app like a whole social network your own social network you need to start from the fundamental stuff and you can find that if you go on my channel page and just hit the things called like how to make how to make apps beginner series or something like that so check that out it's the war card game tutorial there's actually a couple more modules after that which is also available in my channel so go through all of that get that base foundational knowledge in and there are some free tutorials out there to implement social features for apps and at that point you'll be ready to tackle that but at this point what I would have challenge you to do is just define define what a social media app means to you very very well so you kind of know what what you set out to do the more vague your idea is the more likely it is to fail because you don't know what you don't know what you want right but if you can define exactly what you want down to like the screens and stuff like that you kind of have a plan so anyways happy Halloween guys I'm so happy to see all of you here same time next week and we'll do another livestream and at that point I think I will actually have most of this app done and I'm gonna release them as videos and so in the next live stream I talked about something else that revolves around this app and then hopefully in the middle of November or something will submit this app to the App Store view1 all right we'll do that together so thank you so much for joining guys again and have a happy Halloween and a great rest of the week see you guys later
