hey code crew what's up it's Chris here now from time to time I get some of you asking if there's some way that you can support the channel and show your appreciation by sending me a donation or joining my patreon page but unfortunately I don't have a patreon page and I'm not going to create one because you know I thought about creating a patreon page before but when I was brainstorming different types of perks that I can offer in exchange for your support nothing was compelling enough for me to actually go ahead and create that page and it wasn't until recently that I discovered the YouTube membership program which is kind of like patreon but it's actually integrated into the YouTube platform so that's kind of cool I mean it wasn't until I saw that program and saw one specific feature that made me want to create and launch this program and that was that people who are supporting the channel will be recognized in the comment sections below all of my videos as well as in the live chat of my live streams so beside your username you're going to have a badge indicating that you are supporting this channel through the membership program and that badge changes over time the longer your supporter and in addition to that you get access to custom emojis that you can use in your comments and in the chat and so I thought this was really really cool and something that you know a patreon account wouldn't be able to do so that's what this video is about is that I'm launching this YouTube membership program on the channel if you go down below beside the subscribe button you'll actually see a join button and if you click that you'll get a chance to see what the badges look like and what the custom emojis look like now the thing is at this point I have 0 members because this is just being launched so I'm limited to only providing 4 emojis now and I don't know why they do that but that's all I could put now when we get at least two members I can do 5 emojis and I only assume that as the membership grows I can add more and more now I've been working with a designer together to custom design these badges and the emojis that we're going to and we created way more than four but unfortunately to my dismay when I tried to add them I could only add four so just to let you guys know as time goes on and there are more members I will be adding more emojis into the membership and also I'd love to hear your feedback what sort of emojis and sentiments and emotions do you guys want to express in the comments and in the chat let me know and we're going to get those emojis created so why don't we jump into the screen right here my desktop and we can take a look at what we what I've been working on with the designer so here are two different versions of the badges that we thought of oh that we arrived at and I decided to go with this version here on the left I just like the way that it looked a lot more so the emojis that we have so far are these guys right here the fist represent Sun pump you might have seen some of those in my beginner videos there is code crew there is my logo there's an Xcode logo which we might do something with and there's a yeehaw now some other icons that we have been working with on actually you can see some of the iterations that we've done together there another one that we want to do is on fire now again I would love to hear what you guys think would make great emojis because that's going to really guide what we create and what sort of emojis we put into the membership now in addition to emojis there are perks that I can offer right now because this program is just launching I don't have anything else to offer aside from the badges beside your name and the custom OGIS that you can use however in the future I am thinking of adding some exclusive trainings that you would get as part of the membership and potentially it just may be a private forum or something like that or a private group where supporters of the channel can meet and make a chat with each other so all of those perks or any perks that I decide to add to the membership you will get access to as a member even if you joined today and one last thing I want to say is that don't feel pressured to join this membership program it's only if a it's something that you can afford and beat you want to show your appreciation and support the channel and see even if you can't or don't join the membership I love each and every one of you guys and I appreciate so much you guys watching the videos liking the videos commenting that in itself is a lot of support for code with Chris because we're nearing two hundred thousand subscribers and by the time this video goes out I think we might just be out of 200,000 so you know thank you guys so much for that this membership program is purely optional nothing's gonna change with the channel so I don't want you guys to worry about the introduction of this thing it's merely for people who want to support this channel and I feel like I want to recognize those people and the YouTube membership program makes that possible so thank you guys so much check out the badges and the emojis by clicking on the join button below and whether you join or not I appreciate every single one of you thank you so much I'll talk to you guys next time
