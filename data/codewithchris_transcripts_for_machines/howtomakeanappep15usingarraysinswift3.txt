hello everyone and welcome to lesson 15 of how to make iPhone apps with no programming experience in the previous lesson we randomized some numbers and appended that number to the word card in order to get card 2 card three card 4 because those are our asset names in the asset Library well we learned that the limitation of doing it that way wouldn't allow us to to use the asset names Ace Jack queen and king so in order to make a randomization that includes Ace all the way to King and all the numbers in between we're going to leverage something called arrays and this is something that you're going to use quite often when you're programming in xcode so let's get started with the playground and I'll show you what an array is and how it works I'm going to choose get started with playground here I'm going to call this the array playground make sure the platform form is IOS I'm just going to save it on my desktop here all right so an array is a class that helps you manage a collection of values this is probably best explained with an example so take for instance you have this variable a and you're assigning the string hippo into it let's say you had a couple more strings you'd have to declare a variable to reference each string so that you can use these values later on but the problem with this is that the more strings you have the more variables you have to create and keep track of well using an array is very handy for this purpose so take a look at this syntax VAR a equals and then what we're assigning into a is an array and it's dictated by the square angle brackets and inside of it we're having multiple values with a comma in between each value so in this way we can store all of those strings into one variable a now how do I access each individual value well let's jump back into our playground and let me show you all right so let's declare that sort of array there VAR a equals I've got the angle brackets here and let's put some strings in side say cat dog and bird okay so I've got three strings inside of this array now in order to access cat I would write a and then a set of angle brackets or square brackets and inside of it I would specify an integer so uh if I wanted to access cat it would actually be zero because arrays start at zero okay so the index for cat is zero dog is one and bird is two so you can see here that a0 at zero is cat Okay so likewise a at the index one is dog now the handy thing about the array class is that it's got a bunch of methods in order to help us insert things remove things and count things so that can be very useful if you wanted to determine how many items were in your array you would do a DOT and you would call this property here and would tell you uh playground is running right now so give it a chance there we go so there's three items in this array now remember that it's zerob based right so it tells you that there's three but the last item in that array is actually at index 2 okay so just remember that because I know when I was just starting to program I would very often do something like this because I thought there were three items in the array and I wanted to get the last one but you can see that this causes an error if I wanted to access the last one it would actually be the count minus one gets you the last item okay so what if I wanted to add some more items well there are several ways to do this uh the array has a method called insert where I can insert a new element so a new string at a particular index if I wanted to just put it in the middle or in between some elements there's also another one called after and you can say it's after a certain index and but most often you'll either be using insert or there's another way so let's just do an example for insert first so I'm going to do rabbit at index zero so this is going to insert rabbit at the very beginning and it's actually going to be the first item now and Cat's going to be the second item so you can see here the array looks like this now on the right hand side okay let me show you some other ways there is also a pend which is going to just tack on the element at the very end of the array uh so let's do another one let's say mouse okay and this is just going to append it at the very bottom you can't really see it there you go Mouse is right there and another short form to doing it is just saying a plus equals and then putting something in there let's say snake oops actually xcode is complaining about that uh that's right so when you're using the plus equals you actually have to be appending another array like that so if you wanted to add snake to the very end make sure you surrounded by angle brackets when you're using this sort of notation and the reason for that is because you can append multiple items so I can do something like this and put in snake end elephant and it's just going to put it at the very end there as you can see like that and the array also has some handy methods for removing things so for example I can remove an element at a certain index I can remove all of them there's remove last and first okay so that can be handy if you want to remove some items so in general if you have a sort of list of values or list of items uh using an array to store them can be really handy also let me point out that in an array you have to store items of the same type so for example we're storing all strings here so that implies that arrays have a type a data type just like a variable for instance here that stores a string remember I I told you that uh you can actually do something like this and when you declare a variable and you use this colon and then you uh write in the data type that means that this variable can only store data of type string same thing goes with the array so something like that you don't specify a as a string so if I did this it would mean that a stores a string but what I really should be doing is writing that so that data type indicates that a is going to store an array of strings now this leads into declaring an empty array so for instance if I uh want to declare an array but I don't want to put anything in it right now I can do something like this VAR b equals let's say I wanted to be a string type an array again so I can do that so that's going to declare a new string array object right but as you can see it's empty so sometimes that can be handy if you're anticipating uh to store a list of values but at that certain point in time you don't have anything to store in there yet so then you can write something like this where you can put your empty array into a variable and then when you get your items you can just use one of the insertion or append methods to add the items into the array okay now we're going to jump back into our xcode project and you can see how we're going to use arrays uh to implement the bigger range of card values you can probably already anticipate what we're going to do here uh we can declare an array that stores all of our card asset names from Ace card 2 card three all the way to King and then when we randomize a number we're just going to pass it in as an index so we can get the full range of values let's actually do that so let me close this and let me open the war card game so here are our asset values or our asset names so you can see here Ace we got card two all the way to card 10 and then you got Jack queen and king okay so what we're going to do is in view controller. Swift we're going to declare a brand new array here so let's say call it actually we're going to use let because it's not going to change remember let is a constant and once you assign something into it you can change it we don't need to assign anything into it after we declare this array so that's why we're using let let's say card names okay open up a set of square brackets and I'm just going to type in the card value starting from Ace card two card three card four card five and be careful as you're typing them out here because it's very easy to repeat a card and then you're going to get some Behavior once we implement the logic in the game that um you're going to find is is wrong because we're going to be comparing these indexes to determine which card is bigger all right so I've got Ace card 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Jack queen and king all right so let's go down here now I don't want to randomize a number from 2 to 10 because back then we were only getting these cards from 2 to 10 now I want to randomize a number from zero all the way to uh let's see how many cards we got here 10 well would be 13 right but I don't want to actually go up to the number 13 because remember even though there are 13 items in here King is at index 12 so what would be perfect if I just put 13 like that the reason I put 13 is because Arc for random uniform randomizes a number from zero to one less than the number I put here so in in this case it would be 0 to 12 which is exactly what we want let's do the same thing down here oh and you might have noticed how xcode is still giving a warning on these lines variable left number was never mutated consider changing to let constant well if you notice we have changed it to a let constant but sometimes xcode doesn't detect this change yet and you know you really have to read the warnings and errors because sometimes xcode uh doesn't know you changed it and it's going to be complaining about something that's not an issue anymore okay so down here we need to change this as well because what we're doing here is we're saying card and then we're inserting whatever number we got from here the randomizer into here so we're going to get card at this point we're going to get card Z card 1 all the way to card 12 um um which some of those assets don't exist right if we randomize zero and we have this name called card zero well we don't actually have an asset called card zero so what we're going to do instead remember how to access values in this array we write the array name card names like that then we open up a pair of square brackets and now we can pass in left number as the index like that so here left number is going to be 0 to 12 and xcode is complaining here so let's see what it says card name the error kind of went away okay um let's leave it at that but it could pose a problem so down here let's change it for right uh the Right image view as well so instead of this string here we're going to type in card names see there's the autocomplete it's a string array and open up a pair of square brackets and we're going to pass in oh there goes that error again but let's just finish this first right number I'm just going to put this in here copy and paste there we go okay so let's see what this error is about uh use of unresolved identifier card name so it means it cannot find card name to fix it did you mean card names okay so I just I made a typo here cuz our array is called card names with an S so I just need to add that s there okay and now we can press uh we can press command B in order to um just build the project and see if it runs and see if there are any errors so build failed and as you can see that tells xcode um updates xcode it now detects that it's a let statement so it's not going to have that yellow warning but it did find two new errors here okay so what have we got cannot subscript a value of type and that's a string array with an index of Type U into 32 okay so the problem here is that what we need to pass into card names is an integer as in whole number so either from zero all the way up the positive range we cannot have a negative number right you can't grab the value at netive 1 or 2 or anything like that it starts at zero so what it's saying is that left number is a type of uint 32 whereas you have to pass a data type of int inside so all we need to do is just um in our left number constant here just specify that it is indeed a type of integer just like that and this Arc for random now is going to complain because if you click that error cannot convert value of Type U and 32 to specifi type int the reason is this Arc for random uniform generates a data type of u in32 u in32 stands for unsigned integer which means that it cannot be negative because it's unsigned Arc for random uncore uniform generates a data type of u32 which stands for an unsigned integer an unsigned integer is a positive number because it's unsigned it doesn't have the negative sign that's how I think of it and even though that's what we want unfortunately it's just a different data type and the array is expecting an integer that's very simple all we need to do is convert that U in32 into an INT so what we can do is type int and then surround that with a pair of um round brackets so let me show you that with this again int do that and then we can just put this piece in here and that's going to convert what's inside into an integer okay so you can see here here that the red errors have disappeared if I press command B again it should build perfectly so there build succeeded we might not actually need this anymore we don't have to specify that uh these constants are integers because it's going to convert this U in32 into an integer and then we're assigning that into left number and because we're assigning an integer into left number it infers the type okay so even if you don't explicitly write that left number is an integer what Swift does is it takes what you assigned into it looks at that data type and deduces that left number should be storing a value of int all right so now this should be good to go so let's press command R run our project and see what we get all right let's press the deal button here so we got 10 and five but what I really want to be seeing is some ACE Jack queen king action here oh there we go we've got a queen Jack King I saw a king do we get an ace where's our Ace oh there we go I flashed very briefly here there we go there's the ace so we have the complete range of values here and today you learn a very handy collection class the array which you're going to be using quite often to store collections of values and to manipulate them in the next lesson we're going to learn about how we're going to compare the values to see who won in order to add the scores okay so thanks for watching and I'll see you guys in the next lesson bye for now
