hey code crew what's up welcome to my firebase tutorial series where we are going to build an app together that is going to leverage various parts of the firebase platform the first one being firebase authentication we're going to build a custom login UI that is going to connect to the authentication store on the firebase platform and we're going to use that to store the users and the credentials and stuff like that but it's going to be interacting with our custom built UI now the second part of it is we want to use firestore I'm going to show you how to retrieve data from fire store and then display it into a table view in your app I'm also going to show you how you can input data from your app and write that data to the remote fire storage database now if that all sounds good to you I want you to give this video a big thumbs up hit subscribe below and hit that Bell notification so you don't miss the next video in this series and one more thing before we get started I want you to drop me a comment below and let me know if you've ever used firebase before because depending on your experience level with firebase and the other people watching this series I am going to tailor the next videos coming up and go faster and slower depending on what you guys reply so please make sure drop a comment below and let me know if you've used firebase firestore or far based authentication before alright so let's get started we're gonna start by creating a brand new Xcode product here now I want you to go here create a brand new Xcode project under iOS choose single View application and I'm gonna call this a fire store demo if this is the first time ever that you're creating a new Xcode project then chances are this will be empty but you can copy what I have here instead of comm code with Kris you can put either comm dot your name or comm that your company and together with the product name it's going to form this bundle ID which is going to be important for us as your team you can leave it as none for now if you don't have a team you can always set one up for free after with the fact now for the language I want you to choose Swift and for all of this stuff just leave it unchecked or if it is checked just uncheck them all so you have what I have here now Swift UI is something that is still in beta right now and it's changing so I'm not going to use it we're still gonna stick with trusty old storyboards as much as we love it or hate it so let's go ahead and click Next and I'm going to save this in a folder on my desktop that I've created for this project called firebase Tut and the source control unchecked so let's create our project alright just like that we've got our brandnew project again take note of the bundle identifier because we're going to need that real soon so we're going to now navigate to firebase Google comm so let me actually just back out of here so I'll show you what this looks like in case you don't have an account yet you're gonna land on a web page like this I would click there should be a signin button in the upper right hand corner or something like that or sign up go ahead and log in with your Google account or sign up for a new Google account and then you will be brought to a screen that kind of looks like this except that you might not have any projects I'm gonna add a new project as should you and it sees that I'm three projects away from the project limit now there is a limit I think it's like what do I have here seven ten twelve so that's 15 projects you can request for more projects if you need to depending on the reason they will allow you or deny you I've requested it before on my other Google account and they have proved me so I don't I don't think it should be a problem a new project I'm gonna call this fire store demo and how about fire store youtube demo project idea why would it do that I mean I don't think it really matters just for your own identification purposes now for this part if you're actually creating a an app that you're going to push into production and you're gonna release it I would actually take a closer look at how they are using this data and you know decide whether you are okay with that or not for this demo I am just going to acept and create project you know because if you're going to be storing let's say really confidential information you just want to make sure that how they're going to be using your data and sharing your data is compliant with your company or different standards in your industry all right so let's click continue and we're going to continue setting up this backend now since we're creating iOS apps we're gonna click on iOS here actually before we do this I think I skipped a step let me just explain to you what we're doing here so so far we've signed up for a firebase account if you haven't already but when you click on add a new project you're basically creating a backend for your app a firebase backend and that's going to give you several things for your app one is if you see here on the left hand side an authentication user story you have database obviously for the data that you're gonna store storage which is file storage these things I haven't really used so I can't say as much but essentially by creating a firebase project you're creating a firebase backend for your specific app you're going to get a configuration file for your app which you're going to add to Xcode as you're going to soon see all right so let's click on iOS here and this is where that bundle ID comes into play so go back to your Xcode project and copy this bundle ID here paste them into there you can add a nickname for your app this is just for your own identification purposes or an app store ID if you are submitting this or after you've submitted it and created the catalog listing in the App Store but for us we're not going to do that we're just going to register the app and we're going to download this configuration P list and we're going to add it into Xcode as you can see here we simply drag it and drop it into the file navigator so let's go ahead and download that I'm just going to I'm going to put it into the same folder right here and we're gonna click Next and then we are going to add it to our Xcode so let's open that up let's open the folder and I'm going to just click and drag this under my info.plist it's gonna pop this open the two important things for you to take note of here is make sure that this is checked add two targets is this is going to add that file and include it into this specific app now destination copy items if needed I usually check this as well because this makes a copy of that P list into your project folder and it just keeps it all nice and tidy so we can finish that so let me just show you what it's done here this is where I downloaded the file but as you can see inside it's actually copied it into the project folder so I can actually delete the one that I download it because it's made a copy of it inside the project already so you just don't have files floating around everywhere alright so this part is done the next part is all of the firebase library files or the firebase SDK now this contains all of the firebase classes that is going to let us talk to the firebase backend and this is what makes using these sorts of platforms really attractive because you don't have to write a lot of code they give you all of these class and libraries for you to leverage and you can just call methods passing data and these prewritten methods will basically contain the networking code to go talk to their backend and send them the data retrieve the data that's going to let you query the data all that sort of stuff so that's what this far based SDK is all about and we need to add these files and this code into our Xcode project now there are a couple of ways to do this you can actually download the zip file and then you can manually add it to your project as just a whole bunch of files the downside of this is that from time to time firebase updates these libraries they make changes to the methods changes to the codes and you're not going to know this unless you kind of keep up to date with their changes and then you're gonna have to redownload the zip file and re import it into your project and it becomes a nightmare when you're talking about lots of code libraries if you're using a lot of different thirdparty libraries this is where cocoa pods comes in if you haven't used this before you actually have to set this up on your computer first and this is a package manager or a dependency manager which basically keeps track of which libraries need updating and then you can type in a simple command and it's going to download all of the updated versions of those libraries and update the copies in your project so it is an easy way to manage all of these thirdparty libraries and make sure that you have uptodate versions alright so if you haven't installed cocoa pods on your machine yet I have a video to show you guys how to do that just check out the video on the screen in the upper right hand corner now I guess you would have to pause this video and then go install cocoa pods following that video first and then come back to this video now if you already have it installed then we can continue on right here so I already have it installed I'm going to go on with this video so what you do is you can open up terminal on your Mac and you can navigate to that folder that your project is in so if you're not going familiar with these terminal commands LS will list all of the current files and directories in your in the path that you're at currently since my folder is in the desktop I need to navigate there and as you can see this is my route a user directory that's there's my desktop folder right there and to kind of drill into that you do CD space desktop and then now I'm you can see that the path has changed to desktop if you do LS again you can see all of the files and folders here the one I want is actually firebased Tut so CD firebase and a shortcut is actually just press tab and it's going to autocomplete that folder name for you so if I do LS I've got the project folder in there too so I'm going to drill into that and finally I'm at the folder that has my Xcode prod project file here from here from here you type pod in it so if you get an error just like the one that I experienced where it was saying that you didn't have permission and you needed to look at the license first well what you'd have to do like this one right here it tells you to agree into the Xcode iOS license requires that min privileges please run this command and then that's what I did around this command and then you have to read well you can read or not read it but you can scroll through it and then you hit agree at the end and we should be good now so that's not something that I had to do before but it might have something to do with the fact that I'm using a beta version of Xcode and maybe this is something that they will do now so let me type in pod in it and after you do that if you just go ahead and open up your folder you're going to see now you have an additional pod file inside your Xcode project so we're going to open this up in a text editor for example sublime the one that I use right here we are going to then in this file lists all of the thirdparty libraries that we're going to use with this Xcode project so as you can see from these instructions here we're going to want to add this to our pod file so I'm going to grab that and paste that in there and then I'm going to save this file make sure you hit save and then we're gonna run pod install which is going to read all of those libraries from the pod file it's going to go and fetch them and then it's going to add them into your Xcode project so this is how cocoa pods helps you manage those dependencies for your app through this pod file now many of the thirdparty libraries that you want to work with let's say for example Twitter or Facebook or maybe even the github libraries some user generated ones a lot of them will be available as a cocoa pod that you can just grab that pod URL and then put it in your pod file and then just run pod install so simple as that and then when it comes time to updating those libraries all you're gonna have to do again it's just hip hot installer pod update it's going to make sure that you have all of the appropriate versions or the latest versions and then you're good to go alright so that part is done let's click Next oh one thing if you're unfamiliar with cocoa pods let me just go back to here after you hit pod install it's going to create this X C workspace file for your app use this file for all future development on your application so what we're supposed to do here is we're gonna close the project in Xcode and then if you open up your folder you're gonna see that there's a whole bunch of new files inside the pods directory you're gonna have all these libraries the firebase libraries that we wanted to add but now instead of opening up the Xcode projects C workspace file and this will include your pods or your libraries that you added all right so that's done let's go now so we're gonna add the initialization code we're gonna choose the swift version and you can see here there are two different lines in the app delegate file you're going to import database right this is going to say that you're using those firebase libraries and then the firebase app dog configure which is going to configure your app it's going to basically take a look at your configuration file that we added remember this guy right here Google service info pls contains all of the configuration details to connect to this particular firebase backend alright so let's go into app delegate we are going to import firebase and then in here it's just in case you're not familiar did finish launching with options and that's this one right here and we're gonna want to do it above the return true statement it's a firebase app dot configure now if you know you're typing that and it doesn't autocomplete or doesn't show up or maybe you get some errors after typing this what I would try and do is just press command B to build your project to make sure that Xcode realizes you've added all of these Xcode I sorry I mean firebase libraries to your project so that's what you want to do there all right so while that's building let's go on to the next part now run your app to verify your installation so it's gonna continue checking for a while what we're going to want to do so they are build succeeded and so no errors what we're gonna want to do now is just run our project in the simulator we're gonna launch it let's click this button or press command R to launch it your simulator might take a while to boot up if you don't have it up already but after it launches your app it's going to ping the firebase servers and this should turn into a check mark and then that's our flag that we've set all of this up correctly so you know I know this setup process was a little bit tedious but after you do it a couple of times and you've got cocoapods installed already it makes working with fire base in the future a lot more simple as well as working with any other thirdparty libraries that also have cocoa pods you're gonna see a lot of debug output here I wouldn't worry about any of this you can see there's a ton on line too now the app has finished launching it's a blank screen because it's a new project but this sometimes takes a couple of minutes a couple of seconds to register because it doesn't check constantly so I don't know what that interval is but if you don't see it after a couple like a minute I would just close your app just stop it and run it again just to make sure and then continue to console so that's it now we're ready to build the login UI in the next video and then we're gonna hook it up we're going to set up the authentication store and we are going to start doing all the fun stuff now that the setup is done so thank you so much for watching if you've enjoyed this video and you want to see the next one make sure you don't miss it by making sure you're subscribed and enabling that Bell icon so that you get notified when I upload the next video so don't forget to thumbs up the video and leave a comment below letting me know if you've worked with firebase before or not and I look forward to seeing you in the next one alright bye for now
