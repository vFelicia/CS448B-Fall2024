hey guys welcome to another episode of code with Kris what I realized with our old series how to build an iPhone app is that when we got to Episode five I started jumping into code and Xcode and you guys might not have necessarily been comfortable with that so I'm going to start a new series about Xcode and how to navigate around it how to use it and you know all you could ever want to know about it for this particular episode we're going to talk about very simply where can you get Xcode and then we'll move on from there all right the easiest way to download Xcode is actually through the Mac App Store on your Mac so if you go to the App Store right here and you type in Xcode you'll be able to find it and then simply download it so let me show you how that works so I've already got it installed otherwise this would be an install button and when you click it it will just start downloading and it will install it and afterwards it will probably be right here so another way to download Xcode if you don't have the Mac App Store is through Google so just bring up your browser and search for it and on the developer side of apple developer apple comm slash xcode you'll be able to download it here for free click here view downloads this button would otherwise bring you to the App Store so click view downloads you'll have to sign in with a developer account if you have one if you don't you can register one for free so I'm just going to sign in to show you guys but alright so here it is Xcode 4.6.1 and you can download the image file alright so either either way install it from the Mac App Store or through this and when you open it you won't get this because this is a project that's open already I'm going to give you the source code in the link in the description and in the next episode we're going to go through the different parts of the interface of Xcode if you don't want to download that source code you can just create a new project and it can be a single view application and then we'll move on from there hey guys so that was the first video quick and easy from now on I'm going to start doing something at the end of my videos and that's sharing a fun fact with you guys either about Apple iOS or programming in general so I've got the first one here let me read it out to you guys did you know that in 2011 Apple sold more iOS devices 156 million of them then all the Mac's that had sold in 28 years 122 million so in one year that's a lot of devices I think I have f3 myself so do you guys have an iOS device and if so how many and if you don't why not let me know in the comment section below and I'll share the results with you guys in a future video don't forget to Like and subscribe if you haven't thanks right you you
