hey guys now that I'm my coffee I just wanted to give you guys a progress update and I was able to update magic hat where maybe about 90s % there as you can see everything looks pretty good there are some visual artifacts of thick's kind of like the glow around the letters of the animals and the the Yeti also the animation is a little messed up when he slides in but all in all pretty good so and to share my experience with updating the app because this was built in Swift to not even to a three so I had to update it from sort of two to three and then from three to four and the process from two to three was painful as expected because there were a ton of breaking changes from Swift two to three so I first tried to use the Xcode automatic updater which is supposed to comb through the project and then try to auto fix as much as many things as it can except that when I tried to do that I ran it and then it said it failed it couldn't for some reason it didn't work so what I had to do was I had to basically go through it one by one but the saving grace of it was that I told you there was a lot of generated code right in the last video you saw there was something like five hundred four hundred and sixty three errors or something almost five hundred so a lot of that you know one fix I was able to kind of do a search and replace and fix like thirty things at once but the whole process took about an hour and a half so I did you know that's searching and replacing and updated this with three and then I used Xcode nine beta and I opened the project and the update from Swift three to four was barely anything at all and that's you know that's amazing because the Swift team they promised that with Swift war they wouldn't introduce any breaking changes or they would try not to and sure enough when I was updating my out from three to four it was such an easy process so I hope for you guys out there today who are updating to have three apps to four that you find in the pros pretty easy as well but for me because this hat was Swift too it just just took a lot of time most of it was it wasn't hard it was just tedious work it was a lot a lot of manual labor because a lot of it was just some tactical changes in Swift three that was breaking my old code for example methods might accept different parameters they might be named slightly differently some properties might be accepting different data types now so I had to make those kinds of changes nothing nothing too too bad all right so what's next well we have fixed those couple of visual effect bugs that I mentioned and now we're gonna have to test the app on a whole bunch of different devices to see what comes up and fix those and then lastly we have to prepare the eye for submission like work on the app listing and stuff like that in a couple of videos before I mentioned Steve Young and AB masters well I asked them and he's gonna come on to the YouTube channel next week so he's gonna share some tips and strategies for us that we are going to implement with magic hat when we upload that out to the App Store so be on the lookout for that also next week I'm going to start really seeing some beginner lessons updated ones the ones that I have on my series now the 17 beginner lessons to build a war app those are probably my most popular videos and so I'm going to update those for Xcode 9 and Swift 4 if you've already seen them before or you are an intimate intermediate level programmer then just bear with me while I update those and put those on the channel for people who are just starting out and then I'll get back to producing more intermediate content but I will still release another vlog next week and the Steve Young episode is coming next week as well and also last thing last but not least I want to give you guys the answer is it the question I asked you last week and I want to give you a new question ok so the answer first when I saw people replying after I uploaded that video I actually instantly regret asking that question because some people actually you know I'm so happy and I'm so the fact that some of you think I'm a tiny person because the reality is unfortunately to disappoint is that I'm not tidy and so I did clean up the office for you guys and hopefully I can keep it that clean you know you can comment below and ask me if my office is clean or not from time to time and I can tell you and so that's the answer thank you to all who participated and thank you to you guys who said that I was a tidy person now the this week's question we actually went on a Costco trip and we do these like once every two months and it's always a big affair we always buy a ton of stuff but this time in particular I couldn't believe how much we spent in one single trip and it didn't look like that much in the shopping cart but when I saw the built men so I actually recorded our haul because I forgot the bags we didn't bring bags to Costco so I had to load everything in the car one by one they took everything out of the car when we got home and just put it in a pile before we put everything away I just said hey quickly I'm gonna take the video camera and I'm going to just show you guys what I took so check out this haul let me know in the comments section below how much you think that everything costs and don't forget to subscribe and like the video and click that little belt icon if you don't want to miss the next vlog or miss any videos from me alright thanks for watching I'll catch you guys next time bye
