hello it's Chris here and in this video I'm going to tell you about the money that I've made from the App Store and this is almost like a followup to my previous video on the question can you make money with apps so last week my wife and I had decided that finally enough was enough and that we would tackle our budget so I logged into my online banking and I saw this account that uh I I forgot I even had it's a US dollar account and I'm in Canada so we use Canadian dollars and so this account was for my little eBay businesses back in the day so you can see that um I opened this account forgetting that I had it and I was very surprised to see this transaction here and you can see this is the only transaction I had in June like I said I don't really use this account um so yeah June 8th incoming wire transfer from Apple $985 and I thought how the heck could that happen I didn't expect to make any money from the App Store in fact I'm paying for that Apple membership um the iOS Developer membership it's like $110 or $100 a year right so in my mind I'm giving Apple $100 every year now you know you can imagine surprised seeing that Apple's giving me some money back so I hop into my iTunes connect and I jump into payments on financial reports so I didn't see anything uh in June here there's not much to see here but I go back two months and I see that indeed they sent this payment to me uh on June 8th here and this is from April because it's delayed 2 months all these payments so this report is a little bit confusing but let me walk you through it and I hope I am allowed to show you guys this I did check out there uh terms and conditions I didn't see anything um saying that I couldn't so it actually lists how much money you've made um by these places here um you can see here that this balance column is in local currency and then there's like um how much you earned pretax total and then taxes and adjustments exchange rate blah blah blah and this last column here on the right is how much money you've made and if I scroll all the way to the bottom you're going to see that the big chunk of that $98 came from ad Revenue so that's interesting because the only place I had ads was in this app that I built way way back then and I probably didn't even mention this in the previous video but it was for Blizzard's game Hearthstone it's a card game and this was a free app it basically showcased some YouTube videos of um Trump this guy not not Donald Trump but Trump he's a Hearthstone player who's really good and this kind of um showcase some of his videos so this was the app that I put out for free and it used I add so as you know or maybe you haven't heard but I add shut down so I don't even know I don't think this app is showing a banner advertisements anymore as you can see it was released and last updated in end of July 2014 so I haven't updated this app I kind of just forgot about it so I had this app showing uh banner ads I also had magic hat which I told you guys about down here so I click on this guy and you see that this is actually a paid app this is a dollar and it's really nice to see that we have some good reviews I have to show my friend who we built who built this who he did the art for this okay so if we go back to this report um you can see of this payment all of these different countries here and then finally down here uh we have the ad Revenue so it's interesting to see um how that Abed Revenue came to be so if I jump all the way back to 2014 in July when that Hearthstone app was released it was released on the 28th right so I earned like 31 cents in the last 3 days of July and then if we scroll uh in August we earned $ 460 earned $4 now keep in mind this was just an app that I published I didn't do any advertising for it at all or anything like that and I think it was just based on the popularity of the game that people would search for it on the app store and they would download it and use it and maybe based on the popularity of trump as well um so you can see I was earning about $5 a month give or take this time this month was a good one this was $8 but you can see the balance slowly accumulating so $5 a month I thought nothing of it um I didn't even pay any attention to it I forgot about it completely and kind of fast forward until 2017 in June so that or April rather so that ad Revenue $76 combined with the sales of Magic Hat up here um that put me over the edge of a payout so you need to accumulate about $100 for them to pay out to you otherwise it just sits in an account or their account and the balance carries forward to the next next month so you can see here in May uh we sold two more units of magic hat so I earned 72 cents and. 70 cents respectively so now I have a balance of like a $150 so who knows now that I add is shut down and this app isn't really bringing in any money anymore any AD Revenue who knows how long it's going to take me to reach the next $100 to get paid out but you know what's going to be interesting is maybe we should do this on the YouTube channel um I'm going to take this app and change out the I add monetization for something that is actually running and um able to generate ad Revenue maybe like ad mob or something like that and then resubmit it and maybe we'll keep track of it as a YouTube community and see um see how much money this makes and over time maybe we can produce more apps and try to make more money from the App Store so this just goes to show you that making money on the App Store is no easy feat um granted that you know I did say that for Magic Hat we didn't try very hard to promote it so with my next app I think I will actually dedicate some effort into some app marketing and I actually have someone who is very good at it in fact he runs his own agency and he is Steve Young from atms. let me see if I can just pull that up really quickly here appmaster . Co so uh I wanted to actually show a picture of him but he runs an agency that actually helps uh companies do app promotion and app marketing for their apps so maybe I can ask him to come on to code with Chris and create a video for you guys just highlighting some of his tips he does hold a webinars free webinar sessions and he sends out free tips to his newsletter so uh do go and check them out if that's something that you're interested in if you have apps in the App Store and you'd like to increase the downloads um go check out app masters. with Steve Young ah I almost forgot Steve Young actually has a YouTube channel uh where he publishes videos pretty regularly so check out in the description below I'll link directly to his YouTube channel so that you can check out some of his tips and tricks so lastly sorry if you're disappointed to find out that it took me 3 years to make 9 $8 from the App Store don't lose hope if you're trying to make money on the App Store I have to say that I wasn't trying very hard at all and I actually do think it would be a very interesting experiment for us to uh produce some apps update that Hearthstone app with the new ad Network and just kind of Follow That and track that and see how much money we can make from the app store if you want to check out the apps that I've built they're all free well Magic hat costs money but there are light versions so let's view more by this developer I'll show you so um there is this one Hearthstone at which is free this one I think maybe the light version these two are the light version yeah so there are free versions of Magic Hat as well that you can check out for free I'll put the links in the description below thanks for watching I'll see you in the next video bye guys
