Hey CodeCrew! Last week we talked about the essential technical skills you need to get your first ios developer job in this video i want to talk about something that is arguably even more important and that is the intangible soft skills or attributes that make you who you are in my opinion these soft skills are even more important than the tech skills because the technical skills they can be learned now these soft skills that we're going to talk about if you don't work on them they may give out the wrong impression to the recruiter and it may ruin your chances of getting your first ios developer job so please pay attention all right let's dive in okay so we're going to try something a little bit different because for these soft skills i wasn't sure what to put on the screen and i didn't want you to just watch my talking head as the full screen so i've put up some uh coding footage of my selfcoding and i'm just going to tell you about these important soft skills so just pay attention to what i'm saying uh and and hopefully at least the coding part is interesting okay so first things first these soft skills are what i look for when i'm interviewing candidates these things are subjective i think for every company it could be different but in my experience and working with people this is what i value okay so the first one is arguably the most important one it's not that the other soft skills are unimportant it's just that for this particular one if it's missing i consider the interview done and that is coachability and coachability is especially important for someone coming on board as a junior or new developer to me being coachable actually means a few things number one it means that the candidate checks their ego in at the door and realizes that everyone has something to learn even the smartest guys in the room nobody knows everything and not only that everybody can be wrong at times number two it means that the candidate is receptive to criticism and feedback because without that the candidate will not be able to improve their skills right so i'm really looking for an attitude like i'm here to learn and there's a lot that i don't know and there is a lot that i can learn from from other people being coachable also means that the candidate is able to apply the feedback to their future coding so that they don't make the same mistakes over and over so obviously this one is kind of hard to gauge in an interview but however if the candidate doesn't demonstrate that they are improving by applying the feedback that they're receiving then that is sort of a red flag probably something that we should bring up in a performance review or something like that all right the next one is teamwork how well does the candidate work together with the team are they difficult to work with are they argumentative are the conversations that they have with other people constructive a very easy way to tell this is are they bringing their teammates up or are they putting them down so if someone else on the team makes a mistake are they pointing the finger at them and saying so and so did this and that's why this isn't working or that's why we couldn't make this deadline or are they pitching in even if it's not their fault and and helping to bail the team out that's being a team player you know if someone doesn't play nice with the team it can do more harm than good i don't care how smart you are or how well you can write code okay the third one you've probably heard of before and that is communication now communication is actually two types it's verbal and it's written but it's not about how eloquently you can speak or how well you can write technical documentation or emails things like that i mean that stuff will definitely help being able to convey what you're trying to say in a succinct way without being too verbose and things like that for me personally i tend to ramble on so that's not good that's something that i need to work on but communication what i'm really talking about for example if you're stuck on a problem and you're falling behind do you just sit there and be stuck and don't say anything until your team lead rolls around and asks you hey how's that feature going and you know it's the deadlines the day you're supposed to deliver it and you say well i was stuck four days ago and i couldn't figure it out and now i'm stuck and it's not done that's the worst possible thing that you can do if you over communicate you just say that you've encountered a roadblock a setback some delays some unexpected errors or issues and say that you know you're working on a fix or you're working on some sort of work around things may be delayed and you raise that early there are opportunities to get help right for example the team lead may get someone else to help you take a look at it or they may have suggestions or offer solutions but if you don't say anything about it then you're basically failing at this soft skill so that's just one example of communication another example is asking questions when you need to right there's a balance like are you asking silly questions that you can find out on your own or are you asking valid questions that uh will shed light and and actually prevent you from going down the wrong path for example right so communication is one thing that i look for as well a fourth one is resourcefulness now some people call this problem solving i like to call it resourcefulness because it's not just about solving a technical challenge for example solving some sort of algorithm challenge it's not about that resourcefulness is more important to me and that is the candidate's ability to work around issues and problems because face it no matter what level of developer you are you are always going to encounter unexpected challenges now the key is how you're going to deal with it and this sort of goes back to what we mentioned about communication for example if you hit a roadblock are you just going to sit there and be stuck or are you going to be resourceful and try to find a solution what i'm looking for is someone when they hit a roadblock to try everything that they can think of to find a solution to get past that roadblock or to solve it and if that still doesn't work then i would expect that person to do a research or to ask people you know pull on the people that you have to get some help and to get some insight on your problem and if that doesn't work then i would expect the candidate to start thinking about alternative solutions or workarounds that may not exactly be what they needed to do but you know it is also a solution right oftentimes you might get requests from people who aren't technical and you know some things cannot be done or it can be done but it may introduce um fragility right it may be a very fragile solution so maybe not the best thing to do so you have to keep in mind that there are always multiple solutions to something you just have to understand sort of the underlying intention of of that request or you know that feature so going back to it i would expect the candidate if they've exhausted all of their options that they know of they've pulled on help they've done research and still nothing to come up with a list of workarounds and alternative solutions and a list of pros and cons that they know of and then they can present it to the team lead and they can make a decision on how to go so that to me is being resourceful all right the fifth soft skill that i'm looking for is the ability to manage deadlines oftentimes you won't just have one task with one deadline you're going to be juggling multiple things with multiple deadlines now don't get me wrong this is not about trying to finish everything on time because oftentimes there just isn't enough hours in the day it's about setting expectations and communicating again communication that thing it's important to be able to prioritize your tasks right and to be able to track your deadlines so you don't drop the ball on any of them and just communicating when things will be done if things are going to be delayed things are going to be done ahead of time which is rare and especially with development and coding unexpected things always come up and that is expected right that is a known thing but it goes back to communication you need to communicate and set expectations that there's a potential delay now along with managing deadlines you also have to learn when to say no for example different departments in the company may ask you for different things and if you don't push back or you don't recognize when your plate is full already and you commit to too many things you may just end up dropping all the balls and that is bad and i know that there is a tendency for beginners to want to prove their worth and to show everyone how hard they can work but you might just end up burning yourself out and that doesn't help anyone so over time you'll learn when to recognize when your plate is full and if you take on any more things your work quality will start to deteriorate or you will start to miss deadlines so when you learn to recognize that you have to push back because it's worse to commit to something and then drop the ball than it is just to say no my plate is full i'm afraid you're gonna have to find someone else to do that and trust me people will respect you more for being able to recognize when your play is full and saying no now the soft skills we covered today combined with the technical skills that we covered in the last video should give you a fairly good idea of what's to be expected with a newly hired ios developer and so those soft skills and technical skills are the things that you can work on if you want to start applying for your first ios developer job between this video and the technical skills video do you think we missed anything if you think we did drop us a comment below and let us know also this type of video isn't the usual thing that we do we usually create technical coding tutorials so if you want to see more of this type of video definitely drop us a comment and let us know especially if you have some video ideas that you'd like us to cover alright thanks for watching i hope you enjoyed it i'll see you in the next video
