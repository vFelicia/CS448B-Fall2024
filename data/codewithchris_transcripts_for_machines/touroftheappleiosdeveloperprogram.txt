hey guys welcome to this video I'm going to do a quick introduction on the iOS developer program which Apple offers for $99 a year so what is this program well it allows you to do several things the first thing is to get access to beta software such as Xcode 6 and iOS 8 right now gives you access to some community developer forums but most importantly it gives you the ability to deploy your apps that you write on actual real devices and this is the only way to do it you have to be enrolled in this program in order to put your apps on real devices otherwise you can test then you build your apps on the simulator all you want without enrolling in this program that's fine and lastly it also allows you to submit apps into the App Store which is important to some people and but I just wanted to do a quick kind of like a tour and bring you into the program and the most important parts of it so let's go into the member center here so as you can see here you have the developer forums right you have something called iTunes Connect which is where you manage your app store listings so the general process for submitting an app into the App Store is you build a new test your app in Xcode and on the simulator or on a real device and after you've finished your app basically you go into iTunes Connect you create an app store listing for your app you fill in all of this metadata all this information like the description the title setting the price setting where it's available in what countries it's available setting the support URLs and all that stuff and then once you create that listing on the iTunes Connect side you can go back into Xcode and you can then submit your app from Xcode for approval so you submit it for approval but now Apple has all the information you submitted as well as the build that you submit with Xcode so together with all of that metadata information with the build they'll evaluate your app go through a review process and then when it's approved it gets submitted to the App Store so that's what iTunes Connect is this is equally as important so certificates identifiers in profiles so I'm going to do another video right after this one about deploying your app on actual devices and it has everything to do with this section so I'm just going to go ahead and hop into there and I am not part of the Mac or Safari program so you can't see any of that stuff but for iOS apps there are four distinct sections certificates identifiers devices and provisioning profiles so I'm not going to dive into what those are right now but the gist of it is that it's a system that identifies you as the creator of the app and make sure that the build that you put on people's phones hasn't been tampered with so that's kind of like the general purpose of why this system exists so in the next video where I show you guys how to deploy the app on the device I'm going to dive deeper into the details of how these four things work together so this is the provisioning portal and it comes as part of your $99 per year enrollment without having access to this stuff you're not going to be able to put your apps on real devices okay so I'm going to press back here and jump into iTunes Connect and you have a couple of sections here so manage your apps is what I mentioned earlier where you create your app listing and fill in the the metadata for your app you also have reporting you have sales and trends so it's kind of like a analytics dashboard for how many downloads you're getting how much money you're making off of your paid apps before you can submit paid apps though and before even if you want to do I add and monetize your apps you need to go into this section contracts tax and banking to fill to fill in your banking information your tax information and and some contracts that govern what you can and can't do with your paid apps payments and financial reporting I guess this is actually where you see your earnings where as sales and trends is more of like your actual sales and downloads of all of your apps and in manage users you can give multiple people access to your iTunes Connect dashboards so if you're a business you can add an account for access if someone else is developing your app you can give them access and also for inapp purchases this is where you can create test accounts because you don't actually want to use your real account to test your inapp purchases and make real purchases so you can create test accounts here and you can select different different iTunes stores for your test accounts one person might be a u.s. customer one person might be a Canadian customer and so on and so forth manager apps is where you actually create your app listings and you can edit your app listings as well this is a add section there's basically a bunch of documentation in there for how to integrate Ayad whether you're on the publisher side or the advertiser side catalog reports I'm not really sure what it is I've never really used it support I haven't had to use support either that's pretty pretty selfexplanatory all of this stuff so that's kind of like at a general tour of the developer program definitely worth the $99 a year if you plan to submit some apps to the store so in the following video I'll dive a little deeper into the certificates identifiers and profiles and I will show you guys and how to how to set everything up to deploy an app on a real device okay I'll talk to you guys later bye you
