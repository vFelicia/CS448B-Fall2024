so when I finally got it all finished and already I wanted to put it on github so that other people could also like use it and learn from it a few a few weeks later I found that all of a sudden my my doubt my muse were going up to a hundred thousand and I'm like where are all these beans coming from right and they're coming from this random app so I go into the app and it's my app and it and then I I tracked it a little bit more and I found out it was actually number 16 in the entertainment category in China I found it on the App Store and all over the place on these random websites without any credit for me I'm Christian and in today's episode how a threetime dub dub DC scholar winner went from playing minecraft to teaching himself how to code and then building a top charting app on his first try the only problem he didn't get any of the credit because someone had stolen his source code and submitted the app as their own hey everyone it's Chris here and today I have the pleasure of speaking with Nik Khurana and when I first met Nick I was super impressed with him because not only is he a threetime WWDC scholarship winner he's also published apps into the App Store 3 to be exact and he's also gotten interviewed by Apple and so when I learned about all of his accomplishment I just had to speak with him and did I mention that he's only in first year University I'm super impressed Nick thank you so much for coming on this chat thank you yeah definitely I spent a lot of time like making all these apps and it's cool to like share all my experiences with them yeah yeah I can really I can really see that because you put everything up on github and you know I think it's it's so awesome that you share your knowledge and share your code like that but sometimes it can also be kind of bad yeah yeah are we gonna talk about this a little later on about something that happened but first I want to ask you about dub dub DC because you just came back from it and you know I hear you were stranded at the airport yes so what happened was we were I went from San Jose to Atlanta we were here at Atlanta Airport and it was very foggy and we were just looping the the clock on the on the airplane was like five minutes left and then they just decided to take us to Memphis which is like an hour away Wow yes so what happened was the GPS tracking apparently was disabled on many airplanes um so they had they couldn't do a visual landing because of the rain here so they had a ticket to another Airport and then they were trying to get the plane fixed and they didn't give us a hotel or anything or food and I was there for 22 hours waiting for a new plane to arrive with that actually worked and had GPS so that they could land it these things you can't predict it from happening but oh yeah this was after a whole week of events right ahead dubbed of DC yep and between the timezone difference and everything yeah it's not really but I hope you had a great week right oh yeah definitely yes so yeah I've always had this question because I can imagine the experience and now I've never been to doubled up do you see myself but I can imagine if I went you know I would there would be obviously the keynote and there would be sessions and it would be like mingling and then the parties and stuff like that but how does that differ being a double DC scholar do they have do they treat you any differently are there things that are only for the scholars yes definitely and that's like a really big part of it they they give us like so much stuff extra because they want us to have a really good experience so for example the keynote on Monday and on Sunday they have what's called the scholarship kickoff where they have a special event just for scholarship winners so they do they will present for us they'll let us talk directly with engineers and with recruiters and they get a special food so for example last year they took us of the Steve Jobs theatre and they did a presentation Tim Cook came out they presented about like the Apple pencil Apple watch there their plan for renewable and recyclable energy and then after that finished they let us go and tied the Steve Jobs theater like the lobby and the engineers were out we took a group picture with Tim Cook we got to speak with all the engineers and then we were able to go the next day to the keynote and this year they took us to Discovery meadow which is like a little bit of a walk from the Convention Center and they gave us like food trucks they had all of like tons of Engineers like Siri shortcuts er kid recruiters I actually met both my recruiters who interviewed me who set up the interviews for me a few months ago for my two interviews so that was really cool and they remembered me and everything which is really nice that sounds amazing that's absolutely amazing what a great program and you've been you've been three years in a row do you see the same faces every year or are they new definitely sometimes I see people who I saw last year our interns this year and they're answering our questions at and so it's yeah it's really interesting to see yeah some people I see every year or maybe every other year yeah that's great what a great place to meet people right oh yeah definitely every every team is every Apple team is there people who you see on Twitter like posting cool projects there they're there and you could just go up to them and be like hey I saw your cool demo how did you do it and then they'll just do it and then you could take a picture with them I just seen was there who was a famous youtuber and KB HD and I could just go up to them and take a picture with them like I did last week awesome and this is only for the scholars at this point for at the kickoff yeah I just seen was there MTV she was at the keynote but a lot of people come to the kickoff that's awesome and then from that point on are the scholars just treated the same way or are there more activities for only the scholars throughout the week so throughout the week we have a special area just for us called the scholarship lounge and that's where all the scholars are we have a table with ethernet cables wearing couches we're able to talk to each other we get a special badge that's look at different color than everyone else so you're just walking and people are just like congratulations or they'll come up to you and ask you what you made and then you can explain it to them oh that's so cool what a great program because they pay for your ticket they pay for your lodging and I think the lodging is the most expensive right because yeah yeah and the lodging is very nice like the dorms where they take us to San Jose University dorms and I think they're ranked really really well for dorms in the country really nice dorms that's so cool so at the keynote you know out of all the things that they announced well what were you most excited about I think I I think I have a guess but I want you to let me know for me I think Swift UI is like amazing it's it's like a totally new area and a way to do things also specifically I've done a lot of a arkad stuff so the people of kujan is really interesting and all the new technologies they came out around there because like I don't think any other company has is like that technology with people occlusion where I can just detect where you are and the depth and then render it based on that yeah so I saw that and I myself have never really played with a arkad so I can get idea like that seems really hard to do but I mean you you've worked with a arkad a lot so you know like how difficult is it to do that sort of stuff to people occlusion and the motion capture is it like it's really amazing that they managed to do that yeah yeah I really think so because there's just so much hardware and software talking directly together I remember in 2017 when they first announced the arc if I went up to an American engineer and he helped me convert my playground from 3d into a R and I asked him how long have you guys been working on this project and he's like since I've been working here we've been working on this project he said he's been working there where I think he said like three years or four years so like that was just when it was just announced and they're working on all that other stuff behind the scenes that we don't even know about but yeah I think the really cool thing about a arc it is like if eventually we have AR glasses then you could like you don't need like physical objects like a few weeks ago I made a demo where you could just like put a Mac on the table and if you had like glasses on you would be able to use it as if it was actually there and that's like super cool Yeah Yeah what about reality because Oh reality kit I went to they demoed it to me there it makes it so easy to deal with like dealing with physics like for example in 2018 I made Jenga in augmented reality and when he was demoing it to me he literally just put a whole bunch of blocks on the screen and like remade my whole playground within like 30 minutes but physics and everything and you're able to just put on the table that's crazy yeah and I love that demo by the way your demo specifically for your 2018 submission yeah thank you it's got a lot of time on those yeah so for maybe for some of the listeners who don't know what reality kit is can you kind of explain it in a nutshell yeah so reality can't is basically like if you ever use ckit you would have a seed file and you're able to like draganddrop 3d objects and then you could render the scene reality reality kid is they use like reality Composer so that you could just drag like a like similar in a secret you could just drag the file in and it would handle all the physics for you and talking through other devices for physics which is super hard to do because you have to sync all the physics together adding animations is difficult and it'll handle all that for you yeah that's like when I saw them announced that I I thought oh it's finally possible for me to dive into this stuff because I always thought like you know I I have no 3d programming I'm not like super good at math and I always thought it was kind of beyond my reach and so I never really took a dive it into looking at it but with reality Composer it almost makes me feel like oh I can just you know drag and drop these yeah and 3d models in there and then I don't have to worry about at least not part of it yeah and it's extremely smooth to like when I was using it like I've used blender before and it's so simpler you you really don't need any experience it's the icons everything is just so simple there's not too many options but like it's extremely configurable and you can do so much with it they've been spending so much time on it and it came out like really good like the UI I was looking at it when he was demoing it to me and when I was using it and it's just so easy to use but you didn't have any of those tools for your your scholarship submissions because you've worked with Eric it for all three of your submissions and maybe you can tell us a little bit about what you submitted for the the last three years yeah so for the for the first year I used scene kit it's only seen kit and it was just it was a Rubik's Cube in space so that was all done in synced and I had these cool animations where it would it would first show up scrambled and then it would have this like explosion animation and they would go into space kind of like a planet breaking up and then they would come back scrambled and then you would have to unsalted and all those animations and everything we're done in see you kid and you could see it on github to the next year I turned it into a AR kit and 3d so in the backend structure is all team kit really they are cute is basically seeing it just instead of using a virtual camera and a virtual coordinate system you will scan the table they'll create a coordinate system for you and then I'll use your phone's actual camera as the camera and then it will place your scene on the table as if it's a scene cat scene so it's essentially the same thing except it's it's using your real camera and a real coordinate system instead of a virtual one so right yeah so I made um some cool physics animations with particle systems that's like an introduction in introduction scene and then you can place your agenda on the table you could switch between 3d and AR and then you could play Jenga and then the next year this year I'd made in a our source it's been builder so you could place a son on a table or on the floor or something and then you could walk around and where you're standing good planets and they were rolling around the Sun you could change the mass the distance and the radius and see how the planet will like speed up and slow down or how it'll get bigger or slower kind of like teaching you physics and how the planets gonna interact and you can even add moons and as many planets as you want yeah I think that would be a great tool for education for sure oh yeah does that the main reason why I made it was because in AP Physics is hard to like you get questions like if Planet X distance from the Sun increased by 2 what would happen to its velocity and you could see exactly how it could speed up or slow down depending on the changes that's so cool so you took all those equations from what you were learning in school you just built was it challenging for you to build those like reach a lunging yourself yeah definitely because I've never made like a source and cuz like that would actually be to scale like that and I never dealt with like converting an educational thing into like an actual AR scene that was accurate to cuz you want to make sure it's accurate so that and visual so you could see everything yeah like how cool would it be if in classrooms in the future right you just have that thing on your desk and you can just interact with it instead of just seeing a diagram in a book yeah exactly it's so much more it's a it's much a better learning experience yeah now since you've won like three you've been chosen three times in a row like and then this question is for the the vici 2020 Scholars but what's your thought process when you think about building your submission um well I always try to do better than the previous year because I know every year more people apply so the main thing I'd try to do is I use the latest new technologies so AR kid for example when it came out went right to AR kit something was like core mal and create a mouth because you're using new technologies by Apple so it's like really relevant they like when you use new technologies and take advantage of it so that's like the main thing it's used in technologies do something like creative eat like for example like a Rubik's Cube isn't creative right you've seen so many Rubik's cubes but like I added all these animations to it and like all these background effects and then it became creative because it's not just a rubik's cube there's like a story behind it about how like it's it's unscrambled and then it explodes and then it becomes scrambled and you have to solve it and similar with my Jenga just putting Jenga on the table I did that in like a day but then I added realistic textures like the reflections on the wood and they kind of looked really realistic and just like making Jenga but making it detailed adding like a twist to it that makes it like creative so that it has like a better effect on them because they see so many submissions they want something that's that's that's sure like a little bit of your creativity and also technical aspects with like new technologies yeah it looked really good and guys I'll include the links in the the notes so you guys can go check it out as well and how about for your latest one how did you come with that idea oh wait you told us yeah yeah it was it was through sample but when you when you set out to do it did you have a nine of how you'd accomplish it at all I I knew I had some knowledge of my previous submissions but something I had no clue about like for so for the actual planets right I've never made planets before right I didn't want to just download some planet from the internet so this is where also your creativity could show where you have this problem you don't know how to solve it so for me instead of just downloading it from the internet and making like a salt like a actual solar system what I did was I found textures in my house like for example the first planet new place is actually my shirt a tiedye shirt that I had so what I did was that I scanned in a shirt on my printer and I used that as the texture so every single planet you see is a physical object scanned in by the printer so there's a aluminum foil is one of them the Sun is actually a pillow in my room it's a blue pillow and what I did was I put it in Photoshop and I change the tint to be orange so it looks like a Sun and it kind of looks like the flames are coming out a tiedye shirt a folder of one of my notebooks and you would have no idea I like it actually looks like planets because of the because it captures the the texture yeah I actually didn't know it that you did that but that's so cool so how did you tell them are there notes that you add to a mission yeah so there's so there's a three essays two of them are optional but the first the first essay is tell us about your playground so you could write up to 500 words explaining all the creative things that you put into your playground because if I didn't explain that then they would have no idea they would have thought I just downloaded it so that's your chance like show how you solve these problems and your creativity behind it very very cool and you shared this source code for all of this stuff yeah all of it is on github now can you tell us a bit about what happened you know and it goes it goes along with how we met on Instagram yeah so um so when I first started in 2016 I wanted to make the game it's on the App Store's called the spin zone and I was having trouble when I first made it there was no examples online like for example I wanted to hook up Game Center the only thing I had was Apple documentation which is not the best sometimes I wanted like example hood so when I finally got it all finished and already I wanted to put it on github so that other people could also like use it and learn from it a few a few weeks later I found that all of a sudden my my doubt my muse were going up to a hundred thousand and where are all these beans coming from right and actually a week later App Store connect announced a new feature where you could see where all your views are coming from so all of a sudden I'm like whoa I could actually see where they're coming from and they're coming from this random app so I go into the app and it's my app and it and then I I tracked it a little bit more and I found out it was actually number 16 in the entertainment category in China Wow yes and then later on this happened again and it was also becoming popular I found it on the App Store and I I saw like there was getting a lot of ratings a lot of people were on the leaderboards it's called a Reno or something and then I I followed a little bit more I saw it had an Instagram page then I saw that it was Ken that did with it had stories connecting with you and then I saw my app my app like all over the place on these random websites without any credit for me man yeah so that must have been so hard like well be able to get them taken down yes so they were on product Tom I got that was taking down the App Store it's all gone off the App Store and it was also on it was on your Instagram page because they apparently submitted it to you making it look like that they made it but they actually didn't yeah so that was I had the app icon on the app frame behind my wall because someone had submitted it to me and it turns out that they were they had just stolen the code from Nick yeah that that sucks man and then you know you're you're putting this out there for other people to learn from right and right and it's just it's just so sad so where is it now and I see that you put it on the App Store under your name yes it's on my name and well the other people what they also did was they had it adds to it so for me I would never I don't like ads because they're really not user friendly if I were ever to like make money off an app I would do in app purchases but they put ads in the one that I told you about before who made it super high they were getting a hundred thousand downloads in I think a few weeks he was making one hundred and fifty dollars a day off of it until I got it taken down yeah so it's like really sad to see it's cut it's cool because your app is like out there and it's getting downloads but at the same time it you have no credit to it someone else is taking credit to it someone else is earning money from it so it's really sad to see so it was just a verbatim copy except with ads on it exactly yeah and the reason the reason how I found it was because they didn't change the link so when you click the right button it took you to my app instead of their app which is why I was getting so many views I see that guy probably didn't even know what he was looking at in terms of the code yeah can you tell us about the other apps that you have on the story yeah so I have one more app on the store right now it's called smiley I love it and what it does is a thank you what it does is it takes pictures automatically when you're smiling so if you have like five people you hold the phone up y'all highlight who's not smiling in red and once you tell them to smile they'll take the picture it's so convenient because I'm sure everyone has run into this problem before and also when you're trying to take a selfie it's hard for you to get the right angle and then also reach your thumb over and press the button Jack lees yeah yeah so that's one of the reasons how I came up with the idea my family would like to take like group selfies and what would happen is my mom would get everyone ready we would all be smiling she goes to take the picture and she locks the phone instead of clicking the volume button or it's hard to like reach and make sure everyone's face is in it so it like account for all of that automatically take it and another cool feature of it is if you ever use like a timed mode one time when I was hiking me and my dad were hiking and we wanted to take picture of us sitting on a tree which is across the lake right and it took us like a minute to get on the tree so with my app I just set it on the floor pointing at us we go when we climb up the tree sit on the sit on the log and there's like a minute later and then we look at the camera we smile and then it takes the picture contains a yeah scratching your own itch yeah yeah and it uses a this was I made this right after watc last year after I went to one of the vision labs I figured out how to combine vision create amount and quorum oh to make it super accurate Wow and I actually at WCI actually got some some tips from actual Apple designers on how to make the interface a little better support iPad a little bit better than your a better placement some new ideas on how to make it better like for example we were thinking of blink detection so that not only you're smiling but also you're not blinking that's that's awesome and I think because you figured this out on your own and it wasn't like an out of the box solution that there aren't many copycats that at least from what I can see yeah have you tried to look ii've looked for I've looked for other apps that do this and apparently Samsung does this I found out afterwards I've never used it on a Samsung device but from what people have told to me mine works much better than saying wow they're I haven't found one that works as good as mine or on iOS I've seen other smile apps but they don't work at all like I don't know I think that just randomly taking a picture because I'm not smiling at a stage my picture and there's a startup idea right there yeah that's awesome and I noticed that all the apps that you have you're just there's no way that purchases that doesn't cost any money and you know have you tried to make money off your apps before yeah so right now my apps definitely could make money I think smiley has taken 300 thousand pictures so far I haven't tried to make any money off of it mostly because I want to spend my time like more like learning then figuring out how to do inapp purchases kind of because I could I could figure out like here I could put like a watermark and you know you pick me and I tend to get rid of the water more it's something I would definitely want to do because I spend a lot of time on it but it's just it's not like a priority like it's not that main reason why I do it that's awesome I actually had Adrian from our team he was trying to fool it he couldn't fool it yeah you guys got to check out this out so you know how did you get to this point in terms of skill and also discovering coding and falling in love with it because it sounds to me like you have a real passion for it yeah for it just like it's just coming up with ideas wanted to do something having no clue how to do it and just figuring out as you go because when I first started smiley the model it was not accurate at all like it barely worked but I knew like it kind of worked so at first I had no clue what to do I I looked at their apples documentation for the vision framework core create a malkor ml and they have really good documentation so that's like a great place to look at and you just you could just like figure as you go you could Google I spent a lot of time googling I like it took me a week to make the data set and I had no clue about machine learning or any of it before but asking questions other people like who know about machine learning but when I went to WDC I went to the labs and I just asked them questions on how I could get into it what tools I should use I watched a lot of YouTube tutorials before I started it and then when I had the idea I knew I wanted to do it I knew what happened was popular like it was definitely possible like I can definitely do it it was just a matter of how to use create a mount for my own vision to actually do it that's awesome but going back even further like when did you first start programming so so that was when and I was about 13 and 7th grade and I would play minecraft a lot and it was very popular and it still is which they actually just presented my car we're just cool but yeah that's how I got it started because what would happen is I would go on a serve right they'd have all these cool plugins and one day someone joined and they were like go look at my plugin and it was a very simple plugin and then I'm just like hmm maybe I could do this so I made my own plugin and it got after like a ton of like YouTube tutorials a ton of thing you're not how to do it I was 13 I published my own one and it got I think it has about 160,000 downloads right now and that's why I first started just because I wanted to just know how to do it because I would play the game and I wanted to like actually know how can I make my own and I wanted to just share it and see it's really cool to see your own plugin on on a server that other people are playing with and then from there I made more I made one that was paid and I started earning money from it and then from that point when I finished it was it was 2014 Swift came out and a year later I really wanted to get into app development because there's such a big audience there I'm not just limited to a specific market and then I and then I got into iOS I learned Swift I bought I think two books and I watched some really good videos I remember you were one of the first people that start I started watching I specifically remember I think it was like a card game that's so awesome yeah I had a couple of those out there this tutorials yeah I remember the yeah the n dice rollin yeah yeah that one the felt background before yeah yeah the iOS 7 change that's awesome so it sounds like you just basically did a lot of googling and selfstudy yeah and I think yeah for me we're really helpless me is like reading books I bought an iOS book and I swept the book and also the swept some Swift's me like swept a book that they released and when I did minecraft I really didn't know minecraft plugins I didn't really know what I was doing I was just like typing stuff see if it worked watching YouTube tutorial like copy and pasting and then the cool thing is is when you do that even though you have no idea what you're doing you pick up on like patterns that are happening and then when you actually go to learn it right when you when you look at like design patterns and had to actually read documentation you look back at that and you're like you you think of you're like I want to rewrite the whole thing because you realize there's so many better ways to do it and you realize why things are in place Wow so you were able to create a whole bunch of Minecraft plugins and you had no idea what you were doing yeah yeah and then when you finally figure out what you're doing it's much easier because you've been doing it you didn't know why you were doing it but then you learn while you're doing it and you're like oh that's why that's it there's like a lot of like clicking moments where you just like oh that's why I was doing that and then it all just it's like it's hard because like it's selftaught but there's a lot of moments where it just clicks in and you're like you just realize what you're doing and then from there you could take it to other stuff in and it just makes so much more sense but that's such a good feeling right yeah just it clicks yes exactly so all the time like the bugging and figure out why something will work it all like pays off when you finally like understand what it is that's awesome so with spins on your first iOS app then yes it was my first night with that oh wow look at that it just it was a huge success from the getgo your first app yeah yeah I added a then I added like force touch and I designed the whole UI I went through like 15 different iterations of the UI until I finally decided on it and it took me a couple of months because I had no clue what I was doing then did you have any idea about game development and and the process of figuring out whether it's fun or not you know all of that um for that I mostly just I I figured it was like one of those addictive games like you just keep clicking and trying to escape the circle and then I would like give it to other people and they were like oh this is fun they would get addicted and then I would see them using it and then for actually designing it since I'm not a designer I've never designed before it was just a matter of like does this look good does this not look good how can I do this in sprite kit is it possible and it worked out it worked out really well I hate the because I've read about game development a little bit and it seems like they go through such a rigorous process just to find an idea that is fun and then they build upon that and then they you know take it to the finished product but you know you were your own guinea pig yeah yeah just keep testing it and actually the idea originally originally I saw an icon somewhere on github somewhere where it had this like a ring was like a hole in it and then I was just looking at it and then the idea just came into place like what if you're trying to escape that one then it's like in a circle you know coming twist key are you planning to make any more games um well right now I'm more focusing on more productive like productivity or utilities that are that can like make things easier for you or something that's with like AR that's useful than games because games are really cool but there's it's such a there's just so many games out there and I wanted to make something that's useful like smiley I figure if you hand someone a game they play it for a day or two maybe a week and then they get bored of it where if you make like a Productivity app they're like whenever they go to take a picture they take out smiley and there it is it's something that they keep coming back to and they like it helps them which eye is more is a very satisfactory than me to see people using it and like looking at my dashboard and seeing hundreds sometimes thousands of pictures getting taken daily awesome that's so awesome do you have any other ideas I don't want you to you suppose something that you're working on but oh yeah do you have plans for morei orchid apps yeah coming up are you working on stuff definitely especially with all the new stuff that they announce I have like a Notes app with like a whole bunch of ideas like dozens of ideas and I'm trying to go through pick the best one and more ideas coming with all the new stuff and stuff that are available and the new frameworks mmhmm so about that if you have you know I always have a ton of app ideas too but I never can figure out like I might start a bunch of them but it's hard to take it to the end like it's really really hard to complete a project at least for me do you have any trouble with that yes I I do but the main way that I get past that is by picking a topic that I really really enjoy and it just like sucks you in like for example when I made smiley at first I didn't want to I was like I was kind of hesitant to even start because there's so many roadblocks that you don't know of but then once you start and you see that the one little point where it actually works like the first model it didn't work but it had a label that would kind of tell if you're smiling or not like perfect conditions and then from there like it sucks you and you're like well what if I could make this better and then I make it better and then it works it actually works and then the UI I'm like how can I make the UI good and then the first one looks bad but then I get a little hint of like this is actually really cool and then I make the UI super nice like I was spending like I would wake up at like 800 and go to bed at like 200 at some points like just working on the app trying to make it super perfect because like I was super interested in it and and I just want to show people but I didn't show them until it was done and I wanted to like thinking of that it that it's gonna be on the App Store and you're finally able to show it kind of motivates you to work and make it perfect so that when it's on the store and you go send it to somebody you're like really proud of it and it motivates you to make it really good and to keep keep going even though at some point so there are some crazy bugs or they got rejected from the app store twice but still it motivates you to keep going and eventually share it with everybody and then to see it on the stores is a really good feeling afterwards that's such a good way to approach it because for me it's it's always thinking about how viable is this idea in terms of you know K does it have legs to to gain an audience and to you know be monetized and stuff like that but if it doesn't align with your passion and what you're interested in and it's really hard to do it for that reason yeah exactly and especially if it's something you will use like my family uses this app my my app like whenever we take a picture cuz and it motivates you because you know it's actually going to be used even if it's not used by everybody and it they grab super attention you're making it so that if you like it I'm sure a bunch of people will like it and have the same problem that needs to get solved yeah yeah that's that's that's gonna be the way that I approach it from now on so so you're in school right now first year yes I just finished my first year Oh awesome Congrats on that thank you so you also had interviews with Apple for is it like a four parttime job for a fulltime job what was that about it was for the intern it was for an internship in the summer okay so I had a few weeks ago in February I had an interview requests from the apke team so I got an email from a recruiter asking for my availability so that they could schedule an interview for me and then the next day I got another interview request from the SPG team which is the special product group which is working all the special projects at Apple like for example before the Apple watch was announced they were the ones who were all of the like design for it and getting the first prototype out and seeing is this a good product they're probably working on a whole bunch of secret stuff right now that was about yeah that sounds like a cool team to be on definitely so how was that interview process like yeah so what happens is the recruiter reaches out to you they ask you know are you interested and of course Apple and then they ask for your availability a day later day or two later another person messages you confirming the timeslot you message back you confirm with them and then you will talk with an actual engineer on the team so sometimes the technical interview where they'll actually take you to a website and you have and they give you a programming question and you actually have to solve it you can use any language that you want even I remember one of them they asked I they said I can do pseudocode they just wanted to make sure that you know you know you the fun different the fundamentals and you could figure out a problem they don't care about like do you know how to write Swick you can use any language as long as you can tackle a problem and solve it something and then those are technical interviews and then there's another type of technical interviews where they just ask like general questions like about your experience and they usually tie it to what they're working on like if they ask you a question about like ask you a question about someone like you I like how would you design a UI or like what what kind of design patterns do you know like do you know what and VC is questions like that those are less stressful because you know they're not giving you an actual question then you have to take that in front of them and like explain your thinking and then those are the two types of interviews I think mine were I had to for each team so four in total and one was technical where I was solving the problem and another was just to talk with another member on the team to make sure you know you're a good fit your your skillset aligns with their skill set and a really important thing is every team is different for the apke team they asked me totally different questions than the SBG team because every every team is different so they they normally asked like data structure questions but some teams don't even ask that some teams just they just talk with you for a little bit and then they see if you're a good fit and then you would get an email with an offer to actually an internship so they're both for an internship for summer 2019 which is this summer that's so awesome because I didn't know that they just reach out to people for internships I thought wow is Nick going to quit school and go fulltime but yeah I know what are your career goals for after school did you have you thought about that yeah definitely so I think right now right I want to the cool thing right now is I could just try a whole bunch cuz I have like another three years to decide exactly but the cool thing is I have my summers open so that I can internships right right so I internship at a startup to see like what what is what is it like working on a startup like a very very very small startup then this year I'm working at a bigger company and then next year I could work at an even bigger company and see like do I want to work at a small company do I want to work at a big company or if I have a really good app idea I just don't have to work at a company at all and I could work on my own stuff so right now I'm more testing to see what kind of like culture I like you I have I have a few more spaces open for internships so that I could even like pick between different companies if I get an interview I get an internship at Google and then when an apple you know I could really see what the atmosphere is liking and then when I graduate try and get a fulltime position or even just make my own company with my own app if I have an idea then yeah it certainly looks like you have no shortage of app ideas yeah and and I really this is I'm doing this not because I want to work at Apple or something it's more because I want to I want to like see fully all the choices available I don't want to be super now and be like oh I want to make a company because what if I go to a company I really like it or if I don't have an app idea and even though I want to make a company I don't want to force in half idea just to make a company because then I'm not really doing something that I want to do I'm just doing it so I could have a company or just work in a company because I want to work at that company I like to have like I want to try a whole bunch of stuff and see which which one I like the best now is there anything at school that helps you with these internships are you looking for these yourself so my college I go to Georgia Tech and what they do is they a lot of companies visit us we're able to talk directly with recruiters so for example uber will visit Amazon Facebook Google they all come here you could talk directly with the recruiters and there's special sessions throughout the year where it's like taught to eat your Google interview and they they give you Google Google interview questions that were in the past they give you mock interviews the career fair there's a career fair that comes here or there's tons of companies and you can just go up to a company and learn more about them see if they have any internships available oh that's such a cool process yeah that's so good in anything yeah now beyond apps do you have any other I guess passions you want to pursue um that try out mmm it's all really into apps I think drone flying that seems super fun haha yeah my few my friends have a few drones and that's really cool to do that's cool I've never flown one myself yeah and you feel like you design you can design your own the one you build it you order the parts it's like yeah you're building your own thing and then you get to see it fly wow that's cool and you know outfit them however you want yeah so you know last last thing I want to ask you is any advice you can give to other young students who are trying to pursue either computer science or software engineer and they're not sure it's for them I would definitely like if you're even if you don't know how to do something like try not to be very doubtful and just do it because you know if it doesn't work it doesn't work but being like oh it's not going to work that just like put you in a block and you'll never be able to actually try like when I first started with plugins if I was like oh I can't do that a lot of people like friends of mines are like wow you can make ax I would never know how to do that and automatically they're failing because they're saying they can't but if you if you are motivated and you like research and you're interested in it it'll definitely just come to you and you will just want to like learn how to do it and then like just Google YouTube books try to figure out your best way of learning mine was books so I just went through and got a whole bunch of like Swift books or Java books design pattern books and then find your best way of learning and then just focus on doing that way that's such good good advice because your mindset has so much to do with you know what you can and can't do yeah yeah because it's a lot of a mindset if you go into a project or if I when I wanted smiley if all that's just like detecting smile I need to be a machine learning like professional but you don't if you just Google like you have Google if you just cool and you don't like try and doubt everything and actually try that's like the first step and then if it works then it like it pulls you in and then you want to care more stuff yeah and you know ironically this is the trap that I just demonstrated in this chat because I was telling you before about a art kit right and about three models and like I don't know how to do that but see so I didn't either I had no clue how to do it when I started my first when I do my first playground in it I no clue how to do it and then just if you just google and read Apple documentation find a book or a video or whatever the best way to do it is then you're just you're like I don't know how to do that and then you go read a tutorial you place a block on the table and it's very simple but then it pulls you in because you're like whoa I just put a block on the table and then you can put more blocks in that animation and then you come up with an idea and then you can make it do something and then it just keeps on adding so just to wrap it up any last words that you want to mention where people can find out but more about you or where they can connect with you yeah I have a I have Twitter Instagram those are both at Nicholas karana with two ways so and I CH Ola s GRA and a a my direct messages are open so like anyone people you message me all the time like asking for your eyes I always respond always so it's also that's a great way to uh to get to me awesome well thank you so much Nick for coming on this chat yeah thank you I learned a ton about AR kit it's super inspiring to hear about your story and your attitude you know that you take towards these things and you know my takeaway from this is that you know I I need to adopt some of that attitude of yours yeah and really the sky's the limit and with the resources are available now I don't think anybody should say that they can't do something yeah and it all started like in that position watching your videos like the same exact resources everyone else has it's just a matter of using them I remember I was watching my first video DC right and they're they're like congratulations to her scholarship winners and I'm like I to be a scholarship winner and go to go there and then I I figured out how to do it I and then I just did it so you were at WWDC before you were a scholar oh when I was watching on the live screen live livestream at my house yeah that's an amazing story okay well thank you so much again and you guys you know where to find Nick hope to chat with you again I'll talk to you next time thank you that's
