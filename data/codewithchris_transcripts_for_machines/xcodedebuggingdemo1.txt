hey guys what's up it's Chris here and in today's video I wanted to show you a video I recorded for a student in my course uh where I helped him troubleshoot his xcode project because he had a crash I want to show you this for two reasons um in case you are a beginner uh watching my channel uh the mistakes that he made in this project are very common for beginners so I think that will help you if you're just starting to build apps yourself and second of all um it illustrates the thought process I go through when I encounter a crash in the in the app and kind of what steps I take to try and find out what's wrong so that will be very helpful if you're just starting to get the hang of debugging before I show you that video though there's two things I want to mention first are these learn Swift challenges uh I think there were it was a couple of videos ago when I introduced them so if you haven't tried them yet please do so because it's going to really reveal what you don't understand and what you forgot frankly so try out these challenges even if you cannot complete them because it will tell you what you don't know and um I will be posting solutions for them very shortly this week and second of all if you have completed them please be sure to come on this page and click to tweet let me know and I will add your name here there's still a couple of names I haven't added yet but I'll do so soon and the second thing is that um I have been busy um grabbing all of the success stories and putting them on one page here and there are more but I've I need to take a break from doing this so this is not all of them but anyways I feel like this is useful because you can you can click on an icon and then you can go to that story where it illustrates um there's a little tiny interview with the developer and it tells you what their Lessons Learned were and kind of what their struggles were and if you're building your app for the first time um this may be helpful for you as well all of these people who built and published these apps were beginners to the iOS platform who had built apps before now if you've followed my videos or you've learned from my videos or my articles and you've built an app I'd love to hear about it please uh send me a message can be an email and let's get your app featured on this page as well okay so with those two things out of the way let's get down to the debugging video I hope you guys enjoy it hey Jacob it's Chris here I thought it'd be easier to show you what was going on with your project um in a video so I'm just going to build your project here and I took a look at the error message beforehand um it does say build succeed now but uh let me run the project and in running the project you get a crash right this itself doesn't tell you very much so usually what um what will give you an indication of what the error is is if you go down in this console area this debug console area and you scroll all the way to the top because what happens is the error happens and then there's some it gives you what the error message is here like a friendly one and then it dumps out all of this what's called a stack trace and um it has all of these memory addresses and kind of like low stuff which um is kind of not that useful you know and so you scroll to the top and you learn to recognize what the errors are so for this specific one here um the set value for undefined key this class is not key value coding compliant for the key fourth stack View and I can see the typo here and this error is probably the most common error that you'll find um among people who just starting to learn um so this happens a lot for the students in the courses and it's actually a very easy fix so what the problem is um it's when you connect something from your storyboard to your from the storyboard to the code file to the view controller I mean and let's say you make a typo like you did here right so you probably deleted that property so I'm just trying to open things up here so um just to give you an example so you might have done something like this where you're looking at the fourth stack view here um you hold down control and then you know you drag a line over here on your uh view controller you let go and then you start typing in your outlet and then you you know type something you click connect and then you realize that oh no I made a typo so then what you do is you delete this outlet that was the typo and then you try and connect it again um and this time you type it incorrectly well the problem is is when you delete that typo IB Outlet um the connection from the element to that typo still exists so that's why it crashes because it's looking for you know fourth stack view with an H instead of a k and it can't find it cuz you you know obviously you've corrected it here and this is your you know final Outlet so if I go ahead go into this document outline right here and I rightclick on this stack view I'm actually going to see that this element is connected not only to this fourth stack view Outlet it's also going to be connected to this typo outlet that no longer exists and it's also going to be connected to the one that I just made up and deleted so all we have to do is right click that element you can see here it's connected to um fourth stack view this is the correct one this is the type of one and this is that random jumble of letters that I typed see it's connected to all three so when you run your app it's going to look for these connections which don't exist cuz we deleted those Outlets here so all you have to do is click this X on the one that doesn't exist anymore and leave the one that does exist right and after that running your project will be fine so that error that specific error is one that you're going to learn to recognize and the next time you see that message um you're going to you're going to recognize what it is okay so there's another crash one that I I haven't seen yet because I didn't actually let's see here uh constraint items must be an instance of UI view or UI layout guide so constraint items okay so this tells me that we are trying to create an NS layout constraint object and when we're trying to relate two items together into a constraint they must both be you know um a child eventually of uiv like they must be things that are shown in the storyboard so let's go ahead and try to find out where this is because it highlights this line again which isn't very useful so let's go into our code and we're going to double check everywhere where we uh create NS layout constraints so one very useful tip here I'm going to just copy NS layout constraint I'm going to hold down uh command shift and press F and I'm going to paste that there and what this is going to do it's going to search our entire project that's all the files in the project for NS layout constraint so you know I got this list here and I can just check every one of them so let's go and card first so here we are relating the card image view height is equal to nil not an attrib but that's fine image view we're setting the width okay that's fine top constraint the image view related to self so self is a type of a card it's a UI view that's fine they're both views right image view self that's fine okay so it must be these last two ones then let's see here nil not an attribute and it's layout card oh this this is the one that's wrong here you see height constraint you're relating card index but card index is this guy right here it's just an INT right so I think you actually meant to write card in there not card index so you can see how just scrolling up here and just reading this message gives you some indication of what's wrong and the more you see these and the more you you know find out the problem that was causing this message uh the more you're going to begin to recognize what these error messages tell you and the next time you see this one you kind of immediately have an idea of what to look for in your project okay so now let's run it again hopefully this is yeah build succeeded but let's hope it runs okay so I mean it it doesn't look like what it's supposed to I wonder why it's yeah there we go I guess we just didn't set it to landscape for this project yet but you get your cards and you get scrolling and I guess you haven't set the background yet but yeah now your project runs and I think that was a good exercise and I hope you learn something new so thanks for learning with me and I hope this helps bye for now
