if you're 100 a figma beginner and want to learn how to design an app in figma then this video is for you hey code chris jason here and welcome back to the channel if you've been here for quite some time then you've probably encountered several app design tutorials from us most especially the figma tutorial that was released two years ago in 2020 now this video is going to be an updated version of that tutorial because it's been two years and figma's evolved and has made a lot of changes to the software which would make it very attractive for you if you want to learn more about designing user interfaces and figma so in this video we'll take a tour around the figma user interface learn the different features or tools that can help you create an app design and in the end we'll design one screen using the tools that i'll be discussing later on so without further ado let's move on to the video so first of all why figma there's already a lot of design and prototyping tools out there but why figma well first of all it's free so right here i'm in the pricing page of the figma website and they have like three plans for p for everyone they have the starter the professional and organization plan so they offer a lot of features but even if you're a free user you can already have three figma files unlimited personal files unlimited collaborators plugins and templates like access to plugins and templates and also you'll be able to access their mobile app which you can use to like view and test your designs second is that it's browserbased so there's no need to download their app so they have an app that you can download like a desktop client that you can download but there's no need to use it because the browser version is already good enough in itself third is the wide variety of plugins that can help you design more efficiently so plugins vary from being able to help you organize your files plugins that help you come up with icons plugins that help you come up with images and so on so these things you don't have to start from scratch knowing that there are already available plugins that can help you achieve these things so fourth is the collaboration features that may be useful if you want to ask for feedback with your design so figma primarily is a collaboration tool so right here you can see their selling point is that nothing great is made alone so it emphasizes on the collaboration features that they have that some tools out there don't necessarily have so figma right here is like you can think of figma as like a google docs for design uh you can see right here um this is a sample interface of figma as you can see right here there are two users in this figma file and they are collaborating simultaneously on one figma file or design file so that's why we really recommend figma if you want to like um use it with your friends or coworkers and all those things so as for us we've been using figma here at code with chris for years and we absolutely love how it works such as the file organization and collaboration features as for me i've only been using figma for the past two years and before that i was using adobe xd and envision studio and i don't think i'll ever look back with the experience that i now have with figma and because i've only been using this app for two years i think you can think of me as a relatively beginner user so i can show you your way around figma with a beginner's perspective now to access figma all you need to do is to go to figma.com and sign up for an account right here you can sign up by email so it's really an easy experience from here once you have an account you'll be automatically redirected to the figma dashboard and from there you can create a design file and voila welcome to your canvas so voila here we are at our dashboard so here we're going to rename this file as figma practice so from here we're going to take a tour around the figma user interface as you can see right here and i'm not going to dive into the details about each tool so i'll just give you a brief overview and after that we're going to like redesign an app and as we do that we'll dive into like the common tools tips and techniques that are used in the design so as you can see right here so so in here in the top um section is like your menu bar so here we have the figma button so this is our like um figma related actions so you can see file edit view object these are all like figma related options or settings so you don't really have to worry about most of them most of the time except for like the plugins in which case um you may may use often than not so as you can see right here i have lots of plugins that help me with my design so preferences um basically i don't think you also need to worry about these things except if you want to like change the theme of your figma ui so if you want a dark interface or a light interface something like that but let's keep it in the default just for this video so light and then get desktop up and help an account so these are all selfexplanatory but again as i mentioned you really don't need to worry about most of them most of the time all right so next one is the move and scale tool so the move is basically your way of moving around the user interface and the scale allows you to resize objects so for this one let's say for example we have a rectangle and we want to scale this proportionally if we want to do that then let's we're going to press k as a shortcut and once we have that you can see this double edged arrow as you can see right here so this is the normal arrow if you want to resize it it's a normal twosided arrows but if we want to if we're going to scale for you to know that you are scale there's like four arrows like two on each side so that means that you are um enabling the scale option so right there scaling it lower and bigger it's just basically a proportion right there so if you want to go back just press v and right here as you can see your move cursor so next is our so i'm going to delete this if you want to delete anything just press the object and press backspace or delete so next one is our frame tool so frame is like the most one of the most common elements used to create an app design so frame and frame is like here so if you click on frame you'll basically you'll have a lot of presets frame presets on the right side so you have like the phone tablet desktop and all those things so basically what these means that these things are the dimension of the screen size of each device so if you click on like frame oh sorry if you click on frame and click on iphone 13 pro max then basically you have a frame like or like an artboard or a canvas the size of the iphone 13 pro max so this is like the exact um screen dimensions of that device particular device and for the slice tool this is one of the most like one of the lesser known or lesser used tools in figma so i don't think you need to worry about this i i don't think i've ever used it before as well so no need to worry about this as well so next one is the shapes the shapes are here the shapes are like the building blocks of the user interfaces like apps are built around shapes like um rectangles which are basically your buttons your menu icons or something like that basically they are shapes that were like modified to make it look like an icon or something like that but that's something that's quite advanced so don't worry about that right now the main purpose of shapes like i mentioned is like they help you create the building blocks of user interface like buttons icons and all those things and basically sections like on top section or a menu section right here so let's change the color and something like that just a little accent on your app design so we'll dive into the details later on but basically that's how shapes work so shapes you can they have a variety of shapes to a shape if that makes sense or a polygon so you have the option to create a line so if you press line or press the l and you like drag it anywhere you'll form a line right there so if you let go you'll now you have a line so if you want if so you don't need to worry about creating um straight line because if you created it something like this you can always just set the angle to zero so now you have a straight line so if you want it to be like vertical you can just change it to 90 and you're done so let's delete that and then you have an ellipse which is basically a circle and an arrow that arrow like hit like this is basically a line with an arrow on the on the edge which is basically selfexplanatory again so again polygon so this one you can customize the size of this um shape so we here we have our yeah over here we have like three sides or three corners so if you want it to be four now you have a diamond five pentagon all those things so basically it's very customizable so if you want a custom shape just go to the polygon tool and start selfexplanatory and place image oops place image is basically a way for you to import images in your canvas so i usually don't open this drop down and place an image what i do is just you can just drag and drop from your desktop to your figma canvas you can drag and drop items there or you can also do a command shift k like like like that and it you can easily import images from there so pen tool is pencil is basically it kind of requires like immediate experience or a bit of experience in figma because even i am not well versed with the pen tool so basically this is your way to draw so to draw things like um for example like this or basically like blobs basically those elements like to that add some styles in your design so that's how pen tool works and yeah it kind of requires a little bit of experience for you to like get familiar with the pen tool but with the app that or with this practice video um we won't be diving into so much about the around the pen tool so we'll be mostly using the shape so no need to worry about that for now a pencil pencil is basically a way for you to like if you want to draw like arrows like that basically um you can do that so pencil tool is something that is also not used as much if you are going to design an app screen or an app ui so you won't be using the pen tool or the pencil tools as much as the shapes so no need to worry about these things as well but yeah it pays to know how these things work so the text tool again here text and you can type the quick brown fox just like that so you can click on text or just shortcut key t and just type in like that and yeah so the hand tool is basically lets you move around the canvas as well so it's just like the move tool but the hand tool is basically lets you move around like this so if you have like multiple designs this is a good way for you to navigate to those on designs so you can also the shortcut for the hand tool is h so let's cancel that so h hand tool or you can also press space or hold space and while you're holding that you can like just move around so this is my approach to the hand tool because it's also the same approach with other design tools as well yeah so this one comments basically for collaboration features if you want to comment here just click on the comment or c hotkey c and type in this looks good and there you go and you now have generated a comment in the design and basically anyone who is invited to this file will be able to preview your comment just like that let's delete this or basically um resolve and here are just your profile share if you want to share your file to other people and then you play if you want to preview this as a prototype so here is the play like this is what it would look like in an actual device your your app design here is your basically your zoom on settings uh if this is like a 50 zoom and all those things so on your right on your left side rather you have your layers and assault assets panel so layers are basically how your objects are stacked on top of each other so if you have here the rectangle you have the rectangle one if you are going to copy and paste or if you're going to duplicate this so ctrl c and control v now you have rectangle two so rectangle two is basically on top of rectangle one so that's how layers work so you're like a very beginner knowledge here so if you want to like change the color of that just to emphasize on how these layers work so here um underneath this um rectangle two is rectangle one so that's how layers work so as you practice more you'll get the hang of things but yeah this is how layers work so if we group them they are basically combined as one layer so it but yeah this the group the group itself is one layer but underneath that group is the rectangle one rectangle two which are still on like in different layers so if that makes sense um i hope it does all right so page basically if you have like multiple files like for example page two so for page one for example this can be your ideas and this page two can be your design so if you want to like stay organized the page one can be ideas page two will be your actual design or you can just put both ideas and the designs in one page there's also uh there's nothing wrong with that and for the assets these are stuff from like components so if you're a beginner like me when i started out i never i almost never like access this pat assets panel because these are like most of the time um components like were housed in this panel and like any other assets like i think images i can't remember but mostly these are like for images icons basically components stuff that that really doesn't concern on most beginners especially me when i was starting out when i was just practicing figma i was more concerned about utilizing the bare bones um functionality of figma which is designing the designing an app and basically get things done so assets for now you don't need to worry about these things so let's delete this so next on your right is your design prototype and inspect panel so design is basically for example let's create an object again like a shape rectangle so when you click on this the design panel will give you a lot of options so here is your x y position so 84 basically means that they are 84 points on the x axis so if you place that to zero then it will like be placed on the zero the xaxis of the frame that it's in so right now because it's inside this frame right here if you click on zero um basically it will be placed on the very edge of that frame which is this iphone frame so the same goes for if we put zero on the y axis it will go to the very top just like that so that's how x and y axis work in sigma and this is basically width and the height of the shape or the rectangle so if we customize this right here so if you hover over this w letter you'll see the like the double edged arrow and if you drag it just you can just like customize the width of the shape and same goes for the height you can just like customize it just like that or you can just input a number whichever you want and here is like your proportion setting or constraint proportion if you want to scale the object just as like what we did earlier so this is also another way so if you want to scale it proportionately click on constrain proportions once this is enabled whenever you like customize the numbers in here like for example if we customize the make this 200 basically adding another 100 in the height then the width will also have like like double so basically we we made the height doubled so the width was also doubled in the in value so if we make the height again of this like double it double the height to 400 then the width will also be doubled to 600 and all those things so that's how constrained proportions work so basically it mostly concerns um adjusting whenever you adjust the settings right here so here the angle the corner radius if you want to adjust the corner radius make this a rounded rectangle this is where you'll do it so corner radius just drag it like that so the bigger the object the more corner radius you'll need if you want it to look like a rounded rectangle so if this is like a 50 in height let's set this to zero so if this is 50 in height if it's just a small object a corner radius of maybe 20 is good enough to make it look like a rounded rectangle or even like eight yeah just like that um we now have like a corner radius set to eight and it look it already looks like a rounded rectangle so here constraints on constraints is basically where your i would like to interpret this as a way where your where the object attaches itself to like for example um the object rectangle one is inside this iphone 13 frame right so if our cons if our constraints are set to left and top whenever we resize this um frame then the object itself will remain at the left and will basically attach itself to the left and the top um sides of the frame so if we change the so if we change the size of this frame on the right side then it won't move at all even if we change it to the bottom it won't move at all but whenever we change it to the left as you can see right now it's it is attaching itself to the left side of the frame i hope that makes sense um so yeah um right here and goes to the top it it's basically attached to the left and the top part so yeah that's how those things works that's how i'd like to interpret things um scale for now for scale if we want to like change this size so something like that then basically it will follow the scale of that frame that it's in okay so next one is a fixed position when scrolling this basically an interaction feature you don't need to worry about this these are blending modes so also if you don't this is quite also like a little bit of familiar knowledge with blending types but for now we don't need to worry about these things blending modes transparency of the object so set to 50 those things and then these are the color options so i've been using this a while ago so by now you've probably been familiar with how these things work so just select the object and the fill and right here you can change the color to whatever you want and then you also you can also enable like linear gradients um radial gradients and all those types of gradients or you can also add an image and upload an image just like that that's also possible and then stroke is basically allows you to add a border or a stroke around your object or any kind of object so here basically where your stroke is positioned in so if it's center inside or outside that frame and the effects is basically your drop shadows so these are some things that you can play around with as you gain more um familiarity with the design tool or design approaches so but for now we don't need to worry about this thing so export is basically if you want to export your file and upload it to a website or something or a social media you can just basically export this export to jpeg now you'll have an image of your app design so that's the figma user interface all right so now that we know the basic functions of each tool in the user interface let's try to create a simple app design using what we've learned so far so we'll be redesigning a symbol to do this app that i found here so this is an app called tictic so this is an existing app and it's one of the most or not really one of the most but a more popular um todo list apps out there so some youtubers out there are using tiktek because it's a very simple to do this app right here as you can see um so we'll be copying or redesigning this app from scratch so let's just copy this image so right click copy image and just paste it here so now we have that one now we have an image as our reference so let's delete this frame oops it's frame so let's click on the frame door or press f and select um iphone 13 pro max or iphone 13. um i guess i'll just move forward with iphone 13 from here we'll let's just crop this image first because um i'm a bit distracted with this um second device image on the background so to crop this you can just hold command if you're on a mac hold command um or control then just drag it like that and now you're just basically cropping the image so let's just focus on this user interface because this is the ui that will be redesigned or reengineer from scratch so here as you can see we have the hamburger icon the today basically the title of the screen or view and then the more settings that today are basically a list of tasks to do and then a plus icon and be another set of icons in the tab bar or basically we don't have to represent all of these accurately but if you want to learn how to come up with these things just continue watching the video all right so now that we have this let's just redesign all right so first things first uh we have our um status bar right here so if we want to have a status bar like this one you can just google ios 15 you or 15 ui kit on figma and as you can see right here you have the ios 15 ukra figma the first thing the first on the search results and once you arrive in this page you can duplicate this so i already have this in our um on my figma file so once you have this so let's verify so let's say for example we want to duplicate this so here let's find the let's go to components and find the status bar oh it's here um after looking for the status bar component just double click on here make sure to keep on double clicking until this item is selected so as you can see here the rectangle piece we have the whole of the status bar so just copy command c so i'm using a mac so i'm using like mac terminologies here but if you are using on if you are using windows you can substitute command for control or if you're um for option you can substitute option for alt so here command c and command v here and there you go now we have basically you can copy and paste in between files so that's also one of the good things about figma so here from here we can just right click and detach instance because basically it came from a separate file and we don't want to mess things up here just drag it on the top or basically if you want it to be exactly at the top just make sure both items are zero and then we make sure to check fixed position when scrolling make sure that it's always on the top layer so everything that's fixed in fixed position is always on the top layer so for example if you duplicate this if you put this here as you can see it's displaying underneath that fixed layer so okay enough segway uh let's move forward with the next item is the um hamburger icon the today and this another icon right here so another thing here for if you want to have like icons or illustrations basically anything you can just rely on plugins or you you can create them on your own so if you want to create them on your own you can just create different lines of like different rectangles and their smallest possible size until you get the right size or the easy way is to go to plugins and look for icons eight so icons eight is our icons plugin of choice because it basically houses a lot of plugins and different styles so it's in bubbles cloud and ios it's in material yeah it's in google's material design language it's also in office like microsoft office language basically all those things but we are sticking with ios because we are designing this as an ios app for example so ios glyph click on azure glyph and just type in menu and now you have like a menu and it's free so if you have an icons 8 account and if you're using an icons 8 account for free basically if you are on a free account you'll just use this as a png so png is basically an image and you won't be able to customize them like their colors and if you scale them up and down there's maybe there may be some compromises when in terms of the quality but if you just want to practice there's nothing wrong with using png here let's resize this so if you want to resize and be more precise with our measurements click on make sure to click on these constraints proportions and click on 24 because that's the typical size for icons so just put it here and then let's type in today text tool today type in that and then let's change the font to bold and that's good so you don't need to worry about which font to use by default i think figma is using enter so there's nothing wrong with enter it's a very um web friendly and ios friendly font so it also is a bit similar to ios default font so the default font that you're seeing on your iphone it's quite similar to enter so there's nothing wrong with that so next one is the settings icon or maybe more icon something like that let's say type in more so right here you can see more and there you go again this is a png file as you can see here the icon is image so it's not a vector or an svg file so svg is basically is most preferred because it lets you customize and scale images without losing its quality so as you can see right here there's some pixelation that's going on but again we're just practicing so there's nothing wrong with this so again make sure it's selected change just and there you go so if you want to make sure that they are aligned you can just drag the arrow just like that and then make sure that they are aligned vertical center and there you have it so the bigger approach when it comes to like grouping this items like in one row is to like right click and group that's how i did things before but if you want to have a little bit more advantage as a beginner the right thing to do is to use right click and add auto layout so the shortcut for this is shift a so this is one of the most valued features in figma suppress shift a because it will let you change the position of elements whenever you're in auto layout mode it allows you to change the position of the elements responsibly and you don't need to worry about the spacing in between them the margins between them and all those things because basically it's auto layout the figma itself will automatically arrange this stuff for you so to note that if you're an auto layout you'll see this icon right here like a three three lines so basically they are stacked um from left to right something like that so from here we will just change the padding to 16. basically padding is basically the space inside the frame so it's like the padding so it's like a margin but inside the frame so let's say name this as header so this is the header there are 16 margins as you can see so if we hover over this frame auto layout frame you can see there's like um overlay of red lights so as you can see and if you drag and you keep on hovering it'll show up like a 16 value basically this is the 16 pixels of worth of space from the edge of the frame so that's how padding works so let's just align this to the leftmost side of the frame just like that and we can also create if you click on this independent paddings we can create separate padding sizes or thickness to each side so the top padding can be 64. if it's too much you can just make it 24 or 32 something like that and the bottom padding here at the bottom of this frame can be 16 again and if we drag it and let it snap to this just below this um status bar and we need to resize this because as you can see it's not utilizing all of the space on the right so let's just make sure that it will snap on the right and from here go to this um advanced auto layout settings click on spacing mode space between and just like that it will automatically utilize all of the available space all the available space with the auto layout tool so i think we're doing okay we can adjust the settings just like that again so basically from this um the padding is evenly distributed across all sides so 16 on top bottom left and right so next one is today check emails discuss marketing when etc etc so from here let's just create that today and let's adjust the size of this to maybe 14 so it should be a little bit smaller than this one so let's change this to medium or semibold that works and then let's type in four and then let's type in or let's go to the plugins again and then go to the icons 8. so if you've opened icons 8 before let's close this so if since we've opened icons 8 before the shortcut to open it again is command alt b if you're in windows the shortcut is ctrl um alt p if you're on mac control the shortcut is command option p rather command option p it opens up the icons 8. so basically that shortcut opens up the most recent plugin that you opened or used so moving forward let's just put it here um chevron basically this download arrow is called the chevron so this chevrons will be displayed in different orientations uh like app chevron downgrade all those things all right so again it's in png let's change this to 24. don't forget to constrain proportions there you go let's put it beside here maybe 16 or 20. yeah keep it 16 then from here let's select them both like just drag it just like this and then press shift a convert them to auto layout and let's adjust the space in between these two items so the space between the four and the chevron let's make it maybe four or eight give them enough space and then from here we'll select this one and this one and two so you can just drag them just like that then press shift a again and there you go let's edit the padding our padding by default should be 16 because that's what um we've set under above so we want it to be consistent so here let's drag it just like that and adjust the oops let's close oh let's just move it around go to the advanced layout settings spacing mode to space between there you have it so that's our today like subheading and then below that is our task items so our task items are comprised of like a square a task and the time itself so let's see um the square oops square so let's make this 40 as well make sure that they are proportioned and add the stroke just like that and let's make it blue yeah i think that's good or maybe a little bit darker and here you can see the there's a fill color so the main color is gray so we want to remove that or disable that so you can either turn this off or remove it altogether either way and then let's resize this to 24 there you go and we can adjust the thickness of this stroke by two to emphasize on that and yeah i think that's good the corner radius can be i guess two yeah all right so we have the checked box and the task just type in check emails and then the time so 18 o'clock and then the icon there's an icon like clock right here i guess this one how the time should be so select them both or um since we can't change the color of this icon so if we are using svg we can definitely change the color of this to something gray but since we we are using png or an image file we can just set it to like 20 or 10 and this one you can just apply the fill and use this eyedropper tool this will basically adapt the color that this one has so if we hover over this alarm clock icon basically you'll see the time in the same color as this one so select them both or maybe let's resize this first in 24 or 16. then the 18 can be i think it's too light so let's adjust this just like that 18 and this one you can make it like 20. there you go so 18 so select them both and then pressed shift a now as you can see this one are stacked on on top of each other they're not side to side so what we're going to do is just to click click on this frame and then this one make sure to click vertical direction and just like that and make sure to this one make sure that they are top right aligned not center so that's the difference if we click on this oops that's the difference and then adjust the spacing to zero now we have it so we can make this smaller a bit more smaller to 12. and then select them both and shift eight and then maybe eight this one can be a bit more smaller check emails 18 o'clock so from here we can just select them all so we have the first frame the check box and the task item and then the time so select them both and press shift a again now we have another layout frame and we need to first change to alignment to left aligned and then change the spacing oops i'll change the padding to and then a guest 8 and then spacing mode should be spaced between now let's drag this just like that all right we have today check emails so we want to have multiple tasks right so in order to do that we only need what we need to do is just select this one and press command d or control d and just drag it here you can see so let's redo that part again task item one will be duplicated command d now we have task item two so we just need to drag it below make sure that it's below and just like that until it will snap you will feel it whenever you're um changing its position so let's adjust the top and bottom padding to maybe four same goes for this one four and just drag it just like that oops all right so once they're snapped duplicate them again and it will snap duplicate it and once you've set that position you can just keep on duplicating things and basically um change this to like this cost marketing plan morning meeting branding campaign and whatever else tasks that you want to do so we want to keep this um same as this one here we go so now we have basically basically have these things already so but as you can see let's close this as you can see this tasks are grouped together right they are in this like white group of frame or shape so in order to do that we just first need to we should have done this earlier by the way but we forgot so what we're going to do is just change this make sure to click on the iphone 13 pro or iphone 13 frame this is our top level frame click on the fill and change the color to something like um something off white maybe blue and then change it to a little bit whiter but not pure white so yeah i guess that works and then we are going to select all of these things so these frame this check emails this this cost marketing plan this task basically you will select them all and as you can see by the way this one frame 2 is showing up and the reason for this is because frame 2 is not inside the iphone 13 frame so i should have us seen this earlier so in order to fix this you just need to put it down just like that it's no longer showing up and basically they're all part of the iphone directing frame they're basically inside this frame so next one is again going back just select them all and press shift a and just like that we now have this group of tasks so we just need to change the color of this frame so task section let's rename this section as task section then we have our layout grid or rather the fill and as you can see we now have it in filled pure white so it's kind of it's kind of separated to the background so let's just adjust the some um settings here so let's click on the today frame like the day frame um let's set the padding to maybe eight there you go and let's also change the top and bottom padding of this task items to two so they are usually so we set them earlier as four so let's just change them all so double click on each of them and so in cases like this you may want to not just drag to select all of them so you can also hold shift so while holding shift you can select multiple items just basically for selecting multiple stuff so apart from like dragging things selecting multiple items there's also a good way to do that so just change this to four and there you have it now from here we will set the bottom padding to something like 16 or 8 something like that and then from here we will press shift a again so that's so much all the layout but you'll in a few seconds you'll understand why so press shift again now we have like a frame basically this slightly container it's basically a frame within a frame or a frame outside the frame so as you can see it it's already overlapping the iphone 13 frame so we just need to do this and then this one then adjust the padding to 16. basically it snaps hug contents oops this one so this one now the task section we need to select fill container basically it will wrap inside that frame but at the same time respecting the spaces that we've set a while ago so this one again let's select them each task item let's select each tax item the full container as well and just like that for the today as well let's select make sure that today frame is selected check fill container and there you have it so as you can see this is the beauty of other layout so even if you're still a beginner um teaching you these things will basically unlock a lot of possibilities for you when designing a figma so understanding the auto layout this early in this stage is a very useful technique let's just design an icon or a button so you'll know how to design one as well so let's press o this will open up our ellipse tool and while you open up the ellipse also press o again hold shift and then drag it drag the circle just like this until your desired size so i want it to be a bit like 64. or maybe 62 just changes here 64. and then put it here and then what we're going to do is to click on the eye dropper tool from the color settings and hover it over this button and now we have the blue button right there now next thing to do is just type in plus and then what we're going to do is to right click and flatten this object or text what will what this will do is that it'll convert the text into a vector shape which we can now scale accordingly just like that and change the color of it to something like blue or white or black basically a vector image now or vector illustration or vector object so if we put this together here and change the color to white that's basically our button so let's change it with that and now you have the plus icon now here we can just group we can either group or frame but for me i'll choose the frame selection and then i'll make sure that this is constrained proportions and now we have it and then next thing to do is to check on the effects and drop shadow and let's just make sure to lessen the transparency of this shadow to ten percent now you have like a floating button right here um let's change the color to something like blue as well and then let's reduce the opacity of this on this one let's reduce its opacity to something like that so it's like a floating blue button next one is um if you want to change the background color of your canvas by the way just click on the background here change the color to something like black um whichever you prefer so let's just put it in something like this grey so we can better emphasize on the screen that we're designing and then put it at the bottom so from the last part we just need to um get this icons i think these are the check box calendar focus timer settings let's just you know what let's just select four so maybe i don't know what this is maybe it's a unique icon or something so let's just find checked this checkbox all right so now we have the four icons let's just resize them all select them all and then constrain proportions then 24 or 32 and then from here let's just align them together but we have the on tasks the calendar the timer and the settings so these things are like i think they are custom icons that were made exactly for the app so we don't have like um i think i don't think we can replicate these things so let's just select them all press shift a let's drag it here and then maybe adjust the opacity to 20 or rather let's don't do that make sure to select all of them so here select all of them in this layer you can also select them via the layers panel while holding shift and then press 20 percent and then since we have our um auto layout this is like tab bar let's just resize this and make it snap to the sides and just like that and adjust the spacing make it space between or maybe um packed in the middle and then adjust the spacing manually or 40 eight something like that i think that's good maybe 54. yeah i think that's good and then from here we can set the bottom padding or rather this um left and right padding to 16 and the bottom padding to 32 i guess and 16 here so the reason for this is because we still need to put the home gesture button so i don't i'm not exactly sure what's that what that's called so yeah we don't need to worry about having the blue icon basically um you can just do it on your own like this and like a rectangle and duplicate it and just like that make a check mark or something we have a check mark it's not perfect but that i think this will do so select them both and command e or flatten and just drag it here and then this one will make it blue um make sure the eyedropper tool is selected and make it in the same color as this one so this one will be in white and white select the white and then resize this to maybe 16 resize this to maybe 24. and yeah also this one let's put this to scale and scale so this one i think the better way to do it is to create a frame just like this one select a frame tool the fill will be in the same color as this one so let's delete this and then this one will be inside this frame and now you have like um a check mark um icon so the size of this is 32 so let's just make sure to change this so 32 by the way if you want to customize the size of this um frame without affecting the elements inside you should hold control or command hold command and resize this on side to side so 32 and 32 there you have it and change the corner radius to maybe eight or four or three yeah oops change this to four and there you have it so let's drag it here change this to 28 i guess or 24 yeah that's better change the coordinates to two and let's change this and remove this now we have our task item and there you have it so one last thing let's move back to the ios 15 ui kit file and then let's find the gesture button or the home button i think it's here somewhere oh it's here so here just double click double click again and then copy and then paste so before we do anything just make sure that it's inside this frame so by default copy and pasting items won't automatically be redirected inside this frame so you just make sure to drag it over and then this will highlight the page and then what we'll do is to align bottom and align center and basically i think we can adjust it make it snap to the sides and there you go we now have our home indicator so we can detach this instance and circuit again and fix position now we have our two simple todo list app that we designed and figma so it took quite a while but again it's it's very simple it will take some time um if you're a complete beginner it will take some time to get used to but just keep on redesigning things and you'll be good to go so if we present this click on the present and then here you go there you have our app design that we designed on figma again if you're a complete beginner the best way to practice is to redesign apps it's just like learning how to play guitar like you learn by playing existing songs once you know your way around the tool you can be more confident and write and play your own song the same goes for design and development by reengineering existing works we can learn from how such designs were achieved alright so that's it for our stepbystep guide to designing with sigma in 2022 i hope you learned a lot from this video let us know in the comments if you have any questions until then see you and good luck with your design
