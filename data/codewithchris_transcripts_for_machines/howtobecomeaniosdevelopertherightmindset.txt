in the previous video I covered all the options for becoming an iOS Developer but in this video I want to lay out a stepbystep plan for you to actually achieve it so at a high level the previous video covered the following options for becoming an iOS Developer selfteaching via course attending a university or college program or joining a boot camp and if I were to start all over from day one I think I would choose to learn on my own there are just so many good resources out there including my own where someone can just pick up this skill so with the selfteaching option in mind here's step one of how to become an iOS Developer step by step the first step to becoming an iOS Developer begins before you even start learning and it is to prepare yourself mentally don't underestimate the power of mindset because it drives your actions if you start this journey with the wrong mindset you will fail so here are three things that I would do to have a successful mindset here's thing number one I remember when I first started teaching iOS back in 2013 and I noticed the pattern some people would learn iOS and go on to find jobs and launch apps in the store While others would give up pretty early on there were rarely people who would make it halfway and then call it quits when I asked the quitters why they quit it would always be something along the lines of it was harder than I thought or I didn't have time or coding wasn't for me now my issue with these reasons is that they're flimsy excuses for not achieving your goal and why you're quitting an actual dealbreaking reason to quit would be something like my map blew up and I can't use it anymore or I broke my finger so I'm gonna have to pause this for now so this led me to draw this learning curve to help people visualize the Journey of learning iOS development I called it the hump terrible in him right comment below if you have a better name and I may adopt it it starts off easy and you're enjoying yourself but starts to ramp up in Challenge and frustration at this point if you thought it was going to be a walk in the park to launch your own app or that you learn the skills for a sixfigure job in a couple of months you'll quit I guarantee it because your expectation is so far from reality that when reality finally hits It's a steep draw but if you persist work through the frustration and Challenge and learn from your mistakes you'll make progress little by little and then after a certain point things will get easier and you will reach your goal here's the interesting thing though the learning material and skills required they do not get easier in fact they get more complex as you progress but my observation is that people either quit here in the beginning or they reach their goal so what gives why would the material be the most complex here yet the difficulty is also the lowest here the reason is because the graph doesn't measure objective difficulty of the material it measures your perception of the difficulty of the material and why is that more important it comes back to mindset let me walk you through it in the beginning you're not sure if you can achieve your goal it's starting to get harder and harder and it's beginning to seem like reaching your goal is less and less likely that's what many people will give up especially those who thought it was going to be easy but you're different you stick with it and you struggle a bit through little successes and small wins here and there something begins to change in your mind you start realizing that you can do it and that's all it takes really perceived difficulty starts going down as confidence in yourself rises even though the material is getting more complex so to sum it up have realistic expectations about the time it'll take and the commitment it's going to require from you to gain these valuable IOS app development skills you will encounter frustration but it'll be worth it in the end and this leads me to thing number two if you are learning a new skill how long do you think it would take perhaps you've heard of the 10 000 hour rule for Mastery in Malcolm gladwell's book outliers but have you heard of another book by Josh Kaufman called the first 20 hours his research led him to believe that if you spend just 20 hours of deliberate practice on the right skills you can get pretty good at whatever skill you're learning now whether that's true or not I'm not going to debate that but it is the inspiration behind this strategy and that's to open up your calendar and pencil in 20 one hour sessions to learn iOS development this way you're going to prioritize it with the other things that are going on in your life plus it gives you a shortterm goal more on why that's important a little later now let me tell you a story I turned 40 this year and it's the first time in my life that I've been able to consistently get exercise why because I finally made room for it in my daily routine and I prioritize it just as highly as everything else in my life and now it's just a part of my day and I don't have to give it a second thought so don't try to learn iOS on top of everything else going on in your life make a routine spot on your calendar preferably a quiet time where you can be undisturbed and prioritize it finally we come to thing number three we all have a reason to become an iOS Developer oh it's going to be great when I'm working on Apple and making hundreds of thousands of dollars each year or ah I can just imagine my app going viral and making millions from the App Store the problem is that it's a long long journey and when you're struggling in pain tired you want to quit you can feel like you'll never reach that end result you might as well quit now and watch some Netflix right this might help set two goals instead of just having one the longterm goal you know this is the initial reason that caused you to embark on this journey and also have a shortterm input based goal this could be a goal of doing 21hour sessions before even thinking of quitting or maybe you'll commit to learning for at least two months before considering quitting the important thing is that it is near term and it's input based meaning that it's within your control because you can control how much time and effort you input so thing number three is to have two goals the longterm goal which reminds you of why you're on this journey but the shortterm goal helps you keep making progress bit by bit do you notice that all three mindset strategies are to prevent you from quitting prematurely and sometimes that's all it takes if you just persist a little bit longer past the frustration there is a high chance that you'll succeed okay next step number two is very important because guess what there's a ton of stuff you don't need to learn in iOS development and you can still reach your goal you can dramatically reduce the time it takes to reach your goal by selectively choosing only the specific skills you need and it all depends on what your goal is and that's what I'm going to break down for you in step two and it's in the next video so make sure you hit subscribe so you don't miss it in the meantime please comment below which is your favorite mindset strategy number one having realistic expectations number two penciling in the sessions on your calendar or number three having two goals instead of just one alright thanks for watching and we're going to continue this how to become an iOS Developer step by step in the next video I'll see you there
