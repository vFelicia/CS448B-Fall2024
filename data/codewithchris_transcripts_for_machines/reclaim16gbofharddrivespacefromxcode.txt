hey guys what's up it's Chris here in this quick video I just like to share this tip with you which helped me reclaim a ton of disk space from Xcode I don't know if you've noticed but Xcode actually takes up quite a bit of hard drive space I recently joined this mailing list called iOS dev Nuggets it's a free newsletter that comes out every Friday Saturday with bitesized tips and tricks for iOS development that often only take a couple of minutes to read it's curated and created by cui Boonen sorry if I mispronounced your name but there's some really good stuff here so I was browsing the archive and I came across this one reclaimed disk space from Xcode I was curious how much disk space Xcode was actually using and I'm not going to reveal it right now let me just show you as I delete it in front of your eyes how much space I'm reclaiming and I'm just going to demonstrate it right now you go into finder drill down into your hard drive and you're going to see the library folder you can see here the paths that we want our library developer Xcode and it's not this one but it's actually the library folder specific to your user account so as you can see under Chris here there's a library folder this is the one you want if you don't see one for yourself you actually need to it's hidden by default so you need to reveal it and what you want to do is you have to go into your user account folder you actually have to dive into this folder and you want to click this little gear you want to go to show view options and you're going to see this check mark show library folder and you want to enable that now if you don't see this that means you're probably not you're not probably not inside your user account folder it's not enough to just you know start expanding the tabs and you know go like this and then to like this and show view options you can see that it doesn't exist you actually have to double click and go into that folder okay then you're going to go show the options and enable this show library folder okay so with that out of the way let's go into library let's go into developer let's go into Xcode here I've already got that open and we want to get rid of two folders derived data all right let's open this up actually before I open up let's go see how much space this would reclaim so this one is okay I would reclaim 600 megabytes you know it's a good space there and this is just data for each of the projects you're working on they just get regenerated anyways so sometimes if you haven't touched projects like you've moved on and you're working on other projects you can delete the drive data from old projects and even your current project when you rebuild your project it's just going to recreate that stuff this one's a biggie though under iOS device support so it's a combination of iOS physical device you have plugged in an iOS version you are running with it and if you have been doing iOS for a while you might have accrued a number of these folders they will be regenerated for you when you plug in a device okay so let's see get info this guy is a whopping for me at least fifteen point five five gigs I'm going to go ahead and go in there and delete that that and obviously I'll have to empty my trash as well to reclaim that space but I just got back like 16 gigs yeah so that's it I'm interested to see how much space you guys have reclaimed so leave a comment below the video if you actually do this and let me know if you can beat 16 gigs or even if you don't let me know how much did how much harddrive space you've saved and if you've enjoyed this tip you can browse the archives if you like other tips make sure you join iOS delegates and last thing is before I sign off I just figured I should mention that I'm not getting anything from this I just discovered iOS dev Nuggets and I thought that it was really useful so I'm sharing with you guys I haven't met or even talked to Hui boon before and yeah I don't knock anything from this alright so enjoy and I'll see you guys next time bye for now
