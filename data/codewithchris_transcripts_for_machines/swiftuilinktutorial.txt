hello it's Chris here and welcome to another Swift UI Basics tutorial in this one I'm going to show you how to use links in Swift UI apps so it's great for opening up a link in Safari from your app or opening up the settings perhaps from your app all right let's dive in and take a look before we begin one quick note we have a free exco project containing sample code for all of the Swift UI components use it for your own projects or just to learn from get it at brand new xcode project here let's get rid of the image and text element and we're going to type in link now there's going to be two different ones we're going to go through both let's do the first one this one allows you to specify a piece of text to represent the link followed by a URL instance for the destination that's where you want to bring the user to this one allows you to specify the destination and then any custom view that you want so let's do this one first and let's uh just use my website as an example and then for the URL here you're going to create a new URL instance and I'm going to use this string one here and you can just type in the web address you want to go to but because this returns an optional URL instance we are going to just force and wrap it here now if it cannot create that URL it will crash now let's uh actually I don't know if you can do it in the preview I don't think so but here I've launched in the simulator if you tap on it it comes here simple really really easy now if you want to let's say open settings we can just I'm just going to copy and paste this because it's essentially the same thing except in here you would type in app settings colon and then let's take a look at that now I'm not familiar with any other types of um this is not exactly a URL scheme I don't think if you know other ones that you can open please let me know in the comments below but that allows you to open the settings very very handy so let's take a look at the last one this one right here where we can spe uh specify the destination H it's typed it out for us okay so let's use that and then as for the label I am going to use an actual label element if uh you've never used that before it's very handy you can specify an SF symbol for it I happen to know the SF symbol that I want to use right there and let's style this a little bit so I'm going to add a width of let's say 250 height of 40 you can see see it there already uh background black foreground style white and then clip shape and just add rounded rectangle Corner radius of let's say eight so something like that and that is how you would have a styled link you tap on that goes to the Apple website so that's how easy it is to use this link view in your Swift UI app if you want to download the sample code for this we've got it all in a single handy exod project in fact it contains sample code for all of the Swift UI components so that you can learn from it or copy and paste the code into your own project just visit cc. dkit it's a free download I'll leave it in the description below the video too
