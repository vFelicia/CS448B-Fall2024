in this video you'll learn how to configure subscription type inapp purchases through app store connect i'm going to show you all the tips and best practices to set up your inapp subscriptions and i'm going to walk you through stepbystep just how to do that through the app store connect portal hey code crew it's chris and welcome to code with chris the place to be if you want to learn how to code and build apps this is the second lesson in our revenue cat video series if you missed the first lesson be sure to check out the playlist right there here's where we are in our seven step process all right let's get started now let's configure our inapp subscriptions i do want to mention that revenuecat has an awesome piece of documentation they call the ios product setup and this one guides you through the process as well as providing very helpful hints on how to name your identifiers and how to set up your inapp subscriptions for future scalability so i'll be referring to this documentation as we go through this process and i'll also link to this in the description below the video alright so we're gonna set up two inapp subscriptions for this demo uh one is going to be a yearly access to unlock pro features and the second one is a monthly access to unlock the pro features so both subscriptions they unlock the same level of features it's just that one is yearly recurring and the other is monthly recurring all right so let's go ahead and select auto renewable subscription and click create now you're going to be able to specify two things here for your first subscription one is a reference name and this is not user facing this is just for your own reporting purposes so here you can use a name that would make sense to you so for example i might choose rev revcat demo annual and i might put the price or something like that so let's say 59.99 and let's see what revenue cat recommends down here so here here they are going through the process that we have and so they put the when it recurs the price and also any introductory offers because with your subscription you are able to offer some sort of a discounted access or trial even like maybe a zero dollar free trial um for a specified amount of time for firsttime users so that's in their documentation this is what they're setting up and i'll show you how to set this up later but for my demo i wasn't planning to do an introductory offer at all so there's it's straight off the bat going to be recurring at 59.99 and then also product id so this one is very important to note if and here it also points it out a little bit so this product id is a unique id for your inapp purchase and this id spans across your entire account across all apps so whatever product id you put in here and you create this inapp subscription even if you delete this inapp purchase product in the future you're not going to be able to reuse the same id so it makes sense to have a little bit of organization and a sort of naming convention here and if you're following this documentation this is what they recommend so a good way to keep these ids organized is this sort of convention here app underscore price underscore duration underscore the introductory duration and introductory price so that results in something like this screenshot here rc underscore 39.99 underscore one year underscore one week at zero dollars so that's free so for us uh we're going to put something like rcd for revenue cat demo i'm going to put one oh actually the next thing is the price and then i would put one y as one year i'm going to go ahead and click next i don't have any introductory offer so i'm not going to fill in anything there and now we're going to be prompted to create a subscription group so what is that if you read this blurb it actually explains it pretty well it's basically grouping together different subscription products that the users can switch between but they can only be subscribed to one of those products inside that group at once so for example in this demo app we're offering to unlock some sort of pro access right and we want to let the user switch between yearly membership and monthly membership they might choose to upgrade or downgrade at any time right but they can only have one of them active we would put both of those in the same subscription group so that's what we're going to do here and if we take a look at the documentation let's take a look at right here they point out here that the reference name for this subscription group is actually not user facing so you're going to be able to it it's only you that is going to see this in your reporting so use something that makes sense to you all right so for me i'm going to call this the rev cat demo pro access subscription group and the reason i'm not putting the price or anything in here right now is because i'm going to be putting both the monthly and the yearly in the same group to let the user switch between the two and they're at different prices and so i'm not going to put the price in the group or anything like that so users can only subscribe to one subscription within a group at a time but can change subscriptions within the group as often as i'd like all right so let's go ahead and create this subscription group and then we're going to be able to configure our inapp subscription finally don't be worried if this takes a little bit this process i've found in creating a new ins app subscription or inapp product takes a little while for it to crunch behind the scenes while that's going on let's flip back to the documentation so here we can see that the next step is going to be setting the subscription duration and the price and the price is going to be uh different depending on the the locale and the currency so you're going to be able to fine tune all of that and then there's going to be a separate tab for introductory offers and according to this documentation is showing you how to set a free oneweek trial so that's where you would set your introductory offers and then the next step would be to add localization so depending on which language you can provide different names for this subscription let's go back to app store connect and see all right so we've got our in app purchase subscription here so here's the reference name you can see this is the group reference name cleared for sale if you want this to be available for sale when it's approved you enable this for the duration this is where we're going to set this to one year because this is our annual subscription and then let's hit save first and then we're going to hit this plus button beside subscription pricing and i'm actually going to choose i'm going to choose usd because the 59.99 i was referring to usd so you can see here there are a lot of different sort of price levels but it's not a free form text field so you can't just specify any number you want but i think there are a lot of options here going up by one dollar amounts okay so let's click next and then we're going to be able to specify different prices for the different currencies and actually countries and regions so for example for canadians i can specify you know a different amount okay so i'm just going to go with the defaults here i'm going to click create and uh all right that's great and before we hit save this is where you can also put those introductory offers you can also customize some of this promotional offers but we're not going to do that in this video let's go ahead and hit save all right let's go back to our subscription by clicking this breadcrumb up here now we are going to set our localizations next so go down here hit this plus icon let's choose uh english us and let's choose a subscription display name and description now if you're unsure about where this is going to show up because this is user facing revenuecat has a handy diagram that shows you exactly where that is and so this is what we're filling out right now for english us and they have a tip here use the same description display name and the description for all of your products that unlock the same level of access this results in a much cleaner app store listing as your suite of products grow now this was really counterintuitive to me in the first go because i wanted to do something like this i wanted to say you know annual pro access at 59.99 and you know put something like unlocks proaxis or whatever and the problem with this is that it's going to display this description name for all countries and regions so this price in the description name might not be the actual price that they end up paying because remember there's differences between the currencies and exchange rates right so if i'm in canada it's going to be 79.99 for me and if i see this in the subscription display name it's going to be really confusing and it's going to make me pause and stop in my tracks and not go forward with the purchase because i'm not sure what's going to happen next so there are other ways to grab the grab the currency and grab the price so you don't really want to put this in here so we can go with um go with the recommendation here and just call this pro access and this is the display name let me show you where this information shows up in an app store listing or on the screen where the user manages their inapp subscriptions so if you scroll down just a little bit more you'll see here when the user manages their subscription in the settings of their phone they're going to see the subscription group display name up here and then you can see the subscription display name which we have just said was pro access that's going to show up over there and then below that you're going to see the price and the duration so you don't need to restate the price or the duration in the subscription display name all right so let's go back to our app store connect and let's save this localization here and then the final piece to configure this specific subscription is to provide review information now you're going to have to put a screenshot of where it shows up in your app what it looks like and also some notes for the reviewer and when this passes and is approved then it's going to be available for sale the problem right now is that we're just doing development we don't really have any of this information yet but in order to sort of get this subscription to a state where we can actually you know use it in our development process and test it and see it we actually have to put in a dummy screenshot so i've prepared actually let me just tell you how you know the size if you click this little question icon and you click learn more you can see down here it sort of explains what all of the fields mean but down here this app review screenshot if we're if this is a inapp purchase for ios you can see that the screenshot must be at least 640 by 920. and so i've just created a blank 640x920 image and that's what i'm going to put in here for now that one right there and you can see it's just the gradient you can use a solid color it doesn't matter and we're going to save this now in the future we're going to provide the real screenshot and some actual review notes before we submit the app for purchase or for review i mean all right so now let's go back to inapp purchases we're going to configure the monthly subscription now this is going to go by a lot faster in fact it's pretty much the same thing except for you know the duration and the product id and the pricing and so feel free to fast forward through this part i'll just also move a little quicker so i'm going to add it to the same subscription group because it's unlocking the same level of access and i want to let the user switch between monthly versus yearly all right so we've got our new monthly inapp subscription so again let's choose the subscription duration this time to one month i'm gonna hit save and let's add a price so here i'm gonna choose usd at uh where is that 9.99 hit next all right i'm gonna go with the defaults and hit create okay let's save this and then let's go back to once that finishes saving all right let's go back to our inapp purchase and scroll down and add a localization for english us again this is going to pro access because it's unlocking the same level of access let's hit save and then let's add that screenshot that i had as a placeholder and we're going to hit save again all right let's go back to inapp purchases here the last thing we're going to need to configure is under subscription groups you know the one that we created to house the two the two inapp purchases we actually have to add some localization strings for this as well so you can see here in this group there are two levels they're going to be able to switch between the two and right here you're going to be able to add localization okay so this one actually gets displayed to the user this reference name just shows up in our reporting but this subscription group display name shows up when the user manages their subscriptions so let's go back to the documentation as you can see there it points out ocean journal subscription so that's exactly what they're going to see for this string here so i'm going to say rev cat demo subscription let's just call it that and the app name display options you can see down here the app name is up there ocean journal and the reason why it gives you two options just use the app name or to use a custom name is because what a lot of people do for their app name in the app store listing is they put a lot of keywords and and subtitles into their app name so it might be something like revcat demo dash the best tour app on the app store or something like that you know it wouldn't just be the app name because people like to use that space to maybe rank for extra keywords or to be more descriptive about what their app does so you're able to use a custom name if that's the case that way it's not going to have all those extra keywords and subtitle information in your subscription you know in this managed subscription part because it would look pretty messy so here i would use a custom name and i would just put revcat demo that way in the future if you change the app name in your app store listing it's not going to affect what the what they see here when they manage their subscription all right so let's go ahead and save that you can see here right away those change they were saying missing metadata and now they say ready to submit we're not going to actually submit it we're just we just need to get it ready to this state for us to be able to work with it even in development and testing all right so now we're done in the app store connect portal we've got our inapp purchases configured the next step is to work in revenuecat where all the magic happens all right we're doing awesome so far we've configured the inapp purchases in our app store connect portal and now we're ready to use revenuecat if you haven't gotten your free revenue account yet sign up for one at cwc.to revcat2 again i don't get compensated in
