hey it's Chris here and in this tutorial I'll show you how to use a label in your Swift UI project now labels allow you to show text with an icon side by side very easily let's Dive Right In before we begin one quick note we have a free Xcode project containing sample code for all of the Swift UI components use it for your own projects or just to learn from get it at cwc.com are a couple of different ones you can choose so for example if you have an image in your asset Library you can specify the text that you want and the image name here but what we are going to do instead is use this one right here where we can specify a system image which means uh an SF symbol so for example just like that you've got a text with an icon side by side now an easy way to take a look at what icons you have is to open up the library and go to the symbols tab you can use any one of these for example eraser just replace that and you're good to go you can also customize the label to look like a button for example let's change this back to the Apple logo and then we are going to give this label some shape by specifying a width some height we're going to set the background color to Black and then let's change the foreground color to white so that we can actually see the text and finally we are going to add some rounded corners and then you have something that resembles a button now a word of warning though you wouldn't want a label that looks like a button because this isn't actually interactive it's not a button however with the button element you can specify custom views right with the link element you can specify a custom view as well to represent that link or that button that is taable and so this would be perfect you could use a label to put into your button or link or any other view that is interactive if you want to download the sample code for this we've got it all in a single handy exod project in fact it contains a sample code for all of the sft UI components so that you can learn from it or copy and past P the code into your own project just visit cc. swiftui dkit it's a free download I'll leave it in the description below the video too
