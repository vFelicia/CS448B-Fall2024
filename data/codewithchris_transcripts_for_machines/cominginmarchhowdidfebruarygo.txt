hey code crew I can't believe it's March already in the last month's update I said that we're gonna lay down some groundwork before we started on the more complex apps and we have done that in February but there are a few more video topics that I'd like to cover around source control around using figma and designing apps and stuff like that but we're close we're definitely close it's funny how things move so much faster in your head versus reality I thought that I would be a lot farther along than I actually am right now but in addition to producing videos for YouTube I've also been updating the videos in my paid courses and come to think about it I've been doing that since 2013 because Apple just changes things all the time so if you had bought the course from me in 2013 to this date you'd still have an uptodate learning resource and I think that's pretty cool now some quickfire progress updates since the last February update video I have started the process to organize all of my content into an index so that newcomers can come and they know where to start and where to progress but it is a process because I'm literally taking an inventory of all of the videos and content and articles that I've produced and seeing what's up to date and where things should go so it is a it's quite laborious but it's happening another thing I talked about last month was monthly challenges to get you guys going to get your feet wet just to give you a reason or a goal for you to take action and for me personally I know that's kind of the kick in the butt that I need to get things done so the first monthly challenge is going to start in April because in March I'm actually getting going to be away for a little bit so we'll start in April but my idea is that in the month of April the challenge is to build and ship an app into the App Store now I know a month isn't a lot of time to build a very meaningful app but it's gonna force me and you if you partake in the challenge to take imperfect action right to just get something out the door that's usable but maybe it's not your ideal dream perfect app but just to get it out the door and stop procrastinating or analyzing or planning you know I know I get stuck in that rut a lot so hopefully this challenge is going to force us to kind of break that habit and just to get into a new habit of building and shipping and taking an iterative approach to building an awesome app now for beginners who aren't ready to build their own app yet they can always do my 28 day app challenge to kind of get up to speed so that when we run this monthly challenge in May again they'll be ready to build their own app and ship it into the App Store so that's pretty much what's happened so far in February we're going to continue to lay down the groundwork that I talked about we're going to start building those complex apps I also have some oneday build ideas for people to progress to after the foundation and beginner stuff so there's a lot going on and I also really look forward to the challenge in April because it's the first time I'll have done something like that all right thanks for watching I love you guys I'll see you guys next time
