what is up YouTube and all the YouTube subscribers and Watchers of code with Chris I am NOT Chris but I am one of his friends my name is Steve P young and I'm the founder of app masters CO and in this video I'm going to show you how we help the client get featured by Apple through a cold email so stepbystep instructions on how to do that so here's the feature that we're able to help our client land the app is called are you in over your head alright you can see the two different feature sections that we got the client on and just to give you a little brief overview of who I am I am Steve P young I'm an India developer and I would say I've been known for the app publicity more on the PR side app promotion things side of things I'm the founder of at masters Co the place were awesome folks in the mobile space come on to tell their story and you can actually hear Chris's episode in the links below this video if you want to check it out what a great guest Chris did and if you just started out and you can hear how he all started and I was able to use code with Chris to eventually leave his job but for about me I started the app business in 2011 I have over 30 plus apps on the podcast app master scope I've interviewed over 350 amazing app entrepreneurs from the biggest biggest names the cofounder of Shazam Yahoo weather Paul had died from tweet bought all the biggest apps in the world have at least done their interview on a pastor so go check it out and then I've been known for recently getting publicity on helping plants get publicity on some major blogs I more VentureBeat The Next Web touch arcade tech cocktail and many many more so you can all check it out if you want to at masters dot Co is the website and now on to the content well let's say you want to get featured by Apple you made a great looking app it's well done you spent months and months listening to code with Chris to figure out how to actually implement every little thing to make it so polish and now you want to get it out into the masses and you want to get featured by Apple it's the holy grail for us app developers well I'm gonna show you step by step how to do that through a cold email step one make a great app I know I'm being Captain Obvious here but it's so true not all apps are going to get featured by Apple they want to highlight the best apps in the App space and Apple they are good about making sure that they care about their consumers right they care about their customers so they want to highlight apps that really highlight the Apple brand well and so make sure you've done all your legwork you'll listen to all of Chris's videos and you made a really really good looking out make sure it's designed well as well yes I know it's obvious so I wanted to highlight the fact that yes it's obvious but I think it's worth stating to please make sure you made a good app okay number two and here's the real cool thing about it find the right contact person at Apple now that's really easy I'm gonna show you how to do that right now now the apps are so huge right there's thousands of thousands of new apps coming out every single day and what you have to find is the right app store manager at Apple there are app store managers that cater to a specific category so here's what you do put app store manager into the search field oh I'm actually on LinkedIn so go to linkedin.com and look search for App Store Manager okay and I'm gonna hide everybody's info because I don't want you seeing everything but what you want to do is make sure you go down here and you pick Apple as the current company and then what you want to look for is the app store manager for your specific category okay and so just make sure there's a ton right you can see here that there are a few that cater to games there's gonna be you that cater to education there's a few that's gonna cater to whatever category you're trying to get into just make sure you find the right person for that now that you found the right person to contact what you want to do next is find the email address I know it seems pretty obvious let me show you a dead simple way on how to do that so I'm gonna go back to my screen I'm using Google Chrome right now and go to a site called email hunter CO email hunter CO and I'm using Google Chrome so I installed the email hunter for Chrome extension that you can see right here now what you want to do here I'll click it just so you can see it but it says email hunter for Chrome and this adds this little button right here so if you're on somebody else's domain so if you're on at masters CO or if I'm code with Chris calm and you really want to find out Chris's email address you can click this little button right here and it'll give you all the email addresses that are related to that domain really handy tool right but I love it too because it actually adds a button on to LinkedIn profiles I'm not going to show you the email addresses of the Apple contacts because I don't want to expose them but I'm going to show you that when you have the email hunter tool installed and you're on LinkedIn you get this handy button and even if you're trying to target anybody I don't like leads or anybody else maybe even a journalist you can click that button it'll give you the email address of that person I've found the email address of the Apple App Store manager using this exact process so email hunter is the tool to use number four the next step after you found the right person you have their email address it's time to write a compelling email so what's that involved it takes a lot of time I've done it a lot and it takes a lot of time to really figure out so it's gonna take some practice and I would say ask your friends ask your network to see what they think of your email and make sure you get it right ok you want to get the first one right so here's some things to include in your email this is what we do really well number one have a video keep it short sixty seconds show the general gameplay of your app so whether it's a game or if it's an app like a Productivity app just show the general use of the app doesn't have to be high quality but the more high quality you can get it the better it is because literally four reporters and four Apple employees less important for the Apple employees but definitely important when you're reaching out for the press the quality of your app will be used to judge the quality I'm sorry let me rephrase this the quality of your video would be used to judge the quality of your app so if you have a really bad video they're gonna think that you have a really bad app right now for when you're pitching Apple it's gonna be ok because they understand that it's just a general gameplay and they want to show them what the app is all about rather than tell them so it's always better to show them if you can include a video do it you have to have it number two this is one thing I think most people forget about is to leverage social proof so things to think about when you're trying to think about social proof like Steve what is social proof well have any of your apps been featured that's one thing right if I haven't featured why am i watching this video okay I get you I get you but just in case it has make sure you make it known do you have millions of downloads now for this specific client he had over 15 million downloads in the app store already and so this is something we leverage in our social proof one of the bullet points in our email is going to be hey Jared has over 15,000 15 million downloads across his past apps and that allows to see that gives Apple a clue on like oh this app must be worth checking out also another thing that you might want to think about is your pass did you work for a big company a big game company what other companies that you can leverage you know a lot of headlines or X Google X Apple X PayPal right these are all you leveraging social proof from the past so if it's an X Apple right it's and I'm Apple I'm more likely to look at that email and see all right who's this person do I know this person what have they created the other thing that you should put in there are you using any new Apple features so as a at the time of this recording there's a new iOS update did you use any of those new features that you can highlight in your pitch Apple loves between apps that are capitalizing on some of the new features that they just release so iOS updates or Apple new features that they have an iPhone these are things that you have to leverage to get their attention all right and you can even put it in your update notes so if a new app putting your update notes or if into the release notes put it in there about what this app is featuring okay it's a great way right you can get our you viewer that says oh my goodness like they're utilizing this new feature it's a great way to get get their attention next thing is you got to keep it short I get a ton of pitches too because the podcast but you really really really have to keep it short okay so like I said about social proof put on sentence in there about social proof why the app is different of video and any new Apple features you want to keep it really really really really really short and I like to use bullets to break things up and so here's why this app is cool bullet one bullet two bullet three by that's it you know think of it like a resume how you would format a resume you want to make it so that it's kimmel skimmable and did the email is alright so keep it short number three or the last one is ask for feedback ask the app store manager for feedback on the app you know the saying that if you ask for advice you get money and if you ask for money you get advice same true same holds true here when you ask for feedback you get more like they're gonna be behind you I'm sure they get a lot of pitches right and so it's best to ask for feedback if you're just starting out and I Kayla this my new app I'm so excited about it and I know you see a ton of apps I'd love your thoughts just like two second thoughts on what you think I can improve on the app and you can do wonders for that all right so to summarize what you should include in your Apple and your pitch to Apple video include a short little video of your app in action social proof if you have any leverage that I mean even me I leverage the fact that I've interviewed over 350 awesome app developers including the cofounders of Shazam 3 bot so if clear you know that's me leveraging social proof right so you can find it just look for it any new Apple features that you have in the app that you incorporating the app you keep it short and then ask for feedback if all else fails just ask for feedback all right so once you email them if all works out you'll get a reply back and they'll say hey can you fill out these forms and it's gonna be like an Excel spreadsheet and send over some designs that's when now nothing's still guaranteed at this point but your chances of being featured are very very high because what they want to do is see what features are using what is it compatible with and then any design elements that they're asking you for so banners icons whatever they need make sure you get to them quickly all right and so what if everything works out you get a reply and people forward it on to different people and then they'll ask you to fill out some forms and send over some designs now that you sent over some designs here's what you got to do Thursday every Thursday the App Store refreshes okay every 30 day the App Store refreshes so on Thursday make sure you go into the App Store and then you look at the different categories so here's a example that I'm gonna give you sorry I was poking around but you go to the App Store in iTunes and you go to the different categories so if your app doesn't make it into the main App Store this is the main app store front page right with all the new apps and all the best new games and this feature if it doesn't make it there then I recommend checking out the different categories so you go to all categories if your app is under game click there and then also look at the different sub categories that you may have submitted so when you submit to game they ask you for this sub category and I'm gonna show you this is actually where we were featured my client best new games and here it's great right drove great number of downloads this is where my other client is now being featured auctioneer right they said over a banner and this is where their Apple is using their batter and so this app happens to be on the front page too but if your app doesn't you if you smooth the designs you submitted the templates their spreadsheet and it doesn't make the homepage don't fear you can possibly get featured in the specific categories so make sure you go into the category here's my client right here best new games but that's a way to do it and the last thing I'll leave you with is if you do get featured make sure you leverage that feature right you can go out to some of these publications again in your PR pitch and say hey look I just been featured by Apple check it out put a little screenshot to show the social proof that you did do it and leverage that for even more press write even more coverage get you the downloads that people may not it's not everybody US app developers I'm in there every Thursday just checking out the new apps but not everybody's doing it and so it's a great way to leverage press publicity and get press by saying look I just been feature put that screenshot with the little arrow to your app alright and that's it that's a great way on how you can get featured through a cold email let us know what you think if you like this video put some comments below what's your favorite part and what are you gonna do maybe put in the link to your app so that we can check it out as well in the comments below again my name is Steve P Jung I'm at at masters Co this is a video exclusively for the code with Chris audience thanks guys
