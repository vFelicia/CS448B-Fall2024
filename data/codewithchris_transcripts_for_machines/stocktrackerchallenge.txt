hey code crew it's chris here i just want to quickly let you know that we have a new community app challenge last month we did the weather app and thank you so much to everyone who participated the apps you guys built were awesome in the last video i actually did a showcase of all of the app videos that you submitted go check that out if you haven't already this month i'm asking you to build a stock tracker app now this app should manage a list of stock ticker symbols and connect to an api to fetch the latest stock quotes in the challenge we've suggested a stock api to use but feel free to use any that you'd like the unfortunate thing about the one we chose is although we used it for our solution when we built our project it had free batch stock quotes which was really handy but since then it's only made single stock quotes free so if you know of an api that allows you to do batch stock quotes for free definitely let me know by leaving a comment below now in the process of doing this challenge you'll turn your knowledge into skill sometimes we get so caught up with just watching videos or just reading books and we think we understand it but it's not until we apply that knowledge and try to turn that into practical skill that we discover our weaknesses our knowledge gaps our skill gaps so that is one big reason why we are doing these community app challenges just to give people a reason to get handson and start coding and start applying what they're learning oh and we've also created a nifty new code crew forum badge that you'll get just for participating now in terms of deadlines you have until the end of this month june 1st to submit a video of your completed app there is a link in the description below this video for you to record a video straight from your browser or upload a prerecorded video and then at the end of the challenge we're going to take all of your videos and compile it into a showcase reel and post it here on youtube just like we did for the weather app now if you're brand new to coding and app development this challenge may be a little bit beyond your skill level for now but i've got some great resources to get you caught up start by checking out our 14 day beginner challenge right over there and that's going to get you started on the right foot so if you're going to take part in this challenge please leave me a comment below and thank you for watching i'll see you guys in the next video
