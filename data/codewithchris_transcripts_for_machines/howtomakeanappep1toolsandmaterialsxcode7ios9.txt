hello everyone welcome to how to make iphone apps with no programming experience in this lesson we're going to take a look at the tools and materials needed for iOS development in this lesson you're going to learn about where to get these tools and what they are and a little bit about how an app is constructed with these tools and lastly you're going to learn about what you need to do in order to publish your app into the App Store so let's get started now the only thing you really need to start iphone app development is a Mac and before you go and dismiss the video I want to let you know that for PC users there's a low cost solution as well but before I get into that let me tell you why you need a Mac so the program which we write our code in to build the app it's made by Apple and that program only runs on the Mac operating system unfortunately for PC users there's a service called Mac in cloud comm where you can rent a Mac and from your PC you can remotely log in to that Mac and so you'll see the Mac desktop on your PC desktop and the price for that service as of this recording is a dollar an hour or $20 a month for unlimited use so that's a really low cost way to get your foot in the door with iPhone app development instead of having to shell out over a thousand dollars to buy a Mac laptop or computer so what is this program that's forcing us to get a Mac or rent a Mac well it's called Xcode and as I mentioned before it's the program where we're going to write our code and build our app so it's pretty essential but however it's free you can get it at the Mac App Store and if you don't know what that is think of an app store for your phone except it's on your computer it's on your Mac and you can download programs for your Mac it usually requires the latest operating system and about three gigabytes of hard drive space so what does this Xcode program allow you to do well if you think about an app for a second at the very basic level it consists of two things the first thing being the user interface that's what the user sees on the phone and what the user interacts with and the second thing is all of the logic and response that happens in response to the user interacting with the app so Xcode allows you to create this user interface visually in fact if you'd like just by dragging and dropping elements onto the screen and second of all it allows you to write that logic and express that logic in terms of code so you're able to code what happens when a user taps that button or what happens when the user swipes and you're able to use that code to perform calculations or go fetch data or respond to the user or update the view furthermore Xcode also allows us to test our app so in addition to creating the user interface and wiring up that logic with code we can run the app in Xcode and Xcode has a great simulator which will appear on your screen to mimic the iPhone and it will run your app inside of that so you can see what your app looks like and you can use and test your app without actually having an iPhone so it's not even a requirement to have a device if you want to build an iPhone app I mentioned that we use code to express the logic and what happens when the user interacts with your apps user interface well that code follows a set of rules and follows a certain framework just like a language that's why it's called a programming language you may have heard that Apple will release the second programming language for building iPhone apps called Swift and this is what the lessons and the course is going to teach you how to use the reason Swift is better for beginners to learn how to build apps with is because the syntax and the structure of the language is a lot more natural and intuitive so it's a lot easier to read and to understand for beginners in the past when I taught the course with objectivec a lot of beginners struggled with the syntax and all of the different symbols and characters that would be used to write the code beginners would struggle with remembering what keywords to use and how to declare certain things with Swift the syntax is more of like plain English so it feels less like you'll have to learn a separate language so I'm really excited to show you guys how to use Swift so that's all there really is to it at the very core you're going to be learning how to use Xcode to build your user interface and you're going to learn the Swift programming language to respond to user events and user gestures and to express logic so after you finish building your app in Xcode and testing it in the simulator how are you going to get it on your device or how are you going to get it into the App Store well this part actually requires you to have an Apple Developer membership and this is a yearly fee that Apple charges it's $99 as of the recording it has been actually ever since the inception of the program it's been $99 a year and that allows you to publish as many apps as you want into the App Store so when you sign up for the Apple Developer Program it gives you access into two things one is called the provisioning portal which is the place where you upload your certificates and create your profiles that dictate which devices your app can be installed on and the second thing gives you access to is iTunes Connect and that's the place where you're going to create the catalog listing for your app you're going to upload your screenshots it's basically when you browse the App Store and you see all of those app list things with the description and the screenshots and the price and everything you create those things in iTunes Connect so you're going to create the app listing for your app in iTunes Connect and then you're going to upload what you've created an Xcode and then that's where you publish it into the store in iTunes Connect you can also check the stats for your app in terms of downloads and rankings and if you have ads or if you have I add in your app you can check your earnings and you can get those types of reports and if you have inapp purchases iTunes Connect is where you would configure that sort of stuff as well so there you have it the only thing you really require is a Mac which will allow you to install Xcode which is free to build your apps and to test your apps and then if you want to deploy your apps into the App Store or on an actual device you can sign up for the Apple Developer Program which gives you access to two websites to allow you to do that sort of stuff so I hope that was useful to help you understand the ecosystem and all of the tools and materials that we'll be using in the next lesson we'll get started with dabbling in some Swift code
