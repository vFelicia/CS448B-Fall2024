in this quick video I'll be going through some of the basic math operations that you can do with constants and variables and just in general equations so why don't we do pretty basic stuff right here and add two numbers together using the addition operator so this is probably what you'd expect you know but there are a couple of them that you might not realize so that's why it's important to go through it there's plus there's it's gonna get zero from that and there's also a multiplication using the asterisks and there's division and then you can also change these together if that wasn't obvious so we could do something like this okay so you'd get eight alternatively we can use the power function to do Exponential's and that that is that looks like that and it accepts two doubles so this would be the base and this would be ^ we can do two and three but notice that it accepts a double right so if I try to run this right now I'll still get eight so that's fine too I was just worried that these guys were actually integers so these were detected as integer types instead but that's that's awesome there's square root just to show you a couple other ones and some that you might not be familiar with there is ceiling which basically rounds up so if I just had let's say bar D is equal to five point or four point five let's put D in there see what we get you know that that would be five right because it rounds four point five up and then there's also floor which runs down so if we do that you would get four from four point five and next I want to show you the increment or decrement shorthand because that might not be immediately obvious and I tend to use it a lot it's actually very useful so let's say you want to do something like a equals a plus one because you want to increment a by one so you'd get three right so you're basically taking a adding one to it and then reassigning it back to a so if I printed this out well yeah we can just look at the preview window here if I ran this you would see three here on the side now another shorthand way of writing this is just to go a plus equals one like that and this would give you four now right because we're incrementing it again the reason this shorthand exists is because you tend to do this a lot when you're expressing your logic and your writing algorithms and your code incrementing and decrementing tends to happen a lot so that's why that exists you can also decrement like that so decrementing by one now a would be three right this is equivalent to writing a equals a minus one and this is equivalent to writing a equals a plus one so if you see me doing that in code now you know what it means
