my hey everyone can you hear me how are you guys all doing now that i've been streaming for a week and a half it's nice to see a lot of returning faces and getting to really know you guys and i know my streams are still a little bit random because i'm sort of like thinking on the fly about what i want to talk about uh or what we can do on these streams um but i think you know give it a week or two and we'll get into a natural rhythm where i'm thinking maybe one day of the week will just be like group study code um or work and then another day might be like just hangout ama or maybe showing you guys a particular project that i'm doing and then maybe another day it'll be a presentation where i teach you guys something but for that if i'm gonna be coding in xcode and compiling i'm gonna need my new mac that hasn't actually come in yet hey good morning james yeah what time of day is it for you guys does this time slot work out um i know there's no perfect time that's going to work for everyone unfortunately but hopefully we can you know make the stream at a time where most of everyone can make it and for me i actually prefer uh prefer the mornings just because i feel like i'm the most alert after lunch is probably the worst after just eating a meal hey sergio thank you for joining um during your afternoon hello mr worker and hello slava thank you so much for watching uh the videos i know it's been a while did you guys catch the the video that just came out yesterday um i took a lot of that uh coding tips from the audience and from the newsletter so from time to time i'll pose a question to our newsletters and every saturday we send one and i got so much feedback coming back that it was it took me a long time to actually compile that feedback or not feedback because i was asking for coding tips for beginners um and these the people who reply there was a mixture so the people who you know were into ios a little bit farther down the road they gave their advice to beginners and to their former selves but for people who were just starting out they gave me feedback on what they were struggling with so that's really helpful too and i've got a bunch of that feedback for a future video hey john yeah is anyone else having a low low volume or low audio issue let me know um i think from my end the the mixer the audio mixer looks pretty good if i increase the mic anymore i might start getting some feedback and that's not going to be good for your ears all right well just let me know in the chat so uh let's get started with what i wanted to show you guys today and in the last stream i talked about this code with chris app and so we've made a little more progress on it just in terms of planning out this next sprint that we're working on let me just increase the font size a little bit more zoom in so that you guys can see let me just pull up another chart just for those of you who have not weren't here in the last stream i can show you what this is all about just very quickly before i dive in and also i'm treating this stream as a ama so i'm gonna be checking the chat a little more frequently for your questions so do drop me any questions down there in the comment section or the live chat and uh and i'll i'll get to answering tutor you can't hear me as your speakers don't work wait as your speakers don't work or my speakers don't work can you guys even hear me i think my mic is yeah my mic is on okay you scared me there for a second i honestly thought all right let me just let me just double check her i don't want to be talking for an hour without anyone actually hearing me okay you know what i okay so maybe i'll turn down the music maybe that will help you know let me turn down the music a little bit maybe that will actually help okay cool tutor your your speakers don't work okay got it got it got it okay so i unfortunately i can't do anything about that you're gonna have to get some new speakers tutor all right cool so i'm going to talk about this cwc app and just very briefly because i do see a lot of familiar faces here so i don't want to rehash everything that we talked about in the last stream but essentially this app is going to be the official code with chris app so we're going to feature our content in here but also for our program members you know the cwc plus program where we have all of our courses and stuff those people will be able to log into the app and then download videos for offline access so that's one of the huge motivating factors for creating this so in this charting software we've identified several different user journeys that you know this app will include but the very first one and we're just getting started with this app so you're really getting a you know on the ground look at it uh we are doing this guest journey where people don't have to create an account but they can still view some of the videos in particular the 14 day beginner challenge so that's sort of the background in the context what we've done here is we've mapped out some of the tasks that some of the very first tasks that we're going to need to tackle in order to get that done so today on the stream i thought i would answer your questions while i do some of the work here and we'll see how how well i can do that because that's sort of splitting the attention between two different things uh i mean one of the very first things we need to do is take a look at the data on the screen uh and we do have some wireframes that our designer has put together and so from these wireframes they're not finalized so it's maybe not the best idea to work off of unfinalized wireframes uh us as a team we haven't like gone through this and sort of decided okay this is all of the data we want to show on the screen but i'm going to use it anyways just for the purpose of maybe demonstrating some of my thought process and how i would take a look at an app and and think about how the data is gonna be represented on the back end uh and i'll talk about the back ends that we're using and stuff but anyways for now let's take a look at the chat because i did say that this is going to be an ama so i did see some questions come in okay i think i saw a question from robert so robert asks how did you get started on your programming journey so for me it was it was pretty accidental because i had to take a mandatory coding class in high school in grade 10. so that introduced me to the world of programming and i sort of fell in love with it there i didn't know that this was something that people could do you know write programs and make computers do stuff so it was just this epiphany that i had and that i could even use my pc at home to write programs so that really opened up my eyes and that sort of became my hobby for a lot of the time and it was at that time i decided okay as my career that's what i want to go into for you know postsecondary education that's what i want to do before that i i think i wanted to do graphic design i had always liked graphic design so let's see what other questions we have here when learning to code what's the best approach as in how many hours of reading and watching tutorials to actually writing code uh i so in the past i said that this is a onetoone onetoone because um whatever you're learning whatever you're seeing someone do in a video it's best to try it out yourself on your own computer because that's how you learn it helps you retain the information and you know reading it and watching it is sort of just like the theory but it's not until you actually do it yourself that there are a lot of like insights that that will come up and you sort of understand it in a different way so just to tell you a funny story for me when i first started learning ios programming and back then it was objective c um i had already been you know programming as a professional at that time i was i was working fulltime at a company and they had the first ipad project for a news broadcasting company here in canada they wanted to build a news app to feature their articles and stuff so i was tasked to build this and at that time no one else at the company had had known objective c or done any ios development so i picked up a book and i read it and because i had that background that programming background and computer science background it was it was pretty simple to read through and i i basically went through the whole book and through every chapter i understood what they were talking about uh things made sense but i didn't do any of it right i did i wasn't actually doing it while reading it and at the end of the book i thought okay like now i have a firm grasp on objectivec and ios development well when i sat down to actually start i realized i didn't know how to start and so that became you know later on this experience became a basis for how i teach and how i recommend beginners to learn is that you know you cannot just watch the videos or read the book and you shouldn't even wait that long to get your hands dirty so as much as possible try to start if you don't have a mac you can still start there are you know online what is a repel is one is it repellent yeah this one this is one that you can use it has a you can do swift in here online so even if you don't have a mac right away maybe you're waiting for it to come in or maybe you actually don't have a mac you can still learn swift through uh through things like this swift online editor yeah there are there are a bunch of different ones here so repel it this one i talked about this one is a little older one i don't know if this one still works yeah all right so let me i'm going to transition between the questions and here so let's come back here for a second and let's talk about our designer and sort of how he started thinking about it because you know as a designer you want to be following best practices and you want to um you want to design something that you know in the same design language that people are used to seeing for that type of app and so in talking with a lot of the different designers i i find that one of the first things that they do is take a look at other types of apps sorry other apps out there that are of the same type so in this case our designer took a look at master class and also at skillshare and i mean there are other apps out there that are video based you know online learning platform type of things but we've only taken a look at two of them so far and you know you want to get an idea for what other people are doing and sort of the user experiences that they have and obviously these larger companies have gone through user testing they've done iterations to improve the interface so you're sort of shortcutting things right by by taking a look at what they're doing in terms of the look and feel like that's going to be your own look and feel and your own design but there are maybe ways that the user uses these apps that you can draw from so for example i mean netflix is a big one and masterclass is one we were we were one thing that i want to mention in particular is the ability to download videos offline so if you guys have used the netflix ios app you actually uh you tap on each video or each episode you want to download and it downloads it whereas for skillshare they had a very different way of doing things so i don't know if it's shown here it's actually yeah here so for example for this course the skillshare course they have this toggle switch right here which when you toggle on it just downloads all of the lessons in that course and if you want to toggle like if you want to delete your offline downloads you just toggle this off so that you cannot download individual lessons and at first i thought you know i didn't like that lack of control but then i began as i used this app a little more i began to appreciate you know the simplicity of it so i don't have to manage individual downloaded lessons and episodes it's just a single toggle right and the idea is that if i'm going through this course chances are i'd want to watch all of these lessons in the course and so it just goes ahead and downloads all of them offline so i mean those are you know those are the reasons why that's just an example of why you do these sort of exercises and take a look at what other people are doing all right let's take a look at the chat here sigh i started you say i started programming in university i wish i could have started earlier yeah yeah same here um people are starting really early now my fouryearold daughter is learning scratch coding through school now so it's great to see that june welcome back it's nice to see you again do you think flutter or react native will replace native development so and then you had a second question there what should you learn first with ui or ui kit if you want to get a job uh so regarding the first question flutter or react native uh i actually haven't played around with them before so i can't say but um mark who i don't think is in the chat today but mark from big mountain studio as part of his fulltime job he was working with xamarin for a long time and so xamarin is is that sort of thing where i can't type properly where it's not native ios development but it's where you can use csharp and visual studio is it visual studio that you use xamarin with i don't know but you can build ios apps and android apps with it so he ran into a lot of difficulties with xamarin and i think his opinion is he doesn't really recommend it if you have a choice if you don't have a choice you're constrained by other limitations then you know you do what you have to do but in terms of flutter and react native i'll always see them as sort of like nonnative solutions and in my head at least i might be mistaken um those will never be as good as native if you want to harness the power of everything that apple has to offer on their platforms you know all of their apis and stuff because if you think about just conceptually um these crossplatform solutions have to they're like there has to be a bridge somewhere between what you do on flutter and react to the apple apis um and so it's always another layer that you're you're introducing on top so my opinion and again i might be biased and i might be wrong here so if anyone in the chat you know has great experiences with flutter and react native and have has really pushed the limits of it and and tested it out then um definitely chime in but my opinion is i i would go native if if you had to if you had the choice i mean and plus it really depends on how complicated your app is so if it's you know not using a lot of the lowlevel apple apis and it's pretty simple and you need a crossplatform solution where because you want android version and you want like your ios version then maybe that's a great solution for you so i guess it you know it depends and the job prospects for flutter and react nate react native i'm sure there's jobs out there and employers out there looking for those developers right so i don't think it sort of limits you but in terms of swift ui or ui kit if you want to get a job uh i honestly haven't been in the job market but i have seen swift ui pick up significantly since it was introduced and at that point in time i guess it was like a year and a half ago or two years ago now where i was like ui kit is still the the thing to learn if you want to get a job where swift ui is sort of like the play thing that you do on the side the thing that most companies might be just dedicating very little resources very little developers to explore but then now you know we're starting to see full apps built in swift ui that are pretty compelling and also you know with apple they decide what they want to push and that's the thing they're going to put their full marketing and pr power behind so the same thing happened with swift right when it was introduced over objective c and now swift ui so if they say like that is the future then you can be sure that over time um you know new features and new things could only be limited to swift ui and it's only a matter of time maybe we're talking about years and years into the future where swift ui might uh might overtake but in terms of job prospects maybe for like right now i guess you're asking for right now um maybe the simplest thing to do is just go on a job site right and then look for swift ui versus ui kit developers at the end of the day i feel like most ios developers won't be able to pigeonhole themselves into one right just because you are a ui kit developer doesn't mean you can't be a swift ui developer as well i feel like uh these things like they're not going to be looking for a swift ui developer or ui kit developer i feel like the job posting is going to be for an ios developer and you might just need to know both uh splash fruit your question is sort of similar do you think it's still worth learning ui kit i completed the ios foundations and databases course thank you should i remain learning ui kit or switch to swift ui so if you're starting brand new right now i would say that swift ui definitely is the way to go to start if you have already you know you're well into ui kit then to be honest swift ui wouldn't be a really far reach for you but if your priority is building your own apps right now and you want to like implement your ideas really quickly or maybe you want to try out one of the new apple apis that are just swift ui only uh then that's a reason to learn swift ui but i mean if you want to implement your own apps and you already know ui kit then then maybe just stick with that um uh what were you doing there before software too yeah so i guess you're asking about my uh my old company yeah i was a software developer there so zeus of hollywood got to go audio unacceptable i really want to get to the bottom of this audio problem uh is it too soft or is it staticky definitely let me know okay land asks if you had to start over learning swift what would be your best approach would you start by learning the fundamentals first or would you dive straight into a project i think you'd have to at least get some fundamentals down first before you can you can build anything if you just dive straight into a project you wouldn't be able to to do it so definitely learn some of the basics first like how to construct some basic layouts how to construct some uh basic to do some basic swift logic um thank you so much jun i really appreciate your your super chat thank you uh i would definitely learn the basics first land just like how to express some basic logic with swift how to build some basic layouts and then like i said before you have to get your hands dirty you have to definitely try things out so definitely again learn the basics and then go transition into trying to build your own small project start really small i know for a lot of the beginners my advice is uh a lot of people get into app development because they have an app idea but usually it's pretty far out of reach so don't lose sight of that app idea keep it in mind but at the same time realize that what you're learning can't be rushed it's a it's a skill it's a very valuable and marketable skill that um it's just like learning a language or learning piano or learning guitar or something it does take time and practice and if you have that sort of mindset where you know you can make it it's just going to take practice and time if you keep that sort of mindset then you will reach your goal you know often people give up because they had unrealistic expectations about how far they can get and how quickly they can get there uh sudito asks can we integrate swift ui and ui kit together in a single project yes you definitely can and you can do it both ways too if i believe i've only done it the way where uh i have a swift ui project and you integrate ui kit into it um but i haven't done it the other way around but from what i've heard you can and the reason why you you probably will have to do that to a swift ui project is because swift ui doesn't have all of the components and all of the cool things that ui kit has because uikit definitely has been around longer so maybe going back to your question splash fruit do you still think it's uh worth continuing ui kit versus switching to swift ui um that's one aspect to consider is that ui kit has you know a ton more libraries and controls and things like that that if you're used to using then by all means go ahead and stay using that but at some point you're gonna have to start picking up and learning swift ui okay so let's take a look at what we have here while we wait for more questions to come in so we decided to start with uh ipad we wanted to do this code base that would support mobile and ipad both form factors and maybe mac os as well but in this ipad format what we were imagining here is that when someone logs in they you know that there's a learning path and that's one thing that i i've learned over the years in teaching ios is that uh there's a ton of content out there but i think what's very valuable is organizing that content in a way in sort of like a stepbystep fashion for someone to follow and that's why someone would pay for lessons right or pays for a course even though there are tons of tutorials out there because you don't really know where to start and you want to be taken on a journey you want to be guided along and be told here's what you do next and here's what you learn next and here's you know and so that's what we try to do with our foundations course in our cwc plus and i've basically taken like the first 14 lessons of that foundations course and it's free on youtube if you go into youtube.com code with chris you'll see the 14 day beginner challenge in swift ui and that basically is the starting point that i would recommend then beyond 14 lessons even if you don't decide to continue with that after those 14 lessons you have a pretty solid idea of building uis in swift ui and also some basic expressing some basic logic with swift and you get introduced to swift as if you don't have any coding background because that was the intention for the course so that's in this app that's what i really want to present to the user is here's your starting point so this big gray block is going to feature that 14 day beginner challenge um and down here will be our different course listings that we have we have a course overview so when you click into a course there's obviously a description i want to have a overview video for each of these course descriptions sorry course overviews outcomes is actually something that i learned about when we tried to get our program into classrooms and schools the language that teachers use in school boards and you know in the education system i was not familiar with those terms and i learned that you know if you want to be taken seriously in that sort of realm you have to be speaking the language so learning outcomes is really important but if you're not in the education space like the school education space learning outcomes just means the goals like what are you gonna get by taking this course what skills are you going to end up with and so that's what that's what it is and you know it's important to list that out so someone they're dedicating their time and effort into taking this course or watching this lesson what do they get out of it and that's actually something i'm starting to really make a focus to do on the youtube tutorials as well in the upcoming ones is that in the right in the beginning of the video to tell the viewer by watching this tutorial what are you gonna accomplish by the end of it or you know show them the result um because often those tutorials are pretty long too okay so aside from this course overview page uh there's gonna be lessons and it really boggles my mind when i was starting this ios foundations course that there are actually so many lessons to it so anyways going back to looking at this data i've certainly forgot forgotten the purpose we were here um i wanted to model the data like how are all of these pieces of information that we see here on the wireframe how is it going to be represented in data right because the app needs to connect to some data source to get all of this information so you take note of things like this so a course might have an overview video right so we're gonna need some sort of stream url attribute for to represent that it has a title right a description learning outcomes if we if we actually end up doing that because like i said these wireframes aren't finalized yet but if you go down here this is actually sorry this is a lesson page this is an individual lesson so when you go down to an individual lesson you have the title of the lesson description of the lesson and also uh duration pretty simple not very complicated at all and maybe we'll just pull up i was planning to just to do this in a document let's check the stream see if there's any questions here june asks should swift developers also prepare uh for coding interviews and lead code and hacker rank you know i don't know what i i think it really depends on the types of companies you are applying to first of all i don't think those things would hurt like if you created an account on those and you have you know you spend time on them and you can show you know some sort of i don't know what they do accreditation accreditations or certificates or rankings or something like that i don't think it will hurt to put that stuff on your resume because i haven't been in the job market i don't know if companies are specifically looking for those types of credentials from those two sites but if they prepare you for algorithm questions or like technical questions that definitely cannot hurt another good way to prepare for interviews as a swift developer um someone that i actually always recommend is uh wayne bishop i don't know if you guys have heard of him before oh man not like there's too many wine bishops there we go so i believe that wayne bishop is an ios architect at a company and he his whole thing is basically helping people with uh algorithms and data structures and as you can see here to pass your ios interview so he has a lot of like books and services as well like he he has a service where you can actually help he'll like help you interview prep so i think he might i don't i don't actually know because i haven't taken it but uh he might do a mock interview with you that's what it's called yeah yeah so definitely check wayne out he's got even if you don't uh take any of his services or products he has a bunch of blog posts and stuff like that so let's talk a little bit about the data for this app and where that data is coming from so people will be able to log into their code with chris account and these accounts are basically um accounts the user store is on our wordpress platform on our website because that's what we use on the back end so in terms of authentication and and confirming that you actually have an account we're going to be hitting the wordpress api to authenticate you but then in terms of the the content and what you have access to you know whether or not you are a cwc plus member so you have access to all the courses or you don't have a membership which is fine because you can still access all of the the free content we have that sort of authorization on what sorts of courses are available to you is through the thinkific api so thinkific is the learning platform that we use um and they have an api for us to access to look at different things so for example we would be looking under enrollments to take a look at we'll probably pass in the email of the logged in user into this api to see what courses they are enrolled in and then this would give us a bunch of information back on what courses they have access to now i wish it stopped there but unfortunately it doesn't because this thinkific api doesn't actually expose the streaming video urls for all of the lessons so you can see here it has courses and each course will have uh chapters so chapters are modules and then each chapter will have contents and these are the lessons unfortunately these lessons do not give the video url for us to play through the app so this url that the lesson exposes this is just the url to visit that lesson page on thinkific so i don't think they meant for this api to be used in the in the way that we want to use it as you know a way to play the learning platform content on a mobile app now they themselves say that they have a thinkific mobile app but that's not what we're looking for we're looking to build you know a code with chris official app so what i decided to do or what we are going to do is we are going to keep a separate set of these videos on vimeo which we have a company vimeo account and then that those videos will have streaming urls unfortunately we can't store those streaming urls in thinkific because it's not a database or anything like that so we're gonna have to have a separate firestore database to keep that so now like this is getting more and more complex um the the benefit is having our own database where we can sort of store anything we want including these video streaming urls is that we can store other metadata for example if in the future for this app we want to do like achievements or badges or whatever for user metadata we can use firebase or the firestore database to store that information so just to do a quick recap the app connects to wordpress api to confirm your account to authenticate you it connects to the thinkific api to check what sorts of courses you have access to on our platform and then it's going to connect to a firestore database for the actual streaming urls and any other metadata we decide to keep about the user inside the app all right let's check some questions here a barcode asks do you have any tutorials on writing ios apps in objective c i'm a new developer and my work has older apps that i'm trying to understand on how to navigate i don't understand how to view and navigate to each screen in xcode unfortunately well so to start i i started my blog in objective z so and then on youtube if you look way way back in my channel you'll find a ton of objective c content as well so if you go to code with chris and you just search objective c i have a tutorial on um writing objective c code so like understanding it and let me just find it yeah blast from the past okay yeah so in here i actually wrote the equivalent for swift so if you know swift act this actually might be helpful and to be honest if objective c has changed since then this might not actually be relevant either so oh wait this is about learning swift from objective c you know i had something else anyways this is uh yeah this is what i was referring to so this is my objective c guide so this i was trying to teach people objective c here so this is really uh this is an old article i wrote in the first year of starting code with chris that's actually changed so i'll paste this url in here in case you want to check it out but that's objective c uh in terms of how objective c like a project looks like in modern xcode now i'm actually not sure so unfortunately i can't help you with that but there must be objective c resources out there and still there's definitely still people working with objective c so hopefully a google search will turn up something useful for you hey good morning adrian ethan asks chris i got my undergrad in data management going for a graduate in software development any advice in general for students in regards to networking having a linkedin portfolio website so this is actually a really good question because uh i go through well i interview and screen a lot of students for internships here through that university coop program cooperative education i think they call it but essentially these students alternate between four months of school and four months of work placement and us as employers if we hire these students the government heavily subsidizes our costs for hiring the student because they definitely want to help you know it's a government incentive to help students get more work experience so anyways that's so that's why i interview a lot of students through the university and one of the things that i look for i feel like the greatest indicator for success is not actual knowledge about what the job does so i don't look for people with swift ui experience or like a lot of xcode and swift experience i do look for people who have done swift and xcode but like even if it is a small app but what i really look for is the ability to learn and also passion so to put it into more concrete terms um i heavily favor people who list their github accounts on their resumes that i can actually click through and see the projects that they've worked on and it's not like i'm screening their code and looking through it and seeing how they write code but it's just a demonstration to me that this person actually likes to code and likes the program you know versus another applicant that doesn't have a github account or hasn't linked to it right so that's a good indicator for me another one is joining hackathons so i understand that now during covid hackathons are still happening but they're happening virtually and online so on your resume definitely list any hackathons that you've been to that you've participated in uh because those are extracurricular right that's not part of school and it's mandatory and what that shows me as an employer is that you're definitely passionate about this uh about software development and coding and hacking and also the nature of a hackathon is usually that you're trying to figure stuff out in a very short amount of time and so the the more participation that you have in hackathons the more it shows me your ability to learn i mean it's not a perfect indicator but it definitely helps and we've hired about maybe four or five students so far and obviously not all five are working because here now because they have you know they do four months here and then four months of school and then four months at another company and things like that but you know all in all i've i've hired four or five students and they've all been phenomenal so so far so good uh so that's my screening process if that helps yeah again definitely demonstrate uh try to demonstrate ability to learn and passion and interest in that that area having a portfolio website definitely helps having a linkedin profile definitely helps if i can see your face and click through linkedin and i can see your face on your linkedin profile that's definitely better than just you know an empty profile image oh and one funny story is uh don't list anything you wouldn't want your employer to see right i had this one applicant list his instagram account on um on his resume and um when i clicked through to it it had images of him holding guns and he was like this he's holding guns and he was just you know like drinking and this i mean what you do in your personal time is your own thing but i don't think that helps your job prospects you know what i mean so just be a little sensitive about that i mean if someone really wants to dig into your personal life and like look you up on facebook and try to find your instagram account you know i don't think you can stop that but definitely don't make it so easy for them to to find that stuff by putting it on your resume okay let's see any more questions here good morning scott hey call of programming uh what are we doing here today so we are just talking about the code with chris app i was walking through a little bit about the design and i was going to model some of the data that we have in the wireframe but it looks like i haven't really gotten to that just yet and we've had a lot of good questions and i tend to actually talk too much too uh sami asks sir i really start coding from zero what should i do completed my btech this month congratulations and i don't i really don't have a job and i am uh you want to work abroad please guide me so i think one of the easiest ways to start getting some experience is um well this sort of ties into ethan's question up there is that the more stuff you can show on your like github things that you've done the better your job prospects will be right if you want employers to to see and get a taste of what you've done but in terms of like actual employment um there are tons of places where you can freelance and you can sort of get some exposure it might not be like your endall beall thing that you want to do but ultimately you just need your foot in the door like you need someone to give you a chance and if you don't have anything to show it's hard for someone to give you a chance because like i remember when i first started my job i was super nervous and i didn't feel like i was qualified um but i think that you know if you you don't have to be fully qualified like i'm thinking about my own experience i felt like i wasn't qualified but i worked hard in in that job and i you know got up to speed and i um you know figure things out on the job learned on the job and yeah so it really goes back to just you need someone to give you a try whether that is paid or not now i i want to be very careful because i don't want to say that we should work for free like that's not what i'm saying i don't want to be like yeah you should work for free for four months and and get some experience i mean that's a very easy way of getting experience and and having something to put on your resume and that might be the approach that some people take i don't think it's a bad approach but ultimately i think it boils down to um your personal i don't want to say personal values but you know just don't devalue yourself and what you can offer but at the same time realize that you do need to get some proof that you can do stuff and that you can figure stuff out so again just going back to what ethan said that could be attending hackathons right so there you can have fun and you can have something to put on your resume it could be uh what june said earlier about um doing hacker rank and leap code and and those sort of programs if they give you some sort of uh certificate or some sort of ranking that can sort of demonstrate your ability that definitely helps and some students i've seen that don't have any work experience what they put instead are relevant courses that they've taken in school that might be helpful for the job that they're applying to you know that definitely helps uh extracurricular so uh if if i see on someone's resume that in their spare time they've built you know this app or if they've worked on this project that shows me that they've done that out of interest right and out of the coding and development might be something that they like to do in their spare time anyways and to me that is a really strong indicator of someone who is a right fit for a software developer sami no no i'm not i'm not the master in fact you know i struggle with with uh imposter syndrome still if you guys have heard of that right it's that thinking you're not good enough right thinking that you um you know you don't know everything so why should you be here creating a video or live streaming for example but like what i try to keep in mind is that um okay so the the best way to overcome that is just to be honest actually is just to say like i'm here just like you learning and that's why i want to do like group coding and study sessions to keep myself accountable to continue continuing my own learning right and and to code here on live stream to show you guys that i'm not just typing in xcode and building an xcode and staying in xcode 100 of the time um you'll see me going to google going to stackoverflow you know searching out error messages looking at other people's tutorials to implement stuff that i need because you know if you're honest about it then you have nothing to hide and nothing to be ashamed of because we're uh we're all on this learning journey it's just that you know some people are farther ahead some people are farther behind but wherever you are at at that journey you can help the people behind you and that's that's what i firmly believe says i just got a mac and installed xcode just out of curiosity and found it very complicated uh your your teaching has helped me pass through it now i created my own app oh that's so awesome to hear thank you thank you for watching my videos and i'm glad that that those lessons have worked for you uh scott asks do you have a course on how to use figma uh i do actually so but before that we actually have a video we have videos on uh let's see yeah so i've done a couple of figma videos on youtube and as you can see there's there's a bunch of different ones and there's one of me looking very angry here angry thumbnail but in addition to that we have a course on our membership that we're actually working on right now so this one right here and we have an inhouse designer who is teaching the figma portions and i am doing the xcode integration portion so i'm really excited for this course because this designer we i've worked with him for a long time but it was only recently that we hired him into code with chris so he's now a fulltime employee and he he's a great presenter and a great teacher so glad i found him and and just it worked out like that but i'm also excited to show more figma like design to code sort of tutorials on the youtube channel because in the past it was just me doing most of the coding and then throwing together something for a design but now i can actually show that process where you know we go from figma to xcode so you can expect to see more of that sort of content here all right good luck summit work on those uh extracurricular activities and put them on your resume and and get back out there applying the jobs honestly uh a little bit of it is just a numbers game in luck right the more you apply to the more rejections you get you will eventually hit a yes and you'll get your foot in the door and as long as you're a hard worker you know and a smart worker and you can figure things out um that then then your gravy right because after that first job if you do well in it that is your stepping stone to other jobs and that second job will be much easier to find ethan asks when coming up with your own app do you recommend completing the design and user flow before you start building or do you recommend building first so this is a question that i get pretty often and you know if you look at what i'm doing here for these wireframes uh i would definitely say you need at least an idea of what screens you have in your app and what data or what you want to show on each screen before you start now they don't have to be wireframes like this you don't have to you know this is not a design it's just blocks of color on a rectangle to show you where you might put something and how you might arrange something but at least doing this at a bare minimum forces you to think about how to architect your app because without some sort of visual even if that visual is just in your head if you haven't thought about it how are you going to start building the base right of your project so whether that's on pen and paper which to be honest i that's how i do it before we had a designer come on board i just grabbed my notebook i just have a notebook and i just sketch out some screens and it's honestly like very therapeutic and it's really fun because we don't often at least for me i don't often get to work with paper and pencil paper and pen anymore so to me that process is kind of fun roughly sketch out the screens i want what elements will exist in it and then i just jump straight into code i actually don't design it because for me you know as a developer what i only see technical challenges right so when i'm thinking about the app my head is on what are going to be the roadblocks or big obstacles that i have to overcome what do i have to figure out for this app to come to life and that is what i'm focused on i'm focused on solving those technical puzzles um whereas you know with jc our designer he's focused on um how do i make this a great user experience you know and what sort of navigation and the way we present the information what makes sense what makes this like a joyful app to use and i think that because my expertise isn't there i treat that as sort of like an afterthought so i'm not saying that my way is right but just as a developer that's how i approach it as a designer they obviously would go the other way around i think if you were strong in both let's say that you were equally strong in development and design in the ideal world i feel like you would go through design first because you know if you look at what is it the waterfall software development process or life cycle whatever you want to call it this is one way of you know building software and it's basically a sequence of steps that you go through and if you look at this right it's requirements you gather the requirements from the client or from yourself if you're building the app you gather the technical requirements write down everything that your app should do go through design right and this is i think uh it says software architecture here right but i think this would also like before you can architect your app you need to know what you're architecting and what screens there will be so i think this step also involves like visual design as well as like technical design and then implementation and all this so this is the waterfall model um i think that nowadays uh product development is more you know iterative is the more popular approach so you know a lot of people like to use the agile software development but i feel like here you're still you're still going to need to go through like a minimal level of design so i don't know if you guys can see this if i click this it says that should go through requirements design development testing deployment review but you're just doing it in like a tighter smaller chunk so at the end of the day i feel like yeah as a developer you still at least need to rough out some screens in your notebook uh you raj you asked how did you find your purpose and love for coding i fell in love with it in school i had to take a mandatory programming class in grade 10 and instantly sort of just fell in love with it i was trying to build pokemon pokemon was a game that was popular at that time and to be honest i didn't actually even play pokemon on the gameboy i didn't but for some reason i wanted to i wanted to build it because i just learned programming and i wanted to learn and i built a volleyball game and and chess and i sort of just fell in love with it building games because as a kid who doesn't like playing games right so i would play i would build little games and then that's when i decided i wanted to go to university for that beau asks hello chris first time being here i learned about your tutorials because one of my teachers used your tutorials to teach i'm so so happy to hear that i found them very useful and also subscribe to your courses thank you so much and yeah so earlier i was talking about the language that schools use like learning outcomes and there were some other ones like uh pedagogy or something like that anyways we we created documents there was a lot of documents that we created for the purpose of you know being a legit course curriculum provider for schools and we actually got to the point of talking to school boards which is really really cool but what we learned was that school boards there's a lot of like bureaucracy and and red tape they don't like sometimes what courses and what curriculum uh gets chosen like what training materials get chosen is not based on the merit of the material itself and i think this goes with just life in general there's a lot of business relationships uh other motives that drive those decisions um into what they choose to use right money could be exchanged there might be incentives to go with different anyways so we realized that at that time it was just my wife and i ellen working on code with chris so we realized that man we'd really have to dedicate a lot of resources and a lot of time to try to get into schools like that um so we sort of abandoned trying to get our course as a school board wide curriculum for like all classes but however however we have gotten some teachers coming to us wanting to use our foundations course for teaching their class and this is really a happy medium because you know it's not school board wide and that teacher probably has some sort of autonomy on what they want to use to teach and because they've taken some of our lessons maybe they find that our teaching method jives with their class and the way they want to present the class then we we do have a handful maybe about four different classrooms actually in school using this curriculum for their computer science class or their app development class and what was really cool was i actually got to um i got to appear to one of the classes and we did sort of like a zoom thing with all the students and it sort of brought me full circle back to where where i started with my programming journey it was in school that's where i discovered coding and programming so that was really cool in terms of the experience in 2018 your video for creating an app in excel got me coding and since then i've recently come back to finish it that's great that's great i'm so glad to hear that yeah never give up and to be honest i i never knew that i'd still be doing this you know eight years later but i'm so thankful so thankful to all of you guys for learning with me jeff says i created a game with 5 000 lines of code and it's getting hard for debugging and it's almost done but the ui is not very good but it is nice doing it and i can't wait to publish the game on android that's awesome congratulations jeff that's uh that's going to be a huge achievement suny says hey chris i'm a high school student who loves your channel is wondering if you offer a student discount very low budget so actually if you look at the description of this live stream you'll see a special offer uh like a heavily discounted price to join our courses check it out that might fit your budget if not um then we will think about doing some giveaways or some other ways where you can maybe earn uh earn a membership or something like that or win a membership recently we did a cwc stories campaign where i i asked you guys for all of your programming and coding stories like how you got started and we said that anyone who submitted a story will get a free month of cwc plus and i don't know if you you've missed that maybe you didn't see it or anything like that but we are going to feature those stories uh that campaign has ended but if you want to uh also submit let's see where do we go here video peel is the platform that we use if you want to submit a testimonial or a video you know your story if you want to do that we have a yeah i'll paste this url in here let me see what this looks like i'll give you this one so you could record a testimonial right from your browser and basically what we've been doing is anyone who records a video for us we offer them a free month of cwc plus just as a thank you so i'll paste this in the chat just in case anyone wants to go ahead and do this so there's that um but we're about to wrap up the stream here time is time is ending but i'll stream again i think probably next tuesday check out the cwc.to streams if you come here you'll always see the schedule for streams coming up and the links yeah suny okay so in that case it won't work but if you if you want to check out the link in the description of this video if that fits your budget then awesome so check that out um i'll probably stream again next tuesday mondays are a little bit busy and again i think that the types of streams maybe i'll ask you guys i asked you guys what sort of streams do you guys want to see let me just do a poll here let's do a straw poll before i go there's actually a polling feature in stream labs i just have not used it before so okay oh favorite favorite okay because i have to give you some concrete options here so study code work streams what else do we have we have a q a chat hangout streams which is kind of what this stream turned out to be uh presentations this is more of like powerpoint or keynote type of slides types of presentations um you know like powerpoint keynote slide presentation or how about uh yeah so there's like building something on stream that is not prepared so it's like random not like i will probably think about what i want to build but i wouldn't have built it before and so you can sort of see the process of me trying to put it together and that will sort of be the ultimate humbling experience right because um you know you'll get a sense of what uh i think all developers go through is uh the idea in the beginning is very messy and very hazy but then as you work on it more and as you like pull pieces from here pull pieces from there it starts getting a little more concrete are there any other answers here that you guys want to add a build with me so i think a build with me would would be something like this but with this i have to wait for my new mac to come in because what i told you guys before with this mac as soon as i hit compile or build on xcode the cpu it takes up all my cpu and then the stream sort of stutters and buffers and that's not going to be great so i have a new mac coming in it'll probably be closer to the end of june where i can actually stream and build stuff at the same time so let me create this now um i think this is fine or you know what i'm gonna allow multiple choices just so we can get some more answers uh can i just share this with you guys awesome scott i'm so glad to hear that yeah that's what i have coming in here chris do you think the website for swift xcode open when app development comes to ipad um i'm not sure what you mean by that can you rephrase your question jeff we've just got one vote so far we have we have 30 people on the stream or are the results just a little slow coming in all right guys get your answers in like i said i do want to these are definitely on well these are all sort of on my on my radar to do hey suny yeah unfortunately um the discount is for a month unfortunately i can't i can't give a rate like that for uh forever so sorry about that votes are coming in yes okay so there's a clear winner here okay while you guys do that i'm going to do a typing test i'm not a fast typer well i don't feel like i am a fast typer because i watch some other people type and they can type really fast so have you guys ever checked your words per minute or rate of typing rate all right so i'm going to try to try this while you guys get in what you guys guess guess what my words per minute will be on the stream ah start over ah wow guys this is crazy this is my highest yet and this is on stream i thought i'd be so nervous that i'd like choke and seize up but that's crazy i should do these tests more often on stream i just hit a a personal record here but you can you guys can see see my uh what what a nerd i am doing typing tests but yeah this is cool my before my highest was that so today gotta hire one maybe we'll do a few more in the future let's check the results what no study code and work streams you guys these would be like the most chill and relaxing for me i would i could just uh turn on the camera for hours we'll just do like a five hour study code work stream or something like that um but okay i see where your guys heads are at okay but you guys are gonna have to wait until the new mac comes in and we'll build something on stream uh unfortunately i have to go uh but ethan last question very quickly do you recommend learning official ios frameworks versus google firebase or is that more dependent on the jobs you're applying for startups versus legacy applications um i think that there you know there aren't official ios frameworks for everything right so unfortunately you can't use that for everything but in the cases where you can you know you'd definitely like if there is a uh swift ui component that fits my needs i would use it if it doesn't fit my need you could try to extend it or you can try to find like a prebuilt one um but i think first i would look towards apple definitely like in in the past for example i've used realm for local database but then mongodb acquired realm and it really changed everything and so you know if you had built a serious app using realm as your back end uh you'd have to do some crazy modifications but let's say that you opted to use core data instead like let's say both realm and core data fit your needs perfectly and you couldn't you just couldn't decide which one um you know it turns out that sticking with the apple framework would have saved you a ton of work so i feel like if the apple frameworks fits your needs then that might be the way to go but anyways thank you guys so much unfortunately i have to run and have lunch with the family but again i'm so glad to see so many familiar faces come back and the next time i'll streaming i'll be streaming is probably on tuesday so again check out cwc.to slash streams and you'll see this i don't have it up here but i'm going to you'll find the schedule and you'll find the link alright thank you guys so much and we'll do this again next time see you guys
