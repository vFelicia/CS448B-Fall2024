hey guys what's up it's Chris here I don't know if you've heard of Brian Boone from let's build that app but he covers a lot of iOS programming in terms of intermediate level and senior level stuff so definitely check him out if you haven't already well recently he did a video covering his salary history in employment history and I thought that would be very interesting for me to do here on this channel as well but from a slightly different perspective because I live in Toronto Canada whereas he lives in the Silicon Valley so when you hear the numbers that I'm about to share with you do keep in mind that I live in Canada specifically Toronto in the process of reaching a sixfigure salary I also left my job three times so it's interesting how that happened and let me tell you all about it so let me set the stage the year with 2007 I just graduated from university fresh out of school I got hired at a consulting company and let's call it company a because I know there may be some people watching this videos that I've worked with or some previous employers that may not like me actually sharing these details so I'm going to call it company a it was a consulting company about 175 people so it's a fair sized company and for those of you guys who don't know what a consulting company does they basically write software for other people for clients and a lot of the clients you would recognize as Airlines they could be banks they could be in fact this consulting company worked a lot with banks so we built a lot of banking software so during this time it was great because as part of consulting you get to work on a lot of different projects for short amount of time so every 34 months we'd finish a project with client and we'd move on to another client and with each client you go through this process of gathering requirements designing wireframes and you know all the way from prototyping building the software testing it and deploying it and you get to do all that in a span of you know four six months but different time ranges depending on how big the project is also you get to travel a lot so I got to travel to all around the States working with different companies that was a lot of fun especially for someone fresh out of school and travel a lot and most of the times I would travel with one other person or a small team if it was a bigger project and there was one time where actually got to go to Las Vegas and that was by myself so that was a very memorable experience where I had to deploy a piece of software for competing that was going to demo something on stage so it was kind of scary at the same time but kind of exciting and it worked out well I'll tell you guys about that another time so the other thing with consulting is that I got to develop some soft skills not just technical skills being at the keyboard typing and coding I got to work on skills where I would have to speak with clients manage expectations and a lot of the times you're thrown into the fire but if client asks you a question and catches you offguard you have to think on your feet and you have to sound eloquent because otherwise they would kind of lose confidence in you and I guess I forgot to mention that these clients are paying these consulting companies upwards of one hundred and seventyfive dollars or more even but for for my rate I believe it was about one hundred and seventyfive dollars an hour of course I'm not getting paid that much but obviously the consulting company takes a big cut out of that so I really enjoyed my time at the consulting company and when I started working there as a fresh grad I remembered getting through the final interview sitting in the president's office and talking to him and he asked me what are your salary expectations so at the time as a fresh grad 50k was already a great starting salary so I told him 53 to 58 that was the range that I was expecting and I remember that he said to me that's a really odd number why 53 to 58 and I said because that would be more than what my girlfriend was making at the time so that's not career advice for you that's just what I said and when I think back on it it's kind of funny to negotiate it like that and I told my girlfriend about it afterwards and she got a chuckle out of it but when I got hired I started off at 58 so maybe I asked her too little but anyways I learned a ton and I had a great experience there I stayed up this company for two years and in the process I started from you know just a developer to a team lead they promoted really fast I got to lead a team I got to trial on my own I got to I got to speak with clients on my own and I worked with a lot of different technologies as well so this consulting company was primarily a Microsoft shop so initially I worked with csharp and asp.net doing web applications and then we did some desktop applications with WPF which is windows presentations frameworks and it basically allows you to build very fluid very animated desktop applications for PCs and then after that I got to work on my first touch device and it's probably something you guys don't remember or haven't seen actually I would be surprised if you guys have because not many of them made it to consumers hands but it was basically called the Microsoft Surface now let me stop you there it's not the tablet that you know today it is it was this giant coffee table it was a 40 inch touchscreen but it was it was a screen that was embedded in a coffee table if you can imagine that it was a touchscreen so you built apps for it using WPF and I'm going to show a little video of it over my head right now so you can kind of see it in action while I speak but it was really cool because it enabled these experiences that you couldn't imagine before so imagine something like going to a bar and then being able to order off of the table I mean now it might be kind of easy because you can embed there I mean there's touchscreens everywhere but at that time the iPad wasn't out the iPhone wasn't out and you had this giant touchscreen coffee table and the cool thing about it was is that they had these little tags that you can put underneath objects like cups and stuff like that or different products so you can put those products on the table and then it would almost be like the table could sense the object and then tell you about it because the screen would kind of light up around the object and tell you more about it because of that code so there are a lot of cool things that in enabled and there were some shopping experiences that I think we installed at Banana Republic where you can kind of have a model and you can see different pieces of clothing on it in a table environment and a lot of the times we deployed these in lobbies like hotel lobbies and stuff like that anyways that was a really cool experience but needless to say I don't think it really took off because mark Strauss discontinued that product they when they launched the tablets and they called it Microsoft Surface they renamed the table to pixel sense and then now it's completely gone but nonetheless it was really cool next I worked on something called March 12 Silverlight and think of it as the Microsoft version of flash so it enabled rich web experiences and this was huge back then because we didn't have html5 we didn't have you know all of those cool animations going on that enabled with css3 and html5 and stuff like that so flash was really big right and Microsoft Silverlight was kind of a contender to that as well and everything I learned with WPF were in working with surface was actually transferable to Silverlight because so far everything that I've been talking about has been using the programming language C sharp but in addition to C sharp designing the user interface it would be using something called demo which was just XML and the Microsoft Surface uses the WPF for desktop applications use this and so did Silverlight so Silverlight was brand new everyone wanted to learn about it at this time I met someone from Microsoft who was an evangelist for Silverlight and she hooked me up with these two guys in Toronto who has this small consulting company it was just them two and one other students let's call this company B because they're going to play a part in my career soon but anyways I got hooked up with them and we started a Toronto meetup or user group for Silverlight so we would host these meetups after work at different locations downtown and I would speak and I would present and we'd have other presenters and we'd have pizza and prizes and it was a great time by anyways I got to know these two guys and they were working with Microsoft as well and they were doing like really small projects because they were so small one of them was the tech guy one of them was guy and they had to suit it so at this time I've been working at this company a this midsized consulting company for two years I started off at 58 K like I said and by the time I left after two years I was making 68k and I was a team leader by the time I left and the reason I left was because I wanted to start my own business and it is as simple as that I've always been very entrepreneurial and during university I have all of these side businesses and side hustles not all of them tech related maybe I'll tell you guys about that in the future if you're interested let me know in the comments below as you are but anyways I left what most people would call a good thing because I was getting promoted and I was well respected and everything but I decided to leave that to start my own business
