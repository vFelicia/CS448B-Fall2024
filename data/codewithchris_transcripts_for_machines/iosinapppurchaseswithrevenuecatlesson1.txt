in this tutorial series you'll be building this demo which features inapp subscriptions you'll learn how to set up renewable subscription inapp purchases you'll learn how to display those inapp purchases in your app and let users buy them and you'll learn how to programmatically check the user's level of access so that you can unlock the paid content if they've bought the subscription hey code crew i'm chris and welcome to code with chris the place to be if you want to learn how to code and build apps now there's a lot of talk about how difficult and finicky it is to implement inapp purchases in your app and you know what people are right it can be a nightmare and that's why i haven't covered inapp purchases on this channel up until now the folks over at revenue cat reached out and were kind enough to sponsor this video for me to check out their platform to see how they help us implement inapp purchases and you know what i found out using revenue cad it only takes a few lines of code to implement inapp purchases in your app in addition to that it also makes it easy for you to get detailed analytics about how users are interacting with your inapp purchases and to also experiment with different offers so that you can optimize the revenue per user it's such a smooth experience and this is what i want to show you through this app series so here's how we're going to do it step one we're going to set up the accounts that we need and this includes an apple developer program membership as well as a free revenue cad account step 2 we're going to set up our xcode project for the demo we saw earlier and we're going to set up our app store listing through the app store connect portal after that we're going to configure our inapp subscriptions through the app store connect portal i'll show you how to set pricing i'll show you some best practices and tips for configuring your inapp purchases so that you can build your product catalog in the future without it becoming a big mess after that we're going to add our app to the revenue cat platform and we're going to configure our products offers and entitlements and this is where the magic happens it's going to allow us to easily implement inapp purchases in our app even if it spans across multiple platforms and it's going to allow us to mix and match different products with offers and allow us to experiment with which ones work best with our users step five we're going to get down and dirty with xcode and we're actually going to build that demo that you saw earlier after that we're going to add the revenue sdk to our xcode project then we're going to add those couple of code snippets that's going to allow us to pull our offers down to display inapp it's going to allow the user to make purchases and it's going to allow us to check the level of access that the user should have and that's how we know what content to unlock in our app finally i'll show you how to set up some sandbox test user accounts so that you can actually test those inapp purchases in a sandbox environment on an actual device in this lesson we'll get started with steps one and two let's go all right so let's set up the two accounts we need the first one is an apple developer program account now it's not enough to have an apple developer account you need to be enrolled in the apple developer program that you see here and the reason for that is because it's going to allow you to submit apps to the app store and in turn be able to set up app listings and configure inapp purchases for your app if you're not enrolled in the program unfortunately you won't even have access to the portal where you're going to be able to configure those inapp purchases for your app so that's number one number two is you're going to need a free revenue cat account now revenue cat doesn't just make it easier for you to implement inapp purchases into your app but it also has a lot of additional features for you to track your analytics and experiment and mix different products and offers to see which ones convert better and in turn make you more money the best thing about it is that it's free to use until you're making ten thousand dollars per month in revenue and hey if you're at that point you'll definitely have enough money to invest in a tool like revenue cat which is going to in turn make you even more money so to sign up for your free account go to cwc.to revcat now i don't get any compensation for that but it does let the team know that you guys are interested in seeing more content on inapp purchases and app monetization so if you want to see more tutorials in that area then definitely go through that link cwc.to revcat to sign up for your free revenue cat account all right now we're on to step two we're going to create our xcode project and then we're going to jump into the app store connect portal and set up that app store listing in preparation for configuring our inapp purchases so here i've got xcode open i'm going to create a brand new xcode project and i'm going to let me just move that up here i'm going to choose single view app and for this product name i'm going to call it the revcat demo and all of this is going to be the same language as swift user interfaces storyboard for this project and you're not going to be needing any of these options so leave those all unchecked what's really important to note here is this bundle identifier com.code with chris.revcatdemo and this string here is comprised of this information that you have up here that's going to be really important because we're going to need this for our app store listing let's go ahead and click next to create this project and i'm just going to go ahead and save that on my desktop and as you can see here in the project properties this is the bundle identifier that we're going to need the next thing i want you to do is go over to the signing in capabilities tab and just take a look at what you have here you should have it automatically manage signing if you've attached your apple developer account to your xcode preferences and what it's going to do is it's going to generate all of the provisioning profiles app ids and certificates that you need all automatically under this bundle identifier now sometimes it doesn't generate that app id right away but there's one thing that we can do here to sort of get xcode to automatically generate those things straight away click on plus capability here and scroll down all the way to inapp purchases and you can go ahead doubleclick that and add that right here you saw some activity happening there it was generating the app id based on this bundle identifier the provisioning profile and all of that stuff now don't worry if you weren't able to add this capability right now or you weren't able to get this part to work i'll show you later in the portal how you can manually generate that app id and provisioning profiles all right so now with your xcode project set up we have our bundle identifier and we should have our app id what we're going to do is jump into the app store connect portal and this is something you get access to when you enroll in the apple developer program you manage your app store listings here you can look at analytics and how they've been selling you can also submit all of your banking and contract information i mean where's apple going to send your money right all of that sort of stuff and here in users and access you can set up other administrators and also test users which we'll get to in the latter part of this series because we're gonna need to test our inapp purchases and this is where we would set up our test users as well so the first thing we want to do is go into my apps and we're going to set up a new app store listing for the demo that we just created so click on the plus icon up here and choose new app and we're going to select the ios platform and for this name we're going to choose revcat demo let's set the primary language to english i'm going to set it to canada because i'm canadian and for the bundle identifier this is where we want to look for that bundle id that we had set in our xcode project so hit this drop down and see if you can find it see if you can find revenue or whatever you used for me it's this one right here com dot code with chris dot red rev cat demo if you can't find your bundle id in this drop down right here what you're going to need to do is go to the provisioning portal and that's at developer.apple.com account you log in with your apple account that is enrolled in the apple developer program and you're going to see on the left hand side navigation certificates ids and profiles so go ahead and click that and you're going to want to go to identifiers so here you're going to manually add the app id since it hasn't automatically been generated yet by xcode so go ahead and hit this plus icon and register a new app id click continue choose app as the type click continue and in the bundle id here you would basically copy what you have an xcode for this bundle identifier and you would paste it in here and then you would set up some description and under capabilities just double check that inapp purchases is enabled or at least enabled and grayed out you know if that's the case let's see we have to put in some sort of demo here revcatdemo then you would hit continue and you would go through the rest of the wizard to create this or register this app id with this bundle identifier after you do that you go back to this app store connect portal and you're going to have to cancel out of this dialog and just hit refresh on the entire page and then try to add your app again and go through that same process that we just went through set the primary language and your bundle id and app id should show up here now okay so sku is for internal purposes i'm just going to call this rcdemo3 user access we can just leave it as the default right now unless you do have multiple users on your account and you know what to select here let's go ahead and create our new app so once this app store listing has been created now we're going to be able to customize the inapp purchases if you look at the lefthand side navigation you'll see inapp purchases go ahead and click manage all right so here we're going to click this little blue plus icon and you're going to see that there are different types of inapp purchases that we can create in this app series i'm going to show you how to do autorenewable subscriptions but you can see that there are also consumable which are things like potions and magic items that you can buy in games for example or credits things that can be used up nonconsumable are unlockables so things like maybe unlocking a race track in a game that you would indefinitely have access to or unlocking extra levels or unlocking costumes in a game or something like that uh auto renewable subscription is something that you're probably used to it's it's like your netflix subscription or your spotify subscription it just renews every billing period and nonrenewing subscription is the same thing except that at the end of the period it doesn't automatically renew so the next video we're going to go forward with auto renewable subscription and i'll show you how to set these things up all right so far we've completed steps one and two in our outline we've enrolled in the apple developer program and we've set up our free revenue cad account if you haven't done that already go through the link cwc.to revcat to sign up for your free revenue cat account again i'm not going to be compensated in any way if you do that but it is going to allow their team to know that we want to see more content on inapp purchases and app monetization so if that is the case for you then definitely go through that link and sign up for your free account all right now i want to turn it over to you do you want to monetize your app and make money off of it or is it going to be free without monetization let me know by leaving a quick comment below lastly if you like this video please give it a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe so you don't miss the next lesson in the next lesson we're going to configure our inapp subscription products in the app store connect portal alright thanks for watching i'll see you there
