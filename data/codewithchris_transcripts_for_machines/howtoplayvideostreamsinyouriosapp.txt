hey guys welcome to another code with Chris video and in this one we're going to talk about how to easily play some video streams in your app now we're going to go through two ways one is to play a full screen video in another view controller and the next way is to play a kind of like an inline video in your view so let's get started we're going to create a new Xcode project a single view application and we're just going to call this one how about video stream demo I'm just going to save it on my desktop and the first thing you're going to want to do is stay on this project settings screen scroll all the way down to linked frameworks and libraries and click the plus icon and what you're doing here is you're adding additional frameworks to your project which will give you additional functionality depending on what you need by default it doesn't include everything or else you'll have you'll end up with a lot of functionality that you don't need so we're going to search for media and we're going to add the media player framework and just double click that and you're going to see it added to this list that you've got here ok now we're going to go to the storyboard and this is where you're going to customize your view over here on the lower right hand side make sure that you can see this pane if not you've got this button to bring it bring it into view and as well make sure you're looking at this list of elements if you're not make sure you're on this tab the object library and yours might look like this actually this is another view that you can you can do so search for button and this shows up so I'm going to drag that on to my screen and then in the properties the attributes inspector here I'm just going to change that to play and what we want to do is when we click this we're just going to want to launch the video player we're going to move that down here a little bit and now we're going to hook up an event basically the event when someone taps it we're going to hook up that event so we can add up add some code to it so go up here and click this assistant editor button you're going to see two panes now on your left hand side you want to keep the storyboard in view and on the right hand side you want to look at viewcontroller.m and what you're going to want to do is hold down ctrl on your keyboard and then click this button and drag over here in between the at end and the closing curly brace of the of any method so you can put it here or here in fact it actually will let you put it inside a method and I won't let you put it here so it's kind of foolproof proof you're going to want to let go of your mouse button and it's going to pop up a dialog in here we can add a name for the method I'm gonna call this play clicked so this is the method with the code inside that's going to execute when someone taps that button okay now I'm going to switch back to single view and I'm going to go to view controller dot M at the top here I'm going to want to import the media player okay and that's that's the one that we're going to use to play I'm going to open up a pair little pair of curly braces in between the @ interface in that and and this is keep in mind this is still in the dot M file okay I type in MP movie and then you'll see the list populate I want to pick MP movie player view controller and keep in mind there's an MP movie player controller right that this is the in line this is the one you want to use if you're going to play your video in line in your view this is the one you're going to want to use if you want to launch a new like full screen type of view and we're going to go through both so I'm going to start with MP movie player view controller okay so I'm in a player okay so I'm basically declaring a new instance variable to hold the reference to the movie player view controller object that I'm going to create okay and I'm actually going to change the name add an underscore there just to indicate that it's an instance variable and so this variable is going to be available throughout the class in in any method because it is an instance variable okay so down here back and play clicked I'm going to allocate initialize a new MP movie player view controller object and assign it to this variable here I'm actually before I do that because I I know that I'm going to want to pass in a URL during the create during the initialization I'm not going to do this yet first of all I'm going to create an nsurl call it video stream URL equals NSU or URL with string and here we're going to pass in a string that represents the video stream that we want to play so I was I don't have any streams this this video actually came up because I had a question from a member of my video course and he was asking me where to host his videos so he found a solution for Vimeo Vimeo has a pro plan which i think is $200 a year or maybe it's $20.00 a month if you pay monthly and what it allows you to do is upload your own videos but it gives you a streaming URL to those videos that you can you can put in here and you can play your videos through your iOS app so that's what he's going to do I didn't have that so I had to just Google for some streaming URLs that I wanted to test it with so I found this page and I'll probably put this link in the description and I'm just going to take one of these streaming URLs for testing purposes and put it in there okay so now I have my NS URL which I'm going to pass in to the initialization of my MP movie player view controller okay so underscore player equals MP movie player view controller a lot so I'm allocating it and in it with content URL and we'll pass in my video stream URL okay and believe it or not we are very close to being done all we have to do now is the view controller has a method so we're saying self presented and the method is called present movie player view controller animated and all you do is you pass in your movie player view controller object now save it I'm going to run it okay now when I click play this these these lines of code are going to get executed and as you can see it's loaded up the the movie view controller and it's loading this stream and so furthermore if I rotate it you can see that it rotates as well so that's really nice okay now you notice that when I click play it launches it presents a new view controller right so what if I wanted to play that video kind of in line just right there well I can use the other thing I should I kind of mentioned before before we use this example you see how there's MP movie player view controller that's the one we just use so if you use MP movie player controller instead that's the one we can use for inline playing so if we go back down here MP movie player controller a lock and it also has this in it with content URL there's a couple of additional properties we gotta set because the player is going to sit in the view you got specify its frame basically the X&Y origin and its height and width so so the movie player' has a view which we can set the frame on cg rekt make I'm going to put it at 00 and I'm going to set it to the width of this view controller and for height let's say let's say 320 that might actually skew the the movie itself but I'm not sure what aspect ratio the movies act okay so we don't use this present movie player view controller animated anymore instead what we do is we we add this view we add the players view into this view controllers for you so self dot view add sub view player dot view and I'm not sure if we have to actually call play on it let's see what happens I think we do actually so yeah when you click that play button you can see it's put its added the movie players view onto the view but now we have to play the play the stream okay so we call player it's a method play okay so let's give it a run and to run it you either press command R or you can hit this play icon in the upper left okay so when I hit play now it's going to run that code and the movie will actually start playing because the last line of code is to start the movie player and that's how you can play a video in line so you can see it's pretty easy to play video streams and you got a couple of options as well so I hope that gets you started in playing videos in your own apps and if you like this video please give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends and colleagues with the YouTube share buttons and if you're interested in my video course I'm running a contest right now just follow the URL in the description to go to my site and you're going to see a banner at the top okay I'll see you guys next time bye
