hello and welcome to the lesson for exercise now this exercise is meant to be completed after you watch lesson 4 of the beginner series so if you don't know what that is or you haven't watched it up to that point check out the beginner series I highly recommend it by clicking in the upper right corner or checking in the description below I'll link to lesson one alright so what I want you to do is download the assets for this user interface here and start up a new Xcode project and try to put this together I would pause the video at this point and attempt it yourself and if you get stuck or you can't position something correctly then come back to this video because I'm going to show you how to do it right now all right so here I've got a brand new Xcode project and we are going to choose single view app I'm going to name this lesson for exercise solution now after building the war card game user interface I don't think that this would be too hard for you but it's just extra practice that never hurts right so we're going to go into the asset library and we're going to grab all of these assets and put them in now there's only three things to position and plus a bunch of labels so this is probably going to be relatively quick all right so the first thing we're going to do is add an image view by opening up the object library you can also click on icon up there to do that we're going to set this image to be the image of the girl and I'm going to make it I'm not going to constrain to margins and I'm going to make it zero from the top left and right now the reason why I'm hesitating is because I do I do probably want to constrain it to the safe area and we're going to set an image to that guy so click on the image view and then for the image choose the girl you can put her like that except her face looks stretched out so we're gonna change the content mode because by default it's gonna scale it we're just going to say aspect fit and so that's going to set that image view like that and then we are going to let me see if there's anything else I might actually want to do top and instead so it it was bothering me that this tip wasn't reaching to the top there so I'm gonna choose top instead and we're gonna want to add another image view let's just add these first so let's put that right there this is going to be the close button so go ahead and choose close and we're gonna align it to the top and the right so we are going to constrain to margins and we're going to leave it rather to the safe area and gonna say 20 and 20 20 from the top and 20 from the right so our X is right there and then we are going to add our little chat label or chat icon do that and this one's gonna be a little different so why don't we first let's add 20 from the right all right and the bottom is going to be equal to the image so that's what I'm going to say so this one if you enable the bottom here you're not going to be able to select the girl and so what I would recommend doing instead is you can always so here's one way to do it and I don't know if I showed you this exactly I don't think I did but you hold down control and you can click from this chat icon and you can draw a blue line to the girl image and when you let go you're going to be able to specify a constraint relative to that element so I'm going to choose bottom right and what that does let's go check out that constraint so if you have your chat icon click selected go to size inspector go down and you can see this constraint that gets added double click it it's going to bring you that to that constraint so the chat bottom is equal to the girl bottom so they're both aligned in terms of where they end at the bottom what I'm going to do is change this constant to negative 20 and that will like push it up a little bit that's going to say I want the bottom of the chat icon to align with the bottom of the girl image but minus 20 so that's going to bump it up a little bit so that's how that's how you get to do that let's add a label and again that's one way of doing it there's always multiple ways of doing things so let's add a label here and let's add let's give her a name so I think I told her Joana before I don't know if I spelled it exactly like that we're gonna change the font to a custom one and I don't even remember if this was the right font that I chose something like that and we're gonna just put it right there and we're going to do top left and right so the top is gonna be 20 the left is also gonna be whoops I'm editing the height now so when you start editing this checkbox and you click out of it make sure that that's unchecked or else you'll end up adding that constraint by accident and this one on the right hand side of that label I want to make it relative to the close button and I'm going to say 20 so that's just going to stretch out that label however let's see what this is set the horizontal hugging priority so this is what actually we talked about in the lesson 3 exercise so it's basically saying when there's too much space which of the two elements is going to expand to fill up that extra space because there is a property under the size inspector for all of these elements called content hugging priority and we're gonna we're gonna look at the horizontal aspect of it so we're gonna it's basically saying of these two elements that are aligned here if there's too much horizontal space which element is going to expand to fill up that space and of course I would want the name label right because the names can be longer and shorter and so the tricky part is that content hugging means which element is going to not expand so the element with the element with the hi content hugging priority is going to retain its dimensions while the element with the lowest content hugging priority is going to end up expanding so what I actually want to do if I want this close button to maintain its dimensions I want to increase this guy's priority so I'm going to bump it up and you can instantly see that this label now expands to fill up that horizontal space okay so let's add a couple more labels here I'm going to add a label down here and this one is C so we're gonna do left top and right and the top is going to be relative to the girl and let's do a row left is going to be 20 and right is going to be 20 and we're gonna say that this label I like to and we're going to change this font and make this a little bigger all right and then we're going to add another label down here let's say that this one's going to be all four so the top should be relative to the I'd like to meet you label and the left yeah that's fine all the rest is fine actually all right so the top let's say it's ten points from that top one but it's 20 you know 20 from the left right and bottom boom so we have something like that and this label we can make it multiline and then we can also add some text like some sort of I'm just gonna type in gibberish let's see see why it's not truncating here so I've got set vertical content hugging priority okay so same problem as up here except that this time it's on the vertical axis so we're going to say that in terms of all of this stuff this image will probably have the highest vertical hugging priority so at 255 let's say this label is going to be at 253 and this one is going to have the lowest priority because I want I want this guy at the bottom to expand to fill up any remaining space all right so this image is going to maintain the dimensions it has the highest priority at 255 this label is next that's gonna maintain its shape in terms of its second in priority and this guy has the lowest content hugging priority so if there's extra vertical space that's going to be the one that stretches out so there you have it I hope you learned a lot from doing this exercise and I'll see you in the next lesson
