hello and welcome back the mood Tracker app is really coming together and in this Vlog entry I want to give you a demo of it and show you the app icon and the app screenshots as we are Marching closer to the app submission date now just before we dive in just in case you're brand new here this is a raw and unscripted video format where I share our team's journey into building apps for profit all right so this Vlog entry is dated March 22nd 2024 with that said I hope you enjoy this entry hey welcome back so as we're getting closer and closer to April second our Target submission date of this app things are really coming together and there's a lot to see so let me show you the current state of the app so let me just yeah I'll just rerun the app in the simulator and I did a few entries already but when you come into the app this is the screen that you see you're going to be able to scroll and uh take a look at all the entries that you've logged let's take a look at the logging flow so if I hit this green button I can log a new entry so let's say I choose good I choose good to bad and then from here I could go back I can hit cancel but I cannot proceed until I hit to something let's say amused and then I can uh oh I can just decide that's all I want to log or I can continue on to log something more specific so I'm going to say it's freezing now because it's actually snowing outside and then uh I'm going to choose I'm with uh family and I could always add something so this is recording is something that I added just before when I was testing and this is a custom record um actually this should be activity now that I notice it this is a test build so there are things that aren't working 100% just yet you can see here is a preview of your entry how it's going to look so where I am is home and then it's going to prompt me am I done logging say yes and there it is so the other cool thing is that if I scroll if I go back far enough it will then dynamically load or go farther back in time and we should have a button I think there's a button in the design for me to jump back to the current date otherwise I am lost let me show you the calendar so if I hit this calendar icon we can see what the current date is all these little green dots indicate that I have sorry the black circle indicates that I've logged something the Green Dot indicates the current day I can tap on their current day here to jump back to oh I'm not able to tap that but let's say I tap on the 21st so that's another bug that I'm going to have have to log oh it works now or maybe there's something very specific that I have to tap so that's a problem but anyhow tapping a date is supposed to um bring you to that in the entry list and then I'm also supposed to be able to tap on the this thing to add an entry for that day just in case I missed something and I'm supposed to be able to tap on entries uh to edit what I wrote here so it's really cool to see this app coming together just being able to go through that flow and scroll through my entries and seeing this calendar that wasn't something that I was able to test out before so taking a look at the design let's see some of the things that are missing so the settings tab you'll notice that in our current build we don't have a tab bar down here there should be two tabs entries which is what we saw and settings so for settings this is something that I didn't show you in the last Vlog but we just have a couple of different things so rate the app is very important getting those ratings and reviews for a brand new app is very critical so that's the first thing contact support report a problem these are both ways for them to contact us to give us feedback or to report bugs and then about is going to slide up a little about text here so this this is just a placeholder text we're going to actually write something for that and privacy policy will link to the privacy policy and that's basically it we really wanted to keep this straightforward for launch this is what it looks like when you're tapping an entry you're supposed to be able to edit specific things that you chose or delete it Al together and yeah we're getting closer and closer we're getting there I also want to show you the app icon and screenshots because we're getting closer to app submission day wanted to start preparing these things ahead of time so these are the screenshots these are drafts so they're not final but this is what the screenshots would potentially look like app icons we did a couple variations we started with more cartoony feeli little dude there but we realized that nowhere in this app do we see any sort of cartoony figure or personification and so we decided to go more abstract design so also here would be how those different app icons look so we're going to choose one now before we end this Vlog I want to bring up another really cool interview that I watched recently on the app Masters channel that Steve did with Basher Basher sold an app within 12 months for six figures the cool thing is that in this interview he goes through the process that he uses is going from app idea to sale and what he's trying to do at each step in that process the thing that's really interesting to me is that I never really considered building apps to sell it's a new way of thinking for me that maybe hey for making money with apps maybe we should think about selling the App instead of trying to keep it going anyways I would recommend that you give this a watch it was very insightful for me if you are interested in building apps and selling them I'll link it in the description below thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
