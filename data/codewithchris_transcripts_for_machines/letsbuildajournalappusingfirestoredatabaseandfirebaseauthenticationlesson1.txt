hey code crew what's up it's Chris here now this video is a little bit different from our usual videos where you see the backdrop in the back and that frames this is still the same room it's just that I'm not using the computer today because in this lesson I want to tell you about what we're going to be building in this series I realized that I haven't really talked about that all I told you in the previous lesson was that we're going to incorporate firebase authentication with a custom login UI and we're going to use fire store to store our data now those two things are true but I didn't just want to build a demo demonstrating those things I wanted to actually build a fullfledged app something that we could submit to the app store and that way it I think it's a lot more practical and you can also see things from end to end so today I'm gonna be talking about the app idea which we're going to be building now there was such a broad spectrum of things that I could do with only the requirements of authentication in storing data you're saying fire store literally any app that has login and has data so I really had a hard time thinking of an app idea that was not too big in scope and that wasn't too small that it would be too trivial and wouldn't be useful at all I went through a whole bunch of different ideas but every time I did that I just start adding more and more things and I know it would take a lot of time to build and the problem with that it's not that I don't want to show you guys how to build a really complex out it's just that those things would take a pretty long time and there is a high chance that I won't finish it because it's something that I struggle with and that is finishing projects so what I want to train myself to do is to not bite off more than I can chew is to be really specific about the feature set that I want to implement as v1 Minimum Viable Product and submitted to the App Store and get it out there and really go through that process and build up my habit of finishing my projects and shipping it and I think that's not something that's uncommon to a lot of people I think I you know game developers especially I know they have a lot of halffinished games or game prototypes lying around and they're notorious for having to build up this habit of completing their games and shipping it and so I have the same problem here with apps I want to build something that is small enough that I can publish now I can I can tell you some of the ideas that I did have I have this notebook that I just write in some of the time and just whenever I have an idea now the first idea I had was a poll app and that is basically the way I described it here in the book was a crowdsource a decision on you're undecided matters so I know a lot of the time especially if you've got a significant other they'll come to you and ask you oh should I wear this or that with hat and so you know me being so tired of answering those types of questions I'm not so much now but in more so in the past this app would basically allow the user to take two photos of two different decisions post it and have their friends kind of vote on it so that would be the poll part of it and my name that I thought of for that app was this or that so it's basically two simple decisions now I started going kind of out of hand with this because there's so much that you can do with this it might sound like a simple idea but even the notion of being able to add friends then it seems like such a simple feature but you have to think about what that entails right being able to add a friend means that you have to implement the ability to send a friend request and then have the other person accept or reject it it also breaks into what sorts of things do you want to allow other people to see are you is it going to be like a freeforall like just think about Facebook's own privacy settings even even having a friend on Facebook you have closeknit circles and you have you have different different groups I think different privacy settings now I don't use Facebook that much but I I know that they have different privacy settings even within your friends so I think there's a notion of friends and close friends or something like that I might be wrong on that but so anyways that was that idea another one was a Wine Library type of app where you can basically add wines from your wine collection take a photo of the bottle and label and put your tasting notes and all of that stuff on it and it basically just keep track of your collection of wine or maybe wines that you want to try now I'm not a huge wine connoisseur myself but I can see that this app you know I enjoy the glass of wine from time to time and my own difficulty is that I might try a bottle and I really like it but I don't really keep track of it I don't remember I throw I always throw away the bottles I don't keep them and then the next time I want to buy wine I forget what that was and so you know this was something that was going to help me keep track of the ones that I do like that I have enjoyed but I can see this being an app that could be adopted for different purposes maybe collectors who collect different things just as a way for them to keep track of a collection of something you know fun tip at one point I actually collected Starbucks cards now these are the little gift cards that you can get at Starbucks and they have little different designs on them these days they produce so many different designs that I kind of gave up but back then in the early days there weren't as many designs so it definitely was collectible and the cool thing was that every country would have their own designs and their own Starbucks cards and so it was fun getting the cards from like all over the world so that was something that I collected at one point I also considered continuing my Pomodoro timer app now that is definitely something that I want to continue in it for those of you guys who have been watching this channel for a little longer you know that about maybe over six months ago maybe eight months ago I was doing live streams every week where we were going to build an app together and we were gonna submit it to the App Store and we got so far as determining the future set and doing some design work on it but and then an early prototype for working with timers in the background even when your app is off we did some work with that but it was never completed so another testament to my inability to finish projects what I make up for that though is that I won't give up so it's always in the back of my mind and I am definitely gonna come back and finish this project so finally the idea that I did arrive at for this fire store and authentication series is something that I've actually been wanting to do myself and it's something that I've been I wouldn't say struggling I'm not actually actively trying to do this but it's something that I can see the benefits of and that is a daily gratitude journal so you know we have so much to be thankful for no matter what our situation is there's always going to be things that we want the things that we want to achieve or maybe material things that we want in life goals that we haven't hit yet but I think that also oftentimes takes us away from looking at what we do have because there are people who are less fortunate than us who have less than us and they would just love to have just the ability to walk for example someone who might not be in very good health just walking to the bathroom by themselves or maybe being able to enjoy oranges for example someone who has stomach problems we can't take that sort of citric acid that acidity and so I think there are there's a lot for all us to be thankful for things that we kind of take for granted and we don't notice from day to day family right a lot of people have lost loved ones and things like that and sometimes you you just don't know what you have until it's gone right I think that's saying it's so true so this gratitude journal normally that's something that's kind of private I would say but the idea here is a social gratitude journal and the reason I say social is because I think this would be a good experiment because I think in sharing what you're grateful for it makes other people who read that reflect on their life and you know if that's something that they can be grateful for as well and in addition to being able to see what other people are grateful for and you can obviously write your own post you'll only be able to like each other's posts and I use the term like very loosely because I don't know if it's gonna be you know like thumbs up or highfive or something like that but some sort of props and in posting what you're grateful for and then receiving you know thanks or receiving handclaps or highfives for that I think that will also reinforce your good vibes a and also reinforce your want to post again the next day and the idea of the app is to hopefully build up your habit to have a daily habit to think about what you're grateful for so this one I think is a simple app to implement I can see a use for it certainly for myself I think will be the fun experiment to see if to see if people like to do this in a social sort of way versus in a private sort of way so let me go through kind of like a v1 what features I had in mind so obviously we have creating an account and logging in then you'd be able to see a list of posts by other people and then you'd be able to obviously like a post whether that that is thanking or hand clapping remains to be seen you're going to be able to write a new post your own you know what you're grateful for and then we're gonna also have your profile and that's just going to be your username which you can edit maybe some stats like how many times you've posted what's your longest streak how many handclaps or likes or highfives you've received ability to delete your account I think that's important now due to privacy and all that and also to be able to see a list of your own posts and to be able to delete them and finally just a welcomed sort of tutorial screen the minute you create your account just to give you an overview of what the different tabs do how you use the app and what it's for and that sort of thing so that's it like that's the app in its hole and and that's where I want to get it to to be able to publish that into the App Store I do have some v2 ideas such as private only posts so maybe you're posting something sensitive but you still want to write it if you set it to like private only then it's only gonna show up for you like you'll be able to see it in your post feed but then it won't be social and won't other people are not going to see that maybe commenting maybe profile photos push notifications so that when you post something it's gonna notify other people reminder notifications so something that would remind you each day to write what you're grateful for and then maybe just collapsible posts because I'm not planning to complicate it further by allowing you to drill into a post I'm just going to put the full text in the list now if you have more suggestions and ideas for features and v2 ideas please drop me a comment below and let me know I definitely have a lot to think about there's there's a lot more I know that I can do with this for the v1 however I want to make it just that feature set because I think that's the minimum amount of features that's going to make it useful and I want to polish it I want to make it like really really fluid and really nice to use and so that you want to keep using it so that's the idea there I hope that that's something that you're interested in and if not I hope you will even stick around just to figure out how to do some of these features from a technical standpoint because you can definitely adapt what you learn to your own app idea and I think it's going to be really fun for us to get to the end here and then submit the app together I'll show you guys how to write all the metadata create the screenshots write the description submit it from Xcode and it will hopefully get it approved I haven't done any sort of competitor analysis I haven't seen what other gratitude journal apps out there do I haven't thought about how to monetize this app or anything like that the goal isn't really for me to make any money off of it I really just want to build up the habit of finishing my apps publishing them and at the same time being able to teach you guys different features and I think also one more thing is that by making this app shorter I am able to finish it and then move on and create a different app tutorial series for you guys showing a completely different set of features if we were to really just work on this and and do a big complex app it probably take up months and months and then this will be the only thing you guys see on the YouTube channel for like half the year so you know I think that's the other benefit of doing a short feature set anyways I hope you guys enjoyed that if so please give me a like subscribe if you want to see the future videos don't forget to hit that Bell icon so that you know when the next video comes up alright thanks for watching I'll see you guys next time
