hello and welcome to my Swift tutorial for beginners in this lesson you're going to learn all about functions what they are and how to use them now functions are a critical part of the Swift programming language especially if you're going to be building apps with Swift so let's get started all right so I've got a brand new playground here but before we dive into write our first function let's define what they are at the most basic level a function lets you take a block of code and give it a function name and whenever you want to execute that block of code or basically run that code you call that function name so that might seem really simple but the powerful aspect of it is that it lets you organize your code into smaller chunks of code for specific tasks so that way if you want it to perform a specific task you can run that specific function now they can get pretty powerful with the ability to give the function data to have the code take that data work with it and return the result back to you but in this lesson we are just going to take a look at the basic function so let's take a look at how to define a function first so it all starts with the func keyword or F UNC followed by a space and then your function name so you can give your function any sort of name you'd like but you should be descriptive about what that code inside the function does so that when you want to perform that task you know which function to call following the function name you have a pair of parentheses now in the basic function we're not going to have anything in between these parentheses but in the next lesson we're going to learn how to add input parameters and in between those parentheses is where you would specify those parameters for now we're just going to leave it as two parentheses with nothing in between them all right and then next up we have a pair of curly braces and then in between the curly braces is where you would define your code for that function now any code you write in between those curly braces that's going to get executed when you call the function by its name now let's go back to the playground and write a basic function so I'm gonna start on the next line here and I'm going to use the keyword fu NC space followed by my function name now for this one I'm going to call it add two numbers because that's what we're going to do inside that function and I'm gonna put two parentheses like that and next up I would put two curly brackets this is where I would specify the code that I want to run whenever I call add two numbers so why don't we define some constants here let a equals one let B equals two and I'll say let C equals a plus B so C equals three and lastly I'm going to print C now I'm going to run my code right here and let's come on playground alright so now it's run but as you can see there is no console output and the reason why is because this code inside this function doesn't get executed until you call the function by its name so the way you call it is you simply write the function name and sometimes you can even use autocomplete like that followed by the parentheses and if we did define some sort of input parameter here that the function will require when you call that a function you would also have to specify that input data in this lesson for this basic function we don't have to do that all right so let's run this line of code and as you can see in the console it outputs three as expected now let's try another one so I am going to just get rid of that line there so we're not calling the function and I'll call this subtract two numbers I'll say let D equals five let e equals one and let F equals D minus e alright and here I'm going to print F and again nothing is going to happen until I actually call the function right so let's run the project now and as you can see there is four now this might not be immediately obvious to you but using functions is actually a huge time savings because oftentimes when you write your code for your app there are instances where you're going to have to repeat a chunk of code in different places having duplicate code in your project is generally a bad practice and something that you'll want to avoid and so whenever you see yourself having to repeat code writing the same thing that you've written before in another place then think about putting that chunk of code into a function so that you can call it from multiple places now there's one more tricky thing about functions that I want to mention to you and that is the concept of variable scope the idea is that any variables and constants that you define inside of your function they only exist and can be used within the curly brackets of that function so for example here in the add two numbers function we have declared a B and C well outside of my function that would be right here I can't let's say print a write that's gonna trigger in an error use of unresolved identifier and that's just another way of saying that it can't find what a is it doesn't know the same thing for B or C and the reason for this is because we've declared a b and c inside that scope of that function that's where it exists and likewise inside the subtract two numbers function we have de and F I won't be able to access a B or C here either I try and print date it still doesn't know what a is so we're going to get a crash if for some reason you needed your variables to be able to be accessed outside of the functions then you would have to declare these guys outside function now that's just something to keep in mind as you're starting to work with functions for a lot of beginners they run into issues where they're frustrated with not being able to access these variables and constants that they've declared inside their function and now you know why so just to recap you learn about what functions are and how important they are because they allow us to organize our code into executable blocks which we can then call upon to perform specific tasks you've learned how to define a simple function you learn how to call that function so that you can execute the code inside of it and furthermore you learned about the variable scope inside of a function and just to remind you about that if you declare variables or constants inside the curly brackets of your function they are only going to be available inside that function now in the next lesson we're going to build upon what you've learned here and make functions even more powerful if you like this video please give
