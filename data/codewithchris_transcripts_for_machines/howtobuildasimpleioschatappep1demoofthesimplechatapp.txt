hey YouTubers I hope you guys are all doing well in this quick video I just want to show you guys what we'll be building in the next few lessons with parse now this particular demo is actually from my iOS toolbox course uh but we're going to rebuild this demo and instead of using MySQL like this demo does uh we're going to use parse as our backend but this app demonstrates uh using a back end for your app and how you can send and retrieve data across different devices so in this particular demo all you do is you type in a message here and when you hit send it saves that message to the database and then it retrieves the list of new messages so whether you launch this app on another device or you close this app and you uh open it again or you uninstall it and reinstall it um all of these mess mesages will still be there because they're stored in the database and the app actually uh communicates with the backend to retrieve those messages I guess you could call it the beginnings of a chat app and maybe if we have time we'll even style it and make it look a little prettier all right I can't wait to get started with you guys and I'll see you guys in the next lesson bye for now
