hello in this video you're gonna learn about something called an array and before I explain what it is I'm gonna pose a problem to you so that you can understand why we need it let's say that you have a class called deck which represents a deck of playing cards inside this class you want to put the data representing the cards let's say each card is represented by a string like this and in case you didn't know there are 52 cards in a deck of playing cards so if you were to keep track of those 52 strings you might start declaring variables like this well that's gonna get out of hand pretty quickly here's an even bigger problem what if you had to keep track of thousands of people in an employee database you can't just create a variable or constant to keep track of each employee Swift has some collection types that can be used to handle collections of data an array is one of these collection types let's see how we can use an array with our playing cards example rather than declaring a separate variable for each piece of data you can simply declare a single variable to keep track of a single array and the write has slots where you can store data each slot is almost like a mini variable that keeps track of a piece of data each slot is also given an index number starting from 0 to retrieve the data you simply ask the array to return the data at a specific index to keep track of data you can ask the array to use a specific index to keep track of that piece of data just like a variable if an array index is already pointing to a piece of data and you assign another piece of data to that index it's going to track your new piece of data let's stop tracking the old one all right now that you know the basic gist of what and the right is let's go into the playground and see how the Swift syntax looks alright so here we have a fresh playground and I'm going to declare a new array so you can see what the Swift syntax looks like so I'm going to declare a single variable let's just call this my array and I am going to assign to it and right you start by using two angle brackets like that in between those two angle brackets or square brackets you put the slots of your array each slot is separate by a comma so just by doing that I have two slots this first one would be slot zero and this one on the right side of that comma would be slot one so let's put our playing card data in here and instead of saying something like ace of clubs I'm just going to ignore the suit for this example and let's just put a string let's just call it ace right and in index number one I am going to put king so in my array right here I have two slots or two indices and this would be index zero and this would be index one and remember the comma separates the different slots and the two angle brackets indicate the start in the end of the array I can take this further I can do another comma and I can say Queen I can do another comma and I can say jack so now my array has one two three four items so four indices zero one two and three now in order to retrieve my data let's say I wanted to print out Queen the way I would retrieve Queen would be to type my array right because this variable keeps track of there right and I need to ask it for the piece of data in index zero one two and the way we do that is use the angle brackets again and then just simply put in two right there and let me just print that out so we can see it in the console so we get Queen if I put in array index 0 we would get ace now what would happen if I put in index 0 1 2 3 4 there is no item at index 4 in fact there's no slot there so what would happen well it would get a crash and this error message is going to be very common because arrays are very prevalent in different classes and a lot of code and so if you're ever trying to access an item that is outside of the range of that array you're going to get index out of range and that's kind of what it means I just want to demonstrate that all right so let's change this back to zero for now now let's say I wanted to tell index 0 which right now is pointing to this string ace if I wanted to tell that index to track another piece of data well I could say my array and then square bracket 0 and I could assign another piece of data to it let's just say 10 okay and then now let's try printing my array 0 and you can see that the second time I print it the data at index 0 is actually 10 I've changed it using this statement now the cool thing about this is that you can also add items to the array so the array is a class itself it's got different functions and properties if you use dot notation you can use the append function and there are two different ones all right this one will append a complete a sequence which is for example another array or something like that if you want to append a single element then you can use this one so I'm going to pend 9 like that and now the array will actually have 5 items so now when I try to print out my array 4 I am going to get 9 because remember even though there are five items arrays start at 0 so that's why the fifth item is actually at index 4 alright and also I can always use dot notation and access the count property which is going to return the number of elements in my array so I can print out that property and we would get 5 as expected now I mentioned before that each slot of your array is kind of like a mini variable in that each slot keeps track of a separate piece of data another way that arrays are similar to variables is that an array has a data type so just to jog your memory if I declare a variable like this a and I assign to it 10 I cannot assign a string to that variable anymore because once I've assigned ten to it it's treating this variable as an int datatype variable so I can't assign a string type of data to that variable so in the same vein this array stores string objects right here right string datatype i cannot suddenly try to append an integer to that that just won't work so how did my array know that it is supposed to store strings because I didn't specify that anywhere well just like with a variable it can infer the type from the data that you assigned to it so here I've declared this array and I have put in these string values well it's going to assume that it is a string data type a right now one question you may have is what if you want to declare an array but you don't want to put elements in it initially like I have here well you can actually declare an array that is empty at first so let me show you how to do that I'm going to call this second array and let's say that this array also stores strings so you start with two square brackets or angle brackets and in between there we would normally put the elements of our array but instead if we want to do an empty array we are going to declare the datatype that that array should store and then we follow that by using these two rounded brackets now this looks very similar to creating a new object of a class right well that's exactly what you're doing here you are creating a new array object that stores strings so I cannot append say an integer to that and that's just going to cause an error because I've declared up here that this array stores strings so I have to append something like that now once you get used to using this append function to add elements into your array you can actually use a shorthand as well so let me show you that and that is the plus equals operator like that and normally you would use this to increment of an integer variable but in this case you can also use it to add new elements into your array so you cannot do something like this let's say I want to add another string to my array you can't do that you actually have to apply it to another array now this array could simply just store that single element and that would be fine or you could append two elements at a time right so now I've appended tests I've appended my string and another string so if I print out second array dot count it should have three items all right like that so oftentimes you're going to see this sort of notation as well and maybe sometimes it would even just be appending one item you still have to put these angle brackets around it because you have to use that operator and append an array essentially you're taking all the items in this array and appending it to this array right here on the left hand side now before we leave this playground let me just organize this code and add some comments so that you can download this playground and you can take a look at it as well so here we have declaring a race I'm just gonna call this one array one and then I will also have array two and this guy will be an empty string array and this would be accessing elements this will be adding elements so you could either use a pen or if there are already indexes that are existing you can assign one to a different one oh I change the name so all of these are errors now right one I'm cutting the number of items here all right and here's another example of adding elements this guy would be a rate two and you can actually also remove elements so I realized that didn't show you that so you can say array one let's say dot remove so you can actually just remove everything or you can remove the item at a particular index and that will actually shorten the array so if I say array one remove at zero you know I'm removing the first element then print array one dot count is going to be appended a bunch of stuff to it so I have zero one two three and then four I have five elements and then if I remove one then I'm left with four that's correct yeah alright in this lesson you learned about a race and how they can be used to store a collection of values you learned how to declare a race either with data or as empty you learned about how to assign data into an array how to access that data at a specific array index and also how to update the data at a specific index as well finally you learned how to remove data from an array I highly recommend that you download the worksheet below to get some extra practice with working with arrays also if you want to read the documentation for a race from Apple's official language guide I'll link to that below as well if you like this video please subscribe to my channel by
