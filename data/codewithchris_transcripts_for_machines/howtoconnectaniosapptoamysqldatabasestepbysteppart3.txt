a YouTube versus Chris here and in the previous lesson we went through a diagram illustrating how an iOS app can connect to a MySQL database through a PHP web service so starting from this video we're actually going to implement those things the first step is to find somewhere where we can host our MySQL database and web service so the way I chose to do it in this article was to sign up for web hosting which gives you access to upload files so we can upload our web service as well as create MySQL databases now I want to point out that obviously this option is going to cost money because you're signing up for web hosting but there are tons of other options available for instance if you are savvy web developer you probably have set up a local database server before on your machine or a web server and you can host your own files or maybe if you already have an existing MySQL database and you have access to upload files to that server you can use that as well the reason I chose to do it this way is because it goes back to the days when I was learning how to build websites through HTML CSS and JavaScript and stuff like that and I would need to sign up for web hosting to put up my websites publicly from there I explored MySQL and PHP and that was a long time ago when I did any sort of web development like that these days I'm sure there are other options out there but again I haven't done any sort of web development in a long time so if there are any web developers watching this feel free to comment in the comment section below and maybe you can tell us what the best options are these days or maybe some free options to have access to a MySQL database and a place to upload some files so in this article right here step one is to sign up for that web hosting so I'm not going to go through that because I actually already did sign up for this web hosting when I wrote this article so what I'm going to do is skip to step two and show you how to set up the database once you do have access to one and obviously this setting up the database is going to be in the context of the web host that I have if you signed up for a web host as well and it's not Bluehost it may look a little different but most web hosts these days have some sort of cPanel or administrative panel where you can create new databases and also access and admit panel to manage the database if you do want to sign up through Bluehost like I have it feel free to jump through the link in the description below to go to this article and just follow this section one sign up for web hosting and database and I've provided links to Bluehost there and no extra cost to you I'll earn a commission if you decide to sign up through the links that I've provided here for Bluehost so if you do that thank you for your support and it's going to continue to help me provide free high quality tutorials for you guys ok so anyways let's skip step one here let's jump straight to step two setting up the database again this is in the context of the cPanel or control panel for Bluehost but I'm sure you'll be able to find the options in your own web host so this is what the cPanel for Bluehost looks like I'm going to scroll all the way down here to database tools and click on MySQL databases so this is going to list out all of the current databases I have it's going to redirect me here and it's also going to allow me to create new ones so here I can give a new database a name if there's going to be a little prefix here for the database name I've already created one here I've called it sample DB and the full name is iOS quiz 1 underscore sample DB the reason it says iOS quiz 1 is because that's the username that I signed up for for my Bluehost account and the domain is iOS quiz comm so I was in the future I was planning to create some sort of quiz to aid in the learning for iOS programming and so that's why I registered that domain iOS quiz comm okay so what I did here was I created a new database I just typed in sample DB like that and I clicked on create database and that created this guy right here the seconds that we need to do is to create a MySQL user because through that user we query the database we create new rows we delete rows and update and do all sorts of things like that so we do that through a user and in fact the web service that we create will actually use this user account to perform all those operations so what I did here I've already created a user and I called him DV user again there's this prefix here so the full user name would be iOS quiz 1 underscore DB user now you could put anything that you want and I specified a password for it and then I clicked on this button to create a new user and the third step is finally to give access to that user to the sample DB so you can see here that I can select a user I can select a database and I can add that user to the database so when you add a user to a database it's going to ask you what sorts of permissions do you want to give this user towards accessing the database so let me see if I can get back to that screen so that I can show you what that looks like I think maybe if I click here yeah so you're going to see a screen like this and by default all of it would be unchecked right so you're going to have to check off to individual privileges that allows now I'm not sure what the best practices are but just my common sense tells me that I probably should not if this were a production application it should not just willynilly give this user all of the privileges because for example some of these are pretty dangerous I think drop right this is for dropping a table so this user would be able to delete complete tables right this would allow them to create my SQL procedures I think that's what they were called in sequel server Microsoft sequel server but here they might be called routines it's been a while since I've worked with those and here you'd be able to create tables and you'd be able to delete rows and stuff like that so it really depends what you're going to be doing with the web services for example if you're only want to read data from the database to your iPhone app then I would say you just need to select write but however if your iOS app is going to be sending commands and sending data to maybe insert rows or update rows then you might need you know update and insert wherever that is there is so for me in doing this demo I didn't really want to bother with any of that so I just enabled everything but I want to make it clear to you that for demo purposes it may be okay but if you know don't use this for production so later on the series I'm going to take a deeper dive with familiarizing myself with what the best practices are for this sort of thing and I will create some additional videos for these series so you know as to show you guys what you should do but for this demo right now just because I want to quickly get the iOS app reading data from the database I don't want to have to worry about privileges so I just enabled everything when I added this user into this database okay so be careful about that okay so after you've done that you've created a new database you've created a new user you've added the user to the database and use you know enabled the proper permissions for that user to access the database you're good to go we're going to go back now to the control panel and we're going to scroll down all the way to database tools again and I'm sure there's a couple of different maybe administrative panels that you can use from here but the one now I'm familiar with using as PHP myadmin so I go ahead and I click that it's going to bring me into sort of a control panel to manage that database ok so this is what it looks like on this left hand side I have the databases you can see iOS quiz 1 underscore sample DB if I click that it might be confusing if you've never worked with MySQL before now this it might be hard to tell but this is a table a database table in my database it's called locations I didn't have this before so in order to create a new table I just typed in the name here so I typed in locations and I had 4 columns because I was planning to add for the table for each row I needed a location name I needed a location address and then a lot and along so the coordinates representing where that location is so that's why I chose four columns so after you create your table you can actually click into it and then you can add your columns let me see if I can show you that under structure yeah here see I've added a bunch of these columns here so I've added a name address latitude longitude and there's a data type associated with each column as well now I put varchar' and varchar' is kind of like a variable character can be you know letters or numbers or anything like that and this 50 in brackets decided represents the length of that field so it's going to be up to 50 characters long so I put 50 for the name and the address and I put 15 for the coordinates so that's the structure of my locations database table now the next step that I did was I added data to it so you can see here you click browse to browse the data for the table I only have two rows of data one is Apple so the Apple headquarters the address is one Internet loop Cupertino California I don't think they've moved yet or maybe they have so maybe this address wouldn't apply but any case this tutorial was done a while back so this was their address and this was the coordinates for it and this is the Google headquarters so same thing and there's tons of websites out there where you can actually punch in an address and it's going to return to you what the coordinates for that address are so a simple Google query is going to turn up those websites for you you can type in something like get latitude or something like that for address and you're going to see a ton of sites that's that will help you with that okay so that is it for creating the database and populating it with these two rows of data because I did this already I'm sorry I couldn't show you actually step by step but my my tutorial here in step two it has a ton of screenshots and it's going to show you step by step basically how to create that database create that database user then add that user to the database and here you can see how I've enabled all these privileges and then going into phpMyAdmin and creating the table and then creating the columns for it here and then inserting some data into it you can see here really stepbystep instructions there and you can see that we end up in the same place with these two rows of data now in the next step we are going to write the PHP web service to query the database and you're going to see that in the next lesson so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time bye for now you
