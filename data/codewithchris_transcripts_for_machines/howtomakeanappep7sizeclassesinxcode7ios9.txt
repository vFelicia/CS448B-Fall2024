hey guys welcome to lesson seven of how to make iphone apps with no programming experience in the previous lesson we learned how to add an element specifically an image view to the storyboard and also how to position it and how to size it with Auto layout constraints and this is the result that we got the app is running in the simulator in portrait view it's vertically centered and it's 50 points from the left edge and if I go into landscape view it's also vertically centered and it's also 50 points from the left edge now I'm not particularly happy about this because while I think it's perfect in portrait view you see there's just enough space for two cards in landscape view I feel like if the other card was 50 points from the right edge there'd be too much white space in the center so in landscape view I actually want the card this card in particular to be closer to the center I want a bigger margin from the left edge so what can I do about that well that's where size classes comes into play so let's go back into Xcode and I'm going to stop my project here and in the storyboard of your project down here you'll notice WN e and H n E and that stands for any width and any height if you click that you're gonna get this little popup where you can change your size class that you're looking at see and there's a little description about what that size class is what this allows you to do is to add elements and constraints to only a specific size class now by default we are in the any width and any height size class so any elements that we add on to the storyboard or constraints that we add to the storyboard in this size class applies to any screen size so whether that's landscape portrait iPad iPad portrait iPad landscape it's going to use the same set of elements and the same set of rules to position and to size them now I mentioned that in portrait I wanted this constraint right here see the 50point constraint here I thought this was perfect in the iPhone portrait but in landscape I wanted this to be a greater margin so what I can do instead is right now I'm in the any with any height size class I'm going to delete this constraint so let's go ahead you can delete it from here on the document outline and instead I'm gonna change size classes to go into the iPhone portrait so let's drag this around and see what we've got here this is for all I phones in portrait that sounds exactly like what I need so I'm going to choose that and then I'm going to add that fifty point constraint margin here and then after that I'm going to change the size class to the landscape one and I'm going to add another constraint that is specific for landscape orientations and make that margin bigger so the one I'm adding right now is to the compact with regular height size class which is only for portrait so I'm going to click image view I'm gonna go into here this is the pin menu I'm going to uncheck constrain mark to margins I'm going to highlight that left margin I'm gonna say 50/50 is good make sure you click out of it press tab and then you can see that it's 50 with this enabled add one constraint so there we go now if I switch size classes to this one for all compact height layouts iPhones and landscape so this is what I need for landscape you can see that it's it says it's missing a horizontal constraint and then you can see the constraint that we just added is greyed out here in the document outline because this constraint we only added to the portrait size class for iPhones so now I'm going to add another one and click the image view I'm going to uncheck constrain to margins enable that left margin and this time I'm going to say I'm gonna say a hundred and let's add that constraint and as you can see there's a little warning there that what I'm seeing here is not reflective of what the rules are so I'm gonna highlight my image view click resolve click resolve auto layout issues which is this little icon here and update frames for all views in my view controller so now you can see that in landscape view it's going to have a hundred point margin from the left edge so now let's go back to any width in any height now you can see that both of these are disabled or grayed out because I added those specifically to the portrait size class and this one to the landscape size class but let's run it now in our simulator to see what we get okay so this is portrait right here which is that fifty point margin from the left now if I go into landscape you can see that there's a greater margin it's a hundred now let me change back to portrait you see that and landscape it's still actually a little too far away so I'm gonna try and try 150 instead so I'm gonna highlight this one and I'm gonna go here and change that 100 to 150 and now while we're here take a look at this down here for my constraint I can see where it is installed so there's a checkmark next to any width and compact height and this is the landscape size class if I wanted to install this constraint also to the size class which I'm currently looking at which is any within any height I can simply also check that and then now you can see that it is enabled in this any within any height size class and I can uncheck it like that okay so let me run it again and there you go so that looks a bit better that's landscape and that's portrait
