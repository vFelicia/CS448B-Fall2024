hey guys welcome back and if this is your first time here welcome to code with Chris I'm Chris and today we're going to be talking about variable and method scoping and objective C so let's get to it okay so let's get started once again you can download this particular Xcode project in the description or click an annotation on the screen so first I'm going to start off with creating a class and we've seen how to do this in previous video videos I'm just going to create another class called my class and you put it in the root directory and let's look in the interface file so we're going to talk about the different access levels for variables first so if I wanted to declare some instance variables I'd open up a set of curly braces and for example if I wanted to do an integer go something like that and by default this is protected so what that means is that any subclass of my class can access this instance variable and that's the equivalent of typing something like this you know and then I can list out all of my protected variables so by default already by default already any variable I declare without this is protected if I wanted to clear public variables that any class could access then I would go like this public and then there is also private so if you wanted to declare private variables something like that then it would only be accessible to your implementation of that class now let's talk about methods so we saw before that you declare an instance method something like that but what if you wanted a private method so what you can do is in the implementation file you can declare what's called a class extension and it's basically a private interface where you would put your methods and stuff so if you take a look at view controller in this view controller class was created for us by Xcode by default go into view controller m and you'll notice up here that there's no like a stub for a private interface for view controller and this is in the dot M file so we would kind of do the same thing in my Class C class extension line class and if I declared a method in here this method wouldn't be accessible to other classes and also if you wanted to declare you know private instance variables you could also do it in here by opening up a set of curly braces and and declaring it in there as far as I know I don't think there is a difference if you do it in the header file or in this class extension so now let's test out some of this stuff if we go back to view controller dot M I'm going to import my class and then I'm just going to create a new instance of it I'll locate it and initialize it and then I am going to try to access some of the stuff that we talked about so for example if I try to call a method you'll see that we declared in my class dot M we declared a private method and then in the header file we declared an instance method called my method let's change that to my instance method and then in here you can you can see if I class instance ok let's see what's wrong here ok so we've got an incomplete I think we have to fill this in actually so let's return 0 and we'll go back here so now you'll see that you can access my instance method but however let's assign that now however you cannot access my private method so you can see it doesn't even come up in terms of variables we have what did we declare in terms of variables here we have two public variables my int and my bool and my n2 is a private variable and seen here so you can even see from here that my pool and my int are accessible while my n2 is not so there's another way to declare a private method the first way we did it was by declaring a private method in our class extension this private interface here and then we you know the second part to that would be actually implementing that private method in here and saying return one or something like that and I'd be able to this is a void so let's change that to return an integer integer and returns one so in my instance method I could actually call self this instance and access that private method now second way of doing it is I can forgo declaring it up here in the interface at all and just go ahead and implement one and you know I'd be able to use it just the same and then if we go to view controller em I can show you that we wouldn't be able to access either private method click we name that my private method so you can see if we try to do that it would not let us did we call it mine oh we just called it private method and other private method so let's go back yeah so it's the same thing we wouldn't be able to access the private method so as you can see there are many different ways for you to control the scope of your variables and methods but whatever way you choose I would recommend you to be consistent throughout your Xcode project now for your fact of the day did you know that the keyboard on the iPhone the one that slides up when you hit a text box that little keyboard there supports 21 languages so I know typing in English because I'm an englishspeaking person it's pretty good but I'm interested to know for those of you who use your iPhone in a different language if you find that experience just as good or if it's you know let me know if it's very cumbersome because I imagine with you know some of the Asian languages with you know tons of characters that it might be really hard to type out a full sentence or it might take a lot of different keystrokes so let me know in the comments section below you you
