hey code crew what's up it's chris here i hope you've all had a wonderful holiday season and i know i don't do these talking type of videos very often usually it's a tutorial but i wanted to take this opportunity to tell you about some of the things that i've been working on behind the scenes and now most of these things are launched or in progress and i'm really excited to share with you there are actually three things number one is cwc 3.0 or that's just what i call it but essentially it's a website revamp it's a little more than that and i'm really proud of how it turned out i want to walk you through this new experience and number two is the swift ui foundations course this course is in progress it continues off from the 14 day beginner challenge and i want to share what i've been doing in that number three is probably what i'm most excited about and it is an app case study that is currently underway and we just started this week my idea with this is to share behind the scenes and have you guys if you're interested to follow along with that journey as we try to build an app and turn it into a business i think it's going to be very interesting and i'll also share with you my motivations for doing this yeah i won't say too much right now but i'll save that for last all right let's hop on the computer so i can show you all right so let's first talk about the website revamp and it's more than just a style difference we actually migrated learning platforms from teachable to thinkific so we were using teachable before and this is what it looked like we've been using this for very many years it got to a point where we finally decided to change because we kept seeing the same complaints from our users over and over number one was that when they signed up for teachable teachable always prompted them to create a my teachable account or to link up this account to their my teachable account and it just confused the heck out of people to the point where a bunch of people even didn't want to continue after that because of how confusing that signup process was and these are our paying customers right who are signing up to cwc plus second thing is that the way that the courses are laid out doesn't really reflect our app journey that we always talk about there's different stages in the learning process and different courses associated with each step so this grid of courses a lot of people got confused about where to start especially once we started introducing swift ui content as well so people were confused do they start with this or they start with this and yeah i i will give them that it is very confusing so we finally decided to migrate to uh thinkific and this is what it looks like now the thing i like about thinkific is that everything is very customizable you're able to through code and through liquid templates customize every single aspect of the experience and so we decided to make the experience seamless so that it doesn't feel like you're going to another site from codewithchris.com and you can see this is when you're inside and you're on the learning platform and it still feels you know like the same site it was nowhere near the level of customization with teachable so with uh thinkific i'm able to depending on the role of the user uh give them a customized welcome video so whether they are a cbwc plus member or maybe they're just checking out our free courses i'm able to have some quick links up here and then i'm able to more importantly lay out the courses the way i want now this is all custom coding this doesn't come out of the box but i'm able to lay it out so p it's very clear where people start and then what they're supposed to do next and then after they finish the apprentice level courses where what they're supposed to do next from there and this is sort of like a mix and match explore um what interests you at this stage and then finally getting to the pro courses where um you're trying to meet your goals whether that's look for a job or to build a product so we were able to migrate to thinkific and at the same time i decided that with our forum that's running on discourse right now to also use a single signon with our wordpress site so the experience is going to be creating or signing into codewithchris.com and then you're automatically going to be signed into our form and right now that's not the case because we haven't actually performed that that link yet and they'll also be signed into the thinkific instance so i'm going to style the header here by the time you see this video that gets released this will probably be styled and then this will be linked up to the code with chris accounts but it's going to be a sort of unified experience so i'm really proud that we finally got this launched because i've been looking at this since october and i started going like way way out of scope because i started reimagining everything uh i was dabbling around and and trying to redesign our logo and redesign the home page and redesign the the layout of our blog posts and quickly sort of got out of hand and you know i'll talk about the logo a little bit because i feel like that's a little interesting from the get go our logo as you can see um here it's it's hard to read there's some text that's illegible like the width over there it's also hard to put in a circular format as you can see in this tab up here it doesn't really look good in circular format and also as a watermark it's it does also doesn't really work i really love this logo though because it's our first original like og logo so i'm gonna still pay homage to that with this new logo but this one is a little more modern and it's way easier to work with so that's what we ended up going with and i'm going to leave the restyling of the home page and a whole bunch of other pages on our site that i wanted to modify i'll leave that for later anyway so that's the website revamp that is just finishing up next i want to talk about the courses that i'm currently working on inside cwc plus so i just gave myself access to everything and as you can see the welcome video is different for someone who logs in as a cwc plus member this sort of customization wouldn't have been available through teachable so again it's very clear where you start you start here and then you come down here and you're taking these apprentice level courses from foundations to databases to design now foundations continues off where the 14 day beginner challenge leaves off and if i go into this course i just want to tell you a little bit more about what i'm working on the reason why this is actually so interesting to me is because we've had this sort of three course learning path since the beginning and we did it with ui kit here and you know people really had a great experience with this but we've had this for many years and we've basically updated it as apple has come up with new versions of swift and xcode but it wasn't until doing the swift ui version that i was able to completely change it up right reimagine it from the ground up and i was able to incorporate so much feedback from um from the students and from users like yourself so for example some of the things that were improved a lot of people said it was very hard to after they finished the course to refer back to content if they forgot something so we took this opportunity to create topic indexes for lessons so this is really going to help with that in terms of using the course as reference after you've completed it the other thing is that inside the course i noticed that after people finished the course and they were uh going to create their own personal projects that a lot of people were just losing code forgetting where they put it or making a change and breaking their project and not being able to go back and that sort of thing and i realized how crucial of a topic source control is even if you're not working in a team and it's for your personal projects and so i've decided to incorporate that into the foundations course just showing you at a bare minimum how to set up your private repos and how to um commit and push your code even for just your personal projects another thing is that the learning experience from from talking with the students a lot of the learning comes from the actual um doing of the work and that comes to no surprise but sometimes people if not if they don't if they aren't given the opportunity to to practice and do the work then it's less likely that they will on their own right i always said after you watch the lesson you should try it out on your own and i don't think that was enough so in the old ui kit version of the courses i would have some quizzes i would have some exercises scattered throughout the course and people responded really well to that they wanted more of it and so in this version of the course i've made an effort to create a quiz and create challenges for every single lesson and it's not long you know it's not tough but it does give people an opportunity and a reason to make sure that they have the concepts they need to know before they move on and another thing that this helps with is the marketability of the course for classrooms and for you know educational institutes because we tried working with schools with our ui kit courses and we realized that if you want it to be an actual curriculum in a school there has to be a lot more handson work and can't just be like a series of videos that people watch passively and so we had set out to create all of that material after the fact and it was a lot harder to do whereas right now i am creating these quizzes and challenges as we go along and you know the quiz like i said isn't long but i think one of the the main aspects that's good about thinkific is and i don't know why this doesn't exist in teachable but when you answer a quiz question it gives you an opportunity to write a message telling people like why that's right or why that's wrong uh and also giving them like maybe a little summary about why that's the right answer in teachable it's either right or wrong and you don't have the opportunity as an educator to write anything else so i i really like this and i don't know if that's right or wrong because i'm not reading the question but yeah i really like this so i made an effort to fill out sort of an explanation for every single question and the challenges aren't long right but it gives an opportunity for people to to test something out so in short what i'm working on right now modules one two and three are done and released modules four five and six are in development and half of the database course is done and none of the design course is done so if we go back here for a second behind the scenes when i'm not recording and producing youtube tutorials this is what i'm working on um yeah and most of these courses here are are finished now all of them are finished or content is coming out for them um gradually next i want to talk about the app case study which is down here at the pro level but before i do that i want to talk about the motivation for these pro stage courses and what they're all about now when i was reimagining you know code with chris for 2021 i i was really asking myself um you know sort of what why why code with chris right why uh and i think there are so many choices out there especially for you know paid programs or paid courses and stuff like that and i identified the i identified that i wanted to help people get a result so i didn't just want to teach them how to code or show them you know swift ui i wanted to help them reach their goal whatever that might be and make a transformation so when we talked with our students and we talked about talked with members of our audience um the two things the two themes that stood out were a career right so that's freelancer consultant or job as an ios developer and be wanting to build their own app or to build a business or surrounding an app so i wanted to shape this path this app journey as we like to call it as you can come in here having no coding experience right starting right here and if you've taken the 14 day beginner challenge or you've seen these videos on youtube you'll know that it really starts with no coding experience needed so you pick up those skills you expand on those skills based on your interests or what you need for your app or looking for job and then when you get to this stage it's material to help you with either of those two goals now in terms of the career oriented stuff we're going to work on that after the building and app business stuff so this product framework in this three month app case study is really the goal is to help people build their own app or build their own app business so that's the motivation between these two things now in terms of what they are our product framework these are the steps we're going to follow to build a successful app and then the case study is real time we're doing this right now we just started this week is an overtheshoulder look at us attempting to build a successful app business and the reason i'm so excited for this is because this is new territory for me you see in my previous job we built apps for clients and success for us meant that we delivered an app to them on spec on time and on budget and after that whatever happens we weren't accountable for those results but in terms of building a successful app or a successful app business you have to be invested in what happens after you launch the app in fact most of the action happens after you launch the app so that is all new to me so this product framework is really our best guess at this point based on what we know and we're gonna update and iterate on this framework as we prove it out by applying it through this threemonth ab case study our goal in three months is to follow these phases that i've outlined in here and launch an app and get our first customer so we're going to try and do that in three months and based on what happens in here we'll probably be updating and proving or disproving our assumptions in the framework now the reason i bring this up is because the threemonth case study is something that i want anybody to be able to follow along and even though this is part of the cwc plus program i think in here i'm going to share um you know maybe more finer details about what's happening so for example what i have right now since this just started this week um i'm documenting the meetings that we're having the decisions we're making uh what we talked about and so it's very detailed information um you know technical feasibility questions we're asking how we're going to go about answering them action items uh what we're doing from here and i'll share our project management board and so peop you can really get an overtheshoulder look whereas i think on social media and on youtube i'm going to be sharing maybe end of week updates in the video and i'm going to be sharing maybe youtube stories instagram stories and stuff like that on things as they happen throughout the week short clips like that um in either case even if you're not a member of cwc plus you will be able to follow along on this three month app journey and then at the end of three months whether we succeed or fail i think it's gonna be an amazing learning experience for all of us obviously i do hope that we're succeed and i'm gonna try my best because it's going to be an amazing case study if we pull it off and if it goes on to become a fullfledged business it's going to be amazing but even if it's not like i said it's going to be an amazing learning experience so that's what's been going on behind the scenes for the past couple of months i know this isn't the usual type of video that you see on this channel but i hope you enjoyed it nonetheless if you're interested in checking out the thinkific platform and this new learning experience you can simply go to codewithkris.com and click on the try for free link in the upper right corner and create an account and then you'll be into the thinkif dashboard and you can check out all our free courses other than that look forward to the first episode of our three month app case study here on youtube and with that said thanks for watching and i'll catch you guys next time bye for now
