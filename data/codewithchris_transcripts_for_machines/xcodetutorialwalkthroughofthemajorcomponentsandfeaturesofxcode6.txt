hello welcome to this video where I'm going to do a walkthrough of the Xcode user interface and the Xcode right now that you see on the screen is xcode 6.4 so if you're running Xcode 6 6.1 you know any of the Xcode 6 series the interface will look like this and from version to version they don't change that drastically especially with the panel walkthroughs that I'm going to do for you today they have been pretty consistent between versions anyhow let's get started the first thing we're going to look at is this top bar right across the top here you can see with this button that is the button that you will use to run your project and what it does is it compiles your code and opens up the iOS simulator and you can then test out your app in the simulator and here next you can choose the simulator that you want to run it on whether you know it's the actual device if you have one or one of these other simulated environments and here in the middle is just the status and on the right hand top corner there are a couple of buttons to control how the panel's slide in and out which panels you want visible or not invisible so for example this one right here hides or shows the Navigator right so you see that left panel sliding in and out and this Navigator shows you it's got a couple of tabs first of all notice that across here there are a couple of icons but most commonly you'll be looking at this first one and it shows you all the files in your project on the center right here this is where you're going to be editing your code and writing your code on the right hand side this panel is called the inspector in this button right here controls that and this inspector is useful for when you're looking at a specific file for example and you want to see some properties related to that file or for instance if you're left the storyboard we're going to customize the user interface of your app this righthand side this inspector if you're selecting an element on the storyboard so for instance if I select you know I scroll view here and then I go over to inspector on the right hand side there are a couple of tabs as well notice here I can customize the properties for that element now notice that this inspector pane this whole right hand side pane is kind of split into two sections the bottom section actually has a couple more tabs so don't get confused they're most commonly you'll see me on this object library tab where are you going to see all of the different elements that you can add on to the storyboard okay and finally this this section here in the below the code editor is called the debug area and here's the icon to hide or show that and these buttons are useful for working off of a laptop screen well you may not have as much screen real estate you can hide all the panels that you don't need and just work on your code so the debug area is for when you're troubleshooting your code maybe your app crashes when it runs and you're going to see some text here it's also split into two sides in the debug area here you'll see that there's these icons and in future debugging videos we're going to actually dive into using this debug area to troubleshoot your code so I won't get too much into that for this video I just wanted to walk through kind of where all of the panels and controls are so one more thing to note is in the storyboard here you've got this pane right here that lists all of your elements and your view hierarchy and this is called the document outline and to slide it in or out you click this icon here so a lot of people don't notice that there's a little icon here in your storyboard that you can hide or show that and this is very handy to have simply because sometimes when you have elements over laughing each other it's hard to select it with your mouse so you can just click it off of this outline here and also visually you're able to see which elements are children elements of other elements in this storyboard here it's hard to tell sometimes if an element is inside of an another element or if it's sitting on top of it and by looking at this document outline simply because of how it's indented you can see you know what the hierarchy is finally there are a couple of more buttons beside these icons which you used to hide and show with the panes and this is the single edit view or the standard editor which by default you're going to be looking at and then secondly there's something called the assistant editor now when you activate this in your storyboard it's going to show you the the code file that is related to you know this view controller that you're looking at in the storyboard so if I don't have enough space I can just hide the document outline for a second and this is useful for when you're trying to connect your elements to your code file as iboutlet properties you can also furthermore this is this last one is the version editor which I don't find myself using too often but lets you compare two versions of the file so I'm just going to go back to the single edit view here and I'm going to go back to a code file here another useful feature are these arrows right here so if you're jumping from file to file let's say I'm looking at this viewcontroller.swift file and I switch over the card Swift and I want to go back rather than clicking viewcontroller.swift I can just press this back arrow or forward arrow to go you know to to traverse how I was navigating between files and notice here that there's also this breadcrumb which is very handy and it lets you jump from file to file like that okay I think that pretty much wraps it up for a walkthrough of the main pieces of the user interface for Xcode stay tuned for more tips and tricks on how to use Xcode
