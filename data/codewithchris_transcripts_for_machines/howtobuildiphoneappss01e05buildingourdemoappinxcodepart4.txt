now it's not interesting if the dice are the same all the time so why don't we add another statement here you know we can we can do something like you can get another dice roll and instead a sign rolled to to the second eye so now let's run it and see what happens there you go it's different we're still missing one last thing which is the sum the label right here so I'm going to stop it and we had already created this sum label and if you remember we need to add a property to our controller so that we can refer to this label and then in our roll button clicked handler we want to add up these two numbers and display it into that label assign that text to that label so I'm going to go into the header file of the controller and I'm gonna hold down ctrl on my key and click that label the sum label and drag it into my interface to create a property for it so I called it some label now I can go back into the implementation file and down here after I show the two dice I can I can add up the two numbers well let's create the string of text so the number from role plus role to is gonna get assigned to the percentage D and the text will read some is you know whatever the sum is so now we assign that text to our label which we can reference via the property we just created and voila this should work let's run it and there it is so that was a pretty simple app I think it does a good job of showing you the different roles you know for controller the view and the model we used all of them today and if you know you were lost in the objectivec or the Xcode and some of the concepts I might not have explained through the video you can visit my blog code with Chris calm and click this green box and read these first two articles on a primer for objectivec and if you watch the video again I think you'll understand what I'm doing here but I'm going to be following up this video with a new series introducing Objective C so if you prefer to you know learn through video then that's fine those will be coming out and as well as Xcode if you are unfamiliar with the different interfaces I was using and stuff like that you can go to my blog and read article 4 for an introduction to Xcode but I'm gonna be creating a Xcode video series as well and I'm gonna be teaching you guys that through video so so if you guys have any questions at all please leave them in the comments below for the benefit of everyone else and I will be answering questions there also you can download the source code and you can try running this project yourself the source code is in the link in the description and all you need to do is sign up to be a member of code with Kris calm but it's free and it's gonna take you less than a minute to do so I hope that was helpful to you guys and again please let me know what you think in the comments below and I will be responding within the day thanks everyone see you later bye
