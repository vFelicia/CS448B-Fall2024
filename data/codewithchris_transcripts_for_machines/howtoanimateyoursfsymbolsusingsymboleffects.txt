SF symbols already made our lives so much easier by providing ready to use outofthebox icons and now in iOS 17 apple is letting us add effects and animations to them with a single Swift UI modifier with just one line of code you can add effects like these iOS 17 and Mac OS Sonoma introduce a collection of universal animations that can be applied to any symbol image even custom symbols in this video you're going to learn how to do the following five things how to add SF symbols to your app number two how to animate those symbols using symbol effects number three the types of effects that you can do and number four tweaking and customizing the symbol effects just so we're on the same page here is how you add an SF symbol to your app use the Swift UI image component and you use the system name initializer and then you pass in as a string the name of the symbol there you go how do you get the name for the symbol well you can download the SF symbols Mac app which is free you can browse for the symbol that you want and you can copy the name and that's what you put as the string in here so very very easy to use these icons out of the box no need to design anything now apple has a modifier called symbol effect which allows us to add a small effect or animation to the symbol you'll notice that this modifier has a couple of options that you can specify and we're going to go through that in a second but for now let's do a simple pulse animation now you can see it pulsing back and forth let's take a look at the effects that you can do and how to specify them now take a look at this chart on the left hand side going down you'll see the list of effects that you can use out of the box and apply to your SF symbol to get a little animation however these effects can be applied to your SF symbol in different ways and that is what is across the top there's discrete indefinite transition and content transition so discrete is when it happens once so when you trigger the bounce effect it happens once and then it returns back to its normal state next you have indefinite and these effects are applied kind of like a light switch they are either active or they're inactive and when they are active the animation continues to play or hold for example for pulse it can either be discrete meaning that you trigger it once the icon pulses once or you can apply it indefinitely where it continues to pulse until you turn it off if you look carefully some effects can be applied multiple ways whereas some effects like scale can only be applied in the indefinite manner next you have transition this type of effect animates the symbol either into view or out of view and last but not least you have con content transition which is changing from one symbol to another alright now let's jump into xcode and see these things in action and how to apply them all right let's start with bounce first so here's how that looks like you can see that the different parts of the symbol actually move independently so it looks pretty cool and this is a discrete effect so it happens once when you trigger it and how do you apply this effect so here you see that I have my SF symbol it's a WiFi exclamation mark and I applied a scale effect to it so that you can see it more clearly otherwise it would look really small on the simulator and here is the actual symbol effect modifier so I specified that it was a bounce and next you have a second parameter called value and then here you can put something like an INT or a Bool anything that can change because as soon as you change the value of that parameter it will trigger the effect to happen once so you can see that my trigger is in int and when the button trigger is pressed I just increment it and that change in the value is detected and triggers the bounce next let's take a look at Pulse so for this one it can either be discrete or indefinite let's take a look at the discrete version so if I press trigger it will happen once and this is done in the same way as the bounce effect so here is my symbol here is the symbol effect pulse and I specified value trigger so exact same way we looked at the bounce effect when I press it when that value changes you can see here I'm incrementing it when the value changes it happens once the next is indefinite so you can see it keeps going until I turn it off it's kind of like a light switch and now I'll turn it off and it'll stop so how do you apply an indefinite symbol effect and that's down here so here I have the same symbol and I have simple effect pulse but instead of value I specify the is active parameter and here you put a Boolean true is when it is applied so the light switch is on and when I flip this to false the effect will be not applied so here my button simply toggles the Boolean to between true and false so right now it's true now it's false so that is the indefinite type of effect let's take a look at variable color effect this one is probably the coolest one so this can be discrete or indefinite so I tap it once that's the discrete version happens once here's the indefinite version now some symbol effects are cooler than others it really depends on the symbol I noticed with the symbols that have these sort of waves you get this sort of iterative effect whereas a lot of the symbols when you use variable color it sort of just pulses in and out again to apply the effect discreetly use the value parameter in the symbol effect modifier to apply indefinitely use the is active parameter and pass in a Boolean let's take a look at the scale effect now this you can only apply indefinitely so it's either on or off so this one is actually scaled down so you take a look at this one is a little bit interesting here because here is my SF symbol and the effect is scale but you have to specify scale up or down so let's actually change that to dot scale dot up and when I tap on it you can see that it grew a little bit and it will stay that way until I turn the effect off and it'll scale back to its original state so scale down we'll just sort of shrink it like that when it's active so it's scaled down it's inactive so it scales back up and you'll notice that there is an animation between the states which is really really cool now we're going to take a look at appear and this can be either indefinite or transition let's take a look at indefinite first since we are pretty familiar with this we use the is active and we pass in a Boolean so up here is hidden is initially set to false so that's why it's visible let's toggle it so there I just turned it to false and it is hidden okay let's take a look at transition because this one's a little bit different from what we've seen so far so this one is also a Boolean and I have an if statement here that actually completely removes the image symbol if this is hidden so it's actually being removed from the view it's not in the view hierarchy if it is hidden and notice how I don't use the symbol effect modifier for this I use a transition modifier and I pass in the symbol effect and then I specify that it is an appear symbol effect so let's take a look so it's pretty quick but you'll see that when I it comes into view there is an animation of it coming into view and the difference is that this is removed from from The View hierarchy so it doesn't actually take up any space right that's why this text label is Shifting up so this is transitioning in and out of view whereas this one is simply just hiding it it's still there but you just can't see it and there's an animation associated with that so disappear is sort of the same thing I can show you what that looks like if we change the symbol effect to disappear all right so it's really hard to tell to be honest but there is an animation when it disappears and actually later when we take a look at the SF symbols app there's a way to preview all of these symbol effects before you choose to use the symbol so it actually might be easier to preview it there and see if that's what you want before actually writing the code okay let's take a look at replace this is the last one that we're going to go through and this is a Content transition so again it's applied differently as well so here is the symbol and you can see the symbol that I use depends on this Boolean is paused was it which is initially set to false and that's why it's showing the play button but when I tap on this button it's going to toggle that Boolean and then it's going to change it to a different symbol it's going to change it to the pause symbol and it's going to go between play and pause each time I tap on the button here I applied a Content transition modifier with the symbol effect replace so then there is an animation that happens between the two symbols if we didn't have this it would just sort of flip between you see that no animation it just changes instantaneously whereas this one has a little nice animation like that very easy to apply you can also tweak symbol effects like this the best way to experiment with this is actually to download the SF symbols Mac app and on this page you can find the beta for this which is what you're going to have to use at the time of this recording now using that app if you select the icon that you want let's say this one and you go into this tab right here which is the animation tab you can preview the animation so let's take a look at this so that's how it's going to look okay but if you do iterative you can see it looks a little different and if you hit hide you can see it looks very different reversing lets it go backwards cumulative let it's sort of like an additive effect so then once you've customized it the way you want with these options you can choose this button to copy that configuration and then you can go into your xcode project and let's say we're going to apply it to that was the variable color one right so we can apply it variable color iterative hide inactive layers reversing so then that's what it's going to look like now I'll be honest in the dub dub 23 video where I learned this stuff Link in the description below they showed the coolest symbols with the coolest effects in reality most of the symbols don't have such detailed effects however I'm still really happy with how easy it is to just make your UI feel responsive and alive so what do you think about symbol effects will you be using them in your app let me know by leaving a comment below and if you're brand new to app development check out our three hour beginner Master Class where you can learn Swift UI and build your first app no experience required thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
