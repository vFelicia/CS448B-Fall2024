um but I was going to take a break so I talked to one of the cofounders and I told him you know what I really need to take two months off um I don't know if I'm going to come back I told him and you know he said okay he was nice about it he said okay do it because I was one of the more senior people there and um my intention for taking those two months off was to reset myself ask if this was really what I wanted to do and also um give YouTube a chance Believe It or Not by this time I had started my YouTube channel I think I uploaded a handful of videos maybe five or 10 IOS uh programming videos and I wanted to see if I could uh make it a fulltime income um through ad Revenue so I think at that time I might have been making $8 a day or something like that in ad Revenue so um in the two months I I wanted to publish more and try to make it a fulltime job well I couldn't so in 2 months I decided to go back I was refreshed and I decided I was going to climb that kind of climb that ladder at that consulting company and uh make my money like that um through through a good career a good position and so I was doing that I was working I was working at that company uh what I started at 70k and I was slowly making my way up I think I got up to 80k so after I came back I had a cooworker who engaged the Head Hunter and that head hunter found a bank who gave him an offer of 100K so my coworker told me Chris why don't you hook up with this Head Hunter and see what he can get for you as well so I did that and I got something similar and you know what we actually really enjoyed working at that Company B and so I said why don't we take these offers up to the boss and see what he says so that's what we did and we talked to him uh we told them we really like working here but this salary Gap is just too huge right if the market thinks that's what we are worth you know we're only getting paid this much I think at that point I was getting paid 80k I'm not sure what he was getting paid uh but the boss agreed you know to bump us up to 100K and and that was that it was as easy as that so I got to stay at that company doing iOS uh getting paid just got a big salary bump you know and I think I stayed there for about 3 years in that process I watched the company grow from 12 to 70 people and we moved offices three times and also I brought on my wife to work at the same company believe it or not as a project manager so we worked together for a good year and uh it was very interesting but that's a story for another time if you guys want to hear it let me know in the comments below uh so that's where I stayed but during this whole time for that last year out of those three years um you you know how in the 2 months I left I was working on YouTube and all of that so when I came back you know for that year that next year I was continuing to do YouTube I was continuing to publish articles and stuff and little by little you know you guys started watching me and subscribing and so I built a little bit of an audience and what I discovered was that you guys were actually willing to pay to learn iOS and there was actually this one guy who followed one of my tutorials at that point it was kind of like a dice game like a ice rolling game and he posted this Vine which I don't know how much longer Vine is going to exist for but he posted a Vine maybe I'll pull it up for you guys of uh what he built following my tutorials and that satisfaction that I felt um no number of apps that I could build for any client could match that type of satisfaction it's it's a different type of satisfaction and I never knew before why teachers wanted to teach you know but at that point I I knew why it was just this great feeling to me it might sound weird to you but to me um having someone learn programming it felt like I was teaching this little kid to walk um and it made me feel really good so I thought if I could do this fulltime and I could do this for a living you know even if I wouldn't make as much money as I did you know I I would rather do that so that's what I did um and luckily it was okay with my wife I decided that you know I would give myself 8 months we had savings she still had her job and uh we would try this so for eight months I produced more videos produced more articles and did some courses and uh yeah from that point I had enough confidence to continue on so uh thank you thank you guys yeah thank you for watching and thank you for enrolling in my courses and reading my articles and just uh and sharing the code with Chris brand with everyone out there thank you so much because you guys really made this happen so that's kind of the story of my salary history and how code with Chris kind of came to be maybe I'll do a more detailed video of the specifically code with Chris the origin story you know uh in the future but I want to ask you guys now and I hope this whole thing was interesting for you guys I you know I quit a couple of times I worked for three different companies I don't know if that's the norm or not I want to hear from you guys how many companies have you guys worked at uh were they big or were they small and I want to read about your experiences so let me know in the comments below thank you for watching again and I'll see you guys in future videos okay bye for now
