hello and welcome back so the mood Tracker app is finally done and we're doing some internal testing on it so in this Vlog I want to show you the finished product and I want to walk you through how test flight works both from the perspective of a beta tester submitting feedback and from the administration side to see how that feedback comes in but before we dive in just in case you're brand new here this is a raw and unscripted video series where I share the progress that our team is making towards building apps for profit now this Vlog entry is dated April 18th 2024 with that said I hope you enjoy the Vlog hello and welcome back it's Chris here so April 2nd our Target date for submitting the app to the App Store it has come and gone we weren't able to make that date but I do have some good news the app has been finished and we are now going through some internal testing so in this video I want to show you the state of the app how it works I also want to show you on the test flight side maybe you haven't seen how test flight works from the perspect perspective of the developer and how the feedback comes in I want to show you a little bit about that so first let's talk about the app here so when you launch it you're on this entry screen and I think last time I mentioned there should be a button here now it's there the other thing you can do we added the settings very basic just a couple of options here and we have a calendar so this calendar I think this was already working before but perhaps what wasn't working was tapping on a previous St to add an entry so perhaps I can like go back to April 16th it's April 18th today so I will go ahead and add something here maybe I decide that's enough so I can go ahead and do that save and exit and I have an entry here the other thing I can do is I can tap on an entry and I can edit something specific so I can go that Zoom me there and then I can save that specific thing and I can delete entries so that's really good and I can hit this button and log my moer today now that's basically it it's a pretty simple app on its own at least for this iteration now what we've done is created the app listing on the App Store connect if you're not familiar this is the portal where you manage all your apps and you create your app store listing so I just created one I haven't filled out any of the information but what I wanted to do was to use test flight to send out the build to our internal team so that we can start collecting feedback on things to fix now some things that I've identified here and actually want to get your input on as well is so immediately one thing that I don't think we should be able to see our future dates because it doesn't make sense for me to be able to log a date in the future right so I think that we shouldn't see all of these spots for future dates the other thing is I'm not sure about this scroll direction right so which one feels more natural to you and this is a question you can answer in the comments below should the previous dates be on top or on the bottom so I guess let me phrase this another way the most recent day which is today should that be at the very top or at the very bottom of the list now keep this in mind when I hit the calendar now I know I've got this one wrong so I specifically told the team that I wanted the most recent month at the top but when I when I actually started using this I'm like this doesn't really make sense at all because if you follow the dates April 1st and you go all the way to the bottom this month should be the next month so the calendar is wrong already be and that's due to my fault because I told the team to do it this way but now I realize I'm in the wrong so the most recent month should actually be at the bottom right and if you want to go into previous months like you want to go back in time you should be scrolling that down and you should see the previous months at the top so keeping that in mind now if we go back back to the entry screen what do you think we should we follow that same direction so that it's intuitively Mak sense if if that's the case then April 18th should be uh at the bottom and April 17th should be above it so you would scroll like exactly how it is right now except minus the ability to see future dates so it would be something like that perhaps when it's starting off the most recent one would be here but in a list the thing that I'm stuck on is like in a list usually you want the primary one at the top right the the thing that you want to see at the top and you would probably be more interested in the recency so to me in the list it almost seems like the most recent date should be at the top and then the previous dates would be at the trailing at the bottom and you would have to scroll this way to see older dates but then that opposite of how this calendar works so I don't know what's your opinion here the calendar definitely I'm already 100% sure how the calendar should work previous months should be at the top okay but it's this entries list that I'm not quite certain what we should do in which direction we should go some other things that um I identified that we should fix are the filter this is actually like a V2 thing I think I wasn't clear on the fact that this shouldn't be in V1 but here let me show you in test flight how some of the feedback comes in so when I send this out to the team if you've never gone through this test flight process before I add people via email then they get an email inviting them to test this uh beta build then they click the link and they have to install a test flight app on their phone and through that test flight app they can download this beta build that gets installed on the device so when they're using the app actually let me just plug in my phone and I'll show you how this works all right so I've connected my phone let me open up a quick time player and let me open up a new movie recording so I can show you the screen on my phone so I'm going to go screen phone all right there we go let me just move this to the center okay so I am going to open up test flight okay so this is what test flight looks like and as I said when I send out an email to someone so that they can test it they get an invite they launch that they click that link to launch this test flight app if they don't have it I'm sure it'll ask them to install it but then it's going to show up here and the user has the option to accept test so then when they hit install then it will appear on their device l so I'm going to go ahead and launch it and you know what this kind of looks oh maybe the build that I am running on the simulator it looks a little wait no it okay it does look the same so this is what it looks like with no entries so how do I send feedback let me go on my phone and this is how you send feedback so I take a screenshot of something let's say I see something I want to bug or crash or something so there's the screenshot I'm going to tap on the screenshot and then I can mark it up I can like Circle something maybe this is wrong or this is wrong or that's wrong and then I hit the arrow in the upper right and then I can say let us share beta feedback that's what I want to do right there okay and then I can say it can give some details please please fix that's the most undescriptive feedback ever do not submit feedback with that and then what happens is that on the admin side I can see the screenshot from here and I'm sure it'll show up in a second but here's a sample see so JC says we should not not use red for saving because it's not destructive that is very true should not do that it's great feedback other thing we can see are crashes now here's the cool thing inside xcode you can also see this feedback if you go uh to window you go to organizer believe yeah here it is under feedback you can see it here as well so it's really cool so that's where we're at right now we are a little bit behind I think we're getting there and it's really exciting to see the app come together now one thing that I would change in the future and I've been thinking about how this journey has gone for the mot trer app I think I need to tighten the Cycles I think even though this was an MVP it probably is still too many features I think we should have prioritized launching this thing way sooner and maybe not have had as many options as we did such as calendar screen such as having all these different questions to be asked I think oh yeah we should probably get rid of that scroll bar as well so I'm going to share that feedback yeah I think I would tighten up the cycle between having an idea and launching into the store because while we're able to build out a more robust app that had more functionality it did take quite a while to do and in that process I have to admit that there there was a lot of excitement and motivation on my part when I wanted to do this right from the beginning but then as time went on as more and more time went on I started losing more and more of that excitement that I had and I had the luxury of having our team work on this which meant that it would progress no matter how I felt about it but imagine if you are building something yourself or solo Dev your productivity and your progress on the app has a lot to do with your mind and how you're thinking about it and how motivated you are so I think by shortening the Cycles maybe this is a me Thing by shortening the Cycles you can keep that excitement up and launch something and then have the the excitement of it being live on the App Store and having some users download it and give you feedback and having that back and forth that can carry your excitement into doing several iterations to improve the product and add features again this may be a personal thing for me I tend to be a person that jumps from thing to thing I get really excited about something I really want to work on it I just like obsess about it almost but then if I don't want to do something hard for me to get myself to do it and I've learned this about myself so I try to find ways to mitigate that and to use it to my advantage rather than have it derail my projects so that anyways that's a whole other tangent about learning about yourself and trying to turn your weaknesses and the strengths and things like that anyways that's enough for this Vlog thank you so much for watching and sticking around on this journey hopefully the next time I record this we would have done our our internal testing we done that Sprint and then have it finally polished and submitted all right I'll see you in the next vlog
