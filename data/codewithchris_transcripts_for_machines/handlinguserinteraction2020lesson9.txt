hi welcome to lesson 9 this is a fun lesson we're going to make the card images change when we click on the deal button so if you're ready let's jump right in so here I've got our war card game Xcode project I'm looking at the storyboard and I'm going to go ahead and select that left image view now in the attributes inspector on the right hand side I'm gonna go to this image property and I'm just going to change it to a different graphic asset by choosing something different in this dropdown remember that what we're doing here is just an easy visual way to do the same thing that we could do through code so essentially what I'm changing up this image I set I am really just assigning a different graphic asset to the image property of this image view object now let's jump into our view controller and see how we can do that through code just as a reminder we have references to those image view objects right we have the left image view in the right image view I want you to also note that the type you know the class is uiimageview okay that is for displaying images let's jump down to the deal tapped method here let's erase this line and let's access our left image view using dot notation we're going to access the image property so hit dot type image and this is the same image property we were just flipping around in the storyboard you know changing that graphic asset so to do the same thing through code we would just assign you know a different graphic asset to this image property of the image view I want to draw your attention to one thing here on the left hand the column right here we can see the datatype that this property expects so this image property expects you to assign to it a UI image object this is different from UI image view UI image view is a element that displays UI image data and UI image is the data that represents the actual graphic assets so essentially what we have to do here is we have to create a new UI image object and assign it to this image property so let's just do it and you will probably make a lot more sense than me just explaining it like this alright so go ahead hit equals and then we're going to create a brand new UI image object now keep in mind that you have to type it exactly how I have it right here cuz class names lower case and upper case do matter so it needs to be capital u capital i capital i' and then lower case m a GE same thing goes for these property names it has to be lowercase i image so when you're watching me type this stuff out and you're getting errors on your own laptop or a computer make sure that you're typing the right casing for your property names and your class names also another mistake I've seen is that you have to have spaces like proper spacing so make sure that you have a space before and after equal signs because you know this is not the same thing alright so what we've done here is we've created a brand new UI image object and we're assigning it to the image property of the image view however if we do this we're really not going to see anything because this is just an empty UI image object it doesn't actually have any image data to show so the cool thing about this UI image class is that it's got a method where you can create a new UI image object while passing in some input parameter to tell what sort of graphic asset you want it to represent so let me show you let me show you what that is so I'm gonna open up a pair I'm going to open up the first rounded bracket and you can see all of these different functions and scroll down or this one find this one called named right here and we are going to simply use that one here as enter and we're going to be able to specify a graphic asset name now we're going to choose one of the ones in here take a note how you're spelling this if you've just dragged my graphic assets in here then they should be lowercase C with no space in between the D and the number so let's say card five lowercase C a Rd with the number five it has to be exactly like that otherwise it's not going to find that graphic asset we're going to type card five like that so why don't we run our project right now just to see that appear all right so right now it's a three in a tent when I click deal it's going to execute this function here and it's going to set it's going to create a new UI image object grabbing the graphic asset here and then it's going to assign that to the image property of the left image view object which is this guy right here so clicking deal there that turns into a five which is really really cool because that's the first time I think where you wrote code to influence what happens in the user interface so awesome now we're going to do the same thing for the right image view right image view dot image is equal to UI image right and we're gonna just you can actually start typing and it's going to narrow it down for you so you can choose that this time I'm going to choose card I think our upper limit is 14 if I'm not mistaken yeah so we've got up to card 14 all right so I'm gonna run that and this time let me just put the code on the screen here this time when I click on deal we have the ACE on the righthand side and number 5 now if I click on deal again nothing's gonna change because it's always just running the same code right we need to basically randomize these numbers so that every time we click deal we get a different set of cards so let me tell you about how to generate random numbers it's actually quite easy so we're going to declare a new constant let's call this like left number and you know the int data type it's actually got a method called random that we can use right and we can specify a range and we can say the lower range that we have let's see is two and the upper range is 14 so we want to specify a range between 2 to 14 inclusive we're going to go here and we're gonna type dot dot dot 14 no spaces like that and we are going to then print the left number all right now let's do the same thing with right number we're going to randomize another one same thing 2 to 14 and then we're going to print the right number so after you've typed that in let's run our project it's not going to change the images just yet but it is going to print the random numbers to the console just so we can see that we're doing this properly and move this over here so we can see and I click the deal button oops that's still covering it up oh oh right here I've got that little panel hidden so click on this if it's hidden for you there we go you can see different pairs of random numbers generated now the next step is how do we get these numbers into here well all we have to do actually first thing is let's comment these lines out so we're not printing them out into the console and I would also want to point out that when you're calling taking out lines of code like this make sure that you clean it up after when you don't need it anymore so you don't want to leave too much common too code lying around because it can look messy and it's not a good practice to keep okay so remember what we what we learned about inserting variables into strings so it goes back to that instead of five here we want to put left number so I'm going to erase five I'm raised five put back slash open up a pair of rounded brackets and insert left number as a variable right so the string is going to read card and then whatever left number is now I'm gonna do the same thing here you raise 14 backslash put into round the brackets and I'm gonna put right number all right so let's erase these print statements I don't think we need that anymore okay so let's run our project here see if we get the desired result let's go ahead and click on deal so yeah this is really cool now one thing I want to point out is that if you are clicking this you're randomizing the cards and you're seeing some blank space like you're seeing a card that's just completely not there what that means is that it's looking for a graphic asset that doesn't exist in your asset library so maybe you're double check your range make sure that you know you have cards 2 to 14 and make sure that they're named properly and maybe you might be even be missing that graphic asset completely so check you have two three four five six let's check that you have all of them because if you're randomizing and you see an empty card you don't see the image it either means that you don't have the graphic asset here or you've spelled it wrong so that you know when you're trying to create this UI image object it's not finding that graphic asset in your asset library oh hey I can't stop hitting this deal button now in this lesson you learned about how to change the image of a UI image view using Swift code you also learned how to randomize numbers and how to insert variables into a string now how they recommend that you download the recap notes by clicking on that card over there or in the description below and
