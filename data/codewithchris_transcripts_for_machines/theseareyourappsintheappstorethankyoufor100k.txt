hey coke root what's up it's Chris here if you've watched any of my other YouTube videos you'll know that this is usually the wall that I stand in front of and today I think it's time to finally take down this ugly audio foam it used to be a nice maroon light gray kind of color but as you can see over time it hasn't aged well at all so I had this great idea which i think is going to look really cool for the background and what it is I went to Ikea and I bought these photo frames and I thought it would look really cool if I print it off all of the apps that you guys have submitted over time and kind of print off the app icons and put them into the frame and then put them up into the wall so it's going to appear in every single one of the YouTube videos that I create now that being said if for some reason you don't want your app icon shown in the frame no problem just let me know and I'll take it out and on the flipside if you have submitted an app to the App Store and published it and I in some way have helped you to do that please let me know I'd love to feature your app in these frames and they're gonna appear in all of my youtube videos so the thing is I don't think I have enough app icons right now to fill up three or four of these frames however I do have some artwork that I'm also going to put up in the meantime just to fill the wall let me show you that so some of you guys might recognize this as Mancos angle product and basically vector mockups of devices that you can use for like marketing collateral and all that sort of stuff but I decided to print it off and use it as artwork because it really does look very cool and shout out to Mancos design code dot IO courses and the angle product go check it out there you can grab the angle products if you want or sign up for any of his design courses I highly recommend them I've taken them myself all right so why don't we go and cut up the app icons and then put up the frames and take a look at how they look hey guys so what do you think I personally really really like it now there is some reflection off of the windows on the frames but I'm gonna remove the gloss and so that should solve the problem now I think this is really awesome but I know there is one tiny detail that is gonna make this so much better come with me alright so I've got this package and I got it a while back but I've really been waiting to open it so here we go let's see if we can check out what this is here I'm so excited to finally open this guy what check it out it's gonna tear this open I wonder if it's the new one or the old one they did get it a while back in the case is the design on this guy I know it's been a while back but I really been waiting to open this guy Oh check it out I couldn't have done this without you guys thank you so much and I can't wait to put this up took a while to get here couldn't have done it without you guys thanks for all of your love and support through these years and let's keep going let's not stop alright alright guys that is so much better I can't believe that we hit a hundred thousand and we're on our way to two hundred thousand but guys I eventually want to fill up this entire wall with your app icons so I've provided a link in the description below for you to submit your app if you've published an app into the App Store and I've helped you in some way or another please let me know and we can get your app icon up on the wall so I would just want to say thank you guys so much I'm so glad that I can actually show off your work here because it's a testament to all of the hard work and effort that you guys put in you know I can produce these tutorials that I can teach you the basic steps and stuff like that but it really is your persistence perseverance and pushing through that resistance that you can succeed and publish these apps into the App Store and I also want to thank you for all the support and love for subscribing and watching the videos you know that a war right there is a testament to the community that we've all built and all of the work that we've put in so thank you so much I can't wait to continue producing videos and growing our community all right I'll catch you guys later see you next time
