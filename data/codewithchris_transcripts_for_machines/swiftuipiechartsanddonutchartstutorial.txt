in the previous video you'll learn about the different types of Swift UI charts but there was one particular chart that was missing the pie chart it's newly introduced and it's available in iOS 17. let's take a look at how we use it it's important to mention that pie charts and donut charts are only available in iOS 17 or later which means that we have to use xcode 15 or later as of the time of this recording xcode 15 is in beta so that's what we're using today this is the previous charts demo that we did in our last video and here we showed how to do different types of charts like bar charts and line charts and all those things that are currently already available we're going to be using this project because I mean the sample data is already there so in case you didn't see that last video Let's briefly go over what the sample data is so it's a sample sleep data and each sleep data point consists of a day number of hours and the type of sleep it was and then inside the content view just to make things very simple and easy we just declared a static array here of sample data points so we might have you know Monday six hours and then Mondays two hours again for a nap Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday we have three Friday data points for nap and accidental sleep and then Saturday and Sunday seven hours each okay so now let's go ahead and put this sample data into a pie chart step one you have to import the charts framework at the top so here you can see that we've already done that step two go down to the view area where you're going to put your view code and create a new chart view which is also what we've already done so I'm going to go ahead and remove some of this code just to make things a little more clear and yeah let me just remove all of this for now okay and then I am going to comment the bar Mark out okay so this is the chart view right it has an opening bracket and a closing bracket inside the chart view we are going to use a four each to Loop through the data this is that sample sleep data that I just showed you above here and for each data point we are going to decide how we want to display that data point so as you saw in the previous chart tutorial and earlier before I commented this out the type of chart that gets shown all depends on what type of Mark you want to use so there's bar Mark line Mark and you know all those types of marks that we went through in the previous video but to display your data in a pie chart we use what's called a sector Mark so let's go ahead and create a new sector Mark here so you'll notice that the only required parameter that you need is angle back here in bar Mark and actually a lot of the other marks you have to specify in X and A Y because most of those charts have an X and A Y axis right whereas the pie chart only has like each slice of the pie represents one dimension of data so that's why you only have to specify the angle these other parameters we will go through later on in this lesson these are just optional ways to customize uh the how the chart looks so let's go ahead and start the sector Mark and use the angle parameter now the type of data is a plottable value okay so this this is exactly the same as these right here these are plottable values so with a plottable value you have to specify the label and the value so let's go ahead and do that now the label I am going to make each slice of the pie chart represent how many hours of sleep and the overall chart the entire pie chart represents how much sleep I got that week so let's call this hours and the value would be D and I'm going to make the slice of the pie the hours right and it's all one color right now but we will update that real soon now what's important to note here is that I don't actually have to calculate the angle I just have to say this is the data that I want to represent with the pi slice and it will calculate how big that Pi slice should be depending on the total amount of hours and how many hours this particular data point represents so all of that is done automatically so in order to clearly see the slices let's add a foreground style to the sector Mark I'm going to use this one foreground Style by it's like how do we want to differentiate the different slices how do we want to color them so again it's by plottable value and I want to customize it by day so that I can clearly see which day I got the most sleep so D dot day you'll see that we automatically get a legend and let's just put some padding on the chart right now so it looks a little nicer all right there we go so we have the seven pie charts representing the hours of sleep that I got on each day Wednesday looks to have been the best I can get rid of this Barb Mark now and essentially that's how easy it is to create a pie chart but there are some customizations that we can do to it for starters let's add some lines in between each of the pi segments so this is where those other parameters come into play let me just adjust the preview so we can see the code a little better perfect okay so another parameter if you remember was uh angular inset so this one is just a number so if I put one you can see that it breaks everything up by one point or perhaps I could put five if you want like a huge break we'll put one it looks pretty good uh the other thing that you saw is what's called oops added a comma in the wrong place it's called an inner radius and this represents a circle in the middle of the pie chart an empty space where you can turn this pie chart into a donut chart so let's take a look at that the data type is Mark dimension all right so let's just hit Dot and there are a couple of methods that we can use to very easily create one depending on how we want to specify this empty space in the middle so fixed would just be a fixed number oh I have to put a comma oops there we go so 40 would just put an empty circle with um the diameter of 40 60 and so on and so forth what you might want to do instead is to use a ratio because a ratio let's say you know I want the circle in the middle to be 50 percent or maybe ninety percent something like that right but this is how you would create a donut chart one last customization I want to leave you with is Corner radius so you apply this out here and you can make your Pi segments have rounded Corners now that's an exaggeration what I've done here it actually looks like so pudgy but you can just make it more slightly rounded with the corner radius modifier pie charts are so useful and I'm really glad they made it easy to use and easy to add to your view now next week we're going to go back to basics and we're going to show how to use a variety of Swift UI components with the goal of building up a reference library on this channel that you can access whenever you're wondering how to use a particular component in the meantime if you're new to Swift UI checkout our three hour Master Class no experience required meant for beginners by the end of it you'll have built your first app all right thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
