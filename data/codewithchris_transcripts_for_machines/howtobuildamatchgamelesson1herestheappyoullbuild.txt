guys welcome to module three in this module you'll be building this app as you can see it's a huge jump from the war card game but you are ready for it by completing this project you'll learn the following things how to properly structure a project following a proven design pattern so that your code will be easy to maintain in debug how to do animations and to play sound files how'd it incorporate timers into your app how to do a grits tile layout for your view how do you use a critical communication pattern to respond to events that UIKit elements raise this is a common stumbling block for many beginners but it's so crucial because all UI kit elements communicate this way and I'll show you exactly how that works you'll also learn how to show alerts to the user how to debug and fix your own code using Xcode tools and finally how to create and use custom classes in addition to those new skills that you'll be learning you're also going to be reinforcing the skills that you've already learned such as displaying images handling user interaction using arrays and laying out your elements so that they work on multiple screen sizes and orientations lastly by completing this app you're going to have another app to add to your pool of experience so that when it comes time to build your own app you have more experiences to draw from if you're excited to get started on this app like I am let me know by writing heyya in the comment section below now I want to see a bunch of hell yes don't make me look like a fool I'm counting on you guys okay lastly don't forget to subscribe to the code with Kris channel by hitting that red button below and if you don't want to miss a single video hit that Bell icon as well thanks for watching I'll see you guys in the next lesson
