hey guys how's it going it's Chris here in this video I want to talk about a problem that I think a lot of people have myself included and that is trouble with finishing projects you see personally for me I don't know about you but this is how it is for me when I start a new project excitement is high motivation is high and that's what I want to work on the project you know you had all hours of the day but as time goes on if I hit roadblocks maybe something in life comes up I'm starting to loose theme a little bit and forget about my project then it eventually just dies off and ends up as a halffinished project in some folder I keep on my computer and I have like a ton of these folders so that is the way with me in this video I want to share with you guys some tips that I have to combat that and hopefully it's helpful to you guys if you guys suffer from the same problem now number one I think the most important thing especially for beginners is to basically scope out your project properly because a lot of people coming to this thinking they're gonna build this giant great app that everyone's gonna love and then as soon as they get a little bit into it and they start working in Xcode and Swift they start to realize wow it's a lot of work involved and then they have a busy schedule they have a family life and really there's not that much time to get this done and then they start realizing that maybe they can't get it done so my advice for you is to basically take a small core feature scoped version of your project and if you guys have read this book called the Lean Startup by Eric Ries that's basically what I'm talking about there's this concept that he talks about called MVP which is Minimum Viable Product and it basically is like the smallest feature set that you can have for your app where it's still useful and still solves the problem that it sets out to solve because the idea is that you don't want to build this massive giant thing and then no one likes it and you've wasted all this like resource time money effort into it you want to release this small little MVP and feedback on and maybe some people like something and they didn't like another thing you take that feedback and you create like a version too in the new version 3 and as you're creating these iterations your proxy and get better and better and better so that's the way that I think you should approach it as well and that's the way that I approach all of my new projects number 2 is to be specific about your app or your project a lot of people they want to build a social app or they want to build a game like Angry Birds or something that is very hand wavy I know I wave my hands a lot but just be very specific because if you're vague like that you can't do anything with it you said you want to build a social app how do you start working on that what do you start working on but if you say something like my social app will share photos the users will have the ability to take a photo they can apply one of five filters to it so everyone will be like blur filter will be haze or whatever so the more specific you can be about it the more tangible it becomes and the more you have the more you can perform work on it because now you're you're thinking oh I need to figure out how to upload photos so then you go in and research that and work on that okay number three is to set a timeline because as a procrastinator which is what I suffer from I don't know about you you tend to put the things on the back burner that don't have deadlines and you're just dealing with the things that are due first so if your project doesn't have a timeline or a projected date where it needs to be done you're probably gonna push it off indefinitely especially when it comes time where you've lost that motivation and the excitement that's when you really need these other mechanisms to come and help you finish the project when you're excited and you're motivated you don't need a timeline you're you want to work on the project but the timeline the due date comes in handy when you've lost that steam and you just need to get it done number four we're talking about accountability and I find somewhere before I can't remember exactly where that the act of telling people that you're gonna do something is actually bad because when you tell people you're gonna do stuff it feels good to you the person telling that you're announcing in your you know you're you're making all of these promises it feels like you've done something it feels like you've taken a step towards your goal when in reality no work has been done um so I feel like having like one accountability partner or two maybe is really good but if you're just you know wave your hands saying you're gonna do stuff in general I don't think that's gonna get you anywhere so have someone that you know can tell you with brutal honesty maybe your significant other your mom your dad who's not afraid to really lay it on you tell them you're gonna do this and ask them to help keep you accountable okay so number what are we on number five and this is to work on this habit of not finishing projects because that's what this is it's not a character flaw it's not something you're born with I feel like it's a bad habit you've just personally me we've just got into the habit of not finishing what we started if you've read the book called the power of habit by Charles Duhigg they he has a framework and a lot of good techniques to try to turn bad habits around it to good habits into what you want so I highly recommend you give that a read but one of the things that you can do is ties in with that first rule which is to keep your projects scope small is to get all those quick wins by shipping apps so if you have an app idea or a project that is like small enough you can get actually complete it and get done I'd say that's a win you do that again that's the second one you keep doing that and you will get into the new habit of finishing what you started and that will cure the old habit that'll break the old habit so that is number five and you know I'm talking about all of this I hope it really helps you I don't know if you have the same problem but one of the things that I want to do with you guys is to have like a motivational challenge or like you know this this group of us that wants to build apps and wants to actually like get them done where we try to build and ship an app in a month so I'm gonna start a challenge like that this is like a little preview for our next week and it's free to join whoever wants to join I'll put some structure around it but that's something that personally I think will help me and hopefully help you guys whoever struggling with building and shipping apps to actually release apps and not just have halfbaked apps so I'm really looking forward to launching that challenge with you guys and getting some apps built and shipped it together anyways I hope this video has been really helpful for you that these tips will help you if you're struggling with the same problem actually have a question for you and that is do you I struggle with the same problem of not having the motivation to finish the projects that you start let me know in the comment section below and if you are struggling with this same problem let me know if you have your own tips and your own things that you do to help yourself break the habit or let me know if one of the tips that I've given in this video really resonates with you alright so thank you so much for
