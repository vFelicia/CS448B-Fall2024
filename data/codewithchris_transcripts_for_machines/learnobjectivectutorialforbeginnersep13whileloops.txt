hey guys in this episode we're going to learn about while Loops in Objective C which builds upon what you learned last time about for Loops all right let's get started so to follow along you can download this exact X code project in the link down below or the link on the screen there are two Loops that we're going to look at today the first one is the do while loop so it looks like this do some sort of statements while some condition is true so let me show you what that looks like so let's declare an age variable again and then in the do loop I could do something like age ++ and last video uh we talked about h++ means that you're incrementing age by one every time and in my condition I can say do this while age is less than 10 so it's going to keep looping this statement h++ until the value of AG is 10 or greater now the second Loop is almost a reverse of that it's while some condition execute this sort of statements or the set of statements rather so while while some condition execute a bunch of statements so while AG is less than 10 h++ so in this loop it's saying that if the value of age is less than 10 then run this statement and keep doing that until this condition is true now at a first glance the two Loops might seem similar and they are but the difference is that with the do while loop this set of statements will always get executed once before it checks the condition this condition check happens after the set of statements executes once while in this Loop the condition is checked before the loop happens so that's really the main difference so now you know about the while loop and the for Loop you'll find that these two concepts the while uh the while loop and the for Loop exists in many other programming languages not only objective c so in the future if you want to learn other types of programming uh they'll come in handy for your fact to the day did you know that Apple used to be called Apple computer and it was only in 2007 that it removed the word computer from its name and just called itself Apple to reflect that it was also not only doing computers but also uh doing consumer electronics
