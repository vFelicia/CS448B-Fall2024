hey code crew it's chris here and in this video i'm so proud to showcase all of the apps that you guys built for our weather app community challenge if you have no idea what i'm talking about well last month in our code crew forum we issued a challenge to anyone to build a weather app that connects to a weather api and we didn't give any guidelines whatsoever or instructions on what to do all we did was we issued a set of requirements that your app had to fulfill and boy did you guys pull through i think that your apps turned out even better than the sample app that we showed so we had set a time limit for you guys to finish the app just so there was a goal to hit but if you didn't finish or you're still in progress don't worry because that deadline is artificial it was just you know a challenge a time limited challenge you guys should still finish it and kudos for even attempting it because um i hope you guys learned a lot that was really the point of the challenge if you participated in it you still get to receive our special forum badge that we designed just for this challenge so in the forum thread below i'll have the link in the video description you can click there there'll be instructions on how to redeem your forum badge and if it so happens that this is the first time you're hearing about it i'm so sorry i didn't make sure the announcement was more widespread but the good news is that this challenge will be ongoing so you can always attempt it when you're ready uh and earn that forum badge and submit your app video for inclusion the next time we run a challenge which should be about we're hoping may 1st and then your app video can be included in the next community showcase all right without further ado let's roll the app videos so hmm so you
