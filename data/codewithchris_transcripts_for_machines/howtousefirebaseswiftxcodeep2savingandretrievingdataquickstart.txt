hey coders what's up it's Chris here and today we're going to look at a simple example of saving and retrieving data from firebase but before we do that in the last lesson we had integrated the firebase SDK into our Xcode project via cocoa pods and there was actually an error or something I forgot to do in the cocoa pod pod file so I want to show you what that is and because it won't work otherwise so right here I'm looking at my firebase project folder I'm gonna go back into my pod file open it up with my text editor and up here we had forgot to uncomment any of these things what we need to do is uncomment this platform line like that and we also need to uncomment this one because we're using Swift so now you can save the file and we're gonna have to jump into terminal and we're going to have to navigate to our project folder where I'm already at and then we're going to have to pod update ok so now that that's done we can jump back into our project folder and open up the XC workspace alright so let's go back into the quick start which we were following right here and so we had done the cocoa pod setup and this is how we're going to write some data first of all we have to create a reference to our firebase database and so we're gonna grab this line right here so this creates a reference to our database I'm just going to put it in the viewdidload method for now and we have to change this URL here to our specific firebase app so if I go back into my account by default there's this first one right here I'm going to click on it manage app that's going to bring us to our dashboard and so you can see here that our data is going to be right here and this part is actually the part that I need or you can grab it from the URL up here so I'm just gonna grab that part and that needs to go in here and you can see that this is kind of just a mirror of what's up here in your address bar for your down bored okay and let's go back to the quick start and now we're just going to write a sample value into our database right now Xcode is complaining that firebase isn't a valid class because we haven't imported it up here like that let's press command B to build the project just to make sure that everything is running all right that looks good but what I also want to do is I just also want to add the reading data code so in this example of reading data is actually pretty cool because what's happening here is that it's going to retrieve the data but it's also going to listen for any changes to that piece of data and so what's going to happen is that with this block of code that we're specifying right here whenever the value changes or that piece of data changes this block of code is going to run so that works really well for things like a chat application or anything that you need to listen for changes you don't have to keep checking the database if there's fresh data so I'm just going to copy this part as well make sure that you're looking at the swift part because you can also choose Objective C for the code I'm just gonna add this right under here so there's gonna be any error here it should be print instead but other than that it's going to work perfectly so now I'm going to press command R to run it and we're going to see that it's gonna record this value into our database and then it's going to also retrieve it from the database and it's going to print it into the console so you can see that here so nil is the key and this is the value because when we save the data we didn't actually set a key for it and that's why the key is nil let's jump into our dashboard right now just to see the data and here you can see the value that we added now you might be wondering this looks kind of strange right where are my tables where are my classes if you're coming from the parse side which we spent you know a couple of weeks looking at the way that firebase stores the data is very very different where parse was a relational database meaning that it had different tables or record types for example you might have customers recordtype where has all your customers and then you have maybe another table with products or something like that and then there's a relationship between customers and products while firebase is a non relational database and it's very very important to understand the difference and how to structure your data optimally there are no concept of tables or record types or anything like that instead with firebase all your data is in a giant JSON tree so there's this document here that describes how your data is stored and it's very very important to understand the differences between this new data structure and nonrelational data structure versus what we're used to in parse when I first started working with databases it was with MySQL and Microsoft sequel server and then with parse so everything has kind of been table based and relational and so it's been a mental shift for me as well to understand how to structure data in nonrelational database such as firebase before we move forward with saving and retrieving data I think it's important that we spend a couple of lessons looking at all of the thoughts and considerations that we have to think about in terms of structuring our data if you want a head start you can read this document here understanding data and also this one right here structuring your data and if not well in the next few lessons I'll be going over these two documents with you and distilling the key points into a couple of videos for you guys so that's it for this video I hope you guys have a great weekend and I'll see you guys next week talk to you guys later bye you
