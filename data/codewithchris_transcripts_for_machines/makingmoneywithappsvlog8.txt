hello and welcome back so Sprint 4 is underway and we're 4 weeks away from submitting our app to the App Store we've laid a lot of the ground workor some of the screens are up and running and I want to show you our progress in this Vlog but before we get there just in case you're brand new to this series this is a raw and unscripted video format where I share our behind thescenes journey of our team trying to build apps for profit so this Vlog entry is dated March 6th 2024 with that said I hope you enjoy this one hello and welcome back so we just finished Sprint 3 which was mostly about laying out the groundwork so that we could work on the UI and the screens let me play some broll in the background so you have something to look at while I talk now there was some UI work done in this Sprint such as the entry screen the calendar and some of the initial mood logging screens and but it was mostly about setting up the data model the relationships between the different entities the queries that we're going to need and then wrapping that all up in a data service so that each of the screens can use that data service to get data and the reason why we were still able to set up some of the UI as you saw earlier was mostly due to the early proof of Concepts that we did before we even started the Sprints so we did some some Discovery work around the calendar and around things like the tags which I think in the design world are actually called chips and these These are those little bubbles where you select the motions they're called chips because we worked on those separately in a different project we were able to then Port that functionality into this project when it came time to actually build the app let me bring you back to the app design for a moment because I want to talk about the fact that there are not that many unique screens right we have the entry screen which we saw is was designed I don't know about the cards I don't think those specifically are built yet but it is a kind of a simple list we have the calendar screen which you saw in the development meeting and we also have this mood logging flow so the first step of the mood logging looks a little different it's kind of a simple screen but subsequently there are about six more steps or five more steps that the user can do to log more detail if they would like but each of those five steps uses the same sort of UI so this can be built once and it can be reused over and over so as you can see there's maybe like three or four unique screens here that we're really talking about so now that we've laid the plumbing for powering the data for these screens it should be relatively simple I know that's really dangerous to say right should be relatively simple to set up the rest of the screens now the other thing I want to talk about was a big decision was that as a team we decided to launch this app or submit it rather submit this app by the end of the month specifically on April 2nd now the real reason for setting that date is because I need the team back for some other work but I realized that in setting a date it creates some urgency and I think will be more productive from it now looking at how much runway we have left which is about 4 weeks we have two sprints to go so Sprint four is underway and then we'll have Sprint five and because of that shortened Runway I asked the team if we could still launch with the same feature set not launch but submit the app by April 2nd can we still submit the app with the same feature set and we identified that we probably need to cut out this profile tab because this hasn't even been defined yet there's no design for it there's no requirements for it so we decided to change the profile tab here into a settings tab that is something that we're going to need anyways which contains links to things like submitting feedback reporting bugs looking at the privacy policy visiting the developer website and things like that so that's one of my action items to Define that screen and what's exactly involved and it'll probably be a simple screen that looks something like this another thing I have to do now that the app submission is imminent is to prepare things like the App Store screenshots the app icon description text this is for the code with Chris app and things like that so that's another task that I have to do all in all I'm really excited to submit this by the end of the month and we will see if we can get there I'm hoping testing and QA will be quick and painless and of course if something big comes up we'll probably have to address it and fix it but seeing as how the uh functionality is not that complex and heavy hopefully it'll go smoothly so fingers crossed thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next one
