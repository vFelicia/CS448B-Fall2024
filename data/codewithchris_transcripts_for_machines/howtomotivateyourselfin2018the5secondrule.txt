hey guys what's up it's Chris here today I want to talk to you about motivation I don't know if you've felt this way before but I certainly have and that's that feeling that you have all of these great ideas you have all of these things you want to accomplish but you just can't get yourself to go and do it for instance last night after eating dinner after putting the kids to bed and after cleaning the kitchen I had two options I could a get ahead on my content or be sit down on the couch and watch true detective well you can guess what I did I'm on season two by the way and I can also tell you that I have a folder on my hard drive full of unfinished halfbaked halfdone projects and I remember for every single one of those projects when I thought of the idea when I planned out that app I was so excited I was so motivated but while working on them things always come up you know and for one reason or another they all sit there as abandoned projects now and the reason why I want to talk to you about this today is because I know a lot of you guys out there are probably struggling with learning iOS and trust me I know how hard it is to learn something new I've tried to learn piano guitar a whole bunch of other things multiple times but you know I know that you need a lot of practice I know what it takes to get there to the destination but when push comes to shove and you actually have to do the work that's the hard part right so recently I came across a woman named Mel Robbins I actually just randomly saw her video on YouTube and I watched her talk and it was super inspiring and she tells us about this method which you can use to get yourself to do the things that are hard to do and I tried it a couple of times and it works so that's why I want to share with you at least I worked for me so maybe it worked for you as well so she says that a motivation is crap it's never there when you need it it's not enough to count on motivation to get you to do the things that you know you need to do and number 2 we all know the steps we need to take in order to get to the destination because you can find everything on the now and everything is just a Google search away so whatever you want to learn type it into Google and chances are you're gonna get a list of steps or some books that are gonna help or some courses so we all know the steps that we need to take to get there third it's natural to feel this way because anything you want to do that's going to make you feel uncomfortable anxious it's out of your comfort zone and you hesitate to do it your mind perceives that as a threat and it's basically survival instincts kicking in and your mind is going to come up with a million reasons to stop you from doing it that's why it's so hard to go to the gym or to eat healthy if those things are not they don't come natural to you I mean trying to force yourself to do it you hesitate and your mind convinces you not to do it and you end up not doing it so the technique she describes it's called the fivesecond rule and it's very simple and she even says it sounds stupid and it'll probably sound stupid to you but I tried it a couple of times and actually got me off my butt to do what I didn't want to do so here it is basically when it comes time to make a decision to do something that you don't want to do and you hesitate you have about five seconds before your brain is just going to convince you not to do it and you're just not going to do it so what you do in that instant when you recognize that's what's happening you count down words from five you go five four three two one and then when you get to one you spring into action and you go and do what you didn't want it to so the reason why this works is because for me at least what I felt happening was when I started counting from five downwards it interrupted my thinking about all of the reasons why I didn't want to do this it's gonna be so hard it's gonna take so much time I'm not going to be able to do this or do that and you know it's just interrupted all of that stopped that and then as I was counting down towards one I just felt like an invisible hand was pushing me towards the edge of the cliff and when I counted to one I just got up and I went to go do it and the thing is once you get started it's never as bad as you think right you just need to have that momentum right it's just like this big snowball on the top of the hill once you push it momentum takes over and then the snowball rolls so once you just get past that point of not wanting to do it and once you're in motion and in action I think momentum just takes over and then you just end up doing you just end up continue doing what you originally procrastinated and didn't want to do I'm going to link to her talk in the description below so you guys can go and watch it if you're interested now I want to answer the question I post you guys about two videos ago about how much my Costco haul cost and a lot of you guys were way way way off so I'm coming grab the receipt let me show you guys that's five hundred and twenty dollars and that's Canadian dollars so you can just do the currency conversion for for your own currency and see how far off you were but yeah five hundred and twenty bucks I could have bought a brand new Mac Mini for that price and it would have been a big chunk towards the new iPhone 10 which I am thinking about getting now when I turn it over to you guys and ask you guys a new question how many times have you tried to learn Swift or try to learn how to build iOS apps let me know by commenting below and I'll see you guys next time thanks for watching
