hello welcome to learn Swift for beginners lesson 9 in this video you're going to be introduced to classes which is an absolutely critical part of the Swift programming language if you're going to be using it to build apps I'll tell you all about it let's get started so I'm going to start off with a hypothetical example so let's say you have something like a blog post which you would like to represent we might have something like a variable here for blog title alright blog title can be hello playground I don't know what kind of article that would be but we would have another variable for the blog body and this is the you know text of the article or the blog post and then we might have something like blog author which in this case let's just put my name here so you can see here this is the data for one blog post now let's say I had two blog posts what what would I do in this case I might have another set of variables down here and of course I can't have the same variable names so let's just append two to these these variable names and let's say this is I don't know this article is good by playground okay now this is what I have for two blog articles now what if I had ten what if I had a hundred how many variables would I have then it it'd be a ton right it would be a mess there needs to be a better way to represent a blog post to kind of group these variables together and there is in fact that's what the class is you know how you learned about the different data types back in lesson two you learned about the string data type you learned about the int data type float double boolean all of those are data types to represent different types of data right well with classes you can define your own custom data type so what we're going to do here is we're going to create our custom data type called blog post for example you can do that with classes let's take a look at the syntax for declaring a new class so first of all you have the class keyword next you have the name of the class and this is going to be the name of your datatype then you follow by two curly brackets and inside those two curly brackets is your cost definition let's take a look at this back in our playground so for example up here let's create and define our class so first I would use the cross keyword and then I would create a name of the datatype or the name of the class in this case let's put blog post and notice that this time I'm starting off with a capital letter in fact all of the data types in Swift start off with a capital letter so we should follow the same convention always start off your class names with the capital letter and that's different from what we've been doing with variables and constants and functions okay then I have these two curly brackets like that what do I put inside of my blog post class well why don't we put this stuff right here I'm just going to cut it and I'm going to paste it inside here and then I'm going to delete this right here and I am going to delete this text inside these variables inside my class and leave them empty and I'm going to explain why in a second okay so just like that we've defined a class called blog post and this class has three properties now a property is just a variable declaration like this but inside a class it's called a property you're going to see why in a second why makes more sense and because this blog title blog body blog author is inside of blog post it's kind of redundant to name them like this so I'm just going to name them title body and author like that okay so this this represents our blog post right here now that used to find what a blog post is let's create an actual blog post because remember this class definition right here this is just a definition of a data type you're defining what a blog post data type is right so that's not an actual blog post just like how this is a string that's not the definition of a string that's an actual string so in order to create an actual blog post we're going to type in the class name followed by two rounded brackets like that and just like that this is a new instance of the blog post type and it's called an object or blog post object so when you define a new class using the class keyword that's what's known as a class definition or just class but when you create actual instances of that class those are called objects you can think of your class definition as a template or a blueprint and you use that template to create actual tangible blog post objects so let's jump back to the playground here this is a very important concept to understand we've defined a class called blog post here it's got these three properties or you can think of them as attributes of a blog post and then down here like this we've created a new blog post object now this blog post object has a title it has a body and has an author but all of it all of them are empty right now so what we're going to do is we're going to assign this blog post object into a constant let's call it my post like that so what we've done here is we've created a new blog post object we've assigned it to my post and now why don't we try setting the title of this blog post and the body and the author what we would do is say my post right that's referring to this new object and then we press dot and that lets us access those properties which we've defined in the class definition set the title to I don't know hello playground I think that's what we had before let's set the author of this one and let's set the body to hello okay just hello now if I print my post dot author I would get my name now let me show you something else we can create a second instance of blog post or a second blog post object and let's call this my second post and we're going to set this to a new blog post object like that and we're going to say my second post title equals goodbye playground and can set the author to someone else let's say John Travolta I don't know why that suddenly popped into my head and let's just do hello again now this is a second my post object this is different from my post these are completely two different blog post objects both of them contain these three properties which we consent because that's what we've defined here in this class now another very cool thing about classes is that you can put functions in them and you can see how all of the lessons so far are coming together let's create a new property for this first let's say a number of comments equals zero this is the number of comments in the blog post and we're going to define a new function in this blog post class we're going to say add comment okay and we're not going to worry about the comment text just yet let's just define this so notice that in my function definition I have these two curly brackets again inside here this is going to be my function code so inside this function I am just going to increase the number of comments by one this is all stuff that you should have learned already in the previous lessons now okay so now every single blog post object is going to have this function now how do we access it we simply go my post dot you can see now in the autocomplete that there is this function called add comment and it doesn't have any return value it doesn't return anything so the return type is void right there let's call this function okay see what happens so add comment you can't visibly see what happens but let's print my post dot number of comments you can see that it's one okay now let's print my second post dot number of comments what would you expect just to print out it prints out zero why because we haven't called the add comment function on my second post we just did that with the first post each of these blog post objects maintains its own properties changing the properties of one object does not affect the other even though they're cut from the same cloth right there both types of blog post there are two independent entities and they maintain their properties separately now there's a lot more to classes but fundamentally I want you to understand what they are so I'm not going to make this video any longer than it needs to be I just to introduce classes to you I hope you can see why classes are a fundamental building block to organize your information in the next video we're going to explore classes further so thanks for watching please give this video a thumbs up if it helped you and please subscribe for more thanks for watching I'll see you in the next lesson bye for now
