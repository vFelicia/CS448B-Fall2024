hey guys what's up it's Chris here I just wanted to tell you what's coming down the pipe this month on this channel and why you should tune in so I've gotten comments from you guys like this one that you guys want to progress in difficulty and that's something that I want to deliver on right after we lay down some groundwork now there are some foundational knowledge videos that I need to create so that when we build the more complex apps together I can refer people back to those videos things such as how to install cocoa pods what is JSON how do you parse JSON what our API is that sort of stuff and I've already created some of these videos already so you know we're a good way into that but in addition to those videos I want to also cover some design related stuff so how to work with figma and Adobe XD because I really want to show in these upcoming app series how to build an app from end to end and that includes kind of design and prototyping and all the way to you know testing and triaging bugs and fixing and releasing and that sort of stuff and plus in my previous video about designing an app in figma i asked you guys if you wanted to see a basics tutorial with figma and a lot of you guys said yes so I want to make good on that promise as well so what's motivating me to create more app series and lay on the complexity is because right now on the channel there is kind of a pretty big problem I think right now a lot of people follow my work hard game tutorial series and that's great but it's not immediately obvious what comes next after that if you visit my youtube channel page you will see that right under the war card game there's like a part two and then there's a part three and some people actually see that and they follow all three parts now my original intention after that was that if the person was able to learn something and they liked the way I teach that they would go check out my paid courses and training on my website now I did that before because my sole source of income was from those courses and I needed to make this work as a fulltime job but now at this point the courses are no longer my only income I mean there's ad revenue from YouTube and you might have noticed I've also started doing some sponsorships in my videos so thank you guys for your support that's been able to generate source of income as well so now I don't have to rely on just the courses and I don't have to push those courses as hard so my plan is to create more app series showing how to build apps from end to end and piling on the complexity so that when someone watches the wor card game after that they can go on to the next app and go on to the next app where will increase the complexity with each app and will teach new things and there will be a learning progression here on YouTube so I think that's really really cool so that's pretty much what's coming down the pipe this month and probably into the next month as well but I do want to do one of these update videos at the beginning of every month because I think it's a great way for us to chat informally so anyways I hope you stick around because I'm so excited to be releasing new app series here on YouTube and to make sure you don't miss any of it subscribe to the channel if you haven't already and if you have thank you so much I really appreciate it I'll see you guys next time
