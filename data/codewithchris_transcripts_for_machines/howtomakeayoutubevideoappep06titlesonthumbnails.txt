hey coders what's up it's Chris and I'm here with episode 6 of how to make a youtube video app in the previous lesson we had gone through downloading the video thumbnail for our videos and displaying them in the cells of the UI tableview in this lesson we're going to display the labels so as you can see here we have a variable called video title or a constant rather because the let keyword is used and we've got the video title for the video that the tableview is asking for and right now we're not doing anything with it so Xcode is giving us a warning here so let's go ahead and go into our storyboard and add a label to our cell so down here I'm gonna search for UI label that and I'm just gonna drag it into here our cell in the content view right here in the document outline make sure that your label is on top of your image view which means that it's actually underneath it in this document outline because otherwise if it's like this then the image view will be covering the label so you want to make sure that it's like that next we're gonna add some constraints to the label so make sure your label is click to go down here click this guy uncheck constrain to margins and I'm gonna do left right and bottom so I want to anchor it I want to give it a left margin because if you do zero then the text is gonna start right at the edge of the label so I'm going to put 20 and on the right side 20 so it matches and on the bottom I'm going to put 0 and as for height oops make sure that that doesn't change on you so Presi row tab I'm gonna add a high constraint as well and for this guy I'm going to put 80 just to eyeball it and then I'm gonna press tab again and add these four constraints now let's update frames so we can see our label is there okay and in order to access it from the cell for Rohit in path method we're gonna give this guy a tag but it has to be a different tag than our image view so remember if I click the image view we can see that the tag is one we're gonna retrieve the label with a tag of by default zero I'm gonna put two okay so now let's jump back to the view controller so we've got our video title here in the cell for row at index path method and we're not doing anything with it so let's go ahead and write some comments get the label for the prototype cell or just right cell so let label equals cell view with tag and we pass in two and now we got a tell Xcode it's a label so we're gonna use as exclamation mark UI label and now we're simply going to set the text property of that label so label dot text equals video title now let's run it and see what we get okay so we do see the labels here and you can see the longer ones actually get cut off so we need to make our label multiple lines and also I wanted to put a black view underneath so that the text really pops so let's go ahead and do that let's go into the storyboard click the label I'm gonna change the color to white and then I'm going to click this font choose custom and I'm gonna just set it as bold so it stands out a little more and we need to make it multiple lines so for the number of lines just press the down arrow here to put it to zero or you can just type in the zero so now let's run it and see how it looks okay so now we have white text which is even harder to see but we're gonna put that black background on it and you can see now it splits it into two lines okay so let's go ahead go back to our storyboard and search for UI view here I'm gonna drag a view into the cell but in here make sure that the view is behind the or also the view will be blocking the label so make sure it's image view and then the view and then the label so for the view I'm gonna change it into a black color and let's add some constraints on this video so click the view I view go down here and uncheck constraint margins I'm going to add left right and bottom margins so this one I do want it to the edge of the cell zero zero zero okay for height we're gonna put 80 because that's what we put for the label I add four constraints update frames now let's run it to see how that looks okay so the view is in the place we want but it'd be nice to add a little transparency to that so we can go back to the storyboard and click the View you can either change the transparency here to 0.5 to make it a little dimmer or there's another way you can leave the Alpha as one but you can click the background color and it out pops this color and you can change the actual color to be a 50% opacity black so the difference is that in this case because our view doesn't contain any elements it doesn't matter what which of these two techniques that we choose but for example if the view actually contained some elements then setting the Alpha would also change all of the Alpha values for all of the elements inside the view I mean it wouldn't actually change the Alpha values for the elements inside the view but they would all appear dimmed simply because the parent container itself is dimmed so if you had elements inside the view and you merely wanted the background color to be transparent then you would do this way by clicking the background color and simply changing the color itself to 50% but if you wanted all of the elements inside your UI view to also be semitransparent then you would change this alpha value so just a quick tip for the future okay so now let's run it again and take a look at the faded label okay so that looks good so in this video we're also gonna try something cool because in the previous episode 5 there was a comment left by strange productions and letting me know that there is a way to get the maximum quality thumbnails so this is the string max res default jpg so let's give that a try thank you strange productions for watching and letting us know that let's go with the view controller and let's change that instead of MQ default its max res default right let's just confirm that max res default jpg so let's run it oh yeah that looks amazing I don't know if you guys can tell the difference but I definitely can right here thank you so much strange reductions that's amazing it looks so much better awesome ok so it was a shorter video today thanks for watching if you enjoyed the lesson please share it with your colleagues and friends share it on social media helped me build more subscribers on YouTube and make sure you subscribe and like yourself and I will see you guys tomorrow at 12 okay take care guys bye bye
