hey coders Kris here yesterday you sign up for a parse account today we're going to create an Xcode project and we're going to integrate the parse SDK into it in future lessons we're going to use this project to demonstrate all of the various features of parse so if you sign up for parse account you should have this dashboard view right here and you're going to want to go to create a new app in the upper right hand corner so click this button you're gonna have to pick a name for it because we're just doing demos I'm just gonna say parse demo and click make it and before we go into all of these things on the lefthand side I want you to go into app settings and go under security and keys this is where you're going to find a couple of the keys that we're going to need in order for our app or our project to connect to this backend all right so we're gonna come back to this but what I want you to do now is there in the new dashboard there are a couple of dots down here you can see where my mouse is click it and you're gonna have a pop up menu go to downloads and we're gonna download the parse SDK so in the past we used to have to download the SDK and then manually include it into our project but now they have an opensource github library where we can actually use a cocoa pod install so we've been doing this in the past mmm two weeks ago approximately I showed you guys how to use cocoa pods and how to install a whole bunch of github libraries using this method and so we're gonna do the same thing because using cocoa pods has the benefit of managing the parse library if it updates we're gonna be able to easily update it as well okay so let's create that Xcode project we were talking about so I'm gonna create a new Xcode project here and I'm gonna make this a single view application and let's call it the parse demo app make sure that the language is Swift and I have device as iPhone and all of these other options underneath it unchecked I'm gonna click Next I'm just gonna save it on my desktop here and here we've got our single view application I'm gonna go ahead and close this guy and I'm gonna press command spacebar and open up terminal now if you don't know what cocoapods is or you haven't gotten it installed then take a look at the video linked in the upper right hand corner right now click through it I'll open up a new window and I'll show you how easy it is to setup cocoapods and then you're going to be able to come back to this video and continue along so here we're going to navigate to our project folder so I'm gonna type in PWD to see where I am I'm at user slash Chris and I know there's a desktop folder in the Chris folder so I'm gonna type CD space desktop you type LS that lists all of the files on the desktop or in that current folder I mean so type in now CD parse demo app because I see that folder right here on my desktop make sure you get the capitalization correct okay so now I am in my project folder so I'm gonna type pod space in it and that's gonna create the pod file that I need so let's there we go let's open up our project folder here's the pod file I'm going a little bit quickly because we've actually done this a lot of times in previous videos while we installed I think ten different libraries or maybe a little less than that but rightclick the pod file go to open with go to your text editor I'm gonna go to subline sublime text which is my text editor and then we're gonna need to uncomment a couple of lines here this one and this one right here so make sure you have this platform line uncommented and use frameworks and uncommenting means just removing that hash symbol in front of it and then next we're going to want to include this pod parse in between the target and the end tags like that save the file go back to terminal and let's type in pod space install so it's gonna go read that pod file and fetch the libraries which we need takes a little while sometimes so give it a little bit of time I might just edit out that wait time so you guys don't have to wait okay so it's done now we're gonna go back to our project folder it created a couple of new files for us we're gonna open up this parse demo dot XC workspace and let me just change this xcode window so you can see it so we've got our demo app here just press command b to build the project now so it's gonna build all those libraries that it downloaded so you can see Xcode doing that crunching right now and while that's doing that let's go back let's press back in our browser window okay build succeeded back here in the downloads page click launch the QuickStart is there a couple of instructions that we're gonna need so go to data go to mobile go to iOS go to Swift go to new project okay so here it recommends you actually to download the blank Xcode project because it's done it all for you already but you know what we don't want to do that because we've set up our own Xcode project we've integrated the parse library now and now it's a matter of adding a couple of lines of code and specifying the secret key and the app key in order for our our Xcode project to connect to the back end up here in the upper right if you're signed in you're going to see a dropdown where you can pick the particular parse app that you created in the dashboard so here it's already set it to sample parse app for me actually no I want parts demo that's the one I created this is this is something else so parse demo is the one that we wanted so make sure that if you only have one it's easy but if you have a couple make sure you have the right one selected because it's gonna change the code here and it's gonna fill in these keys for you okay so now I'm gonna copy and paste this line of code let's just copy it let's see we put it in the app delegate that Swift file under the did finish launching with options let's go into the app delegate that Swift and under here before the return statement because if you put it after return statement it won't get run nothing happens after a return statement because it returns out of that function so paste it there actually I'm missing a P so I might have to import parse so import parse and there we go command B build it build succeeded and we're set now we haven't tested if it actually connects to the back end in the following lesson we're going to try to retrieve say some data and we should be able to tell so thanks for watching and please help me out by liking the video subscribing and sharing it with your friends thank you so much and I'll see you guys tomorrow bye
