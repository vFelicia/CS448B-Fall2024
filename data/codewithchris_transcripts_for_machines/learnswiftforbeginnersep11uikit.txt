hello welcome to lesson 11 of the learn Swift for beginners series in this lesson I want to introduce to you UIKit it's an apple framework that contains many of the classes we're going to need in order to construct iOS apps all right so let's dive in and see what's available and you are kit so like I mentioned in the intro for this video the uikit framework is essentially a library of classes that Apple gives us to build apps with when you think about it there are a lot of common elements to any sort of app for example apps may have views they may have buttons you know all apps are going to have things that you need to present to the user apps are going to need to handle user interaction from the person using the app and so on and so forth so to build that functionality out every single time you're going to build an app is extremely tedious and not to mention complex and complicated so Apple has provided UI kit for us to use and it contains a ton of prebuilt classes for us to handle all of these common things so here I'm looking at the UI kit reference guide which contains a list of all of the UI kid classes that are available for us to use I'll link to it in the description below the video but if you want to look for it yourself just go into Google and type in Apple space UI kit don't just type in UI kit because the first few results for that query isn't the Apple UI kit so just type an apple space UI kit to find the correct one in the first result it was also essential to learn about inheritance before I told you about UI kit because many of these classes inherit from each other they build off of each other so they don't redefine things and this reference guide used to be kind of organized in a hierarchy so you could see which classes inherited from other classes but since they've changed it and they've made it kind of a listing so you don't get that but I did a google search and I found an image that I'm sure this is not to complete UIKit because this image was from 2012 I think yeah you can see here in the URL it's from 2012 but it does give you an idea of how the classes are organized so you can see at the very top of this tree if you can imagine this left side being kind of at the top of the tree and this right side being the bottom of it if you take for instance this uibutton class which represents a button that the user can tap on the screen UI button inherits from UI control which inherits from uiviewcontroller thing you can think of it as the big grandfather or granddaddy and what this nsobject class does is it provides that basic functionality that allows you to create an object from a class definition so that's something we went through in part one of the classes lesson so this NS object class and it gives you that functionality and if we take a look at what was the next one down the chain so the UI responder class so this UI responder class inherits from nsobject means that it contains that foundation that's going to be needed by you know all of these UI elements or user interface elements okay so the next one down is a UI view so UI view inherits from UI responder which inherits from nsobject so UI do get all of that functionality and on top of that the UI view class provides functionality for displaying something onto a view so a UI view is something that you can show to the user so it contains all of that functionality and code and then next in that hierarchy down to the UI button we have UI control now you are control contains all of that functionality before it following this line here and on top of that contains basic code and functionality for a user element control so stuff that is specific for displaying on to a view handling user interaction and events and responding so then we have a specific type of UI control and that is the UI button which is pretty selfexplanatory it looks and behaves like a button with a certain button events so that's just one example of you know the path you can see that there's a whole ton of classes and there's even more now so whenever you go and you know before you go and do something with your app chances are you can probably leverage something from UI kit to build off of rather than building something from scratch so in this video I just wanted to give you guys an introduction to UI kit because we're going to be using a lot of classes from here and every time I do I will try and remember to reference this guide or at least link to it so you can take a look at these classes it's very useful and handy to have at your fingertips because you can click into these classes and then you can find out for this UI button class what sorts of functions it has and properties it has that you can use and leverage and how you can perform specific things with the button or with that class and furthermore I might do another video series where we go over specifically different UI elements because I think that would be useful for beginners to understand how to use for example like a date picker or text field or a slider or switch or something like that so that might be a separate series on just UI elements okay so thanks for watching and if you'd like me to continue producing these videos for you guys please give this video a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel to help channel grow and I'll see you in the next lesson bye for now you
