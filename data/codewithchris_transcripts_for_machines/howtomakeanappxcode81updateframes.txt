hello Chris here in this video I just want to quickly tell you about a change in xcode 8.1 regarding update frames a lot of people are watching my beginner series and some other videos and I show things like adding an element onto the storyboard and then adding some Auto layout constraints to that element and then going to a menu here where I'm choosing update frames and what that does is it positions that element according to the new autol layout constraints that you've added well they've moved that uh menu option out of this menu in xcode 8.1 and they've actually put it as a button here update frames which makes it a lot more convenient for us so all you need to do now is click this button to update frames so that's just a quick note for you guys who are scratching your heads and wondering uh why you don't see that menu option in your xcode so thanks again for learning with me and I'll see you guys in the next one bye for now
