hello and welcome back it's Chris here so since the last Vlog we have completed our first development Sprint we've started the second one I've redesigned the way that the app looks and I know that ordering is a little bit sketch but I've learned so much along the way I want to share all those Lessons Learned with you in this Vlog but before I do that in case you're new here this is a raw and unscripted video format where I share our team's journey in making money with apps this Vlog entry is dated January 25th 2024 so with that being said I hope you enjoy today's Vlog all right since the last video update we've finished our first development Sprint that was here Sprint Acorn I'll talk about that in just a second but just to take a couple steps back in case you're brand new here because we're into Vlog six now the original idea was a moot Tracker app that I sketched out in my notebook and then we designed it into a flow that looked like this and then we decided to take the first very simple core user flow which is to make a entry and to look at your logged entries and look at a calendar view and turn that into a series of tasks to complete then we estimated each of the tasks in terms of something called story points which is a rating of how complex it is and an approximation of how long it would take after breaking down the tasks and estimating them we decided to work in two we Sprints now for the first Sprint we only actually had about a week and a half because of other priorities and we had two developers on this project which are inaki and joash so we assigned the tasks to them in this first Sprint at the end of the two weeks or week and a half we had a demo of what they were working on and then we had a retrospective where we talked about what went well and what we could improve on and then we had something called the backlog grooming step which is to take a look at the status of the project what's been done what's not been done and reorganize things for the next Sprint which is this one Sprint Pak laava so first of all let's talk about what went well and what didn't so what went well was um they were really excited to work on a new project because it's been a while since we have built our own stuff and so they're really excited to do that um but let me touch on some of the things where we could improve on one was uh misestimation of the story points so what we wanted to get done in the first Sprint it ended up being two months in reality to do so I would say we got done maybe half of what we had set out to do in the first Sprint so we had really underestimated the amount of time and effort it would take to do the tasks there were also unforeseen dependencies because you have two people working with each other one person might get stuck on their task because they're relying on a piece that someone else is doing so joash says the same thing here didn't anticipate for some other uh dependencies and the UI so they were working off of this UI here that we had designed now the problem is that me as the project owner I didn't feel like this design was final but yet I got the guys to start on this anyways so that is a bit of a problem because they're building off of something that may change and so that would that become very apparent as a huge detriment after this first Sprint because they weren't able to build finalized UI and when I was looking at the demos there were also things that there were assumptions that were made that weren't very clear for example let me just put this into concrete terms here let me see if I can find okay so for example this screen right here where you're supposed to be able to scroll through your moods for that day now it's not clear looking at this timeline this little strip on this side where are you supposed to see timestamps right so when inaki was building this to him he interpreted this design as okay you see the starting time like the time stamp of the first entry and the time stamp of the last entry and so he was trying to build that and he was running into difficulty because he was implementing this as a list and he needed to make sure the lines connected and all of that but when I look at this design I interpreted this as you thinking about what would be useful for a user I would think there's a time stamp beside every entry and then the lines just connect all the timestamps together so that is what became apparent this sort of miscommunication where this isn't spelled out that sort of stuff and this was so easy to overlook when you're looking at a design you're like oh yeah this looks good I see that there's a line here but it's not until you actually try to build it out that these questions come to mind and uh one thing I think we could do better is to make sure that every aspect of the user interface is thought out and all the wha ifs are answered before we start development so that's something that I'm definitely um taking into the next Sprint so in this next Sprint we had most of the tasks to be honest from the first Sprint were not done so they were moved into the second Sprint here so they were continuing to work on like the mood entry and the scrollable calendar things like that but while they were working on that I decided that I really needed to finalize this design so that inyi and joash could work off of something uh more final and that things weren't up in the air so I did this exercise which actually worked out really well so I think in my head I couldn't put my finger on why I wasn't happy with design because I don't think it was how I imagined the app so it needed to come from me to drive that direction and I was imagining a mood tracker being very calm I wanted also the theme to be simple so with the focus on that I took an image that I found calm and soothing which is this one and I took the colors from it and I decided to use that as a starting point for my design and I'm not a professional designer I I wanted to put something down to give direction to JC who is our designer to really put the finishing touches and the details together but I wanted to start him off to give him a sense of where my head was at so this is what I I started creating and I want to take you through the process of how I arrived uh closer and closer to a final design so this was what I did first I started with this screen and I wanted to make it very simple instead of overwhelming the user with options I wanted to just ask a simple question are you leaning more towards the bad side or the good side and after you make a selection uh for bad and good then we begin to drill down and ask more questions but if you don't want to you can just hit save and then you just feel good or bad because sometimes you're not in the mood to enter more details but if you are then you can so I imagine there to be a library of preset let's say you selected good so preset of good emotions here or moods You' be able to type in a custom one these are your recent ones and these are pinned ones if you use often and this is a scrollable section right here and then I imagined when you selected something it would come down here into this little area and then we would ask additional questions like we obviously these options don't make sense for WEA but I I just just wanted to give the gist of it rather than designing it for real so then the next question is are are you with anyone what activity were you doing and things like that because the more detail that you log now in the future when you look back on it and you're trying to analyze how you feel and and what sorts of triggers you have and all that stuff the more data you have the better uh so that was my first attempt at at that uh the second attempt I I thought of instead of like I I wanted to indicate where you were along that path of logging a full um emotion or full entry so I decided to use these icons to represent the different questions but as I was doing it as I got to this step I scrapped this idea because to me looking at this it it didn't fit the ethos of being simple like when I look at this it actually makes me anxious that I have to answer so many different questions but what this does do well is it allows you to jump back let's say you're at this point and you want to change an answer from a previous screen you can tap on something to jump back to that section so that was my second iteration but I didn't like how cluttered and how overwhelming it looked and decided then to start working on how the entry screen might work and I wanted to carry through that cozy and calm feeling so uh it really helped to have a color palette and and I would these colors I I picked out from this photo right here so I really used all of these colors except green I couldn't find a good place to use green until I got here and I decided I actually needed a couple of other colors as well so I wanted to weave your entry into a sentence so it looked like this so from there at that point on I knew I was onto an idea so I decided to formalize it a little bit by charting out the main screens and the logging flow uh the on this great box is the onboarding which I haven't done yet and the other thing I thought through was how these screens get presented so I wrote here that this is an initial screen uh when the app is launched this is the first screen they see because let's say you are in the mood to log in motion right you launch the app that's what you probably typically want to do is like you're launching the app to log in EM motion so I wanted to pop this up first as the initial screen if it's the very first time you're ever launching the app which is show an onboarding sequence that tells you a little bit about the app first but aside from that subsequent uh launches would show this screen on app launch and I wanted this to be a a sheet a popover sheet so that it can be dismissed by the user dragging down on it and if you select mood and you go forward with logging and entry then you go into this logging flow which I showed you a little bit about and you can cancel out of it at any time and you can hit uh confirm at any time so I made sure to add a lot of notes as I was designing this because I wanted to capture all of my thoughts as well on what happens when a certain button is tapped and uh what screen should it go to so for example when you tap on this x button at this point in time you've already made a selection which is you've selected bad or good so you've started an entry right in that case we shouldn't just discard it when you hit X I want to show a dialogue that says discard or continue and then same thing here you see a check mark to save if you don't want to continue answering all these different questions you can hit this to save at any time and go back to the entries screen at this point when you hit X they haven't actually made any data entry there's no data entry here so if you hit X we don't need to show a confirmation dialogue we just dismiss it and there's no save button here because they haven't actually made any selections yet so in both of those cases whether they dismiss this popup or they save the entry they will come down here and I decided to organize it by day because I realized that I need to show that a certain day has no entries and I realized this when I thought about the calendar view so this is the calendar view it shows the calendar view as a full screen sheet so again it slides up and it looks like this and if there's a circle over it that means there are entries for that day and this little dot represents the current day I modeled this calendar off of the Calendar app in iOS so what happens when you select a certain day it goes to the entry screen scrolled to that date so that's why let's say you hit 11 of January and it it would go here and it would show you 11th of January with no entries if I didn't show these dates with this no entry label then where would you scroll to it wouldn't really make sense and other things that are really helpful to add these little comments are like a todo things that I haven't thought through yet so for example how do you edit or delete an entry and so I just left a little note there for myself and something I thought about for v2 was to add a filter button if you tap on this button we should be able to filter show me all of the entries where I felt good show me all of the entries where I felt happy or whatever and that would allow you to do that I thought through this scrolling mechanism will allow you to scroll through different days but you would soon get lost so this button allows you to go back to the current day and this white button here brings up the new mood entry screen like it would slide up this screen right here and allow you to log in motion that's what that button does and this would lead you to a profile screen as a sheet as well so I haven't designed this either but as you can see the entries this is the main view but the profile is a slide up full screen sheet the new entry is a slide up full screen sheet and the calendar is as well so I think it's much simpler especially this screen with the entry and it's only if you select one of these options where you go into a deeper logging flow and at any time you can exit and start stop answering questions by hitting this save button now there are certain interactions that I've identified here that I haven't really thought through yet for example how do you edit a custom emotion or mood that you've added let's say you made a typo because I imagine when you hit when you tap on this to add a custom mood that the keyboard would pop up and you'd type it directly into here and then if you hit enter it would turn into a bubble here that you can select so how would you edit that or delete one of the ones that you added yourself would it be a tap and hold interaction but if it is a tap and hold interaction how would that be discoverable because it's really hard to see that you would be able to tap and hold this to bring up some options so you have to think about that discoverability aside from just maybe literally putting a label here that says you can tap and hold these little bubbles you could do that but ideally you would make make it more of a discoverability thing now the other question that I got asked when I showed this to nyaki and joash and it's a really good observation is that when you tap on one of these does it go to the next screen automatically or does it just select it and it was show a selected State and then you'd have to tap on some sort of button to go to the next screen another thing that was brought up was that if you are in on the next screen how would you go backwards to let's say change your answer so those are things that I still need to think about and we still need to solve the reason why this x button there's like overlap here is because this x button was added after the fact when we were in a meeting so I haven't gotten a chance to adjust that but it's a work in progress but I'm a lot happier with the general direction of this versus this where I gave this to our designer and I literally gave JC this like these images these Doodles right here and he came up with this so I realized that it's a even for you if you have an app idea and you are going to send it off to a designer people can't read your mind now you probably have some sort of idea of how you want it to look like the colors like even some sort of ethos like Simplicity is the one that I decided to use here right even something like that would be something to go on for a designer so I think JC would be able to take this and develop it further because I think there's enough indication of the direction I want to go in and furthermore I don't want this direction to just be for this app because if you go back to Vlog number one you'll know that this is going to be a series of health and wellness and productivity type apps I really want to carry this theme um across all of the family of apps so that they're cohesive and the other thing is that I know this color scheme isn't for everyone I find the soothing everyone's different I do plan to allow theme like color theme changes and that's something that I I put on the backlog and I think it would be a nice thing to have as well now all of this stuff that I'm talking about here this new design Direction I did this while Sprint Bak laava was underway so joash and and Yaki are not working off of this new design yet so at the end of Sprint baklava we have to reestimate some of the things based on this new design and then we are going to plan Sprint number three and then we'll be working off the new design so I want to say that going through this process so far working with other people has been really eye openening actually some of the things that have come up for example making sure like how do you communicate what's in your head to someone else making sure that you have things finalized and well thought out before you hand it off and then also like how do you properly estimate things all of those have come up as Road bumps in the journey so lots of learnings I'm really glad that I'm going through this process and I hope that um you're having some takeaways as well just by following along
