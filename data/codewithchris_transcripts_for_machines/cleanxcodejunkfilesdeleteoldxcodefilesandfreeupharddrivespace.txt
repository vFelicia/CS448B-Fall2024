hey code crew it's chris here so i have a dilemma i am running out of hard drive space as you can see here my hard disk is 250 gigs i've got 11 gigs left so that means about 237 gigs are taken up so i have this tool called grand perspective and it lets you visualize what's on your hard drive now this tool isn't free it's you can get it from the mac app store for about ten dollars i think um however there might be other free tools that do this and this is not even very necessary but i just wanted to walk through visually what is taking up the space and then we're gonna go through and delete all of the unnecessary xcode files and outdated files old files that are no longer needed and we're going to see how much hard drive space we can actually save so the xcode app itself is about 15 gigs as you can see here these are all just different applications but if you take a look at this part xcode drive data this is eight gigs moving on to the left this is xcode user data that's 12 gigs this is xcode ios device support 8 gigs this is xcode archives four gigs this is watch os support and that's that's kind of small but this big chunk right here core simulator devices again is related to xcode this is a whopping 37 gigs down here core simulator caches 10 gigs and the rest of the rest of this stuff is just like old zoom calls and stuff but you can see i i would say about half the hard drive is taken up by xcode related stuff so let's dive in and let's take a look at what we don't need and free up a ton of hard drive space i'm going to show you exactly what folders you can get rid of and you tell me how much hard drive space you're going to save the longer you've used xcode the more hard drive space you're going to save all right let's take a look so while i was looking for a solution to figure out what folders i can delete i came across this blog article which was really helpful so we are going to follow this list here and we're going to attack these folders and see systematically how much space we can save so if any of these folders that it's pointing to you can't find it or you can't see it it might be hidden so there it's really easy to show hidden files command shift plus full stop or period and that will toggle on hidden files or toggle them off all right so let's go for the first one right here it's going to be in your hard drive your users your own personal folder and then library and then developer that's where you're going to find the majority of all this xcode simulator stuff so the first folder is core simulator devices so each time you open up the simulator and you restore you erase all settings and content you're essentially spinning up a different device so each of those has its own sort of id and over the years as we can see if i go into this devices folder and take a look at the dates on these it goes back all the way to 2015 and this folder itself let's see how much space i would be saving here uh it's calculating the size but essentially i'm going to get rid of all of it okay there are so many folders in this devices folder that is taking forever to calculate the size so i'm gonna pull up my grand perspective again and this is that folder as you can see that path down there core simulator slash devices this is 37 gigs so that's what i'm going to blow away right now delete and it's going to go into the trash and i'm going to empty it ah there 34 gigs all right so that's gone that's awesome okay and i know it says you can run a terminal here but i basically got rid of everything so the next time i start the ios simulator in xcode it's going to be a fresh device and it's going to create one folder okay so you i guess you periodically have to go in and clear this out okay the next one is xcode device support so let's go under xcode device support and i don't have any old uh ios versions here if you do have ones that you don't use anymore if you've been using xcode for a long time you'll have those and you can get rid of them if you don't plan on you know testing with them or anything like that so i've just got these two newer ones ios 14s so we'll leave that and let's go into here now core simulator cache right here let's see how big this folder is okay this one's about 10 gigs pretty respectable and it says just delete each directory so i'm going to go inside and delete that one right there it says you know delete all the subfolders within this dyld i don't even know what that stands for but there goes 10 gigs either way okay xcode derived data so this one is actually uh it gets cleared out pretty often i would think this one's 1.26 gig so it's not too much whenever xcode is you know something isn't working with xcode or you know you don't have autocomplete it's not picking up or you're getting build errors when you know there shouldn't be one of the most common pieces of advice you'll hear is to delete derived data and restart xcode so what's inside this derived data folder if you want a detailed read i'll link to this article below but essentially it's a bunch of log files a bunch of cache a bunch of index files you know when you first load your project and at the top status bar xcode says we're indexing all the files in your project well that's that's what it's writing to so you can safely delete all of these uh folders uh even if it's for a project you're currently working on because as soon as you launch that project it's going to regenerate this folder for you so there goes that 1.26 gigs saved and here xcode archives next one xcode archives so these are the archives that you create um you know right before you submit your app or you're building an archive for another purpose and if these are old and you don't need them you can go ahead and delete them so how much space am i saving here all right almost five gigs there goes that and log files device logs so i think these are the log files when you plug in like your actual devices and oftentimes you'll see it's downloading uh device logs and stuff like that i think that's where this goes ios device logs okay so let's see how much space i'm saving oh this one's not much at all 57 megs okay actually these files um let me just undo that for a second you see these files dot db dot db dash shm dot db dash wal i noticed a bunch of those files here outside this folder to developer portal right so i guess these are just log files as well um they don't say in this blog article to delete those you know so let me delete these device logs first um i don't know if i can delete these but if you look at some of these files 2015 they haven't been modified so i think i can safely delete them even these ones 2017 i'm gonna just go ahead and delete those if something bad happens you'll i'll let you know and i'll admit this video but those seem like just log files to me so i got rid of them okay and that does it for this um this blog article right here however i noticed that there is another part which is taking up a lot of space so if i take a look at this this file right here the developer slash slash xcpg devices so let me just open up this folder right this folder right here not devices but x cpg devices if i you know there are a lot of folders in this folder so it'll probably take a while to calculate the size but if i take a look at this is this 2.261 gigs but this is the same folder all here let me just expand the focus yeah so this entire folder is 7 gigs developer slash xcpg devices and i yeah eight gigs and i don't know if i can delete this because it wasn't listed in this article so i just googled it and i found this other article which seems to be a little more thorough there seems to be a lot more things that it lists that you can delete but it's also chock full of ads um so i don't know if i'll link to this this article but it does list developer xcpg devices and it's saying these are playground project cache files so that makes sense xc probably stands for xcode pg stands for playground and devices are just you know every time you open a new playground and uh when you run the code it says it's starting the simulator i think probably behind the scenes what it's doing is it's spinning up a new device so then this is where it's creating those those files now that's just a guess where was that again library developer inside the xcode folder okay here it is x cpg devices so i'm going to go ahead and i don't know if i can delete that file though um so i'm going to delete the folders because i know these these ids right here these are device ids i don't know if i can get rid of that file so i'm just going to get rid of the folders i'm sure that will be regenerated actually if i take a look at the date you can see some of them are pretty old as well 2015. so i'll delete all those and now let us empty the trashcan and see how much space we save so here it is again um 237 gigs taken up let's empty the trash and this might take a while all right so it's finally done it got rid of something like 600 000 files and i had about 10 gigs left over so it looks like i saved about 63 gigs off of my hard drive that is pretty substantial if i have to say now actually let's launch xcode make sure it still launches and make sure everything still works okay so um why don't we give that a try so actually now when i build it it's going to be launching a brand new simulator it's going to be creating a new device because i deleted all of them so take a look here uh you can see inside derived data see it's created a new folder for this project so it's okay to delete everything in there but also inside core simulator inside devices you can see that this is being spun up now this is my new simulator device that it is in the process of launching and creating uh there it is um okay that's not good so let me take a look here you know what let me try to close this relaunch it i might actually have to reboot my system first um what i'm going to do is i'm also going to clean the build folder let's try that again and if this fails i'm going to reboot the system and see what happens okay actually this time it is working so uh let's see did i create this a different one no this is the same one so i don't know what happened there but everything looks okay so far so i hope that was helpful for you if you tried this let me know how much hard drive space you saved by leaving a quick comment below thanks for watching i'll see you guys in the next video
