in this Vlog I talked about which app we decided to start building what our initial marketing strategy will be and how I'm scoping out competitor apps now if you're brand new to this series welcome this is a raw and unscripted video format where I share the Journey of our team trying to build apps for profit and this entry is dated September 28th 2023 it's about 2 weeks since our last uh Vlog entry and if you missed that first one click on right over here by the way to everyone who watched that and commented that they didn't mind this sort of raw format uh thank you so much for that it's really encouraging for me to hear with that said I hope you enjoy this Vlog hey it's Chris here so I want to give you an update on how this project has been going so I have presented the idea to our team about this and it's the same thing I told you in Dev Vlog one what the idea is and I told the team to go ahead and start brainstorming some ideas about technical challenges about gamification ideas and just anything freefor all let's just brainstorm and get some thoughts on the page and we work better offline and so we didn't hold a meeting and have everyone brainstormed together like that we just did it asynchronously and had everyone think about it and then contribute and update this document here are some of the things that came up some technical challenges on uh proposed database architecture pros and cons of that stuff uh potentially what we might do in terms of uh how to analyze the data using AI to reveal those insights to the user uh some gamification proposals on how to make it motivating for users to continue using these apps and some monetization options so all of these are just ideas nothing set in stone the other thing that I started doing was to learn about the business side of apps because we focus mostly on development and coding that's that we have that down pat but we don't know the other side about how to Smart efficiently and smartly grow apps and monetize them and make money with them so one of my favorite places to do to learn that sort of stuff is with Steve Young at ATMs and the reason for this is because he backs up all of his claims with data slides numbers that's what I've noticed about his videos and I think they're more concrete than someone just saying you should do this you should do that and the reason he has that data is because he runs an agency that helps other people grow their apps so he's constantly testing things and figuring out what works and then he shares those learnings through ATMs and he also interviews a lot of other industry experts so anyways what I've been doing is watching select videos and I've also been taking notes so I will share these with you um so far I've watched two of his videos and I'm I'm trying to um really absorb the information so I'm taking notes and by watching a bunch of these videos I can then take a look at these notes and formulate a marketing plan for our app so that's what my plan is so I'm learning a ton with watching every video I'll share these notes with you don't worry uh the other thing that we have done since the last devlog is to figure out what app to build first now I didn't want to choose a heavier app because I want to get some quick wins under the belt so I wanted to go with something quick and easy that we can actually launch the worst thing is trying to build a sleep tracker because even if it there's an MVP with the sleep tracker the concept of tracking sleep I think is much harder than let's say a mood Tracker Where the user launches the app and enters in how they're feeling so that ultimately is what we chose because like I said a I think it can be done pretty quickly so that we can get a quick win and some quick experience under a belt number two is that a lot of the elements from this app I think are applicable and reusable for other apps for example looking at a calendar and seeing historically what you've logged that calendar can be turned into a reusable component for let's say a sleep tracker where you would also want to look at a calendar historical data and see how many hours you've slept for example so this is the first app we are tackling and the other thing that drove this decision not just the things that I talked about was doing app keyword research now let me talk about this for a second like I said I think app marketing and the business side of things it's so important because if we build an amazing app it looks and feels great if no one knows about it then it's pointless so I think the marketing aspect is very important so there are multiple ways to go about it right there are paid ways such as paying for Apple search ads or paying for at Facebook ads or whatever to drive downloads and installations but obviously that costs a lot of upfront capital and well not a lot but it does cost some upfront capital and I'm more of a risk adverse person and how I built code with Chris was through organic search so that is writing articles targeting specific keywords to rank for those keywords in Google and then when people search it they'll find my article and they will uh click it so SEO basically there is the same sort of thing for for apps so when someone is searching for an app in the the App Store let's say they search mood tracker you want your app to pop up right and so there was a very interesting video from Steve talking about I think it this video if you search it and it's something like in the first five minutes he starts talking about a strategy for a couple of his apps where he did no paid marketing he only targeted specific low competition keywords that all of the big companies are not targeting so the big companies headspace for the meditation app right headspace they're probably targeting terms like like meditation and uh focus and what is some mindfulness and things like that right those generic Big Lots of search traffic keywords they're not optimizing for the lower traffic keywords because it's just not worth it for them you have a limited amount of space space in your app store metadata to include information so they're going to Target the juiciest keywords because they have that authority to rank for those High competition keywords so this strategy that Steve is talking about here is about identifying those low competition keywords because it's low competition your app should be able to rank for it pretty highly and it will still bring you some free traffic that you don't have to pay for so he was showing what was inspiring was he was showing a couple of his apps that get about a 100 downloads a day and it's making almost $10,000 I think the app number two is actually making $10,000 with 100 downloads a day so then he goes through this this process of identifying these low competition keywords so using App follow a free account by the way so they have paid accounts but using a free account an app follow and a free account in Mobile action so I signed up for both of these services for free and I figured out a couple of these keywords here for mood tracking and emotion tracking which is what we're doing I figured out about four but he says you only need two so what we're looking for is a combined traffic number of 50 and a difficulty around 30 30 to 50 so hopefully this works I've never done this before but there are people in the comments of the video saying that this worked for them so I want to give this a try so that's my first marketing strategy for the app is to go for low competition organic keywords and so I'm using these two tools I'll show you in a sec what I did um it's pretty simple actually I'll show you how what that keyword process looks like so I looked for keywords for a bunch of different apps and because I was able to identify what looked it's like some good keywords for this mood Tracker app I decided to go with this as a first app for us to do uh so that was another driving reason okay so let me show you how you look for keywords so in app follow if you go to yeah if you go to ASO tools here and you go to keyword live ranking you can type in whatever let's say I'll just use what I used and what this does it it is it pulls up all of the search results in the App Store the US app store for that keyword so this would be equivalent to you typing in mood tracker in the app store app on your phone these are the results and what you're looking for is an app that doesn't have too many reviews because you won't have that many reviews in the beginning so something like this one has 100 and something you could search for one that has has a 500 something I don't I didn't pay too much attention to that I actually just grabbed one of these so what you want to do when you've targeted an app is let's just haveit tracker it doesn't make sense let's just click this one mood light daily mood tracker so you click this little keyword recommendations button and it is going to take a look at what keywords this app is using a ranking for it then you want to sort by popularity and you want to scroll down and and look for an interesting keyword that uh is around the 30 range to 20 range uh that you want to look into how competitive it might be so let's say um let's say this one mental health Journal so what you want to do then is take this keyword I'll just remember mental health Journal you go into Mobile action uh under ASO you go to keyword tracking and it makes you choose an app when you create this account so by default it's calm that's why you see that there and then you click into this keyword research Tab and you type in mental health journal and this tool will tell you about that keyword here it is search suggestions I'm going to click that and it adds it down here and then you can see the search score is 23 and the the difficulty is 40 so that seems a bit High search score is 23 so those are the numbers here this is the search score this is the difficulty and then you just repeat this process until you find um at least two keywords where the traffic adds up to 50 and the difficulty is like around 30 hopefully not too high um yeah that's it these tools are crazy because there's so many features it's really easy to get lost in uh I felt lost in it and I had to poke around to really figure out where I can get these uh metrics for keywords yeah so that's how you do the keyword research okay the other thing that I've done is to after we decided we were going to go down this path I went to the App Store and I punched in a couple of these keywords I think I'm going to use a daily mood tracker and emot tracker I forget exactly maybe Mo tracker and yeah I don't remember exactly which two but I punched the keyword into my phone app store and I downloaded a bunch of apps that I thought were interesting now I haven't gone through them all my intention is to launch each of them and jot down some thoughts and notes and just to see if I can see any patterns about how these apps work and what is good and what is not so when I was scrolling through that those search results I noticed that there were apps that were created by individual people as well how do I know that because the on the publisher field it's like a personal name it's not a company name so I thought that was really good because that means that it's not too difficult to rank for that being a personal Indie developer you can still have your app show up in the search results for the keywords that I'm looking for so at the bottom of the document I know this is like a not very or ganized document but it's like a brain dump it's a shared notepad essentially right now so I I I was launching the apps I was just taking notes on what I see what features there are what you can do in the apps what is the monetization model what are their pricing tiers what do you get for it things like that and also some of my thoughts so I haven't done it with all the apps I downloaded I need to continue doing that and so even by this small exercise each app takes me about maybe 10 minutes to go through even just going through these five or six apps I was able to start thinking about what our app would require and so I started jotting down those notes as well keep in mind there's no wireframes right now there's no there's nothing right now it's just trying to it's almost like a blob of clay by looking at other people's apps in this category I'm starting to get ideas of what I would like for our version of the app and obviously these apps are more full featured I don't want to launch with all of the features because you know there's that concept of minimal viable product you want to launch quickly and and start getting data and things like that so um I'm trying to really go with a slim down feature set um and if I have ideas I really want to implement that seem a bit bigger I will Market as let's leave it for phase two let's get this launched first so that it's usable and we can start trying to rank this app and then later on build that feature so that's where we're at now I want to show you one more thing because these apps I I mentioned this in the first video these apps are not in Reinventing the wheel there's a ton of mood tracker apps there's a ton of sleep tracker step tracker water tracker ton of these but the way you can stand out is you can still do things a little differently right and here's one good example of this non boring apps calculator so this person has basically taken that concept so look at this this is a basic calculator app that you have on your phone already you don't need a calculator app but this one looks so so cool look at how exciting the numbers look and I I don't remember if there's themes or not but I just I didn't download it it does look like it has themes but wouldn't you rather use this so my point is it's not all about the functionality and who has more features and whatnot look at this habit app pretty crazy look so it's just marking that you've done that habit and then I guess you collect badges perhaps right it looks cool like even logging that you meditated looks cool you hold the button and it's like charging energy and then it becomes done okay so that look let's see it again boom done right just that would want to make you use this app more than another app right so don't feel like you have to create this completely new app idea don't feel like you need to like stuff it full of features and be have more features than your competitors I don't think it's about that at least the way that I want to go about it is to not focus on more features focus on less features but make each of those features just a joy to use so that someone would choose your app over another anyways that's devlog 2 that's where we're at right now the next steps I think are to solidify the requirements that we'd want for our app and then to start to draw some wireframes so that Jo Asen and Yaki who will be executing on the development will have something that so that they can start basically this is just a bunch of rough ideas of requirements so it's not enough to go on okay hope that was helpful again all of this progress that I've shared with you has literally happened in the last week okay thanks for watching hope that was helpful I'll talk to you guys next time
