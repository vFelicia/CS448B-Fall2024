hello and welcome back happy New Year yes this project is alive I was able to overcome my lack of motivation and my mental roadblocks and we've started our first development Sprint I'll share all the details with you in this Vlog now just in case you're new here this series is an unscripted and raw video format where I share our team's journey in building apps for profit and this entry is dated January 8th 2024 with that being said I hope you enjoy this Vlog hi welcome back it's Chris here and it's time for another Vlog I am ashamed to say that it's been 2 months since the last one and we have not made any progress since then I'm shooting this Vlog because we are starting to make progress and I do have some updates to share but before I share those updates and how things are going now I do want to talk about why there was a twomonth Hiatus what was going through my head and what I've learned from that because potentially this was a appending Hiatus I think in the past I would have just abandoned the project and I would have moved on and started something else so here's what was going through my head in full transparency mode this being a vlog I do want to share my thoughts and emotions so that I could look back on it so that you could learn from it as well or at least see what could potentially happen someone else so I think I was scared that's why I didn't prior prz this that's why I didn't work on it started thinking about I I stopped believing in the idea and so back in M Vlog one or two I was like I I need I know myself I need to carry through that momentum I need to launch this quickly I need to get this out the door because the longer it takes the less of that motivation that I have and that's a personal problem that's just my own issues in the way that I am but I realized I started reflecting about why I lost belief in this I think as time goes on and and you're spending time working on something there's always doubt right doubt starts to creep in and there's this nagging voice telling you this is not going to work you're going to waste all your time it's going to be embarrassing um you might not be able to do this blah blah blah blah blah so that combined with the fact that I do have other urgent work to do for the business like recording more content and the courses that we're working on and stuff it made it such an easy thing for me to just put this on the back burner just always put this at the bottom of the todo list especially because I was not happy with some of the data entry points here and I wasn't sure how to go about it so I knew that I couldn't move on unless I figured out this data entry part and so it was very easy for me to to say oh I'm going to think about it when I have a big block of uninterrupted time that's when I'm going to sit down and think about it but obviously that's just an excuse that you tell yourself or that I told myself rather so here we are 2 months later and we have restarted so there is progress on this I have not dropped this app let's let me explain to you now how I mentally got back on track I realized that the pressure that I was putting on myself was because I was expecting results I had dreams on making money with apps I wanted to build this is the first of many type of thing and that sort of pressure I think actually held me back what helped move me forward was the thought that I need more practice I need to release more apps so I can get more practice and this first app is not going to to be anything so I disconnected results from the actions and this actually made me feel a lot better to to make progress and to move forward on it because whatever happens my goal now is to launch the app my goal is not to try to make as much money as I can through the app and that would be a happy byproduct and maybe we'll eventually get there if we iterate on it and we find a segment of the market but if that doesn't happen I will work on another app if I maintain that attitude that this is just practice it takes the pressure off the other thing is that instead of trying to tell myself okay we're blocked on this I need to figure this user experience out I'm not happy with this user experience I was like you know what I'm just going to cut it out for this first launch I'm going to make it even simpler I basically said for this first iteration we're going to have little bit of onboarding just basic entry right here and a calendar view so you can review your results will that set us apart from the Apple app probably not but you know what it'll be a win in my book if I actually get this launched because it is practice so even if it doesn't do well I would have gained something I would have gained the experience of launching it I would have learned a lot from having people use it in the store and getting some sort of feedback or perhaps getting no traction and no downloads either way whatever happens I learn something just by going through the process and telling myself that this is practice and simplifying it even more so that I can move forward allows me to continue on with this journey okay so that's where we're at let me tell you what sort of progress we've made as a team because this was a team thing we have JC doing the design we have joash and nyaki working on the code and me driving the direction of the project so we decided to work on this in Sprints here first of all I had to come up with the vision of what this MVP was and as I told you I simplified it even more to basically just onboarding data entry not even custom moods just select a mood type of thing uh being able to look at a calendar view and be able to scroll through your daily boots like that and so they took those requirements and they broke it down into all of these different areas and we call this the backlog so these are all the things that we need to do to get it to that state and launch it and then we're going to work in two we Sprints we estimated effort on each of these tasks and these are what are called story points so each of these is a story and story points represent effort but it's not a linear effort it's not like this is one day this is two days this is 5 days and this is 8 days so it's something like one is low effort two is more effort like maybe three days of effort five would be like a whole week and I think eight would be the whole week and five would be multiple days or something like that yeah it's basically not a linear progression in terms of the effort each developer commits to a certain number of points per Sprint because inaki and joash have other tasks at CWC um not just working on this app I think we said we would do te points per Sprint for each developer hence we selected different tasks here so that each person would have about 13 to 16 points and this Sprint Ends by the end of this week actually so then we're going to have a demo and then we're going to review how the Sprint went and then we're going to do the second Sprint where we are going to select more tasks So based on this we are estimating that we can launch this app by I think it was mid Feb that's our Target right now so that's what's going on the development front on the design front I've told JC that I'm not super stoked about the design Direction and so I I have a few ideas of how to change this it's been flux so I don't have anything to share there yet but this design will be changing and it's yeah I guess it's not the traditional way that you would do it you would typically lock down the design first but because this app is pretty simple I think we can make that change we can be a little more agile yeah so that's where we're at right now I hope we continue to make regular progress and I'll share those updates with you I've realized that building apps is not just a matter of having the right skills but it's also a big emotional and mental part of it especially if you are trying to get specific results from your apps all right thanks for watching I'll talk to you next time
