hey code crew in this one day build app series you're going to learn how to build a YouTube app that lets users watch videos from a YouTube playlist by the end of building this app you'll gain a lot of new skills such as how to work with the YouTube API using iOS networking classes using professional tools such as github and bit rise and a whole lot more about UI construction and Swift programming here's a quick glance at more concepts you'll learn now there's one important thing I have to mention this one day build app series is part of a learning progression and it's meant to be done after the beginner series so if you haven't done that yet scroll down click on code with Chris to visit my channel page and there you'll see the learning path start with the beginner series first and finish that before attempting this one day build otherwise you might be confused okay with that said let's dive right in now here's a highlevel overview of the YouTube app that we're going to be building now don't get me wrong this is not a professional architecture diagram but it really does the job and simplifies things so that we can clearly see what components are at play how the data flows from one component to the next and also we can see how the user is going to navigate from screen to screen if it is like a much more complex app then we probably have to get a little more detailed than this so let me just break this down it's pretty straightforward actually we have the YouTube API on this API block up here and we're going to have a model class that is going to request from the API and get back JSON containing all of the videos and all of that data that we need we're gonna parse that data into an array of video objects which we're going to pass back to the view controller to display in a table view now we are going to create a custom table view cell so that we can download the thumbnail we can you know modify and prettify the dates and make sure that it looks the way we want so that's what we're going to do with a custom uitableviewcell when the user taps on one of those cells we're going to pass that selected video over to a detailed view controller where we're going to show the description of the video a thumbnail the video and the user can tap on that thumbnail to then play the video in that detailviewcontroller so that's pretty much it in a nutshell don't be fooled by how simple it is because a lot of the things that you're going to learn from this app is applicable to apps of larger magnitudes just it happens at a larger scale you're gonna learn how to work with api's how to work with json how to do segues from one view controller to the next and pass data from one view controller to the next and there's this is just a really good simple app to learn a lot of very common techniques that you will be using in much more complex apps to come okay so that's the general architecture of the app in the last part of this short introduction I want to go through what to expect in the upcoming lessons lesson one that's this introduction video in lesson two we're going to introduce and set up our tools such as github bit rise and Swift lint in lesson three we're going to set up our Xcode project we're gonna take a look at the YouTube API we're gonna stub out the classes and the structures that we need and we're going to look into downloading the data and setting up a constants file that lesson is going to be packed in Lesson four we're gonna set up the UI and we're going to hook up all of our UI elements establish communication from the model to the view controller through delegation and we're going to display lists of videos as just basic text labels in lesson 5 we're gonna work on the video sell to download and display the thumbnail and then we're gonna have to do some formatting of the date that comes back from the YouTube API so that we can display it in a friendly and pretty format in lesson 6 we're going to work on the detailed view controllers so the user can choose a video and they can actually watch it from within the app at this point you have a working YouTube app that displays videos and plays videos from a playlist however there are a couple of additional features that will be available to CWC Plus subscription members we're going to be able to add a tab bar so that we can have a couple of different screens maybe talking about the YouTube or profile having a subscribe button which requires authentic and a deeper YouTube API integration we're also going to allow customization of the channel and the playlists via a configuration file now just a little bit about CWC plus this is our paid membership program where you can access all of our premium training for one low monthly fee you can find out more information about it in the description below or visit code with Chris comm slash courses I hope you're as excited about this as I am the features I listed are just the start if there's a certain feature that you would like to see look at the description below the video for instructions on how to submit feature and tutorial requests now I want to turn it over to you out of all the skills that I mentioned that you'll be learning which one do you anticipate the most let me know by leaving a quick comment below and lastly if you're excited about app development like I am please make sure to give this video a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe hit that Bell notification icon so you don't miss the next video I appreciate you watching all the way to the end thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lesson
