hello and welcome to the code with Chris Q&A where I take a couple of minutes to answer questions that you guys have and today I have another question that I get a lot in my email and that is I have an app idea but I don't know where to get started that's actually a very open end question but I'll answer it the best I can the first thing I want to consider is whether or not you should learn how to code yourself because learning a new skill like programming especially if you've haven't gotten any experience in it before is quite daunting it's not impossible and it can be fun however it's not something that you can spend a couple of hours a week and then expect to pick it up you know in a month it requires some serious dedication just like if you're learning a new language or learning to pick up a new musical instrument so the first thing I want you to consider is how much time you have and also how much is your time worth to you so for example a lot of business owners when they ask this question they have an idea for an app for their business I would ask them if it's actually worth their time to learn how to program and then you know to code this app themselves and especially when you're first starting out the apps will be simple it will be you know amateur apps until you get better at it through time so is it worth all of that time investment to create an app that reflects that of a beginner or would it be more worth it for you to pay someone to create that f4u for your business especially and if you expect that app to bring in additional business then it could be worth it it could be more worth it to pay someone to do it rather than to learn it yourself especially if you know you're only learning it to build this one app and you have no intention of using the skill ever again of course there are lots of things to consider before you go hire someone to do it like your budget the added headache of having to manage a contractor or freelancer so yeah it's not a decision to be taken lightly however if you have decided to learn it yourself maybe you really want the skill or you want you know what a career or maybe you're just learning it as a hobby or to keep your skills sharp if you're a previous programmer in another language so if that's the case and you don't know where to start there's tons of resources online for you to learn in fact for free so Apple themselves provides the tool Xcode which you can download in the Mac App Store for free on your Mac and that is the tool the official Apple tool to build your iOS apps and next in order to write code in that application you need to know Swift so that's the name of the programming language and Apple provides a programming guide for that so you can you can read that for free it's a little technical in nature so if you're an absolute beginner you may not understand it the first time through but aside from that there are tons of websites out there with tutorials and beginner series and stuff like that where you can get your feet wet for free all you need is a Mac and that Xcode application which is also free and in fact on my site code with Chris comm if you go up to the very top start here there's a link called start here and on that page you'll find my beginner youtube series which will take you from knowing no programming at all to building a simple randomized by SAP and I think through that experience you'll learn basically how to create some interfaces write some logic and Swift code you'll probably hit a few roadblocks and overcome them so you know you'll learn how to overcome frustrations with learning programming and at the end you can decide whether or not you want to continue learning it'll probably take you a couple of hours to get through so yeah to circle back I have an app idea but I don't know where to get started so I think you should consider whether or not it's worth your time learning and what your goals are and if you do decide to learn then just very simply you know go to my website code with Chris calm and click start here at the top or Google beginner tutorials on how to build I Oh s apps there are tons of resources from there once you get your feet wet you're going to have questions on how to do this or how to do that and then from there let those questions lead how you learn and I think the biggest thing of all is if you're learning you need to set your own expectations to have some patience to learn a new skill because like I said it's almost like learning a new language or learning a new musical instrument you're not going to be very good at it in the beginning it's going to be hard might not be you know absolutely fun all the time but if you stick with it then it's definitely something that anyone can learn
