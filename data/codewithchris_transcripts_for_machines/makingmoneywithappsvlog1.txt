now this video is going to seem a little bit strange because I never intended to release this on YouTube it's a behind thes scenes Diary Of Us building an app product with the intention to make money from it I wanted to document all of our mistakes our roadblocks decisions made Lessons Learned by our team as we went along and then at some point in the future I was going to share this with our Cod withth Chris email list but then I thought it'd be such a waste if I didn't share this with you as we're going through the process now so here it is the first Vlog entry dated September 14th 2023 now one word of warning it's unscripted and it's raw and I'm sorry if it's a little bit rambly and not up to our usual production standards but it is a real unfiltered look into my thoughts and experiences as we're going through this journey so I hope you find some value in watching this hello it's Chris here so I thought I would start recording the journey and the process of building an app and launching it so that you can get an overthe shoulder look at what we're doing and this is as much of an exploration for us as it is for you uh but I hope that in recording this even I can look back at it and learn from any mistakes that we made relive the emotions and decisions that we made and so on and so forth so this is the first sort of like journal entry in this process and we've come up with nap idea or and yeah it's a couple of app ideas and I want to just go through what my thinking was so that perhaps it might help you in coming up with your own app ideas first of all I set a couple of criteria um to guide my decision process I a couple of things I don't want to do is to come up with something completely brand new that's not in the app store because that to me is the highest risk way of doing it because it's never been done it could either be a grand slam success or it could fail miserably um also I want to focus on a small idea because as a single developer or couple of developers small team it's really hard to build a big complex app and make sure that it's bugfree good user experience and all of that stuff and that really plays into the success of your app I think because the apps that tend to get good reviews tend to get repeating users coming back to the app end up rising in the App Store rankings which adds discoverability more people finding your app and then it's snowballs so I would rather have a smaller app that's very polished and very useful even if it's like very narrowly it only does one thing well I would rather have that than to have some brand new idea or a big app that is harder to polish and there's more testing involved okay so here's my criteria for coming up with an app idea again I'm not saying this is the only way to do it this is how I went about it so it has to be something that I'm interested in this is from experience if I'm not that interested in the topic of the app I it's really hard to get me to work on something that's just H my personal thing it's really hard to work on something if I'm not interested in it and I happen to be very interested in being Health productivity and just trying to live your best life or being the best that you can and exploring your human potential so that's the space that I'm thinking in because I know that if I can create an app on a topic that I'm interested in that I can actually use the app to benefit my own daytoday life that's a huge driver because I know that I can use use it even and it would be like I would be very happy with this app even if no one use it something I can do a little differently I think you need some a little differentiation from apps that are already out there it doesn't have to be a lot it could be design right it could be a little bit of gamification could be a little bit of um Improvement on what's already out there either Improvement or differentiation otherwise it's really hard to sell to Market the app as something that users would want right if it's the same as everything else why should the user download it something I can launch quickly I already talked about this I don't want to build a big complex apps that it's going to take me six months to build only to launch it and find out that I can't get users or no one wants it I want I would rather have a small little utility app that I can build in a week let's say and then just launch it in it's infantile prototype phase and have people use it and tell me what's wrong with it and like tively improve it that's what I would would want and that's the lowest risk I think because that allows you to also change direction very quickly and keeping in mind the last thing is that don't get too invested in this idea that I'm coming up with because in speaking with other successful app Developers it's never your first app or rarely your first app that's going to uh have any success it's going to take a few tries and it's very easy to get I think too invested in your initial idea you think it's going to be the best you're going to put so much uh energy behind it and then when it doesn't turn out like you expected to get so discouraged and then to give up completely I would rather keep this in mind and this sort of goes hand in hand with number three right if it it's a small app I can launch quickly if it doesn't work out I don't feel like I've lost too much time or energy and then I can just try something else so I think finding success in the App Store is about testing out a whole bunch of different ideas and see what sticks I've seen a company do a stretch a stretching app I guess it has exercises to help you stretch and gives you badges has a little bit of gamification and it was advertised by the App Store so it was featured which means that it's probably a pretty popular app and sure enough when I clicked into the app store listing it was pretty popular and then when I checked their developer profile I saw that they had a very similar stretching app that they launched a year before this popular one and when I checked that app store listing the apps looked almost similar so it that made me realize that sometimes it's just also luck timing right has to do with it and it might not be that your idea sucks it might just be the way that it's packaged doesn't resonate with the market at that time or something like that or maybe when you launched that for some reason the App Store didn't like it didn't R rank it highly and you didn't get users but maybe if you just take the same app and repackage it change the design perhaps and change the name relaunch it you might get some traction the second time that's number four keeping in mind that your first try may not be the one that is successful this is what I came up with the goal is a collection of apps because keeping in mind that one app we're not going to it's going to be hard to find success with one app so I want to already have the mindset I'm going to build be building multiple apps a collection of apps designed to work together and that's the part I'm going to get to this is the cool part I think for improving your daytoday physical and mental health through gamification reminders encouragement so all of these different things but I think the key Point here is collection of apps that work together and the goal of all of these types of apps as you can see is all having to do with wellbeing Health like physical health mental health productivity work that sort of stuff and as you can see all of these apps have been done there's nothing new here also take note that each of these ideas in itself is pretty simple what could be more simple than a streak counter and I I've even done tutorial videos on YouTube about this where you just tap a button and it adds one to your streak these are very simple ideas they all been done but if I were to do any of these single ideas I would have to add a little bit of differentiation or improve movement as I mentioned just now so I think there's still room I I I don't think there's ever no room for an app idea I I don't believe that because there are 10,000 app um water trackers on the App Store that there's no room for a better water tracker and better doesn't always mean more features right it could just be a better user experience it could be that you Incorporated a new Apple framework that just came out that other developers have haven't reacted to yet things like that there's always room for improvement these are very individual apps that help you with certain things what is this work together part that I mean what I mean by that is insights shared through data so I plan to have one user account across different across all the apps and by doing that you can share the data between different apps that allows us to draw draw insights and reveal to you how various aspects affect other aspects of your life such as does the practice of gratitude journaling or gratitude tracking improve your daytoday mood which is using this app or does getting more sleep improve your productivity as demonstrated by how many pomodoros you completed the very next day after getting 8 hours of sleep so I think a lot of the apps out there or a siloed right you sleep tracker because I want to get more sleep I want to get better sleep so you download a sleep tracker and then you might sleep eight hours and then get up the next day and oh I feel good this app is helping me but rarely do apps talk to other apps right so if by releasing all of these and and sharing that data because these would be all of our apps so we to have access to the data for all of these apps by using a single user account we can link your sleep data to your productivity data and um be able to tangibly show you that data be like hey did you know that every time you get seven hours of sleep or eight hours of sleep the next day you're just so productive and just surface the own data that you logged yourself but show it to you in a way that's oh yeah this is proof that is um the case so I should get more sleep I'll give you more of a reason to form better habits and this also I think once you experience that you'll want to download even more of these apps because the more you use the more data um you log into these apps the more insights the AI can reveal about your life and how which habits are really helping you and which habits aren't so much because it could be the reverse so let's say when you're logging four hours of sleep we could reveal the Insight hey every time you log 4 hours of sleep the next day your mood is foul you're in a really bad mood right if you're tracking your mood in your sleep so things like that's the working together part and then gamification reminders like all of these different aspects just help the single app aspect so we can add gamification to sleep tracker or to um a Pomodoro thing so maybe every time you finish a Pomodoro if you're not familiar with sorry I've been using this term but if you're not familiar with pomodora it's just a time management technique to stay focused while working so every time stay focused you might get some encouragement or like a little reward or something like that so these are aspects that would help individual apps that's what I said right there but yeah I think the cool thing is like the data in the insights when you add multiple aspects of your life and you try to look at that data as a whole you can begin to see patterns in your life and how how different aspects affect each other and I think knowing that is very powerful the app surfacing that knowledge to you is very powerful because you can actually um act on it and uh that's lifechanging so each app is useful on its own but together they provide a holistic picture of what's going on in your life and gives you tangible data to make decisions about how you want to live your daytoday life um yeah so we just started um thinking a little bit this is just like brainstorming all this whole document is brainstorming actually um nothing is really concrete but marketing some technical challenges how do we even start to analyze data and draw these conclusions and draw these patterns and things like that yeah insights engine we started just thinking about it so on the team is joash and inaki and JC that's actually almost all of our code with Chris team so we are working on this on the side in um addition to obviously creating the courses and that's actually more on me and supporting the the courses supporting the students however half of my goal is to create these useful products and actually try to make money from it because I think that's this is what makes it interesting and what people deem usually as successful app is how much revenue does it generate how many users does it have want to go through this exercise where we're treating this seriously learning about how to do App Store optimization and how to improve products and how to get user feedback and things like that I think that's a really cool thing for us to learn because that's not something we're super duper familiar with and the other half of my goal is to allow you guys to see how this process plays out because there's a lot of I don't think there's a lot of information out there where it is so transparent honest and real a lot of guides and articles say hey here are the 10 steps to build an app and I'll be honest we have a ton of those articles and videos as well but my goal with this is like I'm going to be recording these journals and sharing my thoughts and decisions with you as this progresses so you can really get a behind the scenes raw honest look at what it takes so I'm sure we're going to fail at a ton of things I'm sure we're going to make a lot of bad decisions but hey I think that's part of the process and we can learn about it together so anyways I I don't want to draw this out too long uh I will record Another journal entry when I have something else to share I hope this gives you a lot of ideas and um into the process of how you should approach building your own app and coming with your own app idea
