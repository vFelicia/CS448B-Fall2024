hey it's chris here and today i want to tell you about this thing that we're doing for the next three months called the three month app case study essentially we are going to try to build an app prototype get it launched into the store and get our first customer in three months now we've already started and this is day five of the experiment i'm going to be sharing the progress and the process on youtube and social media but before i get into what's happened in the last four days i want to tell you about why we're doing this and the motivation behind this whole experiment you see when i talk with the people who are learning with us i realize that a lot of people have app ideas that they want to build that they think are going to be a great success and you know it's not enough to teach people how to build the app but also you know how they can achieve success with the app this the same success that they're imagining that they will have once it's built but i realize that i don't have any experience in that regard when i used to build apps for clients at my old job we weren't invested in the outcome and there was no emotional investment in it either and now that i've started this process i'm learning so many different things because it's being approached from a different perspective right and i realized that it is a very emotional journey you're really invested in your idea and you really want it to succeed and there's moments where you really don't think it's gonna work and this is just the first four days so the motivation behind this again is a learning experience right so that i know what it's like to try to build a successful app and the reason that i'm documenting everything is so that people can learn from it and then also i can look back on it as well it'll be quite a journey so i want there actually to be two results that come out of this one is the actual three month app case study whether it is whether we meet our goal or not i still think it's going to be a great case study lots of lessons to be learned there but throughout that process i also want to put together a product framework the steps that we took to run our threemonth app case study and since we don't know what we're doing right now this framework is sort of a best guess and we're proving it through the case study and then we sort of tweak the framework as we go along all right so with that out of the way let's jump into what's happened so far in the last four days all right so what are we building what's the app idea here so to put it succinctly you know how there are app builders out there where you can put together an app without necessarily learning how to code night i realize the irony here um but there are companies like build fire and appy pie where you can put together an app without necessarily learning how to code and i feel like these things are on trend because with any sort of technology or anything really the barrier to entry is usually really high in the beginning and then as time goes on that uh barrier lowers so i i do think these app builders are low code or no code solutions are on trend and you can kind of see the same thing happening with websites for example back then it was really expensive to get a website built and not everyone had a website and these days it's so easy to set up you can even set up your own you know ecommerce stores with like wix squarespace shopify that sort of thing and a lot of people have websites now hosting is a lot cheaper so the barrier to entry has gone a lot lower you think about things like 3d printers and i recently heard that in this year's ces there was like a softserve ice cream maker that you can buy for your home use and you can put these pods in and could instantly have softserve ice cream for whatever flavor you want so anyways i think mobile apps will eventually get to that situation too where you don't necessarily have to learn how to code to build one so what is the difference between what we're doing and what these people are doing well i want to do this but for a very targeted audience so while these companies they i think you can see here they advertise all sorts of different apps and my thinking is that if i target and intimately get to know one group of people that our solution will be completely 100 tailored to their needs and so will be the goto solution for that target demographic the and that demographic that i'm choosing initially are youtubers um content creators like myself and that's because i i figure you know i know the audience i think i do and uh and in my mind you know it would be cool to have an app and as a content creator and entrepreneur i think that having your own branded app in the app store is is something that you'd want but for for me for code with chris at least it was never a priority however we actually do have an app in the app store by the way so shout out to david ravinsky chris parker and that team here at code with chris for putting this together um we never really talked about this app or told anyone about it and the reason for that was at that time we were still working on the swift ui 14 day beginner challenge and i wanted to wait to incorporate those lessons into the app instead of the ui kit lessons that it's now using um and so i wanted it to display those swift ui lessons before doing a big um sort of marketing publicity push but even though i haven't told anyone about it it's still getting like 90 downloads a day sorry a month which you know is surprising to me because i thought no one would know about it so it's coming up probably for terms like swift programming ios xcode code with chris so people are are finding it still through app store search so i just imagine like if i were to put you know a notice everywhere that we have a mobile app and you can download and use it that you know how much more exposure we could get with this so that's the idea initially to allow youtube creators to easily have their own branded app and they would be able to create an account configure some details upload their brand assets and they would have their own branded app now beyond just surfacing their content we would also add additional monetization features to that app that could potentially turn that app into a revenue stream for that content creator so while i was discussing with the team about what this app would look like um here are just some i wouldn't even call these wireframes but just some scribbles that i put together as we were having our meeting to discuss sort of what this would look like so imagine maybe a fictional youtube content creator named carly and she teaches yoga on youtube uh the basic app would be something like this where it would be a collection of her best content or maybe a learning path that you walk someone through um this basic experience might be categories of different types of poses and stretches and stuff like that and then people could watch the content by clicking into it and it would still be a very useful app right people looking for yoga or maybe searching her brand name would find this app and download it and you can optionally have a profile screen here and all of this would be configurable through the back end and in addition to that depending on how much time investment carly wants to put into this app there are additional monetization features that she could turn on such as maybe a recommended gear screen because i think if you're a content creator or an influencer or youtuber or whatever you get a lot of questions like what gear do you use um and i think that's a very warranted question when i explore a new topic that's what i think about as well what are the professionals or the people who are doing this daytoday what tools are they using right and you want good recommendations so um this is an opportunity for the content creator to recommend whatever equipment they might be using and they could potentially link to places that the user can go and buy this equipment and if those places offer let's say um referrals or affiliate uh links or whatever then that could potentially help the content creator earn more revenue for their business some people some content creators have merch right so this would be an opportunity to list some merch as well uh and then right here let's talk about the premium content first this sort of goes this is pretty easy to understand it's basically paywall paywall to content so if people are you know really liking your stuff here they might consider unlocking additional lessons or additional content through onetime purchase or subscriptions or something like that i think it'll remain to be seen what we want to allow the the youtuber to do so you can have locked content i think this is a pretty cool idea here would be personal advice or critique on certain things so if you are let's say a golf teacher or athletic trainer or fitness trainer or something like that where people can sort of have be able to pay to get a critique maybe the user can upload a record and upload a video or upload an image and then the content creator can also go through the app receive that request review the video and then record a critique and send it back to the user so then it becomes like a personal connection to that influencer or that content creator and this could be an additional source for them and obviously this is not super scalable for the content creator but for maybe a smaller content creator who doesn't have a lot of established revenue sources yet this could be a good way for them to basically monetize their expertise now this is sort of the basic idea and what we've done so far is we've reached out to a whole bunch of youtubers to try to get their feedback and see if they'd be interested in something like this so we have a monday board i want to show you here where we reached out to a variety of different youtubers and now you might recognize some of these names already and special shout out to hampton from hybrid hybrid calisthenics he's killing it on youtube and i've been following his journey he's a really friendly friendly guy these email addresses we found through the about tab and a lot of channels list their business email there so that you can submit business inquiries so we sent a whole bunch of emails out to a variety of youtubers in different niches and also different sizes because at this point we don't know which which nisha would respond the best who needs something like this and also what size of youtuber uh most identifies with this sort of solution and so that was maybe 24 hours ago we still haven't gotten any responses yet but seeing as how this is a timebound case study i think we will we will proceed even though we're not getting the feedback yet however if you were building your own product and you didn't you weren't constrained by time then i i definitely would recommend that you get the uh confirmation that you need before you proceed with building anything now i do want to mention that it's not just me working on this because that would never have been able to fly um i i'm just so busy running code with chris as a business producing content for the courses producing content for youtube and everything else that it leaves very little time for me to work on projects like this and so we do have a coop student an intern who is sort of leading the charge on this we're having discussions mostly every day and i'm sort of strategically driving the direction of it but in terms of the actual development and the work of it it's going to be mostly bowen and he's going he's doing a great job so far so props to him i want to talk a little bit about the emotional struggle that we've experienced even in the first few days because we sort of lost our way as we were brainstorming features uh as you can see here we were we started talking about content aggregation showing like social feeds and layering features on top of the normal youtube viewing experience like allowing users to like subscribe and interact with other fans gamification features leaderboards and and that sort of stuff and i started getting really discouraged because i had a really hard time seeing and visualizing why users would come back to this app and if this really would be helpful for the youtube content creators the initial idea i think it was trying to help youtubers grow their channel right and it just wasn't compelling enough but now i think we've arrived at a good place where it's not a solution for youtubers to grow their channel rather it's a solution that complements their business as an influencer at or as a content creator and one of the reasons why i went down this route is because in addition to what we've talked about so far i feel like it's a very flexible idea so youtubers might not end up being the right audience for something like this a lot of let's say businesses like restaurants or brick and mortar stores uh or ecommerce or shopify stores for example might want a mobile app where people can buy stuff or order stuff and so i think setting up this process where you know this infrastructure where someone can sign up for an account configure some stuff and then have it you know in the back in backend systems have it collect those assets and automatically generate an app bundle for them that can sort of be applied to different target audiences so if youtubers might not end up being the the right fit for this sort of solution then we can look to identify another market and furthermore um other side benefits are that like i really see this potentially being its own business right and i can also see clients who use this solution would want something custom they'll request something custom and unique for sure something that only applies to their scenario and so that also could potentially open up consulting opportunities for code with chris now this isn't something that we do right now just simply because the team we do we don't have enough uh people to support doing consulting projects and so but in the future like if we start getting a lot of requests from this like this spinoff business could generate um it could justify hiring people to to do to open up a code with chris consulting arm you know so that would be pretty cool um and the reason one other reason for a solution like this is because um i think selling to businesses might be a little easier when i think about myself as a content creator as an entrepreneur running a business i don't really hesitate to invest in a tool or a service if i think that it might help grow my business or increase my revenue because i'm thinking about it as an investment rather than a cost right and so i think working doing b2b might be a little easier than b2c right working with end consumers and that's just that's just what i'm thinking um so that sort of influenced going in this direction as well all right so that's what happened so far in days one to four to stay updated on the progress i think at the end of each week i'll be recording a summary like this if you want to follow more closely and get access to the project boards and see really the daytoday action then that's inside uh cwc plus you can join the case study and you can sort of get the the daybyday playbyplays and get the exact like email template that we reached out with and that sort of thing but you know even for youtube i'm going to be doing these end of week updates giving you sort of like a high level overview of everything that's happened the progress we've made decisions we've made and stuff like that and also pay attention to the stories so i haven't done a lot of stories with code with chris just because um i haven't committed to it to be completely honest with you i'm nervous about them i don't know why but i think that stories would be a great fit for this sort of ongoing case study to show uh daytoday progress so i'll be committing to doing stories and i'll publish the story on like youtube stories instagram stories facebook twitter maybe even tick talk if any of you guys use tick tock so let me know uh in the comment section below if you guys use tik tok i haven't never been on tech talk but i think some people are using it for educational content or journeys now so um and if i'm recording the story i might as well just publish it there so keep an eye out for the stories that i'll be uploading from day to day to tell you guys about the progress and what's happening each day and then look forward to these sort of end of week videos where i give a summary of what's happened over the week all in all i'm really excited for this case study and i'm fully invested in and i really wanted to succeed by the end of three months and yeah just thank you thank you so much for following along and watching this video to the end all right i'll see you guys in the next video bye for now
