hey everyone welcome to lesson 14 of how to make iphone apps with no programming experience in this lesson we're going to learn how to generate some random numbers and then we're going to integrate that into our project so that we're generating random cards and displaying The Associated card images Before we jump into the Xcode project let's get started with a playground so I'm just going to call this let's just call it random playground and I'm going to save it on my desktop there and it's actually very very easy to generate random numbers let me show you how so the function we're going to use is called arc for random and you you might get autocomplete you might not but if you do it's this one right here arc for random underscore uniform and then you're going to pass in and a whole number that is an upper bound okay so let's say 13 and that's going to generate a number between 0 and 12 just give the playground a chance to run and compile the code and you can see we have zero we can rerun the playground again actually just hitting Enter or you can hit stop playground and run it again and they'll generate a different number so now you can see it's ten here if I press run again it's going to generate another one too okay so you just learned about functions in a couple lessons ago and I want to point out that I mentioned there were instance functions which you call on an instance of a class right you you type in object dot and then the function that's associated with that class right so in our example we had the person class and then we had some functions associated with the person class and we would call the person object dot and then the function name and then you learned about class functions which aren't called on a specific object in said they're called on the class itself so we had something like the person class dot and then I think our our class function was called get average age or something like that right and in the instance one was something like when we created a new person object we assigned it to the variable a so then we would type a dot like update age or whatever that function was called right so this is your class function it's called on class and this is a regular instance function so you call that on an instance of an object in this case or in in that lesson we had assigned that object to the variable a okay so let's get rid of these two lines the reason why I pointed that out is because this function right here arc for random underscore uniform doesn't seem to be either of those right I'm not calling it on an instance of the object and I'm not calling it on a class either so what sort of function is this well it's part of the uikit libraries it's available to us because we've imported the uikit framework from here so if I comment that out you're going to see a Xcode complain about this function because it can no longer find it so these are special functions that are made available to us because of the uikit framework and we don't call it on any instance of the class or we don't call it as a class function another example of this would be print I showed you this earlier and you know print is a function where we pass in a string and then it prints it out into the console all right so another thing I want to show you is something that we're going to need to do in our project so let's take for example this test we're printing tests out on the console but what if I wanted to print out tests along with whatever number was generated in here so let's assign this into a variable so we can reference it later let's call this let's call it R and like that and now what we're going to do and how we can kind of insert this R and variable into this string is by doing something like this so type in backslash and then open a set of parentheses autocomplete might do something funny it's just flash there and just ignore that you want to close the parentheses or the round bracket and inside here you can type in your variable name so I'm going to put in R and there and what that does is it takes this string which we had as test and this is basically a shorthand for inserting whatever value you have in R and into the string so as you can see here it randomized number two and then what did it print out I print it out test space if I run it again yeah that's two again but let's let's give that another try okay nine so test nine so you can do this with another string or any sort of variable like that the reason why we're going to need to use this is because if you remember in our card asset library we named the assets like card two three four and so on what we're going to do is create that name dynamically using something like this so here I have cards 0 which we actually don't have and we're going to find out how to make sure it doesn't randomize 0 in when we get into our Xcode project but this is how we're going to generate our asset names see as I'm randomizing it I'm getting the different asset card names from the asset library okay let's jump into our Xcode project now I'm going to open recent and let's open our war card game project and now we're going to go into the view controller and I'm going to get rid of this print deal tapped and instead I'm going to type in a comment randomize left number so var left number equals arc for random uniform and we're going to put the upper bound a 13 right now but let's take a look at our asset library what do we have we have cards from 2 to 10 so for now I'm going to randomize between 2 to 10 in a couple lessons later I'll show you guys what are called arrays and we can include our Jack Queen and King and ace so now let's randomize between 2 and 10 so what I'm probably going to want to do is because I want it to start from 2 I'm going to add 2 to whatever number gets randomized so now this is going to randomize from 2 to 14 all right I'm going to do 8 right 7 know and do 9 so this randomizes from 0 to 8 and then I'm going to add 2 to it giving the range 2 to 10 so which is perfect for us okay so randomize left number from 2 to 10 ok and now we're going to assign not card 10 but remember we're going to want to pass in left number into here so let's use that special notation backslash open up a set of round brackets and in here I'm going to put in left number okay let's do the same thing with the right side but let me add a comment here set the left image okay randomize right number from 2 to 10 so far right number equals arc for random 9 plus 2 technically you could reuse your variable here instead of declaring a brand new one but just for the sake of clarity for you guys right now just splitting that up into two and declaring a new variable set the right image here we're going to want to set it to card backslash open up a set of brackets and pass in right number make sure you pass in right number not passing in left number again or else you're going to get the same cards so let's try this out I'll tell you about what those yellow lines are in a second okay so here goes when I click deal there we go we get random cards from two to ten and I think oh there was a two I'm just making sure that the range is two to ten all right so let's take a look at what these yellow lines are variable left number was never mutated consider changing to let constant so the word mutated basically means changed what it's saying is that after you set something into this variable left number you've never changed it ever since like you've never assigned something else into it so consider changing this variable instead to use a constant which is like a variable but once you set something into a constant you can't change it again so Xcode is detecting that hey you're not changing it after the first time you set something into it anyways why not just use a constant instead of a variable and it's a best practice always to use constants if you don't need to change the value and the reason for that is because it's more efficient and it's also helps when you're debugging things because you can rely on the fact that you know this isn't going to be changing so let's change these variables into constants very simply by changing var to let that's the keyword for a constant so let left number equals this and then from this point on because it's a constant I can't assign anything else into the left number as a constant so if I try to do something like this you know to assign something else into it Xcode is not going to like that because can't assign a value to left number because it is a constant and the fix that it suggests is changing the let back to a var since now it it thinks that I want to change it okay so this is our deal tapped function so far we're randomizing two numbers one for the left card one for the right card and we're displaying the appropriate image in the following lesson I'm going to show you guys how to include the ace Jack queen and king obviously we're going to have to do something a little different because right now we're assigning images based on the word card followed by a number and in our asset library the asset name is ace Jack queen and king alright stay tuned thanks for watching and I'll see you guys in the next lesson bye for now
