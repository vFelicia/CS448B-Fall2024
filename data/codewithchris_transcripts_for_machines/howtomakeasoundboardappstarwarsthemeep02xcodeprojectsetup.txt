hey coders how's it going hope you guys are having a great morning so far and today we're going to start on our soundboard app so what I'm going to do first is create a brand new xcode project we're also going to want to download the sounds but we're going to get to that in a little bit so let's create a single View application and I'm going to call this the soundboard demo and make sure that the language is Swift that's the most important thing uh devices iPhone for me and these options are all unchecked I'm also not creating a git repository I'm just going to save this on my desktop now the next thing we're going to want to do is visit that link that I specified in the last lesson and I'll link to it in the description below as well but it brings you to this page and you're going to want to download a bunch of sounds now uh whether it's mb3 or wave I think both are fine with the AV Audio player but with the implementation that we're going to do you're going to want to stay consistent so what I mean is if you're going to download waves then download all of them as waves if you're going to do MP3s then do all of them as MP3s so I chose four sounds right here as you can see on my desktop and that's the lightsaber the Blaster firing Chewbacca Roar and Darth Vader breathing and they're all wave files okay so make sure that if you're downloading the sounds just make sure they're all MP3s or they're all wave files and and that's simply due to how we're going to implement it it's not a technical limitation now point out why we have to download all of one kind um as we're writing the code okay so make sure you have all of your sounds downloaded and now we're going to import it into our project what I'm going to do here is right click or hold down control and left click if you have a one button Mouse I'm going to create a new group and I'm going to call this sounds now a group isn't an actual folder in your project directory so if I go to my project directory now uh desktop soundboard demo you're going to see that there's no actual sound folder created it's just a a logical group it's to organize the files in your excode project and it doesn't translate to how it actually looks in here if you do want it to translate to an actual folder here what you can do is you can create the actual folder in the soundboard demo and then you can drag the folder in to the xcode project so let me show you uh so first of all I'm going to put these four sound files into this new sound folder which I created inside my project and then I would physically drag this folder into the xcode project and then here it would create folder references okay like that and it's going to be a blue folder so I accidentally put it into this group but you kind of get the idea so this blue folder means that it directly correlates to a folder in your project while these yellow folders are just groups so I'm actually going to delete this uh I'm just going to remove the reference so I don't want to remove all the sounds so what I usually do because I like keeping them as groups uh I would create the folder in my project folder and add the Sounds here but then I wouldn't Drag The Sounds folder into the project I would simply drag the files okay so I would create a new group called sounds then I would create the folder in my project directory I would add the sounds to that but then I would actually just drag these files into this group right here and I'm going to choose create groups uh that's fine I don't need to copy the items into my project because they're already in my project and I'm just going to create groups like that and I click finish and then I have all these files underneath the sound folder and then finally let me show you another way of doing it so let me just move these files back back to the desktop let me delete this sound folder which I created let me delete this okay so we're kind of starting back at the state we were back in so this is the easiest way to do it just create a new group called sounds and then drag these wave files or MP3 files straight from the desktop or wherever you Sav them and drag them into your new group and then down here uh make sure it says create groups and check this copy items if needed because it's going to copy the wave files from the your desktop or wherever you saved it into your project folder because you want to keep everything together so check this off uh make sure this is checked you want to make sure that the sounds will be added to your Target and click finish and then now you have these sounds and what it did is it just made a copy of those wave files in your root project directory uh and these files right here in your project are referencing these guys so you can feel safe to delete them off your desktop wherever you save them so now okay that's probably the easiest way to do it but if you're going to have a ton of files you're going to have like images sounds and all that then I would recommend you creating some sort of organization within your project folder uh okay but otherwise both ways work fine so now we have the Sounds in our excode project we're just going to really quickly set up um our storyboard here so as you saw in the previous video they were all just kind of a bunch of buttons so I'm just going to drag four buttons here like that doesn't matter where you put them I'm just kind of aligning them because what we're going to do is we're going to hold down command and click all of them so you make sure they're all highlighted and then you're going to click this one called put in a stack view or just stack it's going to put them all into a stack view element uh and then let's open up the document Outline by clicking this little icon down here click your stack View and then go down here let's add some constraints and I'm simply going to horizontally and vertically Center it add these two constraints we're going to update the frames furthermore uh click the stack View and then on the right hand side in the property inspector for the spacing I'm going to put 50 and that's just going to space them out a little bit like that and then I'm going to vertically update all the frames again like that so it places it there and then now I'm going to change the button text so this one was uh's lightsaber Blaster firing chewy Roar and Darth Vader okay and now I'm just going to update all the frames again and now let's give it a run all right so now we have all of our buttons they don't do anything right now but I just wanted to verify that they were positioned correctly so your demo right now should look kind of like this as well so that was quick and easy right and you know what the cool thing is we're actually halfway there in the next video I'm going to show you how easy it is to to play a sound in your project using AV Audio player uh and we're also going to hook up these buttons to play those sounds so I look forward to seeing you guys tomorrow thanks for watching and please don't forget to subscribe like and share this with your friends and family I would really appreciate it so thank you so much I'll see you tomorrow bye
