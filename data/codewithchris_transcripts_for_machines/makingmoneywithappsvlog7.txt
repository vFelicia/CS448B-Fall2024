hello and welcome back so the app design for our mood Tracker app is finalized and development Sprint number three is underway so I'll show you what the design looks like and I'll talk about the Sprint in this Vlog but just in case you're new here this series is raw and unscripted and I share our team's journey in building apps for profit this Vlog entry is dated February 14th 2024 with all that said I hope you enjoy hello welcome so in the last Vlog I showed you this design that I had to come up with and just to jog your memory or in case you're joining new here the original mood Tracker app that we were trying to build looked like this and this was me just asking our lead designer to design something it wasn't exactly what I had in mind but then again I didn't tell my designer what I had in mind so that's the first mistake and because I didn't have a clear picture of what I wanted and so the lesson for you is if you are going to ask a designer to to do something for you you have to be pretty explicit and you have to know what you want I think a client that doesn't know what they want is probably the worst thing for any sort of consultant or designer so I decided to take a crack at it to try to get in my head onto paper I use this photo as a reference for the feeling that I was trying to evoke and I I did something like this I want to like a cozy a cozy warm type of feeling of using this app so I used a lot of Browns like Earth Tones and things like that I also used a lot of nonstandard things as I as I later realized when JC did his design based off of this okay so once I came up with this I asked JC okay now looking at this do you understand what I'm trying to go for and so he took this and ran with it and redesigned all the screens based off of this feeling and emotion and this is what he came up with so you can see that it's a mixture between the first version and my version and what I actually really appreciate about this is the fact that it looks more of an app that you would see in the App Store what do I mean by that it's hard to put your finger on it like when I was designing this I thought oh this would be good here this would be good here and overall I was pretty happy with it but when I saw how JC went about the design I was like this looks like a professional app because it's using standard controls for example the tab bar and these icons up here if you look at just this screen like this entry screen like this notice this back to top right here and this plus button versus what I had here so if you look at this design right here you will see a stark difference I think that you'll understand what I'm saying if you look at this screen right here versus this screen right here this screen right here this just looks more of an app that you would see in the App Store that you would launch or use on your phone versus something that like this that sort of doesn't look like an iPhone app right it looks now to me it looks a little bit amateurish so it was hard to put my finger on it when I was designing it so anyways I'm pretty happy with it okay so let me walk you through some of the interactions so when you have a bunch of mood entries you we didn't figure out how to edit or delete entries and this is what we came up with so when you tap on an entry you essentially drill down and you can delete it rather than launching you into the logging flow which asks you these questions one by one so we thought okay for example if let's say you just wanted to edit who you were with you would have to walk through step one step two step three step four to get there just to change that option so we came up with this solution which was to allow the user to swipe any one of these properties you could say and edit it and it would launch you into that specific mood entry screen so to to let you make a different selection and so that's how you would edit an entry the other thing is the calendar so the calendar we I identified something pretty funny here that I didn't understand before so my original idea was to use a circle to indicate days that you have logged something and a DOT to indicate that this is the current date so we looked at another example sorry another design where instead of a big circle you would have a little dot if you logged something on that day so you'd end up with a calendar of a lot of little dots here but it didn't feel right because it didn't and it again this was something that was really hard to put my finger on it didn't give the feeling of satisfaction I'm comparing this to like a fitness workout app when I'm logging a workout on that day it feels like a win to me and a big juicy circle around that day that I can clearly see indicates it gives me this feeling of achievement of satisfaction and then when I see a month full of fat circles it feels like I did a lot that month and so that wasn't something that I had been a I wasn't able to identify when I was designing it but then after looking at the alternative of just like having a little indication that there was something logged on that day I realized something was missing so I told JC like I really need a huge indication that something was done on that day because looking at a calendar full of green circles for example it lets me know that hey I've put in a lot of work and I feel good about that so that was a cool real realization about the this log entry screen let me walk you through this so a couple of the interactions we were unsure about we figured out as well so for example originally I had something where if you tap on an option it moves you to the next screen right away so tapping good just zooms you over here tapping overjoy zooms you and I like that because it was quick and it was fast but it didn't allow for certain types of interactions such as pinning a mood let's say I always want to use this mood I want to pin it to the top yeah what we decided would be better was to let the user Make a selection and then have buttons for them to go to the next screen then the user probably feels a little more in control because you can choose one think about it change your mind choose another change your decision and then hit the green button to move on to the next screen you could always use the back button to go back you can always cancel to say hey I actually don't want to log a mood at all we also simplified it because before logging a custom mood like this my idea was that when you type in a custom mood here and you somehow hit save or whatever it would create a a button here for your custom mood so that you can use this in the future so in this design what we're doing is just allowing you to type whatever you want as your mood as a custom mood and then go on to the next screen but it wouldn't save this necessarily for the next time at least I don't think so in this design it looks like it will save it let me reconfirm that so if you confirm sorry if you cancel we have dialogues because you have made some progress on your entry up till this point so we do want to confirm with the user and also a tap and hold interaction is used for pinning a certain mood to the top or maybe deleting a custom mood I think yeah or maybe removing it from a pinned section we're asking about the weather this is what the button looks like for the location services and they'll allow you to use the location who are you with what were you doing where are you of course you don't have to log all of these things we you can log just as as much or as little as you want and hit save and it will save your mood okay so based on this design which is a lot more finalized than what we had before what we had to do is go back to the drawing board in terms of planning the Sprints and reestimate everything based on the new design luckily we did some work already in the first two sprints that we can reuse so not All Is Lost but based on these story points which is an estimation of effort we are going to plan Sprint three working on this app is not our fulltime thing we're also supporting students through our training programs and things like that we are only allocating each person eight story points per 2E Sprint so that's where we're at right now I'm excited to see this come more to fruition and now that we have a solid place to start from it's not a changing design I think we can make some real progress so stay tuned and I will update you guys next time thanks for watching
