hey guys what's up it's Chris and this is the first video of my new content schedule in this video I'm going to show you guys uh what we're going to be building together over the next approximately 2 weeks uh this is a project which I built about a year ago maybe a year and a half ago now in Objective C but when we build it together uh we're going to do it in Swift the new programming language from Apple and it's basically a YouTube app how fitting right uh it's built to display YouTube videos which you can configure in a pist or basically uh a data file that is included in the project so I'm going to launch it right now on the simulator to show you guys what we're going to be building okay so at the core of the project is a scrollable list of videos so in this particular configuration uh these videos are from Trump's YouTube channel and Trump is a guy who plays Hearthstone a game made by blizzard he's actually quite popular in that Community quite well known um and he has really informative videos and entertaining videos so I decided to configure this app for his channel so on the left hand side you can open up a menu and you can scroll through a bunch of different playlists when you click that playlist it's going to change the videos that display here on the main scrollable screen uh and when you click into it you you get uh the video details so I'm going to have to level with you guys here this app isn't particularly geared towards beginners because there's a lot of things that are happening here which are which might be quite confusing if you're brand new to programming with iOS uh for instance all these videos in this scrollable list they're dynamically parsed from his channel it downloads a feed from his channel and parses the videos and the images and shows it here so it's Dynamic so when he uplo a video it's going to show here but that sort of feed parsing and feed downloading may be a little difficult for beginners so I'm probably going to show two versions I'm going to do a a basic type app where maybe you have to specifically put in the videos that get shown uh and then after I do that I'll create a I'll create a couple more videos for those that want to challenge themselves and try their hand at parsing the YouTube feed and getting the data d dynamically so there's going to be something for everyone and I'm also going to try to go slow and explain Concepts which I think are new to you guys and if any of you guys who are watching are students of my how to make an iPhone app with no programming experience course then I'm sure you guys will have no problem following along and implementing this howto series before we begin I highly recommend that you go to my channel page scroll down and go through this series how to make an iPhone app with no programming experience first it's about 17 lessons long but it's going to give you a at least a foundation for the terminology that I will be using and some of the concepts which I explain in uh video 910 uh those who are going to give you the basics of the objectoriented programming that I won't have time to explain as I'm going through building the YouTube app and plus all of this Auto layout size class stuff will also be useful so I highly recommend that you go to my channel page page just type into your address by youtube.com/ codewithchris and you'll get to this page and then scroll down um and look for this playlist right here and go through the first 17 lessons first and that's going to make it a lot easier for you to go through this YouTube app series okay so let's get started by creating our xcode project here I've got xcode open and it's worthwhile to do a quick check to see what version you're using because if your version of xcode differs uh you may experience different results when trying to follow the tutorial so right here I'm using 7.1.1 so as long as you're using 7 something you should be okay now what I'm going to do is Click create new xcode project if you don't have this welcome window don't worry you can always go up here you can click about xcode to see what version you're using and then you can go to file new project to also launch a new project which is what I'm going to do right now so here make sure that you're selecting application under iOS and let's start with a single View application which is going to start us off with our default basic app with only a single view next we have our project properties I'm going to call this uh YouTube app and for the organization name you can just put your name or your company if you have one identifier usually you're going to do Dot and then either your name or your company name and together with the product name you're going to have a unique ID for your app now this is very important this drop down right here select Swift and for devices select iPhone we won't be doing this for iPad and then just make sure all of these are unchecked because we won't be using any of these features now click next and then I'm going to save this on the desktop as for Source control you can leave that un checked as well all right so now we have our default um xcode application I'm going to quickly go through all of these files on the left hand side in this file navigator for the benefit of those who haven't really worked with xcode before so the first screen you have is presented uh to you is the project properties and if you click this little blue uh node here the root node here this is what you're going to see your project properties we don't need to configure anything for this right now instead we're going to click into the app delegate do Swift so this file basically is the entry point for your app it allows you to handle a couple of um events you can add some code to execute before it enters the background or um this one actually is after it did enter the background this is when it will come back to the foreground you know when you're switching in between apps uh and so on and so forth so this app delegate. Swift is just a file which gives you a place to put some code to handle these events now we're going to quickly jump over to the main. storyboard and here is let me just expand these noes here this view is our single View and you can see this gray Arrow right here denotes that this is the starting view for our application so in here um when you go main. storyboard this interface is what's called interface Builder so here you're going to select all of these elements you're going to drag buttons and text uh sliders and so on and you're going to put it onto the view if you don't see this Library make sure that you've got this button selected which opens up the uh this is what's called the inspector Pane and then down here if you don't see these elements make sure that you've got this tab T selected the object Library um and only in the storyboard with the object Library are you going to see these it doesn't matter if you see something like this because you can click this little icon here to change the view uh okay so when you add elements onto this view how do we control the elements how do we add code to it uh well there's another file called the viewcontroller.swift and just like its name implies this viewcontroller . Swift class is responsible for powering the view in the main. storyboard handling user events responding to them processing logic and stuff like that so we will be working a lot in this viewcontroller.swift file um next we have assets. xcassets and this is what is known as our asset Library so here we can add all of the images that we are going to use for the application and and if you've built an iPhone app before you may know that for any particular image asset you're going to have different versions for retina nonretina and even for the iPhone 6 Plus larger screens where you're going to be using 3x so the asset library is a good way for you to manage your assets then we have the launch screen. storyboard which gives you another interface Builder type of screen to configure your launch screen um this is what's going to be shown before your view in the main. storyboard so this is an opportunity for you to uh customize what that looks like as well and lastly we have the info. pist which is kind of like a configuration file for the application okay so that's where we're going to end off today I want to thank you for learning with me and if you're enjoying the series so far I would really appreciate it if you give me a like subscribe and share it with your coworkers and Friends okay I'll talk to you guys tomorrow bye
