hello everyone it's Chris here and in this video I'm going to address a common beginner question that I receive and that is the student opens up their project expecting to see user interface elements on their storyboard but they don't see anything it's all empty and it's all blank now if you're starting the project for the very first time then it's going to be blank because we haven't done anything to it yet but if you worked on this project previously and you added elements to the storyboard you would expect to see something there the next time you open up the project so let's take a look at the document outline where it lists all the elements on your storyboard or on your view and see if they're there so if you don't see this sidebar that's going to be right here with a listing of all your elements click this tiny icon on the lower left corner show document outline right and then instantly you'll see this sidebar here so expand this go to the view and you can see that we actually do have a bunch of user interface elements here but they're all grayed out background scroll view this label with the 20 on it and furthermore we have constraints and they're all grayed out too if you don't know what constraints are I suggest that you go through the beginner lessons where you'll get a chance to use them and learn about them okay so now let's address why we can't see any of these elements there's this button down here and this button is to set the size class that you're working in so sometimes when you open up the project it goes back to any width and any height and whereas previously maybe you were working with you know a very specific size class in this project I know it's a landscape project and when we built it we were working in the any width and compact height size class so I'm just going to select that and when I select that size class you'll see that change to any width and compact height and now all of my elements are not grayed out and can see them so what are size classes just a quick note on them it's something that allows you to add constraints and elements to a specific orientation or a specific class of screen sizes which is why they're called size class when it goes to the any width and any height you know if you're adding elements into here into this size class that means that no matter what screen size the user is viewing your app on these elements will be shown in our case we were working with this any width and compact height you can see there's some text below the base values label it says for all compact height layouts iPhones in landscape so because I intended this one to be a landscape iPhone app only displayable in this orientation then we were specifically working in this size class but sometimes when you open up the project again and you know it jumps back to the any with any height size class which explains why all of this stuff is grayed out here so just make a note of that and if you open up your project again and you don't see any of your elements open up your document outline check that there are grayed out elements and then go back and see what size class you're using before and then just change the size class back to that and you should get all your elements back and just a quick note while we're here if you say you added an element to this specific size class but now you want to include it in a different size class you can select your element like I have here selected the background and then if you go over to this inspector pane on the right here if you don't have this click this icon this icon will reveal this go into the it's one of these tabs this one right here and down here you'll see that this background element is installed for the any width and compact height you can see there's a checkmark under installed and if you want to install it into a differ one you can click the plus you know you can select a different different one let's say any width regular height and you can check that off and this background now will be installed for the any width regular height so you check let's change the size class so that any width regular height that's this one right here and you can see our background shows up because here we specify that it's installed for that and likewise you can click this X to exclude it from that size class so size classes are some powerful stuff that warrants further videos and how to utilize them but in this video I just wanted to show you guys what to do if you're expecting to see elements in your storyboard and you don't alright thanks for watching and I'll see you guys next time
