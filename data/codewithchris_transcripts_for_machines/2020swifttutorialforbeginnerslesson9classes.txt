hello and welcome to my Swift tutorial series for beginners in this lesson you're going to be introduced to classes which is a highly critical part of the Swift programming language now I'm gonna warn you it's a little bit of an abstract concept but I'm sure you'll do fine alright let's get started so in this playground here I have several pieces of information I've got three variables actually two of them are strings one of them is an int datatype remember back in lesson 2 of this series I talked to you about several common data types and I just mentioned in a brief like one second sentence that you can create your own data types well now we've arrived at that point and what we're going to talk about our classes and you can think of it as a way to organize your information now I know we talked about functions and that was a way to kind of group pieces of code together well when you think about classes you're moreso thinking about information so for example in this scenario I have a name I have a salary and I have a role well you can see where this is going all of these different variables or pieces of information have to do with a person or an employee or something like that so what we can do is we can group this information together into our own new data type called employee and in order to do that we define a new class called employee let's take a look at the syntax involved so you start with the class keyword followed by a space and then your class name in this case we would call it employee followed by space and then you have a pair of curly brackets inside your curly brackets is where you would define your class let's jump back to the playground and define our employee class so you start with the class keyword followed by space and then employee followed by space and then we have our set of curly brackets so in between those curly brackets you would put all of the pieces of information that an employee would have so why don't we take this information up here I'm gonna cut it and I'm gonna paste it inside of our employee class but one thing to keep in mind is that you're not defining the information for a single employee because remember we are creating a new data type here called employee so this is a general definition that you can use over and over again instead you're specifying what sort of information every employee should have so we don't fill out the specifics now we just say that an employee data type should have a name it should have a salary we could start at zero and fill it in later and let's say for role it should be a string type as well and by just specifying two quotes with nothing in between them it's just an empty string so just like that you've defined your new class which is essentially a new data type it's called employee and every single employee is going to have a name a salary and a role now here's the part that is going to get really tricky and you really have to wrap your head around that and that is that your class that you've defined right here is kind of like a template so now that we've defined this class how do we use it well let me show you some examples with some previous data types that we've worked with before first so let's say we have a equals 10 and let's say we have B equals Ted and that will suffice so what's happening here with this line essentially we are creating a piece of data 10 right it's going to be stored in memory and then we are creating a constant called a to keep track of that data in memory same thing happening right here Ted is a piece of string data that we are creating in memory and then we are creating a constant called B to keep track of that data in memory now the same concept applies here with our new data type we're going to create a new employee in memory and then we are going to create a variable or constant called C let's say to keep track of that employee in memory so let me show you how to create a new employee in memory well all you have to do is write the class name followed by two parentheses like that and by writing the statement here we are creating a new employee data in memory so why don't we create a new constant and assign it to that constant now this employee data that you've created in memory is called an object also known as an instance of the class in this case that is an instance of the employee class so let me show you just to drive home that this is your own custom type when you create a constant a that would be like that you know you're defining the data type of the constant right and this would be that now a and B are really simple data types right integer and string however C is your custom type right it's employee and inside contains this sort of data here and right now it's all it's set to these default values which you have specified but we can actually access that data inside of the employee and we can set and we can also get that data and the way we do that is using something called dot notation so let me show you how it works so down here since we've created a new employee object and assigned it to C let us change this to var actually because we will probably be modifying it so we write C which points to our employee object and we hit dot on our keyboard and that lets us access all of that data inside of the employee class so we have name we have role we have integer so why don't we set the salary to a thousand or first yeah let's do that and then I can show you print C dot salary and you can see that it says a thousand right there I can also set the other pieces of data like that you know something like that now another cool thing about defining your own data type using in class like that is that in addition to specifying what sorts of pieces of data it should have you can also define functions in here yes you can write F UNC space let's say do work right if you forget this is how you define a basic function here and I'm just gonna print I'm doing work or something like that and then let's say because they are doing work we are going to increase his salary by one doing work gets you noticed by your boss which results could result in a promotion and you would get more salary so that's at least my kind of thinking right now so let's say that that's the case how would I execute this function if I just try to call the function do work like this it's not actually going to be recognized because this function is part of my employee class I would actually have to call this function on an object of that class because I've created an employee object right here and assigned it to see I can actually do C using dot notation now and you can see that I can access this function actually why don't we change our print statement here and insert the name let's say but why would you refer to yourself in the third person it's doing work how about hi my name is and I'm doing work I don't think I'd hire someone like this who refers to some themselves like that let's see what happens okay all right it's running all right hi my name is Tom and I'm doing work so that's pretty cool now I want to show you something else so I'm going to define another employee and create another employee object in memory and I'm going to set this process name to Sarah and let's say Sarah is a same manager VDOT salary equals do with that oh this is an integer and I am going to say d dot to do work now you'll notice that C and D are two separate employee objects when I'm modifying the data for D it doesn't affect C and viceversa and when I call the do work function on D it has nothing to do with the do work function for C so that's a basic introduction of how to use classes so one last thing I want to mention is that when you declare a function inside of a class it's actually called a method of that class and these variables that you're defining inside your class are called properties of that class and also I want to point one thing out is that notice I can access salary from inside my function and that is because it's declared up here all right so properties and methods when there are inside classes now there's a lot more to classes but I just wanted to introduce them to you in this video I hope you can see why classes are a fundamental building block to organizing your information now in the next lesson we're going to take classes
