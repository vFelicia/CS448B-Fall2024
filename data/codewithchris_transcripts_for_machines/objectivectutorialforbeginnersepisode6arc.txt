hey guys welcome to episode 6 of learn objectivec and today we're going to be talking about automatic reference counting otherwise known as arc yay okay so this is the project that we had from the last episode on memory management and I've just colored it with some comments here to remind you guys about what's going on so just the quick recap I allocated a new instance of my class here and then I declared a second variable and assigned it that instance as well and I called release on it which would decrement the counter by one and this retain statement incremented by one and then I can still use my second reference variable because the retain counter is the one who hasn't been deallocated yet but then here in this last statement if I forget to release it then that object would get stranded and it would have a memory leak so with all of these you know retain releases you can see how prone it is to error and we're only looking at one method wait till you start passing objects around to other methods and you know stuff like that so with iOS 5 apple introduced arc or automatic reference counting and that saves you from having to write all of these retaining release statements what happens behind the scenes is actually when you compile your app all of those retain and release statements get dynamically injected into your code so it's not a garbage collection system don't think of it like that mark merely saves you from having to write all of the retain and relief statements so why don't we go ahead now and kind of set up the same project but ark enabled and we can see what the difference would be okay so let's create that new project so I go file new project I'd created a single View application before and I'm going to call this one what we call the other one memory management it's called this one arc so all you have to do to make your project ark enabled is make sure that this box is checked off use automatic reference counting I'm just going to create a new folder for it okay so we've got our new project so let me start by creating a my class and then what did we have in here before we had a method called do something which I am going to put back up wrong file should be doing it in the header file and then here in the implementation file I had all of this stuff so all of that remains the same dialogue still gets called so with our queen ever have to call the parents dialogue method it actually does it for us so I can safely remove the statement but I could still have this dialogue method override and I can still provide custom code in here alright so let's go in the implementation file for the view controller so we started off by importing my cloths and then we created you know what so you guys don't have to watch me type I'm going to copy and paste it from here and just modify the code so first of all and an ark enabled project remember that the retain and release statements get injected for us so we don't actually have to call any of it we will need square brackets here and that's it so contrast this project that we built in ark vs the other project where we managed memory manually and you can see how much of a help arc is so I want to make one thing clear when I say that arc was introduced in iOS 5 that does not mean that you can't build apps targeting you know iOS four and below all that means is that if you want to use dark you got to be building your app on iOS 5 SDK or greater and if you're just starting out with iOS development that shouldn't be a problem because if you download xcode these days you're gonna have I OS 6 SDK preinstalled all right now for your fact of the day so these days it seems that Apple and Samsung are the two big smartphone manufacturers you know with Samsung in their galaxy series and iPhone well with their iphones but what's ironic is that Samsung actually manufactures some of the parts that make up the iphone so the the retina screen and the processor found in your iphone is actually manufactured by samsung well who woulda guessed so who you guys think about that let me know in the comments section below all right I'll talk to you guys later you
