hey guys welcome to another episode of code with Kris and today we're going to be talking about the Xcode project navigator okay so I just want to remind you guys that the Navigator area is this pinkish section to the left here now let me bring up Xcode and this project is in the link below you can either start your own project or you can download the one in the link and follow along but we're gonna be going over the Navigator area here so you can see this bar with all these icons at the top is the Navigator selector bar there's actually several different you know things you can navigate but we're gonna focus on the first icon which is the project navigator where you're gonna see all the files for your project now in this view you're gonna see four different things you're gonna see projects which is this blue icon right here that indicates a project and you can have multiple Xcode projects in a single Xcode workspace the next thing is groups which are these yellow folder looking icons but I want to make one thing clear is that these are not representative of the actual folders on your filesystem so let me pull up my finder and you can see here that this is the project I'm looking at through Xcode this folder structure is not representative of of these files I can move these files around within my my within my project navigator and it will not affect the actual files sitting on my filesystem now the second thing you can at the third thing you can have are actual folder references and those are indicated by blue icons now that will actually map to something on the file system so let me give you an example of that for example if I dragged this folder from finder over and I said create folder references references instead of group then it's gonna show me that this is a folder reference now there are pros and cons to either doing groups or folder references and I'm gonna go through that in the next video when we talk about adding files to the solution so I'm gonna remove that for now and the last thing you can have in this project Navigator are files so you know these are your files right here so that's it for this video we went over what we can expect to see in the project navigator and Xcode and let me leave you guys with the fun fact did you know that multitasking was only available as of iOS 4 and the question I'm gonna leave you guys off with is did you own the very first generation iPhone and if you did do you remember what it was like before multitasking was available let me know in the comment section below and I'll see you guys next time you
