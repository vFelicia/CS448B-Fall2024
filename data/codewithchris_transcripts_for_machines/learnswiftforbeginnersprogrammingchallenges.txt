hi it's Chris here so you've just gone through all of those in the learn Swift for beginners series now there's 17 in total so far and although there's a lot more to learn with Swift programming you do know a lot already to be dangerous and to do quite a bit with it so in this video I'm going to introduce to you three programming challenges that you can do today just using what you've learned so far and they're very very doable so don't shy away from them and they're going to help you reinforce what you already know help you identify things that you might not have grasped and furthermore it helps you memorize all of the syntax and the structure of the programming language all the key words and things like that I tell you this from firsthand knowledge because when I learned iOS programming I just read a book front to back and when I try to build something I realized that I couldn't remember a lot of what I read so it wasn't until I started typing things out hitting roadblocks and you know actually physically typing it out did everything start to glue and meld together in my mind so these exercises are going to help you do that and furthermore once you complete these three challenges you can get your name and a link to your Twitter profile listed right here below this section in our wall of same now right now there's nobody because I'm just launching this page today and all you have to do is complete the three challenges up here and then you're going to click this blue button to tweet this out and proclaim your victory and also to notify me so I'm going to add your name manually down here and you will be immortalized on this learn Swiss two page so the URL for this page is in this description below if you're watching this on YouTube or if you're already on this page then you just need to scroll down the URL as code with Chris calm slash learn Swift okay now I'm also going to quickly go through the three challenges with you just to introduce them and to tell you what you have to do or you can just go ahead jump to the page right now and download these files because there are instructions in each of these files okay so let's just hop into the first playground here you're going to need Xcode in order to complete these challenges so for challenge one you've got two arrays with a bunch of strings in each array and what I want you to do is to write a function that accepts a single string parameter and this function is going to output true or false if the input string is in either of the two arrays then return true if the input is not in any of the arrays is not in both of the arrays at all then returns false so here are two examples if it's cat then you would return true because it's here if it's cow cow is in neither of these arrays so you're going to return false okay so you might have to go back and review the syntax to write a function and to write parameters and such but it's going to be good practice for you okay so here's the second one it's going to get a little bit harder with each one so this one I'm giving you a class called string caterpillar and I want you to implement the add function and the goal function so the add function takes in a piece of text and what you're going to do is you're going to store that piece of text every time add is called and this piece of text gets passed and you're going to store that piece of text somehow and then when someone calls the goal function you're going to output all of the pieces of text that have been added by this add function you're going to output them all in one line using a print statement so this is the code statements that are going to get executed you don't have to edit any of this all you have to do is you know you're going to be completing this part right here this class definition so given this code declaring a new string caterpillar object and then adding H adding e ll oh and then call and go the expected output down here in the console would be hello and then there's some bonus credit if you want to create a custom initializer that where you can pass in a string so you can read about that okay so the third one is right here and this one's a little more complicated so what we have here we have a person class you don't need to do anything with this it's got a name property and you've got a book class it's got title and author you don't have to do anything with this class either but what you do have to do is you have to implement this class called library so this library has got two dictionaries okay so one dictionary here is the library catalog so it's got this book ID and then adds a key and then the value is an actual book right and the book object obviously has a title and an author so here's another book that's the book ID and that's the book object with the title and the author and then we've got another dictionary that so far is empty the key is a string it's going to be the book ID and the value is a person object which represents the person who has checked out that book and I want you to implement a couple of functions here a few the first one is search by title you're going to pass in a title of a book now that's not the book ID okay that's the actual title and you have to implement this code which checks for several things so first of all if the book ID is not or sorry the book title is not in the catalog at all if it doesn't exist in this catalog dictionary then you return the string not in catalog now if it is in the catalog and it's available then you return the string available and if it is checked out by someone then you put checked out by and then the name so this you're not going to put n AME here you're going to put the actual name of the person that exists in this property right here remember you do have this dictionary which contains you know the person object that's checked out so you're going to have to check both dictionaries that's a little hint for you and next you're going to implement two other functions check out and check in okay so pretty selfexplanatory here again if the book doesn't exist in the catalog you shouldn't be able to check it out so you're going to return the string book doesn't exist if the book is currently already checked out and it it does exist in the catalog then you're going to return error book already checked out and finally if the book is in the catalog and it is available as in it's not checked out by anybody yet then you're going to return successfully checked out you're going to actually add the person to the dictionary and well I don't want to give too much away but that this is essentially what you want to output given this case and check in similar I'm not going to go through it pretty much the opposite of check out you're going to be returning the book and again that's all all your editing is this stuff in the library class definition you don't have to modify anything below here this is just the the sample statements and the expected output so here we're going to declare a new library we're going to declare to borrowers Curious George and Mark Twain and then there's going to be a bunch of statements and it's going to do the printing of the result that comes back from the functions you're going to implement and this is the expected output that you should see from that print statement then it's going to execute this one and print it out and you're going to you know look in the console down here to see this message so what you want to do is implement the functions up here in the library class and if you've done it correctly you know returning the correct output here depending on the scenarios then running this series of statements your it's going to yield the expected output in the console so you can check that now once you've successfully completed all of the challenges what I want you to do is going back down to the wall of fame here and click this button it's going to launch a little window and you can tweet it's going to notify me I'm going to see it I'm going to add your name and your profile below here in the wall of fame and it's also going to help me get the word out for this page a little bit more so I can grow the code with crisp brand so I do thank you for that and I thank you for learning with me so go ahead and give it a try if you get stuck comment here in this page below I'll help you out thanks for watching and I'll see you next time bye for now
