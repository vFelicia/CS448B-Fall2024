hey everyone can you hear me uh is the the mic good how's it going zach akhil are you back hello sri charon sorry if i'm mispronouncing that but please let me know zac you were testing concurrency features how did that go you downloaded xcode beta guys today i have a second monitor so i set up a second screen so now hopefully i'll be able to keep an eye on the chat while also um doing whatever we're doing on the screen how's everyone doing all right cool so yesterday if you were here we were going through the platform state of the union just for anyone that is wait before i just speak for 30 minutes with no one can hear me uh let me check the audio can you guys hear me is my mic loud enough is the background music soft enough and you guys can see me right everything's good is my chat not updating okay cool yeah my chat is really not updating in real time give me a sec all right great um and this time the chat hey mark good to see you so this time the chat stream should actually be it should actually stay on the screen under my uh thumbnail in the upper right corner because yesterday i think when i had set it up the chat messages just disappeared as soon as they appeared after a couple of seconds so hopefully we get a stream of chat messages now uh give me a high give me a yes give me uh you're excited if you're excited to see this uh just so just a small recap for everyone yesterday that wasn't here the platform state of the union is basically apple's dev oriented broadcast to talk about all of the wwc dc new features and how it applies to developers and how developers can take advantage of the things that are coming down the pipe uh and all of this you know applies to the xcode betas and the mac os betas and stuff like that so you will have to download some beta software if you want to test some of these out like zach did um in the chat so yesterday we went through a couple of big announcements i'm not going to go through all of these in depth again but just at a high level we went through xcode cloud which is apple's new way of helping us take more of the development process into xcode so we don't need to leave xcode to do a variety of different things and it applies more to working in teams with more than one person but even if you're working with one person there's some pretty handy features like building in the cloud and being able to run your test cases simultaneously on multiple devices screens and even beta os's so that's really cool we talked a little bit about swift concurrency and we did an xcode demo about what that currently looks like and by the way i'm mentioning this so that in case you want to go and check out the the stream replay for that it is available on the channel so you can check that out excuse me we talked about the swift ui a couple of new components that they actually really useful components there's a new table component there are a lot of new modifiers that made it really easy to work with lists and add special features to lists and this is where we ended off on swift playgrounds so let me just bring up that section and again i'm not gonna play the audio uh so that i can talk over it but number two i don't want to potentially have any sort of uh copyright strikes so right now on ipad you can already get this app called swift playgrounds if you weren't aware of it and it's actually a great interactive way for people to learn swift and to learn how to code but the current version of swift playgrounds you can't really build apps on it so we actually get a lot of people coming to our channel and our forum and messaging us saying that they only have an ipad can they build ios apps on it and we have to say no unfortunately you need xcode and it's only available on mac machines and you know a mac is not cheap so a lot of the time that is a barrier to entry for a lot of people so what they showed here was that in the next iteration of swift playgrounds which i think i read that it should be available in the fall so it's not available right now but in the fall with swift playgrounds 4 you'll be able to build apps within swift playgrounds and they they do a demo of this so just to do a quick run through all of the learning content is still in the app so you can still learn to code with that interactivity which is what the app is known for but you can also start a new swift playgrounds project and then you get a code editor that looks like this on the left hand side and you get a little preview on the right and the cool thing about this is that they also have code completion so you know you're typing i don't know if i can yeah so there there's that nice code completion you also have this uh this library button here where when you tap on that it brings up a library where you can add a ton of uh components here so you can add components you can search for modifiers you can search for sf symbols and this basically looks like the one from xcode right now no one has seen this app yet i have to assume that you know this is not fullfledged xcode on your ipad but i think that over time you know they're probably going to add more and more capabilities to this for right now i think this is an amazing step to transition from using this app to learning and then actually being able to uh apply it okay cool cool cool sorry let me just adjust my volume i just saw that chat message now if it gets too loud just let me know actually i can adjust it from here okay so i'm if it gets too loud if it is too loud just give me a chat message because right now i have this awesome second screen that i can see it's actually just an old monitor i pulled out of my closet okay so we're talking about this library panel here that you can drag and drop and you can sort of build your app like this uh you can also test your app you can run your app from within swift playgrounds so you can then test it out and there's a little console section at the bottom where you can see the output if you're testing different things like that and then finally you can actually distribute this if you have an apple developer account which is that paid membership you can ship your app to the app store uh and then you can log into the app store connect portal so sorry did i i meant app store connect so you can ship it to app store connect you can log into your portal and from there your build would be available to send to all your friends and family via test flight to try out your app so again this is really cool and i'm i have ipads i have kids so i definitely have ipads but they're really old and i think the older ipads are built like tanks because my ipads they are at least i don't know they're at least eight years old and they're still going i mean they can barely run any apps anymore um but again for the kids the only thing they need to be run is netflix and maybe youtube for kids and kudos to those teams for making those apps be able to run on such old devices because that's really not an easy thing to do but yeah i'm looking into getting a new ipad even though this app isn't available right now i mean version 4 where you can build apps because i i really predict that by the time it releases in the fall where you can build apps that it's going to bring a whole new audience of people probably especially younger people younger kids who've been learning coding on ipad and then you know now they can actually build apps on an ipad for for all those people that don't have macs i mean so i want to get an ipad now i want to start checking out this swift playgrounds app at least the learning content side of it and seeing if there's really a way for me to supplement that is there a way for me to to make it easier for people to learn with swift playgrounds using the already existing learning content and then by the time version 4 hits in the fall i'll be in a great spot to transition that to you know here's how you can build some cool apps using the swift playgrounds app so this is not going to take over my you know the main content that we do here uh using xcode but i think this is definitely uh something worth exploring okay so that was swift playgrounds i'm just all right just checking the chat uh the next thing they were talking about is augmented reality okay so here's an app that he was showing and this is like a full screen testing of his app on swift playgrounds that looks pretty cool i don't know you know how much of it is actually functional sort of remains to be seen how powerful of an app you can build on swift playgrounds really curious about that okay next up they talked about reality kit so i haven't worked very much with ar but i'm always super impressed by the augmented reality apps that i see um so she's talking about one of the big barriers to working with augmented reality is creating those 3d models either you have to buy them or download them or create them yourself if you know how to create these 3d models but in reality kit 2 they introduce something called object capture and this is a process where you turn a series of 2d images into a 3d model so what you do is this is another app that they're showing it's called the clone app i think this is the clone app because they mentioned it a bunch of times that it helps you capture a real life object and make sure that you get all the angles so you basically if you want to capture this croissant for example you use that app and then you sort of it's taking pictures as you're moving around that object and it sort of makes sure you can get all the angles of it uh and even underside so you have a completely you know you can look at it in any direction so then you take these series of images and you go into um you go into your mac and in swift you there's a couple of lines of code where you can turn those 2d images into a 3d model so this is this is what they showed i haven't actually done this myself but what you can generate from the series of 2d images is a usd zed model and this is a this is a model that is optimized for ar quick look so you can actually use this 3d model in messages mail safari and other apps so this to me this is sort of like i guess a lighter weight 3d model that you can send for previews and you can use in a bunch of applications but if you wanted to generate you know a maybe a heavier 3d model you can also export or generate obj and usd asset bundles to be used in like real production workflows so again this is sort of stuff that's really um i haven't touched before so this is really all new to me but um the the thought of being able to create your own 3d models easily really opens up the possibilities right even for people who don't typically work in 3d like myself do any of you guys have you guys played with uh ar augmented ar kit augmented reality reality kid have you guys tried any of that let me know in the chat okay and then the next section there they were talking about the metal framework and again i don't do anything super graphics intensive yeah so they're just showing this croissant that they captured uh okay so metal this part i'm honestly a little hazy about in terms of what they talked about for metal i can give you a summary but in terms of really intensive graphics work uh that is really not my area of expertise and there was a lot of jargon that i didn't really understand but the gist of what i got from this section was that uh because of the new apple m1 chip um and uh the metal framework and their apple gpus and unified memory they've they've sort of uh melded all of that and created this uh harmonious working uh of all of these things to really improve graphics performance see i'm struggling to even put in my own words but they were talking about a lot of different graphics workflows like ray tracing and dynamic libraries and variable refresh rate displays and all these things that are now improved but i can't really tell you what it all means so if you work in graphics this section will probably be especially interesting to you i'd recommend that you check it out uh in terms of game development they now support more controllers like the latest xbox and ps5 controllers so more support for controllers um there's talking about how you know their improved graphics performance can now better handle aaa console games on mac platforms um apple platforms i mean so that includes ios and ipad os and things like that so they're talking about all of this graphics jargon that flew over my head and then new graphics debugging tools and xcode so i'm just going to breeze over that because i don't know how to explain that but if you work in graphics again highly recommended that you check out this section okay let's talk about focus focus was a huge part of wwdc and uh sort of the whole idea here was that they want to make it easier for you to focus on your task and sometimes your phone is just a distraction right and i don't know about you guys do you guys keep your phone beside you when you work and do you leave it face up or do you leave it face down or do you move it out of the room do you put it on do not disturb so for me um i find that if it's right there beside my my desk i tend to just check it all the time when i get bored or maybe i have a break i grab my phone check what notifications do i have and that sort of thing um if you move it out of the room you're not gonna go run and check it right and then when you go to sleep is it at your bedside is it on your nightstand or is it somewhere else right so they you know i think it's really cool that apple does this it's trying to help you improve your life because if you think about it from their perspective they want you to be using their device all the time they want you to you know to just have it on your face but they implement all these mechanisms to actually um try to keep things in balance right like the screen time stuff that was that was new a couple of years ago before you didn't know how often you used your phone or for for how long you know all those little chunks those little segments throughout your day really add up right so them giving you that sort of feedback is amazing so you can you can then decide what to do so again i applaud apple for that so this this new focus mechanism is for you to uh basically set a do not disturb mode it's like a mode but you can customize it so do not disturb his blanket right like no notifications get through but with focus you can create your own modes that maybe you only want to let's certain apps through so you create like a work mode um so maybe only your coworkers can get through maybe only certain apps can get through and notify you whereas all the other apps you know their notifications get blocked um so again you can create custom focuses they call it which is really cool um a big focus for them was notifications because you know you get a ton of notifications through the day and there's no priority you know you can't tell which one's really important which one's not so important they just all show up in the same way so as a developer now when you are sending notifications from your app you have the ability to specify four different levels yeah four different levels of um urgency so passive means like your no notification uh isn't really time sensitive it's not that important the user will see it when they see it um so you said it as passive don't wake the device it's not time sensitive when they said that you know what the first thing i thought about is as an app developer wouldn't i want my app notifications always to be because i'm trying to get the user's attention right so when i always put it as the highest urgency like critical or something like that they didn't talk about how your app would be punished i don't think it it would be because what they're implying is that on the device there's some sort of intelligence right so if you keep marking your notifications as like critical when it shouldn't be and they sense that the user over time you know it's it's alerting the user but the user is not checking it that intelligence is just going to like downgrade your app automatically there's some sort of intelligence on the device that um that sort of tunes that okay so passive we talked about that active is basically your normal notification it plays a sound it plays a haptic if the user's phone is you know not on um not on do not disturb normal notification this is this is the one that all notifications are right now and then there's a more urgent one so if something is time sensitive i guess you know live stream is starting or like time is about to run out on something or whatever it is so this visually stands out more it stays on the screen longer and if the user is wearing air pods siri will actually announce it to them so i don't know how i feel about that i if the notification actually is time sensitive and it was relevant i would be like oh that's cool thank you but if it was you know not actually time sensitive i i would kind of be annoyed if i was listening to something or audiobook or music and and siri suddenly just interrupts and and gives me like a promotional message or something like that so i don't i don't know about that maybe maybe we'll see and again i think the intelligence would automatically downgrade your app if you're sending timesensitive notifications that aren't actually timesensitive and then critical is reserved for like serious health and safety concerns uh in ontario here where we live we get these things called amber alerts that the police sends out to all of our cellular devices when you know kids are abducted and and everyone should be on the lookout and these sort of just play a loud sound and they come on regardless of what what's happening on your phone so that's sort of what this is and it plays a sound even if your device is muted um this requires a separate entitlement which you need to get approval for so i i'm not sure when they said get approval i'm not sure if they said approval from apple or approval from the user so if any anyone knows that um please comment it in the chat okay and then notification summary this is uh where they batch up all of your notifications into and deliver it at one time so it's like almost like an email digest of the it's a summary essentially it bundles all your notifications delivers it at once now that summary actually has two it features two notifications very prominently let me show you what that looks like so it looks like this so that's what a bundle looks like and i think the user gets to choose what time these things get delivered um but you can see there's two notifications at the very top that are front and center and then the rest of them are just bundled down here now you as a developer to increase your chances of being selected because this is just handled by the ai or intelligence and they're only going to feature notifications which have a thumbnail so um yeah i didn't yeah so that notifications with thumbnails are considered for featuring and it it's based a little bit on from what i read or from what i heard it's based a little bit on what the user uses but at the same time it also selects a variety so it's not it's not going to have like two yelp ones or two espn ones uh in the bundle there may contain multiple notifications from your app so how do they order it right well now when you send a notification you can assign a relevancy score to your notification and based on that score it's going to order your notifications so if maybe you send multiple notifications throughout the day maybe you would assign the latest ones a higher score so they would be kind of ordered in that same uh in that same time sequence so that i have to do some testing on but that's what that is so we've talked about this do not disturb silence is all notifications and then you can set your own custom focus where people can still get through this and also um i don't know if you guys caught in wwdc that um different apps now especially the apple ones will tell other people that you are on do not disturb so if someone's trying to message you through the messages app they're gonna see that you have a status of do not disturb and then you can choose whether or not to still send it that actually happens on slack if any of you guys use slack if someone has do not disturb it still gives you an option to send so the app that you build you'll be able to get the user's current focus as well so you can sort of display that if if your app is a a communication app and that actually brings me back to one point so if your app deals with communication from people so if it's like an email or a messaging app or something like that um you should mark your notifications as communication between people because apple treats those notifications differently so let me see if i can give you guys a visual for that so just talking about ah so that's what this looks like so your notification will actually show that person's avatar or memoji and your app icon here and i actually don't know how they're going to get the user profile from from people maybe they have to be on your contact list for you to see something like that but you have to tell apple that your communication is from people rather than just your app trying to tell your users something okay let me just turn down the music a little bit guys since i hear some of you guys saying that okay hopefully is this better hopefully this is better um okay cool so screen time we talked about screen time a little earlier and that's um you know keeping track of which apps you use and for how long you stare at your screen how long you use each app for and parental controls which exist now and my my kids aren't old enough that where i have to implement parental controls because i can just take away their ipads that is my parental control but they have now exposed the screen time api so you can be building your own parental control apps for example maybe an app that encourages homework or something like that and it it locks your ipad at certain times but basically there's an api now where you can do those sorts of things so it is in three different parts let me just scroll to the relevant slide here he's talking about the screen time api all right so there's the homework app okay i can't really find a relevant slide here um so we'll leave it here okay so first let's talk about manage settings um this restricts what um your child can do across all their devices and you can set a number of restrictions it that could be like appbased or it could be timebased family controls is where it's for the parent to select which apps so this is the family control screen where you select you know what you want to allow your kid to access and what you want to prevent now the important thing is that because they want to encourage privacy they don't want your app to be able to see what the parent is choosing so for example if i'm the parent here and i'm choosing what apps i want them to be able to access or not access your app is not going to know these names it's going to be tokenized so it's going to turn into like a random string of letters and numbers and you're just going to have to work with that token uh you can still you know pass that token around to do things such as restrict access to that app or enable access to that app but you won't know what that app is or you won't know what that activity is they call these things activities because it could it doesn't have to be an app it could be you know visiting certain websites and things like that uh the the last part of this parental controls or screen time api is device activity so this is a new api where your app can register um windows of time where certain things are allowed or not allowed so you kind of have control to lock down the device through this api i'm sure the kids are not happy about this and it'll be interesting to see what sort of parental control type of apps appear on the app store because this is this is new that we can do all of this on a device i'm not happy yeah yeah zach talking about the notifications it wouldn't pass review i think um but they the reviewers might not catch it to be honest you know it's it's so hard what they that review team has to do and i really don't know how they can make sure that um your app is clean and not fraudulent and that's why so many like fraudulent apps still get through so i'm just gonna move my mic closer maybe that'll actually help away from my speakers okay no we're getting to the end here actually really excited about share play i'll tell you why in a second okay so we talked about widgets right now you can create widgets i've actually never created one have you any of you looked into creating widgets or have created widgets yourself for your own apps turn this down um so now what's new is that there is a larger widget size because of ipad because they brought widgets to ipad so there is a giant one and this jumbo one here uh so they're just talking about that and how you can create super sized widgets now uh the other thing that they talked about this intense so you know widgets are based on someone putting your app's widget on their screen right so if they never do that then your app never gets the chance to really show up as one so it's very user driven right like they have to add your widget to the screen but they're saying now that they have certain things called widget stacks and if you have um an iphone you might have seen this where it's like a single widget but you can swipe up and down through it to display like different views in that single widget so in here they're saying that depending on you know what patterns they notice about the user that intelligence on the device may suggest your app to display something now your app has to give some information for it to actually display in that widget so they call this the intense api so it allows your app to suggest information so in here in this article they're suggesting that your smoothie app um sends this intent to order this at this time maybe because it notices that the user does this or maybe there's like a special sale or something like that about that and then the os will determine if they want to take that information and recommend it and show it in that widget stack so there's an there's a chance for your app to display some information in that widget stack even though your app's widget is not actually there so that's pretty cool and then we get to the last announcement which is share play so this is they started off wwdc talking about share play and facetime and this is if you missed that this is essentially where you can get on you know a group facetime and you can all together watch like a movie or listen to a song all in sync and us developers we can sort of take advantage of that sorry i don't mean take advantage of it but i mean use it so doing you know syncing media between people the code that they showed it's pretty simple to do but it's not limited to just syncing media across across multiple people one thing i want to mention is that the cool thing is like let's say you're watching a movie uh and you want to share play it with your group um what happens is when those people join your group activity to watch that movie um their movie plays in sync but it's not um they're you're not streaming your movie to them like they're actually watching like their device is doing the heavy lifting there is just a sink in terms of you know the the time stamp or whatever it is to keep it in sync but it's not like right now this stream right it's my computer sending the data um which is then coming to all of you guys where whereas the way that they have um they describe it here is that you know their own devices are playing the movies there's just a layer keeping things in sync so that is like syncing media playback but there's also a way to use apple's servers as a host so that you can do other group activities so what they show here is they show a bunch of people getting together they show some code on how to do the media sync it seems seems relatively uh not too complicated but in here they're showing an app where multiple people are drawing on the screen and what's happening here is that you know when you you're writing your handwriting it's not like you're sending your data um to their screen and then you know they're seeing what you're seeing it's not like a screen share type of thing it's that their device is actually receiving data about what you did and it's actually uh rendering that itself like it's strong it's devices drawing that out itself so there's a difference there because you're not just like sharing your screen and the thing that i find really exciting about this um is because it sort of relates to an app idea that i've had for a little while and if you go back to some of the very first live streams i did i don't know like four or five years ago i wanted to do like a social pomodoro app and now that i'm doing sort of live stream study with me's that idea sort of popped up in my head again but i thought it'd be so cool uh for all of us to be able to join like a pomodoro room if you guys are not familiar with the pomodoro technique it's just it's just a technique to do like a block of work and then like a little bit rest and then another block of work and sort of keeps you motivated and it keeps things in small chunks for you to do so i know apps exist out there already where you can sort of do group pomodoros but i wanted to incorporate some gamification into it and stuff like that so seeing this group activities framework makes me think that maybe i can use it for that app idea maybe so that is the end of their presentation i would encourage you to check it out i'll also be sharing my notes posted as a blog post on my website and i'll just send out the link through social media if you guys are interested in that but aside from that there are a ton of wwdc sessions which i haven't even started watching yet because yesterday i didn't have any time to to do that but did you guys bookmark any sessions are you guys going to watch any of these they're actually not bad because i thought most of them would be like an hour long but some of them like this one 16 minutes i had so i know some other creators have been streaming recently too so um i know paul hudson did one on uh what's new in swift so definitely go and check that out i don't know if sean allen did uh this did a stream i think he he did as well so it's so awesome that um yeah hey ed if you go into my channel youtube.comcodewithchris you'll find my beginner playlist yeah it's at the very top so what do you guys think just in general about what they announced at wwdc i know a lot of people were expecting hardware announcements a lot of you expressed disappointment on that first day on monday um but aside from that you know in terms of what they announced does anything in particular excite you guys any apis that you're thinking about using yourself and sort of where are you in your ios journey are you just starting out or are you in a great position to take advantage of you know some of these things because i know a lot of these topics that we've covered here are not exactly beginner friendly but i think it's still a very exciting time um because there's you know continuing to improve swift ui uh make and this is so much easier to pick up than ui kit was for beginners i've heard that time and time again in fact we we licensed our foundations course into a classroom and that they used that swift ui curriculum for their semester and at the end of the semester i got a chance to appear you know through zoom to their classroom and do sort of like a meet and greet and q a and you know i got some feedback from them and listening to how it was like for them going through that swift ui course and a lot of people found it it was a lot easier to learn you're not wrestling wrestling with ib outlets storyboards and stuff like that so i think swift ui uh is such a great step um especially from from my perspective coming as a as an educator and with swift playgrounds right making just building apps more accessible to everyone and lowering the barrier of entry that's that's only a good thing right because um you know maybe it's hard to justify investing in a mac up front if you don't even know if this is something that you're going to pursue that you like or not but swift playgrounds if you have an ipad already right you can just test things out and then when you decide to get more serious into it if you can't you know the swift playgrounds app is sort of lacking then you can be more confident in investing in maybe an older mac or a refurbished mac in fact this mac that i i bought this is a mid 2015 imac the retina 5k one and i bought it refurbished and it's it's been like amazing all this time no problems so i usually look at the refurbished stuff first but now that i'm looking at these new macs that came out now that my computer is straining more because i'm starting to stream uh maybe i will invest in a new mac that's a lot of money though because we're talking about what ipads i haven't gotten a new iphone for a long time though my iphones usually last me about four years and this mac has has been about four to five years yeah zach did you sign up for the xcode cloud beta wait list i wonder how many people they're going to allow into that my guess is that they're going to allow you know larger companies in first because they're probably going to be able to stress test it the most and give apple feedback for you know single developers and i don't know if we'll get to us but i did register for the wait list with our code with chris like company accounts so maybe they will accept us thinking that we have tons and tons of developers whereas we don't uh lordison you got confused with staying in javascript react native course or jump back to swift really liked for native um i think at the beginning it's it's really important to sort of stick with something at least get deep into into it enough so that you have a grasp of it before jumping around because you're not going to make any progress you're essentially going back to square one when you jump into a different thing right so my advice to you if if you don't have an alt if you don't have like um exterior mode of driving you like maybe you have to learn it for a school a course in school or like maybe your employer is asking you to learn that if you don't have a motive like that then i would definitely go with what you're interested in because that interest and that passion flows through and you're going to find that you're you're going to spend your evenings and free time learning about this stuff and digging into it it's just going to be a lot easier it's if it's something that you don't really want to do but you feel like you should do like maybe working out staying fit eating healthy you know those are usually the things that um people know they should be doing but it's hard to do and it's not until you make a lifestyle change that it really happens um i haven't made that lifestyle change yet oh is that cool you had a corporate account too for your work i assume or maybe you have your own business oh mark you're using a 2015 as well cool yeah it's amazing how how well these machines hold up i remember when i was using a pc um for some reason they'd get really slow really fast um but these macs max are pretty good ah that is just your beta machine nice nice you know i have another machine too so this is my um at the same time i bought this 5k retina mac imac i mean i also bought a macbook pro um and i my intention was to leave this because at that time i had a separate office we had rented a little office and i was going to leave this imac there i was like okay i'm going to leave work at work when i come home you know i have my laptop for nonwork purposes um but didn't really turn out that way but now my macbook is being used by my fouryearold daughter because of online schooling so she's basically beaten the crap out of that macbook and because she's got the speakers on full blast you know all day for the classroom she's she has you know greasy fingers from eating snacks on the keyboard and she took crayon to my screen i see crayon marks on my laptop screen so now the left speaker is blown out so anyways anyways it's an old it's an old laptop anyways and education comes first right uh bargain are you ref are you referring to me i haven't installed any of the betas yet um yeah it's just been a busy couple of days so i haven't done that oh is that cool cool that's awesome so hopefully good luck with the wait list maybe you'll get into the xcode beta if you do please let us know let us know how it is did you always start off as uh did you transition from sort of like a fulltime corporate job into becoming an independent contractor did you make that shift or did you start out just doing contracting contract work this is why you can't have nice things mark yeah i remember when we were just having kids we we wanted this really nice white uh couch from pottery barn was it called pb comfort i forget what it was called but you know like pottery barn furniture isn't it isn't cheap and uh luckily we had the foresight to to not do that and instead just buy things buy cheaper things that we knew would just get ruined and we wouldn't get heartbroken over and so that has been like a super smart decision so there's no way we're keeping a white couch free from kids fingers and stuff like that wow zack super impressive third generation computer engineer so you you must have grown up like what was your childhood like um were you exposed to engineering and you know circuitry stuff like that i don't know what computer engineering yeah you must have been exposed to that stuff when you're really young and that's one one thing i'm thinking about for my kids my kids are four and six and uh they're learning actually the older kid six years old she's learning um what is it scratch now in school it's pretty cool pretty cool so they're like dragging these little jigsaw blocks to uh make sequences right so they're recording their own audio into the program uh and each audio bite is like a little jigsaw block and then they can visually uh and then she's also drawing images as well and they're basically assembling stories using these little jigsaw audio blocks with the um with the images that she's drawn on the screen and then she has to you know program the transitions and when the audios plays and she can like repeat certain audio clips and it was really funny for her to uh when i was watching her uh seeing her uh accidentally uh put an audio clip on repeat and when she played it it just like kept repeating and she started freaking out she's like ah what's going on that was really cool to see but yeah i didn't know that they started so early now yeah zach the wallpapers are nice wow super impressive guys yeah i only started programming or you know i only realized that was something that you could do in grade 10 for me in grade 10 and i sort of just fell in love with it right away and we learned this language called turing it's a it was invented by someone in the university of toronto awesome awesome yeah it's sort of a really cool feeling for me because i was exposed to programming in school and that's how i went down this path and then seeing you know seeing teachers saying that they're using some of my youtube stuff to supplement their lessons or uh you know some classrooms are using our courses in their classrooms uh really sort of brings it full circle for me and it's like this really great feeling it sort of um completes things and really drives me forward for this i'm so lucky to be honest i'm really really grateful that i can do this as my fulltime job um yeah so i mean one downside to this though i'll tell you guys right now is that because i've been doing this since 2013 and you know in 2013 when i left my corporate job and started doing this i really knew my stuff right because i was working on this eight hours a day um and then over time because i just wasn't like i was more focused on building code with chris as a brand and as a business than i was coding and developing my coding skills that that balance sort of shifted right so on one hand where i did sort of i was able to make this my fulltime gig but on the other hand my coding skills started going down because i wasn't using them as much as i used to so um now and it was really hard because as the business grew there was just more to do right and i love learning about things i love learning about uh you know marketing and business development and all those things and those are all skills and um areas which have their own degrees and programs right so you you get a sense of how deep it goes and when you're starting your own thing you're the only person so i was going down these rabbit holes learning a lot and i was having a lot of fun but i it just wasn't you know coding um so now you know after so many years we've gotten to a point where luckily we we do have more people helping with code with chris now so i i can be more removed from doing every single thing and i can be streaming with you guys and interacting with you guys here and that's amazing to me right and you know i have this renewed interest in wanting to learn and study and code and that's why i want to do these study sessions on stream to keep myself accountable as well as well as i know for other people it's motivation right to get together and do something social and code together because sometimes it's just lonely at night wanting to you know go and code by yourself uh if it's not something like you super really want to do so i have this renewed interest in wanting to learn and upgrade my skills but another thing is that something that i've never done is build my own apps to try to gain traction and build a big user base and to monetize them because in my fulltime job we built apps for clients so we were a consulting company and these clients were usually you know big media companies uh broadcasting companies that just wanted an app to you know as a different distribution channel for their content so they didn't really care you know if it made money or not to them it was just another distribution channel and plus we were always only in charge of the development of it we weren't in charge of the you know marketing side or anything like that or user acquisition side or growth or anything like that so um and because i was coding so much and we would have to you know sometimes pull like really late hours especially close to crunch time the deadline um we would be going in in the morning and staying till you know like 10 sometimes like i've i've left in the ams and then i'd have to show up the next day to uh you know at 9am again and you can only do that for so long that was one of the reasons i sort of burnt out but anyways because it was so tough i i really wasn't interested in coding for myself and building my own apps and exploring that um and then when code with chris started in the back of my head i was sort of like oh i need to have my own apps because i need credibility and authority and and who would want to learn from someone who didn't have their own apps and that was sort of the mindset i was in right so but again i was so busy with just building the business that i wasn't building my own apps and so now i've gotten to a point where i do want to build my own apps and i do want to explore this this art of growth and user acquisition because i think it's it's not that easy anymore right the app store is so crowded um a lot of the apps are dominated by bigger companies indie developers i mean they still have they still have opportunities but i think you have to be pretty smart about it there's definitely a business and marketing side to app like building your own successful apps now you can't just no coding and that's it sorry i went off on a big tangent do you guys do any of you guys have your own apps in the app store um i mean you guys probably have if you do you have more experience than me about user acquisition and how to how to get users zach it sounds like yeah um you could probably explain this part better than i can you know we were talking about the unified metal graphics platform because all of this during the platform state of union was sort of gibberish to me i'm like how does though i don't know if you do like graphics rendering and you do you know game development i'm sure i'm sure this is all you know very interesting news to you awesome you got to show us some of the do you have a link to to anything you want to show us zack bargain this is a great question that's a great question uh number one is that the app um because when it was developed and we published it in the app store we were featuring our ui kit content so we had a like a 30 day beginner series on youtube and you know at that time we were busy with something or another and we're just like okay we're gonna update it with the swift oh we were busy developing swift ui content yeah we're busy developing this stuff let me bring this on screen we were busy developing this new series transitioning from ui kit to swift ui and so we didn't want to promote that because everyone would be you know digging into the ui kit stuff whereas now we're like trying to transition this with ui so we were gonna update that app with the swift ui content instead and then do the big announcement in the big push um but then now we're at this point where we are rebuilding a cwc app that is multiplatform that can connect to our learning platform so people can download videos offline for offline viewing and stuff like that so that should um maybe in the next three months or so that we're trying to release that and that will sort of replace that app that you see in the app store it's a great question thank you sergio appreciate it um yeah like aside from my material there's tons of content creators uh nowadays that are also sharing uh sharing their knowledge and helping people out at night you know that's that's so awesome to see check out the uh the subreddits for swift programming and swift ui a lot of content creators are are posting their stuff there ah flow yes if flow is here if he's flow is also teaching and he's an active member of our community and definitely check out his content he teaches at boot camps live boot camps so his experience really is really battle tested so definitely check out his content right here um let's see what else so sean allen i think goes without saying you guys probably have all seen him let's see uh he didn't do a live stream but design code mengto and his team really cool speaking of uh design actually before we get to that um i think bengto is a great resource for for learning design especially as a developer if you need to just know you know enough to to make your app look good you don't need to become a fullfledged designer he has a lot of great content on on doing that and just from like watching his workflow um but yeah in terms of design we actually hired a designer on our team recently so i'm really excited to to work with him he's actually the one that's going to be teaching a large chunk of our um and here i'm going to do a uh sort of a shout out or what do you call it not a shout out a plug to my own program uh but we have a design course that we're working on here and he's going to be teaching a large part of it so i'm going to be teaching the implementation part of it he's going to be teaching the actual like design in figma part of it and so then we're going to meld their two parts together that should be pretty cool and then in the future he's going to work with me on content for the youtube channel and content for our demos so hopefully all you know all of my demos and apps are going to look much better when you guys go to build it yeah appmasters steve steve is great i'm going to be learning a lot from steve especially you know for the app marketing user acquisition side the problem um i'm a little bit intimidated because he has so much content like a lot of content and his main channel isn't on youtube right his main thing is on podcast and he has hundreds of podcast episodes so it's impossible to go through go through all of them but yeah definitely a great guy sharing a lot of what he knows you know the thing with the app store is it's so dynamic things are changing all the time so now that i think of it what used to work may not be working now so he actually has a agency that helps people market apps and actually that's where the knowledge really comes from those little little tweaks and little hacks um it's it's battle tested right because he does it for clients so that he can share it and it's really cool that he does share it because i mean in a way if you expose your techniques that you use for working with clients it becomes more widely used then that might not work anymore apple might patch it up you know because before i know there was a technique that he told me where i think you could you know you only have so much space to put keywords and your titles and stuff like that but he found out with his clients that you can use um like the titles and keyword fields for a couple of other countries and you can specify you know english words there and they sort of apply to the app store ranking as well so you're sort of getting you know it's like a cheat code you're you're getting uh advantage over other people who are only using the the english fields for keywords and descriptions or something like that i don't remember exactly what it was but it's all these little like tweaks and these little hacks that you only notice from actually doing it right and he has that through his agency hey ts thanks for joining all right guys i think i'm going to call it a day for the stream but i will be back streaming again tomorrow at 10 30. i haven't thought about what we're going to do yet if if i don't have a topic then we're just gonna i'm probably just gonna turn off the mic and i'm just gonna do some coding um i might not show my screen maybe i will maybe i won't but uh come join anyways through the chat we'll chat we'll code together take that time as a meeting time in your calendar for you to do some learning and studying and coding to be honest i will probably spend that time watching wwdc sessions and that's going to give me um yeah it's about time and catch up because i'm i'm already a day late and there are so many sessions that i bookmarked and every day they're coming out with like a ton of new sessions right so i have in my bookmarks i'll just show you guys some of the stuff that i'm interested in um yeah these are not out yet this one's not oh yeah the design awards this is always really interesting to see so there's the async await stuff that we went through the practicing inclusive design i have a huge interest in you know how to design really cool apps really beautiful apps that have great user experiences so obviously a lot of the what's new in swift ui what's new in swift mac catalyst inapp purchases a lot of the debugging stuff i want to get better at detecting and diagnosing memory issues i remember working in objective c back in the day used to be not really fun trying to figure out but you know what being you know having to manage your own memory actually gave me a really good understanding of how things work under the hood so now you know with swift and swift ui and stuff that that that's a little bit abstracted right and if you're just coming into learning you probably don't know what's happening under the hood things like reference counting and and all of that stuff um so it might you know when you're trying to debug a memory leak it might be harder for you because those things haven't been exposed to you group activities this is this is a cool one yeah see i imagine building this like group pomodoro thing where we can actually use it together here on these streams um so we can sort of set a timer and have a timer on the screen and then when the work timer is on we're all coding and doing our own thing and studying and learning and when we take a break we'll do some fun things we'll do some fun games with this stream labs software there's actually like commands and little games you can play and little points you can earn so i'm just exploring that and getting used to that all right let's check the chat uh bargain uh shazam kit i have no idea how to use but i think i saw a session on that right like this one you should definitely bookmark that watch it tomorrow come on the stream you can watch that while i watch something else and you can let us know how easy or hard it is to use this one right here unfortunately i don't have any experience with it i can't really teach teach you about it yeah okay in any case thank you guys all for joining uh i i feel a lot more comfortable on stream now and it's only been like two days three days so hopefully continue to stream continue because i love interacting with you guys it's amazing to um to chat with you guys and really see a different different side i can see you know why why people do this it's a lot of fun it's a lot of fun all right see you guys later have a nice day too
