hello hello can you guys hear me and there's a little bit of a delay hello hello can you guys hear me is the audio good can you see me so today i wanted to take you guys through some of the behind the scenes with code with chris and show you a little bit about how we plan our content and how we create it and how different members of the team come together and get it done and publish the youtube videos that you guys watch in addition to that i wanted to talk a little bit about an app that we're building and show you the process that we're going through and then also if you've been following the channel for a while you'll know that we built an instagram analytics app uh for a three month case study and we i gave a couple of updates on youtube before so i want to give you guys and a look into our app store analytics for that app and to show you how that's doing all right hello so you'll notice that streaming in 1080p now but my computer actually if i open xcode and i run it it's really going to choke and die all right so we have some offending members in the chat hi call of programming how are you doing hi angelo hi nice to see you coding along today cool angelo nice to see you hey tutor hey june ah so do you use an m1 mac so i was just talking about this right now this is actually a pretty old imac and up until now it's suited my needs fine because i have a ton of ram and um it's like a mid 2015 i5 quad core mac with 32 gigs of ram so i've been loving the retina the 5k retina screen and it's been fine but now that i'm starting to stream and i realized that i wasn't streaming in 1080p before it was just 720 and and even the replays right were not in 1080p and i was like that i can't have that i need at least 1080p so i tested out streaming over the weekend in 1080p so my bandwidth is completely fine but my computer actually chokes when um i run xcode so right now the stream is 1080p you guys will be able to switch that on to that level but as soon as i launch xcode and i try to build a project it the cpu tanks and then you get buffering and all that stuff so today because i am just showing you guys sort of behind the scenes and how our company works together to produce content to produce apps and give you some app updates on uh the instagram analytics app showing you some app store uh analytics i want to show you guys what we're planning for the cwc app and how we're going about executing it because this would have been the second app that we built as a company and so we've learned lessons from building the instagram analytics app so we're going to do things a little differently i want to share that with you yeah but oh i forgot the second part june park you asked me if i had an m1 mac um so i am getting one in because of what i just told you i do want to be able to show you guys you know building apps and writing code and you know doing stuff in xcode and still stream in 1080p so i do have a mac coming in and speaking of which i haven't actually ordered it yet i want to get your opinion and i you know i already have in my mind what i want to do um but anyways it's got to be m1 the performance is there i looked at geekbench scores right now i'm using a 27 uh inch imac i love this screen right problem is no n1 chip for this just yet however if we take a look at these ones right here you know shiny and new cool colors um i was gonna get the the green one i wanted i don't know i know my brand is blue but i i think green is really soothing you know like plants botanical green so i was really leaning towards this green one the only thing that really held me back was this 24 inch display uh and the viewable area for this is actually only 21 inches and so the viewable area for my imac right now is 27 inches and i don't know if i can i can do i can go from that level to that level and so i decided that i will probably order a mac mini today i'll probably place the order today and i will probably upgrade the the ram on this guy and also the hard drive because right now uh for the ssd right now this imac has ssd but it's only 250 so i'm constantly running out of space especially you know producing large videos um for for production and post editing so i'll probably upgrade this and probably get 16 gigabytes now the nice thing about the mac mini is that in the future when i need to upgrade this machine again um i don't have to replace the monitor right i can get a nice beautiful big monitor and then i can just swap out the mac mini itself right now with this imac i i love the screen but the specs really um starting to feel lacking especially with the streaming in 1080p so this is probably what i'm going to go with and then buy a monitor and it says that it won't get delivered until that's actually really fast so i'll probably get it pretty soon and then i'll be streaming in 1080p i can compile the next code and there won't be any performance bumps anyways i went on a rant there yeah yeah call of programming we you are going to see the analytics of the app today i'll probably do that a little later on in the stream if you uh can't wait for that if you need to go this replay will always be up serdar yeah the the imac with the m1 chip beautiful machine and display especially orange color yeah why don't you guys tell me in the chat right now what color would you get if you were to get one of these what is your favorite color right here it's crazy how thin these are it's crazy thin david i would ha you have the mac mini would highly recommend it i'm glad i'm glad to hear that rose um 2018 macbook pro i love my macbook pro oh 2019. yeah these machines like i i don't know the the machines that at least i've bought from apple have lasted pretty long they've done pretty well i would say it's a good investment for those people you know where their budget fits and blue blue forever blue or white a lot of blue yeah i think i guess apple did their research because blue is uh their default color here i think most people blue orange oranges is unique i think this will definitely stand out if you get an orange or yellow one or even a red one because you don't normally see those right these would be equivalent to you know driving those super cars with the flashy colors that's what this would be june park you bought the cwc plus course and loving it are the swift ui database courses still in progress yeah ashley asha just updated the road map so if you go to the road map right here i'm working on lessons two and three today so lesson one has been it's not been published but it's ready to be published but we're thinking that after we work on lessons two and three which will probably get published sometime tomorrow if i work on them today then we'll publish all three at once so really pushing to get this done uh matt s if you're getting an m1 macbook for coding definitely need the 16 gigs of ram right um maybe someone in the chat can also chime in tutor you have an m1 macbook air did you upgrade the ram for me i would personally say if you can afford it i would say yes it just extends the life of your machine longer like for this one i've used this machine for you know since i didn't buy it in 2015 i actually bought this mid 2015 imac in about 2017 so it still lasted like four four years for me um with good performance too like it doesn't lag in xcode or anything like that and i would honestly continue using this machine if not for the fact of streaming in 1080p and xcode don't really play nice together with this configuration here splash route yeah you think my imac at this this level wouldn't be able to run mac os monterey you might be right i haven't installed the beta yet but i'm glad i'm making the jump to upgrade and i'm thinking that i won't need to for another at least three four years hopefully yeah that's the thing with apple with you know when you buy a brand new iphone it's blazing fast and over time as you get the updates it just gets slower and slower until the point you want to upgrade but even those they last i've been using my iphone for a good three years i would say yeah uh this one is uh what is what is my iphone hold on let me check all right but i haven't upgraded this in a while it's an oh it's an iphone xs max yeah i think that was the year they came up with these weird naming conventions yeah started with the iphone x and then xs and xs masks but anyways okay let's get started i want to jump into a ton of things to show you guys today so a little preview of the analytics there let me just first show you what i have here so i made the font really big hopefully you guys can see that okay so this is a tool called mondaymonday.com and sometimes it's really confusing to say to people put it on monday because it's also a day but um over the years we've started building our team at first it was just myself and then we had our video editor adrian so he right now edits all the course videos and the youtube videos and in the beginning it was really easy to work together we just actually communicated through twitter dms and we didn't really need a project management sort of tool before and so when we were starting to consider these tools we actually went through a whole bunch of things before landing on this one which suited our needs so i'm not going to walk you through like every single board here but in general things start here in our planning board um and we have a bunch of templates depending on what we're working on so for example in the youtube video template you see that there's a whole bunch like a checklist a whole bunch of things to do so we duplicate one of these and we put it into this group called scoping so here are a bunch of things that we're thinking that would most likely do and here we're talking about um just planning out what we're gonna cover and things like that and in addition just to go back to the road map oh i actually closed it but you know this road map that i showed you guys here there is an updates and also an ideas tab so when you come here and you submit an idea you can also vote on other people's ideas and we we look at this right to drive what we're going to create in terms of content in part in addition to the other things that we want to create so this one responsive design is on the roadmap and i'm working on that one um but yeah that's sort of what happens here so in the produce tab it goes from planning once we scoped it out it goes into this produce board and this is where it sort of flows from top down this is the workflow it goes from here goes down down down into release promote for the newsletter and there are different members of the team that work in in parallel and in different areas for this so usually that video or that topic will come into development and design where we're going to be building or designing right and then it goes into lesson planning so let me drill into one of these and you can assign the person here you can assign a status as you can see i need to do a code review for this monthly app challenge right here and we are also working on surfacing all of the cwc stories so i was um promoting this campaign pretty heavily before so let me just show you what this would look like normally uh we use figma for all of our graphics stuff so we usually have a link to a figma file so this is what this landing page is going to look like and we're featuring basically all of your stories some of you actually might be in the stream right now and just telling us your story so we're gonna surface those beautiful stories on a landing page so that's what this project is about um here you can see in the lesson lesson planning phase um uh we are trying to flesh out these lessons and trying to get them out the door it starts with planning the lesson which is um for me writing an intro writing and conclusion uh which are usually just a couple of lines anyways and then planning in bullet point form what i want to cover in that lesson um and then usually when you click into one of these we'll have a figma file for all of the graphic assets for that lesson and also a google doc for the either the script if there is like a lot of talking i'll usually script it um but then as i'm delivering it and i'm recording it i won't read it word for word because it's really hard to stare at the camera and read so i'll get the gist of it and then i will use my own words that's usually how it goes but for these these ones for example let's see if i can find another one yeah so this one i'm working on today and this is in the production phase so i'm actually recording it or i'm writing it it depends if it's like a blog article that would be writing if it's a video i'll be recording it so just a couple of lessons or sorry a couple of sentences for the intro and the outro and then in the screencast section i'll write some bullet points on what i want to cover and then from production it goes into postproduction where this is where adrian does most of his work where he'll actually edit the video and he will then assign it to me for review so let me show you what what that might look like so we have a shared dropbox and he'll put it in here and then he'll cut me a copy for review so this video is actually coming out soon uh on the channel and it is where you guys gave me advice on well you guys told me what advice you would give to someone who's just starting out learning ios app development so i took a uh i read all of your pieces of advice and i commented on them and just gave my feedback and my opinion on it so that's coming out so for that you know i have reviewed it this morning so i would go set it ready to start and then i would assign it to adrian and i would just tell them we would check those off and so see there's a process as um the business gets larger and we're starting to produce more content uh this this stuff was all new to me to be honest it just started out initially as me right filming something on the computer editing it and then pushing it out onto youtube but now it's become this giant workflow where multiple people work on it so it's really amazing to see and for me personally i you know i didn't take business in school i don't know how to manage it you know manage my team effectively manage a business and this is all a learning process so it's really cool waiting to be released there's a whole bunch of stuff actually that i haven't got to releasing just yet you'll see that our designer has been working on some design course materials as well so we're stepping up our production game i also hope to probably hire another person later this year that would be really cool if we can get some more people producing content um i've also been thinking about how you guys as part of the community like we all have something to teach right um you might think you're a beginner but there i bet you there's someone who is even below you just starting out and wants to know what you know so we can all um create the content and that's only going to strengthen the ios community so i'm thinking about some way to uh really highlight the community and um you know to get the community teaching and sharing i'm not exactly sure how to do that just yet but i think that would be really cool okay so that's basically the two main boards aside from that we have a community board where arthur who is our customer success person uh at code with chris basically handles a lot of the social comments so you you've probably seen him and francis uh work together to answer youtube comments and like instagram comments and all of that stuff sometimes i'll step in and also help out but there's no way i can keep up with all of the messages and we have a rule here that we try to answer every single person so every single like comment dm website message instagram dm youtube comment we try to answer everybody and you know we we might not always succeed but i think we do a pretty good job of it so there's also um yeah also our forum as well which we try to answer everyone and we have a wonderful code crew team uh which david ravinsky is part of the chat he's part of a team code crew and he you can find him in the code crew forum helping people out as well we have chris parker michaela mark spalding and a whole bunch of other members that help each other out so our forum codecrew.codewithchris.com really helpful place direct asserter have you a direct link for articles on your site um this one's kind of tough like we've written so much things over the years that i'm i'm really having trouble trying to surface them all um so my latest attempt and this is ever evolving is if you hit learn up here you're going to see uh first of all some resources that we want to highlight and then an index of you know our courses and where you can find things but down here um i've tried to cherry pick all of the articles that are still sort of relevant and not super out of date and list them here i know it's just a long list that might be kind of hard to go through but at this point this is this is what we have this is the best that we've done so far if you can think of another way to organize it let me know maybe we can split it up into um yeah i don't know maybe i should check out how what other people do um other content creators who have a ton of articles and how they organize it because definitely you know in addition to the website articles i have youtube videos too so how do they play together jira is a good tool for agile methodologies using scrum it's a continuous integration type of management yeah i think you know i haven't personally used jira for agile but i think in our old company when i used to be working professionally still we were exploring jira june chris do you have plans for a combined tutorial uh yeah i think i will eventually right now i'm still in the process of learning it um and i'm using mark mark moykins from big mountain studio his um his combined resource which makes it really easy to learn so combine i mean this this book is not um it's not super cheap but for someone who uh could actually use combine in their workplace i definitely think it's worth it guys give me a second here hello sorry guys back so uh my daughter was just looking for mommy and uh okay so what were we talking about here i think i was just answering questions yeah okay the other thing i wanted to show you here let's transition over to the cwc app so just to give you guys a little bit of context right now in the app store we do have a code with chris app but it's showing the ui kit tutorials and actually david ravinsky in this chat he's the one who built it for us so kudos to him um mark my kids no problem no problem i i constantly use your uh use your book so you know it's it's not a shout out without merit and yeah so i was talking about the cwc app we had some requests from cwc plus members that you know with these streaming platforms to learn sometimes you go on a plane sometimes you go on a train sometimes you're just disconnected and you want to be able to download the videos for offline access just like netflix or skillshare and whatnot and so we're looking into well we're kind of full into it building an app a cwc app and the idea is that it would serve as sort of an entry point as well for people in the app store to find us and start learning swift ui and then potentially maybe turn into a cwc plus member if they want to continue learning through the app or for existing cwc plus members to learn on the go to be able to download the lessons and such so the way that we're approaching this is let me just go back here uh we're we're doing this through mapping out um user journeys so there's this tool called lucid lucidchart or maybe lucid app or something like that and this is just a new tool that we found for we wanted something free and we wanted to be able to map out flows and if you guys know of a different tool that you use i'm sure i'm sure everyone has a tool for something like this let me know what you prefer in the chat for for this time we're just using lucid i don't really have a different tool but we mapped out the different journeys and this is going to basically tell us what to tackle first and uh what sort of different flows exist within this app and this um you know before even diving into technical requirements and app requirements and things like that you put yourself in the perspective of someone who is going to use your app what do you want them to be able to do through your app so here it starts with downloading and opening the app we want to prompt the user if they want to create a code with chris account and we're going to just assume the easiest flow now so they're going to say no but they should still be able to explore the app and view some of the free content that we have like the 14 day beginner challenge so they'll be able to even take that and watch the lessons and take those those courses and then for saving those lessons for offline access we are reserving that for people who have created an account so not necessarily a paid account even creating a free account but you must be logged in to be able to download lessons for offline so if they try to do that then we are going to prompt them for account creation if they don't do that then they just you know they complete the course and then we we say hey if you want to continue learning here we have this awesome foundations course that you can take uh and then we're gonna do an inapp purchase for them to sign up so that's that's one flow right the other flow is like they create an account they say yes and then they they just visit the returning user experience so we have another user flow for returning users and for this one it's very similar but as a returning user you already have an account so you're gonna log in and we have a couple of states here or error states and it depends if they are a cwc plus member then they get access to the entire course catalog and they can engage with all the courses and they can download lessons for offline access if they're not a cwc plus member they can still use all of our free content and also because they have logged in and they have an account they can save and watch videos locally even offline so these are the flows that are planned for now and obviously we can take this even further and we can add different features to it maybe gamification features or featuring news and announcements and things like that for now though this is what we've charted out because it sort of hits the main purpose for the app which is a to allow existing cwc plus members to have an app experience and download videos for offline access and then b to capture new a new audience through the app store who potentially you know could start learning ios with us um and the nice thing about charting out these user journeys is that now it makes it really easy for you to plan out what you want to do so for example when we are working on iterations here um because the the reason why we're planning it out this way with the different sprints like this is because um jesse who is actually an intern here from the university that i used to go to we went through the same internship program when i did computer science at that university we had the same program it's just really cool you alternate so four months you do school and then four months you get to um apply to different jobs and and those companies come and they hire these uh interns so it alternates and you get to try out a whole bunch of different companies i think about four or five different companies before you even graduate and what usually happens is on your last work term so in your last internship um those companies might hire you actually right from graduation so if you you know you have a strong performance they'll make you an offer and so you you might have a job secured before you even graduate so anyways um we are we hired jesse to come on board and he's been working here since june 1st and he's basically ramped up on swift ui i mean he had a programming background he's in computer science as well and that probably made it a little easier for him to to get up to speed so he's going to be working on this app he's going to be the main um the main driver of this i told him go learn some scrum you know how to manage sprints and scrums and things like that and uh help push this forward so i will so i'll be the one that will probably also work on this but you know i want to focus on cwc plus i want to focus on creating course content with you guys streaming with you guys hanging out with you guys and on some of those streams i actually might be working on this app as a as a developer so i think it's also a really cool experience i'm trying to give him as much responsibility as he can handle without overburdening him because i think that'll make a really cool work experience or a work term uh june are you from waterloo as well waterloo university that was the one that i i graduated from uh how do you so june asks how do you learn new ios technologies uh don't worry you're not asking a lot of questions i love it this is the sort of interaction that i really love with the streams that we've been doing um so how do i learn the other what was it in the last stream that i did for thursday i think that was a group study stream where i was just um learning something and i was working on something while you guys chat and i participated in the chat as well but how i learned was i downloaded i just do it the same way you guys do so it usually starts with a google search so that learning that i did on thursday was actually for this app i wanted to figure out how do you download an hls stream for offline viewing so you know that that is what i searched offline hls download or something like that right and i looked at a bunch of resources and apple actually had a they had a sample the problem was that it was done in ui kit and so on thursday when you guys saw me and i had the mic off i was transferring this demo taking trying to learn what exactly they were doing and taking bits out of this code and porting it over to my own swift ui version of the project and i didn't take everything i just took sort of bits and pieces that i needed but you know you can't just randomly take code out of one project without knowing what code you're taking so i had to understand what they were doing right and i tried to replicate that in my own project so yeah that's that's learning new technologies if there is no tutorial there's usually documentation for it so if i wanted to learn something like you know ar kit and i haven't played around with this before but there's a ton of documentation for it and you just gotta get your hands dirty you just have to try things out and hit some roadblocks overcome them and that's how the learning process happens actually funny story when i first graduated in my job first job one of the very first tasks i was assigned to was to figure out microsoft silverlight does anyone in the chat remember this hey pagasi nice to see you uh this thing was basically a flash competitor microsoft's flash competitor so when i started working my first job placement this was brand new and microsoft wanted to really push this so they were paying companies to build demos to showcase silverlight and to use it and to build cool things with silverlight so you know my my company got funding for this um but i was tasked to figure this out learn how to use it and there wasn't a lot of literature or documentation about this and i remember just staying late a lot of staying late a lot banging my head on a lot of things obviously i had a couple of contacts at microsoft because not my own contacts but you know through the company i was working at to talk about some of this stuff and to ask questions but you know this was obviously new to them as well and so yeah it's just a lot of trial and error a lot of bang your head against the wall blend yeah mark yeah blend with their uh design slash developer bridge tool um anyways you know it's crazy to me thinking about that and how technology changes i when i started code with chris i have expected this to last you know maybe two years or three years because ios would eventually fall out of flavor or fall out of favor and there would be new platforms coming up to take its place because so far in my university journey to you know the first maybe three or four years of my career i was just constantly learning different things learning new platforms um i i dabbled in flash i mean obviously there are ones that stood the test of time like java um you know a lot of web web technologies like javascript so that was all good but i learned a lot of flash stuff adobe flex all of the um the microsoft platforms sort of come and came and went there was a microsoft surface that it was really cool i got to work on this it was like a big table no not this thing a table top i don't know if any of you guys remember this actually this coffee table thing and that was use it used to be called microsoft surface now they used the word surface for uh their laptops or their tablets see it was this thing so i got to work on this thing it looks really cool you know the idea of having like a table top and to be able to put things on it and have the tabletop recognize what it was but back then how it actually worked was there were like four cameras under the table that would um i guess detect i i don't really know how it works but it would detect um shadows i don't know i'm speaking out of out of line here already but i got to work on this and as a new grad this was sort of cool because it was brand new not many people had seen it before and i got sent to uh different places in the u.s to work on client sites to build um apps for this so you can see they imagined a lot of different scenarios they imagined this to be in bars where you could put your drink on it and it would like tell you things you could browse menus right here um on the table anyways this is a tangent just reminiscing about the past all right where were we here yes we were talking about the sprints we're talking about uh how we're going to approach building this yes so our first user journey that we're going to do is the easiest one the most simple one it's going to be download and open the app the user is going to say no to registration they're going to be able to interact as a guest and check out all of the free content and view some videos so that is like the most basic flow and we're going to tackle this by user journey so this makes it uh really easy to segment what you're going to do and let's say that things take longer than expected and we get to like our last sprints because jesse has to go back to school and we get back to the last sprint and we've only gotten you know two out of the five user journeys that we had mapped out well that's still a functional app right rather than spending 11 sprints building like the foundation and then at the end of the day you still don't have something that you can publish and people can use so i think this is a really good way to approach it so we're taking this first basic user journey like this is what we want the person to be able to do and we are breaking it out into the tasks that we need to we need to do in order to make that happen and then we are going to plan it out via the across the different sprints so you can see there are a whole bunch of discovery that we had to do for example the courses and the lessons are hosted on a platform called thinkific that's what we use to host all of our content so they had an api and we needed to check that out um the code with chris website is on wordpress so all of the user accounts information uh you know to authenticate users that's on wordpress so that's a completely different platform and we needed to figure out okay across those two different platforms what are we going to do how are we going to connect it to this app uh things like that so anyways that's just a little behind the scenes that sort of this is the next three months i would say maybe two and a half months so uh maybe i'll give you guys an update and you'll probably see me working on some of these tasks on the stream as well so i want to give you guys a little update on the instagram analytics app so if you remember from back then this was with our um previous intern bowen and he's actually coming back to help us parttime because he's he's in school right so he's helping us parttime on this new app with jesse so it's going to be really cool to have multiple people working on it and obviously we have our designer jc who's also there but bowen worked on the instagram analytics app to analyze other people's profiles and give you insights on what other people are doing so that was the app that we built during his internship here and we we did this three month app case study where we i made bowen uh do daily updates on what he was working on and so we have all of these weeks here and i also gave behind the scenes footage because i was pretty in touch with what he was doing so he would write his daily update and i would sort of shoot a video and um and show you guys behind the scenes how things were looking like so that video let me show you the sprints here so you can see same sort of thing but this is for the instagram analytics app and he completed all of these sprints so that's really cool and again bowen came into our company he didn't know he didn't even know swift he didn't even know swift ui so like that really proves to you how quickly you can learn these things right it's but obviously um he probably had an advantage as well because he he was studying computer science and he knew other languages so that definitely gave him a leg up so anyways i want to give you guys an update on that because we had never built an app before to try to get users and try to gain traction so we really didn't know what we were doing and we had some assumptions so we wrote them down uh as to what we thought the process would look like into this product framework and this is something that i imagine to be a work in progress that we would continually refine uh these steps so our current framework was for the instagram app was to have an idea and then validate that with the people uh the market to see if it's something that people would want prototype it and i guess are we missing a build part this prototype oh yes because we wanted to prototype it and i guess what we release with the instagram app is a prototype because we really it's a subset of all the features we have imagined from it uh to get initial users iterate next steps and all that so this that validate actually took it takes a lot longer than we had thought and so during bowen's time here we didn't have enough time to go through this properly and so we decided that um we were gonna go forward anyways and i think that was that was sort of bad but at the same time um our hands were kind of tied so it's almost like right now what we've done with the app is like we've built it we've released our prototype um but now we need to collect feedback and turn it into mold it into something that people would actually want whereas i think you know this step should come first with the cwc app this is not so much an issue because i know you guys and those of you who are in the cwc plus program would immediately find value from this so this is not so much of an issue here but the way that we're approaching how to build this is already different just based on doing user journeys like this this we didn't do any of this with the instagram analytics app that we built before so anyways let me jump into the app store to show you guys uh jeff what is the cwc app it's an app that we are working on to basically for existing members to have an app experience with cwc plus so they can download all of the lessons for offline viewing as well as for new people to find us through the app store and get introduced to our brand all right thank you rose for joining hi pratham okay cool let me where's that that window i had yeah oh looks like i gotta log in again give me a second so i really didn't know what to expect with this because we had launched it and we had not planned to market this very heavily because i didn't feel like this was the end state yet and i feel like i needed to get enough feedback to iterate on it to turn it into something that people wanted to use before like heavily trying to promote it but it's sort of like a chicken and egg scenario because if you don't have people using it how are you going to get the feedback to improve it so i think that was the wrong move that was the lesson learned i think you do have to get it out there um and get people using it so you can collect feedback but make sure you have a feedback mechanism in place right otherwise people are just using it you can't collect the feedback so without any marketing at all uh i guess publishing our updates on youtube was a form of marketing too but i mean we haven't done any paid advertising we haven't like tried to publish articles or something so this is just organic downloads from the app store just people searching for maybe instagram analytics and finding the app you can see that maybe on average it's a profile scorecards is is the name of the instagram analytics app so you can see that there's a there's a bunch maybe four to five a day i would say this is organic um yeah there's nothing to buy in the app right now there's no monetization because that sort of wasn't the focus right now uh there's no banner ads or anything like so no money is being made from this um yeah but eventually i wanted to introduce some sort of monetization to it so i wanted to have like an option to purchase to get some premium features and that sort of thing this is the first time hearing about the app yeah so this instagram analytics app was actually the the three month case study in our cwc uh plus course that we did this this guy right here so our current plan with how we're going to you know what we're going to do with this app um is after wwdc which is now uh we were then going to take a look at the roadmap for this but i think the next step for this is like i actually have to get into the community of people who are focused on their instagram account and want to build it and get their feedback get some feedback because just organically people downloading this i'm not getting enough people using it to really get a sense of whether or not this is helpful for people right we can look at um yeah we can look at how how many people actually return retention that's the word i'm looking for retention and how many people come back to use the app um but i have that somewhere else in another in another platform for analytics so maybe i'll show you guys that next time but i think the next step for me is like i need to get some feedback on this app actually find out if it's useful and if it's not so useful find out what's missing um and then just iterate on that and that's how actually even code with chris has gotten to this point we've tried so many things that really hasn't worked um until we got to this point where you know i think we're reaching a lot more people than before and um yeah we've tried so many different tools so many different workflows so many different things it's just persistence and and iteration i feel like those those are some of the most important skills pagassi we are making a cwc app yeah we are making a cwc app for members of the program to download videos to view offline and also for people to find us through the app store so this is currently an app that's going on um don't know how or if i am going to share this as a case study because i haven't really organized it that way uh but i'll probably share updates with you guys on the stream and i'll be working on tasks on this as well if anything i might as we continue working on the instagram analytics app i'll continue to update the case study here and provide updates there because we're not giving up on this instagram analytics app um i think we've the idea is still unproven right until we actually prove that this is not something that people want and even then if we can't pivot into a direction that people you know that's something that they want we won't be giving up on this app so i really want to crack that code on like how how to make money on the app store because i feel like a lot of people have that aspiration and i can't give you a straight answer on how to do that as well and unless you you know obviously you can hit the jackpot and you can come up with something that has a perfect um fit to what people are looking for and you sort of capitalize on that trend and it just takes off as a rocket ship but i think that's more of the anomaly i think now um more than ever you're building something and you you're treating the app like a business you're not just building an app and then building another one building another one and expect to find success i think you have to iterate on the app and slowly morph it and transform it into its ultimate form where it you know it is pulling in a ton of revenue for you and then at that point you add the paid advertising and scale it up even more anyways those are just my my thoughts obviously unvalidated but that's what i find so interesting about doing this is because i want to i want to figure out this puzzle jeff you had an idea for building a fitness yoga and health app yeah i think the health the health space is really really good to be in because that will never go away people will always be looking for ways to be healthier right to keep fit that's sort of like a basic human need whereas something like this right instagram might go um the way that i was thinking about this instagram analytics before was that uh i was targeting uh maybe people who would be willing to invest in a tool like this to increase their social presence of people who are trying to turn this their instagram profile like into a business so i thought that uh monetizing those types of users um they'd be more willing to spend money because they're spending money to make money essentially but i think the health space definitely is is a great place to be in health and food yeah diet oh man does do you guys work out regularly like keep fit do you guys do uh yoga or stretching you know actually one thing i've always wanted to talk about on this channel which i haven't yet is how we are always on our computers i don't know how how often you guys are on your computers but over time you develop this hunched posture right like your arms are like this your shoulders roll forward and if you're not someone who actively you know who is not active then you're constantly sitting you're constantly hunched forward your neck goes forward and you just get into a really bad posture and i've been trying to correct that posture uh for probably a year now on and off um there are yeah show you guys so you guys might have seen this being advertised on youtube ads or whatever it's it's basically like a back brace and you're supposed to wear it like this and it's supposed to pull your shoulders back and people are trying to sell this thing for like thirty dollars or forty dollars but just go on aliexpress.com and i bought it for five dollars and i wanted to see what it's like so it basically pulls my shoulders back and keeps me in this posture but after using this for a while what i realized is that having this is not going to change your posture it it sort of reminds you because it keeps you from slouching forward but ultimately what you have to do is you have to strengthen the muscles that are weak in your back because of constant hunch and neck forward posture um so you you need to strengthen the muscles to um counterbalance because your body essentially is out of balance now some muscles are stronger and tighter than others and then also neck posture one next stretch that i found really helpful with forward forward neck posture is chin tuck so you go like this so you look like you have a double chin and you go forward and back and forward and back not really fast but do it in a controlled manner and you will hear like some some cracking maybe that's the wrong word because it sounds really extreme but you'll basically release you'll release your neck and it'll feel really good so anyways if you guys are interested in that sort of stuff um let me know i might talk more about it and then there's a you know your hip flexors get tight when you sit a lot so i think maybe because i'm getting older now i'm definitely concerned more about posture and how you know what we're doing to our bodies as we're sitting in this chair and staring at a screen all day yeah issa trying to work out regularly especially since covid not just for physical health but for deaf folks who stare at screens a lot yeah for mental health as well that's good that's good jeff you have online classes for eight hours it's really annoying yeah even even my kids right now because they're doing online schooling so they're staring at a screen all day and i just don't know sort of what sort of impact that has on them because i feel like children should be outside they should be interacting live with with other kids but it is what it is right now actually right now i am fasting and i know it's it's sort of like a trendy thing right now but uh i've been doing it for the last 112 days in a row so i use this app and i actually learned about this app from from revenue cat in their podcast it's called xero and basically i am almost done my fast 30 minutes until i can eat so it's basically uh for me i'm doing an eight hour eating window so i eat from noon to 8 pm and then after that um i don't eat until the following day at noon and so i've been doing this for the screen will load i can show you guys yeah see a hundred and twelve consecutive days so this is pretty cool um and how has it been going well when i combined fasting with uh eating right and like you obviously can't stuff your face with junk during the eight hours but it was actually working to lose uh lose weight if that is your primary concern for me losing weight was kind of just a side benefit but i wanted to see if it would give me more energy right and it would basically just help me in terms of general health and now i've done it for this long it doesn't even feel like i'm doing anything i like i don't feel hungry during the times i don't have to eat uh and well actually one of the big things that it helped curb was eating at night um we had a bad habit ellen and i to sit on the couch at night watch netflix open a bag of popcorn or whatever whatever snack it may be and you know we would snack we would snack and i don't think that's bad within reason but um we were not really within reason i feel and so ever since we started doing this fasting app and i think part of the success that the reason for the success we've had with it for adhering to it is because we're both doing it we're both on board imagine i'm fasting at night and she's you know munching on chips and i don't think that would work so you know we've both been fasting we've been doing this thing uh it's been working out really well basically cold turkey cut all of the snacking at night so i don't know there's something for you you to try if you're trying to curb a bad habit in terms of eating pegasi that the circular progress bars they look good but i can't find good videos for basic progress bar work anywhere beyond super basic because everyone wants to talk about the circle um yeah there are actually a ton of tutorials on there but why why aren't they working out for you like what's wrong with the existing tutorials because one of the app challenges which jesse has done is a hydration app and it uses a um it uses a circular progress bar and when i looked at the code it was actually really easy to do so maybe you can let me know why the existing tutorials out there don't really fit what you're looking for sergio uh you're doing keto keto is i think it's even harder to do i tried that for uh this was years ago when i tried keto uh it was really tough because you can't have any sugar not even from fruits and stuff if i remember correctly and i i was like making my own chocolate because i guess when you go on keto you try to find replacements for that sugar that you've been missing right and so guys hold on sorry about that um what platform do you use to track your timeline such as days for habits like fasting uh i use this app called xero it's free so i mean you can pay for it but i'm not paying for it it you can use all of this for free it'll tell you it you know what you know what it is like you don't really need an app for this but i find that you know just having some button to press to say like okay now you're going to fasting and then another button to press that you're done you're fasting it's sort of like a mental switch for you um and then also it tracks your statistics so it gives you like encouragement like oh you've done how many days in a row and uh it really helps motivate you because you don't want to break the streak so that's all it does and you can use all this for free this is the xero app sergio peanut butter peanut butter peanut butter keto friendly or are you talking about specifically keto friendly peanut butters i don't remember was i eating a lot of peanut butter so many years ago i don't remember but actually it worked so i was on keto for maybe um a month i think um and actually worked but it's hard um if you have a family because you have to prepare different foods unless you put your kids on keto as well pagassi you wanted circle bars but put text in the center but basic progress bars require text outside of the bar i want text zed stacked on the basic bar but in swift ui okay so maybe maybe i'll show you what what jesse did it wasn't he didn't use the progress bar control if if that's what you're talking about um it was literally like drawing circles you said you'd eat your phone after day two yeah as long as the peanut butter doesn't have sugar and daily carb is less than 20 grams it sounds like you're well into keto how long have you been doing it for all right guys i have to go soon um almost lunch time with the family but the next time i'll stream is probably on thursday so check out the stream schedule yeah so i i think it might just be a study session i don't really have anything planned right now i'm sort of planning these on the fly as i'm going but it's great to chat with you guys regardless um just to hang out we'll probably do some studying and some coding it's hard for me to actually code on stream in 1080p right now so if i do do coding it might be 7 20 which kind of kind of sucks yeah i gotta hold up for one more week until the mac mini comes and then we'll stream in 1080p yeah sergio it's hard to it's hard to do keto diet with the with your family and friends if you're preparing your own food then i guess that's not really a problem pegasi will uh i'll share the code that he used in the code crew forum so maybe i'll help you maybe that's what you're looking for no he didn't even use a bezier path or bezier path it was even more simple than that um it was literally a circle with the with just the stroke with a trim to cut out the segment that's missing on the progress and then a rotate anyways i'll show you that code it might be what you're looking for alessandro oh no worries i'm going to be streaming again on thursday so hope to see you there uh will there be new courses on the cwc uh we it will but my pro priority right now is to finish the databases app sorry databases course so right now we are on the last module of the databases course where it really is just getting people introduced to core data firestore database and setting up the prerequisites so that we can start using those skills to build other apps the design course actually is also underway and that's going to move faster because we have two people working on it the designer who's going to be doing the design parts and myself who who's going to show you how to integrate those design assets into xcode so i have a feeling that course is gonna go you know double time and then after that we're gonna be building um apps using all the skills you've learned in the foundations course the database course and the design course together and and yeah it'll be cool it'll be cool because then we can build some cooler stuff if you've gone through those three courses and by the way if anyone is thinking about joining cwc plus today is the last day for our wdc sale no pressure though we always have sales so issa thank you so much for for pointing students our way awesome uh thank you so much srianz thank you easy visual studio i'm not sure does anyone have an idea um about using visual studio i don't think so to be honest i did see something like that before i thought i saw visual studio somewhere but i don't know in what context visual studio for swift yeah you might want to check some of this out i haven't looked into it myself you know what like you might be able to compile swift however you won't get like the ide and xcode for using swift ui i don't think ronin welcome to cwc plus thank you so much for your support i hope you enjoy it yeah sergio yeah finding food without sugar sugars and everything isn't everything so hard is he says the database course different from the firebase stuff that you have from before um i guess the it would i would say yes because it is in a swift ui context the database stuff from before was working in a ui kit context so the syntax is different uh where things are are a little different but in terms of uh how the database works um you know if you get the gist of how to do the crud operations with the database that still is the same it's just syntactically is a little different because of swift ui that's all so you don't have you know it's not going to be completely uh brand new for you if you've already done it before all right guys i gotta call it a date but thank you so much for joining and thank you for your support i really enjoyed hanging out with you guys and chatting with you uh hopefully um i have something else planned otherwise on thursday it'll just be a study in code stream and we'll hang out and chat and we'll build our own stuff alright see you guys later
