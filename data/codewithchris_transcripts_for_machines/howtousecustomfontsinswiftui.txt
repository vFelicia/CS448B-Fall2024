hello and welcome in this lesson you're going to learn how to add your own font files to your xcode project and how to use them all right let's Dive In okay so here I have a brand new xcode project and we're going to take a look at how we can import our custom font to use and then we're going to try to apply it to this text element here first of all I'm not going to go through all of the sites where you can get fonts to use if you're interested in this lesson then you probably already have a font that you want to use inside your app I will just give a word of caution though that a lot of fonts have licenses so you got to take a look at uh is it free for commercial use or personal use it really depends you know how you're using it um a good place is Google fonts as well so you can take a look at that and we're just going to grab a font from here so let's grab this one right here and we'll download the entire family okay all right I should have maybe selected a couple of specific ones that's okay let's unzip the file okay and it comes with these fonts right here now these ttf files sometimes there will be like OTF these are the actual font files and what you're going to want to do is for the one that you want to use you want to include it in your xcode project now let's create a specific group inside our xcode project and we will drag let's say this one Zen Loop Dash regular uh we'll put in there um you have to make sure this part's very critical copy items if needed and add to targets copy items if needed is going to make a copy of that font file inside your project folder and add to targets is going to bundle that font as an asset along with you know when you deploy and publisher app so it's going to make sure that that asset gets included with the amp okay it's just a double check you can highlight your file you can click on open up the inspector here and just make sure Target membership that it is included in your app here it's very important because if this is not included xcode is not going to be able to find this font file when it tries to run the app now the next thing you have to do is register it in the plist file so make sure that this last part is collapsed like that and click this plus icon to add a new key and type in capital f o and and you're going to start to see fonts provided by application you have to type capital F for this autocomplete to pick it up otherwise it's not going to so capital f o n t s we're going to do fonts provided by application this is an array because you can include more than one font if you want let's open up this and you're going to see item zero um so no let's yeah we can add that so we can add this font as item zero now you're going to want to type in exactly that file name here you are specifying the file name that you want to include as a font provided by the application so Zen Loop Dash regular.ttf okay so we're all done here save that if we go back to content view you'll see that there is a font modifier for your text element in in here you can provide a custom font so here you're going to specify the font name and the size of the text that you want just bear in mind that the name that you provide here is the font name and it's not the font file name because this is this name that you see right here is just the name of the font file I could rename this to anything I wanted right and in the P list right here you do specify the file name but when you're specifying the font to use each font actually has a name and it's hard to tell exactly what this name is sometimes it'll be exactly the file name that you downloaded it as but you that's not guaranteed so one way you can find out is by doing some digging one way to do that is you can Loop through all of the fonts that are available to use in your app and then you can you can then peek at the names and you can gain that information then you can go ahead and apply it like this so why don't we go ahead and comment out this modifier for now and then what we're going to do is create an init method so this gets run this method gets run as soon as we launch our app and we're going to use a class called UI font this one has a type method where we can Loop through all of the family names that are available to the app right returns an array of font family names available on the system so we're going to Loop through that we're going to say for family family name in a loop through all of that and we're going to print out the family name now the family name is not necessarily the name of that specific font we want to use because if you take a look at the file folder here Zen Loop is probably the family name but you can see that there's italic and there's regular so those would actually be different fonts names so we have to then Loop through the font names of each family name so then we do another we do another loop so for font name in and then once again we use UI font and we can go through the font names for a specific family name so let's do that and we're going to pass in a family name in here and then we're going to print out I will indent it so it's easier to read and we'll print out all of the font names that are available under the family names so I'm going to launch the simulator now and then it's going to run this code and print this out in the console so we can find out for this Zen Loop family what is the exact font name that we need to put in here and you only need to do this once because once you know well you know okay so as you can see this list is pretty long all of these fonts are probably available on your system and so they're also available to use in here but let's take a look at Zen Loop that should have been near the bottom now if you did this correctly meaning that you specified this key in your P list then you typed in the correct font name sorry file name here as it is and also that when you highlight this font file that it is included in your in your app then it should appear on this list and as you can see this is the family name and this is the font name that we need to specify so let's go ahead and copy that let's go back to the content View and now we don't need this anymore let's just comment all that out or you know what I'm gonna comment it out like this so it's easier for you to copy and paste in case you need that in the future and we're going to specify that name as a string here and for the size I don't know we'll say 16. so let's hit resume and you'll see that it is right there and if we run our app this is a very small font so let's say 36. so that's a little bigger and you can see now there may be an easier way to do this um aside from doing it like this and having to find or discover the font name you could install this font on your system so if you double click it it should open up font book and you can say install this font and what's going to happen is it's going to open up this application on your system called font book so you see the font book right there and if you go to all fonts and you go all the way to the bottom here well that's because that's where Zen Loop is a lot of the times um it will be family name Dash that font so oh and space is removed so this is one way to guess at the font family name but again not guaranteed so for example um zapfino here right I'm guessing that the font name for this font should be zapfino Dash regular so you can try that and you can just see if you're right does that look like zapfino no that doesn't look like it um so maybe this is not the best way to to do that hold on let me uncomment that init and run it again and let's see ah you see I'm wrong the the font name is actually just Zep you know there was no regular so I guess that's why we should do that this sort of looping through the family name and the font names to discover what the actual font name is you could try to guess from the font book but as you just saw it's not going to be a hundred percent all right so now you know how to use custom fonts in your app remember to use this power responsibly and don't put a variety of different fonts into your app I'll see you in the next lesson
