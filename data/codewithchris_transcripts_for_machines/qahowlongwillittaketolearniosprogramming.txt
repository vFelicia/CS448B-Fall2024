hello and welcome to the code with Chris Q&A where I take a couple of minutes to answer questions that you guys have today I have a question that I get a lot as well um I'm trying to cover all of the questions which I get most of the time first uh this one I get a lot from beginners who before they've started learning they want to know how much time they're going to have to invest into learning I programming before they can build their own apps so the question that I get is usually phrased like this how long will it take me to learn iOS programming now this is a really hard question to answer because obviously it depends on how much time you have to dedicate to it um but I can give you a general idea of the learning curve and what that's like from what I've observed uh with my own students so usually for someone with no programming experience uh they're very quickly able to build some simple apps basically understand um some simple logic um construct some simple user interfaces and get an app working in xcode in their simulator and I think that is a very very good first step because it it gives students a sense of accomplishment and usually this can be done in maybe one or two sessions by sessions I mean maybe one or two hours so maybe in total two sessions would be two to four hours that you could build your very first demo maybe even quicker than that depending on how easy it is but um after that point I think it gives you that initial Rush that you know you can do this uh and it will prompt you to dig deeper into it and for a lot of people what usually happens is that after creating that demo uh and they dig deeper into it they start to hit a little bit of frustration and the reason for that is because the initial demo usually is a very easy kind of like follow what I do type of thing click here click there um just so you can you know help the students get their feet wet and get them excited um but then following that when you actually have to learn mechanics and concepts of the programming language and um you know different programming design patterns and stuff like that it starts getting into territory where um you know it's foundational knowledge that you need to know but it might not be you know the funnest thing to learn so in my courses that I offer on my site I try to incorporate these Concepts um into building a slightly more complex app um just so it's not as dry so it's not like you're you know you're reading a textbook or something like that uh so that seems to work well um and then also after that initial demo app you're you're starting to build slightly more complicated apps and even with the most seasoned programmers you're going to have bugs uh and bugs are basically um either logic that you coded incorrectly or maybe it was even incorrect logic to begin with so you start running into errors in your app uh and then you're going to have to figure out how to solve them so there's a little bit of problem solving and there's a little bit of debugging which is just the process of finding the source of those errors and resolving them so there's a little bit of that which some people may not find um you know as fun so at this point some people give up because it turns out that learning programming is harder than they thought or more time intensive than they thought uh so I always caution it's really important to have the appropriate mindset expectations and goals when you learn iOS programming you know you're learning a skill and you want to come out knowing that skill if you just want kind of the end result and you don't really care about learning programming at all then maybe you should consider buying app templates or hiring someone to build the app which you know you might find more success with so anyways you're learning the programming language at this point um it's getting a little bit frustrating but then once you kind of get through this hump it's what I call the hump once you get past this semi difficult part um your world kind of opens up because uh once you understand it and it clicks then you're just Off to the Races and you can you know what whatever you want to do in your app there's probably a tutorial out there for it and whereas before you couldn't understand that tutorial because you didn't have that foundational knowledge uh you couldn't read code and you didn't understand the concepts but now you do so all of these tutorials and possibilities are open to you and kind of the sky the limit at this point uh so for a a lot of people once they make it past that hump they discover the joy of building apps and and programming so that's kind of of the learning curve um how fast you go through it will depend on you know whether you dedicate a couple of hours a day or maybe a couple of hours every couple of days or something like that and it'll depend on you know how fast it clicks for you because programming is is very logic based um so if you're not used to that kind of thinking then it may take some people longer for some people it may take faster but the one thing I advocate is that don't just read or watch videos you have have to have to have to practice and and that means you need a Mac and that means you need xcode or maybe some of the other um Solutions which I outlined in another Q&A video for the PC but you have to practice and because I found that by practicing that is actually the fastest way to learn uh for me when I first started learning I just read the book cover to cover and when I wanted to start I didn't know how to start I realized that I understood all the material while I read it but I didn't understand how to apply it so when you're reading that tutorial you're watching that lesson it's important to stop um and then try it out for yourself and you're going to encounter problems uh but part of it is that after you figure out you know how to overcome that problem it it almost becomes a memory in your head and uh helps you remember the concepts and what you're learning a lot faster than if you had just read it or watched it so what I usually do when people ask me this question just to summarize is that I take the amount of video in my course which is about 27 hours and then I just tack on about an hour and a half for every hour of video so I usually say something like dedicate 60 hours UH 60 to 75 hours to the course and how fast you get through that course will depend on how much time you spend on it dayto dat uh and after finishing that course you will be able to build your own simple apps and put together you'll be able to read and write code put together user interfaces make multiple screen apps and stuff like that but then if you want to learn the more slightly advanced stuff where you're working with databases and web services and you know you're transferring data or saving photos to a database sitting in some server like that is the next step then you have to dedicate more time to learning that stuff uh if you just want to count you know getting down the basics you're able to build your simple basic apps then I'd say you know to get through my course at least this about 75 hours so I hope that answers your question and I hope you guys enjoyed it and will join me for the next Q&A now if you found this helpful I would really appreciate it if you followed subscribed liked and rate uh and share it with your friends and colleagues thank you so much and I'll see you guys next time bye for now
