hey code crew it's Chris here so a lot has happened in the past week I hope you're all safe and I hope your families are safe and healthy as well as for my family and I we're just stuck at home so you should still see new tutorials coming on this channel but having said that I feel so fortunate and blessed to be operating in the online space because I can still do stuff I can't imagine how hard it is if you're unable to work during this time and unable to provide for your family and I think the worst part is that there's no clear indication of when we'll resume our normal lives and what that new normal might look like one of the groups of people that I'm trying to help are indie developers who rely on the App Store to feed their families from what I've seen and heard many indie developers have suffered big drops inapp revenue so in the coming weeks I'm going to be showcasing some of these apps from these indie developers if you think the app is cool and you're financially in a good spot then please consider showing some support this initiative was actually started by Johnson Dell and I'll provide the link to the page in the description below so if you yourself are an indie developer in need then definitely visit that page and add your name to the list that's all for now stay tuned for some new content on the channel and again I hope you are all safe and healthy and I'll see you guys in the next video
