if you haven't heard widgets on iOS can be interactive now and this is so exciting to me because it presents a new way and a new opportunity for people to use your app now I downloaded the xcode 15 and iOS 17 betas and did some experimentation and this is what I came up with let me show you how simple it is to add this interactivity to your widget now you might be in one of these two scenarios number one you don't have an app and you don't have a widget and if that's you make sure you watch the end where I will give you some tips and guidance on what to do or you might be part of scenario 2 where you already have an app that has a widget and you just want to add some interactivity to that widget and that's what we're going to cover right now okay so step one first you need to understand what sort of interactivity can you add to your widget in iOS 17. for now the only interactive elements you can add to your iOS widgets are buttons and toggles now step two you need to understand what actually happens when the user Taps on that button or toggle on your widget so when the user Taps on a button or a toggle on your widget an app intent that you've defined gets triggered if you're unfamiliar with this term think of an app intent as a piece of functionality that you code that can be executed outside of your app by System services or other apps for example your app content that does something in your app can be triggered by Siri or perhaps the shortcuts app and now even through buttons and toggles on your widget so step two is to create an app intent that performs the task that you want to trigger when the user Taps on that button or toggle on your widget Now app intents aren't a new thing in ww23 so I won't cover them in this video they were actually introduced back in 2020 as a way for your app to interact with Siri kit I'll include some links in the description to app intent tutorials that you could follow to build one for your own app and finally step 3 add the button or the toggle to your widget UI there are new initializers for the Swift UI button and toggle components that you can use in your widgets UI to invoke an app intent when they are triggered so let's dive into xcode and take a look at how that works so here I've got the widget this is what it looks like so far there is no interactivity with this widget it does show a streak though when I up on it it launches the app and then this is what happens it updates but when I tap on it it just launches the app so let's dive into the UI code for this widget which is here and I'm going to add a button right under the ring and I'll show you how easy it is so there is a new uh button there's a new initializer for the button this one right here where you can pass in an app intent and then also have a label for what the button looks like when the button is tapped it's going to invoke that app intent so I've already coded one up and all it does is it puts it logs one streak to the to the data store which is just app storage so we've got that that's the name of my app intent and as for the label I'm going to show a simple just Plus one so see if that shows up in the preview I'm also going to add some padding and it makes the button just a little bit wider and a little easier to tap on now just to remind you this is xcode 15 and iOS 17 in beta so depending on when you're watching this things may have changed and this also may be buggy because it's beta software but I still think it's interesting and worth taking a look at how it works so this is the widget now it has a button when I tap on it you can see that it actually invokes my app intent which um which goes to increase the streak and you can see how the numbers change you can see the numbers kind of flipping up that animation right there animating numerical text is simply with this modifier this content transition passing in numeric text for the streak that's how easy it is to get that effect it's really cool right and that's how it works and just like that you've got an interactive widget beautiful now what about scenario one where you don't have an app and you don't have a widget well for starters flow's masterclass on how to build widgets with Widget kit is a great start and if you want me to create a walkthrough stepbystep video of how I built the streaks app with the interactive widget and having them share the same data comment below with I love widgets alright thanks for watching and stay tuned for more ww23 content alright see you next time
