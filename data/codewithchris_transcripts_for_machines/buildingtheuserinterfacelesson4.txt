in this video you're going to be building the user interface for our demo app in xcode after that we're going to be able to integrate the revenue cat sdk and display our inapp purchases with just a few snippets of code hey code crew i'm chris and welcome to code with chris the place to be if you want to learn how to code and build apps now this is lesson four of the revenue cat video series if you missed the previous lessons just check that playlist over there here's where we are in our seven step process all right let's get started all right now i'm going to show you how to build out that demo that you saw earlier in the beginning of this tutorial and i won't spend too much time on this because uh really the main point of this video is to show the revenue cat in that purchase stuff so i'm just gonna breeze through this a little bit i just added two graphic assets one for a picture paris and one for compass that we can use on the paywall screen so i'm going to go ahead and go in the main storyboard and i'm going to add a stack view here and i'm not going to explain too much about what i'm doing here in terms of auto layout and how the elements work we have a 29 lesson beginner series that you should definitely check out which would explain a lot of this stuff to you and so here i'm just going to breeze on by so let's go ahead and add a label to our stack view and this is just going to say paris and let's make this bold and we'll also make this spacing 20. here we're going to add the image this is going to be an image of paris and we are going to we're going to add a constraint to this image and say that it's got a maximum height of 400 and then we're going to add another label under that image view oops right here and i've got some text prepared for that we got to make it a multiline so we can actually see it and then we've got a little subheading here city tours so we'll just bold that and i'm actually going to add some margins to this stack view i shouldn't have made it zeros all across and for this image let's make it aspect fill okay and then after that let's add another label down here and i've got some text prepared for that this is going to be multiline and then finally we're going to add a button here and what we're going to do here for this button is say join pro for tours we're going to change the background of this button to let's say say indigo and we'll change the text color to white and we're going to add an image for map in in the lips let's say that and the tint color let's use white as well we'll add a space so it looks something like that that's the button we have all right now for the second screen there's going to be our paywall so i'm going to add a new con view controller here and we're going to create a new class to represent that so go ahead choose new file let's choose coco touch class because we're going to be subclassing ui view controller i'm going to call this the pro view controller and let's go ahead and create that class there and then we're going to set this view controller we added set the custom class to that pro view controller and we're gonna draw a segway from the button to here and we're gonna say show so that button is going to lead to our pay wall where they can purchase something if we check that on launch the user is already on the pro access entitlement then instead we're going to show some labels as the tours otherwise we're going to show the button here that would lead them to the paywall that we have here all right so for this view controller let's go ahead and add a stack view a vertical stack view just like before we're going to put some elements in there okay this time i'm going to do 20s all around and then i'm going to put in a label and this is going to be tor app pro i'm going to add another label and for this one i've got the text ready here copy and paste it in there and change the number of lines to zero so it's going to be multiline and then we're going to add an image so this image is going to be the pro one it's actually really big so it's pushing everything out of the way but we're gonna change the change to the aspect fill like that and we're also going to restrict the height of it to the height of the stack view so i'm holding down control drag it to the stack view and you're going to be able to say equal heights you check out that constraint and saying that image width is equal to the super view width okay so for this stack view i'm going to change the alignment to leading actually and that didn't actually change anything but let's take a look at these errors that we have here all right so set vertical compression resistance so i definitely don't want the labels to be compressed if there's not enough space which is why the image takes up everything so we're going to set the compression resistance for the two labels to be higher than the image and that way they'll never get squished out of view like they are being done now so we're going to set the content compression resistance higher for these labels for both of them higher than the image all right so then we fix that so for this stack view i'm also going to set the spacing to 20 just like the other one and i'm going to put a little icon up there above the heading so we're going to add another image view right there and we're going to select the same one we had before that little it's really small right now so it's really hard to see but why don't we go ahead and give that a little height and width let's say 60 and 100 so you can see it and then we're going to change the tint color to black so that's what our tour app paywall looks like but the buttons to purchase the annual or or the monthly subscription are going to be automatically generated through code because what we're going to do now is have our app connect to the revenue cap platform to pull down that information that we had configured and then we're going to programmatically generate those buttons and insert them into the view hierarchy so that the user can see them so there's a couple of things we need to do we need to add the revenue cat sdk to our project and then we're going to be able to connect to the platform and check if the user has pro access if they have that entitlement if they do we're going to get rid of this button and then we are going to display some uh itinerary information i'm just going to put some labels in there just for show if they don't have that entitlement for pro access then we are going to leave the button as is and when they click that it's going to go over to this screen and that's when we're going to go fetch our products and then generate those buttons to insert here so that they can actually buy the subscription all right great job with this now we're primed to integrate the revenue cat sdk in the next lesson if you haven't signed up for your free account yet you can do so through cwc.to revcat4 now i want to turn it over to you in your app would you rather do onetime inapp purchases or renewable subscriptions let me know by leaving a quick comment below and lastly if you're enjoying this series so far please give this video a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe so you don't miss any future lessons in the next lesson we're going to integrate revenue cat to our xcode project we're going to add the couple of code snippets that's going to let us display our offers take transactions and to check user access levels thanks for watching i'll see you in the next video
