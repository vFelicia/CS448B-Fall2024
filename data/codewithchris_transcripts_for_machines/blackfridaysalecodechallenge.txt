hey guys happy Black Friday first note I have a sale on my courses they're 40% off so if you're interested check out the link in the description below on a side note I'm interested to find out what you guys have bought or are planning to buy this weekend so let me know that in the comment section below and if you want to find out what I bought so far stick around to the end of the video okay first up Koh challenge I'm happy to report that I received several submissions for last week's couch challenge so thank you for that I've posted my solution for that challenge and you can find that in the description below as well now I formalized the ko challenge a little bit so number one each Friday I'm going to be posting the details of the code challenge how to submit it what the requirements are in this link and you can find that link in the description below as well and then number two every week I will also post my solution for that challenge now I want to warn you that the solution that I post is not the only solution because there are always tons of solutions out there and also it may not be the best solution so you guys might even come up with better solutions than me but it might be interesting you know to compare so number three all of the people who complete the code challenge each week will are in a limited edition badge that you can only get that week for that challenge I'm gonna have a wall of fame listing all of the badges and people who have earned them now you might ask why do I want these badges thank you for asking aside from appealing to the collector and everyone your badges are going to earn you special perks and privileges that I am going to reveal in next week's video there's a little hint it may involve gifts or money possibly find out in next week's video all right so I know some of you guys may be grumbling because last week I never mentioned anything about rewards badges money nothing like that so I am extending last week's challenge to next Friday so this upcoming week you can complete the challenge from last week and this week's challenge as well and earn the badges for both of them so I hope you take advantage of that alright so this week's challenge this week you're going to be working with code I want you to write a function that takes in a string and it checks that string for either lowercase or uppercase A's and it returns an integer either returns zero for no A's in that string or it returns the total count of lowercase and capital uppercase A's in that string you'll find all of the particulars specifics requirements even some sample input in the weekly challenge thread which you can find in that link there's also a reddit thread which i've created for that challenge where you can discuss with other people who are working on it and get some help if you're stuck or something like that so there's is that available alright so that is it for the challenge next up we have the Q&A segment now we only got one question this week so I highly encourage you guys to submit questions for next Friday's video where I'll do the Q&A again and you can ask me any questions like personal business you know anything you want to know about me my life you know it doesn't have to be technical questions I just want this to be fun and a way to engage with you guys alright so this week's question from Dave Noel's on Twitter what Mac are you using it seems so much quicker to start the simulator than my brandnew Mac any tricks to speed it up so to answer question the videos that you see I actually edit out the loading time of the some layers because I don't want people waiting around for the simulator to load so what you might be seeing is that you might think my instantaneous when it really isn't but to answer your question I'm using a retina 5k iMac it's a 27inch but I upgraded the RAM to 32 gigs of ram and it's got an SSD hard drive I believe there was one viewer who had 4 gigs of ram on their macbook and they were experiencing slow simulator load times when they upgraded their RAM to 16 gigs they experienced significant improvements so I would try upgrading the RAM as kind of like the cheapest solution first and if that doesn't work then you can see if there is a deeper problem than that so that's it for the Q&A this week I highly encourage you guys to submit your questions for the Q&A I'm going to do next Friday remember it doesn't have to be technical questions can be personal you know within reason it could be about my background about my experiences about business whatever okay so in the last bit of news we have a shiny new subreddit you can find it in this link below come hang out share what you're working on share what you're having trouble with if you're having trouble with one of my tutorials post it there as well I can find it sometimes hard to write code in the YouTube comments so I want the subreddit just to be a place where we can all hang out get to know each other interact with other fans of code with Chris and yeah I hope to see a lot of you guys on the subreddit alright so that's it for this week's video before I show you guys what I picked up for Black Friday there's one Black Friday deal that I want to mention and this has to do with all of the motion graphics that you see on my videos all the icons in the thumbnails of my videos and even in my blog articles I use this everywhere and this is a deal by icons eight.com so this site basically provides icons for all of your icon needs and if you they don't have the icon that you need they'll make it for you so I use this stuff everywhere you'll see on my website like I mentioned and videos and apps and stuff like that so I have a subscription I paid one hundred and ninety nine dollars for it per year and my current subscription lasts till the end of June 2018 but they release the deal that's only valid for this weekend it's ninety nine dollars a year so that's fifty percent off I've bought it anyways even though I have another 7 months left in my subscription and so that's basically wasted but I wanted this lifetime deal of 99 dollars per year so that's what I wanted to mention it to you guys if you guys want to build apps icons 8 has all of the icons you could need so go check that out in the link in the description below I want to mention that this is an affiliate link so I do get a kickback for it and if you purchase it through my link I thank you sincerely for supporting me and the channel I've been using them for almost a year and I have nothing but good things to say about them alright so that's that let me show you what I bought for Black Friday so I was waiting to pick up these guys the Apple earpods I really like unfortunately they didn't go on sale for Black Friday so I had to buy them full price but I was waiting for a long time and I couldn't wait any longer I also bought a chromecast I actually have an Apple TV but I wanted to try out the chromecast I picked up the Google home Mini because the home pod isn't out yet and I wanted to try this guy out kind of regret it now because it doesn't work with my Apple music subscription there are some rooms in my house that my wife I can't reach so this has actually solved that problem so highly recommended quite expensive though kind of pricy so that's what I've got so far share with me what you guys have picked up or trying to pick up in the comment section below thanks for watching I'll see you guys next week
