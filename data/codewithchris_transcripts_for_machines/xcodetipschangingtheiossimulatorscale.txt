hey guys it's Chris here and today I'd like to show you guys a handy tip with the iOS simulator in Xcode now sometimes I see people who are maybe running the simulator for the first time but they've got the simulator really large and they ask me the simulator is too large for my screen how do I fix that well you can actually go up to the window here and go to scale and you can change the scale level there are five different settings so right now I'm at a hundred percent you can see it's even too large for my screen and you can change it all the way down to 25% and notice the shortcut keys here from command one to command five so let's take a look at what 25 percent looks like when you run the app here and this app is just a sample app from my course it's it's something that the students build together so this is zoom level five and if I go command four it's a little bigger command three command two and command one which is at a hundred percent and you can see there's scroll bars here but I could just make that bigger so there you have it if your simulator is too large for your screen try hitting command five right and then that's the smallest zoom level then you command four and then you can get it to just the right size with command one being the largest or you could go up to window here and go to scale making sure that you have the simulator at the forefront so you're looking at the iOS simulator menu and not the Xcode menu because then you won't see it if you're looking at Xcode all right so I hope that is a handy tip for you guys and stay tuned for more see you guys next time you
