hey guys welcome to iOS programming Basics where I'm going to take you from scratch to building iPhone apps even if you have no programming background now previously on YouTube I've got a bunch of different series some on xcode some on Objective C and uh reading the feedback I saw that a lot of people were confused with which videos they should watch and which uh which series they should follow now I've revamped the lesson plan starting with this video um and this is the one that you should follow and it's going to be designed to take you from you know through all of the programming Basics and Concepts to building apps in no time now the other really exciting thing about um this new series is that uh the I'm going to take a very practical approach um to teaching now how I learned iOS myself I I failed I literally I read book from cover to cover and then I sat down in front of the keyboard and I proceeded to try to build an app but what I realized is that I I I retained very little of that knowledge because I wasn't actually practicing as I was reading I understood the concepts because I I had a programming background and I felt confident but once you know I put my my fingers to the keyboard I realized that I actually couldn't do it so then I started doing tutorials on the net starting to build like small demo applications um to lay the building blocks of my iOS education and that's actually how I eventually learned iOS programming so that's the that's the approach that I'm going to take here where we're going to just Dive Right In and we're going to um you're going to learn through doing and through building apps and that's the approach I'm going to take to teach you rather than teach you all of the concepts and all of the theory up front we're going to learn that along the way while building demos and building apps together so let me show you guys the lesson plan as you can see covering the basics uh we have only a couple of videos but then we jump right into doing a hello world demo and then we do a recap and I'll explain to you um you know some some of the concepts that that we learn through doing that demo and then we Pro uh we proceed to doing another demo and again you know this is the approach that I want to take uh by actually getting you guys to follow along open up xcode practice and I'll explain these Concepts along the way and I think they'll be easier to absorb for you guys and plus it will stick better um and then after we finish the basics we're going to actually try a little bit more complex of an app so this dice roll application is something that you guys might have seen before in some of my previous videos but I'm going to revamp it a little bit and I'm going to take you guys step by step through it and then we're going to do another application to practice it's a soundboard application you guys have seen this in the App Store where you press buttons and play some sounds and again this will teach us um New Concepts such as how to how to play media and how to use scroll views and creating settings menus and stuff like that so very very practical stuff and from there we're going to continue to move on building harder and harder apps as you build your skills and this is literally How I Learned iOS programming myself and I know you guys will learn it the same way so I hope you guys follow along for the ride and keep watching
