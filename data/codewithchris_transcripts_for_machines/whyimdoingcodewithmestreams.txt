have you heard of mukbang i don't even know if i'm saying it right but essentially it's just someone live streaming themselves eating food yeah you heard that right you just tune in and you watch someone eat and at first i didn't understand why someone would do this but then the more i thought about it the more it started to make sense you see it's a way to do something social maybe you live alone and you don't have anyone to eat with well you can tune in eat your meal and now you're not eating alone another example which i recently discovered is study with me live streaming and i didn't even know this was a thing people live streaming themselves studying and you can't even see what they're studying you just watch them sit there not moving studying and while this sounds extremely boring trust me there are a ton of people who tune in and then that got me thinking what would a code with me live stream look like the more i thought about this the more it grew on me you see i think most of us code alone especially now that everyone is doing everything remotely but what if we just got together hung out and coded together we'd be doing our own things and then on our coding breaks or study breaks we could interact with the chat and it would be like we were coding together physically apart but together virtually and i think at least for some of you that doing something together as a group would serve as motivation to get some more coding practice in so if you think that would help you please give this video a thumbs up personally for me i know it would keep me accountable to study and to code especially since i will have a live stream schedule so there's a set place and a set time for everybody to come together and do some coding now keep in mind that i won't be talking and i won't be teaching and you might not even be able to clearly see what's on my screen because that's not what the point of this is the point is to study or code together or if you'd like just come and hang out in the group chat so here's the schedule that i'm thinking about for the first week we're just gonna try it out and do an hour each day and then depending on how that goes we'll set the schedule for the following week you'll find the link to the schedule in the description below or just visit cwc.to livestream so what do you think i hope you can join in on one of these sessions if you're planning to and you think you might be able to drop a comment below to say i'll be there now this is the first time i'm doing something like this and i really hope it's gonna encourage more people to start coding and get some more coding practice in i know for me it's gonna help me learn new things and also to get a ton of practice in thanks for watching and i hope i'll see you there you
