hey it's chris here wanted to give you a quick update on the state of the app so i think we're really really close we're just working out some uh some of the bugs which i'll point out for you uh so this is a fresh launch of the app this is the uh the onboarding sequence please note that we do have you know some little um graphical uh glitches still to work out so as you see that dimmed screen is not uh full screen which will work out so we have our threestep onboarding process like i've showed you before what we've added is this little notice here that this is a sample profile so when they look at this this is not a real profile right some of the things which we need to work out are right now tapping on these or tapping and holding on these don't pop up the tooltip for the dummy profile which you know we want to show people what this metric is about when they tap and hold on to it the other thing is that videos aren't showing up uh it's more actually it's more like in the data that comes back we haven't handled the video case just yet so we're gonna find a way to handle that gracefully uh and yeah so this is the unlogged in state so people are going to launch the app go through that threestep you know little mini tutorial they're going to be able to play around with the sample profile we added this because we sent this to our team to test and they were confused when after they went through that threestep onboarding process and they got dropped here they were confused as to what this was there's like a lot of information here and i i sort of agree if more people give us that feedback we might just do three step onboarding and then like direct to call to action to log in but right now as it stands you get to play around with the profile a little bit and then it tells you to click on the list tab to log in so when you come here uh we'll have instructions as to you know what you have to do go ahead and click login and then let me go ahead and log in all right so it's gonna let me log in and because i've selected you know which instagram account i wanted to use already um that's already all set up oops oh man i cancelled the sign in process accidentally okay i'm gonna hit continue as chris ching it's gonna come in again this is one of those visual glitches we definitely want this to be full screen blue uh we're gonna click not now and we've also decided just in the interest of time um we are gonna ignore premium now so we're not even gonna bring that up we're not going to talk about that and we're going to launch it without premium so it'll be no monetization then we'll add it in a next update so this screen probably won't make it into the launch okay so they're going to see this feed you're not following anyone yet then they're going to add someone like for example myself or maybe i'll just do maybe i'll do apple just switch it up okay so there's apple and we've styled the screen a little bit you can see the tabs still need a little bit of work in terms of how they look we have the blue dot but the blue dots have cut off and the icon is touching the edge there and when they tap into apple they can see some of apple's stats right there when you tap that you can bring up that again the dim screen is not fully to the edges and uh yeah the setting screen we don't really have much here except the log out and this premium stuff we're gonna hide this tab altogether so that's how the app looks right now i'd say like we're really close to just launching and things will become a lot clearer a lot more clear after we launch right after people start using it in the app store and giving us feedback i think a lot of the guesswork that we've done will confirm or deny you know we might have to rework some things maybe the flow isn't um isn't intuitive something like that so we'll we'll figure it out but i really want to get this to launch first um that way we can work on some of the marketing stuff um and we can also work on some of the feedback that comes back and we'll definitely i definitely want to monetize the app just so i can get some experience with um what that is like put the revenue cat stuff into production and that would be good i'm really looking forward to that um and i also already have some ideas for the next apps that i want to do so i'm you know this experience this case study has been really good in the sense that it's sort of opened the floodgates for my imagination now i want to build more apps and we're going to continue doing these case studies so that you can sort of get a behindthescenes real look at what this process is like and as we do it more i think the process is going to get more refined right we're going to understand uh how best to do it and i'll update the product framework with our process as it solidifies anyways hope you're enjoying it so far thanks for um being a supporter thanks for watching and following along i'll see you in the next video
