hey youtubers what's up it's Chris here and today I'm recording this from my home office now you might be wondering this is not the usual type of video you see on this YouTube channel the reason I'm doing this today is because in the previous video we talked about updating the hearthstone and Magic Hat apps resubmitting them to the App Store building some new apps and try to make money from the App Store and I realized that that sort of app journey that we're about to take together is best documented in this sort of vlogging format and so you're still going to see the tutorials where I show you demos and I'm trying to teach a specific thing but when I'm updating you guys on the progress of the apps update you guys on how much money we're making and that sort of stuff I'm gonna be doing it in this sort of vlogging format so today though we're going to be downloading Xcode 9 beta we're going to be loading up the hearthstone and magic have app apps on the exponent beta and we're gonna see what breaks I do expect a lot to break and you might be wondering also why I haven't gone the beta yet and usually that's because I don't like playing with the Apple beta software I find that sometimes they can be pretty buggy now that you can do standalone you can you know have Xcode eight and nine side by side then it's a lot better but before you had to kind of replace it we're getting close to the point in time where the Xcode 9 beta will become you know officially released so it should be pretty stable at this point and plus now I actually have to use the beta because we need to update the apps and get them out in time for the new app store format and when iOS 11 comes out everyone's gonna be updating their OS and stuff like that so gotta bite the bullet so that's what we're gonna do today we're gonna see what breaks and then possibly fix some depending on what what the time looks like but before we do any of that I just want to give you guys a tour of the office I work in every day because I realized that I haven't done that before and this is my home office this is not the office rental I had last year which I had to give up and that's a story for another time so let's start with what's directly behind me got this backdrop frame which I set up because I was planning to record some more professionallooking videos tutorials and stuff like that but after I set up it's just a frame right now I realized that this room isn't big enough for the frame it's not wide enough so I probably have to move that into the living room downstairs and on this wall I have some audio foam which when I moved into this house last year I had nothing in this room except for my computer and a speaker and when I was recording there were a lot of echoes so I had to find a quick solution I jumped on Amazon and I wanted to get some morning foam I really wanted the professional blacklooking audio foam that you see in recording studios but that stuff is expensive so I opted for this kind of gnarly looking pink and gray foam which definitely doesn't look great but it did the job and now at this point I think I can probably take them down because I have furniture and I have carpet and it does a pretty good job of stopping the echoes from happening or maybe I will splurge and get that black foam I don't know it's it's gonna be a tossup okay so on this wall I've got my iMac that I work on sorry for the shaky camera I still trying to get used to this vlogging type of thing and this I bought recently it's a sit stand desktop riser so I can adjust it in two sitting position I can lower it all the way down there and sit and work or I can kind of raise it to the standing level and I found out that that's really helped me because after lunch when I eat pretty heavy meal pretty sluggish and I find that standing up and working really helps get my circulation going and I don't feel as tired and from sitting half the day standing actually feels pretty good you'd think that standing would be tiring but after sitting and then you starts to stand it kind of I guess gets your blood flowing and it feels pretty good actually so I didn't want to buy an entirely new desk so that's why I got this and it was a fraction of the price that a brandnew adjustable desk would cost so that's what I did and whatever we got here on this side of the wall we've got more audio foam and some more desk furniture and that's pretty much it as you can see it's not a very big room and there's a closet on this side but that closet doesn't even contain my stuff it contains my wife's clothing it's like an extra storage closet for her so as you can see this room is pretty small but it works so far it does get pretty hot but hey you know I'm not complaining I'm not paying you know seven eight hundred dollars a month for the office that I was renting anyways we're gonna get started we're gonna get Xcode 9 beta and then we're going to get those absolute it up hey guys before we launch Xcode 9 and open up our apps there's just one thing I want to mention and it's a little bit of a pet peeve because I've been getting a lot of beginners asking me should they start with Swift 4 or should they start with Swift 3 should they use exco 9 or Xcode 8 now that's a very valid question because the thing is when you google Xcode to download it you're going to find you're gonna be brought to this page you're gonna be brought to a page like this posts going to say what's Nealon Xcode 9 and you're then going to log in and up here Xcode 9 beta 6 is listed first before the stable releases down here where is it right here Xcode 8 point 3 3 and then when you go into the Mac App Store and you want to look for Xcode to download it's going to list Xcode 8 so there's a lot of confusion around there and on this page I feel like they should be listing Xcode 8 first because you want to be you want people to be using the staple software first or an but obviously Apple has their own agenda they want people to you know adopt the latest so in my opinion I feel like Xcode 8 should be listed first on this page as to not confuse beginners who are trying to download Xcode to learn and plus there's not a lot of support out there right now for Xcode 9 and Swift for because it's so new right it's still beta software so if you're a beginner and you want to start developing and learning Swift download Xcode 8.33 that's the latest version of Xcode 8 and you're going to be using Swift 3 but when Xcode Knight comes out officially you're gonna update and get that and as a beginner most of the changes in Swift 4 you're not really going to see because you're going to be going through stuff like you know objects you're going to be learning about classes and variables and properties and stuff and that stuff is is just gonna be remain constant now in a couple of videos maybe next week or the following week I'm going to list out the changes for you in Mexico 9 versus Xcode 8 and the changes between X to a foreign sorry Swift for and Swift 3 so watch out for those so for now let's go back to Xcode 9 beta and open up our projects alright so here we are let us try to open let's say the hearthstone YouTube app first in Xcode 9 alright let's see what happens super outdated somewhat okay okay hope unjust stuff Wow I don't have a lot of faith that this is actually going to run so let's see what's this built with objectivec man it's been so long I don't even remember yeah and it looks like it was see this is how long ago this was actually here's the date 2014 March 20th Wow okay definitely I'm not going to be able to update this up here in this video I didn't even remember that this was built with objectivec it's been that long it's been over three years okay anyways let's run it looks like it's going to be a little more work than I anticipated but that's fine build failed all right looks like I'm gonna have to update some libraries anyways I'm not going to do this here we haven't even gotten to yeah the majority of the errors I'm sure after I update this library and get rid of this error we're gonna have a whole ton of other errors okay let me just close that and we are going to try to open the magic hatton one let's see what happens this one's a little more well organized this one wasn't Swift see unsupported Swift version migrated oh I have to use Xcode eight first to migrate the code to Swift three is that what it's saying I'm just gonna run it anyways boom failed yeah let us just try changing the target here deployment target 11 so you sent to sort it okay I need to go into the build settings always fun updating your apps Swift language version let's say Swift for maybe Swift 3 for now compiling I might actually have to 463 errors amazing but you know why it there are so many errors is because there's quite a bit of generated code here so I don't know if I mentioned but all of the animations in this app were done by something called Core animator so let me see if I can just pull it up right now Core animator this guy so ray and I used this core animator to basically do the animation so ray did the artwork he did it in Illustrator I believe and each section of the animal was cut out in little pieces and this one allowed us to do the the animations for each of the like the arms and the legs independent of the body and and really he built those animations from the ground up from scratch and then you can export those animations as a UI view and it would be we would have methods it would generate these methods to run specific animations so that's how we did that and as you can see fuse where was it as it under helpers or was it under libraries no we had core and we're here it is so for example for a lion there was a lion view dot swift and this guy would you know it's actually a ton of code and we didn't write any of this this was generated from core animator alright and then here are the images so as you can see here's an a lion arm lower arm upper arm body this is a cheek there's the eyes it doesn't look like much like this but when you put it together you know it will actually look like the lion in the app there's the mouth so you can see how many different pieces there were so obviously the generated code is not up to with Swift three or four because this was done a while back so it was Swift too and so that's why there are so many errors because I will probably have to go into Lyon view here and some of the syntax you know like this for example capital C Center has been renamed to lowercase C Center this is one of the changes they did in Swift three like that so that fixes that error but there is a ton of those errors in all of these different files and what I could do is probably if Ray has the original core animator files I could probably just run it through do the export again and Core animator will hopefully spit out you know Swift 3 compatible versions or maybe even Swift 4 but I highly doubt it at this point and or I would be surprised that they did pleasantly surprised if they did that so I could do that and that would probably get rid of a lot of the errors or I can just do a mass search and replace because a lot of these are pretty selfexplanatory for example this capital essence that is now a lowercase s and in Swift 3 they they did a lot of these changes just for consistency because they started following where all of these decent enums were following this sort of camelcase and so they fixed up a lot of those those little things so a lot of these errors this 591 errors they're not very serious ones ok so I guess we we won't really be able to get this done in this video so I'm gonna take this away and I'm going to work on this get it all fixed up and then the next time we talk we'll be able to look at the the finished product so alright at least now we know what we're dealing with alright so before I get to work on those projects there's one question I want to ask you guys so today I give you a tour of my little home office now based on what you saw I want to ask you do you think I cleaned up this room in order to shoot this vlog for you guys so I did a comment in the comment section below and either put yes or no whether or not you think I cleaned up I'm going to show you guys one more time what this office looks like and then you can tell me if you think I'm a messy person or I'm generally disorganized so take a look here's the desk alright so let me know what you guys think and I'll see you guys in the next vlog see you later right
