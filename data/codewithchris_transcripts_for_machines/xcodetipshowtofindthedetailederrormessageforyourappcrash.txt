hey guys welcome to this video where I'm going to show you how to find the detailed error message when your app crashes and that's gonna help you figure out what's going wrong with your project because a lot of the time when it crashes you get this green line highlighting something in your code saying cig abort or you know some other cryptic error message and it just doesn't mean very much so let me create a crash right now and I will show you guys how to figure that out alright so I've got an existing project here and I'm just going to comment out a line of code which I know will cause the app to crash and I'm gonna run it by pressing command R and this is going to build my project it's gonna launch the iOS simulator and then it's gonna run my project on that simulator so there it goes and fully expecting this to crash all right so there it goes and it's going into my app delegate which is the entry point for my app and I have this error message on the right here which says cig abort and that's not very meaningful and sometimes it can't highlight exactly the line that's going wrong it just knows that something is wrong and it's crashed but where do you want to pay attention to is down here in the debug area if you watched my Xcode user interface walkthrough you'll know that this area is for troubleshooting your code if you don't see this area under your code editor go to the upper right hand corner and make sure you have this button toggled on this button hides or shows that the bug area and if you still want to see it take note that in the debug area you have these two buttons here which you can hide and show the left the right side of the debug area so make sure that the right hand side is visible so you see all of this text so what you want to do when it crashes is right here at the very bottom this is not the well this is an error message but it's just telling you that it crashed so what you want to do is you want to scroll all the way up usually what happens is you're going to find the source of the crash so it tells you that the view hierarchy is not prepared for the constraint and it basically gives you a little more detailed information about your crash now the crash that you have may not have this exact message because depending on why it's crashing you're gonna get some different message here but it's a lot more helpful to read this message here because it's usually more detailed and it usually tells you the source of the problem so here for this particular instance it's telling me exactly what is wrong it's telling me that in here I'm trying to add all of these auto layout constraints but I haven't added the object to the view and if you've worked with auto layout constraints before you'll know that you have to add that element to the view before you can add Auto layout constraints on it and basically that just means you have to add that element to the view before you can add the rules to position that element on your view when I commented this line out I was trying to position that element with these rules before I've even added the element to the view so that's what this hints at see the view hierarchy is not prepared for the constraint if you had another type of error like cannot find selector or something like that that implies it's trying to call a method on an element but it can't find that a selector is just another word for element and I think I'm going to do some future videos just to go through the different types of error messages you might encounter I think that would be very helpful for you guys but I just wanted to do this video to show you guys how to get the detailed message for your error so when you run into a crash and you're trying to ask for help whether you're posting on forums or you're asking me this detailed error message right here is the one that you want to quote so there you go so thanks for watching and I hope that was helpful to you guys I'll see you in the next video
