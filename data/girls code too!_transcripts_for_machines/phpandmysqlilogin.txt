hi everyone this is stephanie and welcome to another tutorial with me and today's tutorial we will be learning how to login on user using PHP and MySQL I so let's begin the first thing is first I have already have everything set up for you I have the forum and HTML and the action is going to be this page which the forum is going to be submitted and the method is equal to post and the only thing we axe for is the email and we have the submit button so let me just go ahead and show you how this page looks and this is the page so we have this little inputs we have an Ashford and we have a button so Capisce got that part now so let's start the first thing we want to do is we're going to start our session and I'm just going to write a little comment here saying that we're about to do the login but next time we want to do is we want to require our connection page and if you have been watching my tutorials I have a new connect dot PHP page and this is our connection page now so I need to require that and that is me and connect dot PHP now we can go ahead and begin so the first thing I want to do is we want to make an if statement and we want to say if is that and we asked ourselves what is set if the submit button which is called log in if it's submitted what do we want to do so just go ahead and put logging and now so if the form is submitted what do we want to do the first thing we want to do is we want to select from our table so select everything from me the table where the email is equal to dot dot post email so whatever the user inputs want to select that email from the table now the next thing we want to do is we want to make another variable and I'm going to call this SQL q equal to MySQL I query and it's one to take the connect variable which is from the new connect dot PHP and it's going to take SQL Man 1 now we must go ahead and make another if statement and in this statement we want this to check if everything is true we want to check if the input email is not empty so not empty post email and my SQL I fetch Assoc SQL cue is greater than zero meaning that there is an email associated with that or in other words there is an email on the file that they post it and we also want to check that if they inputs an email that is a valid email so we write something like not filter bar and we write post email comma filter validate email not filter far the email those are valid a email and it's not equal to false so it's a valid email address so if all of this is true what do we want to do the first thing what to do is once I go ahead and make a session terrible and in order to do that session and you will name the session variable and I'm going to call it email I'll equal to post email and that is all we need and the next thing we want to do is we're going to write header and this is going to redirect us to another page so I'm going to make a new file they are on column you page dot PHP and after that something location and now for disco so now this part is finished so we checked we are checking if the input is my empty if the email that they do in place exists and that is not an invalid email address and if it's true they're going to start a session variable and it's going to redirect this to a new page dot PHP now the next thing what to do is we won't take an if statement and we're going to say if for some reason the input is empty what do we want to do then well we want to go ahead and make a vample a equal to the message that we want to display on the screen so I'm going to say please enter your email and I spell email Bron embarrassing and we want to say if that's not the problem else if let's say that the email does not exist so am i fetch and yes that's on Steam and it's so cute and this is not equal to one what it wants to do that same variable a is now going to equal to email does not think this and if that's not the problem the email might be a invalid email address and what do we want to do so I'm just going to copy this right here and I'm going to paste it over here and instead of false we're going to put true so if it's an invalid email then we will put a equal to and valid you know and now we are done with this heart so we are checking in this part if the input is empty throw the error message if it's an existing if it's not an existing email address then throw this error message and if it's not a valid email address then throw in this message now the only thing we want to do is number one we want to go in between our spam class after the attachment and we're going to add our PHP syntax and we're going to say echo live variable a so if you do in calcium in a message it will echo the message whatever your message it chooses and then now we can go ahead and state this page and now we also go back to our new connect dot PHP and we have to basically tell this page that we're going to have a variable named a and it's going to hold our error message so we have a venerable a equal to nothing so let's go ahead and save that now let's just go make our new file and this file is going to be save as new page dot PHP and all the change is going to do is equal the email address that they have login so we're going to do our PHP syntax and all we're going to do is start the session first required connect page Sonia connect dot PHP and now we're just going to go ahead and echo I'm going to echo something like hi space dot the session bird will mean that we had created and we called it email on bio and that is all we have to do for now we're completely done so that's going to happen to save this and now we can go to our nil me dot PHP page and now I'm just going to refresh this page and now we can begin to log in so the first thing that I'm going to show you is I am NOT going to into anything and I'm just going to submit the button so let's go ahead and do that and we get a message please into your email now let me enter something but it's not a valid email so I'm just going to put something like that and login so it says you have those not exist and that is not the message it's supposed to say so what do we do wrong okay guys here's a problem um this is kind of weird but we have to rearrange this so let me just go ahead and do that mmhmm this over here so now let's just go ahead and save it and now says and badly email so that that was not an invalid email we inputted now I'm just going to input a email address a real one so login and it says email does not exist and let me try the email that I do have on file which is this one right here so now I will log in and if that's hi my email address how cool is that and we can also go to our PHP myadmin um now we can go ahead and go to our database which is v1 and well to the me table and as you can see the email that we do have is this one and that is the one that must be this way hi might not address so how cool is that guys and that is how you log in your user so hope that wasn't a lot and I hope that wasn't hard so guys thank you so much for watching this tutorial and I look forward to seeing you on the next tutorial and um this time we will be learning out so register our user so thank you guys
