hi everyone my name is Stephanie and today I would like to show you how to connect the database create table and insert into table using PHP and MySQL on so let's begin first we are going to do Larson text as always but since I'm lacking word and then we will have our variable three barrels one pair of oil is going to hold our host name my host name happens to be localhost and then for the username my username is root and pour the password my password is empty then we will have another variable which holds which basically connects everything it connects for your whole scheme username and password this ways people of my school I connect connect the house they usually and the password and then we will say if not Anna let's go to die and have an end message unable to kind of dot I connect air else HECO nectar so you basically said if it's not connected meaning something went wrong probably the hostname is wrong or they use the name is wrong or the password is wrong or something is wrong then it will tell us an LMS and goal and the error message will basically be unable to connect if everything else is fine everything ok then it's going to and out this message we are connected so let's stay back and let's go to our local host site my fire name is Lee today that's already there and we are connected so that is how you connect now I'm going to learn how to create database so let's just erase this part right here we don't need it anymore since we already here and you're connected now let's create database and apparel and inside the inside in between the double fault it's about my a database and you can even database anything from the life I am going to name mine bull and we do another Vanhorn so I ask you I hear e available to make that we made right here and that's you out this variable right here and then we're I'm going to stay in database creating house I say database connecter didn't get here from in parentheses this point the very opening and now we save that and we look back here and database has been created and so double check to see if the database is created for real then just go to pH from my admin you downloading and as you can see baseball has been created I'm star born and they created one have been created now let's add a table inside this database so to create a table your first are going to have the Android database and add inside here and yes we get people's who ate painful and you can even take with anything as well I'm missing me my table members and if she was going to have a ID and it's this is going to keep one side auto and it's just gonna have it you know and I'm gonna have something all right date/time stop this basically tells let to know when you signed up and at what time you sign up yeah is this here table reading else if there's an one sample that is wait to die no don't you know I connect here and you save that and let's refresh this sample for you and to doublecheck to see it and say well they've created click on the database and you should find your table members and you will see that we have an ID email on the right thing ok so now the last thing we should learn is how to insert and to that's at the table and it's hurting the information in the table so it's the same thing as creating in the table but we're not forgetting in the table we are inserting information into the table so I'm just going to use the same variable I use that last time and turns into the table name which is members well it has email values and they even need to use is Borini I'm just going to use like a thing Mina Stephanie yeah and have another phone my sqli corny information has else nothing start it dodged my SQL I connect their connect and that should be all and now we should go back to our site and refresh information has been inserted into table and now you can go through our database go to our table and as you can see our information has been inserted and the email Stephanie a yahoo.com have been inserted on August 8 2016 16 all 756 seconds so that's it that is how you connect create database create table and insert into table using PHP and MySQL thank you so much for watching this video with me and I was so happy to teach you guys thank you so much and have any questions feel free to email me anytime you later thank you
