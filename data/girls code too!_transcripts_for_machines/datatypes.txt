hello everyone and welcome back to another tutorial with me and in today's tutorial we will be learning about data types in PHP as you can see here I have listed the different data types that variables can store the first one you should be familiar with as we have learned it on the last tutorial what we were learning about parables and we such dreams where a sequence of characters or text text in between double or single calls and then we learn about values values are basically numbers so you see integer which is a non decimal number by 5880 four or you can have a float number which is a number with a decimal like five point 89 and then we have something called will leave only represents two possible States either it's true or it's false and then we have something called object which stores data and information we will not want over objects in this tutorial but on the next torial we will go over objects because objects have to be declared and the last data type is called in la an array stores multiple values in one single bearable now let's go over here and lets just make an example of each data type let's say we had a ver phone ha um gee and it's equal to a stream that says hi my name is Sally and this right here is the street and that's that we have another variable r which is equal to a value a number let's just have an integer negative 4 then we can also have another variable that holds a floating number now are the e equal to 70 7.9 and then let's have another variable and this bearable is going to hold on abilene which means true or false less time we want to prepare two numbers we want to see if this number is ready than that number let's say 32 is greater than 45 which is Matt truth is going to raise my boss and that's just still an array with an array you have a verra phone and they're holding t equal it to array and you can hear either have a string inside the array or any type of data type inside the bracket now let's say I want to have a string with a and then I have another string B and then I have another screen see now let's go ahead and label these and this right here is a floats voting member and this right here is an integer and this right here is oops get this after all I'm going to stay lean beer bowling this one is total number and this right here is an integer now instead of echoing all these variables they're going to use something called bar done and this basic be returns the data type and the value of the variable so we have multiple variables so we're going to start right there one common second variable I'm but then go on point one and fickle and let's change this to it a and we will save this and only test it out we will see that it returns the data type and the value of Matt um bearable so let's go ahead and head over to our lil Phobos /t UT PHP into it and as you can see it tells us that this right here is a string and it has 16 letters basically this right here is an integer negative form this right here is a floating govern seventy seven point nine this right here it's a believe such as equals four false and this right here is in an array which has the streams a B and C so that is what that those aren't the different data types in PA tree that's just one more example you could just use one their phone and this variable can be u u equals 2 s try believe I must say 1.9 is equal to 29 bar huh and our terrible name which is you do and we stayed this hop over that to our logos very French and it says bullying us the ool box because it's not true 129 is not equal to 20 min so that right there is two different data types that variables can store so that is it for this tutorial thank you guys for watching and I will see you on the next torial
