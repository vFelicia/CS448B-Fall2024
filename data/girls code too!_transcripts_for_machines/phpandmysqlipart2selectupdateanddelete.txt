hi everyone and welcome back to another tutorial with me today I will be teaching you how to select update and delete are the last tutorial we know how to connect create database create table and enter into the table so let's begin remember this is what PHP and MySQL I and we are going to say select email from members the TaylorMade remember is going to select all the emails if you wanted to select a specific email right over here as we can see they have the ID number one you can say select a specific ID but that is not needed right now because we only have one email so we're gonna do an experiment as calc you will just leave it to MySQL I query connect SQL and then there have our if statement our if statement is going to be a bit different MySQL I number of rows and we put all right that's cute it's right here and then we're going to do a while statement inside the if and we don't want to stay a while row terrible way to me bearable row as MySQL i underscore fetch Assoc yes q oq and this meant to ever email on file space that dot bro the varible okay he's not it breathlessly Butthead um double quotes have you seen the Deauville correspond to the email and they go check that out they go to our local host we could lighten up HP and as you can see the email that's on file is Stephanie you know yahoo.com and you go back here it is definitely a young calm and that is how you select now let's learn how to update say we want to change Stephanie yahoo.com so Sally yeah hold on how do we do that I'm going to show you right now and it's pretty easy all you have to do is say update members set email people to Sally at yahoo.com SQL you if equal to my SQL I query connect and ask you up then we would see if SQL q there is my echo updated else it's going to die problem is not that fuckin'a air connect and you save that and you refresh our page and it says updated then the email has been changed so it's no longer Stephanie hey ho calm so you click on our table loading loading loading and as you can see it is now Sally at yahoo.com did you see how we do that and that is how you will update now let's sell me you don't no longer want that email no more we went to the meet we want to delete this whole thing right here we want to delete this whole information right here Sally I yahoo.com the ID and the right thing we want to delete all of that so I will show you how to get rid of them it's just it's similar to updating and you think the neat members the delete email for members you can say where the ideas equal to one but you can do it without that so I'm just a little with this good ideas a little 1s hello here is equal to MySQL I weary connect and sq out if sq of you echo you're just going to put the new house just one and I trip and leave doc my SQL I connect error and a parentheses connect and you have trouble Dunedin so that's seen what happened to be to be no wrong members where I do everything okay looks delete thankfully lenders pinky no let's store without the idea it's travel to leave and that's oh I know what the link okay let's try to delete from members where our ID and and it's the needed so that was that problem so now if we arm

on the last tutorial we learn how to connect create database create table and insert information into the table using PHP and MySQL I now today we are going to learn how to set back update and delete with PHP and MySQL I so let's begin may I first want to start with our variable what just wanted to say for that email members remember on the last tutorial we we made a table five members SQL Q is equal to minus Q library and that as you know our if statement is going to be a bit different MySQL I numrows SQL oh okay and this has to be greater than zero and we will say wow we'll have a while step inside well this they're putting row between the Maya school I went to fetch file came out on file dot grow you know and that's why Sophia Tiffany Silas the email that is on file I will save that and look our local host site we connect dot PHP and the email on file is Stephanie and yahoo.com and when close to our cohost and it's Stephanie I at yahoo.com and that is how you stand I now say if we wanted to change our email Stephanie oh yeah hold up home to Sally at yahoo.com and to do that it's pretty easy you'll see update members set email equal to Sally yeah and have our second pair of Oh which shows up for me mysql i play my neck and ask you uh if SQL you echo dated else died not update dot mysql I connect air cut it and we save that and when you fresh okay just update it so it's a no longer Stephanie a yahoo.com we click on our table and it is now Sally at yahoo.com and that is how you update now say if we do not want that information how long we want to delete it let it be God and similar to updating but different so we say delete from members where ID is equal to three and as you can see our ID is equal to 3 so we say I be equal to 3 let's put that in in their capital M and s uo q is equal to Al is Qi where are you come back and SQL yeah yes hello q go deleted else twice and died that's all this one to see my SQL I connect ask you know hey and we will you fresh this
