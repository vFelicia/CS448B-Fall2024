hi everyone this is stephanie and welcome back to another tutorial with me in today's tutorial we will be going over form validation and BHP in order for us to begin form validation we must use something called PHP filters and PHP filters are used to validate or sanitize your data now there are two things there's validating data and they're sanitized and data these are two different things the validating data determines if the data is in proper form while the sanitizing data removes any illegal character from the data so i am going to show you an example of validating and sanitizing your data so let's begin guys first thing is first i made a little form and all the required for you to have an email and that is it so this is how it looks just like that simple as that in um email input and a submit button along with the ashford so now let's go over here and begin so i have started the session and i have made a bearable see that is going to hold on my error message if i have one so the first thing is first i'm going to show you what the validate the validating that I looks like but I want to make an if statement and say if the form have been submitted so if the one has been submitted what I wanted to do if we're going to make another if statement and I just want to make sure that it's not empty the input itself is not in and i also want to validate the email to make sure that it's a valid email so I'm a right not filter bar and the function will take pose email the email input get then it will take filter validate email this and if this is not equal to false okay so now if everything is true is the Pope if the input is not empty and if um whatever they cite is a valid email that what do we want to do you want to go ahead and start and make a session variable and i'm going to call this um in input equal to pose email if then we're just going to go ahead and echo your email is dot and a session variable name which is input and that is all for that far now if they aren't if there are any errors let's say if if the input is empty then what do we want to do suppose email that bear foe that we made see is going to say email is a choir else if if that's not the problem let's say that the email is not a valid email so not filter bar house email omer filter validate email got it for me and if this is not equal to true meaning it's not a valid email then what do we want to do that same bar will see is going to equal to invalid email and that is all and let's just put a lid too ! and we on this who go so we check if the input is not empty and if it's a valid email address so let's go ahead and save this and now i'm going to refresh this page and we have an error on line 35 oh my business how can a vline 35 if of there i see why ok so now it looks like it works so i'm going to submit the form without putting any email and we get email is reported now i'm going to insert a invalid email and I'm ways to submit and it says invalid email now i'll enter a valid email and this time it says your email is whatever i enter and that is how you validate the email you can also validate in Earl let's say I want it on the user to enter a valid girl so I'm not going to change the name of this i'm just going to change placeholder name to URL okay and this time instead of say validate email we're going to say validate URL and same thing goes for here you are URL and valid URL and let's just say the URL is required so in this case you must insert a valid or so let's go ahead to save this and now let's go ahead and refresh and now we ask for invalid Earl now if I insert something like this then it will tell me that if the invalid Earl now I have to enter a valid girl so I'm just going to enter something like um facebook copy and paste it here so submit submit and it says where you know is WWE facebook com well i'm going to say you're all is www.facebook.com and that is how you validate me the arm put input data now let's go ahead and erase all of this and this time we will sanitize a data and i'm going to change this fact to email and now Alice Alice hides data is different all it does it removes any emil character so i'm going to make an if statement again well I probably should raced everything but hello to me post email and we're going to make a pamphlet a equal to filter barn hose hmmm omer filter validate not badly but sanitize email okay and now we're just going to go ahead and echo that variable a and that is all we have to do for it to sanitize now let's save this and let me show you what happens from now just going to go refresh this page and now i'm going to go ahead and attempt to write a invalid email so i'm just going to write something like 20 g or flash more / um what else should I add semicolon semicolon yahoo.com so I'm just going to copy this and because i want to show you exactly what happens so now i'm going to submit this form and watch what happens submit and as you can see now the email is GG aol.com notice that it took away before a slash the two semicolons remember we have something like this and it removes all of this right here and it corrected the email for us so that is what the sanitized not interest remove the illegal characters that are not supposed to be a part of the email em that is it for this tutorial vised so i hope to see how everything baba validating works and how the sanitizing worms so thank you guys for watching and i will see you guys on the next tutorial bye
