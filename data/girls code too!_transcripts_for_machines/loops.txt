hi everyone this is stephanie and welcome back to another tutorial with me in today's tutorial we will be learning about loops than PHP loops and PHP there's only three different moves in PHP we have the Wallow rather wallow and the for loop so the 10 basically execute the code while the condition is true and this repeats the cold over and over while the condition is true so let's go ahead and show you an example of what I mean so the wall goal basically starts with Wow parentheses honey buckets and enter oh and turn right here and then your conditions will go inside here so let's say my condition is 44 is equal to 24 and then while that's true echo I love peanut butter and every space peanut butter and save that and if we go to our local host /c you see dot PHP and look what happened so the condition was true so it printed out I love peanut butter a millions of times you can try to scroll you can't really scroll yet because it's still looking for ever and ever and that is what the one who does so let's go to our next loop so we have the dual waddle which executes the code once check the condition and then repeat the loop while the condition is true so let's go ahead and show you an example of that one and with that one you have do then you have credit like Express in turn a phone this is awesome awesome and then you will have a log right here then the condition will be 50 is equal to 50 save then let's refresh and look what happens so the condition was true and it echoed this is awesome so that is what the dowhile loop does now the last one is called the for loop and the for loop executes a block of code a specified number of times so let's go ahead and show you an example of a for loop so for then you click enter now one thing I should tell you about the for loop now inside parentheses it takes three parameters the first parameter is in it counter which initializes the loop counter value so I'm going to have a fan for e their goal e equals 20 how's that and then the second parameter it takes is called test encounter and this one evaluates the loop iteration if it baggage true the loop will continue if not the loop will end so that same bearable e is going to be messy mmm that's like valen bin or equal to 20 close that and then the last one is called increment counter so this one just adds Amina as the increases the loop so there will be plus plus and close that now we are just going to echo the variable which is e and pull that off save it and watch what happens and unexpected I'm 92 bus I guess we don't need this and yeah so that was the problem so I guess we don't need that and now the number is laid out from zero to number 20 so that's what the for this does based on my decision I said loop through all the way through 20 I kind of sim and through all the way little 500 and it will and it will do that so that's what the for loop does now that is all for that tutorial so we learn about the different loops the wild moon that do well enough for zoo these are very helpful you are going to use them when you are coding and I hope you have learned so much and I hope to teach you some more about PHP so thank you guys for watching and I will see you guys on the next that's for you
