hey guys this is Stephanie and welcome back to another tutorial with me in today's tutorial we will be learning how to select update and delete from our table so let's begin so in order to select from our tempo the first thing we'll do is I'm going to make a bear phone I'm listening this SQL and we're going to select email run the table me so I said select the email from disable me now we're going to say SQL cue another variable and I'm going to say my SQL I query connect and SQL now I am going to make another variable and I'm going to call this bearable row equal to MySQL I num rows so it's going to get the number of rows in the table so in parentheses SQL queue burnable goes in there now we will make an if statement and we will say if row what do we want to do well we're going to make a while loop and we're going to say well I want to make a variable call the gene equal to MySQL I fetch Assoc and in the parenthesis we're going to put the bearable SQL cue now while this is true we want to go ahead and echo email on file dot Eugene and you know since we want to get the email information so that's why I had to save that and now I'm just going to refresh and it says email on file Sammy afv.com and if we go to our local host PHP myadmin we will see that the email that's on file to Sammy al hakam and that is the email that is being displayed how easy was that so let's go back over here and let me explain to you what I did so I select the email from the table me and then I got the query I connected to the query and then I main arm of the arm bone that has that hold the number of rows from the table and then we said if row while this is true while the variable G is equal to MySQL I fetch Assoc equal the email that's on file simple as that so that's it for the Select now let's go ahead and learn about updates so let's say that we want to change our email address to sally yahoo.com instead of sammy at yahoo.com how would we do that well that's easy all you have to do is make a bearable and I'm going to need this SQL I'm just trying to stay consistent and I will do update update once update the table me where the email well actually not ready you know bar update the table me and set the email equal to Sally at yahoo.com and now we would do another bedroom is still q equal to MySQL I Larry and we'll have a connect bearable and we will have SQL vo now we will say if SQL Q if the table has been updated what do we want to say once and say echo updated else if it's not updated the bear well the function died and just want to say not updated not my SQL I connect error and the connect miracle so save that and now we can go ahead and refresh and it says updated so let's we'll see if it has been updated now for now we have Sammy and Yahoo calm but if we go ahead and refresh this page we will now get Sally at yahoo.com so hope you guys see how that happened and that was so cool that was really really cool so that is how update the information in the table now the last thing we want to learn about is how to delete from the table and we can just go ahead and erase this and this time we're just going to type in to meet an order to delete it's the same thing as an update but different so I'm just going to put delete we wanted to delete from let me everything from from where the table mean winner the ID in this case this is the only information we have and in this case the idea is equal to one so lets going to delete where the ID is equal to one right so now there's just four semicolon and apparently we do not need that so I'm just erase that and now let's just make a second variable SQL Q equal to MySQL I queried Connect bearable and SQL so if that's your cue so if the information has been deleted from the table what do we want to do he wants to go ahead and echo they need it else nice they need it not MySQL I connect error okay I don't know what just happened there connect error and the connect bearable okay so now let's just go ahead and save this and now you can go ahead and refresh this page right here sorry fresh and hopefully no errors think that so it's not deleted now let's go check out to see if it's ready to need it so let's just click the arm table one more time mmm any what so the information has been permanently permanently deleted from the table how cool was that guys how cool was that so the table so the information in the table has been and needed and that is how you delete information from the table so in this tutorial we learn how to select from the table insert into well not insert but select on the table update from the table and the meats from the table so thank you guys for watching that was such a good video and I will see you guys on the next tutorial bye
