hello everyone and welcome to another tutorial with me and in today's tutorial we are going to be learning about variables in PHP a variable is basically a container for storing information in different languages variables are written differently so let's go ahead and see an example of a variable and to write a variable PHP you must start with a dollar sign the name of the variable and equal to a value or of screen and the value of the number and a string is a sequence of characters it's like a text stink of it out of texts now my variables you must start with a letter you cannot start with the number you cannot have nine is a number you can't have that you will encounter in air wrists and also I variables are case sensitive like say if I have a variable a and i have another variable a but isn't cat this is not a valid a valid variable now necessary we want this to equal the variable to NH string and the variable is going to hold a string that says hello world and we're also going to have a variable that holds a number so this is a stream and this is a value so now on the last tutorial we learn how to output data on the screen by using echo hello world now when we're using variables we can also equal what the variable is holding by staples holding extreme my name is Sam and we want to print it out my name is Sam on the screen instead of snake echo my name is Sam just say echo the variable here which shows the stream my name is sin and we save this and we will test this out localhost forward slash touch PHP enter and it says my name is Sam so the variable here holds the string my name is Sam and we just said fo the variable here which holds that string now this is some other examples let's add more strings more than one string here is equal to the number eight um hi is equal to the stream party and we'll have one more bearable and this rail will be called JJ equals to the value nine and that's say we wanted to find all of these out on the screen together how would we that so the only thing we need to do is to say fo the vulnerable here common the variable hi comma and the variable JJ and remember that you don't have to do it in this order they do it in any order you want to it doesn't matter and you will just save this and if we refresh our page you will see that 8 pi 9 is displayed on the screen now that is how you do a variable in PHP and it's just one more example oh let's have hairy equals to Potter fo let's just use print print Harry and we save that and refresh and Potter is this flame and that is how you do variables in PHP start with a dollar sign name the variable and equal it to either a value or the street and remember do not start it with the number if you do let's refresh this and as you can see the error message is parse error syntax error unexpected 9 expecting variable or dollar sign and see example htdocs studies p on line two so you do not encountered this error so and that is it for today and this is how you know variables in PHP so on the next tutorial I will be teaching you about different data types in PHP thank you guys for watching and I will be looking forward to making more videos for you about PHP thank you and goodbye
