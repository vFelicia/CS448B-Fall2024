hi everyone this is stephanie and welcome back to another tutorial with me in today's tutorial is going to be very quick hopefully we're going to be learning how to log out our user after they have logged in so let's get started the only thing we have to do is we are going to go to our welcome page which is called new page PHP and over here underneath the echo hi session name we're going to go ahead and echo and we're going to make a mink MP long line PHP but in HTML and this how you make mix in HTML and this link is going to go to um if hey that I made already called new log outs hot PHP and we want to go ahead and change this to single quotes since we are ready using on double cold and now i'm just going to write something like logout and i also want to break this because you know just let some space yeah one space okay and that's it so that is it for that page just go ahead fo make a link in HTML and this link is going to go to New locked out dot PHP okay so go ahead and save that and now we will go to that page that file that we mate new now got PHP and we're just going to make a PHP tag and the first thing is first we're going to start the session and then we're going to destroy the session and then we're going to unset discussion so session start session destroying and session I'm set so you must start the session before you destroy it and before you learn to set it okay and now we're just going to make a header tag well not a header tag but a header function and after the session has destroyed and upset and stuff like that we want it to go ahead and redirect us to aur main page which is new me dot PHP and that is what you want ok so now we are finish and now let's go ahead and test the style so I'm going to go ahead and login and as you can see i am not in now let's say I no longer know to be honest page I'm going to leave the page so I'm going to go ahead and log out so click the link log out and it brings me back to New me dot PHP now i'm going to said we're finish but we are not quite done yet now if we go ahead and let's say we want it to go back to that new page doc needs me right and as you can see it gives us a notice saying undefined index name so it's basically saying that there's no username you did not enter username and you just came back on this page and it still says hi and then you have a log out page I'm either like that we now you do not what this to happen if the user is not logged in then they should not go to go to this page so in order to prevent that we will do something like this so go back to new page dot PHP and underneath here I'm just going to make an if statement and I'm going to say if not session name now what do I want to do header location new me PHP so what am I saying if the user is not logged in then they need to be right redirected to the main page so all I said if not session name then have them back to New me dot PHP now we are done so go ahead and save it and now all I'm going to do is refresh this page and watch what it does it sends me back to New me dot PHP so let me do this one more time new page that PHP and there you go so I am unable to access that page unless i am logged in M that is all we need to know for the logo so thank you guys for watching hope you guys um learn how to log out and I believe that this is the last tutorial for PHP and MySQL I I will be moving on some HTML I probably should have started teaching HTML first before I started HP but it doesn't matter so um I hope you guys learned a lot from me and if you have any questions or comments or concerns please comment below and if you like if you like my videos and stuff like that just let me know like it comment below and also subscribe so thank you guys for watching and I will see you guys on the next tutorial bye
