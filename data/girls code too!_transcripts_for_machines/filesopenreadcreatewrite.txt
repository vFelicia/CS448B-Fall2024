hi everyone is Stephanie and welcome to another tutorial with me it's a day so real we are going to be learning how to open create and write two files so let's begin so let's say I have a file in this case I have a text file you can have a PHP HTML CSS whatever file you have so i have a my 9 dot txt file and so what i want to do is open that file and read it so to do that I will have a variable R equal to the function f open and this function basically opens the file so it takes two parameters and for the first parameter is going to see your file name the second parameter is going to take the mold that you want your files to be opening and I'm wear shoes are and if you don't know when the moves are these are the different the different modes that you can open your file in so you can over your file for readonly if you just want to read your file you go over your file for right only if you're going to write your file create a new file or whatever you are you're going to use so these are the different modes now what I'm going to do is just echo free1 shin afraid basically reads my file it's going to take two parameters so the first parameter is going to take the function are not function but the variable are sorry and then it's going to take file size and my file name and basically it it finds how many bytes the file has and then the last thing I'm going to do is close your file after you have opened it because it's good practice that you do close your file you don't want to sit there and have it open so it's going to take the are variable and so we're going to save that and let's head over to local homes type dot PHP and as you can see it opened a file and it allowed me to read the file read what's in that file so that is how you open the file you open and read the file now let's say I want to go ahead and create a file to do this I will have my bamboo just i have t equals to F open and this is the same function that creates a file and this one's to take two parameters i'm going to call this file um I Rock dot PHP and we're going to use W create that file and then we're going to have an if statement as I want to test this out so I'm going to say if F right and i forgot my teeth f right and this is just going to take some parameters Oh so it's going to take the variableg file size and the file name which is I rock dot PHP so if that's true if the file has been created echo file created else echo file not created save that and let's go ahead and refresh this and it says file creative is to find out if your file is really created just go to file open and just search for the file I just created which was I rock dot PHP and the file has been created now you see that as zero because we have nothing on the screen now here comes the writing to that file so let's say I went to write to that file so I'm just going to make another variable and I'm going to name this T equal to the text i want it i want to be there what cookies i want cookies and then another thing we're going to do is just erase the file size and we're just going to add any variable T and mmm sentence added sessoms added then i'm going to put for this one sentence not added and let's go ahead and refresh and its asset is added now if we go here and we get this this message this file has been modified by another program do you want to reload it and click yes and as you can see we wrote to that file so that is how you write to the file so first thing is you open the file then you write the text that you want and then we did an if statement if the film we have written to the file if this is true uncle sentence that is added and then else acquisitions not added so that is it for this tutorial thank you guys for watching and I will see you guys on the next tutorial
