hi everyone it's Stephanie and welcome to another tutorial with me and in today's tutorial we will be learning about conditional statements so conditional statements they are you to perform different actions based on different conditions so I have written down the following conditional statements that are used in PHP so the first one we have is called hip statement and this statement executes code if the condition is true and let me show you an example of that one so we have the world if we have our parentheses and then we have our curly brackets then press ENTER and then our condition rolls these who need of a parenthesis so I'm just going to have a condition like 20 is equal to 40 m so this condition is supposed to be true and if it is true icon true that true and that now save that and let's go ahead and head over to our set that PHP I'm already there so I'm just going to refresh and it says true and that because that is true for t is equal to 40 so the next conditional statement and ifelse statement and this one basically execute the code if the condition is true but if it's not it will execute another code let me show you what I mean and okay let me change is so fitting and we're right else you have our Clowney package and then by the other condition I made the other yeah that's the close of yep um actually what it is and now that is totally wrong and asked about talking me wrong totally wrong and you see no that is totally wrong because the condition is not true and if the condition is not true it goes to the second cold and currents that out instead now the third conditional statement is if else if and else statement this one execute different clothes for more than one statement now let me head over and tell you one time out so let me just erase this i'm going to start over so i have it if and for the first condition i have um 30 is equal to mmm 3 fo just yes and then i have else if another condition are 30 is equal to 80 ever hmm yeah you're right I say yeah you're tight yeah you right and then else if neither the condition is true then it will echo arm no and save that and let's go ahead and refresh and the answer is no because neither of the condition are true 30 is not equal to 3 and 30th x equal to 80 so is skip these two arm hold to be executed and equal to write to this one which is temple love and that is how the if else if ml statement and you can have as many all else estate as you want else if 30 is greater than 10 iphone yes ma'am save that and we get yes ma'am because one of the condition is true and that is this one the study is greater than sin so that's it for that one now let's learn about the switch statement this one selects one of many blocks of code to be executed now let me show you an example for that one so let's say I have a variable that holds my favorite color my favorite color is red well it's not asking me that but I'm just make it up so then I start the switch statement mr. switch parenthesis and honey buckets and then my condition we will hear so I'll just have my bearable and basically what happened is it's going to go through a block of holes so see which one matches the arm the color red that's in the variable favorite so you will start with case 0 at home your favorite favorite color is red and then there's something called break and then we went to another case run echo your favorite color color is food FN will break again and we will have another case case to equal your favorite color is yellow and then we will have something called default now default will only run if they cannot find a match for the color red that's in a variable favorite so it's going to go to all these cases and one of them is going to have to match um red so I just want to move this one but let's have a default discuss iphone i do not know your favorite color so if it cannot find the match where my favorite color red then it's just going to echo I do not know your favorite color so say this that thunderstorm and then refresh and your favorite color is red so if picked case 0 because k0 has the color red and it and that is how the switch statement basically goes so that's it for this tutorial I have taught you about the different conditional statements in PHP so I will see you guys on the next tutorial and it is going to be exciting thank you guys for watching and I'll see you on the next tutorial
