hello everyone this is stephanie and welcome back to another tutorial with me in today's tutorial we will be learning how to register our users on the last tutorial I showed you how to logon are using now this time let's learn how to register our user so um everything looks quite the same I just change the name to register a value to register and what else tightly and that's about it so let's go ahead and begin right side of my car the first thing I'm going to do is require our we find our connection page view and then dot PHP now let's begin our if statement if is that again what is set if our form is submitted so if they can make the register button what do we want to happen but first we want to go ahead and select from our table so so let everything from the table mean where the email is equal to the email that they input now let's go make our slq member mysql i query and arthur night now go and ask you out there now we will go ahead and make our and we'll make another if thing and we will say if not empty so remember all of this is supposed to be true so if not give the hose email and mysql I fetch assoc ask you if it's less than 1 so this has to be less than 1 whatever the email that they register with must not be existed and the last one is to check for valid email Elton bar post email common filter validate email and this should not eat little false ok now we have that part so if that is true what do we want to do the first thing we wants to do is make a ver room and i'm going to call it I q equal to we want to insert into the table me set the email equal to the email that they are trying to register with house hmmm and now we will do our theory I to you is iOS 4i now fetch the query and connect them more and IQ come that is what we learn and then we're just going to do something like I hope you are now register simple as that so if everything is on equal to true over here we're going to go ahead and insert the email that me posted to the table and we're going to get the query and we're going to equal you are not registered so that's it for that part now someone to make an if statement and want to say if it is empty um the email input what I want to do we want to make a variable r equal to provide email if that's not a problem else if mysql I what actually no we'll just do you know what I'll just copy this right here coffee and pace and change this to true so if it's not even true mmm 11 go the r is equal to not a valid human and if you put that a right there and if that's not the problem let's say that the email already exists so MySQL I fetch assoc and we're going to have the barrel as he look you if it's greater than zero then we're going to say email already like this in that it will not now the last thing on this page who wants to do is the same thing we did for login is our PHP syntax and echo the variable are so if there is any error message then our message will pop up right next to the aschburgh and now we can go ahead and save this and that's also why new connect page and tell it that we will have a bamboo are that is going to hold our a message now they can go ahead and save this and let's go to our new me PHP page and i'm just going to refresh and now we can go ahead and try to register so for the first example i am not going to put anything and i'm just going to submit the form and if that's provide email now let me type in a in them email register not a valid email next let's try to let's try some on register with this evil remember we saw this email this is the one that is red sister now let's see what happened and it still goes in oops we did something wrong let's go back here okay here's the thing guys instead of doing greater than zero let's just do not equal to 1 so now I'm going to save this and because just refresh this page and now says email already exists so let's just make sure it did not register again I go to PHP my admin and let's go to the database big one let's just go to me and it did not thank God okay so now what we are going to do is try to register with an email that is not on file like this one right here and let's go ahead and register and it says you are now register so let's listen for registered crossing fingers and just refresh this page and look at that we are not registered I so I hope you see how did that now that is like so far so we finally registered to you sir now that's all we need to know so i hope you see what we did um similar to the login page but a bit different so that is all you need to know for the registration so thank you guys for watching thank you guys so soft so much and I'm looking forward to see you guys on the next couple of suit Orioles so please don't forget to subscribe follow me on facebook follow me on twitter and that's about it so thank you guys have a wonderful day bye
