hi everyone it's Stephanie and welcome back to another tutorial with me in today's tutorial we will be learning how to delete our file on the last tutorial we learn how to open create and write to our file now let's say we do not want that file anymore we don't want it so want to delete it so I'm going to delete the mind i dot exe file because i don't want it anymore so in order for me to do that i will have a variable F equal to my file name and then I'm going to make an if statement and it's going to say if unli and the unlink function basically delete the file and I'm going to put my venerable inside the parentheses and if that's true echo file has been deleted else echo file has not been deleted so let's go ahead and save that and head over to localhost tight PHP and and also this file has been deleted so if we go back over here you will get an alert box that says keep non existing file the file my my luck txt doesn't take this anymore so the you wants to keep this file in the editor and I'm going to say no and it delete that file and that is how you delete a file just use the unlink function and you are good to go so thank you guys for watching and I will see you guys on the next story
