hi everyone it's Stephanie and welcome to another tutorial with me in today's tutorial we are going to be learning about error handling in PHP now whenever you are making a web application you always want to make sure you have um something that handles your airor message so let's go ahead and begin I'm going to show you three different ways I handle my error messages so let's talk about the custom error handing so in order to do that you do a function name the function whatever you like I'm going to name mine to my error and it takes two parameters and over here I have written the different parameters that it does take so it takes error level which is required error message which is required and error file error line and error context so the only ones we are using is error level and error message so let's go and yeah so it's going to take a variable ER R level and it's also going to take err message then I went to Echo eror detected and this function basically is going to handle our air message so this one is going to say ER message and the other one is going to say ER level now we are going to set our error head hand set e r r Handler and in this case I'm just going to let it get two parameters the first one is going to say my function name which is my error and the second PRI is going to take the ER reporting level and over here there are different error reporting levels um I'm just going to use one of them which is e user warning so let's go ahead and do that so we're going to use e user warning then I'm going to make an a message well I'm going to test this out so I want to know if the file this so I want to know if p. PHP exists if it does Echo true else we will go ahead and Echo not Echo but we'll go ahead and Trigger error and we'll say no and comma e user warning so let's save that and let's go to Local Host t. PHP and we get error detected 512 no now we can also use different air reporting levels we can use let's use e user notice instead of e user warning save that refresh and we again error detected 10249 now so that's how the custom eror Handler works now let say I was if I exist else um no so in this case we can use the D function to handle our error and let's go ahead and refresh and we get no and then the other one what you saw earlier was called trigger error and this one goes like this refresh and you get notice no and see EXA hd. PHP online 5 so it's basically telling us that the file does not exist and that is the three different ways I handle my error message so thank you guys for watching and I will see you guys on the next tutorial
