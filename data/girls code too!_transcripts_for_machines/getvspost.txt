hi everyone it's Stephanie and welcome to another tutorial with me in today's tutorial we are going to be learning about two super globals in PHP we have the get and the post method now these two super globals are used to send information from a form now the difference between these two is that with the get method the information is visible to everyone but with the post method is not visible to anyone now let's go ahead and show you an example for this example I am going to make an HTML form please don't worry if you do not know about HTML forms I will be having tutorial for HTML now HTML body body and I'm just going to have my form tags form form for Action this is going to go to a page called us. PHP and the method is equal to yet now for this form I'm just going to have two inputs input size equals to text placeholder is equal to name name and the name of this input will be first then I'll have a second input type equals to text placeholder ID and for the name will be St then I will have a submit button type is equal to submit Val is equal to submit and the name of this button will be button now so we made our form now let's go and make our us. PHP page so let's save this and let's just go to file nail file again save as us. ehp now this is where the form is going to be submitted so let's have our PHP tag and we are going to say if is set not post but get and the form name I mean not form but the button name is button so basically if the form is submitted then I just want to Echo their name the name that they have so I'm going to say name space dot get name that dot we going to have break here another Dot and we're going to say ID space dot get and then we go check back to see okay so I had first and second as the name so I'll just put second here and I'll just put first here so let's go ahead and see an example of the get method so we already did our us. phv page and we did our form so let's go ahead and over and Local Host SL tphp so here's our form so we have to type in the name and I'm to type in my name and I'm just going to type in the ID like 12 and then I'm going go ahead and submit now when I have said that the get method your information is visible to everyone this is what I meant now if you look at the browser you'll see that your name is right there where my name is right there and my ID number number is right here so that is what the get method does the information is visible to everyone I wouldn't recommend for you to use the get method for your forms because you don't want to put sensitive information out there I would recommend you to use pulse now the pulse works like this so I'm just going to change this to post save that I'm going to go here and I'm going to do the same thing I'm going to change this into post change this into post and change this also so save that and refresh oops no not refresh but our local we got to go back t. PHP so now I'm going to put in my information Stephanie and the number is 12 so submit and there goes my name now the difference is that you don't see my information so it's not visible to anyone so that is the difference between the get and the post method so thank you guys for watching this tutorial and I will see you guys on the next tutorial
