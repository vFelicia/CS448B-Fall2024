hi everyone it's Stephanie and welcome to another tutorial with me in today's tutorial we will be learning how to upload files in PHP so let's begin the first thing we want to do is make sure that we can upload files in PHP so to check for that we'll go to your file open and you will go to the window seat and the exact folder and you will also look for PHP folder then you will search for a file named PHP i n i and mine is right here okay so what you want to search for is something that says file upload so I'm just going to click find next and exit this out and here it is so you want to make sure file uploads is equal to on if it's equal to off change that to on and you can go ahead and save that and just exit out so now we can begin what we need to do so the first thing you want to do is make a form in HTML so form action is equal to us. PHP method is equal to post and andc type is equal to multiart slash form data now the um ENC type basically tells us that this form is only to upload files so now let's do our first input type equal to file the name of this input will be upload me and then our last input will be input type equal to submit name equal to submit and the value is equal to I put something like upload and you are done with that so let's just save that and now let's go go over to our us. PHP page where the form is going to be checked so the first thing want to do is if is that so if the form is submitted we want to make a couple of variables so the first variable is f and f f is going to equal to the directory where the file is going to be placed in this case it's going to be place in a folder called images that I will be making later on and then let's have another variable where it specifies the path of a file to be uploaded so I'm just going to put where equal to where is equal to F do base name files this is going to be name and this is going to be upload me so it takes the input name and then it takes the name so and then we're going to have another variable image type and this is going to hold the file extensions so we're going to have path info going to have the variable where and then we're going to have PA info extension and then now the last variable we're going to have is get image and this one is going to get the image size that the user uploads so inside here we're going to have files tnp name stands for temporary and upload me now let's go ahead and make an if statement if get image is not equal to box so this is basically saying if the image is a real image and image type is equal to p n so we want to make sure that the file is a PNG file then we want to say not file exist variable where so the F the file do not exist that's what it basically mean so if all of that is true we want to go ahead and move uploaded file TMP name and upload me and then we're going to go ahead and head over to another page where it's going to stay where is going to say your imag is uploaded so I'm going to make a new page get me there PHP so we're going to make that also later on then let's make a little error message so if the get image is equal to false so if the User submitted a file and it's not an image then we're going to go ahead and Echo that is not an image else if let's say that the image side is not equal to PNG file I'm going to Echo that is not a supported file else if let's say the um let's say the image already exist so we're going to go ahead and write file exist where want to go ahead and Echo that image already exist so now we can go ahead and save that so let's go make our folder images let's go to file open and we're just going to click on new folder and I'm going to write images and for now our folder has nothing in it so go ahead and cancel that and we're also going to make our get me there. PHP page some new file save as get me there PHP so if everything is okay then we're just going to write Echo image has been uploaded so save that and now we are ready to test this out so first let's go over to local host. PHP and now we can go ahead and choose a file so let's say I do not choose a file I'm just going to go ahead and upload and we have an airor message on 97 okay okay okay so I forgot to put the end so let's go ahead and refresh this again and it should work this time and it says that is not an image so we have this warning message if you see this warning message just go back to your code and where it says get image size in front of it you just want to add the at sign and save that and when we refresh that should go away so it says that is not an image so now let's go back to to.php and this time let's go ahead and choose our file so I'm just going to choose a file I'm going to go to pictures and I'm just going to choose this picture right here and as you can see it's a JPEG file so when we upload it it says that is not a supported file so now we want to go back to our local hust t. PHP just one second cuz I know I forgot something oh yeah you have to do a comma and add where save that and now let's go back to our Local Host tphp and this time we are going to choose a PNG file so this happens to be a PNG file and it's a image so we're going to upload and it now says image has been uploaded so if we go over to images our images folder our photo has been uploaded and we can go ahead and add more PNG files if we want to and you also can have let's say you didn't want any PNG files you can go ahead and use JPEG files or drift files or any files type that you will only want so that is it for this tutorial thank you guys for watching and I will see you guys on the next tutorial and
