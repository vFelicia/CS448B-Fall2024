hi everyone this is stephanie and welcome back to another tutorial if you in to dance Astoria we will be going over protecting our data from PhD a karai so we monsoon is tech our database protect myself with SQL injections so I'm elastic tutorials I taught you guys how to log in and how to register but but what that but but I did not do it um safely yes that's how you log in but and that was safest way to log in or register because as of now our site with very vulnerable and our site can either leave behind the Hydra canyons from the database destroy the database into many many damages to your website so and this is for you I am going to show you how to protect did that okay so before I do that I just want to show you an example of what you might expect whenever they are hacking your website so I made a simple form it acts with a username and a password for the login and thank me for the registration now as you know if we put something like this and we could have big password it will automatically tell us that the account has not exist right but if I must a hacker which I'm not will hacker thank God things or something like or single quotes for one hi and then they will go ahead and copy that and paste that for the password as well at this time where they press the button they will be transformed transfer to your Facebook page and it will say hi whatever they type it or Warren so it's just coming off like you have count then they do not have an account so they can easily log in and that is the problem and also there are other examples where they can access somebody inflammation and they'll change to my information steals money information and stuff like that so we must have go ahead and he bet that happening so let's look at to our file and we'll just want to make a couple of changes replace everything and you'll see what I'm doing so the first thing is arm versus select remembers where user a was equal to post mutiny we're going to delete the post need to me with stuff like that I don't want to replace a little question and we will do the same thing for our past replacing with the question now the next thing we want to do is over here why sqllike query we want to change that so my SQL eye cream there okay so we're words who move take care statements now next time was the if the same powerful as arrow and a voice you Suffolk are buying Turan and the vine quorum function is telling us that we always find in finality and you're going to tell the database what forever there is bearable to do so it takes three parameters for now so so the first parameter it is going to take armed what type of data when you want the MySQL takes that in this case where we have username and password so both of them are streams so we're watching this two S's but I'm just using one might username alone there we'll just use one s and as you know there are different data site by integer e so if we're using an integer values I before using double leaving is B and implement using a bomb the l.l.bean maybe use the letter B so in this case we are using two streets so SS now comma and we are going to have a variable called a you but I want to make after we're done with this and my wife's make another bear will P so the variable a us for some hold our input for the username and the PE is for the past so let's go ahead and do that so a Mew is Point C equal to post here's our name and same thing for the password equals pulse past you and that's all Denise to pick up now the next thing the last thing I want to do is take that variable s s and you will set X to it so execute and now another thing what to do is go together replace the empty post username with a you same thing for password te and instead of saying my ask when I fetch Assoc they will stay the bamboo SS fetch and if it's greater than sea and we replaced this with a bearable age now and we'll do the same thing with this right here hey you and same thing for this right here and with PE and we'll also change the spike here so okay yeah you know um fetch sometimes all we did and that is all we need to do or right now well I think we're done so that makes me so you almost have what I did so instead of saying select everything remember the username is equal to post there's a name of stuff like that we substitute it with the question one and then instead of using for like 30 we use all right you care then we run the parameters and then we made two variables to hold our inputs name and then we execute and then when we faced everything that the variables au and PE and then instead of my sqli match Assoc we use the variable s test and it's going to stretch the arm the table get parameters so that is all we did now let's go ahead and save it and now I'm going to show you the difference between how he logged in with the single folds or on it and I tonight so this time we're going to try to log in with the same thing yet hopefully no errors and we don't have any errors so now is this accountant of negatives so that strength that they use it cannot be its own so you must have an account and in this case I don't have an account well I have multiple accounts so I'm just going to log in with Stephanie rocks and my password Stephanie frost and the password is password and this time this is hi Stefan ruff so I'm not in some remember the hacker cannot log in with that trick negative I mean person Egham be Singapore or one pipe night they cannot do that so that is it for me laughing on the next tutorial we will be arms only the registration this similar is the same thing but you will be going over that so thank you guys for watching and I will see you guys on the next tutorial bye
