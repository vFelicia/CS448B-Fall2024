hi everyone and welcome back to another tutorial with me in today's tutorial we will be going over operators in PHP over here I have listed the different operators using PHP so let's go over them the first one is called concatenation and this is for strength operators it basically joins two variables together so let's say we have a variable a equals to stephanie and then i have a second variable y equals 2 is great so what i want to do is join these two variables together so i want to make one sentence guesses stephanie is 3 so all I do is echo the first variable a dot the second variable Y and save that and as you can see it has the census stephanie is great so all the did was join two parables together and then there was another way to join them together all you have to do is make the same variable a dot equal the variable Y and just echo be variable a and it's the same thing when we refresh it so that is concatenation now let's learn about the second operator which is called arithmetic operators and these operators are addition subtraction multiplication division modulus and exponents this example says the variable a plus the variable Y so it's basically fun the sum of a and why so let's say we have the variable na equals 29 and be variable y equals 29 awesome and we ever be variable a plus B variable 9 at nine but the variable Y and be fresh and we get our answer which is 18 and also another way to do this is you can just have another variable C equals to the vanpool a plus B variable Y echo you very will see refresh and you get the same thing so that is how the arithmetic operator works let's go ahead and learn about assignment operators assignment operators are used with numeric values let's say we had X plus equal to Y which is the same thing as X equal X plus y so let's have an example we have B equals 29 then we have C equals 2 18 then we have the same variable B plus equals to the variable C and then echo be variable fee and voila 27 so that is all the assignment operator does is still add both of these numbers together but just in this way now we have comparison operators comparison operators compare two values so let's say we have the variable a equals to the variable Y so it's trying to find out if these two variables are equal then we have identical not equal not even then not identical greater than less than greater than or equal to and less than or equal to in this case let's just use the identical so I'm times we have two variables are equals 29 and F equals 2 hello now I'm going to do an if statement I want to find out if these two variables are identical so therefore R is identical to the barrel f if they are equal true if not else echo boss so save that and brush and get false they are not identical this has a number and this has a string so therefore they are not identical now let's move on to increment and decrement operator the increment basically as one to a number and the increment subtract one from a number head over here and let's make a new variable G equals 278 the same variable G plus plus now this is going to add one to the number 78 so echo the variableg and save it and you get 79 so all I did was add one to the number 78 now let's say we went to subtract one from 78 and with the minus minus which is the D payments operator and you get 77 so that is all the increment and decrement does add one subtract one now we have logical operators logical operators are used to combine conditional statements the first one is and and this one checks if the variable a and the variable Y are both true then we have the or one of them has to be true then we have X 4 then the assemble and the symbol or and not so let's try with end some more fan of two variables F is 12 equal to 9 is less than 2 then we have another verb r is equal to 9 is equal to 9 now go to an if statement and I want to see if they are both true so the variable F and the variable are if they are both true echo true if not else info box so save that and you get false because they are not true the first variable is false and the second verbal is true but both of them has to be true if we were using the or operator of our then it will be true because one of them is true and that is how the logical operators work the last operator we want to learn about is the array operators this compare arrays so we have Union which is a plus sign equal even which is equality then we have identity inequality inequality again and non identity so let's use be hmm that seems me identity and we want to see if these are identical so I'll just start a new one and have a verb r equals to nine then have another variable F equals to Stefan and we want to check if they are identical so r equal equal equal to F if it is I physical echo yes if not house echo you know i'll save it and we get no the two variables are not identical this is the number and this is a string so they are not identical in this case so that is it for the rate operators and that is it for this tutorial of all operators thank you guys for watching and I will see you guys on the next story
