hello everyone and welcome to another tutorial with me on the last tutorial we learned about different data types that variables can store and what the different data types are able to do I left out one data type because I wanted to do a special video for that one and that data type was object object is a data type which stores data and information in order to process that data it must be declared so let me go ahead and show you what I need so you're going to have a keyword called class the class is basically a structure that contains properties and awesome methods someone to name my class ice cream crony brackets and I'm going to have something called a function don't worry if you do not know what a function is we will learn this on later tutorials so function I'm going to name my function the same thing as my class and then I'm going to have a special variable called this and basically this right here means that it's going to address function or the property of our class so type um type of ice cream that I want is chocolates and now we are going to create our object let's create our object we're going to have a variable called here and here's one to equal to new I because we are making a variable called ice cream we have a class named ice cream unfortunately so in now we are going to show our object so I can go ahead Echo are of our variable here and it's high so it's basically going to print out the type um ice cream which is chocolate and save this and let's head over to our hello everyone cohost and welcome to another tutorial forward slash team on the last tutorial we learned about different data types that variables can store and what the different data types are able to do and that's not one data type so I wanted to do a special video and that data type was object images chocolate must be declared so let me go over this so one more time let me go ahead and so basically I've made a class named ice cream so we have a functioning ice cream you're going to have a camera I have a circle named this yeah contains properties and the time is equal to Chocolate so and then we create this objects on here and it creates ice cream ice cream don't worry if you do not know what a function is foreign and basically this right here means that it's going to address our function or the property of our class so type um type of ice cream that I want is chocolates and now we are going to create our object and to create our object we're going to have a variable uh here and here is going to equal to new ice because we are making a variable called ice cream we have a class name ice cream and functioning ice cream so in now we are going to show our object show and go ahead Echo are of our variable here and it's high so it's basically going to print out the type um ice cream which is chocolate and save this and let's head over to our localhost forward slash t u c dot PHP and it's loading loading loading loading let me just refresh this okay and here is the type of ice cream which is chocolate so let me go over this one more time so basically we've made a class named ice cream we have a function named ice ring and we have a variable name this which is referring to the class and the type is equal to chocolate and then we create an object which is called here and it creates our object ice cream and then we Echo the type of eye string which is chocolate now on the next tutorial I will be teaching you about something called functions and we'll go from there so thank you guys for watching and I will see you guys on the next tutorial thank you bye
