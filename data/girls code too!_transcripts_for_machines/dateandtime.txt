hi everyone is Stephanie and welcome to another tutorial with me in today's tutorial we will be going over date and time in PHP so let's begin so in order to display the date or the time you will need the date function so I'm just going to echo I'm going to use the date function and inside the parameters you gotta put the double or single quotes in between the double or single hold you will format the date so um you can format the date anyway you want to i'm going to start with the letter L which is form the day of the week m which is for the month d which is for the day of the month and y which is for a year and i'm going to save that go over to localhost / / touch dot PHP it says wednesday 830 116 so the day is wrong in this case because today is not one play and today is that the 31st so today is tuesday the 30th so the reason why is giving us the wrong date because arm the current date comes from the server whatever your server is from whatever country is from that's the current date is going to get so to change that and to change it to your default timezone you will do something in my underscored default underscored times on on the score set so in this case you will set your time zone and i'm going to set my time them to America forward slash New York or this is my time zone and I'm going to save that refresh and then we'll get an invalid okay okay because America has to be capitalized and also no York has to be spaced so we're going to put it under score here and say that in french and we get tuesday 830 16 which is the correct date for today now that is for the date let's say we want to get the time so I'm just want to keep this or can have my default timezone and I am just going to erase this to get the time you will have h which is for the hour I which is for the minute s which toured a second and a rich is for a.m. or p.m. and you save that refresh and you get 939 48 p.m. now we can also change the time zone if we want to so I will say something my Los Angeles save your fresh and we get 6 40 15 remember Los Angeles is three hours behind so that is the time zone and you can also mix this up so we can say something like we have a year we can have the month if you have a day and we can have the day of the week you can go ahead and refresh so we have the best of both worlds we have the date and we have the time and you also can't format this in any way you can use for / but each one you can use the dot you can use the ash thread or whatever is best for you now let's say we want it to create the date or the time so in order to do that I'll erase this I'm going to make a bearable oo m and n is going to equal to MKE time function and this allows you to create the date and it returns the unix time stamp so i could create my date and my time so i'll go ahead and i'll go ahead and have different numbers you want to have six numbers want to have 11 2254 won 2017 and I will have 30 so i have 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 numbers so now i will go ahead and echo date and the former i want to i want this to be n is l and the y comma the variable in so control save and we will refresh this and basically this is the date that we created sunday august 1731 so there you have it so that is how we create our date now let's say we want it to create a date from the string now this will be a little bit different so I'm going to have a bearable all s SS going to equal to a function str2 time and so what this function does it takes the string and convert it to you next time so i'm going to write the word tomorrow and what I want is for it to give me the date or tomorrow so echo date meet the year the month the day and the day of the week so control save well actually call me and you will add your bearable so save that and refresh and tomorrow will be wednesday the 31st and i can also say give me the date for a hundred days from that 100 days so 100 days from now will be 16 1208 on the third day and we can do 500 days 500 days from now and we will get 1801 12 friday and that is how that works that's how you create a date from spring so that is it for this tutorial we learn about the beads and a time of PHP so I hope you guys learned a lot and I will see you guys on the next tutorial bye
