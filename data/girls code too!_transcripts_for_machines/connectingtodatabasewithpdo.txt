hi everybody this is Stephanie and welcome to another tutorial is seen in a today's tutorial we are going to be learning about PPO so the first thing is I'm going to give you a little introduction about PBL is danced for PhD data objects um it's another way to connect to your database it's very consistent it has a nice interface I can assure you that you will write cleaner and safer cold and it also has many drivers for different drivers like I should say so now let's go ahead and dive into it the first time I showed you how to connect I was using um PHP an ally so I did something like connect equal to MySQL connect and then I did the parentheses and then I had different variables that hold and you know my host name my username then also my password and then I had for my database but what they do it will be a bit different so let me go ahead anyway since and in order to connect using PDO you will write connect equals to new TVO parenthesis double quote if then we will go ahead and write my sequel um like that house equals to my host name which is local home if then after the locals you have a semicolon in an F of semicolon you like B be equal to whatever your database is but as right now I do not have a database name so I will skip over and I will have my comma and then I'll have my username Isha's road and then I'll have my password which is equal to nothing and in order to see if we are connected let's make an if statement if connect if we are connected fo you are connected Oh F oh sorry you are not connected and I was in going to say that and fresh and we have an a message on line two oh my gosh I keep forgetting this L okay so save that and now let's go back and we are connected how easy was that very clean and we don't have to do all that stuff we do with karai so that is how you basically connect using PBO now on the next tutorial we will learn how to create our database using PDO so I will see you guys on the next tutorial and that's it for today bye
