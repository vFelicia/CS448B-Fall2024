hello everyone this is Stephanie and I am back with another tutorial on PHP and MySQL I today we are going to be learning about forgot username and for that password so let's say you have an account but you forgot your username or your password or even both so I'm going to show you my way of how undo it and you can go ahead and follow along and if it works for you just put a comment below or you know like my page and subscribe so let's begin um I have I have already set up the main page for you it just have a login form it has a link and you know we have to go by it so let me go ahead and show you how that looks and this is the main page so we have the login form and we have our link for that username or password so if I click on this link it will send me to another page called forgot you dot PHP and it's going to ask for my email address and then we have a recover button now the only two files that we will be working on into the forgot show dot PHP page and the info dot PHP page I have already made the connection page and I have a welcome you dot PHP page whenever you decide to login so let's go to the let's go to the forgot your dot PHP page and the first time we want to do is session we want to start the session the session start and the next thing we want to do is require that connection page we so connection dot php' and that is it for now now what we want to do is whenever the user click the button what we want to happen so we're going to make an if statement and we're going to say if is that what is that so if the button and the name is recovery as you can see this is the name so if that but it is click this mitad happening and I mean spell that right so if this button is clicked what do we want to do well the first thing we want to do is we want to make a vample to get our table so i'm going to call this the ql equal to select everything from the table qin table where our email is equal to the email that they input and I made my email implant email now the next thing you want to do is want to make another variable say ql q equal to the mysql I query and in this case we're going to put connect down this is from the connection page right over here then let me just go ahead and put my bearable EQL so it's going to search the table for the email that they posted now what we want to do is make another if statement inside this if statement and we're going to say if not him what is not empty if but um email input is not empty and MySQL I fetch Assoc Lee qlq is greater than zero and we want to check if it's a valid email address so not filter bar I'm going to put the email email come on filter validate email guys give me a second and I'll go right back I am so sorry guys I have to handle something but anyways let's continue so if not just of our email those to validate email if it's not equal to false okay so if all this is true the input is not empty on the email exists and it's a valid email address then what do we want to do well the first thing we want to do is we're going to make a session bear one and we're going to call this session bearable info equal to not equal but yeah equal so that post email and then we want to head we want to give it be directed to our other page called info dot PHP so that is what we that is what we want to do now let's say if there's an error what do we want to do here they're going to make a couple of if and else if statements now I'm going to say if NP post email if it is empty what I want to do well we're going to make a bearable V and just want to hold our message for us and this is going to say what is your email else if and I'm just going to copy this right here I'm kind of like yeah you can say if I'm kind of lazy and I don't want to do this right now I'm just kidding guys okay so my is my my fetch is socially if this one is less than one so what you know what yeah what do we want to do there go ahead and make that verbal be in this time is going to equal to that email does not think this else if I want to say now let as a run effect I'm going to rearrange this popping and race that go ahead and paste it over here into that okay else if what do we want to do and I'm going to copy this again off the pace and this is going to equal to true it doesn't matter if you um put it in caps or don't take lower case it doesn't matter so if not pills of our host email it's not a valid email address what do we do I'm going to make that same variable and we're going to say in valid email and that is what we do for that page so let me go over this page one more time so we we first start the session will require our connection page and then we said if the button is clicked if they if they submit the email be passed by it what it wants to do well first we want to select the email from our table we want to get the query and then we said if not empty if the input is not empty if the email does exist and if it's a valid email address and it's not equal to false then start um we're going to make a session variable and it's going to redirect us to infidel PHP and then we said if it is empty so this message if it's an invalid email Doris to message and if the email does not exist throw this message so that is all we did for the forgot PHP page now we can go ahead and save that and we're going to go over to our info PHP page in this page it's not going to be that long so the first thing I'm going to do is start the session also in here so session start and we're also going to require the connection page and then we're going to have a couple of variables so the first of all we're going to have we're going to call this an ql equal to is going to select everything from the table qin table where email is equal to that session variable that we made those session and we call it info now we want to go ahead and make another variable a qlq equal to MySQL I query Connect and we're going to have another variable a QL and let's just have another variable you just click all this a ql q q equal to MySQL and I fetch Assoc and in this case we're going to fetch available a ql q so wait we're basically fetching the table now just two more variables and we're we're done okay so I'm going to have a first value it's going to equal to a QL q and we're going to say username here so it's going to get the username from the table and P which is equal to aq l QQ and it's going to get the password and then the last thing we have to do is just echo let's say something like you're in formation is dot dot great dot hmm we'll say something like okay yeah I'm going to have a variable u dot want to make another complaint I'm going to say dot and that dog there will P and that is all we have to do so now let's save this baby and let's go ahead and type in our email so the first thing I'm gonna do I'm type in something like this let's just see everything work mmm okay I've got to do one more thing oh my gosh so embarrassing okay so I'm gonna go over here right next to my Astrid and I'm going to make a little PHP I'll say echo be variable V and I'm going to save that okay now refresh that and now you see it says invalid email so let me write a valid email my s at yahoo.com and it says that you know does not exist now let me write the correct email that does exist on a file I'm a semi cover and here it is it says your information is staffing which is your username and star 22 which is my password and that is all he did so I hope you see on how we did that you know it wasn't much you know it looked at pretty easy so let me go over this page one more time so we start the session when you require the connection that PHP page we submit from the table the email and we said get the session and phone well the session nervo we made and then I said yet the query fetch the table and then get the username and password from the table and I say echo your information is whatever your information is and that is all we did so I hope that was so easy I hope it was easy for me but I hope you guys learned a lot and I am looking forward to see you guys on the next couple of tutorials so thank you guys for watching and I will see you guys later
