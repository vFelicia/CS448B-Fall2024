hi everyone it's Stephanie and welcome to another tutorial with me in today's tutorial we are going to be learning about arrays now arrays are a way to store multiple values in one string let's say you had a list of items you don't want to sit here and make a whole bunch of variables holding your items like H you don't want to sit there and do this all day so that is where the array is the solution now over here I have written the three different arrays that are used so the first one is called indexed arrays and index arrays are arrays with numeric index so let's go ahead and show you an example of that so to make an array you have to have a variable equal to the array function and then you will have your different values or strings that you want inside the parentheses so I'm going to have Sam Anna Isaiah and and that's so and we can store multiple values as many as many values as we want so that is how the index arrays look like now let's say we wanted to print out a specific index from the array now know that index starts with the number zero and so on and so forth 1 2 3 4 5 or whatever so in this case Sam is number zero and is number one and Isaiah is number two that is how it works so let's say I want to call a specific index so I'm going to call Anna and Anna is number one so save that and let's go over to Local Host fort. PHP and then we have Anna her index number is one so if we wanted to print out everything in there we can just do it there's two ways to do this the first way is like this dot no you just call the array function I mean the array variable then we have inex one dot it's called the last one which is not one zero and three two so let's save that and there you go we have Anna Sam and Isaiah and then the second way to do to call all of them is by looping through the array and to do this first you must find the length of the array and to find the length of the array you would do a varable Ray equals to the function count and inside the parentheses you will have your array variable and then you will do a for Loop for this and you will have a variable I'll have a equals to0 and then the variable a is less than the length of the array and last but not least A++ now all we have to do is just say Echo I'm going to say Echo names dot the array variable name and the variable a now let's save that and there you go so we got name Sam name Anna and name Isaiah so that is how the index array works now let's talk about the associative arrays now this array is is with name keys so let me show show you that one and erase this it's not erasing erase and then this have um fry equals to Ray now here's the difference now we're going to have a name right and we're going to assign it to a Val so to assign it we just have this the equal sign and the greater than sign then the value that's going to be assigned to his name Sally is the number 17 and then we will have another name um the D and that name is going to be assigned to the number 20 and you can add more if you want to and then let's go ahead and Echo I and instead of calling the index like we did with the um the index arrays you call it by name so I'm going to call Sally and it is going to tell me your age so let me just have a a little text here that says Sally is it's want to say Sally is 17 now Watch What Happens here and then it says onl we have unexpected right okay so we missed the dot here and let's go ahead and refresh so now it says Sally is 17 how does it know Sally is 17 because it called it called um the number 17 by her name then we could do the same thing for DD so we have dot d is do D and save that and and it says DD is 20 and that is how the associative array works so it is assigned a key and when we call the name it basically brings out the key so now let's say if we wanted to to look through this so we will do count function so just call C count and I'll have my variable and then for this we are not going to use a for Loop we are going to use another loop that's called for each Loop now yeah you're probably thinking why didn't she teach about the for each Loop when she was teaching about the different Loops now the reason for that is because before each Loop is only used for arrays so that is why I wanted to teach it in this tutorial since we are talking about Rel so the four each Loop goes like this for each and then you will have your array name which is fry as and you will have make up a variable I'll call this G and we will have the key and then last part it have G value then we will go ahead and Echo and let me just say something WR your name dot the variable g dot h dot the variable G and you'll say Val so let's go ahead and save this and we have name Sally age 7 name DD age 20 so that is how you can loop with the associative array now the last array we want to learn about is called multidimensional arrays and this array contains one or more arrays so let me go ahead and show you what I am talking about so we have let's call this air equals to array now inside this array is going to be multiple arrays so I'm just going to have two you can make as many arrays as you want to so we have Ray then in here I'm just going to have um H cheese and cake then just going to copy and paste this and I'm going to have orange Ginger and tea and we're going to have soda um coffee chips and over here we're going to have soap and we're going to have Al and we're going to have great so that is what the multidimensional array looks like so it's inside of an array and it has multiple arrays so to Echo these arrays you must you Echo you call the array name air and you're going to have two index index so it's 0o one so this right here is zero then one then two then three so I'm just going to call the first one for the first array then I'm going just go ahead and call the second one for the second array and that one is going to be one one then going to call the third one um that one is going to be um two one well that's the second one I said the third one my M and then we have so we have zero one two and the third one which is the last one so do air and we're going to have one so let's go ahead and save it and expecting okay this is something I do all the time I don't know why but you're supposed to have a comma in instead and I'm always having I'm always mixing it up with okay so you have the comments so save that and and cheese which is in the first array and that's number one and then we have ginger which is in the second and that's one now excuse me for saying for a second so zero row zero array one and array two it called coffee and then last one which is Apple so that is how the multidimensional array works so it's basically a side the array and then we have multiple arrays you can have as many as you want a th 4,000 or you know just exaggerating but just the name of you you can have a lot of arrays inside that one array so that is how the different arrays are in PHP so that's it for this tutorial on the next tutorial I will be teaching you about sorting arrays
