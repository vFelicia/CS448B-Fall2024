hello everyone and welcome to another tutorial with me and in today's tutorial we will be learning about functions what are functions functions are basically a block of statements that can be used repeatedly in a program a function will be only executed by a call to the function you must call the function in order for it to be executed one thing about a function is that it would not be it would not execute immediately when the page has load or when a page is loading so let's get right into it and what is the function so you start with the word function then you name the function anything you like you can start with the letter or a underscore you cannot start with the number and also the names can be case sensitive or capitalized doesn't matter now I'm going to name mine my function and then I'm going to have my parentheses and then my curly brackets then I'm going to click enter now over here is where you write your codes then for my code I'm going to write Echo Theresa is pretty now if I go ahead and save this and I go to my file localhost forward slash tut dot PHP and let me fix that little error on line four Echo princess okay so I'm Gonna Save that and refresh nothing is displayed on the screen now why is that text not displayed on the screen that is because we did not call the function and to call a function so call the function and write the function's name my function name is my function and then I have my parentheses and in that let's save it now when I refresh this Teresa is pretty it's printed out on the screen and that is because we called the function so now another thing to learn about to know about function is that information can be passed to functions using something called arguments and arguments are just like variables so once we have an argument or a function I mean not a function but a variable called here now I'm going to Echo the function here and I'm gonna have another text um pick boxing so now I'm going to call my function and I'm just going to have one simple text in there I love now what's going to happen is that is going to add kickboxing to this text right here so let's go ahead and test that out and save now it says I love kickboxing only thing that happened was it added the arguments here which has kickboxing right over here that's all it did hit add the function not a function but it adds a variable now let's say if we wanted to add more arguments you can do that you can add as many arguments as you want I'm just going to add one more this is going to be apple then I'm going to Echo the variable here tennis and also the other variables Apple and I'm just going to name this Apple so now I'm going to um call my function and I'm going to say I love comma and I love and watch what's going to happen I love tennis and I love Apple all it did was add the arguments that's all it did and the arguments so that it and add the argument um here which has tennis and it add the um arguments Apple which has Apple and that's all it did now let's learn about how the function can have a permanent argument let's learn about that so let's say I have a function not a function but variable or argument name G and G is equal to the number 20 .1 now I'm going to um Echo just the variable by itself now what I'm going to do is um Echo no actually call the function and don't put nothing inside of parentheses and then I'm going to call the function again and I'm going to have the number 40 inside there so let's save this and refresh and you have 21 and 40. by default the number is 21. and then we added the number 40. instead of displaying the default we said display the number 40. and that is permanent arguments with the function now the last thing we should learn about is returning our function so let's say I have a variable a and a variable B and then I have a variable C which oh which holds sorry which holds a Plus B then I'm going to return the variable C so what's going to happen is I'm going to add two numbers together and it's going to give me the answer PSI I'm going to Echo um I'm going to add a number 18. plus 9 equal to now Dot column function now in the parentheses we're going to have the numbers 18 and 9. so once will happen is is going to add the numbers 18 and 9 18 is variable a 9 is variable B it's yeah variable B so most let's go ahead and save this and refresh and 18 plus 9 equals 27. so basically it returns C and C equals two variable a plus variable B and that is how you return the function so that is it for this tutorial we went over functions and the different things it can do so on the next tutorial hmm I don't know what I'm going to teach but I will see you guys on the next tutorial so thank you guys for watching and I will see you later bye
