hi everyone and stephanie and welcome to another tutorial with me in today's tutorial we are going to be learning about include and requires statement in PHP now in food and requirement takes all the texts in code that exist in a file and coffees that ensued the file that includes or requirement now let's go ahead and begin so I'm going to head over to a stop PHP and i'm just going to echo arm hello and let's say that and now we are going to go to our techmount PHP page and what i want to do is include PHP into this page someone have all headed include single quotes or double doesn't matter us dot PHP and i'm going to say that and let's test this out so locals power / type dot PHP and as you can see hello is a suede on the screen and it is from the US dot PHP page that's where the echo hello so all it did was should add the page of stop you PHP page on to touch up PHP and as you can see we are still on localhost dot PHP so that's all it does and the require does the same exact thing so say that refresh and you get the same answer so that is all the influence and require does the only little difference is when they have an error message so when there is the error message in include say if the file does not exist it will tell you that it will give you a warning but it will continue the script with required it will tell you the error message and it will stop the script so that is all for include and inquire so thank you guys for watching and I will see you guys on the next tutorial
