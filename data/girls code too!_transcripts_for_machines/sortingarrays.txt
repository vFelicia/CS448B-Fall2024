hi everyone it's Stephanie and welcome to another tutorial with me in today's tutorial we are going to be learning about sorting arrays now let's start with the first s so the first one we have sort function which is ascending order alphabetically and then we have our SW which is descending order alphabetically let's go ahead and show you an example of these two so we will have our array and I'm just going to have random names like app um June KCK and basketball now we are going to have the sort function and let's put our array variable there and we are also going to count our array length so gals to count and and for this we are going to do a for Loop a = z a is less than G and A++ Echo no Echo and the name was D and then we have a so let's go ahead and I'm already there so refresh and the items are in alphabetical order so at first it was Apple June kick the basketball now it's Apple basketball Dre then kick and then the second one is called AR sword which is descending order so it's still in alphabetical order but it's backwards so now it's k j basketball day and those are sort function and R sort now let's learn about assort and kort now the assort function is to sort associative arrays in the city order according to the value and K sort sorts associative arrays in a cic order according to the key so let's go ahead and begin those examples so have another one and I'm going to have s then we are going to have a sort have our varable then let's count the array Lane um just WR lals count and this is f sorry about that F and then we will do a four each Loop for this for favorite dot get and you're done with that control save and refresh so it's a alphabetical order but only because according to the value so according to the value this is how it's mined up now if we did the case work it will be according to the key so let's go ahead and do that one so Cas s save it and refresh and it changed so it's now red I forgot to put value here so save that and refresh again so name red favorite 14 all that so that is the assorts and kort now the last one we want to learn about is AR sort function which is sorting the associ arrays in descending order according to the value and then we have KR sort which sorts the associa Rays in the syore according to this the the key so we don't really have to do this over so I'll just change this to AR sort and save this and you will see what I'm talking about so now it's and a s so it's in descending order according to the value and then we have KR s refesh Sammy favorite 8 P Favorite 20 and Fred favorite 14 and that is the KR swort in this head and this is in descending word so that is the different ways you sort or ra that's it for this tutorial thank you guys for watching and I will see you guys on the next tutorial
