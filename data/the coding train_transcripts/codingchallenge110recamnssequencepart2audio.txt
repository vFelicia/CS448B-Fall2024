00:04 - all right hello I'm back in this video
00:07 - I'm to another video about the recomment
00:11 - in the previous video what I did was
00:15 - visualize it and you can see here this
00:17 - is me vision this is not me but this is
00:19 - the p5 code I wrote to visualize the
00:21 - recommend number sequence as a
00:23 - continuous series of arcs looks like
00:26 - they're circles but they're actually
00:27 - connected arcs you can watch the
00:28 - previous video where I go and build this
00:30 - whole code but one of the things that
00:32 - people that you can do also with number
00:33 - sequences besides visualize them is
00:36 - create an audio version of them and in
00:38 - fact if you go back to mine your
00:40 - favorite website entirely in the entire
00:41 - world the online encyclopedia of integer
00:43 - sequences you know if I'm here on the
00:46 - recommendation and it will give me a
00:51 - MIDI file MIDI being a system for
00:55 - encoding music as numbers so if I can
00:58 - encode music as numbers and I have a
01:00 - number sequence then I can make that
01:02 - number sequence MIDI and then I can play
01:05 - it as music so this is what I want to
01:06 - try to do and I'm going to attempt to do
01:08 - it with the p5.js
01:10 - sound library making use probably and
01:13 - this I don't really know that well so
01:14 - we're doing a lot of looking up in the
01:15 - reference while I do this learn to do it
01:17 - with it oscillator to generate a sound
01:19 - and the envelope an envelope to kind of
01:22 - craft that sound essentially creating my
01:25 - own synthesizer should also mention that
01:27 - um this video was pointed out to me from
01:30 - Dale Gert Amon
01:32 - which is also visualizing the sequence
01:34 - and a completely different wedding with
01:36 - colors and also making it into audio so
01:38 - I hope after watching both of these we
01:41 - will see a world full of I mean I don't
01:45 - know do we want this world I think why
01:47 - not let's see a world full of
01:48 - visualizations and audio versions of
01:51 - numeric sequences okay so let's start
01:53 - coding again I'm gonna close these
01:56 - windows I'm gonna go here and let's
02:01 - think about this so do I want to I'm
02:02 - gonna keep the visualization going and
02:05 - basically so I could start from
02:09 - scrimmage us keep this code I'm gonna
02:11 - add to it and what I want to do is I
02:14 - want to play a note so let's see if I
02:18 - how to best to do this so the first
02:20 - thing that I know that I need to do is I
02:22 - need to create an oscillator an
02:24 - oscillator is an object that will
02:27 - generate a tone and there are different
02:30 - kinds of oscillators right I it's
02:32 - basically a pure sound wave and I can
02:35 - have a sine wave or a triangle wave and
02:38 - I believe I have a video about p5
02:40 - oscillators that will go into that
02:42 - perhaps a bit more but I thought what
02:44 - I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna take this
02:45 - code exactly as is and I'm gonna paste
02:49 - it in to set up your coding challenge
02:52 - copy paste from examples and then I'm
02:55 - going to create make that a global
02:56 - variable and I'm going to discover what
02:59 - interesting error I will have now so p5
03:03 - oscillator is not a constructor why do I
03:06 - have why did this come up why do I have
03:07 - this because I don't actually use the
03:10 - sound library that often and I didn't
03:12 - include it here I should use it more
03:14 - often so I'm going to go and add
03:17 - reference in my HTML file to the p5
03:20 - sound library so hopefully that's going
03:23 - to clear that error up great it's going
03:25 - do I hear anything mm-hmm
03:28 - so let's go to the sketch and why do I
03:30 - not hear anything because I set the
03:33 - amplitudes to zero let's set the
03:35 - amplitude to 1 and which is 100% volume
03:38 - I'm hit refresh
03:44 - so now you hear the sine-wave now so
03:47 - what's what do I want to do here so I
03:49 - have this I don't really click back here
03:51 - to stop the sound for a second I have
03:53 - this number sequence that's going up we
03:55 - can look at those numbers there 0 1 3 6
03:58 - 2 7 13 20 so what if I just took each
04:01 - number and assigned it and took the
04:05 - number in the sequence and made it a
04:06 - frequency so for example as I'm stepping
04:09 - through I could say oscillator frequency
04:13 - index right index is actually the number
04:16 - of that that's currently part of the
04:18 - sequence so if I do this and go back to
04:21 - here and click on this I don't hear
04:23 - anything
04:23 - do you hear something you might have to
04:24 - have headphones have it turned up
04:25 - eventually I think I'm gonna start
04:26 - hearing something so here's the thing
04:28 - there is a range of frequencies
04:30 - frequency as being a measurement of how
04:34 - many cycles of a wave per second we can
04:38 - start to hear it like that okay so for a
04:48 - while we didn't hear any notes and then
04:49 - also we started to hear something so
04:50 - here's I think it's much too arbitrary
04:52 - to just setting the number from zero to
04:55 - whatever as the frequency there is a
04:57 - specific audible range or frequencies
04:59 - that we can hear and so and there also
05:02 - are formulas for converting from MIDI
05:04 - notes to frequency and back and forth
05:06 - I'm sorry about this applause there's
05:08 - nothing to do with me clearly there's
05:09 - nothing going on in the hallway there's
05:11 - nothing I could do about it right now so
05:12 - it's gonna be in this video forever but
05:14 - umm and so I pretty sure that p5 has a
05:16 - like MIDI - frequency or - note or
05:20 - something function somewhere but I'm
05:23 - actually I'm not gonna use that I'm
05:25 - gonna go to this Wikipedia page which I
05:27 - have loaded up here called piano key
05:28 - frequencies and if you look at this this
05:31 - formula here I want to use this
05:32 - basically if we number all the keys on
05:36 - the piano from the very bottom key to
05:38 - the top key I can't remember how many
05:39 - keys are on a piano 88 keys standard 108
05:43 - key extended we can actually find the
05:45 - frequency of any key N through this
05:47 - formula sure we could think about this
05:50 - in interesting ways but I'm just gonna
05:51 - go and use this formula so look at this
05:53 - I'm going to say
05:55 - if the if the recommen knows all these
06:00 - numbers and I'm just gonna do from zero
06:01 - to 88 like I'm not gonna let it go
06:04 - forever if I consider each one needs to
06:06 - be a key on the piano then we should be
06:08 - able to play the music so really this is
06:13 - very distracting
06:15 - all right okay so I want to say the the
06:21 - frequency is and go back to this formula
06:24 - two to the N minus 49 okay so power -
06:28 - and of what n which is index - 49
06:32 - divided by divided by 12 times and I
06:40 - believe it was 440 it's for 440 I wonder
06:44 - for 40 is like middle C or the note a I
06:46 - think it's the tune to a 440 so a is
06:49 - like the 440 is a Hertz is the is the
06:53 - note a so so now if I were to say this
06:59 - and let's console.log index and the
07:04 - frequency just to hear it and I also
07:05 - want to just go to set up and I'm gonna
07:08 - if I already had set the frame rate down
07:09 - to five and anticipation of this but I'm
07:11 - actually set it to one make it even
07:13 - slower all right let's take a listen
07:23 - do you guys hear those very low notes
07:26 - [Music]
07:30 - use index mod 88 that makes sense all
07:40 - right so I can't seem to get those
07:50 - really low notes to play let's increase
07:53 - the frame rate so first of all I would
07:54 - need to add an envelope to this the
07:56 - whole point of this I wanted to sound
07:57 - somewhat nice so what is an envelope so
08:00 - in addition to the oscillator there is
08:02 - this thing called an envelope and
08:05 - envelope has four elements to it they're
08:08 - actually described right here and I have
08:10 - a video all about this which is attack
08:12 - decay sustain release so you think about
08:14 - playing a note like when you hit a note
08:15 - on the piano there's the sort of attack
08:17 - there's the notes for fading out there's
08:20 - the sustain there's the release all
08:22 - those those four things various
08:25 - parameters I'm just gonna kind of use a
08:26 - default setting and I'm gonna go to this
08:30 - example P v dot envelope and this sort
08:34 - of look so let's let's grab thank you
08:38 - well that's crab putting because I have
08:40 - fake applause sound effect and then
08:43 - there's people applauding answer so I'm
08:45 - gonna grab all of this stuff these
08:48 - settings for that envelope I am going to
08:53 - create an envelope right here and then
08:59 - I'm going to make the envelope sorry
09:01 - before I make the oscillator so I
09:05 - basically want to use the envelope in
09:07 - cents as a wrapper around the oscillator
09:09 - the oscillator is going to give me the
09:11 - quality of the sound and the frequency
09:14 - is what kind of wave it is and the
09:16 - envelope is gonna allow me to make it
09:17 - feel like I'm almost playing a key on a
09:19 - synthesizer
09:20 - and so now if we go and look here we can
09:23 - see envelope play so now so the
09:28 - amplitude gets tied to the envelope so
09:33 - instead of saying amplitude of one I'm
09:34 - gonna say awesome amplitude envelope and
09:38 - then I'm just going to say envelope dot
09:40 - play let's try this
09:43 - and I need to start any frequency on
09:46 - envelope top play okay so then I want to
09:49 - then I want to also comment this out
09:51 - right now
09:52 - and just we should just hear one note
09:54 - you hear that so what I'm going to do
10:07 - now is I should be able to then say I
10:11 - should be able to set the frequency and
10:13 - play the envelope again so here I'm
10:18 - gonna set the frequency and I'm going to
10:23 - play the envelope again I am going to
10:31 - not set the frequency here or play the
10:33 - envelope here and let's see what we get
10:38 - these okay that is loud I don't know if
10:49 - I just totally destroyed your ears one
10:52 - thing that I can do here that would be
10:53 - kind of nice would be to make this
10:57 - actually index mod 88 so that if the
11:02 - index goes higher than the last key on
11:04 - the keyboard it will then wrap back down
11:06 - to the bottom one and I almost feel like
11:09 - what I want to do is use a smaller range
11:11 - but let's try this I'm gonna turn the
11:14 - volume down a little bit how's the
11:17 - volume
11:20 - [Music]
11:29 - I'm terrible at doing stepid-- music and
11:32 - sounds hold on this video is not over
11:35 - yet
11:37 - getting a suggestion from the chat from
11:39 - K week mom saying you will get more
11:41 - musical results by restricting the range
11:44 - of it I'd say 2 octaves top so what I
11:48 - should be doing here is basically two
11:52 - octaves right would be how many notes
11:56 - total 24 C C sharp D d sharp e F f-sharp
12:04 - G g-sharp a a sharp B that's 12 then I
12:10 - have C so that's 12 notes total so if I
12:16 - so I want like range of two octaves
12:18 - would be 24 notes and maybe I would
12:22 - allow the last note so I would have 25
12:24 - notes so I would maybe I want to say
12:26 - something like the the N is index + I
12:31 - don't know I should start up somewhere
12:33 - like plus 48 modulus 25 is that like
12:44 - crazy Oh 14 + - 49 that's interesting
12:50 - okay
12:51 - so is this does this make any sense at
12:54 - all
12:55 - [Music]
13:02 - let's try a little bit higher like 24 48
13:05 - 96 what because I'm I'm module no no no
13:13 - no I have to modulus the 25 plus 48 this
13:38 - better so anyway now you see that I a
13:49 - have no in addition having no visual
13:52 - talent I also have no musical talent I
13:54 - don't know that much about music I know
13:55 - but I played the violin and I attempt to
14:03 - play a very out of tune ukulele alright
14:06 - so this is the end of my video
14:10 - I've said that so many times share with
14:13 - me your musical compositions based off
14:14 - of this number sequence or other number
14:16 - sequences and ways that you discover and
14:19 - I look forward to seeing you in future
14:22 - coding challenges ok goodbye
14:29 - [Music]
