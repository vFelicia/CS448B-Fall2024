00:00 - hello so I'm about to make a few more
00:03 - videos about objects in JavaScript and
00:06 - p5 and how you can deal with these
00:08 - objects in arrays if you want to add
00:10 - some features to your code like clicking
00:11 - on the objects or deleting objects from
00:13 - the array or making your objects and
00:15 - have display images all sorts of things
00:17 - like that but before I get there I want
00:18 - to do something to kind of simplify my
00:21 - workflow it'll help you with your
00:23 - workflow and take a break from coding
00:25 - for a second just to look at how to move
00:27 - your code part of your code to a
00:29 - separate file slash separate tab and
00:32 - enter so this is really p5 specific
00:33 - although it actually is relevant even if
00:35 - you work using the p5 editor but here
00:38 - you can see here's a sketch that I built
00:40 - probably in a previous video where
00:42 - there's a ten objects that are made and
00:45 - set up those objects are being moved and
00:47 - displayed and you see them on the screen
00:48 - and the code for those objects is all in
00:50 - a constructor function this constructor
00:52 - functions job is to make those bubble
00:54 - objects new bubble triggers this
00:56 - function a new object is made it's
00:58 - returned back and that object is then
01:00 - put into the array bubbles now this is
01:04 - this works it's on one page but you know
01:06 - this bubble object get very very complex
01:08 - and could have a lot of code I'd like to
01:09 - put it somewhere else so what I would
01:11 - like to do right here is hit this plus
01:14 - button what this plus button will do is
01:16 - make another file associated with this
01:19 - particular project so when I hit this
01:22 - plus button I get a window here and I
01:24 - can give it a name I'm going to call it
01:25 - bubble Jas because I want a file just to
01:28 - put my bubble constructor function in so
01:29 - it can be in its own neat and tidy place
01:31 - because meat and Titan as well it just
01:34 - makes me happy but in the world should
01:36 - be messy it's okay to be messy I just I
01:38 - can handle it
01:39 - ok so there we go now you can see I have
01:42 - two tabs I have sketched j/s which has
01:44 - all my code and I have bubble J's which
01:46 - is blank so what do I want to do I want
01:49 - to go to sketch and I'm going to take
01:51 - all of this code I'm going to say
01:53 - command X to cut it and I'm going to go
01:55 - over to the bubble tab and I must say
01:57 - command V to paste it and so I now have
02:00 - two tabs sketch j/s you can see fits all
02:04 - here in the window which is just so
02:06 - extraordinarily nice right there's the
02:08 - beginning there's there's the balls
02:10 - array they're set up there's draw this
02:12 - is all the
02:12 - it's just so look at this just such a
02:14 - nice program all there is is an array
02:17 - and then you put things in the array and
02:18 - you do everything to be right it just it
02:20 - just works and it's lovely but
02:22 - everything that has to do with the
02:23 - bubble is now here in this separate tab
02:26 - so I can look at the bubble of
02:29 - constructor function so when I want to
02:31 - add new properties to bubbles like
02:33 - bubbles should all have their own color
02:34 - or bubbles should have another function
02:36 - where they check to see if they're off
02:37 - the screen all that stuff I can add here
02:40 - now I missed a step and this is a step
02:44 - that probably will eventually be taken
02:45 - care of for you by the editor but
02:48 - currently this is not something the
02:50 - editor does oh and I I didn't even
02:51 - realize I had left I had left this open
02:54 - from when I was setting up for this
02:55 - video but if you're just really here
02:57 - first with it you your your window would
03:00 - look like this so you would just see you
03:02 - have a sketch tab and a bubble tab but
03:04 - actually here up here is a Settings icon
03:07 - and I can click settings and here is an
03:09 - option for show sidebar and what the
03:12 - sidebar is going to show me over here is
03:14 - all the files associated with this
03:16 - sketch so as you're aware now you have
03:19 - your two JavaScript files your sketch KS
03:22 - and your bubble jeaious both of those
03:24 - JavaScript files are where you keep your
03:26 - code but there's also this libraries
03:29 - folder now that libraries folder happens
03:31 - to be where the p5.js library it's
03:33 - itself is and you know what that is it's
03:35 - just another JavaScript file so so
03:37 - different beef our Jes is just like more
03:39 - JavaScript it's just you didn't have to
03:41 - write that when you call ellipse the
03:43 - definition for the function ellipse is
03:45 - in that file and if you want to learn
03:46 - more about how p5.js works and start
03:49 - contributing to p5.js you might open
03:50 - that file up and take a look through it
03:52 - now a lot of it will have weird crazy
03:54 - syntax that you haven't seen before and
03:55 - lots more dots and lots more parentheses
03:58 - but that's the kind of thing that you
04:00 - might build your way up to eventually
04:02 - and get it every once in a while you can
04:03 - also see that there's p5.js which is a
04:07 - library another library file that I
04:09 - would like that I'm plan to make use of
04:10 - in hopefully some videos that I make
04:12 - today but we'll see about that so but
04:14 - the key file here actually is index.html
04:17 - that's the file that when you run your
04:20 - sketch that's the file that's actually
04:22 - being loaded into this page here and you
04:24 - know it just happened
04:25 - it's an uncaught reference error bubble
04:28 - is not defined why is the bubble not
04:30 - defined I've defined it right here well
04:33 - the problem is I made a new file called
04:36 - bubble Jas and I didn't tell index dot
04:40 - HTML to refer to that file so if I go
04:43 - over to index dot HTML you'll see here
04:45 - I'm a close the Preferences you can see
04:47 - here that there are all of these script
04:50 - tags I noticed another bug for the
04:53 - editor that I should file when you hit
04:54 - save as a project it should probably
04:57 - update the title of that project in the
04:59 - HTML file so I want to file that bug for
05:01 - me please
05:02 - p5.js editor on github but I think that
05:06 - that's what's happening but anyway the
05:07 - but I'm back to what I was talking about
05:08 - which is that you can see here's what
05:10 - this page is loading
05:11 - I need the p5.js library I need the Dom
05:14 - library I'm not actually using it but
05:16 - it's good it's there I the sound library
05:19 - I'm not actually using it but the editor
05:20 - is importing these three libraries by
05:22 - default as well as your code because of
05:25 - course you need your code to run well
05:26 - now my code is in both sketch JS and
05:29 - bubbled up yes so what I need to do is
05:32 - take this line hit command C for a copy
05:35 - and then reproduce that line again now I
05:38 - have two lines refering to sketch not
05:40 - chance and sketch yes twice but of
05:42 - course what I want now is the second one
05:44 - to refer to bubble Jas so any JavaScript
05:48 - files that you add you it's like you
05:51 - have just one long file the order
05:53 - doesn't really matter you know where you
05:55 - but but you can now keep your code
05:57 - organized if you have like your mouse
05:58 - handling press function in one file and
06:01 - your bubble constructor function another
06:03 - file and setup and draw in another file
06:05 - and might help you sort of like move
06:06 - back and forth and sort of see where you
06:08 - want to edit your code so now if I close
06:11 - this out and I go back to settings and
06:14 - hide the sidebar again now I'm back to
06:17 - just nice old happy land where I have my
06:20 - bubble tab bubbled is my sketch KS tab
06:23 - and I can run this sketch and there we
06:25 - go so as an exercise if you're doing
06:28 - exercises and following these videos you
06:30 - might take something you've previously
06:31 - written try to add a separate tab move
06:33 - your code around organize it and see if
06:35 - you can get the same exact thing too
06:37 - run and so what I'm going to do in the
06:38 - next video is I will start looking at
06:39 - some additional topics like how could I
06:41 - sort of pass a mousepressed event to
06:44 - each one of these objects so 6 minutes
06:47 - and 45 seconds one of my shortest I'm
06:50 - always happy when I make a short video I
06:51 - guess this is short I probably have done
06:52 - this in two minutes but we can we could
06:55 - drink we can all dream we have a dream
06:56 - of making a two-minute video that
06:58 - explains something nicely ok see you
07:00 - guys in the next video if you you know
07:03 - choose to watch which I understand if
07:04 - you don't ok goodbye
