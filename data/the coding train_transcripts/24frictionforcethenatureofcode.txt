00:03 - hello again okay before we get started
00:06 - with this video let's just take a moment
00:07 - to remind ourselves where we are we know
00:10 - about vectors we know the position or
00:12 - location of an object can be described
00:13 - as a vector how it moves over time is
00:16 - its velocity also a vector how the
00:19 - velocity changes over time also a vector
00:21 - called acceleration how do we compute
00:24 - acceleration force equals mass time
00:26 - acceleration acceleration equals force /
00:29 - Mass so the forces in the environment
00:31 - get accumulated into an object's
00:33 - acceleration which then changes velocity
00:35 - which then changes location that's where
00:38 - we are so this begs the question how do
00:42 - we calculate forces and what we've seen
00:44 - up until now is just making up numbers
00:48 - um let's just remind ourselves for a
00:49 - second right if we look at this example
00:51 - oh there's a force gravity 0 comma 0.3
00:55 - fantastic there's another force wind 2
00:58 - comma 0 these are forces we've just
01:00 - completely made them up however real
01:03 - forces exist in the real world uh and
01:07 - have uh actual formulas that you could
01:10 - find in textbooks I don't have a prop to
01:12 - just grab but um you find a textbook
01:14 - open it up and you will find formulas in
01:16 - it
01:17 - so the goal of this video is to say take
01:21 - a deep breath and say we could make up
01:23 - forces and that's perfectly great we can
01:26 - also try to model real world forces by
01:29 - looking at the formula trying to
01:31 - understand the formula and translating
01:33 - that formula into practical processing
01:35 - code or whatever environment you may be
01:37 - choosing to program in so the in this
01:40 - video we're going to look at um two case
01:43 - studies we're going to look at friction
01:45 - and what we'll call drag or a fluid or
01:48 - air resistance we're going to look at
01:50 - these forces that slow down an object
01:52 - when it's in motion with friction two
01:54 - surfaces coming in contact with each
01:56 - other or uh air resistance you can think
01:58 - of as something moving through the air
02:00 - and experiencing a resistance force from
02:02 - you know I don't know the air there's
02:03 - stuff there it blocks your way not too
02:06 - badly but anyway uh okay so let's talk
02:10 - about friction first so uh you're
02:13 - probably watching this in the summer on
02:15 - a beach somewhere like drinking a My
02:17 - Thai is that a drink I don't know some
02:19 - sort of Glorious fruity beverage but in
02:22 - New York City where it is right now it
02:24 - just snowed and this was a weekend where
02:26 - uh lots of kids were out sledding so
02:27 - let's think about a sledding scenario
02:30 - just for a moment we have a
02:32 - hill and we have a sled and a small
02:37 - child on the
02:39 - sled a little bit too much information
02:41 - for this and we have this object moving
02:44 - with a velocity so this object has a
02:47 - velocity Vector it's also
02:50 - experiencing a gravitational force we
02:53 - can say that's the force of
02:55 - gravity and What We Gather what we're
02:59 - here today to discuss is the fact that
03:02 - this sled is also experiencing friction
03:05 - the sled is in contact with the ice or
03:07 - the snow those two surfaces in contact
03:10 - there is a friction force and a friction
03:12 - Force moves is pushes the object in the
03:16 - opposite direction of its velocity that
03:17 - makes sense all right um uh friction is
03:22 - a force in the opposite direction of the
03:23 - way that you're moving if I could do the
03:25 - moonwalk here which I can't there would
03:28 - be some sort of friction in the opposite
03:29 - direction of the moonwalk right okay so
03:32 - can't believe I just did the moonwalk
03:34 - okay um now there's something else going
03:36 - on in this V in this video no this is
03:38 - this is a video this is a diagram and
03:40 - this diagram something called the normal
03:42 - force so you might remember Newton's
03:44 - third law which
03:46 - states for every option there's an equal
03:49 - and opposite reaction or maybe better
03:50 - stated as forces always occur in pairs
03:53 - so just as um I am exerting a force down
03:58 - onto the floor because gravity is
04:00 - pushing me down fortunately I'm not
04:02 - going through the floor there is a force
04:04 - pushing me back up these two forces
04:06 - acting in pairs so there is also a nor
04:08 - something called a normal
04:11 - force this would be called the normal
04:14 - which has to do with the force of
04:15 - gravity of force kind of keeping the
04:17 - sled from just going through this hill
04:20 - of
04:21 - snow okay so there's lots of stuff at
04:23 - play in this diagram and what I'm here
04:26 - to look at what we're here me you
04:28 - whoever there's nobody here it's just
04:31 - me okay what we're here to look at is
04:33 - what is the formula for the force of
04:37 - friction it equals -1 times something
04:42 - called mu if I wrote that correctly
04:45 - times the normal force that is the
04:48 - magnitude of that normal force so maybe
04:50 - I should by the way did we ever say this
04:53 - I think we had a video All About vector
04:55 - magnitude and I never bothered to
04:57 - mention that in Vector notation this is
05:00 - typically how we write a vector and when
05:02 - we want to talk about the length of that
05:04 - Vector we sometimes will write it as the
05:06 - vector with these uh vertical lines so
05:09 - the magnitude of the normal force
05:13 - times the velocity
05:16 - Vector
05:17 - so this is a
05:20 - Formula it's not that bad of a formula
05:23 - but what happens often when you see a
05:26 - formula is you look at it and you think
05:29 - hey I just make up the numbers in
05:31 - processing which is fine but in this
05:33 - case what we want what we want to do in
05:35 - this video is say we see am I recording
05:37 - I'm recording we see this formula and
05:41 - what what we want to do is unpack and
05:43 - find what are the actual parts of the
05:45 - formula that we really need can we boil
05:46 - it down right we if we were doing a
05:49 - really
05:50 - scientific uh simulation we would have
05:53 - to include all of these elements but
05:54 - what I want to look at Now is really
05:56 - what is friction and can we simplify
05:58 - this formula because after all what do
06:01 - we have on the screen like if we want to
06:03 - apply
06:04 - friction friction to this sketch there's
06:07 - just this ball bouncing so where's the
06:09 - normal force where's the velocity where
06:13 - maybe we can make this a little bit
06:15 - simpler okay so let's look at this for
06:17 - in a couple of ways one let's understand
06:19 - something about how we calculate
06:21 - forces when we know that a for a
06:25 - vector okay a force is a vector we know
06:27 - that a force is a vector so in our
06:31 - code we're going to have to do something
06:33 - like say p Vector
06:37 - friction equals and actually that should
06:40 - probably go down here that's going to be
06:41 - at the end we're going to do some
06:42 - calculations at the end we're going to
06:44 - end up with a vector that is friction
06:46 - but what is a vector an entity with
06:49 - magnitude and Direction so looking at
06:52 - this formula we have to ask ourselves
06:54 - what is the magnitude of friction how
06:57 - big is the friction force and
07:00 - what is the direction what is the
07:02 - direction of friction so from our
07:04 - diagram and how we described it we know
07:07 - that friction points in the opposite
07:09 - direction of velocity friction doesn't
07:11 - cause you to speed up it's a force
07:12 - against the way that you're
07:14 - moving thus the
07:16 - moonwalk anyway um
07:19 - so where in this formula is embedded the
07:23 - direction of friction and ah I messed
07:29 - something
07:30 - up the formula this is why sometimes
07:33 - it's good to like practice or plan these
07:36 - videos but right now I'm just kind of I
07:37 - feel very relaxed this morning and we're
07:39 - just kind of going going slowly we're
07:40 - going to go more slowly someone
07:42 - mentioned to me that these videos go a
07:43 - little bit fast try to go a little more
07:45 - slowly in this one okay what I meant to
07:47 - write here is the velocity unit Vector
07:52 - the normalized version of the Velocity
07:55 - Vector velocity unit vector and by the
07:57 - way talking about vector VOR syntax we
08:01 - said that ah this is how we say the
08:03 - magnitude of a vector v this is often
08:05 - how we write a unit vector v v with a
08:08 - carrot on top unit Vector a vector of
08:11 - length one the velocity Vector
08:13 - normalized to length one I said that
08:16 - eight times but you know that's me
08:18 - trying to go a little more slowly okay
08:21 - so what where were we we want to know
08:24 - the direction so we need to know the
08:26 - direction of this Vector d
08:32 - Direction whatever spelling is not my
08:34 - forte we need to know the direction of
08:36 - this Vector what is that is that
08:38 - embedded into this formula somewhere in
08:40 - fact yes it is it is in it is it is in
08:43 - two places velocity is a vector with a
08:46 - unit Vector with Direction negative 1
08:48 - the opposite direction of velocity so we
08:50 - can see in that formula that -1 * the
08:53 - velocity unit Vector that's the object's
08:56 - that's I'm Excuse me the Force's
08:57 - Direction so we're going to get the
08:59 - forces's direction from
09:01 - there and if we think back to our
09:03 - processing code what could that mean
09:05 - friction
09:07 - equals
09:10 - velocity. getet can you can you read
09:12 - that kind of getting up too high I have
09:14 - to write a little lower velocity got get
09:20 - friction multiply
09:23 - oh forgot a
09:26 - step
09:27 - friction normalize
09:35 - friction
09:37 - multiply ne1 see so we see this formula
09:42 - we understand that one of the things
09:44 - about this formula we need is the
09:45 - direction of the vector the direction of
09:47 - the vector is the negative and the
09:49 - velocity unit vector and now we can
09:51 - rewrite that in processing code how what
09:53 - does that mean we say hey give me a copy
09:56 - of the Velocity this is very important
09:58 - this is something we've referred to
09:59 - before when we when we when when we're
10:01 - dealing with vectors right we don't want
10:03 - the object's actual velocity Vector
10:06 - because if we start manipulating the
10:07 - object's velocity Vector we've messed up
10:09 - how that object is moving we just want
10:11 - temporarily we're saying hey excuse me
10:14 - object I really hate to bother you and
10:16 - ask you but could I please have a copy
10:18 - of your velocity Vector because I need
10:20 - it to calculate the force of friction I
10:21 - don't want to mess with your velocity
10:23 - just give me a copy of it so we have the
10:25 - copy of and get a copy of a vector.
10:27 - getet so we have a copy of the velocity
10:29 - Vector then we normalize it right
10:32 - because in our formula it's the um it's
10:35 - the unit Vector velocity so once we have
10:37 - a copy of the Velocity Vector we can
10:38 - normalize it and then we can multiply it
10:40 - by negative 1 so it's moving in the
10:43 - opposite direction I was checking to see
10:45 - the time and I never press the timer so
10:47 - this video is going on for some amount
10:48 - of time I'm not sure about it okay so
10:52 - now we have the direction of friction we
10:54 - have a normalized vector in the correct
10:56 - direction now a vector is an entity with
10:59 - dire dire and magnitude what do we need
11:02 - next magnitude so this is where it gets
11:06 - kind of
11:07 - interesting what are the components of
11:09 - this Vector this force of this formula
11:12 - what are the components of this formula
11:14 - that give us the frictions magnitude
11:16 - they are
11:18 - mu and the magnitude of the normal
11:23 - force okay
11:25 - so someone's trying to get in everything
11:29 - could be okay they went away okay um so
11:33 - the magnitude so this is where things
11:35 - get a little tricky not really tricky
11:37 - actually this is where we decide let's
11:38 - not make things tricky let's make life
11:40 - easy on ourselves the normal force well
11:43 - there's probably trigonometry involved
11:45 - here there's a force pointing down but
11:47 - it's going on a slope and H you know the
11:50 - normal force so you know what's the mass
11:51 - of the sled and you know there all sorts
11:54 - of questions we could ask here but we
11:56 - want to live in a simple world right now
11:59 - we want to live in a simple world where
12:00 - it's just like this little ball bouncing
12:02 - you know what's the normal force the
12:03 - normal force I guess technically would
12:05 - be like pushing out from behind the
12:07 - screen against this circle but there's
12:09 - no screen I mean the screen the circle
12:10 - it's just
12:11 - pixels so what we can really say here is
12:14 - the normal force which is some component
12:16 - of the force of gravity and you know
12:18 - it's a constant and I have an even
12:20 - better
12:21 - idea it equals
12:24 - one normal force in our world normal
12:27 - force always equals one now now what's
12:29 - mu mu is the
12:33 - coefficient you can't read that at all
12:35 - of I'll rest start writing the
12:36 - coefficient of friction I got to get
12:38 - better at this board thing okay mu is
12:40 - the coefficient of friction so what
12:43 - might be some different coefficients of
12:44 - friction well the coefficient of
12:46 - friction is going to determine how
12:48 - strong that friction is is it two blocks
12:51 - of ice is it two is it sandpaper and uh
12:55 - you know a textbook Is It Michael
12:57 - Jackson and the moonwalk like what is
12:59 - the sort of what what kind of objects
13:01 - are coming into contact so if there if
13:04 - sandpaper is going to have a high
13:06 - coefficient of friction there's a lot of
13:07 - friction going along sandpaper ice is
13:09 - going to have a very low coefficient of
13:11 - friction it's very slippery you can just
13:13 - slide right on it so we could probably I
13:16 - don't know go out into the field and do
13:18 - some tests and come up with some numbers
13:21 - but what we are really doing here in
13:22 - processing is saying there's going to be
13:24 - a lot of friction or there's going to be
13:26 - a little friction the normal force uh
13:29 - the normal force affects that too right
13:31 - a really massive object pushing down a
13:33 - lot and with a big normal force pushing
13:35 - up is going to have more friction than a
13:37 - very light thing but you know later
13:39 - we'll look at Mass there's all sorts of
13:41 - things we can um we could add to this to
13:44 - make it more complicated but for right
13:45 - now this is what we can do with formulas
13:47 - we can really simplify them we can say
13:49 - these are constants let's make them up
13:51 - as
13:52 - constants let's make up a variable
13:55 - called C let's say it's 0.01 that's myod
13:59 - coefficient of friction and then let's
14:02 - say friction multiply by that
14:06 - coefficient
14:08 - now check we're done ah okay we're done
14:13 - we looked at a diagram we looked at the
14:16 - formula we figured out what are the
14:17 - parts of the formula for
14:19 - direction velocity in the normalized in
14:22 - the other direction what are the
14:24 - components for the magnitude some
14:25 - constants let's make up a constant to
14:27 - either have the friction weak are strong
14:30 - and you know we could control this with
14:31 - a slider a variable it could change
14:33 - different objects could have different
14:35 - coefficients of friction and then we
14:37 - multiply we scale that Vector
14:38 - accordingly and then what do we do next
14:41 - apply
14:43 - Force so I'm going to uh now that we've
14:46 - done this let's look at actually
14:48 - applying it in our code and I'll give
14:49 - you an
14:51 - exercise uh okay here we are over here
14:54 - so if you recall um this particular
14:57 - example had has gravity and wind right
15:01 - and we're applying gravity always and
15:03 - we're only applying wind when I click
15:05 - the mouse now you can see the wind is
15:06 - being applied so let's let's just change
15:08 - a couple things one thing is let's just
15:10 - say let's apply gravity and wind
15:16 - always
15:18 - and I'm like okay and now we're going to
15:23 - say let's apply friction so right here
15:27 - we're going to do everything we did on
15:29 - the board to apply friction to this
15:31 - object okay so what do we need to do
15:34 - first the direction of the vector we did
15:36 - this already friction equals the
15:39 - movers velocity. getet so we've got a
15:43 - copy now of the object's velocity Vector
15:46 - now we want to normalize
15:49 - it and multiply it by negative 1 great
15:53 - and then what do we do coefficient of
15:54 - friction oh this is so easy 0.1
15:59 - scale
16:01 - it things are falling apart and then you
16:04 - know what look at this uh sorry I don't
16:06 - want a trip I'm coming right back hello
16:09 - again um I really am going slow I think
16:11 - I'm going slowly in this video I feel a
16:12 - little like lethargic today um look how
16:15 - we're multiplying by negative 1 and then
16:17 - we're multiplying by this coefficient
16:18 - it's kind of unnecessary let's just make
16:20 - the coefficient a negative
16:24 - number and now we've got m. apply Force
16:29 - C uh not C sorry okay don't this pen
16:33 - cannot sit over here I have a new Podium
16:35 - thing and it's kind
16:37 - of H now we're going to apply the
16:39 - friction Force okay so we get the
16:42 - velocity we normalize it we reverse its
16:44 - direction and scale it according to some
16:46 - magnitude and then we apply it if we run
16:48 - this look friction can you tell that
16:51 - there's friction kind of hard to tell
16:53 - right so let's just let's sort of like
16:55 - look at this and make this a little bit
16:56 - more let's let's make this a little more
16:58 - apparent
16:59 - let's only apply apply the friction when
17:02 - we are pressing the
17:03 - mouse and let's actually um let's take
17:07 - out the
17:09 - uh wind for a moment and I think also
17:12 - this is a little bit silly but if I have
17:13 - the Mover start at the top of the
17:18 - screen okay so there is now our ball
17:22 - that is falling up and down up and
17:25 - down and now when I click the mouse
17:28 - we're going to apply friction let's
17:31 - see not not much of a change a little
17:35 - change let's make the friction the nice
17:37 - thing about we've done is maybe the
17:39 - friction needs to be a lot stronger and
17:41 - by the way the Mover has a random Mass
17:44 - so let's give it a not so Random Mass
17:47 - okay oh and it has a random
17:49 - location uh let's give it I just want to
17:51 - make it consistent for a second so we
17:53 - can kind of look at this should have
17:54 - done this in advance okay ready and now
17:56 - let's apply some friction
17:59 - you can see now that friction is causing
18:01 - it to kind of like slow down and stop
18:03 - right it's actually the weird thing
18:04 - about this this is a terrible
18:06 - demonstration right because what's
18:08 - really good like this this we just
18:10 - simulated friction which would be as if
18:12 - it's like sliding along the the the the
18:15 - processing window itself but really what
18:17 - we should be simulating with something
18:18 - falling is air resistance so you know
18:22 - maybe we there there's so many so here's
18:24 - the thing what we did in this video and
18:28 - I know I I Pro this this could be this
18:32 - this isn't the best video we've ever
18:34 - made I've ever made let's let's just be
18:35 - honest here but it's it's going to do
18:38 - for right now what we did in this video
18:39 - is we figured out how to put this
18:42 - friction formula into a processing
18:44 - sketch now the question is for you and
18:47 - maybe what you could do as an exercise
18:48 - is design a scenario where this could
18:50 - actually make sense what if you had a
18:53 - think of a game like a platform Style
18:55 - game where something is moving along a
18:57 - surface and they're actually would be
18:59 - friction along that surface maybe it
19:01 - depending on like different parts of it
19:02 - encounters something with friction so um
19:05 - uh let me actually describe to you what
19:07 - I mean here so let's just say as an
19:14 - exercise here's your processing
19:17 - window think of there being this kind of
19:21 - ground and you have objects moving along
19:24 - that ground um what if it comes into
19:28 - different contact with different patches
19:30 - when it reaches this patch this is
19:32 - perhaps like mud or quicksand or
19:34 - sandpaper something really rough the
19:36 - rest of this is like ice over here could
19:38 - you create this sort of variable
19:40 - friction as something is moving along so
19:42 - this might be a nice scenario for you to
19:45 - try to build with friction and what
19:46 - we're actually going to do in the next
19:48 - video is create an appropriate Force for
19:51 - something that's falling we're going to
19:52 - look at air resistance what air
19:53 - resistance is very similar to friction
19:56 - but air fluid resistance but it's quite
19:57 - it's actually a different formula and it
19:59 - operates differently so that's what
20:00 - we're going to look at in the next
20:02 - video okay so hopefully this uh I don't
20:05 - know added something to your life you
20:07 - didn't just waste the last I've know for
20:09 - all I know this has been like 45 minutes
20:11 - um but it's probably more like 10
20:13 - minutes and um see if you could create
20:15 - this scenario I I send me an email if I
20:17 - haven't made this example and added it
20:18 - to the nature of code get repository
20:20 - because I don't have an example that
20:21 - does this but I think it would make
20:22 - sense and um you know we'll be in touch
20:26 - somehow someday you you know there'll be
20:28 - little seats here and you can sit
20:30 - probably not maybe okay I I got to press
20:32 - a button to end this video
