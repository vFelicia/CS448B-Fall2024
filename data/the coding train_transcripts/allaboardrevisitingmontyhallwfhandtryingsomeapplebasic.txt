21:12 - other announcements one is a short one
21:14 - and one is kind of a long one both of
21:16 - these are repeating things that i talked
21:17 - about on tuesday's very brief stream
21:20 - that i did before the itp ima
21:23 - semester show
21:25 - so
21:26 - um
21:28 - now
21:29 - i am going to close oh no i have to have
21:31 - this open but i'll just have it in the
21:34 - background
21:35 - um let me come over here
21:38 - and let me
21:41 - [Laughter]
21:43 - uh simon is here you know it's hard
21:45 - simon you got to wake up early in the
21:46 - morning now that you're
21:48 - in the same time zone as me i believe
21:50 - uh everyone say hi to simon in the chat
21:52 - of course just joining us
21:54 - uh um simon we talked about p5 access
21:57 - day um which maybe i'll see you there
21:59 - tomorrow if you're free but no worries
22:01 - if you're not
22:02 - basically this is this live stream is
22:04 - just a one-on-one where i can like talk
22:06 - to simon briefly
22:08 - all right what was i what was that ah
22:10 - let me do my announcements so
22:13 - um
22:14 - i mentioned this
22:16 - uh
22:16 - speaking of simon this is very funny
22:18 - timing p c d
22:20 - c p h so and back to processing i just
22:24 - want to again mention that processing
22:26 - community day in copenhagen is happening
22:28 - on june 4th 2022. i mean there's lots of
22:32 - community days and there's the io
22:33 - festival there's all sorts of things i
22:35 - can tell you about but the reason why
22:36 - i'm telling you about this one is
22:37 - because i'm going to be there i'm going
22:39 - to copenhagen i have a plane ticket i
22:41 - have a picture of me on the website
22:42 - where i was had a little bit less gray
22:44 - hair even though that was only like two
22:46 - years ago so i don't know what's been
22:47 - going on
22:48 - it's very stressful this last couple
22:50 - have you noticed
22:52 - what the world is like
22:55 - i have it way easier than probably most
22:58 - so i really don't need to complain but i
23:00 - i know everybody's having a a range of
23:02 - emotions and challenges in their lives
23:04 - these days so hopefully the coding train
23:06 - can bring something positive to you
23:08 - that's um that's one of my goals here
23:10 - with this whether it's educational or
23:11 - entertainment or just pure
23:15 - vibes
23:16 - is coding train a vibes show or a plot
23:19 - show i don't even know if it's a show
23:21 - but is it more vibes or is it more plot
23:23 - i think it might be more vibes
23:25 - at least so far right now
23:27 - all right uh so yeah so please
23:29 - especially if you are in the denmark
23:31 - area is that a thing people say the
23:33 - denmark we say like the tri-state area
23:35 - for here if you're in that the
23:37 - the new york city kind of i mean there's
23:39 - other states that are not just new york
23:41 - but the the denmark area the northern
23:43 - europe area um i would love to see you
23:45 - there i've heard from people on the
23:47 - twitters and on the youtube chat and the
23:49 - comments and all of that that they're
23:50 - planning to come that's really great
23:53 - not sure yet what i'll be doing there
23:55 - but some kind of coding stuff
23:57 - um copenhagen area okay i'm also
24:00 - thinking of going to stockholm
24:03 - maybe i heard that you could take this
24:04 - overnight boat from stockholm to
24:06 - helsinki and then visit health thank you
24:08 - for the day and then take the boat back
24:10 - i'm thinking about that i don't know why
24:11 - i should be just like talking about all
24:12 - my travel plans here but i've never
24:14 - really been around sort of northern
24:15 - european area so i'm excited to to do
24:18 - some visiting there okay

24:39 - um let me switch back over here so
24:41 - youtube
24:42 - let's let's talk for a minute about
24:44 - coding train and live streaming because
24:47 - first of all i'm
24:48 - i'm probably i'm not going to have any
24:49 - live streams pro actually no i have one
24:51 - that i'm going to try i'm going to try
24:52 - to do one next friday if all goes well
24:56 - one of the reasons why i am working on
24:59 - learning relearning applesoft basic is
25:01 - because i am filming something for the
25:04 - streaming service nebula that i've
25:05 - talked about um a short a class if you
25:09 - go to nebula uh if you start if you go
25:10 - to nebula.app and look at nebula classes
25:12 - you'll see there's a whole bunch there
25:13 - already
25:14 - and i'm doing a quick set of programming
25:16 - tutorials in basic so lots more to say
25:19 - about that then but i'm doing that next
25:20 - week so today i wanted to get my feet
25:22 - wet a little bit and tinker around in
25:24 - basic again um so that'll help me
25:26 - mentally prepare for next week but
25:27 - that's been a big project it's kind of
25:29 - slowed me down on my
25:30 - youtube production of stuff
25:33 - i have been streaming quite a bit on
25:34 - twitch
25:35 - um which i really enjoy
25:37 - i like a lot of the features and you
25:39 - know i can imagine doing some
25:40 - interesting things with the twitch api
25:42 - in the chat so i'm kind of waffling back
25:44 - and forth between the two platforms
25:46 - but uh here i am today
25:48 - on youtube
25:49 - um and one of the things that's been
25:51 - interesting to follow is how various
25:54 - features
25:55 - that appear on twitch then make their
25:57 - way over to youtube and i'm very excited
26:00 - that youtube seems to have added
26:01 - something
26:02 - called gifting memberships so
26:05 - i'm going to try this now i'm going to
26:07 - gift 20 memberships to the chat
26:10 - and let's just see what happens
26:13 - uh so 20 of you watching right now i
26:15 - apparently i i thought you could assign
26:17 - them
26:18 - not that i want to be in charge of
26:19 - picking who gets them but uh let's see
26:22 - how that goes so i just gifted
26:24 - 20 memberships um i'm looking at the
26:27 - chat now uh pink chris manning pink
26:30 - lemonade raj fun planet muhammad
26:35 - muchitaba this is this is so fun
26:39 - unless you think i'm being super
26:40 - generous that money just goes right back
26:42 - to me i mean not really because uh
26:45 - youtube i don't know what youtube takes
26:47 - i think 30 actually so if it was like
26:50 - i guess i guess that was like for 20
26:51 - memberships it was like a dollar and
26:54 - change
26:55 - each
26:56 - um
26:57 - but this is fun to see uh how this works
27:00 - anyway um so it's very confusing how you
27:03 - support the coding train for those of
27:05 - you first of all i'm just happy you're
27:06 - here watching
27:08 - i'm happy if you decided i'm not going
27:10 - to watch anymore because i'm doing other
27:11 - stuff with my life or if you want to
27:13 - just send me a tweet that says hey i
27:15 - like your videos or hey you know you
27:17 - know i don't really like your videos
27:19 - because you wave your arms around too
27:20 - much i mean i i i love getting those
27:22 - messages but you say it in a nice
27:24 - constructive feedback way i totally
27:26 - accept it
27:27 - anyway i'm saying um uh but i do
27:29 - appreciate that there are people who
27:31 - have the capacity and desire to support
27:33 - the coding train financially um
27:35 - i'm kind of running this whole
27:38 - ship
27:39 - as a train it's not a ship as a
27:42 - kind of break even small business
27:44 - basically
27:45 - and i have folks who are helping me with
27:47 - maintaining the website and
27:49 - the
27:50 - open source repositories and doing video
27:51 - editing and illustration and helping me
27:53 - with other projects and research so i'm
27:55 - trying to grow that to some extent
27:57 - although i don't i would like to just
27:59 - still be just like
28:01 - a small easy to manage simple things so
28:03 - anyway for those of you who are
28:04 - supporting in that way that's great
28:07 - one of the things that is confusing
28:09 - is there are
28:11 - many different avenues
28:13 - on which to
28:15 - find coding train content as well as
28:17 - support the coding train so this is all
28:20 - a big segue to talk about the new
28:23 - codingtrain website
28:30 - are you ready
28:32 - we're at my live stream on tuesday you
28:34 - already saw it so it's not too exciting
28:36 - um
28:37 - but um let's have a looksie at it
28:40 - um and talk about it for a bit okay
28:45 - so first of all the new coding train
28:47 - website is not actually live at
28:49 - thecodingtrain.com
28:50 - the plan is for it to have its official
28:52 - launch
28:53 - um in
28:56 - pcd uh
28:57 - um copenhagen so um that's kind of like
28:59 - the deadline i'm i'm going to move it
29:01 - over to the propertycodingtrain.com
29:03 - domain before then but right now you can
29:06 - preview it at
29:08 - uh codingtrain
29:12 - preview.netifly.app one of the things
29:14 - i've been learning which has been super
29:15 - fun is how to deploy a web application
29:17 - to netlify i would love to do some
29:18 - videos on that
29:20 - this is what it looks like
29:22 - this is the home page i'm going to go
29:23 - through pieces of it in a bit and i'm
29:25 - also going to show you how to
29:26 - download the repository and run it
29:28 - download the website and run it locally
29:30 - build it locally
29:32 - so one of the things that i just wanted
29:34 - to show you
29:36 - is here in the footer i'm trying to be
29:37 - better organized so these are sort of
29:40 - the current avenues that come with
29:42 - various different benefits and rewards
29:44 - in terms of youtube membership patreon
29:47 - github sponsorship a twitch subscription
29:49 - and the nature of code book so um but
29:51 - this is not the primary thing i wanted
29:52 - to talk about about the website
29:54 - so um
29:57 - i one of the things i'm planning to do
29:59 - this will probably happen at the very
30:00 - beginning of june is i'm going to do
30:03 - some really lengthy i don't want to say
30:05 - all day but like
30:07 - several hour live streams on twitch
30:10 - probably um where i'll be working on
30:13 - updating the website and asking for
30:15 - people to help
30:17 - um so um this is just a little taste of
30:20 - that because i don't want to spend the
30:22 - whole stream like here i am i'm going to
30:24 - like build a page for the website that
30:26 - needs that's not there right now but i
30:28 - want to show you so that any of you who
30:30 - are interested could get started
30:31 - tinkering with it contributing to it and
30:35 - the main thing i want to show you is how
30:36 - you can add your own
30:38 - uh versions of the different coding
30:40 - examples that are in my videos to the
30:42 - website itself i'm trying to keep my eye
30:44 - on the chat um i don't know where to
30:47 - look at it here okay hydro pn thank you
30:50 - so much so all of you who are just like
30:52 - suddenly gifted this membership so i'm
30:54 - sorry for the random number generator
30:56 - i'll maybe i'll do another one a little
30:57 - bit
30:58 - um
30:59 - um but um you should the main thing for
31:02 - you to do is
31:04 - link your um
31:07 - link your
31:10 - oh yes link your youtube and discord
31:12 - accounts then go to the coding trained
31:15 - discord which you can get to at
31:17 - thecodingtrain.com discord and um
31:21 - there you will have access to some of
31:23 - the supporter member channels and yeah i
31:25 - can answer your questions there and i
31:27 - guess it'll go away i guess i just
31:28 - gifted you one month and then
31:31 - when that's over it'll go away unless
31:33 - you choose to continue it i don't know
31:34 - maybe that's uh i don't i actually don't
31:36 - know how this works i'm just
31:37 - experimenting with it twitch has had
31:38 - this kind of gift subscription thing
31:40 - forever so
31:42 - um
31:43 - okay
31:44 - uh
31:45 - let's see oh a dark mode feature for the
31:47 - website so feel free to file an issue
31:49 - for that um we can have that discussion
31:52 - um
31:53 - uh you know the the the vibe of the
31:55 - coding train is bright and cheery but oh
31:58 - one of the things actually that's one of
31:59 - the things we're talking about doing is
32:01 - having the scene change the time of day
32:04 - based on the time of day but um i see
32:06 - that it's already 11 30. i want to make
32:08 - sure that i'm
32:09 - moving into um
32:12 - moving into some of the other stuff i
32:14 - want to do today soon enough so let's
32:16 - take a look at just a quick
32:18 - lesson i know lessons probably the wrong
32:20 - word a quick demonstration of how you
32:23 - can get your hands into the website
32:25 - locally on your computer okay
32:28 - so this is the github repo it is at oh
32:31 - and unchained just joined
32:34 - that's like a genuine legitimate
32:37 - membership joining
32:40 - oh
32:42 - [Music]
32:53 - you have just won
32:54 - your very own membership to the coding
32:56 - range you didn't really win it because
32:57 - you you paid for it and then google took
33:01 - a large portion of that and then the
33:02 - rest at some point will
33:04 - anyway thank you so much i really
33:05 - appreciate your support
33:07 - um
33:08 - okay uh
33:10 - so no fave icon yet yeah file these as
33:13 - issues people we want to hear from you
33:16 - so okay so what i'm going to do here now
33:19 - first of all if you want if you want to
33:21 - just download everything that has to do
33:23 - with the website you can just go right
33:25 - here onto github and click download zip
33:29 - there are
33:30 - ways for you to contribute and edit the
33:33 - website by
33:34 - going through the github repository the
33:37 - git repository on github itself clicking
33:40 - edit creating a pull request these are
33:42 - things i would really love to remake my
33:44 - whole git and github tutorial series
33:46 - maybe it actually makes sense for me to
33:47 - do that using the coding train website
33:49 - if i'm
33:51 - thinking about this right now it's kind
33:52 - of an interesting idea but um
33:55 - i want to just look at what is a bit
33:57 - more of a higher degree of difficulty uh
33:59 - element which is to uh and especially if
34:02 - anybody is sort of has a lot of
34:03 - experience with web development out
34:04 - there who wants to sort of
34:06 - see how the website works and think
34:08 - about how they might want to contribute
34:09 - to it
34:10 - this is what you'll need to do so i'm
34:12 - going to go here under uh code and um i
34:16 - should probably start using this github
34:17 - command line
34:19 - and by the way i have a million people
34:21 - to thank about this website i'll have to
34:22 - come back and do that later
34:24 - because i'm not really prepared i don't
34:26 - want to forget anyone today but um
34:28 - uh so apologies for not giving like sort
34:31 - of full credit of course if you just go
34:32 - through the repo and look at the history
34:34 - you'll see all the wonderful people
34:35 - working on the website so it is there
34:37 - and findable um so i am going to click
34:41 - uh copied um
34:43 - and i am going to uh
34:47 - uh go over here and go to the desktop
34:50 - um so i'm in item any sort of terminal
34:53 - or console access will do here i am
34:56 - going to say
34:58 - git
34:58 - clone
35:00 - and then i'm going to paste the url for
35:01 - the repository
35:03 - which should bring the entire website uh
35:05 - down to my computer
35:07 - uh it looks like it's finished i'm going
35:09 - to go and just look in the finder now
35:12 - here
35:13 - and we can see so let's just look at
35:14 - what's here first of all for a second
35:17 - so there's a couple things that are
35:18 - interesting about this one is
35:21 - there is no website
35:23 - in the way that you're viewing it
35:26 - here
35:27 - what is in all these folders is the raw
35:30 - data and design materials for the
35:32 - website so i have to build the website
35:35 - but what is important for me to try to
35:38 - briefly explain and talk about and i
35:41 - think this is not my area of expertise
35:44 - or my forte here
35:45 - but this is what's known as a statically
35:49 - built
35:50 - website uh unchained thank you unchained
35:53 - that's that's i appreciate that uh
35:55 - clarification on the name pronunciation
35:58 - um
35:59 - so what i mean by that is when you're
36:02 - looking at the website you're looking at
36:04 - a flat
36:05 - rendered html page that's loading images
36:08 - and animations and embedding all sorts
36:10 - of other things there's no engine that
36:12 - is live rendering that is that is
36:15 - that is um
36:17 - i want to say like generating the page
36:19 - that's pulling from a database i wanted
36:22 - the website and this is something that
36:23 - we talked a lot about in the development
36:25 - design systems international is the
36:27 - creative
36:28 - firm that um has done
36:30 - designed this website and worked with me
36:32 - to build it um
36:35 - so i wanted the website to be something
36:37 - that you could just grab
36:40 - and run locally that you could edit
36:42 - directly on github you don't need to
36:44 - have some kind of
36:46 - secret keys environment variables and a
36:49 - dummy database and the website is just
36:52 - everything for the website is all here
36:54 - in all these folders and if i go under
36:57 - content you'll start to see there's
36:58 - pages there's templates there's tracks
37:01 - there's videos and if you go in there
37:02 - you can start to see like oh there's
37:04 - something for every there's a folder for
37:06 - every coding challenge if i go into this
37:08 - one but suddenly aha
37:10 - this doesn't look like
37:13 - a web page that's not an html file
37:16 - that's a json file if i were to now open
37:18 - this up
37:22 - in a code editor like visual studio code
37:26 - and i were to go to content pages
37:29 - uh challenges no no uh
37:32 - where videos
37:34 - challenges and go to this one i don't
37:36 - know which ones and go here we would see
37:38 - oh look object oriented fractal trees
37:42 - oh the description is blank let's we're
37:44 - going to do something about that right
37:45 - now there's a date there's a video id
37:47 - there's some languages there's some
37:49 - topics there's links to the code
37:51 - examples this is all json
37:54 - but when i go to the website if i were
37:56 - to go under
37:57 - videos tracks no
38:00 - videos challenges
38:02 - and i were to go to which one was i
38:04 - looking at
38:06 - object-oriented fractal trees
38:09 - here it is this looks like a webpage
38:11 - with you know a navigation bar the video
38:14 - links to the code examples
38:16 - the description is empty uh this other
38:19 - thing about a passenger showcase thing
38:21 - so where is all of that and how does
38:23 - that happen
38:26 - this website is built with a build
38:29 - system
38:30 - actually it's it's something called
38:32 - gatsby
38:33 - which i don't know
38:35 - uh gatsby let's let's look up what
38:36 - gatsby is build gatsby static sites with
38:40 - react and
38:41 - no no that's a udemy course
38:43 - that's an
38:44 - ad story blog this is an ad give me this
38:48 - thing yeah
38:49 - so this is what gatsby is
38:51 - it is essentially an engine that is able
38:54 - to take all of the raw materials and
38:57 - generate the website but rather than do
38:59 - that on the fly the moment when a page
39:02 - is requested it does that anytime the
39:05 - developers of the website make a change
39:07 - and rebuild it
39:09 - so i can
39:11 - i can now do that process so i have all
39:14 - of the data
39:15 - here
39:16 - on my computer in this folder all the
39:19 - data for the website and if i want to
39:22 - start to build the website look at it
39:25 - locally make changes to it and then send
39:27 - those changes back to the actual website
39:29 - i can do that by issuing some node
39:32 - commands
39:33 - to
39:34 - install whatever package dependencies i
39:36 - need to build the website to build to
39:40 - test to run tests on the website all
39:42 - those kinds of things so the first one
39:44 - i'm going to want to do is type npm
39:46 - install now if the word node is
39:48 - completely unfamiliar to you
39:50 - um you know i might have some tutorials
39:53 - that you could watch and i wish i could
39:54 - just sort of like bring them up right
39:55 - now oh if only i had a website that
39:57 - organized everything well i'd be able to
39:58 - go right to the page where my node
40:00 - tutorials are coming soon
40:02 - but node.js is a javascript framework
40:05 - for
40:06 - um
40:07 - you know i want to say server-side
40:09 - coding but it's so much more i guess
40:10 - it's a runtime it's a way of like
40:12 - executing javascript just on any
40:14 - computer without a browser context so
40:16 - javascript is most commonly found as
40:19 - code running inside a web browser but
40:20 - you can run it anywhere so i want to run
40:22 - some javascript code right here on my
40:25 - computer inside of this folder well i
40:27 - need to make sure if i'm going to run
40:29 - all the scripts that go with the website
40:31 - i need to install all the packages npm
40:34 - node package manager so i'm going to hit
40:36 - enter there
40:37 - and we're going to run all of this
40:41 - and i'll talk about people are asking
40:42 - about how maybe i'll talk about the
40:44 - deployment process i'll get to that
40:47 - how that gets deployed then so it's
40:49 - installing a bunch of things
40:54 - so by the way to contribute to the
40:55 - website you don't have to know any
40:57 - programming and you don't have to know
40:59 - anything
41:00 - about git i mean
41:02 - you have to be willing to try these
41:04 - things but i'm looking for though all of
41:06 - you who have never done any of this
41:08 - before to contribute to the website let
41:10 - it be a friendly welcoming place for you
41:13 - to
41:14 - do your first open source contribution
41:16 - um p5 and processing a lot of the other
41:18 - projects i'm involved with are those
41:19 - kind of places too but the website
41:20 - that's really an invitation i'm really
41:22 - inviting you like i want you to be in
41:25 - there like i've never tried this before
41:27 - can i figure it out if you can't we've
41:29 - done something wrong on our end right
41:30 - we've got to fix that
41:36 - wow that was a lot of node packages to
41:38 - install
41:40 - um all right and i realize you probably
41:41 - can't see the bottom here because my
41:43 - desk is so now that i've done npm
41:45 - install
41:46 - one thing i want to just look at briefly
41:48 - is
41:50 - an important file to look at is this
41:53 - package.json file so any node project
41:56 - the package.json file is like a
41:59 - configuration file it is a file that
42:01 - tells you all about the project
42:03 - and if i go here it'll say things like
42:05 - oh it's the coding train and it's
42:07 - version one
42:08 - it's not actually private anymore it was
42:10 - private there's a description oh roon
42:12 - matson
42:14 - is the author of the coding trade
42:15 - website he's the one who started this
42:16 - project uh a designer uh one of the
42:19 - founders of dsi but what i'm really
42:21 - looking for these are all the
42:22 - dependencies right all of these things
42:24 - that it's using you know we could get
42:26 - into any of these individually
42:28 - but what i wanted to show you are these
42:30 - scripts
42:32 - so this is important
42:35 - uh if i want to build the website serve
42:38 - the website clean the build which is
42:40 - something i'll get to test the website
42:43 - or work on
42:44 - developing the website i can run any of
42:47 - these commands
42:48 - update your packages you have three
42:50 - criticals
42:53 - all right
42:55 - what uh what do i do npm audit maybe
42:59 - or update or something
43:01 - audit fix
43:04 - um
43:08 - i don't know i don't know what i'm doing
43:09 - anymore let's write npm audit fix so one
43:12 - of the things about these node packages
43:14 - is they're constantly being updated and
43:16 - especially some of the older ones can
43:17 - have you know security vulnerabilities
43:19 - in them
43:20 - um
43:22 - so i think i'm gonna have to look at
43:23 - this later but there's also something
43:25 - that was telling me to like
43:27 - update my npm or something i'm just
43:28 - going to run npm install again
43:33 - wasn't it telling me
43:36 - uh
43:37 - oh npm fun
43:39 - i don't know i don't know i'm gonna deal
43:41 - with this later we're gonna live with
43:42 - the vulnerabilities
43:44 - hi kay
43:45 - um
43:47 - so
43:49 - what was i looking for
43:51 - i was on a on a path here i had done yes
43:55 - i got distracted by the chat though
43:56 - thank you for that important message
43:58 - um so the one that i want to look at
44:01 - right now is
44:04 - uh let's try npm so these are just
44:06 - aliases the actual command that we're
44:08 - running is like gatsby serve or gatsby
44:10 - build build but these are things like i
44:12 - can make this uh called unicorn and then
44:16 - i could say
44:17 - npm run unicorn
44:20 - and that's going to run the development
44:22 - command
44:24 - um but i i there's no reason for me to
44:26 - make that change so let me go back and
44:29 - call it dev and let me just say npm run
44:31 - dev so this is what i want to do first
44:33 - so what this is actually doing is it's
44:35 - building the website it's a little bit
44:37 - different than npm build because what
44:39 - it's doing is it's building the website
44:42 - and hosting the website and then
44:45 - keeping its eye on all of the files so
44:48 - if i were to change any file it's going
44:50 - to quickly rebuild that page and this is
44:52 - what you want to do while you're
44:53 - developing it right when you build the
44:55 - website it's a one-time operation
44:57 - i build the website there it is i change
44:59 - the json file it's not going to be a new
45:00 - it's not going to update until i rebuild
45:02 - npm run dev is like we're going to be
45:05 - building it continuously in the
45:06 - background while you're working on it
45:08 - it's inefficient you would never want
45:09 - that in production so to speak like oh
45:12 - it's just constantly rebuilding but
45:13 - while you're working on it makes sense
45:15 - so
45:16 - i got one problem zero errors one
45:18 - warning so
45:19 - um
45:20 - and now we see that the website is now
45:23 - running locally so i am able to go to
45:26 - um this particular url localhost at this
45:29 - port
45:30 - and i'm just to type it in manually
45:32 - although i could click on that localhost
45:34 - localhost
45:36 - 8000
45:38 - and we see there's the website looks
45:40 - just like the website that is currently
45:44 - did i lose it where is it oh yeah it's
45:46 - here the website that is currently um on
45:49 - deploy to netlify right now but we can
45:52 - do things like
45:54 - let's go back to that file
45:57 - uh videos
45:59 - challenges object-oriented
46:02 - so this has no description
46:05 - so what i would like to do here is let's
46:08 - find this video
46:10 - object-oriented
46:12 - [Music]
46:15 - tree
46:19 - so this is at the page for it on the old
46:20 - website which is fine so i'm actually
46:22 - going to take this description here from
46:24 - the old website
46:26 - i'm going to paste it into here well
46:28 - first let's
46:29 - quickly go and have this page open
46:31 - locally so we can see the magic of this
46:33 - this is the local version of the site
46:35 - videos challenges
46:38 - um
46:39 - which is the one i'm looking for maybe i
46:42 - go to the next page
46:44 - this one 15.
46:47 - so
46:48 - notice how this description here is
46:49 - blank
46:51 - let's try it i'm going to put this in
46:52 - here
46:54 - let me turn on word wrap
46:56 - uh put a period there
46:58 - and now there you go look at that it
47:00 - appeared
47:02 - boom because i'm running that and if we
47:04 - went to the terminal it's going to say
47:06 - you can see like
47:08 - it you can see all these information
47:10 - about how it's uh re it ah it found this
47:13 - changed file and it's rebuilding stuff
47:15 - and all that one thing that's
47:16 - interesting to look at by the way i
47:17 - don't understand what this is exactly
47:19 - but there's this
47:21 - view graphyql an in-browser ide to
47:24 - explore your site's data and schema
47:26 - let's take a look at that so this
47:28 - is like
47:29 - uh i know maybe somebody in the chat can
47:31 - explain what this is i'm gonna take a
47:32 - look um
47:37 - yeah so i i see there's some discussion
47:39 - in the chat i'm not sure what the
47:40 - question was but you do not need you
47:42 - could be on any
47:44 - this website should build
47:46 - on any platform that supports node so
47:49 - the server network i assume is where i
47:51 - have it deployed i assume is running
47:52 - some type of linux server unix-based
47:54 - server i'm running it on mac right now
47:56 - you can run node on windows on linux
47:58 - obviously so yeah um
48:01 - yes you can do what i'm doing so now let
48:04 - me read this over to see if i want to
48:05 - make any edits in this coding challenge
48:07 - i can so
48:09 - i don't think i think that's redundant
48:12 - uh can i continue the topic uh let's
48:15 - just change it to
48:17 - more algorithmic botany
48:21 - um
48:24 - uh
48:27 - another way to
48:29 - render
48:30 - i don't know this is hard to do in real
48:32 - time while i'm live streaming this is uh
48:34 - i'm kind of regretting this decision to
48:36 - try to edit this but i wanted to show
48:37 - you like i'm trying to freshen up all
48:40 - the content as i'm bringing it over
48:41 - another way to
48:43 - um
48:45 - generate a fractal
48:48 - tree is to consider
48:52 - every part of the tree an object
48:55 - so that we can apply forces and
48:56 - attributes to
48:59 - all the
49:00 - branches all the branches and leaves and
49:04 - more okay so i'm going to make that edit
49:07 - to the description
49:09 - let's go back and see if this is the old
49:11 - website where is it here
49:14 - localhost so we can see the description
49:17 - here um this might be um whoa what just
49:20 - happened oh it refreshed
49:22 - so
49:23 - i'm wondering just about this
49:25 - read more here with this particular
49:27 - length and then i say read more and it's
49:29 - like kind of a lot of extra space so
49:31 - this might be a bug
49:33 - to work on let's go to the code examples
49:35 - and make sure they work
49:37 - so this goes to
49:40 - p5 sketch
49:44 - uh great this is the code example so
49:45 - that's working what do these do
49:48 - um
49:49 - this takes me to ah the code on uh
49:52 - github and then this one let's see what
49:54 - this does
49:56 - uh downloads the code uh directly okay
49:59 - um and that's and i think these are
50:00 - supposed to have like the processing or
50:02 - p5 logo so that might at one point that
50:05 - was there
50:06 - but i'm not sure what happened to that
50:08 - um
50:09 - okay
50:10 - so there's lots more that could be done
50:12 - uh the time stamps are not here that's
50:15 - something that i would want to add so
50:16 - i'm looking for people to contribute all
50:18 - of these things like if you
50:20 - again i don't want to uh
50:22 - my goal for this is not to take
50:24 - advantage of people's generosity and get
50:26 - free labor
50:27 - like if you are really interested you
50:30 - know i um i have people who are paid to
50:33 - work on porting and but uh
50:36 - and and like building out the content to
50:38 - the website but if this would be a
50:41 - enjoyable learning experience for you to
50:43 - pick one coding challenge or one video
50:45 - page or one thing and try to add some
50:47 - material to it i welcome your
50:50 - contribution um
50:52 - so and and joseph in the chat is saying
50:54 - graphql is a query length so eric writes
50:56 - graph eql pronounced like graphical is a
50:59 - dev endpoint for working with testing
51:00 - the graph
51:02 - graphical api or graphql api which is a
51:05 - query language
51:06 - a way to query data then multiple rest
51:08 - endpoints so it's kind of like the
51:09 - beginnings of an api
51:11 - so i would think that um
51:14 - um
51:16 - i would think that
51:18 - um
51:19 - that's that's good news for like
51:21 - eventual development of being able to
51:22 - serve a lot of the content on the
51:23 - website as an api
51:25 - so
51:25 - let's think about fractals generative
51:27 - art let's add object oriented
51:31 - programming as another topic maybe
51:34 - um
51:36 - uh
51:37 - and i don't know if algorithmic botany
51:40 - really makes sense these are kind of
51:41 - like tags let's add that
51:43 - so the next thing i'm going to do is i'm
51:45 - going to
51:46 - here oops
51:50 - let's look at git status you can see
51:51 - that i've changed the
51:54 - object oriented fractal trees page
51:57 - i'm going to make a separate branch
51:58 - which is live stream demo
52:02 - i'm going to go to that branch
52:06 - um i'm going to hit add
52:09 - just
52:10 - to add those changes
52:13 - to the sort of get staging thingy my mom
52:17 - someday when i do a proper video about
52:18 - git i'll have the vocabulary at the
52:20 - ready um
52:22 - then i'm going to write a commit message
52:24 - now
52:25 - as uh i always have the voice of darius
52:28 - kazemi in the back of my mind that says
52:29 - don't do this don't just write a short
52:31 - message
52:32 - so i'm going to do git commit
52:35 - i'm going to follow the wise words
52:38 - and say like this is a demonstration
52:42 - that i am doing live
52:44 - on youtube
52:46 - to show how
52:48 - to
52:49 - contribute to the new
52:51 - coding
52:52 - train website
52:54 - so and then so the idea here is that i
52:56 - can see what's modified and i could
52:58 - write a longer more thoughtful message
53:00 - i think there's a way to have a title
53:01 - and uh but um i'm gonna then go ahead
53:04 - and
53:06 - quit out of here no
53:08 - how do i how do i get out of this i
53:09 - think i'm in like vi or vim or something
53:13 - no wait
53:14 - cole and q right or x
53:18 - uh there was an error
53:21 - i don't know what i did wrong all right
53:23 - i'm sorry i failed
53:25 - uh live demo
53:28 - live demo of website edit
53:31 - let's go back to this
53:33 - uh then i'm going to push it to
53:36 - uh
53:38 - get push origin
53:40 - uh that and uh apologies i realize some
53:42 - of you watching this like it is all
53:45 - completely unfamiliar to just soak it in
53:47 - um uh maybe check out my uh well there's
53:50 - plenty of wonderful materials online to
53:52 - learn about getting github my tutorial
53:54 - series is called github for poets which
53:56 - you would find on the website or youtube
53:58 - so i'm going to push this up
54:00 - oh interesting i'm not authenticated
54:04 - oh crud
54:06 - um i made a mistake here but let's let's
54:10 - see if i can do this real quickly
54:13 - um
54:15 - i usually have myself authenticated
54:19 - through um
54:21 - keys
54:23 - on my machine
54:24 - then i just have a passcode but i i'm in
54:27 - my coding train login which i guess i
54:29 - haven't done this
54:30 - um
54:31 - so let's see what happens here
54:34 - if
54:35 - um
54:40 - boy you can't see the password that's on
54:42 - this phone can you
54:44 - let me put it here i
54:45 - might have to redo that password
54:53 - yeah it failed why did it fail
54:56 - this is so sad
54:58 - uh isn't my username
55:00 - this
55:18 - all right well this is kind of a little
55:19 - bit of a little you can't use it i mean
55:22 - i have two factor in all of that so
55:24 - um i guess i probably want to use the
55:26 - cli or be authenticated through my keys
55:30 - i wonder if i had cloned it actually
55:32 - through i didn't think to do this but
55:35 - usually
55:36 - oh what oh because i'm not logged in i
55:39 - usually clone it through
55:42 - hold on
55:44 - how do i do that info thing
55:51 - i want to see a five if how
55:54 - if i have a key
55:56 - stored
55:57 - a global um
55:59 - look at the chat
56:04 - get me the pass go to github settings
56:05 - create a token okay but i'm not even
56:07 - logged in i don't know what happened to
56:09 - me
56:10 - um
56:12 - i want to make this happen let's let's
56:14 - let's go forth
56:15 - um all right
56:20 - i'm stubborn i'm going to make this
56:21 - happen
56:22 - um now i need to go to my event my two
56:25 - factor um
56:33 - um okay so what is what are people
56:35 - telling me i need to do
56:36 - um
56:40 - that i should not be doing while showing
56:44 - um
56:46 - but probably that should be should not
56:47 - be showing live
56:48 - uh use the cli it's easy to authenticate
56:54 - uh generally took on the website use
56:56 - that instead of a password all right
56:57 - where do i do that token
57:01 - token token token developer settings
57:04 - password and authentication
57:07 - um
57:09 - i really should probably not be having
57:11 - this open live
57:14 - um
57:21 - keys
57:25 - yeah that's why i cloned it this is
57:27 - still okay
57:28 - let's go back
57:30 - everybody stay calm
57:36 - i'm going to do this
57:38 - i cloned it with https which is what to
57:42 - do if you're not like logged in through
57:44 - your account but i can use ssh
57:53 - try
57:54 - to
57:57 - let's try this
58:00 - yes i this is me being authenticated now
58:03 - oh i'm sorry everybody
58:05 - uh we're just gonna just do this again
58:08 - i'm gonna run in
58:09 - pretend none of that happened
58:12 - developer settings generate tokens so i
58:14 - could have done that
58:15 - um
58:17 - where was that developer settings
58:20 - developer settings
58:22 - personal access token all right i'm
58:26 - i'm moving to this view just in case it
58:28 - shows it
58:29 - expiration
58:31 - custom
58:34 - i'm gonna have this expire tomorrow
58:42 - live
58:44 - and select scopes
58:48 - can i do everything
58:53 - oh boy this is bad i'm giving myself
58:55 - every every possible
59:00 - permission
59:02 - generate token
59:04 - copy it okay
59:06 - so i made a personal access token
59:14 - and now
59:18 - let's try it back in here
59:21 - just curious get put push origin
59:25 - live stream demo
59:27 - so shiffman
59:28 - password so put in my personal access
59:30 - token i just created
59:33 - ah there we go
59:34 - so that works so i can show you that
59:36 - page that doesn't have the access token
59:38 - on it anymore
59:39 - but um wherever that was i think i might
59:42 - have closed it actually
59:43 - um
59:44 - but now all right
59:46 - so sorry for that slight diversion there
59:49 - are this is why
59:51 - this stuff is hard and confusing to
59:53 - navigate because there's so many
59:55 - different ways to do it and so many ways
59:58 - that you could get stuck
59:59 - but the way that i usually work with
60:02 - github is by cloning repos through uh
60:06 - secure shell ssh and i've
60:09 - set up my all sorts of configuration
60:12 - settings on my computer to allow that
60:14 - what i happen to do here i hear this
60:16 - github cli is particularly useful so you
60:19 - can look into installing that but what
60:21 - happened is i used this
60:23 - particular
60:25 - url which is what you would use if
60:27 - you're not authenticated into the it's
60:29 - not like your repo you're not
60:30 - authenticated into it and then
60:33 - um
60:34 - you're able to uh you can generate a
60:36 - personal token and all that kind of
60:37 - stuff is what i showed you so but that's
60:40 - neither here or nor there the important
60:42 - thing is you'll see that all of a sudden
60:45 - i now have this new branch called live
60:47 - stream demo i'm going to do compare and
60:49 - pull request
60:51 - i'm going to say i'm adding description
60:54 - to coding challenge
60:56 - oop fractal tree
61:01 - and this is happening
61:02 - [Music]
61:03 - live right now
61:05 - i'm going to create this pull request
61:08 - oh and i forgot to show you how to run
61:10 - the tests so one thing i should have
61:12 - done by the way and you can see here
61:14 - this is what i changed right it's
61:15 - showing me the new description the new
61:17 - topics
61:19 - and what i uh one thing that i should
61:21 - have done first is do npm run test
61:25 - because this will check the changes to
61:27 - see if there is a typo or error in it
61:30 - but they all passed so for example if i
61:32 - were to go back to this and i if i were
61:34 - to forget this quote
61:36 - obviously like uh visual studio code is
61:38 - showing me through syntax highlighting
61:40 - that there's a mistake but if i were to
61:42 - do this and do npm run test
61:47 - it's going to tell me
61:49 - that the tests failed and if sometimes i
61:52 - can sort of figure out but like syntax
61:54 - error at this place and blah blah blah
61:56 - so i could go back to the file and try
61:58 - to figure out what i got wrong
62:01 - um the pull request itself is actually
62:04 - running these tests so it is running a
62:07 - test and it's even going to do a deploy
62:09 - preview i think so i'm going to wait for
62:11 - that to happen i'm going to take a look
62:12 - at the chat
62:14 - the cli is good um people are saying
62:17 - yeah it's using jest the i have not i
62:19 - did not write any of the tests again
62:21 - this website was designed and developed
62:23 - by uh design systems international
62:27 - let's see how their
62:29 - uh google uh
62:30 - this is their website um they did the
62:33 - website for uh processing and you can
62:35 - see other projects of theirs on um
62:39 - um on
62:40 - uh on their website and they are doing
62:42 - the coding train website which at some
62:44 - point will um
62:46 - i would expect will hopefully appear wow
62:47 - they they redid their website recently
62:50 - um um
62:52 - which i assume will at some point appear
62:54 - on their website as well so check out
62:56 - design systems international
62:58 - um let's see here
63:05 - joseph asks are you using eslint
63:09 - to share styles i don't know i would
63:12 - like to i wanted to one thing that's
63:15 - changing so the previous website in
63:18 - addition to host in addition to holding
63:22 - all of the metadata around all of the
63:24 - videos also held the actual source code
63:27 - for the videos and i'm now going to
63:29 - decouple that it was way too much to
63:32 - manage within one github repository so
63:35 - any page
63:38 - on the website like this being one of
63:39 - them
63:40 - the code examples are all links to urls
63:44 - outside
63:46 - of the website itself now one thing
63:49 - that's a little bit weird is that the
63:51 - url that's going to the source code for
63:54 - processing is currently
63:56 - pointing to the old websites
63:59 - repository because that's where the code
64:01 - is but it's my intention to move those
64:03 - so that's another project that i
64:04 - absolutely need help with i would like
64:06 - to make one repo for all the coding
64:08 - challenges sometimes like for the wave
64:10 - function collapse um project i just have
64:13 - a whole repo that's just wave function
64:14 - collapse romantic hall i have that so
64:16 - it's gonna the source code is going to
64:18 - be able to be flexibly in more than one
64:20 - place under any kind of organization on
64:22 - a case-by-case basis and then the web
64:24 - page just links to it
64:26 - um
64:29 - so uh chris i i talked a bit about how
64:32 - uh the website how it's um uh static
64:34 - build using gatsby and that kind of
64:36 - thing um we'll be revisiting this again
64:39 - more in future streams i guess these
64:41 - take quite a bit of time
64:43 - um i i don't know if um
64:47 - oh oh but look we have a no that's a
64:49 - deploy log
64:50 - um oh so can if i i think i probably
64:52 - have to log into netlify
64:54 - i am logged in so we can see um
64:57 - so i have a netlify account
65:00 - and what this is showing is that this is
65:03 - kind of like what happens is
65:06 - anytime github and netlify are linked to
65:08 - each other
65:09 - and so basically like when there are
65:12 - changes made to the
65:14 - source code repository on github
65:17 - communication happens that tells netlify
65:19 - hey you can rebuild run all the gatsby
65:22 - build commands to rebuild the website to
65:25 - host it um so it's not rehosting it the
65:29 - the the actual website like this is
65:31 - codingtame preview and if i go to
65:33 - challenges and that same page right this
65:37 - is the page on the live netlify preview
65:41 - uh the live website this is the local
65:43 - host page and you can see
65:45 - localhost page has these extra topics
65:48 - the live website does not
65:51 - but at some point
65:53 - it takes quite a while i guess
65:55 - i uh oh wait wait is it is it there
65:58 - is it getting there oh yeah deploy
66:00 - preview ready so i think i can go here
66:04 - ah yes look at this
66:06 - so this is what's so cool about using
66:08 - netlify it created a deploy preview so i
66:12 - could actually see what the website
66:14 - looks like with the new changes i've
66:16 - made before it goes to the live website
66:19 - and it would look this way
66:22 - even when it's at the codingtrain.com
66:24 - actually i don't know what it'll look
66:25 - like maybe it'll do some kind of
66:26 - subdomain thing
66:27 - so i should wait for all the tests to
66:30 - finish
66:33 - before i merge it
66:35 - i kind of know it's going to be fine
66:36 - maybe i'll wait let's see if there's
66:38 - other questions and then once i merge it
66:41 - it would then those changes would then
66:43 - appear live on the actual website so
66:45 - this is such a useful
66:47 - process because even if you don't want
66:50 - if you if you're not doing this locally
66:51 - like let me let me show you probably the
66:53 - way that you're more likely to engage
66:55 - with this it's like and somebody did
66:57 - this recently if i go
66:59 - here to
67:00 - um
67:03 - spelling fixes
67:05 - so for example um supercrafter
67:08 - went through the website and made just
67:10 - like small edits to a lot of different
67:11 - pages um and then i looked at them and
67:15 - merged them but i can actually just do
67:17 - that through the github interface itself
67:19 - like for example
67:21 - if i were to go to
67:23 - a different
67:24 - challenge like the barnsley fern
67:27 - and go here to index.json and if i
67:30 - wanted to edit the description i could
67:31 - just do it right here in the github
67:33 - interface and i could say
67:36 - [Music]
67:39 - visualizing
67:41 - the barnsley firm
67:43 - fractal with processing
67:45 - java and then i could this is a trivial
67:48 - change
67:49 - but do we have fractals generative art
67:54 - um what were some things that i said
67:56 - like algorithmic botany
67:59 - i don't know that we need that as a tag
68:00 - but um so if i wanted to add those um
68:04 - demonstrate uh updating
68:07 - barnsley i saw that wrong barnsley fern
68:12 - and then i could create a new branch
68:15 - and live demo two
68:17 - propose change
68:19 - um and then i could make this a pull
68:21 - request
68:30 - and
68:31 - um
68:34 - now i can look at this pull request
68:38 - i uh chris i appreciate i appreciate
68:40 - your comments about wanting to see a
68:42 - dynam uh a database layer and a dynamic
68:44 - setup but i made a very specific
68:46 - decision to go with a static website it
68:48 - was a long discussion that we ran around
68:50 - a lot of circles on and i i appreciate
68:52 - your feedback and i i you know we'll see
68:54 - what happens in the future but this is
68:56 - definitely the direction that um i've
68:58 - chosen to go in so ah now we can see
69:01 - that this one has completed running its
69:04 - tests
69:05 - and i can merge it in so i'm going to
69:07 - hit merge and then at some point it will
69:10 - take some time
69:11 - this being the actual
69:13 - preview of the website on netlify i can
69:17 - [Music]
69:19 - i can uh
69:21 - refresh here and at some point the new
69:23 - website will build and we'll see the new
69:24 - topics coming in
69:26 - um
69:27 - okay
69:28 - so
69:29 - i'm trying to think of what else i might
69:30 - want oh yes the most important part so
69:33 - what i didn't get to really show here
69:35 - now
69:37 - but i'm going to show you in a second
69:40 - is here under uh closed
69:43 - let's look at this one so um
69:48 - yesterday i believe
69:50 - i received this wonderful pull request
69:53 - um
69:54 - from rue dash a
69:56 - who contributed their particular um
70:00 - uh project so if you want to create your
70:04 - own so let's look at the website to see
70:07 - where this is so i'm going to go to
70:09 - challenges
70:10 - and which one was this that i'm looking
70:12 - at this one is
70:14 - l16l systems
70:17 - so
70:18 - um
70:20 - where was that i'm gonna go to
70:22 - why am i lost here
70:24 - um oh i'm on the website i'm going to
70:26 - 16.
70:30 - don't know what what order they're in
70:31 - i'm going to go here
70:32 - um and one of the things you'll see
70:37 - oh where is it
70:38 - is this the wrong one
70:42 - okay hold on
70:43 - let's figure out what's going on here
70:45 - so i am on
70:47 - challenges 16 l systems fractal tree
70:50 - showcase this was merged
70:52 - contribution 6.
70:54 - so why is it not showing up let's look
70:58 - at it locally here for a second
71:02 - so i'm going to look at the local
71:03 - version
71:04 - whoops
71:09 - challenges
71:11 - video i'm going to videos challenges
71:14 - oh my god it's afternoon already this is
71:16 - insane
71:17 - i guess i guess i should have allocated
71:19 - a lot more time for the website let's go
71:22 - to
71:23 - 16 fractal tree l system passenger
71:26 - showcase
71:27 - so let's now look at what's in there
71:33 - showcase
71:38 - so contribution one two three four five
71:41 - six
71:44 - uh
71:47 - one two three
71:49 - four five oh there it is did i just not
71:52 - scroll far enough to the right
71:55 - let's go back to here
71:58 - no
72:00 - oh maybe it hasn't redeployed do i have
72:02 - to do something to redeploy the website
72:06 - because it's actually showing here so
72:08 - this is what this is what i was trying
72:09 - to show you you can
72:11 - by creating your own json file and
72:13 - uploading a thumbna thumbnail image and
72:15 - the the plan is to both have a cli as
72:18 - well as a form that you can enter in to
72:20 - do this so you ultimately don't have to
72:22 - do it by like manually creating a json
72:24 - file you can see this is the
72:25 - contribution and it appears
72:28 - um
72:31 - so
72:32 - um
72:36 - okay so
72:38 - what i'm confused about is why it's not
72:42 - actually appearing on the main website
72:45 - do i need to do something
72:50 - to actually i'm not logged in
72:53 - all right i have to figure out i'll have
72:55 - to figure this out i i didn't realize
72:58 - that
72:59 - maybe there's an extra step that when
73:01 - something is merged to main for it to
73:03 - redeploy to the actual website itself
73:06 - because i'm not seeing it
73:09 - i'm still looking at the preview
73:13 - i know but the preview is sorry it's
73:15 - confusing the preview is the live
73:18 - website right now i just haven't i just
73:21 - haven't
73:22 - this is not a deploy preview i probably
73:24 - shouldn't have called it preview
73:26 - i should have called it coding train
73:28 - uh almost published to be moved to the
73:31 - actual domain this is the equivalent of
73:34 - the live website
73:36 - unless it's just cached
73:39 - because
73:40 - i looked at that page before let's just
73:42 - try this
73:43 - uh videos tracks no i always go videos
73:47 - challenges
73:50 - um
73:54 - uh what was i looking for
73:57 - um
73:58 - this one
74:01 - i'm gonna force refresh
74:05 - yeah i don't know why
74:07 - it's not building
74:09 - it's there
74:12 - how is it there
74:28 - thank you yes i see the discussion is
74:30 - continuing and i i totally get it i
74:33 - appreciate the feedback um i don't think
74:36 - it's a perfect solution by any means and
74:38 - i definitely would like to do i
74:41 - definitely i plan to do
74:42 - i mean this is i'm kind of realizing how
74:44 - long this takes but i plan to do a full
74:46 - live stream this is practically becoming
74:48 - that dedicated to the website and uh
74:50 - being more organized about how to walk
74:52 - people through working on it
74:54 - um
74:55 - you stayed on the page and refreshed
74:57 - just now
74:59 - so weird
75:02 - i'm not seeing it here
75:05 - but let's go just out of curiosity let's
75:07 - go to
75:11 - this one
75:13 - i i um which one the object this one
75:17 - oh yeah this appeared
75:20 - so this is strange so the changes i just
75:22 - made today appeared
75:25 - so there maybe there's like a caching
75:27 - thing going on
75:28 - let me just go to like a new incognito
75:30 - window
75:33 - and go to
75:35 - challenges
75:37 - and um
75:43 - which one this one is the one i'm
75:44 - looking for
75:46 - no so strange
75:50 - oh does it maybe only show
75:53 - a certain number not all of them no i
75:55 - think it whoops i think it shows it's
75:57 - very hard to scroll this that's one
75:59 - actually a little bit of feedback that
76:01 - might
76:01 - oh i have this here
76:03 - like does it only show a random number
76:05 - of them all right i i have to move on
76:09 - hold shift yes i've done that i've
76:11 - holden i've held shift press the refresh
76:13 - button many times uh i think it's time
76:16 - for me to move on
76:18 - um
76:20 - um to uh the next part of today's live
76:24 - stream so i wanted to come back to monty
76:28 - hall
76:29 - um
76:32 - let me come back
76:34 - to a monty hall
76:38 - sorry i i i got a little
76:41 - that drained me getting stuck with a few
76:43 - things and trying to like maneuver
76:45 - between all these different windows
76:46 - how's everybody doing i need a break for
76:49 - sure um there should be moderators on
76:52 - this stream
76:54 - yes
76:55 - um
76:56 - but you know sometimes
76:59 - that's not the case so if we need some
77:02 - moderation help um let's um
77:06 - let's uh let's let's get there okay
77:13 - interestingly enough just just one last
77:15 - you indulge me with one last check
77:18 - so where i should see it
77:20 - oh no wait that doesn't make any sense
77:22 - okay i'm lost never mind i'm gonna come
77:24 - back to this later uh
77:26 - um and yeah it should so i i i went
77:29 - through a sort of opening discussion
77:30 - about this but i encourage everybody to
77:33 - um to play around the website um to to
77:36 - add your versions of things you've made
77:38 - from the videos to it and stay tuned in
77:40 - early june i will be returning to do a
77:43 - much longer session probably on twitch
77:45 - where we just spend all day kind of
77:46 - helping people
77:48 - and through adding stuff to the website
77:50 - okay
77:51 - well in theory i was going to be done in
77:53 - about 40 minutes but i'll probably go
77:54 - long
77:56 - so thank you mustafa okay so
77:58 - um i um um let's go to um
78:03 - the coding train for a second
78:05 - um under videos
78:07 - and here under the monty hall problem
78:11 - uh what am i not logged i'm not oh i'm
78:13 - in the incognito window okay let's go
78:16 - back to here
78:18 - and uh okay so i'll let this play i'm
78:21 - gonna do and um
78:23 - let's look at the comments so
78:25 - if you haven't um
78:29 - if you haven't seen this video yet i i
78:32 - would love for you to check it out this
78:33 - was a lot of fun to make
78:35 - my
78:38 - diagrams about a bayes theorem are still
78:40 - over there on the whiteboard
78:41 - um
78:42 - and so um i wanted to just talk about a
78:46 - few things
78:47 - so first let me just show you in case
78:50 - you didn't see
78:52 - that
78:53 - um
78:54 - if you want to experiment with this
78:56 - problem here is the web demo so the
79:00 - monty hall problem i'm going to just
79:02 - re-explain it briefly i'm going to talk
79:03 - about what i missed in the video
79:05 - for those of you who might have watched
79:07 - it and thank you for all the comments
79:08 - and the feedback this is the monty hall
79:10 - problem there is a prize behind one of
79:12 - these doors
79:14 - uh in the video i sort of say it's a
79:16 - trip on the coding train express
79:19 - um so i'm gonna pick a door one
79:23 - so i picked door one and then door two
79:26 - was open now this happened very fast in
79:28 - the actual in an actual
79:30 - sequence of playing this game out in a
79:31 - game show there would be a lot of
79:33 - fanfare and a lot of drama
79:35 - now the idea is that once i pick door
79:37 - number one
79:38 - the the the doors without the prize have
79:41 - a goat behind them is what you're using
79:43 - here you know of course the goat we all
79:45 - know is the true prize
79:46 - but um the idea here is that i've picked
79:49 - door number one
79:51 - and the host is going to open door
79:54 - number two to say like ah look there's a
79:56 - goat here
79:57 - so now in theory do you want to keep
80:00 - your door oh i'm gonna offer you a
80:02 - chance to switch
80:03 - like trying to re-explain this
80:05 - and running into some of the same issues
80:09 - so there's come so there's a couple
80:11 - things that in the video i didn't
80:12 - explain too well now in an actual game
80:15 - show the it might be that the host is
80:18 - intentionally trying to mislead you or
80:21 - not really explain all of the ins and
80:23 - outs of what's going on and just create
80:25 - this fun
80:27 - scenario where you have to really
80:29 - dramatically decide whether you're like
80:31 - are you going to switch and maybe you
80:32 - really had it or are you going to keep
80:34 - what you have but maybe you really
80:35 - should have switched like what do you do
80:37 - and sort of feels like a coin toss at
80:39 - this point because there's two doors we
80:40 - know the prizes in one of those places
80:43 - but
80:43 - what is really important about
80:46 - about this probability pro the specific
80:48 - problem that i'm talking about is that
80:50 - the host is all knowing
80:53 - the host
80:54 - knows what's behind all the doors so the
80:57 - host couldn't but so if the host didn't
81:00 - know anything and they were just like
81:01 - you picked door number one well let's
81:02 - show you one of the doors just to see
81:04 - those could buy accidents show you the
81:05 - prize and then you know you have 100
81:08 - chance of losing at that point right you
81:10 - can't pick or switch because you can't
81:11 - switch someone but in this case the host
81:14 - there's only three
81:16 - there's only a couple possibilities
81:18 - one
81:19 - if there's only three three scenarios
81:21 - right one is you picked
81:23 - the correct prize in which case it
81:26 - doesn't matter which door the host opens
81:28 - uh you've got the prize under your door
81:31 - the other
81:32 - uh scenario is the prize is actually
81:34 - under door number three so the host has
81:36 - to open door number two
81:38 - the other scenario is
81:41 - the prize is under door number two and
81:42 - so the host has to open up door number
81:44 - three so i'm not necessarily doing a
81:46 - better job explaining this than i did in
81:47 - the video but i'm just trying to sort of
81:49 - rehash it and explain that i wasn't
81:52 - incredibly clear
81:54 - about that the host being i didn't
81:55 - mention it but you know it's a little
81:57 - tricky to follow in the video um and so
82:00 - one of the things that i did in the
82:01 - video in particular maybe we can find
82:03 - one of these comments let's just look
82:04 - and see if any of the i meant to go
82:06 - through and like um
82:08 - youtube keeps changing its interface and
82:10 - i can't find the comments now here they
82:12 - are
82:12 - um
82:14 - uh
82:15 - let's just see there were some useful
82:17 - ones
82:18 - um that people had get some nice
82:21 - corrections to me
82:22 - uh yes so this is simon has a great
82:24 - comment here so um one of the things
82:26 - that i said in the video was that um
82:30 - there and you could think of it as there
82:32 - are
82:33 - four possibilities right back to these
82:35 - doors again or no where what was i
82:41 - oh i was at the demo ah let me go back
82:43 - to simon's comment
82:45 - um
82:47 - sorry
82:48 - i've lost what i'm doing here
82:50 - um
82:53 - where's simon's comment there it is um
82:56 - that i s there you could think of it uh
82:58 - let's let's um
83:01 - let's refresh this right
83:03 - i'm picking door number one
83:06 - if the prize
83:08 - i said like let's say if the prize is
83:10 - behind them door number two then the
83:12 - host has to open up door number three
83:16 - if the prize is behind door number three
83:18 - the host has to open up door number two
83:20 - that's two scenarios now what if the
83:23 - prize is behind door number one
83:27 - well
83:28 - in the way that i explained it you might
83:29 - have been misled that there are now two
83:31 - other possibilities because the host
83:33 - could open door two or door three but
83:36 - those are one scenario right the idea
83:40 - that the way to think about this and i
83:42 - think this is much more clear maybe i'll
83:43 - just use the whiteboard for a second
83:45 - um is that
83:55 - hello welcome to the monty hall problem
83:58 - i am going to pick
84:00 - uh i'm the contestant i'm gonna pick
84:02 - door number one
84:06 - and now monty hall
84:08 - is going to say
84:10 - you could have door number one
84:12 - or you could have both doors number two
84:14 - and three
84:16 - so you know they all had prizes on to
84:18 - them first of all you'd probably want to
84:19 - take these two because probably the
84:21 - combined prizes would be more than just
84:23 - one price but regardless i don't know
84:24 - why i went off with that tangent you
84:26 - would want a switch because if you could
84:29 - have um two chances out of three over
84:32 - one chance out of three then absolutely
84:34 - you would want to so those are the three
84:37 - pot there's really only three
84:38 - possibilities door is behind here
84:41 - the prize is here the price is here or
84:43 - the price is here
84:45 - if you pick both doors two and three
84:47 - you're gonna lose when the price is here
84:49 - but you're gonna win when it's here or
84:50 - and you're gonna win when it's here so
84:52 - two out of three times you're going to
84:54 - win
84:55 - so it's very hard to wrap your head
84:57 - around it
84:58 - obviously i think you know it's often
85:00 - demonstrated well through playing out
85:02 - the simulation that's what this is for
85:04 - so if i put on auto run
85:07 - it's going to just play the game over
85:08 - and over again i'm going to turn the
85:09 - speed way up and we're gonna see it's
85:11 - just playing it and randomly deciding
85:14 - whether to switch or stay and you can
85:16 - see like over time like right now it's
85:18 - kind of doing better than expected it's
85:20 - like hovering up around 68 or 69 percent
85:23 - but over time and
85:24 - this should be around 33
85:26 - and this should be around 67
85:29 - the other thing that's um that i like
85:31 - about this demonstration is i can change
85:34 - to have it uh 25 doors for example so
85:37 - let me just do this for a second so um
85:40 - let's say i pick door 18
85:43 - and the host shows all of those doors
85:45 - have goats do i want to switch
85:48 - like i'm i do really right because uh
85:51 - yeah there we go and i won the prize so
85:52 - we could do this again many many times
85:55 - and
85:57 - you know i'm gonna you know at some
85:58 - point i might lose by accident
86:01 - and then if i auto run this one
86:03 - we're gonna see that i haven't even so
86:05 - far out of all these times
86:07 - i'm still at zero percent eventually at
86:09 - some point this will be more than zero
86:11 - percent let's wait and see
86:12 - um
86:16 - right so alex is saying the best
86:18 - explanation is from brilliant so one of
86:20 - the reasons why i wanted to talk about
86:24 - this video today uh one is i just like
86:26 - to
86:27 - uh
86:28 - revisit previous videos that i made in
86:30 - the live stream and answer any questions
86:32 - and talk about comments
86:34 - um
86:36 - and uh i i i need to do a better job of
86:39 - being prepared for that because there
86:40 - were some other great comments there in
86:41 - that thread but i want to move on to
86:43 - looking at some apple basic stuff today
86:46 - and i also want to tell you about
86:48 - today's sponsor and i am going to
86:52 - manually
86:53 - oh i know why the banner didn't show up
86:56 - because i'm a
86:58 - dum-dum and the banner the banner
87:00 - appears on this screen not on the other
87:02 - screen that's why it didn't show up at
87:03 - the beginning so i want to tell you
87:05 - about today's sponsor brilliant so this
87:08 - demo
87:09 - this dem live demo that i did of the
87:11 - monty hall problem
87:13 - where you can interact with it and try
87:15 - any given scenario whether auto running
87:17 - it this is like a
87:20 - pale in comparison to all of the
87:22 - incredible demonstrations and
87:24 - interactive lessons on math and science
87:27 - and probability and calculus and etc
87:29 - that are on
87:31 - the brilliant website so let's walk over
87:34 - i'm not walking anywhere i'm just going
87:35 - in my browser over to brilliant
87:38 - brilliant is a website full of
87:41 - interactive lessons and challenges and
87:43 - courses on all sorts of topics and the
87:46 - thing that i like to talk about is you
87:48 - know i appreciate that people watching
87:50 - the coding train watch my videos and
87:53 - that maybe you gain some inspiration you
87:54 - learn something and then but the most
87:56 - important thing of watching my videos is
87:57 - then going trying it yourself and
87:59 - brilliant is a thing that's all you're
88:01 - basically doing is trying things
88:02 - yourself and i think the the best um
88:05 - thing for me to show is just look at all
88:06 - these core i mean every time i look at
88:07 - this list of courses i'm like oh i want
88:09 - to do that one and that one and that one
88:10 - beautiful geometry is absolutely one of
88:12 - my favorites great uh great ideas for
88:15 - doing coding challenges and
88:17 - about fractals and infinity and all
88:18 - sorts of beautiful stuff
88:21 - i wanted to look today um
88:24 - at the um
88:25 - probability course
88:29 - um
88:30 - which is the there's there's several
88:32 - different courses but i want to look at
88:33 - the
88:34 - introduction to probability course i do
88:36 - want to point out though before i get
88:38 - there and i think this should come up um
88:41 - that
88:42 - one of the courses that brilliant has is
88:45 - their neural network course that i was
88:47 - looking at recently and there's this
88:48 - incredible i usually show the
88:50 - demonstration of it recognizing
88:51 - handwritten digits but this course
88:53 - actually allows you to play with neurons
88:57 - and activation functions
88:59 - to look at how the weights affect the
89:01 - output neuron and adjusting those
89:04 - weights
89:05 - and and looking at how
89:08 - activation functions and the different
89:10 - bits and parts of neural networks work
89:12 - so i really recommend if you're
89:13 - interested in machine learning and
89:14 - neural network stuff i would definitely
89:16 - recommend looking at that
89:17 - um let me come back over to here so
89:19 - let's start this probability course
89:21 - together for a little bit
89:23 - um
89:25 - sorry simon i don't have discord open
89:27 - right now i screwed up my screens today
89:30 - so i will look at it briefly if it's
89:32 - urgent you're gonna have to uh
89:34 - tell me uh sooner somehow what you're
89:37 - trying to get to me okay so let's start
89:40 - this lesson
89:42 - and let's make this uh-oh
89:45 - suppose scientists detected a large
89:48 - asteroid headed straight for earth
89:51 - if the asteroid were to collide with
89:53 - earth how likely do you think it would
89:54 - be to hit a city
89:56 - all right
89:58 - about as likely as a person being hit by
90:00 - lightning
90:01 - about as likely as an expecting mother
90:04 - having twin children
90:06 - about as likely as a person correctly
90:08 - guessing a six-sided die roll
90:11 - okay i really don't think it's the
90:13 - bottom like if you think about the
90:15 - surface area
90:17 - of the earth
90:19 - how much of that first of all so much of
90:21 - it is just ocean
90:22 - right
90:23 - then the parts that's not ocean how much
90:25 - of it is it
90:26 - is it
90:28 - is its city
90:29 - so i definitely think
90:33 - that
90:34 - um
90:35 - i'm seeing there's a question in the
90:36 - chat about why i don't interact with the
90:38 - chat i do my best
90:40 - i'm really trying to get
90:42 - some someday i'll have this all worked
90:44 - out but i'm doing my best but yes the
90:46 - chat is not my my primarily primary
90:48 - point of focus
90:49 - i mean
90:50 - i want to say like
90:53 - it's probably the hit by lightning i
90:55 - don't you know
90:58 - maybe it's twix how often what are what
91:00 - is the what is the probability of having
91:02 - twins i don't know it's certainly one of
91:03 - these two what do you all think i'm
91:05 - looking at the chat
91:10 - to see i'm just gonna go with
91:12 - i'm gonna go with lightning
91:18 - by the end of the lesson we'll find out
91:19 - which answer was correct
91:21 - all right
91:22 - well clearly it's more likely to strike
91:23 - land i think that's right you can't hit
91:26 - a city oh canada city without also
91:28 - hitting land okay
91:30 - so that's true so uh okay so that was
91:33 - obvious i the question kind of tricked
91:34 - me because i sort of thought of it as
91:36 - city or non-city again this is why i
91:38 - like these and i haven't done this
91:39 - course before i specifically waited to
91:41 - do this with you live so i could
91:43 - embarrass myself fully in front of you
91:45 - all
91:46 - um
91:47 - the map shows the distribution of land
91:49 - and water okay so let's use it to
91:52 - estimate the probability that asteroid
91:53 - hits land
91:55 - it's less likely that's that to me with
91:58 - this by the way this is really
91:59 - interesting to look at this uh
92:01 - perspective view most of the times that
92:04 - we look at maps and this is i've talked
92:06 - about in other videos like mercator
92:07 - projection different kinds of ways of
92:09 - taking this the earth that is a sphere
92:11 - and turning it into a flat map really
92:13 - distorts the relative scale
92:16 - but
92:16 - looks like this view is doing a fairly
92:18 - accurate job but
92:19 - regardless i can see that it's more less
92:21 - likely to hit land
92:23 - okay less of the earth's surface is
92:25 - covered by land than by water okay
92:27 - that's right so let's keep going
92:29 - all right
92:30 - now imagine reshaping the areas covered
92:32 - by land and water a pair of rectangles
92:34 - uh this is cool see
92:35 - like i
92:36 - my instinct when i see these things is
92:38 - like oh i want to make this in p5
92:40 - uh
92:41 - okay so this is cool
92:43 - adjust the divider so i'm gonna say
92:47 - this
92:48 - too much water okay
92:50 - uh
92:51 - correct 70 okay
92:54 - 30 covered by land
92:57 - there is a one out of three chance that
92:58 - the asteroid hits land
93:01 - um okay all cities are on land
93:06 - to find the property event identified on
93:07 - a grid of all outcomes the probability
93:09 - of n is the area of the event divided by
93:10 - the area of entire grid that totally
93:12 - makes sense
93:14 - um
93:16 - so let's look at that likely the
93:17 - asterisk hit some particular country if
93:19 - we know it hits land
93:21 - so
93:22 - russia covers 11 of all land so it's 11
93:25 - of the 30
93:27 - i think i might have been wrong here but
93:29 - let's see 11
93:30 - canada 6 china 6
93:33 - so
93:34 - russia being the largest we would say
93:36 - that it's most likely to be hit
93:40 - correct by the way one of the really
93:41 - nice things about brilliant also is i
93:42 - can um
93:44 - see these uh explanations as well and
93:46 - that one was fairly intuitive for me so
93:48 - i don't but many a time i'm checking oh
93:50 - and i have a hint
93:51 - since an earthbound asteroid is more
93:53 - likely to hit russia
93:56 - and india we can also estimate how much
93:58 - more likely
94:00 - uh so how much more likely is the
94:02 - asteroid to hit russia than india well
94:04 - if russia is 11 and india
94:07 - is 2 wouldn't it be 5 times more likely
94:10 - because 2 times 5 is 10.
94:15 - i hope that's right i could look at the
94:16 - hint
94:17 - correct okay i got it right
94:20 - we saw earlier that the asteroid hits a
94:22 - city with a probability of 30 percent by
94:25 - now we know probability equals relative
94:27 - area we can get much better estimate by
94:28 - finding earth's total urban area okay
94:32 - okay this nighttime view of the
94:33 - mediterranean sea oh
94:36 - cities show up and since they're
94:37 - brightly lit oh that's a lot more city
94:39 - than i thought
94:42 - that's more city than i saw just looking
94:44 - at this sort of european area
94:46 - what kind of land are the vast majority
94:48 - of cities located near water okay
94:52 - um
94:53 - okay
94:54 - uh coastal it turns out ten percent of
94:56 - all land on earth is coastal
95:00 - so
95:02 - being struck by lightning is exceedingly
95:04 - rare i think it must be the twins
95:06 - the twins thing but i think my instinct
95:08 - was wrong
95:10 - so 10 of the land is coastal land
95:14 - is that the green land i'm confused
95:20 - uh are the yellow i'm confused seventy
95:22 - percent is
95:25 - is that what i want i want it the other
95:27 - is green coastal
95:29 - too much coast no the other way around
95:30 - okay right the yellow is coastal i guess
95:32 - i should have gotten that
95:34 - okay correct
95:37 - splitting all land area into coast and
95:39 - inland gives us three regions
95:43 - got it
95:44 - ten percent
95:47 - ninety percent
95:49 - all right what's the probability that
95:51 - the asteroid strikes coastal land the
95:53 - strip of land that touches water
95:55 - okay so it's ten percent of thirty
95:58 - percent that should be three percent
96:00 - right
96:02 - three percent well okay you i definitely
96:05 - do not have a three percent chance of
96:06 - being struck by lightning
96:08 - but i think that's probably that sounds
96:10 - like about the probability for twins
96:14 - but maybe cities aren't all the coast
96:16 - i'm not sure
96:18 - since only three percent of the
96:20 - probably ask him to coastline is three
96:21 - percent
96:22 - okay the vast majority of cities are in
96:25 - coastal lands probability of a city
96:27 - impact should be no greater than three
96:28 - percent
96:31 - what information would let us add cities
96:33 - to the grid
96:34 - the total number of cities on earth
96:37 - the total number of coastal cities on
96:39 - earth the percentage of earth's coastal
96:41 - land area that's covered by cities
96:47 - well
96:52 - i would say the last one
96:55 - uh
96:58 - yeah everyone's uh
97:00 - um i want to say this let's look at the
97:02 - hint i feel like i need a hint here
97:04 - which would be easier to represent on a
97:06 - grid a number of cities or a percentage
97:08 - of land yes definitely a percentage of
97:10 - land
97:11 - so i was right because these are we
97:12 - useful to know the total number of
97:14 - cities but that that doesn't really give
97:16 - us any sense of like how much land
97:19 - they're taking up because how big are
97:21 - the cities except there could be a
97:22 - million cities if they're all like tiny
97:24 - tiny cities that would be much less than
97:27 - um
97:28 - you know 100 000 super big cities okay
97:32 - correct okay
97:35 - turns out that ten percent of all
97:37 - coastal land is covered by cities
97:39 - so it means it can spit up close to land
97:41 - and strip into two regions
97:44 - so ten percent of three percent is point
97:46 - three percent
97:48 - and that's sounding much more like
97:50 - probability of having twins
97:53 - yeah uh again like if there's a point
97:55 - three percent chance of being struck by
97:57 - lightning
97:58 - i don't know if that's in your lifetime
97:59 - or on any given day i don't that's that
98:01 - would obviously be there'd be a slight
98:03 - but i think it's so remote that almost
98:05 - that doesn't there's probably not that
98:06 - much of a distinction between those two
98:11 - having twins okay
98:13 - so i definitely got it wrong i don't
98:15 - know i i felt like so sometimes i have
98:16 - this instinct does that mean where i
98:18 - feel like i'm trying to be i'm trying to
98:19 - be tricked by the question
98:21 - so to me it seemed like the obvious
98:22 - answer was having twins but i thought i
98:24 - was trying to be tricked by the question
98:26 - so i i got afraid and slowly went by
98:28 - struck by lightning but obviously
98:30 - um if uh what i what i love about this
98:33 - lesson first of all is that i got it
98:34 - wrong and the steps really made it
98:35 - obvious how to think think this through
98:37 - so that was great
98:38 - um
98:40 - okay review and reflect
98:44 - uh puzzling
98:45 - result from medicine so actually i
98:48 - wonder if
98:49 - um
98:51 - look at me on my six day streak um
98:55 - people people there's lots of excellent
98:57 - feedback in the chat so you know the
98:58 - idea of this problem by the way is not
99:00 - really to get into the nitty-gritty of
99:03 - actual like sort of asteroid behavior
99:07 - it's more of a thought experiment of
99:09 - this very like sort of constrained
99:10 - scoped problem of all there happens to
99:12 - be an asteroid
99:13 - going towards earth it has an equal
99:15 - probability of hitting any given like
99:18 - latitude and longitude which may not
99:19 - actually be true based on like how the
99:21 - earth spins and all the gravitational
99:24 - stuff of all the things around it
99:26 - um but oh continue
99:29 - i didn't see that so um so i'm going to
99:32 - move on now but the reason why i'd
99:34 - really like this lesson thank you
99:37 - continue so this is really interesting
99:39 - um because i have a feeling and i um
99:42 - that this is leading towards bayesian
99:45 - probability so one of the
99:47 - most so i i in my video about the monty
99:50 - hall problem i tried to relate and you
99:53 - know we can see this still here
99:55 - um
99:56 - the monty hall problem
99:58 - to
99:59 - bayesian probability analysis and bayes
100:01 - theorem and i'm not going to rehash this
100:03 - right now but essentially this is bayes
100:06 - theorem and i was using various uh
100:09 - probability
100:11 - analyses of different pieces of the
100:13 - three-door problem to then calculate the
100:15 - probability that you will win if you
100:17 - switch doors which is two-thirds
100:19 - a much more common way
100:22 - to
100:23 - understand about bayes to to learn about
100:26 - bayesian probability
100:28 - analysis is to look at
100:31 - um
100:33 - the common scenario is looking at a
100:35 - medical testing so because one of the
100:37 - interesting things about a medical test
100:39 - you know testing like for example if we
100:40 - think about you know the the covid
100:42 - pandemic for example a coronavirus test
100:45 - is the tests aren't a hundred percent
100:47 - reliable right if i get
100:51 - a positive test
100:53 - saying i have covid well there's a high
100:56 - likelihood i really do have covid but
100:57 - there's a small there's a chance there
100:59 - that that was a false positive vice
101:01 - versa if the test is negative there's
101:03 - probably a higher chance of false false
101:05 - negative again you know don't quote me
101:07 - on these figures i'm not like i'm just
101:09 - talking about in the sort of abstract
101:11 - sense
101:12 - so
101:13 - getting a positive result
101:16 - uh is dependent
101:18 - one on the rate of false positives but
101:22 - not just that it also depends on like
101:25 - how common is having this disease or
101:28 - this uh i i've seen this done with
101:31 - different tests for cancer for example
101:34 - um so for example if if let's make up
101:36 - something like coding train
101:38 - illness
101:40 - coding trainingitis
101:41 - if you have coding if there's only a
101:44 - zero zero zero zero zero zero one
101:47 - percent chance you know one out of 100
101:48 - million people in the world ever get
101:50 - coding train itis
101:52 - we all have coding trainitis by the way
101:54 - it's just
101:55 - it makes your arms move around like a
101:57 - kind of a crazy person um
101:59 - so uh one out of uh you know hundreds of
102:02 - millions of people get it
102:04 - you know even if you get a positive test
102:06 - it's so unlikely that you would have it
102:09 - you know what's the rate of false
102:10 - positives that's all of those prior
102:13 - probabilities
102:14 - um are as well as the sort of event
102:17 - probabilities associated with taking the
102:19 - test are going to inform the actual
102:21 - likelihood that you actually have coding
102:23 - train itis so that was kind of a very
102:25 - cursive this is why like you listen to
102:26 - me talk about this and that was kind of
102:28 - a
102:29 - you know i would say a b minus
102:31 - explanation
102:32 - um but if i were i'm assuming that if i
102:34 - were to go on to complete this course um
102:37 - we're gonna start getting uh uh we're
102:40 - gonna be walked through how to learn
102:43 - about probability and thinking about
102:45 - real-world situations the chant the
102:47 - probability to chance affects the
102:49 - results of imperfect imperfect disease
102:52 - tests
102:54 - okay
102:55 - um alex is saying that pacific ocean is
102:57 - actually 35 so thank you for um thank
103:00 - you for brilliant for sponsoring the
103:02 - coding train today thank you
103:04 - to um all of you for watching the coding
103:06 - train in this sponsorship segment i
103:09 - really find that it just it works well
103:11 - because it's like i'm not even veering
103:13 - off my content because my content is
103:15 - working through these kinds of
103:16 - interesting probability problems and
103:17 - math problems and geometry problems and
103:20 - um these uh working through these always
103:22 - give me ideas for things to do in future
103:24 - coding videos and coding challenges so
103:26 - uh if you want to learn more about
103:28 - brilliant go to brilliant.org
103:29 - codingtrain you can sign up for free and
103:31 - get started um giving it a try that lets
103:34 - them know you found great from me and if
103:36 - you want to unlock everything that
103:38 - brilliant has to offer um you the first
103:41 - 200 people to do so will get 20 off the
103:43 - premium subscription um i'll also just
103:45 - point out that if you already have
103:46 - brilliant um
103:49 - you can gift a subscription which is a
103:50 - really nice thing to do for somebody you
103:53 - don't know what to get for them they
103:54 - seem to have everything but they like
103:55 - learning they don't want to give them
103:56 - like stuff that's more like plastic and
103:59 - all of that it just kind of goes into a
104:00 - landfill um here we go this is a great
104:03 - gift as well okay so i'm going to take
104:06 - like a less than
104:08 - three minute break
104:10 - i'm putting that never mind whenever i
104:12 - look at him stop in the middle but it's
104:13 - 12 45 already i'm gonna give myself to 1
104:15 - 30 and i'm going to come back and i'm
104:17 - going to start doing
104:18 - some um
104:22 - some uh basic programming in an emulator
104:25 - and maybe i'll move my camera to show
104:28 - you what's going on with my apple ii
104:29 - plus as well i'm gonna do that during
104:31 - the break um all right here we go into
104:36 - intermission land all right so you know
104:38 - i'm just going to put this on
104:39 - i'm going to be i'm going to hopefully
104:41 - be less than five minutes
104:43 - i wonder if i can i can't it's a video
104:45 - that plays it's not the timer's not
104:46 - dynamic so i'll be back in less than
104:48 - five minutes but i am giving myself five
104:49 - minutes
105:10 - do
105:20 - do
105:47 - so
106:46 - do
108:23 - do
108:41 - all right i'm going to switch the camera
108:45 - to
108:47 - this
108:48 - hopefully you're seeing the apple ii
108:50 - plus computer right now and hearing me
108:52 - okay
108:54 - i can fade out the music um
108:57 - let me bring
108:59 - so i can see the chat let me bring this
109:03 - ipad over here with me
109:09 - um
109:16 - oh no no no
109:20 - okay great
109:21 - all right hi everybody um
109:24 - hello camera so this is my um apple ii
109:28 - plus
109:29 - um that
109:30 - if you've been following my saga that
109:32 - i've been posting a bit on twitter about
109:35 - that um this is my um original uh
109:39 - childhood computer but it i did get it
109:42 - to work for about a half an hour when i
109:44 - first turned it on
109:46 - but i'm just gonna say hi hi um
109:49 - but uh since then uh
109:51 - um the power supply kind of
109:54 - the some of the capacitors in started to
109:57 - smoke and fry and so one of the things
109:59 - that i was able to do is i
110:01 - got this um
110:02 - let me see if i'm just going to move the
110:04 - camera down a little bit i can't so i'm
110:05 - not seeing a live picture of the camera
110:06 - so i don't know what i'm doing but this
110:08 - is a power supply that i got from a
110:10 - reactive micro
110:11 - um
110:12 - you know
110:13 - i don't know i know how well this is
110:15 - going to work just moving the camera
110:16 - around but um you can see it here um so
110:18 - this is a a rebuilt power supply so i
110:21 - have that now built um comes with a nice
110:23 - little fan
110:26 - and so
110:27 - oops
110:28 - so that works
110:29 - quite well
110:33 - and
110:34 - um
110:37 - um what i'm gonna do is turn it on
110:43 - and turn this on
110:46 - and um
110:48 - i then also had some problems with the
110:50 - logic board and this is actually
110:54 - not the original i took all the
110:56 - expansion cards out i tried to fix some
110:59 - things
111:00 - uh like remove some of these chips and
111:02 - like check connections and stuff and
111:04 - clean some things but i wasn't having
111:05 - luck i actually just bought a um
111:09 - a
111:09 - repaired logic board for an apple ii
111:11 - plus off of ebay and that's what's in
111:13 - here right now
111:14 - so um
111:17 - last i checked this was working
111:20 - but let's see what's happening here and
111:22 - this is the monitor
111:25 - which i don't think is going to work so
111:26 - what i'm going to do right now
111:28 - unfortunately my monitors also stopped
111:31 - working
111:32 - and i was told don't open up your
111:34 - monitor you you get electrocuted so what
111:37 - i'm gonna do right now is
111:39 - i'm going to plug in this video cable i
111:42 - have this like little
111:44 - ah there we go look
111:46 - so uh i don't know what you're seeing
111:48 - now
111:49 - um
111:51 - so i don't know why i'm seeing
111:52 - garbledness that's not a good sign
111:55 - ah there we go look at that apple two
111:58 - plus so things are
112:00 - working and
112:03 - i have a stand for this monitor and
112:05 - everything i just i should have
112:06 - i should have clearly gotten that ready
112:09 - um and
112:10 - i can
112:12 - type things like
112:14 - uh
112:16 - print
112:20 - now by the way i cleaned the keyboard
112:21 - spacebar i still can't get to work i
112:24 - don't know why i cleaned the keyboard
112:26 - and kind of like took it apart and
112:29 - um so the keyboard is working much
112:30 - better now print
112:33 - oops
112:40 - whoops
112:41 - choo choo
112:44 - so i've typed
112:46 - print choo choo
112:48 - and i'm going to hit enter
112:49 - and there we go we wrote some apple
112:50 - basic and there it is
112:53 - um
112:57 - uh
112:58 - i'm just looking at the chat right now
113:03 - so um
113:05 - so i'm trying to figure out what so next
113:07 - week i'm planning to shoot this uh
113:10 - create this course and i'm hopefully by
113:13 - this weekend i'm gonna have more time to
113:15 - work on seeing you know somebody told me
113:17 - just try banging on your mind
113:20 - uh maybe i'll buy another monitor off
113:22 - ebay maybe i'll just use this monitor
113:24 - um but i really want to get i really
113:26 - want to do the course on this actual
113:28 - computer but it is quite awkward
113:31 - especially right now for me to to do
113:33 - that so i just wanted to show this to
113:35 - you
113:36 - um
113:37 - i'm going to turn it off now
113:41 - and
113:42 - turn off the monitor
113:44 - and i am going to
113:46 - hi
113:47 - hello i'm going to go back to my
113:49 - computer
113:50 - and
113:52 - run an emulator to show you some of the
113:53 - basic stuff
113:55 - put the monitor in front of the keyboard
113:59 - what does that mean
114:04 - uh
114:06 - yeah chris is writing my grandfather has
114:09 - um an apple
114:11 - two he's keeping as his father's memoirs
114:13 - on the floppy disk so these drives do
114:16 - work
114:17 - um
114:18 - so
114:18 - if i can help you read some discs
114:21 - these drives work but i i don't know
114:23 - that i want to be responsible for
114:25 - some precious
114:27 - uh restoring some precious yes like that
114:29 - okay um
114:30 - oh the cameras wasn't on the monitor
114:32 - well so apologies um i'm to just leave
114:35 - the camera here
114:37 - and i'm going back to
114:38 - my computer
114:41 - let me bring
114:43 - this back with me
114:54 - okay so
114:56 - here i am
114:58 - my computer went to sleep
115:00 - um let's look for
115:11 - so this is one that um
115:13 - this is a great i'm gonna let's use this
115:14 - one
115:16 - because this is a true emulator
115:20 - let's see
115:26 - okay
115:31 - how do i get the dos prompt with this
115:36 - uh
115:38 - do i have to load something
115:43 - i want to load applesoft basic let's see
115:55 - beaglebasic i have the beaglebasic disks
115:58 - let's just go to blank blank to us
116:00 - okay
116:03 - okay great oh no that's not it
116:09 - oh
116:10 - that's what i want
116:24 - oh look at this just i haven't used this
116:26 - emulator before i was using a different
116:28 - emulator but i just found this one
116:38 - oops
116:42 - um
116:54 - i'm confused
116:56 - let's open up beagle basic
117:04 - i'm very confused by this emulator
117:09 - nobody wants to help me in the chat
117:14 - hold on let's
117:15 - uh let's keep looking
117:18 - uh
117:19 - i actually was using this really cool
117:21 - downloadable emulator
117:31 - yeah this is the one i was using
117:33 - this one's pretty wild okay let's try
117:35 - this
117:36 - um
117:41 - so i'm gonna run this emulator i like
117:43 - having it as a totally separate
117:46 - application
117:47 - and i'm sure that i'm gonna have to do
117:49 - this
118:00 - okay we want to do
118:02 - applesoft basic interpreter there we go
118:06 - perfect
118:08 - i'm going to put caps lock on all right
118:11 - we're in business here so let me go to
118:16 - apple basic
118:18 - reference
118:21 - okay this is a pretty good reference
118:25 - all right so i have been studying up on
118:27 - basic in the last couple of weeks so i
118:30 - uh but the one thing i didn't get a
118:31 - chance to experiment with yet is
118:34 - graphics mode and so uh i want to do
118:38 - some programming today
118:41 - in
118:43 - [Music]
118:46 - i want to do some programming today
118:48 - using graphics mode so let's just get
118:50 - started by writing a pro so the way you
118:52 - write a program in basic is you have to
118:54 - give line numbers and um i'm gonna so
118:56 - i'm gonna create line number ten i'm
118:58 - just gonna call home so home is a
119:00 - command by the way that clears the
119:02 - screen
119:03 - if i type list it's going to show me
119:05 - what's in my program if i try run it's
119:08 - going to run my program so
119:10 - um actually we should do 10 print let's
119:12 - try to get 10 print going so if you're
119:14 - so uh let's actually let's do ten print
119:17 - ten print uh coding train so if you
119:20 - remember
119:22 - and this is gonna go to the old website
119:23 - but that's fine um
119:27 - this uh video that i did to create the
119:29 - 10 print algorithm in p5.js using canvas
119:32 - and drawing 10 print comes from the old
119:35 - commodore 64. this famous one line of
119:37 - code that either prints a random forward
119:40 - slash or a backward slash and when you
119:42 - layer that line by line by line it ends
119:44 - up creating this maze pattern
119:46 - so
119:49 - i know that i could say line 20 print
119:54 - slash
119:55 - so if i were to run this program it's
119:57 - going to clear the screen and print a
119:59 - slash and then if i were to say line 30
120:02 - print
120:05 - forward slash
120:08 - then i could say i could
120:11 - run the program let's look at the
120:12 - program again i'm printing
120:14 - backslash and forward slash i could run
120:16 - the program
120:18 - and i wonder if this is big enough for
120:20 - everybody i should maybe zoom in on it
120:22 - and i get backslash and forward slash
120:24 - now
120:25 - how do i print them without the line
120:27 - break if i want multiple calls to print
120:30 - this i actually don't know
120:33 - um
120:40 - so the question is so
120:43 - let's see what happens if
120:46 - i just now add line 40 and i say go to
120:49 - 20.
120:50 - so go to this is like one of the
120:53 - wonderful things about old-timey basic
120:55 - programming
120:56 - is
120:57 - when you get to
121:00 - um
121:02 - the way that you control the flow of a
121:03 - program is by actually referencing
121:05 - specific line numbers so this is now
121:07 - going to be essentially an infinite loop
121:10 - where it's going to clear the screen
121:13 - print backslash print forward slash go
121:15 - to 20.
121:17 - and so now i'm going to hit
121:18 - run
121:20 - and we can see now how would i get it to
121:22 - do that though without the line breaks
121:25 - semicolon at the end i'm being told now
121:27 - i need to control c
121:29 - we'll quit the program
121:32 - so um
121:36 - so if i change it to print
121:39 - forward slash
121:40 - semicolon
121:43 - 30 print
121:45 - backslash
121:49 - semicolon and now run it
121:51 - there we go okay so this is now but i'm
121:54 - obviously not picking them randomly
121:57 - so how do i pick them randomly well
122:00 - there is an r d function in basic
122:04 - um
122:07 - so i know and if somebody in the chat i
122:08 - think just put it in there this could
122:10 - certainly be done the whole point of the
122:12 - whole sort of conceit of the 10 print
122:14 - program is you do it in one line of code
122:16 - but i am going to attempt
122:19 - to do it so written in a lengthier way
122:22 - so the first thing that i want to do is
122:25 - store a random number so i'm going to
122:28 - add a line of code the reason why i let
122:30 - numbered them 10 20 30 40. so i know i
122:32 - knew the line of code needs to go
122:33 - between 10 and 20. so i'm going to make
122:35 - that 15.
122:37 - and i'm going to say let r equal rnd
122:40 - one and i believe
122:43 - um if i were to say print r and d one
122:46 - right you can see it's giving me a
122:48 - random number
122:50 - between zero and one
122:55 - so there already is built into even
122:57 - apple soft basic a random number
123:00 - generator
123:02 - so looking at the program
123:04 - i get this
123:06 - r value which equals random one so now i
123:08 - want to say
123:11 - i'm going to say line
123:12 - uh 16
123:14 - [Music]
123:16 - if
123:20 - r is greater than 0.5
123:23 - then go to
123:24 - 30.
123:26 - so um so basically what i'm doing is
123:29 - this is a very awkward clunky way of
123:30 - doing it but this is fun
123:32 - if
123:37 - if the number is greater than 0.5
123:40 - that's a 50 chance of that skip all the
123:42 - way to line 30
123:44 - which will say
123:46 - print the forward slash
123:49 - now if that's not the case it's not
123:51 - going to go to 30 so it's going to go on
123:53 - to line 20 and print the backslash
123:55 - so then at 25 i should say go to 40.
123:59 - right if we look at this program now
124:01 - this is so wonky but basically i'm
124:04 - saying pick a random number
124:06 - i can zoom into this so i can gesture to
124:07 - a little bit pick a random number if
124:10 - that random is greater than 0.5
124:12 - then skip here to do backslash then we
124:14 - get to here
124:16 - and we go to line oh we don't want to go
124:17 - to line 20. line 40 needs to go back to
124:20 - line 15 now
124:21 - so 40 has to be go to line 15
124:26 - right so
124:27 - if r
124:28 - is greater than 0.5
124:31 - go to print the backslash then
124:33 - get another number if it's not greater
124:36 - than 0.5 we're going to sorry print the
124:38 - forward slash if it's not greater than
124:40 - 0.5 we're going to print the backslash
124:42 - and then i guess this could actually
124:43 - just say go to 15 but i kind of like the
124:45 - idea of like skipping this line because
124:48 - what if there are other things that were
124:49 - supposed to happen
124:50 - so
124:51 - now i am going to run this program
124:56 - and here we go it is
125:00 - ten
125:04 - print oh this is so awesome i didn't
125:07 - realize how happy this was going to make
125:08 - me i think i'd done i should have done
125:10 - that as a coding challenge make a little
125:12 - video i'm going to do apple basic coding
125:14 - challenges um
125:15 - after next week
125:22 - oh my god so fun first of all also like
125:24 - i don't know if you'd see this but i
125:25 - just love the sort of zoomed in look of
125:27 - these
125:28 - these little like rectangular pixels
125:31 - um just so
125:32 - lovely
125:34 - all right so
125:36 - there's so much more i could do with
125:38 - this and demonstrate
125:41 - but i wanted to look at the thing and
125:42 - i've been working with apple basic a lot
125:44 - in the last week
125:46 - but i wanted to look at graphics mode
125:47 - and just see how that was
125:49 - so um
125:52 - can i save this somehow
125:56 - uh save
125:58 - ten print
126:00 - dot
126:01 - what was the there was a a file
126:03 - extension for a basic program i don't
126:05 - remember what it is but now i'm going to
126:06 - do type txt
126:10 - did that actually save it somewhere
126:16 - today 107. yeah
126:18 - yeah look at that i don't know where
126:20 - this is on my computer
126:22 - but that's cool it saved it somewhere
126:25 - i i'll figure out where local tender
126:27 - it's probably just in like a
126:29 - default directory i guess
126:31 - if i were to go to
126:33 - i'm just curious where did it save it
126:43 - coding train micro m810 print.txt
126:46 - awesome that's really cool so i could if
126:49 - i were to say new
126:50 - new is a command that clears your
126:52 - program
126:53 - so there's no problem can i say load ten
126:55 - print
126:56 - dot txt
126:58 - load 10 print dot txt
127:02 - oh man
127:05 - i'm i think to be honest i think what
127:07 - i'm probably going to end up doing
127:10 - is using the computer more as a prop
127:12 - than doing the actual coding more on an
127:15 - emulator
127:16 - um dot um
127:19 - uh
127:20 - so
127:21 - i also um but what i was gonna say is
127:28 - the one that i was using
127:30 - is not a true emulator from what i
127:32 - understand
127:34 - is it this one
127:36 - no yeah this one so this is one that i
127:39 - was using which is really fun because um
127:42 - like it's a little bit easier because i
127:43 - can just sort of like type
127:45 - i have basically access to a more like
127:47 - modern text editor
127:49 - and um so for example now if i were to
127:52 - go and grab this code here paste it in
127:54 - here and hit run
127:56 - like i've got the program running here
127:58 - but it's quite a bit easier for me to
128:00 - like mess around with it you know i
128:02 - could say like oh let's change this to
128:03 - 0.75
128:05 - and now i'm much more likely to have the
128:06 - forward slash
128:08 - et cetera et cetera by the way one thing
128:10 - that i found interesting is that there's
128:13 - no native apple basic delay function and
128:17 - the way that you would write a delay
128:18 - function i'm going to show you
128:20 - is uh let's let's make 45
128:24 - go to 15
128:25 - i'm gonna say four
128:28 - um
128:29 - i i forget i forget
128:34 - equals one two
128:36 - five thousand
128:39 - next uh
128:42 - next i
128:43 - so the way to do a delay is just to
128:45 - build into your code like a loop where
128:47 - nothing happens so let's just see what
128:49 - this does
128:51 - right so now i have like this slight
128:53 - delay that's doing them just like line
128:55 - by line but i look there's no weight
128:57 - there's no sleep nothing like that an
128:59 - apple basic
129:00 - i think this is actually weirdly enough
129:02 - the standard way to do it also i should
129:04 - point out then this is what i can do i
129:06 - can also make like
129:08 - i can put this as a function now it's
129:10 - not really a function but i can take
129:11 - this line of code and put it at like
129:13 - line 1000 then i can add a return
129:16 - statement right after it
129:18 - and so
129:19 - now i can use the go sub
129:22 - go sub is like a way of calling a
129:24 - function go to a subroutine this is a
129:26 - subroutine with line numbers much higher
129:28 - later
129:30 - that i can run this code and then return
129:32 - will send me back so this if i just
129:34 - wanted to make it a slight delay let's
129:36 - change it to 500
129:39 - this would work
129:40 - pretty interesting stuff huh so i would
129:42 - love to build out like full projects
129:46 - with
129:48 - with apple basic
129:50 - okay
129:53 - [Music]
129:57 - so
129:58 - now what did i want to do i wanted to
130:00 - look at and i'm going to take a little
130:02 - bit of time here
130:03 - to look at
130:05 - the graphics mode
130:08 - so let's see let's use this
130:11 - gr
130:12 - set display to mixed test low resolution
130:16 - graphics
130:17 - clear to black
130:21 - so
130:22 - oh
130:24 - um so let's try and can i make this
130:27 - bigger well yeah i can i should have
130:29 - just done that in the first place
130:33 - okay so let's try
130:35 - saying by the way i think no let's try
130:37 - saying 10
130:38 - home
130:39 - 20 gr
130:42 - oh let me let me say a new program
130:47 - there's nothing in there right now i'm
130:49 - going to say 10 home 20 gr
130:53 - and then let's try just doing
130:59 - a
131:00 - point
131:03 - zero to thirty nine
131:05 - oh is it forty by forty
131:08 - color equals
131:10 - color i don't have color here
131:12 - let's try just doing
131:14 - plot
131:16 - uh 10
131:18 - oh do i do this plot 10 comma 10.
131:24 - plot expects two or three parameters at
131:27 - line
131:29 - 30.
131:36 - oh the graphics mode is still in there
131:38 - how do i get out of graphics mode
131:42 - ooh that's not what i meant to do
131:48 - uh
131:50 - how do you exit graphics mode
132:06 - another reference
132:12 - oh
132:12 - peek and poke i remember those
132:15 - plot graphics
132:17 - oh this is more stuff
132:21 - uh
132:26 - um
132:30 - okay
132:32 - uh clears text mode
132:36 - so maybe i do that
132:38 - so like
132:41 - ah yes whoa that's cool
132:45 - okay
132:46 - so i lost my code
132:48 - gr
132:52 - plot oh plot no parentheses
132:55 - plot
132:57 - uh 10 comma 10.
132:59 - oh 20.
133:01 - oh wait can i just hold on a second
133:06 - so let's just
133:07 - so one of the nice things about apple
133:09 - basic is i can just i don't need to
133:11 - write it as a program so i'm just
133:12 - putting this off to the side
133:14 - i can just write the commands now can
133:16 - you see this in the bottom here okay so
133:18 - let's try doing plot
133:25 - i don't see anything let's try the line
133:28 - h line
133:33 - from 0 to 40
133:35 - at 10.
133:38 - oh i have to set a color
133:40 - maybe it's like black
133:46 - ah whoa
133:51 - cool
133:58 - ah
133:59 - i see
134:03 - h plot
134:07 - plots a dot what is the difference
134:08 - between h plot and plot
134:14 - h plot x one y one two x two y two
134:24 - whoops i think i crashed it
134:37 - whoa
134:38 - yeah each plot is not where it's
134:40 - crashing it
134:43 - that's interesting
134:46 - i was going to try to do like um
134:51 - um i was going to i was going to try to
134:53 - make a little like snake game like thing
134:56 - so let's just do 10 let's try writing
134:58 - this program 10
135:00 - gr
135:02 - 20 let
135:03 - x equal 10
135:05 - 30
135:06 - let y equal 10
135:10 - um
135:13 - 40
135:14 - um
135:17 - well let's let's do a random walk
135:20 - x equals x plus r and d
135:23 - 1
135:28 - minus
135:29 - 0.5 oh no r and d times 2
135:32 - minus 1.
135:35 - y equals y
135:37 - plus r and d
135:40 - times 2 minus 1.
135:44 - 60
135:45 - color equals i'm just going to do 1
135:48 - because i don't know what else to do and
135:50 - then 70 is plot now let's see if it can
135:53 - handle floating points and just like
135:55 - take off the decimal point
135:58 - and then 80 would be
136:00 - go to
136:02 - 40.
136:06 - all right
136:07 - should we give this a try
136:10 - anybody see anything i got wrong
136:17 - what happens when it goes off
136:26 - this is wild
136:28 - it's somehow like
136:31 - cycling around the edges automatically
136:35 - that is crazy okay
136:38 - how do i clear
136:40 - uh
136:43 - clear there must be like a hole clear
136:51 - full screen graphics
136:54 - mixed mode color on the screen
136:57 - oh you can actually get the pixel color
136:59 - at a given pixel that's wild
137:03 - um
137:04 - set the rotation to x for shape drawing
137:09 - do i have shape drawing
137:13 - so i don't believe
137:16 - i don't believe the argument i'm passing
137:18 - into rand is actually the range
137:21 - um let's look at the rand function
137:24 - i haven't gone through this in a lot of
137:25 - detail let's see if we can find it this
137:28 - is the actual documentation here if x is
137:31 - greater than zero a random number
137:33 - between zero and one
137:34 - if x equals zero repeats the last random
137:37 - number
137:38 - and if x is less than zero begins new
137:41 - repeatable sequence so the argument is
137:43 - more about seeding the random
137:46 - the random value
137:48 - oh look i have math functions
137:54 - so the other thing i wanted to do is so
137:56 - let's
137:59 - let's go back
138:00 - to um
138:02 - so i wanted to see if i could get
138:04 - keyboard control
138:06 - so i believe
138:08 - oops do not want to print
138:14 - i i see remember peak
138:16 - is a way to look at the value in a given
138:19 - memory address
138:21 - and there is a memory address for the
138:23 - last key pressed i believe
138:26 - so
138:27 - [Music]
138:28 - peak apple
138:30 - basic
138:31 - key
138:32 - press
138:38 - uh
138:42 - whoa
138:45 - there's actually a
138:56 - um
138:58 - i've seen when i was looking the other
139:00 - day i saw in a manual
139:05 - a page that described
139:10 - oh tetris for apple basic that would be
139:12 - fun to try
139:14 - um
139:20 - oh so i'm just taking a peek i'm taking
139:22 - a peek at the chat
139:24 - uh
139:26 - applesoft is what i'm looking for
139:32 - this is what i was looking at maybe
139:37 - the big tip book the funny thing is i
139:38 - have manuals for apple basic and stuff
139:40 - just sitting over there
139:42 - i'm
139:43 - uh
139:44 - somewhere was it in this book
139:48 - there was like a chart for peak and poke
139:50 - well this is wild
140:00 - i mean really like
140:02 - in the dawn of personal computers you
140:05 - you had to programming was the whole
140:07 - point yeah look at this the lay loops
140:10 - look
140:13 - your apple doesn't mind in fact it's
140:15 - good for him slash her i think them
140:17 - would be the would be more appropriate
140:19 - okay
140:20 - print peek 51
140:23 - what language you're using okay
140:28 - oh i need to go sub poker
140:31 - integer basic i want to
140:33 - [Music]
140:37 - uh
140:38 - memory and speed
140:42 - look at this
140:44 - this is incredible
140:46 - oh i need to read this whole thing
140:56 - look at this tip
140:58 - clear mem
141:01 - i'm expander
141:03 - like right i mean there's like literally
141:05 - 48 kilobytes
141:07 - of ram
141:08 - oh that apple 2 plus
141:11 - you know this computer has what eight
141:13 - eight gigabytes of ram
141:15 - 80 columns okay
141:17 - 40 columns this is for the text
141:20 - um
141:25 - too long i'm like
141:28 - text tips
141:31 - page inverse inverse typer
141:35 - input oh right input a oh that's fun
141:38 - to reverse what you type in that would
141:39 - that's a fun little challenge
141:42 - text screen
141:47 - um
141:49 - peak 49152
142:00 - yeah
142:01 - this is the old 49512
142:12 - let's see it read slot regain paddle
142:14 - toggle speaker
142:16 - read keyboard here it is
142:19 - if 127 the key has been pressed okay
142:22 - four nine five one two
142:24 - so
142:26 - uh
142:30 - so 40 will be i'm going to say
142:34 - let's c
142:38 - equal peak
142:40 - 49512
142:44 - um
142:45 - [Music]
142:47 - and then actually so let's
142:50 - let's do this um hold on ctrl c well
142:53 - that's fine put it in there
142:54 - um
142:56 - 50 print
143:02 - c so that's fine i'm just plotting it
143:06 - just should be printing over and over
143:07 - again what key was pressed let's see
143:11 - a
143:13 - b
143:13 - [Music]
143:16 - why am i only getting 136.
143:36 - one five not five one
143:39 - what was it
143:41 - four nine one five two no wonder
143:48 - thank you
143:50 - 32
143:52 - yeah okay
143:53 - now we get different numbers
143:55 - there's no reason why i can't convert
143:57 - that into a character
144:06 - and i should be able to say
144:08 - let's see now a string
144:11 - in apple b in basic you have to indicate
144:14 - the type of what's in the variable by so
144:16 - i can have c would be the number
144:18 - and this would be i believe there's a
144:20 - function yeah it's actually filling this
144:21 - in for me
144:23 - where i can do this
144:24 - but i think i need to subtract 127 from
144:27 - it well let's not bother to try let's
144:29 - just see what happens first
144:31 - um
144:34 - so now
144:36 - um
144:37 - 55 is
144:42 - um print
144:45 - let's print that
144:52 - all right so i have an x and a y
144:56 - i'm peeking out what's in the keyboard
144:58 - converting it to a character
145:00 - and again there's a lot of wasted memory
145:02 - here so but i'm just writing out the
145:04 - long printing it out and plotting x
145:07 - so let's run this now k a
145:10 - b c d e f g h i j k l n n o p perfect
145:16 - i don't know why i saw that somewhere i
145:18 - was looking at some examples they were
145:20 - subtracting 127 but maybe that was
145:22 - doing like lower lowercase or something
145:23 - okay so now
145:25 - oh what are the arrow keys oh this is a
145:28 - problem if i want to use the arrow keys
145:33 - i'm not seeing anything here u
145:36 - k
145:37 - j
145:38 - this is weird well let's just use wasd
145:42 - i'm going to do that
145:45 - okay so um i keep having clear which
145:48 - doesn't do anything
145:52 - so now what i want to do is say
145:57 - 56 if
145:59 - c
146:01 - equals a
146:03 - then x equals x plus 1.
146:06 - no no x minus 1.
146:11 - 57 if c
146:13 - equals d
146:15 - then x equals x plus 1.
146:20 - 58
146:22 - if c this is very bad that i'm how i'm
146:24 - doing this c equals w
146:26 - then y equals y minus 1. i assume
146:31 - it counts from top to bottom just like
146:33 - modern graphics windows
146:35 - if c
146:38 - equals
146:40 - s
146:43 - then y equals y plus 1.
146:48 - all right
146:50 - um
146:51 - so
146:52 - i start at 10 comma 10
146:54 - i look at what's in the keyboard convert
146:56 - it to a character
146:58 - and then i'm checking if i do a d wrs
147:02 - and then changing the x and y values
147:04 - accordingly
147:05 - okay
147:08 - old school is z x for left right and p l
147:11 - for up down yeah
147:13 - so let's do this
147:18 - now
147:22 - why is this not working
147:26 - okay
147:27 - we gotta debug
147:42 - um
147:43 - okay i have an idea
148:09 - so i'm going to debug by printing both
148:11 - what's in c and the value
148:14 - of the boolean
148:16 - expression
148:19 - c
148:20 - equals the boolean test i don't think
148:22 - there's any double equals in old timey
148:24 - basic
148:27 - oh
148:28 - whoops
148:32 - what just happened here
148:35 - i'm so confused
148:47 - hold on this is why i want to use that
148:49 - other emulator because ah
148:52 - let me just try something here
148:55 - will you please let me copy paste this
148:58 - no it won't let's do save
149:06 - uh
149:10 - i'm setting c to a i don't think so
149:19 - there is no
149:21 - there is no a boolean expression oh but
149:24 - the printing
149:25 - might not work because i've done this
149:30 - that's not true
149:35 - that's true
149:56 - so this is what i'm doing in the code i
149:59 - want to print the value of the variable
150:00 - test
150:02 - and the colon allows me to do oh
150:05 - not colon semicolon semicolon
150:09 - colon
150:11 - allows me to put so that is setting c
150:14 - equal to a
150:16 - so that definitely was setting c equal
150:18 - to a
150:19 - this is what i meant to do
150:21 - a1 ah
150:25 - so this should be
150:26 - print c
150:29 - semicolon a space
150:32 - semicolon
150:34 - c
150:35 - equals a
150:38 - all right now this i should be able to
150:40 - debug
150:43 - yes
150:45 - huh
150:48 - so it
150:49 - seems to be now it seems to be working
150:52 - uh
150:54 - but i
150:58 - i'm so confused
151:03 - yeah yeah yeah
151:05 - yeah if you're constantly reading the
151:06 - last key pressed
151:10 - yeah i wonder if
151:13 - it makes sense for me to
151:18 - um
151:26 - only do it if there's a new i have an
151:28 - idea oh this is so
151:31 - so crazy
151:35 - what if unfortunately i could put a
151:36 - delay in there but i have a weird idea
151:39 - what if i were to say
151:42 - let's say 35
151:44 - let
151:47 - i know what to call this i'm going to
151:48 - call it direction
151:52 - and i'm going to set it equal to
151:54 - just
151:56 - zero
151:57 - so i'm going to start with a direction
151:59 - of zero
152:01 - and i'm going to say
152:06 - after i read the character and let's
152:09 - just change 40 to be let c
152:12 - equal cr hr string
152:15 - peak
152:16 - 4
152:17 - 4
152:18 - 4 9 1 5 2. so there was really no reason
152:21 - for me to have line 40 and 50. i could
152:24 - do it all at once
152:29 - so line 50 can now be
152:32 - if
152:35 - c
152:39 - is
152:40 - equal
152:43 - to the direction
152:47 - then
152:48 - set the direction
152:52 - back equal to
152:54 - zero
152:56 - so like
152:57 - oops
152:59 - i'm sort of thinking this through as i'm
153:01 - doing it
153:03 - so i want to do something where if the
153:06 - character is what it was last
153:09 - then direction is zero
153:12 - and then i can say
153:18 - um
153:21 - go to
153:26 - let's do 55 go to
153:29 - 56.
153:32 - uh
153:35 - all right
153:36 - so
153:38 - i'm starting with the direction and then
153:42 - but
153:44 - oh
153:45 - oh no no no no
153:47 - [Music]
153:51 - no no no no
153:52 - do i need to go sub can i do two things
153:54 - with a then
153:56 - i think i can like can i say
153:59 - if c
154:00 - is equal to dir
154:03 - if it's the same then
154:06 - oh why don't i just go to
154:09 - just skip go to line 80 like don't draw
154:11 - anything new
154:13 - just skip everything that's fine
154:15 - and then
154:16 - 55 i want to say
154:19 - dir
154:22 - equals
154:25 - c
154:26 - so get the new thing
154:30 - and then oh i should have i already have
154:32 - to rewrite all these lines of code
154:37 - oh that's terrible see this is
154:39 - my kingdom for a code editor
154:41 - if dir dollar sign
154:45 - equals a
154:51 - hold on let me just look at this and see
154:53 - if this is right
154:55 - so i'm starting at 10 comma 10 and i'm
154:58 - starting with don't move anywhere then
155:00 - i'm going to read
155:02 - the current character if it's a new
155:04 - character then set that to its direction
155:07 - execute the move
155:09 - plot the thing
155:10 - go back to read another character now if
155:12 - it's the same character it's going to
155:14 - skip
155:15 - okay i think this is right so i just
155:17 - think unfortunately
155:19 - i have to the way i wrote this
155:24 - there's got to be a different way of
155:26 - doing this but
155:39 - and y equals y minus 1.
155:44 - i hate that i have no
155:46 - lines left in between if d i r equals
155:51 - s
155:52 - then y
156:01 - am i missing a parenthesis on lines 56
156:04 - to 59
156:05 - no there are no parentheses around
156:08 - boolean expressions in basic
156:10 - and also like why
156:13 - no this does nothing i guess i just i
156:16 - just the lines of code are too long
156:19 - um
156:23 - okay
156:28 - wait i need some debugging
156:33 - uh
156:37 - so what do i need to do i want to
156:43 - line 45
156:45 - print
156:47 - what it's reading
156:52 - and
156:53 - let's print
156:54 - that and
156:56 - d
156:59 - this is what it's reading
157:01 - and this is the current value of dir
157:09 - so it's reading d
157:11 - and it is d
157:22 - but why is nothing moving
157:34 - oh
157:44 - there should be
157:48 - yeah i'm busy
157:56 - once i get a new character
157:59 - it should go do the things all right
158:01 - let's
158:03 - let's
158:04 - i just want to like enter in 45
158:09 - um
158:10 - how do i delete a line can i just do
158:11 - this
158:14 - 45 is gone now
158:16 - let's print
158:22 - um
158:26 - let's print do we ever get here
158:36 - do we ever get here
158:42 - do we ever get to the point
158:46 - we should as soon as we get a character
158:47 - that's new we should get
158:54 - there yeah
159:00 - okay so every time we type in a new
159:02 - character i'm seeing the old let's be
159:04 - methodical about this
159:06 - a
159:07 - b
159:08 - c
159:09 - d e f that makes sense
159:12 - c d uh every time i k um
159:16 - oh hold on why is this
159:19 - this is backwards
159:21 - use ren to renumber the program
159:25 - oh
159:27 - your character quality check
159:30 - yeah the character oh maybe the
159:31 - character equality check isn't right
159:34 - okay hold on
159:36 - hold on
159:38 - ah no oh no i lost it i lost it i typed
159:42 - exit just like instinctually
159:44 - and i hadn't saved it it just like quit
159:47 - oh my god i lost all my code
159:51 - right
159:52 - it's gone completely gone
159:57 - oh it's like i'm like i don't know why i
159:59 - typed that it was just like it came out
160:00 - of my brain
160:03 - okay hold on
160:05 - uh
160:08 - wait i don't know why we're converting a
160:10 - key press to a character
160:13 - yeah
160:15 - because i don't want to have to like
160:17 - check the number
160:20 - oh that's why there's -127
160:25 - maybe
160:26 - i didn't save it to test i'd saved there
160:29 - was that test.txt but that was
160:33 - that was oh that's actually okay so hold
160:35 - on
160:40 - all right let's
160:43 - oh it's not letting me copy paste
160:46 - all right let's go back to just for
160:49 - because it's all 140 and i really got to
160:50 - get going here
160:52 - um i'm gonna cheat a little bit
160:55 - no no i'm not i i gotta get this done
160:58 - okay
161:01 - i'll just use this as a reference i'm a
161:02 - fast typer
161:05 - i'm a fast typer
161:09 - so let me actually not do all of this
161:11 - because
161:12 - let's do 4 c40
161:15 - let c
161:17 - equal i want to try it just with my
161:19 - converting it
161:21 - uh
161:23 - let's what if i do this let's let's try
161:25 - with my converting it
161:28 - let c equal
161:31 - oh sorry peak
161:34 - 4 9 1 5 2.
161:43 - if
161:45 - c
161:47 - equals a
161:50 - print a
161:53 - and you know that let's just try this
161:59 - 60 go to
162:01 - 40.
162:12 - i keep letting exit again what's wrong
162:14 - with me
162:16 - what
162:18 - what is why am i doing that
162:20 - ah
162:22 - it's like some weird instinct home is
162:24 - what i'm trying to type oh my god
162:28 - everybody
162:29 - stay calm
162:36 - okay
162:37 - uh
163:00 - oh peek
163:02 - i clearly i need to eat lunch
163:08 - i'm
163:12 - all right
163:16 - sorry everybody
163:23 - okay
163:24 - now whatever i type
163:27 - goes in here okay
163:32 - um
163:33 - now
163:56 - yes so
164:00 - whatever i'm getting is not equal to the
164:02 - a character
164:05 - it's easier to work with the underlying
164:06 - number i know that's what i should do
164:09 - but i have a feeling
164:23 - this is what it
164:26 - wants me to do
164:51 - oh just one parenthesis there okay
165:02 - all right fine we're gonna work with the
165:03 - number
165:06 - okay
165:07 - good idea
165:11 - oh wait no
165:20 - 65.
165:51 - four nine
166:04 - ah 193
166:07 - yeah
166:09 - 193
166:13 - 127 right no 128
166:20 - 128
166:22 - okay
166:27 - okay
166:29 - let's go into graphics mode
166:40 - uh oh you know i could do the arrow keys
166:42 - then
166:48 - 139 136 149 138
166:54 - 136 is left
167:02 - 149
167:05 - is right
167:09 - up is 1
167:11 - whoops
167:14 - 149 is right 136 up is 139
167:21 - and down is 138 okay
167:24 - okay
167:29 - okay everybody here we go ready
167:32 - uh
167:37 - so oh man i had all that code so i've
167:39 - gotta rethink that logic
167:41 - so
167:44 - what i wanna have is
167:46 - a variable dir the let is optional by
167:49 - the way dir is zero
167:52 - um
167:54 - oops
167:55 - i didn't mean to overwrite that and then
167:59 - 50 c equals peak 49152
168:05 - if
168:06 - dir equals
168:08 - c
168:11 - then
168:12 - go to
168:13 - 40. just go back
168:15 - keep reading from the keyboard until
168:17 - there's something new
168:27 - oops
168:31 - if i forgot to do a line number dr
168:32 - equals c go to
168:34 - just go back to reading whoops
168:38 - oh lets me do the up arrow that's so
168:41 - nice
168:42 - can you really do that on an apple ii
168:43 - plus
168:45 - okay
168:47 - 193.
168:51 - okay
168:52 - so go back to 40.
168:56 - otherwise keep going and say if dir
169:00 - is equal to 136
169:03 - x equals x
169:05 - plus one
169:10 - no minus one
169:13 - and let's just only do that right now
169:16 - then 80
169:18 - 80 90 100 so let's say 110
169:21 - color equals one
169:23 - 120 plot x comma y
169:27 - 130 go to
169:33 - oh don't this shouldn't be go to 40 it
169:35 - needs to be go to 50 but let's this is
169:37 - go to 50
169:39 - and 60 let's just do this let's always
169:42 - draw it if dir equals c go to 120
169:46 - or go to 110.
169:48 - so i'm going to be drawing over itself
169:50 - but that's fine then i need it then also
169:52 - i needed that
169:55 - save
169:57 - uh snake dot txt okay
170:00 - in case i lose it again okay go to
170:02 - graphics mode
170:05 - start at 10 comma 10.
170:07 - start without moving
170:09 - check the key board
170:11 - if
170:12 - the keyboard is something new
170:15 - great
170:16 - based on what it is oh only if it's to
170:18 - the left move to the left and draw it
170:20 - then check the keyboard again let's see
170:23 - you have bad code on line 193 now
170:25 - there's no more line 193
170:28 - dir will be zero oh right
170:31 - sorry so 65 i need to say dir equals c
170:36 - thank you that's
170:38 - something i missed
170:40 - so i if it's a new thing i pick up that
170:42 - value
170:45 - lot syntax error line 70.
170:48 - oh
170:50 - uh text
170:54 - if oh i forgot that then if dir equals
170:57 - 136
171:00 - then x equals x minus one
171:03 - no parentheses
171:06 - oh no but that's on the line ah
171:08 - 70.
171:10 - if dir equals 136
171:12 - then x
171:14 - equals x minus 1. okay
171:19 - and let's just add some more of them i
171:20 - can type fast 80 if dir equals 149 then
171:26 - x equals x plus 1
171:28 - 90 if
171:30 - dir
171:31 - equals 139
171:33 - then y
171:34 - equals y minus 1
171:37 - 100 if
171:38 - dir equals 138 then y equals y plus 1.
171:48 - all right here's the whole program
171:55 - clear oh there's poke 49168 to clear the
171:58 - keyboard oh i could have done that
172:01 - i actually just done that but that's
172:03 - fine that's good to know that would be a
172:04 - better solution
172:06 - so just always clear the keyboard but
172:09 - why are some then
172:11 - oh so i'm doing everything in all
172:13 - capitals
172:14 - because my apple ii plus doesn't support
172:16 - lowercase
172:18 - my older one but um this emulator does
172:22 - so uh but it's not case sensitive i
172:25 - don't even think variable names are case
172:26 - sensitive
172:30 - yeah
172:33 - yeah variable names are not nothing's
172:34 - case sensitive
172:36 - let's try running it
172:40 - oh all right
172:44 - oh i can't do it
172:47 - i can't do it more than once in a row
172:51 - oh this is so silly it's not just a new
172:53 - one
172:57 - so i do need this clear keyboard thing
173:01 - so
173:12 - so for the ren does that renumber
173:18 - oh it renumbered everything for me
173:21 - look at that
173:23 - so that's really useful renumber will
173:25 - just take all my weird lines of code and
173:27 - renumber everything and even the go to's
173:29 - are all updated
173:31 - don't type exit don't type exit
173:34 - you want to clear the keyboard and reset
173:37 - dir yeah so what was clearing the
173:39 - keyboard poke
173:41 - right
173:44 - so after i draw
173:48 - let's say poke
173:50 - what was it
173:57 - what was it
173:58 - clear keyboard
174:02 - clear keyboard
174:04 - 49168 comma zero
174:10 - four nine one six eight comma zero
174:17 - so
174:18 - then
174:20 - 103 0 i don't need
174:23 - oh no no no no yeah 103 0 i don't need
174:26 - then 1040 let's say dir equals peak
174:30 - 49152
174:33 - and then
174:34 - get rid of 106 0.
174:38 - so i'm just getting the keyboard
174:42 - i don't need 105 0.
174:46 - i'm getting the keyboard i'm getting the
174:48 - direction
174:50 - moving x and y plotting it clearing the
174:53 - keyboard and then going back
175:01 - oh there we go
175:04 - well that was much easier
175:08 - than i thought
175:11 - so i could definitely do the snake game
175:12 - now i need an array and some other stuff
175:18 - all right
175:19 - look at that
175:24 - oh so many possibilities
175:26 - save it yes
175:33 - keyboard draw i don't know what to call
175:35 - this
175:40 - all right everybody
175:44 - i don't know what i did with today
175:46 - i hope you enjoy tuning in it seems to
175:48 - be a lot of people watching so let's
175:50 - before i go
175:52 - let's do another round of gifting
175:54 - memberships all right everybody
175:56 - this is way too much fun
175:58 - for me not to just do that okay before i
176:01 - go don't leave people
176:05 - don't leave
176:07 - because i am
176:08 - about to gift
176:14 - here we go everybody
176:23 - okay
176:25 - uh thank you to brilliant for sponsoring
176:27 - today's live stream check brilliant out
176:28 - at brilliant.org codingtrain
176:31 - uh lots of fun math and science and
176:33 - probability based things to learn
176:35 - uh i'm seeing all the gifts go to focus
176:38 - on me junaid rigid abhishek
176:42 - astro penguin gulam
176:45 - jason khon ryan eru
176:51 - [Music]
176:54 - you've just won
176:56 - a membership the coding train don't
176:58 - really get anything with it but you can
177:00 - try syncing your
177:02 - youtube account with your discord
177:03 - account you know
177:05 - in theory members get stickers but you
177:07 - have to be kind of a member for a few
177:09 - months
177:10 - so uh you know maybe go easy on the
177:13 - requesting the stickers if you just got
177:14 - my little membership gift
177:18 - um
177:20 - but uh thanks everybody i um i should be
177:23 - back
177:24 - so the so the monty hall problem video
177:26 - came out the wave function collapse
177:28 - video is currently 90 minutes long
177:30 - actually what i could have been doing
177:32 - for the last hour was watching it
177:34 - through and kind of like finding some
177:35 - more things to edit out
177:37 - um
177:38 - but and i think it's going to be at
177:39 - least another week or so before that's
177:41 - ready um but there's a a big video on a
177:44 - long video on coding a wave function
177:46 - collapse algorithm from start to finish
177:49 - that will be coming out soon on the
177:50 - coding train
177:51 - um thank you everybody uh if you enjoyed
177:54 - this like coding in apple basic let me
177:56 - know because i think i would actually
177:58 - like to do some videos where i'm just
178:00 - building projects in apple basic those
178:02 - will come later
178:03 - after i do this nebula class
178:06 - but um
178:08 - but yeah so
178:09 - um thanks everybody um i really
178:12 - appreciate you i appreciate you being
178:14 - here i appreciate you watching my videos

178:23 - i don't know what you're referring to dj
178:25 - mangus and i'm sorry that i didn't have
178:27 - discord open

178:30 - um
178:31 - everybody say a prayer
178:33 - for my
178:36 - um
178:39 - apple ii oh that's just the power supply
178:41 - apple ii plus computer

178:45 - um
178:46 - oh and jason is wearing your refactor it
178:48 - now t-shirt so thank you everybody
178:50 - i will see you
178:52 - next time on
178:54 - the coding train hopefully
178:58 - everything goes well next week i'll be
178:59 - back live streaming next friday no more
179:03 - i i misread that no apple basic you said
179:06 - more apple basic all right more apple
