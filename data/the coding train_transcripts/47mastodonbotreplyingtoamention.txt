00:00 - (whistle tooting)
00:01 - - Hello, welcome to video number
7,629 about Mastadon bots.
00:07 - (Daniel laughing)
00:08 - I have been on a journey, a journey
00:10 - (imitates train clacking)
00:11 - on along the tracks of Mastadon.
00:13 - And I started from
nowhere and I have arrived
00:17 - to the point where I have a bot.
00:18 - It's called codingtrainbot,
and what this bot does,
00:21 - if you follow the bot,
it says, welcome aboard.
00:24 - And if you toot at the bot
and use a certain keyword,
00:28 - it will favorite or re-toot, boost,
00:31 - whatever it is, your particular post.
00:34 - And I want to add one more thing to it.
00:37 - So, I want to be able to
respond to a question.
00:40 - So, let's just say, I'm
going to look for any post
00:44 - at me that ends with a question mark.
00:47 - This is going to be tricky cause
there's the html tags in it.
00:49 - I'm just going to look
for a question mark,
00:51 - I'll let you make this fancier.
00:53 - So let's add one more check.
00:57 - I'm going to
01:00 - constant regex3.
01:02 - I'm just going to look
for a question mark.
01:06 - Oh, question mark is a metacharacter,
01:09 - so I think I might have to do this, \?
01:13 - So I want to look for a question mark, if
01:18 - regex3
01:21 - matches the content.
01:24 - And by the way, this is, by the way,
01:27 - this is like the very
basics of making a chatbot,
01:30 - which is just doing
basic pattern matching.
01:34 - Now chatbot systems use machine learning
01:36 - and try to categorize
what people are saying
01:39 - into intense and do all
sorts of text analysis,
01:42 - but at a core level, you could
just use regular expressions
01:45 - to try to match what somebody's saying
01:47 - and respond accordingly.
01:48 - And if you, I do have a set
of videos about Rivescript,
01:51 - which is a pattern matching utility
01:54 - that you can use in any programming,
01:55 - a number of programming
languages, but you can use it
01:57 - in Javascript, to build your own chatbot.
01:58 - So this is interesting to think about,
02:00 - what do you want your bot to actually do,
02:04 - but in this case, I'm just going
to use regular expressions.
02:06 - I'm going to look for a question mark.
02:08 - So let me just actually
make sure this works.
02:10 - I'm going to say, I got a question.
02:14 - And let me look at the content.
02:17 - So I think I'm going to
not always console.log
02:21 - the content anymore,
I know that's working.
02:25 - Now I want to just look
at it, console.log, data,
02:29 - what was it called that
I put it in a variable?
02:31 - Content.
02:32 - So I'm just going to look at the content.
02:34 - So I am now going to run this.
02:37 - You know, by the way, if
you're doing this on your own,
02:39 - you're going to want to have
a second Mastadon account
02:41 - (laughing) where you can then test it.
02:43 - I am a weird, crazy
person who does this sort
02:45 - of stuff on a live stream, apparently.
02:47 - I just assume that the people
out in the world watching
02:50 - will interact and hopefully be kind.
02:54 - Okay, now, let us run it again.
02:57 - Let's see if we can get some mentions
02:59 - with a question mark in them
and see if, oh there we go.
03:04 - So, I got a question.
03:05 - Okay, oo, that's interesting.
03:09 - Oh, I got a question, that's
not what somebody said to me.
03:12 - Why, with a question mark.
03:13 - Okay, so that seems to be working,
03:15 - so I'm going to assume that that's good.
03:16 - Thank you for that.
03:17 - And now, what I want to
do, is I want to say,
03:22 - I want to do, I want to
create, sorry, a reply.
03:28 - So I'm going to say, reply equals
03:33 - the meaning of life is,
and I'm going to use this,
03:38 - oh I have this from before
by accident, luckily, is num
03:46 - and then I want to just send
that reply, but here's the thing.
03:49 - A couple things.
03:50 - One is I want to mention that person.
03:52 - So I did that before when
somebody followed me,
03:56 - so I can do at and then the account,
03:58 - which I should still have, hmmm.
04:01 - I didn't actually save the account,
04:03 - so if somebody mentions me,
where do I get the account?
04:07 - Data account, accounts, the same thing.
04:10 - So I can actually go
back, msg.data.account.
04:13 - Actually, I think I kind
of like always want this,
04:17 - whether it is a follow or a mention.
04:19 - Whoops!
04:21 - So I'm going to put this out here
04:23 - so I have access to that account.
04:24 - Sorry that the font got smaller here,
04:26 - hopefully you can still read it.
04:28 - So, I want to first mention
04:32 - that account and then
say, but here's the thing,
04:37 - you can mention, but it's not going
04:40 - to actually understand
it as a threaded reply
04:43 - unless I include in reply to id.
04:47 - So I actually also need to get the id,
04:50 - which I have here, msg.data.status.id,
04:54 - so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to overload
04:58 - this function with a second argument, id.
05:01 - And I'm going to say, in_reply_to,
05:06 - we got to look at the documentation,
05:07 - I don't remember what it
is, but if I look here,
05:11 - oh, it's actually over here.
05:14 - in_reply_to or reply_to.
05:18 - Oh no, I'm in the wrong place,
05:20 - oh, I'm totally in the wrong,
05:21 - but I was in the right place before!
05:22 - in_reply, there we go.
05:24 - I'm looking for in_reply_to_id,
05:27 - so I want to grab this and
I want to put this here,
05:31 - and then I want to put in the id.
05:34 - And I guess what I want to do is,
05:37 - the thing is, I'm going to do it this,
05:39 - this is a little goofy,
I probably could use
05:41 - some fancy ternary operators or something,
05:43 - but I'm just going to say,
05:46 - if id exists,
05:48 - then I'm going to add it.
05:50 - params.in_reply_to_id equals id.
05:53 - So it's, based on
whether or not, if I send
05:56 - into this function, I'm
always going to send
05:58 - into this function some
content that I want to toot,
06:02 - but if there's an id, I
also want to add that in.
06:04 - So now, we should be good.
06:08 - If somebody asks a question,
we are now replying
06:11 - with at that person, oh
and this should have an at.
06:15 - At that person, did I do that up here?
06:19 - Yes, at account.
06:21 - So at account, the meaning of
life is, and then the number.
06:24 - Okay, here we go.
06:26 - Let's actually run this.
06:27 - You can now ask me your questions.
06:30 - And I will wait.
06:31 - (peppy music)
06:33 - Alright, I'm back and a bunch of people,
06:35 - or at least two, I got two mentions,
06:38 - so if I go back now and
look at my bot account,
06:42 - hopefully it's not too spammy.
06:44 - Are you for real?
06:46 - And then if we look at this, we can see
06:47 - the meaning of life is 40.
06:50 - And this one has a
question like this, Yes?
06:54 - You can see the meaning of life is 65.
06:56 - And I'm just curious if somebody,
06:58 - I was looking for one that
also has the (laughs).
07:01 - So this one, for example,
some fake danshiffman,
07:05 - this one was both favorited
and boosted and replied to.
07:11 - So this bot will actually
do all of the things.
07:14 - It is now a bot, oh look at this.
07:17 - Oh, I'm just going to
favorite this manually.
07:19 - By the way, everyone should look
07:20 - at Alca's pannable Lissajous
table, it's wonderful.
07:24 - I will be releasing my lissajous coding
07:26 - challenge video very soon.
07:29 - And here you go.
07:30 - So this is it.
07:31 - We have now finished this up.
07:32 - We now have made a bot.
07:34 - We've seen how a bot can post periodically
07:37 - with set interval something,
and you might come up
07:39 - with an idea of what you want to do.
07:41 - We have now seen how a bot can favorite,
07:44 - or boost things, and reply to things.
07:46 - So now it's time for you to be creative.
07:49 - What kinds of replies,
what kinds of activity,
07:52 - maybe you have a bot that makes up a poem,
07:55 - I haven't shown you how
to generate an image
07:57 - and post it, so I will show you that.
07:59 - I've got to make a video
to show you how to do that.
08:01 - But there's all sorts of
wonderful possibilities
08:03 - of how you can make your automated bot,
08:05 - use it on Mastadon at botsin.space.
08:08 - So choo choo everybody.
08:10 - (whistle tooting)
08:10 - See you in a future video.
08:12 - I hope you enjoyed this series
about making a Mastadon bot,
08:16 - more to come in the future, I'm sure.
08:18 - Good-bye.
08:19 - (upbeat tech music)
