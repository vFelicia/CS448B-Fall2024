00:00 - hello this is a train welcome its
00:03 - flowing into the station and it's
00:04 - brought with us a map of the world and
00:06 - what the craft of the world is showing
00:07 - you is little dots everywhere and
00:09 - earthquake has occurred in the last 30
00:11 - days and the dots are actually sized
00:13 - according to the magnitude that
00:14 - earthquake and that's exactly what I'm
00:16 - going to build in this particular coding
00:18 - challenge so a little while ago I built
00:20 - this from scratch and it involves a lot
00:23 - of pieces so the point of this coding
00:25 - challenge is really to learn about the
00:27 - idea of mapping data in a world like the
00:31 - earth that the sphere in the
00:32 - two-dimensional space so you need to
00:34 - learn about projections latitude
00:36 - longitude how to convert latitude
00:37 - longitude to pixel XY space and how to
00:40 - do that based on what you're how to get
00:41 - a data source in how to then draw it and
00:43 - so that's what I'm doing the pieces here
00:45 - is I'm getting this image of the world
00:46 - map from an API called mat box yet but
00:50 - certainly you could you know you have
00:51 - your own image you drew an image you
00:52 - design an image you got it from
00:53 - somewhere else as long as you know how
00:55 - that image was made you can you can do
00:57 - the same kind of project that I'm doing
00:58 - in this particular video I'm also
01:00 - getting earthquake data from the USGS
01:02 - the United States the US Geological
01:04 - Survey they have lots of wonderful
01:06 - scientific data that you can experiment
01:08 - with and then I'm using p5.js to draw
01:11 - the image of the world and then draw all
01:13 - these circles now one thing I want to
01:15 - mention is towards the end of this video
01:17 - I work on something to try to scale the
01:20 - size of the circles according to the
01:23 - magnitude of the earthquake and I have a
01:25 - little bit of math backwards for
01:26 - probably about five minutes of the video
01:27 - someone in the chat points it out and
01:29 - then I correct it so if you're watching
01:31 - and you realize like oh no my reference
01:32 - backwards there that's what happens but
01:34 - by the end I'm pretty sure I have the
01:35 - math right but if I have it wrong boy do
01:37 - I know that I'm going to hear about it
01:38 - in the comment so I look forward to
01:40 - hearing your feedback your suggestion I
01:41 - hope you make something with this you
01:42 - share it with me at shipment on Twitter
01:45 - and that you enjoy this ride on the
01:49 - coding train see you soon okay I'm
01:52 - starting this coding challenge now here
01:55 - we go so the first thing I'm going to do
01:57 - there's a lot of pieces to this but the
01:59 - first thing I want to do is just see the
02:00 - map of the world on the screen on the
02:03 - canvas I want to draw it and you know
02:04 - there's a lot of your ways you could do
02:06 - this you could find some JPEGs go draw
02:09 - your own map you could scan them half
02:12 - the question you have to answer for
02:13 - yourself by the way though one thing you
02:15 - have to remember is right the earth is a
02:17 - sphere so and I'm going to do this
02:19 - visualization in a 2d space a flat
02:22 - two-dimensional space so when you take
02:24 - the information that's wrapped around
02:26 - the sphere and peel it off into a
02:29 - two-dimensional space you have to apply
02:31 - some math and what that is typically
02:33 - referred to as a projection there are a
02:35 - lot of different math projections this
02:39 - is one from 1482 this is not something
02:41 - related just to coding and computer
02:43 - graphics the idea of how do you
02:44 - represent spherical information
02:46 - spherical imagery on a two-dimensional
02:48 - service a surface there there are lots
02:51 - try out history I'm gonna scroll all the
02:52 - way down here there's one that's kind of
02:54 - I think a nice tip find it now
02:57 - illustration of what I'm talking about
02:59 - you could imagine if you had an orange
03:00 - and you peel the orange and you
03:02 - flattened out the peel what would it
03:04 - look like it might look like this one
03:05 - over here Mercator Mercator projection
03:09 - is one of the kind of standard ones and
03:13 - you know this this looks kind of like a
03:16 - little bit oh this is like Mercator
03:17 - projection now you can see though that
03:19 - what happens is things that are close to
03:21 - the top or close to the bottom when you
03:24 - sort of stretch out the poles of the
03:25 - earth become really really large so
03:28 - Greenland over here is incredibly
03:30 - massive as compared to say Africa which
03:32 - is kind of close to this which is there
03:33 - right with the equator which is not at
03:35 - all accurate so I think there are a lot
03:37 - of complex questions about the sort of
03:39 - you know Western view essentially of a
03:42 - lot of these map projections and I think
03:46 - that's a really interesting topic but
03:47 - I'm getting way off track here but it's
03:49 - important to mention really think about
03:51 - how you're presenting information and
03:54 - what you're highlighting and what you
03:55 - know what's up versus down what's center
03:57 - versus and so there's a lot of design
03:58 - considerations that I think are very
03:59 - important to mention but what I'm going
04:01 - to use is something of a standard these
04:03 - days called web Mercator and web
04:06 - Mercator is used from what I understand
04:09 - by most of the online mapping tutorials
04:11 - refine like Google Maps Open Street Map
04:13 - MapQuest
04:15 - that even exists probably does overlay
04:17 - all these who loves MapQuest out there I
04:19 - apologize I'm sorry it's wonderful I'm
04:21 - going to MapQuest that do you say that
04:23 - so they might said it anyway um so
04:25 - this is going on way too long okay so
04:28 - what I got to do what I'm going to do is
04:30 - I'm going to grab a map image from Matt
04:34 - box and then I need to understand what
04:36 - projection it's using so that I can
04:38 - apply the math to convert my latitude
04:40 - longitude to an XY location in that
04:42 - pixel canvas okay so the map map box you
04:46 - can you can find out information at Matt
04:48 - box.com you'll have to sign up for an
04:49 - account and get an API key and all that
04:52 - sort of stuff I'll include links in this
04:53 - video's description to where you can do
04:54 - that and I'm going to use something
04:56 - called a static map so Matt box has a
04:58 - lot of features that you can embed a map
05:00 - that's zoomable and you can put those
05:01 - little pins in it and do all sorts of
05:03 - stuff with it I just want to use it to
05:04 - get an image so the way that I can get
05:07 - an image for example is through a call
05:11 - an HTTP request to a particular URL so
05:14 - I'm going to grab this URL and what I'm
05:17 - going to do is I'm going to go to my
05:19 - code and I'm going to say I'm going to
05:21 - add a function preload and I'm going to
05:26 - say I'm going to have a variable called
05:28 - map image and I'm going to say map image
05:31 - equal load image and notice here that
05:35 - there's this piece of the code it says
05:36 - your access token so this will work
05:38 - right now if I were to run it I need to
05:40 - get my API token which I'm going to do
05:42 - right over here I already am on the page
05:44 - and it's right here I'm going to click
05:47 - copy so if you just go to this
05:49 - particular URL that's where you can
05:50 - create your own access token if you can
05:53 - painstakingly copy behind if you want
05:55 - I'll probably regenerate it later and
05:58 - then it won't work but okay so I put
06:00 - that in and then what I want to do is
06:02 - I'm going to say create canvas now
06:05 - you'll notice there are a bunch of
06:06 - arguments in here this is in this path
06:09 - this is the latitude longitude of the
06:11 - center that's the zoom level and then
06:13 - somewhere in here at 600 by 600 that's
06:15 - the pixel resolution that I'm getting so
06:18 - I'm going to now go and say create
06:20 - canvas 600 600 and then I'm just going
06:26 - to say image map image at 0-0 so if all
06:29 - goes according to plan when I go and run
06:32 - this code in the browser we see there it
06:34 - is whoa what kind of crazy
06:37 - angles Matt fig did I get oh my good so
06:40 - I wanted a flat nap
06:41 - I might have to adjust the API calls I
06:47 - just made interesting to see that it
06:49 - does that what I wanted is a oh I'm in
06:54 - the class I'm no oh dark
06:57 - I think dark beat so there's a lot of
06:59 - things like dark v.9 here using them so
07:04 - why is it angled oh you know what it is
07:06 - it's because there's a lot of arguments
07:08 - here there's latitude longitude we can
07:10 - look at the documentation zoom level and
07:13 - then this is like an angle I think so if
07:15 - I change this to zero
07:18 - there we go I flattened it so I don't
07:20 - know what the default is is this
07:22 - somewhere I'm guessing like in like San
07:24 - Francisco or something could possibly be
07:26 - but what I want to do now is I want to
07:28 - see a world map so I'm going to change
07:30 - the latitude and longitude I'm just
07:31 - going to change it to zero zero which is
07:33 - going to be at lab right there and then
07:35 - not really the center of the world this
07:36 - is a sphere like what's the center huh
07:38 - but our latitude longitude Center I'm
07:41 - going to change the zoom level to like 4
07:44 - and then I'm going to hit refresh and we
07:47 - see oh let me zoom out some more I'm
07:49 - actually the change the zoom level to 1
07:50 - and we can see there we go so I've got
07:52 - the world map now I want to see a wider
07:56 - picture of the world map so I'm going to
07:58 - change let's change this to 1024 by 512
08:03 - I think this should behave nicely for us
08:05 - up but if I do that I want to change
08:08 - create canvas to 1024 512 so let's
08:12 - refresh that whoops oh it's just super
08:15 - big now
08:16 - whoops nope sorry I got a zoom out here
08:19 - a little bit so there you go so now you
08:21 - can see I've got the world map with this
08:23 - dark theme and there it is in my p5.js
08:26 - canvas we're getting somewhere
08:27 - now if I wanted to do more of this I
08:30 - would suggest if you're watching and you
08:31 - actually pull this code I would probably
08:32 - do something where I make assess avaria
08:36 - Buhl's
08:36 - for width and height and zoom level and
08:38 - all that sort of thing but I'm just
08:39 - going to leave this stuff kind of
08:40 - constant for right now I am going to
08:43 - though
08:45 - I am yes not only that stuff constant
08:47 - right now so now that I have got what I
08:48 - need to do is figure out let's say I
08:51 - have a latitude longitude so let's say I
08:53 - have a latitude longitude that is the
08:55 - latitude of zero longitude is zero now
08:58 - it might be worth me refreshing your
09:00 - memory if latitude and longitude are
09:02 - familiar concepts to you but you've sort
09:04 - of forgotten what exactly they are and
09:06 - how they work so let's say I were to try
09:08 - to draw as best as I could spear and I
09:12 - can kind of represent it with these
09:13 - lines and by the way what are these
09:15 - lines these lines are longitude so
09:18 - longitude are the line I can think of
09:20 - them as like long because they go too
09:21 - long up and down but there are the
09:23 - vertical lines and they're really going
09:24 - to map to our X location because we're
09:25 - going to take this and kind of unfurl it
09:29 - so to speak
09:29 - onto into a flat rectangle so we want
09:32 - those longitude lines to end up like
09:35 - this so these are the X values our
09:38 - longitude and then the Y values are
09:41 - latitude and you know this being perhaps
09:44 - like a zero zero the Y values then being
09:48 - latitude okay now there's another sort
09:50 - of key aspect of this what is the range
09:52 - of these values so they are described as
09:55 - angle essentially good because there's
09:57 - angles of rotation in the way around the
09:58 - center of the earth and so if there's a
10:01 - full rotation of 360 degrees we can kind
10:04 - of go all the way this way to 180
10:06 - degrees and then go all the way this way
10:08 - to negative hundred eighty degrees the
10:10 - thing is I'm going to need to use
10:12 - radians as a measurement in my code and
10:14 - so that's something we're going to have
10:15 - to sort of think about this is PI and
10:17 - this is negative PI and I have other
10:19 - videos that kind of go over the basics
10:20 - of radians and units of measurements
10:22 - that you could be watching try to find
10:23 - if that's a new copped concept for you
10:26 - now latitude on the other hand will gone
10:29 - all the way around it's just going
10:31 - halfway up and halfway down in a way so
10:33 - the range is between 90 and negative 90
10:35 - and I probably got that wrong I think 90
10:37 - is north and negative 90 is up by the
10:39 - way if you look up the lat lunch your
10:41 - latitude with you if you google like a
10:43 - latitude longitude latitude of New York
10:45 - City you'll find the number will be
10:47 - something like 74 degrees west
10:50 - so 74 degrees this is actually 180
10:53 - degrees west this is 180 degrees east
10:56 - this is 90 degrees north
10:58 - this is 90 degrees south so the negative
11:00 - numbers are what we need to use in the
11:01 - math but you'll often see them listed as
11:03 - north south west east which is something
11:05 - you might need to convert depending on
11:06 - what how your data is formatted okay so
11:08 - hopefully that clarifies that a little
11:10 - bit so I'm actually going to what I'm
11:13 - going to come back over here and I'm
11:15 - going to do a couple things I'm going to
11:16 - do I'm not absolutely called center
11:17 - latitude Center longitude and then I'm
11:20 - just going to have a variable called
11:21 - latitude a variable longitude I would
11:23 - like to pick a city somewhere in the
11:25 - world that's not the United States that
11:27 - may be I know approximately where it is
11:30 - even though I've got the sort of bad
11:32 - American sense of geography so let's
11:35 - look for a city where where there a lot
11:40 - of trains well this lot trains did
11:42 - Europe and Asia ever where there's
11:45 - trains that's a bad bad clip let me let
11:47 - me look for let's look for Shanghai
11:49 - latitude longitude so you're seeing here
11:54 - we've got thirty one point two three
11:56 - zero four North 100 to one point four
11:58 - seven three East so let's take this into
12:01 - our code and let's put that here I'm
12:04 - going to just comment this put this in
12:06 - comments here so the latitude is the
12:09 - north number and the longitude is the
12:12 - East number and it's not negative if
12:14 - we're west it would be negative and what
12:17 - I want to do now is draw is draw the
12:21 - location it converts to its X&Y so what
12:24 - I need to do here and I don't need the
12:25 - draw function I need to figure out how
12:28 - do I convert those things ah guess what
12:30 - we're going to just look up the formula
12:32 - it's going to look kind of terrifying
12:33 - but I think I'm going to write it for
12:35 - you in code and it will hopefully be
12:37 - possible so here we are in web Mercator
12:39 - and web Mercator is based on what what
12:43 - we need to do is to calculate this X&Y
12:45 - we need to apply this formula so the
12:49 - reason why this number is 128 is web the
12:52 - standard of web Mercator is that it's
12:55 - giving you the XY for a square where the
12:57 - top left is 0 0 and the bottom right is
13:00 - 256 256 so the centre is 128 128 I think
13:04 - actually nap box does but tiles that are
13:07 - 512 so I think I actually need to change
13:09 - that number to 2
13:10 - 56 so that really depends on the kind of
13:12 - again the system you're using the zoom
13:14 - level is this value of how far zoomed in
13:17 - or zoomed out this lambda here is
13:19 - longitude and the letter of the greek
13:22 - letter fee is latitude so if i write
13:26 - this code and i'm just going to kind of
13:28 - do this a little bit i'm going to write
13:29 - a function called i'm going to write a
13:32 - separate function for x and y i could
13:33 - wrap this into one function i'm going to
13:35 - write a function called web Merc I'm
13:38 - just gonna call it Merc Merc X and it
13:41 - takes Merc X takes in a longitude value
13:44 - and now what I like to do sometimes with
13:46 - formulas like this is I'd like to break
13:48 - them into parts rather unnecessary but I
13:51 - think it'll make us less likely to make
13:53 - a mistake so I'm going to just do the
13:55 - first part I'm going to call it a and
13:57 - that is 128 divided by PI times 2 to the
14:01 - zoom level right so 180 divided by PI
14:05 - times 2 to the zoom level so what is
14:08 - this we've the zoom level is right now
14:10 - is something that I've defined here as 1
14:13 - so this is something that I could make
14:15 - into a variable I really should make it
14:16 - into a variable and I'm going to say
14:18 - zoom equals 1
14:20 - so again I should put that in here but
14:24 - I'm gonna leave that out right now okay
14:25 - so so now the zoom is taken care of
14:29 - great you know what I could do actually
14:31 - is whenever I could give this Merc X
14:34 - argument longitude and zoom level but
14:36 - I'll just use it as a global variable
14:37 - okay that's barrei now I'm going to say
14:40 - var be the second part if I go back to
14:42 - the formula is just the longitude plus
14:45 - pi okay so longitude plus pi but guess
14:49 - what one thing I need to make sure I'm
14:52 - going to have an issue I'll get to it
14:54 - later
14:54 - whether its degrees or radians is
14:56 - important the formula is assuming
14:57 - longitude is going to come in in Radian
14:59 - so I have to make sure I remember that
15:00 - now I can just say return a times B
15:02 - right because it's this 128 divided by
15:06 - PI times 2 the zoom level times the
15:10 - longview plus pi okay great now let's
15:12 - write 1 for y Merc why latitude and we
15:18 - can see here that the parts a little bit
15:19 - more complex once this part a is exactly
15:22 - the same let's make part
15:24 - be just this tangent part of the
15:26 - equation so I'm going to say Part B is a
15:30 - tangent of pi divided by 4 plus C which
15:38 - is the latitude divided by 2 latitude /
15:40 - - okay
15:41 - that's B and C is law pi minus log of B
15:47 - so PI minus log of B now you might
15:50 - notice right here that this says Ln Ln
15:54 - means natural log so logs have a log
15:58 - what a logarithm is that merits or of a
16:00 - separate video but if you see LM it
16:01 - means natural log base E which is a
16:03 - special wonderful number but in in most
16:07 - of programming frameworks if you have
16:10 - the log function it's doing by default a
16:12 - natural log and you can obviously adjust
16:13 - that to a different base but so this dis
16:16 - mapped to it perfectly here log of B
16:17 - okay so now I need to say a times a a
16:25 - times c right a times c because b is
16:29 - just for the purpose of this so a times
16:31 - C this is now giving me the Y location
16:33 - okay I think we're doing well here now
16:36 - what we can do is say um so one thing
16:39 - I'm going to do which is kind of
16:41 - unnecessary but I need help a lot of
16:44 - people I don't even get messages of how
16:46 - I don't need to do this but it helps me
16:48 - think about it I actually would like to
16:50 - work from the center so I'm going to
16:53 - translate with / Q height divided by two
16:56 - if I do that look that moves the origin
17:00 - point from the top left to the center
17:01 - and I'm going to go to my code I'm going
17:04 - to refresh it and you're going to see
17:06 - now the image is the origin is in the
17:08 - center so I'm going to change image mode
17:10 - to center so that now the image is drawn
17:13 - from the center so now I'm back the
17:16 - reason why I'm doing that it's a little
17:17 - bit weird but what I want to do is I
17:21 - want to draw everything the value that
17:24 - I'm going to get from this math is
17:26 - relative to a center point so it's going
17:29 - to be a little easier for me to kind of
17:30 - figure that out this way so what I want
17:32 - to do first is I want to say var Center
17:36 - X E
17:37 - old Merc ex of launch of longitude
17:44 - sender longitude and center y equals
17:50 - merc y of center latitude then i want to
17:56 - say x equals merc x mercs x of that of
18:02 - the longitude this is the Beijing I mean
18:04 - sorry Shanghai longitude and then the
18:08 - Shanghai latitude and then what I want
18:11 - to do is where I'm going to position
18:13 - them on the screen is the difference
18:15 - between those two points
18:17 - so if CX CY is the center wherever that
18:20 - is relative to the center of the window
18:22 - is its location - that center location
18:24 - so now I should be able to say let's
18:27 - make a nice little circle with some
18:30 - alpha and let's draw an ellipse at that
18:34 - x + y 20 by 20 pixels let's not be
18:37 - afraid
18:37 - let's hit refresh Earth okay so it's not
18:40 - there what's the problem
18:41 - I forgot about my units of measurement
18:43 - so this is definitely a problem here
18:45 - which is that these measurements are in
18:47 - degrees and the fact is the calculations
18:51 - are assuming radians so what I need to
18:54 - do is convert these things beat them to
18:56 - rating so I'm just going to add a line
18:57 - of code here that says longitude equals
19:00 - radians longitude and I'm going to say
19:03 - latitude equals radians latitudes and
19:06 - and the reason why I'm going to do this
19:08 - is I know that when I go get that
19:09 - earthquake data I'm going to get values
19:11 - and degrees because I've looked at that
19:13 - data before okay so now I'm gonna hit
19:15 - refresh it's there but it's not in the
19:17 - right spot the reason it's not in the
19:18 - right spot is remember I said map that
19:20 - box actually uses tiles 512 by 512 and
19:23 - so I'm going to change these to 256 256
19:28 - and I'm gonna hit refresh and there we
19:30 - go that looks right to me
19:31 - somebody tell me that's not where
19:32 - Shanghai is let's go to the other side
19:35 - and let's look at Vancouver Vancouver
19:38 - latitude and longitude and let's try
19:42 - that out
19:42 - I'm going to grab this here and put this
19:45 - into my code and so now I need a
19:50 - latitude of forty nine point two eight
19:53 - to seven and in the longitude not of one
19:56 - twenty three point one 207 positive
19:59 - because it's West I need to add the
20:02 - negative number there okay and here we
20:04 - go let's go back to our code it refresh
20:06 - there somebody tell me that's not where
20:08 - Vancouver is I'm pretty sure I've
20:09 - pinpointed it now that circle is kind of
20:11 - large really shouldn't I shouldn't do
20:13 - anything that might cause me to discover
20:15 - a mistake but I'm just going to make
20:16 - that circle a little bit smaller hit
20:19 - refresh and I think that's that looks
20:22 - right dead-on where Vancouver is right
20:23 - somebody from Canada tell me if I've got
20:25 - that wrong okay so we're doing well here
20:28 - so now I've actually done almost
20:31 - everything because what I have now is a
20:33 - framework for re4 taking the latitude
20:36 - longitude and converting it to an XY
20:37 - that I can draw so let's go get some
20:40 - data that has lots of latitude and
20:41 - longitude in it so the data that I'm
20:43 - going to use is from the US Geological
20:45 - Survey here is the page usgs science for
20:51 - a changing world let me tell you
20:52 - something
20:52 - science very important wonderful thing
20:55 - I'm all about the science I wish I knew
20:57 - more about science and what they have
20:59 - what USGS website is in addition to lots
21:02 - of things I'm on a page which I'll link
21:03 - to in this video's description is it'll
21:05 - give me a data feeds of earthquakes so I
21:07 - could get just significant earthquakes
21:08 - in the past hour I think just to get
21:11 - some data but not too much data let's
21:13 - get all earthquakes in the past day so
21:15 - I'm going to copy paste this link
21:18 - address and I'm going to go to my code
21:20 - and in preload I'm going to say
21:23 - earthquakes
21:26 - I'm going to make a variable called
21:28 - earthquakes and in the preload function
21:31 - only move this low I need more space to
21:33 - look at this code I'm going to go here
21:35 - and I'm going to say earthquakes equals
21:39 - load strings there and I'm now notice
21:43 - what it's actually loading it's a CSV
21:46 - file so that file is actually a comma
21:49 - separated value file it's essentially a
21:50 - spreadsheet and I can look at it this is
21:53 - a different one but if I go to the I
21:55 - downloaded one already which is right
21:57 - here this is actually everything from
21:59 - the last month and you can see here it's
22:01 - a
22:02 - it's a table it's a table which starts
22:04 - at time latitude longitude here's the
22:07 - time here's the latitude here's the
22:09 - longitude and here is then there's some
22:13 - other things magnitude is something
22:15 - thatís I want to look at because we can
22:16 - use magnitude to decide how large to
22:18 - maybe draw something on what color to
22:19 - draw something but I'm going to leave
22:21 - most of those kind of interesting design
22:22 - decisions to you to do something more
22:24 - creative with or maybe you're going to
22:25 - do map different kind of data but what I
22:28 - really want to focus on it's just first
22:29 - getting those latitude and longitude so
22:32 - the way I can do this now is there is a
22:35 - function in p5 called load table this is
22:37 - such a simple bit of data that actually
22:38 - think using load strings a little bit
22:40 - simpler I'm going to redo this challenge
22:41 - making a 3ds version of it in processing
22:44 - and use load table there just to show
22:45 - the difference that will come sometime
22:47 - eventually so now what I'm going to do
22:49 - here in setup is once I have the data
22:52 - I'm going to say for VAR I equals 0 I is
22:55 - less than earth quakes dot length so low
22:59 - string will give you an array of strings
23:02 - each string being a line in that data
23:04 - file so all I need to do with each one
23:06 - of those is call a function called split
23:09 - so I'm going to save our data equals
23:12 - earth quakes index I dot split then I'm
23:18 - going to write something kind of weird
23:19 - here so what I want to do is say what is
23:23 - the delimiter that I want to split
23:24 - everything up by what I want to split
23:26 - everything up by a comma but why didn't
23:29 - I just put a comma in quote because
23:30 - normally in JavaScript you'd put a
23:31 - yellow string in quotes I use these
23:33 - forward slashes this is something known
23:35 - as a regular expression which is a
23:36 - sophisticated way to match a particular
23:38 - pattern of text and I'll link in this
23:41 - video's description to a whole set of
23:42 - tutorials on regular expressions but
23:44 - here we get simply the only pattern I
23:45 - want to match is a single comma so
23:47 - that's going to be easy so now if I do
23:49 - that I'm just going to say console dot
23:51 - log data and let's take a look at what
23:54 - we get in the console I'm going to kind
23:56 - of move this over here we can see I'm
23:58 - getting a whole bunch of a arrays so I
24:01 - get an array and I can see here the
24:03 - first element is the timestamp the
24:04 - second element is the I believe it's
24:06 - latitude first then longitude yeah it
24:08 - has to because that's negative 166 some
24:10 - other data about the earthquake this 2.2
24:12 - is the magnitude on the Richter scale
24:14 - and the chapel 20 odd split with the
24:16 - comma with it with quotes as a string
24:17 - does work also but in case you end up
24:20 - wanting to do more elaborate splitting
24:21 - it's kind of useful to have the option
24:23 - of a regular expression okay so I am
24:26 - going to now I am going to what am I
24:32 - doing here
24:33 - so what do I want to do the latitude is
24:36 - the first it's not the first if I go
24:40 - back to this it's this is element 0
24:42 - element 1 element 2 so latitude is index
24:44 - 1 of that array latitude is data index 1
24:49 - longitude is data index 2 and then guess
24:53 - what all you do is take this this exact
24:56 - same code once I get that latitude
24:58 - longitude convert it to X&Y draw a
25:01 - little circle and now we will see I'm
25:04 - gonna take out this console.log
25:05 - something I need that and move over here
25:08 - and I'm hit refresh and there we go
25:10 - these are all the earthquakes that have
25:13 - happened in the last what was it the
25:16 - last hour I think did I do
25:17 - let's go get the last now that we see
25:20 - this is working let's go grab let's go
25:23 - wrap all earthquakes from the past 30
25:26 - days that's going to be a lot to
25:30 - ambitious of me so I'm going to I'm
25:33 - going to just paste this here and I'm
25:36 - going to do this and I'm going to
25:38 - comment out this line of code so I can
25:41 - now which is awkward to do here I'm
25:44 - gonna paste this end up time I must have
25:47 - gotten rid of a quote or something yep
25:48 - got rid of the end there ok so so many
25:51 - ways I could make this code a little bit
25:54 - nicer but that should do now I'm going
25:55 - to refresh we go it's going to take a
25:57 - little while a lot of data actually
25:59 - didn't take that long look at that so
26:00 - you can see all the earthquakes from the
26:03 - last month and you know things that I
26:05 - could do to this I could first of all I
26:10 - could think about zooming in on a
26:12 - certain part by changing the zoom level
26:13 - on the width and the height of the map
26:15 - and that sort of thing you want to be
26:16 - careful you know again the way that the
26:19 - way that map box works if you start
26:20 - playing around with a zoom I would if
26:22 - you want I would I would not make
26:23 - with our height greater than 1024 and it
26:25 - actually seems to work really nicely if
26:27 - you keep that as a multiple of like 256
26:29 - or but I don't think that should be
26:31 - required but you know play around with
26:33 - it I could you could change but also you
26:36 - could just think about animating it you
26:37 - could look and one thing I would like to
26:39 - do that I think is worth doing is just
26:41 - drawing these with the size based on
26:44 - magnitude so let's figure out let's look
26:46 - at how we would do that so right now
26:49 - where I'm drawing the size is just here
26:52 - 8 comma 8 so what is the actual size in
26:55 - the data it is latitude longitude depth
26:59 - magnitude so I'm just going to use the
27:01 - magnitude which is one two three index
27:03 - four so let's go back to the code and
27:06 - I'm going to say var M for magnitude or
27:13 - magnitude equals data index three now
27:17 - I'm gonna do something wildly not
27:19 - accurate but I'm just going to get
27:20 - started with its just so we can see
27:21 - something I'm going to say var diameter
27:26 - equals map the magnitude from a range
27:28 - from zero to ten to arrange from zero to
27:31 - two to a sixty so I'm just going to take
27:34 - that Richter scale magnitude and map it
27:37 - again there's lots of mathematical
27:38 - problems what I'm doing but just to get
27:39 - something on the screen that's got some
27:41 - difference I'm gonna put this D now into
27:43 - here and we can run this oh boy look at
27:46 - that ah we've got some what did I do
27:49 - wrong
27:49 - did I get the wrong oh I said three
27:51 - should be four I was using the wrong
27:53 - value okay so we can see we've got
27:55 - something but look at this there aren't
27:57 - really lots of earthquakes of such like
27:59 - large magnitudes happening all the time
28:01 - all over the place and the reason why
28:03 - this is there's a couple reasons why
28:05 - this is terribly inaccurate and we find
28:09 - my eraser two fundamental reasons number
28:13 - one is magnitude on the Richter scale
28:16 - for earthquakes is measured if I'm
28:18 - correct in a logarithmic scale meaning
28:22 - if I have a earthquake of magnitude five
28:26 - and I have an earthquake of magnitude
28:28 - six this earthquake is actually ten
28:32 - times as powerful as the earthquake of
28:34 - magnitude five some research at tell me
28:36 - about
28:37 - that wrong I can come back and correct
28:39 - it so that's one thing so I need to
28:41 - think about drawing the other thing
28:43 - that's really quite important is here is
28:44 - when I take a circle and I give it a
28:47 - diet in it let's say it has a diameter
28:48 - of four which means it has a radius of
28:51 - two and then I have another circle that
28:53 - has a diameter twice the size of eight
28:56 - which means a radius of four the thing
29:00 - that I'm seeing visually is the area of
29:02 - it and the area is PI R squared so the
29:06 - area of this is four pi and the area of
29:08 - this is 16 PI so I'm actually drawing
29:11 - this is something that is four times as
29:14 - large as this but the radius is only
29:15 - twice so I need to account for that when
29:17 - I'm visualizing stuff using circles
29:19 - that's kind of an important you know if
29:21 - I were just doing population for example
29:22 - I wouldn't map population directly to
29:25 - diameter I would map it to the square
29:28 - odd map into the square root square root
29:30 - of population to diameter something like
29:32 - that we're going to get that right as we
29:33 - come over here if we come back over here
29:35 - now I can start to implement some of
29:37 - this math into the actual code itself so
29:39 - looking at the code the magnitude what I
29:43 - want to do with the magnitude really if
29:45 - if the magnitude is five and the Richter
29:48 - magnitude of six is ten times that what
29:50 - I could say its magnitude equals itself
29:53 - to the tenth power so this is kind of
29:56 - unknown inverse logarithm logarithmic
30:00 - again it's inverse logarithm I'm going
30:02 - to actually set it to the power of ten
30:04 - now the other thing I want to do is take
30:06 - the square root of it because ultimately
30:07 - I'm going to map that to the diameter of
30:10 - a particular ellipse so I also want to
30:12 - say magnitude equals the square root of
30:14 - itself so now this mapping instead of
30:18 - going from zero to ten meaning to
30:20 - Memphis to sort of maximum on the
30:22 - Richter scale of ten I don't know if
30:23 - that's an actual maximum I should look
30:24 - up the Richter scale but what I want to
30:27 - do is get a new maximum so I'm going to
30:31 - say var mag max equals power the square
30:37 - root of ten to the tenth power
30:39 - so if ten is my maximum magnet
30:42 - dude then I want to make that the
30:45 - maximum and then so the mapping now goes
30:47 - from here to here and let's take a look
30:49 - at that and we can see now almost
30:52 - everything has disappeared because most
30:54 - of the earthquakes are small but there
30:56 - was I believe recently I saw in the news
30:58 - a very large earthquake I don't know I
31:00 - should look this up where this was but
31:02 - I'm pretty sure I've got things accurate
31:04 - here we could we could look into the
31:05 - data and see what this is
31:06 - I could also try to make this a bit more
31:08 - everything a bit more visible one thing
31:10 - is I could say give me a stroke of color
31:13 - to put around the circles and I can also
31:15 - you know make this 180 for example to
31:18 - really sort of like emphasize so now we
31:19 - can see you can see lots and lots of
31:21 - tiny earthquakes up along here
31:23 - lots and lots of tiny earthquakes here
31:25 - and really some larger ones over and
31:27 - around here so I think we've done it
31:29 - this is now mapping earthquakes I did it
31:37 - wrong I totally did it wrong stop
31:40 - everything it's not thank you this is
31:44 - not correct it should actually reverse
31:47 - the logarithm it has to be 10 to the
31:52 - magnitudes power right I'm sorry about
31:54 - that y'all everybody screaming about at
31:56 - me watching this video I wonder if I
31:57 - should just go all the way back and redo
31:58 - this because GUI or watching it but
32:00 - maybe it's fine to have this wrong so I
32:02 - just go back so in other words 10 to the
32:06 - 4 is 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 10 to
32:12 - the 5 is is 10 to the 4 times 10 so this
32:16 - is really how it works so I actually had
32:18 - it quite wrong there so let's take a
32:19 - look at that and that should you know
32:22 - it's really the same idea but it's going
32:24 - to you know make it a bit more right
32:25 - this would actually looks fine because
32:26 - both of these worked 10 so I think
32:28 - they're worth quick you're going to get
32:29 - quite a bit smaller actually the small
32:31 - ones and you can see there we go so I
32:32 - got the similar effect apologies for
32:34 - that mathematical error and now I think
32:38 - you know those of you injure you can
32:40 - enjoy see the process about how I
32:41 - constantly make mistakes but I think I
32:42 - have it right here now and I could
32:44 - change the mapping I could change the
32:45 - color
32:46 - alka in the chat made a great suggestion
32:48 - of if you wanted
32:49 - sighs here see if you can create a time
32:51 - lapse version of it so I actually use
32:52 - the time stamp and now to see the
32:54 - earthquakes all pop up over time over 30
32:56 - days but how that all happened in 30
32:58 - seconds you could also write it so that
33:00 - your refresh the data query so if you
33:02 - look here on the webpage here on the on
33:07 - the webpage here I'm on the wrong
33:09 - webpage if you look here on what am I
33:11 - looking for uh the USGS website you can
33:13 - see that you can get every five minutes
33:14 - earthquakes updated from the past hour
33:16 - so this would be interesting to think
33:18 - about how you might animate them and
33:19 - refresh the data every five minute so I
33:21 - hope that you code here will be linked I
33:24 - hope that you make something with this I
33:27 - or even if you just use this to create
33:30 - some other types of mapping project
33:32 - please share it with me share in the
33:33 - comments or share that shipment on
33:35 - Twitter thanks for watching and another
33:37 - coding challenge
