00:00 - hello welcome to another coding
00:01 - challenge I'm going to build a 3d
00:03 - earthquake visualization you can see it
00:05 - right there I am going to do this in
00:07 - processing which is a Java based
00:08 - programming environment I'm going to use
00:10 - its 3d rendering capabilities I'm going
00:13 - to load a comma-separated data value
00:16 - data source from the United States
00:18 - Geological Survey with earthquake data
00:19 - I'm going to the image from NASA I'm
00:21 - going to texture it to a sphere I'm
00:23 - going to do all of that to build exactly
00:25 - this in the coding challenge and this is
00:26 - the result that I just did and I'm going
00:29 - to travel back in time the moment it
00:30 - starts decoding challenge there is a big
00:32 - issue with this which is that the actual
00:35 - earthquakes aren't aligned to that
00:36 - particular texture so that I'm leaving
00:38 - as a kind of challenge to the audience
00:40 - and I will come back next week on the
00:42 - live stream and show some solutions to
00:44 - that in addition the most confusing part
00:47 - of this video is probably this the math
00:50 - behind taking getting these almost
00:53 - building like structures to point out in
00:55 - the direction from the center of the
00:57 - sphere of the earth as a globe and to do
00:59 - that I'm using something called the
01:00 - cross product of vectors and so I cover
01:03 - that a little bit I expect that that's
01:05 - probably one of the confusing parts of
01:06 - this video and let me know in the
01:07 - comments it makes sense or doesn't make
01:09 - sense
01:10 - other solutions for the same problem and
01:11 - I'll come back ah I know what I forgot
01:13 - often often if you need to solve this
01:18 - problem you the thing you might want to
01:20 - research on I'll put some links in the
01:21 - description is something called an Euler
01:22 - angles or also quaternion I have to run
01:28 - away really fast whenever I say
01:29 - quaternion so but I'll come back it's
01:33 - just like it's an instinctual thing it's
01:35 - like the way my brain is wired but but
01:37 - in this case I did it in kind because
01:38 - these elements aren't moving and sort of
01:41 - turning I'm able to just kind of like
01:42 - align the rotation so see how that is
01:44 - let me know in the comments how that
01:45 - went
01:45 - enjoyed this coding challenge and maybe
01:48 - you'll still be watching at the end and
01:49 - maybe you'll make a comment maybe you'll
01:51 - share this like it whatever you're
01:53 - supposed to do to help like the videos
01:54 - get more whatever I don't know okay
01:56 - enjoy goodbye take a ride on the coding
01:58 - train oh okay
01:59 - here we are I am now going to attempt
02:02 - I've been probably going to do it in a
02:04 - way that everyone's going to point out
02:05 - how it could be done so much easier way
02:07 - afterwards so I'm already getting some
02:08 - great suggestions from the
02:10 - but I'm going to attempt to redo this
02:14 - previous challenge which was mapping
02:16 - earthquake earthquake data to a two
02:19 - dimensional map of the world and I am
02:20 - now going to map that data to a 3d
02:24 - sphere now you might be thinking to
02:26 - yourself the earth isn't exactly a
02:28 - sphere which is true and there's kind of
02:31 - this distinction between the concepts of
02:33 - latitude and longitude and azimuth moves
02:36 - as in the inclination anyway I'm going
02:40 - to kind of ignore that for the purpose
02:41 - of this video and really just treat the
02:43 - earth as if it were a perfect sphere and
02:46 - then you know perhaps people can in the
02:49 - comments suggest some ways to be more
02:52 - accurate about that or I can come back
02:53 - and do a follow-up video but that's
02:54 - that's going to give me a simple way for
02:56 - us to get started with the concept so so
02:58 - what I'm going to use to do this
03:00 - challenge is a tool called processing
03:02 - and processing is a programming language
03:05 - and environment built on top of Java all
03:08 - the syntax that I'll be writing in this
03:09 - code will be Java syntax and the
03:12 - libraries for drawing come from
03:14 - processing itself and there's a code
03:15 - editor with processing and I'm going to
03:17 - use so I'm going to first just make a
03:18 - saw a window on size 600 600 and I'm
03:22 - going to say P 3d so P 3d is allowing me
03:25 - to now have a 3d renderer so I can start
03:27 - to use functions that are available in
03:29 - processing for rendering 3d yay I'm
03:32 - going to make a background with my
03:35 - favorite grayscale color of 51 then I am
03:39 - going to say translate because I want
03:41 - the scent I want the center of my world
03:43 - weed center of the window and even in 3d
03:45 - and processing the default is the top
03:47 - left corner I'm gonna say translate I
03:49 - could say 300 300 but I'm going to say
03:51 - width / 2 height divided by 2
03:53 - by the way I was I've noticed some
03:55 - people mentioning that it's often better
03:58 - practice by the way I'm all about bad
04:00 - practice bad practice I'm in favor of
04:02 - them to go back to multiply by 0.5 and
04:05 - seda divided by 2 since the division
04:07 - operation is you know trivially slower
04:10 - perhaps but anyway the point is I want
04:13 - to go to the center and then I'm just
04:14 - going to say steer and I'm going to say
04:16 - sphere 200 let's run this so look there
04:21 - we have our sphere so this is going to
04:23 - be the earth
04:23 - and what I want to do is I'm going to
04:26 - say fill 200 no stroke and by the way if
04:30 - I do that what you're going to see is it
04:33 - looks just like a circle so things in 3d
04:35 - can appear very flat unless you start to
04:38 - change your view the world and how
04:40 - you're looking at things so what I'm
04:42 - going to do here also something that I
04:43 - can do in processing is I could just say
04:45 - lights now there are a lot of functions
04:47 - in processing and I got a move over
04:49 - there's a lot of functions in processing
04:50 - for specific kinds of lights ambient
04:53 - lights and I can control the color
04:54 - directional light spotlight so I
04:57 - encourage you to investigate that but
04:58 - just lights is just kind of like hey
05:00 - there's some general lighting and I
05:02 - don't know how well you can see this but
05:03 - now there's some nice shading on this
05:05 - and other thing I'm going to do is I'm
05:07 - going to create a variable I'm going to
05:10 - call it just angle and I'm going to
05:14 - right after translate I'm going to
05:15 - rotate along the y-axis so one of the
05:18 - things about being in P 3d is that I can
05:20 - now move this over a little bit I can
05:23 - now I can not just wrote call rotate
05:26 - which rotates along rotates just in a 2d
05:30 - plane I can rotate around the y axis
05:33 - rotates the x axis or the z axis so
05:38 - rotate Y by angle and then I can just
05:42 - say you know angle plus equals zero
05:45 - point you know five or something what we
05:47 - would what we should see here is to be
05:49 - very hard to see as you can see now I
05:50 - have my sphere which I'm using to
05:52 - represent the earth kind of rotating
05:55 - around and you spinning around you can
05:56 - kind of see the shadowing so now what do
05:59 - I want to do I want to place a point on
06:02 - the sphere and I want to place that
06:05 - point based on a latitude longitude
06:08 - so let's if you recall I could I'm just
06:11 - going to just what I did the previous
06:13 - challenge is I I just kind of looked up
06:15 - something like latitude longitude pick
06:20 - city out of a hat Melbourne I like to
06:25 - pick cities I've never been to but hope
06:26 - you visit someday I can pick this
06:29 - latitude and longitude
06:30 - and I'm going to just put it up here now
06:34 - and I'm going to say float latitude
06:36 - equals okay now I always have to
06:39 - remember longitude are the lines on the
06:43 - skier that goes up top to bottom and go
06:46 - all the way around so that's really like
06:48 - the X what I'm thinking about as the X
06:50 - so longitude is east-west one forty four
06:55 - point nine six thirty one latitude is
06:59 - north-south thirty-seven point point
07:03 - eight one three six and when itself is
07:06 - negative when it's North it's positive I
07:08 - think let me make that negative again
07:11 - this is kind of irrelevant because it's
07:12 - just going to appear somewhat of the
07:13 - sphere there's no I won't be able to see
07:15 - if it's actually in Australia but just
07:16 - to get started let me do this now how do
07:18 - I convert longitude and latitude to an
07:22 - XY location okay interesting question
07:30 - now there are some ways that I could do
07:33 - it leave beaver expressed in angles so I
07:35 - probably could do some kind of rotation
07:37 - based on them and translation and this
07:40 - would be a valid strategy and I
07:41 - encourage you to maybe try that and post
07:43 - about it in the comments I'm going to do
07:44 - it using Mac's
07:45 - which is by that I mean I want to look
07:49 - at what is the formula to convert a
07:51 - latitude and longitude the angle for
07:55 - horizontal and vertical angle location
07:57 - into XYZ coordinates and this is what's
08:00 - known as spherical coordinates now again
08:02 - if I look I had this page open and then
08:06 - I went to a different web page so if I
08:09 - go to the Wikipedia page we can find
08:12 - where where where where here we go right
08:15 - here we can find these formulas so I
08:17 - encourage you to read up and look at the
08:19 - derivation of these formulas and how it
08:21 - works but essentially here I can look at
08:23 - the radius times sine of the latitude
08:27 - times cosine of the longitude
08:28 - now notice latitude it should be between
08:31 - 0 and PI and longitude should be between
08:34 - 0 and 2pi so one thing I'm going to need
08:37 - to do is adjust that range in order to
08:39 - get that full the full
08:42 - fear and because the values I'm getting
08:44 - her between negative you know negative
08:47 - pi divided by two pi divided by two so
08:49 - what I want to do now is I'm going to
08:51 - say right here I'm estate float latitude
08:55 - equals firstly I need to say like Donna
08:57 - called latitude so I'm going to call
08:59 - this what I'm gonna call this theta for
09:02 - latitude radians of latitude Plus and
09:08 - what did I say plus up high divided by 2
09:11 - because I want to go from negative 92 92
09:13 - zero to 180 and then I'm going to say
09:16 - float fee equals radians of longitude
09:20 - plus PI then I can literally apply these
09:24 - formulas x equals x equals where is this
09:29 - formula R times sine of last two times
09:32 - cosine of longitude R times sine of
09:34 - latitude times cosine of 1 to 2 oh and
09:39 - this should be theta and V and y is what
09:47 - sign sign sign sign and Z is R times
09:56 - cosine of theta R times cosine of theta
10:02 - theta and now what I can do is I can
10:06 - offer them what are R is the radius how
10:09 - far from the center am I going to
10:12 - position this point and in this case I
10:14 - made a sphere 200 so why not actually
10:17 - say R equals 200 make the sphere with
10:21 - that radius and then I'm going to say
10:23 - translate X comma Y comma Z and I'm
10:27 - going to say box make a box that's like
10:30 - box is a function in processing that
10:33 - will make a 3-dimensional box and I'm
10:35 - going to make it 10 by 10 by 10 by 10 by
10:37 - 10 I guess it's just the only three
10:38 - dimensions with the height yep 10 by 10
10:41 - by 10
10:42 - okay well let's run this and see what I
10:44 - get where's that box there it is so you
10:50 - know is this in the right place
10:51 - loud and clear maybe my axes are flipped
10:54 - you know
10:56 - um there's really the question of like
10:58 - well what you know am I looking at the
11:00 - earth upside down right side up what's
11:02 - up so I mean there's no of having this
11:04 - discussion really hub coffee for my
11:07 - children like we're standing on the
11:08 - upside down part of the earth it's like
11:11 - what do you mean the upside down part of
11:12 - the earth it really depends on which way
11:14 - you're looking at it right so sort of
11:16 - interesting philosophical questions that
11:17 - I'm not going to get into but you can
11:19 - see I have now mapped a point yeah and
11:22 - my axes are flipped to to the to the
11:25 - earth itself so I could if I wanted to
11:28 - probably what would I do is make
11:31 - something negative
11:33 - maybe the Y value negative would put it
11:35 - on the bottom let's try that there we go
11:40 - so that's probably all I need to do to
11:41 - sort of flip the axes at least in this
11:42 - point right now and that's you know
11:44 - somewhere if we were looking we if we
11:46 - mapped earth we've got um we've got
11:49 - Australia down there we've got Melbourne
11:50 - okay so now now that we have this
11:52 - working it's just time to go get the
11:54 - data whoo yay let's go get the data so
11:57 - one thing I'm going to do in processing
11:59 - that thrills me to no end is there is a
12:01 - there's a whole set of data classes in
12:04 - processing and you can there's there's
12:06 - classes for working with a JSON based
12:10 - data XML based data just raw text data
12:13 - but the particular class that I want to
12:15 - use is called table and the table object
12:17 - is an object that can load on tabular
12:20 - data and some formats might be on
12:22 - spreadsheet formats like a tab delimited
12:24 - file a comma separated file and it so
12:27 - happens that the earthquake data is
12:30 - comma separated data and you might
12:32 - remember this if you watch the previous
12:33 - challenge what's comma separated data
12:35 - I'll show you so so if I go back to the
12:39 - US Geological Survey website and I just
12:44 - get let me just get the earthquakes for
12:47 - the past day I'm going to click on this
12:50 - link and then what I'm going to do my
12:55 - chat here is not scrolling when we go
12:57 - down here oh great I'm going to give me
12:59 - some world texture links I'm going to
13:00 - come back to that in a second so what
13:03 - I'm going to do here is
13:05 - I'm going to say and setup table equals
13:09 - load table books and I need to put
13:13 - double quotes and then I'm going to
13:15 - paste that link to the CSV right there
13:17 - in the code so let's look at processing
13:22 - gorg load table I think I spelled that
13:26 - wrong but you found it anyway so this is
13:28 - what comma separated data looks like it
13:31 - is it's often has a first a text file
13:35 - that has a first row which is header
13:37 - information so an ID followed by a
13:39 - species followed by a name and then each
13:42 - of the next row would be rows of data so
13:45 - there's a goat with an ID a 0 and a
13:48 - species a leopard with an ID of 1 a
13:50 - zebra with an ID of 2 so so this is the
13:54 - kind of data now what what does the
13:57 - earthquake data look like I can actually
14:00 - just paste whoops I can just paste that
14:02 - URL into the browser it's not it's going
14:04 - to download that CSV file and then I can
14:07 - open it in Mac preview oh look there's
14:09 - only one earthquake I better get some
14:10 - more data so in fine we'll use this just
14:13 - to start with and you can see what what
14:15 - the data is it's got a header row time
14:18 - latitude longitude depth magnitude and
14:20 - then it's got the data itself in the
14:21 - next row and if there were many more
14:23 - earthquakes there would be many more
14:25 - rows so I did only significant today so
14:30 - I did only have a significant which is
14:32 - only been one so far but this is good
14:33 - for us to start with ok because so now
14:36 - what I'm going to do is one thing I need
14:38 - to do in the load table function is I
14:42 - need to go to the end and add comma
14:44 - header this is a second optional
14:46 - argument to the load table function that
14:48 - tells processing that tells load table
14:51 - function that back CSV file has a header
14:53 - row and this is incredibly useful
14:55 - because now we can start to ask for data
14:58 - by Nate it will parse that test little
15:01 - partially tabular data with the
15:02 - knowledge of that header row so in in
15:06 - the draw loop what I want to do now is
15:10 - say for and I want to iterate over all
15:15 - of the rows of data
15:18 - each row is can be accessed in an object
15:21 - called a table row sink for table row
15:26 - row in table get rows so this is kind of
15:33 - a fancy maybe that's not right
15:35 - table Road table dot rows so this is a
15:38 - very fancy kind of loop this is a loop a
15:41 - Java enhanced loop that's like a for
15:44 - each kind of loop that says tables at
15:46 - Rose returns this iterator objects that
15:49 - kind of provide you all of the roads and
15:51 - this Luke says I want to look at each
15:53 - row one at a time and then for each row
15:56 - I can start to get data like I can say
15:58 - float lat equals row get float latitude
16:04 - so this is what's so incredibly useful
16:06 - if I load a CSV with etter information I
16:09 - can just access the data in each row
16:12 - based on what the headers name is and I
16:14 - can also if I know what kind of data it
16:16 - is whether it's a float or an int or a
16:18 - string I can call a particular get
16:20 - function and I can say float longitude
16:23 - equals row get float and you can see by
16:25 - the way I have code completion turned on
16:27 - the processing IDE so this is a feature
16:29 - of processing tree so it's and a
16:31 - longitude and then another thing I might
16:34 - want is a magnitude so let's just do
16:41 - print line lat/long magnitude just to
16:44 - see that that that data came out so if I
16:48 - now run this sketch I should see in the
16:52 - console loop there is no column name
16:55 - magnitude so I didn't pay close enough
16:57 - attention the the column name is
16:59 - actually just ma G format for magnitude
17:02 - so if I come back here and change this
17:04 - to mag and now if I run it there we go
17:08 - it's prettier over and over again but
17:10 - you can see that data is coming in
17:12 - latitude longitude and magnitudes so now
17:15 - what I could do is take we don't really
17:19 - need this this was just for testing I'm
17:21 - going to remove that I'm going to come
17:23 - down here and I'm going to take this
17:25 - code
17:29 - and I'm going to put it right here so
17:32 - now I can whatever I get from the data
17:35 - source I can now apply my conversion to
17:37 - XYZ now here's the thing if this is
17:42 - going to work now with just one box but
17:45 - ultimately I'm probably going to want
17:47 - many boxes so these translations that
17:49 - translated to XYZ needs to apply to each
17:53 - individual earthquake that I'm accessing
17:55 - so in order to not have the translates
17:58 - accumulate I need to add push matrix
18:01 - which is saving the current
18:02 - transformation state then I translate
18:04 - that I draw the box pop matrix which
18:07 - restores it so when it comes back in to
18:08 - the next one that previous translate
18:10 - won't affect it okay here we go we
18:13 - should see an earthquake somewhere now I
18:17 - you know I probably should number one
18:20 - make this box quite a bit larger maybe
18:22 - what I want to do is say fill 255 -
18:25 - because that's the same color I have for
18:27 - the sphere I don't know what the spheres
18:29 - but yes so you can see there it is there
18:31 - it is on the sphere itself now let's go
18:35 - grab a lot of earthquakes from the last
18:38 - month and I'm going to go back to the
18:42 - USGS website and I'm going to go to past
18:45 - 30 days
18:46 - all earthquakes it's probably a terrible
18:49 - idea but I'm going to do it anyway and
18:51 - I'm now going to put that in here look
18:56 - I'm going to one thing I want to do is I
18:58 - want to just leave both case I need to
19:00 - do testing at some point I'll comment
19:03 - out the one day significant I will paste
19:08 - this in here and save now I'm getting
19:12 - everything for a month and then I'm
19:15 - going to run it we're gonna see a lot of
19:17 - spheres look at this there are all the
19:19 - earthquakes maps all over the sphere
19:23 - yeah that looks kind of reasonable let
19:28 - me let me change that now to make the
19:33 - box a little bit smaller okay so this
19:37 - looks more regional now there's a couple
19:39 - things I want to do
19:40 - I want to now angle I what I want is for
19:46 - the boxes to be extruded out based on
19:50 - the magnitude now I could just make the
19:54 - hole size I could just so I have a like
19:58 - a cube right the Box function only will
20:05 - ever draw a cube for me what I actually
20:08 - want to draw is something that can be
20:11 - like this boy I can't draw at all but
20:15 - you get the idea
20:16 - well what did I do you get the idea
20:18 - right I want to make there we go
20:21 - what am I making it worse I want to make
20:25 - a like a tower so box is a really
20:29 - convenient function to use because it
20:30 - gives me food just a box but for to make
20:33 - this kind of tower thing what I need to
20:35 - do is design my own shape so this
20:38 - particular shape I can create myself by
20:42 - saying begin shape and shape and then I
20:48 - could set a whole lot of vertices so I
20:50 - think about one of these planes just in
20:52 - the bottom this could be like the point
20:54 - negative 1 comma negative 1 comma
20:57 - negative 1 like if it and then this
21:00 - could be the point over here 1 comma
21:02 - negative 1 comma negative 1 right if
21:04 - this is sort of Z I could kind of just
21:06 - figure out and I could I could make a
21:08 - quad for this part of the of the I hope
21:11 - to call this tower it's almost like a
21:13 - cylinder but a box cylinder rectangle
21:15 - what if I call that's why gotta have a
21:16 - name looking to take here everyone's
21:19 - room above I'm seeing all the YouTube
21:21 - comments now so I could set all the
21:25 - points for this quad the miss quad miss
21:26 - quad miss quad miss quad miss quad how
21:28 - many quads with that it's 6 so what I'm
21:30 - going to do I'm going to come back over
21:32 - here and a box takes three arguments
21:37 - Thank You chat so I couldn't could do
21:40 - that but let's take a look oh thank you
21:42 - that's wonderful
21:43 - let's look at box processing cuddly so
21:46 - that's how you would have to do your own
21:47 - shape
21:49 - but and now seeing that I can actually
21:51 - give it three arguments and the three
21:53 - arguments are with height and depth so I
21:57 - think what I'm going to do is okay so
22:00 - let's just do I have the magnitude here
22:03 - I have it in mag and remember a
22:05 - magnitude for earthquake is based on the
22:09 - Richter scale
22:10 - so what I need to do is and then of
22:14 - course I have to think about the volume
22:15 - of but let's not worry about that too
22:18 - much let's just think about the height
22:19 - map to magnitude so what I'm going to do
22:22 - is say float H equals power 10 to the
22:27 - magnitudes 10 to the power of magnitude
22:30 - and then I can do a mapping which is if
22:34 - I say like max H is I think I used you
22:37 - know 10 to the 10th power I can actually
22:40 - just say H equals map itself from zero
22:43 - to max H to between you know 10 and 100
22:49 - so now what I'm going to do is I could
22:52 - say maybe the width and height are
22:54 - always going to be maybe I want the
22:56 - height to be H and the X and z dimension
23:00 - the sort of width and depth will always
23:02 - be 5 so let's see what I get there okay
23:08 - oh so I can't tell if this work let me
23:14 - write let me not worry about this
23:16 - actually for a second let me just see if
23:18 - I can make some tall one so I'm going to
23:21 - make some with like a height of 100 and
23:23 - width
23:24 - okay so this is doing something but
23:27 - they're all pointing straight up so
23:28 - here's the next issue I want them to be
23:31 - pointing so then this is like a hard
23:33 - problem so if this is my sphere and I
23:41 - have something right on the edge of the
23:43 - sphere it's right now it's just pointing
23:45 - straight up I wanted to point out as if
23:48 - there was a ray shooting from the center
23:50 - of the sphere to the edge and continuing
23:52 - straight out so I have that ray the
23:55 - vector its position relative to the
23:56 - center I need to rotate this box to
23:59 - align it with that
24:01 - ray I probably could apply the rotation
24:04 - and translate out again but I'm going to
24:06 - have to do this with some math so one
24:09 - thing that I need I think math wise to
24:11 - do this is I need a vector which is just
24:17 - the axis like a kind of like let's sort
24:20 - normalized access that I can relate
24:22 - everything to and I'm going to make use
24:24 - it at the x-axis so I'm going to make a
24:26 - new vector which is the x-axis so a
24:29 - vector that the unit vector pointing
24:31 - along the x axis x axis is just 1 0 for
24:40 - y 0 for Z ok now where where am I here
24:44 - now what I'm going to do is I want to
24:48 - look at the angle between the x-axis and
24:56 - the vector itself so if this is my
25:00 - vector I want if I'm going to rotate
25:03 - kind of relative to the x axis I want to
25:05 - rotate it like this based on that angle
25:08 - so the nice thing is there's a function
25:11 - in p5 that use I'm sorry in processing
25:13 - but also p5 that uses the dot product
25:16 - behind-the-scenes another vector
25:17 - operation that I have some video
25:19 - tutorials about that give you that angle
25:21 - between so what I want to do here what I
25:26 - want to do here is say P vector and
25:30 - angle B for angle between but that's it
25:34 - really that's really like the I don't
25:37 - use angle because I'm using it already
25:38 - like yes angle between equals P vector
25:43 - dot angle between the x-axis and pause
25:49 - now remember pause is that oh there is
25:52 - no pause I'm saying cause I have to make
25:54 - a pause P vector equals new P vector
25:58 - pause X pause why pause V that position
26:02 - vector is the vector that points out
26:04 - from the center pause know what I think
26:07 - cause I'm doing this like I'm losing my
26:09 - mind
26:09 - XYZ so pause equals that P vector X Y Z
26:13 - okay this is good this is good so now I
26:16 - want an angle between the x-axis and
26:19 - pause what could you possibly be
26:21 - complaining about errors slope does not
26:26 - match oh yeah
26:27 - the angle between is a float not a
26:29 - vector it's just a float so by the way
26:30 - what did I let me just so you can see
26:33 - that it gave me this error type mismatch
26:36 - float does not match with cross link or
26:39 - P vector so you get an error like that
26:41 - it's because this function angle between
26:43 - returns a float and I said to set into a
26:45 - P vector which makes no sense what I
26:48 - want to do is establish a vector which
26:52 - is what I'm going to rotate around so
26:56 - for example this is the x-axis this is
26:58 - me rotating around the x-axis and what I
27:01 - want to do if I come back to over here
27:04 - right what I want to do if I want to
27:07 - rotate if I want to take this and I
27:11 - essentially want to I don't I want to
27:13 - rotate it to this point I want to rotate
27:16 - around the axis that's actually
27:19 - perpendicular out from these two vectors
27:22 - I'm not doing a very good job of
27:23 - explaining that this really needs a more
27:25 - thoughtful diagram I'm going to try to
27:30 - explain why we need the cross products
27:32 - here so let me diagram out what we have
27:35 - so far we have the x-axis and then we
27:42 - have a vector I'm going to use dot to
27:44 - note that this is coming out as if it
27:46 - were coming out like this this is the
27:49 - position but actually a way to think
27:53 - about that let's say the position is on
27:55 - a two-dimensional plane like the x-axis
27:57 - right so what I ultimately need is to
28:00 - roll this is so good this is good
28:02 - what I need is to rotate this like this
28:05 - right this is what I'm drawing a box
28:08 - that's pointing straight up and I want
28:10 - to rotate it like this to match that
28:12 - direction so I need an angle to rotate
28:15 - it by and I'm going to be able to get
28:17 - that with this angle between that's the
28:23 - angle that I need to rotate it by maybe
28:26 - if I'm actually drawing
28:27 - this way is a better way to think of it
28:29 - so I might actually need to fix the box
28:30 - to be drawn this way and I want to
28:32 - rotate it like this so what access do I
28:34 - need to rotate it around this axis right
28:38 - I need to rotate it around this X now in
28:40 - this case if it was just 2d I know it
28:42 - just rotated around perfectly the z axis
28:45 - but what I want to do is called rotation
28:47 - around an arbitrary axis so let's say
28:49 - this was actually so instead of the
28:51 - position being on the same plane as the
28:54 - x axis what is the position we're
28:56 - pointing out here the axis that I want
28:57 - to rotate out is now perpendicular out
28:59 - maybe this way the way I get a vector
29:03 - that is perpendicular to two vectors
29:07 - that are connected is with something
29:09 - called the cross-product okay so let's
29:12 - look at a diagram that I think will help
29:14 - explain this this is if this is vector a
29:18 - and this is vector V B this is showing
29:21 - you a and those vectors make a plane the
29:24 - cross-product is the vector a cross B
29:27 - points out perpendicular from that plane
29:29 - so this is exactly the operation that I
29:32 - need to do to get that rotation axis so
29:36 - if I come back to my code I should be
29:39 - able to say now rotation axis I'll just
29:45 - call it our axis our axis equals x axis
29:51 - dot cross position and now here what did
29:57 - I get wrong oh and that's the vector
30:00 - right so the cross product returns a
30:03 - vector the angle between function
30:05 - returns an angle so now that I have the
30:07 - rotation axis I want to rotate around an
30:10 - arbitrary axis now how do you do that
30:12 - let's go look in the processing
30:14 - reference about rotate oh this is
30:17 - exciting
30:18 - processing morgue because distance might
30:21 - be a feature you weren't aware of
30:23 - there's this rotate function rotate is a
30:26 - function that you give it an angle look
30:27 - it rotates now it only says only thing
30:32 - you can give it as an angle but there's
30:34 - also like rotate X and that you can give
30:38 - it an angle and rotate Y so
30:41 - built into processing our rotation
30:45 - function for specific axis to x axis the
30:49 - y axis the z axis x y z ok so those are
30:55 - built into processing but I want to
30:57 - rotate around an arbitrary axis well
30:59 - this is not documented here in the in
31:02 - the main reference but this is actually
31:04 - a feature of the rotate function you
31:06 - could find it if you look at the Java
31:07 - Docs for processing for certain like
31:09 - advanced more advanced features what I
31:11 - can actually do is I can say rotate and
31:15 - I want to rotate by that angle remember
31:18 - I want to rotate by that angle around an
31:20 - arbitrary axis I could say our axis X or
31:23 - x sy our axis Z so the rotate function
31:28 - can actually take four arguments which
31:30 - is the angle of rotation and the XYZ of
31:33 - a vector of an axis of rotation and I
31:35 - think I got that right it could be that
31:37 - the egg the Angeles laughs I'm pretty
31:39 - sure the angle is first so let's now run
31:42 - this oh but I don't want to do the
31:44 - rotation here I want to do the rotation
31:48 - right here so after I translate to that
31:50 - location I want to rotate so let's now
31:52 - do that and we said oh that doesn't look
31:56 - right it's certainly rotating but it
31:58 - doesn't look right so I think the issue
32:00 - here is that I didn't draw what it what
32:04 - I did is I drew my looks wrong long I if
32:09 - I have that earth and I had that I kind
32:13 - of drew my boxes pointing up but then
32:15 - rotated to the x axis I mean I think I
32:17 - need to draw the boxes with the
32:19 - extrusion along the x axis for this to
32:21 - make sense so let me change that to the
32:25 - boxes the extrusion the value that's
32:27 - larger being the x value and there we go
32:32 - ah it works
32:33 - oh my god I'm so pleased oh that was
32:37 - really painful but totally work and I'm
32:40 - very pleased to see that Network so now
32:42 - in theory what I should be able to do is
32:44 - have the height be mapped to the
32:48 - earthquakes magnitude so let's put that
32:50 - back in
32:53 - and make this each and there we go now I
33:00 - guess I don't have okay so I'm not
33:05 - really able to see the distinctions very
33:08 - well between the particular earthquakes
33:10 - so I'm going to kind of fudge it here
33:12 - and I'm going to say like well I'm
33:13 - probably actually not there's really not
33:15 - any earthquakes right now in my data I
33:18 - have a magnitude of 10 so I'm going to
33:20 - just really consider the maximum that is
33:22 - like on the Richter scale of seven and
33:24 - then I'm going to map those ones that
33:25 - have a of a magnitude of seven to 100
33:29 - pixels and the lower ones to ten and if
33:31 - I do that we should see here on getting
33:35 - some variations you can see there was
33:36 - one particularly really large earthquake
33:38 - and the other thing that's going on here
33:40 - is I've drawn these boxes actually be as
33:43 - a center the center is on the edge of
33:45 - the sphere so there's actually a rain
33:46 - going all the way inside - that's
33:48 - probably cuing the stuff so I think we
33:50 - have to be more thoughtful about the
33:51 - relative scaling of these but you know
33:54 - we're getting something you know
33:55 - whatever that data might be you might
33:57 - not have earthquake data you could sort
33:59 - of see what the possibilities are here I
34:01 - could add color I could add textures I
34:03 - could be much more thoughtful let's do
34:04 - one thing just to see how kind of
34:07 - problematic what I've done is in a way
34:10 - if I want to actually see the you know
34:13 - what what we typically look like as the
34:15 - earth so I need to find a nice texture
34:18 - image to texture that sphere so let me
34:21 - go look for that okay I'm back
34:23 - I found there's a lot of places on the
34:26 - internet to get images of the earth I
34:29 - would attempt to use one from NASA NASA
34:33 - visible Earth I you know there's so many
34:36 - possibilities here I'm just going to
34:39 - grab November or
34:42 - I don't know December blue marble next
34:45 - generation and I'm going to download the
34:47 - image here I want just sort of the
34:49 - smallest one right now from the download
34:51 - this one and I'm gonna hit save and I'm
34:54 - going to go to my where is this project
34:58 - saved earthquakes 3d let me save this to
35:02 - the desktop earthquake 3d and then I'm
35:06 - going to save this to earthquake 3d I'm
35:08 - going to make a data folder and I am
35:11 - going to save this image I'm just going
35:13 - to call it a world
35:15 - earth earth JPEG alright now one thing I
35:20 - want to do is I want to check the
35:21 - dimensions of this image so I want to go
35:25 - to processing and go to look at that
35:27 - image and do it get info 5400 by 2700
35:32 - sure why not let's just see if that
35:36 - works what not I said I wanted to check
35:38 - it and I'm like whatever it is is fine
35:39 - so here's the thing I can actually
35:42 - texture this sphere very very easily I
35:46 - think I might need to bring in a pshape
35:48 - object so let's just see first I want to
35:50 - I need an image and I'm going to call
35:52 - that image earth and then in setup I am
35:55 - going to say earth equals load image
35:59 - Earth's JPEG so now I have access to
36:03 - that image in the computer's memory just
36:05 - to be sure that this is working I'm
36:06 - going to say image earth 0 0 so now I'm
36:10 - just going to kind of draw that image in
36:12 - the background and we can see there it
36:14 - is there's an image of the earth so in
36:16 - the background I've got that image
36:17 - loaded now in theory what I would want
36:19 - to be able to do is just say texture
36:21 - earth right before I draw the sphere but
36:28 - that doesn't work so the way that I you
36:32 - can't I don't I don't believe in
36:33 - processing it works to automatically
36:36 - texture one of these primitive shapes of
36:38 - sphere actually is a shape that's built
36:41 - up by many different triangles but what
36:44 - I can do however is create a P shape and
36:48 - I'm going to call that globe this is
36:51 - already called something earth and I'm
36:52 - going to say globe E
36:55 - we'll create shape and then I think all
36:59 - I need to do is say fear and then give
37:01 - it let's make the radius a global
37:05 - variable and then give it a radius
37:08 - I think this now just create shapes this
37:11 - is a shape object that is a sphere and
37:13 - that has a radius now I should be able
37:16 - to say here where I'm drawing the sphere
37:19 - now I should be able to say and let me
37:21 - get rid of this texture I should be able
37:25 - to say shaped shape globe so I'm drawing
37:32 - instead of drawing the sphere as like
37:34 - and actually this is much more efficient
37:36 - but instead of computing for your
37:38 - geometry over and over again I have this
37:39 - work saved see your object that I'm just
37:42 - drawing into the into the scene so there
37:47 - we go now you can see the sphere that
37:48 - now I have it now it has a default
37:50 - stroke and it has a which is black and
37:54 - it also has a default fill so what I
37:56 - want to do first of all is I want to get
37:59 - rid of drawing me in that image and I
38:01 - want to I think I could say no stroke
38:06 - and then I think I can say just globe
38:09 - texture and then that Earth image so I
38:13 - think now this will give me that image
38:17 - of the earth actually the function is
38:21 - not called texture I forgot it's called
38:23 - set texture that's the way to set it set
38:27 - a particular image to auto texture that
38:30 - particular shape so now let's try
38:32 - running this and there we go so now you
38:36 - can see my earth is textured with that
38:39 - image from NASA and the earthquakes are
38:41 - on it however I have done something
38:45 - rather incorrect which is that if I kind
38:48 - of zoom in and look at this these
38:49 - earthquakes are just not in the right
38:51 - place if I slow down we slow down this
38:53 - rotation and because if you remember
38:57 - from that there's a lot of earthquakes
38:58 - that happen along at least along the
39:00 - California coast of the United States
39:02 - and up into Alaska and I think we'll be
39:06 - able to kind of see that collection of
39:07 - earthquakes
39:08 - here it is that's that collection of
39:10 - earthquakes that kind of goes along
39:12 - I haven't aligned the texture with this
39:15 - or XYZ transformation so this I'm going
39:18 - to leave as a challenge it's code will
39:20 - get published to figure that out and you
39:23 - know number one is I probably don't need
39:25 - to flip this why maybe flipping this why
39:27 - I might need to do something where I
39:29 - kind of rotate the earth into the right
39:31 - position to align so I'm not really I'm
39:34 - gonna research this I'll come back next
39:35 - week and show on the livestream
39:39 - solutions to this particular problem but
39:42 - but and also here's the thing regardless
39:45 - of that earth texture there's so much
39:47 - that you could do with this what other
39:49 - kind of data could you map to a 3d
39:51 - version of the earth what other what
39:55 - other ways could you visualize the
39:56 - earthquake data color you could
39:57 - certainly use you know particles
39:59 - emanating you know you could time-lapse
40:02 - and show earthquakes over time or a very
40:04 - long period of time might be interesting
40:06 - are other kinds of data so hopefully
40:08 - this gives you this this tutorial gives
40:10 - you a sense of how to work with 3d how
40:13 - some of the math can get kind of tricky
40:15 - when you start in with vectors and
40:16 - rotations and also just we're a little
40:19 - bit about working with data in
40:20 - processing okay thanks very much and
40:22 - I'll see you in the future Cody Johnson
