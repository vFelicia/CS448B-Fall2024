00:01 - oh there's a big lag between your video
00:03 - and your sound
00:06 - seems to have froze
00:13 - technical difficulties
00:18 - okay am i back now
00:20 - uh yes okay and i think we're
00:22 - broadcasting but how do i get the link
00:24 - of where we're broadcasting
00:26 - if you go to your
00:29 - your page and you yeah i see it i've got
00:31 - it now
00:36 - but
00:37 - email oh it's muting my mic because i'm
00:39 - typing your video
00:44 - so i i don't know how to send this to
00:45 - myself
00:47 - can you see it
00:49 - like if i go
00:52 - what do you want
00:57 - that url
00:59 - yeah the url if you're oh you did you
01:02 - chatted i just put it in the chat yeah
01:05 - okay thank you
01:06 - uh so now
01:09 - uh
01:10 - voice is going well so far
01:15 - [Music]
01:17 - chat here
01:22 - so i also have
01:27 - okay i'm gonna leave
01:30 - oh oh
01:32 - foiled by
01:35 - my power i only have one power cord oh
01:38 - no
01:40 - and i have two laptops going okay i'm
01:42 - gonna have to switch back and forth
01:44 - okay because the hangout like is sucking
01:46 - the battery okay oh uh okay here i can
01:49 - bring stuff in there i'll i'll i'll come
01:51 - help you
01:53 - well there's trust you can't even open
01:54 - the door
01:58 - because i moved all the furniture to the
02:00 - corner it's fine
02:03 - it's fine this laptop has
02:09 - 33 battery
02:11 - so we'll just sort of charge back and
02:13 - forth all right hello um
02:15 - i have a chat room here oh antonius is
02:18 - in the chat room hi
02:20 - and he's also in the google hangout
02:22 - hello antonius okay welcome
02:24 - this is a test of the emergency
02:27 - processing broadcasting system
02:31 - and uh
02:33 - what's happening here right now is that
02:36 - um
02:39 - in the um
02:41 - in the fall i'm planning to do a regular
02:44 - live broadcast from this office
02:49 - uh and allow people to uh call in or
02:52 - send questions and uh to help people
02:54 - with processing programming questions
02:56 - and it's very hot in this room right now
02:58 - i have a chat room here
03:01 - oh i'm hearing myself
03:03 - because
03:07 - shoot
03:09 - are you hearing yourself
03:11 - yeah where would that come from
03:13 - i don't know where that came from okay
03:15 - um
03:17 - and uh let's see how many viewers do we
03:19 - have
03:22 - does it say
03:23 - if anyone's actually watching the
03:24 - problem is this is gonna be recorded
03:27 - um
03:28 - well i feel like the last test went
03:29 - better than this one um off air on this
03:33 - side for me
03:35 - it says off air
03:38 - huh
03:40 - i think it's broadcasting
03:46 - let's see
03:49 - no it's there it's showing up
03:52 - something is broadcasting
03:53 - um
04:00 - uh
04:01 - okay so
04:02 - we the i was saying something really
04:05 - important
04:07 - which is this is just a test this
04:08 - doesn't count
04:10 - when we really do it they'll be like
04:12 - music and you know
04:15 - credits and
04:16 - an opening speech lots of things like
04:18 - that
04:19 - so the goal is to sort of attempt to see
04:21 - if how can work to answer people's
04:23 - processing questions programming
04:24 - questions either via
04:27 - um yeah but
04:29 - alan partridge writes in and says maybe
04:30 - the sound came from someone else's
04:32 - computer and i think that's quite likely
04:34 - thanks alan um
04:37 - uh
04:37 - i by the way if you're watching the
04:39 - broadcast you're actually watching like
04:41 - a few minutes
04:43 - i feel like something's gonna light on
04:44 - fire in here because it's much hotter
04:46 - than it normally is
04:47 - but anyway i'm just gonna keep going
04:51 - alright so um so we're gonna see what
04:53 - happens with people asking questions
04:55 - live we're gonna see what happens if
04:56 - people ask questions over the chat
04:59 - um as well as perhaps even
05:02 - questions on twitter which maybe i'll
05:03 - try to check so um antonio are you still
05:06 - there
05:08 - yeah i'm here oh awesome okay so um
05:12 - can you i um
05:14 - uh you you wrote in a question um with a
05:17 - nice diagram can you ask it and i'll try
05:19 - drawing your diagram while you're
05:22 - i would like to
05:24 - wrap a sine wave around a circle
05:29 - but then i'd like to transform it
05:32 - to a different kind of wave
05:34 - like maybe a sawtooth or triangle wave
05:38 - smoothly
05:41 - so
05:44 - i'm drawing this poorly but something
05:45 - like this right yes
05:48 - you have this wave pattern around a
05:49 - circle and it maybe you can undulate it
05:51 - can do things that can transform to
05:53 - another pattern transform back
05:55 - exactly
05:57 - okay so
05:59 - this is very strange i don't know what
06:01 - i'm doing okay so i have an idea for how
06:03 - this could work so first i think before
06:05 - we can even approach this problem so
06:06 - this is probably by the way a question i
06:08 - think see i want to look at i got to
06:11 - turn this off
06:12 - i have this instinct to look at the
06:14 - screen over there which is where i see
06:15 - an antonius's face in other people's
06:17 - face but really the camera is where i
06:18 - should look so um
06:22 - the first thing i think we need to
06:23 - establish is simply how we would draw
06:25 - a pattern around the the outline of a
06:28 - circle so for example um how would we
06:31 - even now we know we can draw a circle by
06:33 - saying ellipse
06:35 - right in processing so we know we can
06:36 - draw a circle by saying ellipse but what
06:38 - is a circle
06:40 - other than
06:42 - a series of points
06:44 - on a radial path that are connected and
06:47 - depending on the resolution of those
06:49 - connections the circle might look more
06:51 - like a polygon versus a nice smooth
06:52 - circle so
06:55 - one of the things we can do is we can
06:56 - use polar to cartesian coordinates
06:59 - you know in the context of doing these
07:01 - videos it's an interesting question of
07:03 - like okay well what you know have you
07:05 - people watching might have just started
07:07 - using processing they might have used it
07:08 - for two years but at this moment we're
07:09 - gonna have to just assume kind of basic
07:11 - knowledge of understanding polar
07:13 - coordinates polar coordinate is a
07:16 - coordinate that is defined by an angle
07:18 - known as theta and a radius which is
07:20 - different than the cartesian coordinate
07:22 - which is defined by some amount along
07:24 - the x-axis and some along
07:26 - a y-axis antony so you're familiar with
07:29 - polar and cartesian coordinates
07:32 - can i say yes so we can move on
07:34 - yes yes
07:36 - yes
07:37 - okay excellent so
07:39 - now if i come over here
07:41 - if i can wake up this computer i think
07:43 - what we'll do is make a little simple
07:44 - sketch for a second
07:47 - that implements this so here i've got
07:49 - processing 2.0
07:51 - and what i'm going to do is i'm just
07:52 - going to write setup
07:54 - i'm going to make up some size
07:57 - and i'm going to have draw
07:59 - and i'm going to have a black background
08:02 - and what we need to do is we need to say
08:04 - okay
08:05 - let's
08:06 - make a loop
08:08 - where we walk around
08:10 - and look at every single point
08:14 - um where we where we walk around and
08:17 - look and find every single point along
08:19 - this path and draw it on the screen and
08:21 - the way that we do that is we might say
08:23 - hey
08:24 - we need a loop that goes
08:26 - for every angle an angle called a
08:29 - all the way up to two pi
08:31 - uh where we go up by just like some
08:34 - small amount
08:36 - and we have some radius
08:39 - and we can now we can use that polar
08:41 - cartesian coordinate transformation
08:47 - let's see what this does and let's just
08:49 - we're still looking at the whiteboard
08:50 - thank you
08:52 - we can just draw
08:54 - a little circle there if we run this
08:56 - uh
08:59 - let's run this little piece of code and
09:01 - oh okay so we can see we've almost got
09:03 - something right right we kind of like we
09:05 - have a bunch of circles that are kind of
09:07 - in the powder circle but we forgot
09:09 - they're all around the corner so one
09:11 - thing i'm going to do just with this
09:12 - sketch is use the translate method to
09:15 - translate to the center of the window
09:18 - and we can see now that we've drawn that
09:20 - circle hooray but uh and we can see the
09:23 - resolution is based on how you know how
09:28 - how
09:29 - how fast we increment that angle around
09:31 - and we can see here's a bunch of points
09:33 - right angle
09:35 - point one point one point um etc um et
09:38 - cetera et cetera et cetera so this is
09:40 - where we're starting right we need to
09:42 - draw a bunch of points to create this
09:45 - circle we haven't even i think there's
09:46 - like a big question i'm now realizing
09:48 - it's gonna take some more practice
09:49 - figure out how to make this stuff work
09:50 - okay
09:51 - so one thing that we need to figure out
09:53 - how to do is to at least connect those
09:56 - so i can use begin shape
09:58 - and end shape
10:00 - and say uh
10:02 - stroke
10:04 - 255
10:07 - no fill and instead of drawing a circle
10:10 - there i can then say put a vertex at
10:12 - each one of those points
10:16 - so now we can see we have this uh circle
10:18 - that's connected we we've connected each
10:21 - one of those points that we've
10:22 - calculated around the path of a circle
10:24 - we have now connected with a line okay
10:27 - so uh we want to say close here at the
10:30 - end
10:31 - i think i want to say
10:33 - stroke weight 2 so you can see it a
10:35 - little bit better
10:37 - and maybe we want to make the resolution
10:38 - a little bit better and we can see what
10:40 - have we finally gotten
10:42 - we've drawn a circle manually now we now
10:45 - actually have that circle by connecting
10:46 - each one of those points
10:49 - i was kind of going to like time this
10:50 - and figure out what i'm doing here
10:52 - um okay so let's think about where we
10:55 - are now
10:58 - okay so antonio
10:59 - in the way that you asked the question
11:00 - you may have already been that at that
11:02 - at that point already i don't know if
11:04 - that's the case or not
11:05 - but let me ask you a question do you
11:07 - have did you did you get this far and
11:09 - did you um
11:10 - figure out uh how to turn
11:13 - drawing uh this circle path into a sine
11:16 - wave
11:17 - no i did not
11:19 - okay good
11:20 - excellent so this is a really
11:22 - interesting question so let's let's ask
11:24 - ourselves the question now
11:27 - what is the difference between say like
11:30 - this circular path
11:32 - you're doing ship consuming a live thing
11:34 - yeah right
11:37 - hey sean you're uh
11:40 - you're
11:45 - uh
11:46 - there's only three sections
11:49 - you know you're broadcasting this
12:06 - hi scott
12:10 - you're muted
12:17 - hi how are you
12:18 - hi scott
12:20 - how are you all right the one issue one
12:23 - i don't know sean what we can do about
12:25 - this because
12:27 - um
12:30 - whenever anyone new joins the hangout it
12:32 - immediately
12:33 - resets my machine
12:36 - and like logs me out and i have to log
12:37 - back in
12:39 - wow so i killed your broadcast yeah
12:41 - that's okay
12:42 - it's trust me this thing is like long
12:45 - dead
12:48 - okay so we were discussing and tony said
12:50 - we're discussing scott you can uh pipe
12:52 - in at any point that you like is sean
12:54 - still there i'm not sure hope see now
12:55 - i'm just looking at this screen you got
12:57 - to turn that off okay we were discussing
12:59 - the fact that one of the things about
13:01 - drawing this circular path
13:03 - is that every point along this path
13:07 - the distance from the center to that
13:09 - point which we think of as the radius of
13:11 - the circle is the same
13:13 - so the radius is identical
13:16 - right if we think about the case of like
13:18 - a
13:19 - sort of squiggly circle or a sine wave a
13:22 - circular radial path
13:24 - this radius value is going to be
13:25 - different might be 10 might be 9 might
13:28 - be 12 might be 8. so the major first
13:31 - step in kind of implementing this kind
13:34 - of
13:35 - circular radial path that is a sine wave
13:37 - wrapped around or a square wave or no
13:39 - pearl of noise or whatever randomness is
13:51 - oh hello i'm over here now is the fact
13:54 - that the radius can't be constant
13:56 - so if we look at this code you can see
13:59 - here we have this radius of 100. for
14:02 - example if i were to just write in here
14:06 - say radius equals a random value between
14:08 - 50 and 100
14:11 - you can see what we're getting already
14:13 - can you does that come through
14:16 - that's really cool
14:17 - that's really awesome that's exactly
14:20 - the direction i need to go to right so
14:22 - but you don't want uh what you you don't
14:24 - want is random here you want sign
14:27 - so one thing we could do is we could say
14:29 - hey let's use the sine function we
14:32 - already have an angle
14:33 - so let's map sine of that angle which
14:35 - goes between negative 1 and 1 to a
14:37 - radius between 50 and 100 and the thing
14:40 - is that angle is probably not going up
14:43 - fast enough so it's multiplied by five
14:45 - you can sort of see now we have that
14:46 - pattern you know kind of doing this
14:48 - somewhat haphazardly
14:50 - uh let's multiply just by two let's not
14:53 - make it as extreme
14:55 - right
14:59 - yeah
14:59 - i guess four was good anyway you can see
15:02 - five was good
15:06 - there we go
15:07 - make it twelve so you can see do you see
15:09 - how this works what we're doing is we're
15:12 - having a variable
15:13 - radius so as you go around
15:16 - as as you're kind of marching around
15:18 - here sometimes you're out here sometimes
15:20 - you're here sometimes you're there and
15:22 - we get this wave
15:24 - okay
15:25 - so that's kind of step one to this
15:27 - problem and i think um
15:30 - uh uh i um i don't know how far
15:33 - to check like twitter or the chat room i
15:35 - don't know maybe we just need to shut
15:36 - this off now but
15:37 - um let's go let's go a little farther so
15:40 - so let's ask the question i don't know
15:41 - from the audience i suppose let's all
15:43 - discuss
15:44 - what's the next step let's say we
15:46 - figured out like oh we like this pattern
15:48 - and we also like i'm gonna do another
15:51 - one
15:53 - i'm going to use purlin noise
15:55 - so i'm going to use purl and noise of
15:57 - that value purl noise goes between 0 and
15:59 - 1. i'm going to set that between 75 oh i
16:03 - need to map the noise value sorry
16:09 - and uh we're going to make this a much
16:12 - more extreme
16:15 - right so now i used pearly noise right
16:17 - so i got this with pearl noise it's kind
16:19 - of random but a smooth remnants we get
16:22 - this kind of globally globally cloudy
16:25 - right i think it's an island what i
16:28 - think it's an island it's an island yeah
16:30 - it kind of looks like an island so
16:33 - with this line of code with this perlin
16:35 - noise line of code we get an island
16:37 - and with this line of code we get a nice
16:39 - like flower like shape with a sine wave
16:42 - how do we how would we smoothly
16:44 - transition from one to the other
16:46 - it's an interesting question
16:49 - will move over here i will i await your
16:51 - response
16:53 - antonius is showing us his
16:56 - oh i can't i can't see anything but you
16:58 - guys oh okay thanks dan i got to the
17:00 - sine wave circle fire
17:03 - and i have to head out now but i'm gonna
17:05 - keep working on it and see if i can
17:07 - figure out how to transform it smoothly
17:11 - excellent thanks so much thank you for
17:14 - participating antoine is here very nice
17:16 - thank you professor shiffman
17:18 - i'll see you later bye oh wait should i
17:21 - not log out or is it going to destroy
17:22 - your no you can log out it's fine we
17:24 - need to know what go what what happens
17:26 - when people log out anyway so hey dan
17:28 - can you show the code again
17:30 - yeah
17:36 - it says there's six viewers
17:38 - six viewers it's massive we've really
17:41 - hit the big time now
17:44 - oh seven
17:45 - there's five people in the chat
17:50 - and
17:54 - hang out
17:55 - i only see three people in the chat
17:57 - anyone in there
18:00 - let's see what's on twitter here
18:05 - oh so sean you were able to invite
18:07 - somebody yeah i invited scott oh that's
18:11 - interesting that's really good so there
18:13 - could be somebody in theory somebody
18:16 - who's um
18:18 - scott say hello
18:19 - hello
18:20 - there could in theory be somebody
18:23 - whose like job is to like manage the
18:25 - hangout and invite people right right
18:28 - well you're gonna need the person's
18:29 - email address to do that yeah or they're
18:31 - gonna
18:32 - google plus
18:34 - hang out
18:35 - hang out it feels i mean i you know
18:38 - google hangout has served me beautifully
18:40 - on many an occasion but it feels kind of
18:42 - clunky for this yeah i can't get the
18:44 - glass to join this because we don't have
18:46 - this associated with a real name and
18:48 - google destroyed our profile
18:52 - scott do you have any questions about
18:54 - processing you would like to ask
18:57 - uh
18:58 - at the moment
19:00 - no
19:03 - um
19:04 - let's see what we got
19:06 - if you'll excuse me for a moment
19:08 - [Music]
19:12 - i'll mute him
19:14 - you can mute him
19:15 - yeah
19:17 - well i don't know if it needed for you
19:18 - but he muted for me
19:21 - um
19:22 - okay so looking at twitter
19:25 - and
19:26 - i don't see i don't see anyone okay if
19:28 - anyone is out there watching okay
19:31 - josh there's lots of people in a chat
19:33 - here
19:34 - oh joshua davis is there itp burns
19:37 - and richard gill yeah
19:41 - or e
19:45 - uh
19:46 - let me write this down
19:50 - dot info
19:52 - slash
19:54 - channels
19:58 - slash processing
20:00 - is that cut off that's pretty good you
20:02 - can also tweet at shiffman
20:07 - now is the part of the show where i
20:09 - juggle
20:21 - we need a puzzler do you have any uh do
20:24 - you have any challenges for the audience
20:25 - put up the code again somebody yeah
20:27 - that's true okay so oh so maybe i should
20:29 - continue with this because we didn't
20:30 - finish this discussion
20:33 - okay so
20:35 - he where we were before
20:38 - is that with this one line of code
20:40 - we've got this pattern
20:45 - with this second line of code we have
20:48 - this pattern
20:49 - now what we need to do is figure out how
20:51 - to interpolate between the two
20:54 - now there you know there's probably a
20:56 - very kind of advanced sophisticated way
20:58 - of doing this which is we should make
21:01 - these shapes objects and they can keep
21:02 - array lists of vectors which are all the
21:04 - points and then we have one set of
21:06 - points in an arraylist and another set
21:07 - of points between the arraylist we can
21:08 - interpolate between those two and this
21:11 - is actually how i would probably do it
21:13 - but we could kind of do it in a much
21:15 - simpler way right here
21:17 - for example what if i just called this
21:19 - r1
21:21 - and this r2
21:23 - and then i said you know
21:24 - float r equals r1 plus r2 divided by
21:29 - uh what would what would this result in
21:34 - shawn
21:36 - it would it would
21:38 - it would give a little bit of noise to
21:40 - the sign right so
21:42 - it would average an average between the
21:44 - two we get we get halfway between the
21:46 - two but there's no reason why we
21:47 - couldn't just say like hey give me ten
21:50 - percent of one
21:52 - and ten percent
21:54 - um ten percent of the ninety percent of
21:55 - the other one right right much more of
21:57 - the noise and a little bit of the sign
22:00 - do it the other way do it the other way
22:01 - processing has a function for this
22:03 - called lurk so let me give the
22:06 - a value in between r1 and r2 so with
22:09 - lerp
22:11 - this is really what this is this is a
22:13 - wonderful thing to talk about this
22:14 - brings me enormous joy hey i have a
22:16 - question can you wait with lerp the way
22:18 - you did
22:19 - yeah you can wait with lerp okay you
22:21 - mean wait like w-e-i-g-h-t right yeah
22:24 - yeah so that's exactly what we're doing
22:26 - we're going to uh with lerp we're going
22:28 - to have value r1 and we're gonna have
22:30 - value r2 and we could say hey
22:32 - give me sort of the value in between
22:34 - there give me the value over here give
22:37 - me the value in the middle and now if we
22:39 - slide back and forth we're going to see
22:41 - us we're going to see interpolated we're
22:42 - going to see this sort of transformation
22:44 - between those two shapes so let me um
22:48 - let me put a value here like if i put
22:50 - 0.0 no switches code
22:53 - sorry if i put 0.0 in lurk we have the
22:56 - sine wave
22:58 - if i put 1.0 we have 100 r2
23:02 - if i put
23:04 - 0.5 we have 50 of each now watch this
23:08 - so i'm going to call this
23:10 - uh uh
23:12 - i don't know what's called a call i
23:14 - can't think of a variable name
23:16 - um
23:17 - uh
23:18 - percentage i call it percent
23:20 - and at the top of the code here
23:24 - i'm going to say percent equals
23:28 - map mouse x which goes between 0 and
23:30 - width between 0 and 1. so i'm going to
23:33 - use mouse x to set a value between zero
23:35 - and one and use that value in lerp
23:39 - but now you can see here
23:41 - as i move back and forth
23:44 - it's transforming between those two
23:48 - different waves hey this is actually the
23:50 - question that antonio has asked and we
23:51 - did it we solved it in this code
23:53 - i gotta save it and put it somewhere i
23:55 - don't know how to do that i mean i know
23:57 - how to do that i think but
23:59 - hey uh um what does lerp stand for uh
24:02 - lurk linear
24:04 - uh oh whoops this camera shut off let's
24:06 - turn it back on um
24:09 - lerp stands for a linear interpolation
24:13 - so it's a linear interpolation between
24:15 - two points meaning
24:17 - uh if these are the two values we are we
24:20 - are somewhere in between them in a
24:22 - linear fashion as opposed to like an
24:23 - exponential interpolation or a cosine
24:25 - interpolation or something like that
24:27 - um
24:29 - oh somebody answered the question there
24:31 - that's nice
24:32 - um in the chat in the chat
24:35 - and
24:37 - ah
24:39 - okay i got a question over twitter yes
24:41 - joshua davis has a question in the chat
24:43 - ah okay
24:46 - i don't see it how come i don't see it
24:48 - and richard gill wants you to save the
24:49 - files yeah i definitely will how come
24:52 - the chat
24:53 - is not showing for me this
24:58 - maybe this
24:59 - joshua just go ahead and ask the
25:00 - question in in the chat and i'll relay
25:02 - it to dan
25:12 - i
25:17 - i will do dance moves tai chi or some
25:20 - sort of like
25:21 - break dancing while
25:23 - i'm waiting
25:28 - it's weird how i don't see any messages
25:29 - in the chat
25:31 - maybe you need to refresh
25:33 - i did refresh and it cleared everything
25:37 - but there was a question on twitter
25:41 - which says how would i make a disc spin
25:43 - okay this is from uh noel murphy at vdu
25:47 - hey dan question for you how would i
25:49 - make a disc spin like a record deck
25:51 - using mouse down and drag to spin the
25:54 - disc reverse okay this is interesting so
25:57 - if i understand the question correctly
26:04 - we're asking if we had some type of
26:07 - thing on the screen that looked like a
26:08 - record
26:09 - how would you make it spin and then how
26:11 - could you control
26:13 - the spin by like moving turning it like
26:16 - kind of like i guess like scratching
26:17 - like a dj would like this
26:20 - or something like that right
26:22 - um okay so let's think about this for a
26:24 - moment
26:26 - um
26:27 - yeah see it really i feel like what this
26:30 - show office hours broadcast needs is uh
26:33 - people's live voices right right right
26:36 - so people people they what we need to do
26:38 - is have them enter into the
26:40 - into somewhere and then we can invite
26:43 - them to the hangout right or just not
26:45 - use a hangout but yeah
26:48 - like you need to enter their names into
26:50 - a field or something but anyway okay
26:52 - yeah
26:52 - all right but let me i guess i'm going
26:54 - to talk about this spinning thing so one
26:56 - thing that you need actually is you need
26:58 - to know something about there's two
27:00 - things that you really need to
27:00 - understand to make this work
27:02 - one is you need to know something about
27:04 - transformations so the first thing that
27:06 - you need to do is use translate
27:10 - because you're going to translate to a
27:11 - certain x y
27:12 - which is where you want the center of
27:14 - this spinning disk to be so if this is
27:17 - your processing window and this is the
27:19 - point 100 100 you could translate to 100
27:22 - 100 and then draw
27:25 - that disc however you're going to draw a
27:27 - circle a polygon an image you're going
27:29 - to draw it at 0 0
27:31 - with some
27:32 - width and height right because what
27:34 - translate does is it moves the origin
27:36 - translates the origin which always by
27:37 - default starts from the top left to a
27:40 - certain location on the screen in this
27:42 - case 100 100 and you can draw that
27:44 - ellipse the reason why you need to do
27:46 - that
27:47 - because to have this record spin
27:49 - you're going to want to use the rotate
27:51 - method
27:53 - the rotate method
27:56 - will rotate
27:57 - uh the transfer the the the view the
28:00 - sort of transformation space the what
28:02 - you're the drawing context will rotate
28:04 - it around the point of origin so if you
28:06 - want the disk to spin around in the
28:07 - center you move the origin to where you
28:09 - want to draw the disk rotate by some
28:11 - amount and draw that disk at zero zero
28:14 - so this is really
28:15 - the first piece of information that you
28:17 - need to implement this
28:19 - the second piece of information that you
28:21 - really need to understand is this idea
28:23 - of angular
28:26 - velocity
28:28 - and also i would say angular
28:30 - acceleration
28:33 - right because what's going to go here
28:35 - you're going to rotate by some angle why
28:37 - is that angle going to change over time
28:39 - maybe it's spinning at a constant rate
28:41 - it's spinning at some speed or velocity
28:43 - maybe it's speeding up as you flick it
28:45 - it's accelerating maybe it's slowing
28:47 - down it's decelerating so you need to
28:48 - figure out these concepts and actually
28:50 - it's lucky for anybody who might
28:53 - be oh 10 no 10 somebody just that's very
28:55 - sad i looked over here and it said 10
28:57 - viewers and immediately said nine
28:58 - viewers
29:00 - very sad um if this comes back on oops
29:03 - here i am over here um
29:05 - if i go to i believe rather than try to
29:07 - make an example from scratch right now
29:09 - oh the camera shut off
29:13 - the hijinx
29:14 - by the way there's so much stuff in this
29:16 - room like i can't walk anywhere
29:18 - um
29:19 - the um
29:21 - i believe
29:22 - if i go to
29:24 - um
29:25 - in in processing examples
29:29 - under books
29:30 - nature of code chapter three
29:34 - i'm gonna look in here
29:36 - i'm gonna find
29:38 - a uh angular motion
29:42 - example
29:44 - and
29:46 - uh
29:49 - i'm gonna fix a few things up i thought
29:51 - i updated these i'm gonna fix a few
29:53 - things up about this example and run it
29:56 - so you can see that's really what's
29:57 - going on here we have this line in these
30:00 - two circles and it's spinning and look
30:02 - how it's getting you know maybe faster
30:04 - and faster over time
30:06 - that's because there is
30:09 - an angle that is being that you're
30:11 - rotating by some value
30:14 - that angle is being changed by some
30:16 - angular velocity
30:18 - um and so for example if i take out this
30:20 - idea of acceleration
30:22 - and i just give it a constant angular
30:24 - velocity and i run it you can see hey
30:27 - it's spinning at
30:28 - an angular velocity of 0.2
30:30 - 0.05
30:32 - it looks like this
30:34 - but this idea of acceleration is pretty
30:36 - interesting because one thing i can do
30:39 - is i can again mat i can create a
30:42 - dynamic acceleration where i just map
30:44 - the mouse's value which goes between
30:47 - zero and width to something between like
30:49 - 0.1 and
30:51 - 0.1
30:53 - if we run this
30:56 - math mousex what's wrong with this line
30:59 - of code
31:02 - oh it's angular acceleration
31:05 - if i run this
31:07 - okay that's way too big values
31:10 - spinning out of control
31:13 - so you can see now i can kind of slow it
31:16 - down it's very hard for you to see
31:17 - probably they're going to make this even
31:18 - smaller
31:24 - you can see that now depending on where
31:25 - i move the mouse i can kind of like
31:27 - decelerate it and have it starting to
31:29 - accelerate back in the other direction
31:31 - slow it back down so i can now sort of
31:33 - get gain control over how fast it's
31:36 - spinning in what direction i have this
31:38 - angle which is the actual rotation at
31:40 - that moment i have the angular velocity
31:42 - which is how fast is it spinning at that
31:44 - moment and acceleration which is
31:47 - what the change in its velocity is it
31:49 - speeding up is it slowing down and i'm
31:51 - just controlling that and your velocity
31:52 - arbitrarily through the mouse here in
31:54 - this particular example
31:58 - so that's the spinning disc question
32:01 - nice hey do you want me to relay the
32:03 - question from joshua davis yes he said
32:06 - he's using he's using the kinect
32:09 - okay and he's noticed that um
32:12 - the left hand
32:13 - and he's got
32:14 - two transparent pngs i guess mapped to
32:17 - his hands
32:18 - and the left the left hand the
32:21 - transparent area the png knocks out any
32:24 - info on the background
32:26 - whereas the right hand
32:29 - the png transparency is fine
32:33 - so one of them is knocking out part of
32:35 - the background and the other one is not
32:38 - oh i see so there there's one image
32:42 - and transparency is working
32:45 - and there's another image
32:47 - and transparency is not working
32:50 - something like that
32:53 - uh my guess is
32:59 - to try adding let me go uh
33:03 - this is where we need to call andres
33:04 - calubri
33:05 - it's probably in p3d
33:07 - i would assume obviously a lot of this
33:09 - depends on
33:10 - but it tries to do with like z depth
33:12 - sorting um in terms of the order of
33:14 - stuff that's being drawn and if i go to
33:18 - um
33:18 - [Music]
33:20 - dynamic
33:21 - i think this one
33:23 - yeah
33:24 - uh try adding
33:27 - um try adding this line of code see if
33:29 - that fixes it
33:31 - um
33:32 - what this says is
33:34 - if we read the comments from this
33:35 - processing example
33:37 - is it says
33:38 - writing to the depth
33:40 - buffer that is disabled to avoid
33:41 - rendering artifacts due to the fact that
33:43 - the particles are semi-transparent but
33:45 - not z-sorted so i'm pretty sure that
33:48 - this will help uh
33:50 - i think that this um hint will kind of
33:52 - like fix the rendering if you're not
33:54 - drawing the the stuff that you're
33:56 - drawing in proper z-sorted magic way
34:00 - so i i don't know if
34:03 - if you're probably watching the stream
34:04 - and this you're going to like see this
34:07 - moments after i say it
34:09 - and then try it and then you could type
34:11 - another message in to see if it works
34:13 - i'm going to try going to the chat again
34:16 - just uh with a new window
34:23 - yeah sean when you look at the chat how
34:25 - many people do you see in the chat um
34:32 - uh eight
34:36 - and it's channel slash processing
34:39 - oh you know what you know chef
34:42 - shep redirected me to channel itp
34:45 - so
34:47 - but i don't see anybody in there either
34:50 - oh i see you now in itp
34:55 - yes stay stay there you'll see
35:01 - joshua davis says
35:06 - he posted some images so you can see
35:11 - oh i see the chat now i think
35:14 - that's his image
35:17 - and he says see how it goes the actual
35:19 - transparent area
35:21 - but i want z depth
35:24 - i don't know what that
35:27 - this is too advanced for me i can't
35:28 - handle it
35:31 - what is the oh z depth from uh connect i
35:34 - guess
35:37 - okay now i see the chat again
35:42 - this is very confusing to me
35:44 - um
35:46 - how long have we been doing this by the
35:48 - way let's see oh there are 13 viewers
35:50 - our viewership is going through the roof
35:53 - you could do a filibuster this way just
35:55 - keep going yeah um okay so we had some
35:59 - nice questions let me check twitter
36:01 - i always feel ridiculous whenever i say
36:03 - that
36:05 - cheers oh thanks
36:07 - oh good so hopefully um i don't know if
36:10 - it's noelle or nol but hopefully i
36:11 - answered that question in a way that was
36:13 - helpful
36:14 - uh
36:16 - does anyone want to join the uh if
36:18 - anyone wants to join the hangout
36:20 - you can type you i guess you could type
36:21 - your gmail address into the chat and
36:24 - sean can invite you in and then you can
36:26 - actually talk and speak
36:27 - otherwise you could go back to some of
36:29 - my juggling tricks they're not very good
36:31 - though it's very hot in here
36:35 - i don't have any water i can't get to
36:37 - the doors
36:40 - i'd bring you things but i can't open
36:41 - the doors um
36:43 - all right so uh wait there were other
36:45 - questions hold on there were questions
36:48 - in the um
36:53 - there were questions in the gist
36:58 - too many okay
37:00 - uh um
37:02 - how to embed a sketch on a web page was
37:05 - an interesting question that came up i
37:07 - really just realized like oh my god i
37:09 - can't believe i'm about to go down this
37:10 - road but um
37:13 - hold on let me find
37:15 - i'm just going to show you
37:21 - yes okay perfect so um i wanted to um
37:24 - since that question was asked you know
37:26 - the world of processing.js is a complex
37:29 - and interesting place but i'm going to
37:31 - show you a url um
37:39 - which i highly encourage you to take a
37:41 - look at if you're interested in this
37:42 - topic
37:43 - if i lost my internet connection
37:45 - know that i'm about to run out of power
37:47 - over here
37:48 - [Music]
37:56 - so um aaron sherwood who is a
37:58 - second-year itp student worked last year
38:01 - last year to create a really nice
38:03 - tutorial that showed you the basics of
38:05 - okay you have um
38:08 - standing in front of it i should make it
38:10 - a little bigger actually yeah we can't
38:12 - read the url yeah okay so the url is
38:17 - there we go
38:19 - there's the urls aaron sherwood aaron
38:21 - sherwood dot com slash processing.js
38:24 - and i i don't know i guess um you know
38:26 - i'm more just pointing out this tutorial
38:28 - exists to the world hello world this
38:30 - tutorial exists i think it's great if
38:32 - you're interested in kind of figuring
38:35 - out what it means to you've got some
38:36 - basic processing code you want to embed
38:38 - it on a web page here's some of the
38:41 - stuff you need to stick in your html
38:43 - file
38:44 - here's what that all looks like here's
38:46 - what the sketch looks like running in
38:47 - the browser but aaron goes on to show
38:49 - you um
38:52 - quite a bit more which is actually how
38:53 - you can start to have a sketch interact
38:56 - with a web page so these are actual dom
38:58 - elements that i'm clicking on
39:01 - and that are actually changing what's
39:02 - happening in the sketch so you can
39:04 - communicate between the um
39:07 - the processing by standing the right
39:09 - place you can communicate between the
39:10 - processing sketch itself and dom
39:12 - elements as well as i think even maybe
39:14 - in the bottom of this tutorial goes on
39:16 - about how you can use um html5 audio in
39:19 - combination with processing.js so if
39:20 - you're interested in kind of advanced
39:23 - level you know we have processing which
39:25 - is java you know it's a desktop
39:27 - application you're writing code it's
39:29 - compiling it's executing your desktop
39:31 - processing.js for the core processing
39:34 - api will allow you to run that core
39:36 - drawing stuff in a browser canvas
39:38 - anything else you want to do
39:40 - you know beyond what the core drawing
39:41 - api does you've got to dig into
39:44 - html css
39:45 - et cetera javascript et cetera yourself
39:47 - but
39:48 - there's lots of things that are possible
39:50 - and aaron's tutorial is a nice helpful
39:52 - um place to
39:54 - to start i think what might be useful is
39:56 - if i have an actual like agenda i should
39:59 - get a teleprompter script
40:04 - so does that does uh that processing js
40:07 - tutorial that's only for javascript uh
40:11 - what about embedding of a
40:13 - javascript
40:15 - applet
40:16 - well that you know i
40:19 - you can do that if it's
40:21 - i i don't know that i would recommend
40:22 - doing that anymore sort of java applets
40:24 - are not well supported across operating
40:27 - systems and browsers but you can
40:29 - um
40:30 - there's a tool that you can get um
40:32 - there's a little known fact about
40:33 - processing
40:34 - is that uh and this is gonna be hard for
40:36 - you to see but up here in the same way
40:38 - that peop a lot of you might be familiar
40:40 - with the fact that you can add libraries
40:42 - so there's core live there's built-in
40:44 - libraries there's libraries you can in
40:46 - with the contribution manager you can go
40:48 - to ad library and see this
40:51 - really nice list
40:52 - of all these libraries that are out
40:54 - available that you can just install
40:55 - right through the ide itself the same is
40:58 - true of tools
41:01 - i can go to add tool
41:06 - and i don't maybe you can't see what i'm

41:20 - embedded into a web browser
41:25 - uh okay
41:26 - i think
41:28 - you know we this is almost an hour
41:31 - i feel that this was on a scale on a i
41:34 - would rate this show uh
41:36 - from one to ten would give it a 2.3
41:39 - no
41:40 - i think it was actually pretty good yeah
41:42 - maybe it gets like a four or five but so
41:45 - um any case if you're still listening or
41:48 - if you're interested in this kind of
41:49 - experiment
