06:15 - help me i'm trapped i've got
06:18 - a green screen behind me it's terrifying
06:21 - in here
06:22 - i'm i'm covered in random numbers
06:27 - and i don't know what to code whatever
06:30 - shall i
06:32 - do
06:34 - it's spooky up here spooky
06:38 - spooky that's an attic look
06:41 - it's an attic where i am trapped and i
06:43 - have lights
06:44 - and scream and
06:55 - [Music]

07:05 - what shall i do
07:06 - i don't know
07:07 - [Music]
07:12 - i didn't plan this very well i need a
07:15 - script
07:17 - okay hello
07:21 - it is me count random number
07:26 - appearing live on the coding train
07:30 - [Music]
07:32 - there was a train whistle that i usually
07:35 - have ah
07:36 - i have found it i will blow it
07:44 - i will now read the random numbers to
07:48 - you
07:49 - thirty-two thousand and fifteen sixty
07:53 - thousand
07:53 - five hundred and seventy-seven oh uh uh
08:01 - 85 846

08:30 - 78 300
08:34 - and 91.
08:42 - i must go i must go and collect the rest
08:45 - of the random numbers
08:48 - [Music]
08:51 - they're all falling off my costume
08:55 - which makes it easier to read
08:59 - 30 479
09:09 - man fan asks is this live no this is not
09:12 - live i recorded this
09:14 - and then watched it back and decided to
09:15 - broadcast it no it's definitely live
09:18 - because if it wasn't live i'd have
09:19 - canceled this idea a very long time ago
09:23 - good morning everyone i think maybe i
09:25 - can
09:26 - um move on from my schtick here
09:29 - which really i want to thank violet by
09:31 - the way who had the idea for the random
09:33 - number
09:33 - costume this was thrown together by the
09:35 - way in the last 15 minutes i asked all
09:37 - of my children
09:39 - all of my children all two of them two
09:41 - and one was very busy playing a a
09:43 - baseball in roblox so i got the of just
09:45 - a few random numbers
09:47 - but um to make a lot of random numbers
09:51 - on pieces of paper and stick them all
09:52 - over me i found this old
09:54 - vampire robe or dracula robe that my son
09:57 - had used as a costume from years ago
10:00 - and so here we are um
10:05 - on a saturday
10:07 - [Music]

10:34 - should put my early vote sticker on me
10:36 - but please vote um i encourage you to
10:38 - vote
10:39 - um early voting was a wonderful
10:42 - experience to feel like i had the time

10:45 - everything
10:46 - uh it was a thank you to the new york
10:48 - city
10:49 - voting organization i forget what it's
10:51 - called new york city votes it was
10:53 - actually a very smooth experience i was
10:54 - offered empanadas and pizza while i was
10:56 - waiting in line and only had to wait
10:57 - about 30 to 45 minutes
10:59 - okay um now
11:02 - uh dr paroul jane is telling me to
11:05 - please
11:05 - start i haven't uh just just in case
11:09 - anybody's wondering
11:10 - these saturday live streams they tend to
11:13 - be a little um
11:14 - long-winded if you will and i get much
11:18 - less done
11:19 - than i might in a sort of shorter form
11:21 - actual coding tutorial
11:23 - so if you're looking for a so-called
11:25 - proper educational experience you know
11:28 - you can come back later one thing that i
11:29 - do and thank you to marcos
11:31 - um who's been helping me with this is
11:33 - the um youtube has a feature now if i
11:35 - put time codes in the description it
11:37 - will chapterize if that's a word
11:39 - uh chapterize the video and so you can
11:41 - come back and watch it later and
11:42 - find the sections that actually have
11:44 - some coding stuff because that's what
11:45 - you're
11:45 - more interested in um alright
11:49 - so what is the game called road blocks
11:52 - did i say roadblocks roblox excuse me
11:56 - um all right so
11:59 - um what
12:04 - am i going to
12:09 - do today
12:13 - i have an idea and one of the things i'm
12:16 - super excited about and you saw it here
12:18 - and let me try to get this back um
12:21 - thanks to the stream professor i don't
12:23 - know if any of you watch the stream
12:24 - professor's youtube channel
12:26 - actually forgot what the actual name of
12:27 - it is i watch it all the time
12:29 - um that there is uh i learned about how
12:32 - and i'm gonna just switch over to here
12:34 - um i can use my phone i should probably
12:37 - just
12:38 - like have both of these going let's see
12:39 - hold if you'll if you'll bear with me
12:40 - for a moment
12:42 - if i go back to here or maybe if i go to
12:45 - here
12:46 - um no no here
12:50 - no oh let me just add it real quick
12:53 - oh it's fine i'll just go back to here
12:55 - so i have a thing where i can
12:57 - uh connect my phone this i can't show it
12:59 - to you i want to turn my other camera on
13:01 - alright i have an idea just bear with me
13:03 - for a second
13:04 - um we're gonna go
13:08 - back to i'm gonna uh this is me
13:10 - producing the show during the show
13:11 - that's a thing that i also do
13:14 - quite often i'm gonna go back to this
13:15 - view i'm gonna go into my open broadcast
13:18 - studio i'm gonna add another capture
13:20 - device i'm going to add
13:21 - the epoch cam
13:24 - oh my god i'm going to shrink it
13:28 - and then i'm going to rotate it
13:30 - transform
13:32 - rotate 90 degrees clockwise and there we
13:34 - go
13:35 - so now i should be able to show you that
13:37 - what i am doing is i have my
13:39 - fancy ios device here which is there's
13:42 - no cables
13:44 - it is wirelessly connected to the pc
13:46 - running my streaming computer
13:48 - that's amazing um and so i can do things
13:51 - like
13:52 - uh my random numbers are falling off
13:56 - and you're seeing also the mess like
13:59 - this is the messiest room in our
14:01 - house i don't know if you can call it a
14:02 - room it's an attic um
14:04 - i don't i really want to like try not to
14:06 - show too much it's like
14:07 - barbie dolls all over the floor and like
14:09 - giant bins of legos and all sorts of
14:12 - stuff
14:13 - uh just arts and crafts supplies
14:15 - everywhere
14:16 - um let me switch for a second ah
14:19 - so i have uh this uh book here
14:22 - and if i do this and switch here
14:25 - i should be now showing you um this
14:28 - pumpkin
14:29 - carving kit so this was uh the activity
14:32 - that's planned in my household for this
14:34 - afternoon
14:34 - and i noticed that um over in the book
14:40 - it has these designs for uh
14:44 - carving a pumpkin and uh my
14:47 - daughter in particular really wants to
14:49 - do this one
14:50 - the side-eyed owl um and you can see how
14:52 - it works you
14:53 - tape over the pattern you carve and then
14:55 - you display and i was thinking
14:58 - couldn't we and maybe i should turn this
15:01 - off now
15:02 - uh um
15:06 - what if i were to make
15:08 - [Music]
15:11 - what if i were to make an algorithmic
15:16 - generative pumpkin clothing
15:21 - design
15:25 - uh that's what i was thinking of doing
15:27 - uh
15:31 - uh yeah and cake uh castian vekman
15:35 - is pointing out that i only i said i
15:37 - only had to wait 30 to 45 minutes um
15:40 - in denmark uh that is a very very long
15:44 - time
15:44 - from what i've been told um i've checked
15:46 - the line a few times i live in brooklyn
15:49 - um i heard that paul rudd by the way was
15:51 - handing out cookies to people online in
15:53 - brooklyn but i think that was at the
15:54 - barclays center which is not my
15:56 - location um i heard people waiting for
15:58 - hours so
16:00 - [Music]
16:02 - okay so what's happening here so i
16:04 - wanted to do some halloween
16:05 - themed fun things uh mostly because i
16:08 - have no idea what else to do
16:10 - but first let me offer up some coding
16:13 - train news
16:24 - so um i have this youtube channel it's
16:26 - called the coding train
16:28 - i'm gonna go to it right now uh if you
16:30 - didn't see
16:31 - um already this uh video that i released
16:34 - yesterday it's coding challenge number
16:35 - 157
16:37 - uh oh you don't see this at all
16:39 - apologies oh and my
16:40 - what is going on here the cam the epocam
16:44 - is on this screen
16:45 - all right um this here was the uh
16:48 - video that i released um
16:52 - uh two days ago um called zoom
16:55 - annotations
16:56 - with machine learning and p5.js so
17:00 - um i don't know how easy it is for
17:02 - somebody to follow it
17:03 - i guess i just have to give up i have
17:06 - more tape here let's
17:07 - let's take some extreme measures
17:10 - because i know everybody is just gifting
17:13 - and snapshotting this
17:15 - live stream and sharing it all over
17:16 - social media and i really want
17:19 - um a uh i really want
17:23 - um this random number to appear wait i'm
17:26 - being told
17:27 - i got a direct message that i now don't
17:29 - see it popped up for a second so if you
17:31 - have something to tell me about the
17:32 - stream ah there it is
17:33 - stream deck volume is low i have no idea
17:35 - what that means
17:36 - do you mean my mic my mic is low like
17:39 - i'm quiet
17:41 - because i don't know what stream deck is
17:44 - i don't use stream deck whatever that
17:46 - is i have lots of different audio feeds
17:48 - i have music
17:49 - i have my mic uh
17:54 - here this isn't going anywhere now this
17:56 - is great
17:57 - okay what was i talking about ah i was
17:59 - wondering if this is actually something
18:01 - that people could follow and really
18:02 - implement
18:03 - or is it just like a cool demo that i
18:05 - did in a video and people aren't really
18:06 - gonna be able to do stuff with it
18:08 - so um if you
18:12 - if you um your
18:15 - sounds all of my sounds i need more
18:18 - specificity in my life
18:20 - it's that's much too general i can't do
18:22 - anything with that
18:24 - everything is good people are telling me
18:25 - i'm i'm gonna assume uh all of my audio
18:27 - levels are actually like my mic is in
18:29 - the red it's showing me which is not
18:30 - good when i speak
18:31 - very loud and the laptop sounds
18:35 - um are at a sort of medium volume
18:39 - which i guess i could turn up a little
18:40 - bit um
18:42 - yeah so the music the sound effects were
18:45 - very low
18:45 - got it the music was so quiet all that
18:48 - time but it was so
18:49 - good all of my uh halloween music that i
18:52 - spent so long curating
18:53 - uh this morning okay so
18:57 - this particular zoom annotations video
18:59 - if you
19:00 - happen to make something a version of it
19:03 - if you will
19:05 - i would love for you to share it with me
19:08 - i don't know if this is a thing that
19:09 - people could really actually
19:10 - do and i think actually one of the
19:12 - things that i wanted to emphasize with
19:13 - this video which i'm not sure that i did
19:15 - a particularly great job of
19:17 - is that um and i should check the page
19:19 - let's check the page i don't know why i
19:21 - went to the channel when i should be
19:22 - going to the website um whoops that's
19:24 - also the channel again let me go to the
19:26 - website and go to the challenge here
19:28 - this is ah it looks like
19:33 - it seems like there haven't been made
19:38 - any variations based on this coding
19:41 - challenge by the community yet be the
19:44 - first
19:45 - and add your own
19:49 - if you don't know how take a look
19:53 - at this spooky guide oh we should make a
19:56 - chrome extension
19:57 - that just inserts the word spooky into
20:00 - websites everywhere
20:02 - that's what i should make today on the
20:04 - coding train
20:05 - um so uh
20:08 - nobody's you could be the first you
20:10 - could be the first person this is a
20:11 - little tricky because i'm not actually
20:13 - asking you to share your code
20:14 - necessarily what i would love for you to
20:16 - do is create
20:18 - maybe a gif or a short video that just
20:20 - screen records
20:22 - you in a zoom meeting again don't record
20:24 - other people in a zoom meeting unless
20:26 - you have their permission
20:27 - um so just do a test meeting with just
20:29 - yourself or just
20:31 - cut out the part that you're in it and
20:33 - show how you're interacting with people
20:35 - in your zoom meeting through this
20:37 - methodology
20:38 - that's in the video but what i wanted to
20:39 - mention is even though the demonstration
20:41 - is all about
20:42 - overlays to your actual video
20:47 - what i'm really showing you is that
20:49 - anything you can make on your computer
20:52 - um that you can uh and any layout that
20:55 - you can create in open broadcast studio
20:57 - you can um you can pipe that into your
21:02 - zoom call so it doesn't actually have to
21:03 - be traditional
21:04 - video it could just be like like text
21:07 - like i
21:08 - actually was in a zoom meeting the other
21:09 - day that had the community agreement
21:11 - um which was just a a document
21:15 - that was sort of laid out on one page as
21:17 - the video feed of one of the um
21:19 - participants in the meeting so but
21:21 - something more creative and abstract you
21:23 - could do
21:25 - crabby asks oh wait is it halloween
21:28 - right now
21:30 - in case you were wondering it is indeed
21:33 - and by the way i saw i
21:34 - i have um an account with one of these
21:36 - like uh royalty-free
21:38 - um audio services um
21:41 - where i get music and stuff from i just
21:44 - downloaded epidemic by the way um and i
21:47 - just download i should also mention by
21:49 - the way i sort of i'm a little late in
21:50 - doing this right now
21:52 - but this uh this uh live stream is
21:55 - sponsored by brilliant
21:58 - brilliant um i will in a little while go
22:00 - and do one of the daily challenges from
22:02 - brilliant if you're not familiar with
22:03 - brilliant go to brilliant.org
22:05 - codingtrain and sign up for free and if
22:07 - you're interested in math and science
22:09 - and learning and
22:09 - interactive exercises and computer
22:11 - programming there's tons of puzzles and
22:13 - courses
22:14 - and things there it's all interactive so
22:16 - unlike video tutorials which is what i
22:18 - do on youtube
22:19 - it's really a place that you can do on
22:20 - your own time through reading and
22:22 - interactivity i
22:23 - really love the site so you can sign up
22:26 - for free
22:26 - you can get a premium subscription to
22:28 - unlock everything and through that link
22:30 - you uh the first 200 people get a 20
22:32 - off coupon all right so back to
22:35 - uh regularly scheduled programming which
22:37 - is me
22:38 - uh ah and power he likes everybody's
22:40 - asking me about the wallpaper
22:43 - so um i do make these available
22:46 - let's uh let's go i i forget
22:50 - where this is like the actual place this
22:52 - is
22:53 - um but i'm gonna go to the github repo
22:55 - for the website i don't know why i'm not
22:57 - signed in here
22:58 - and i'm gonna search i'm so lost
23:01 - on github so i'm search under issues
23:04 - this is so weird that why am i not
23:08 - signed in i want to be signed in because
23:09 - my search bar is gone
23:11 - wall paper let's hold on let's just see
23:14 - wallpaper coding train
23:18 - there we go so in this particular issue
23:21 - and i believe this might have got
23:22 - resolved further along then oh yeah
23:25 - there's an faq on the site somewhere oh
23:27 - you don't even see what i'm showing you
23:29 - i'm the worst
23:30 - uh on this faq uh
23:33 - site uh i don't know where that is okay
23:36 - there's this link here on this page
23:37 - issue number 404
23:38 - which goes to this google drive folder
23:41 - and under here under
23:42 - wallpaper um the halloween one is
23:46 - right here catch a ride halloween i also
23:49 - would encourage you to check out this
23:50 - very new
23:51 - catch a mask and i like this one that uh
23:56 - that was jason put together to put masks
23:58 - on the characters
24:00 - and yeah so you can grab those um i
24:03 - think that i have some information
24:04 - somewhere oh license what does this say
24:08 - uh the coding drain characters were
24:10 - created by
24:11 - uh jason heglund and they're available
24:13 - for use under a creative commons
24:15 - attribution
24:16 - non-commercial share alike 4.0
24:18 - international license
24:19 - so certainly um if you're just using it
24:21 - for your own personal use
24:22 - uh that is great if you are using them
24:25 - and
24:26 - in something that you are publishing um
24:28 - then you should probably
24:30 - provide attribution and make sure you're
24:31 - not like selling them on t-shirts and
24:33 - that kind of thing whatever's in that
24:34 - license
24:35 - just to mention okay and i don't know
24:38 - how to do this stuff the correct way i'm
24:40 - trying to wave my way through
24:42 - having a very open working process um
24:45 - but also
24:46 - keeping things protected and ethical and
24:49 - so
24:49 - i'm definitely your feedback is well
24:51 - appreciated for how i can
24:53 - make the code and the content of the
24:55 - coding train more
24:56 - accessible for you in ways um that works
25:00 - does brilliant have the new design today
25:02 - so i know i was told by brilliant that
25:04 - their website is being redesigned
25:05 - for november and it's in the materials
25:07 - that i'm that i'm telling you about
25:09 - but maybe the site has the new design
25:11 - today because it is october 31st all
25:12 - right
25:14 - where was i i think we need to start off
25:19 - especially since today i am your
25:22 - friendly
25:23 - count random number
25:29 - count random number
25:32 - we should do some random number reading
25:35 - so how do i get to the random number
25:37 - reading the first thing that i do
25:39 - it's already 10.25 time flies when
25:42 - you're wasting time
25:43 - live streaming to an international
25:46 - audience of
25:48 - hundreds i suppose is the correct term
25:51 - by the way i'm told there is another
25:53 - live stream somebody could
25:54 - there's like a math or math magic live
25:56 - stream going on today that's 24 hours
25:58 - that's probably what you should be
26:00 - watching right now if somebody could
26:02 - uh just post a link to that in the chat
26:05 - send people away to there
26:07 - it's gonna be a much more productive use
26:08 - of your time i almost certain all right
26:10 - i'm
26:11 - trying to do something very important um
26:14 - which
26:14 - is uh no
26:17 - uh get to the coding train discord
26:20 - get to the lynx channel uh
26:24 - and in a moment i'm gonna show you ah i
26:26 - cannot you operate a computer it's very
26:29 - did it's so scary
26:39 - there we go
26:41 - [Music]
26:45 - okay so
26:49 - what this is really bothering me this
26:51 - epoch cam thing let me just click that
26:53 - all right
26:54 - um so this is the coding train discord
26:57 - in
26:57 - other breaking news i won't play the
27:00 - sound effect again
27:02 - three intro to discord bot tutorials are
27:05 - coming to you on the coding train
27:07 - uh next week they are basically almost
27:11 - finished
27:11 - i also recorded a new tutorial on
27:14 - using a convolutional neural network in
27:17 - ml5.js that is coming to you soon
27:19 - so four videos are on the way tutorial
27:21 - videos coming your way
27:23 - but i encourage you to join the coding
27:25 - train discord
27:26 - v new very new is if you uh i just
27:29 - posted the invite into the chat
27:31 - but brand new is thecodingtrain.com
27:38 - discord so if you go to
27:40 - thecodingtrain.com
27:42 - discord that will take you automatically
27:44 - uh redirect you to the invite page
27:47 - so i encourage you to just find it that
27:48 - way i should update my link
27:50 - um and can somebody post the link to the
27:52 - somebody who's in
27:53 - has admin privileges can you post a link
27:57 - to the wallpapers in the youtube chat
28:00 - but again you'll find it if you go to uh
28:03 - the couldn't train website github repo
28:05 - issue number four four seven
28:07 - you gotta do it's coming you gotta gotta
28:08 - work a little bit here you don't just
28:10 - get the link you gotta go on a
28:11 - adventure a spooky
28:16 - a spooky adventure navigate your way
28:21 - to issue number four
28:26 - okay um and
28:30 - um uh i'm looking at the chat too much
28:32 - going on
28:33 - um all right so speaking of the reason
28:35 - why i came over here to the discord
28:37 - is this is where i am i am all
28:41 - i am i have a very important project
28:43 - that i'm doing
28:45 - which is i am attempting to read this
28:47 - entire book
28:49 - a million random digits um
28:52 - and it is by the rand corporation also
28:55 - included as a bonus a hundred thousand
28:57 - normal deviants
28:58 - and as of last live stream i was on
29:01 - row 10. i'm not still on the first page
29:03 - this is going to take
29:05 - this is going to take i don't know i
29:06 - gotta uh it's going to take a long time
29:09 - i don't think that i will finish it in
29:10 - my lifetime if i'm being honest i mean
29:12 - how much longer am i really going to be
29:13 - doing this
29:14 - live streaming nonsense i don't know
29:17 - this might be my last one everybody it's
29:19 - over after this
29:21 - there's a link in the faq violent
29:22 - where's the faq i don't know where even
29:24 - where the fhq
29:25 - is i know we worked on it and anyway i'm
29:27 - going to page one
29:30 - i'm going to page one of a million
29:32 - random digits i'm going to row 10
29:35 - and the next random number i remember
29:37 - this now the next random number
29:39 - is uh column
29:42 - two and so i can actually show this to
29:46 - you
29:47 - if i bring up my epoch cam again
29:50 - let's see if i can make this work um
29:55 - it's going to take a minute to connect
30:00 - all right here we go so i am on row 10
30:06 - column zero one two so this is the first
30:10 - random number that i need to read let's
30:11 - try actually
30:14 - um no as i say so this is it fourteen
30:17 - thousand nine hundred five
30:18 - that's where i need to read i'm gonna go
30:20 - back to this view here
30:22 - and count random number we'll now
30:25 - read from the book a million random
30:28 - digits
30:30 - what's the best way what's the best look
30:32 - here for me
30:33 - is it this so you could see the cover uh
30:36 - and then i need some
30:37 - uh music here
30:40 - [Music]
30:42 - fourteen thousand nine hundred and five
30:46 - ha ha ha ha
30:49 - no i don't like this one
30:53 - that's pretty good
30:54 - [Music]
30:58 - let's go with this one
30:59 - [Music]
31:03 - sixty eight thousand six hundred and
31:06 - seven
31:08 - twenty two thousand one hundred and nine
31:13 - forty thousand five hundred and fifty
31:16 - eight
31:19 - 60 970
31:24 - 93 4433
31:35 - [Music]
31:44 - 481
31:46 - i went to the wrong row again no 11805
31:50 - 5431 39808
31:53 - 27
31:54 - [Music]
31:58 - 732 fifty thousand
32:01 - seven hundred and twenty-five
32:04 - sixty-eight thousand two hundred and
32:06 - fifty-eight
32:07 - [Music]
32:10 - twenty-nine thousand four hundred and
32:12 - five
32:18 - [Music]
32:24 - 851
32:26 - [Music]
32:27 - three thousand four hundred and fifty
32:30 - two
32:33 - ninety nine thousand six hundred and
32:35 - thirty four
32:37 - six thousand two hundred and eighty feet
32:43 - [Music]
32:47 - [Applause]
32:47 - [Music]
32:54 - six
32:56 - okay so i have finished up on row
33:00 - 12 column zero one two three
33:03 - four five twelve and five twelve and
33:06 - five all right i will post the link to
33:07 - the wallpaper
33:09 - i see that people are really interested
33:11 - in that 12
33:13 - row 12 column 5 is that what i said
33:18 - row 12 no row 12 and column 5. so
33:21 - here we are next random number
33:26 - row 12 column five
33:30 - so that is there in discord and then let
33:32 - me grab that wallpaper link for folks
33:35 - so where is the faq first link under the
33:38 - more drop down so if we go to hear more
33:40 - under frequently asked questions ah okay
33:42 - look at this
33:43 - it's the coding train frequently asked
33:47 - [Music]
33:50 - questions
33:55 - all right i should know that that's
33:57 - there
33:58 - [Applause]
34:01 - okay look at all these answers to these
34:03 - commonly asked questions
34:05 - ah here we go where can i download the
34:07 - coding train wallpapers
34:09 - um and so the link right here shared
34:11 - google drive with and there's a lot more
34:13 - than just the wallpaper i don't think
34:14 - everything is here um because there's a
34:17 - lot of new stuff being generated all the
34:19 - time
34:20 - and i would like to highlight something
34:22 - for you that's super fun that i'm
34:23 - working on
34:24 - um let me just pull it up and that's why
34:25 - i'm moving my screen away for a second
34:27 - if i go into rewards
34:31 - and here um
34:35 - i'm going to open this image and bring
34:38 - it back to you now
34:40 - this is something i'm working on which
34:42 - is a laser etched
34:44 - uh coating train train whistle and this
34:47 - is one of the rewards for people who
34:48 - join as a member
34:50 - i know you can't see me um so i you know
34:53 - this has taken almost over
34:54 - it might be even more than a year now
34:56 - that i sort of like said that i would be
34:57 - sending these to people so
34:59 - apologies for that delay progress is
35:01 - being made
35:03 - and the thing that i'm looking to do is
35:05 - so it will have the coding train train
35:07 - on it and then if you're a member
35:08 - you get your own personalized random
35:10 - number i need a system for tracking
35:13 - those
35:13 - that's a definitely a project that i
35:15 - should build uh oh my numbers are
35:17 - falling all off of me
35:19 - um numbers um and
35:23 - um my idea
35:26 - is that on one of the other sides you
35:29 - would have your random number laser
35:31 - etched on it
35:32 - and then a design that probably a random
35:34 - walk is what i'm thinking right now
35:36 - where the seed for that that design was
35:39 - generated
35:40 - with your random number so you might
35:42 - have noticed
35:44 - i'm a little bit insane here in my
35:47 - obsession with
35:48 - randomness and random numbers but that
35:49 - to me now i feel like
35:51 - is the essence of the coding train
35:54 - itself
35:54 - sure there's the train theme there's
35:56 - p5gs there's
35:57 - me there's coding characters but
35:58 - ultimately the theme
36:01 - the real essence is
36:05 - random numbers where do they come from
36:10 - what comes next after one random number
36:13 - but
36:13 - everything i do is full of chaos and
36:16 - randomness with no plan
36:18 - random the random function is probably
36:19 - the most function that i use in my
36:21 - programming
36:22 - uh examples and tutorials it's
36:24 - everywhere and it's just
36:26 - like your starting point i think for
36:28 - this idea of creativity
36:30 - expression with code like there's so
36:32 - much more than you can do than
36:34 - randomness but it's kind of like
36:36 - this is where we all get started i
36:39 - learned how to make a shape i learned
36:40 - how to make a color
36:41 - let's try making a random one and so
36:44 - that to me
36:44 - i feel like it's all coming together it
36:46 - all makes sense to me now
36:48 - here on the coding train uh but let's i
36:51 - gotta work on something today because it
36:53 - is halloween and i want to make a
36:54 - halloween project so my idea was
36:57 - um a uh oh and frank in the chat is
37:01 - saying that they did their
37:03 - senior paper on random numbers in
37:05 - college i would love to read that
37:08 - uh i don't you know i'm curious
37:11 - join the discord and please share frank
37:13 - that sounds really awesome
37:15 - and i know that many of you are students
37:17 - right now i hope you're
37:18 - doing okay school wise um
37:22 - and that the coding train is helping you
37:24 - out in your educational journey
37:26 - if there are things that i can do to be
37:28 - more helpful
37:29 - please let me know all right
37:33 - so um just give me a second here
37:36 - to get back to
37:40 - something let's go to the p5 web editor
37:41 - i guess um
37:43 - and go i just want to open up the
37:45 - discord
37:47 - um and go back to
37:51 - where am i looking i want to go to the
37:53 - links channel there it is
37:56 - okay wow usually when i'm live streaming
37:59 - and i post something here it's just
38:01 - filled with emojis and yet somehow today
38:04 - i only got two thumbs up with all the
38:07 - emo
38:07 - and come on people
38:10 - i'm i'm i've got the power no not all
38:14 - you know let's be nice let's un remove
38:16 - all reactions reactions all add
38:19 - i have to remove them all or this what
38:22 - will this do
38:23 - yes see you ruined it for everybody else
38:27 - [Laughter]
38:29 - okay um now uh here we are in the web
38:33 - editor let's log
38:34 - in so once again my idea
38:37 - pumpkin carving designs so what can i
38:41 - add to what
38:42 - already by the way is this why is this
38:45 - being chroma keyed
38:46 - look at that it's like chroma keying out
38:50 - this book that is wacky um
38:54 - so um
39:02 - um let me see here sorry sorry sorry
39:04 - everybody so what can i
39:06 - add to the discourse
39:09 - on jack-o'-lantern designs
39:12 - um one idea that somebody had
39:16 - was um and krabby says there's lots of
39:20 - new reactions oh amazing beautiful
39:22 - krabby i love that thank you
39:23 - um i love your username by the way
39:26 - crabby
39:28 - where does it come from okay um one of
39:30 - the things that
39:32 - um i'm thinking about here is and a lot
39:36 - of people is
39:36 - what kind of designs
39:40 - that i've done either in um
39:44 - any of my coding challenges or
39:47 - in um any of the coding in the cabana
39:51 - videos
39:52 - could work for a jack-o-lantern design
39:56 - so on the one hand is the idea that like
39:59 - somebody out there
40:00 - like the nerdiest of the jack-o-lantern
40:02 - carvers
40:03 - just wants to put the hilbert curve so
40:05 - in the one sense like
40:07 - what am i adding here because it's just
40:09 - a matter of like
40:10 - um opening this sketch like making it
40:12 - black and white and screenshotting it
40:14 - and printing it
40:15 - that's basically all you need to do but
40:17 - is there something
40:18 - that i could possibly
40:22 - um um is there something that i could
40:26 - possibly
40:27 - do that's new um but also isn't just
40:30 - what you would sort of ordinarily do
40:32 - and allow people to customize it in some
40:34 - way so what's up
40:36 - so i need your help here and i'm looking
40:38 - at the youtube
40:39 - space filling pumpkin that's
40:42 - right space filling pumpkin that's
40:44 - hilbert curve as a space filling curve
40:46 - so i'm looking for ideas for things and
40:50 - while i'm getting started while you're
40:52 - thinking of those things and if folks
40:54 - in the uh discord chat
40:57 - the the members uh live chat if you
41:00 - could pull
41:00 - any ideas that you see in the youtube
41:02 - chat um
41:03 - and bring them into there let's let's
41:05 - accumulate them there and it's one of
41:07 - these days
41:08 - thank you to this stream chat i will i
41:10 - like to plug
41:11 - uh dis stream chat is this gonna like
41:14 - come up
41:14 - is it just just streamchat.com it is
41:18 - um which is uh the chat manager and
41:20 - discord bot
41:21 - uh for the coding train um it mostly
41:24 - works with twitch when i'm on youtube
41:26 - um but uh the reason i was gonna say
41:27 - this is that they're they're working on
41:29 - a new feature which will allow me to
41:30 - collect some comments
41:32 - and like feature them on the screen um
41:33 - but i don't have that ready yet but that
41:35 - would be that would be great for this
41:36 - but
41:36 - for now the butterfly wing generator
41:39 - that's a that's an interesting one how
41:40 - can we make that halloween
41:41 - themed it doesn't need to be i saw some
41:44 - pretty great um
41:45 - i mean here where i live in brooklyn
41:47 - everybody's got like super creative
41:50 - uh pumpkins i'm trying to think i saw it
41:51 - among us character
41:53 - um there was there was something that
41:55 - was i mean maybe just one with like
41:57 - random numbers on it
41:59 - dripping random numbers dripping blood
42:01 - oh that's kind of oh what if we did like
42:03 - a dripping blood
42:04 - effect on a random number so it'd be
42:07 - like spooky random numbers
42:13 - um how would i even do that um
42:16 - like i know that i could say something
42:19 - like
42:20 - [Music]
42:22 - you know let's pick what's the random
42:23 - number that's on my hat oh i really
42:24 - don't want to show my
42:25 - terrible hat here 30479
42:32 - uh 30479 and i could say
42:36 - put it in the middle
42:37 - [Music]
42:40 - and i could say a text align
42:44 - center and i haven't shared any
42:46 - community contributions which i should
42:47 - do today if i can
42:49 - fill let's make it just red right now
42:52 - and text size 64.
42:56 - what do i get oh that's not red that's
42:59 - green
43:01 - so i could do something where i think it
43:04 - could be twice the size
43:06 - where i take this number
43:09 - and i
43:13 - blobby pumpkins that's an interesting
43:15 - idea
43:17 - a spooky impossible maze oh that's a fun
43:20 - idea also
43:22 - uh i should i really should get that
43:24 - live poll thing going and then people
43:25 - could vote
43:26 - on the things but i haven't merged any
43:28 - of the recent pull requests and gone
43:29 - through it
43:30 - so i don't have enough time i probably
43:32 - need to be doing this full time frankly
43:34 - which i know it's not going to happen
43:35 - anytime soon i can live stream every day
43:37 - i get a lot of lots of done
43:39 - make it drip blood right so this is what
43:41 - i'm thinking um
43:44 - so you could get a random number in it
43:46 - uh
43:47 - it could i could do like a random walk
43:48 - design without random numbers that i
43:50 - could do what i'm saying basically
43:52 - what if we made a spooky random number
43:53 - design that does something generative
43:55 - that's seeded with that random number
43:57 - jumpscare maze uh
44:02 - and um yeah obviously i'm gonna at some
44:05 - point
44:05 - people are suggesting i'm gonna make
44:07 - this an actual random number but right
44:08 - now i'm just
44:10 - hardcoding in a number so what was i
44:12 - saying here
44:15 - text plotting dots with small pumpkins
44:20 - um very interesting so let's
44:23 - um spooky number is 404
44:26 - let's see if we can do some image
44:28 - processing to this because i think
44:29 - that'll be fun this is
44:32 - in some ways this might be more
44:33 - appropriate for processing um
44:36 - but i wanted to have this as a web
44:38 - application that people could run
44:40 - so i guess i'll because i i like doing
44:41 - the pixel processing stuff more
44:43 - processing but let's
44:44 - let's do what i'm thinking okay so i'm
44:46 - going to show you something if you're
44:47 - not aware
44:48 - okay let's give up hold on
44:51 - it's time for extreme measures here
45:04 - i really got to go at like a little
45:06 - afternoon today because there's a lot of
45:08 - exciting fun halloween stuff happening
45:10 - in my household um
45:18 - this is definitely how i should yeah
45:21 - right create the numbers from a bunch of
45:23 - particles so not applicable
45:25 - this is exactly what i'm thinking of
45:26 - thank you for this so this is what i'm
45:28 - going to
45:29 - we're going to try to make spooky random
45:30 - numbers and that's the thing you can
45:32 - carve into your pumpkin
45:34 - and i don't know if it's actually going
45:35 - to get carved into my kids have very
45:37 - specific ideas about what they want to
45:39 - carve
45:40 - so what i what i want to show you here
45:43 - is
45:43 - that um
45:46 - what i need to do is create a separate
45:49 - canvas a graphics object so i'm going to
45:52 - just call this numbers
45:55 - and i'm going to say numbers equals
45:58 - create graphics
46:00 - 400 400 and then i'm going to do all of
46:03 - this stuff
46:05 - on this graphics object so create
46:07 - graphics is a really excellent trick
46:10 - in p5 for doing all sorts of things
46:13 - with layering with backgrounds with
46:16 - mixing with
46:17 - image processing i can basically create
46:20 - a entirely separate graphics context
46:24 - which i draw onto in any way that i want
46:27 - so if i do this and then run this code
46:32 - let me see how much room do i really
46:33 - have here for you to see the code
46:36 - and the output so i don't see anything
46:39 - right now and i can i make the font a
46:41 - little bit smaller
46:43 - it looks like i can is this like zoomed
46:46 - in
46:47 - oh it's zoomed in no wonder it looked
46:49 - like crazy to me
46:51 - um all right this is how i prefer to do
46:52 - it
46:54 - uh 36 is good there there we go
46:59 - all right so i don't see anything so why
47:01 - do i not
47:02 - um see anything the reason why i don't
47:05 - see anything is i drew all this stuff to
47:06 - a separate graphics context that's just
47:08 - in memory
47:11 - now i could
47:14 - um i could draw that now
47:18 - [Music]
47:21 - so now it looks like a regular old p5
47:23 - sketch and i
47:25 - just please uh
47:28 - i something's very spooky is happening
47:31 - my nose
47:32 - it feels like it's running in the middle
47:34 - of a live stream
47:36 - i will be right back boy enjoy
47:56 - [Music]
48:00 - no matter what i do this random number
48:04 - it's cursed it's cursed i put so much
48:07 - tape on it
48:08 - it won't stay on my head
48:16 - but i have kleenex i will mute myself
48:22 - [Music]
48:37 - all right so um
48:38 - [Music]
48:40 - well this is really playing for a long
48:42 - time um one idea that i have
48:45 - is to go to the uh is it called fractal
48:47 - flame
48:48 - no no that's something else that's
48:50 - something that i'm working on that i let
48:51 - totally
48:52 - drop the ball on uh flames coding
48:54 - challenge
48:55 - coding train one possibility would
48:58 - actually be to use oh the fire effect
49:01 - use this do i have a p5 version of it
49:04 - so this is a coding challenge i did from
49:06 - years ago
49:08 - years ago no not too long ago which
49:10 - creates this kind of effect
49:13 - and so and it's being seeded by this
49:16 - noise field
49:17 - and i if i recall correctly i could use
49:19 - sort of the
49:20 - text numbers in this field and then i
49:23 - would sort of see like those
49:26 - uh those numbers like on fire
49:29 - so that's one way that i could approach
49:31 - this if anybody wants to like
49:32 - work on that right now behind the scenes
49:35 - uh share it back with me i could use
49:37 - that but i think i want to just go with
49:39 - a more traditional
49:40 - approach that i that with particles the
49:42 - particle system but this would be
49:44 - a nice one to do um you know i could
49:46 - then marching squares this to make it
49:47 - like sort of contour
49:48 - more contour-ish but i also really like
49:52 - the idea of
49:53 - carving my face not my face but your
49:55 - face into a pumpkin
49:56 - so that i that i have an idea for how i
49:58 - could also show
49:59 - today if i can do that but let's keep
50:01 - going with this so the idea now
50:03 - is instead of just drawing those numbers
50:06 - and let's make this a little bit
50:07 - wider um and let's put i don't think
50:10 - that that's really matters so much i
50:12 - want the numbers to actually just be
50:14 - um color i'm going to be able to set in
50:17 - my own way
50:18 - so and i want them to be why did they oh
50:21 - yeah
50:22 - [Music]
50:24 - oh the graphics object needs to be no
50:27 - sorry
50:28 - uh bigger okay and then i want them to
50:29 - sit at the bottom of the window
50:32 - so i think maybe that means i want to do
50:34 - this
50:36 - so i have this idea oh no they're
50:37 - dripping so they should be at the top
50:39 - [Music]
50:41 - so the top and then i guess if the font
50:44 - size is 128
50:46 - that means i just want to put them there
50:47 - i guess there's a little bit of like
50:49 - you know i could figure this out more
50:50 - exactly but
50:53 - this is how i like to code let's be a
50:55 - little bit more extreme here
50:57 - all right perfect so i want to make
50:59 - those drip
51:01 - so the way the idea that i have for the
51:03 - way to do that
51:04 - is not to actually display them
51:07 - but first let me just
51:10 - loop through all of the pixels of that
51:13 - image
51:14 - so if i start with x
51:16 - [Music]
51:18 - to the numbers with and i i the the
51:22 - width of the image and the width of the
51:23 - canvas is always going to be the same i
51:25 - think i'm going to skip every 10 pixels
51:26 - for now
51:27 - just to make this demonstration work
51:30 - tell me if i'm like blocking the code
51:31 - too much like do i need to move this
51:33 - i probably should move this over a tiny
51:35 - bit
51:36 - yeah then i need to do y
51:39 - [Music]
51:45 - then i need to find the index for each
51:49 - pixel
51:50 - and in p5 the formula for that is x
51:53 - plus y times width
51:55 - [Music]
51:58 - times four so this is the for every
52:01 - pixel in the pixel array
52:02 - there's rgb alpha so there's width times
52:05 - height times 4 pixels
52:07 - and then i can just say the red value is
52:10 - numbers
52:11 - pixels index
52:14 - and i'm going to say if r is greater
52:18 - than
52:20 - uh than zero because i know the exact
52:23 - pixel values they're black and white so
52:25 - if the red value is greater than zero
52:27 - i just want to draw a circle right at
52:30 - that x and y location
52:32 - and let's make it red eventually i'm
52:34 - going to make this a particle maybe i'll
52:36 - texture it
52:37 - but let's just see if this draws the
52:39 - number
52:42 - oh and i probably have to say numbers
52:44 - load pixels
52:48 - um so crabby posted something from
52:50 - reddit but there's no way i can read
52:51 - that right now so i might need the
52:53 - uh the summary of what that is so let's
52:56 - say load pixels
52:58 - there we go oh so already this is
53:00 - looking pretty good so you can see that
53:02 - i'm able to draw the numbers to an image
53:06 - and i feel like
53:07 - i need more pixel space now certainly i
53:11 - could
53:11 - uh so let's let's have us a step size
53:15 - a step i'm going to say that's 10. and
53:18 - for right now
53:19 - just to sort of understand um how this
53:22 - is
53:23 - this looks let's say no stroke
53:25 - [Music]
53:27 - i feel like i want to have a larger area
53:30 - to work with
53:33 - but i have limited screen space right
53:35 - now just in terms
53:36 - of um
53:40 - and let's just make this do my 51
53:44 - background so i can see it whoa
53:46 - what just happened there oh the
53:49 - background is 51.
53:50 - oh that has to be trans ah so then i
53:53 - would have to say greater than
53:54 - it's no yeah no no the background oh i
53:57 - need to do a background here this is
53:58 - what i meant to do i also need a
54:00 - background for the actual
54:02 - uh canvas i just want to be able to see
54:04 - the size of the canvas there we go
54:07 - so i think with i
54:10 - i guess maybe what i want actually is
54:13 - the opposite
54:15 - i want to have more room for the blood
54:17 - to drip
54:19 - whoa this is going crazy now and they
54:22 - don't match
54:23 - there we go so that's going to be my
54:26 - starting point
54:28 - and i need more room for the code so
54:30 - this can go over here and then i'm just
54:31 - curious to try like a step size of four
54:35 - and if we zoom in and look at this yeah
54:37 - i think that's going to kind of get me
54:39 - what i want
54:40 - okay so now instead of these
54:44 - being just dots i want to create
54:47 - particles
54:49 - that are sort of like falling but with a
54:52 - lot of like friction like
54:54 - dripping uh somehow dripping so i don't
54:56 - actually have any idea how i'm gonna
54:58 - make this work
54:59 - but i think i probably rather than code
55:01 - all this from scratch right now
55:03 - i should go to like one of my nature of
55:05 - code particle system examples
55:07 - so where's the best place for me to do
55:10 - that i guess if i go to github.com
55:12 - nature of code
55:16 - and i go to examples p5.js
55:20 - and i go under oops not oscillation
55:22 - under systems and i
55:25 - um
55:27 - [Music]
55:29 - and i don't know what's the single
55:31 - particle versus i think this is kind of
55:32 - what i'm looking for
55:34 - i mean in a way i don't think i need to
55:36 - over complicate this and i just need the
55:38 - particle class
55:40 - so let me grab this code this is very
55:43 - very little code actually
55:45 - um and that's oh this i'm going to stop
55:47 - this one i this would actually be really
55:49 - cool to try
55:51 - i shouldn't if i have time i want to
55:52 - come back to this one um
55:55 - and then uh i'm going to go
55:58 - here um and
56:02 - i need to add a particle particle.js
56:05 - file
56:07 - [Music]
56:10 - whoops no no did you not add a file
56:13 - create file
56:14 - particle.js and
56:18 - i'm going to paste that in here
56:22 - and then i need to reference it
56:29 - [Music]
56:31 - now is where i can move this over
56:33 - because okay
56:34 - so here we go now in the sketch
56:38 - i'm now going to have particles an array
56:42 - uh
56:44 - [Music]
56:47 - um this doesn't need to be drawn every
56:50 - time right
56:52 - this is just being rendered once at the
56:54 - beginning
56:55 - honestly i should just like load an
56:56 - image but it's nice that the code is
56:58 - doing it because it could be a different
56:59 - number each time
57:01 - um okay and then uh let's just just just
57:04 - should be a clear uh push i don't know
57:08 - what this is gonna do
57:09 - let's add a new particle at 100
57:13 - 300 400 and i don't remember what this
57:16 - code does
57:18 - let's say for every particle of
57:20 - particles
57:21 - [Music]
57:24 - particle.show particle.update
57:27 - i'm just making this up i'm guessing
57:30 - what that object did from the example
57:32 - a background of undefined
57:36 - oh this create graphics has to happen
57:38 - before i start drawing to it
57:42 - uh i've got some other error now
57:46 - position.copy is not a function particle
57:48 - line nine
57:50 - what oh what
57:55 - i prefer to do it this way
57:59 - so to pass in an x and y there we go now
58:01 - i still have
58:03 - show is not a function run update
58:07 - display i'm going to change the names
58:09 - okay
58:11 - all right so that's what this does it
58:14 - makes
58:15 - uh i've just made a hundred particles
58:16 - that fall with gravity
58:18 - okay this works uh yeah and krabby is
58:23 - writing i know nothing about
58:24 - constructors or classes
58:26 - so if this is new to you might i suggest
58:30 - [Laughter]
58:32 - [Music]
58:34 - hey are you new to the coding train is
58:37 - this your first day watching
58:39 - well guess what i don't usually wear a
58:41 - cape with random numbers on it but also
58:45 - you can learn to code from the coding
58:47 - train yourself
58:48 - on your own time with my tutorial series
58:53 - under beginners p5.js i'm actually
58:56 - hoping to update some of these videos in
58:58 - 2021
58:59 - because some of them are a little bit
59:00 - out of date but might i suggest to you
59:02 - scrolling down here and especially for
59:04 - what i'm doing right now
59:06 - you'll want to take a look at
59:08 - introduction to oop with
59:10 - es6 es6 is the version of javascript
59:14 - from 1972 that's how up-to-date i am in
59:17 - my javascript programming
59:19 - uh you can also watch uh classes in
59:23 - javascript with es6
59:25 - construct your arguments with classes in
59:27 - javascript and then
59:29 - you can even in the p5.js web editor add
59:32 - your own javascript file and then you
59:34 - can travel back in time
59:35 - and learn about what an array is all the
59:37 - way back to 2015.
59:40 - oh it was a simpler time in 2015.
59:43 - look how little gray hair i had i don't
59:46 - wear
59:46 - capes or glasses or hats i just talked
59:50 - about arrays i even used some strange p5
59:53 - desktop editors
59:54 - anyway back to what i was working on now
59:58 - thanks for tuning in today that's all
60:01 - i've got
60:02 - show's over people i'm done never coming
60:04 - back again
60:05 - it's all over here
60:08 - [Music]
60:12 - all right hopefully that helps somebody
60:13 - out um
60:16 - i had to do that because nobody's joined
60:18 - as a member during this live stream
60:23 - uh all right now what was i doing where
60:26 - was i
60:26 - yes so those are the particles now
60:29 - here's what i would like to do
60:32 - i'm going to take this loop
60:35 - here and
60:38 - just to sort of see
60:42 - what might happen let us
60:47 - instead of drawing a circle here
60:51 - put a particle at this
60:54 - x and y so let me run this so all the
60:57 - particles are going to originate
60:58 - at the number location um what happened
61:06 - step is not defined well i don't know
61:10 - how i lost that
61:11 - [Music]
61:13 - um let step equals a 4.
61:19 - there we go so we can see i'm on my way
61:22 - right what happens i see that number
61:24 - and then all these particles fall this
61:25 - is one of the reasons why i might like
61:27 - to work in processing also it's going to
61:28 - run quite slow
61:29 - but ultimately if the goal is to render
61:31 - out an image there's some other
61:33 - possibilities here so
61:34 - uh let's change this to
61:43 - let's change this to
61:45 - [Music]
61:47 - a red color
61:52 - and let's actually say no stroke
61:57 - let's change this to red
62:00 - let's run this again okay whoa why okay
62:03 - and now i definitely need to
62:06 - set the background back to black
62:10 - it's perfect
62:13 - um what just happened here why do i not
62:16 - see the particles something i did
62:18 - something wrong in the rendering of them
62:19 - oh
62:20 - 25 255 please
62:23 - there we go all right so this is getting
62:26 - somewhere
62:28 - um so um okay
62:31 - all right so now i think i want to do
62:33 - something different
62:35 - which is
62:38 - i actually just want to keep track of a
62:40 - list of spots
62:43 - and i am going to say instead of
62:46 - making a new particle i'm going to say
62:49 - spots
62:50 - equal push
62:54 - create vector x y so i just want to
62:57 - and maybe the step size actually doesn't
62:59 - need to be
63:00 - four it can be one here because i'm just
63:03 - going to keep track of all
63:04 - of the possible spots where a particle
63:07 - could start and then
63:10 - i can pick a random one
63:14 - and say particles push
63:17 - spot dot x spot dot y well this is why i
63:20 - should have
63:21 - kept it the other way but that's fine
63:23 - all right so now i think if i run this
63:26 - [Music]
63:28 - spots is an array spots push create
63:30 - vector
63:31 - random spot spot what did it not like
63:34 - here
63:35 - particle.show is not a function what
63:39 - oh because
63:43 - oh new particle new particle i have to
63:46 - make a new particle
63:47 - at that spot
63:48 - [Music]
63:50 - there okay so now i'm
63:54 - making a new part so a couple things one
63:56 - is i don't this physics
63:58 - is not right for blood dripping so in
64:00 - the particle
64:01 - i don't it shouldn't have an initial
64:03 - velocity
64:05 - its initial velocity can just be zero
64:07 - zero
64:09 - and the gravity is fine but
64:13 - blood as it's dripping doesn't speed up
64:15 - really
64:16 - it's a much slower it's sort of like it
64:19 - reaches a terminal
64:21 - dripping sort of amount i would say
64:23 - fairly quickly
64:27 - uh so and maybe it doesn't shouldn't
64:30 - fade out it should leave more of a trail
64:32 - i wonder if actually
64:35 - i'm just curious what would this is
64:37 - probably gonna look terrible
64:39 - if i put the background in setup yeah
64:41 - that's this is more like what i'm going
64:43 - for
64:46 - but um can i that's actually surprised
64:50 - me just now
64:51 - that that work could i fade out the
64:53 - background over time
64:58 - so again it's speeding up too much i
65:01 - need to give it like an
65:02 - air resistance i suppose i think
65:05 - probably an easy way for me to do this
65:08 - in update where's the update method is
65:10 - just to say this stop velocity
65:12 - multiply like just take five percent off
65:16 - the velocity every frame
65:18 - so i want them to be more stuck
65:21 - although they don't i
65:25 - suppose maybe it should be like a random
65:28 - amount
65:29 - [Music]
65:35 - it's more like dripping but their
65:38 - lifespan
65:39 - should be maybe much longer
65:44 - attach them with springs
65:47 - shouldn't the fade be in reverse that's
65:49 - an interesting idea so i'm not seeing
65:50 - that so one thing that i really need to
65:52 - do first of all these particles should
65:53 - be much smaller
65:56 - um ellipse 12. so let's give it a size
66:00 - um and let's just say
66:04 - this dot r times two so that's the
66:06 - radius and actually let's look at the
66:08 - radius two
66:08 - [Music]
66:10 - um and then again this isn't exactly
66:15 - going exactly right i think let's
66:18 - make you know 10 particles per frame i
66:22 - just need a lot more
66:25 - we'll definitely improve things there we
66:28 - go all right
66:29 - so i'm kind of getting there but really
66:32 - it just looks like
66:33 - a particley
66:37 - mess so
66:40 - i think that actually
66:43 - they should probably have a small chance
66:47 - of dripping like they don't all drip
66:50 - people are telling me that css filters
66:52 - they fade in
66:55 - [Music]
66:57 - so honorable that's a great suggestion
66:59 - but i think i want to try to do this
67:00 - without css
67:02 - just because i don't know how to do any
67:03 - of that i would love for somebody to
67:05 - contribute
67:06 - an idea like that
67:10 - so all right i need to take a short
67:11 - break um
67:14 - so um i'm gonna this is like a good
67:17 - start
67:18 - um what i would uh what i would what i'm
67:21 - gonna do is i'm gonna share this link to
67:22 - this sketch right now
67:24 - uh here so uh if you when i take the
67:28 - break um if you want to like play around
67:30 - with it a little bit and if anybody like
67:32 - also i should just limit the velocity
67:33 - that not multiply it
67:35 - that's simon said that's a good idea if
67:36 - people want to like uh
67:38 - mess with it a little bit and give me
67:39 - some tips of how i could make it more
67:41 - blood dripping like
67:43 - another thing could be just to actually
67:45 - it might make sense for me to draw
67:48 - um you know i wonder if actually like
67:51 - overlaying the dots
67:52 - on that image and of course it needs to
67:54 - be red
67:55 - [Music]
68:01 - might actually like improve the dripping
68:04 - equality to it again this is like off
68:07 - uh i need it to be much more streaky
68:09 - maybe it should be faster and fade out
68:11 - faster i don't know
68:13 - each particle deposits a small amount
68:15 - decrease the particle's radius ah that's
68:17 - a very interesting idea
68:18 - i like that idea so um i'm gonna i just
68:21 - i'm saving this sketch um you can play
68:24 - around with it and i will look for your
68:26 - tips
68:27 - but i very very briefly want to thank
68:30 - today's sponsor of the live stream
68:32 - um and that is my
68:36 - friends over at
68:40 - brilliant so uh do you want to
68:43 - wait i said you should be spooky about
68:45 - brilliant today
68:49 - do you want to learn something new
68:52 - something spooky and new
68:54 - brilliance is the place to do it i i
68:56 - think maybe i won't do my shtick
68:57 - when talking about brilliant so i i i
68:59 - love brilliant it's one of the websites
69:01 - that i use
69:02 - to try to find a lot of material for the
69:04 - coding train
69:07 - their approach is based on problem
69:08 - solving and active learning so you're
69:10 - seeing concepts
69:11 - visually and interacting with them and
69:13 - then answering questions that get you to
69:14 - think
69:15 - and they have a lot of wonderful courses
69:18 - so here i'm showing you
69:19 - um this is highly related to a lot of
69:21 - the tutorials that are on my channel
69:22 - right now
69:23 - there's a whole uh course about neural
69:25 - networks
69:26 - and in fact the next video that i'll be
69:29 - releasing
69:30 - is about training an image classifier
69:33 - with the ml5.js convolutional neural
69:35 - network and if you go through the
69:37 - brilliant course on neural networks that
69:38 - is the perfect foundation or complement
69:40 - to the stuff that i'm doing there's also
69:42 - this new course that i've talked about
69:44 - in
69:44 - previous times around infinity um
69:48 - and so um this is one that i really love
69:51 - it relates to like
69:52 - all sorts of fractal patterns and things
69:54 - that i've been looking at i mean
69:56 - reckoning with infinity is one of the
69:57 - major accomplishments of mathematics
69:59 - so this course it starts with basic
70:01 - counting
70:03 - and you work all the way up to many
70:05 - different kinds of infinity
70:06 - culminating in the profundity of
70:08 - cantor's theorem so i've done a lot of
70:10 - stuff with fractals
70:11 - but the other thing that i should
70:12 - mention is that um there are big
70:14 - updates coming to brilliant uh this
70:16 - month it's october 31st a lot of them
70:18 - might already be there but they'll
70:19 - certainly be there
70:20 - if you ch as the month as the month as
70:22 - the date transitions into november
70:24 - so stay tuned for updates um
70:28 - and i think what i would like to do
70:30 - which i always enjoy
70:31 - taking a minute to do on the stream and
70:33 - let me come back to here
70:35 - is go to the brilliant website and check
70:37 - out what today's
70:39 - um challenge is and actually this is one
70:42 - of those days
70:43 - where i have not done this in advance
70:45 - because i was very busy getting my
70:47 - costume together this morning usually i
70:49 - look at the challenge before i start
70:51 - and this is a calc doku puzzle
70:55 - what is it i mean i assume it's like
70:56 - sudoku fill the squares with a single
70:59 - digit
71:00 - each with the following rules each of
71:03 - the digits one through
71:04 - three is used exactly once okay oh it's
71:07 - three by three so you get to use one
71:08 - through three
71:09 - a marked region has anybody done a
71:12 - puzzle like this before i got to get the
71:13 - chat back open i'm not seeing it right
71:15 - now
71:15 - um simon is saying that his
71:19 - favorite course is the one on search
71:21 - engines that's not one that i've looked
71:23 - at i definitely am curious to check that
71:24 - out
71:25 - um if you're interested in search
71:28 - engines i might also really recommend
71:30 - reading the book algorithms of
71:31 - oppression by dr sophia noble
71:33 - fantastic book around uh the sort of
71:36 - history and politics of search engines
71:39 - i really recommend it i was in a book
71:40 - club over the summer loved that book
71:42 - um okay in the example below the region
71:44 - mark 7 plus must be
71:46 - filled keep reading so seven
71:49 - plus must be filled with oh so two and
71:53 - three have to go
71:54 - here no no one two three so you get
71:56 - seven
71:57 - one can't go here so one has to go here
72:00 - oh i can't do it because it's stepping
72:02 - me through the solution
72:03 - three goes there two two oh no no oh i
72:06 - could do two twice
72:08 - so two can't go here because it would be
72:11 - in the same line or column
72:12 - got it got it got it got it it's not one
72:14 - two three and here it's in the line okay
72:15 - okay i think i get it
72:17 - today's challenge oh no i hate these i
72:19 - really find these difficult
72:20 - how many solutions does this puzzle have
72:23 - so i guess i have to work on
72:25 - solving it and psy in the chat is saying
72:28 - use a
72:29 - viscous force yeah i do have a whole
72:32 - section in the nature of code
72:33 - on and i bet you there's a brilliant
72:35 - course on this
72:36 - on drag force um
72:39 - and so uh let me let's i'll come back to
72:42 - that but let me um
72:45 - let me try this okay so if there's a two
72:48 - here and this this has to be 4 with
72:51 - multiplication
72:53 - so the only way i can get 4 is 4 times 1
72:56 - times 1 or 2 times 2
72:59 - times 1 right but i can't do 2 times 2
73:02 - because no so this so it has to be oh
73:04 - and then the four has to go here
73:06 - the one has to go here and the one has
73:08 - to go there
73:09 - right okay uh oh
73:13 - help me out folks what do i do next um
73:16 - two minus so i could get two minus three
73:20 - minus one i can't do that
73:22 - four minus two i
73:25 - can't do that so it has to be five minus
73:28 - three which means a four has to go there
73:30 - aha
73:31 - right okay that's good moving along here
73:33 - is there anything
73:35 - i don't want to deal with the 72. this
73:37 - is like one number what do i do with
73:38 - that
73:39 - it's just any number um
73:42 - all right maybe i do want to deal with
73:43 - the 72 how do i get
73:46 - oh by the way this is kind of related to
73:47 - i was helping my son with his
73:49 - sixth grade math and he was doing prime
73:50 - factorization
73:52 - so what's the prime factorization of 72
73:56 - uh 2 times 2 times 2 times 3
74:00 - is that right or 4 times 3
74:04 - or 3 times 3 times 4 times 2
74:10 - it's so hard to do this in my head 72.
74:14 - 9 i think i've got to use a 9 here right
74:16 - 9 times 4
74:18 - is 36 times 2 is 72
74:21 - yeah so two threes so the two
74:24 - threes and the to the two
74:28 - can't go here and the threes have to go
74:31 - either here or here
74:35 - um
74:39 - the two can't go here the two
74:43 - the three this has to be two threes and
74:47 - two twos is that what i'm saying
74:51 - or four and a one but i can't do a four
74:53 - and a one
74:54 - what did i just say three times three is
74:56 - nine
74:58 - times no no three three four two
75:01 - so the four can't go here the four has
75:03 - to go here
75:04 - and the two can't go here
75:07 - so am i right and saying that the two
75:10 - has to go here
75:11 - and the four has to go here and these
75:13 - are threes and threes
75:14 - no because this could be switched but i
75:17 - can't
75:19 - or could i switch these two also
75:25 - all right this is not right someone's
75:28 - gonna tell me
75:31 - uh right three times three there's not
75:35 - obviously more that i and then a two
75:38 - would have to go here right
75:40 - this kind of makes sense well this is
75:41 - one possibility but are there other did
75:44 - i i might have jumped the gun here
75:46 - uh
75:49 - oh this is hard this is very spooky
75:55 - where do the numbers go
75:58 - [Music]
75:59 - there's only one possibility for the
76:01 - threes
76:03 - all right so says k week month let me
76:05 - figure that out
76:07 - right because what happens if i put the
76:10 - threes here
76:13 - okay i can't put a four ah yeah i can't
76:15 - put a 4 here and i can't put a 2 there
76:17 - so perfect thank you three threes
76:21 - now if i've done that
76:24 - then the four has to go here and the two
76:26 - has to go here
76:28 - and then that means a five has to go
76:30 - here okay
76:32 - so i think
76:34 - [Music]
76:36 - oh and uh this is this is not a five
76:39 - goes here
76:40 - yeah a five goes there okay
76:43 - i think this is the only possibility now
76:45 - what else do i know
76:47 - so nine plus how do i get to nine
76:50 - four four plus it has to be
76:53 - i'd have to be unique numbers so i can't
76:56 - do four plus five
76:57 - has to be four plus three plus two so a
76:59 - three has to go here
77:01 - and a 2 has to go here okay i'm getting
77:04 - there
77:05 - 4 divided by 4 divided by 1 is a
77:08 - possibility
77:10 - no yeah or that's it that's the only way
77:13 - i can get
77:14 - 4 right four divided by one
77:17 - so this has to be a four and this has to
77:18 - be a one
77:21 - six plus four
77:25 - three two so i only have five and a one
77:27 - so this has to be a five
77:29 - and this has to be a one okay
77:33 - oh wait and now i know this has to be a
77:35 - one
77:36 - and this has to be a three okay
77:41 - cooking with gas people
77:44 - uh yeah
77:51 - the numbers what do they mean
77:55 - i'm so scared of them um
77:58 - all right so to get 10
78:02 - well to get let's do 40 has to have five
78:04 - in it
78:06 - five wait a three is that going to work
78:09 - for the 40 to get four let's think about
78:11 - how i'm going to get 40
78:14 - 5 times 3 is 15.
78:18 - something's wrong here
78:22 - this doesn't seem right hold on
78:26 - oh do i have something wrong
78:30 - oh this could be this way yeah
78:33 - this could be this way i'm still
78:36 - unique everywhere okay so i think
78:40 - actually i just discovered
78:41 - why
78:44 - this has to be
78:47 - oh no no no no hold on but there's a 4
78:50 - there
78:51 - so it has to be 4 and 1.
78:55 - one something is wrong
78:58 - can this be a three and this ah
79:02 - i think it has to be like this because
79:05 - this has to be a four
79:07 - in order for me to say uh five the only
79:10 - way to get 40 is five times two
79:12 - and i need a five and a two here so i
79:14 - made a mistake somewhere
79:15 - i think i've got it now i made a mistake
79:18 - yeah you can't get a 40 with a three so
79:23 - 5 times 4 times 2 okay so
79:26 - this has to be a 5 but these can be in
79:28 - either place right now right
79:30 - 5 can be in either place 2 minus 5 and 3
79:35 - so 5 and 3 5
79:39 - and 2 those both work
79:42 - but 3 and 5 and 2 and 5 both work
79:46 - and so let's say if i did this
79:49 - then the 2 would go here for 10 plus
79:52 - wait no 10 plus oh but i have a 5 there
79:56 - so 2 and a 3.
79:59 - no something's wrong oh wait 2 and 3.
80:03 - no
80:06 - two and five oh there we go
80:09 - so that's a solution
80:13 - that is a solution so i got a solution
80:15 - the question is are there more i think
80:17 - that i can swap these
80:20 - three and five two and five three and
80:23 - two
80:23 - yeah okay that's two solutions
80:29 - there's definitely two five and two
80:32 - five and three
80:38 - two and five in the middle column oh
80:41 - these can be swapped
80:42 - no oh these can be swapped
80:48 - two and five
80:51 - is that another oh no no
80:59 - i can't swap it vertically
81:03 - uh there's definitely two solutions
81:07 - i think there's more right because
81:08 - there's more combinations of swapping
81:10 - these around
81:14 - can i swap these oh yeah that's three
81:18 - three oh there's four there's four
81:20 - because i can swap these
81:23 - [Music]
81:25 - and then i can swap these so that's two
81:27 - there's four there's four i'm gonna go
81:29 - with this four
81:30 - four four ready
81:32 - [Music]
81:40 - i'm so scared this is scared
81:56 - [Music]
82:05 - ah i got it right
82:10 - thank you everybody thank you
82:14 - i got it right that was really fun i
82:17 - love this
82:18 - is this a thing doku
82:21 - i've never heard or did brilliant invent
82:23 - this i've never heard of it before
82:24 - i want to do more doku puzzles i want to
82:27 - make my own
82:28 - goku i really got to make a sudoku
82:30 - puzzle generator that would be a
82:32 - wonderful
82:33 - um coding challenge to do i'll have to
82:35 - find the time to do that sometime
82:37 - all right let me take a very brief break
82:39 - um
82:40 - thank you so much to brilliant for the
82:42 - sponsorship again
82:43 - uh please take the time right now if you
82:45 - have a minute to sign up for free at
82:46 - brilliant.org
82:47 - codingtrain lets them know you found out
82:49 - about brilliant through the coding train
82:51 - um
82:52 - you can sign up for free you can do your
82:54 - the countdoku puzzle yourself
82:55 - you can um offer your own explanation i
82:58 - guess there's other people who have
83:00 - uh explained it here's somebody um
83:01 - allison snyder from the staff
83:03 - oh wow i can walk through it step by
83:04 - step oh that's really cool
83:07 - um and uh to unlock everything that
83:10 - brilliant has to order through a premium
83:11 - subscription
83:12 - you'll get uh 20 off through that um
83:14 - link so
83:15 - okay i'm going to take a short
83:18 - intermission break um
83:20 - and just to refill my coffee and then
83:23 - i'll finish with my random number blood
83:25 - dripping and i gotta show
83:26 - some community contributions today i
83:28 - mean i can't i have to do that every
83:30 - [Music]
83:32 - saturday
83:34 - [Music]
83:43 - [Music]
83:50 - [Music]
84:10 - [Music]
85:32 - [Music]
85:45 - [Music]
86:32 - [Music]
87:22 - [Music]
87:41 - no microphone i was muted
87:45 - hello
87:48 - it is i count random number back
87:52 - from intermission to read to you the
87:55 - random number
88:00 - four hundred and forty five
88:05 - oh my god eight eight eight eight eight
88:09 - eight eight eight eight eight
88:14 - this is not going very well is it
88:18 - you think maybe i could hire like a
88:20 - writer and i could get like uh
88:23 - i don't know some cue cards
88:29 - all right where were we
88:32 - we were attempting thank you again to
88:34 - brilliant the sponsor of today's live
88:36 - stream that's probably the last time
88:37 - they'll
88:37 - sponsor me again so thanks for all the
88:40 - times you sponsored me before
88:48 - 30 479 it's coming to get me
88:53 - so i want to figure out how to make this
88:55 - better
88:55 - [Music]
88:57 - and after i make it better
89:00 - [Music]
89:02 - after i make it better oh yeah it was
89:05 - great muted with the soundtrack
89:07 - i should just mute myself more often
89:09 - here i'm going to mute myself
89:09 - [Music]
89:19 - i think i think i pulled a muscle in my
89:20 - neck there so i want to make this better
89:22 - it doesn't really one thing that's like
89:24 - really slowed down because of all the
89:26 - particles that it actually works a
89:28 - little bit better
89:29 - the popping up of it is definitely a
89:32 - problem
89:32 - so people are saying fade in using the
89:34 - viscous force
89:36 - um is an interesting idea i don't think
89:38 - i need a sophisticated formula
89:40 - um like uh you know ultimately
89:44 - um i think a terminal velocity would
89:46 - make sense and actually maybe even
89:48 - coming to a stopping point
89:50 - um would be good i'm just curious if i
89:54 - make this
89:55 - even more
89:57 - [Music]
89:59 - so let's let's try a couple things i
90:02 - want to try
90:03 - the fading um
90:06 - in and also i don't know that i
90:10 - actually need to fade the particles
90:13 - because
90:13 - of the way that the background
90:20 - is oh i forgot i'm drawing the numbers
90:22 - so this
90:23 - this fading in the background is
90:24 - irrelevant oh you know what i should be
90:26 - doing
90:28 - is numbers should not should be clear
90:32 - transparent
90:34 - there we go this is what i was trying to
90:38 - do
90:38 - that's much better
90:42 - that's the effect that i was going for
90:44 - um
90:45 - now i can put this back i knew something
90:49 - was wrong here
90:51 - but fading in is important this like
90:53 - them popping up is weird
90:55 - um it certainly looks less weird a
90:57 - little later
90:59 - maybe all right so this is a little bit
91:02 - better ah
91:05 - oh i did miss your message violet could
91:08 - you violet do you have permission to
91:09 - post that
91:10 - into the discord links channel hopefully
91:13 - you do
91:15 - because that's i mean uh that's the best
91:17 - place uh for me
91:19 - to pull that up oh oh violet just did
91:22 - the coding challenge for me
91:24 - um all right so i'll grab that uh from
91:26 - there
91:27 - um although i could just like remove my
91:29 - screen and grab it i guess that's what
91:30 - i'll do i just don't like to show
91:31 - anybody's chat messages without their
91:33 - permission while i'm live streaming
91:36 - um but i'll download that really briefly
91:39 - [Music]
91:42 - um
91:46 - and uh i'll take a look at that in a
91:48 - second
91:49 - um so
91:53 - um but let me go back to what i was
91:56 - doing
92:00 - so i feel like the fading in is a good
92:02 - idea
92:03 - um i actually don't think that i want
92:06 - them to fade out on their own
92:12 - because i only want to fade them
92:15 - the truth of the matter is actually i
92:17 - think that i should just be using
92:19 - fewer of them and not fading it out
92:23 - at all um and i want to be
92:26 - i think i want to just use the bottom i
92:29 - think this would be most effective
92:32 - [Music]
92:34 - with yeah here i think i have an idea
92:38 - i think i actually i think the sort of
92:39 - physics aspect of this was a little
92:41 - misguided
92:43 - so let me do this in a different way
92:46 - let me take this out completely um let
92:49 - me just do
92:50 - one let's have each particle
92:55 - start with a lifespan of one
93:00 - and in update i'm going to say
93:05 - i'm going to say i'm going to add also a
93:07 - direction
93:10 - [Music]
93:11 - let's try fading it in i don't know if
93:13 - fading it in is really what i'm looking
93:15 - to do here
93:16 - lifespan plus di uh plus
93:19 - equals dir if this dot lifespan
93:23 - is greater than equal to 255 dir
93:26 - equals negative one so this will work
93:30 - and then when it gets down below zero oh
93:33 - i'm not removing the particles um
93:37 - so what there's probably like a
93:39 - filtering thing i can do
93:41 - particles.filter
93:45 - [Music]
93:48 - i keep it if it's not dead is that what
93:50 - i do
93:51 - i think that's what i do and do i need
93:52 - to set the array equal to it i think
93:54 - this
93:55 - right i want to filter out the ones that
93:57 - i don't want anymore
93:59 - uh what did that do dir is not defined
94:06 - i said that in the exact same intonation
94:08 - as firework is not defined
94:12 - as always i always forget that this
94:14 - stock this stock
94:18 - that's i thought it was going to say
94:19 - firework is not defined there
94:21 - um
94:22 - [Music]
94:24 - this dot dir this dot this dot this dot
94:32 - so this is definitely looking more
94:34 - promising with the fading in
94:37 - uh but i uh i'm not
94:40 - actually drawing it with its lifespan
94:42 - anymore let's just see
94:44 - if that helps
94:46 - [Music]
94:50 - it's fading in very very very slowly
94:54 - so that's kind of interesting
94:58 - uh and
95:06 - so this is very streaky i like that
95:12 - uh so there's something about the
95:14 - streakiness is good it's a
95:16 - it's a bit much here um the fading in
95:18 - should happen much much faster
95:20 - so let's just try like 10 times as fast
95:24 - fading in
95:28 - um should r be one
95:33 - [Music]
95:36 - so the dripping is much to
95:40 - uh and maybe actually
95:44 - is what i want to do less about
95:47 - a continuous sequence
95:51 - and more about
95:55 - um just having a fixed number of them
95:58 - [Music]
96:03 - right so this this is kind of like what
96:07 - i was going for
96:09 - what i've got here i don't like how they
96:11 - appear
96:13 - well that's fine um the problem is the
96:16 - number is so
96:18 - correct looking i wonder if i should
96:21 - actually
96:22 - draw the
96:25 - the number um
96:29 - like what if i also do this
96:33 - like instead of drawing the image
96:36 - let's draw the number
96:38 - [Music]
96:40 - uh
96:43 - [Music]
96:47 - what if i sorry
96:50 - sorry for a stroke stroke 255
96:54 - 0 0 point spots
96:58 - index i dot x
97:03 - so this is this is not what i want to do
97:05 - because it's just literally drawing
97:06 - all of them as points but if i give it a
97:09 - little bit of noisiness to it
97:11 - um
97:13 - [Music]
97:14 - so if i were to say
97:16 - [Music]
97:19 - uh like offset these a little bit maybe
97:23 - actually let's do it a different way uh
97:28 - this is maybe like a weird direction
97:30 - that i'm going in but i kind of want it
97:32 - just to i'll first look
97:34 - a little
97:35 - [Music]
97:39 - um and let's actually pick a random one
97:43 - each time
97:45 - so let me do it this way i'll do the
97:48 - same number of spots but
97:50 - [Music]
97:54 - and what if i were to do this
97:58 - [Music]
98:00 - offset dot x so i just want to offset
98:03 - them all a little bit
98:04 - um
98:06 - [Music]
98:09 - multiply that by two stroke weight two
98:11 - and give this a little alpha
98:13 - [Music]
98:15 - whoa it's taking a long time uh oh
98:18 - oh no i think i might have crashed
98:20 - myself into an infinite loop
98:23 - or is it just like taking forever to
98:26 - render this
98:28 - okay stroke weight was expecting no more
98:29 - than one argument oh that stroke weight
98:33 - [Music]
98:37 - why did that take so long let's just
98:41 - start with a hundred of them
98:45 - okay so that is yeah
98:49 - a thousand
98:53 - oh look at that ah it's just got a lot
98:55 - of spots
98:58 - so maybe i want to lower the resolution
99:00 - here for a second to four
99:02 - and do a stroke weight of four
99:06 - yeah this is good so why are they all oh
99:10 - no
99:10 - i don't wanna yeah
99:12 - [Music]
99:16 - that this is good this is more the
99:18 - number is sort of like
99:21 - you need to drop drops to break off from
99:23 - the streaks i don't know what that means
99:26 - a spookier font would help yes
99:29 - [Laughter]
99:33 - uh the font is too big spooky or font
99:36 - yeah and so
99:37 - the other thing is like let's make the
99:39 - step size
99:40 - two it's gonna take a while that's a
99:44 - little bit better
99:46 - yeah but i think rather than that
99:51 - if i make the step size four do the
99:54 - offset a little bit bigger
99:57 - and do just twice the number of spots
100:00 - [Music]
100:02 - whoops what did i do wrong here
100:11 - oh there's a parenthesis there okay
100:14 - cannot read x of undef oh oh i still
100:17 - have the
100:18 - uh i wasn't doing the random ones
100:21 - want it to be random which is a little
100:25 - silly but
100:26 - yeah so i wonder if i use like a little
100:30 - image texture
100:31 - or make this much bigger like it's kind
100:34 - of silly now
100:35 - like i should go back to having this be
100:38 - um just in the center
100:43 - let's try doing this 256.
100:46 - like i don't really need this to be at
100:47 - the top
100:52 - um and maybe this needs to be like 800
100:55 - now go back to this 800 by 600
100:57 - just want this to be a little bigger oh
101:00 - i got to change both of these
101:03 - remember how this was going to end up
101:04 - being like a jack-o'-lantern design
101:07 - i'm not sure if i really okay so
101:10 - all right this is much better
101:14 - than uh then
101:18 - what this is getting better there's no
101:20 - significance to this number
101:22 - so first let's make this a uh
101:28 - uh random up to a hundred thousand
101:32 - because that's what the
101:33 - random number book floor it
101:35 - [Music]
101:37 - and let's uh let's do that so it should
101:39 - be a different number now
101:41 - each time i run it but it should always
101:44 - have five digits
101:45 - number format number format
101:49 - num comma five so hopefully
101:53 - [Music]
101:55 - okay so we're going to get a new random
101:56 - number each time now i think i could
101:58 - improve
102:00 - the blood dripping so i think having it
102:02 - be a larger
102:03 - circle that shrinks changing the
102:06 - background image is a good idea
102:08 - the color could be something more
102:11 - bloody so let's but i my idea right now
102:15 - is to have uh
102:19 - this dot r of like four
102:22 - and then this dot r minus equal
102:26 - 0.1 or something like that
102:31 - uh i guess when it gets
102:35 - below oh below zero
102:39 - so maybe i should do map
102:42 - this dot life span which goes between 0
102:45 - and 52 55
102:48 - to between 1 and 4. can i do that
102:52 - [Music]
102:53 - oh boy little
102:57 - zoinks
103:02 - [Music]
103:05 - oh wait i still have this in here ah
103:07 - that was weird
103:12 - okay what's going on here
103:14 - [Music]
103:17 - what's going on with the lifespan
103:20 - starts at one direction is 10.
103:26 - so if it's greater than 255 it becomes
103:29 - negative one
103:30 - oh and
103:32 - [Music]
103:36 - maybe i need to set it to 255.
103:40 - no shouldn't it now go
103:43 - down and then eventually go past zero
103:58 - wait why is my thing why are these
104:01 - particles getting so
104:02 - large map oh minus
104:05 - equals no no no that's why that's the
104:07 - mistake
104:11 - so they're getting yeah that's good it's
104:14 - so
104:15 - it's all too perfect though right it
104:18 - needs to have more variety
104:20 - to it so i think that
104:24 - there should be this should be uh a
104:27 - random value
104:28 - between two and five uh r
104:32 - max and then so this should be
104:35 - r max and then
104:39 - um this should help and this dot r
104:42 - equals let's make it 0 for right now to
104:46 - start
104:48 - um oh this dot rmax
104:52 - sorry i need to make the cut font a
104:54 - little smaller so i just don't have
104:56 - enough
104:57 - space to work with here
105:08 - okay and that's getting better it's
105:10 - pretty spooky looking
105:13 - this is looking pretty good actually
105:15 - they look bubbly right i need to like
105:17 - fill that in more
105:18 - so maybe this where i'm drawing them
105:21 - here
105:23 - let's just see what happens if i make
105:25 - this 8.
105:30 - still kind of bubbly
105:33 - how do i i guess i could use i probably
105:34 - wanted like some sort of texture
105:37 - um
105:38 - [Music]
105:41 - how do i make them i guess i guess i
105:44 - could just go maybe i want to go through
105:46 - all the spots
105:48 - so i don't leave any of them and let's
105:51 - go back to
105:51 - two
105:52 - [Music]
105:55 - right oh but i'm i've got the step
105:59 - size um
106:06 - right
106:11 - better i mean what i really want to do
106:13 - is go over it like four times
106:18 - uh i modulus
106:22 - spots dot length
106:29 - yeah the radius should increase instead
106:33 - of decrease
106:35 - yeah they look like spikes
106:40 - or maybe it should just be random
106:45 - [Music]
106:47 - let's have a look at uh what violet did
106:50 - [Laughter]
106:52 - uh where was this
106:55 - download to here yeah
107:07 - let's have a look at what violet did
107:09 - [Music]
107:13 - ah i like this so this is using that uh
107:16 - fire effect oh this is nice
107:20 - i'm pleased that this isn't like a
107:22 - million times better than what i did
107:25 - just because i was feeling very
107:26 - inadequate for how
107:28 - i'm getting this to look um so let me
107:31 - come back to this
107:31 - i think the i think one thing that might
107:35 - work well
107:36 - is um i realized the spikiness is kind
107:40 - of weird
107:41 - i wonder if actually
107:44 - doing them a little bit uh now
107:51 - like 10 at a time here might actually be
107:55 - kind of nice
108:00 - like and then like it's just getting
108:03 - overwhelmed
108:04 - with particles uh so
108:07 - it's better to limit it but i do like
108:10 - the idea for seeing it a little bit at a
108:12 - time
108:17 - so i could say here if
108:21 - spots.length
108:24 - let's count
108:26 - [Music]
108:30 - uh i could just say if frame count
108:34 - if uh frame count
108:37 - is less than 100
108:40 - i want to finish this up like people
108:42 - will make a much better version of this
108:44 - eventually change the shades of red by
108:47 - the radius
108:48 - fade the particles have some stop
108:51 - shorter than others perhaps
108:53 - so the stopping shorter than others
108:54 - should sort of work by the mere fact
108:56 - that they're all starting at random
108:58 - locations
109:01 - make the last iteration bigger
109:05 - so many interesting ideas here
109:10 - i think that i should stop here and
109:12 - people are going to make much better
109:14 - versions of this
109:15 - what i wanted to look at is how to make
109:18 - this into
109:19 - something that you could carve into a
109:22 - pumpkin
109:23 - so actually
109:26 - i think i want to move on to that um
109:29 - and yeah it should track like a rain
109:32 - droplet on a windshield so
109:34 - once again it's the same url i'm going
109:37 - to
109:38 - link this uh let's do this um
109:44 - if uh what would be great is if uh
109:47 - i think everybody should play around
109:48 - with this and see if you can get it to
109:50 - improve
109:50 - and all and then you could share back um
109:54 - i guess i could make a page for this
109:56 - here's an old one but the drops are more
109:58 - likely to spawn at the bottom
110:00 - from bopple apple and then maybe i could
110:02 - collect them if somebody could sort of
110:04 - collect a few contributions
110:06 - um you know in a way that i could
110:07 - retrieve them maybe a github issue
110:11 - thread
110:11 - um then i can look at a few variations
110:14 - of this but i want to actually move on
110:16 - because i would like to carve i would
110:18 - like to see if i can make something
110:20 - where you could
110:20 - carve your the contours of your face
110:23 - into a pumpkin and i have a very very
110:25 - specific idea
110:26 - of how to do this um so let's
110:29 - let's put this aside and save it i'm
110:31 - gonna hit stop that's like as far as i'm
110:33 - getting with this today
110:34 - i think and i just want to
110:39 - do the following you're going to see
110:40 - you're going to like this let's make a
110:42 - video
110:43 - [Music]
110:45 - 640 by 480.
110:48 - [Music]
110:49 - actually let's make it smaller 320 by
110:51 - 240.
110:53 - um and i'm going to say
110:56 - a video equals create capture
111:00 - um
111:03 - [Music]
111:05 - 320 to oh no video this is how you
111:08 - create capture video
111:09 - video dot size 320 240 um and let's just
111:13 - try this
111:14 - image video zero zero so i'm making a
111:19 - uh you know
111:22 - jack o lantern filter
111:26 - [Music]
111:29 - allow using the camera
111:33 - okay so now we see i have the video
111:36 - image
111:37 - right here it's actually nice that i
111:39 - have a green screen this will make this
111:41 - work really well
111:43 - the video image here and then the raw
111:45 - video and then drawing into the canvas
111:46 - because what i want to use use
111:48 - this filter function threshold and i'm
111:51 - just going to say 0.5
111:52 - right now let's see what i get
111:55 - so what this is doing is it's taking the
111:57 - video
111:58 - and applying a threshold filter to it so
112:01 - every pixel
112:02 - is by definition can only be drawn as
112:04 - black or white
112:05 - and then and based on a given threshold
112:08 - of brightness
112:09 - so one thing that i think would be
112:10 - useful would be for me to have a slider
112:15 - i'm going to say slider equals create
112:16 - slider and the range is between 0 and 1.
112:19 - i'll start with 0.5 and the uh
112:23 - step size will be .01
112:26 - i have a memory of doing this very
112:27 - recently i don't know um
112:31 - so now uh and you can do this with
112:35 - anything it doesn't have to just be your
112:36 - video
112:37 - um and now um
112:40 - [Music]
112:43 - i need to say uh slider.value
112:47 - [Music]
112:49 - let's just make sure this works
112:51 - [Music]
112:53 - so now i have a slider and i can change
112:55 - that threshold which is going to be very
112:56 - very useful for me
112:58 - in terms of calibrating what i want it
112:59 - to look like
113:05 - okay but i need there's a lot more that
113:06 - i need to do this i'm going to use the
113:07 - marching squares algorithm i think
113:09 - that's going to
113:09 - really work with this we're going to see
113:12 - i could blur it and all sorts of things
113:13 - but i think i want to use the marching
113:14 - squares to get like some
113:16 - contour like cutting contours i think
113:19 - blob detection i could use i'm not
113:21 - really sure
113:23 - i'm go let's go with me here i do think
113:25 - it would be useful to know the threshold
113:27 - value that we like
113:29 - so i might also say let slider div
113:33 - um and let's do oh let's
113:37 - slide or span i'm not really sure
113:40 - slider div equals
113:44 - let's just actually create a span slider
113:48 - val let's just call it that
113:49 - slider val equals
113:52 - create span slider dot value and then
113:56 - always update it slider val
114:00 - html slider dot value
114:03 - so this is all p5 dom stuff and i guess
114:05 - i should move this over a little bit
114:08 - can i work with a bigger video will that
114:11 - fit because i think that would be nice
114:13 - let's do width
114:15 - and height although the video actually
114:17 - probably should be smaller and then i
114:18 - should
114:19 - stretch it up and now i don't have the
114:22 - slider of course see this is why i
114:23 - didn't want a bigger video
114:25 - let's go back to let's actually let's do
114:28 - this
114:28 - [Music]
114:30 - let's make that smaller and then stretch
114:33 - it
114:33 - larger because i want to have more
114:35 - pixels to work with when i have the
114:37 - algorithm okay this is perfect
114:38 - okay so now i can find
114:42 - and probably uploading an image would be
114:44 - better here
114:46 - you can find sort of like a good
114:48 - threshold
114:52 - angle i've been
114:55 - wearing this costume is really messing
114:57 - it up i love how the coding train
114:58 - here is like so perfectly uh thresholded
115:01 - that could be
115:02 - coding training like making a coding
115:04 - train like logo design
115:06 - you could use the same sort of technique
115:08 - um but
115:09 - i thought what i would try to do here is
115:12 - go and get the marching squares code
115:17 - because this might make it much more
115:19 - oops much more contoury
115:23 - um and so what if i get
115:26 - there's a bunch of different oh image i
115:29 - actually already did this i
115:30 - forgot so great this is pro webcam i did
115:33 - it with webcam already
115:35 - oh interesting so let's i forgot that i
115:36 - made these versions of it
115:38 - uh let's just see what we get here
115:42 - yeah so i'm kind of imagining that
115:47 - that this is going to work so
115:50 - let's interesting
115:54 - so what am i doing here in this i have a
115:56 - draw line
115:58 - i have a threshold value i'm
116:01 - setting the pixels drawing oh that's
116:03 - just drawing it and then
116:05 - boy based on this threshold
116:09 - of the field is are the pixels
116:13 - i'm so confused the field is the
116:17 - brightness
116:18 - of the pixel which is easier for me to
116:20 - do once i'm thresholding it
116:22 - so let's grab this
116:27 - so maybe i don't know if the marching
116:28 - squares is going to help me here
116:30 - but i'm grabbing the marching squares
116:34 - i'm going to let's leave this fire
116:36 - effect one
116:37 - [Music]
116:39 - i'm going to here
116:43 - no this is the number blood dripping one
116:45 - how come i can't find what i'm doing
116:47 - now here we go so let's create the
116:49 - marching squares field
116:50 - the resolution i'm going to weigh way
116:52 - lower because i think that's going to be
116:54 - needed for
116:55 - getting the sort of contours effectively
116:57 - and i might need to like
116:58 - also blur the image then i need to
117:02 - create i guess this is creating the 2d
117:05 - array um
117:08 - so let's that's going to happen in setup
117:10 - that's the sort of
117:12 - field of numbers for the marching
117:13 - squares
117:16 - um then i need this draw line function
117:19 - [Music]
117:22 - and obviously you'll need to watch the
117:24 - marching squares video to see what's
117:26 - going on here now
117:27 - this is what's different um
117:31 - if i go whoops
117:33 - [Music]
117:35 - if i go through here to set the field
117:39 - this is where i can do something
117:40 - different
117:42 - so hmm
117:46 - in draw
117:51 - i'm loading pixels but i want to load
117:54 - the
117:54 - pixels from sure this is fine
117:58 - let's let's just use the canvas as is
118:02 - after drawing the image and filtering
118:04 - okay
118:06 - going through the columns and rows times
118:10 - the resolution this is fine
118:14 - uh spooky john pearson thank you
118:18 - spooky variable name and methods names
118:21 - today
118:22 - that's a good idea spook i'll try to
118:24 - incorporate that i love that idea
118:27 - um so i don't this i don't need to do
118:31 - i can just pull out the red value of the
118:35 - pixel because i've thresholded it
118:37 - [Music]
118:43 - and i need to work with the video with
118:46 - so this is going to be important in a
118:47 - little
118:48 - bit uh the video let's let me go back to
118:52 - having them be the same
118:53 - size because then i can go back to
118:56 - differentiating that
118:58 - uh get the just get the brightness
119:02 - is the
119:05 - pixels at that index value
119:09 - uh times four right
119:13 - and i'm drawing a rectangle that's fine
119:15 - let's do that
119:16 - let's just sort of see what happens here
119:20 - okay so this is this is thresh holding
119:23 - it
119:24 - and then putting the lower resolution
119:26 - squares but i got a weird error
119:28 - brightness was expecting oh i don't need
119:30 - this
119:32 - [Music]
119:38 - okay great so this is
119:41 - uh sort of lowering the resolution so i
119:44 - could do the contours
119:48 - and then and then if um
119:53 - i go to here this should draw the
119:55 - marching squares
119:59 - where's the yeah oh yeah
120:03 - i don't maybe i didn't need the marching
120:05 - squares but i really think that i do
120:07 - [Music]
120:09 - uh and draw a line let's make it red
120:11 - right now
120:16 - just to sort of see what did i get wrong
120:18 - here
120:20 - um get state is not defined
120:23 - so i there's a get state
120:26 - [Music]
120:27 - function ah here we go
120:33 - that i need
120:34 - [Music]
120:38 - okay so it's drawing the i'm imagining
120:40 - these to be the cut lines
120:42 - but obviously i don't see anything at
120:45 - all
120:45 - resembling my form
120:50 - can i make why this thought this sounded
120:52 - like a good idea at the time
120:54 - so i definitely need higher resolution
120:57 - so
120:58 - i want this to be 640 by 480
121:02 - um which means which is fine
121:05 - because the v because what i'm actually
121:08 - analyzing
121:10 - are the pixels of the filtering that's
121:12 - great then i want the resolution
121:14 - to be like 10. let's just see what i get
121:17 - here
121:20 - yeah but it looks
121:24 - weird oh and something is way off yeah
121:26 - because i'm looking at the video pixels
121:29 - which don't yeah no kidding
121:33 - okay okay quiet down over there
121:37 - um we're at noon o'clock people what's
121:40 - what's not matched pixels of the index
121:45 - which is ah
121:48 - this there we go
121:51 - [Music]
121:54 - okay better
121:58 - but okay now i can play with the
122:02 - threshold
122:04 - and uh let's
122:07 - so i actually don't want to draw these
122:08 - rectangles that sort of defeats the
122:10 - purpose of what i'm doing
122:11 - [Music]
122:14 - i also want to be very close
122:19 - and i think that i want to blur the
122:22 - image
122:23 - [Music]
122:26 - sort of weird idea here to make myself
122:29 - sort of more ghost-like
122:31 - which might sort of blur things
122:40 - uh that didn't work zero don't put a
122:43 - zero there
122:50 - that was a bad idea uh hold on hold on
122:52 - yeah i can't do that i need a separate
122:54 - canvas
122:55 - if i'm gonna do that filter
122:59 - blur let's just try this and this it's
123:01 - going to make it run
123:02 - super slow but in a way i only need to
123:05 - do a snapshot yeah there we go
123:09 - now the question is okay so first of all
123:12 - my
123:12 - outfit here in the double glasses
123:16 - and wearing this like cape thing and the
123:19 - hat
123:19 - oh my hair is a mess
123:28 - uh and i could play with the threshold
123:38 - well this idea kind of failed
123:43 - but at least what i want to show you is
123:45 - um
123:46 - [Music]
123:51 - it's very slow because of the blur but i
123:53 - kind of what i wanted to do here
123:56 - is say background
124:00 - 255. i don't want to actually see that
124:03 - and then have this be stroke
124:05 - 0 just wanted to see it like this but
124:22 - well
124:24 - this is like such a failure
124:27 - i thought even with the green screen
124:29 - this would work so well
124:31 - um let's see thresholding
124:36 - what anybody have any i mean there is
124:38 - something here to this
124:41 - like that is kind of
124:44 - me but i'm not high contra obviously
124:47 - what the threshold is
124:50 - you know i should probably make use of
124:51 - the fact that there's a green screen
124:53 - and have that uh
125:00 - yeah uh all right blood dripping now
125:03 - from this
125:04 - this is kind of interesting i want to
125:06 - take the blur out just because it's
125:07 - really slowing it down
125:09 - and i probably should like when i have
125:11 - when i want to just save it
125:12 - yeah i mean because this because also
125:16 - why not just make the resolution much
125:18 - much lower
125:22 - yeah oh there we go now i'm getting
125:25 - somewhere i just need to make the
125:26 - resolution lower
125:28 - i mean i need to do blob detection and
125:31 - then like filter out these
125:33 - like lower ones that's what the tiny
125:35 - ones the noise that's what i thought
125:36 - blurring would do
125:38 - what if i have an idea
125:42 - what if when i hit mouse pressed uh
125:46 - render equals false i set
125:49 - render equal to true and then
125:55 - if render
125:57 - [Music]
125:58 - run the blur
126:03 - and then at the end
126:06 - [Music]
126:07 - if render
126:08 - [Music]
126:10 - save frame jack
126:15 - lantern
126:17 - [Music]
126:18 - it'll save it with a number dot png
126:23 - and then render is false so basically
126:26 - i'm able to operate this
126:27 - super fast um but when i rent when i
126:31 - click the mouse it'll render it with the
126:33 - blur on so let's see
126:34 - how low can i get this resolution with
126:36 - it being
126:38 - quite speedy like it is
126:45 - like at what point yeah so i think four
126:48 - was a good number
126:50 - and i should get the i should get the
126:52 - interpolation code in here
126:54 - that's also going to make it better let
126:56 - me grab that interpolation code
127:03 - [Music]
127:05 - marching squares metaballs interpolation
127:10 - open simplex interpolation it doesn't
127:11 - really matter let's grab this one
127:14 - so the interpolation i think was just
127:18 - a change
127:23 - [Music]
127:24 - here
127:26 - [Music]
127:28 - oh i think oh this is a little scary
127:34 - right i think the interpolation code
127:39 - which smooths out the contours is
127:42 - just this particular loop
127:46 - so i think let me hit save and let me go
127:50 - back to
127:52 - this loop here i think all i need to do
127:55 - is paste in this version of it
127:59 - shoot
128:03 - uh do i need another curly bracket here
128:08 - think so
128:14 - oh is it gonna make it run super slow
128:19 - oh i did something bad use a sobo filter
128:26 - okay did i save it with the
128:30 - uh yeah yeah hold on so let's go back to
128:33 - like a high
128:34 - what did i do columns
128:41 - maybe just all the extra math for the
128:48 - interpolation
128:50 - oh the threshold
128:55 - that's weird is this the interpolation
128:58 - let's make sure the interpolation one is
128:59 - working
129:01 - yeah this is what i was looking to add
129:03 - to it this is the interpolation
129:09 - um
129:12 - threshold equals one
129:15 - oh was the threshold oh the threshold
129:16 - being one why did i have that ah
129:21 - what's going on people why is
129:25 - why is the threshold one
129:32 - oh oh because it it calculates it
129:35 - i'm so lost
129:39 - is this what i pasted in
129:44 - no i didn't get the interpol oh no this
129:46 - is the non-interpolation
129:50 - okay i'm back
129:51 - [Music]
129:53 - let's make the i just want it i i i this
129:55 - was
129:56 - this is possibly unnecessary but let's
129:58 - make it like let's lower that resolution
130:01 - it should be super fast now okay i just
130:03 - want to add and
130:04 - try adding the interpolation in which
130:07 - should be
130:08 - just a matter of replacing
130:12 - this with all the lurpy stuff
130:18 - i don't know why that's crashing that is
130:21 - very disturbing
130:23 - uh that it like that my example with
130:27 - i just feel like the smoothing it out
130:28 - will be nice
130:30 - and if i could just get that to work i
130:33 - could put my hat back on so you don't
130:35 - experience my hat head
130:36 - oh look at interpolation get state code
130:39 - that changes also
130:45 - no it's the same
130:46 - [Music]
130:50 - it's just this loop let's see
130:57 - [Music]
131:02 - it's hard for me to tell because
131:05 - it's so it doesn't seem like it worked
131:08 - correctly
131:14 - oh i'm assuming the values
131:18 - in field are between zero and one
131:22 - i think no
131:26 - i guess i should give up on the
131:27 - interpolation
131:31 - i should probably give up on the
131:32 - interpolation right
131:35 - because it doesn't seem to translate
131:39 - here i had two it
131:43 - so weird though what is
131:47 - did i change the way i'm getting the
131:48 - field of numbers
131:52 - oh i normalize no no that's just for the
131:56 - bubbles
131:59 - oh this one's using distance
132:02 - oh wait wait wait no wonder this is like
132:05 - a kind of a different example
132:07 - let's go to this one this is what i want
132:15 - this this is what i want
132:22 - all right this is the one this is more
132:26 - analogous to what i'm doing
132:29 - so let's try this one
132:34 - and i think the values in the noise are
132:36 - between negative one and one
132:39 - so i might have to change something
132:45 - uh this was getting get
132:48 - state which is the same
132:55 - ceiling field ah because it's either a
132:57 - zero or a one
132:59 - so what i want to do is round it
133:03 - i want to round it in mine i think
133:06 - so instead of ceiling i think i want to
133:10 - round it
133:13 - oh but not here
133:17 - i think this is going to work
133:22 - [Music]
133:24 - where does it do that
133:28 - huh did i did i not paste it into the
133:30 - right place
133:31 - yes i did not i pasted it into the wrong
133:34 - place oh i'm doing
133:35 - this is so hard no
133:39 - come back yes this one
133:42 - this loop uh this is like the longest
133:44 - bit of code to copy paste which is
133:46 - making this very difficult
133:48 - goes here and then i want to change this
133:51 - to round
134:02 - i give up
134:05 - [Music]
134:09 - this should give me uh no it's always
134:11 - going to do a float in javascript
134:16 - no one's telling me what i'm doing wrong
134:17 - here
134:23 - try changing the res back again all
134:25 - right
134:28 - [Music]
134:34 - try changing the res back again 12.
134:44 - yeah it's i don't see the interpolation
134:46 - happening
134:47 - it does the draw line function different
134:50 - no right
134:53 - [Music]
135:00 - so by the way as i make the resolution
135:02 - lower and lower the interpolation is
135:03 - less meaningful
135:04 - so i think i'm gonna get go i'm just
135:07 - gonna go back
135:08 - to what i had let's refresh this page
135:15 - oh whoops i'm in here
135:28 - i hope i don't lose my code i'm doing
135:30 - the worst job oh boy
135:32 - [Music]
135:35 - you're out there all twice no it's
135:36 - telling me what i'm doing wrong because
135:38 - you're twice
135:38 - uh this was a a bad digression and it's
135:41 - 12 15. i'm going to give up on it
135:43 - it's so not important let me just go
135:46 - to i'm let me go to view code which is
135:48 - easier than working with the web editor
135:50 - to copy paste
135:51 - and let me just get the regular
135:53 - non-interpolated one back
135:55 - [Music]
135:57 - because that was fine
136:00 - i didn't need to change it
136:03 - and let me go back to
136:06 - the resolution is four everything's
136:08 - going to be fine
136:13 - [Music]
136:14 - oh i forgot that i did the b divided by
136:17 - 255
136:19 - [Music]
136:22 - there we go okay this is what we're
136:24 - working with people i don't need to
136:26 - interpolate because i've got like a
136:27 - really sort of high resolution image
136:29 - so let me try to get
136:33 - my face oh whoops
136:36 - so i need a button i definitely need a
136:38 - button
136:43 - uh let's create about save button equals
136:46 - create
136:46 - button
136:47 - [Music]
136:50 - render
136:53 - and then save button mouse pressed
136:59 - um and let's just put an anonymous
137:00 - function in here
137:02 - that says a render equals true
137:05 - [Music]
137:08 - so instead of this global mouse press
137:11 - only when i press the button
137:13 - because i i need to press the mouse to
137:15 - move the slider
137:16 - okay so um i can play with the threshold
137:22 - [Music]
137:24 - i don't know what looks the most like me
137:29 - let's see what i'm saying press render
137:31 - okay i got an error
137:33 - [Music]
137:34 - save frame is not defined i guess that's
137:36 - processing speak
137:42 - uh i should just make it a random number
137:45 - let's just do
137:46 - let's just let's just call it
137:47 - jack-o-lantern.png for right now
137:56 - try this
138:01 - all right let's take a look at what this
138:03 - image looks like is it better
138:05 - well it's different there
138:09 - carve this into your jack-o-lantern
138:15 - edge detection and marching squares
138:19 - well i think if i had a cleaner image
138:25 - so one thing that we could do with this
138:28 - is for example
138:31 - um let's instead of let's let's do this
138:34 - so for example let's grab a coding train
138:36 - character speaking of which
138:38 - where we were on the uh faq
138:40 - [Music]
138:42 - let's go to uh the
138:46 - coding train things let's download
138:49 - characters emoji size
138:53 - uh 320 by 320 like for example let's say
138:57 - we want to carve
138:58 - this character into the pumpkin okay now
139:01 - first of all just printing this out
139:02 - would probably be enough
139:04 - because you can trace the contours but
139:07 - let's just try it with my methodology
139:09 - uh download
139:11 - [Music]
139:14 - and let's
139:17 - now go to here where where am i
139:23 - close this is not what i'm looking at
139:25 - this is not what i'm looking at
139:27 - here so let us do
139:30 - a um let's create
139:34 - um
139:38 - let's create a file input
139:41 - [Music]
139:44 - i think it's create file input is that
139:46 - right
139:48 - yeah so i'm going to add something that
139:49 - i could choose a file
139:51 - and then there's like a callback here
139:54 - like got file
140:03 - let's see what i get i forget how this
140:04 - works so i'm rather than look at the
140:06 - documentation
140:07 - i'll just figure it out so if i go to
140:09 - choose file
140:10 - and downloads and i get this character
140:13 - i get file
140:17 - it's of type image and oh i get the i
140:20 - get the data the pixels are the image
140:21 - and something called data perfect
140:23 - so um
140:27 - and then i can replace the video
140:33 - let's do let image
140:35 - [Music]
140:37 - so if
140:43 - if image draw the image
140:50 - else draw the video
140:54 - so if i'm going to make it so that if i
140:56 - upload an image
140:57 - it's going to draw that instead
141:00 - and so now in the got file function
141:04 - i should be able to say like if
141:08 - image dot let me just look at it over
141:11 - here
141:11 - [Music]
141:16 - i guess i'll look at it here if
141:17 - image.type yeah
141:19 - if image dot type equals oh if data
141:23 - i guess like file if file.type
141:28 - is image
141:31 - [Music]
141:34 - oh i gotta show some community
141:35 - contributions
141:37 - if file.type is image
141:41 - then uh image equals create
141:46 - image image.data a file.data
141:52 - let's just see how this works
141:54 - [Music]
141:57 - so choose the file now try this
141:59 - character
142:01 - oh whoa
142:03 - [Laughter]
142:06 - what is going on insanity
142:11 - i think there's a lot of noise in that
142:12 - png
142:15 - but look at this you've got the contours
142:17 - now oh i really want the interpolation
142:20 - to work somebody will fix that this
142:22 - actually is very halloween like
142:25 - wait why did it do this
142:30 - oh because of the blur no i'm not
142:31 - blurring okay well let's
142:33 - let's play with the threshold here
142:38 - there's some kind of noise in the
142:40 - background
142:42 - is it from stretching it like i don't
142:44 - understand this at all
142:45 - the png has transparency that must be it
142:49 - right
142:51 - it must be that the png no but the video
142:54 - is not being oh the video
142:56 - the png has tran i got it
143:01 - i don't know if i need a white
143:02 - background or a black background
143:05 - but there we go
143:10 - because i'm operating off the pixels of
143:12 - the image i'm drawing so there we go
143:14 - now why did i get create image was
143:17 - expecting to oh right
143:19 - so it needs a um when you create an
143:21 - image it always should have an alt
143:23 - uh text tab so like i'm just going to
143:25 - call it like
143:26 - uploaded file from a user
143:32 - to get rid of that message uh for
143:35 - accessibility purposes
143:36 - no data is not defined
143:40 - where line 42 oh yeah i don't need this
143:44 - okay great so now there any image
143:48 - and i can play with the thresholding
143:52 - so i can take any image so for example
143:55 - and i don't know why i can't get the
143:57 - interpolation to work so that it's not
143:58 - so
143:59 - so that it's smooth but somebody will
144:01 - help me with that
144:03 - uh so let's grab let's just say um
144:07 - let's try like googling my image
144:12 - and maybe like if i take this
144:18 - uh
144:18 - [Music]
144:23 - uh let's take this
144:27 - and then now let's go back to here
144:32 - and we choose another file
144:37 - oh did i put that on the desktop
144:40 - no where did i save that does anybody
144:42 - remember
144:44 - [Music]
144:45 - save image as who knows where i put it
144:50 - desktop downloads
144:59 - [Music]
145:00 - let's try this there we go see we're
145:03 - getting somewhere
145:05 - so now i can play with the threshold
145:08 - uh and then oh i feel like this looks
145:10 - like a bit more
145:12 - and if i had a much more thoughtfully
145:13 - lit photo of myself
145:16 - like there we go now
145:19 - and now i can hit save render
145:25 - and let's see what i get
145:28 - so i probably
145:33 - i guess maybe i want to put the blur the
145:36 - blur option
145:37 - i might want to take out now i want the
145:39 - interpolation and the blur working
145:41 - this why do i have that tom scott folder
145:43 - i will get to that
145:45 - so uh great so this works
145:48 - i'm gonna put this in the discord uh
145:51 - this is as far as i'm gonna get with
145:52 - this people can improve upon it
145:55 - and i might try to get something um let
145:58 - me go back to
145:59 - the um links
146:03 - i guess is this the same sketch i'm not
146:05 - sure um
146:06 - in the discord i'm putting this here
146:09 - so this is the sketch right now oh and
146:11 - you don't see me this is the sketch
146:13 - right over here that i'm working with so
146:16 - you can grab the code from there
146:18 - and you'd see by the way it shows the
146:19 - images down here that i'm uploading
146:21 - um or i could have a much better
146:23 - interface to this but you could imagine
146:25 - how
146:26 - this could help you create something
146:28 - that you could then print
146:30 - and then tape onto your pumpkin and draw
146:32 - around
146:33 - now there's got to be a better image of
146:35 - me i'm actually doesn't need to be me
146:38 - uh coding train
146:39 - [Music]
146:43 - like i could try any number of these
146:44 - things images i could design
146:47 - something i could try this like let's
146:50 - let's use this
146:51 - oh i don't know what uh so like if i
146:54 - took this save image as
146:57 - uh coding train
146:59 - [Music]
147:01 - and it's going to stretch it weirdly
147:03 - because i'm not taking into account the
147:05 - resolution
147:06 - but let's choose the file let's go to
147:08 - this one
147:10 - and then
147:15 - you know
147:22 - kind of like this there we go uh
147:25 - anyway i could make this much higher
147:27 - resolution i could make this in
147:28 - processing
147:28 - but this now i feel like this is sort of
147:30 - carvable right
147:32 - this is carvable though there's a lot of
147:35 - weird like i don't know how you would
147:36 - carve
147:39 - this but you could you know you could
147:42 - sort of see
147:42 - some of these enclosed you could carve
147:44 - this out
147:46 - and then go oh i don't know i don't
147:49 - understand how you carve this
147:51 - because there's actually like enclosed
147:54 - shape issues
147:55 - oh well well well well
147:59 - close enough thanks everyone
148:05 - [Music]
148:09 - now before i go from this
148:13 - spooky coding train which it's now 12 30
148:17 - i've really got to go
148:18 - it's really i really should it's time
148:21 - for me to look at
148:22 - at least one or two community
148:26 - contributions
148:28 - from you the viewer of
148:31 - the viewers of the coding trade
148:34 - usually i do this at the beginning you
148:37 - are what makes
148:38 - you you are the energy that powers the
148:41 - coding trade
148:42 - and i would love to feature some of your
148:44 - work um
148:46 - and the way that i go and do that but by
148:48 - the way
148:51 - if you get any of what i'm doing today
148:53 - working better
148:54 - and the idea here was that i would get
148:56 - like the blood dripping number
148:58 - and then get the contours and then that
149:01 - i would use to carve a pumpkin
149:03 - there's pumpkin carving is starting in
149:05 - two minutes in this house and i gotta go
149:06 - down and participate
149:08 - in that but um if you want to help give
149:10 - me hey carve your own pumpkin and share
149:12 - it with me
149:13 - but uh if you want to help clean up my
149:14 - code and make it a little better
149:16 - and give me a pumpkin design i will
149:18 - carve it on a pumpkin
149:19 - it might be a small pumpkin because i
149:21 - don't have a lot pumpkins
149:23 - but i will carve it using this
149:27 - pumpkin carving kit so uh but before i
149:30 - go i i've gotta show some community
149:32 - contributions
149:34 - so let's go and find the wheel
149:38 - here is our wheel of community
149:40 - contributions um by the way thank you to
149:43 - um there is a viewer i don't know if
149:46 - you're watching please shout yourself
149:48 - out if you're watching who created an
149:49 - api
149:50 - to grab random coding train
149:52 - contributions from the website i don't
149:53 - believe that this is using that yet
149:55 - but i would like it to be let's spin
149:57 - this wheel
150:01 - and what are we going to get
150:04 - ray casting game with maze generation
150:09 - uh this is from grilli 86
150:12 - the original coding challenge is
150:13 - rendering ray casting
150:15 - which you could uh take a look at it's
150:18 - this coding challenge
150:19 - which sort of like in all using just
150:22 - total 2d rendering techniques to create
150:25 - a sort of old style raycasting
150:27 - c um system that then generates this
150:30 - 3d ish scene and let's look at
150:33 - oh and i have another coding challenge
150:34 - that's maze generation so this is
150:36 - combining them oh my god i'm so excited
150:38 - about this
150:40 - wow this is wild okay wait wait wait
150:42 - wait oh and i don't see the maze
150:43 - what are what's my what do i have to
150:46 - press oh i
150:47 - turn i need to find oh i can walk this
150:51 - way
150:51 - oh my god this isn't insane
150:54 - and so cool and i'm walking through the
150:58 - maze i love this
151:01 - so much
151:05 - amazing job can i keep going let's get
151:07 - to the end of the maze
151:09 - wow what a cool uh combination of these
151:12 - two
151:13 - examples i'm
151:16 - lost
151:19 - no i think i got to it where do i go
151:23 - what did i miss can i go further this
151:26 - way
151:27 - no oh but i can go this way oh that's a
151:30 - dead end too i've already tried this
151:32 - by the way is this like there's a secret
151:34 - command i think for like revealing the
151:36 - maze i seen remember looking at this
151:37 - before
151:39 - but i guess i gotta turn around
151:46 - this is a spooky maze for sure
151:59 - no this way i must find the end
152:04 - of this maze i must get out of here i'm
152:07 - trapped
152:09 - i'm trapped although there's there's
152:12 - another way
152:12 - there's another way
152:18 - i have found another way i'm going to go
152:20 - all the way to the end here
152:22 - could this be the way
152:24 - [Music]
152:27 - no i've hit a dead end i think
152:38 - [Music]
152:48 - i would like by the way for this circle
152:51 - to be a shape that when i rotate i see
152:53 - which way it's pointing or for the rays
152:55 - to be
152:56 - a more distinct higher color contrast
152:58 - that would really help me
153:01 - i think this is the way
153:05 - this is the way i have spoken
153:10 - the maze has spoken
153:11 - [Music]
153:17 - let's try it this way
153:20 - [Music]
153:32 - no
153:36 - [Music]
153:38 - what did i miss
153:42 - was it all the way back at the beginning
153:46 - is this another way to go
153:51 - [Music]
153:54 - and so everybody was tuned in like
153:58 - four hours later but i was still trying
154:01 - to get through this spooky maze
154:04 - spooky maze spooky
154:14 - this way no that's the beginning
154:18 - which way am i which way am i looking i
154:20 - can't tell
154:30 - [Music]
154:42 - wait no this isn't that
154:45 - where do i go where do i go
154:48 - where do i go
154:52 - where do i go is that away no that's
154:56 - down
154:57 - up to the right that's a wall
155:01 - what did i miss oh is it here
155:05 - is this a path is that the path
155:07 - [Music]
155:09 - this is terrifying and so we looked at
155:12 - one no this is the second community
155:13 - contribution
155:20 - oh god i gotta backtrack
155:23 - [Music]
155:24 - now
155:27 - [Music]
155:30 - why why do you keep zooming out
155:32 - [Music]
155:36 - where do i go
155:40 - this way boy i really did i get unlucky
155:42 - here am i just really bad at mazes
155:54 - is it a straight shot from here is it
155:57 - just straight down this corridor
155:58 - is not really what it is
156:12 - [Applause]
156:14 - [Music]
156:20 - oh
156:24 - [Music]
156:56 - count random number has won the maze
157:00 - challenge oh it gave me another one
157:07 - [Music]
157:09 - that was amazing what a terrific
157:12 - community contribution let's look at one
157:16 - more
157:19 - [Music]
157:30 - today on the coding train
157:34 - we will be traveling to
157:37 - the fourth dimension
157:46 - we travel to the fourth dimension
157:49 - david snyder spookily
157:53 - has created a hyper cube based on the
157:57 - hypercube coding challenge
158:00 - have a look
158:07 - this is a fitting way to end
158:15 - [Music]
158:19 - where's my my blair witch
158:23 - uh simulation
158:27 - all right this is great i like to see
158:29 - this hypercube render this looks like
158:30 - it's
158:31 - being rendered actually in um with a 3d
158:34 - renderer i guess that's is that how i
158:35 - did it i can't even remember what i did
158:38 - but i love the hypercube as like and
158:40 - there's a really amazing um
158:42 - [Music]
158:44 - um video about hyper cubes that's not my
158:46 - video but
158:47 - from the the leo s uh youtube channel
158:51 - and i'm sure i referenced in my
158:52 - challenge
158:53 - and my uh video it's amazing
158:56 - um all right i was looking for my um
159:01 - phone which i don't know where i put it
159:03 - oh here it is which i can now connect
159:06 - to say goodbye um let's see if i can
159:10 - do this i just i'm so excited by the
159:12 - fact that i now have the ability
159:15 - to and hold on i'm waiting for it to
159:18 - connect
159:20 - connecting to your computer over wi-fi
159:23 - it has connected
159:25 - and now if i go here we can see there we
159:28 - are
159:28 - all right everybody i think this is how
159:31 - i will finish things out
159:32 - um by talking to the camera here um
159:36 - make it stop yeah i made it stop um and
159:39 - so
159:40 - simon wants me to remind you i mean this
159:42 - was an idea that i
159:44 - no it's not an idea that i had but let's
159:46 - see if we can figure out i wanted
159:47 - everybody
159:48 - to go from the coding train over to this
159:51 - 24-hour math
159:53 - stream um so uh
159:56 - i don't know why i'm doing this here
159:58 - let's just go back to this feed
160:00 - much more comfortable this way um i was
160:03 - not going to do my blair witch stick
160:04 - anymore so let me play my old timey
160:06 - goodbye music although you know really
160:08 - we should keep with the spooky theme
160:12 - so if you would
160:15 - [Music]
160:16 - please let's go find it uh how do i find
160:19 - the math
160:20 - magic 24 hour of stream
160:24 - here it is
160:28 - oh let's see let me go i'm going to
160:31 - oh is it over it says it's finished
160:34 - seven hours ago what i'm looking at
160:37 - part two oh there's a part two fourteen
160:40 - fifteen
160:40 - seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty
160:42 - twenty one so right now
160:45 - are you happy that's half the deck this
160:46 - is the stream of the day
160:48 - so there's a 169 people watching right
160:51 - now i'm going to
160:52 - paste this link into um
160:56 - the our discord and i encourage
160:59 - everybody as i say goodbye
161:01 - to head over to the uh
161:05 - 24-hour math magic show um say hello
161:08 - there from the coding train you can
161:09 - put so i don't don't interrupt i know
161:11 - there's a thing on twitch where people
161:12 - do these raids
161:13 - and they like all like flood the chat
161:15 - with like train emojis would be the
161:17 - thing but i think that might be
161:18 - interrupting their flow
161:19 - so just go over and say hi from the
161:21 - coding train i guess and then
161:22 - join um very join nicely
161:27 - stay tuned for my videos that are coming
161:30 - out on how to make a discord bot
161:32 - um check out the zoom annotation video
161:34 - if you haven't checked that out
161:35 - um also the convolutional neural network
161:37 - image classification video is coming out
161:39 - and um oh my battery on my
161:43 - uh soundboard which has to be plugged in
161:45 - died
161:46 - it could i'm gonna need to play some
161:48 - music as i leave so i'm gonna like put
161:50 - this cable across my lap
161:53 - into here so hopefully it'll come back
161:55 - alive
161:56 - i'm seeing if there's any questions and
161:58 - please
162:00 - if you are able to use anything i did
162:03 - today
162:04 - to carve a jack-o-lantern uh at shiffman
162:08 - on twitter
162:08 - share it in the discord i um anywhere
162:11 - let me know
162:12 - or if you just have the design that
162:14 - you've like came from a coding train
162:15 - coding challenge using some of the
162:17 - techniques i showed
162:18 - um send that to me very quickly because
162:20 - i'm
162:21 - now moving on to carving uh pumpkins
162:24 - uh once again with uh this uh you know
162:26 - i'm really really
162:27 - um talking this like uh pumpkin masters
162:30 - the number one selling brand
162:33 - uh who's not officially a sponsor but
162:34 - there is a sponsor today
162:36 - uh brilliant.org just a reminder to
162:38 - check out brilliant. brilliant.brilliant
162:40 - at bullying.org codingtrain uh brilliant
162:42 - also has an app which is pretty terrific
162:44 - that you can use as well
162:45 - all right um my soundboard is coming
162:48 - back to life
162:50 - um and so i'm going to say goodbye i'm
162:53 - looking to see if there's any chats
162:54 - have i heard of twitter it's amazing yes
162:58 - um that's a that's a way of like within
163:01 - a tweet like having a snippet of code
163:03 - then you render um that's super awesome
163:06 - stuff
163:07 - and i'm getting my soundboard back up
163:11 - low battery that's no problem and i
163:14 - think my favorite of all these
163:17 - was this one so i'm gonna just say
163:20 - goodbye with this music
163:21 - um head over to the 24 hour maths magic
163:24 - show
163:25 - um that i'm featuring right here i'm
163:27 - gonna head over there too as well to say
163:28 - hi in the chat
163:30 - and i'll see you all next
163:33 - next saturday vote if you haven't voted
163:37 - and you're
163:37 - if you're able to vote please vote
163:41 - um and i hope i'll be back next saturday
163:44 - i'm back every every saturday in the
163:46 - morning is live streams
163:48 - tutorial videos coming out during the
163:49 - week tutorial recording sessions happen
163:52 - on friday if you're thinking about
163:53 - joining as a member
163:54 - uh when you join you'll get to see some
163:56 - of those you'll be able to get previews
163:58 - of some of the videos and things and all
163:59 - that stuff
164:00 - uh more rows would be nice for a
164:02 - jack-o-lantern alright goodbye everybody
164:04 - [Music]
164:30 - so
164:35 - [Music]
167:33 - as always i always forget that this stop
167:35 - this stop it stop this stop i'm gonna do
167:37 - this stop this stop i'm gonna do this
167:39 - this stop this stop this stop i'm gonna
167:41 - do
167:41 - this stop stop i just stopped
167:50 - [Music]
168:14 - [Music]
168:37 - never forget this dot somebody composed
168:40 - that song for me
