00:00 - hello happy holiday is almost Happy New
00:02 - Year I'm standing here at ITP and ima in
00:05 - Brooklyn New York to School of the Arts
00:07 - and New York University were just a few
00:09 - days ago this whole floor was full of
00:13 - over a hundred projects student work
00:15 - from the ITP and ima programs on the
00:18 - fourth floor of 370 J Street and we
00:20 - looked at 91 projects you can see that
00:21 - full three and a half hour livestream
00:23 - by following the link in this video's
00:25 - description but what you're about to
00:27 - watch is a shorter highlight reel of a
00:29 - bunch of projects made by a wonderful
00:30 - group of students I hope you enjoy them
00:33 - I hope you have had a great 2019 and I
00:35 - look forward to seeing you on the coding
00:37 - train in 2020 good bye
00:39 - [Music]
00:51 - so I'm Aiden Fowler i'm nicole calvo
00:54 - quick sale and this is our lenticular
00:55 - portal room so we're doing experiments
00:57 - with the lenticular lens which is if
00:59 - you've seen bookmarks that have moving
01:00 - images that's what we're working with
01:02 - here and it stretches and magnifies the
01:04 - light so we're doing different
01:05 - experiments here we have a 3-dimensional
01:06 - box moving lenses that are rotating and
01:10 - then these flats on Sun rises over the
01:13 - ocean there's nothing in the box shall
01:15 - we do the reveal like what actually is
01:18 - inside it's an empty box but there's a
01:21 - thousand LEDs in here hi I'm Tina I'm
01:26 - Chris Kristina and this project is
01:29 - called one amongst many is a physical
01:31 - data visualization representing women in
01:33 - computing so you pick up these orbs they
01:37 - illuminate to full brightness and you
01:39 - can see every woman that we chose is in
01:43 - a cohort with a bunch of other women so
01:46 - we have computer scientists
01:47 - mathematicians as you picked an orb up
01:50 - and read about a certain woman other
01:52 - women in her cohort will also illuminate
01:54 - and as the orbs are interacted with over
01:58 - time they get incrementally brighter my
02:03 - name is Lulu and this is an installation
02:05 - that show everybody has a mountain on
02:08 - their original hand I have to tell the
02:11 - rock what is the shape of my hand and it
02:15 - will turns into a mountain which is my
02:17 - own mountain and I want everybody to
02:22 - have a nature connection when they see
02:24 - their Ridge of their hand
02:27 - hi I'm Winnie and so these are or from
02:31 - my data or class I'm from Hong Kong so I
02:33 - did a lot of projects about the protests
02:35 - and specifically focusing on the
02:37 - narratives I'm really interested in
02:39 - non-traditional approaches to protest
02:42 - and the focus of narrative is because I
02:44 - feel like our ability to craft our
02:46 - narrative
02:47 - that's really powerful and healing
02:49 - there's two projects about police and
02:52 - protesters and so I have these YouTube
02:56 - videos that I script that transcript
02:57 - from and I did these generator texts and
03:01 - also with the most common words I made
03:05 - these fridge magnets that people could
03:07 - interact with and then this piece here
03:10 - is all the protest informations I have
03:13 - consumed from September up until now so
03:16 - as you hover you could see the articles
03:19 - and the brighter the box is the more
03:22 - articles I have read in that hour of the
03:25 - day so my name is Tammy's and my project
03:29 - is basically a block puzzle game when
03:32 - you can build the correct sentence you
03:34 - have to use the brain blocks in this
03:36 - case this is basically like a learning
03:38 - tool for kids carrot Oh No say that
03:46 - right there
03:54 - I'm basically that's it
04:00 - [Music]
04:06 - I'm Andrea and so my project savvy our
04:08 - project and it uses VR to tell a poetic
04:12 - experience about kind of exploring
04:14 - flashbacks and what it means to have
04:16 - control of our own experiences and
04:18 - memory so that man that you see is
04:20 - supposed to represent trauma so the
04:22 - first time you go through this
04:23 - experience it's like you're going and
04:25 - walking around you may experience
04:26 - something horrific happen and now
04:28 - there's part of it's supposed to
04:29 - represent how memory will kind of try to
04:32 - understand that so in a memory if you've
04:34 - ever unfortunate experience something
04:35 - like bad happen you might replay that
04:38 - memory in your head over and over again
04:40 - and if he ever chooses to stop he can
04:43 - stop time and stop everyone from moving
04:45 - but he can never prevent what's gonna
04:47 - happen and so he is like looping this
04:49 - memory
04:53 - [Music]
05:06 - [Music]
05:15 - so it's really a struggle it's about
05:17 - patience actually finding where you need
05:19 - to be and then adjusting it for anyway
05:21 - go ahead a few hours on this and still
05:23 - try to figure I actually gave me to play
05:24 - this but I see some other people do some
05:26 - interesting things on this
05:27 - [Music]
05:50 - [Music]
05:57 - the dirt Rickman
05:59 - um this is web / wall it's
06:02 - my nine projects so we build our own
06:06 - instrument and then we perform with it
06:08 - like in urine
06:11 - dissident interesting chaotic sounds
06:16 - I'm sigh I'm the coding training
06:18 - community manager also a first-year ITP
06:21 - so this project is called the black
06:23 - projections project and basically I
06:26 - built what I call like a portal mapping
06:28 - device so it's like a math that
06:30 - potentially can help you on lappa portal
06:32 - and it kind of talks about or
06:34 - investigates space-time and how those
06:37 - are all connected to a lot of different
06:39 - moments that are happening and you
06:41 - basically explore it with a magnet you
06:43 - move across the points and then
06:45 - different images are projected on the
06:48 - screen my name is Ada and this is my
06:53 - project it's noise it's an audio enhance
06:57 - optical illusion the visual pattern is a
07:01 - vortex the center shifts depending on
07:03 - where you're looking at it so as the
07:05 - viewer moves around in space the
07:08 - triggers also triggers the audio changes
07:10 - in your headphone that corresponds to
07:12 - the direction of the moving center of
07:16 - the border my name is Rita and this
07:26 - project is in collaboration with Max mu
07:28 - Silva and it's kind of a
07:31 - choose-your-own-adventure color you can
07:33 - see if you put your headphones and you
07:36 - started by saying hi sailors
07:38 - and then it gives you a list of
07:39 - questions you can ask and you
07:41 - here a story that will change every time
07:43 - high sailors hi stranger you can ask us
07:47 - the following questions in any order and
07:49 - you can ask the same question more than
07:51 - once until we reach out destination who
07:54 - are you I am a sailor who will cross the
07:57 - ocean do get where I need to get and do
07:59 - what I need to do why did you leave I
08:03 - left because my father owned a dark
08:05 - mountain of anger where he wanted me to
08:06 - live
08:07 - I loved freedom more than I loved him
08:10 - hey so I'm Lachlan I'm a first year
08:13 - student here at ima and so I made a
08:15 - website called gun funded and it's a
08:17 - visualization of the gun lobby's funding
08:19 - of US Congress like where I'm from in
08:21 - Pennsylvania you can you can see the
08:24 - total and how the funding is
08:27 - disproportionately goes to Republican
08:31 - men in Congress and so you can go to
08:34 - anyone's profile you can share these you
08:37 - can see lists of top senators and
08:38 - representatives so that's gonna fund it
08:41 - and it's gun funder calm
08:43 - Jake Sherwood my project is called
08:46 - climate scape it's a kinetic art
08:49 - installation to raise awareness for
08:50 - climate change and the human effect on
08:52 - the climate it's representing for a
08:55 - future of potential climate change in
08:57 - there is going from best case to worst
08:59 - case so as you progress through the
09:00 - installation it gets more and more
09:01 - chaotic the best case kind of producing
09:04 - a more tranquil softer sound and then as
09:08 - you get through it gets more chaotic and
09:10 - become scary at the end my name is
09:14 - Alvaro la Couture
09:16 - I'm Nicole Genoa and our project is
09:19 - object tracking installation that tracks
09:23 - objects to control different types of
09:25 - animations in real time so we have these
09:27 - fears help with all of the animation
09:44 - position
09:45 - [Music]
09:55 - I'm an IDP second year and I have like
10:00 - installation which you don't waste on
10:03 - the best marriage so here as you can see
10:07 - there is a KGB equation which is away in
10:10 - a shallow water but it seems to be
10:13 - difficult but it can be also simulated
10:15 - by a very simple mathematics like like I
10:17 - said automata so it grows these across
10:20 - this bacon space so big wave grows
10:22 - faster quite a small wave goes slower
10:25 - it's similar to the real world smoke
10:29 - slowly my name is Jung and here thank ye
10:45 - creator of this project the idea of this
10:48 - project is to let people to interact
10:51 - what they are doing in the routine life
10:54 - and I didn't be aware of what they're
10:58 - doing because normally in some time
11:00 - people are like doing the same song
11:02 - Felicity so we made our parks which can
11:05 - reflect what people had to in do daily
11:07 - life so we said some of the interaction
11:10 - in the room in the real science room and
11:12 - every reaction due to in the room will
11:14 - be reflected in a small box so I'm
11:17 - Fernando and I'm creating this character
11:19 - called the Firebird and to embody the
11:22 - character image you put on the school
11:24 - office
11:25 - and imagining here at performing arts
11:27 - context so depending on the gestures you
11:29 - make you get like different a different
11:33 - sound and also you change the position
11:35 - of these 3d objects on the screen and
11:38 - you can like change the color of the
11:40 - object making different gestures related
11:43 - to the narrative I'm creating so you can
11:45 - make like fire and you get a red object
11:47 - or you can make like a tree and you get
11:50 - a green object and you can make like
11:52 - this and this is bird so you can fly you
11:56 - can embody the fire fire bird and fly
11:58 - around carrying this seat that is inside
12:02 - the land of the fire bird my name is
12:06 - Pippa Kalman sin' I worked on this
12:07 - project with Noah Curtis he also has a
12:10 - project we made a heart that beats the
12:13 - beat of your own pulse there's a monitor
12:15 - on the outside and there's a motor
12:17 - inside a elastic heart basically you
12:21 - just put your index finger on the pole
12:23 - sensor and then you can see your pulse
12:25 - beat in real time in a heart i'm julian
12:29 - matthews this is the hourglass so there
12:33 - is climate change related data
12:35 - correlated to visual on the sculpture so
12:39 - this is a statistic related to bees it
12:41 - the bee disappeared off the face of the
12:43 - earth humans would only have four years
12:44 - left to live there are some static ones
12:47 - another static one and then these
12:49 - require some user input this is meant to
12:51 - visualize rising sea levels so you can
12:54 - use a slider to demonstrate that this is
12:59 - the approximate cue of the Flint River
13:01 - water during peak crisis a little bit
13:04 - terrifying it this was coming out of
13:05 - people's faucets so these are two discs
13:07 - that are actually 3d printed
13:10 - [Music]
13:11 - once it slows down I attach neopixel
13:13 - strips on the outside and with this
13:15 - motor down here it allows me to spin it
13:18 - at 450 rotations per minute my name is
13:20 - Jen this is kind of like this instead
13:22 - okay no scope it's like detector at your
13:25 - distance so you like playing it it's
13:27 - like I've got a certain pattern
13:28 - according to it and then you get close
13:30 - to it you can like really control it by
13:32 - every centimeter see there's no
13:33 - projector just like no just like LED and
13:36 - tumorous and here la you can try to like
13:39 - we need you can throw it slowly hello my
13:52 - name is Matt Ross I'm a second year at
13:54 - ITP and I'm here today to talk to you
13:57 - about your relationship with your data
13:59 - if here today is a simple outlet but
14:02 - it's not just a simple outlet this
14:04 - outlet is connected directly to the
14:06 - servers at Google and what it does is it
14:09 - looks for any documents that you haven't
14:11 - even looked at in over two years so what
14:13 - you can do today is log in and it will
14:17 - find just one single file and if you're
14:20 - ready you can pull the plug and it'll
14:23 - delete just that single file and maybe
14:25 - just let me take a step towards having
14:28 - data in your life that really makes you
14:29 - feel good and then it's important to see
14:31 - it's retrieving all documents from a
14:33 - year and a half ago when I pulled this
14:35 - all of six seconds to change my mind
14:39 - see it's going gold and that's the whole
14:44 - process I'm down on a second here here
14:47 - at Nike feet and I work together with
14:48 - NASA developed a new team full of URL
14:52 - data where obviously you can see healthy
14:55 - data starts here it's just the p5 sketch
15:01 - asking me insert your phone into the
15:03 - container now all our goal today is
15:06 - basically to delete your or clear your
15:10 - browsing history so I'm gonna come here
15:12 - to this / l-lovely Pharrell and if you
15:14 - would take a look here my browsing
15:17 - history has been cleared I'm when I'm
15:22 - from Taiwan
15:22 - hi I'm KJ I'm from Korea yeah so this
15:26 - project's called Karim voices so this is
15:28 - basically a goddarn system that is based
15:31 - on word recognition so you can choose
15:33 - the word from the library we've built
15:35 - and say you to a microphone and see how
15:37 - he goes revolution
15:42 - yeah so this installation is about like
15:45 - the power of words because sometimes is
15:47 - - it's not visible so people just ignore
15:51 - it and want to enforce emphasize that
15:53 - this is so instructed I'm Stacy again I
15:57 - am money
15:59 - I'm kinship so this is a life vending
16:02 - machine we want to raise people surround
16:04 - yourself protecting animals
16:06 - how the indentured animals are feeling
16:09 - right now
16:09 - please insert the coin and start your
16:13 - journey so here you can see an animation
16:16 - the tiger is falling into the trap here
16:23 - you will get a product made by the tiger
16:26 - it's a leather coat I'm Skyler DeVos
16:29 - this is my project I called it liquid
16:31 - relationships and it's about connecting
16:34 - with other people I'm you know I'm the
16:53 - first year at ITP this is the
16:55 - interactive scroll so it's designed to
17:00 - allow someone to interact with an
17:02 - ancient scroll physically so you can use
17:08 - these rods to scroll through and then
17:11 - this allows you to translate my name is
17:16 - Noah and this project is called light
17:18 - it's about communication with physical
17:22 - separation
17:34 - [Music]
