00:05 - oh wait wait
00:23 - ah I think I might be there
00:40 - aha okay look that's me a few minutes
00:44 - ago whoa
00:48 - inception oh wow this is crazy now it's
00:54 - gonna be me pointing to me a few minutes
00:55 - ago should switch to the other camera
00:58 - for a second okay I'm over here I'm
00:59 - alive I don't know if anyone's watching
01:02 - yep can you hear me
01:14 - working now live on YouTube okay just
01:20 - posting this to Twitter okay um boy I'm
01:26 - on a delay so you're like seeing me way
01:29 - after me talking
01:32 - oops I left okay yeah okay closing this
01:43 - so I don't know how can I see if there's
01:47 - anybody here watching yes you can hear
01:53 - me that's great
01:59 - okay so I'm here I don't know if anyone
02:02 - I'm gonna record some videos I'm gonna
02:04 - minimize this boy it's quite a delay I
02:08 - should I definitely need to minimize the
02:12 - latency thing and on my list I've been
02:16 - making videos hold on
02:18 - over here I've been making videos I have
02:20 - a list over here and then the video that
02:24 - I intend to make right now is on the map
02:30 - function this thing that you're watching
02:33 - if you're watching is like the raw
02:35 - footage so I'm gonna make mistakes trip
02:38 - slobber do weird things by accident I've
02:42 - got a button here so I can switch over
02:43 - here now I'm in front of the code editor
02:46 - so what I'm doing is I'm getting ready
02:48 - so this is the example that I think I'm
02:50 - gonna make the video using and what I'm
02:52 - going to show is how to use the map
02:54 - function to have the background color
02:56 - change as the mouse moves left to right
03:00 - this is a particularly useful thing to
03:01 - do in programming graphics thingies so
03:06 - I'm gonna take a little water and I'm
03:12 - not I don't have the YouTube chat view
03:16 - up right now
03:17 - I could pull it up which will look weird
03:19 - because you're gonna see me looking at
03:21 - it watching now stats 5 watching now 5 5
03:27 - both people and what I'm gonna do is I'm
03:34 - gonna check the comments here and there
03:37 - you'll have feedback and that sort of
03:39 - thing ok look at this crazy like triple
03:43 - view thing okay so I'm gonna minimize
03:46 - that and I've got this again and about
03:50 - to start recording the actual thing
03:53 - let's see if this works okay I'm like
03:57 - lost my phone I was doing this on
03:59 - periscope yesterday which was kind of
04:01 - useful but I couldn't stream the actual
04:03 - full feed so I'm gonna stream the actual
04:06 - see you now okay here we go but-but-but
04:13 - the math function that's what this video
04:17 - is going to be about okay and three two
04:20 - one
04:22 - recording hi in this video I would like
04:29 - to look at something in p5.js called nap
04:34 - this is a function that is incredibly
04:37 - useful and it's a nice it's just a nice
04:40 - moment now if you're watching these
04:41 - videos in sequence but you don't need to
04:43 - because this video is really only about
04:44 - the map function but if you're watching
04:46 - them in sequence it's sort of a nice
04:47 - moment just figure it out too tough
04:48 - about variables I've got things stored
04:51 - in variables that are numbers and
04:52 - sometimes it's incredibly common that
04:55 - you have a number that comes in a given
04:58 - range the exact scenario that I'm gonna
05:01 - use here oh you know I forgot to turn
05:03 - the air conditioning truly messes with
05:05 - the sound you know there's this life
05:11 - going on you think I'm done making your
05:12 - video and nothing's ever gonna go wrong
05:14 - but life happens and this video is just
05:17 - always gonna have this weird moment
05:18 - where I turn the air conditioning off
05:19 - you know I'm just gonna start over it
05:23 - doesn't need to have that okay so I'm
05:26 - going to start over I'm going to erase
05:29 - this and come over here and I'm gonna
05:33 - hit stop I'm gonna see now that I'm
05:36 - taking a little posture I'm gonna check
05:37 - YouTube and there are three people
05:40 - watching so my retention it's really
05:42 - good what's up to five at up to three so
05:46 - basically I'm talking to myself except
05:48 - for the people who might actually be
05:49 - watching okay so now I am going to start
05:56 - over the thing is it's there's so much
06:00 - of a delay here by the time you see this
06:02 - I'm actually gonna have already started
06:04 - the video and I would like to see if
06:05 - people have comments you know as I stop
06:07 - and start so there's a setting in the
06:09 - YouTube stream where it like optimized
06:11 - for low latency which is clearly
06:13 - something I'm gonna have to do the next
06:14 - time I turn
06:15 - on okay now I need to start over
06:25 - hi so this video is about something in
06:28 - p5 yes and that something is the NAP
06:32 - function so a couple things one is if
06:38 - you've been watching these videos in
06:39 - sequence but you don't necessarily need
06:41 - to have been doing because this video is
06:43 - just about one singular thing but this
06:45 - is kind of a good time just learn about
06:47 - variables got a whole lot of numbers
06:49 - flipping around your code to kind of get
06:52 - that stuff under control and figure out
06:53 - a kind of a useful thing a very common
06:55 - thing scenario that comes up so the map
06:57 - function is going to solve a particular
06:58 - problem that I'm gonna demonstrate in a
07:00 - moment but before I even get to that
07:02 - what am I even talking about the NAP
07:04 - function what did this that the other I
07:13 - think I think I got high so this video
07:22 - that I'm making is about a function in
07:25 - p5.js called map so there's a very
07:30 - common scenario that comes up over and
07:33 - over and over again in programming
07:36 - graphics programming interaction working
07:39 - with data there's so many places that
07:41 - this scenario comes up comes up and so
07:43 - this particular function map is a nice
07:47 - resolution to this problem and let me
07:49 - give you a simple version of this
07:51 - problem so let's say we have a canvas
07:55 - and the canvas has a background color
08:00 - and what you want is for that background
08:04 - color to sometimes be black and
08:07 - sometimes be white so when it's black
08:11 - the color that you should put in the
08:14 - background function is zero when it is
08:21 - white the color you should put in the
08:23 - background function is 255 so we can say
08:27 - to
08:28 - the range for the background function
08:31 - that I want in this particular program
08:33 - is a number between 0 and 255 so really
08:37 - a variable might go here like call it co
08:40 - l and co l should have a range between 0
08:44 - and 255 now how do I want that value to
08:47 - be chosen when should it be black and
08:49 - when should it be white what I would
08:51 - like is when the mouse pointer is at
08:54 - this side of the screen I want the
08:56 - background to be black and when the
08:58 - mouse pointer is at this side of the
08:59 - screen I want the background to be white
09:02 - so I would like to create a scenario
09:04 - where I move the mouse left and right
09:07 - left and right and I see the background
09:08 - shift from black all the way to Y down
09:11 - to gray darker gray down to black etc so
09:15 - this is what we want to program now
09:18 - let's say this canvas has dimensions of
09:21 - 600 by 400
09:24 - so mouse X is a variable if you've been
09:27 - watching these videos in sequence which
09:28 - you don't need to have been to watch
09:30 - this particular video mouse X is so sort
09:32 - of recent new phenomenon that I just
09:35 - talked about in a previous video so if
09:38 - the these are the dimensions of the
09:40 - canvas we know that Mouse X has a range
09:42 - that goes between 0 and 600 so we now
09:48 - want the background color to have a rate
09:53 - of sorry we want to lost my train of
09:56 - thought there
09:56 - so the house has a range between 0 and
09:58 - 600 and the background color we want to
10:00 - have a range between 0 and 255 so we
10:03 - need to take this value with this range
10:06 - and what we want to do map it to this
10:10 - range when Mouse x equals 0 background
10:13 - color equals 0 when mouse x equals 600
10:16 - background color equals 255 let's kind
10:18 - of like start doing that a little bit
10:20 - for a moment without the map function at
10:22 - all okay so here's the program I'm going
10:26 - to actually simplify this for a second
10:29 - var color equals 0 I'm gonna say
10:33 - background color and
10:36 - you can see this so we could see here
10:37 - here I'm running this program this
10:39 - ellipse is being drawn where the mouse
10:41 - is so we can see and the background is
10:42 - being colored according that variable
10:44 - but the background color is not changing
10:45 - because I set it equal to zero and I
10:47 - never changed it so now I could try to
10:50 - do some math like I could just say color
10:52 - equals Mouse X like why not that's
10:55 - pretty good whatever the value of Mouse
10:57 - X is set the background color to that so
10:59 - let's see what happens I'm gonna run
11:01 - this look it's working it's changing but
11:04 - it's already white why because as soon
11:06 - as I get to pixel 255 that's the full
11:11 - whiteness so I'm not getting this
11:13 - perfect mapping it's kind of like
11:17 - working but it's not exactly right so I
11:18 - could be approximate I could say okay
11:20 - well let's the canvas is 600 pixels wide
11:23 - why don't I / - that's pretty good
11:26 - 601 a sex is / - that's getting me
11:30 - pretty close it actually kind of looks
11:32 - like it's working on that you know we
11:35 - kind of solved the problem but here's
11:36 - the thing
11:37 - this problem that we have just sort of
11:39 - barely solved over there
11:41 - this is a very simplistic view of it but
11:44 - there's lots of times where you have a
11:45 - sensor like data coming in from some
11:47 - sensor and the range is between you know
11:49 - 321 and 1,057 and then you want to map
11:53 - that range to some other set of values
11:57 - and actually that other set of values
11:59 - has a range between 20 and 35 and the
12:01 - math is a little bit trickier or perhaps
12:03 - you want to take a value that goes
12:04 - between 0 and 200 and invert that and
12:07 - map that between 200 down to 0 so
12:09 - there's lots of more complex scenarios
12:11 - the map function is a general function
12:15 - that will take any range and map a value
12:18 - inside that range to a new value in any
12:20 - other range so let's take a look how
12:25 - that works in this context
12:30 - so there's first of all what I mean by
12:34 - function so already you know about
12:37 - hopefully you know about calling
12:39 - functions in p5 right you might have
12:41 - done this line is a function that takes
12:46 - four arguments one two three four and
12:49 - what is it - it draws a line from you
12:52 - know a point one hundred one hundred
12:53 - fifty fifty done so map it's the same
12:57 - thing it's a function that takes some
12:59 - amount of arguments it's actually going
13:01 - to be five arguments I better give
13:04 - myself more room here I can see that
13:07 - you're not gonna be able see this okay
13:09 - map it takes five arguments one two
13:13 - three four okay so this seems like oh
13:19 - boy five arguments that's terrifying but
13:21 - it's actually it's not so bad so
13:23 - remember I have a range that goes
13:27 - between zero and six hundred this is the
13:30 - range we know that Mouse X is and I want
13:34 - to map this range to arrange between 0
13:37 - and 255 which is what I want to assign
13:40 - to my variable color so the arguments
13:45 - that map requires are the following
13:47 - what is the minimum and maximum of my
13:51 - current range 0 to 600 what is the
13:57 - minimum and maximum of my new range 0 to
14:02 - 255 and what is the value that has this
14:06 - range and which I want to map to the new
14:09 - range well in this case it's Mouse X so
14:12 - I want to map Mouse X which I know has
14:16 - this range that's the X values and I
14:19 - want to map it to this range between 0
14:21 - to 55 for the purpose of color and then
14:23 - when I map it what do I do with it I
14:25 - want to take the result of that mapping
14:28 - and set it equal assign the result to my
14:31 - variable color so this is what's
14:33 - actually something quite new about this
14:35 - map function the line function doesn't
14:38 - do any it performs a task
14:41 - line it draws a line in the canvas it's
14:44 - well whatever you know the computer
14:45 - draws a line on the canvas the math
14:47 - function actually performs a calculation
14:48 - and answers a question it resolves to a
14:52 - single number so I can use that number
14:54 - and assign it back to this variable okay
14:57 - so this is kind of a new concept let's
14:59 - go try to do it in this program so right
15:03 - instead of my goofy like math here Mouse
15:07 - X divided by two what I want to do now
15:10 - is use that map function so I'm gonna go
15:12 - over here I'm gonna say map Mouse X
15:15 - which has a range between 0 and 600 oops
15:19 - I guess I better zoom back out and that
15:22 - give me a new value within a new range
15:24 - between 0 and 255
15:26 - so here Mouse X between 0 and 600 give
15:30 - me a range in 0 to 255 and assign that
15:32 - to this variable color which I'm then
15:34 - going to use in background and watch
15:36 - this we can see all the way perfectly
15:39 - white at pixels 600 perfectly back black
15:41 - at pixel zero let's have a little more
15:44 -  with this 5 is all relative of
15:47 - course let's give ourselves two more
15:50 - variables so I'm gonna make a variable R
15:57 - and B R for red B for blue and what I'm
16:01 - going to do is I'm going to set the red
16:03 - value equal to that mapping so you can
16:07 - see now right blue is that 255 red is
16:12 - that zero and red R is getting that
16:15 - mapping with Mouse X so as I move to the
16:18 - right I get more pink and purple all the
16:21 - way back more blue and here's something
16:23 - interesting I could do with map
16:25 - let's also map the blue value but
16:29 - instead of saying when the mouse is at 0
16:33 - the blue is at 0 and the mouse is at 600
16:36 - the blue is at 255 let's do the reverse
16:38 - let's say when the mouse is at 0 we have
16:41 - 255 blue and when the mouse is all the
16:44 - way on the other side we have 0 blue so
16:46 - we can also invert that range which is
16:48 - great that map will
16:49 - that for us and all the way we could see
16:54 - I give all the way red all the way blue
16:56 - it in the middle I've got red and blue
16:58 - together so you know and also by the way
17:00 - well you know if you're thinking of so
17:02 - you might take this exercise maybe add
17:05 - mouse Y to it try to map announce why
17:07 - there's all sorts of possible things you
17:09 - can do with this so hopefully that gives
17:10 - you a bit of a sense of the map function
17:13 - and that you found that useful possibly
17:17 - came to stop this oops okay I'm still
17:22 - live streaming YouTube let's see if
17:26 - anybody's there fourteen people okay so
17:35 - I'm waiting till the video the stream
17:39 - catches up to where I am in real time
17:40 - I'm gonna drink some water and then
17:48 - perhaps anybody have some comments if
17:52 - this is useful
17:56 - I guess what I'm gonna do in the next
17:58 - video I'm going to record something
18:02 - about the random function I think this
18:06 - is the thing in between when I record I
18:08 - like to I don't know act silly I guess
18:12 - but this is now I don't know recorded
18:13 - for posterity
18:14 - uh hey I don't know how I know you from
18:20 - github Yannick uh I don't know how to
18:22 - pronounce her name I'm embarrassed so
18:24 - you could type in the chat a phonetic
18:25 - version Joshua Davis hello
18:28 - Boff XP it's nice to have some people
18:32 - watching this is really terrible though
18:36 - that the chat is way behind where I am
18:38 - in real-time
18:39 - again I'm gonna have to fix I know I'm
18:41 - just keep repeating myself so anyone
18:42 - have any comments about that video
18:44 - questions yeah it's totally totally and
18:52 - because I'm going to I'm gonna record
18:55 - books I'm a record a new one about
18:58 - random stop the rent stop random
19:03 - know what that means John yeah Johnny in
19:07 - English okay thank you
19:12 - okay well okay so I think I'm just gonna
19:15 - get started
19:16 - cuz this is this this isn't really
19:17 - working as live interaction which is
19:19 - unfortunate I guess I could quit the
19:21 - stream and like reset the settings to
19:23 - try to get it more in sync but I think
19:25 - I'll just I'm gonna record more this
19:26 - afternoon and when I start another live
19:28 - stream oh look I can create this wave
19:31 - thing except it's very severely delayed
19:34 - hello in there okay it's okay
19:40 - everything's gonna be okay don't worry
19:43 - you're gonna make these videos and you
19:45 - won't go totally insane being in a room
19:48 - by yourself talking to yourself on
19:50 - YouTube or something all right
19:55 - great okay so I was trying to do finish
19:59 - these up before noon and so I'm gonna go
20:03 - onto the next one
20:05 - okay okay so I got to minimize this I
20:11 - look at my Twitter you guys can now see
20:15 - that too okay and I minimized that
20:17 - random okay so what do I want to do with
20:20 - random I don't know yet we will just
20:26 - have to figure it out you know what I'm
20:32 - going to do this
20:37 - I don't know I'm gonna do yet I'll
20:39 - figure it out okay uh you drink a little
20:42 - this coffee let me do a couple jumping
20:50 - jacks some of these and then I'm gonna
20:55 - get ready to press record make sure this
21:00 - video uh I should erase this Wow I know
21:07 - what I need to do
21:08 - I had a painting program you know I
21:14 - haven't been good at saving these let's
21:17 - see what this is but this might actually
21:20 - be it perfect
21:22 - okay so we'll do random with this I
21:29 - think could work yeah okay oh I forgot
21:36 - okay sorry I forgot to switch the camera
21:39 - okay here we go there we go here we go
21:43 - here we go
21:45 - and now record
21:54 - start over okay so if you just started
22:01 - learning programming you're using p5 GS
22:04 - you're living in the world typing you're
22:06 - thinking about colors I gotta start over
22:08 - and what I'm talkin about
22:18 - so you've come to this point where
22:21 - you've got some basics down you've got a
22:23 - canvas you're drawing some stuff got
22:25 - colors hopefully you also went outside
22:28 - enjoyed some sunshine at some point and
22:31 - now you're ready for something a little
22:32 - bit more so a good thing I think to sort
22:34 - of start playing around with when you're
22:36 - working with graphics and interaction
22:38 - and just trying to make things move and
22:40 - happen on the screen really what you
22:43 - need to eat is conditional logic and
22:45 - that's gonna be the topic of my next
22:46 - video but before I get to that something
22:49 - that will let you sprinkle on a little
22:50 - more excitement onto your p5 sketches is
22:53 - the function random you know so what
23:00 - does random do for you random will give
23:03 - you a random number so up until now
23:07 - we've most of the examples have done
23:08 - things like here's a color 255 comma 30
23:13 - comma 60 and and in a lot of cases it's
23:16 - nice to pick from a particular color
23:17 - palette for whatever reason but perhaps
23:19 - you want a random color or you want to
23:20 - put a whole lot of circles randomly on
23:22 - the screen or if you think about the
23:24 - painting program that I started with in
23:26 - a couple videos ago maybe every time you
23:28 - click the mouse you're painting with a
23:30 - new random color every time you press a
23:32 - key and the background erases you've got
23:35 - a new random background so ah ah the
23:38 - camera turned off that's good because I
23:39 - hated what I was doing anyway
23:42 - so I got a start over which is just fine
23:46 - just fine by me hit stop the live stream
23:52 - has all of this in it this is quite
23:56 - ridiculous but it works okay uh okay
24:01 - let's start over and drink some water
24:07 - and press record if I press record I'll
24:15 - start recording okay so this is the last
24:20 - video I'm making in this or a little
24:21 - section about variables and you're
24:24 - limited in what you could do so far I've
24:26 - been playing around we've had that map
24:27 - function if you watched the previous
24:28 - video which was kind of an exciting
24:30 - moment now I'm gonna make something it
24:33 - to be honest we've just got a screen
24:34 - with some colors and shapes on it and
24:36 - eventually your creative energy will
24:39 - shine through it's video is gonna happen
24:45 - I swear so here we are this is the last
24:52 - video in this little section about
24:54 - variables in p5.js and before I go I'm
24:57 - not going anywhere because all I do is
24:58 - stay in this room and make videos before
25:00 - before I go on to the next topic which
25:02 - is conditional logic which will really
25:04 - unlock a lot of creative possibilities
25:05 - for you I want to give you one last tool
25:07 - that'll hopefully make things a little
25:10 - bit more exciting in your life and that
25:14 - is the random function so the random
25:16 - function so we we you and me together
25:21 - I've been doing a lot of stuff like this
25:24 - VAR x equals 50 this is well and good
25:28 - and because X is a variable and 50 is a
25:32 - perfectly fine number and I'm happy with
25:34 - my rectangle at pixel 50 but there might
25:37 - be a time where you want the whole point
25:40 - of doing this programming thing is to
25:41 - have systems of logic rules to generate
25:45 - behaviors and graphics and designs it's
25:48 - not really about like let me pick my
25:50 - five favorite numbers and set those
25:52 - variables for those numbers so there's a
25:53 - lot more to it but a first step in that
25:55 - direction so we could at least say
25:56 - here's the rule whenever my program runs
25:59 - the circle will appear at a random X
26:02 - location so instead of saying bar x
26:05 - equals 50 I could say something like var
26:08 - x equals random and random is a function
26:12 - just like any other function line
26:15 - ellipse fill stroke it
26:19 - acquire some arguments to define how
26:22 - that function will behave and random if
26:25 - you watch the previous video is just
26:26 - like the map function and if you recall
26:29 - or if you didn't watch it the difference
26:31 - is when you say line a line is drawn on
26:34 - the screen the line function performs
26:36 - the task when you say random a task is
26:39 - performed picking a random number but
26:41 - that function resolves to it evaluates
26:44 - to that number and you can take that
26:45 - number what it resolves to and assign it
26:50 - back to something a variable value in
26:52 - this case so if I say zero comma 50 I'm
26:56 - kind of at the edge of the semicolon
26:58 - there the parameters the arguments that
27:00 - random takes are a minimum and a maximum
27:04 - and random will give you a number in
27:08 - between zero and fifty one thing that's
27:11 - important here to realize which is a
27:14 - small little distinction is that here
27:17 - are some numbers you might get to 2170
27:21 - look at 73 it's about 50 42 but I will
27:26 - mention you probably won't ever get
27:28 - these I mean we could get these numbers
27:29 - we're likely gonna get numbers like this
27:32 - right it's giving you actually what is
27:35 - sometimes referred to as floating-point
27:36 - numbers or decimal numbers so in this
27:39 - case it doesn't really matter p5 can
27:41 - handle that if you get the number 50
27:43 - point three four five six seven it knows
27:44 - to just draw something at pixel 50 but
27:48 - there's other cases where we might need
27:49 - to do a little something more with that
27:50 - I probably shouldn't even mention this
27:52 - because it's like a little unnecessary
27:53 - point of confusion but I've already
27:55 - started recording this video like 5
27:57 - times so I'm going for it okay
27:59 - so let's actually start messing around
28:01 - with this and see what happens okay so I
28:04 - have a sketch here actually I'm gonna
28:07 - start a new one I know I'm gonna say
28:10 - file new project and I'm gonna call this
28:15 - dots and what I would like to do is have
28:20 - some variables and I'm you know I'm
28:22 - gonna use objects since we learned about
28:24 - this I covered those in a previous video
28:26 - so I have a point
28:29 - and I'm also gonna have a color let's
28:37 - see how I'm doing here with my having
28:39 - just learned JavaScript syntax so you
28:42 - can see I'm setting up a couple
28:43 - variables I want to have a point that
28:46 - has an X and oo I my finger disappeared
28:48 - the point that has an x and a y I want
28:50 - to have a color with an R a G and a B
28:52 - because my plan for all this is first
28:56 - and setup obviously to create a canvas
28:58 - let's make it a nice small size and then
29:02 - in Drew and then what I'm gonna do is
29:03 - I'm gonna I'm gonna set a background I'm
29:05 - gonna set it in set up cuz I'm gonna
29:06 - just just backgrounds just happen once
29:08 - and then in the lips I'm going to draw
29:11 - the ellipse at point x comma point y
29:15 - it's gonna be a small lips and I'm gonna
29:18 - fill it at color are color dot G color
29:22 - dot B so I can zoom back out here and we
29:28 - can see we should be able to run this
29:30 - sketch now hit run okay problem with
29:35 - scope what happened look at this
29:39 - interesting ellipse is receiving an
29:40 - empty variable in spot number one two if
29:45 - this is not intentional color dot R
29:47 - color dot B I could put some semicolons
29:53 - here what did I miss
29:59 - RGB help help look at this what am I
30:11 - doing here
30:11 - Oh ellipse no it's ellipse it's got oh
30:14 - look some crazy stuff has happened here
30:16 - some horrible stuff this video is a
30:19 - disaster I'm gonna fix it I'm gonna cut
30:24 - this out if I remember to point comma X
30:30 - 100 Y is 50 point X point y
30:34 - oh it's alright let's let's do some
30:36 - things first when we have these kind of
30:38 - problems this is a useful point let's
30:42 - just comment out the offending lines of
30:45 - code it's save and hit run okay no
30:48 - errors anymore let's let's comment back
30:51 - in fill you can figure out what's going
30:53 - on
30:54 - still no errors let's draw an ellipse
30:56 - the old-fashioned way and let's see if
31:02 - this works okay that seems good now
31:05 - what's wrong with my point X and point y
31:07 - let's try this just point comma X let's
31:12 - run it again empty variable in spot one
31:16 - you know wonder if point let's call it
31:20 - spot if there's something wrong with
31:22 - using point yeah huh this interesting
31:29 - I'm gonna have to look into that so I
31:33 - don't know if point must be some keyword
31:34 - that's doing oh oh I've done something
31:37 - horrible boy wow this is great this is
31:40 - great okay I know what's happened I know
31:42 - what's happened this is great okay so so
31:48 - here's the thing what would I just do
31:51 - let's think of some functions in p5 I
31:54 - know I'm off on like this horrible
31:56 - tangent now for another five minutes but
31:58 - some functions in pi5 are like line a
32:02 - rectangle for drawing a rectangle
32:03 - ellipse for drawing an ellipse what if
32:07 - you want to draw a point on the screen
32:08 - huh well what's that function again
32:10 - point so point is like a kind of an
32:15 - important thing in p5 that's meant for
32:17 - something highly specific drawing a
32:20 - point so if I try to make up a variable
32:24 - called point I've completely overridden
32:27 - the existing point function and you know
32:31 - what I didn't actually override it
32:33 - because p5 then overrode my variable
32:35 - because things are happening in weird
32:36 - orders and strange ways so that didn't
32:39 - work he was trying to like use the point
32:41 - function as the place to draw the point
32:43 - and everything exploded I got a weird
32:45 - error message so that might be something
32:48 - that
32:48 - p5 could handle with a friendlier
32:50 - message and maybe after this video is
32:52 - over someone will file a github issue
32:54 - maybe that person will be me but let's
32:55 - go back and we solve it but hopefully
32:57 - you saw this the steps of debugging of
33:00 - like everything was like exploding and
33:02 - going wrong and just if you can't take a
33:03 - deep breath calm down convert some stuff
33:06 - out start putting it back in slowly see
33:09 - where things go wrong we've gotten a bit
33:10 - further but now we're back I'm back this
33:14 - video still only at 8 minutes which is
33:16 - totally reasonable and we're going to
33:19 - I'm going to go back and change this to
33:21 - spot and I'm gonna say spot X spot comma
33:25 - Y and I'm going to run it and you can
33:29 - see there we go I have the circle and
33:31 - I'm gonna move this over here being
33:33 - drawn excuse me I I'm like what this -
33:38 - give me a little more space I have the
33:40 - circle being drawn at 100 comma 50 where
33:44 - the spot is with this particular color
33:46 - so what happens we start to add some
33:48 - randomness here so one thing I could do
33:51 - first remember draw looping over and
33:53 - over and over again so what if I just
33:56 - say spot x equals random between 0 and
33:59 - 600 this is another thing it's worth
34:01 - mentioning I want I have a random spot
34:03 - anywhere between 0 and the width of that
34:05 - canvas the width of that canvas is 600
34:08 - so I could write the number 600 there
34:11 - there does happen to be a built-in
34:13 - variable in p5 that knows just
34:15 - dynamically what the width of the window
34:17 - is and this is useful to use because if
34:19 - I use that variable width here instead
34:21 - of typing 600 if I later change the size
34:24 - and create canvas I don't have to change
34:26 - it elsewhere in my code so I'm gonna do
34:27 - that and I'm also gonna say spot dot y
34:30 - is random 0 - height so now let's run
34:34 - this program and look I just get spots
34:37 - all over the place spot spot spots all
34:39 - with a nice red color but perhaps what I
34:42 - want is to say color dot R equals random
34:47 - between like I'm gonna 100 and 255 color
34:50 - G is always zero color dot B is random
34:54 - between you know
34:57 - 101 90 I'm just picking like random
35:00 - arbitrary ranges here and now we might
35:02 - see look I've got a nice variation of
35:05 - random purplish-pinkish DOS and I could
35:08 - even say add a little bit of alpha here
35:11 - and run this again and you can see I
35:15 - have a nice little like pointillist and
35:18 - you can actually one thing you're
35:19 - noticing here if you look really close
35:20 - there's a little black outlines because
35:22 - I didn't turn off the stroke so what I'm
35:25 - going to do now is say no stroke and
35:27 - stop and start and there they just look
35:31 - at this beautiful all these nice little
35:33 - dots layering there's a nice little
35:35 - pointillist thing so you could take this
35:38 - much farther you can make random sizes
35:40 - you can map the random ranges based on
35:43 - like where like if the dots appear on
35:45 - the left they're more greenish if
35:46 - they're on the right they're more
35:47 - blueish so there's so much you could do
35:49 - try to see maybe try to create a random
35:53 - painting here you could use other shapes
35:55 - besides just circles that sort of thing
35:57 - that sort of says an exercise you could
35:59 - try I also might return to this
36:01 - particular program if you remember this
36:04 - we worked on just a little bit of a
36:05 - painting program where you move the
36:08 - mouse around and as you move the mouse
36:10 - around you paint something and so what
36:14 - if you could every time you write now
36:15 - your time you click the mouse it erases
36:17 - the background what if you go every time
36:19 - you click the mouse you get a random
36:20 - background color or as you move the
36:23 - mouse the color changes randomly so
36:26 - there's lots of thinked interesting
36:28 - possibilities there it can make this
36:29 - painting program a bit more
36:30 - sophisticated ok so that is the end of
36:33 - this video and I think this wraps up my
36:36 - section of videos on variables and I'm
36:38 - gonna keep that weird little thing that
36:41 - that happened that I think was a good
36:43 - good moment for today ok see you later
36:52 - now I'm gonna go back to YouTube how do
36:57 - I get back to YouTube Here I am I think
37:06 - YouTube is recording it so it will be
37:11 - saved also I am recording the VIP like I
37:18 - am seperately recording the finished
37:24 - videos anybody have any feedback on that
37:29 - all you fourteen people watch it boy I
37:34 - mean not that I expect there would be
37:36 - more so I guess I'm gonna take a I'm
37:41 - kind of got some momentum here I think
37:43 - I'm gonna though I feel like this is
37:45 - this finishes up this section I'm gonna
37:46 - I'm gonna stop this broadcast so the um
37:50 - and but I have this idea of recording
37:54 - some videos about git and github which I
37:56 - might do at some point today but I need
37:58 - to work on uploading all this stuff so
38:00 - I'm gonna stop this session say goodbye
38:03 - to you lovely fourteen people who are
38:06 - watching thank you very much and I don't
38:12 - know that's it and then I'm gonna come
38:14 - back later today probably I'm kind of
38:17 - addicted to making these videos I have
38:18 - someone there some emails and some other
38:20 - stuff anybody have any other comments
38:22 - they want to add except you won't hear
38:24 - me say this for 30 seconds
38:31 - I'm waiting 30 seconds see what he has
38:33 - in the last comments I would see how far
38:36 - behind I am because if I clap how long
38:40 - shall I clap one one thousand two one
38:41 - thousand three one thousand four one
38:43 - thousand five one thousand six one
38:45 - thousand seven one thousand eight one
38:46 - thousand 1,010 1,011 1,012 1031 I'm is
38:58 - my clapping I do have a video on Perlin
39:02 - noise let me find it Perlin noise video
39:05 - Schiffman I have a bunch of them this
39:09 - bears are on Vimeo they're also on
39:10 - YouTube if you care here is the YouTube
39:11 - one so I will paste it here yeah I will
39:18 - yeah I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna always this
39:21 - now that this works I'm gonna always
39:22 - stream these recording sessions you know
39:24 - as long as people can stomach watching
39:26 - or though I guess you don't have to
39:27 - obviously and then I will I'll always
39:31 - just post a Twitter I guess when I'm
39:33 - doing that okay I gotta turn this off
39:35 - stream is ending signing off thank you
