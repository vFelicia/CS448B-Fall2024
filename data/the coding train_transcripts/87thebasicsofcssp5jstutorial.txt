00:01 - all right so this video is about a giant
00:04 - topic one I know very little about and
00:08 - that topic is CSS and so you know
00:11 - there's been a bunch of videos here that
00:12 - I made about the Dom the document object
00:15 - model web pages HTML pages javascript
00:18 - how they control HTML pages let's just
00:20 - take a step back for a moment and and
00:23 - look at the pieces we know about and
00:24 - what's this third piece that I'm adding
00:26 - so this web page this thing that you're
00:29 - seeing in the browser or in the sort of
00:31 - browser window of the p5.js editor where
00:33 - I'm writing all the code there the thing
00:37 - that this page loads is a file called
00:39 - index.html okay so and this is not a
00:43 - good pen I'm switching pens in this file
00:46 - there is some content written into that
00:48 - file for example there is a header
00:51 - that's at the top of the page there's a
00:54 - paragraph this file is also referring to
00:57 - some JavaScript code it's referring to a
01:01 - bunch of different things like the p5.js
01:03 - library file our own code which is in a
01:07 - file called sketch da Chasse and in
01:08 - those files were doing some JavaScript
01:11 - stuff like making a canvas drawing a
01:14 - circle to that canvas and perhaps even
01:17 - as we've seen in previous videos making
01:19 - other dumb elements like more paragraphs
01:21 - and affecting those and changing those
01:24 - elements so you can think of these
01:28 - pieces as HTML this is really the
01:32 - structure and you could also say like
01:35 - initial content in a way like what's on
01:38 - the page when it first loads of that
01:40 - webpage javascript is logic code things
01:44 - that can handle events store information
01:47 - make all sorts of magic happen this is
01:50 - what you can think of as the behavior of
01:52 - the page so this is where you or and I
01:55 - and everybody else who's doing this
01:57 - stuff is writing code to control what's
02:00 - happening on that page over time based
02:02 - on user interaction based on some
02:04 - mathematical algorithm based on whatever
02:06 - you might fancy you'd like to draw
02:08 - rainbows into canvas unicorns do that
02:11 - with jobs
02:12 - Natick unicorns to my repertoire here
02:14 - only that rainbows okay so a bit in the
02:17 - last piece here that I want to talk
02:19 - about is this idea of CSS and CSS stands
02:23 - for cascading style sheets I don't know
02:26 - why they're cascading probably has to do
02:28 - with some sort of like nesting and
02:29 - whatever somebody on the internet who
02:31 - really knows this stuff will hopefully
02:33 - write in the comments why it's cascading
02:35 - but the key word there is style so if
02:40 - you want to affect various aspects of
02:42 - the layout of this page you want the
02:45 - canvas to actually float on the right
02:46 - side of the page rather than the left
02:48 - side of the page you want to change the
02:49 - font that's in the paragraphs you want
02:51 - to change the background color of a
02:53 - paragraph you want to any just about
02:56 - anything that you can imagine that has
02:58 - to do with the visual look and feel of
03:00 - that page can be controlled with this
03:02 - idea of CSS now once again we're in the
03:06 - same place as we were with HTML you
03:09 - could write HTML into that index dot
03:13 - HTML file or you could dynamically from
03:17 - insert HTML elements into the page using
03:20 - Java Script
03:21 - you could write you can sort in give
03:24 - some initial content you can also
03:25 - control those elements using Java Script
03:28 - the same thing is true with CSS there is
03:30 - a kind of file that can work enough
03:33 - there is a kind another kind of file you
03:35 - could write I've disappeared from the
03:38 - world but I am still here you cannot see
03:41 - me but I am still here I will never
03:44 - leave it still everyone last person on
03:46 - earth actually most people on earth
03:48 - don't really need to know about CSS or
03:50 - maybe they should I don't really know I
03:51 - that was a terrible idea
03:53 - but you're here watching this video
03:57 - maybe CSS is useful to you I'm going to
03:59 - keep going umm the HTML file the
04:04 - JavaScript file now you can also add
04:07 - information about styles to another kind
04:10 - of file named maybe style name whatever
04:12 - you want dot CSS js4 JavaScript dot HTML
04:16 - for HTML dot CSS now we're in what I
04:20 - meant by saying we're in the same
04:22 - situation is I want to talk about how do
04:23 - you add that
04:24 - I'll stuff to style that CSS and that
04:27 - are and or how much you add style
04:30 - dynamically on the fly based on user
04:32 - interaction based on some sub behaviors
04:34 - in JavaScript this is the bigger picture
04:36 - here and then there's lots of details to
04:38 - fill in it boy am i rambling about this
04:40 - but hopefully it's making some sense
04:41 - okay so how does CSS work CSS works on
04:45 - assessing a couple different principles
04:47 - one is this idea of a selector so you
04:50 - need to have a selector meaning what are
04:55 - the things that you want to select to
04:57 - style do you want to select all the
04:59 - paragraphs on the page do you want to
05:01 - select just this one particular
05:02 - paragraph do you want to select the
05:04 - canvas do what what Dom elements do you
05:07 - want to select in order to style after
05:10 - you said after you specify that selector
05:12 - so for example let's say you want to
05:14 - style all the paragraph elements on the
05:16 - page your selector would be P then you
05:19 - need some open and close curly brackets
05:21 - much like you always do when you're
05:24 - doing these kinds of things to denote
05:26 - the beginning and end of the stuff that
05:28 - will the style information that will be
05:30 - applied to that paragraph once you have
05:32 - that all you need are a series of name
05:36 - value pairs looks kind of like a
05:40 - JavaScript object but the syntax is a
05:42 - little bit different these name value
05:44 - pairs are like what's the property you
05:46 - want to style and what's the value for
05:49 - that style for example I want to style
05:52 - the background color and I want the
05:55 - background color to be black or white
05:59 - that's white I want it to be like
06:01 - pinkish f0f so you could be asking your
06:05 - question like oh my god what oh well
06:09 - what is that that looks terrifying to me
06:10 - there's like a pound symbol and then a
06:12 - letter and then a number so there's a
06:14 - lot of things to learn this is a certain
06:16 - kind of special way of writing a color
06:18 - information you know I think maybe this
06:20 - would have been a little bit simpler if
06:22 - I just wrote the word pink here or
06:24 - purple here that would also work there a
06:27 - variety of different ways so now the
06:29 - question is what are the kinds of things
06:30 - that can go here you know font size is
06:32 - one of them I think so if I want to like
06:34 - change the font size there's so much
06:36 - that could go
06:37 - how do you know what the possibilities
06:38 - are how do you add that to your CSS and
06:42 - then how do you do that with JavaScript
06:44 - how much time do we have
06:46 - I'm gonna I'm gonna let's go to the code
06:48 - and look at how that some of this works
06:50 - okay I've disappeared but I'm gonna come
06:53 - back to life sunshine rain down upon me
06:56 - and give me some light
06:58 - and I shall appear now in front of the
07:00 - camera okay I have to turn this down
07:02 - okay so here I am with a p5.js project
07:06 - in the p5.js editor I'm going to run
07:10 - this and you can see there again or back
07:12 - here I have this h1 element this
07:16 - paragraph element this canvas another
07:18 - paragraph element a button some of these
07:20 - elements are written here into the HTML
07:24 - body right in advance these are HTML
07:27 - elements that appear on the page as soon
07:29 - as it loads some of these elements are
07:33 - created with JavaScript made dynamically
07:35 - when the program runs create a paragraph
07:37 - create a button okay this is where we
07:40 - are how do I start to style it style
07:42 - that paragraph okay so actually um what
07:46 - I'm going to do even though I said over
07:48 - here come back even though I said over
07:52 - here you can create a separate CSS file
07:55 - I'll do that in a later video what
07:57 - actually is button to the hi little
07:59 - hyperactive what actually I think I
08:01 - would like to do is show you how you can
08:03 - actually add CSS style information
08:06 - directly into the HTML page so inside of
08:09 - this head tag where I'm referring to
08:12 - JavaScript files I could also
08:15 - potentially refer to some style
08:19 - information so what's that syntax
08:22 - paragraph I want to select all of the
08:25 - paragraphs on the page and assign them a
08:28 - background color which is purple I wish
08:32 - I could type a rainbow there do you
08:33 - think it works if I type rainbow there I
08:35 - doubt it
08:35 - okay so now if I save and I run this
08:39 - again we can see look this paragraph
08:41 - element has a purple background this
08:44 - paragraph element has a purple
08:45 - background you know it's very hard for
08:47 - me to see the text so I think if I say
08:49 - this
08:50 - color it refers to the color of the text
08:53 - inside the paragraph I think and now you
08:57 - can see I have white text with a purple
09:00 - background it looks a little crowded in
09:02 - there so something that I might add to
09:04 - this is some padding and how much
09:06 - padding how about eight pixels px for
09:10 - pixel so I'm going to do this look I
09:13 - look at this I've got some nice padding
09:15 - now so this is the basic idea of CSS I
09:18 - need to select something on the page and
09:21 - then give it some properties what's the
09:23 - property what's the value what's the
09:25 - property what's the value how do you
09:26 - know what all these possible properties
09:28 - are well you need to look this stuff up
09:30 - you can get books you watch other videos
09:32 - that where someone really knows about
09:33 - CSS is talking about this but um but and
09:37 - this is worried so let's look for this
09:39 - briefly in a moment and I have a couple
09:41 - more minutes left I am going to uh so I
09:47 - am on here developer dot Mozilla uh um
09:51 - so this is one place I'll put some links
09:53 - in the description for this video but
09:55 - here is a URL of where I could find some
09:57 - information about CSS I'm going to
09:59 - remove this part here this is a CSS
10:04 - reference there's a tutorial there's
10:06 - demos I want to look at the ref and
10:08 - exhaustive I've exhausted already an
10:11 - exhaustive reference I'm gonna look at
10:13 - the exhaustive reference and I'm going
10:15 - to see like look these are all of the
10:17 - possible things I could add there's so
10:19 - much I just keep scrolling and scrolling
10:20 - and scrolling and scrolling but we can
10:22 - look under I can look for like
10:24 - background color and you can see
10:26 - background color is right over here I
10:29 - can click on it and what do I see now I
10:32 - see here are some examples of different
10:36 - ways that I can call background color
10:37 - could say red I could say RGB I could
10:39 - say current all sorts of ways so this is
10:42 - a topic for another time or another
10:44 - video for you to look on your own
10:46 - there's another CSS reference that I
10:48 - like to use if I could find it in my
10:50 - history here I think it's this one right
10:54 - so I'll include a link to this this is a
10:56 - nice reference of all sorts of possible
10:58 - parameters in CSS the things that I want
11:02 - to focus on in
11:03 - in my videos is less about the full
11:06 - encompassing of all of the CSS reference
11:08 - and more about two things one is this
11:13 - how do these selectors work what are
11:15 - other ways that I could specifically
11:17 - address a single paragraph are only some
11:19 - paragraph there's a lot of ways you can
11:21 - use these selector so I want to get to
11:22 - that and the other thing I want to get
11:24 - to is how do you do style dynamically in
11:28 - JavaScript so with p5.js specifically so
11:32 - let's take at least another video I'm
11:35 - one of my future videos I'm going to
11:36 - talk more about selectors but in this
11:38 - particular video I want to look at the
11:40 - style function so here if I come back if
11:45 - I quit Chrome for a second and I come
11:47 - back to this we can see that these
11:50 - particular elements
11:52 - now these paragraph elements are all
11:54 - styled based on the hard-coded style
11:57 - information that's in the HTML file
11:59 - inside of the style tags but another
12:02 - thing I can do is right over here I can
12:07 - for any HTM any element that I create
12:10 - with p5 and later and show you any
12:12 - element that I access in p5 whether it
12:14 - was created or not I can call a function
12:17 - called style which then requires just
12:22 - two arguments what are those arguments
12:25 - the name of the style property the value
12:29 - of the style property so if I were to
12:30 - put right here in quotes background -
12:34 - color and then I were to say in here in
12:38 - quotes pink you can see look at this
12:42 - this particular element is still getting
12:46 - the style from the HTML page this
12:48 - particular element woop I'm not there
12:52 - this particular element down here is
12:55 - getting the style from my code so when I
12:58 - apply a piece of styling dynamically in
13:01 - code it's going to overwrite the style
13:04 - that was originally set up in the HTML
13:06 - page so there's a lot of pieces here and
13:08 - for you essentially you're following
13:10 - these videos along what I would suggest
13:12 - you do is try adding some style to the
13:14 - HTML file in the same way
13:17 - a that I did here try adding some styles
13:21 - this way
13:22 - what other tags might you reference try
13:25 - adding some styles this way what happens
13:27 - if you add styles to other kinds of
13:29 - elements that aren't just paragraph
13:31 - elements and lastly and I'll do this for
13:33 - you really quickly set something style
13:36 - with an event okay let's think about
13:38 - this for example what if I say what if I
13:42 - were to say button dot mousepressed
13:47 - change style right so now I am attaching
13:53 - the change style event to the press of
13:56 - this button and what is that change
13:58 - style event it's a function that I need
14:01 - to write write the code inside this
14:03 - function right here will execute when I
14:06 - click the mouse on that button and maybe
14:08 - I'll change the text style to pink and
14:11 - maybe I'll give it a lot more padding
14:16 - because who doesn't love padding jazz
14:20 - hands I don't know I feel like that's
14:22 - going to be the desk JavaScript that
14:23 - musical that's my first song who doesn't
14:25 - love padding you're with me on that okay
14:29 - so now if we look at this everything's
14:33 - got its default style I'm going to
14:34 - trigger that event I got some more
14:36 - padding and a pink background so and you
14:39 - know maybe what I want to do I just got
14:41 - to do a little bit more say text mouse
14:43 - over change style oops and then I'll say
14:49 - button I'll say text Mouse out revert
14:54 - style and what I can do here and I'm
14:59 - going to I'm just showing you some other
15:01 - things a revert style and background
15:07 - purple padding eight pixels so let's
15:12 - take out the button event for a second
15:13 - I'm using Mouse out and mouse over a
15:16 - mouse over I'm Mouse out I mouse over
15:18 - I'm Mouse out I mouse over that's a very
15:20 - rhythmic so you can see here that you
15:23 - can start to highlight things make
15:25 - things happen based on button presses
15:26 - based on mouse over
15:27 - out based on the movement of a slider as
15:30 - we saw in the previous video so many
15:32 - possibilities so now you have something
15:34 - to work with try adding some style to
15:37 - the HTML page try adding some style
15:39 - using the style function see what types
15:41 - of elements what types of designs you
15:43 - can make and I'm going to come back and
15:44 - look at this again and again and again
15:46 - in several videos looking at other
15:48 - different types of scenarios with more
15:50 - events and more ways of selecting
15:51 - elements which classes and ID's is the
15:54 - topic for that and just as a reminder go
15:57 - and look in those references that will
15:58 - be linked below as to where you can find
16:00 - all this stuff so I'm five minutes over
16:02 - time not that that is relevant to you
16:04 - especially if you're watching this
16:05 - sometime in the future like in the year
16:07 - 2000 that was a while ago I guess but in
16:10 - my my childhood the year 2000 seemed
16:13 - very far away the year 3000 is a be
16:16 - watching this because you're watching
16:17 - this is a year 3000 please go get my
16:18 - brain out of that cryogenic thing that
16:21 - it's in and I don't know yeah do
16:26 - something with it talk to me about
16:27 - rainbows okay goodbye and I'll see you
16:30 - in a future video
