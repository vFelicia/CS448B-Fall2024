00:00 - hello alright in this video I am once
00:03 - again going to talk about a sink and a
00:07 - weight but in this case I'm gonna use a
00:09 - much more practical example so I'm gonna
00:10 - return back to what I did in the very
00:12 - first video about what is the promise
00:14 - and using fetch and I'm going to revisit
00:17 - this example so what this example does
00:19 - is it goes out to the word Nick API goes
00:23 - out it calls fetch on the word Nick API
00:24 - gets a random word once it has that
00:26 - random word it then requests a gift from
00:29 - the giffy API and we can see fetch
00:32 - returns a promise and so I've chained a
00:35 - whole lot of promises fetch from the
00:37 - word Nick API then we'd get a response
00:39 - convert the response to JSON then once
00:41 - you have the JSON put the word on the in
00:44 - the Dom then go to gif e then convert
00:46 - that to JSON then make an image and if
00:49 - there's any error anywhere on there log
00:51 - the error and I you know maybe I want to
00:53 - say console dot error error here all
00:55 - right so now I want to change I want to
00:58 - do this in a much nicer syntactically
01:02 - sugary way with async and await so how
01:06 - do I do that well the first thing that I
01:07 - want to do is just take all of this code
01:09 - and put it in a separate function so I'm
01:13 - gonna say whoa I don't know what this is
01:15 - like I'm gonna call this function word
01:17 - gif and I actually want to change a
01:21 - couple things here I what I want to do
01:23 - is I want to give it a because I
01:26 - actually this isn't important right now
01:28 - I'm gonna add this in the next video I
01:29 - want to show you what happens when you
01:31 - then need to call I have multiple
01:33 - promises but I'll come back to that
01:34 - I'm just gonna call this function word
01:35 - gift so if I go in here and setup and
01:38 - call this word gift function we are
01:43 - gonna see some gifts and sometimes
01:47 - there's an error right okay so now I
01:51 - want to make this I want to use a weight
01:54 - instead in other words I want to say a
01:57 - weight
01:57 - fetch word Nick API and I'm gonna say
02:04 - let data equals weight so this is by the
02:07 - way I can do this now this is the idea
02:09 - instead of all of this stuff all I have
02:12 - to do and
02:13 - I guess I call this response I can
02:15 - actually just await the result instead
02:17 - of having to fetch and call then that's
02:19 - the new thing but remember if I'm
02:21 - writing a function that uses a weight I
02:23 - must make sure that I label that
02:25 - function async so that's my replacement
02:29 - here and then guess what look at this oh
02:31 - my god
02:31 - I could just say then a weight response
02:36 - JSON so all of this stuff that I had to
02:38 - chain with vens I don't need to do that
02:41 - anymore I could just write them line by
02:43 - line by line in sequence and though all
02:45 - wait this will happen asynchronously
02:46 - because I've made it an async function
02:49 - so I'm just gonna keep going here then
02:51 - I'm gonna and I'm gonna call this
02:52 - response 1 I don't love that but this
02:55 - for the sake of argument here I'm now
02:58 - gonna say this now a weight fetch gif ei
03:03 - PI plus that word then I'm gonna call
03:06 - this JSON 1 then I'm gonna say let and
03:08 - these should all be constant and this is
03:11 - response one response to JSON so that's
03:16 - all the steps right and then and then I
03:26 - want to say let image equal JSON 2 dot
03:34 - and all of this stuff so I want to get
03:37 - that gif and now and I'm going to also
03:44 - say I think what I want to do here is
03:45 - say let word equal JSON one word these
03:48 - are the things I want to get during
03:50 - these steps so I'm gonna put words here
03:52 - and then I could just return at the very
03:56 - end an object with a word word image
04:01 - image yeah this should be like image URL
04:06 - probably so let's let's call this and I
04:11 - guess I'm going to be I I guess I'm
04:15 - gonna let's let me just do this I think
04:18 - this will be simpler JSON 1 dot word so
04:23 - now I've made this async function we're
04:25 - called word gift
04:27 - that oh wait oh wait oh wait oh wait oh
04:29 - wait just go through that all those
04:30 - steps and when it's done it returns an
04:33 - object with the data that it's retrieved
04:35 - guess what I don't need any of that
04:41 - anymore none of this and guess what this
04:45 - remember this is just syntax sugar to
04:49 - wrap all of this stuff in a promise so
04:52 - all I have to do now is say word gif dot
04:54 - then and then I can say results right
05:00 - what comes back an object with these
05:03 - things in it and I can say create P
05:06 - results dot word create image results
05:11 - dot image URL so then and then I can
05:19 - catch any error the same exact way
05:22 - console dot error error so look at this
05:28 - so look at this oh my goodness
05:30 - is this right could this possibly be
05:32 - right whoops
05:35 - I'm looking I'm looking sort of seems
05:38 - right sort of seems right all right here
05:42 - we go okay so I can't believe I just did
05:47 - this are you following me I guess I got
05:49 - lost in my own thoughts there let's just
05:51 - run this and see what happens
06:01 - cannot read property data of undefined
06:04 - sketch that you asked line 20 let's see
06:07 - what did I mess up oh hold on maybe
06:13 - actually oh this is right it works
06:15 - actually this it's just printing out the
06:20 - error it there was no image so I need to
06:22 - be better about handling the error which
06:24 - I'm gonna do in a second so let me
06:25 - change this they'll let me change the
06:27 - word Nick API to give me a word that's
06:30 - between three and five characters cuz so
06:33 - I really make sure that I get a gift
06:37 - okay well let's just see something is
06:42 - missed something's going wrong here
06:45 - let's take a look at json one huh no the
06:49 - word came in
06:50 - there's just no it's just no gift
06:52 - associated with any of these words
06:54 - really there's got to be a gift
06:57 - associated with fried I think I might be
06:59 - missing something
07:01 - gif tapi let's let's look at let's look
07:10 - at JSON - oh look at this I just have
07:13 - this extra nonsense here uh I had that
07:18 - in there by accident I when I was recopy
07:21 - pasting things I made a mistake
07:23 - so hopefully that little debugging
07:24 - helped you sort of see what to figure
07:26 - out here it's nice though that it was
07:28 - this is so much easier to debug than if
07:30 - I had all that vens stuff and all the
07:32 - functions in sinner like anonymous
07:35 - function stuff I can just really debug
07:37 - this much more easily now all right
07:38 - let's try this again
07:39 - there we go so we haven't gotten a gift
07:44 - yet so why not let's look at let's look
07:55 - at this now all right data index zero
08:05 - images so data index zero images fixed
08:10 - height small URL why
08:13 - why is that oh I just called it image ah
08:17 - another mistake oh right forget this
08:21 - eventually results stop image so many
08:23 - little tiny errors because of all my
08:25 - naming weirdness okay here we go ready
08:28 - so I called it this variables image URL
08:31 - and that's what goes into the image
08:33 - property of the object I'm returning so
08:35 - that's the property need to get out here
08:36 - alright here we go
08:37 - feeling pretty good about this let me
08:41 - hit refresh
08:47 - all right we did it everybody so this
08:50 - was now an example of writing a function
08:53 - called word gif and what that function
08:56 - does is it asynchronously steps through
08:59 - all of these different asynchronous
09:01 - calls one at a time using the await
09:03 - keyword so that I can sequence them and
09:06 - when it's done I have the data that I
09:08 - want and I can send it back if I'm gonna
09:10 - write a sent just put a weight anywhere
09:13 - in my code I can't just suddenly put a
09:15 - weight in setup for example in p5
09:17 - because I can't make setup an
09:18 - asynchronous function if I put a weight
09:20 - I've got to modify that function to make
09:22 - it a sync okay so what's left this is my
09:27 - chair I say that this is maybe a useful
09:29 - tutorial I don't know you tell me but
09:32 - what's left is I'm now going to show you
09:35 - what if I want to have 10 words and get
09:40 - all 10 words and gifts all together and
09:42 - I want to have something happen when
09:44 - they're all done that's what I'm going
09:46 - to need promised all for and that will
09:49 - be in the next video and that's the last
09:50 - one of this series on promises and async
09:54 - and weight all right thanks Wow I'm like
09:56 - a chef MA
