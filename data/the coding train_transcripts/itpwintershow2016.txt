00:00 - hello it's me dan Schiffman strangely
00:02 - not in front of a green screen not in
00:04 - this little like cramped room I'm here
00:06 - actually at a place called ITP it's
00:08 - where I spent almost all of my time ITP
00:10 - is a two-year master's program there's a
00:12 - little over 200 students here working
00:14 - all semester to create a lot of
00:16 - interesting strange projects that make
00:18 - all sorts of new and innovative uses of
00:20 - Technology ITP as part of Tisch School
00:22 - of the Arts at New York University but
00:24 - really one thing that ITP is really
00:25 - about is people people in ideas not
00:27 - about the technology so I'm excited to
00:29 - be here to introduce you to some of
00:30 - those people and the projects that
00:31 - they've made so I'm gonna wander around
00:32 - the floor show you some stuff if you are
00:36 - interested in finding out more about ITP
00:37 - or these projects you can take a look at
00:38 - this video's description where I'll have
00:39 - links to everything and I'm talking very
00:41 - fast that I'm not sure why but I'm a
00:42 - little panicked here in this new
00:44 - location okay see you soon in a minute
00:46 - because I'll still be here
00:55 - hey can we video your project I'm yeah
00:59 - so song and my project name is
01:02 - illuminated path so this is a light bulb
01:04 - that follows you and when it finds a
01:07 - person it deems up and they'll follow
01:09 - you
01:10 - why lighting it's on then like when you
01:12 - are going out then it dims out where do
01:15 - you imagine this living if it were to be
01:17 - somewhere besides the a TV show someone
01:18 - told me about cave also many 12 people
01:24 - talked about I wish I have this at home
01:27 - so I can save the energy and I don't
01:30 - need to right turn it on and off and
01:31 - just uh follow me and I work in cool I
01:34 - love it
01:36 - I'm Jenny Lim I'm Tom tenkan and our
01:40 - project laser cats is a two-player game
01:42 - where one user controls the laser and
01:44 - one user is the cat and tries to catch
01:46 - the laser and the the paws have are
01:50 - light-sensitive so when you catch the
01:52 - laser with your paw you get a point
01:54 - what's that what's the high score low
01:56 - 30s yeah
01:58 - what can I try it now
02:01 - [Music]
02:09 - hi my name is Chris this play is called
02:12 - Tac Toe and it's my final ICM project so
02:16 - it always works if you have a bird
02:18 - flying around which are basically images
02:20 - people sent to this number and all the
02:22 - images are transformed into birds so the
02:25 - way it works is you take the green box
02:28 - put it wherever you want in the wall
02:30 - like here for instance and you can get a
02:33 - bird from that image the less people's
02:36 - someone sent and then you can grab this
02:39 - box and shake it and the wave will stop
02:43 - flapping and then you can text okay so
02:52 - I'm gonna put this here
02:55 - I'm gonna make a lot my name is Lindsay
03:08 - and my project is pop-up forest which is
03:11 - a couple spreads from a pop-up book that
03:13 - also influenced their own seeing its it
03:21 - becomes night time and things you do
03:25 - down here like rustling in the bushes
03:27 - bring out foxes you can add more
03:31 - fireflies to the scene and if you add
03:34 - enough fireflies all the foxes will put
03:36 - on sunglasses so there's another one you
03:40 - can scare all the foxes away because
03:44 - foxes are definitely afraid of Alice
03:45 - where'd you get the idea for like this
03:47 - is our story here everywhere the
03:49 - particular characters are the content
03:50 - where did you come up with that idea I
03:52 - think for my animation project it was
03:56 - outside I've been doing a lot of
03:57 - projects that were outside and using
03:59 - like outside noises and so I don't know
04:03 - that soundscape is really nice to me so
04:05 - the idea of generating an environment
04:07 - that you could also immerse yourself in
04:08 - was really nice this is Sebastian
04:11 - Daniella this project is called unit of
04:15 - measurement we're interested in light
04:18 - and balance and geometrical patterns and
04:21 - the idea behind it is we kind of wanted
04:24 - to make visible the interconnections of
04:26 - space we have been working on this break
04:28 - for the past couple of months a lot of
04:30 - experimentation playing with different
04:33 - ways to make bubbles and create these
04:34 - geometries this is our final piece well
04:38 - it was an interesting process because we
04:40 - we kind of went deep into studying how
04:42 - bubbles house up bubbles are made we
04:44 - went to a lab at Cooper Union we
04:47 - experimented with glycerine with all
04:49 - these fun kinds of stuff but right now
04:52 - what what is for also it's amazing is
04:54 - the patterns and the colors so that we
04:56 - can see in the film of the bubble which
04:58 - has a lot to do with gravity and
05:00 - hi I'm Haley and my project is this is
05:06 - virtual levator that can turn I can
05:09 - travel to corridors to the helipad layer
05:13 - of the sky so where'd you get the idea
05:15 - for this right well I just imagined that
05:18 - if there is a super long elevator then
05:20 - you can travel like a anywhere like a
05:23 - particularly so I just my name is Yoon
05:37 - and we created a series of musical lamps
05:41 - which is interactive which it can be
05:44 - spun by the users and can creative a
05:46 - light and sound try different material
05:53 - and then for this route land with piano
05:56 - music is hearty and depends on the anger
05:59 - to use the speed you will generate
06:01 - different kind of our music check and
06:03 - this one is like six jumps behind this a
06:07 - credit land and this is from Metro you
06:10 - can hear it like Dena named Amanda so
06:12 - they can come by with four different
06:15 - kind of firm music together and create
06:18 - over a harmony peace
06:19 - my name is Stephanie Colton and this is
06:21 - birds and sea which is a bird Orchestra
06:23 - that you control the ammos so it's based
06:27 - on Carey Reilly's and C project
06:31 - so these are different phrases for each
06:36 - representing each phrase that Terry
06:38 - Riley Road and they've been
06:40 - using birdsongs so you can add different
06:42 - birds and move them through that work
06:48 - this trap or the piece around our yards
06:54 - [Music]
06:58 - so the bird sounds are from this bird
07:00 - enthusiasts website that people have
07:02 - uploaded they're recorded sounds from
07:04 - the wild and so I grabbed a couple of
07:06 - those and extracted what approximated a
07:09 - note see so birds don't actually sort of
07:11 - sing notes as we conventionally know
07:13 - them but you can approximate their
07:15 - frequency and then grab a C and then I
07:18 - use that and pitch adjusted and
07:20 - stretched it to form the different notes
07:22 - in this scale and then place those in
07:24 - the order that Terry Riley had proposed
07:26 - them into the different phrases this is
07:28 - a leading question because I know the
07:29 - answer but what did you use to build it
07:30 - oh I used v5 can you believe it
07:33 - and the sound library for all the sound
07:34 - stuff or something yeah no I use the p5
07:37 - sound library awesome great thank you
07:40 - yeah I'm ccino ccino kim and this is my
07:44 - project operator and it's basically an
07:46 - old telephone switchboard where that
07:49 - lets you make telephone calls to anyone
07:52 - and record those the audio from those
07:55 - close calls in and and then play around
07:59 - with this the recorded sounds that add
08:01 - sample add effects and just kind of like
08:04 - make
08:08 - [Music]
08:25 - my name is Becca Rix I'm Rita which is a
08:31 - it's a vr documentary based on an
08:33 - interview that we did with a friend of
08:35 - mine who's a refugee from Sierra Leone
08:37 - she moved to the United States in 2001
08:40 - and so we interviewed her to asking
08:42 - questions about her sense of home and
08:44 - identity and how it evolved over the
08:46 - years and kind of how her view of
08:47 - herself has changed so we made kind of
08:50 - audio documentary out of nine pieces and
08:55 - each piece represents a different memory
08:58 - that he I'ma be sharing and for that for
09:01 - each memory we created a 3d object that
09:03 - we put in the VR ik environment that
09:05 - represent the audio that the the memory
09:08 - that she's talking about people said I
09:12 - am like the female version of my dad
09:15 - meaning I am very outspoken and I'm very
09:18 - protective
09:22 - I think the difference is between my dad
09:25 - and I I kind of discover later on even
09:28 - when you take your people don't forget
09:29 - to take care of yourself
09:31 - [Music]
09:34 - we're what are the images because when I
09:36 - you know I didn't have my glasses on so
09:37 - they they're like a little but so they
09:39 - had kind of like a distorted or
09:40 - painterly quality to them is that on
09:42 - purpose or how did you make decisions
09:43 - about the visuals the store purpose so
09:46 - we really liked the idea of using
09:47 - photogrammetry because there's sort of a
09:49 - fragmentary distorted aesthetic to it
09:51 - that to us kind of matched the way
09:53 - memory works and the way you recall
09:54 - things so we kind of liked that it's a
09:57 - little bit imperfect it's a little bit
09:58 - scrappy but it kind of feels like
10:00 - realistic and detailed enough to feel
10:02 - like it's a real memory okay I'm and
10:06 - these are the camel turnin cards these
10:08 - are generative coloring puzzles so the
10:11 - idea is that we have like these many
10:13 - different cards they have like a grid of
10:16 - cells where instructions expressed as
10:19 - arrows we have two different types of
10:22 - arrows
10:22 - two different colors and then following
10:25 - instructions either like continuing to
10:27 - draw with the same color or to switch to
10:30 - the other color and these are generated
10:33 - in a way Danny that if you follow these
10:35 - instructions you will eventually reveal
10:37 - a possible message my name is Francesca
10:41 - Rodriguez and this is my project called
10:43 - keepo what's the name mean by the way
10:46 - hippo means not in an Andean language
10:49 - that's called Quechua so it actually
10:51 - means not and he was also an old record
10:54 - system that was based on notes and
10:56 - chords of different colors and that's
10:58 - why he's pretty inspiring so what is the
11:01 - - can you show - yeah so actually my
11:03 - idea was that I wanted to find a way of
11:05 - how can I use technology to amplify
11:07 - those old record systems in this case
11:09 - people I was using the Incan Empire like
11:11 - thousands of years ago and I collected
11:14 - some stories about cultural identity and
11:15 - how that changes when you migrate
11:17 - somewhere else and I thought those
11:19 - stories had a lot of layers the same way
11:21 - that when you weave you have a lot of
11:22 - different layers and I kind of linked
11:24 - them together and try to think of an
11:26 - interface where people will be able to
11:28 - hear these stories but in the way we
11:30 - like consuming stories nowadays which is
11:31 - I will just go and touch these and hear
11:33 - the story I don't want to hear any more
11:35 - I will go to the other one and they
11:36 - maybe go back so that's kind of the way
11:39 - it works so whenever you touch
11:41 - these notes you will be able to hear one
11:43 - of these stories and if you want you can
11:45 - switch to the other one and then you can
11:47 - go back and kind of get that general
11:49 - feeling of cultural identity through
11:50 - these kind of old interface just with
11:53 - some like hidden technology that it's
11:56 - like for today okay so this is the
11:59 - Xperia Murrah it's a bridge between a
12:01 - film camera and an analogue of film and
12:03 - analog camera and a digital and iPhone
12:04 - camera I'm it's inspired by film cameras
12:07 - and that as you take a picture of
12:08 - filters immediately applied to the photo
12:10 - that mimics the quality of a vintage
12:12 - camera it is inspired by a digital
12:14 - camera and that you have immediate
12:15 - access to the photo because it's sent
12:17 - straight to Twitter on its own Twitter
12:18 - account by pressing a button
12:21 - I applied filter by pressing a button
12:23 - and two LEDs will light up signifying
12:26 - metafilter has been applied and when I
12:28 - capture a photo LEDs will go down the
12:30 - line signifying that the photo is
12:31 - captured so I'll take a few photos I
12:35 - think we currently have your photos
12:38 - Center
12:48 - my name is Jaso Trivedi and my project
12:51 - is a Dori the haptic meditation
12:53 - experience so what happens in the in the
12:56 - meditation experience so what happens is
12:58 - when you sit down you situate yourself
13:00 - you're guided through a five minute
13:02 - meditation on just focus on your
13:05 - breathing which will eventually lead you
13:07 - to a point of relaxation where you start
13:09 - chanting and as you chant the meditation
13:12 - platform vibrates with your voice so the
13:15 - whole the whole concept is to increase
13:18 - focus and concentration for new and
13:21 - experienced meditators the show is so
13:23 - crazy with so many people and like so
13:25 - much noise and people wonder if you'll
13:27 - really been able to meditate in it even
13:28 - with the sort of chaos that's happening
13:29 - yeah somebody actually fell asleep in
13:33 - the platform yeah people are people who
13:36 - haven't meditated before now interested
13:38 - in meditation which I mean has enormous
13:40 - health benefits and I think that's a
13:42 - great outcome this is something I very
13:44 - very much need so thank you I'm
13:48 - Sebastian and this is a very based on
13:51 - anatomical paintings and the
13:53 - construction of these paintings it works
13:56 - by reconstructing details and assigning
13:58 - triangles to those details so areas
14:00 - where the artist gave more attention are
14:03 - brought forward and sharper well
14:06 - everything is else is pushed behind how
14:10 - do you picking how did youhow are you
14:12 - picking the images that it uses like
14:13 - where'd you find those and what kind of
14:15 - content to teach you they're all
14:17 - anatomical paintings because I really
14:20 - like the big instruction of these bodies
14:23 - and the attention that is set to the
14:26 - painting so here you see a lot of
14:28 - triangles in this area which where is
14:29 - the arm that is being explained
14:37 - hi my name is Paola and I made this with
14:40 - three other teammates kochiya without
14:43 - any menu and basically what this is is
14:47 - it started under the theme of time and
14:51 - we wanted to focus on the right now and
14:54 - kind of use social media as a way that
14:57 - people use to record their lives so what
15:00 - this does is you can text your Instagram
15:03 - handle or your account to the eye and
15:05 - it'll blink and when it opens you can
15:06 - look into it and it'll show you your
15:08 - life in the blink of an eye
15:10 - basically that that's what it does I
15:12 - will text my Instagram handle to the eye
15:18 - and it'll blink
15:20 - [Music]
15:28 - hi I'm Dora Luna hi my name is Mint why
15:31 - I opened up a natural tea the project is
15:34 - called
15:35 - nom nom and it's basically controlled it
15:38 - allows you to play youtube videos as you
15:42 - wouldn't and are you picking the videos
15:44 - or they could be any video they're gonna
15:45 - be any videos you can just drop any
15:47 - videos you want and
15:52 - [Music]
16:06 - [Music]
