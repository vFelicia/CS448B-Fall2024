00:00 - [Music]
00:02 - welcome to a coding challenge where I
00:06 - will make a cheese bot that thinks of a
00:08 - random number and then the user has to
00:10 - guess that random that random number
00:13 - will be
00:13 - [Music]
00:24 - [Music]
00:27 - thank you very much okay so I already
00:31 - forgot what I said three 7155
00:33 - so I'm gonna do this in JavaScript I'm
00:36 - gonna say let let dot let dot no there's
00:39 - no let that let number equal 37 Oh 555
00:45 - okay I guess the bots gonna think of a
00:48 - number between 0 and 999 thousand and
00:53 - the chat bot framework that I'm gonna
00:55 - use to create this bot is something
00:58 - called rive script and I made a really
01:00 - terrible video about rive script that
01:02 - you could go and watch if you haven't
01:04 - but I would probably recommend just go
01:06 - and look at the right script tutorial
01:07 - which will be linked on the right script
01:09 - website which will be linked in this
01:10 - video's description and so what I need
01:13 - to I need to do two things I need to
01:14 - program in JavaScript I need to
01:16 - configure my chat bot the brain of the
01:18 - chat bot right this is a diagram from my
01:20 - previous video where I have something a
01:22 - JavaScript program is going to feed
01:24 - input into the brain and the brain is
01:26 - going to give me a reply so I'm gonna do
01:28 - all of this input and output in
01:29 - JavaScript but the brain is actually
01:31 - gonna be controlled by rive scripts so
01:33 - in order for that to happen I need to
01:35 - create a rive script file so I'm gonna
01:37 - say new file and I'm gonna call it a
01:40 - brain drive there's I don't have to call
01:43 - it that I'm actually I have an atom
01:45 - package the atom drive script package
01:48 - which is doing syntax highlighting so I
01:51 - can do things like and I said in my
01:52 - previous video that a pound was a
01:55 - comment it's not so this is the chat
01:56 - bots brain so the first thing I'm gonna
01:59 - do is I'm gonna give the chat bot a
02:01 - specific number I have an idea for the
02:03 - number to be picked randomly each time
02:05 - but let's just start with a specific
02:08 - random number in the chat bot so this is
02:10 - rive script syntax it looks like
02:12 - JavaScript but it's write script syntax
02:14 - and I'm gonna do something that just
02:17 - says so I'm gonna do a catch-all so I'm
02:23 - this is a trigger so this is so rife
02:26 - script if you didn't watch the previous
02:27 - video or don't know anything about it is
02:28 - a pattern matching system for chatbots
02:30 - so this is match anything the user says
02:33 - that I don't match otherwise I'm going
02:35 - to say the reply is going to be
02:37 - guess a number between zero and nine
02:42 - nine nine nine nine right so that's what
02:45 - the chat bot is going to say so actually
02:47 - let's leave this let's try to get the
02:49 - whole system working and then we'll come
02:51 - back and finish configuring the chat bot
02:53 - so how do I want to make this work well
02:55 - I want to have let's start putting some
02:58 - stuff in the HTML like chat bot and then
03:01 - I'm going to create a input user we call
03:06 - this user input and I'm going to say say
03:12 - I'm gonna and then I'm going to create
03:17 - I'm going to create so this I'm just
03:19 - trying to put some stuff on the HTML
03:21 - page and I'm going to say reply I mean
03:27 - I'm not being thoughtful about the
03:29 - design here output and then I probably
03:34 - need like some sort of button that's
03:37 - like submit I mean like button ID equals
03:40 - submit button so again I'm being
03:44 - absolutely not very thoughtful about
03:46 - this interface but I'm just putting it
03:48 - let's see if what I wrote here in HTML
03:50 - will appear on the page there we go
03:56 - and the button should say submit great
04:00 - so this is the idea is that I'm gonna be
04:02 - able to say things like hello and hit
04:04 - submit and the chat BOTS gonna say
04:06 - something to me here in the reply
04:08 - obviously it's my hope that those of you
04:09 - watching this video will make something
04:11 - more creative and thoughtful about the
04:14 - design and eventually what I want to do
04:16 - is use a library called p5 speech to
04:19 - actually have all this happen with voice
04:20 - so but let's first make it work with
04:23 - text and I'll do another video to make
04:25 - it work with voice ok so how do I then
04:27 - so now I have my framework and well
04:31 - let's actually look we need to write
04:34 - some JavaScript I forgot about that part
04:35 - so let's go back to JavaScript and I
04:38 - don't need to draw a function and I'm
04:40 - gonna say let button equal select I
04:44 - called it some with an idea of submit
04:46 - I'm gonna say let
04:50 - user input equals select user input does
04:55 - the idea I gave it and what else do I
04:59 - need I need let output equals select
05:02 - output so now I have access to all of
05:04 - those Dom elements like I need the bunny
05:06 - to know when the user hits the button I
05:07 - need to know in the user what the user
05:09 - is said when they hit the button and I
05:11 - need to build to put the reply somewhere
05:12 - so now I need a callback an event for
05:15 - whenever I click the button button dot
05:16 - mousepressed
05:18 - and I'm gonna call a function called
05:21 - chat so I'm now going to write a
05:22 - function called chat and all I'm gonna
05:26 - do here I'm gonna say input equals user
05:30 - input value so this is me getting the
05:34 - value what the user said and I'm gonna
05:36 - say output dot HTML input so I now have
05:40 - a parrot chat bot I have made a parrot
05:42 - chat bot all it ever will do is put back
05:45 - what the user says I haven't put the
05:47 - right script brain into this program yet
05:49 - so now let's see if this is correct if I
05:51 - run this hello hello goodbye goodbye
05:56 - what's up question mark what's up so we
05:59 - can see here this is my very basic
06:01 - parrot chat bot I can read what the user
06:03 - says and I can give it a reply now it's
06:05 - time for us to add that brain so I'm
06:08 - gonna go to the rive script github page
06:10 - and this is actually in this particular
06:13 - repository called drive script j/s so
06:16 - write script is a generic syntax for
06:18 - configuring a chat bot that you can then
06:20 - use in a variety of different
06:22 - programming languages environments I
06:23 - want to use it in JavaScript so all I
06:26 - need to do i one thing i've done already
06:28 - that i should have mentioned is i've
06:30 - imported the rive script library so here
06:33 - i've imported the rice script library
06:35 - just from a URL i could download it but
06:37 - i must have a reference to that rice
06:39 - script javascript library so i've done
06:41 - that it's and it's covered in that
06:42 - github page and then i'm really just
06:45 - gonna say load file so first i'm going
06:47 - to create a bot so i'm gonna go here and
06:50 - i'm gonna say let bot equal new rai
06:54 - script then I'm gonna say load file and
06:59 - my file is just called brain drive
07:04 - and I'm gonna I need to call backs ready
07:09 - a brain ready and brain error being very
07:15 - inconsistent of my naming of stuff so
07:17 - I'm now gonna write those callbacks
07:18 - brain ready console dot log chat bot
07:25 - ready and then I'm going to say brain
07:29 - error console dot log chat bot error and
07:36 - I'm sure I could there's probably an
07:38 - argument I could get some information
07:39 - about the error but let's just add this
07:41 - right now and let's just see if I now
07:43 - run this uncaught dollar sign is not
07:48 - defined
07:49 - apparently I named my chat bot Brian
07:51 - without realizing it the name is brain
07:55 - not Brian the life of brain okay here we
07:58 - go let's try this now ah oh I know what
08:06 - the problem is
08:07 - I know what the problem is what could
08:09 - possibly dollar sign is not defined mean
08:13 - what javascript library uses dollar sign
08:16 - as a key term jQuery I think that rive
08:22 - script depent the rive script JavaScript
08:24 - library depends on jQuery and I have it
08:26 - imported jQuery that must be the problem
08:28 - right so it's not even loading the file
08:30 - it hasn't even gotten to the air and
08:31 - error in the file yet so if I want to
08:33 - load jQuery let's find a way to do that
08:37 - okay so now I've imported jQuery as well
08:40 - here's the thing so JavaScript files
08:43 - that a web page uses can be loaded just
08:46 - like this is the code that I'm writing
08:47 - it's it's get Dutch yes these are some
08:49 - p5 libraries that I'm using but they're
08:51 - actually locally stored on the computer
08:53 - now there's some other libraries but I'm
08:54 - getting them from a URL all these things
08:56 - are possible I don't know there's
08:57 - probably some nice good best practices
08:59 - here that's somebody who knows something
09:00 - about programming will tell you but I'm
09:02 - just gonna make it work okay so now
09:04 - let's go back hit refresh chatbot ready
09:07 - okay so the chat bot is ready so now
09:11 - what do I do next
09:12 - what I want all I need to do is here in
09:15 - this chat
09:17 - and I probably should make you know if I
09:18 - were being really careful about this I
09:20 - would write some code to make sure the
09:23 - brain had been loaded before the bot
09:25 - tries to reply but I think it's very
09:28 - unlikely that a user is gonna be able to
09:30 - submit something before the bots
09:31 - actually loaded so but I'm gonna show
09:33 - you there's something I'm gonna have to
09:34 - add to this later that I think it's
09:35 - gonna be a little bit of an issue okay
09:36 - so what I'm going to do is I am going to
09:42 - I have come to all right so I need to
09:47 - ask the bot for a reply and I'm pretty
09:48 - sure this is gonna this is gonna be here
09:50 - just in this page and oh interesting so
09:55 - I think that I might actually need this
09:58 - the replies have to be sorted to be
10:01 - honest I have no idea what that does but
10:02 - I imagine this is some sort of like
10:05 - processing element so let's add this in
10:12 - and so let's add this in under brain
10:17 - ready I'm gonna sort the replies and
10:20 - then what I want to do is I want to say
10:22 - let reply equal bot reply input now I
10:27 - think this actually isn't gonna work I
10:29 - think I need to say I think if I look at
10:33 - the code example here local user I
10:35 - forget what this does but I need to give
10:40 - the first argument as local user so I
10:43 - want to say let input equals user input
10:45 - value and bot reply lip so let's see
10:47 - what happens now I think I did
10:48 - everything
10:51 - hello guess a number between so no
10:54 - matter what I do it's just going to say
10:56 - guess the number between 0 and 99 99 so
10:59 - now aha so what do i what what else do I
11:03 - need in this chat bot so for example
11:05 - what if the user says any number great
11:12 - guess I like the number star 1 so this
11:17 - isn't a star but this is a wild card
11:20 - just like this is a wild card but this
11:22 - is a wild card that only will match a
11:24 - number so now if I reload this again if
11:28 - I say anything I'm gonna say guess a
11:30 - number but
11:30 - I say 100 great guests I like the number
11:33 - 100 let me make this a little bit bigger
11:34 - so we can see I'm starting you can
11:36 - figure the bots to do certain things now
11:39 - what I really want to do is use a
11:41 - conditional so I want to say something
11:44 - like if star 1 is greater than is
11:53 - greater than bot num then I'm going to I
11:59 - need an equals here I don't even
12:00 - remember then I'm going to say pick a
12:03 - higher a lower number and if it's less
12:10 - than I don't know if I've got the syntax
12:13 - right here pick a higher number and
12:15 - again you could go and read the rice
12:17 - Script tutorial heart watch my previous
12:19 - video that wasn't very good now that
12:21 - this one's any good and then I could say
12:23 - oh I'm sorry what am i doing here I'm in
12:27 - the wrong I'm totally in the wrong place
12:28 - oh no no I'm in the right place I just
12:31 - don't know if I have the syntax right
12:32 - and then if it's equal you got it you
12:39 - got it so let's go to the rice script
12:41 - tutorial which is here and let's look
12:45 - for conditional condition condition
12:49 - additional so this is a way I can have
12:54 - the bot set something and what I'm
12:57 - looking for is like this here we go ah
13:02 - what I get age is greater than 25 this
13:07 - is what you can do so this is what I
13:08 - want I have I want this conditional and
13:10 - I need the equals like almost like the
13:12 - arrow syntax the equals greater than so
13:15 - I want to say equals like this so I
13:20 - think this should work let's see if this
13:24 - is right and let's let's take a look
13:29 - here oh these are stars so I guess I
13:32 - need stars if I'm going to do a
13:33 - conditional and syntax highlighting is
13:40 - doing something weird which and the
13:42 - equal should be double equals I guess
13:44 - there we go so I think maybe this is
13:46 - right now okay let's see
13:49 - and I don't know need to say star one
13:51 - cuz there's only star so let's see
13:53 - what's the chance I've gotten this right
13:58 - so things are still working is telling
14:02 - me to guess a number I'm gonna guess the
14:03 - number 10 pick a higher number I'm gonna
14:06 - guess the number nine nine nine nine
14:07 - nine nine nine pick a lower number I'm
14:09 - gonna guess the number 37 five five five
14:12 - you got it okay we should probably more
14:19 - with this bot like it should have a name
14:21 - and it should be able to respond to
14:22 - other things but one thing I want to do
14:24 - is so why am I doing this
14:26 - I don't know I've really lost track of
14:28 - that but one reason why I'm doing this
14:30 - is if I combine rye script and
14:34 - JavaScript I can make use of the
14:36 - powerful pieces of Drive script and
14:40 - JavaScript together so what I could do
14:43 - is I could actually have JavaScript I
14:46 - don't think there's a way for rye script
14:47 - easily to pick a random number it
14:48 - probably is but just for the sake of
14:50 - argument what if I oh it's funny how I
14:55 - had this here so what if I actually say
14:58 - let num equal floor random nine nine
15:03 - nine nine nine so and then I'm going to
15:05 - and actually what I'm saying is 100,000
15:10 - uh I know you know the parentheses now
15:14 - I'm going to just console.log that
15:15 - number let's just what I want is for
15:18 - JavaScript to pick the random number
15:22 - there so it's picking a random number
15:24 - each time and maybe I need to make this
15:26 - a little bigger so you can see it right
15:28 - so how can I pass something that
15:31 - javascript picked to the bot well I'm
15:35 - asking
15:36 - I'm sending things to the bot from the
15:39 - user but I don't actually have to I
15:41 - could send stuff from the bot from my
15:43 - program as well so there's no reason why
15:45 - I couldn't actually just do this when
15:47 - the chat bot is ready
15:53 - and then what if what I send to the bot
15:59 - is let reply equal bot dot wouldn't it
16:05 - what is what is the function bot reply
16:07 - user Lok Lok 'l is it something like
16:10 - that i don't know i can't remember the
16:11 - local user set plus the number so what
16:20 - I'm doing is I'm sending to the bot I'm
16:22 - telling the bot like a secret message
16:24 - the code is sending a message to the bot
16:26 - not me the actual user typing saying set
16:29 - number so what I now want to do is if
16:32 - and of course this is very easily
16:34 - hackable don't get me wrong
16:36 - set number is a message where now I the
16:42 - bot will set and we don't need this a
16:46 - hard-coded variable anymore set num
16:50 - equal star so this will actually and I
16:56 - don't did I get this syntax right looks
16:58 - like something might be weird but I
17:00 - think I got it right so set Nam equals
17:02 - star and then now I can change this from
17:04 - bot num to get numb so let's see and I
17:07 - don't know let's make this pick a number
17:08 - between but between 1 and 10 just to
17:13 - like make things a little simpler here
17:15 - and now the number will be here plus 1
17:19 - because this is gonna give me a number
17:20 - between 0 & 9 and so and let's actually
17:25 - let's look at that number so we can
17:28 - cheat so to speak to make sure this is
17:30 - working and let's run this now okay so
17:33 - we'd pick the number 4 I can see that in
17:36 - the in the in the console so if I say 1
17:39 - no reply found so what happened here
17:45 - brain so this is wrong this is clearly
17:49 - the wrong syntax let's go back to the
17:52 - Rive script tutorial and we can see here
17:56 - a set name oh you know what it is you
18:02 - probably doesn't want any white space
18:03 - their set name equal formal
18:07 - forma by the way this is a way to keep
18:10 - the the case sensitivity of what the
18:12 - users typed there's all sorts of things
18:14 - and and so I can say set num let's see
18:21 - where was that set name equals formal
18:26 - let's just paste this in here to make
18:28 - sure I'm using the right syntax set num
18:31 - equal star so let's try this pick a
18:39 - higher number nine pick a lower number
18:42 - eight pick a lower number seven
18:46 - you got it too so you know I'm hacking
18:55 - it basically but pick a higher number
18:57 - pick a lower number so probably I don't
19:00 - know if this is the best solution there
19:01 - might be a different way to pass that
19:02 - value to the brain but certainly if I
19:05 - wanted to do it this way I could come up
19:07 - with like a really strange thing that
19:09 - the user would probably never type
19:11 - that's almost like a secret code to set
19:14 - a particular value that I'm getting from
19:15 - JavaScript so so anyway um if there's
19:19 - more that could be done with this I've
19:20 - missed so many pieces one thing that I
19:22 - actually missed that's important about
19:24 - chat bots are sequencing so one thing
19:27 - you can do is what if I have an example
19:30 - that's a knock-knock joke bot and so and
19:34 - that's actually from rive script I
19:35 - encourage you to check that out on the
19:37 - tutorial let's actually look for it but
19:40 - you can see something that's important
19:42 - here is about is the previous command so
19:45 - in other words the wild-card you want to
19:51 - you basically the user in a knock-knock
19:53 - joke
19:54 - the user can say anything I could just
19:56 - paste this in the user can say anything
19:58 - but do be the chat BOTS gonna say
20:01 - something different based on where you
20:03 - are in the sequence of the knock-knock
20:04 - joke so this is saying this is what the
20:07 - user this is what the chat bot should
20:09 - reply with after who is there has
20:13 - already happened and this is what should
20:15 - the chatbox your pilot after whoo so
20:18 - that's important okay
20:19 - I went off-track there so here is my
20:21 - number guessing chat bot with rice
20:24 - script and p5 I would love to see what
20:27 - kind of different chat pots you make
20:29 - with this same framework you know what
20:31 - happens if you like start querying api's
20:33 - and get there like the weather and have
20:34 - the bots talk about stuff and different
20:35 - topics or it's a programming questions
20:37 - or I don't know what you can make this
20:38 - bot do I look forward to seeing what you
20:40 - create from this video and in the next
20:44 - video I'm going to take exactly this I
20:46 - don't know if I'm gonna do this in the
20:47 - next video but in the next video or two
20:49 - I'm gonna do exactly this but with
20:51 - speech recognition so this conversation
20:53 - this guessing game could happen just
20:55 - purely in an auditory if that's the
20:57 - right word audio way okay things are
21:00 - clicking all over the place see you soon
21:02 - good bye
21:06 - [Music]
21:14 - you
