00:01 - Part three of my solar
system generating simulation
00:05 - thingamabob.
00:06 - This, by the way,
is not my example.
00:08 - This is an example
by Andres Colubri.
00:10 - It comes with Processing under
Examples, Demos, Graphics,
00:15 - Planets.
00:16 - You can take a look at it.
00:17 - It's using some similar stuff
that I'm using in my example,
00:20 - but the reason why
I'm pointing to it
00:21 - right now is, you'll notice that
the planets that you're seeing
00:24 - are not just plain old
spheres that are white
00:27 - or one single color.
00:28 - They have a texture to it,
a texture that is an image.
00:31 - So what I'm going
to show you now
00:32 - is how to add image
textures to a sphere,
00:35 - just like in this
example, in the one
00:36 - that I've been building.
00:37 - So the first thing is we
need some image textures.
00:39 - Boy, I would love
to make a video,
00:41 - somebody remind
me someday, of how
00:42 - to generate your own
texture using purlin noise,
00:45 - and you could
procedurally generate
00:46 - textures for all your planets.
00:47 - That's going to be a part
something to this eventually,
00:50 - but for now, what I'm going to
do is get some image textures.
00:52 - So Andres, in the
example here, you
00:55 - can see that he has a link
to a site called Planet Pixel
00:58 - Emporium.
00:59 - This is what the
site looks like.
01:00 - For example, down here,
I can click on Earth,
01:02 - and I can go down
here, and I can
01:03 - get this particular texture.
01:06 - It's just a rectangular
image, and what's
01:07 - going to happen in
processing is this image
01:09 - is going to be taken and
wrapped around that sphere.
01:12 - So how do you do that?
01:13 - So I've already
downloaded a bunch of--
01:15 - I'm going to close this.
01:16 - And I'm back-- this is my
example, if you don't recall.
01:19 - This is what it looks like.
01:21 - What I'm going to do is,
now, add the textures
01:23 - to these spheres.
01:24 - So I've already downloaded
a bunch of JPEG files.
01:27 - PNGs would work,
various file formats,
01:29 - and I've got them
in the Data folder.
01:31 - So I'm just going to
look at those real quick,
01:33 - and I'm going to actually
just rename these--
01:35 - earth.
01:37 - I should have done this before
I started-- mars, mercury,
01:42 - and sun.
01:43 - And all of these come from
that particular website,
01:47 - Planet Pixel Emporium.
01:48 - I will have a link to it in
this video's description.
01:50 - So what I'm going to do now is
I am going to say PImage, img,
01:57 - and then in setup, I'm going
to say loadImage sun.jpg.
02:02 - So the first thing I
need to do is just have
02:04 - that image loaded into a
variable, a variable of type
02:07 - PImage loaded into that.
02:09 - And now, I need this
image to somehow
02:10 - be attached to that sphere.
02:12 - Let's go to where we're
drawing the sphere.
02:14 - Now, I am drawing the
sphere right here.
02:17 - This is known as immediate
mode rendering, I think.
02:21 - Yes.
02:23 - Save mode-- The point is
I'm drawing this sphere,
02:26 - so it's calculating and
figuring out and making
02:28 - the sphere on the fly.
02:28 - There is something in Processing
called a PShape, which
02:31 - is an object that
can store geometry
02:34 - about any type of shape.
02:36 - So you can make a PShape that's
a geometry of a collection
02:39 - of shapes, that's a
custom polygon, that's
02:41 - a sphere, that's a rectangle.
02:42 - So what I need to do to
automatically texture
02:45 - this sphere is to use a
PShape variable, which
02:48 - will make it a little
bit easier to deal with.
02:50 - So I'm going to go back
up here and say, PShape.
02:54 - I'm going to add--
02:55 - every planet object is going
to have a PShape associated
02:58 - with it, and I'm going to call
that PShape globe because it's
03:01 - going to be a sphere.
03:01 - And then in Setup, I'm going
to say-- not in setup, sorry.
03:05 - In the planet's
constructor, I'm going
03:07 - to say globe equals createShape.
03:10 - So createShape is
the generic function
03:12 - to make a PShape object.
03:14 - You can make group PShapes.
03:17 - You can make primitive
PShapes, which
03:19 - is like rectangle,
ellipse, sphere, box.
03:22 - Or you can make custom
PShape, which are just set out
03:25 - of a lot of vertices,
and boy, this
03:27 - would be another great
topic for a video.
03:28 - But for right now, I'm going to
make a primitive PShape, which
03:31 - is just a sphere, and I also
need to give it some size.
03:35 - Guess what?
03:36 - I have the size
right there-- radius.
03:40 - Now, the other
thing I want to do,
03:42 - this is going to seem
a little bit strange,
03:43 - is right here, I'm going to
say no stroke and no fill
03:46 - because when I call
createShape, it's
03:49 - going to pick up
the stroke and fill
03:52 - that are currently assigned.
03:53 - There's all sorts of other ways.
03:54 - I think you can call a
setStroke or setFill,
03:57 - and then you can
change those later
03:58 - as the program is running.
03:59 - But for right now, I just
want a sphere with no stroke.
04:01 - And you know what, actually?
04:03 - What I want, just to make
sure this is working,
04:06 - is set the fill to 255.
04:08 - So I just want to have
my shape be white.
04:10 - I'm not going to add
the texture just yet.
04:11 - And now, the other thing
I'm going to change, now
04:13 - that I've made that PShape
object, is here, instead
04:16 - of drawing the sphere
with immediate rendering,
04:20 - I'm going to render that
precalculated save geometry,
04:23 - that sphere that
was already made.
04:25 - So I'm going to say,
now, shape globe.
04:31 - So the shape function renders
a particular PShape object
04:35 - to the scene, that
PShape being the globe.
04:38 - So if I run this, we have
exactly the same thing.
04:42 - And just to make sure this
is really doing what I think
04:44 - it's doing, let me do that.
04:49 - I'm afraid.
04:49 - Ah, yes, and now,
they're all red.
04:51 - So you can see how
this is working.
04:53 - Now, the thing is, I
actually don't want to fill.
04:56 - I want to say no
fill, and this is
04:58 - what is so wonderful
about working with PShapes
05:01 - and spheres and textures is
Processing, behind the scenes,
05:05 - will automatically
figure out how
05:07 - to do all of the mapping
of the image and the pixels
05:09 - to the [INAUDIBLE].
05:09 - There's all sorts of interesting
custom ways of doing this,
05:12 - but I can actually just
say globe setTexture img
05:16 - and run this.
05:18 - And magically, you can
see all of these planets
05:21 - now have that one Sun texture.
05:24 - I can zoom in, and you can see
it's that same texture on all
05:26 - of them.
05:27 - So we're kind of even--
05:28 - I didn't hit my
timer, so I don't
05:30 - know how long I've been going.
05:31 - But just a few minutes,
five minutes at the most,
05:33 - into this video, I already
have textures on these planets.
05:36 - So what do I want to do next?
05:38 - Well, I only want to have the
Sun texture on the center one,
05:41 - and then I want to have
other textures on the others.
05:44 - So let's figure
out how to do that.
05:45 - What I think might
make sense is to--
05:49 - I'm going to make a variable
called sunTexture to load that,
05:54 - and then I'm going to make
another variable, which
05:57 - I will make an array.
06:01 - Well, I'll just
call it textures.
06:04 - And how many do I have?
06:06 - I have 1, 2--
06:08 - I just have three.
06:09 - So let's have 3,
and then I'm going
06:12 - to say textures index
0 equals, and now,
06:18 - apologies for the tedium
of this, Mars, Earth.
06:25 - I'm going to load these just
manually into the array,
06:28 - manually setting
the index spots.
06:30 - Mars, Earth, Mercury.
06:32 - So now, where should the planet
get assigned its texture?
06:37 - I just globally
assigned it one, but I
06:39 - think what would make
sense is for the planet
06:44 - to have a particular-- actually,
I don't need a variable.
06:48 - What I just need here is to add
a fourth argument called image.
06:52 - So when I create a
planet, I give it
06:55 - a radius, a distance from
whatever it's orbiting around,
06:58 - that O is for an orbital
speed, and an image,
07:00 - which is its texture.
07:01 - So right now, I could
say, for example,
07:05 - make the Sun with
the sunTexture.
07:08 - And I could say here,
make every other planet
07:12 - with textures index 0,
which was, what, Mars.
07:17 - Let's do textures index 1
to be the Earth texture.
07:20 - So whenever I make
any other planets,
07:22 - make it textures
index 1, the Earth.
07:24 - And I could run this.
07:27 - I missed something important.
07:29 - Actually, I didn't, and you
can see now, look at that,
07:31 - because I now have
the Sun as the center,
07:34 - and all the other ones
have the Earth texture.
07:37 - This is getting good.
07:38 - Now, what I want to do,
though, is have each of these
07:41 - have a different texture.
07:42 - So what I could do-- where
did I assign that earthTexture
07:45 - was right here.
07:46 - There's no reason why I
couldn't get a random number.
07:48 - Oops, I already used
r, so let's just call
07:50 - this index and a random number
between 0 and textures.length.
07:55 - And then have that
be a random texture.
07:59 - So when I create the
planet, the radius shrinks,
08:02 - the distance is random, the
orbital speed is random,
08:04 - and the texture is a random one
from the other textures I have.
08:09 - And if I run this again,
and you can see now--
08:11 - I don't know why we
didn't get any Earth ones.
08:12 - Let's run this again.
08:16 - There we go.
08:17 - So you can see now--
08:18 - and by the way, funny
how I'm zooming,
08:20 - but I can actually just zoom in
Processing now because I have
08:22 - [INAUDIBLE].
08:24 - Never mind, I'm not
as good at doing that.
08:25 - You can see that
all of the planets
08:27 - have different textures,
and you can see--
08:29 - and it kind of
creates [INAUDIBLE]..
08:31 - Now, blah, blah, blah, I've
lost my ability to speak.
08:35 - So now, we have this
solar system thing.
08:36 - Now, there's a few more
things we could add to this.
08:38 - Number one, is it'll
be interesting to make
08:40 - the orbits elliptical.
08:41 - I'm going to leave that
as a thought experiment
08:43 - for anybody watching this video
to discuss in the comments
08:46 - and maybe post a
version of it, but you
08:48 - could think about how
that radius changes
08:50 - as it's orbiting.
08:51 - It gets wider.
08:52 - It gets shorter based on
the angle of rotation.
08:55 - That's something you might try.
08:56 - But what I want to
do now is just change
08:58 - the lighting a little bit.
08:59 - I think it would
be interesting to,
09:00 - instead of having
generic lighting,
09:02 - to actually have the lighting
come from the sun itself.
09:05 - The sun is bright, and as
things are orbiting it,
09:08 - you can see how different
parts of the planets
09:10 - might get the light
or not get the light.
09:12 - And so a way of
doing-- let's look
09:14 - in the Processing reference.
09:15 - I honestly don't a lot about--
09:17 - I have to live in fear of 3D.
09:21 - It's something I don't like
to do because it makes--
09:25 - I sometimes get a
stomach ache when I
09:26 - program things that are in 3D.
09:28 - But I want to go to Processing,
and I want to go to Reference,
09:31 - and I want to look for lights.
09:33 - And I'm going to
look here and see
09:34 - there's, all these
different functions
09:36 - for different kinds of lights.
09:38 - I encourage you to explore them.
09:41 - But I want to look
at point light.
09:43 - What point light does
is it adds a light,
09:45 - and you can see it has six
arguments-- the red, green,
09:52 - and blue value, so what
color is that light, and then
09:56 - the coordinate of the light.
09:57 - Well, this is really easy.
09:58 - I want a bright white
light from where the sun
10:01 - is, which is at the center.
10:03 - So I can actually
go back to my scene
10:05 - now, go back to the main
draw, and right here,
10:10 - instead of saying lights, I can
say pointLight, bright white,
10:16 - and at the centers of
the world, 0, 0, 0.
10:19 - So let's run this--
actually not tried this.
10:22 - I'm just assuming that
it's going to work.
10:23 - And look at that, you
can see now-- now,
10:26 - interestingly enough,
you can't see the sun.
10:29 - I kind of love this, though.
10:31 - The sun is not
getting its own light.
10:33 - So I don't know how
best to remedy that,
10:36 - but we could also try turning
the generic lights on.
10:41 - And it's not as
effective because--
10:47 - but I could probably
shine a spotlight
10:50 - on the sun or something.
10:51 - I don't know.
10:51 - I don't really
mind that, though.
10:53 - But anyway, you can see that
the effect is not as strong.
10:55 - Somebody watching this
video will come up
10:58 - with a nice way of lighting
the sun and the other planets.
11:01 - But I like this effect of being
able to see that shadowing.
11:06 - And maybe we could--
11:09 - what would be interesting
is to actually put lights
11:11 - on some of the other planets
to see how that works.
11:13 - Oh, there's all sorts
of possibilities there,
11:14 - but I've got to stop.
11:15 - I think I've given
you some tools here.
11:17 - I've given you a way
of creating spheres
11:20 - as an object, of rotating
spheres around other spheres,
11:23 - having those things be nested,
having textures texture
11:25 - those spheres, and
a little bit more
11:27 - on how you might light the
scene in creative ways.
11:29 - So I hope you will explore this.
11:30 - Something else you
can do is put an image
11:32 - as the background,
maybe a star field.
11:34 - You can see, in Andres'
example, how that works.
11:36 - I'll link to the
code for that example
11:38 - as well in the description, but
make some creative experiments
11:41 - with this.
11:42 - Think about elliptical orbits.
11:43 - Be more thoughtful.
11:44 - Could you actually make
sun and the planets
11:48 - that are in our solar system?
11:49 - Would you choose to
include Pluto or not
11:52 - or some other new
planetary discoveries?
11:55 - Can you put a ring
around Saturn?
11:56 - How might you do that?
11:57 - Oh, all sorts of
interesting possibilities,
11:58 - so I encourage you
to explore that stuff
12:00 - and share with me your solar
system Processing sketches.
