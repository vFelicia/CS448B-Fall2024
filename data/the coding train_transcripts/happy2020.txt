05:07 - and ten nine eight seven six five four
05:15 - three two one
05:20 - and you're live oh wait no it's me I'm
05:23 - not your life no I live I have you you
05:26 - were me
05:26 - we are we I don't know whatever okay
05:29 - hello good afternoon
05:31 - happy 2020 2020 which does not in any
05:36 - way whatsoever remotely describe my
05:38 - vision which is about 28,000 I cannot
05:41 - see anything
05:42 - this is really how I should live stream
05:44 - without my glasses I cannot see a thing
05:46 - at all I am taking swimming lessons I do
05:49 - know how to swim but I don't know why
05:51 - I'm bringing this up first but I wanted
05:53 - to exercise more I do exercise quite a
05:56 - bit I ran the marathon last year but I
05:57 - would like to develop some more full
05:59 - body fitness and I thought swimming
06:02 - might be a good thing for me to try both
06:05 - of my kids are very good swimmers and I
06:07 - notice they could swim much better than
06:09 - I can so I went to sign them up for swim
06:12 - lessons I signed myself up for swim
06:13 - lessons they are Stage four and six I am
06:16 - in level three why was I talking about
06:19 - this oh because I had to take my glasses
06:21 - off and I can't see anybody in the class
06:23 - I can't see the teacher put
06:24 - on goggles it's very awkward and I
06:26 - actually like I discovered I the teacher
06:29 - thought I was left-handed which I am
06:31 - right-handed because I was breathing in
06:32 - the wrong direction so much to talk
06:35 - about with the swimming lessons but that
06:37 - is not really what I'm here to talk
06:40 - about today I am here on the coding
06:43 - train in 2020 in 2020 to do a lot of new
06:48 - tutorials and coding challenges and fun
06:50 - stuff and hopefully upgrade the systems
06:52 - and various things with which I engage
06:55 - with the community here just quick shout
06:58 - out to Cody garden with CJ who was in
07:00 - the chat
07:00 - I was watching CJ stream this morning
07:02 - and in he has some really incredible
07:04 - systems that he's built to interact with
07:07 - the community and manage content which
07:09 - is really inspiring and wonderful I
07:10 - encourage you to check that out if you
07:13 - haven't somebody post
07:16 - cj's I'll link to see his channel in the
07:20 - chat if you could and I owe the reason
07:24 - why I'm also mentioning this is because
07:25 - one of the big things on my list of
07:27 - topics today is talk about the new
07:30 - coding train Oh discord and a lot of
07:37 - what I'm doing with the discord has been
07:38 - modeled from coding Gardens discord
07:41 - which is a quite vibrant growing if you
07:46 - will
07:46 - community so I wanted to show the
07:50 - discord and talk about the discord in a
07:51 - moment but I have one other random non
07:55 - sequitur arrived to other well once not
07:57 - a random non sequitur because it is the
07:59 - sponsor of today's livestream whoops
08:01 - wrong button
08:02 - come back here - lame
08:06 - so I will talk a little bit more about
08:07 - dashlane during the intermission of the
08:10 - livestream but you can check out -
08:11 - laying at - late calm slash coding train
08:14 - it is a password manager I can't live in
08:17 - this world without a password manager
08:19 - and if you don't have one you can get a
08:22 - 30-day free trial - - lien premium just
08:25 - by going to that link and also a
08:26 - discount if you choose to purchase
08:27 - premium ok
08:29 - so the other thing that I wanted to
08:31 - mention and bring up is
08:36 - I was I felt like I was gonna try to
08:38 - like spontaneously segue into this
08:40 - organically which is what I did with the
08:42 - swimming thing which I did not intend to
08:44 - talk about but I just wanted to mention
08:46 - something new that I'm also doing in
08:47 - 2020 let's see if I can go to money
08:49 - pause rescue as I am fostering a dog and
08:52 - I hope to foster more dogs currently
08:55 - let's see adopt with uh this is not a
08:58 - sponsor there's no like official
08:59 - relationship here between oh you can't
09:01 - see my laptop here we go
09:08 - how's biz willing says I could go it BTB
09:12 - suggests I can get prescription swimming
09:14 - goggles I know is it worth it I mean
09:17 - maybe I should I don't know how
09:18 - expensive that is but I will consider
09:21 - that I loved seeing all the coating
09:22 - garden emojis in the in the chat I wish
09:27 - there's a way like in discord I've
09:29 - enjoying how you can kind of share some
09:30 - of the emojis across different servers
09:32 - but okay I'm off I'm off track I'm well
09:33 - I'm already I'm off track I'm up the off
09:36 - track I'm always off track that's what
09:39 - the coding drain does it veers off track
09:41 - and now I am off the off track which is
09:43 - if I get off off the off off track we're
09:46 - really we know where everything is lost
09:48 - we're in big trouble there so this so I
09:53 - wanted to just mention I don't know if
09:54 - you're in the New York City area if
09:55 - you're thinking about adopting a dog or
09:58 - fostering a dog the dog that I'm
10:00 - fostering right now is Rover there is uh
10:03 - you can really recognize Rover from the
10:06 - Kota Gede the Cabana set it's not really
10:08 - a set actually old very small garden
10:11 - where I live in Brooklyn
10:12 - that's Rover he is nine months old we
10:16 - think man that's what a muddy paws has
10:19 - aged put his age at um he was found tied
10:22 - to a tree and rescued by muddy paws in
10:24 - Kentucky and brought to New York we're
10:26 - gonna grandpa and so and he's currently
10:33 - living at ma with me and my family but
10:36 - on Saturday I don't know if like news
10:38 - here or calendar probably under calendar
10:43 - if you want to meet Rover you can go to
10:45 - their adoption event
10:48 - which is this one no this one adoption
10:52 - event pre-scheduled these are I guess
10:55 - he's at the pre scheduled meetings and a
10:56 - walk up another dog there okay I just
10:58 - wanted to mention that I've five
11:00 - hopefully I'm going to continue to
11:01 - foster more dogs I don't know if I'm
11:02 - ready for the full commitment of I have
11:04 - two cats as you know you can follow them
11:06 - on Instagram at mango and goose become
11:12 - just that I have a platform now it's
11:14 - grown over the years it's kind of
11:16 - exciting and fun and I can like promote
11:18 - my random weird stuff just and people
11:20 - will watch it listen I don't know it's a
11:23 - little bit weird but that's or MIDI but
11:24 - I will get to the coding stuff and all
11:26 - the things that you're actually here for
11:29 - [Music]
11:31 - Jordan says I missed the train
11:34 - chugga-chugga chugga-chugga choo-choo by
11:37 - the way I'm wearing a new shirt it's
11:39 - pineapple shirt I'm wearing a sweater
11:41 - because it's winter but it's already the
11:43 - temperature just keeps going up and up
11:44 - in this room as I stream so I'm sure
11:46 - this sweater will come up the mouth
11:47 - eventually Cassandra says thanks for
11:50 - fostering a dog thank you for writing
11:53 - thank you for fostering a dog and there
11:58 - we go oh yeah I woke up I wake up now at
12:00 - this morning I woke up at 5:45 a.m. and
12:03 - took a rover on a walk at 6:00 a.m.
12:04 - which I would know you know I wake up
12:06 - early anyway because I got kids I got to
12:08 - go to school I got stuff to do but
12:11 - there's something about it's dark out
12:14 - it's New York City there's nobody there
12:16 - it's very empty on the street I have to
12:19 - say I feel so like kind of corny but
12:22 - alive and awake by taking this he's a
12:24 - very large dog which it's a little bit
12:27 - tricky to handle I don't have a lot of
12:28 - experience the muddy paws has been very
12:30 - kind to give us tips and we're sort of
12:32 - trying to train him and you know you've
12:34 - had all sorts of issues to start because
12:36 - he had been living outside you know like
12:38 - what it means to go on a walk but anyway
12:42 - I could talk about this forever I'm good
12:44 - I'm gonna stop now as chirag says let's
12:47 - start coding I would just say it's not
12:50 - so likely that I'm gonna start coding
12:53 - anytime in the next few minutes but I
12:56 - will get to it hopefully by 2 o'clock
12:58 - I'll be here for a couple hours too
13:01 - all right so what were some of the other
13:03 - things alright let's get to the big news
13:04 - big news I am revamping and relaunching
13:09 - a lot of things related to the kind of
13:13 - community interaction membership
13:15 - supporter stuff so I kind of wanna
13:18 - because I'm gonna talk about both of
13:19 - those things together let me just pull
13:21 - up the discord because that's really
13:23 - where it's all happening so this is the
13:27 - coding train a discord server I am a
13:30 - complete and total discord newb as the
13:35 - boobers would say oh wait this is
13:39 - buzzing I must catch this Pokemon for a
13:43 - second gonna catch it catch it
13:49 - I wonder what it is hey I'm just gonna
13:53 - be doing this because the camera doesn't
13:55 - shut off as much and I'll have a button
13:56 - to press I got it I need a button to
13:57 - press every 30 minutes this might be a
13:59 - little bit more often than every 30
14:00 - minutes I think I'm gonna have to put
14:02 - that away a problem I have a problem I
14:07 - know it's 20/20 and I am holding a pok√©
14:12 - ball plus catching a Pokemon a Pokemon
14:16 - go to other - my thumb and I am a 46
14:20 - year old human being on this planet
14:22 - doing that okay gotta catch them all um
14:27 - I do need to go to the barber shop
14:30 - that's not what Lucas said he said nice
14:31 - beard but I died I'm just I don't like
14:35 - doing it money okay discord so I'm
14:39 - totally new to discord previously there
14:41 - was there were two things that existed
14:43 - previously there was an unofficial
14:45 - discord which is what you're actually
14:47 - seeing here which was set up and
14:49 - maintained by nola one two two two two
14:52 - some number of tubes by their username I
14:55 - also ran a slack channel which was a
14:58 - private slack channel for YouTube
15:01 - members and patrons and sometimes I
15:03 - would invite various other people there
15:05 - if they were contributors or
15:07 - collaborators in some particular way to
15:08 - the coding terrain or related things
15:12 - I don't the we so in 2020 we have I have
15:15 - decided we along with a lot of people's
15:17 - help to consolidate these two things so
15:20 - there is no longer a slack channel for
15:22 - the coding drain it still exists and
15:23 - somebody could post there and I probably
15:24 - get a notification somewhere but I am
15:26 - deprecating that in lieu of this discord
15:30 - so this was a existing discord a lot of
15:32 - you may be watching are already members
15:34 - were members we've redesigned it a bit a
15:36 - lot of help from side the coding trained
15:39 - community manager who is a pictured in
15:41 - the top right up there under the
15:42 - conductor role as well as various
15:49 - discord experts and moderators notably
15:51 - Coby L and Noah and then a lot of other
15:56 - people who are there under station
15:58 - manager which is the moderator because
15:59 - I'm trying by the way I spend way too
16:01 - much time on a Wikipedia page called
16:03 - like list of railway occupations trying
16:06 - to figure out how to name things I
16:08 - really should have gone with the garden
16:10 - thing and so it you know you got plants
16:12 - and buds and see all that it's great
16:14 - this train stuff it's very confusing I
16:16 - mean I had the rainbow the rainbow was a
16:18 - good start I could have gone with colors
16:19 - so many options there so this is now
16:27 - publicly joinable please there's a link
16:30 - in this video's description already
16:32 - underneath a couple things maybe but if
16:35 - one of you who is a moderator could post
16:38 - the link to the invite in the chat right
16:40 - now you can join and so I you know
16:45 - there's a lot of stuff to figure out in
16:47 - terms of how this is going to work what
16:49 - I would ask of you and this is an
16:51 - ongoing working document I would say is
16:54 - please read the when you join read the
16:56 - Welcome channel so the Welcome Channel
16:59 - and thank you I'm like constantly
17:00 - referencing codon garden today but thank
17:03 - you to CJ and the coding garden who has
17:05 - a wonderful welcome channel of which we
17:07 - took some inspiration from to design
17:09 - this so this has a little bit of guide
17:11 - to what the different channels are I
17:14 - think the thing to highlight here is
17:16 - that if you're looking for coding help
17:17 - this is now a place in addition to lots
17:20 - of other places previously if anybody
17:22 - ever emailed me or tweeted
17:23 - usually say go to the processing
17:25 - discourse which is a forum online and if
17:28 - you have p5 are processing questions
17:30 - that's really your best bet so I still
17:33 - would say go to the processing discourse
17:35 - for general questions and discussion
17:36 - it's a kind of official place to get
17:39 - help but I also now have these discord
17:42 - channels and there are some things here
17:44 - that come up on this channel hi-5 really
17:46 - probably shouldn't be related to get
17:48 - related to machine learning related to
17:50 - no js' that you could also ask here so
17:55 - try to use these categories try to you
17:58 - know there's a nice community of people
18:00 - answering questions there I don't know
18:02 - I've been very active in it like today
18:04 - and yesterday because I'm on break now
18:06 - for men why that goes back in the
18:08 - session I'll probably disappear for the
18:10 - large part but we'll be checking in and
18:12 - participating there is also you can't
18:14 - see it but there it let's see what else
18:16 - should I highlight Oh
18:19 - if you've ever wanted to get a
18:21 - notification for me when I'm thinking
18:23 - about what I might live stream I will do
18:26 - hope to get a regular schedule going I
18:29 - think I might switch to Thursdays this
18:31 - semester once I get the sort of rhythm
18:33 - of things going but oh and in fee is
18:37 - asking will there be a channel for
18:40 - normal web JavaScript rather than p5
18:43 - sure we could add one for I I don't want
18:45 - to like have too many but if if there is
18:48 - a lot of JavaScript questions that don't
18:50 - relate to p5 or node I think that could
18:52 - make sense so I'm game for that I could
18:54 - see somebody won't ask about he's
18:55 - thinking a weight or something so yes
18:59 - Python could change to other but I think
19:02 - yeah my alright let's not talk about
19:05 - that too much so that's that what else
19:11 - oh so uh so in this channel schedule
19:15 - what I'm going to now do is there is a
19:19 - roll if you're not familiar with discord
19:21 - hello I mean either welcome thank you
19:24 - for learning about this with me
19:26 - but there's a thing called a roll so you
19:29 - can self a son we haven't set this up
19:31 - yet but you'll be able to self assign
19:33 - yourself the roll at notifications
19:36 - and then you can then receive a
19:39 - notification from me within discord
19:41 - earlier than when a YouTube event will
19:44 - be created so my process is as follows
19:47 - my livestream this Friday hmm what time
19:51 - I'm not really sure it might be Thursday
19:53 - that's just me and my own agony at home
19:55 - or in the middle of the night aren't
19:57 - walking this foster dog then eventually
20:00 - I catch oh no no I'm really gonna do it
20:01 - on Friday and then I will come in here
20:04 - and post a notification like hey I'm
20:05 - gonna live sure one Friday not sure the
20:07 - time yet and then I'll decide have the
20:09 - time like oh it's gonna be at 1:00 p.m.
20:10 - Eastern Time
20:11 - probably and then oh no actually it's
20:14 - really gonna be 1:30 and then I'll post
20:16 - that and also make a public event so the
20:19 - public event usually appears on YouTube
20:20 - but I'm really solidified into the time
20:22 - because I hate to change that sometimes
20:24 - I go a little wiggle room there I'll
20:26 - make it 15 minutes later 15 minutes
20:28 - earlier but I thought process baby
20:31 - and then it's not gonna spam you but
20:33 - yeah so if you want to like be clued in
20:36 - a bit more on when I'm live-streaming
20:37 - there and I'll also use that for other
20:39 - things like I'm launching a new
20:41 - merchandise store which I could show you
20:45 - some images and things of stuff I've
20:47 - mentioned it before I don't man I don't
20:49 - want to like go to off the rails the
20:52 - great thing about the train metaphor is
20:56 - the off the rails and off track stuff
20:58 - which is very on the nose for the coding
21:01 - train and I also really am excited to do
21:07 - some tutorials around making a discord
21:10 - bot or a coding challenge and there is
21:12 - an open-source train bot that NOLA set
21:15 - up and there's the coding train cafe
21:18 - assignment is mentioning so there's
21:21 - gonna be a lot more here to happen in
21:23 - the future this year 2020 is the year of
21:25 - the coding train discord okay
21:30 - if you have questions and concerns so
21:33 - let me go back to the Welcome channel so
21:35 - these are the different channels if you
21:37 - choose to subscribe as a YouTube member
21:39 - maybe I'll come back and talk about that
21:41 - there are some additional channels like
21:44 - we have a secondary live chat going here
21:48 - at that I see separate from the YouTube
21:51 - chat work as the YouTube chat sometimes
21:53 - just has a lot of messages that I can't
21:54 - follow but an important suggestion or
21:56 - tidbit goes in there there are some
21:58 - rewards that you can get that are listed
22:00 - you know just all I'm happy to have
22:03 - discussion about suggestions and either
22:04 - place
22:05 - I don't like this idea of a tiered
22:06 - system but I don't that doesn't it's not
22:09 - something that I love but you know there
22:11 - is a need for sort of curation and
22:13 - there's a practical reality of you know
22:15 - you know how large a group can be so it
22:18 - helps to have this or a subset group and
22:21 - yeah and I'll take a peek and there's a
22:23 - channel there where you can ask me
22:24 - questions so there are different roles
22:26 - here there's the conductor's the owner
22:28 - and it's also psy there's the admins
22:30 - which is sighs so give any questions
22:32 - about the community or concerns you
22:35 - could reach out to psy they speak for
22:37 - the coding train and then there's lots
22:40 - of other people who are volunteer
22:41 - moderators and admins under dispatcher
22:44 - dispatcher and station manager signal
22:46 - metate maintainer is for people a part
22:48 - of like the production team like Matt
22:49 - Chu who does the video editing and
22:51 - violet who's been helping to manage
22:53 - github repos and Chloe is working on
22:56 - some projects as well and then there's a
22:58 - role for community members who want to
23:00 - kind of take a volunteer mentor and
23:03 - question-answering
23:03 - a role engineer you know with the train
23:06 - now go with the train metaphor not like
23:08 - some techie thing maybe there's a better
23:09 - maybe there maybe they should be a
23:12 - wonder I don't know to get taker that
23:15 - doesn't make sense so that could be you
23:17 - watching right now you could be an
23:18 - engineer and you don't have to be an
23:19 - expert you just have to be a thoughtful
23:21 - helpful person who wants to spend some
23:23 - time answering questions and that so the
23:27 - other thing that I that's really
23:28 - important for me to highlight this is
23:30 - that that has existed for quite some
23:33 - time it's in a github repo which is
23:35 - linked down here but this is the coding
23:37 - train code of conduct I this is required
23:43 - reading for participating we will take
23:46 - this very seriously and this is there is
23:53 - a reporting process so the reporting
23:56 - process for if someone is in violation
23:58 - of the code of contact there are two
24:00 - email addresses info at the coding train
24:02 - how much will go to sy and me this is my
24:05 - coding train comm email address and size
24:07 - coding train comm email address so if we
24:09 - were reporting a code of conduct
24:11 - violations on me which is well within
24:13 - your right I guess I would suggest
24:15 - sending that to sy and vice versa if
24:17 - that makes sense
24:18 - but all of us are required and are sort
24:21 - of buying into this code of conduct okay
24:27 - so and then so and then you can this I
24:31 - love I love this which came from CJ
24:33 - maybe other people do this as well but
24:35 - you can react within emoji you can pick
24:36 - your own emoji and it's just so fun to
24:38 - see I didn't know I'd become a person
24:40 - who loves emojis
24:43 - I would ask actually I just to do a
24:45 - little education here to not use the
24:47 - okay hand there's no way for me to
24:48 - remove that but the okay hand has
24:50 - unfortunately been co-opted by some
24:53 - organizations in the United States that
24:54 - I usually press a symbol of hate and so
24:57 - you know it's a no harm no foul I'm sure
24:59 - people don't know about it there's a
25:00 - really good website maybe I'll try to
25:02 - find it that that explains this in more
25:05 - detail that I was looking at recently
25:08 - and I had the name escapes me but so oh
25:12 - and thank you too random Hanser hamster
25:15 - for the super chat hello okay
25:17 - the self assigning ah okay Co BL tells
25:20 - me the self assigning roles are working
25:22 - so just so you know I am logged in right
25:25 - now as a user called coding trained live
25:27 - which you can see here which is not my
25:30 - actual account in discord
25:32 - I just don't know it well enough that I
25:35 - don't want to make a mistake so this is
25:36 - just a generic account that doesn't have
25:38 - access to the supportive channels or the
25:41 - any of the admin channels but you can
25:43 - see how to join here but the thing that
25:48 - I'm gonna try now then is I'm gonna go
25:50 - here so maybe I need to need to make
25:52 - everything a little bigger also and I
25:55 - guess I can turn off like all the
25:57 - people's names here on the side I'm
26:00 - going to say oh I do not have permission
26:02 - of course not I do not have permission
26:04 - let's go - where do we do a bot spam
26:07 - okay so I think if I in here I say TR
26:11 - exclamation points subscribe
26:15 - then now I have the notifications roll
26:18 - and I will be notified that's wonderful
26:21 - Oh tonight subscriber tonight get your
26:26 - Pokemon I'm not really sure
26:28 - oh you can actually remove reactions
26:31 - with your main account right-click
26:32 - reactions okay hand X button okay hip
26:37 - chocolate chip asks is this person a
26:41 - professor or does he do YouTube
26:42 - full-time I do not do YouTube full-time
26:45 - i a very lucky a privileged person to
26:50 - have this full time job at New York
26:53 - University where I teach I suppose I
26:55 - have a professor that sounds a weird to
26:57 - say to me reason I should get over that
26:59 - I guess at this point and I am actually
27:03 - broadcasting live from here and it's
27:06 - actually if this is relate to the
27:08 - membership stuff because it's this is a
27:11 - very tricky line for me to walk and I
27:13 - have a lot of freedom to do whatever I
27:16 - kind of want to do but I really try to
27:18 - be thoughtful and think about what is
27:19 - appropriate it makes sense and how to
27:21 - think about the revenue that this coding
27:24 - train entity produces all right that
27:27 - earns for me and so um so let me let me
27:31 - just start by so yes I have a full-time
27:33 - job coding trig YouTube could go away
27:36 - disappear be deleted Cody Trent could be
27:39 - canceled and I would be okay
27:43 - oh I think we would all be okay the
27:46 - world doesn't nice thing but anyway so
27:52 - but the coding train for me I'm running
27:55 - as a little bit of like a small business
27:56 - or a side job it is very intertwined
28:00 - with my job at NYU my work with
28:03 - processing Foundation which is a
28:04 - non-profit I got to put this away it's
28:08 - way too distracting and and what I and
28:16 - it does cost money too
28:19 - for me to maintain mostly in the form of
28:23 - me hiring people to help work on it with
28:25 - me so that's one of the things mostly
28:27 - that you are supporting is the people
28:31 - that I have hired that I don't do all
28:33 - this myself I started it that way but
28:36 - the animations you're seeing the logo
28:38 - the community management the video
28:41 - editing the management of the github
28:43 - repos there's a lot of volunteers who
28:45 - participate and I really appreciate that
28:47 - I want to encourage a volunteer spirit
28:49 - but I also think it's important to pay
28:52 - people for work so there's a difference
28:53 - there and so that's mostly what I am
28:57 - using the funds for they equip a lot of
28:59 - the equipment I use is borrowed or from
29:02 - NYU this is a shared space that other
29:03 - people use to make video tutorials I'm
29:05 - going on way too long about this I
29:07 - should get off that channel oh dear okay
29:12 - what channels do I get I'll just going
29:13 - to minimize this now people are just you
29:20 - know there's a lot of gray hair here
29:22 - people talk about my age in the chat so
29:27 - I feel conflicted often about the
29:31 - supporters of so I would say but what is
29:34 - it ah so I also have sponsors those earn
29:36 - money for the channel on some videos I
29:39 - do enable the YouTube ads one of the
29:43 - choices that I've made is that if it's a
29:45 - video that I'm using specifically for a
29:47 - course that I'm teaching at NYU or that
29:49 - I know is being used in school
29:51 - curriculum and I know that could be
29:52 - anything really but there's some that
29:53 - are really integrated in curriculum then
29:55 - I turn the ads off if you are a teacher
29:59 - at a school where you're showing the
30:01 - videos and there's ads on them and you
30:03 - don't that's it that's an issue for you
30:05 - just let me know I would gladly turn
30:06 - them off or certain playlists or certain
30:09 - videos that's so that's that's sort of
30:12 - the state of things so if you want to
30:14 - join in support so if you have the means
30:16 - to support the Kodi drain first I would
30:19 - say ask yourself is there another worthy
30:21 - cause you have limited funds maybe the
30:23 - processing foundation is one maybe a dog
30:25 - organization that rescues dogs is
30:28 - another there's lots of wonderful
30:30 - organizations and maybe another content
30:32 - creator
30:33 - who you could support as well but if you
30:36 - choose to support the coding train right
30:40 - now I'm asking you to do that through
30:42 - YouTube so if I go back to the discord
30:44 - and if I go under how to join this would
30:50 - be the link that you would go to and I
30:53 - think I don't know what this is gonna
30:54 - take me to now and okay I got to update
30:58 - this video cuz it's not it's I made it a
31:00 - while ago
31:01 - so there are three different levels I am
31:05 - now tier to show you what you get these
31:07 - are the stickers now for that everyone
31:10 - will get it in pale might take a while
31:12 - but sigh thankfully is helping with this
31:14 - and some new stickers this is an
31:18 - exclusive sticker whatever that means
31:21 - won't be sold in the merchandise store
31:23 - you can only get it if I mail it to you
31:25 - it's also on my laptop here along with
31:27 - some CJ stickers some quick draw this is
31:30 - open moji project which I love whereas I
31:32 - can you see it I don't know
31:34 - so those those everybody gets at the
31:40 - nine dollar and 99 cent level I just
31:43 - make it ten dollars it's ridiculous I
31:45 - mean nobody thinks it's really less than
31:48 - ten dollars you okay I have a box of
31:52 - these train whistles wooden train
31:54 - whistles that really don't make the
31:57 - right sound unfortunately oh I might try
31:59 - a different better this is the one I got
32:01 - off Amazon but it already says train
32:03 - whistle and I don't know that these are
32:05 - produced I don't know who makes this one
32:07 - toy train whistle but these they're
32:12 - really two o'clock already it really is
32:16 - this train whistle i am i planning with
32:19 - psy and i are going to work on laser
32:21 - etching then so at ITP where I work we
32:24 - have laser cutters there's also a UV
32:26 - printer if anybody knows what that is
32:27 - that I could try UV printing on them
32:30 - whatever that is there's actually this
32:32 - giant vinyl cutter that I'm also playing
32:35 - with where I can maybe like cut and make
32:36 - my own stickers so many things coming in
32:38 - the new year and then under engineers
32:41 - I'm making this nice little like
32:43 - notebook which I will talk about later
32:47 - um what are the membership perks more
32:51 - its Horst is asking I think I probably
32:53 - just cover covered those three super
32:59 - chats came in how do I find those where
33:06 - I find those super chats
33:17 - come I don't see them new stickers says
33:22 - Alka indeed alright so anyway that's all
33:30 - I am I was everything was going so well
33:32 - I mean it wasn't going never goes well
33:34 - it's getting warmer in here thank you
33:37 - for tuning in and watching all right I
33:38 - got to get to some coding stuff now
33:40 - gotta start doing the real deal play the
33:52 - livestream at 2 XP to get as low as a 14
33:54 - second delay says Alka alright so what
34:01 - do I want to program today I had a list
34:04 - I'm gonna go find it oh let me let me
34:07 - actually mention one thing about other
34:08 - thing about the discord let me go to
34:10 - introductions so if you're new I can see
34:13 - that some people are already introducing
34:15 - themselves here oh look at this and
34:16 - there's a little bit of a template for
34:19 - that if you have ideas for how to make
34:21 - this better
34:22 - where are you from I'm just curious a
34:25 - lot of people are students or maybe
34:26 - you're a teacher so that could say if
34:27 - you're a student or a teacher or maybe
34:29 - work somewhere I'm always curious about
34:30 - that almost curious how you found the
34:32 - coding train your favorite or first
34:34 - coding language or something other
34:35 - hobbies or interests you have so please
34:37 - I'm trying to introduce yourself if you
34:39 - have a moment in in the community all
34:41 - right all right looks like a lot of new
34:49 - this this by the way is a where is the
34:52 - passenger log is the is the automated
34:57 - bot posting people as they join which
35:00 - looks like a lot of people are joining
35:01 - now which is super fun and exciting I
35:08 - have a like
35:11 - I'm not playing oh please explain
35:14 - I have a intermission whoops
35:19 - why is it showing this and it realize
35:23 - that the - claim benefit which is fine
35:26 - all right I'm taking it's not an
35:28 - intermission right now just need a
35:30 - moment should have a way of putting
35:32 - myself in front of this fine you can
35:36 - watch all the people chewing it okay let
35:52 - me find my list of things oh I think
35:54 - it's in them I think it's in the video
35:57 - description actually
36:06 - there we go okay this is my list I'm not
36:17 - gonna get to all of this I mean I'll be
36:19 - lucky if I get to like here I mean I
36:22 - have to do this I've committed and
36:23 - agreed to that
36:25 - I guess I've talked about all this stuff
36:28 - [Music]
36:29 - so so the first so I think I'm gonna
36:36 - start with going back and revisiting the
36:38 - pose classifier Coby tells me that 84
36:43 - people have joined the discord since the
36:47 - start of the stream which is quite a lot
36:49 - of people so yeah so alright so let me
36:57 - go to the website first of all thank you
37:00 - to violet and some other folks who I'm
37:02 - apologies are nice pull requests which
37:04 - shows different people's contributions
37:05 - who have helped to redo the navigation
37:09 - of the coding train website which is
37:10 - hopefully going to make it easier to
37:12 - find the videos you're looking for so
37:14 - these are the three beginner playlists
37:18 - these are additional lists of like
37:21 - different kinds of collections of
37:23 - learning content there's a few things
37:25 - under this more category and this says
37:28 - how to add your own community
37:30 - contribution let me mention this is not
37:32 - this project is alive and kicking it is
37:35 - winter I actually had time on Thursday
37:38 - which is yesterday to do the next coding
37:40 - in the Cabana video which will be on the
37:42 - hilbert curve Rodrigo says read my
37:45 - question on the Pathfinder video okay I
37:50 - might need a link to that so but I was
37:57 - too cold
37:58 - I know heat in the Cabana and it was
38:01 - like 22 degrees Fahrenheit yesterday so
38:04 - I'm gonna wait till at least I think
38:06 - it's got to be in the 40s okay so where
38:10 - I was going here is under ml5 Jess
38:12 - beginner's guide so this was my 2019
38:15 - project
38:18 - which was - this is my 2019 project
38:26 - which was to really work on this series
38:30 - and some great questions being asked in
38:34 - the chat that I would like to get to now
38:37 - I understand I understand all of cj's
38:39 - systems down why how they're useful so
38:44 - but I didn't get as far as I wanted so
38:47 - I'm playing a little catch-up on this
38:48 - series and so that's what I'm gonna
38:50 - start with I'm gonna answer a couple
38:51 - these questions it's coding the Cabana
38:53 - always math-related
38:54 - or is there something data related it's
38:55 - not always math related I was sort of
38:57 - starting trying to start with the theme
38:59 - of things that are kind of algorithmic
39:01 - and nature related but that could it
39:03 - could really go and and - anywhere and
39:06 - actually would love to do something data
39:07 - related there's a wonderful data set
39:08 - that is a dataset on all the trees in
39:11 - New York City which I could do something
39:13 - on so we can remind me put that
39:14 - somewhere and yes jazz it down is asking
39:24 - is there a site I can learn how to use
39:26 - p5 so not to toot my own train whistle
39:31 - but I would say the place is right here
39:33 - under the coding train table under
39:35 - beginners under p5 yes this is my
39:38 - beginner playlist this is one of the
39:40 - ones that's used the most in curriculum
39:42 - so it doesn't have any ads on it and
39:46 - that fits with my budget just fine okay
39:50 - all right I'm really so confused about
39:54 - all this stuff or what am i doing so the
39:57 - video learning and a 5-bit so the next
40:03 - video to appear on this playlist which
40:05 - is currently being edited from the
40:07 - recent live stream is making a pose
40:11 - classifier I would love to somebody
40:15 - somebody gave me a soup I don't know how
40:17 - to manage superjet and then the good
40:19 - question now I'm feeling all this like
40:21 - stress over it but I do want to answer
40:23 - that question that came in but I don't I
40:24 - don't know what the question was or how
40:25 - to find it I don't know what the
40:26 - pathfinder video is
40:29 - so please get in touch um but actually
40:35 - just like disable my super chance anyway
40:39 - ml5 jf because it distracts easily
40:44 - distractible @c now so the next video
40:46 - that's coming out is about making a pose
40:48 - classifier and I and match jube is as
40:53 - saying a suggestion use ml5 pose net to
40:56 - make a game based on your position and
40:57 - so one of the things you could have you
40:59 - could do with the video that I am about
41:03 - to release with the example that I'm
41:04 - about to show you is make a controller
41:06 - so you know if you go back to my snake
41:08 - game example you could make a controller
41:09 - where you control the snake based on a
41:11 - pose but that video is not out yet and
41:14 - one of the reasons why it's not out yet
41:15 - is I mean quite a big error Oh anybody
41:18 - noticed it it worked anyway without this
41:21 - error but I want to cover that error and
41:23 - fix the code and then record a quick
41:25 - green screen correction and I have not
41:32 - tried c-sharp but I do watch Sebastian
41:35 - lag on YouTube who has a lot of c-sharp
41:40 - unity code I believe okay triple dots in
41:48 - the live chat and correct click Super
41:50 - chats Thank You CJ yeah I don't some
41:54 - reason that's not you know what it is
41:55 - I'm not I'm on a weird page so that chat
41:59 - that I'm looking at is actually in the
42:00 - YouTube dashboard streaming panel and it
42:03 - doesn't have that option which is silly
42:05 - I should switch to a different page so I
42:09 - will somehow figure that out at some
42:10 - point okay so let me go here OOP let me
42:17 - close this let me go open I think what
42:23 - I'm looking for is so let me just show
42:25 - you the deployed one to make sure this
42:27 - is working let's see if this still works
42:29 - so I have a separate web cam ooh
42:32 - hooked up what is it seeing
42:40 - what so that's is that the outlet on the
42:42 - wall that's just the outlet okay okay
42:49 - it's still work yeah it still works okay
42:57 - so great this still works which is so
43:00 - this is a project that I made in a
43:03 - previous livestream from a while ago
43:05 - it's being edited probably to about a 30
43:07 - minute video so this is you know my
43:10 - process it for a lot of content which is
43:12 - that'll happen in a live stream which
43:13 - maybe takes a couple hours and kind of
43:15 - edit it down to the try not to take out
43:18 - any of the coding parts but if I'm stuck
43:20 - for 20 minutes I'll just put that part
43:22 - of it at the end of the 20 minutes where
43:24 - I say what the error is
43:27 - so but the thing that I missed and I'm
43:30 - gonna go back to open it really only
43:34 - matters and I've already put it in the
43:35 - correction in this data collection
43:37 - example so if you recall or if you did
43:43 - watch I had this kind of horrifying code
43:46 - which is very painful to look at nested
43:49 - callback hell where I am using set
43:52 - timeout to give myself 10 seconds before
43:54 - I start collecting the data and setting
43:57 - the state to collecting and then I
43:59 - collect a tit for 10 seconds and then 10
44:03 - seconds later set the state back to
44:05 - waiting and it times out okay thank you
44:14 - CJ's giving me some helpful tips to
44:16 - different places where I can look for
44:18 - these things the super chat stuff okay
44:25 - so the issue is there's another part of
44:28 - the code and I'm gonna take this out
44:30 - this is what the code looked like in the
44:33 - got poses function whenever I guess I
44:38 - made the font a little bit smaller then
44:39 - go back to 32 I think 32 is where I keep
44:42 - it when I'm streaming in the got poses
44:45 - function anytime I receive a pose
44:53 - whether what no matter what the state is
44:54 - this function happens they're supposed
44:57 - they're supposed there's opposed and
44:58 - then I add the data I never put a
45:01 - conditional in here to only collect the
45:05 - data once the collect so it actually was
45:08 - collecting if you can see if it was
45:10 - collecting the data all of this time
45:13 - collecting collecting collecting
45:15 - collecting collecting collecting click
45:17 - so I had a lot of so-called dirty data
45:21 - it sounded weird but that's you know
45:23 - it's not clean its data that's not any
45:26 - good that's just noise it was in all of
45:28 - them and the system was able to learn
45:30 - anyway and it did fine but the whole
45:33 - point of having that was to specifically
45:35 - collect during a defined period of time
45:37 - which I did not do did anybody notice
45:39 - that didn't anybody message me about
45:41 - that I don't think so I was looking and
45:44 - I look at it like so many times because
45:47 - I thought there's no way I missed that
45:48 - and nobody said anything or that I
45:51 - didn't even notice but I think that
45:53 - really really really did happen so I'm
45:59 - here so what I'm gonna do did I go over
46:03 - here do I still have this split thing by
46:04 - the way let me just see if it still
46:07 - works yes so this is by the way that I'm
46:11 - gonna use this today as well so that it
46:13 - can be over here still do that focus I
46:17 - think that's fine okay
46:22 - so um I'm gonna try to do a correction
46:25 - now I'm a little bit afraid ordinarily I
46:29 - I do have a system going actually maybe
46:31 - it's been a half an hour right I noticed
46:34 - I think much' is watching not see I'm
46:37 - gonna do something really quick I am
46:39 - going to go to everybody just hold your
46:43 - train caboose hold your horses I'm going
46:47 - to Google Drive and I'm gonna upload the
46:50 - first half an hour of the green screen
46:51 - footage just to make sure we had an
46:53 - issue where I record a backup of me just
46:56 - with the green screen and the telethon
46:58 - footage was unusable it was just like
47:00 - had so many dropped frames and I'm a
47:02 - little worried that that's happening
47:04 - today
47:05 - so I'm just going to go ahead and upload
47:07 - that so I'm gonna just tag matcha in
47:09 - discord also in case he's not like
47:12 - hearing this at this moment looks like
47:14 - here under vmix storage there's a is
47:19 - there a it's been 30 minutes
47:21 - oh I'm not recording yet well good thing
47:25 - I thought of that I haven't started
47:28 - recording though there's nothing to
47:29 - check nevermind
47:30 - so I am going to and I have to hit stop
47:33 - here fan is going crazy just ignore me
47:36 - everybody I am going to question is here
47:45 - tells me Rodrigo
47:46 - okay okay I'm gonna look we're gonna
47:51 - look I can't resist
47:59 - let's see Rodrigo question what's your
48:06 - Rodrigo I can't find it I can't find it
48:12 - is it buried at the bottom is it recent
48:15 - what do I do sort by newest message just
48:18 - oh there it is oh boy
48:25 - okay Rodrigo so I appreciate your
48:29 - question and I see it I don't think that
48:33 - I can debug this live right now but nope
48:38 - let me just find this question if
48:40 - somebody could post this into discord we
48:44 - could discuss it later so it's at
48:47 - Rodrigo - see you el b.com slash rota
48:51 - and I guess I didn't get this correct
49:00 - Rodrigo - huh ODOT BR there we go so
49:08 - something about this oh yeah there's an
49:11 - error so there's an error here I've lost
49:14 - all my different screens
49:16 - I will we could take a look at that in
49:18 - discord later but that would be the
49:20 - place to post this in the help channel
49:22 - maybe under p5 maybe we should have like
49:24 - a specific like coding challenges help
49:26 - channel so if it's specific to an
49:28 - algorithm that's one of the consent
49:29 - really I guess it's a p5 question but
49:32 - it's really coding challenge related so
49:33 - why don't we add a coding challenge go
49:36 - away why don't we add a PA a coding
49:38 - challenge related channel in the discord
49:40 - and we can post Rodrigo's question there
49:42 - okay and thank you and Naveed yo alright
49:49 - what was I doing
49:51 - I'm recording to disk alright we're
49:56 - gonna record to disk I'm gonna start
49:59 - that now I'm just going to assume it's
50:01 - working and that it was a fluke before
50:12 - okay
50:16 - okay close this and so I guess I I
50:26 - really appreciate people super chats and
50:29 - I understand its it's a it's a tool to
50:31 - highlight a question and I will try to
50:33 - take an eye on it but it's hard for me
50:37 - to do the live stream and debug code
50:41 - that comes in through a request that way
50:43 - so I would prefer the preferred way to
50:45 - support and get your question answered
50:47 - would be to do it through discord and if
50:49 - you wanted to elevate it may be I guess
50:51 - joining is a youtube memory of you just
50:53 - did it for a month that would be a way
50:54 - of doing that okay if you reload the
50:58 - page it works sometimes so probably I'll
51:01 - take it we'll take a look alright okay
51:05 - so I'm going to assume that the green
51:08 - screen thing is working and but first I
51:14 - am going to just test out that if this
51:18 - improves anything so let's go to what I
51:27 - want to do is if state equals collecting
51:38 - only add the data if the state equals
51:41 - collecting so I am going to do I'm gonna
51:44 - recollect all the data okay wait so what
51:54 - do I do I forgot the interaction so I
51:55 - think I press Y and it says oh I have to
52:05 - wait though it's gonna say collecting in
52:07 - a second collecting
52:15 - so now I'm really only collecting this
52:19 - okay now I'm going to do ym
52:33 - one
52:37 - it's collecting it's collecting it's
52:40 - collecting it's collecting and finished
52:48 - see
52:58 - it's really crazy out of this camera
53:00 - takes forever to focus
53:06 - it's collecting all this nonsense data
53:08 - with the unfocused camera
53:16 - it's done that's weird out Nick never
53:18 - focused see a okay and
53:28 - [Music]
53:38 - it's collecting it's collecting it's
53:40 - collecting oh yeah I should really move
53:43 - around I just got confused where I was
53:45 - doing all right
53:55 - yes round thing yeah I I did a terrible
53:59 - job let's just do this again
54:01 - I just I'm trying to take up too much
54:03 - time doing this but alright let's do
54:08 - yeah I so I'm not doing the C backwards
54:11 - it's mirrored the video is mirrored I'm
54:15 - doing it the correct way
54:17 - why come on focus there we go
54:28 - it's collecting the data
54:35 - collecting the data not collecting okay
54:40 - why and come on focus focus I think if I
54:50 - just stand like this it focuses faster
54:55 - all right no it doesn't why is it this
54:58 - particulate webcam there we go
55:01 - mm mm should move around saying okay see
55:13 - I'm doing it the correct way wait let me
55:18 - see if I get it to focus
55:24 - collecting and collecting and then the
55:33 - last one I don't know let's tie don't
55:36 - know how to turn off auto focus on this
55:38 - webcam somebody wants to tell them
55:40 - figure that out some logitech webcam
55:48 - collecting collecting collecting
55:50 - collecting collecting collecting
55:54 - collecting not collecting okay okay so
56:09 - now if I hit s
56:13 - this now saved all the data and then I'm
56:20 - going to go to my next example whoops
56:26 - which was model training so this should
56:34 - and then I just want to upload the data
56:40 - new data JSON let's upload that let's
56:49 - change it to new data and this should
56:55 - train the model this is all the stuff I
56:58 - did before
57:06 - okay so Clippy wants to know the model
57:09 - of the camera it is a logitech carl
57:17 - zeiss tests are HD 1080p does that help
57:22 - This Is It this is what it looks like
57:25 - I don't know the model of it okay so now
57:33 - it's train the model and it saved it so
57:37 - I'm gonna go to now I'm going to go to
57:41 - yeah I don't need to save this one I'm
57:45 - gonna go to deploy and I'm going to
57:50 - create a folder model too and I'm gonna
58:01 - leave this old model I'm going to rename
58:04 - these
58:14 - and let's add files here okay
58:25 - and now we're gonna try running this by
58:28 - loading model two and let's see if this
58:35 - works the same way or better or the same
58:37 - or different Owen
58:39 - luckily for me I moved the camera good
58:41 - work good work Schiffman okay and why
58:50 - hey yeah it's much more stable I mean
58:56 - the M in the a is a real problem because
58:59 - this is like all I'm doing differently
59:02 - but why so much better than it was when
59:09 - I made the video oh my god oh I really
59:14 - really really really needed that fix oh
59:17 - my goodness Wow Wow
59:24 - well ah it's fine
59:27 - the video will be fine anyway people
59:30 - will be surprised when their version
59:32 - performs better so now I need to record
59:34 - something that's just going to get
59:35 - spliced in so let me go back to s I can
59:45 - hit save here let me go back to the data
59:51 - collection one
59:59 - and let me go to here okay
60:13 - all right round things I would suggest
60:16 - you make a this is jet so yes so like a
60:21 - round thing thank you for the
60:23 - suggestions those are good ones so in
60:25 - theory my I don't know if this is true
60:27 - but I'm hoping that the full playlist of
60:30 - all the videos will give people the
60:31 - basics leading up to being able to do
60:33 - this project so there's a lot of
60:35 - dependency in this project but we'll see
60:37 - and this is basically all my own version
60:41 - of the teachable machine project with ml
60:44 - 5 and I talked about that in the video
60:45 - when it gets released so thank you we
60:49 - Roderigo for pointing out porting out
60:51 - that when you when you refresh it
60:54 - sometimes works ok alright so now what I
61:00 - want to do is have faith that the green
61:04 - screen is working otherwise what I could
61:11 - do is I could go to here I can record
61:14 - myself like this I'd feel like just I'm
61:19 - just like afraid it's fine I'll redo it
61:21 - if it doesn't work it has to work this
61:22 - stuff has to work
61:29 - okay
61:36 - all right here we go so in case you've
61:40 - just - did what I'm doing right now is I
61:43 - am recording I mean this is live
61:45 - streaming but the thing that I'm about
61:47 - to say and do is going to be spliced
61:49 - into a video tutorial about making a
61:51 - pose classifier that will come out
61:53 - hopefully early next week okay
62:05 - it's time I think it's better for me to
62:08 - wear the pineapple shirt for the edited
62:11 - videos and it's so warm in here that I
62:14 - thought a short sleeve shirt would be a
62:16 - good thing up up
62:17 - pokeball disconnected okay this is my
62:22 - new shirt that I got over which were
62:24 - pretty very proud of it
62:26 - there's no green in it is there okay hi
62:40 - how do I enter a video sorry for a
62:45 - second I'm coming to you from almost
62:47 - week several weeks a month later a
62:49 - really long time look how much my beard
62:51 - has grown to issue a correction I have
62:54 - made a very significant error in this
62:56 - video that you're watching and I don't
62:59 - correct it anytime throughout the course
63:00 - of this video and the air is that I
63:02 - forgot to actually include an if
63:05 - statement here in the got poses event
63:09 - when I receive a pose I should only
63:11 - actually call add data when the state is
63:14 - collecting I was just doing it anyway
63:16 - sure I set the state to collecting and
63:19 - waiting and then to collecting and
63:20 - waiting but it didn't actually included
63:21 - conditional so I had a lot of messy
63:24 - extra noise in the data so I just redid
63:27 - it now and this the time that I'm
63:29 - talking to you right now and collected
63:31 - the data again retrain the model and
63:32 - performed so much better than it
63:34 - actually does in the video and the code
63:36 - that's released has that small
63:37 - correction in it amazingly it kind of
63:39 - worked
63:39 - anyway as you'll see as you continue
63:41 - watching but just note that correction
63:43 - when you go look at the code it was it's
63:44 - an important detail thanks then enjoy
63:46 - the rest of this video
63:53 - how's that oh it does perfect wah-wah oh
63:57 - is this if I rehearse that for days
63:59 - right
64:00 - wait all right we're just gonna hope
64:11 - actually machiya what I'm gonna do is
64:14 - who's maybe not watching I'm just gonna
64:17 - see like where I am in the it the the
64:20 - all the archived footage records it
64:21 - makes a new file every 30 minutes I'm
64:24 - just curious where we are in that 30
64:26 - minute so it made a new file at 2:19 at
64:33 - some point I can upload someone reminds
64:34 - me and a little bit later I'll upload I
64:38 - will upload the that video just to check
64:43 - it or I can just check it myself
64:44 - I don't need to upload it I can look at
64:45 - it myself let me look at it myself good
64:49 - talk amongst yourself for a minute
64:57 - I'm gonna go check this video see how
64:59 - the frame rate looks it's not playable
65:07 - Oh cuz it's it's still recording it oh
65:10 - so let me stop it is that bad stop it
65:16 - only has eight dropped frames it's gotta
65:19 - be fine right I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm
65:22 - too nervous I'm gonna check it yeah
65:33 - looks fine I mean I look ridiculous
65:36 - wearing this pineapple shirt with my
65:37 - overgrown beard
65:41 - [Music]
65:49 - I think it's fine okay oh right
65:55 - I'm gonna send it back Multi quarter on
65:58 - I am recording again okay all right so
66:11 - now it's an hour I'm gonna take a short
66:16 - break
66:22 - and then I'm gonna do my first coding
66:25 - project and let me tell you what that's
66:26 - going to be so what you just saw me
66:28 - issue a correction for I'm gonna make a
66:29 - follow-up and what I'm gonna do is I'm
66:31 - gonna make a pose classifier except it's
66:34 - not gonna be a classifier I'm going to
66:36 - have the output of the machine learning
66:37 - system be regression so I'm going to
66:40 - control what is what amounts to a slider
66:44 - with my body and I'll talk about that is
66:48 - and I think a thanks to the inspiration
66:50 - from darshan who is a viewer that's why
66:55 - I have a lot of white hair thanks to its
66:57 - Frazier of darshan who is a viewer I am
66:59 - going to have color be the output which
67:03 - I think will be interesting I am going
67:06 - to also turn this Do Not Disturb on my
67:08 - watch on okay all right so I
67:22 - and very briefly I'm going to thank my
67:26 - friends over at dashlane who are out of
67:33 - practice who are the generous sponsor of
67:36 - today's coding train live so that's the
67:39 - URL you want to go to - link comm slash
67:41 - coding train let me show you why I like
67:43 - I love deftly so what I'm gonna do I'm
67:46 - gonna go back to our discord and when I
67:51 - open up the discord and I'm gonna just
67:53 - throw caution to the wind
67:54 - No is this where I do it logout where do
67:56 - I log out I'm gonna go up here I leave
68:00 - no not leave logout there it is you
68:07 - can't see I'm gonna click logout and
68:09 - then I'm going to come back to my
68:11 - computer here oh I like to log into the
68:22 - code e-trade discord and see what's
68:24 - happening today I know my email that I
68:29 - signed up its info at the coding train
68:32 - calm my password I cannot possibly
68:35 - remember it because I am a person who
68:38 - uses different randomize passwords on
68:40 - everything because I don't want if one
68:42 - of my passwords gets compromised for it
68:44 - to go across everything I don't want to
68:45 - use like dictionary words I want good
68:47 - solid secure random passwords for
68:50 - everything how could I ever possibly
68:51 - manage that a password manager and there
68:55 - are lots of password managers that you
68:57 - could choose from out in the world whoa
69:00 - what just happened what just happened
69:05 - discord liked it and I take too long it
69:07 - just went to like a home page it log me
69:11 - and who is this what just happened
69:16 - am i hacked I'm in French what is going
69:21 - on I was talking about - and something
69:25 - crazy just happened
69:27 - Wow all right I'm gonna have to figure
69:29 - that out later because and
69:33 - I'm gonna put in my but I go back to my
69:36 - spontaneous ad and I'm gonna open up -
69:39 - Lane let me just let me start from the
69:48 - beginning here I'm gonna go to - Lane
69:51 - and now this isn't my actual - Lane
69:54 - account because I don't want all my
69:56 - stuff to show up here
69:57 - somebody scan the QR code oh wow
70:08 - that is wild wild that is really quite
70:15 - amazing cover the QR code is it still
70:20 - it's still visible all right
70:22 - well somebody could get it can i refresh
70:25 - this page yeah
70:26 - so hopefully generated a new QR code now
70:29 - we see so actually there's no way for
70:33 - something that's really fascinating
70:34 - that's that's kind of amazing the people
70:38 - are crazy so I have my discord here and
70:42 - there's my email I'm going to copy it
70:44 - and I have my password which I'm going
70:48 - to copy and I'm gonna enter in my master
70:50 - password which I can never seem to
70:53 - remember I'm gonna copy you only need
70:57 - one password that master password which
70:58 - is securely encrypted not available for
71:02 - anyone else and then I'm gonna put that
71:05 - in and I'm going to connect and then now
71:09 - I also and this is not necessarily a
71:12 - feature of dashlane although it will
71:13 - help you with this I have to find my
71:15 - phone because I have to factor you
71:17 - should always use two-factor if it's
71:19 - available so I'm going to get a I'm
71:23 - gonna go to my Authenticator app and get
71:25 - my two-factor code which I don't think
71:28 - matters it's gonna expire and just a
71:30 - buck a couple say that a couple seconds
71:32 - so that shouldn't matter and I am logged
71:34 - in now I did have to go to the - Lane
71:37 - app and copy and paste these but if I
71:40 - were logged in - if I were logged into
71:46 - if I were in the browser sorry there I
71:49 - have a Chrome extension a browser
71:51 - extension for - laning it will
71:53 - automatically fill it in so for example
71:55 - if I were to just log out here like log
71:59 - out of here and then click login it's
72:02 - actually being filled in automatically
72:04 - from - Lane and there you go so so this
72:15 - is how prepared I am so you know there
72:22 - are just click this here there are
72:26 - existing systems like keychain and
72:29 - chrome but you're kind of locked into a
72:30 - single system your passwords and info
72:32 - are trapped in one place so there's
72:35 - there's no credit card required it's
72:37 - signup - link never has access to your
72:40 - personal data
72:41 - it's an ad-free product it won't can't
72:43 - see your data and it works across every
72:48 - device there's apps for mobile the
72:49 - desktop and so if you want to give it a
72:53 - try go to - Lang comm slash coding train
72:57 - you will get a free 30-day trial of -
72:59 - Lane premium so you can see all the
73:02 - premium features and try them out for 30
73:04 - days and then if you did want to
73:05 - purchase it you'll get a 10% its
73:07 - discount by using the coupon code ik
73:10 - train as well so thank you so much the
73:12 - support of sponsors like - Lane as well
73:14 - as youth of the supporters align make
73:17 - everything that I'm doing here possible
73:20 - okay so I'm gonna take a short break and
73:25 - I have a new break in term it animation
73:30 - for you
73:32 - and I'll be back I'm just gonna get a
73:34 - glass of water you could sign up for
73:36 - dash line now because you have a few
73:37 - minutes and I'm going to come back and
73:39 - do that tutorial where where am I
73:44 - looking just to double-check the chat
73:46 - and everything
73:50 - okay let me get back to the YouTube chat
73:54 - here we go
74:05 - [Music]
74:07 - okay I'm gonna mute my mic for a second
74:14 - I'll be back in just a few minutes
74:15 - [Music]
74:36 - [Music]
74:46 - [Music]

76:53 - yes if some folks are asking about if
76:55 - they've come late what's what's happened
76:58 - so far should they go back I would
77:00 - suggest don't go back I've really done
77:02 - nothing so far
77:03 - can't believe we're at the intermission
77:04 - already I don't know that I'm really
77:06 - Rick ready to go just yet but I want to
77:08 - watch this whiteboard because I'm going
77:11 - to use it to do some diagramming
77:14 - [Music]
77:29 - which I'll guess I'll let you watch the
77:39 - camera looks like it's askew yes you
77:47 - would think with all this sophisticated
77:48 - expensive equipment I'd have a camera
77:51 - that doesn't just like get knocked
77:54 - around
77:58 - fortunately for everybody here I do have
78:02 - a a level I'm gonna put the level over
78:11 - here for a second
78:16 - which way do I want to go this way right
78:18 - that's better
78:22 - tighten this up
78:28 - [Music]
78:31 - that's better right
78:34 - [Music]
78:49 - how does this look do I look askew it
78:53 - actually looks quite askew to me that's
79:01 - better okay how's the focus let's see
79:05 - you find a marker so fix the mic in a
79:41 - better place how's that look
79:59 - [Music]
80:14 - pretty good right
80:24 - okay everyone whoa minimize the discord
80:34 - close this oh I'm not even in the right
80:39 - screen we are gonna do some coding today
80:42 - everybody
80:52 - [Music]
80:55 - all right I'm good till for at least
80:58 - another hour so we're gonna get through
81:03 - this example oh by the way I should
81:07 - mention I should mention that I do have
81:12 - this plan not sure how I feel about it
81:15 - yet which is to focus on my nature of
81:18 - codebook for the time period between
81:20 - basically January 27th and May 14th
81:24 - that's the exact NYU semester I am
81:26 - teaching a course called the nature of
81:29 - code which is follows the material in
81:37 - the book I am working on rewriting the
81:40 - book in JavaScript I could make I do
81:43 - have a whole set of videos that go along
81:45 - with the book whatever made many years
81:46 - ago where I look younger and the quality
81:48 - do quality is much poorer so that's some
81:51 - what I'm thinking of doing if anybody
81:53 - wants to object to that you could let me
81:55 - know okay all right so
82:08 - I am now going to make a coding a simple
82:35 - okay I wonder if I could juggle these
82:46 - not too bad
83:08 - we need to relax a little bit 14,000 it
83:12 - always goes to this same page because
83:14 - it's very like perforated here look at
83:17 - that it also like that's weird
83:20 - translucent book there let's go ahead
83:23 - [Music]
83:26 - the other reason why I do this is it
83:29 - reminds me to go to the eye doctor
83:30 - because I cannot read it at this
83:33 - distance with my glasses on I can read
83:35 - it at this distance with my glasses on
83:37 - or I can read it at this distance with
83:40 - my or I could do this 90 thousand
83:48 - one hundred and nine twenty two thousand
83:51 - five hundred seventy eight twenty one
83:53 - thousand six hundred and fifty three
83:55 - seventy six thousand and eight hundred
83:57 - thirty seven thousand four hundred
84:00 - thirty I wonder if you went back and
84:01 - looked at all the times I read the
84:02 - random numbers if I just always end up
84:05 - like kind of going to the same page
84:06 - doing the same sequence still looking
84:12 - for that original print still looking
84:16 - for an original first edition print of
84:20 - this book a million random digits with a
84:21 - hundred thousand normal deviates I've
84:23 - talked about it there's a Wikipedia page
84:24 - for it you can find out the history of
84:26 - this book and if you do anybody sees can
84:29 - can authenticate an original first
84:32 - edition print of this book on eBay or
84:34 - whatever kind of selling mechanism place
84:37 - that somebody would be selling one of
84:39 - these and has one or library somewhere
84:41 - please
84:42 - internet let me know I would like to
84:45 - purchase it for all the money in the
84:48 - world and yes something with this book
84:56 - is what I will do when I reach 1 million
84:59 - subscribers what it is I'm not sure yet
85:02 - a coding challenge where I create an
85:04 - audiobook version of this something like
85:06 - that ok
85:11 - now I'm just like afraid to do anything
85:16 - which is why it takes me an hour and 23
85:19 - minutes before I start actually coding
85:24 - fixing my hair hello and my recording to
85:32 - the disc let's just make sure yes okay
85:36 - oh no I don't need to do button
85:43 - oh hello welcome to another beginners
85:46 - guide to machine learning with ml5 jazz
85:48 - video on pose estimation with pose net
85:52 - I've made two videos so far just a
86:01 - little warmup
86:02 - the warmup a little energy juice little
86:08 - ginger chamomile tea energy juice
86:20 - hello and welcome to another beginner's
86:23 - guide to machine learning with ml 5gs
86:24 - video on pose estimation and pose net so
86:28 - this is the third the last one that I'll
86:30 - do in this series here about pose net
86:32 - first I looked at just what pose that is
86:34 - and how it works and how you can get the
86:36 - key points of a human skeleton then I
86:38 - took the output of the pose net model
86:40 - all those key points and fed them into
86:42 - another neural network to do pose
86:44 - classification to recognize different
86:46 - poses that I made with my body and in
86:48 - this grand finale pose video I will do
86:52 - exactly what I did in the previous video
86:53 - with pose classification but perform a
86:56 - regression so the final output instead
86:59 - of being a classifier and I'm making a Y
87:02 - MC or a pose I will make a regression
87:05 - what do I mean by that exactly
87:17 - so so to review this set up I have is as
87:21 - follows
87:51 - oh so close
87:57 - well the cameras lower than usual
88:05 - it's a wet subject it rocked me oh I've
88:15 - ruined this feeding us
88:50 - the system starts with an image it sends
88:54 - that image into the pre-trained pose net
88:56 - machine learning model that model does
88:59 - po performs pose estimation and gives as
89:01 - its output 17 XY pairs wrist elbow
89:06 - shoulder shoulder elbow wrist etc etc
89:08 - etc and then I take all of those and
89:12 - feed them into another neural network at
89:15 - ml5 neural network which then classifies
89:18 - those key points as y MC or a so that's
89:21 - the process that I've built in the first
89:23 - two videos and what I want to do here is
89:31 - what I want to do here is change the
89:33 - final output give myself some more space
89:52 - I want the final output to be continuous
89:55 - you can think of that as a slot what am
89:58 - I saying here
90:08 - I want the final output to no longer be
90:11 - categorical it's not one of four option
90:13 - if the final output is any number so you
90:16 - can think of it as the final output is
90:18 - going to control a slider and that
90:20 - slider is going to have some sort of
90:22 - range so what I did previously in other
90:25 - examples of regression in this full
90:27 - series if you go back is I controlled I
90:31 - I used a neural network to output a
90:35 - frequency value to play a musical note
90:37 - so I certainly could do that here right
90:40 - I could train the machine learning model
90:42 - to play the note ooh
90:45 - this pose and ooh this pose and I could
90:49 - actually have something that output like
90:50 - I could go and do that and boy wouldn't
90:56 - that be fun to watch but I want to do
90:59 - something different that'll leave as an
91:00 - exercise to you make a gesture opposed
91:04 - based musical instrument I am going to
91:07 - control color and this comes from a
91:09 - project that I referenced inspired by a
91:11 - viewer darshan who made a project that
91:13 - does an output so what I would because
91:15 - I'm specifically what I'd want to
91:17 - demonstrate here is that the regression
91:19 - output doesn't have to be a single
91:20 - number in this case I want to have three
91:23 - values and I'm going to think of those
91:26 - values as and are for read a G for green
91:30 - and a B for blue so I can say things
91:33 - like with this I'm the training can be
91:37 - this pose is this particular color this
91:40 - pose is this particular color and then
91:43 - this pose is this other particular color
91:46 - I'm imagining that those colors are
91:48 - going to appear and then as I move it
91:56 - will interpolate between those colors by
91:59 - trying to guess the value according to
92:02 - the regression does that make any sense
92:08 - do I need to go do that explanation
92:10 - again so me I am to be found one so I
92:17 - have to look at this one I've looked at
92:19 - a lot online and some of them are like
92:20 - ik stuff there
92:21 - printing which i guess is technically
92:22 - okay or it's like got missing pages
92:25 - which maybe is okay i whose want to find
92:27 - one that's in his best condition and
92:29 - that's the first printing I would take
92:30 - the third original print though I'm
92:36 - trying to say if I want to like kind of
92:37 - do that explanation over because I was
92:40 - kind of confused what I was talking
92:41 - about but I'll wait for a minute and
92:46 - think about it alright I Clippy wrote
92:56 - note so one thing I should always say is
92:57 - when you write something like yes or no
92:59 - in the chat I have no idea what you're
93:01 - referring to because you're so here like
93:03 - a minute behind me and so I don't
93:07 - remember whether I asked the question
93:08 - was was that totally confusing or if I
93:10 - asked was that totally clear so your
93:12 - gestured hope it's nothing that was a
93:15 - cool explanation all right you guys are
93:17 - all just your people you are you're like
93:19 - me I'm like a people pleaser I'll say
93:20 - that's great that's great no maybe you
93:23 - mean it you probably maybe you mean it I
93:24 - don't know why I should just assume that
93:27 - everyone's job okay I'm gonna go on
93:46 - alka is trolling me now in the most
93:48 - wonderful way right
93:57 - I'm gonna move forward I always want to
94:02 - redo things there's really no reason to
94:03 - I mean there is sometimes a reason to
94:06 - but I'm gonna go for it right duplicate
94:11 - this data collection for regression
94:22 - first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna to
94:29 - get started I'm building off of the code
94:32 - that I wrote for the data collection
94:34 - piece of the classifier and that's what
94:36 - I've got right here and the first thing
94:38 - that I want to do is just change the
94:40 - configuration of the neural network
94:42 - itself the inputs are the same they're
94:44 - still the inputs are the same there's
94:47 - still the same number of inputs of that
94:49 - neural network 34 of them but the
94:51 - outputs are going to change there's now
94:53 - three of them whoops ah there were four
95:01 - of them before because there were four
95:02 - categories now there's only three and
95:05 - the task is now regression so those are
95:07 - the only two changes I need to make
95:10 - otherwise everything is the same sort of
95:14 - oh those are the only two changes that I
95:19 - need to make to the configuration of the
95:22 - neural network itself there's plenty
95:24 - more I need to do here so let's think
95:26 - about what triggers the collecting of
95:29 - data oh I got to improve this I cannot
95:32 - tolerate this all right so what's a way
95:36 - for me to improve this is there a way
95:39 - for me to improve this without using a
95:41 - sink and a weight I at a minimum I could
95:47 - just use like I could name the functions
95:52 - I could use the arrow syntax what's a
95:57 - nice way for me to improve this without
95:59 - using a sink and a weight because I feel
96:03 - like that's going to cause a lot of
96:07 - maybe use then and catch
96:10 - yeah but set timeout doesn't support
96:13 - promises so I'd have to wrap it in my
96:16 - own thing just like a pain I seen bi m
96:21 - so me as typing so that's all the reason
96:23 - why I'm waiting cuz I feel like an
96:24 - answer my cup and CJ why the async/await
96:29 - name function no I don't I love a sink
96:33 - and a weight my concern is that I
96:36 - haven't used it at all in this series
96:39 - and so it's a little bit like I mean I
96:41 - guess I could pop it in here because I'm
96:42 - not I could just like pop it in there
96:43 - and like then refer to my other videos
96:45 - maybe I'll do that I was also just
96:48 - concerned about using Thank You Simon
96:52 - that's a nice I was concerned about my
96:58 - like do I need to make the key pressed
97:01 - function an async function and then it's
97:03 - not gonna mess up p5 let's just try it
97:10 - so I need my boy if only I could find
97:16 - all of my code examples really easily
97:19 - let's it's gotten a lot better so let me
97:22 - go to I think this would be under
97:26 - tutorials p5 promises and here maybe no
97:38 - cuz this is like not I'm just looking
97:41 - for here we go perfect
97:49 - great let me just grab this
97:55 - I'm going to put it all the way at the
97:57 - bottom and then delay time so then I'm
98:10 - gonna say can I say async function key
98:14 - crest this is also a I don't know why
98:20 - why does the web editor give me this
98:22 - warning cuz it totally supports it yeah
98:27 - actually saying it is okay as is but
98:29 - this is this I want to kind of take a
98:31 - look at here so then I would say wait
98:40 - delay 10000 state equals collecting
99:11 - let's just make it 1,000 for a night as
99:13 - well see that it's working
99:20 - okay so this should do look at this oh
99:26 - my goodness
99:27 - hi I love you wait what is so much
99:36 - better
99:40 - I'm just see if this works no error let
99:45 - me hit a key yeah it totally works okay
100:02 - guess I'll put this up here
100:18 - the states don't match the console.log
100:20 - oh thank you that's supposed to be
100:24 - waiting
100:33 - right this is what it should be
100:49 - so if you are tuning in now you have not
100:52 - worked with a sink and a weight before
100:55 - what I'm about to do it I'm gonna just
100:57 - reference other videos that I've made
100:58 - that go through it but you can see how
101:03 - this is so much better okay other thing
101:08 - that I just did right now is I rewrote
101:09 - this key price he praised other thing
101:21 - that I did just now is I rewrote this
101:23 - key press function to not have those
101:25 - nested callbacks and use a weight and a
101:28 - sink now this might be very unfamiliar
101:31 - to you it's not something that I've made
101:32 - a part of these videos all the way is
101:33 - something that I use very often in my
101:35 - own personal coding daily practice and
101:39 - so this delay function which looks like
101:42 - this uses something called promises a
101:43 - little bit convoluted but that's not
101:46 - what I want to say convoluted keep raced
101:53 - keep raced I got the stuff I've been
101:56 - doing a pretty good job of not starting
101:58 - over over and over again so I'm not
102:00 - gonna do that here unless it got rid of
102:03 - that callback hell and just rewrote this
102:06 - with a delay function that supports the
102:09 - a weight and async keywords this is
102:13 - something that's part of JavaScript es8
102:15 - that I do use quite a bit it might be
102:18 - unfamiliar to you luckily for you I do
102:20 - have a whole separate video then I go
102:22 - through a sink and a weight and actually
102:23 - write this delay function that uses
102:25 - something called a promise and that
102:27 - makes it so I don't have all that
102:28 - nesting stuff and I can really just have
102:30 - these things happen in this particular
102:32 - sequence and essentially put a
102:34 - ten-second delay before the state is
102:36 - collecting and then I'm gonna be
102:38 - collecting in another 10 second delay
102:39 - before the state changes to waiting and
102:41 - this still happens asynchronously it all
102:44 - happens the same way this is just a
102:46 - little bit of syntactic sugar make a
102:48 - little sweeter for us to program so
102:50 - that's not the key element here to this
102:54 - video the key elements here to this
102:56 - video is what happens when I start
102:59 - collecting the data there's no longer a
103:03 - target label there's a target color and
103:08 - each color has three continuous numeric
103:11 - values I need to figure out some way can
103:17 - I name them how do i name them ah the
103:29 - target output has three continuous
103:31 - values a red value a green value and a
103:34 - blue value interestingly I could assign
103:38 - those as an array let me show you what
103:39 - I'm thinking about now so ultimately I'm
103:46 - gonna change this to target color and
104:02 - I'm going to say if the key is our
104:34 - set the color to red and then I will
104:37 - make and so I read the chat so funny
104:57 - [Laughter]
105:02 - thanks for tuning in cliffy
105:05 - I'm going to make I'm going to set the
105:08 - target color to an array of three values
105:10 - to 5500 if the key is G or B I'll send
105:15 - it to I'll set it to the corresponding
105:16 - three values for those colors
105:49 - thinking about this
105:56 - so the thing that I'm thinking about
105:57 - here is that I only want to then collect
106:00 - if it's a valid key press so I think
106:04 - what I'll do one issue here is I only
106:07 - want to collect the data if it's a valid
106:09 - key press so I think what I'm gonna do
106:11 - is set the target color equal to null
106:14 - here and then I'll just say if target
106:18 - color like so if one of these keys was
106:20 - pressed I'm sure there's a less awkward
106:22 - way of doing this that somebody watching
106:23 - will inevitably are right about in the
106:25 - comments then I can set I'll witness
106:33 - I'll set the target color to know if I
106:36 - press one of these three keys I'll get a
106:37 - valid color I've gotten a valid color
106:39 - I'll wait 10 seconds to start collecting
106:42 - and then I'll collect and then I'll wait
106:44 - 10 more seconds to switch it back to
106:46 - waiting I know switch-case use a switch
106:50 - case use the switch case
106:56 - thank you master stormer for telling me
106:59 - that if I add this J s hint is it really
107:04 - gonna work es version : 8 the start of
107:09 - the file oh thank you
107:23 - so solar liners bringing up a good point
107:26 - and let me just address this for a
107:27 - second I was asking about how would you
107:30 - be pressing the keys when you're also
107:31 - making the pose and which color are you
107:34 - doing let me just remind you that this
107:38 - this is a terrible interface in that
107:40 - there is no interface and the
107:42 - interaction design is not thought out at
107:45 - all this is just me kind of doing a
107:47 - known to myself debugging way of
107:50 - pressing some keys giving myself 10
107:52 - second seconds to strike a pose and then
107:55 - come back so again if you are going to
107:58 - make a project out of this something
108:00 - you'll want to do is be really
108:01 - thoughtful about how that interaction
108:02 - design works okay
108:10 - [Music]
108:29 - so the fact that target color is already
108:32 - an array means I can sorry let me just
108:40 - do this again the fact that target color
108:44 - is already an array means that I can
108:45 - configure it as the output the target
108:48 - output during the training and so target
108:53 - label becomes target color here and I
108:57 - don't even need this separate variable
109:00 - because I don't need to wrap it into an
109:02 - array I can just put target color right
109:04 - here so all of these so all the inputs
109:11 - for any given pose have a corresponding
109:15 - output which is a color three continuous
109:19 - values red green and blue if I want to
109:22 - make my life easier here even though a
109:23 - neural network just deals with numbers
109:25 - ml five has some helpful bits of it and
109:28 - I could actually use a JavaScript object
109:30 - which might have some conveniences
109:31 - because I could name the RG and B values
109:37 - so I'm actually going to go here on your
109:39 - outputs and change this to an array with
109:42 - red green and blue
109:57 - and then wait red-green-blue sorry
110:04 - give us off more space here
110:10 - pretty white and then yeah sorry and
110:13 - then when I set the colors I'll make
110:16 - them an object
110:33 - and again one is not necessarily better
110:36 - than the other I'm just showing you that
110:38 - you can do both of these with ml5 and a
110:40 - lot of cases it's convenient to have
110:42 - names to the output so when it comes
110:43 - back I'll remember what value goes with
110:45 - what this should be good
110:59 - so let's say split can go here
111:22 - and then where am i sorry and now I
111:31 - should be able to collect the data let's
111:33 - give it a try let me hold on I don't
111:36 - think I want to do is I want to restart
111:37 - the browser I find that the I think
111:40 - there's like a memory leak or something
111:41 - going on somewhere so I'm gonna just
111:43 - restart the browser just still like so
111:50 - the webcam is as responsive as possible
111:52 - no seriously
112:08 - okay
112:09 - not a fan of ya know old habits die hard
112:14 - I should use the triple equals alright
112:20 - so now I'm ready to collect the data
112:22 - let's give this a try
112:24 - oh it's showing like ukulele it's
112:36 - showing the drawing on the wall that
112:39 - doesn't matter why am I worrying about
112:40 - this it's suppose net alright gotta
112:47 - press R it's cuz it is it collecting the
112:54 - data I don't know if it worked because I
112:56 - didn't console.log anything
112:57 - ten seconds happened yet oh yeah it's
113:00 - collecting this will be my pose for a
113:05 - red color
113:15 - if they finished now I'm gonna do a
113:19 - green color
113:33 - this is my green color
113:46 - I think it finished like going way more
113:50 - than 10 seconds and now what should I
113:56 - make my pose for blue hmm no I'll come
114:02 - up with something when the time comes
114:04 - yeah I've got ten seconds mmm
114:09 - first - you two focus man come on camera
114:13 - oh shoot
114:21 - I never focused and I'm getting like bad
114:24 - data shoot I'm really gonna do this
114:31 - whole thing again silly this ridiculous
114:38 - webcam
114:46 - I was a little confused as to what was
114:49 - going on so let me train again and let
114:52 - me actually add
115:12 - Oh
115:17 - let's skip all that we're gonna just go
115:19 - right to here so that I can see what's
115:24 - going on a little bit better let me also
115:25 - add in the console.log the key that was
115:27 - pressed so I'll just do this and I'm
115:30 - gonna try to collect the data now let's
115:32 - first so I'm gonna run this Goetsch mmm
115:35 - here we go there's the video I'm gonna
115:38 - press R so it should be collecting for R
115:44 - and 10 seconds this will be my posts
115:50 - collecting for are okay
115:57 - it's gonna tell me not collecting in a
115:59 - second and it finished collecting so now
116:03 - we're gonna do G I got 10 seconds come
116:10 - on camera focused camera
116:16 - ah there we go
116:23 - that's gee that's good enough and now
116:28 - we're gonna do B for blue Oh kiss camera
116:40 - okay what am I missing what is it like
116:47 - not hold on let's try to debug this a
116:51 - little bit I'm gonna do this again
116:59 - closer to the camera is that what I need
117:01 - to do yeah
117:11 - I went through this before but I haven't
117:13 - installed any drivers or anything for
117:15 - this camera all right hold on
117:24 - 3:30 geez Louise
117:28 - what what kind of camera was this again
117:37 - logitech camera webcam software
117:57 - oh my god Oh Logitech capture didn't I
118:07 - just press on products software
118:09 - solutions software Logitech capture I am
118:13 - going to click on you Logitech capture
118:19 - and it goes nowhere because they're like
118:23 - no Mac version of it or is this it the
118:25 - master series is this what I'm supposed
118:27 - to download I don't think so no this is
118:31 - something I'm supposed to buy Wu second
118:39 - link in my Google search ok no oh for
118:46 - Windows womp womp womp
119:00 - oh this is what I have it costs $9,000
119:04 - what a very expensive camera I assume
119:06 - that's not in dollars I don't know why
119:09 - what what like G where G located me yes
119:15 - very nice oh this is such a nice webcam
119:18 - I have automatic light correction I
119:20 - definitely need that compatible with USB
119:28 - video device class mode you just have to
119:33 - I just have to give up
119:50 - okay we're gonna make this work hope you
119:56 - do this again and I'm just not gonna
119:57 - care so much just turn the focus ring
120:01 - around focus ring around objective
120:06 - there's no focus ring around there's no
120:09 - nothing for me there's no switch on it
120:10 - okay we're gonna give this one more try
120:15 - where was I in this ridiculous thing
120:19 - that I'm trying I got a collected data
120:20 - again
120:57 - oh is that actually well that that link
120:59 - you sent me CJ will that actually have
121:01 - Mac software I doubt it right it just
121:09 - says Windows it says I think
121:26 - Oh
121:28 - hold on
121:36 - can you post this in a non-member only
121:38 - channel since I'm not signed on to the
121:41 - non-member only channel is here like
121:46 - just posted here in general or something
121:48 - or
122:01 - I would manually focus it if I could I
122:04 - don't see how to manually focus it
122:12 - oh oh it's giving me something alright
122:19 - let's see what happens here everybody
122:20 - this is exciting
122:36 - all right yeah I'm not worried about
122:41 - installing this at all where did it go
122:55 - where did it go what did I just install
123:02 - lodger
123:14 - what did I install
123:20 - oh it's a leader idyllic I allowed it to
123:22 - delete it cuz I was done I don't know
123:24 - what I just did tape on the phone
123:30 - I agreed tape on the floor I don't even
123:31 - need the tape on the floor I'm only
123:32 - gonna stand in one spot new Settings
123:36 - panel and the system preferences did it
123:47 - had something here that I can't see I
123:50 - don't think so
123:51 - was it camera settings okay camera oh oh
123:56 - there it is thank you
124:00 - woohoo image widescreen advanced yeah
124:07 - yeah all right everybody we are back in
124:11 - business I ain't okay
124:14 - okay okay autofocus is off I mean that's
124:24 - good enough for me I could try to like
124:26 - actually focus it but I think that's
124:29 - fine whatever it is it's fine I mean I I
124:33 - could yeah that works okay great well I
124:41 - can do all sorts of other stuff too all
124:50 - right we are in good shape everybody
124:55 - okay haha with booth thank you everybody
124:58 - today thank you I think CJ who found
125:01 - that originally and I don't know why my
125:04 - camera is doing such weird stuff right
125:06 - now but there's it auto weight balancing
125:11 - still I should probably fix that but I
125:14 - don't want to get greedy let's fix that
125:27 - oh no not auto white balance yeah must
125:31 - be
125:40 - okay this is silly
125:50 - I wish
125:59 - it was white balance only there's some
126:01 - other auto thing okay Auto I know
126:04 - there's a brightness okay ah there we go
126:15 - thank you that's what I that's what I
126:16 - want
126:23 - I'll make sure this works ok it's still
126:27 - Auto is that the white balance that what
126:29 - is it the other auto thing it's making
126:31 - me crazy looks like it's like Auto
126:34 - what's that called name for it or I
126:39 - brained
126:40 - I've reached the part of the challenge
126:43 - video livestream where my brain stops
126:46 - working right what's that that's Auto
126:51 - something else
126:54 - I got greedy they got greedy everybody
127:00 - advanced restore defaults turn off auto
127:06 - focus store defaults gamma thank you
127:21 - turn off auto focus off auto focus there
127:27 - we go
127:31 - don't get greedy people this works fine
127:36 - this works fine the brightness is
127:39 - post-processing yeah I don't know what
127:41 - it's doing
127:41 - all right we're fine we're good
127:42 - everybody ok here we go
127:49 - stop let's close discord yeah yeah yeah
127:54 - don't switch ok
128:05 - here we go now all right let me go back
128:09 - to the whole thing where I'm gonna add
128:10 - the key cuz I'm confused where I am
128:16 - because actually I want to add it here
128:21 - let me add one more console.log so I
128:23 - know which key I press just to confirm
128:25 - so I'm gonna just say console.log key no
128:28 - I'm ready to collect some data run the
128:32 - sketch I've got to think of poses for
128:36 - colors I don't know what I'm gonna do
128:37 - I'm gonna press are pressed are I pose
128:43 - for are collecting I don't need 10
128:51 - seconds apparently
128:59 - okay not collecting all right time for
129:01 - ji
129:23 - okay now blue I don't know what to do
129:30 - for blue hmm both hands up collecting
129:44 - the data all right
130:07 - I almost hit stop there now the feature
130:11 - that I implemented before is I just
130:13 - press s and it downloads a JSON file
130:17 - with all of the data
130:30 - now I can go to
130:40 - you know this stuff back in
130:59 - and so I guess I should come to here
131:10 - now I can go to my training sketch I
131:13 - could to add the training code to the
131:14 - the data collection code but since I had
131:16 - it separately in it now I can go to the
131:23 - sketch where I implemented training the
131:24 - model I could have just added that code
131:26 - to sketch I was previously working with
131:28 - but I'll go back and find the one that I
131:29 - made with the classification example and
131:33 - change the configuration
131:58 - rename that JSON file I downloaded to
132:01 - color poses let's take a look at that
132:05 - file just to be sure it's got the right
132:07 - stuff in it
132:24 - that's a long
132:28 - this looks good to me there's a date
132:31 - there's an a data array that has pairs
132:34 - of X's the inputs all of those key
132:36 - points all 34 and why is the target
132:39 - outputs red green and blue value so you
132:41 - can see this is all of my red data and
132:43 - eventually if I kept scrolling down for
132:45 - a really long time
132:46 - I would probably eventually find that
132:48 - I'm still in the red adventure I would
132:50 - find the data the training data
132:53 - eventually I would fought eventually I
132:56 - would find the pose data the inputs that
132:58 - are tied to green color different
133:01 - different color outputs
133:13 - I'm gonna delete the data from the
133:15 - classification uh-oh whoa whoa I've got
133:21 - to duplicate this Oh yikes
133:22 - ah shoot did I already mess it up I did
133:30 - and now I can't undo it hold on the only
133:33 - thing I changed was this right for
133:37 - classification let me just I'm just
133:39 - gonna start over again here take the
133:44 - Auto refresh off duplicate
133:53 - okay come back to this
134:03 - okay
134:14 - next I'm going to the sketch that I
134:17 - wrote for the classification example
134:18 - where I had the model training code I
134:21 - could have added the model training code
134:23 - to my previous sketches kind of what I
134:24 - did before but I think it's easiest for
134:26 - me now to go to there and then
134:28 - reconfigure the the neural network
134:48 - change the file that I'm loading so it's
134:50 - no longer that YNC a pose data it's now
134:53 - a data file that I renamed to color
134:56 - poses you can see that right here that's
135:05 - the file that I downloaded let's take a
135:07 - look at it in Visual Studio code just to
135:08 - be sure it's got the right stuff in it
135:15 - yeah yeah yeah and we can see this is
135:21 - what the data looks like it's the inputs
135:23 - or X's that's all 34 key X Y key points
135:28 - of the skeleton of the pose and this is
135:34 - what the data looks like it's an array
135:36 - of X's and what XY pairs so the x's are
135:39 - the inputs that's all of those key
135:41 - points of all the points of my skeleton
135:43 - and the y's is the corresponding target
135:46 - output the color values in this case the
135:48 - first data is red and if I scroll all
135:50 - the way down eventually I'd find some of
135:51 - those other green values
135:59 - so I want to up I want to upload that
136:04 - file to this sketch in the web editor
136:15 - I can remove the old data files I've
136:18 - duplicated this sketch I didn't
136:19 - overwrite the previous one and I think
136:26 - this is all of that this is all the code
136:29 - that I need to train it's a very it's
136:31 - very little code yeah whoops
136:40 - and this is all the code that I need to
136:42 - train the model it just configures the
136:44 - neural network loads the data file when
136:46 - the data is ready it normalizes the data
136:49 - it's going to do that for the outputs as
136:50 - well remember I gave it color values
136:52 - between 0 and 255 and it's going to
136:55 - normalize those two one zero zero zero
136:56 - one zero that type of thing and then
136:58 - train the model here we go let's see if
137:00 - what this looks like whoo this is not
137:08 - good not good not good not good
137:34 - okay what went wrong
137:38 - Oh sad ah let's look at let's just take
137:52 - a look at everything in the actual
137:57 - JavaScript console
138:11 - huh
138:14 - how come we never got to date already
138:20 - oh this is sorry did this is it here
138:24 - okay let's take a look here
138:28 - I just want see this data here training
138:31 - data look if I go down to here do I have
138:35 - some Y's that are yeah it's normalized
138:37 - so this looks good hmm this looks good
138:49 - fair for training I was expecting to see
138:53 - something wrong with the data stream
138:58 - false
139:34 - yeah this is right anybody saying
139:43 - anything in the chat it should be
139:46 - regression it looks like discrete
139:48 - outputs but they could have been I
139:49 - should have made them probably to
139:50 - demonstrate like weirder numbers why
139:57 - he's warmed up true as metadata ready oh
140:01 - boy this is gonna turn out to be all
140:08 - right let's I wonder if I let's let's do
140:12 - something a little bit more radical here
140:15 - so I'm gonna go back to my previous
140:18 - sketch
140:26 - yeah I don't think I have unsafe changed
140:28 - I think it's just confused I'm gonna go
140:30 - back to my previous sketch where I'm
140:34 - collecting the data and
140:44 - I'm going to change this to whoops I'm
140:49 - going to change these two arrays
141:12 - and I was that naming to that naming it
141:16 - really shouldn't have though and then
141:22 - also just gonna train right in here if I
141:30 - press the T key
141:43 - I mean I just I'm just gonna use all the
141:47 - defaults
141:49 - let's try I must want to train right in
141:52 - here and then also like I don't need
141:54 - this much time like I can get there in
141:56 - just three seconds and I'm just gonna
141:59 - take like five seconds of data so I'm
142:01 - just gonna do something much simpler and
142:03 - then this should be three so there's no
142:07 - names and target color is just an array
142:14 - yeah let's try this just tried this way
142:26 - oops
142:32 - collecting for five seconds and let's
142:39 - try G collecting for five seconds
142:53 - stripey
142:58 - collecting for five seconds let me save
143:03 - this data so I save that day let me just
143:07 - try training it okay that seemed to work
143:19 - was that really the difference mmm so
143:28 - was there an issue with the named values
143:33 - or did I just have something weird in
143:35 - the data that I didn't notice so let me
143:36 - go back I'm gonna do it both ways here
143:39 - and do the same thing I'm gonna do I
143:41 - shouldn't have
144:11 - so I'm just trying some stuff here it's
144:14 - a debug what's going on because maybe
144:18 - now if I changed the configuration to be
144:25 - red green blue that should be the only
144:32 - thing that changes right
144:40 - these are the two ways of doing it let
144:46 - me give it certain number of how do I do
144:50 - the epochs again when I call train and
144:53 - keep rest or just say this give it more
144:58 - epochs just to give it more to train all
145:00 - right I'm trying this again so now I'm
145:09 - trying with the names
145:16 - hey gee I also just realized something
145:20 - then I think I'm using I'm not actually
145:23 - using the latest ml5 but we're gonna see
145:27 - about this and then be
145:40 - okay
145:43 - let's try training it okay so why did
145:49 - the other day maybe there was something
145:51 - wrong with the other data that I have
145:52 - and that way that I set the epochs is
145:54 - clearly not correct but did I not stop
145:59 - and restart it
146:25 - that was weird
146:29 - we're saving the state oats
146:38 - no this has the named interesting so
146:45 - something went wrong before for no
146:47 - reason as far as I can tell is there
146:51 - something wrong with my alright so I
146:53 - saved this data set whoops yeah this is
146:59 - also a named data set which is whoops
147:06 - which one the most recent one so let's
147:09 - call this color poses to stop color
147:19 - poses to its upload it
147:29 - unless I miss something in this
147:31 - particular
147:40 - know who works just fine okay so
147:46 - something was wrong with my original
147:48 - data set
147:57 - interesting
148:00 - there were missing skeleton points a
148:03 - solar liner yeah I saw you say that but
148:06 - I just figured so I think there was
148:07 - something bad in that first data set I'm
148:09 - gonna have to collect the data again
148:16 - it's four o'clock people four o'clock
148:19 - people I'm gonna get this to work I'm
148:23 - going to get this to work but I'm not
148:25 - getting to anything else on my to-do
148:27 - list today clearly anybody's still here
148:30 - there's 300 people here what's wrong
148:32 - with you go go outside that's cold Brian
148:35 - go outside we're closed warmly well I
148:38 - need another break okay we are going to
148:45 - go back in time doo doo doo doo doo doo
148:47 - doo
148:48 - I need some water I'm out of tea
148:53 - go back in time and recollect the data
148:57 - huh fact save close
149:16 - all right I don't know if this is
149:19 - necessary gosh I hope the green screen
149:23 - stuff is recording all right oh this
149:27 - takes a long time to figure this stuff
149:28 - out all right in the future when there's
149:40 - an edited version of this node we'll
149:42 - know all that's happened
149:58 - I'm just about ready to collect the data
150:01 - but before I do so let me just add a
150:04 - little bit let me make a few so I need
150:09 - to read random numbers shake off shake
150:12 - it out yes the video the data could be
150:19 - collected from a video absolutely asks
150:25 - sorry Steve if I pronounce your name
150:28 - correctly yes maybe you don't wanna go
150:30 - outside any pitch-black freezing Danish
150:32 - winter okay I am ready to collect the
150:36 - data
150:37 - let me change a couple things one let me
150:39 - also console.log what key I pressed
150:41 - because that's gonna be helpful for me
150:42 - to see and I don't think I need ten
150:44 - seconds to wait I think I could get into
150:47 - my pose in three seconds so I'll save a
150:49 - little time now I am going to run the
150:52 - sketch and I'm gonna click something
150:55 - else I want to say cuz this came up
150:57 - during the the live portion of what I'm
151:00 - doing right now recording this the
151:01 - question was asked is this looks like
151:04 - classification and in a way it could be
151:06 - this looks like categorical targets like
151:09 - there's either red or green or blue but
151:12 - the idea is what I want to do is almost
151:14 - set some poses to certain colors and
151:16 - have the output interpolate between
151:18 - those colors so in a way what I might
151:21 - want to do interaction wise there might
151:22 - be a nicer way depending on what the
151:24 - target is to like you know kind of
151:27 - control the target output as I'm moving
151:30 - in round and striking different poses
151:31 - but here I'm just doing a very basic
151:33 - demonstration so you might come up with
151:34 - a much more clever scenario that really
151:37 - takes the full power of doing a
151:39 - regression by how you design your
151:42 - interface and training day and all of
151:44 - that but I am just going to do something
151:46 - and maybe what I'll do is I'll create
151:47 - kind of a dial so we'll see like you
151:49 - know I'll use my arm to sort of dial the
151:51 - color back and forth let's try that so
151:54 - I'm gonna run the sketch and I'm going
151:59 - to press I only have three seconds I'm
152:01 - gonna press art so I'm collecting our
152:24 - okay now I'm gonna press G which will be
152:30 - like here on the tile
152:42 - I think and now be one two three
153:00 - so my hope is that I can sort of show
153:03 - the in-between as I move my arm like
153:05 - this
153:14 - and now let me save that data and also
153:20 - me just let me just train it does I have
153:22 - that code in here
153:29 - that's sort of weird to me this looks
153:33 - weird but I think it's weird
153:44 - I'm gonna just keep going now I'm not
153:46 - gonna
153:56 - let me delete all this other stuff
154:03 - so now I have this JSON file that's
154:05 - named that auto named sorry now I have
154:09 - that JSON file that got Auto named saved
154:12 - to my downloads I'm gonna call it a
154:13 - color poses let's take a look at it just
154:21 - to see what's in there
154:33 - again again huh
154:50 - hmm
154:53 - I set the outputs to three during data
154:55 - collection oh really oh let me go back
155:02 - and check
155:12 - oh well that was a mistake it might have
155:21 - worked actually do you know what I think
155:23 - it doesn't care I don't think anyone
155:27 - will notice that it's like it actually
155:28 - doesn't care it did it anyway get it
155:31 - like figured out that the three matched
155:32 - with these names so I think it's fine
155:36 - ironically it's fine but that was a
155:37 - mistake FML five was smart enough that
155:40 - have figured it out so that's fine so
155:45 - when you're saying their words
155:55 - I mean moving was good well let me just
156:02 - all right let me just I guess let me see
156:07 - what happens when I bring it into the
156:08 - other sketch because even if it was like
156:12 - noisy missing data oh because my arms
156:15 - like here it should still learn like
156:16 - it's gonna get the same stuff when I
156:19 - actually deploy it training regression
156:30 - hold on
156:59 - weird dislike the loss function is like
157:03 - crazy let me go all the way through with
157:07 - this let me go all the way through with
157:09 - this but and then I'll come back and
157:11 - record the explanation just to see that
157:13 - it's working so I want here and then I
157:24 - want to duplicate this
157:58 - so I'm adding the model
158:16 - I have the model okay and then that's
158:25 - fine this changes to regression and then
158:33 - this has to change to predict I'm gonna
158:42 - just leave it called classify for right
158:43 - now and then um let's just console.log
158:51 - the results
158:59 - so this are just I mean I'm gonna ignore
159:06 - the fact that the why is there a my
159:11 - getting some console logs yet so let's
159:13 - look at what what it's giving me to
159:20 - literally just give me one red zero
159:26 - unnormalized green 255 blue one point
159:36 - interesting so weird
159:44 - yeah unnormalized value yes
159:50 - was that pose for green and why is it
159:54 - only giving me one
159:55 - I do sometimes read the comments Abner
160:01 - I'm just like not right now
160:04 - why did I only get one why did I only
160:10 - get one results
160:17 - Oh because I don't put this in here okay
160:25 - well what did the what did that object
160:30 - look like oh I don't have it anymore do
160:35 - I what I do so I get an object that has
160:41 - an array I can't oh I can't just then
160:47 - look up the value by the label I should
160:49 - just use an array the whole time that's
160:52 - fine so let me just do something here I
160:54 - just want to see what this is doing so
161:02 - I'm going to in draw I wanted to just do
161:11 - this with but I'm gonna have to just
161:15 - test mm fill our no no I'm gonna change
161:18 - the back yeah fill our G yeah no I'll
161:22 - just do the background yeah of course oh
161:24 - no there's a video there so let's do
161:27 - fill RGB oh but I can do background here
161:31 - and I'll just use an alpha background
161:33 - RGB 100 I could just use an array I need
161:42 - to go all the way back I'm not going to
161:46 - so then our equals results index zero
161:49 - value so I thought I could say results
161:52 - dot just results dot red Oh No so yeah
162:03 - why is it in an array cuz like I don't
162:10 - want to do this
162:23 - yeah the the fact that it's numbered is
162:25 - weird to me but I will oblige okay
162:40 - can I do like this
162:44 - No how do you do that where you want to
162:46 - set them all does that work no I guess I
162:57 - can do this must be this
163:05 - there we go
163:09 - all right red yep looks like
163:16 - classification still though kind of
163:25 - so I'm not really demonstrating the
163:27 - regression as I didn't
163:39 - yes I'm matching how I didn't normalize
163:41 - the data I don't need to nor I I did
163:43 - normalize it in the in the training code
163:48 - right here so it was normalized you
163:52 - don't have to normalize it the second
163:54 - pass so I don't like this demonstration
164:09 - what's a better way to demonstrate this
164:15 - because it's not learning the in-between
164:24 - well I'm so tired now do I need to come
164:28 - back to this another day
164:39 - all right like it's amazing how just
164:41 - like yeah you're getting a little bit of
164:44 - like switching between I guess I would
164:46 - have to give it more in between points
164:50 - so I really should give it a slider yeah
164:55 - I mean the way to properly do this would
164:57 - actually be to make sliders for RGB and
164:59 - then like mmm yeah yes still streaming I
165:13 - want to go all the way back to the
165:15 - training I know my training data isn't
165:17 - really good it's basically I'm doing
165:20 - classification and it's just like a
165:21 - little noisy which isn't what I want all
165:34 - right we're gonna go back to the data
165:35 - collection
165:45 - also I think to be honest that doesn't
165:53 - matter I'll leave it as named
166:09 - I think what I need is a volunteer
166:21 - yeah it's kind of over fit overfitting
166:24 - is an appropriate term to to apply here
166:37 - I'm trying to think if there's a way to
166:39 - salvage this so I could create three
166:47 - sliders for RGB
166:55 - I think that's what I'm gonna do all
166:57 - right all right I have to go yes
167:05 - exactly old channel and old Chuck so I
167:07 - think I'm gonna change to adding three
167:09 - sliders bear with me and then I'm just
167:12 - gonna do some kind of crazy like
167:13 - back-and-forth stuff I think it'll be
167:15 - worth it it'll be a little goofy but
167:17 - it'll work it'll work much better okay
167:20 - okay I'm gonna take a short break just
167:26 - to get a little water and like kind of
167:28 - reset a little bit because I do want to
167:30 - do this
167:31 - so give bear give me a minute
167:35 - and yeah only three data points only
167:40 - gives you a triangle Ashley is Ashley
167:42 - common everybody's comment is really
167:43 - good so I should have realized this I
167:45 - kind of knew this but somehow I thought
167:48 - it would just work of course it didn't
167:50 - story of a programmers life or my life
167:53 - give me a minute let me take a short
167:55 - break here I'm gonna go back to the
167:57 - intermission screen and I will be back
168:00 - in like five or ten minutes I'm gonna
168:02 - I'm gonna actually be going way back
168:04 - into this tutorial and do do it with
168:10 - sliders as a bunch of you are suggesting
168:12 - suggesting

175:19 - just another couple because I think

176:09 - [Music]
176:38 - [Music]
176:47 - all right sorry that was a little bit
176:49 - longer than I usually take a break for I
176:52 - needed some time to collect myself get I
176:56 - actually made some coffee this is tea
177:00 - before I had a granola bar hopefully
177:08 - that helped my voice is kind of feeling
177:11 - a little bit sore and I kind of need to
177:13 - go within an hour but let's see I hate
177:19 - to say this but I think I need to go
177:20 - back even further in this tutorial
177:23 - because so if I could remember what I
177:35 - was doing is I some point I described
177:38 - these sliders I think I'm actually just
177:42 - going to go straight into making them
177:43 - sliders and I'm gonna skip the naming so
177:48 - I unfortunately am going to you're going
177:54 - to do something ill-advised which is go
177:59 - to pose net data collection and then I
178:05 - really want to delete these I can just
178:09 - there's nothing in these that I need I'm
178:12 - gonna delete them
178:13 - yeah you can't stop me I'm deleting that
178:18 - go hey I need to do this again
178:25 - it's just it's too much in there I don't
178:30 - know what's happening in the chat by the
178:34 - way you two could be the proud owner of
178:36 - a whoops sticker by joining as a YouTube
178:40 - member right now I will mail these to
178:42 - you all right
178:48 - so Mattia this is a gonna be an
178:53 - interesting challenge and I'm gonna have
178:55 - to remember to tell you that basically
178:57 - you could ignore everything that
178:58 - happened in the last like hour or two
179:00 - for the final edited version of this
179:04 - because I'm going to go and make them
179:06 - literal sliders oh no oh no I forgot
179:10 - about the async/await thing that I did
179:14 - that's fine I get to redo that just give
179:23 - me a sec what was that Jay s hint thing
179:34 - what was that Jay is hinting someone
179:37 - give me that jacent yes eight something
179:40 - or other
179:41 - I don't know that wasn't it all right
179:47 - this is good this is all good
179:52 - whoo that's gonna be worth it for the
180:03 - video that I had to I had to delete it
180:12 - it was a very little code that I added
180:15 - it was really bore all the training
180:16 - craziness and I have a better sense of
180:18 - now
180:28 - jas hint es version 8 yeah that's why I
180:31 - agree I need to be doing I've lost all
180:34 - momentum and everything so we're gonna
180:37 - give this another try
180:48 - there we go
180:50 - what
180:55 - what's this weird error bad option yes
180:59 - whoo yes version J
181:08 - he's a gay wait
181:14 - Oh No Oh No
181:42 - all right here we go oh I really thought
181:48 - everybody had left like CJ but my CJ
181:51 - probably left it came back okay oh oh oh
181:58 - I see
181:59 - hold on everyone I'm gonna get a little
182:01 - bit of extra time if I do something a
182:04 - little text message here
182:15 - everybody please hold your horses
182:21 - I need to do a little something and then
182:24 - I won't have this deadline of because I
182:26 - I i said i would send somebody some
182:29 - information that i thought was gonna be
182:30 - very complicated I'll do it when I'm
182:31 - done but I can send it to them now
182:33 - [Music]
182:38 - speaking of our spots
182:40 - I've looking up some information right
182:43 - now using a my password manager dashlane
182:48 - because I need to send some login
182:51 - information and then I use there's a way
182:53 - I can send it securely you know I just
182:57 - use signal or something okay hold your
183:02 - horses are held okay wait
184:01 - okay all right
184:11 - look everyone guess what CJ you had a
184:15 - meeting in your back you missed nothing
184:17 - well you didn't miss actually you missed
184:18 - a lot but I'm going all the way back and
184:21 - tied in fact even deleted all of the
184:23 - code because it was just so I just
184:27 - needed to start over
184:28 - oh the humanity
184:41 - oh the humanity
184:52 - I'm waiting to make sure this worked but
184:56 - I guess I'm just gonna I'll check this
184:58 - in a minute all right
185:21 - okay all right
185:25 - okay now pretend there was some period
185:31 - of time where I finished explaining this
185:35 - and then and then I'm gonna walk over
185:44 - and start the code again I just want to
185:51 - see that this message that it worked but
185:53 - I don't see it yes yet that's fine now
186:02 - I'm ready to start implementing this in
186:04 - code so I'm not gonna write everything
186:06 - again I'm gonna start from the posed
186:08 - classifier and the first thing that I
186:10 - need to do is adjust the configuration
186:13 - of the neural network the difference is
186:15 - instead of for categorical outputs ymc
186:19 - RA I just need three continuous outputs
186:22 - so I could actually just change this
186:24 - number to three because it's it's still
186:27 - a number of outputs but the task is now
186:29 - regression the other thing I really need
186:32 - to do is think about how am i during the
186:35 - training process how am I gonna create
186:37 - these target values and this is gonna be
186:40 - really tricky so I don't maybe this
186:42 - color scenario isn't the best one I only
186:44 - miss one person here but I think just to
186:47 - demonstrate this idea the best way would
186:50 - be for me to make these literal sliders
186:52 - so I'm gonna just the sliders and make
186:55 - the target outputs based on the position
186:57 - of the sliders and then when I actually
186:59 - deploy the model the model will control
187:01 - the sliders themselves and I'll see the
187:03 - color let's I think that's gonna work
187:14 - see okay great I'm off the hook I'm off
187:17 - the hook so this target label is no more
187:26 - I'm not gonna have a target label I'm
187:28 - gonna have a continuous values but let
187:30 - me create not slightly regret having
187:33 - three outputs for the regression but
187:36 - it's still something our slider ji
187:42 - slider and B slider
187:56 - so this target label is no more I don't
187:59 - have a target label there's no
188:01 - categorical output instead I'm gonna
188:03 - have sliders so let's comment this out
188:05 - and say three sliders for red green and
188:13 - blue they're all going to have a range
188:23 - between 0 and 255 with some default
188:25 - value in this case 0
188:41 - and I'll have the sliders start with red
188:45 - at 255 and G and B at zero so we can see
188:53 - these are the sliders that I'm now going
188:55 - to control and match with a given and
188:57 - match their positions with a given pose
189:20 - now if you recall I had this horribly
189:23 - awkward for a variety of reasons
189:25 - interface as in no interface at all was
189:28 - just key presses to set a label and then
189:30 - it would have this like callback hell
189:32 - with nested set timeouts
189:34 - let me improve this for a little bit for
189:36 - this round so one thing that I could do
189:38 - to improve this and I haven't been using
189:40 - this throughout this video series I've
189:41 - been staying away from it but I'm going
189:43 - to replace this with something called a
189:46 - sink and a weight these are keywords
189:48 - that operate in JavaScript and they're
189:51 - part of es 8 which is a sort of newer
189:53 - version of JavaScript that allows me to
189:55 - have asynchronous events happen much
189:57 - more sequentially in the code I've
189:59 - covered this previously in several
190:00 - videos if you haven't seen that you'll
190:02 - want to go watch those or read up about
190:03 - promises and async and await somewhere
190:05 - else but what I'm actually gonna do is
190:07 - I'm just gonna go get the code from a
190:09 - very specific video where I wrote this
190:11 - delay function I'm gonna bring that in
190:16 - here and then I'm gonna change key press
190:19 - to use async and a weight with that
190:21 - delay function and now let me just do
190:22 - that and then explain what happened what
190:24 - I mean
190:53 - oh it is so lovely look at it look at
190:56 - this nice sequential code that's like
190:58 - set the target label console.log it wait
191:01 - 10 seconds then do this then wait 10
191:04 - more seconds then do this isn't this
191:06 - lovely it is really worth taking some
191:08 - time to read up and explore a sink in a
191:11 - wait so that you can have some much more
191:13 - readable code this is all still
191:15 - happening asynchronously JavaScript
191:17 - everything happens asynchronously this
191:19 - is just sweet syntactic sugar to make
191:21 - our lives a little bit more joyful today
191:24 - so but and I also but ah but here's the
191:27 - that's not really the content of this
191:29 - video that's not that topic the topic is
191:32 - I don't have a target label anymore what
191:34 - I have is and actually let's just change
191:39 - this to if key equals like I'm no longer
191:43 - going to be collecting a particular key
191:47 - press so let's just have the collection
191:50 - moment happen when I do I'll sue D for
191:53 - data and then I'm going to have a target
191:58 - color and it's going to be an array with
192:02 - the values of all the sliders our slider
192:14 - and let's
192:22 - let me do this
192:44 - so the idea is that when I press the D
192:48 - key I'm gonna pull the values from the
192:50 - sliders I'm gonna set that to a target
192:52 - color we're gonna wait ten seconds so I
192:54 - can get in position and then start the
192:57 - collecting process collect for ten
192:58 - seconds and then jump out now it would
193:00 - be much better interaction wise if I
193:03 - could manipulate the sliders while I'm
193:04 - making the pose and if I had like there
193:06 - could just like open the magic door have
193:07 - a volunteer come in and help me with
193:09 - booth that might make more sense but I
193:10 - guess I didn't think of that in advance
193:12 - so that I'll do that another time
193:24 - sorry you're not feeling well a solar
193:27 - line I hope you feel better okay I also
193:34 - think that I'm gonna be able to get into
193:36 - position a little faster so let me
193:37 - change this to 3000 but I haven't done
193:39 - the important point the important part
193:41 - this target color needs to replace the
193:43 - target label when I collect the data and
193:49 - that that's happening right here so
193:52 - previously I had this like target label
193:53 - that was like a character that I put
193:55 - into an array and then passed it in ad
193:57 - data I think I can get rid of this now
193:59 - and just say target color so this should
194:02 - be good
194:02 - okay dare I say that I can collect this
194:05 - data now did I miss something I don't
194:11 - think I also want to collect the data
194:12 - for 10 seconds okay I also think that
194:16 - I'm gonna be collecting little bits of
194:17 - data because I'm gonna try to like show
194:19 - like straight-up here's what I'm gonna
194:21 - do I'm gonna try to show a path of
194:27 - alright take the values for the correct
194:30 - sliders ooh oh whoops
194:32 - ah Oh the chat thankfully is pointing
194:36 - out that I missed adjusting these to G
194:38 - and B well that would have really gotten
194:40 - me later thank you so I think also I
194:44 - just want to collect data for like three
194:45 - seconds because I'm gonna do things like
194:48 - set the color set the condom move my
194:51 - arms maybe like this and then just like
194:54 - set a lot of different colors with lots
194:55 - of in between states that'll really show
194:57 - I think the regression more clearly
195:19 - let me also console.log what colors
195:22 - there just so I see it
195:31 - all right I'm gonna start with the
195:33 - sliders in their original position and
195:36 - press D one two three okay I got some
195:47 - data now let me like adjust the slider a
195:49 - little bit let me add some of this color
195:51 - remove some this I really should fix
195:53 - like where I could see what color it is
195:54 - well next time add press D wait what
196:02 - happened to my pose oh I have a bug pose
196:06 - nap got something happened to pose now
196:08 - that was weird
196:17 - does that look just like a temporary
196:20 - glitch
196:34 - and let me start with pressing D I'll
196:43 - just get into this position Oh
196:54 - is there a bug in the code start with
197:00 - pressing D nope and I'm gonna just make
197:04 - this pose
197:05 - oh why some there's a bug alright what's
197:12 - the bug it's got to be
197:24 - oh here's the bug ah bug bad bug
197:31 - bad bad bad bug I read Eclair target
197:34 - color I'm making it a global variable so
197:39 - that I can use it across I mean there's
197:41 - a problem ultimately a nicer way to
197:43 - organize the code but I want it to be a
197:44 - global variable so I set it here and
197:47 - then when I'm adding it I get it here
197:50 - huh that was the problem
197:51 - okay now let's collect some data
198:06 - collecting okay
198:10 - now let me move the sliders around it
198:12 - should visualize the color but what are
198:14 - you gonna do I'll just add a little
198:16 - green and take away a little bit of red
198:19 - I don't know and oh wait it
198:21 - it froze again oh no that's just where
198:23 - it is less no no it's fine
198:25 - and press D again and where was I
198:31 - I'll go like this okay and I'm just
198:38 - gonna really make this pretty arbitrary
198:40 - would be good you'll get the idea I like
198:47 - this pose like around here man that's
198:54 - like do this
199:06 - okay I don't know so you following this
199:13 - along if you're gonna try to build the
199:14 - same thing think about how you might
199:16 - really thoughtfully make a bunch of
199:18 - colors with a defined set of poses that
199:21 - you mean something to you I'm doing this
199:23 - somewhat arbitrarily just to see if we
199:25 - can get some results now I could hit s
199:28 - to save the data
199:40 - and I have a nice JSON files default
199:43 - name that downloaded let me change this
199:44 - to color poses let's take a look at it
199:48 - Visual Studio code just to make sure it
199:49 - makes sense and looks like it does it's
199:55 - got a bunch of X's 34 it's got some wise
199:58 - width so the watts or the Y's are the
200:08 - outputs and it's an RG and B value so I
200:11 - could have done the thing where I named
200:13 - the outputs
200:23 - if I wanted to have names show up in the
200:26 - data I could change this too
200:40 - so ml5 of the neural network is just
200:43 - dealing with numbers but ml5 will allow
200:45 - you to specify oh it's a mistake here
200:48 - will allow you to specify names of the
200:52 - output so that when you get that back
200:53 - later you can figure out which is which
200:55 - but I'm just gonna remember there's
200:56 - three and there's order in the order red
200:58 - as the RL green as one blue is - yes
201:00 - that'll be simpler right now so now I
201:09 - can go to the model training stage oh
201:12 - boy
201:13 - I forgot to duplicate this code I'm
201:19 - gonna have to revert the old other one
201:21 - data collection regression where
201:39 - now I can go to the training the model
201:42 - stage so the truth of the matter is I
201:44 - could add and keypress another option I
201:46 - press Treaty it trains the model but the
201:49 - way I made my classifier I did those in
201:50 - three separate sketches collect data
201:53 - train the model deploy the model so I'm
201:54 - gonna keep going in that way and I'm
201:56 - going to open up
202:20 - I'm going to open up the model training
202:24 - sketch from before I duplicate it and
202:26 - renamed it to regression the only thing
202:28 - that I need to change here is the
202:30 - outputs are three the task is
202:32 - classification and then I what I need a
202:34 - new data file so I'm gonna delete other
202:37 - data files I have and upload my new file
202:44 - called color poses
202:56 - load that file and then everything is
203:01 - the same
203:01 - I'm just running the train function and
203:04 - then when it's done save the model so
203:06 - there's very little that I need to
203:08 - change here it's just a different
203:09 - configuration load a different data file
203:11 - and train them huddle I hope this works
203:12 - I really hope this works no no actually
203:15 - if you're watching this right now you
203:16 - don't know how many times I've tried to
203:17 - get this to work where did it where it
203:19 - has it that's promising a little bit of
203:27 - wonky stuff going on but it trained the
203:30 - loss went down I think something it's
203:32 - gotten some results here and it looks
203:34 - like those files have downloaded
203:45 - and we could see those files there in my
203:47 - downloads directory which means I can go
203:50 - to the last sketch the one where I load
203:53 - the train bottle and deploy it
204:07 - clothes not posing at deploy
204:33 - thanks old channel okay
204:36 - [Music]
204:42 - so I opened that sketch I've duplicated
204:44 - it and now I just want to delete the
204:47 - model files and upload my new ones
205:05 - files are uploaded adjust the
205:10 - configuration of the network get rid of
205:17 - this idea let me I'm gonna delete some
205:21 - old code that's no longer being used and
205:25 - I don't have a label anymore
205:32 - this shouldn't be called classify pose
205:35 - anymore let's just call it predict
205:37 - predict pose or predict color call it
205:41 - predict color and this should be the
205:44 - brain because I'm not because I'm doing
205:46 - regression I shouldn't call the classify
205:48 - function I should call the predict
205:50 - function this changes to predict color
205:59 - and now the main work here is I need to
206:03 - change what happens when I get the
206:04 - results so before I was looking at a
206:06 - confidence score and getting a label now
206:09 - I just want the raw red green and blue
206:11 - values so so and so this should change
206:15 - to predict color let me just console.log
206:20 - the results so let's see what the
206:24 - results look like in the case of a
206:25 - regression they'll be formatted
206:27 - differently than when it came into the
206:29 - classification it's no longer a sorted
206:31 - list of labels ordered by confidence
206:32 - score sorted by confidence score all
206:40 - right here we go
206:44 - this is like some stuff I'm not using
206:46 - anymore just cleaning out like code
206:53 - that's not being used okay let me also
206:57 - make sure to comment out this pose label
206:59 - which no longer gets drawn but we're
207:01 - just gonna look at the console now so in
207:06 - theory the first pose that it sees I
207:08 - should get an output here that has red
207:10 - green and blue values
207:20 - uh-oh I don't see any values what
207:25 - happened
207:55 - mmm let's see if
208:06 - what's that some console logging here
208:17 - add no pose here let's see what happens
208:28 - who
208:34 - ah brain loaded is not oh oh uh there's
208:41 - some for some reason that path says
208:43 - model - I've been messing around with
208:45 - its code and that says model - weird
208:47 - that it did give me an error like it
208:49 - couldn't find it is it in the oh yeah
208:53 - it's ain't fail to load here I don't
208:55 - know whose fault this is whether the web
208:56 - editor should be showing this or ml5
208:58 - didn't log it correctly but that's
209:00 - definitely the problem path is model
209:05 - oops
209:16 - let's try this again no pose no pose no
209:23 - pose no pose predicting and I'm seeing
209:26 - Oh three objects are G and B let's take
209:30 - a look inside okay an are G and a be at
209:44 - our G and a B so I should be able to use
209:46 - those values now to set the positions of
209:49 - sliders oh I got to put the sliders in
209:52 - and then also dry could just draw the
209:53 - color I kind of want to see the sliders
209:55 - move though I think that would be fun
210:24 - all right so I have three sliders there
210:39 - so now when I get the result I can
210:42 - assign it to the slider so I can say R
210:45 - equals results index zero dot value
210:48 - pretty sure if I go back and look at
210:50 - what was in that object oh it's gone so
211:00 - with math geo we can like pull that up
211:02 - pretty sure if I go back and look at was
211:04 - in that object you'll see there was an
211:06 - array of three objects and the red value
211:09 - was in the value was in a property
211:13 - called value
211:21 - and then there's one and two
211:25 - so there were three then I should be
211:27 - able to say R then I should be then I
211:31 - should be able to set the sliders
211:33 - position to these values
211:51 - and then also might as well add
211:52 - something to draw the color so here
211:55 - before when I was getting a label I drew
212:00 - it as text let's draw a background
212:03 - overlay on the video with a little bit
212:04 - of alpha let's grab the values from the
212:08 - sliders which were set
212:17 - and
212:23 - and set that as the background with some
212:27 - alpha hit the autoformat and it loses
212:33 - the scroll alright did I get this let's
212:38 - run it
212:45 - okay look at the colors moving the
212:50 - sliders are sliding based on whatever
212:52 - pose I'm making if only I could remember
212:54 - what it was that I did but anything's
212:58 - gonna give me a predicted value so we
213:00 - can see there's different colors so this
213:02 - is working it's working gosh I hope the
213:13 - background recording is working if
213:21 - anybody watching this I'm not saying any
213:23 - messages in the chat guess you're behind
213:28 - this is cool okay thank you oh my god
213:32 - it's only five it's five o'clock that's
213:34 - not terrible okay hold on give me a
213:41 - second
213:47 - sorry everybody
213:51 - [Music]
213:59 - TMC in the chat says color
214:02 - gesticulations so I think this could be
214:04 - what this is called it's called color
214:08 - gesticulations I'm controlling sliders
214:13 - with my body it's all very arbitrary but
214:16 - hopefully you can see that if you did
214:19 - this in a thoughtful way maybe color
214:21 - isn't the output that you want maybe
214:23 - three isn't the number of regression
214:25 - outputs that you want
214:26 - maybe it's music and frequencies or this
214:29 - third that you must have a creative idea
214:31 - but you can see that if you can as
214:34 - you're moving your body match the
214:37 - position of your body with some set of
214:39 - numbers you could then train a model to
214:42 - learn all of those relationships and
214:44 - then interpolate between them as you
214:47 - move your body around so I imagine that
214:49 - there's a very creative exciting fun
214:52 - unique way of doing this and I hope that
214:55 - you will explore it so if you do please
214:59 - share it with me there's a variety of
215:02 - different ways to do it you can find the
215:03 - page on the coding train comm for this
215:05 - particular video um ask your questions
215:08 - in the chat on social media all the
215:10 - above we have a new discord which I'll
215:12 - just happen to mention it in this
215:13 - particular video coding train has a
215:14 - discord you can find the link to that in
215:16 - this video's description that's another
215:17 - way you can join the community and share
215:18 - what you've done so thank you so much
215:21 - for sticking with me it isn't light I
215:22 - don't know how easy this was to follow
215:24 - or if this makes sense because I used so
215:26 - much of the previous code in it so if
215:28 - you didn't watch those previous videos
215:29 - hopefully those would fill in some gaps
215:30 - for you but let me know I can always
215:32 - revisit this in a future video and
215:34 - thanks for watching good bye alright
215:45 - I'm like praying I'm gonna check I'm
215:50 - praying that the archived videos don't
215:54 - have like a million dropped frames in
215:56 - them so I'm not gonna look at the
215:57 - current one well I guess actually you
216:00 - know what I don't need anything else I'm
216:01 - gonna to stop if not I suppose we could
216:04 - make something out of just the this
216:08 - footage but it's just so much better
216:10 - with all the extra stuff now so let me
216:13 - see if I go to output three I think is
216:17 - the one that's the green screen at least
216:28 - looks fine
216:38 - sorry I'm just watching some this back I
216:40 - don't know what I would do if it wasn't
216:41 - any good
216:50 - yeah the footage look the footage looks
216:53 - fine
216:53 - oh thank thank God I did delete all my
216:57 - code but that's usually Greg so one
216:59 - thing that I know I need to do someone
217:02 - who can help and remind me of this this
217:05 - live stream like 7 million hours later
217:07 - is ending basically I just lost the chat
217:09 - so let me get them back up where's the
217:15 - discord I'm like not used to oh I don't
217:18 - have that ah I quit that don't oh there
217:21 - it is welcome to coding with unity
217:25 - welcome to passengers and we have a new
217:27 - passenger aboard the coding train Oh
217:29 - coding with unity eventually at some
217:31 - point I will mail you these stickers
217:33 - sometime in the next 15 to 20 years no
217:35 - no it'll be it'll be faster I'm Kyle
217:38 - like I would like to commit to getting
217:39 - everybody their stickers within three
217:41 - months ideally within one month like we
217:43 - would do a mailing of them every month
217:44 - and there's something yeah but all you
217:46 - need to do is contacts I see why at the
217:49 - coding train com
217:50 - if you have any questions about your
217:51 - member rewards okay um so what was I
217:57 - saying
217:59 - that's done the dis chords there I guess
218:04 - I didn't get to a bunch of things on my
218:05 - topic list please if you just if you
218:07 - joined late join the new discord I'll
218:10 - open this up it's there it's to find the
218:12 - link people will well that's that I
218:14 - can't talk anymore I hope this can be
218:16 - made into a video that was a very hard
218:18 - to do but I hope that it shows something
218:23 - interesting and people can make
218:27 - something with it
218:28 - so I do I do send these stickers to
218:31 - international as well it's not the the
218:33 - International mailing is a little bit
218:35 - tricky and kind of expensive but it's
218:37 - it's it's it's easy to do thanks Alko
218:41 - for posting the discord and that's it
218:45 - for today so I will could answer a
218:51 - couple questions
218:54 - maybe I'll try to pull them from the
218:56 - discord I'm gonna open up the general
218:59 - channel where are people - people
219:03 - chatting live with this
219:06 - I am gotta go this is why we're kind of
219:12 - a record length livestream cuz it's five
219:15 - o'clock I start at 1:30 2:30 3:30 4:30
219:19 - it's not that record like it's three and
219:20 - a half hours three it's really long died
219:23 - nobody has to pay for postage you so
219:26 - first of all you can buy you'll be able
219:27 - to buy these stickers so you don't have
219:29 - to sign up as a member to get the
219:31 - stickers I have a standard TV is helping
219:34 - me set up a store and it'll be you know
219:36 - there's a small I think I don't know
219:38 - what it will cost it's gonna be launched
219:40 - about I think January 23rd is when I was
219:43 - told so you'll be it'll just order this
219:44 - sticker sheet and they'll be like you
219:46 - pay for postage you buy the stickers at
219:48 - some point possibly like a few little
219:50 - profit goes to me but I'm mostly doing
219:53 - it not as a to make money but just to
219:55 - make this stuff available to people so
219:59 - but you can also join and I will mail
220:01 - them to you the idea being that if
220:02 - you've paid five dollars a month for a
220:05 - year you know that's you're supporting
220:09 - the channel
220:10 - I've got $60 - YouTube's fee it should
220:15 - be about
220:19 - I think that's something it's a quarter
220:22 - so $15 hey it's $15 so $45 that's that's
220:30 - enough for me to mail you to print and
220:33 - mail you these stickers
220:45 - how do we do everybody clipboard what
220:50 - that is some new channels have popped up
220:55 - this is exciting
220:57 - introductions Oh master stormer
221:01 - so master stormer and richard guilt loom
221:03 - people are just joining so I'm trying to
221:06 - consolidate you can join via patreon or
221:09 - YouTube you just pause I repeat myself
221:13 - but there are some feature I don't
221:16 - honestly like they're all they're all
221:19 - have their pros and cons I don't love
221:21 - being part of the Google machine
221:23 - necessarily but I am this is a choice
221:25 - that I'm making for today and now for
221:28 - the foreseeable future
221:30 - but there are some nice integrations
221:33 - with YouTube itself if you joined
221:35 - through the YouTube platform that if you
221:38 - joined through patreon all the same
221:39 - discord stuff the stuff by mail I think
221:42 - I could do it's a little bit I hate to
221:44 - manage two platforms but my preference
221:46 - is for people to join via YouTube so I
221:48 - guess I'm saying that if you join via
221:50 - YouTube I promise you will get all of
221:51 - the member benefits if you join a
221:53 - patreon you might have to bug us for
221:56 - some member benefits and there are
221:59 - possibly some member benefits you can't
222:00 - get access to because they're only
222:02 - available through the YouTube
222:03 - integration alright thanks everybody and
222:08 - I oh no I did that I need to make a new
222:11 - I know wait till the store comes I need
222:13 - to make a new member video but I'll do
222:16 - that later I got to go I gotta go I
222:20 - gotta go
222:21 - umm thanks everyone I hate to leave I
222:24 - have this weird thing I mean I mean
222:25 - literally been streaming for like over
222:28 - three and a half hours but I have
222:30 - trouble leaving because you're all such
222:32 - wonderful nice people to be with me here
222:34 - enjoying this cold day in New York in
222:38 - Brooklyn and yeah and I will see you
222:46 - soon yeah
222:47 - bye oh I have an outro they're all the
222:51 - same
222:53 - gurgi asks are you on linked I'll let
222:55 - this finish its I've got my 30 more
222:57 - seconds
222:58 - um Jorgy asks are you on LinkedIn I am
223:03 - on LinkedIn do I ever look or check
223:05 - Lincoln no do I have all the LinkedIn
223:08 - emails go directly to trash or spam yes
223:10 - so I don't use LinkedIn if someone could
223:12 - convince me a reason to use it I could
223:17 - I'll just mention sign up for follow the
223:22 - coding train on Instagram it's the
223:24 - coding train that's sort of new ish oh
223:30 - okay coding with unity asks who do I
223:33 - message on discord for benefits okay
223:35 - great question this is worth me staying
223:37 - here for a minute
223:38 - so once you let me open up the discord
223:45 - so once you're on discord and let me
223:49 - just go to this how to join channel if
223:54 - if you've synced your YouTube and
223:57 - discord accounts and there's a way to do
224:00 - that in your settings under integrations
224:03 - I believe under user settings you can
224:05 - sync them you will automatically get
224:07 - access to all the channels that are here
224:10 - and there's a particular channel called
224:12 - rewards little gift emoji that you'll
224:15 - see that you can ask questions about the
224:16 - rewards there or you can message sigh
224:19 - see why they are responsible for doing
224:22 - the mailings of the physical rewards
224:24 - that find the community management stuff
224:25 - you can message see why on discord or
224:28 - also send them an email at see why that
224:32 - name sigh see why at the coding train
224:34 - calm and you can always message me or
224:37 - let me know about it - I'm but it's you
224:40 - know I'm trying to give this over to psy
224:43 - and have them really to have the
224:45 - authority responsibility of doing that
224:46 - okay
224:52 - don't be misled by my pineapple shirt
224:54 - coating within the cabana video coming
224:57 - soon may be marching squares but I'm
224:59 - gonna do the Hilbert curve first alright
225:01 - goodbye everybody
225:03 - thank you so much I will see you next
225:06 - week on the coding
225:28 - [Music]
226:11 - I'm gonna do this this star this star
226:14 - this star this star song never forget
226:16 - the Vista but somebody composed that
226:19 - song for me
226:33 - as always so this is random this is
226:35 - noise Perley noise that is in the core
226:38 - random algorithm the actual random
226:41 - algorithm itself those numbers aren't
226:43 - related at all we pick like I'm picking
226:45 - random numbers between zero and ten nine
226:47 - two seven six one nine four eight nine
226:52 - two one three I think nine eleven
226:54 - currently but with pearly noise I might
226:56 - pick numbers like this two three four
226:59 - three four five six five four five six
227:03 - seven five six seven five six seven
227:06 - eight nine eight seven well this is like
227:09 - Perlin noise performance part
227:30 - but with curly noise I might pick
227:33 - numbers like this
227:41 - Perlin noise that is Hurley noise this
227:43 - is Hurley noise that is Hurley noises
227:45 - this is Hurley noise that is Hurley no
227:47 - so this is Hurley noise that is her
227:48 - pearling know her Perlin noise that is
227:50 - Hurley noise this is Hurley noise that
227:52 - is Hurley no this is Hurley noise but
228:12 - with early noise I might pick numbers
228:14 - like this
228:15 - [Music]
228:30 - this is like Perlin noise performance
228:33 - part
228:55 - [Music]
229:17 - auto-tuned and the internet will fix
229:19 - that
229:33 - [Music]
229:46 - [Music]
229:51 - unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what
