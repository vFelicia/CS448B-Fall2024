00:00 - hello welcome to another video about
00:02 - audio in p5 yes if you watched in these
00:06 - other videos you'll know that audio is
00:08 - not really a thing that I know that much
00:09 - about but I'm gonna give it a try I'm
00:11 - gonna look at the reference and examples
00:13 - and try to make something the thing that
00:14 - I'm gonna look at and make in this video
00:16 - is how can I have a webpage listen to my
00:19 - voice and respond to my voice now that I
00:21 - just sort of mislead you there on that
00:23 - that could mean a lot of different
00:24 - things and at some point we might look
00:26 - at I might I'd love to make a video that
00:27 - tries to listen to the words that I'm
00:30 - speaking and respond to those words but
00:31 - really all I'm gonna do in this video is
00:34 - start with the basic simplest idea which
00:36 - is the microphone of the computer
00:38 - listens to the volume of whatever sound
00:41 - is it's hearing and visualizes some
00:44 - results based on that volume so how do
00:46 - what do we need for this we need the p5
00:48 - sound library so I'm gonna click on this
00:51 - here you can see this is the reference
00:52 - page for the p5 sound library in
00:55 - particular I want to use this object
00:57 - called p5 audio in here something really
01:01 - important and I should just state before
01:03 - I even get into this I am using this web
01:07 - browser called chrome and Chrome and you
01:11 - know possibly other web browsers have a
01:13 - security restriction where you cannot
01:16 - access the microphone or the camera of a
01:19 - computer first of all without the user
01:21 - giving your permission so we're gonna
01:22 - see this we might see a little pop-up
01:23 - saying oh can I have permission for the
01:25 - microphone but beyond that the page has
01:28 - to be hosted through HTTPS what does
01:31 - that mean well let's go to some website
01:33 - I don't know google.com you can see here
01:38 - it says HTTPS and a little like lock
01:43 - because it's locked it's secure so when
01:46 - a website is served through HTTPS there
01:48 - is additional security and encryption
01:50 - involved if a website is not served
01:53 - through HTTPS google won't even not
01:56 - serve through HTTPS let's try to find I
01:58 - don't know yahoo.com
02:00 - yeah okay fine let's let's go to
02:04 - Schiffman net there you can see here
02:09 - this website is not served through HTTPS
02:13 - and in which case the sketch that I'm
02:14 - going to make if you publish it to the
02:16 - web
02:16 - it's got to be published through HTTP
02:19 - which sort of depends on where are you
02:20 - hosting it and how are you doing it and
02:22 - that sort of thing okay now the
02:23 - exception to that is when I run my
02:25 - examples I'm running a local web server
02:28 - on the computer just so I can write my
02:30 - code and look at it quickly chrome
02:32 - allows you to do any of this stuff with
02:34 - localhost so while you're testing and
02:36 - debugging you know it will work we're
02:37 - gonna find out if it works at least okay
02:39 - let's so let's go back to the reference
02:41 - page and let's look at the pieces that
02:43 - we need so I need to create I want to
02:45 - create a variable I'm gonna create a
02:47 - variable called var Mike and I'm gonna
02:50 - I'm gonna go to my code which is right
02:51 - here and I'm gonna create a variable
02:54 - called Mike for microphone and I'm gonna
02:57 - say Mike equals new p5 audio in so this
03:01 - is making audio in object a lot of
03:04 - objects that you can create with a p5
03:07 - library like p5 dom duchess or p5 sound
03:10 - fjs have the p5 prefix it's kind of like
03:12 - a name spacing thing this is not a audio
03:14 - in object it's a p5 audio in object and
03:17 - then for to for it to start listening
03:20 - I've got to say Mike dot start so let's
03:23 - just run this in the browser I look at
03:26 - this localhost 8001 Stu use your
03:29 - microphone this means by the way if I'm
03:34 - gonna give permission I've really got to
03:37 - protect myself so I highly recommend
03:42 - doing this before you click allow click
03:44 - allow and I you can see some I get some
03:48 - messages here so it should listening and
03:50 - I'm seeing this like red record button
03:53 - there in the top corner so things are
03:55 - working good stuff right ok so now it's
03:58 - listening how do I get access to it well
04:01 - I need to call the function on the Mike
04:03 - object to say hey could you give me the
04:05 - current something-or-other right now and
04:07 - I what I want to listen to is just the
04:09 - volume so I'm going to save our volume
04:12 - equals Mike and I think the function is
04:13 - called gate level it might be called get
04:15 - volume who knows let's just write it and
04:19 - see what happens and then let's say
04:20 - console dot log volume so I'm gonna run
04:24 - this again and it's like look at that
04:26 - these numbers now here we go did you
04:30 - think that learning coding would be
04:32 - really rough can you say you I think
04:35 - it's saying that I can't say inside
04:38 - these numbers that's definitely saying
04:40 - that so you can see that the volume as I
04:42 - speak the volume gets live so one thing
04:44 - we can glean glean from this is that
04:47 - we're getting tiny little numbers and
04:48 - I'm pretty sure the range that we're
04:50 - getting is a number between 0 and 1 1
04:53 - being a very loud sound
04:54 - now here the microphones over here by
04:56 - the way so my microphones here so I go
04:58 - we can maybe we solve some big numbers
05:00 - go by there so what I probably want to
05:02 - do instantly I don't think I need this
05:04 - anymore
05:04 - is I could do something like let's draw
05:07 - an ellipse let's set a background let's
05:11 - create a canvas let's draw an ellipse in
05:17 - the center and let's give it size volume
05:21 - times 200 volume times 200 and we can
05:26 - run this again and here we go so now as
05:29 - I speak the circle it really messed up
05:33 - my hair wearing that wellthank how as I
05:37 - speak you can see the circle growing and
05:39 - shrinking and you know I guess I said I
05:43 - was gonna try to make it like a little
05:44 - mouth talking so one thing I could do is
05:46 - I could give it a fixed width and now I
05:50 - could just sort of talk and I
05:53 - puppeteering the thing running in the
05:57 - browser and in a way this is kind of all
05:59 - I want to show you in this video I mean
06:00 - you could think of some things you might
06:02 - do like what if I use lurk go find my
06:04 - lerp video and smooth it so the the
06:06 - mouth kind of like opens and closes more
06:08 - smoothly well if that's the kind of
06:10 - response you want you know what other
06:14 - types of interactions and responses
06:16 - could you imagine doing based on a
06:17 - person speaking could I play a game like
06:20 - the lap as I you know pong so when I
06:23 - speak I think somebody IIT P made this
06:25 - project actually where you would shout
06:27 - it to your phone I'm gonna have to look
06:28 - it up and maybe link to it in this video
06:29 - so what if I were to speak and as I
06:31 - speak the one of the paddles moves up
06:34 - the louder I am or moves down so there's
06:36 - all sorts of kind of ways you might
06:38 - apply this particular
06:40 - analysis and visualize so in the next
06:45 - video I'm going to move from reading the
06:47 - volume of my speaking voice or whatever
06:49 - is going into the microphone and
06:50 - actually read the amplitude of an mp3
06:53 - file while it's playing well and at some
06:55 - point I'll also look at frequency
06:56 - analysis with that as well okay
06:58 - see you in the next video perhaps
