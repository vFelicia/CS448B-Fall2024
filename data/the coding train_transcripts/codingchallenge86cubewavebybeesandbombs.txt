00:00 - all right this is my first coding
00:03 - challenge that I'm going to attempt in
00:05 - JavaScript using 3d rendering I am
00:08 - currently working on a set of tutorials
00:09 - about WebGL in p5.js I will link to
00:12 - those from this coding challenges video
00:13 - description but I bees and bombs on
00:17 - Twitter I highly recommend if you're
00:20 - interested in looking for like really
00:21 - geometric algorithmic mathematical
00:24 - illusion gifts that will kind of blow
00:26 - your mind
00:27 - check out the bees and bombs Twitter
00:29 - feed and look at this
00:32 - oh yeah look bees and bombs is watching
00:34 - this right now this is the gift I'm
00:37 - going to try to recreate in p5.js using
00:40 - the WebGL renderer okay
00:42 - so we'll see how this goes I'm just
00:45 - gonna get started so first I'm actually
00:47 - gonna just work in 2d because one thing
00:49 - that I need is just this night and I
00:51 - really need this in my life breathe in
00:54 - breathe out breathe in meditation
00:58 - I'm very high strong I really think to
01:01 - work on meditation and this is actually
01:02 - a nice calming soothing gift so I need
01:05 - something that can give me that
01:06 - oscillating behavior and the sine
01:08 - function simple harmonic motion the
01:11 - swinging of a pendulum the plucking of
01:13 - guitar string I do have some other video
01:15 - tutorials about that in processing and I
01:16 - will also link to from this video so
01:18 - first let's just make that happen in 2d
01:20 - so what I'm gonna do is I am going to
01:23 - have a variable I'm gonna call that
01:26 - variable angle and I'm gonna stick I'm
01:29 - not gonna I could add angle mode degrees
01:32 - to think in terms of degrees but I'm
01:33 - just gonna stick with radians I'm gonna
01:35 - say angle plus equals 0.1 then what I'm
01:38 - going to do and because once I get into
01:41 - WebGL mode the center zero zero and
01:45 - WebGL renderer is the center I'm
01:47 - actually just going to quickly translate
01:49 - to the center because I want to just do
01:50 - this in 2d real quick and let's draw
01:54 - loops let's draw let's say a rect mode
01:56 - Center and let's draw a rectangle so I
01:59 - want to draw a rectangle who which
02:01 - position is zero zero and its width is
02:04 - some arbitrary thing like 10 and it has
02:06 - some height so if I were to say let H
02:11 - equal 100 we would
02:13 - sorry we would add them in the wrong
02:14 - place we're gonna do here okay so that's
02:18 - that's one of these days I'm gonna be
02:20 - able to move between these okay so let's
02:22 - add a background that's black and let's
02:26 - add a fill that is 255 okay come on
02:32 - there we go
02:35 - there we go so there's that rectangle so
02:37 - what I want to see it now is breathe up
02:39 - and down oscillate up and down so the
02:42 - sine function is a function that will
02:45 - give me a value between negative 1 and 1
02:47 - if I were to graph the sine function and
02:52 - the x-axis here I could think of that
02:55 - angle
02:56 - that's increasing over time I would see
02:59 - a curve like this and that curve is
03:03 - going to oscillate between plus 1 and
03:05 - negative 1 so I could certainly use the
03:08 - map function to and actually probably
03:11 - will I'll use the map function the math
03:14 - is not that complicated so I could take
03:16 - the result of the sine function it's a
03:18 - variable value and if that's between a
03:21 - range of negative 1 1 and I could map
03:24 - that range to 0 into between 0 and 100
03:26 - of course I could just like multiply it
03:28 - by 50 and add 50 but let's use the NAP
03:31 - function why not it's there in p5 so I
03:33 - could say H is now mapped sine of the
03:37 - angle which has a range between negative
03:39 - 1 & 1/2 between 0 and 100 and what we
03:43 - should see now is this so this is the
03:46 - behavior I believe this is simple
03:49 - harmonic motion there's so much that you
03:51 - could do with this right
03:53 - think about layering these all moving at
03:55 - different rates offset from each other
03:57 - with different colors and sounds you
03:59 - know the world is your oyster now and
04:01 - what you could do is like simple
04:02 - harmonic motion but here what I'm going
04:04 - to attempt to do is I'm going to attempt
04:06 - to try to create this now actually I
04:10 - still think maybe I'm not ready for 3d
04:12 - because I think what I want to be able
04:14 - to know that I can do is put a bunch of
04:17 - these in a row all oscillating offset so
04:20 - can I take it make a 2d version of this
04:21 - first let's see if I can do that so how
04:24 - am I going to do that well I could
04:27 - need a loop so let me say X equals zero
04:31 - X is less than with X plus equal and let
04:37 - me go over by 10 pixels and then let me
04:43 - draw each one of these rectangles at X
04:45 - and I'm going to draw it with a width of
04:48 - 9 just so I can see see it in between so
04:51 - this okay so oh I forgot that I
04:54 - translate it to the center so please go
04:59 - away terminal so what I want to do is
05:03 - start X at well I'll just say X minus
05:07 - with divided by 2 here
05:10 - whoops what do I have wrong line 13 4
05:16 - let X equal 0 right okay so there we go
05:19 - now I have a whole sequence of these
05:21 - oscillating but obviously they're all
05:23 - oscillating together and if you see here
05:26 - they're all oscillating slightly offset
05:28 - from each other so what do I need I need
05:30 - an offset so let's make a variable
05:35 - called offset set it equal to 0 and I'm
05:38 - gonna say I mean let's I just wanna let
05:44 - me just say let a equal angle I'm just
05:47 - going to break this up into multiple
05:48 - lines of codes I think that makes things
05:49 - a little simpler so this is this is the
05:53 - same thing but now what I'm going to do
05:56 - is say angle plus offset and then that
05:59 - offset is going to change for each one
06:02 - of those and maybe let's just I don't
06:05 - know let's just try offsetting by the
06:07 - same amount that the angle is increasing
06:09 - so they're all just one step ahead at
06:11 - the previous one there we go
06:14 - now this has a totally different look to
06:17 - it and it's actually like kind of it
06:19 - looks like it's almost like this shape
06:20 - moving to the right I mean I don't know
06:22 - I think we could start to play should
06:23 - probably like hook up some sliders here
06:25 - like with different values I'm gonna get
06:27 - different sort of things like is but is
06:32 - this the right idea it's so funny
06:34 - because it really looks like this thing
06:35 - moving but what is it and maybe I if I
06:39 - make these thick
06:40 - like could I have less of that yeah
06:46 - there we go so you can see this it's
06:48 - really an optical illusion you know by
06:50 - how I play with the size and where there
06:53 - and also like the X should start so I
06:57 - need some more variables here let me
07:00 - make a variable called W which is the
07:02 - width of each one of these and I'm going
07:03 - to set that equal to 24 and I'm gonna
07:07 - say W minus 2 just to give a little
07:09 - buffer between them and then this is
07:12 - also where they start is wrecked X minus
07:15 - width divided by 2 plus W divided by 2
07:17 - and let's have the offset just be
07:20 - perfect again now we can see there we go
07:22 - so what you can see this is all that now
07:25 - in the B's and bombs GIF there certainly
07:29 - is this sense of the center going up and
07:32 - down rippling out to the outside so I
07:34 - might need to think about like how where
07:37 - what angles are starting where the
07:39 - offset is and that sort of thing but I
07:40 - think this is close enough so let's try
07:44 - moving this to 3d ok so a few things I
07:47 - want to do first thing first let's just
07:50 - add WebGL and let's just take out this
07:53 - translate dare I say if WebGL mode works
07:58 - the way I hope and dreams will work I'm
08:01 - actually gonna see the same exact thing
08:03 - right all I did was change the renderer
08:05 - I'm still drawing everything as 2d
08:06 - shapes I just changed the renderer and
08:08 - now I don't have to translate because by
08:10 - default the renderer thinks the center
08:12 - is the center the center of the canvas
08:14 - is zero zero all right so I'm not seeing
08:19 - the shape so let's just see let me
08:21 - change the background here yeah oh whoa
08:26 - first of all look how slow this is crazy
08:30 - how slow it is and the reason why I
08:34 - wasn't getting the the color proper is
08:38 - because well I really shouldn't be using
08:40 - these the rectangle function here in 3d
08:44 - so let's see if we can figure out let's
08:47 - try to make this a little better right
08:48 - now first of all let me put boxes in
08:52 - each in this spot so what I'm gonna do
08:54 - is I'm gonna say push I'm gonna add push
08:57 - and I'm gonna add pop and what I'm going
09:02 - to do is I'm going to just translate by
09:07 - the x-value zero zero and instead of
09:10 - drawing a rectangle I'm going to draw a
09:12 - box of that size so let's see what I get
09:19 - okay oh and incidentally now what I need
09:23 - to do is I need to translate X minus
09:27 - width divided by two so they're all
09:31 - those these are all boxes there are 3d
09:33 - boxes you can't see that they're three T
09:36 - because they don't they I've just seen
09:38 - them from the side but you'll have to
09:40 - bear with me here just to prove that
09:42 - they're 3d what might be worth doing is
09:45 - just saying something like rotate X by
09:48 - that angle so that angle that's
09:50 - affecting this side so we can see that
09:52 - they're there I'm gonna leave that in
09:53 - there just so that we can see this like
09:55 - slow rotation of the scene and I'll even
09:58 - slow it down by like a quarter so what I
10:01 - want to do now is let's see if I can how
10:04 - do I effect the heights only of those
10:05 - boxes so the box has a width a height
10:12 - and a depth so I want lips with the
10:16 - depth I'm just gonna have V W as well so
10:19 - the width and the depth which is along
10:21 - the z axis and the H is the height so
10:24 - let's try doing that there we go
10:27 - now they're spinning Wow look at this I
10:30 - think I'm getting somewhere
10:31 - wow this is kind of crazy looking oh let
10:35 - me take out that spinning let me move
10:40 - the whole thing down a little bit and
10:45 - let me zoom out from it a little bit so
10:47 - I'm gonna translate like everything down
10:50 - like 25 pixels and out like 50 pixels so
10:55 - we're kind of like zoomed away from it I
10:57 - want to see it from above a little bit
10:58 - so if I translate it down even further I
11:02 - guess I need to think about maybe the
11:04 - camera but or I might I could like sort
11:07 - of like
11:08 - rotate everything by like a slight
11:10 - amount like so I want to rotate along
11:13 - the x-axis by like 45 degrees or
11:17 - something oh no I wanted to say rotate X
11:23 - and I want to do it the other direction
11:26 - there we go so I just wanted to get some
11:29 - view on it that somewhat resembles sorry
11:32 - I lost this particular view now one
11:34 - thing you'll notice have you ever played
11:36 - the video game Qbert well what I what
11:40 - this looks like to me I believe is
11:42 - something called isometric perspective
11:44 - or no no no oh yeah orthographic
11:47 - perspective let's look at the p5.js
11:52 - reference for a second reference
11:54 - perspective
11:55 - yeah perspective perspective is a
11:59 - function that kind of says like hey this
12:03 - is where the Candice is what the camera
12:05 - can see this is its view of the world
12:07 - and actually what I want is this
12:11 - function ortho which sets up now there's
12:14 - not a lot of documentation here but it
12:16 - sets up so let me see if I can like
12:19 - orthographic perspective let me do an
12:26 - image search so this of--this is perfect
12:32 - so you can see this is a really nice
12:34 - image here to kind of demonstrate the
12:37 - difference perspective projection has
12:41 - this realistic view of sort of distance
12:44 - and of all of the this idea of like
12:48 - perspective of drawing if you were
12:49 - trying to learn a drawn perspective of
12:51 - how the lines come together to a point
12:53 - where as orthographic projection so
12:57 - perspective is the wrong word I'm saying
12:59 - orthographic perspective that's not
13:01 - right the idea here is the projection
13:03 - creates this highly uniform look and the
13:07 - video game Qbert is probably the most
13:12 - famous sort of example of this kind of
13:16 - orthographic projection so let's add
13:19 - earth
13:21 - graphic projection so I can give it a
13:24 - like a clipping plane or a sort of it's
13:27 - called a frustum like the bounding box
13:30 - of what I want to be able to see with
13:32 - orthographic projection or isometric
13:34 - projection but I think by default if I
13:37 - just say ortho it's going to change and
13:42 - we hit refresh and whoops let me put
13:46 - okay so yeah so you can see now it looks
13:49 - very flat now I need to be able to start
13:53 - to see the different sides of different
13:56 - colors so let me see if I can add maybe
13:59 - at least some directional lighting maybe
14:02 - let's see if I can just add some
14:03 - lighting from the top let me just say
14:06 - directional light 255 and let me add the
14:12 - light from the top so 255 255 255 and
14:17 - then I want the light to point down
14:19 - which is zero negative one comma zero so
14:24 - let's see if this gives us at least some
14:26 - shading mm-hmm and what if I did I
14:34 - probably still have fill in here ah
14:35 - right so I need to fill it's going to
14:37 - take over I need to just give it an
14:39 - ambient material ambient material will
14:43 - allow the box to be affected by the
14:46 - light there we go and I can make the
14:50 - oops and I want the light to be white
14:53 - and we make a make the background black
14:57 - yeah so I'm not really getting a lot of
15:00 - nuance here in terms of but let be let's
15:04 - make the boxes with a little less so
15:09 - there's some space okay
15:12 - and I want to be able to look at it now
15:19 - maybe I should just give it ambient
15:21 - light I could give the different sides
15:25 - I'm lost now alright so how come
15:32 - I am let me let me try rotating how can
15:40 - I see the tops how can I see this shape
15:43 - I need to figure this out
15:44 - Oh ambient light by the way so I don't
15:47 - want to use ambient light I could try a
15:49 - point light I'm looking I'm thinking I'm
15:54 - trying to maybe I'm gonna get a
15:55 - suggestion from the chat I just want to
15:58 - let me let me give it a normal material
16:00 - so normal material is a useful material
16:03 - for debugging because it just gives it
16:04 - an RGB colors to all the different
16:07 - vertices of the shape based on their XY
16:10 - and Z values let me give it normal
16:12 - material alright so actually I think
16:14 - this is doing what I wanted to do now
16:16 - I'm seeing the orthographic projection
16:19 - and I and the normal material is giving
16:21 - me RGB colors for all the vertices but
16:24 - let me let me make the background 100
16:26 - just so I can really see that there we
16:28 - go so this is actually I'm now looking
16:31 - at the correct thing but I'm not
16:32 - actually looking at isometric view
16:35 - here's the thing no I'm gonna leave this
16:36 - like this right now let's try to nest
16:38 - this Luke and let's have a bunch of
16:40 - these so what I'm going to do now is
16:42 - also add an inner loop let's add an
16:47 - outer loop let's add an outer loop for Y
16:54 - and what I'm gonna do with why now is
16:59 - translate Y - height / - okay and let's
17:04 - make the depth also a little bit smaller
17:08 - just to have some spacing there so okay
17:11 - X is not defined where oh this has to be
17:14 - Y thank you okay all right now is this
17:19 - doing what I wanted to do is it doing
17:24 - what I wanted to do and I just and I
17:27 - just a weird sort of view of it so let's
17:30 - try to start altering let's let I want
17:34 - to see what's going on here a little bit
17:36 - so what I'm gonna do actually is rotate
17:38 - X by that angle whoa I've really freaked
17:44 - it out
17:46 - let me take this out let me let me make
17:53 - this just fixed so what is going on for
18:01 - every X for every Y draw a little box
18:11 - okay oh they're all just right next to
18:14 - each other in a line Oh cuz I don't want
18:16 - to I don't want to go along the Y Pilar
18:21 - probably time and I need to use Z of
18:23 - course Z I'm not I'm not
18:26 - of course I need to the Z plane is what
18:29 - is allowing me to create this grid of
18:31 - them Y is what's moving up and down so
18:34 - oh I apologize for this so I'm actually
18:37 - gonna do Z I'll just leave height I'm
18:41 - gonna just I'm going to change the
18:42 - variable to Z though just because I feel
18:44 - like it's gonna be confusing and now
18:51 - yeah we should we see now I have this
18:53 - grid of them and I'm kind of spinning
18:55 - around it in a weird sort of way and
18:59 - what I'm going to do here is and I
19:05 - actually don't need this offset to
19:07 - subtract backwards I don't think Oh
19:10 - actually no that would be good to keep
19:11 - that in there okay
19:13 - what I want to do now hold on everybody
19:17 - is let me take this out okay now there's
19:22 - this plane of them let me put H back in
19:28 - and interestingly enough what's going on
19:33 - here sign
19:35 - Oh angle equals angle plus offset so I
19:38 - want the offset to happen right now just
19:43 - per per row
19:51 - okay so I see this whole row going up
19:55 - and down all right now here's the thing
19:58 - I need to be able to look at this I
20:00 - probably should have done this before I
20:01 - really should have done this before but
20:03 - if I look at isometric perspective
20:06 - actually to see isometric perspective
20:08 - what I need to do is first rotate by 45
20:12 - degrees all about the vertical axis
20:14 - which is X so I'm going to let's get rid
20:21 - of this translate which i think is
20:22 - unhooking leave that in there
20:24 - I don't need rec mode Center I'm gonna
20:26 - rotate X - quarter PI which is 45
20:31 - degrees let's see what that looks like
20:36 - all right that's kind of interesting
20:39 - what's going on here now I want to I I'm
20:43 - kind of looking at it from this weird
20:44 - like top to you I want to turn it so the
20:47 - next thing I want to do is rotate by Y
20:50 - of and let's look at this arc sine or
20:56 - arc tan so I could do one of these so
20:59 - I'm going to do arc tan of 1 divided by
21:02 - the square root of 2 and I should make
21:03 - this a constant somewhere that I save
21:06 - let's do let's call this magic angle and
21:11 - say let's call this I'm just gonna call
21:15 - this MA for magic angle ma equals a tan
21:20 - of square root of 1 divided by square
21:25 - root of 2
21:27 - so let's now rotate Y by that Thank You
21:32 - Alka for having suggested this there we
21:36 - go ooh okay
21:38 - we're in good shape here look I'm seeing
21:39 - this now here's the thing I've got a
21:41 - clipping plane issue like I'm not
21:43 - actually able to see the whole thing so
21:45 - let's deal with that I can with ortho I
21:48 - can say this is the range what I want to
21:50 - be able to see so I want to see between
21:51 - negative 200 and 200 between negative
21:54 - 200 and 200 on the Y and then I want to
21:57 - be I just want to be able to see like a
21:58 - lot along the Z okay that's everything
22:04 - and maybe I should zoom out a little bit
22:06 - just so it's a little further away from
22:11 - me hold on let's get rid of this
22:14 - translate and let's let's say 0 to 500
22:18 - there we go I think then alright
22:21 - oh it's like I've turned it over also
22:24 - boy what a mess so maybe this should be
22:27 - 200 and negative 200 there we go
22:30 - ah kind of getting somewhere look at
22:34 - this kinda getting somewhere okay now I
22:38 - need to deal with my clipping planes and
22:40 - I actually think it might be getting
22:41 - clipped in all whoops there we go I want
22:50 - to look at it from further away so I'm
22:51 - gonna create that so that was too much
22:54 - 300 let's try 300 and boy I could make
22:58 - these variables would really help there
22:59 - we go okay so I'm seeing this thing now
23:03 - it's kind of like a little bit off
23:05 - weirdly
23:09 - okay it's a little bit off weirdly and
23:12 - so what am I missing am I is this just
23:16 - need to be is it is that the Z that's
23:18 - getting clipped yeah okay so now I see
23:22 - the whole thing I see the whole shape
23:28 - now what I need to do is figure out the
23:32 - offset and what I think I could do if I
23:35 - think about this is the offset is not a
23:38 - value related to along the X or along
23:41 - the Y but how far it is from the center
23:45 - so what if I were to come back here and
23:48 - inside my loop have some kind of
23:52 - distance value be the distance between X
23:57 - and Z and not zero zero but with divided
24:03 - by 2 and height divided by two that's
24:05 - how far their I I feel like I should
24:08 - actually have just translated this whole
24:09 - thing off so I would made it easier but
24:12 - because I have all this like offsetting
24:13 - so that's the distance and instead of
24:16 - having this offset
24:17 - like increase what if I just say offset
24:21 - equals map that distance now what's the
24:24 - range I probably should figure out what
24:26 - the maximum distance is the maximum
24:29 - distance is max D is going to be the
24:36 - distance between the center and to under
24:40 - 200 really right that's kind of like the
24:43 - maximum distance so D has a range
24:46 - between 0 and max D and I want that
24:51 - offset I'm just going to make up
24:52 - something between negative 1 and 1 like
24:54 - I want an angular offset for each of
24:56 - those now let's look at this oh it's so
25:00 - slow but this is the right idea right so
25:03 - let's let's make this let's try to make
25:07 - this run a little faster boy boy p5 so
25:12 - there's probably lot of optimization
25:13 - that needs to be done for because we
25:14 - certainly can do this in WebGL we're all
25:17 - going to remake this so a couple things
25:19 - I want to do one is let me make this we
25:22 - make them bigger
25:26 - what is the slowdown okay that's a
25:30 - little bit better now I want this what
25:33 - its mapping to in terms of the height to
25:35 - be a lot taller yeah so I could I need
25:45 - to do some work with like pre saving all
25:47 - the geometry but then I'm getting Elka's
25:51 - making a good suggestion okay so I have
25:53 - to go this challenge the challenge is
25:56 - over let's have the offset be more twice
26:02 - as much there we go Hey look at this
26:15 - [Music]
26:17 - pretty close right pretty pretty pretty
26:22 - close so what have I not done what is I
26:26 - really need to deal with optimizing this
26:27 - one reason it's running so slow I think
26:30 - is actually it's kind of unhappy with
26:32 - having these floating-point numbers for
26:33 - the height of the box so I think if I
26:36 - change this to a two-floor the values
26:42 - but I am getting some weird artifacts
26:44 - here and that's actually if we look at
26:47 - the B's and bombs you'll see that it
26:50 - doesn't actually go to 0 it goes between
26:54 - some set of values so it goes between
26:58 - maybe like 100 and 300 let's try that
27:01 - whoops
27:05 - there we go
27:07 - so that is much more like now could i
27:09 - zoom out on this more so one way I could
27:16 - do that is by translating I don't know
27:22 - if this makes the most sense to do let
27:24 - me zoom out a little bit no you know
27:29 - what I need to do is just change the I
27:32 - think I need to be more thoughtful about
27:37 - the orthographic view okay so I zoomed
27:40 - out a little bit and make more cute let
27:43 - me make more cubes now so let me change
27:47 - this back to like 24 there we go
27:53 - how am i doing so this is moving faster
27:59 - and that offset is even more so let me
28:02 - let me map the offset and actually yeah
28:08 - negative three let me let me just I mean
28:10 - I probably should be thoughtful about
28:12 - this and have that offset be like you
28:16 - know some actual like angle well but
28:22 - that's half PI actually let me just have
28:28 - it between negative PI and PI let's try
28:30 - that there we go this is starting to
28:34 - look good and okay and now let me have
28:40 - it go a little bit faster here's the
28:50 - thing here's what's missing and I'm
28:51 - going to leave as a challenge for you
28:53 - the viewer number one is I've got the
28:56 - perspective slightly off here something
28:59 - slightly wrong right I don't have my
29:01 - angle exactly right right why is there
29:04 - this weird kind of like diagonal there
29:06 - it's also in Reverse everyone's time
29:09 - it's in Reverse so this has got to be an
29:10 - easy way to fix that oh yeah whoo that's
29:14 - kind of nice it's a little bit too fast
29:20 - [Applause]
29:20 - [Music]
29:24 - okay get all the way there but I got
29:27 - pretty close and so the challenge for
29:29 - you the viewer is to fix my mistakes
29:32 - something about the perspective is off I
29:34 - probably need to think about you know
29:36 - the speed and I might like to color use
29:38 - lighting to make it more beautiful what
29:40 - other types of 3d shapes so I'll rotate
29:44 - X after rotate Y can I just do this in
29:47 - the wrong order whoa that's kind of cool
29:52 - something different okay I got to go
29:54 - thanks for watching this coding
29:56 - challenge and I'll see you all later
30:02 - [Music]
