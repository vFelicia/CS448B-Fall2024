00:00 - in this video I'm here to look at
00:02 - something new something kind of exciting
00:05 - to me which is and let me just
00:06 - demonstrate it for you first what I have
00:08 - here right over here is a html5 canvas
00:11 - it's using something called p5.js and I
00:13 - can move my mouse around it and I can
00:15 - click and draw on that canvas but look
00:17 - what happens when I do that when I click
00:18 - and draw on that canvas there's another
00:20 - canvas over here where that same drawing
00:22 - appears and if I come over here and I
00:24 - draw here
00:25 - something in this canvas appears and you
00:27 - can see the color is inverted now this
00:29 - might not seem so magical to you but I
00:31 - I'm making the case to you that these
00:34 - two browser windows with these two
00:35 - canvases could be on separate computers
00:37 - in separate parts of the world so what
00:39 - I'm here to demonstrate to you today in
00:41 - a series of short tutorial videos is how
00:44 - to use server-side programming with your
00:47 - p5.js creative sketch to allow for
00:51 - real-time communication between multiple
00:53 - users of your sketch so this could be
00:55 - used for playing a game or a
00:57 - collaborative something or other you
00:58 - could have video also there's lots of
01:01 - possibilities of things you could do but
01:02 - I'm going to demonstrate it with a basic
01:04 - collaborative shared drawing space so I
01:06 - have we have to add if you're coming to
01:08 - this video having only ever done the
01:10 - basics of programming in JavaScript with
01:12 - p5.js you're in the right place we're
01:14 - going to add something to this which is
01:15 - server-side programming with nodejs
01:18 - now if you've watched any of my videos I
01:20 - have done some stuff about node in some
01:22 - videos about making Twitter BOTS we're
01:24 - going to do something slightly different
01:24 - with node here and I'm gonna start a bit
01:26 - from scratch again so let's um let me
01:30 - talk about what the pieces of this are
01:32 - so for example the idea here is that you
01:37 - have a laptop and that laptop has a
01:40 - browser window with a canvas that you're
01:43 - drawing in and somewhere else in some
01:45 - other part of the world there is another
01:49 - laptop with that canvas and with this
01:51 - canvas and as you draw that same drawing
01:54 - appears over there so somewhere else
01:57 - there needs to be a server what happens
02:02 - is this particular instance of your
02:06 - p5.js sketch talks to that server with
02:09 - something known as a socket socket being
02:13 - a
02:13 - real time connection between two
02:15 - applications that can send data back and
02:17 - forth this particular client also talks
02:21 - to that server we have a socket so that
02:25 - when the user moves the mouse and event
02:28 - is triggered where the X and y
02:31 - coordinate of the mouse is sent to the
02:33 - server the server sends the X and y
02:35 - coordinate of that mouse back to this
02:37 - other one and then this other one
02:38 - receives that message and draws so the
02:40 - issue is you we know how to write a
02:43 - JavaScript program or you move the mouse
02:46 - and you draw stuff that's what's the
02:47 - thing that's happening over here what
02:49 - maybe we don't know how to do what I
02:51 - haven't covered in any of my videos
02:52 - before is how to write this server
02:54 - program and the platform that I'll write
02:57 - the server program in is something
02:59 - called nodejs there are lots and lots
03:03 - and lots and lots and lots of different
03:05 - ways and languages and frameworks and
03:07 - things you could do server-side
03:08 - programming with building big giant web
03:11 - applications is a huge massive scary
03:13 - weird but not foot friendly a nice topic
03:16 - way beyond the scope of what I'm doing
03:18 - here what I want to do is just look at a
03:20 - simple framework node which will allow
03:24 - me to host the files the p5.js sketch as
03:27 - well as make those socket connections so
03:30 - this is the basic sketch of what I want
03:33 - to do and so the first thing I need to
03:35 - show you how to do is download node
03:37 - install node and run something in node
03:41 - and then get two more after I do that
03:44 - questions you can't ask a question
03:45 - because this is a video but but but uh
03:48 - but it's find me somewhere okay so I'm
03:52 - back over here I'm going to close here's
03:53 - my computer I'm going to close this and
03:55 - I'm going to close this and I'll look
03:58 - where I am I am here on the node J s
04:00 - website so if you go to node J s dot
04:03 - o-r-g for quick access place your book
04:06 - works for your blah blah blah
04:08 - I'm download your appropriate version of
04:10 - node run the Installer you can see that
04:12 - I'm doing it here on Mac on a Mac
04:15 - operating system and apple operating
04:16 - system OS X I've downloaded I've
04:18 - installed it once you've done that you
04:21 - should be able to go to a command line
04:23 - view of your computer now on the map
04:27 - the easiest way to do this is with an
04:29 - application called terminal which looks
04:31 - like this and it's usually found in
04:32 - applications utilities on windows insert
04:36 - annotation here which will say the thing
04:38 - you should use on Windows and whoops you
04:42 - can see yeah that I already have a
04:44 - terminal open and we see it it looks
04:46 - something like this and I'm going to
04:47 - make the font bigger but I'm not
04:48 - prepared for this video I'm going to
04:50 - make the font bigger so you can see it
04:52 - better so this is come back to me
04:54 - computer this is a terminal window and
04:57 - terminal window is a place where you can
04:59 - type all sorts of commands in now I'm
05:01 - going to leave but uh you know someday I
05:03 - should make just like introduction to
05:05 - terminal and unix commands type thing
05:07 - but right now i'm just going to give you
05:08 - some basic stuff that you need to know
05:10 - the first thing you want to do it
05:12 - realize is that if you've installed node
05:13 - properly you can just type the word node
05:16 - into terminal and hit run and hit run
05:19 - hit enter and then suddenly you see this
05:21 - other line strangely enough this is now
05:23 - a place where I can type JavaScript like
05:25 - a good say 5 plus 6 equals 11 or I could
05:28 - say VAR x equals 100 and then I could
05:31 - say X plus plus and then I could say X
05:34 - is now 101 somehow I meant to say x
05:40 - equals x plus but but anyway no no X
05:42 - plus plus C yeah I digress the point is
05:47 - I'm somehow now in JavaScript land in
05:49 - terminal but this is not really what I
05:52 - want to do what I really want to do is
05:54 - write JavaScript programs in a text
05:57 - editor that I can trigger from from this
06:01 - node command in terminal and I and I and
06:04 - I I forgot something important over here
06:06 - which is to say that the point of all
06:08 - this is this might be ultimately how you
06:10 - eventually want your application to live
06:12 - a server somewhere in the internet
06:14 - clients all over the world connecting to
06:16 - that server but what I'm doing right now
06:18 - and if you're falling along and doing it
06:19 - too is running all of these pieces on
06:21 - one single machine so I'm going to run
06:23 - the server on my laptop using node I'm
06:26 - going to run the client in the browser
06:28 - on my laptop I'm going to run another
06:29 - client in a separate browser window on
06:31 - my laptop just for testing and making
06:33 - sure it all works ok so over here one of
06:37 - the commands that I control C by the way
06:40 - is how you
06:41 - a clear will get me back up to the top
06:44 - one of the commands that's really
06:45 - important that I want to use is CD for
06:48 - change directory and I want to go to a
06:50 - folder where I have some p5.js files
06:53 - because eventually I'm going to be using
06:55 - a p5.js sketch in connection with what
06:57 - I'm doing so I want to go there and then
06:59 - I'm going to go to the finder and I'm
07:01 - going to go to my desktop because I
07:03 - already made a folder on my desktop
07:05 - called sockets coding rainbow and the
07:07 - only thing in that folder is just kind
07:09 - of like the stuff that you would have
07:10 - for a p5.js sketch an HTML file a sketch
07:14 - das file a libraries folder so if you're
07:16 - trying to follow along you'll pause the
07:17 - video now get yourself a folder with the
07:20 - stuff that you would have with a p5.js
07:22 - sketch in there and then you could keep
07:23 - going so what I want what I can do is
07:25 - when I type cd' is I can take this
07:27 - folder and drag it into terminal and you
07:29 - can see now this is the full path to
07:31 - that directory users slash processing
07:33 - slash desktop slash sockets coding
07:35 - rainbow so if I hit enter I am now in
07:38 - that directory another command that I
07:40 - could type is LS I can see that's
07:41 - listing all the files that are in that
07:43 - directory and in fact I already have
07:45 - hopefully a text editor open to that
07:48 - directory right here you can see because
07:51 - what I want to do in this directory is
07:52 - now make a new file I want to make a
07:55 - file and I'm going to call it a server
07:59 - dot J s notice I now have a new text
08:03 - file called server J s I'm going to open
08:05 - that up and I'm going to just say
08:07 - something like console dot log my socket
08:11 - server is running so here's the magic of
08:15 - node node is a JavaScript program that
08:20 - you can execute from the command line it
08:22 - doesn't involve a browser it doesn't
08:24 - involve a window graphics I mean all
08:27 - those things are possible in this rule
08:28 - and scape of things you might do but
08:30 - this program now that has one line of
08:32 - code in it I can go back to terminal and
08:35 - I can say node server dot Jas I can hit
08:41 - enter and I can see that my socket
08:44 - server is running now my socket server
08:46 - is not running because I don't have any
08:48 - of the code for the socket server here
08:50 - so this is what I'm going to get into in
08:52 - the next video so what if
08:54 - you're following along what you should
08:55 - have now in your head is a general sense
08:59 - of what is going on server-side
09:02 - programming with nodejs
09:04 - conveniently by the way one of the
09:05 - reasons why I picked nodejs is because
09:07 - it's JavaScript so you don't have to
09:09 - learn a new programming language so
09:11 - server-side program with no dot yes
09:13 - you've got that installed on your laptop
09:15 - you've got the idea of making a p5.js
09:17 - sketch so and then you have a directory
09:20 - that has both a node program in it under
09:24 - sketch jas and your p5.js i'm sorry
09:27 - under server touches and your p5.js
09:29 - files and once you have that maybe put
09:32 - some test code in server j/s run that
09:36 - test code you've got node running you've
09:37 - got your p5 chess MTP 5 GS sketch ready
09:40 - to go and you'll be ready for the next
09:41 - step which is starting to add the actual
09:43 - code for the socket server
