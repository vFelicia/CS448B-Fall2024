00:03 - okay we've looked at Angles we hopefully
00:05 - feel somewhat comfortable with
00:06 - trigonometry now we're ready for the
00:08 - next step the next step is simple
00:10 - harmonic motion what is that well we
00:13 - there's lots of examples of that that we
00:15 - could find that we're actually going to
00:16 - model in in the next video after this
00:18 - one we're going to we're going to model
00:19 - actual The Swinging of a pendulum we're
00:21 - going to look at the bobbing of a spring
00:23 - how can we model those things through
00:25 - forces um but we could think of lots of
00:28 - examples plucking of a string maybe the
00:30 - flapping of a butterfly's Wings we could
00:32 - even model with simple harmonic motion
00:35 - so how could we model simple harmonic
00:36 - motion well there is one incredibly
00:38 - simple way of doing it and so to do that
00:41 - let's take a look at um the sign
00:43 - function so if you've ever seen a graph
00:45 - of the sign
00:46 - function because maybe that's what you
00:48 - look at in your spare time it's going to
00:51 - look something like this it's a wave
00:55 - pattern right if this is a graph of y
00:58 - equals s of
01:00 - X now a couple things we should note
01:03 - about this this looks quite a bit like a
01:04 - soundwave a lot of what we're talking
01:06 - about here if you're a sound person you
01:09 - know way more about this than me you can
01:11 - correct everything in the comments below
01:14 - but one of the things so the sign
01:15 - function gives us this wave pattern so
01:18 - we've been we used sign to do kind of a
01:19 - polar to cartisian transformation thing
01:21 - in the previous video now we're just
01:23 - saying hey if sign gives us this nice
01:25 - wave pattern couldn't we draw that wave
01:28 - pattern on the screen or couldn't we we
01:30 - map the an object's location its Y
01:32 - location to the results of the sign
01:34 - function and have something move up and
01:36 - down notice something about this sign
01:38 - function it doesn't look like
01:40 - this right if it looked like this this
01:43 - would be kind of like our I just learned
01:45 - to program bouncing ball example right
01:47 - it hits the side it it goes over this
01:49 - way it hits the side turns around we
01:50 - have this nice easing to the top and
01:52 - speeding up and easing into the bottom
01:54 - and easing out of the bottom and easing
01:55 - to the top and easing right the fact
01:57 - that there's this nice smooth curve is
01:59 - something we can really used to our
02:00 - advantage in modeling different types of
02:02 - motion and behavior on the screen so a
02:05 - couple things about this one thing we
02:06 - should say is waves have properties to
02:08 - them um two properties that we can think
02:11 - of is one is
02:13 - amplitude and the other is period and
02:16 - I'll put here in parentheses
02:18 - frequency frequency is really just one
02:21 - divided by period so let's look at what
02:23 - those mean so amplitude uh it refers to
02:26 - the height of the wave the difference
02:28 - between the maximum part of the wave W
02:30 - and the minimum part of the wave you
02:31 - might remember some stuff about this
02:32 - when we looked at pearing noise
02:35 - actually maximum part of the wave to the
02:37 - minimum part of the
02:39 - wave that is the
02:42 - amplitude period is the amount of time
02:45 - it takes for the wave to repeat itself
02:48 - how long is one cycle that repeats and
02:51 - we can see here how long is that this if
02:54 - we look from here to here this is this
02:57 - section is an entire cycle of this wave
03:00 - and so this length is the period so a
03:04 - smaller period is faster oscillations a
03:07 - longer period is slower
03:10 - oscillations because I have no props or
03:12 - diagrams I'm just doing weird things
03:14 - with my body okay so these are the
03:16 - things we want to control if we are
03:18 - modeling the butterflyes wings is it a
03:21 - big amplitude are those big flapping or
03:24 - small flapping are the flapping very
03:27 - fast a low period or very slow a big
03:30 - period and frequency by the way is just
03:32 - the inverse of Peri of is how many how
03:35 - many uh Cycles in one unit of time so
03:38 - this is a very high frequency and this
03:40 - is a very low frequency so okay so
03:44 - that's all kind of in the abstract but
03:46 - how does this map to a processing sketch
03:48 - so let's think about that for a moment
03:50 - let's create a processing window I'm
03:52 - recording
03:53 - excellent a processing window and let's
03:56 - say we want to have this object just
03:57 - simply oscillate to the edge of the
03:59 - screen and all the way back back and
04:01 - forth oscillating back and forth so what
04:05 - is the amplitude of this oscillating
04:07 - motion well the amplitude we could think
04:09 - of as this distance from the center to
04:12 - the edge we could think of that as width
04:15 - divided two excellent what is the period
04:19 - what is the period in this oscillation
04:21 - well we say how long does it take for
04:24 - one cycle what is our unit of time like
04:27 - how long what like the aha I just
04:31 - thought of it in processing our unit of
04:34 - time is frames so we can think of how
04:36 - many frames does it take for it to get
04:39 - all the way to this side and all the way
04:41 - back to get to do one from from from
04:43 - from the center and back again so one
04:45 - full cycle we could think of in frames
04:47 - maybe our period we say is 200
04:50 - frames so now what we need is a
04:56 - Formula we need to say if if we are
05:03 - um if we are trying to get the X
05:06 - location oscillating with this amplitude
05:08 - in this period how do we do that okay
05:11 - well let's go back to the sign
05:14 - function s of an angle what is the
05:16 - amplitude of that of the result of the
05:18 - sign function well actually s oscillates
05:22 - between one and negative 1 the biggest
05:25 - number you'll ever get out of the sign
05:27 - function is one the smallest number
05:29 - you'll ever get out of the sign function
05:31 - is negative 1 trust me you're never
05:32 - going to get anything bigger than a one
05:33 - or smaller than a negative 1 so if we
05:36 - say the value of x in this oscillation
05:39 - is equal to the sign of something and
05:43 - I'm probably going to run out of space
05:44 - here the sign of something if we
05:46 - multiply it by
05:50 - amplitude if we multiply something that
05:53 - goes between one and negative 1 by width
05:55 - divided by two we're going between width
05:57 - divided two and negative width byid by
05:59 - two so we can take the result of the
06:01 - sign function and multiply it by
06:03 - amplitude now how do we get the period H
06:07 - so in
06:10 - processing okay well first of all what
06:12 - is the period of the sign function well
06:14 - remember a
06:16 - circle full rotation of a circle well if
06:19 - we look at this this is zero what's over
06:23 - here 2 pi what's over here 4 Pi so every
06:27 - 2 pi in the sign function it repeats
06:30 - right if you remember that in our polar
06:32 - to cartisian coordinate transformation
06:34 - it takes us 2 pi radians to get all the
06:36 - way around you can think of going around
06:38 - in a circle almost as an oscillating
06:39 - motion so a full period for the sign
06:44 - function just the way it is is 2 pi so
06:46 - what we want to do is say hey if we take
06:50 - I'm going to just make these parentheses
06:52 - down here frame
06:55 - count what frame are we currently on
06:58 - divided by
07:01 - period and multiply that by 2
07:04 - pi now we're going to have oscillation
07:08 - according to the period we want now why
07:11 - does that formula work frame count
07:13 - divided period time 2 pi remember 2 pi
07:17 - gives us a full cycle through the sign
07:19 - function so when frame count is zero
07:21 - what's 0 divided by period zero when
07:24 - frame count is 100 what's 100 divided
07:27 - period 0.5 so we're halfway way through
07:30 - the full cycle when frame count is 200
07:33 - 200 divided period is 1 so you can see
07:36 - this is like a ratio of our current
07:38 - frame count to the period how what
07:41 - percent are we 10% of the way through
07:42 - the period 50% 60% multiply that by 2 pi
07:46 - and we have this full cycle let's go see
07:48 - that actually work in a processing
07:51 - sketch so here we are I have a
07:54 - processing sketch here which is all set
07:55 - up and ready to go we have x equal to
07:58 - zero and we're drawing a Circle at X but
08:00 - now we want to M we want to have that
08:02 - Circle oscillate back and forth so we
08:04 - can say x
08:05 - equals so let's give ourselves an
08:10 - amplitude of uh width divide
08:14 - 360 and a period of uh we said 200
08:19 - frames so X is equal to that amplitude
08:23 - times s of frame count divided by
08:27 - period and I'm going to run out of space
08:30 - it's very sad so I'm going to make this
08:32 - a little wider I'm wasting time in this
08:34 - video doing that but uh and um I'm going
08:37 - to say frame count divided by period
08:39 - times 2 pi so by the way you can say two
08:42 - times pi but there's a built-in constant
08:44 - in processing 2core Pi so if we run this
08:49 - now we can see we have this oscillating
08:51 - motion so it's as if there was almost
08:54 - maybe a rubber band a spring it might
08:56 - have looked better if it was moving up
08:57 - and down this maybe looked a little
08:58 - weird moving right and left but you can
09:00 - see here we go we've got this nice
09:03 - oscillating motion back and forth very
09:07 - simple with a period of 200 now that
09:09 - that can be flexible you know we could
09:11 - adjust the period you can see if I make
09:13 - a period of 30 it's going to oscillate
09:15 - back and forth much longer if I make a
09:18 - smaller
09:20 - amplitude it's going to just oscillate
09:22 - back and forth like that so so here's
09:25 - the thing this is kind
09:27 - of okay uh little
09:29 - example mishap I'm going to edit this
09:31 - back and starting
09:33 - now okay um so here's the
09:37 - thing okay so this works we have this
09:40 - nice little oscillating motion and we've
09:42 - really like we've got our period down
09:44 - exactly mapped to frame count we have
09:46 - our amplitude but honestly like using
09:48 - this elaborate formula is not really
09:50 - that practical and uh what I want to
09:52 - look at over here right we we've written
09:55 - out this formula which in kind of a
09:57 - messy way
09:59 - but really I can just I want to erase
10:01 - this part of the formula and I want to
10:03 - go back and put these parentheses here
10:05 - and ask a question what goes in there so
10:09 - we had this what what we put in there if
10:11 - we look over here really quickly is like
10:12 - amp frame count divided by period time 2
10:15 - pi but what we really want in there what
10:18 - really what is that what ises that
10:20 - formula resulting it's a number that
10:22 - kind of goes up every frame right frame
10:26 - count is zero and then you divide by the
10:27 - period and then frame count is one and
10:28 - then you divide by the the period in
10:29 - frame count two and you divide by the
10:30 - period it would be much simpler if we
10:32 - just made up a variable called a or
10:34 - Theta and said A Plus equal 0.0 run and
10:38 - what is that that's really angular
10:41 - velocity I guess you can't probably see
10:43 - the bottom here um I got to work on that
10:45 - I know I said that before I swear I'm
10:46 - gon to get better um okay so what's
10:50 - going on here we could really simplify
10:51 - this example by using the concept of
10:54 - angle as position angular velocity
10:57 - angular acceleration and and we don't
10:59 - even need in this case we could we don't
11:00 - even need acceleration but we could see
11:02 - that this is a simpler way to do it and
11:05 - um with a higher angular velocity we're
11:07 - going to have a shorter period with a
11:09 - lower angular velocity we're going to
11:11 - have a longer period and let's take a
11:12 - look at that so here we are over here
11:15 - we're going to simplify this example
11:18 - fumbling fumbling here we go we're going
11:21 - to simplify this example I'm Gonna Save
11:24 - it as something um and I'm GNA say hey
11:27 - you know what just put a variable in
11:30 - there call it angle and forget about
11:32 - period make a variable called angle and
11:35 - let's just say angle plus equal
11:40 - 0.05 uh oops not a
11:43 - angle let's run that and see what we get
11:46 - it's pretty similar oh it's too slow I
11:48 - want faster oscillation faster all we
11:50 - need to do is increment that angle quite
11:52 - a bit more let's increment it a lot more
11:54 - and we could see I have faster so you
11:56 - could control that oscillating Motion in
11:58 - a much simpler way and we could even add
12:00 - acceleration to it as an exercise you
12:02 - might just add acceleration to this so
12:04 - this is incredibly simple a really
12:07 - simple way of using the sign function to
12:08 - give us angular uh oscillating motion
12:10 - simple harmonic motion now what can you
12:13 - do with this um we could easily probably
12:15 - make this video an hour and just keep
12:17 - going through example after example and
12:19 - what I want to do just very briefly is
12:21 - show you a few additional examples of
12:23 - how you could take this a step further
12:25 - and what I would suggest to you is you
12:26 - know look at these and try to recreate
12:28 - them yourself as an exercise and you can
12:30 - always go and look up the answers um
12:32 - they're linked uh the examples are
12:33 - linked in the GitHub repo so first first
12:36 - of all um one thing you could do to this
12:37 - is just think okay it's oscillating
12:39 - along the x-axis what if I also have it
12:41 - oscillate along the y-axis what would
12:43 - that look like well here's an example of
12:45 - what that looks like also with many many
12:47 - objects all oscillating so different
12:49 - periods different amplitudes along the X
12:52 - and Y AIS and you can see where you have
12:53 - these sort of um different um
12:55 - oscillating motions so you could uh you
12:58 - could create this kind kind of I don't
12:59 - know what to call this strange thing um
13:03 - by oscillating along multiple axes with
13:05 - variable um frequencies and uh
13:08 - amplitudes another thing we might look
13:10 - at is what if we took this one
13:12 - oscillating motion instead of having
13:15 - oscillate left to right have it
13:16 - oscillate up and down and what if we put
13:18 - one next to it and one next to it and
13:19 - one next to it a array of them all
13:21 - oscillating up and down with slightly
13:24 - off slightly off at a slightly different
13:26 - moment in
13:27 - time if we do that we get this so we can
13:30 - actually use the sign function
13:32 - essentially graph that sign function all
13:34 - these are just oscillating up and down
13:36 - they're just this one starts first then
13:38 - this one then this one then this one
13:39 - they're all oscillating up at different
13:41 - points in time and you get this kind of
13:42 - wave snaky pattern incidentally if you
13:45 - do this and try to do it with pear and
13:46 - noise that's pretty interesting as well
13:48 - you'll get um you'll get kind of a more
13:50 - random oscillating motion now once you
13:53 - know how to do this with what where you
13:55 - start to get really interesting wave
13:57 - patterns is if you say let me add a
13:59 - bunch of waves together what if I take
14:01 - um let me just describe this to you are
14:04 - we over here yes what if I take a
14:09 - wave with this period and amplitude and
14:13 - take one with this period and amplitude
14:15 - and then take one with the I I can't do
14:18 - three I don't know why I tried to do
14:20 - three right we kind of looked at this
14:22 - earlier with pearing noise if we add
14:23 - these two waves together maybe we get
14:26 - this pattern so one thing you can is
14:29 - start um having multiple oscillations
14:32 - adding them all together to create
14:34 - different um different P um more
14:36 - sophisticated patterns and I think I
14:37 - have an example that I can briefly
14:39 - demonstrate to you here this is example
14:41 - 3.9 in the GitHub repo so you can see
14:44 - look at this wave this wave is the
14:45 - result of a bunch of different random
14:47 - waves added together I think if I no I
14:50 - thought if I click the mouse it resets
14:51 - but each time I run it's a different
14:53 - wave pattern so you can see um in this
14:56 - example the way the code has been uded
14:57 - is we have an array of amplitudes and an
14:59 - array of of CH of of of of angular
15:03 - velocities and the last thing I think
15:06 - what what you might actually really look
15:07 - at um which is maybe perhaps most
15:10 - relevant to um the stuff that we're
15:12 - doing here is take a look at this
15:14 - oscillating motion what if you consider
15:16 - that to be the legs of an insect or the
15:17 - wings of an insect what if an object
15:20 - that you have moving all the around the
15:22 - screen According to some
15:24 - um in in two-dimensional space what if
15:27 - that object could have its own intern
15:28 - internal motion so it's almost it's its
15:31 - little legs are propelling itself around
15:33 - the screen it's oscillating back and
15:34 - forth back and forth back and forth the
15:35 - faster it moves the more it accelerates
15:37 - the more those legs the the the shorter
15:40 - that period becomes when it slows down
15:41 - the period becomes longer so I have
15:44 - perhaps what I would look maybe uh offer
15:47 - is perhaps one of the Lamer versions of
15:49 - this but you can see an incredibly
15:50 - simple in version of that idea is that
15:52 - this these objects are moving according
15:54 - to position velocity acceleration with
15:56 - attraction this is the same example as
15:59 - in Chapter 2 forces attraction but each
16:01 - one has this little oscillating dot that
16:04 - the faster that's tied it's its period
16:06 - is tied to its velocity the faster it
16:08 - moves the faster it oscillates so it's
16:11 - as if it's kind of trying to like pull
16:13 - itself around the screen like that so
16:15 - you could come up probably with
16:16 - something much more creative and
16:17 - visually interesting to that and you
16:18 - could think of like lots of legs of a
16:20 - centipede that would be I would say a
16:22 - good exercise a kind of project for you
16:24 - I know was we're going to look at a
16:25 - pendulum in spring in a moment but you
16:27 - could really stop here and create a the
16:29 - whole project around the internal
16:30 - mechanics of of of an object that
16:33 - oscillates as it moves throughout the
16:34 - screen okay so uh that ends this uh
16:38 - video that's a um send me some projects
16:40 - you make and um we're going to look at
16:43 - in the next two videos we're going to
16:44 - look at a pendulum and a and a spring
16:46 - modeling a pendulum and a spring
