00:00 - i don't want to be able to hear you i
00:01 - need to turn that on
00:02 - [Music]
00:12 - this has to go here
00:14 - hello okay
00:16 - can you hear me
00:18 - yes hold on let me fix this camera
00:27 - can you hear me i can yes that's very
00:29 - exciting this totally works
00:33 - and can you see what i'm uh
00:35 - doing here in the white on the
00:36 - whiteboard
00:38 - yes
00:39 - hello
00:44 - um
00:46 - uh
00:46 - [Music]
00:48 - now i'm getting a loop
00:50 - what do you mean you're getting a loop
00:55 - the stream is behind but that doesn't
00:56 - matter
00:59 - um okay i'm looking for a marker
01:03 - um
01:04 - i guess actually maybe
01:07 - no
01:07 - it's a terrible idea
01:09 - i was trying okay wait i lost my marker
01:12 - oh there they are there they are
01:14 - okay
01:17 - everything's gonna be okay now
01:20 - did you witness the loop that i heard
01:23 - no i didn't there was no loop that i
01:26 - could
01:27 - notice
01:29 - all those times where you answered
01:31 - whether or not you could hear me you
01:33 - didn't hear those
01:35 - no because i only said that once
01:39 - are you
01:41 - or do you have the stream open in
01:43 - addition to the hangout or only the
01:45 - hangout
01:46 - [Music]
01:53 - i don't know if there's anybody watching
01:55 - i can juggle that why do you think that
01:56 - shawna this is actually a processing
01:59 - juggling show
02:02 - these are very hard to juggle
02:05 - these uh
02:06 - they don't flip and they don't like
02:08 - softly land in your hand
02:10 - um you can also probably balance one on
02:12 - my nose
02:16 - they can't never mind i was doing good
02:18 - though okay uh
02:21 - this works
02:23 - are you where are you are you just in
02:24 - the hallway yeah i'm just in the hole
02:26 - you want me to you want me to go
02:28 - somewhere quieter well i think i can
02:31 - hear your speakers
02:33 - no not yours i feel like my speakers are
02:36 - going into your microphone
02:39 - maybe not i thought i heard a little
02:40 - feedback
02:42 - i just want to make sure it's not a
02:44 - proximity thing
02:46 - i don't um
02:48 - i don't uh
02:51 - yeah i don't know how i could be giving
02:52 - you no you're probably right okay so i
02:55 - what i want to do here
02:58 - is check and see if there's anybody
03:04 - um
03:06 - all right so i don't know
03:09 - i don't see any way on the youtube thing
03:10 - to tell how many people are watching or
03:13 - if there's any way to
03:15 - there's no chat there's a leave a
03:17 - comment
03:19 - the youtube thing is behind so it's
03:20 - confusing for me to look at that
03:24 - it is behind
03:26 - twitter okay okay if you're watching
03:32 - uh
03:34 - post a ques a question about processing
03:38 - on twitter oh wait i see no there is
03:40 - somebody left to comment
03:47 - ask
03:48 - a question
03:58 - is this visible that would be like that
04:00 - would be the thing the other thing is
04:02 - i don't know how you can't there's no i
04:04 - have to invite you to the hangout
04:07 - but this works i could just actually do
04:09 - uh i have to record
04:12 - a list of videos to make just make one
04:14 - of them
04:15 - it's kind of funny it would be live
04:18 - uh but there's no i mean i need i need a
04:20 - like a wall of uh screens with faces or
04:23 - something
04:25 - yeah let's see i don't i doubt there's
04:26 - anybody really watching this
04:36 - all right so maybe we should maybe we
04:38 - need to find somebody on the itp floor
04:40 - who wants to like
04:41 - join in and ask is like working on
04:43 - something you could ask a question to
04:44 - try
04:45 - you want me to go look around i'll look
04:47 - around sure okay
04:50 - in the meantime i will recite lyrics
04:52 - from
04:53 - my name is
04:55 - no i can't pronounce um or
04:57 - i wish i had like interesting strange
04:59 - tricks i could do but juggling is about
05:02 - it i don't have anything good to juggle
05:10 - let's see here
05:21 - somebody leave a comment
05:25 - somebody did leave a comment people are
05:27 - watching
05:35 - nobody working on any processing stuff
05:52 - are you guys worth
05:53 - any manner or form
05:55 - what's that
05:56 - right now yes
05:58 - yes
06:03 - do you want to ask dan shiffman any
06:05 - questions
06:07 - he's doing live uh
06:10 - office hours
06:12 - throughout this or this is
06:14 - we're talking we're trying things out
06:15 - yeah yeah
06:17 - is that a google hangout it is a google
06:19 - hangout yeah
06:21 - um
06:22 - so how do we get them into the hangout i
06:24 - would have to know so what i need is the
06:28 - gmail that i can invite to the hangout
06:31 - you need to know their their google id
06:35 - yeah
06:36 - that's correct
06:38 - oh hello
06:40 - wait
06:41 - we're in the conference room hello
06:46 - okay let's hang out see what i really
06:48 - need is what i need is a monitor right
06:50 - here
06:51 - that has a hangout on it so i could look
06:54 - at it and talk to it because right now
06:56 - what i'm doing is i see the hangout over
06:58 - here
07:00 - so i'm going to pretend i'm just i can
07:02 - basically only hear you
07:06 - i only have audio at the moment
07:08 - so you can ask your question it has to
07:10 - be audio
07:13 - do you want to use my computer yeah we
07:15 - could just
07:16 - yeah so let me just launch process
07:22 - whatever you know what what else is a
07:24 - problem dan what
07:27 - is that when you type
07:29 - and you're on a hangout it mutes your
07:31 - audio
07:32 - seriously
07:35 - yeah
07:37 - [Applause]
07:39 - we
07:41 - are you able to hear us right now i can
07:42 - hear you yeah
07:44 - okay we can hear it okay are you able to
07:46 - see our screen
07:48 - uh if you do screen sharing and i walk
07:50 - over here
07:52 - i do have the hangout open
07:55 - so we can do this and he could see the
07:59 - processing sketch that's amazing
08:02 - so now you can see our processing sketch
08:04 - yeah
08:05 - right then you can see it yes i can
08:08 - can you scroll on oh oh just screenshot
08:10 - i see so it's whatever
08:14 - so if you wanted to
08:16 - ask him any processing questions like in
08:18 - this he could help out yeah
08:21 - so so
08:22 - in your experience like if you had some
08:25 - like if you run into difficulties you
08:27 - think it would be enough this would be
08:28 - enough or do you think he would need to
08:31 - be interacting with the sketch
08:34 - that would be
08:35 - you know good better if he can like if
08:38 - he could yeah
08:40 - dan show them what you can do here like
08:43 - what well here the thing is is i was
08:45 - imagining that maybe i might if i'm
08:47 - going to do one of these have people
08:48 - submit stuff in advance through dropbox
08:51 - so i would have sketch folders
08:53 - just ready to go
08:55 - over here
08:57 - that's so good do you like him like
08:59 - standing there and really
09:01 - we could
09:02 - look at that so you could um
09:04 - i mean i you know maybe you don't
09:06 - actually have anything but you you could
09:08 - like email something to me or stick it
09:10 - share dropbox with
09:12 - forget which account this is
09:14 - uh
09:17 - you can share to
09:27 - if you share anything via dropbox to
09:31 - videos and shiffman.net
09:34 - then i can get it instantly
09:37 - uh over here so
09:41 - yeah
09:42 - oh yeah i did i just hit the button
09:44 - share via dropbox
09:46 - this is great
09:48 - videos how long did they let you do
09:50 - these
09:50 - uh hangouts on here i think you can go
09:53 - forever
09:55 - forever forever and ever can i get a
09:58 - little chamber pot put over here and
10:00 - then exactly
10:02 - well actually we'll get you a feeding
10:03 - tube and a catheter
10:06 - very awkward
10:09 - okay
10:10 - so this is how you can share anybody
10:12 - watching
10:13 - all
10:14 - maybe one of you watching
10:17 - um you could
10:19 - tweet a question or share processing
10:21 - sketches
10:23 - to videos
10:25 - let's see let's see oh
10:28 - let's see what's happening on twitter
10:32 - uh
10:34 - richard gill says i don't have a
10:36 - question but i am watching hello
10:52 - [Music]
10:53 - and how many ways
11:00 - yeah how often
11:19 - let's see this is what i see
11:23 - this is very meta
11:29 - it's strange the when you have the
11:30 - screen sharing up it's a little
11:31 - disconcerting because it feels like
11:33 - nobody's there
11:37 - there we go there's me
11:40 - um
11:42 - how do i find the dropbox how do i find
11:44 - your dropbox
11:47 - videos
11:50 - so i have to go to the dropbox
12:01 - any other tweets dan
12:05 - let's see uh
12:10 - yes good question hi
12:12 - sean van every from
12:14 - um
12:15 - wichita kansas writes in and says
12:18 - is that even a place i don't know um oh
12:20 - yeah can you see me oh yeah says how
12:23 - often will you do this okay so this is
12:25 - just a test
12:26 - clearly we're completely disorganized
12:29 - i don't really know what we're doing but
12:30 - um
12:31 - my plan is starting in the fall starting
12:33 - in september we will do this at a
12:35 - specific time once per week
12:38 - uh or at least every other week
12:40 - um and that there will be a time by
12:42 - which you can submit questions so that
12:44 - maybe on an email box or something where
12:46 - you could submit questions in advance
12:48 - and then i will pick a few and we'll do
12:50 - like an hour an hour kind of thing where
12:53 - you know do like uh four questions 15
12:56 - minutes each or something
12:58 - it'll be awesome it'll be music and
13:00 - dancing except without the music and
13:02 - dancing
13:05 - oh okay somebody else writes in
13:08 - ah okay look oh my goodness
13:11 - this is a very hard question okay i got
13:13 - a question is there a processing library
13:16 - for quad tree
13:19 - detection
13:20 - um
13:22 - not that i know
13:24 - um so um
13:26 - you know if you use so you might be
13:29 - wondering
13:30 - not the person who asked the question
13:31 - probably because they presumably know
13:33 - what quad tree collision detection is i
13:34 - i don't really but i have a big idea in
13:36 - my mind but essentially we you have this
13:39 - problem when you're working on a sketch
13:41 - that has lots of things in it
13:45 - let's say you have this sketch
13:48 - and it has lots of objects in it let's
13:50 - say each object has to check if it's
13:52 - colliding with another object and if you
13:54 - just have two of them each object you
13:57 - know object
13:58 - a has to check well hey that's a bad
14:00 - example let's say let's say you have
14:01 - three
14:02 - you have a b and c object a has to check
14:05 - against a b and c
14:07 - object b has to check against a b and c
14:10 - and object c has to check against a b
14:12 - and c
14:14 - okay so if you have three things this is
14:16 - one two three four five six seven eight
14:18 - nine three times three is nine this is
14:21 - an n squared algorithm meaning the
14:23 - number of elements that you have to do
14:25 - collision detection you need to need to
14:27 - do that number square so if you have
14:31 - three you've got to do nine so let's
14:33 - look at it this way by the way if you
14:34 - have zero
14:36 - if you have 10 you have to do 100. if
14:39 - you have 100
14:42 - you have to do ten thousand if you have
14:44 - one thousand you have to do
14:48 - i'll do one million um
14:51 - one billion
14:54 - thank you for pretending to laugh but
14:56 - one person who's watching this this is
14:58 - great i'm watching okay so um there's
15:02 - three of us in here watching oh three
15:04 - excellent and possibly a four or five
15:06 - okay so if you notice we just went up by
15:08 - a factor of 10 but
15:13 - we're going up by a factor of a hund of
15:15 - of a hundred so
15:17 - we're we're getting these mass amounts
15:18 - this and this becomes incredibly
15:19 - incredibly slow this is the problem i
15:21 - forgot where once you have a lot of
15:23 - things on the screen to check if they're
15:24 - colliding becomes incredibly slow so
15:26 - there are all sorts of fancy ways of
15:29 - figuring out how you could say like oh
15:31 - we could divide the screen into cells
15:34 - and we could maybe have just these
15:36 - objects check against other objects in
15:37 - their cells that's called bin ladies
15:39 - spatial subdivision and in fact
15:43 - if you're looking for an example of that
15:46 - look no farther than
15:54 - chapter six i believe
15:58 - um
15:59 - so this in the nature of code which is
16:01 - natureofcode.com
16:03 - in chapter six
16:06 - uh i think
16:09 - uh in 6 15 i kind of go i kind of go
16:12 - through and describe
16:14 - at least how to do sorry i lost where
16:15 - this was
16:21 - huh oh here it is
16:23 - so i kind of walk through this example
16:25 - of how to do
16:26 - uh bin lad spatial subdivision in the
16:28 - context of a flocking example and i
16:31 - think that i have
16:33 - do i have on this machine it would be
16:35 - sad if i didn't i do all the nature of
16:37 - code examples i will just demonstrate
16:39 - this for you very briefly by the way we
16:41 - haven't talked anything about quad three
16:42 - but
16:43 - you know kind of on the way there maybe
16:45 - i'll
16:45 - you know i'm kind of avoiding that
16:46 - sounds like a very complicated topic
16:48 - that i would possibly understand so
16:49 - we'll mention that in a second um okay
16:51 - so i go to chapter six
16:54 - and
16:55 - the example i'm looking for is bin
16:56 - ladies spatial subdivision
16:59 - let me just run
17:01 - this example in processing very briefly
17:04 - so here is
17:05 - a
17:06 - sketch now on google hangout you
17:08 - probably can't really notice that the
17:11 - animation is very slow but you can see
17:13 - this over here frame rate
17:16 - 12 12 frames per second this is 2 000
17:19 - objects each determining if they're
17:21 - touching another object they turn white
17:23 - if they're not they turn green it's only
17:24 - running at 12 frames per second very
17:26 - very slow that's with no bin lattice
17:29 - spatial subdivision
17:31 - with bin laden spatial subdivision
17:33 - subdivision which apparently i can't say
17:35 - we can see now that we're getting a nice
17:37 - frame rate of like 45 frames per second
17:39 - exactly the same
17:41 - but it's much faster so
17:44 - um uh what was i saying so you know i
17:47 - didn't actually go through the details
17:48 - of how bin ladies space tools
17:50 - subdivision works because
17:52 - i have no idea what i'm doing some weird
17:54 - live google hangout rambling thing but
17:56 - um
17:58 - but it's essentially an algorithm that
18:00 - just allows you to subdivide your window
18:02 - into different cells all of equal within
18:05 - height so there are fancier things like
18:07 - quadtree which allow you to be more what
18:10 - you know what if suddenly all of the in
18:12 - a flocking simulation all the voids are
18:14 - suddenly in the bottom right hand corner
18:16 - of the window you're going to have to do
18:18 - something more sophisticated to be able
18:19 - to get any type of optimal collision
18:21 - detection but the question was asked is
18:23 - there a library for quad 3 something
18:26 - around collision section
18:28 - but i'm pretty sure that box 2d which
18:30 - you can use in processing
18:32 - employs
18:33 - uh if not quadri something similar to
18:36 - optimize its collision detection because
18:38 - it's certainly not doing those um
18:41 - i i would i would almost be i'm almost
18:43 - certain that it's not doing a kind of
18:44 - raw brute force collision detection
18:46 - thing
18:47 - okay yeah is that raw brute force way
18:49 - that you described in the beginning the
18:51 - n squared one yes
18:54 - is that actually the brute force way or
18:56 - would you say
18:57 - is eight is a touching b and c oh i
19:00 - gotta i gotta run for a minute
19:06 - asking how do we get ending okay let's
19:08 - see we have some more uh maybe some more
19:11 - questions that are being asked on
19:12 - twitter
19:13 - oh
19:14 - no just somebody retweeted that this was
19:16 - happening
19:18 - hey dan i actually have to hop off okay
19:27 - okay bye bye guys i'm gonna um
19:30 - hang out here for a little bit longer if
19:32 - anybody wants to ask a question
19:34 - but how do we get into the hangout yeah
19:36 - so can you send can you tweet at dan
19:39 - your your google
19:41 - i guess you'd have to direct message me
19:43 - if you don't want it to be in public but
19:44 - i need
19:45 - to join hang out
19:49 - where
19:51 - twitter just dm him google you can also
19:54 - just email it to me or email him your
19:57 - group your google app email and then
19:59 - he'll invite you to hang out
20:02 - i guess i'll
20:03 - email me
20:08 - hello
20:09 - good how are you
20:20 - uh let's see here
20:25 - somebody shout let's see
20:34 - i heard somebody at the door
20:37 - uh
20:39 - okay let's see i think i'm getting a
20:41 - message i need another little podium
20:43 - here
20:45 - no
20:46 - no messages
20:50 - ah
20:52 - oh somebody sent a sketch
20:56 - okay um
20:58 - oh no i need it wasn't it was emailed to
21:00 - me so i got an email actually which with
21:04 - a sketch here but it wasn't sent via
21:05 - dropbox so i have to um
21:08 - uh let me see if i can get it let me see
21:10 - if i can pull it open
21:13 - i really don't want to log in oh the
21:15 - camera cut out hold on everybody
21:23 - hello okay so uh somebody sent me an
21:25 - email i'm gonna have to share it via
21:27 - dropbox myself
21:29 - because i uh i don't want to log into my
21:32 - email on a
21:33 - live stream but people send me lots of
21:36 - very private and touching beautiful
21:38 - messages that i know they wouldn't want
21:40 - to
21:41 - see it online okay um ship share
21:45 - dropbox
21:48 - sorry everyone
21:52 - i'll have this in a moment
21:58 - i don't know how what do you what do
21:59 - people like on the radio there's you're
22:01 - not ever supposed to have silence is
22:03 - this kind of like the radio dropbox
22:05 - share
22:06 - uh share this folder
22:12 - with uh videos at shiftmoon.net
22:19 - okay so this is coming in from
22:25 - this is coming in from
22:30 - from joel
22:31 - uh matthew i don't know maybe i'm not
22:33 - supposed to say people's names i don't
22:34 - know it's quick okay uh let's see if i
22:37 - can get this sketch now that was sent to
22:38 - me uh
22:41 - dropbox ah invited to share except
22:55 - hit accept right
22:58 - let's go to dropbox folder there it is
23:01 - here it is okay
23:03 - so let's look at this um so we've got a
23:05 - nice little sketch here i think the
23:07 - files are still coming in
23:09 - still downloading so we'll wait so let's
23:11 - look at the question um i test a ball
23:14 - the question says i'm reading i test the
23:16 - ball for collision
23:18 - the the text collision is 95 of the time
23:20 - but occasionally the ball
23:22 - falls right through
23:24 - so
23:25 - i'm not sure if it's a um
23:28 - voice it's really slow
23:30 - it's not in yet i'm not sure if this is
23:33 - a ball versus ball collision or a ball
23:37 - versus wall collision but
23:39 - i wonder we're gonna look at the sketch
23:41 - in a second but if you have a sketch
23:43 - where you have this ball and you're
23:45 - testing right if this is like the bottom
23:47 - of the screen
23:48 - height maybe you have an if statement
23:51 - where you say if y is greater than
23:53 - height
23:56 - maybe you're testing if the ball goes
23:58 - past
23:59 - this part then you're going to do
24:01 - something like hey maybe there's a
24:02 - variable called y speed which is telling
24:05 - us how the ball is moving down and
24:07 - you're saying y speed equals y speed
24:09 - times negative one this we're going to
24:12 - see if the code is actually related to
24:13 - this question but this
24:17 - is potentially a problem why is this a
24:20 - problem you know we don't really know
24:22 - different things could be happening
24:24 - you know you can seems like an exact
24:26 - science but uh we could have a situation
24:28 - where the ball goes past the height
24:31 - it turns around
24:33 - but it doesn't actually make it all the
24:35 - way back it turns around and just goes
24:37 - to here
24:38 - and then what's that problem it's still
24:40 - below height so this would still be true
24:42 - and it would tell it to go back down so
24:44 - you can often get these scenarios where
24:45 - something is stuck
24:47 - below the surface now there's nobody
24:49 - there's nobody to talk back to me
24:52 - because i don't know nobody's on the
24:53 - hangout right now but um
24:55 - but there's a nice solution to this
24:57 - which is what we could often do is just
24:59 - set y directly to height so that if the
25:03 - ball goes down in addition to setting it
25:05 - back we also sneak its location right
25:07 - back there so we kind of like nudge it
25:09 - back onto the screen but let's see let
25:11 - me try to go back to the sketch
25:14 - which is now downloaded
25:16 - um okay so one thing that's interesting
25:18 - about this is i'm getting ah here we go
25:24 - javascript
25:27 - intersect whoa
25:29 - okay so this is going to be a big
25:32 - so this is not we're going to run this
25:34 - and maybe we'll see that there's a
25:35 - problem but this is probably going to be
25:37 - much too this is a large sketch than
25:39 - about kind of having looked at it
25:40 - uh and there's already some other
25:43 - stuff
25:45 - going on audio stuff so i'm gonna i
25:47 - guess i'm gonna have to unfortunately
25:49 - speak more generally or less
25:52 - uh
25:53 - uh unless um
25:55 - whoever sent this in wants to try to ask
25:57 - a more specific question about the
25:59 - scenario but right now i don't want to
26:01 - uh
26:03 - because i could like sign off and debug
26:05 - and sign back on okay wait i got a
26:07 - message here uh
26:09 - no link
26:11 - you you just have to share
26:14 - with videos
26:18 - okay um now let's see what's happening
26:20 - on twitter
26:22 - thank you for doing this live stream
26:23 - it's quite interesting
26:25 - uh
26:27 - we will hang out with okay um
26:31 - so if you want to maybe i'm gonna check
26:33 - my email maybe somebody emailed me oh
26:36 - you can't see me right now hurry up
26:38 - maybe somebody emailed me
26:40 - to get invited to the hangout
26:52 - okay wait uh i've got somebody who maybe
26:54 - wants to join i'm going to try to invite
26:56 - them
27:02 - let's see if i can do this
27:06 - um i really don't like where this podium
27:08 - is but i have to work on this later okay
27:11 - invite invite
27:13 - interestingly enough unless you're the
27:15 - original creator of the hangout
27:18 - you cannot invite someone
27:23 - so let me see if
27:26 - you can invite
27:34 - yes
28:00 - hello
28:15 - all right we have somebody
28:16 - yeah that's me hi dan this is dave
28:18 - pentecost hi nice to see you virtually
28:21 - almost in person the other day but now
28:23 - virtually
28:25 - this is great uh running the screen
28:28 - behind you that's a nice trick
28:30 - thank you
28:33 - um okay so what's going on what's
28:34 - happening today in uh
28:37 - processing land
28:39 - uh well uh andres was around all weekend
28:44 - uh are actually saturday evening to uh
28:49 - what's that
28:51 - i think um
28:52 - you might have the stream open in a
28:54 - different window
28:56 - yeah i do hold on
28:59 - all right we have somebody
29:02 - it's kind of like in the old days when
29:04 - they said turn your radio down
29:07 - okay i've stopped it in another window
29:10 - can you
29:10 - can you see me or am i screwing things
29:13 - up here no no you're absolutely fine i
29:15 - actually can't see you but i can hear
29:16 - you
29:17 - i can't see you if i look over here so
29:19 - now i can see you
29:20 - okay i'm standing over here in this
29:22 - direction i don't see anyone okay well
29:24 - but now i don't see you on the oh right
29:29 - there we go
29:31 - yep
29:35 - so uh so andres was here
29:38 - can you hear me yeah yeah
29:40 - yeah so andres was here and um
29:44 - uh he struggled a bit with this uh with
29:47 - this hemispheric projection it turns out
29:50 - the fisheye that's in version two
29:53 - is not the right thing it's not the
29:55 - right fisheye for the dome
29:57 - uh he came to a conclusion that it's a
30:00 - lot more complicated than he expected
30:03 - and
30:04 - he started working with
30:07 - a different approach well we know that
30:08 - there's a 1.5 version somebody else came
30:11 - up with
30:12 - and
30:14 - that we can use with some of the samples
30:16 - including some of uh
30:19 - robert hodgins
30:21 - things we could try that with that but
30:23 - for the 2.0 stuff he's still struggling
30:28 - with your camera yeah camera goes off
30:30 - every 30 minutes
30:32 - okay um so let me know i don't know that
30:35 - anybody else is actually watching this
30:36 - but just um also because i have some
30:38 - questions just this might be just an
30:40 - interesting brief discussion that we can
30:41 - have so you uh have a
30:44 - uh planetarium dome
30:46 - so it's uh
30:48 - and is it just a single projector or
30:50 - what's the kind of a single computer
30:53 - what's the setup
30:54 - yeah okay so it's a single fisheye
30:57 - projector i wanted to wanted to make it
30:59 - as simple as possible for anybody
31:02 - like you or andres or anybody any other
31:04 - visualizers to come in and
31:07 - uh plug in and immediately put things up
31:10 - there but the coolest thing
31:12 - of course would be if we can frame any
31:15 - of the processing sketches with
31:17 - a fisheye view so it uh it looks in
31:21 - perspective we can have things floating
31:22 - around us in the dawn
31:24 - right so if you just took a regular
31:27 - processing sketch
31:28 - put it through the projector and
31:29 - projected it would look distorted is
31:31 - that what's happening without right if
31:34 - if it's um
31:36 - yeah you see a distorted rectangle
31:38 - depending on the size of uh of the
31:40 - sketch you'll see a distorted rectangle
31:42 - we can do that we can throw it up there
31:45 - right um and
31:46 - but if it's in a circle that's 1200 by
31:50 - 1200 pixels 1200 diameter
31:53 - then it can fill the dome
31:56 - if it's a radial sketch it might look
31:58 - cool in the dome but if it's a 3d sketch
32:01 - we've got to impose this
32:04 - this
32:05 - hemispheric projection on it for it to
32:08 - look in perspective so it ideally should
32:10 - be a
32:12 - circular and 1200 pixels in diameter
32:14 - right our our projector actually is uh
32:18 - goes up to 1600 pixels but right now we
32:21 - have
32:22 - the windows computer that's running the
32:25 - astronomy software
32:26 - in uh
32:28 - dueling dvi at 1600 and i'm in an hdmi
32:33 - input which only goes up to 1200. so
32:35 - 1200 is pretty i mean the 1200 is
32:38 - manageable for computing purposes and
32:41 - it's pretty simple anybody can come in
32:43 - and plug in
32:45 - i wonder if even just using something
32:47 - like mad mapper would somehow have like
32:50 - a
32:51 - it could take like a little simple 3d
32:53 - model of
32:54 - the dough and then uh
32:58 - the process well the problem is
33:01 - yeah the problem is
33:02 - you really have to simulate a 180 degree
33:06 - fisheye lens
33:08 - right so
33:11 - you need to create you need to do it
33:13 - with a uh you know one of these cubic
33:15 - projections that are actually like
33:18 - having a bunch of cameras that you then
33:20 - shoot the results from and project up
33:22 - there
33:24 - interesting well the good news is
33:26 - if there's anybody well suited to figure
33:27 - this out his name is andres
33:31 - yeah that's what i thought too but he
33:33 - was pretty stumped last night he left a
33:35 - little dejected but he's determined
33:38 - um so i look forward to having a chance
33:41 - to come look at it too
33:44 - right yeah it's it's pretty fun as i say
33:46 - you know almost anything projected up in
33:48 - the dome looks cool
33:50 - it's coolest if it
33:52 - if it's up there in proper perspective
33:54 - if you're a stickler about that
33:56 - right
33:58 - uh and also since you're going to be
34:00 - doing these this unit with your students
34:03 - about
34:04 - projecting space which looks very cool
34:07 - um
34:08 - this you know i i mean
34:11 - projecting space on a flat screen that's
34:13 - how we look at everything
34:15 - everywhere else besides the planetarium
34:17 - but they might find it uh interesting to
34:20 - see it actually surrounding them so yeah
34:23 - it would be perfect i mean my
34:25 - kind of idea would be to have
34:28 - some basic examples that show how to
34:30 - make a sketch that would run
34:32 - there and let the students play with it
34:33 - and then actually go over and try them
34:35 - out
34:36 - right it's gonna be once uh andres has
34:39 - the
34:40 - the uh
34:42 - the bugs worked out on this it's gonna
34:44 - be a pretty simple matter to drop your
34:46 - sketch into a draw scene
34:49 - uh area in his fisheye
34:52 - met up right awesome so that'll be
34:55 - that'll be fun and i think you'll find
34:57 - it interesting i want to i want to
34:59 - connect you as i i said in the email i
35:02 - think i want to connect you with uh
35:04 - carter emmerd
35:05 - who has kind of spearheaded this
35:07 - radicalization do you know carter uh yes
35:10 - i've met him before he came here at itp
35:12 - to give a presentation okay so you know
35:14 - you know what he's done yeah yeah
35:16 - and uh so a lot i i read robert hodgins
35:20 - um uh post about going going trying to
35:24 - figure out how to deal with the
35:26 - distances and the sizes of uh
35:29 - of the astronomical objects and
35:32 - presumably carter and his uh ex-students
35:35 - have wrestled with this and come up with
35:37 - this solution so you can you can see
35:39 - what you think when you see that working
35:41 - too awesome
35:44 - so now i've now i've hijacked your
35:47 - information here no no there's no so
35:50 - this is just actually a test we are just
35:52 - trying to test to see if this system
35:54 - here in this room which i've been using
35:56 - to record
35:57 - stuff could also be broadcast live
36:00 - and the things that the thing that i've
36:02 - discovered is you google hangouts which
36:04 - you can broadcast
36:05 - um people can't just add themselves they
36:08 - have to be invited so i need a system
36:10 - by which i either have people in advance
36:12 - or that they can um as well as sort of
36:15 - hard to kind of manage and figure out
36:17 - like if people can ask a question or
36:19 - whatever but i i i thank you for
36:22 - calling in
36:23 - because that was really helpful to kind
36:25 - of test this and i'm gonna just kind of
36:27 - see if there are any other
36:28 - uh twitter messages or emails of other
36:30 - people who might want to ask a question
36:31 - or try and i'm probably
36:32 - oh it's 4 15 i'll probably turn this i
36:35 - have to go soon so i'll probably turn
36:36 - this off
36:37 - okay you better better get on to your
36:39 - other customers
36:41 - i did have one more question
36:43 - how do you do the superimposition of you
36:46 - on the screen have you got a little
36:47 - device there
36:49 - so um
36:50 - this has actually been done so you're
36:52 - referring to the fact that yeah yeah so
36:55 - um the good news is i'm going to we've
36:57 - made a documentation video about how all
36:59 - of this stuff works in this room which i
37:01 - just need to post which will explain it
37:04 - with more detail but the short answer is
37:06 - um there is a camera and a laptop and
37:10 - both the feed from the camera which is
37:12 - recording me excuse me in the feed from
37:13 - the laptop which is you're seeing here
37:15 - both go into one machine as capture
37:18 - devices and software called wirecast
37:20 - is uh compositing them and this is just
37:22 - a green screen so right here is a green
37:24 - screen which you can actually see i
37:26 - think i'm in the hangout right right i
37:29 - figured it was a green you can see this
37:31 - is there's the actual laptop
37:33 - yep this is just a green screen and uh
37:37 - they're being if this is obviously the
37:39 - non-composited view
37:41 - uh there and then this is the composite
37:43 - view
37:44 - yep
37:45 - thank you awesome thanks for calling and
37:47 - i'll be in touch over email okay okay
37:54 - all right let's see
37:55 - um okay so let's see what else oh i'm in
37:58 - the wrong place here
38:00 - um
38:01 - i guess i'm going to i feel like i
38:04 - should have a song or something to
38:06 - finish off with let's see either no
38:08 - other twitter messages
38:13 - there are there's a youtube comment that
38:15 - says hi
38:18 - and i don't have any emails
38:20 - so um i think actually it's 4 15 this
38:23 - was a good test
38:25 - if you like this
38:26 - maybe we'll do it again
38:28 - um
38:29 - i don't know what's a nice song uh to
38:32 - finish
38:33 - off with uh we were testing uh audio
38:36 - with fanfare from the cop for the common
38:38 - man of course they're gonna make us
38:39 - watch an ad
38:41 - hey it's interesting because i can't
38:42 - tell it's just like think this ad
38:57 - thank you everyone for tuning in if um i
39:00 - don't know that i'll do another test uh
39:03 - i don't know that i will do another test
39:04 - this summer uh but i will i might do one
39:08 - more test this summer uh but the we're
39:11 - going to kind of organize this a bit
39:13 - more and try to make this a weekly event
39:15 - where you could
39:16 - possibly ask questions over twitter
39:18 - maybe maybe you could join the hangout
39:20 - to actually be here and ask questions i
39:22 - don't know if anyone's watching um
39:24 - but i guess this gets recorded so um and
39:28 - maybe some way of like sharing sketches
39:29 - through dropbox so if you have ideas uh
39:32 - for how this might work better or if you
39:33 - have a question
39:34 - you want to ask for like again i
39:36 - probably do this till september you can
39:37 - send me an email
39:40 - um know with your sketch attached so i'm
39:43 - gonna figure out how to turn this off
39:45 - which i think i have to go to this
39:46 - computer
39:48 - and click end the broadcast i'm gonna
39:51 - click end broadcast i think the hangout
39:52 - will still be here
39:54 - but the broadcast will open
