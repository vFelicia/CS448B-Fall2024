00:00 - as always another audio visualization
00:02 - video and the previous one left us weird
00:05 - like shaking crazy graphing the volume
00:07 - of a sound file and what I want to do
00:10 - now and it was a great suggestion from
00:11 - Oliver and the chat is instead of
00:15 - graphing as a graph along say an x-axis
00:19 - what if I took this graph and wrapped it
00:23 - around a circle and the way to do that
00:26 - is to think about a circle as a bunch of
00:31 - points that are based on an angle and a
00:34 - radius so if that angle iterates all
00:36 - around the circle but the radius changes
00:39 - according to the volume then maybe we've
00:41 - got something so let's see if we can
00:44 - implement that so I need to I'm going to
00:46 - just kind of like simplify the code for
00:48 - a second so I'm gonna pull this out I'm
00:50 - gonna pull out the push oh oh that's
00:56 - fine I'll reverse engineer all this code
00:58 - later I made a new version but that's
01:00 - fine I'm going to take out this line and
01:05 - then run it again as always I've always
01:07 - pretty great to play this so what I want
01:12 - to do now instead is say ok what if I
01:15 - I'm gonna do a begin shape and shape and
01:18 - I'm gonna say I is less than 360 and I
01:23 - now I need to have I is the angle right
01:25 - so first of all I want to I want to have
01:28 - the sketch in think in terms of degrees
01:31 - I can by default p5 we'll think in width
01:34 - of angles in a unit of measurement
01:35 - called radians but I want to think in
01:37 - terms of degrees here and I can say VAR
01:39 - x equals and this is a math formula that
01:43 - converts from an angle and a radius to
01:45 - an x and y position which is R times
01:48 - cosine of that angle that's X and VAR y
01:53 - equals R times sine of that angle and I
01:56 - can now have a vertex at X comma Y and I
02:03 - can say R equals just 100 let me run
02:07 - this I think there's that circle around
02:09 - if your
02:11 - so what I want to do now is right before
02:14 - he or say translate with / - let's let's
02:19 - have the centre be in the center and put
02:24 - a semicolon here and here we go
02:25 - as always our goal stop there do not let
02:29 - this stop this is the Cartesian
02:34 - coordinate systems and now what I'm
02:37 - going to do is are can be based on the
02:45 - volume so it can be let's just say it's
02:46 - between 10 and 100 based on what the
02:50 - volume is and I can get this out of here
02:53 - oops that pop is unnecessary and I want
02:56 - to only ever have 360 elements in the
03:00 - array and now I can do this as always I
03:04 - always forget the Vista all right so
03:18 - there's plenty more I could I could keep
03:20 - going with this you can make it rainbow
03:22 - color that could fill it in to stop
03:24 - colors I could have the colors respond
03:27 - to something else I encourage you to
03:30 - this version and stuff in the next video
03:33 - and then show you had okay thanks for
03:39 - watching another video where I'm
