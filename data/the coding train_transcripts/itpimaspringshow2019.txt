00:00 - Hello!
00:01 - What you're about to
watch is an edited version
00:02 - of a live stream that I
did almost a month ago.
00:04 - This was actually the sixth
time that I've done that.
00:07 - It was the end-of-semester
ITP and IMA Spring Show 2019.
00:12 - I teach here at a program called ITP
00:15 - that's a two-year master's program,
00:16 - and also IMA, our Interactive Media Arts,
00:18 - that's an undergraduate major
00:19 - at Tisch School of the
Arts, New York University.
00:21 - At the end of every semester
00:23 - all the students get
together and do a show,
00:25 - two nights only, of their work.
00:27 - So, I wandered around with a camera,
00:29 - and a bunch of people helping me,
00:30 - and it was lots of fun,
00:31 - and had a microphone, and
looked at various projects.
00:33 - You can watch the full live stream.
00:35 - It's a little over two hours,
00:36 - if you wanna check this
video's description,
00:37 - or enjoy this highlight reel.
00:40 - Happy summer!
00:41 - Have a wonderful summer!
00:42 - See you in some future
coding training videos.
00:44 - (train whistle blows)
00:45 - (happy easy-going music)
00:52 - - Can we see the dinosaur project?
00:54 - Can the dinosaur explain
the dinosaur project?
00:56 - - I'm Emily.
00:58 - - I'm Maya Pruitt.
01:00 - Dylan the Dino.
01:01 - - Dylan the Dino.
01:02 - - And we have another group-mate, Mingna.
01:04 - - Yes.
01:06 - - For this piece, we partnered
with Dr. Michael Rampino,
01:10 - who's a geologist, and
also a researcher, at NYU.
01:14 - He specifically studies mass extinction.
01:16 - So we made an AR app
01:18 - where people are invited
to become a geologist
01:21 - by scanning the rock layers
for evidence of mass extinction
01:25 - and more information
about earth's history.
01:28 - - This is your tool.
01:29 - And if you find an
object, you can scan it,
01:32 - and an AR component will appear.
01:34 - This one's one of our favorites.
01:35 - We call him Ancestor Shrew,
01:37 - because he is the ancestor
of all placental mammals.
01:41 - - I'm Chenhe, and this is Yves.
01:43 - - I'm Yves.
01:44 - - And this is our project.
01:46 - We did this.
01:47 - We called it White Mountain, Black Water.
01:50 - This is simply, you drop down the water,
01:52 - and make a song.
01:55 - - [Teacher] That is the
most magical thing ever.
01:57 - What is the substance
that you're dripping?
02:00 - - [Chenhe] That's water.
02:02 - Ink water.
02:03 - - [Teacher] Ink water.
02:04 - - [Chenhe] Just ink and water, yeah.
02:07 - - This is an acrylic sheet,
and then we painted it
02:09 - with water-resistant spray,
02:12 - so that's why the water
is behaving like that.
02:14 - - [Teacher] How do you do the sensing?
02:16 - - That's the camera.
02:17 - - [Teacher] The camera!
02:18 - - [Chenhe] Yeah.
02:19 - - My name is Yiyao,
02:19 - and this is my physics project
called Life in a Nutshell.
02:23 - There is two parts.
02:25 - The first part is a series of sculptures.
02:28 - They have 13 from birth
to death as a cycle.
02:32 - The second part is an
interactive installation.
02:35 - People can interact with it,
02:37 - and they need to make a pose
02:39 - exactly like what the sculpture shows,
02:42 - and then they will become
part of the character
02:44 - to experience different stages of life.
02:50 - (peaceful electronic music)
02:54 - - I'm Bora Aydingtug.
02:55 - This is Feedback Mirror.
02:57 - Made in processing.
02:58 - It's using the letter I to
visualize the camera image.
03:03 - It's also measuring the overall image
03:05 - to create some sort of feedback.
03:07 - There are two different angles.
03:09 - One is the angle that's mapped
03:11 - to the brightness of the camera image.
03:13 - The other one is the brightness
data of the overall image.
03:18 - So, if the elements started
touching each other,
03:21 - they start doing these recursive patterns.
03:24 - - It's called I Can't Breathe.
03:27 - It's a homage piece to
Eric Gardner's last words
03:30 - in the documentation of how he died.
03:32 - It's a data visualization piece
03:35 - of black deaths at the
hand of police brutality.
03:41 - Essentially what happens
is this screen goes through
03:43 - the days of a calendar year,
03:46 - and on a day where there
were no documented deaths
03:49 - of black lives, the lungs breath gently.
03:52 - On a day where, as we're
witnessing right now,
03:55 - somebody lost their life--
03:58 - A person of color lost their
life to the hand of an officer.
04:01 - The calendar pauses.
04:03 - The lungs completely deflate,
and shrivel, and crunch.
04:08 - Then very, very slowly reinflate
04:11 - before the calendar moves to the next day.
04:14 - That continues over the course of,
04:16 - in this iteration, one month,
04:18 - accounting for 27 deaths.
04:19 - But, I actually have a data set
04:21 - that accounts for every day between now,
04:24 - moving backwards to January 2013,
04:26 - which is accumulative of 1,742 deaths,
04:31 - 80% of which have had no
judicial investigation,
04:34 - and 73% which were unarmed.
04:38 - My next iteration will hopefully
04:40 - account for that entire data set.
04:42 - It takes two hours just to
witness January 2018 alone.
04:46 - That's what I have today.
04:48 - - Hi!
04:49 - My name is Jim Schmitz,
04:50 - and this is my project, it's
my thesis project at ITP.
04:54 - My thesis is about
applying a style transfer
04:57 - to 360 imagery.
05:00 - A style transfer is a
computational technique
05:02 - where you can reimagine a photograph
05:03 - in the style of a painting.
05:06 - Using images from Google Street View,
05:08 - I am able to create art
that forms a connection--
05:14 - That inspires a viewer to connect
with the actual locations.
05:18 - The neat thing about this is that
05:20 - the style is even and continuous.
05:24 - There are no seams.
05:25 - Which is different from the way
05:27 - that other style transfers end up
05:29 - when they're applied to 360 imagery.
05:32 - (happy jazzy music)
05:39 - - My name is Stefan.
05:40 - Stefan Skripak.
05:42 - - So what you're looking
at is a USB device
05:44 - that is connected--
05:46 - That reacts to your browser
usage, your internet usage.
05:51 - If you visit a bandwidth-heavy website,
05:54 - it will switch from what it's in now,
05:56 - which is cooling mode,
05:57 - which is actually cooling
the inside to heating.
06:01 - When you--
06:02 - What's in here is actually
an iceberg shaped ice cube.
06:06 - So, when you switch to heating mode,
06:07 - it dramatically increases the speed
06:11 - at which the iceberg melts.
06:13 - Once enough of it has melted,
06:15 - it will actually trigger
a simulated short circuit,
06:18 - which leads to all the
monitors shutting off,
06:21 - and prevents you from using
the device any further.
06:24 - - Hi!
06:24 - My name is Yang and I'm
a second-year student.
06:27 - I'm graduating, and this
is my thesis project.
06:30 - It's called Magical Pencil.
06:31 - The idea is, whatever you draw
in this game becomes real.
06:36 - You don't need to find
an item when you need it.
06:40 - Whenever you need
something, you just draw it.
06:42 - You can use it solve
puzzles on your journey.
06:48 - Let's see like, you can drive a van.
06:53 - Yeah, let's drive.
06:56 - So, keep going.
06:59 - - [Person Off-Screen] Yeah!
07:00 - - [Yang] Yeah!
07:04 - - My name's Lauren Race.
07:05 - I'm a designer and I
used participatory design
07:09 - with five low-vision and
blind designers and makers
07:12 - to convert all the material
07:14 - that's used to teach
physical computing at ITP
07:16 - to tactile.
07:20 - These are the original
symbols from the p-comp site.
07:25 - I printed them out,
07:26 - and I ran them through what's
called a Swell-Form machine,
07:29 - which reacts to carbon and black ink,
07:31 - causing it to puff up.
07:34 - This is the 11th iteration of each symbol
07:37 - using participatory design.
07:39 - What happened after that was
07:41 - it became like a funnel.
07:42 - So, if somebody needed a
schematic that was tactile,
07:45 - they'd come to me.
07:46 - And I realized I was the
only one making them,
07:48 - so what I did was I created
a style guide with templates
07:51 - so teachers and students and designers
07:53 - can come in and use the templates
07:56 - to make their own tactile schematic.
07:59 - - My name is Tinayi,
08:00 - and this is a project for a team of three.
08:03 - Helen and Chunhan, they're
also in this project.
08:07 - We're making a music box for our children
08:09 - specifically age from four to six.
08:11 - We just want to deliver
a very playful experience
08:15 - to encourage them to be more
interested with music-making,
08:19 - and also maybe become DJ or
composer when they're young.
08:31 - (flute-like music)
08:34 - - My name is Ada.
08:35 - This project is called Sonic Cubes.
08:38 - This is an instrument--
08:40 - A set of instruments I made
for a final performance
08:43 - I did for this class sound and space
08:46 - using a 17 speaker setup.
08:50 - (electronic music changing
with block configuration)
09:05 - (calm jazzy music)
09:14 - - My name is Kemi.
09:15 - Adekemi Sijuwade.
09:17 - I have a multi-modal thumb piano
09:20 - that you can play in the
browser live several ways.
09:25 - Uses facial recognition
to allow you to play.
09:30 - The other way of playing
is with a touch screen.
09:37 - - My name is Billy Bennett
09:38 - and I have a p5 sketch with some particles
09:42 - which you may recognize from
the Nature of Code series.
09:45 - (people laughing)
09:47 - But, yeah, I rigged up this musical wand
09:50 - to play music as you swing it across,
09:54 - of Hailu Mergia, who's
an Ethiopian jazz artist.
09:58 - He has this kind of
rolling right hand style
10:01 - in his music that I try
to mimic with this wand,
10:04 - so you don't skip any notes.
10:10 - - I'm Ella!
10:10 - Nice to meet you guys.
10:12 - I'm graduating this year, and
this is my thesis project,
10:15 - which is called Breath We Live.
10:17 - This is a breathing meditation
for one to two person,
10:20 - in a very dark and immersive studio.
10:23 - The purpose of this is to allow people to
10:26 - practice their breathing meditation
10:27 - and how this breathing as a primary note
10:30 - is linked to nature and environment.
10:32 - That we always notice that our breathings
10:34 - were part of the nature.
10:35 - But we don't see it right away.
10:37 - So, I wanna use breathing
as a part of a way to
10:39 - allow people to understand
10:40 - their breathing meditation activity,
10:42 - and also understand that these
small changes of breathings
10:46 - affecting the environment
in a more impactful way.
10:51 - - I'm Casey Conchinha,
and this is p5.js Shaders.
10:56 - I worked on it with my
partner Louise Lessel.
11:00 - It's essentially a collection of examples
11:03 - of shaders in p5 that are basically--
11:07 - And a guide to basically
show people what they can do
11:11 - with shaders in p5.
11:12 - Why they'd wanna use the shaders in p5
11:14 - versus your load pixels function.
11:17 - I have them all running in my browser,
11:19 - and it's not slowing down at all.
11:21 - They're very performative,
11:23 - which is one of the main reasons
why you'd wanna use them.
11:26 - - My name is Anna.
11:27 - I'm a first-year.
11:28 - My project is Apron Video Controller.
11:31 - 'Cause when I'm cooking,
11:33 - I'm usually watching a YouTube video,
11:36 - but I don't wanna touch my
iPad with my greasy hand,
11:40 - so if I'm wearing this apron,
I don't need to touch it.
11:43 - I can control video with this apron.
11:46 - Playing the video.
11:48 - And then pause, play, whatever I want.
11:51 - Then if I miss some part,
I can go back, backward.
11:56 - Also, I can control the
volume, like a zipper.
12:01 - Louder.
12:03 - And then quieter.
12:05 - - Everybody, I'm Elizabeth.
12:07 - I worked on a project where
12:09 - I looked for people in
the Library of Congress
12:12 - who are featured in the New York Times
12:15 - as overlooked obituary feature.
12:18 - I put together a data
set of these 16 people,
12:24 - who are about half the people
12:25 - who have been recently given obituaries,
12:27 - only for the first time.
12:28 - Some people--
12:29 - You might be surprised that they didn't
12:31 - receive an obituary at the time they died.
12:33 - The questions down here
correspond to the buttons
12:36 - that you can press to find out, like,
12:40 - are they in the Library
of Congress at all?
12:41 - Do they have a name authority file?
12:45 - Do they have a subject heading?
12:47 - - Hi, everyone!
12:48 - My name's Chelsea Chen.
12:49 - This is my project.
12:50 - I called it Now You Are
In The Conversation.
12:53 - The reason why I made it is because
12:54 - I'm so tired about people taking photos
12:57 - in museums and exhibitions.
13:00 - Sometimes they really don't
care about the artwork itself.
13:02 - They only wanted to pose on Instagram.
13:05 - So, I made a very Instagrammable piece.
13:08 - When you're trying to take
a photo of it, it stops.
13:14 - It stopped.
- It stopped.
13:15 - - And when you put your phone down...
13:17 - - I'm James Hosken.
13:19 - This is 100 Days of Spaceships.
13:23 - The class was 100 days of making,
13:24 - which was about iterating on a theme.
13:26 - So, for 100 days, each day,
you have to make something new.
13:31 - Part of the class is
about trying to break free
13:33 - from the chains of perfectionism.
13:35 - It doesn't matter if it's good or not.
13:37 - You just have to post it.
13:38 - Another part of the class
was posting it publicly.
13:42 - This was all on Instagram.
13:44 - Each of these posters represents two days
13:46 - of spaceship making.
13:48 - The first day was modeling a spaceship,
13:50 - and the second was
animating the spaceship.
13:53 - - My name is Sukanya, and this
is a collaboration with Nick,
13:56 - who is run away right now.
13:57 - It's a project surveillance.
14:00 - It's essentially a router.
14:02 - The router leaks liquid as data is leaking
14:05 - to third parties as you
browse the internet.
14:08 - We go to Buzzfeed for example.
14:12 - These are the sort of
domains it's hitting,
14:15 - which are not Buzzfeed.
14:16 - These are third parties.
14:18 - As you can see, there's this
liquid that starts running.
14:22 - It's basically just to
shed light on the fact
14:24 - that there's this whole
industry going around
14:27 - on surveillance for profit,
14:30 - and sort of tracking your behavior online,
14:32 - and creating these profiles of you.
14:35 - (calm jazzy music)
14:39 - - This is a location-tracking
/ surveillance project.
14:45 - The goal is to identify devices,
14:47 - and see where they are on the floor.
14:50 - What we're doing is, we're
basically scanning the NYU wifi,
14:55 - and looking at different access points,
14:57 - and seeing who's connected
to which access point.
14:59 - If we know who's connected
to which access point,
15:01 - we kind of know, in that radius
15:02 - where the devices are located.
15:05 - We used a monitor mode wireless adapter
15:09 - with huge antennas, and
a thing called Aircrack.
15:13 - It's an open-source software
which runs on a Linux machine,
15:16 - which is used for penetration testing.
15:19 - - My name is Yuguang,
15:20 - and my project is called Cats.
15:24 - It is my experiment on generate of film
15:28 - completely using AI.
15:30 - This is the very, very
first step of doing that.
15:33 - What you're seeing now
is my first experiment
15:36 - in using a newer network to combine
15:40 - human portraits with different things
15:42 - that are ubiquitous in our lives.
15:44 - What you see at the top is include
15:47 - human portrait mixed
with cat emojis, donuts,
15:51 - power outlet, and ripped jeans.
15:54 - The video is showing
how we can do animations
15:59 - for cat and human portrait mixtures.
16:02 - - I'm Jiwon.
16:04 - I'm Anna.
16:05 - This is a small 'zine that we made
16:07 - about the introduction to
surveillance technologies.
16:10 - It's basically for the general audience,
16:13 - so anyone can understand it.
16:14 - It's basically going through
16:16 - something as simple as a Google search.
16:18 - So, what happens in the internet ecosystem
16:21 - when you type something in Google,
16:22 - and how, basically, the internet works.
16:26 - Also, the repercussions of it.
16:29 - How you can be tracked.
16:32 - What cookies are.
16:34 - And basically just being more aware
16:35 - about your privacy on the internet.
16:38 - - My name is Jacque Liu, and
I created a project called
16:41 - Eniac Girlz Program and Pretend.
16:44 - What it is is a speculative
play set for girls
16:47 - to get them interested in programming.
16:49 - The play set also references
the history of inequality
16:53 - surrounding women and computing.
16:55 - The toy is meant to evoke the
motions of being a programmer,
17:01 - and the first electronic
computer, the Eniac.
17:05 - - Basically, what this is, is um--
17:07 - So as you may or may not know,
17:08 - World Pride is happening
at the end of June,
17:10 - and it is for the 50th anniversary
of the Stonewall Riots.
17:14 - Basically, that was a huge--
17:17 - It was a little bar fight,
17:19 - or very famous thing that happened
17:21 - that basically launched
the Gay Civil Rights,
17:24 - the LGBT Civil Rights
Movement in New York.
17:26 - The arch in Washington
Square Park was built in 1892
17:32 - for the commemoration
of President Washington.
17:37 - Basically, it was there to
celebrate the founding fathers
17:40 - on the centennial anniversary
of his inauguration.
17:43 - On the half centennial anniversary
17:45 - of the LGBT Civil Rights start,
17:48 - what better way than to commemorate
17:50 - the founding mothers and
fathers of the movement.
17:54 - - Hi.
17:55 - My name is Veronica Alfaro
17:56 - - I'm Adrian Bautista.
17:58 - - I'm Jingyi Wen
18:00 - And we still have two other group members.
18:02 - - What you're gonna be doing,
18:03 - is you're gonna be joining the
CRISPR Detective Unit today.
18:06 - Your goal is to find members
of the Metastasis Mafia.
18:09 - These are the genes that cause
cancer cells to metastasize
18:12 - and spread throughout the body.
18:13 - Welcome to your first mission.
18:14 - This is the pre-CRISPR era,
18:16 - where genetic research was
a little bit cumbersome,
18:18 - not always accurate, not
always the most efficient.
18:20 - To illustrate that point, what
we're going to be doing here
18:23 - is using your sense of touch.
18:24 - You're going to be trying
to find the bad genes.
18:26 - The ones that cause metastasis.
18:28 - As you can see, it's a little cumbersome.
18:29 - It's a little frustrating.
18:30 - And that's what editing
DNA was like pre-CRISPR.
18:32 - It wasn't always the best.
18:34 - - Detectives, you will come back to now.
18:37 - And you have the help
of CRISPR technology.
18:39 - Your job will be much
easier, and much faster.
18:44 - (machine beeping and speaking)
18:48 - (happy jazzy music)
