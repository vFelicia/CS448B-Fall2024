05:34 - hello my mic was muted good afternoon
05:38 - good morning good evening good bill of
05:40 - the night I don't know when you're
05:41 - watching this
05:42 - welcome to the coding train with me I'm
05:46 - Dan Shipman now this is a very special
05:50 - livestream I haven't been around
05:52 - live-streaming very much actually I to
05:54 - be honest haven't felt like it very much
05:55 - things are busy things are chaotic and
05:58 - there's a lot going on in the world and
06:00 - especially here in New York City I live
06:01 - in Brooklyn New York and not too far
06:04 - from the Barclays Center and on my mind
06:08 - are the issues around police violence in
06:12 - the city on my mind are the protesters
06:14 - who are out raising their voice against
06:16 - racism and police violence and I wanted
06:19 - to I've been trying to focus some energy
06:22 - and time on supporting some of my
06:26 - students from NYU who have been out
06:28 - protesting and participating and local
06:30 - community organizations so our first
06:32 - thing I know people are making comments
06:34 - about my beard so first thing I want to
06:37 - say is black lives matter and I want to
06:39 - tell you about an organization that this
06:41 - particular live stream is supporting now
06:44 - let me see I'm I've got a lot of like
06:47 - new technical set up for today and thank
06:50 - you of Derek Morris who's made our first
06:52 - donation I want to switch to my computer
07:01 - screen which you're about to see and
07:03 - we've got another donation from
07:04 - anonymous thank you and let me switch
07:09 - right here laptop okay so now you're
07:12 - seeing my fancy computer screen without
07:14 - my camera in it and I'm gonna open up
07:17 - the web browser and I'm gonna talk about
07:19 - Aaron who's our guest today in a minute
07:22 - oh and you all know my dog Gloria I
07:26 - closed all the doors to the room that
07:28 - I'm in because I don't want to be
07:30 - bothered and unfortunately she wants to
07:33 - get out okay Gloria come on good girl
07:35 - there you go good girl
07:37 - look at a camera on her later for all of
07:38 - you who are interested okay I'm
07:40 - to switch over to power plant so
07:44 - power plant is an organization they're
07:48 - located in Bushwick Bushwick Brooklyn
07:51 - they connect teams and with established
07:54 - artists on free interest-driven digital
07:56 - art projects and educational programs
07:58 - they advocate that access to technology
08:01 - is a right and not a privilege
08:04 - now I actually was first introduced I
08:05 - realize this too power plant a year ago
08:10 - and let me see if I can get my camera
08:11 - going here I'm gonna Aaron there's a
08:14 - small chance you're gonna appear but I
08:16 - don't think so ah no you didn't I have
08:21 - you off but your audio is on I can if
08:23 - you talk they'll hear you that's Aaron
08:27 - Berger I was gonna do a really dramatic
08:28 - and huge introduction to bring Aaron on
08:31 - knife I've messed that all up but the
08:35 - processing foundation as as I probably
08:37 - talked about runs a fellowship program
08:39 - so let me briefly try to find the 2019
08:45 - fellows because here we go fellows 2019
08:49 - so a year ago just about from from today
08:53 - or around now I was the mentor for
08:56 - Matilda Matilda who you're seeing on the
08:59 - screen right now is a trans or ghen Iser
09:00 - programmer an artist with an interest in
09:02 - building tech infrastructure for
09:03 - organizing within and across boundaries
09:05 - problematizing are catastrophic notion
09:07 - of community and contributing the
09:08 - systems to uproot unjust socio-economic
09:11 - system so Matilda is fantastic and they
09:14 - taught were a workshop to trans and
09:18 - gender non-conforming youth and you know
09:21 - it's nice to bring this up also this is
09:23 - Pride Month here in June so there's a
09:24 - lot of wonderful causes and communities
09:26 - to support but so Matilda taught this
09:29 - workshop on digital literacy and privacy
09:31 - and coding at power plant so I was
09:35 - visited there when the workshop was
09:37 - running and it didn't didn't make that
09:39 - connection till just a week ago or
09:40 - actually just the other day but a week
09:42 - ago I learned about what power plant is
09:45 - doing in terms of supporting the black
09:47 - lives matter move
09:49 - and protesters in New York so there you
09:51 - can see here on their website they are
09:54 - there in Bushwick they are operating as
09:57 - a rest space and offering access to
09:59 - computers Wi-Fi and a printer they're
10:00 - also a donation drop-off center shall a
10:02 - group of students from anyways ITP
10:05 - program and and and friends and family
10:07 - of theirs organized a whole collection
10:09 - of donations to drop off their their
10:12 - teaching workshops on digital security
10:14 - protest safety surveillance I actually
10:16 - have some projects I'm working on
10:17 - related to security and surveillance in
10:21 - photos and images so maybe I'll come
10:22 - back later this we can do another
10:23 - livestream on that it's not what today
10:25 - um so you can you can donate to support
10:29 - power plant through their website I'm
10:32 - right in front of it right now but
10:34 - there's a donate button on the on their
10:36 - website itself but on YouTube and thank
10:38 - you David Schneider I'm not sure I'm
10:39 - catching all these donations but I'll
10:41 - try to shout them out when I do YouTube
10:43 - also you through one of the features I
10:47 - have for my channel is the YouTube
10:48 - Giving Program so any 501c3 nonprofit
10:51 - organization I can attach as a
10:54 - fundraiser to I've done this if you
10:55 - recall a couple times at least once for
10:57 - the processing foundation and there are
11:00 - many other fundraisers going on right
11:02 - now on YouTube and one of the things
11:04 - that I'm attempting to do and I think
11:05 - it's something that you can do as well
11:06 - if you're looking for ways that you can
11:07 - make a difference
11:08 - there are many large organizations that
11:11 - need your support but something that
11:13 - often gets missed are smaller local
11:15 - organizations that can really use just a
11:19 - volunteer time donations of food and
11:21 - supplies as well as money so powerplant
11:24 - is local - it's not my immediate
11:26 - neighborhood but local to Brooklyn where
11:28 - I live I do wanna mention that there are
11:30 - a bunch of other I did in trying to
11:32 - figure out to fundraise there were
11:33 - several other organizations that I've
11:35 - been talking to and also try to support
11:38 - in my own work I mean it's a little
11:39 - tricky to get them added to the YouTube
11:40 - system and I was so lucky enough to get
11:42 - powerplant write up but I do want to
11:44 - just mention a quick shout-out to a to
11:46 - others code cooperative and maybe I can
11:50 - do a fundraiser for them later code
11:52 - cooperative is a really amazing
11:54 - organization that is a community of
11:57 - people who learn use and build
11:59 - technology to create life-changing
12:00 - possibilities for individuals and
12:01 - communities impacted by
12:02 - car serration so you can volunteer and
12:05 - donate and they actually have a
12:06 - mentorship and a hiring program thank
12:08 - you science club for your donation so
12:12 - one thing I just wanted to mention here
12:13 - is if you're looking to hire go check
12:17 - out code cooperative I think it's here
12:18 - under the agency that they are basically
12:23 - they partner industry experts with
12:26 - formerly incarcerated technologists so
12:28 - something that we can do to help fight
12:33 - against you know mass incarceration is
12:35 - and and and help support people who have
12:37 - been incarcerated is through
12:39 - organizations like code cooperative
12:40 - particular former community so they're
12:41 - fantastic and I also was going to
12:44 - mention the Marci lab school which is a
12:50 - a school an organization that that runs
12:55 - programs for youth and that is really
13:00 - fantastic and does a lot of really
13:02 - excellent work that I would encourage
13:04 - you to check more about on their website
13:05 - under their programs that they run and
13:08 - you can see a bunch of their attendees
13:10 - of their fellows so this is really also
13:12 - I highly encourage you to check out
13:13 - Marci lab so maybe I could do more of
13:15 - these fundraisers for some of these
13:16 - other other organizations okay another
13:20 - donation from anonymous
13:22 - alright so that's my that's a bit of my
13:24 - opening spiel here for today I I
13:29 - certainly would subscribe to this
13:31 - statement access to technology as a
13:33 - right not a privilege I'm very lucky in
13:35 - so many ways in my life in terms of how
13:37 - I've had access to equipment and an
13:39 - audience and education and anything that
13:42 - I could do to help provide that for
13:43 - others I think YouTube is a platform
13:45 - that allows me to do that in one way it
13:48 - certainly leaves certain people out
13:51 - people are interested in watching me
13:53 - leaves people out perhaps and so
13:56 - something that I'm really trying to do
13:57 - through my work is also encourage other
14:00 - people to teach and stream and create
14:04 - with creative coding tools and
14:07 - technology so well someone that I really
14:10 - want to highlight for you today if I go
14:12 - back to the Fellowship's now I'm back on
14:14 - to the 2020 fellowships
14:16 - and I'm gonna bring her on her camera on
14:19 - right now let's see if this works
14:20 - very exciting you ready Aaron okay
14:24 - Aaron's cameras there now - hi and so
14:28 - I'm Aaron I'm gonna let Aaron really
14:30 - introduce herself but I met Aaron in
14:33 - person actually at the i/o festival err
14:37 - goal on Levin and introduced me to Aaron
14:40 - I guess were you where you go on student
14:42 - in a class or you just know him from you
14:43 - oh wow yeah I'm like I've known him
14:50 - since like a freshman year and like like
14:52 - I remember I having a huge story like
14:54 - when the first times I met him I was
14:56 - telling him um thinking of like
14:57 - transferring design and then he wanted
14:59 - huge rent saying how I shouldn't chanson
15:01 - to design and stay with art and that was
15:02 - my like first interactions oh and golems
15:06 - in the chat so first can I read about
15:08 - Aaron I just saw Golan wrote hey Aaron
15:11 - can everybody hear Aaron cuz I want to
15:13 - make sure my technology is set up
15:14 - correctly and audio quality is okay it's
15:17 - gonna take I'm it's gonna take a little
15:20 - bit but hopefully people are saying they
15:23 - love your room I'm ready to reverse my
15:26 - video because it looks like I'm looking
15:27 - away from you but when I look this
15:29 - direction I'm looking exactly at you I
15:31 - think it's gonna mirror my video how
15:34 - long is that a enable preview Oh while
15:38 - you're talking I'll try to switch my
15:40 - video people also they like your
15:41 - keyboard okay oh so so let me uh but I
15:45 - have to do my prepared remarks which
15:47 - aren't actually prepared cuz anybody's
15:48 - watch the coding train knows that I
15:49 - prepare absolutely nothing as you can
15:51 - tell by my very awkward attempts to use
15:54 - my voice to support black lives matter
15:55 - but I I do want to I do really want to
15:58 - do that to the extent that I can
16:00 - okay so Aaron is a fellow for processing
16:04 - Foundation and her proposal
16:06 - I remember reading it and being really
16:08 - excited by it because it was about how I
16:12 - should let you speak to this but I'm
16:14 - gonna give you my own characterization
16:16 - of it and you could correct me if I got
16:17 - it wrong but I know Aaron is someone who
16:19 - has been interested in code and
16:20 - technology and learned a lot on her own
16:22 - and was really didn't necessarily see
16:27 - when she was learning especially in high
16:28 - school role models are people for her to
16:31 - find online who were doing what she was
16:33 - doing and so she wanted to maybe be that
16:36 - person for somebody else through
16:38 - streaming as well she also talked a bit
16:40 - about how like rather than do streams a
16:42 - lot of my content are sort of like
16:44 - curricular tutorial to trick Euler
16:47 - curriculum tutorials yeah so it's like
16:50 - follow this playlist of videos where I
16:52 - or you know teacher person will talk at
16:54 - you and lecture and explain stuff and
16:56 - that has that has value hopefully people
16:59 - obviously I found it through the channel
17:01 - and learned to code I do do some more
17:03 - improvisational and sort of fun coding
17:05 - on my streams but I think what what what
17:08 - really resonated with me and Erin's
17:09 - proposal was this idea of what's like
17:11 - this sort of like fun hangout session
17:13 - where you can learn about coding see
17:15 - creative projects and that's really what
17:18 - you wanted to do in it kind of cosy way
17:20 - to read there with her stream so I got a
17:23 - shut up a glad you jump again and so
17:25 - well I'm gonna try to reverse fix up
17:27 - some of my tech stuff err maybe you
17:29 - could talk about your your journey and
17:34 - to learning to code what it's been like
17:35 - for you you know at CMU and what you're
17:37 - doing with your twitch channel okay okay
17:39 - yeah yeah I think like Oh something guys
17:41 - does anyone is saying about like um oh
17:44 - it feels so weird because I don't
17:46 - usually have this many audience but yeah
17:50 - I think it's one thing I want to mention
17:51 - was I in the proposal I physically said
17:55 - like oh I want this to be like um it's
17:58 - like coding train with your professors
18:00 - like lectures and stuff like that I want
18:03 - my code decoding to be like that cool TA
18:05 - and I was like friends with your older
18:07 - siblings you know and like they know
18:09 - what's up but also like they kind of are
18:12 - just relaxed and I could trouble with
18:13 - trying to get through college just like
18:15 - you so yeah um
18:19 - I guess I can say like like about me
18:21 - yeah so I'm Erin I really like hexagons
18:24 - that's my thing that's my steel besides
18:25 - like very cozy and comfortable things um
18:28 - I go to cranky though and right now and
18:30 - I'm like in the weird like senior row of
18:32 - my graduation I took this semester off
18:34 - like before I knew coronavirus would
18:36 - happen and I try to varios happen yeah
18:40 - that was like the best call I probably
18:42 - say my whole academic career it's fine
18:43 - I'm kidding this better calls but yeah
18:45 - um yeah so when doing this with Jameis
18:49 - mr. Dolph I was like I want to apply for
18:51 - the fasting fellowship because we like
18:53 - really cool to have like these more like
18:55 - interactive coding tutorial which into
18:57 - like up like the coding chain because
18:59 - it'll be like more fun if I can I talk
19:01 - to the chauchat and like also interact
19:03 - with my viewers and stuff like that and
19:05 - like it'd be like a bit more like
19:06 - personal so to speak like like I
19:08 - assumedly she's going it's like having
19:11 - with no plan for sure I just kind of
19:13 - take a like topic oh and like from the
19:16 - p5.js reference and I'm just like that's
19:18 - what we're gonna do today guys and just
19:20 - tend to go off with it and like everyone
19:22 - like I was like how to plan a bit like
19:25 - um maybe I'll they kind of go into mind
19:27 - that like here's how I should attack
19:28 - this like say like a problem and go
19:31 - ahead and like you know create this
19:32 - project but usually everything is just
19:34 - like up in the air like like like like
19:37 - hey sometimes you would see me just like
19:41 - completely like get stuck on this one
19:42 - problem you kind of see me get like
19:44 - super tiny but that's okay we're all
19:45 - getting like tired together the people
19:47 - I'm alpha editor has it's not alpha
19:49 - anymore so it's not like that the people
19:51 - I went by the editor has I crashed on me
19:53 - both of the times you see my despair in
19:55 - there oh well yeah it's a good time um
19:59 - yeah like I said mostly what I'm doing
20:02 - right now because you know it's a
20:04 - coronavirus o'clock like what else do
20:06 - you suppose to do
20:07 - I'd like to stay at home and like stream
20:09 - I listen to a lot of podcasts I guess I
20:12 - work on my hexagon library like once in
20:15 - a while I'm getting back into it at
20:16 - least and like now it's like I've like
20:19 - settled in the coronavirus groove I'm
20:21 - some time straight I'm gonna like like
20:23 - streaming like me working on it at least
20:24 - yeah Lily bass about it yeah awesome
20:28 - Thank You Erin for that awesome shirt so
20:30 - I want to address just a couple
20:32 - questions that came up in the chat and
20:33 - then we'll get started with the coding
20:34 - stuff so some people were oh and thank
20:37 - you go on for your donation
20:39 - where's my bell Colin's what you know
20:42 - it's funny like this this is very silly
20:44 - but like sometimes I can like I can
20:48 - create the illusion for myself that
20:49 - nobody is actually watching this or
20:51 - nobody act that I know is watching it's
20:53 - it's like oh there's a person that I
20:55 - know it's goal I'm like oh my god all of
20:58 - my flaws are there here for the world to
21:00 - see but anyway so I want to mention so a
21:04 - couple had asked about audio and video
21:06 - quality for Aaron so I what the way that
21:10 - I've got this working right now and
21:11 - apologies if it's not perfect is I'm on
21:13 - a discord to call with her video call
21:16 - with her and the audio and the video are
21:18 - coming in from that so so I think it's
21:23 - it's good enough but I would love any
21:25 - feedback or maybe if I do more of this
21:26 - kind of guest stuff I'll come back and
21:28 - improve it for the next time around but
21:29 - what I'm going to tell you is that in
21:32 - about an hour or sooner or later
21:34 - somewhere around there we are actually
21:35 - going to switch over we're gonna move
21:37 - this whole everybody watching we're all
21:40 - gonna move over to twitch.tv slash cozy
21:42 - coding and watching it resting and I
21:45 - knew audio and video quality will
21:47 - improve from from Aaron's because it'll
21:50 - be direct streaming from her location so
21:55 - it's this is the thing I actually a
21:58 - couple people I know that Kobe and and
22:01 - David who have that you've been using
22:02 - their experimental chat tool and yeah
22:05 - Steve for your donation I forgot to
22:07 - mention that I was planning to match
22:08 - these donations up to $500 so I don't
22:12 - know where we are right now with the
22:13 - total but if we can get up to 500 ollars
22:15 - for the total that I will be matching
22:17 - that donation myself just to encourage
22:20 - you it doesn't look like I needed to
22:21 - encourage people too much because people
22:22 - are donating and I really appreciate
22:23 - that and also like I realize a lot of
22:25 - you watching you you don't have the
22:26 - means to donate or maybe actually for
22:28 - some of you you might not actually even
22:29 - be able to in terms of what YouTube the
22:31 - Google commerce system allows in your
22:34 - local area but you can find other ways
22:37 - to support and certainly if you want to
22:39 - join the coding train discord and if
22:41 - there are ways we can talk about how the
22:42 - coding train community can support black
22:45 - lives matter that's a place to have that
22:47 - discussion okay now there were some
22:51 - other questions I got one so one person
22:56 - asked how do you apply for the
22:57 - processing fellowship so the processing
23:01 - fellowship and maybe let me say a couple
23:02 - things of them maybe Aaron can
23:04 - talk about her experience doing that but
23:06 - I what I will just say very briefly is
23:08 - if you go to processing org sorry
23:11 - processing foundation org slash
23:12 - fellowships which is what I have up on
23:13 - the screen right now we usually do the
23:16 - open call for the fellowships around
23:18 - November so stay tuned come back and
23:21 - look on this fall as well as subscribe
23:23 - to probably processing org on Twitter
23:26 - Aaron what was it like oh and Kate holla
23:28 - but look at these people that I sort of
23:29 - that I know I mean I know cake that's
23:31 - like thank you for your donation this is
23:34 - amazing
23:36 - Aaron what was it like for you to apply
23:38 - to do how do you define that process huh
23:40 - okay so I found it on like Twitter at
23:44 - least because like I knew I was going to
23:47 - take the semester off so I save up a bit
23:49 - and I was like oh shoot like what am I
23:51 - gonna do at least and then I saw I think
23:54 - it was Lauren that like posted on like
23:56 - Twitter saying like oh yeah we're having
23:59 - like open call for like associates no
24:01 - like all right oh why like why not you
24:03 - know I've got nothing going on and like
24:05 - I said it's like a couple of like
24:07 - recently like thinking of what to do and
24:09 - then like I think like two days before
24:11 - the due date it just all came to mind I
24:13 - was like that's it okay like stretch
24:18 - together like an application and I was
24:20 - like yeah it's like it's like twitch
24:22 - it's a coding train on Twitch but it's
24:25 - more casual and then like it was great
24:28 - and then like it seemed like the board
24:29 - like really loved it and then like yeah
24:31 - I did like some interviews and stuff
24:33 - like that I physically acts like dad as
24:35 - I mentor subways and just toting train
24:37 - and like it's like quite in a similar
24:39 - vein you know so like I thought though
24:41 - be a SAN mentor and you can do like a
24:43 - lot of things besides just like you know
24:45 - things like this doesn't have to be like
24:47 - all out there like I know that someone
24:49 - like someone else is doing I think like
24:51 - p5 p5.js tutorial than like Africa and
24:55 - everyone is doing like p5 and processing
24:58 - for like elder ease like elderly people
25:00 - in Korea and look like a couple more you
25:03 - know I think last year someone was
25:05 - working on the like getting their
25:06 - release of the p5 editor so it doesn't
25:09 - have to be like outreach like this it
25:11 - could also be something like internal
25:13 - where you kind of want to like improve
25:14 - processing and p5 itself you know
25:17 - ya know and Olivia just gave a donation
25:20 - hi olivia.olivia is watching Olivia I
25:24 - also met introduced by Golan at IO
25:27 - Festival yeah what's the thing I wanted
25:32 - to mention about the processing
25:33 - fellowships is so we run a bunch of
25:35 - different programs actually what's going
25:36 - on what's going on right now a program
25:38 - we run but we participate in its google
25:40 - Summer of Code and which is a way that
25:43 - if you're a university student
25:45 - undergraduate or graduate student you
25:46 - can apply to work on an open-source
25:48 - project over the summer and get paid and
25:50 - get paired with a mentor but some of
25:53 - these programs and this isn't
25:54 - necessarily a criticism of them but it's
25:55 - important to mention that really are
25:57 - specifically for people writing code and
26:00 - doing development work on open-source
26:03 - projects and from my point of view and I
26:05 - think I can say from the processing
26:06 - foundation point of view it's really
26:08 - important to support and fund projects
26:11 - that have to do with community education
26:14 - inclusion and so sometimes these it's
26:17 - easy to forget the importance of just
26:19 - things we do to to come together as a
26:23 - community to educate each other and so
26:26 - the fellowship program is really a way
26:27 - that you can apply for to get funding
26:30 - and mentorship for a project that's not
26:32 - just about like writing a code library
26:35 - although you can also write a code
26:37 - library and also I don't I hate that I'm
26:39 - even describing it this way because
26:41 - those are not separate things right the
26:43 - act of creating an open-source library
26:46 - is the act of building a community and
26:49 - and and it's just it's it's it's more
26:52 - important I would say and it's something
26:53 - that I think that I all you know I'm not
26:55 - saying I succeed at this but I always
26:57 - try to keep in mind with the kinds of
26:59 - things that I work on is how has access
27:03 - to this who's left out of this and how
27:05 - can we do better to to bring more people
27:08 - in to feel welcome and included and they
27:10 - can participate so I've been told by
27:14 - breaking news I have my by ridiculous
27:16 - breaking I'm trying not to use my sound
27:17 - effects today but and I it doesn't even
27:20 - work right now oh wait where's my
27:21 - breaking news here hold on
27:24 - [Music]
27:25 - breaking news we have hit our dollar
27:29 - [Music]
27:30 - okay thank you everybody keep donating
27:34 - one of the reasons why I wanted to do
27:36 - the matching donation is I don't know
27:38 - how actually takes for the sort of like
27:40 - systems that donation the YouTube system
27:43 - to be able to get them collect the money
27:47 - do all the stuff and get it to power
27:49 - plant so I'll be I'll make that donation
27:50 - today so they'll have some funds for the
27:53 - work that they're doing right now to act
27:55 - as a sanctuary space for protesters okay
27:58 - so next oh so what you can't see Aaron
28:01 - that I also brought up one of the thing
28:03 - that I love and I haven't caught every
28:05 - single minute of Aaron streams but I've
28:07 - watched I would say at least half of
28:08 - them and the the just the sheer like
28:12 - sort of colorful creative designs that
28:16 - come out of each of her playful
28:17 - experiments are really fun and beautiful
28:19 - and unique and so I have up on the
28:21 - screen right now just the sort of
28:24 - thumbnails from your last three streams
28:26 - so people can kind of see and so I think
28:28 - this is and I mean to put it on code
28:34 - pens but I haven't gotten around to yet
28:37 - either I'm gonna like like set an alarm
28:43 - for myself and like you bet like that's
28:46 - like I think I'll do it like in between
28:47 - like when we go to your stream and to my
28:50 - stream like like in that like time I'll
28:53 - just like slap one code pen real fast
28:54 - you know and I'm like release it yeah
28:57 - yeah epic oh I'll do awesome so I think
29:00 - I'm gonna try I'm table where I talk too
29:04 - much
29:04 - and I do this in a lot of aspects of my
29:07 - life as my children are like we have
29:09 - something to say to you know so I'm
29:13 - gonna try what I'd like to do now is I'm
29:16 - gonna switch over to the glitch page and
29:21 - I'm gonna let you take it from here and
29:25 - I'm gonna I should just mute myself I
29:28 - won't mute myself but I'm gonna I'm
29:30 - gonna try to move into the sidelines and
29:31 - let you start your cosy coding and I can
29:35 - answer any questions and participate in
29:36 - hopefully not messed things up
29:39 - okay No No please please feel free to
29:42 - like go ahead and like you know do
29:45 - whatever because this missamma collab at
29:47 - least you know I view this as a collab
29:49 - so I kind of just like both doing this
29:51 - together in this project together it's
29:53 - how I view it so if you want to go ahead
29:56 - and yeah so like gosh I didn't know what
29:59 - I want to do like if you guys can't see
30:01 - my screen cuz like right now I'm just
30:03 - going over to me like p5 reference that
30:05 - for this that's that
30:07 - um let's see what see and I'm kind of
30:10 - like a looking at lips I usually sight
30:12 - like a freight stream I just go ahead
30:14 - and look and say like ah what thing do I
30:16 - wanted to work on today and like I saw
30:19 - that like there and like typing like
30:21 - text-align at least like this I start
30:23 - typing like text things and I just like
30:25 - you know I haven't necessarily touched
30:27 - upon texts really yet so I might do
30:31 - something like that um but like I always
30:34 - found that text is like a little bit
30:35 - limiting whoo let's see let's see let's
30:40 - see let's see what the reference has
30:42 - protects all right place mostly have
30:43 - like text align text leading um what is
30:46 - oh you got kid no yeah but you can I can
30:52 - always pull something up so if there's
30:54 - something I think it's actually in a way
30:55 - it's sort of use well yeah I can pull
30:57 - something yeah yeah um no no I'm just
31:02 - like going super idea with this but I
31:03 - feel like going ahead and like using
31:06 - text of it cause like I don't
31:07 - necessarily like I just haven't
31:09 - agreement a lot uh-oh uh-oh
31:17 - I lost Erin's audio hold on Erin do you
31:19 - hear me
31:20 - shoot it was all going so well how many
31:25 - technical problems okay you you you code
31:29 - but why did I lose your audio did
31:32 - something happen on your end perhaps
31:34 - let's check sorry everybody a little
31:40 - technical difficulty here let me go to
31:44 - our video call
32:09 - you're muted Aaron I see you as muted
32:22 - I did not definitely there's a Defen
32:25 - setting oh yeah I think I see that I
32:40 - know but I don't we've put on some music
32:50 - here just like ease the awkwardness a
32:54 - little bit anybody in touch with her
33:36 - messaging her on discord
33:42 - I have too many things open okay let me
33:46 - just go to this for a second
33:53 - [Music]
33:58 - talk amongst yourself everybody okay
34:03 - are you hearing me right on that if you
34:06 - hear me please type okay wait this is
34:19 - great now we've got something we're
34:21 - doing here
34:21 - [Music]
34:36 - [Music]
35:01 - ah I've got you it's always my fault the
35:23 - technical problems I always I'm glad I'm
35:30 - glad no we're back and I usually don't
35:40 - press it
35:41 - but because the keyboard is different
35:44 - and it's easy to press with one no we're
35:50 - good we're good
35:50 - I've lost the chatting program okay ten
35:58 - oh it's the music too loud oh dear
36:00 - oh no no no it's good I turned the music
36:03 - off
36:03 - I should play some nice relaxing music
36:06 - this will be better I just think it's
36:12 - like I was typing whatever is going on
36:14 - and like thing is like when it deferens
36:16 - and discord deferens it would like play
36:18 - like a loud noise you know they tell you
36:20 - that you got deafened but it didn't play
36:22 - this time I screwed up my audio alright
36:29 - alright this was fun oh so we didn't
36:33 - hear a lot of what you were Sarah just
36:36 - but it's okay just don't worry about
36:38 - repeating yourself and then it was just
36:42 - like I see I a glance over her phone but
36:45 - she's muted and I was like oh oh no and
36:47 - then it's like it's funny I mean doesn't
36:49 - realize I'm just like oh no well all's
36:54 - well that ends well okay you can come
36:57 - here we're bad Koby in the chat and the
37:03 - disk or chat rightz this is the perfect
37:06 - representation for both of their streams
37:08 - to be honest and i would have to say oh
37:11 - that's about right
37:13 - actually the time like is that time
37:16 - where i like drink drink water like a
37:18 - chokes for like the solitude live like i
37:20 - couldn't do anything about it you know
37:22 - playing it t5i veterinary eats my toes
37:26 - this is this stream this is what you
37:28 - expected you heard aviaries thanks
37:34 - all right moving on great so I'm just
37:40 - gonna wrap it up I'm like one second
37:43 - yeah so I was saying my Texas I don't
37:47 - usually use text like I don't know right
37:49 - like what to do I don't know video that
37:51 - p5 text at least pod okay and that's it
37:56 - I'm just remembering back to thinking I
37:57 - couldn't hear you so I thought you just
37:59 - like didn't say anything I thought you
38:00 - must be dry it off like that no I'm here
38:08 - I'm here
38:09 - okay all right so um cool so like I
38:14 - don't like I was asking you if I'm Tina
38:17 - Google Fonts works in oe5 editor at
38:21 - least um so I know you can we I know you
38:26 - can set a font yeah and I know that
38:29 - Google Fonts has fonts and the question
38:35 - in my mind I believe it does we might
38:38 - have to do something goofy and CSS but I
38:41 - I've never tried this so it's certainly
38:43 - something we could try yeah yeah cuz I
38:46 - know if you go to be reference and if
38:49 - you check um like the text font and you
38:52 - look like um I think the second example
38:54 - it says function preload and you can
38:56 - like load spots there's like a load
38:58 - function yeah yeah so I'm doing right
39:01 - now
39:02 - mmm well certainly it it would work to
39:08 - download the font if it's the correct
39:12 - format OTF for example whatever that is
39:15 - I should know but I don't open type I
39:18 - guess open type format maybe and then we
39:22 - could upload it to glitch and then be
39:24 - able to load it that way okay okay I'm
39:27 - like the tricky thing about this is this
39:30 - is one thing that does require other
39:32 - browser pages besides the
39:37 - the glitch sketch itself so it's a
39:40 - little hard for me to show like you
39:42 - looking around for a font that you like
39:43 - but you can look and then when you find
39:45 - it you could tell me yeah yeah yeah I'm
39:47 - like I'm just like going towards the API
39:50 - I'm like you can like import a style you
39:53 - know to like HTML um like I wanna I see
39:59 - some of the chat so like you can pass
40:00 - like the URL when I'm trying to see if I
40:04 - couldn't like maybe maybe it's gonna
40:06 - work
40:07 - brookies I'm just gonna drop it in there
40:09 - and see what happens who knows it all
40:14 - right I'm just gonna get like a regular
40:16 - one and and Sam and just gonna copy this
40:23 - and therefore to use fonts you have to
40:26 - have a preload which is like our our
40:28 - setup setup okay look I'm not typing
40:34 - that code isn't that cool I'm showing my
40:36 - hands and probably just like a string I
40:46 - put that in there see what happens oh
40:48 - shoot it like autofill strings sugar
40:51 - that purrs me off all the time and it's
40:54 - like oh no what do I not know that's
40:55 - right it looks right to me yeah yeah but
40:58 - like it looks like it's sucking like
41:00 - loading purgatory like oh well oh I see
41:05 - what you mean so yeah like like it's
41:08 - uploading but like it can't get it you
41:11 - know what I mean like that's happened to
41:13 - me before
41:14 - look working like p5 let me sing my
41:17 - things
41:18 - no just say boating for like ever and I
41:21 - will never finish so we got an
41:23 - unsupported OpenType signature at parse
41:27 - buffer we got like a weird error that
41:30 - I'm showing on the screen right now in
41:31 - the console yeah well I would say maybe
41:41 - it makes more sense to download and
41:42 - upload the font I do have another sort
41:44 - of like idea though which is that one
41:47 - way that sort of you know I think
41:49 - sometimes the way
41:50 - type there's like that question that you
41:52 - were asking this of like well why do I
41:54 - want to work with type what I'd like to
41:55 - do is make geometric patterns and work
41:58 - on animations and color so one thing
42:01 - that you can do with type is just
42:04 - consider it like a shape like the same
42:07 - way you would draw squares but so you
42:11 - could create an entire design that's all
42:13 - just squares and then at the last moment
42:17 - basically change every square to like a
42:19 - letter form so we kind of like put the
42:22 - font stuff off for later and just sort
42:23 - of like bring that hang later that makes
42:27 - sense
42:27 - okay and I was actually going to tell
42:29 - you when you said you're going to
42:30 - download it and then re-upload it that's
42:32 - like the cool thing about glitch cuz he
42:34 - sees like where little expenses assets
42:35 - yeah you can like just drop like your
42:38 - files in there and then when you dropped
42:41 - your files in there you can like load it
42:43 - from like the assets folder like you
42:45 - essentially just say say like Flash
42:46 - assets and then flash like I have a file
42:48 - name in so you don't have so it's all
42:50 - like contained online you know what I
42:53 - mean people people are joining I see
43:00 - like chat messages from people on glitch
43:02 - like can I join but I think for right
43:05 - now I'm going to leave this glitch
43:07 - sketch just for Aaron and me to have
43:09 - typing privileges in but certainly what
43:13 - we'll do when this finishes is publish
43:15 - it and let people make their own
43:16 - versions of it yeah yeah okay yeah and I
43:21 - don't know if you heard me I think my
43:23 - key vines am I gonna turn it off right
43:24 - now I think I accidentally triggered it
43:26 - um what I was saying was is that um what
43:30 - you can do is like you can see all those
43:32 - like the assets oh yes yes yes yeah yeah
43:35 - you can go ahead and you can just like
43:38 - um you can go ahead and like upload the
43:41 - font there and this word whenever you
43:44 - want you can say flash assets and then
43:47 - flash the font name and therefore it
43:48 - should load from there so therefore
43:50 - you're like our whole project including
43:51 - like that's downloaded like assets are
43:54 - like well downloaded assets are like
43:56 - online so I'm also discovering something
44:01 - else
44:02 - Oh God
44:04 - which is that you this URL that you
44:07 - pasted in is like the URL for the CSS
44:10 - that would allow you to incorporate the
44:12 - font so it's not actually the font
44:14 - itself but in there I found what I
44:17 - believe is the URL to the actual font
44:19 - file I'll be this and that didn't work
44:24 - either
44:25 - okay but no unsupported type okay um
44:32 - that's like fine because I didn't
44:34 - download the font package local I
44:36 - compute it perfect oh if I could find
44:39 - the file Sam and then I'm just going to
44:43 - go ahead I'm adding I'm adding a little
44:46 - bit of extra code that I believe we need
44:49 - I just put an asset in there so we're
44:52 - going to go out and delete this mess of
44:55 - a string got it and then we're gonna say
45:00 - I think it's flash assets and then flash
45:03 - I don't know what the assets actually
45:04 - called ah Roboto mono - regular dot t TF
45:10 - yeah so I'm gonna go ahead and go into
45:14 - my sketch and paste it and hopefully did
45:19 - gosh it should what let's see
45:26 - unsupported OpenType signature not hold
45:29 - on let's rerun the only reason I took PT
45:32 - yes yeah yeah yeah um peopIe pasty TS
45:37 - hmm that's right do I have like an
45:41 - action no I think it's finding the file
45:46 - because it's not a 404 error like if I
45:49 - misspell it when I misspell that and
45:54 - then refresh it no oh no that's for now
46:01 - there was a 404 oh it's it's 404 it is
46:05 - hold on let's okay
46:09 - reg you right let's see they put it back
46:16 - refresh yeah it's giving a 404 error
46:23 - gosh darn it um someone's at son OTS it
46:28 - can be a TTS so that's just fine because
46:32 - I'm looking at the records right now and
46:34 - says well as an OpenType follow-up spot
46:36 - bio OTS how much ETF come on follow URL
46:40 - um I returned to p5 on object alright ah
46:48 - why don't you maybe with you want to
46:50 - move on and start making some other
46:54 - stuff I can look into this font thing
46:56 - and see if I can get it to fix okay um
46:58 - that's fine
47:00 - this is the beauty of like you know
47:02 - what's the cause a creative coding at
47:04 - least fully clothed code because someone
47:06 - can be buggy
47:08 - well another person can do that whatever
47:11 - it okay so um we're going to say you're
47:15 - gonna put the text stuff into the mortal
47:17 - coil and then I'm also going to like
47:19 - comment that out the lease I have like
47:22 - some I have something why oh all right
47:29 - it's like the preload I think the whole
47:30 - preload function is probably clogging it
47:32 - up so I will just comment out my whole
47:35 - preload function and let's see what
47:37 - happens all right I hear in the plate
47:41 - making sure I actually think Stefan
47:43 - myself even though I turned off all
47:47 - right um honestly let's start with
47:50 - shapes that's like the most basic part
47:52 - of like p5 it's shaped like what else
47:54 - are you gonna do besides draw shapes
47:55 - text I don't know so if we go to so it's
48:01 - like actually oh I haven't like done
48:02 - anything with arcs yet and that I'm kind
48:06 - of like I can't wait to do I don't know
48:09 - why I just haven't done anything so
48:12 - we're gonna say like we're gonna put in
48:14 - the middle what's / - height / - and
48:18 - what else - never arcs with of the arch
48:22 - by just default okay
48:24 - so just like yeah we can just give that
48:27 - a number that's like a bear radius
48:29 - we're gonna say like 100 and 100 and
48:32 - what else we need we need a start and a
48:35 - stop so we're gonna say 0 & 1
48:40 - II see cool um well well that that ain't
48:53 - 90 degrees uh you need to change it's
48:56 - doing it radians by default okay you can
49:00 - use an angle mode to change that it's
49:06 - funny because I who's it gonna sound
49:09 - like but back when I had to like walk
49:12 - whatever through the snow to school or
49:13 - whatever is like the idea of angle mode
49:15 - degrees was a thing that didn't exist in
49:17 - in processing so I my brain has been
49:19 - tuned to think in radians but most
49:22 - people are more comfortable with
49:24 - thinking in degrees oh darn young and
49:32 - yes I always forget I didn't have an
49:34 - angle mode degrees when I was growing up
49:40 - okay um let's see oh I know that the
49:46 - mode is like interesting because we can
49:48 - have they have the the extra two
49:51 - parameters or mode in detail and it's
49:53 - like determine the way of the Archaea
49:55 - that corridor pie or it's open and I
49:57 - like just like core it is just like you
49:59 - know the court itself
50:00 - pie is like it shaped like a pie now
50:04 - corn is like it can visualize draw the
50:06 - line from like the start to like the end
50:08 - at least so it's not white it like
50:09 - completes the border if I recall and
50:12 - like actually you know and sometimes
50:14 - just like vaguely describing it I might
50:16 - as well just show it the HRD I spelled
50:20 - that wrong yeah it goes like that which
50:24 - kind of I kind of liking that a little
50:27 - bit um that watching me like Highness on
50:29 - the play around with because like what
50:30 - if he had just like a little like for
50:34 - loop for
50:40 - I addressed them like 360 and like I and
50:47 - then I'm just going to go ahead and deal
50:49 - it I'm just gonna throw that out here
50:55 - what I have I'm like doing recently I've
50:58 - been reading a book called a clean code
51:02 - and it's just saying to you like how
51:04 - you're like code should be like you know
51:06 - clean and all neat and stuff like that
51:07 - and then I go to like here there is this
51:11 - lovely format this file button what
51:14 - which was mom yeah yeah and I'm like I
51:19 - go to like here at least oh silly that's
51:24 - right I forgot it's in like the draw
51:26 - loop I'm thinking I got the font to work
51:28 - you got the pot to work well I I don't
51:31 - so this is somebody in the chat I
51:33 - believe the name is Dov Jonny H maybe
51:35 - yes I I can't remember who suggested Oh
51:38 - Jonny H had a suggestion but anyway if
51:40 - you if I click in assets and then click
51:43 - on the uploaded thing I get a URL of
51:46 - like where that file is and I want the
51:50 - full I don't know if this is how you're
51:51 - supposed to do it but it didn't give me
51:53 - an error so okay so that that's easy oh
51:57 - I love what you just did Oh what's the
51:59 - chord yeah yeah yeah yeah oh that's so
52:02 - cool I go to like 360 we're just gonna
52:07 - like I did go to zero flap up and you're
52:15 - missing a double equals there or a
52:17 - triple equals totally correct my screen
52:20 - is tiny I need to like dude I'm gonna
52:24 - like do a bit like force a string there
52:27 - we go that can be much easier for me now
52:29 - I also want to like see the chat too and
52:31 - stuff so yeah there so we can have that
52:34 - um oh you know I've been like meaning
52:37 - okay I wasn't excited mean to play
52:39 - around with a bit of like easing
52:40 - functions but I recommend using
52:43 - functions are like a bit like annoying
52:45 - to start annoying to implement yeah I
52:52 - have one
52:53 - which file of my life if you want there
52:58 - is one that you can do that makes it
53:00 - really really simple and quick if you
53:01 - haven't tried it before which is just
53:02 - using like the lerp function is a really
53:05 - quick way to do if you wanted to do a
53:07 - quick easing from 0 to 360 oh yeah that
53:13 - makes sense actually have you ever used
53:15 - lerp before uh yeah I've used lip but I
53:18 - use lip color and then I didn't think of
53:20 - using lip as an easing function but that
53:22 - makes that yeah maybe I'm I also might
53:25 - not be using the term easing correctly
53:28 - what I think of how I'm doing it with
53:30 - lerp yeah
53:31 - using the time easing correctly looking
53:35 - at now I'm just like no I'm not sure
53:39 - yeah I don't think you can use left with
53:43 - an easing function you just get like a
53:46 - value like in between the start and end
53:49 - point yes but so can I can I show you
53:52 - what I mean real quick I'm gonna comment
53:56 - this out and if I say I equals lerp pi
54:01 - comma 360 if I just put one in there
54:04 - it's gonna be 360 immediately cuz it
54:07 - goes all the way there like a hundred
54:09 - percent of 360 if I put zero oh wait I
54:12 - think you doing oh and then so this
54:16 - should be like this yeah yeah yeah oh
54:20 - that that kind of makes sense
54:21 - oh I didn't realize that make sense
54:26 - cause it constantly changing you right
54:30 - cuz you're going you're going you're
54:31 - going half way you know half way then
54:34 - half way of that then half way of that
54:35 - so it's like you're starting fast it's
54:37 - not like a son like traditionally easing
54:39 - would be like a sine wave probably but
54:41 - it it has a quality to it it's close
54:44 - enough you know what I mean yeah I'm
54:51 - also gonna throw in like no fill oh I
54:54 - need to tell you I don't think I told
54:57 - you of like way for like deciding what
55:00 - color palette like Hawaii the victims
55:02 - website called cooler Co olor SCO
55:07 - random pallet generator oh it's so cool
55:12 - I don't cool I just pulled it up yeah
55:15 - and then you can learn it and then you
55:17 - can like hit space to just generate a
55:19 - random pallet and I just like go off you
55:22 - know I know yeah like sometimes I like
55:27 - played games myself or is like okay um I
55:30 - have to like use the first pallet that
55:32 - comes up unless it's like yellow cuz I
55:34 - hate yellow so like I don't put you I
55:38 - don't even do anything with yellow in it
55:40 - a lorry in the chat is asking can you
55:44 - explain the lerp function okay okay um I
55:48 - can I can do that so like um what can
55:52 - you poke the whip reference young cool
55:55 - just what I like
55:56 - Elise showed would scream cool so like
55:59 - what lip does it basically takes in like
56:01 - three arguments and it takes them as
56:03 - like a beginning point a being a number
56:06 - and end number and then a number between
56:08 - 1 and between 0 and 1 and essentially
56:12 - that like number between late 0 and 1 is
56:16 - like the distance between the start
56:18 - point the set number and the end number
56:20 - so like therefore if you do like a TCM
56:23 - example has a 28 and 80 and then you
56:25 - work a b and then like 5 it gives like
56:29 - it gives a number that's directly
56:31 - halfway between 20 and 80 but if it's
56:33 - point 2 it gives number that's 1/5 of
56:35 - the way between 20 and 80 and so on and
56:38 - so forth um and it's like really cool
56:40 - because like also there's a function
56:42 - work color which you can do the same
56:43 - thing but for color so you can have like
56:47 - really really really easy gradients you
56:49 - know I think like what we can do dan is
56:52 - like um just do a click like lip color
56:55 - like on the background to show what it
56:57 - what it's like I hold on I gotta go back
56:59 - to glitch I'm just saying like
57:04 - background and then we're just gonna
57:07 - have in the back here like a start and a
57:10 - stop cool and like um well here's like
57:14 - one of the palettes that I generated
57:16 - I'll put it to you on discord and oh if
57:19 - I could find my discord window
57:21 - yeah I'll thank you and just good real
57:22 - fast that's like the one that I'm gonna
57:24 - be using okay sure
57:25 - cuz like I just got it now my god whose
57:27 - call actually if you just paste that
57:30 - link in a comment in the code that's an
57:32 - easier way for me to grab it oh shoot
57:34 - you're right that's right cuz I forgot
57:35 - okay so I'm just gonna paste it here
57:41 - cool yeah and the URL is basically just
57:43 - like like six hex with five hex codes
57:45 - that would be generated and I'm gonna
57:48 - probably choose like the first one and
57:50 - be like uh-oh
57:54 - the probably like the first one I'm like
57:56 - the last one or like the second one well
57:59 - get there when we get there that's okay
58:00 - um and then we can say like background
58:06 - and I think they have to be in strings
58:10 - with a hashtag in front of it if I ever
58:13 - call correctly and we'll grab this one
58:17 - because that one and we gotta do it
58:20 - again alright so we're going to do lip
58:24 - background start and stop so we can say
58:26 - like what um I usually use it do it by
58:31 - lines so like essentially if you can say
58:34 - what lip color should equal lip color
58:40 - and I want to go to the preference real
58:42 - fast again she remembered what exactly
58:48 - the arguments have to be Oh sugar
58:52 - am i muted again no no you're good
58:54 - you're good oh okay I can tell you you
58:57 - you I can't I I think the arguments are
59:01 - the same it's like color one color two
59:03 - and the percentage oh it's the same
59:06 - thing color one color to finish cool
59:09 - alright cool so you can say lip see um
59:14 - we're going to put this in the for loop
59:16 - myself Michael for my eyes equal to min
59:24 - 0 is less than with I need commas and
59:30 - semicolons I I always mix it up like I
59:33 - shouldn't be Ivan
59:35 - Johnson for like so long I applause pool
59:39 - and then we can have that back um you
59:50 - can quickly just do a map let's say like
59:54 - let this bunny lips see so we're gonna
59:57 - take this we're gonna hold live remount
60:02 - instead because that's going to be the
60:04 - third argument so you can say let live
60:07 - from Mount is going to be map and we're
60:09 - going to map from i from 0 to the width
60:14 - sugar and then it's gonna be lips won't
60:20 - learn about speeds between 0 and 1 cool
60:23 - so we're gonna get yeah I'm gonna get a
60:27 - number between 0 and 1 and then we're
60:30 - going to say what color is going to be
60:36 - equal to let color start stop and then
60:45 - lip amount right and then that's what
60:51 - we're going to go ahead and we're going
60:52 - to Remy drawing lines CR okay you stroke
60:58 - it's gonna be equal to the color
61:01 - oh I see what you're doing yeah and then
61:05 - I was wondering why are you using a loop
61:07 - cuz like I thought you're gonna animate
61:08 - the background like like the circle is
61:11 - animating but instead you're gonna
61:14 - you're gonna draw like a gradient
61:15 - pattern across by having by going from
61:17 - one color to another yeah that's super
61:20 - cool yeah yes we're gonna say um line 0
61:24 - and they're going to be oopsie it's
61:26 - gonna be I to 0 and then I to height
61:34 - yeah
61:35 - and cool and then after that oh it's not
61:40 - showing up
61:52 - where is there should be a it's not like
61:56 - judge live an error somewhere and I I
62:01 - don't know where the console is I don't
62:03 - know it cannot reap repartee map of
62:10 - undefined oh I think it might be having
62:22 - issues with like this out here we're
62:27 - gonna say like angle a and goe this is
62:34 - gonna be angle and then this is gonna be
62:36 - angle and then I assume that's like B
62:41 - over here this would also have to be
62:47 - angle yeah yeah yeah great I don't think
62:53 - that should have like caused an error at
62:54 - least because I using well what what
62:58 - what if we just just a testing for a
63:01 - second what if we just do this okay so
63:06 - that works all right so what it probably
63:10 - is is like oh oh it's probably things
63:14 - it's like how lights up you're like my
63:16 - color thing like sometimes I get some
63:21 - like areas where I really fit where like
63:27 - um I say it's like what something and
63:29 - then it's like oh cuz it's like a
63:31 - peacock oh I see now I see no we have to
63:34 - say at the very beginning start is equal
63:39 - to colored like this oh those aren't
63:44 - colors of course of course of course of
63:46 - course yes this might like be mad yes
63:52 - very very like that yeah yeah yeah yeah
63:56 - and you need to probably change the
63:58 - white strip
63:59 - what happened to the ark Oh higher but
64:03 - like it's like uh so like we can also do
64:07 - this I might be ruining it visually but
64:09 - we all see it yeah looks like you use
64:14 - this color yeah yeah actually I actually
64:17 - really like the white oh I'm gonna put
64:22 - in the white but I think the white looks
64:24 - super cool there um actually yeah I kind
64:33 - of like that I like it a lot
64:34 - I can't hear you then oh sorry I'm not
64:37 - talking oh good my mouth was open cuz
64:41 - I'm like oh it's so pretty
64:45 - okay also somebody in the chat and said
64:49 - like Oh change the gradient colors to
64:51 - variables and animate them and I was
64:53 - thinking oh yeah how would that would be
64:56 - pretty cool okay that's actually not
64:58 - that's like not that bad because what we
65:00 - can do is we can just say you can say
65:05 - let's that color and then let top color
65:10 - right and we're just going to equal to
65:19 - the start color right yeah yeah
65:21 - then stop color is whoa
65:26 - we could lurk the start and the end has
65:31 - to be different colors than the burping
65:34 - in between is the collective I'm gonna
65:37 - Kathy from car objects right now so you
65:39 - won't have to like probably so you won't
65:41 - be able to do that up there because
65:44 - outside ya won't recognize the paper
65:47 - I've got you okay okay then in that case
65:51 - actually and then I kept it define it
65:59 - outside so I'm gonna take away the less
66:01 - right now let's write color salt color
66:07 - right and then we just have to pour
66:13 - I think can do this right yeah this
66:15 - should break and um I don't think we
66:19 - need these now Oh doesn't like it okay I
66:26 - guess you can't use color inside the
66:29 - setup no you can but now now you don't
66:32 - want to say well yeah yeah yeah like
66:39 - that
66:40 - Coco Coco we didn't we did it that's
66:44 - that's a very good idea um so you can
66:47 - like live between like the colors now
66:49 - right um um and we can like do this by
66:52 - like oh oh I'm trying to like think I'm
66:56 - going towards they like a color function
66:59 - in the reference right now because I
67:05 - think you can like add like right what
67:11 - if we kept separate RGB variables or HSB
67:16 - variables instead of instead of just the
67:20 - singular like hex code then those could
67:23 - change based on you know just
67:26 - incrementation or Perlin noise or a sine
67:28 - wave or any of those kind of things but
67:30 - maybe you wanted to focus more on dr no
67:35 - see that's that's the whole plains are
67:37 - shaped like hey we got attention totally
67:39 - fine right you know I like this um but
67:42 - like I thought was like the p5 color um
67:45 - well the color object you're right yeah
67:48 - so I forget because in processing it's
67:50 - actually not a color object the clear
67:53 - function just makes a raw integer that
67:56 - is the you know representation of that
67:59 - 24-bits color the eight eight and eight
68:01 - this is a 24 yes yeah it's a color
68:06 - object right now I assume it's gonna
68:09 - like triple triple triple check yeah
68:11 - no no you're absolutely right now in
68:12 - fact I'm just gonna add a little
68:13 - console.log and I'll pull it up you
68:15 - won't so yeah look at it that way so um
68:20 - we can like set the color you can set
68:23 - the red and the green the bloom the
68:24 - Alpha yeah
68:26 - um I don't know we can like it doesn't
68:28 - seem like we can get it you know what I
68:30 - mean like you know I started some
68:32 - getters which honestly is an oversight
68:37 - like oh we should like look like um any
68:39 - other people of color we should be able
68:41 - to get the like colors just get like the
68:44 - RGB a name it's new out it's not really
68:49 - designed to be manipulated by the act
68:53 - decoder which is interesting because of
68:55 - course what you want to do is manipulate
68:56 - color yeah and uh you know the way I've
69:00 - always done this is make my own color
69:02 - object because that's how in processing
69:04 - you kind of had to do it oh it is I can
69:07 - see it's unfortunate that we that are
69:09 - like we had this this idea of the shared
69:12 - code window and glitches brilliant and
69:14 - perfect but unfortunately like we can't
69:16 - exactly see what each other are doing
69:18 - but I I looks like there's like a levels
69:22 - array and then zero is red one is blue
69:25 - so there that the data is kind of there
69:27 - but I think it would be true might be
69:29 - actually better for us to just do like
69:34 - what like if we call it like a cosy
69:39 - color and then okay I mean this might be
69:51 - a terrible idea and then we could make
69:56 - our own color objects and then you would
69:57 - just oh but then you wouldn't have a
69:59 - lower color anymore we can have a to
70:02 - color function especially oh okay we
70:07 - just have them like Regan said you just
70:09 - turn the code like to color would like
70:11 - you know spit out like a p5 color object
70:14 - and it will be able to change the cosy
70:16 - color to p5 color yeah you know and
70:20 - that's how it can like manipulate it so
70:22 - that's great that's great that's great
70:26 - and we would have to make this I said I
70:31 - wasn't gonna type but I can't I I need
70:33 - to like I need like a buzzer like every
70:35 - time I start coding too much I have to
70:37 - play my like buzzer
70:39 - you're doing you're doing you're doing
70:40 - great
70:43 - yes we have that cheek color and then
70:45 - see the whole thing about clubs like
70:48 - Club coding it's just paralyzation right
70:51 - and then watch this watch this
70:53 - we could do this crazy thing if our is
70:56 - is nothing as a string instance of hold
71:00 - on
71:02 - like somebody will know this but test is
71:07 - of instance of strings that false no
71:14 - type of string no somebody will know
71:24 - type of R equals string somebody in the
71:27 - chat bar yeah that make neck wools
71:32 - string then this dot then let C equal
71:42 - color of our and then this dot R equals
71:49 - red of C this G equals green of C this
71:54 - dot I don't know if I'm doing this in
71:56 - the totally craziest way that's the
72:01 - right syntax
72:03 - I like double actually you know that
72:05 - seems like the right syntax
72:06 - yeah and then now oh you did oh you did
72:15 - it here I think you just need the
72:17 - parenthesis hate them too there we go
72:20 - all right hey yeah okay so now you could
72:30 - write whatever functions you want to
72:32 - like change the RGB values oh that's
72:34 - great that's great um cool I'm gonna
72:37 - like take it through the T real fast
72:39 - mhm like just to be sure about this
72:48 - yeah where do you yeah
72:52 - you can you should be able to oh yeah oh
72:57 - oh that's great that's great it's great
72:59 - to know have a we can have a quick
73:04 - function oh I need to like change my
73:08 - position real fast can I keep it in
73:10 - Ritchie I'm gonna move this to another
73:12 - javascript file is that okay
73:14 - the cosy color class yeah yeah go ahead
73:16 - go ahead go ahead
73:17 - that makes sense I I unfortunately like
73:19 - uh like took off like the little side
73:22 - part like the little bar on the sides my
73:24 - like don't know how to bring it back to
73:27 - make a new file there it is
73:29 - class but I will know that it exists
73:33 - how are you fresh the page you'll come
73:36 - back up but either way we're going to
73:38 - say a little huh oh sure sure I
73:45 - like I to let out and like then changed
73:49 - my clipboard we're fine now though ah
73:50 - okay cozy I think cozy color j/s alright
74:03 - we're back and now if we want to add
74:05 - color functionality it's in that other
74:07 - file okay I'm just trying I'm just
74:11 - trying to find out how do I go back to
74:13 - the sidebar thar little control I yeah
74:20 - that's it that's it that's it cool cool
74:21 - cool
74:22 - I just took out the sidebar so I had no
74:24 - idea like were you guys really doing
74:26 - that alright cool so we have that there
74:28 - and then you have like a function
74:29 - gradient color so we can say like uh
74:32 - mind is blanking for a second and so
74:36 - color is out there so we can say um
74:43 - start color that our plus plus this is
74:47 - like pretty simple
75:00 - it's art Culinaire somebody in the chat
75:04 - gave a suggestion to have the to have
75:08 - the the the ark once it finishes to like
75:11 - go back to 0 and I was just adding that
75:13 - really quick idea did you get that yeah
75:21 - so I'm just making an angle target
75:23 - variable okay
75:38 - oh it's gradient Oh whoopsie I need to
75:43 - change up my computer my keyboard
75:47 - unplugs there yeah that's one thing that
75:51 - happens the time not gradient I'm
75:54 - gradient color okay oh oh and then and
76:04 - then I have to get it to go back up yeah
76:06 - yeah yeah again you just set some flags
76:11 - with that so
76:21 - all right - - I'm gonna have to change
76:25 - this down here and say
76:28 - [Music]
76:45 - oh that's like a lot of flags I'll be
76:47 - thinking of by just oh no I was thinking
76:49 - of like how are you doing your bouncing
76:52 - thing yeah you have your friend Nick
76:54 - know you have your boolean stuff like
76:56 - that oh wait oh I want to - I don't
76:58 - think - it for like all the colors all
77:01 - the colors it'll be like six boolean's
77:03 - at least sounds like I think I only do
77:04 - it for our for rent
77:15 - what's that color ro we're gonna say ro
77:22 - to follow your convincing true yeah cool
77:26 - it's that color circle that R is less
77:39 - than C 55 and start color or grow I
77:47 - think I caught a cold
77:48 - um yeah yes it was less than 255 and
77:55 - it's mostly growing we're gonna say
77:57 - start color dot r + + right and it is
78:05 - elseis ah if that color R is less than
78:12 - 255 oh sorry
78:15 - if it's greater than 255 also going to
78:22 - change the gressman or equal to so we go
78:24 - up less than 255 and start color our
78:31 - grow that's when we want to go ahead and
78:36 - be like oh we got a set this negative
78:43 - now so sorry oh I see what you're doing
78:50 - all right
78:51 - well yeah that can be equal to false so
78:53 - that's what we're doing
78:54 - now another way if it's just like
78:57 - incrementation up and down would be to
78:59 - just have a variable like this sort of
79:01 - color speed so the same way you would do
79:03 - like a bouncing ball and then it just it
79:05 - gets to the edge you would say the like
79:07 - our speed our color speed times equal
79:10 - negative 1 and then it would bounce back
79:14 - and forth so much more sense
79:17 - oh yeah but I did it that crazy way it's
79:23 - not a crazy way but I did it the way
79:24 - that you're doing because that's how I
79:27 - did it here with this like angle thing
79:28 - but that was something beautiful I know
79:35 - right um we're gonna say what is it
79:38 - if start color dot R if it's uh what
79:43 - greater than 255 right and they'll say
79:47 - start color grow I quote speed yeah
79:53 - called speed speed is a wrong word but
79:57 - we're gonna find is x equals negative 1
80:01 - right and then um yes is it right if why
80:08 - is it invented no I think it bends will
80:14 - be here naturally and I the chat is
80:17 - suggesting a sine function which would
80:19 - also be an idea but let's keep going
80:20 - with this we can always try that after
80:23 - if it's going to be less than zero then
80:26 - that's we're going to say color one so
80:36 - we can just move this Oh perhaps or
80:42 - disappear and we're gonna say or Jerry
80:49 - yeah yeah yeah I'm silly that's okay and
80:53 - then you're gonna do start colors dot R
80:57 - plus equals that color speed right Oh
81:01 - yep it should be that oh there we go
81:07 - there we go there we go
81:08 - I don't change him back yet yes yes oh
81:15 - that's cool and then we can do it for
81:19 - like I'm thinking is like we can do it
81:25 - for like another card color value too so
81:27 - I'm also going to change us to start
81:29 - color like just be able to start color
81:31 - speed are just like specify that this is
81:33 - like the red yeah yeah yeah okay
81:38 - and interestingly like we could I could
81:40 - also imagine later this
81:41 - actually going into the color class like
81:44 - the color class this head like that's
81:46 - like a bounce color function or
81:47 - something exactly um all right I
81:51 - surprisingly really like this like oh
81:54 - we're good I know I'm with this right
81:55 - now um I'm gonna do though like a
81:58 - gradient for like the other color as
81:59 - well yeah yeah so we can say I think
82:06 - that's a soft color Kate remember yes
82:09 - stop color stop color are and really
82:16 - like
82:18 - same thing same difference
82:29 - we're gonna say x equals negative 1 and
82:32 - we also need go ahead and just smoke and
82:38 - so we got initialize it here's the equal
82:47 - 1 all right there we go um well it
82:53 - doesn't like something and we'll get to
82:56 - that later and to say stop hello stop
82:59 - color dot t I think this supposed to be
83:01 - oh yeah and also then plus equals see
83:12 - that probably dot R is what I mean what
83:15 - people stop I'll see you all right there
83:22 - we go so we should have that changing
83:25 - too oh I like that a lot
83:27 - uh-oh are they both don't I know they
83:32 - did they're kind of like a little bit in
83:34 - sync like what if you changed stop other
83:37 - to use like the green channel or the
83:39 - blue channel yeah you're right you're
83:40 - right you're right
83:41 - so we're gonna change this to well say
83:45 - well use blue I'm gonna say this is Z
83:48 - and then this is going to be God our
83:50 - looks like B and it is kind of tripping
83:53 - me up just a little bit just capital R
83:55 - it's like capital B and then this here
83:58 - and then this here so like that should
84:02 - be fine oh I kind of like that umm and
84:09 - then like I kind of want to also have
84:12 - [Music]
84:15 - too much um I also kind of have like a
84:19 - lot of like these arcs going about so do
84:22 - you want to like throw that in a
84:23 - function too sure
84:25 - okay okay so you can say function late
84:31 - all right
84:32 - oh you mean - like duplicate this like
84:34 - growing and shrinking art yeah yeah for
84:38 - me the way that I typically approach
84:40 - this is by making it a class and then
84:42 - making like an array of our like
84:44 - animated art objects yeah fine let's do
84:47 - that are you going to make a class make
84:54 - a file
84:55 - I'll make yeah I can make another file
84:58 - so I'll make a cozy arc file okay
85:02 - so cozy arc Jas and then I'm adding it
85:06 - to index dot HTML cozy arc Jas and then
85:11 - now I'm in cozy art Dutch I asked the
85:13 - file I'm right cool I'm there too so
85:25 - what I think makes sense is if I take
85:27 - your what you wrote to draw it all of
85:35 - this comes into here whoops in show and
85:42 - then now it needs like an x and y and
85:45 - all these need to be like this dot
85:46 - properties mm-hmm you need all the so
85:53 - like what I if I'm imagining this yeah
86:03 - so they can be at a certain location and
86:06 - then this could be like a size this
86:09 - could be like this dot angle and this
86:12 - dot angle target yeah okay
86:24 - I don't know if you're doing it I was I
86:27 - sure know what okay all right so do what
86:34 - you want me to go with what I'm thinking
86:35 - for a minute okay okay I'm gonna go with
86:38 - what I'm thinking for a minute so I'm
86:39 - gonna take all I'm gonna take the angle
86:41 - variable which is for the arc or no
86:44 - angle is angle for the arc yes yeah an
86:47 - angle target right and I'm gonna put
86:49 - those into cosy arc okay and then and
86:56 - also let angle okay so these are all
87:01 - going in cozy art but instead it's this
87:05 - dot angle this that angle target and
87:11 - this stuff growing and then I also make
87:13 - a like a variable called like amount
87:15 - which would be like for this so now if I
87:20 - just add this dot everywhere everybody
87:22 - knows that all I ever do is talk about
87:23 - this dot this should this should be in
87:38 - this angle here on 13 yeah and the loop
87:44 - and the angle target did I get
87:52 - everything I think he did yeah and then
87:56 - my idea here would be that if we made
88:01 - all Ray also just want to like we should
88:05 - put in like a dis box size to like what
88:08 - you want to have different sizes that
88:09 - leaves yeah I can go for it awesome so
88:13 - I'm gonna make an array and I'm gonna
88:15 - say X dot push new cosy arc and then for
88:28 - I'll loop through all of the arcs and
88:32 - just say arcs
88:36 - so I don't know if you're getting this
88:39 - era but it seemed like something called
88:41 - this project has received too many
88:43 - requests please try again later
88:45 - oh yeah oh because because we're so
88:47 - popular oh I meaning to buy a pro glitch
88:54 - account I wonder if I just need to do
88:57 - what app like to have I mean I assume
89:01 - that's what it is right everybody
89:04 - everybody turned off the project
89:06 - yeah upgrade my account
89:10 - oh that's fix it Oh local machine and
89:16 - use vs code live share delicious ice a
89:19 - timeout after like four thousand
89:21 - requests says somebody in the chat oh
89:24 - well I didn't know that glitch time that
89:26 - I'd refer to thousand requests see wait
89:28 - I'm a navigator for using like a
89:30 - web-based application yeah me too like
89:34 - warrior you know we are also at 4:30 so
89:38 - this was the sort of time we said we
89:40 - were gonna switch ok so we could use
89:43 - this as an opportunity to like I could
89:46 - let you sign off I could kind of wrap up
89:50 - things here and point people to go over
89:53 - to twitch to join I could try upgrade
89:55 - like lipstick out to a pro account and
89:58 - then see if we can like you know we'll
90:00 - have a little break and then I fix it
90:02 - should we try that if it's for drilling
90:05 - on the thought so I do want to give like
90:06 - about like like 15 to like 20 minutes to
90:09 - set up yeah yeah yeah it's for thorn
90:11 - exactly like ok so let me let me try to
90:16 - explain to the audience here what's in
90:18 - theory going to happen and you can first
90:20 - of all let me say a huge thank you to
90:22 - Aaron for joining I have you know I've
90:25 - tried a past to have guests on the
90:29 - coding train and I'm hoping to do more
90:32 - of this in the future so this was
90:33 - something of a bit of a test because in
90:35 - sort of figuring out the tech to do this
90:37 - properly and thank you for bearing
90:39 - bearing with me thank you for all the
90:41 - exciting and wonderful work you're doing
90:42 - on Twitch so what the plan here now for
90:45 - everybody watching is we're going to
90:47 - continue
90:48 - project remains to be seen whether I'll
90:50 - be able to successfully call into Aarons
90:52 - but at a minimum Aaron is going to
90:55 - continue this project on her twitch
90:58 - channel so I should put in somebody if
91:02 - somebody could type this in one of the
91:03 - mods could type this into the tap chat
91:05 - it's twitch dot TV actually I have it
91:07 - right here I'll pull it up
91:08 - it's twitch.tv slash cozy coding oops
91:12 - that's the wrong now they're not sorry I
91:15 - have its twitch.tv slash cozy coding
91:18 - it'll probably be first of all it'll
91:20 - probably be like another four hours
91:22 - while I ramble no I'm gonna stop myself
91:24 - from talking but it'll be at least 15
91:26 - minutes so Aaron is set up there thank
91:30 - you everyone who donated to power plant
91:33 - so Aaron maybe what I should do is I
91:35 - should let you go
91:36 - we're gonna stay query everybody give
91:37 - some rounds of applause and clapping for
91:39 - Aaron in the in the chat and people are
91:44 - posting the link and then I can kind of
91:46 - like vamp here for a little bit to help
91:49 - remind people to head over there and
91:50 - you'll be up and running in about 15
91:52 - minutes and I'll be there as well all
91:54 - right yes sir I'll leave the discord
91:56 - calls okay yeah all right awesome Thank
92:00 - You Aaron with more of this in the
92:01 - future and everybody should if you like
92:02 - this kind of style of improvisational
92:05 - cosy coding which you should I see no
92:07 - reason not to like it you should
92:09 - subscribe and all that stuff to Aaron's
92:11 - channel cuz she's pretty often yeah yeah
92:15 - almost like I would say like three times
92:17 - a week or so yeah yeah and I'm like once
92:19 - every three weeks so you really just
92:21 - just forget about this coding training
92:22 - and go do some cosy coding okay all
92:27 - right okay Thank You Aaron oh I'll see
92:29 - you in like just a short bit over on
92:31 - your channel yeah okay all right so
92:35 - there goes Aaron I'm gonna I'm gonna
92:38 - press that button I'm gonna mute that
92:41 - just in case it comes back okay so I'm
92:43 - here on my own oh it's just like old
92:46 - times on the coding train this the
92:49 - donation button that you see I thank you
92:51 - anonymous for the donation that you see
92:53 - to the left to the right whatever
92:55 - direction is will stay there I don't
92:58 - know about in perpetuity but even after
93:01 - this stream shuts down
93:03 - but again all you have to do and you can
93:05 - see it's actually even here already is
93:08 - go to twitch.tv slash cozy coding so let
93:11 - me see I'm just gonna go over to my
93:12 - camera so this is just me I'm going to
93:15 - attempt I'm gonna stay here for a little
93:19 - bit just in case people have questions I
93:21 - can answer but I'm gonna attempt to
93:22 - upgrade my twitch account but I prefer
93:26 - to do that without their showing you me
93:31 - entering in my like a credit card and
93:32 - all that nonsense
93:33 - so we're I don't even know where do I do
93:35 - this my account upgrade I'll become a
93:44 - glitch member no rate limits apps that
93:47 - stay awake so I'm definitely doing this
93:51 - and here we go but what's firm oh I have
94:02 - to I have to get my secret code for my
94:05 - credit oh and David is asking what are
94:07 - your plans for continuing the remakes of
94:09 - nature of code let me answer that let me
94:14 - address that question hold on I try to
94:22 - get my code like this is this is
94:24 - riveting live-streaming I'm sure for all
94:26 - of you to watch I have a password
94:30 - manager where I also keep a security
94:32 - codes and things for credit cards I'm
94:35 - sure that's exactly what you're
94:36 - interested in knowing about right now
94:40 - okay that's about to speak it I'm just
94:43 - gonna type it in hit confirm oh whoops
94:49 - hold on hold on hold on hold on I did
94:53 - something wrong I want to do it monthly
94:56 - okay give me a second here confirm
95:06 - okay sure
95:13 - putting in my zip code so about the
95:19 - nature of code so I you know I really
95:21 - have to I don't know if I should be
95:22 - apologizing or what I mean I feel like I
95:25 - want to apologize but I think that I
95:27 - have ambitions of I think being in
95:31 - quarantine and being off for the
95:33 - semester I sort of thought that I'd be
95:35 - able to do more than I actually can and
95:37 - some of that is just my own hang-ups and
95:39 - some of that is really just the
95:41 - realities of living at home with two
95:44 - small children who do not have school or
95:46 - Kayla and just sort of like the
95:49 - psychology of that and so I really have
95:52 - been different I having a difficult time
95:55 - focusing energy on making video content
95:58 - and streaming I'm also not as used to my
96:00 - technology and like just sort of a
96:02 - routine of it so and I'm totally frozen
96:05 - here it's and I'm not able to purchase
96:06 - this but hopefully that'll come through
96:07 - but I have a couple of thoughts one
96:10 - thing that I think that I could do is
96:12 - throw myself into the writing of nature
96:14 - of code I think this would be in many
96:16 - ways disappointing for some of you who
96:18 - are really interested in following the
96:20 - videos and livestreams but I have
96:23 - actually been considering taking just
96:24 - saying like I'm taking a month off from
96:26 - doing any video stuff and just working
96:29 - on the writing of the book the rewrites
96:31 - of the book and that would be something
96:33 - that I would share is some of you were
96:35 - supporting as members and you know so
96:38 - that's thing that I'm considering doing
96:40 - but I also would like to see if I also
96:45 - could potentially get this set up I do
96:47 - think that soon I'll have access safe
96:50 - access to the recording studio where I
96:53 - was making those video tutorials I can
96:55 - walk there it's about a 45-minute or
96:58 - hour walk from here I could also take
96:59 - public transportation if that's a thing
97:02 - that makes sense to do and that building
97:05 - will be open and I can probably so
97:08 - that's something I'm sort of like
97:09 - waiting for that if I have more of a
97:11 - routine where my kids are going back to
97:13 - school even if it's just part like
97:15 - halftime I'm their school is very near
97:19 - where the recording setup that I have
97:21 - for those tutorials so that but anyway
97:22 - I'm off too much talking about that that
97:24 - now so Marcos is asking is there ran
97:31 - saying so much content to catch up on
97:33 - yeah
97:37 - oh the bear oh the I'm sorry I was
97:40 - getting a discord message saying I'm by
97:42 - myself in the call and they're
97:43 - disconnecting me to save bandwidth so a
97:48 - Mason wants to know if I can make more
97:49 - processing tutorials there's so many
97:52 - things for me to do and I'm having a
97:54 - little bit of a difficult time focusing
97:57 - energy and keeping like basically like
98:01 - I'm like answering my email like that's
98:04 - mostly what I'm doing and working on
98:06 - figure out some plants or NYU ordinarily
98:09 - I wouldn't have any sort of like guilt
98:11 - or anxiety over this because I would
98:14 - just say you know what I think I'm gonna
98:15 - take the summer off from video stuff and
98:16 - be back at it in the fall maybe I'll do
98:18 - a couple coding in the Cabana videos
98:20 - which is something that I can do you
98:21 - know at home but I you know this I do
98:25 - have people who sign up to be members
98:27 - and it conceivably there supporting make
98:29 - the making of the content so I might
98:30 - like to shift that towards the writing
98:33 - of the book and maybe I'll discuss that
98:35 - the discord I know whatever I say people
98:37 - are like we support you whatever you
98:39 - want to do it's mine so I really
98:40 - appreciate that and everybody's saying
98:43 - that in the chat as well so I do
98:46 - appreciate that but the things that I
98:50 - would like to do this summer I would
98:52 - like I did those like late night shows I
98:54 - would like to get back and maybe try it
98:55 - another quick round of that cuz it was
98:57 - fun to work on the discord bot the Hugh
98:59 - I I have it working that I could control
99:01 - these hue lights that are behind me from
99:02 - node so I want to keep working on all
99:04 - that stuff the overlay stuff I know that
99:06 - Coby has been helping me with that so
99:08 - we'll see
99:09 - i as of now just in terms of like
99:11 - updates about the coding trans schedule
99:13 - for the summer I definitely plan to be
99:15 - gone for the whole month of August what
99:17 - gone means I don't know yet but I'm kind
99:20 - of using that month as a sort of family
99:22 - vacation it might be a staycation we'll
99:24 - sort of see and possibly the last week
99:26 - of July so right now I'm looking at the
99:28 - month the next couple weeks in June in
99:30 - some weeks in July of working on the
99:32 - book
99:32 - make encoding in the Cabana I've got
99:35 - lots of other things that I'm working on
99:37 - that are you know more for my day job at
99:38 - NYU I do have this project I was working
99:41 - on with Joey Lee actually let me bring
99:42 - that up right now
99:43 - I'll take a break in and and and try to
99:46 - figure out how to subscribe to glitch it
99:47 - just like completely crash my browser
99:49 - and I can't even I don't know why this
99:53 - is not working so I'm just gonna like
99:55 - force quit Chrome for a second Oh
100:01 - Roberto Oh Roberto I think this is the
100:04 - Roberto that I know it's asking the time
100:06 - I'm having trouble with rotating an
100:08 - image about ten degrees counterclockwise
100:09 - oh yes
100:10 - tech explorers so I recently met Roberto
100:14 - let's give a little plug to Roberto oops
100:19 - and I've got the hold on I've got the
100:20 - discord up so let me did not mean to
100:24 - open that up for a second that was a
100:27 - direct message with Jason who was making
100:30 - the cozy coding design so let me let me
100:36 - open this up here first let's let me
100:38 - mention tech explorers Brooklyn which is
100:41 - a local after-school a center it has a
100:45 - bunch of like camping things there I met
100:47 - Roberto Joseph is in the chat who is the
100:49 - founder director co-director apologies
100:52 - we get Iran of a text Boers broke
100:54 - Brooklyn so let me ask we have a new
100:57 - member
100:57 - hi Kevin see after all that like I'm
101:00 - gonna stop making content somebody
101:01 - joined what are you doing oh look at the
101:03 - planks the new member blinks so I got to
101:05 - get more stuff going with that with the
101:06 - hue lights okay ten degrees
101:08 - counterclockwise when the mouse is
101:10 - pressed and needed to go back to the
101:11 - original position okay so what I would
101:14 - say very briefly I got to get back to
101:18 - somebody keep an eye Ken can somebody in
101:21 - the discord chat violet Kobe Marcos
101:24 - Simon keep track of how Aaron is doing
101:27 - because I want to make sure I shut
101:29 - myself down and send everybody over to
101:31 - Aaron's stream as soon as she is ready
101:35 - but I the reason why I'm continuing to
101:38 - go is I don't want everybody to leave
101:39 - and have nowhere to go I want everybody
101:40 - to go to Aaron's stream so let's look at
101:42 - this little problem for a let's do a
101:43 - little debugging for
101:45 - Roberto so let's say I have an angle and
101:47 - I set it equal to zero and I use
101:51 - translate to get to the center of the
101:56 - window and I draw a rectangle at zero
101:59 - zero that's 100 comma 50 and let's just
102:08 - give it a color of blue and let's say
102:12 - wrecked mode Center and we're gonna say
102:15 - rotate by that angle so it should be
102:22 - that if I change this angle to 45 and
102:24 - say angle mode degrees it should be
102:31 - rotated 45 degrees okay now actually
102:33 - this is perfect we can do exactly what I
102:35 - just did with Aaron with lurk so I could
102:37 - also have a target angle which is zero
102:45 - and I could say on mousepressed if
102:52 - target if angle I'm just gonna say if
102:56 - it's like less than 46 set target angle
103:01 - oh no sorry if it is less than one set
103:04 - target angle equal to 4 - let me just
103:10 - start at zero and have the target angle
103:13 - be a zero set it equal to 45 else if
103:16 - angle is greater than like 44 that means
103:20 - it's 45 target angle this there I'm sure
103:23 - there's a more elegant way to do this
103:24 - equals zero so if I run this every time
103:27 - I click the mouse it should be changing
103:29 - target angle let's just see if that's
103:31 - the case console.log target angle right
103:40 - 45 45 mmm why is it not going to zero if
103:45 - it's less than 1 Oh cause it's the angle
103:49 - silly me
103:51 - I'm just changing the target angle
103:53 - there's a much more elegant way of doing
103:55 - this if it equals zero so it's a 45
103:59 - otherwise set it to zero and still I'm
104:02 - sure this could be improved so let's do
104:05 - this 45 0 45 zero and then i can use
104:08 - lurk
104:09 - so remember lerp if I say angle equals
104:12 - lurk angle to target angle by some
104:16 - amount like 0.5% now when I click the
104:20 - mouse it'll go to 45 back to 0 45 back
104:26 - to zero and if I want it to be like a
104:27 - really fast transition I could make it
104:29 - like 20% they'll give it a nice little
104:33 - like nudge there and of course if I
104:36 - wanted it to be instant Oh Erin is
104:39 - calling so let me answer this call I
104:45 - have to figure okay okay
104:50 - I'm think I'm simultaneously online
104:53 - talking to Erin while I'm still lifes
104:57 - Erin I'm still streaming and when you're
104:58 - ready I'll switch people over okay but
105:04 - I've lost track of what I'm doing
105:06 - because I can't figure out where I am
105:08 - there's so many scribe so many screens
105:10 - and things I can't get on yet but I can
105:13 - hear you as well okay so okay great so
105:16 - you'll let me know
105:17 - I'm just vamping and doing other like a
105:19 - goofy stuff while we're waiting for you
105:21 - to be set up that I'm going to send
105:22 - everybody over to twitch okay
105:27 - so but I've lost the Chad and everything
105:31 - I need another monitor I guess okay all
105:38 - right all right
105:40 - so that was Roberto's question oh now I
105:44 - hear Erin okay I hear you but I can hear
105:48 - you can you hear me
105:53 - sorry I know I'm debugging with Erin
105:57 - YouTube people
106:03 - no they can't nobody on my stream can
106:08 - see or hear you just me
106:10 - oh are you is she streaming Oh everybody
106:19 - Aaron is already streaming so everybody
106:22 - should now head over there so I'm gonna
106:25 - put up a sign
106:37 - I think Aaron is streaming so head to go
106:42 - to twitch.tv can someone confirm that
106:50 - for me oh this is so confusing I have so
106:58 - many things in my ear and so many
106:59 - screens I'm looking at I'm lost the live
107:03 - chat oh okay
107:04 - Aaron I can't confirm Aaron started
107:06 - streaming so you should go there
107:44 - you
