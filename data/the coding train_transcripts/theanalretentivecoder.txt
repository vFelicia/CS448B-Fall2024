00:00 - [SOUND EFFECTS AND APPLAUSE]
00:06 - The following program
is brought to you
00:07 - by a grant from the Chugg Group.
00:10 - [MUSIC PLAYING]
00:14 - Hello and welcome to The
Anal Retentive Coder.
00:17 - I'm Dean.
00:18 - And today, we're going to
make a particle system.
00:21 - To get started with
coding, you will
00:23 - need three things, a
terminal window application,
00:28 - a code editor application,
and a web browser application.
00:32 - I like to have aliases or
"shortcuts," as they're also
00:36 - called, arranged on
my desktop in advance
00:38 - for all of the
things I will use.
00:40 - Let's open these applications
in order one at a time.
00:44 - First, the terminal window.
00:46 - I'm going to use the top left
corner, line it up exactly.
00:50 - So now, I have my terminal
window in the right place.
00:52 - I can get ready to write
some code in my code editor.
00:55 - Somehow, I need to get
that browser window.
00:57 - Oh, this is awful, but I have
to move this over to the side.
01:00 - This is just absolutely
wrong, so now this
01:03 - needs to come back over here.
01:04 - I don't want to see any overlap.
01:06 - Oh, but I also don't want to
see that background peeking
01:09 - through.
01:10 - OK.
01:10 - Let's see if I can bring
this all the way over.
01:13 - Let's move this down.
01:15 - Let's bring this-- oh, no.
01:16 - Bring this here.
01:17 - This can be a tiny bit smaller.
01:19 - Ah, there we go.
01:20 - I finally have my windows
just the way I like them.
01:24 - Now it's time to open up a
file to write some code in.
01:28 - I'm going to name
the file "index.js."
01:32 - I already have a file there.
01:34 - I'm sure it doesn't have
anything important in it,
01:36 - so I'm going to hit Replace.
01:38 - I just want to keep one
code file at all times.
01:41 - Much too messy to have so
many old versions of things.
01:44 - Before I can go any
further, I really
01:46 - should diagram out, work
out what I'm going to do.
01:49 - I want to make sure these are
the proper whiteboard markers,
01:53 - and I will just
draw a small circle.
01:55 - Oh, that is not dark enough.
01:57 - OK.
01:57 - This one is no
good, so we're going
01:59 - to put this in the
bad marker pile.
02:03 - Oh.
02:03 - That's a really good one.
02:04 - This is a keeper, I think.
02:06 - Let's see if we
can get any better.
02:10 - No, that's not better.
02:12 - This will go in the
bad marker pile.
02:15 - Oh, wow.
02:16 - That's good.
02:16 - Now, looking at
these two circles,
02:18 - this one appears to have the
most highest contrast black,
02:23 - so--
02:23 - oh, I forgot which one that was.
02:25 - It must be the other
one that's in my hand.
02:27 - Let's see if I
can recreate that.
02:29 - Oh, yes.
02:29 - So this is definitely our
winner in terms of the markers.
02:33 - This one doesn't need
to go in the bad pile,
02:35 - though, because it
could be used later,
02:36 - so it will go back in the box.
02:38 - Now, my whiteboard is dirty
and I need to wash it.
02:42 - How to clean the whiteboard.
02:44 - So the first thing first
is to get a paper towel.
02:48 - Let's use two.
02:50 - Fold it once down the middle.
02:52 - Then fold it again, so I have
a perfect square paper towel.
02:57 - Now, a little bit of water
will help wash the whiteboard,
03:00 - so I have measured out
a perfect one shot.
03:04 - I use this later after I
finish my coding lesson
03:08 - to put something else in there.
03:10 - I have a very special cup.
03:12 - It's a rhinoceros cup.
03:13 - Isn't it just darling?
03:15 - So I have my one shot of water
that I pour from my measuring
03:18 - cup into my rhinoceros cup.
03:21 - And I can pour the water,
that one shot of water,
03:24 - onto the paper towel.
03:25 - When you're cleaning
a whiteboard,
03:27 - you want to always clean it
in perfect vertical motions.
03:30 - I do a practice one right
here, up and down, up and down.
03:34 - Then I move over up and down,
up and down, up and down,
03:37 - up and down.
03:37 - And then really get it
in there, really use
03:39 - all of your verve and
strength and oomph.
03:43 - If there's smudges across
the top, as there often are,
03:45 - I can also do a perfect
horizontal stroke
03:48 - back and forth.
03:49 - This section of the whiteboard
is dirtier than this section.
03:53 - Oh, and there's water dripping.
03:55 - Treat your whiteboard just like
you would treat your windows
03:58 - and use Windex.
04:00 - Just the good
old-fashioned Windex.
04:02 - No need for any environmentally
chemical-free cleaners.
04:07 - I'm going to need many more
squares of paper towels
04:10 - in order to clean
the whiteboard.
04:12 - So take your paper towel.
04:14 - Roll it out now.
04:15 - Make sure it's a power of two.
04:17 - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
04:22 - Now, I need it to
somehow be a square.
04:24 - So I want to fold
it over so that it's
04:26 - 4-by-4 and then now 2-by-2.
04:30 - And I can take this and start
going perfectly over as a grid.
04:34 - Down, left, up, left, down,
left, up, left, down, left, up,
04:43 - left, down, left.
