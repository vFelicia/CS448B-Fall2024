00:00 - [Music]
00:00 - hello good afternoon and welcome to the
00:06 - coding train a weekly internet thing
00:12 - with me your host Daniel Shipman in a
00:17 - room by myself with some lights and some
00:20 - computers and a door and a camera and a
00:24 - monitor to see that I'm actually on and
00:26 - that perhaps for once I'm starting this
00:29 - livestream without my microphone muted
00:31 - is that possible could it possibly be
00:33 - true I'm looking at the slack channel
00:36 - there is a live YouTube chat which I
00:38 - find a bit hard to follow though I will
00:40 - attempt to follow it there's also a
00:42 - slack channel which is for patrons of
00:44 - the coding train if you would like to
00:46 - join that it's a crowdfunding site
00:49 - called patreon patreon comm slash coding
00:52 - trains something like that so here's the
00:54 - thing actually I feel like I'm saying
00:57 - this all the time
00:58 - but if you notice there's some like bags
01:02 - under my eyes or if I see what sorts
01:05 - things like hair is a bit more unkempt
01:09 - I'm not sure who to blame here exactly
01:12 - but I'm kind of addicted I've got it
01:15 - running over here on this this like
01:17 - invisible laptop thing whew what's this
01:19 - weird like an invisible laptop thing
01:21 - here but there's and I'm rockin don't
01:23 - worry as much as I might have suggested
01:25 - at one point I was going to livestream
01:30 - me just playing this game about paper
01:33 - clips that would have to talk about I'm
01:35 - not going to do that I'm just at least
01:37 - gonna start I'm just gonna like open up
01:39 - a window everything's gonna be fine I'm
01:41 - not gonna get sucked into the vortex of
01:43 - the paper clips
01:44 - Frank Lance Franklin's the director of
01:47 - the NYU game MFA and BFA program here
01:52 - and University of Tisch School of the
01:53 - Arts created a game which I guess is
01:56 - called the clicker it's a clicker and
01:59 - let's see where it lets see paper clip
02:00 - what happens if I just Google paper
02:02 - clips now what do I find
02:05 - a game about making paper clips blah
02:07 - blah blah oh this is - my my really just
02:09 - jumping on the bandwagon Frank
02:13 - and so what I would like to go is to
02:17 - let's go find this game we find okay
02:23 - okay here we go okay so the green paper
02:26 - is visible ah I know the magic the magic
02:30 - I meant to bring like a whole bucket of
02:33 - paper clips here with me and I could
02:35 - just juggle them or put them in my hair
02:38 - just play with them but instead I'm
02:40 - gonna go here I'm gonna increase the
02:44 - size and I'm going to make my first
02:49 - paper clip I would like to tell them to
02:56 - tell me if this game ever ends
02:59 - Joe just like to know if there's an end
03:01 - because right now I am working on on
03:05 - this other computer over here if you
03:06 - just will bear with me for a second
03:08 - I've had this I've got a dedicated
03:10 - machine for making paper clips I'm at
03:15 - what is that except iliyan 1.8
03:18 - sextillion I'm at 1.8 sextillion oh okay
03:21 - oh but I need to have I should be able
03:25 - to get the self-correcting supply chain
03:27 - why can't why is it the self-correcting
03:29 - supply chain why hasn't it enabled
03:31 - itself yet by the way I know there's a
03:33 - way I could open up the JavaScript
03:34 - console and like to change all the HTML
03:37 - and I could just make as many paper
03:38 - clips as I want but no I I'm I believe
03:45 - in the purity of the paper clip machine
03:47 - and so I'm gonna make a second one so
03:53 - I'm gonna go away in a second I'm what
03:56 - I'm wondering is I've got a little
03:57 - competition here a little coding train
03:59 - Friday afternoon coding show with a
04:02 - person who didn't sleep nearly enough
04:04 - you know not entirely just because of
04:06 - the paper clips probably lost an hour if
04:08 - I'm being honest - the paper clips I did
04:11 - wake up early to make some paper clips
04:12 - and wake up early but that's the first
04:14 - thing I thought of when I woke up
04:19 - but so I'm a little tired today
04:22 - what was I talking about paper clips ah
04:25 - so what I what I was thinking is I have
04:26 - these t-shirts I'm wearing one today and
04:28 - there's a bunch of different designs I
04:29 - would like to have a little contest here
04:33 - whoever can guess the number closest to
04:36 - the amount of paper clips that are on
04:38 - this page by the end of this live
04:43 - session of the coding train I will send
04:47 - you a free coding train t-shirt if you
04:50 - were one if you want to pick out your
04:51 - style now cuz you're so sure gonna win
04:53 - this you can go to coding train dot
04:56 - store and V I think I'd have no idea
05:00 - MV comm yeah there we go
05:03 - coding training dot store envy calm good
05:05 - nice nice t-shirt style that you like
05:07 - there's a bunch no no no no no no not
05:11 - just typing your number in the chat and
05:13 - boy your numbers are way too low let me
05:15 - just tell you it's really low because I
05:19 - have my intention is to kind of least
05:21 - get up there at least till it's like
05:23 - automatically making some paper clips
05:26 - did you tuned in because you thought
05:28 - you'd be watching something about
05:29 - learning to code I'm sorry
05:31 - instead you tuned in to a lunatic on the
05:33 - internet every once in a while manages
05:35 - to focus enough to do a coding tutorial
05:38 - so I I think in order to enter this
05:42 - competition I think you're gonna have to
05:44 - have a Twitter account because I think
05:45 - that's one of the only ways I can
05:46 - regulate a time stamp so it's 312 p.m.
05:52 - Eastern Time if your tweet with hashtag
05:56 - paperclip train you must use the hashtag
05:59 - paperclip train with a net single number
06:02 - if your tweet has the number closest to
06:05 - whatever I end with and your tweet is
06:07 - before 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time that means
06:10 - 3:30 p.m. and 59 seconds if that's the
06:14 - time stamp is fine but 331 and any
06:18 - number of seconds is not okay
06:20 - I will send you I will I would send you
06:22 - a box of paperclips but then I have to
06:24 - go to the post office myself it's such a
06:26 - pain but this print-on-demand t-shirt
06:28 - send you a t-shirt it's just so okay so
06:33 - paperclip train now if you want to play
06:35 - along let's make some more paper clips
06:36 - alright do up to like 16 what do I need
06:44 - to do here so I need to get someone I
06:45 - got a what do I need to do I need to
06:49 - let's just keep making some paperclips I
06:50 - forget I it was so long ago that I
06:53 - started this game I'm gonna run out of
06:56 - money I'm gonna run out of money making
06:59 - paperclips
07:00 - I have a lot of unsold inventory oh this
07:03 - has got it get better okay Auto Clippers
07:06 - this is really gonna help alright
07:09 - finally at least now I'm oughta Kagome I
07:12 - will come back to this little later
07:13 - maybe I'll lower the price to sell them
07:16 - but maybe I'll just lower the price of
07:19 - 10 cents I could do that right now right
07:20 - and it's it's it's fine oh I could buy
07:25 - another Auto Clippers okay let's lower
07:27 - to five cents alright let's let it run
07:28 - let's let it go okay alright let's check
07:34 - Twitter paper clip train how we doing
07:41 - here alright look there's a whole bunch
07:44 - already look at this this is exciting
07:47 - alright paper clip train here we go now
07:53 - back to the coding train
07:57 - I did something exciting this morning
08:03 - which is that I recorded look I'm so
08:06 - giant I am a monster on the internet
08:10 - next to some diagrams let me zoom this
08:14 - out a little bit some new videos will be
08:22 - appearing on the internet that were
08:24 - recorded and not live streamed and this
08:26 - is your clue to what they could be about
08:28 - with a special guest appearance by
08:31 - somebody who drew these diagrams so just
08:33 - little little foreshadowing there those
08:35 - will come out next week in the next week
08:37 - or two nine new results okay this is
08:40 - good
08:40 - all right let's check on our paper bliss
08:42 - oh wait I I'm not even looking at the
08:46 - chat and just looking at Mike
08:47 - [Music]
08:54 - let's see here I can get some more Auto
08:57 - Clippers for sure really gonna get - I
09:01 - need to do some marketing definitely
09:02 - need to do some marketing okay alright
09:07 - so what's gonna happen today on the
09:09 - coding train I'm going to try to
09:10 - actually accomplish something um the
09:12 - things that I would like to do are
09:13 - number one look at some nice particle
09:15 - system things that people made number
09:19 - two I would like to do some more of my
09:22 - object-oriented programming in
09:24 - JavaScript thing video stuff for my
09:27 - intro to learn to program series that
09:29 - needs to get updated with some es6
09:31 - syntax and then also I am going to make
09:36 - the computer it's over here talk to me
09:42 - so I want to i-i've started this series
09:44 - about chat BOTS I'm looking at very
09:46 - simple pattern matching retrieval based
09:48 - chat BOTS I look at something called
09:50 - rive script and what I'm gonna do is I'm
09:54 - going to induce some variation of that
09:56 - number guessing game but instead of
09:58 - typing in my responses and reading my
10:01 - responses as text I'm going to speak
10:04 - iris I'm gonna speak my words and listen
10:08 - to the response from the computer so
10:09 - we're gonna kind like custom build our
10:11 - own you know insert name of commercial
10:14 - product that talks to you at home device
10:16 - here like to make our own and then
10:19 - eventually I would like to investigate
10:21 - making some projects that run on these
10:25 - insert name of commercial device that
10:27 - you can buy and put in your home here I
10:28 - guess I have to name them at some point
10:30 - I'm always worried if I say something
10:32 - like Alexa then all these things in this
10:36 - room will start to beep at me but there
10:37 - is nothing in this room but me and some
10:40 - other stuff but maybe I just triggered
10:41 - your Alexa at home okay viral is gonna
10:47 - go get some snacks it's a good idea I
10:49 - would take your time because I'm really
10:51 - I this paperclip thing I have so many
10:54 - emails I could've been either I need to
10:55 - reply to instead just in case you're
10:58 - wondering I won't i won't i won't look
11:01 - at my eye
11:02 - I got what I want to show you the
11:03 - paperclip thing that I've been working
11:05 - on since last night
11:06 - there has to be an end right there's got
11:08 - to be a reason why I'm doing this there
11:10 - has to be a goal to get to eventually
11:12 - right Frank Frank are you out there you
11:14 - listening somebody get Frank Luntz on
11:16 - the phone Frank tell me what do I do
11:23 - I just I can't that's East
11:35 - I need to work that I really this will I
11:38 - really this okay so here we are let's
11:40 - buy some we're out of Clippers are we
11:41 - are we close no we're nowhere near we
11:44 - have a we have a lot where we need to
11:46 - make some more paper clips
11:47 - let's get these Auto Clippers going up
11:49 - and let's let's raise the price since
11:53 - we're kind of selling them faster than
11:55 - we can make them we need a little more
11:57 - money maybe we'll come back a little
11:59 - while and get get some some marketing
12:05 - going okay no let's get rid of this
12:08 - let's get rid of this is it 3:30 yet you
12:11 - still have time to guess you still have
12:13 - time to guess I haven't seen there
12:16 - hasn't been a single paper the latest is
12:18 - Jorge who guessed 23,000 250 this will
12:22 - be interesting so distance by integer
12:27 - values so that's the winner will be the
12:29 - closest number you can go above you can
12:32 - go below it doesn't matter the if I take
12:34 - your guess the absolute value of your
12:36 - guess - the final number here and that
12:38 - number is the lowest you will with the
12:41 - coding train t-shirt and if there's a
12:44 - tie
12:45 - I will send - why not right
12:48 - there's ten people who all tie I don't
12:51 - know I'll send ten that's what's gonna
12:53 - happen all right so let's see what's
13:00 - happening now let's so speaking of
13:04 - hashtags with the word training in hit
13:06 - last week I did a what did I do last
13:13 - week I did a coding challenge making a
13:14 - particle system
13:15 - and there have been some really nice
13:19 - examples of particle systems that have
13:21 - been posted to Twitter with the hashtag
13:23 - particle train here's one by Alberto
13:27 - nice I like how these particles are
13:29 - coming from the outside and coming into
13:32 - the center there's like meditative
13:34 - breathing thing going on here I love
13:36 - that this is a really nice one right so
13:39 - this looks very similar to my example
13:41 - but there's some nice variations here
13:42 - number one is there's these there's
13:44 - particles that are colored black and
13:46 - particles that are come from white with
13:47 - some sort of transparency against a gray
13:48 - background it looks like and then
13:50 - there's these little extra yellow
13:51 - popping ones that maybe pop out with
13:52 - more speed and respond to gravity
13:55 - looks like falling down which gives it a
13:56 - really nice quality great work to siren
14:00 - on twitter here's one huh this looks
14:02 - quite a bit like little bursts of fire
14:05 - that's nice I love this oh look at this
14:07 - a drain so if I click here let's see if
14:12 - this runs goes to it which while this is
14:17 - loading I should just check on the paper
14:18 - clips right right it's always okay if
14:20 - something's loading let's check on the
14:22 - paper clips by some water Clippers what
14:25 - do we think lower the price a little bit
14:26 - lower the price a little bit okay okay
14:27 - back back here we can see nice used to
14:29 - the particle system with an actual train
14:31 - and I can move the trains moving ooh and
14:34 - I think I can press on here back here I
14:36 - can change to some stars some rainbows
14:39 - and back to some stars and there we go
14:43 - we don't need paper clips stars and
14:46 - rainbows and smoke from a train made in
14:49 - javascript in the browser this is all we
14:52 - need
14:54 - [Music]
15:06 - okay thank you for it so I'm gonna keep
15:09 - scrolling down we've got some nice
15:11 - raining effect whoo this sort of like
15:13 - cool vortex crazy thing this one is on
15:16 - open processing with some sound
15:18 - interaction that's lovely this is some
15:20 - weird something for some hamsters oh
15:24 - this is that same I think this is a nice
15:28 - one looks like that makes a nice
15:30 - circular like Fang there's so many this
15:32 - is so exciting and wonderful to see I
15:34 - hope I'm not missing anybody's butt so I
15:36 - encourage you to check out Parker crane
15:37 - hashtag on Twitter and submit your own
15:39 - you can also find user submissions and
15:45 - community versions of some of the coding
15:46 - challenges if you go to the rainbow code
15:48 - repository and I go down to coding
15:53 - challenges maybe challenges all the way
15:56 - to the bottom
15:57 - oh I mean the wrong on the wrong URL
16:04 - coding challenges all the way towards
16:06 - the bottom I'm looking for a simple
16:09 - particle system and here we can see some
16:13 - here's a link to the particle train hash
16:15 - tag and some wonderful demos by users
16:19 - let's click through these real quick I'm
16:20 - just gonna click on the demos demo demo
16:22 - demo demo demo Oh apparently one of them
16:29 - is playing some sound
16:39 - this one's responding to the sound the
16:41 - music's not actually synced right now
16:46 - pause on get new colors start song again
16:50 - cool here's one called
16:55 - embers ah looks kind of like embers
16:58 - coming out of fire that's really nice
17:00 - here is one called DV k qpe a pen buys
17:06 - oh here look at these nice little
17:08 - bubbles so one of the things I need to
17:10 - investigate today
17:12 - you see a little flickering going on
17:13 - here is deleting particles so that's
17:15 - something I'm definitely gonna
17:16 - investigate today chimney I guess these
17:20 - are the default names if you don't name
17:23 - but I'm like really I'm what is the
17:26 - meaning of MBG mzq there's a queue
17:30 - there's got to be a deeper meaning there
17:32 - does it have something to do with with
17:34 - paper clips possess something to do with
17:36 - paper clips let's check let's check oh
17:39 - how am i doing I have why I need some
17:41 - more wire I need some more wire okay I
17:43 - bought some more wire about a lot of
17:45 - wire how am i doing that's a month's old
17:47 - inventory I think I can lower the price
17:48 - here I need more Auto Clippers okay
17:50 - we'll come back will come back will come
17:52 - back okay where was I where is it okay
17:54 - back back to nice chimney here oh look
17:57 - at this
17:58 - move your mouse on either side of the
17:59 - screen so we can see some smoke from
18:01 - chimney one our smoke from chimney - I
18:03 - love that I love the interaction to be
18:05 - able to sort of trigger different
18:06 - chimneys and oh this is the one that is
18:10 - with that sound responsive so as I speak
18:16 - the particles go and if I put on some
18:19 - music
18:30 - oh right I love sound responsive talking
18:39 - me particles out of my sound and then
18:45 - here we go
18:48 - particles towards center from Dave
18:50 - briquette II this looks like maybe the
18:52 - particles are kind of orbiting and
18:54 - circling around the center with a nice
18:55 - rainbow pattern and coming in maybe
18:57 - there's some gravitational attraction
18:58 - there that is cool
19:00 - great work I could have sworn there I
19:03 - saw the name Alka on this list
19:06 - Oh embers was Alka I must be um so this
19:09 - one was Alka what did I say yesterday I
19:13 - said like loyal viewer but I think I've
19:15 - maybe misspoke it's a royal view or
19:17 - something like that
19:18 - great work with the embers I wonder if
19:20 - there's something going on with my
19:21 - computer where things are running a
19:22 - little bit snow okay excellent work
19:26 - everybody uh
19:27 - this computer went to sleep this one
19:29 - which is really forking one might say
19:32 - I'm gonna get Frank Lance on the phone
19:33 - yet I need like an emergency phone where
19:36 - I could just like I need to know the
19:38 - secrets behind the paper clips and the
19:40 - hypno drones and the swarms and the
19:43 - youngbae and all of the things please
19:46 - tell me the secrets do you hear that
19:52 - dinging okay uh yeah so Alka says
19:57 - there's tons of fancy filters going on
20:00 - there it runs beautifully smooth on my
20:02 - machine
20:03 - alright I successfully did just about
20:06 - nothing for the law at least the good
20:09 - stuff it's almost 20 to 30 minutes here
20:12 - so those of you who are slow to enter to
20:14 - join to abort to to to board to board
20:19 - the coding train now you're all here so
20:20 - maybe we're gonna do some actual coding
20:22 - now I like to use this Adam text editor
20:27 - which I will now open these are some of
20:32 - the examples from last week I'm going to
20:35 - open oh I forgot it oh I turn one of
20:39 - these days I will install I term and
20:42 - and and look at the wonder that is I
20:44 - term and do a video about it mmm okay
20:48 - I'll do that right after I do Chrome
20:51 - extension so right before right before
20:53 - I'll do I turn before Chrome extension
20:54 - Chrome extensions are coming this an
20:56 - ester though because they're on my list
20:57 - for the course that I'm teaching right
20:59 - now so all right so what wherever I want
21:03 - to go now I want to go to the desktop
21:04 - and maybe under opie and I want to run a
21:11 - little web server so I can take a look
21:14 - at whatever it is that I'm doing what's
21:19 - what's probably the last one the
21:20 - particles was the coding challenge I'd
21:22 - probably opt to it's kind of where I
21:24 - left off let's see is there an error
21:26 - here oh it's mouse dragged right okay
21:30 - excellent all right so this is perfect
21:33 - this is where I left off so what I want
21:36 - to look at it's a couple things here
21:40 - Simon also loyal royal viewer Simon
21:44 - helped me with a to-do list which now I
21:51 - don't have in front of my eyes anymore
21:54 - ah and actually I was looking at let's
21:59 - look at this together
22:00 - so to places where I want to look one is
22:04 - let's see which is this playlist one is
22:07 - foundations of programming in JavaScript
22:08 - and the other one is I want to look at
22:15 - the sorry I want to look at the
22:18 - processing intro tutorials here and
22:24 - because these are a good reference for
22:26 - me the objects and arrays please don't
22:30 - start playing videos here okay by the
22:36 - way has anybody noticed that these days
22:38 - if you're watching one of my videos
22:40 - sometimes I appear in an ad before in my
22:44 - videos
22:44 - it's a strange experiment that we're
22:46 - trying here in that one of the things
22:48 - that I'm helping to promote is a new
22:49 - undergraduate program that's starting
22:51 - next fall
22:52 - it's called interactive media arts it's
22:54 - in New York City
22:55 - this is the website ITP NYU edu slash
22:58 - ima there's gonna be an open house I
23:00 - think maybe even like this coming
23:01 - weekend oh that's right the dates are on
23:05 - this website if you're interested you're
23:07 - planning to schools University College
23:09 - and you're thinking about doing
23:11 - something in I guess what is this called
23:14 - again Interactive Media Arts this might
23:15 - be the place for you so sometimes you
23:18 - might see a little ad for me talking
23:20 - about the interactive media arts on my
23:21 - videos before my videos I was there my
23:25 - in this picture this is where I am in
23:27 - this picture
23:28 - oh no I'm gone but I was in that picture
23:30 - okay so so this is fine this is this is
23:37 - fine nothing here that I need more on
23:39 - objects yes so these two yeah so Simon's
23:43 - list is really quite good it's pretty
23:45 - comprehensive here because it's noticing
23:47 - it's the same as what I have but if I
23:48 - think about where I left off was here
23:53 - add adding and removing objects ah what
23:57 - sec oh but that's from a year ago
24:00 - so this hmm I I have an idea what I'm
24:04 - gonna do now is so in my in my new one
24:07 - that I made which was 7.3 which was
24:09 - arrays of objects I actually did the
24:11 - adding so what I want to do is I'm going
24:14 - to do a removing and removing objects
24:18 - I'm gonna do the clicking on objects in
24:19 - the same video because when you click on
24:21 - it I'll remove it maybe that'll work
24:24 - and in Simon's big so helpful Scott my
24:26 - full list here so if I'm following that
24:29 - list what I'm on next is more on
24:33 - deleting elements from arrays yeah let's
24:38 - do the deleting interesting let's do the
24:40 - clicking let's do the clicking then I'll
24:42 - do the deleting for the clicking I don't
24:44 - know I'm gonna do something expanding on
24:49 - this video I will improvise okay so
24:53 - let's go back to the browser I guess
24:56 - I'll leave that stuff open here we are
24:59 - this is the one where let me just adjust
25:01 - this a little bit o P too and actually
25:05 - what I'm gonna do
25:06 - is oh there goes the camera don't be
25:10 - alarmed this is just the point on the
25:13 - coding train where I know that a half an
25:15 - hour has passed I better get started
25:17 - doing some coding and it's where I'm
25:21 - going to just I'm going to now also I
25:26 - want to reveal and finders what I want
25:28 - to do is there a thing for that show and
25:30 - finder and then I want to make one
25:32 - called op3 and I want to look at that
25:40 - code and I want open that up here op3
25:46 - there we go okay so I am now ready I
25:50 - think for the next video that I want to
25:52 - do let me minimize this and I think
25:57 - we're good so what's going on here so
25:59 - one of the things that I do it's very
26:01 - confusing if you happen to decide you
26:02 - want to tune watch what it's live
26:04 - streams why I'm not really sure you
26:06 - would want to do that but people seem to
26:08 - a number of people if I could look it up
26:10 - now I have a lot of different playlists
26:13 - and a lot of different threads of
26:14 - different topics I know I have this kind
26:16 - of like machine learning playlist that's
26:18 - kind of on hold for the moment that I
26:20 - did a little video to explain why mostly
26:22 - what I try to do is I try to make
26:24 - content related to the courses that I'm
26:25 - teaching here at New York University so
26:28 - right now the two courses that I'm
26:29 - teaching are one is an introduction to
26:31 - programming course where people have
26:32 - never programmed before so I'm and I
26:35 - previously made a whole playlist for
26:37 - that course but I use a lot of old older
26:39 - es5 syntax I'm redoing some of these
26:42 - videos with es6 classes so that's that's
26:45 - what I'm about to start with so I'm kind
26:47 - of jumping into the middle of making a
26:48 - tutorial for a playlist you're watching
26:50 - along because hey you might learn
26:52 - something or maybe you might give me
26:54 - some feedback or you just have this on
26:56 - in the background while you're making
26:57 - paper clips just go make the paper clips
26:59 - paper oh we can check on them soon I
27:01 - think it's been long enough since I look
27:02 - that I can look right kind of look maybe
27:03 - maybe okay so that's what I'm doing the
27:07 - other topic the thread that I'm on is
27:09 - for my class called here at HP it's
27:11 - called programming from A to Z but in on
27:13 - YouTube I'm calling it programming with
27:15 - text because the programming from A to Z
27:16 - makes it sound like it's a beginner
27:18 - course and it's not at all
27:19 - and so the topic that I'm kind of
27:20 - working on right now is chatbots
27:22 - and so I'm gonna do stuff with speech to
27:24 - text and text to speech in the browser
27:26 - so that you could create a
27:28 - conversational interface so those are my
27:29 - two goals for today
27:30 - it's 3:30 if if all goes well I'll be
27:34 - here till 5:30 if all doesn't go well I
27:38 - will be gone sooner are here lingers
27:39 - yeah but that's kind of my plan so let
27:43 - me take a minute before I go into the
27:45 - first tutorial to take a look at the
27:47 - chat I'm gonna look at the slack chat
27:49 - and the YouTube chat to the extent that
27:51 - I can am I missing something important
27:53 - that I forget something that I usually
27:54 - do is there I do you have any questions
27:56 - you want to ask before I get started let
27:58 - me know oh wait I should say that the
28:06 - time for guessing has ended I should
28:12 - have probably let's go to paperclip
28:17 - train 13 minutes ago and can we guess
28:24 - twice yeah that's a good question well I
28:31 - don't know what to do about that
28:33 - [Music]
28:35 - Cubs ten says to notice me how is my day
28:39 - random number reading I did forget oh ok
28:44 - so there's a bunch of things being asked
28:45 - right now I don't know if you guys are
28:47 - just talking about eclipses in the chat
28:48 - or if if that's actually a question but
28:53 - on my list I would love to get to this
28:55 - at some point is to look at how to make
28:56 - up library for processing in eclipse and
28:58 - actually how to work with processing the
29:00 - Java based platform in Eclipse because
29:02 - it opens up a lot of doors for those of
29:04 - you who enjoy that platform that
29:06 - programming environment and want to
29:08 - contribute to it
29:09 - how is my day oh my day was great
29:13 - because oops this is now blank but
29:17 - because this extra video coding
29:21 - challenge thing is coming soon and it
29:24 - was cool it was awesome I'm really
29:25 - excited about it but it wasn't so great
29:27 - because I really did not sleep
29:29 - and very tired and I this is like a
29:32 - holly want some of the busiest time of
29:34 - the year also because I am getting ready
29:36 - for processing day so one thing I should
29:38 - mention is this is next Saturday October
29:41 - 21st at the MIT Media Lab tickets are
29:43 - still on sale for this that just so you
29:46 - know that so probably look at Wonka
29:47 - there's pictures oh look there's a
29:48 - picture of me and some other wonderful
29:50 - people
29:51 - Te'o and Choi who has been organizing
29:54 - this event called processing day there
29:56 - is a community clouds project that I've
29:59 - been working on to make name tags I'm
30:00 - gonna do a coding challenge live at
30:02 - processing day so if you're in the
30:03 - Boston area and are interested in coming
30:06 - please do this is the first time that
30:09 - we're having kind of an official
30:10 - processing community event here some of
30:13 - the other wonderful speakers who will be
30:15 - there as well well look there's like a
30:17 - schedule at 2:20 this is what this is me
30:23 - at 2:20 oh boy I'm getting nervous now
30:26 - anyway uh okay answering questions
30:33 - austin asks did we get the nametags sort
30:37 - oh there's a new Adam ID I do not know
30:39 - about this else do we get the nametags
30:40 - sorted out that's in in progress
30:43 - there's a nice me I am so me built a
30:45 - really nice system to generate SVG's and
30:47 - hopefully that's gonna be enough to do
30:48 - the printing is it like scratch day well
30:51 - I didn't attend scratch day so I
30:54 - couldn't say for sure but certainly
30:55 - scratch day is a impetus and in
30:58 - inspiration for us doing an event like
31:01 - this there's also in our do we know day
31:03 - which is I would say like a similar
31:07 - event and scratch is a wonderful project
31:11 - I'll use it I've used it a lot for with
31:13 - kids and stuff like that so you can work
31:17 - with processing by eclipse
31:19 - yeah processing and I should processing
31:22 - is a if I if I run it here and I think I
31:27 - need to download the newer version this
31:29 - is a self-contained application that you
31:33 - can run on Windows Mac or Linux you can
31:36 - write code in here
31:37 - whoops you can write code in here it
31:42 - look
31:42 - if you've seen my recent videos where
31:44 - I'm mostly using p5.js the there's a lot
31:49 - that's similar in terms of the naming
31:51 - but this is actually Java syntax so the
31:56 - syntax the language that this is built
31:58 - on top of his Java so this environment
32:00 - is meant to kind of ease you into
32:02 - programming and make creative sketching
32:04 - coding design stuff I do a lot of coding
32:07 - challenges in processing I don't use it
32:09 - as much as I would like to just because
32:11 - it's so convenient to be able to put the
32:12 - p5.js stuff
32:13 - in the browser to share and get
32:15 - contributions but I aspire to go back to
32:18 - my processing roots and use it more in
32:20 - videos but since this is built on top of
32:21 - Java if you want to contribute to the
32:24 - development of the IDE itself or to the
32:27 - library itself behind all of the
32:29 - functions that are part of the code you
32:31 - might write or add a contribution like a
32:33 - library or a tool or a mode there are
32:36 - modes like for example I could switch
32:37 - this to Opie 5 jazz mode I always forget
32:40 - this is there did I do a video on that
32:42 - because I meant to or Python mode
32:46 - there's different modes and things so I
32:47 - would encourage you to take a look at
32:49 - that if you're interested okay so I
32:51 - think that was my that was my that was
32:56 - my answering some questions and making
32:58 - sure I didn't miss anything somebody
32:59 - said I should read some random numbers
33:01 - but I'll come back to that later okay
33:02 - let's check on the paper flips I need
33:04 - some I need some paper clip music it
33:08 - needs to be very relaxing I'm looking
33:09 - for something I don't have anything if I
33:12 - play this like these like Mozart tracks
33:16 - that I downloaded from Audio hero which
33:20 - is a service that has royalty-free music
33:21 - that you can that you can get you can
33:23 - sign up for and pay for but once I put
33:25 - them on one of my videos it was
33:26 - immediately I got a copyright violation
33:29 - notice alright can you guys hear the
33:31 - chairs and furniture going by in the
33:33 - hallway right now I've got a thousand
33:35 - paper clips
33:37 - I have funds are in serious trouble
33:40 - my unsold inventory I've got a pretty
33:43 - decent amount of wire whoo boy I just
33:45 - bought a lot of wire I didn't mean to do
33:47 - that
33:47 - all right let's let's lower the price a
33:51 - little bit and that's good
33:56 - and let's let this go all right I'm not
33:59 - doing very well the paperclips don't
34:07 - makes it excellent point and the chat
34:10 - it's not your paper clips
34:12 - it's our paper clips I still haven't
34:15 - come up with a I think what I'm gonna
34:17 - have to do just for fairness is if you
34:19 - make more than one guess I'm gonna take
34:22 - your first one or I'll take your I think
34:25 - your last one I'll seem like you change
34:27 - your mind I'll take your last one up
34:29 - until the 3:30 p.m. cutoff 34 minutes it
34:38 - okay good to keep me in check let's do
34:42 - some coding if anybody really wants to
34:46 - help me out I could just really use like
34:49 - a whole new sound board with like a
34:52 - little button for like beginning to code
34:54 - and some music for reading random
34:56 - numbers and some waiting musics and
34:58 - debugging music some other like weird
35:00 - sound effects Emily's going to hear as
35:02 - if they exist but they don't I like this
35:04 - one though let's do some code
35:08 - [Music]
35:10 - my hand is cut off kid
35:17 - [Music]
35:22 - okay what workshop that let's come over
35:25 - here and erase some whiteboard my
35:28 - physical therapist says that erasing a
35:32 - whiteboard it's actually a really good
35:34 - thing for me to do so requires need to
35:37 - use my tricep muscles which are still
35:39 - very very weak apply pressure to the
35:44 - wall and let me see if these the corners
35:48 - is that a corner no the corner is more
35:51 - like here that's fine
35:52 - the corner is like here how's the glare
35:55 - how's everything alright so here we go
36:07 - hello this is a good question there's a
36:15 - good question in the chat loesel macho's
36:19 - asks can you experience li explain why
36:20 - you can't use the random function
36:21 - outside of set up in the p5.js web
36:24 - editor well first of all this is not
36:26 - this is not editor specific if I say let
36:32 - Val equal random 100 like this seems
36:36 - like I should be able to do this right
36:37 - right why not let me go and refresh and
36:40 - I've got an error and look at this did
36:43 - you just try to use five Jazz's random
36:46 - function if so you may want to move it
36:49 - into your sketches setup function for
36:52 - more details see frequently asked
36:54 - questions why can't I assign so first of
36:55 - all you can take a look at this error
36:57 - message click on it and take a look but
36:59 - I'll I will I will
37:00 - I will explain to you what's going on
37:02 - here this is a sort of a strange thing
37:03 - so when a page loads you can start
37:09 - executing JavaScript immediately this
37:11 - just javascript file is loading as its
37:13 - reference in the HTML page but you
37:17 - cannot guarantee that there is an event
37:21 - that happens it's often called like
37:23 - onload maybe are ready and that event is
37:26 - an event that occurs when everything
37:29 - associated with the page
37:30 - loaded all the JavaScript files the
37:32 - style SCSS file all the elements on the
37:34 - page everything is loaded and one of
37:37 - those things that has to load is the
37:38 - p5.js library and the setup function
37:41 - p5.js is the place where you can which
37:45 - guarantees that everything is loaded
37:47 - loaded so far so while I could do
37:49 - something like let Val equals math dot
37:53 - random times 100 which would essentially
37:59 - be the equivalent and I could say Val
38:02 - and I've got that random number this is
38:04 - totally fine because that's coming from
38:08 - native JavaScript that's just the math
38:10 - library is just available for you
38:11 - instantly it's part of the browser
38:12 - itself essentially whereas the p5.js
38:14 - library isn't available unless it's
38:16 - finished loading and it's not finished
38:18 - loading until setup and random as part
38:20 - of that so it doesn't know what it is
38:21 - unless you're in setup alright hopefully
38:23 - that answer that question and now let us
38:28 - begin I'm gonna move this bug out of the
38:30 - way this is going to be something like
38:40 - objects and mouse interaction or
38:42 - clicking on objects something like that
38:51 - it's back for another video about
38:55 - objects and classes and stuff using
38:57 - javascript and p5 GS so one of the
39:00 - things that I get asked all the time I
39:02 - think you know I'm wider around the
39:03 - street people with like hey you there if
39:07 - I made a bunch of bubble objects in a
39:09 - canvas in the browser you imagine if
39:11 - this actually happened to be on the
39:12 - street and I want to like interact with
39:15 - them with the mouse individually like
39:16 - how would I know if the mouse is
39:18 - hovering over one versus the other how
39:20 - would I deal with that well it's just a
39:22 - little bit of an aside first before so
39:23 - this is what I want to implement in this
39:24 - video how can you as how can you have
39:27 - the user interact with individual
39:29 - objects how do I set the code to make
39:32 - that happen how's this work so here's
39:34 - the thing
39:35 - what eventually if you're watching all
39:38 - of these videos in the order that they
39:39 - are there's going to be a time in the
39:42 - future I
39:43 - recording these videos in the past but
39:45 - for you it will be the future where I
39:47 - will add things below the canvas like
39:49 - there'll be a button here or like a box
39:50 - with text in it and the canvas is
39:52 - actually one of those things too while
39:54 - on this page is a canvas I could put
39:55 - other things on this page everything on
39:57 - a web webpage can register events it can
40:01 - register this event of like a click on
40:02 - that's not really an event or I mouse
40:04 - over right I and and there's all sorts
40:07 - of fancy ways in JavaScript and in p5.js
40:09 - to handle all these different types of
40:11 - events to know how users are interacting
40:12 - with things but this thing here this
40:15 - thing here is one thing the canvas the
40:18 - only thing that p5 just knows is if
40:21 - you're clicking on the canvas or not and
40:23 - actually to be honest if you click off
40:26 - the canvas it's gonna make one kind of
40:27 - like it is mined off the canvas that
40:29 - might wander on which it just saw happen
40:30 - because I'm using this global
40:33 - mousepressed event I have an event it's
40:36 - just press the mouse anywhere but what
40:38 - if I want to have an event that's like
40:39 - only when I click on this circle so
40:41 - because these aren't separate the
40:44 - circles are my own invention they're
40:45 - pixels that I've drawn in their space
40:47 - it's up to me as the programmer the the
40:51 - person who designed this sketch to
40:52 - figure out how to handle that and so
40:56 - that's what I'm gonna do in this video
40:57 - so let me think about what would make
40:58 - sense I think what I'm gonna do is I'm
41:00 - gonna rewrite this sketch a little bit
41:01 - I'm gonna get rid of this mouse press
41:03 - function
41:04 - I mean I'm gonna come back to it but in
41:06 - in setup I'm going to say like let X
41:10 - equal random with let y equal random
41:15 - height let R equal random 10 comma 50
41:21 - and then I'm going to say I'm gonna just
41:25 - make this new bubble I'm gonna take this
41:27 - exact code from the bottom you're over
41:29 - there never know where to look one of
41:32 - these days I'll figure it out take this
41:34 - exact code from the bottom and I'm gonna
41:37 - make a new bubble alright so actually
41:43 - let's do this first let's just pretend
41:46 - we only have one let's go let's peel
41:48 - away from the array for a second and
41:50 - let's simplify our lives and let's I'm
41:53 - just going to make a single bubble
41:55 - object
41:56 - and that's gonna be it and forget about
41:59 - this array just for a little bit and so
42:02 - I'll come back to the array eventually
42:04 - now notice that this I'm not changing
42:08 - this bubble class at all it's still the
42:11 - same thing what I wear is it ah but I do
42:14 - need to say that individual bubble move
42:18 - bubble dots show so you might let so
42:22 - what I want to do is I want to have
42:24 - something to happen when I click on that
42:25 - bubble so your first instinct might be
42:27 - AHA well there's this mousepressed
42:30 - function that I can write out here oh ah
42:34 - look at this I wrote this nice mouse
42:36 - press function right out here yeah so
42:40 - why not why not there's this bubble
42:42 - class that I've been learning all about
42:44 - right I just do I know let's just do
42:45 - this
42:47 - console.log clicked on bubble right
42:52 - won't that work that'll work
42:54 - oh I'm so excited this is gonna work
43:00 - nothing's happening nothing's happening
43:02 - so I've sent you in the completely wrong
43:04 - direction
43:05 - although the instinct is kind of right
43:06 - yeah this is like a function that's just
43:09 - out in the wild it's global so it's for
43:11 - any mousepressed this is a function
43:13 - that's inside of the bubble so it's fine
43:17 - but here's the thing this this function
43:20 - mousepressed is a special function that
43:22 - p5 recognizes just like set up a draw or
43:25 - special functions of p5 recognizes p5 is
43:28 - not going to go inside of these new
43:30 - classes that you write and somehow
43:32 - recognize that you could have a mouse
43:33 - press function know where the object is
43:35 - figure out its this is not part of its
43:37 - capability wouldn't I don't even know
43:39 - how it could even be capable of that but
43:40 - there isn't any reason why I couldn't
43:44 - write a function and you know it's a
43:45 - little bit problematic for me to call it
43:47 - mousepressed so maybe I'm just gonna
43:49 - call it like let's just call it like
43:51 - clicked for right now there's no reason
43:54 - why I couldn't inside of the mouse
43:57 - pressed function say hey whatever the
44:00 - user clicks the mouse I know that
44:02 - globally why don't I just call another
44:06 - function inside any of my objects that
44:08 - need to handle that click
44:09 - so I'm gonna say bubble clicked so now
44:11 - look at this it's gonna work let's get a
44:13 - bigger one it's gonna work okay I'm
44:15 - gonna click on it okay look I clicked on
44:16 - the bubble look at me do it again oh
44:18 - well the three times I'm gonna take out
44:20 - over here now six times seven times
44:22 - eight so here's the thing remember this
44:25 - is a global mousepressed so I can call
44:28 - my function on this bubble object but
44:32 - it's just gonna do this every single
44:33 - time it's up to me to write some code to
44:36 - figure out wherever wherever I click the
44:39 - mouse I know where the bubble is and I
44:41 - know how big it is
44:42 - I know it's X and it's why it's our I
44:44 - know it's this dot X is this that Y is
44:46 - this not our what I need to figure out
44:48 - now I'm thinking about the paper clips
44:52 - don't think about the paper clips
44:53 - somebody will watch this video and no
44:54 - idea what you're talking about because
44:55 - they're not watching the live stream
44:56 - don't talk about the paper clips back
45:02 - mystery mystery the mystery of the paper
45:04 - clips this dot note if you know the X
45:07 - the Y and the R we can write some code
45:09 - so I could say something like hmm if
45:12 - okay well how do you so here's here's
45:14 - here's a little bit of a moment here
45:17 - let's say what I one of the things I
45:19 - need to figure out and I've probably
45:21 - done this in other videos but this seems
45:22 - like a nice time to to talk it through
45:24 - is if I have a circle how do I know if a
45:27 - point is inside the circle or is outside
45:29 - the circle because what I'm trying to do
45:31 - is figure out is the mouse that's the
45:34 - mouse arrow did it did it click inside
45:36 - or outside or inside the circle I could
45:39 - ask the same question for a square I
45:41 - couldn't ask that question for a
45:42 - triangle I could ask that question for
45:44 - some arbitrary strangely shaped polygon
45:46 - and all of these are going to get
45:48 - progressively more complex the square in
45:50 - the circle are pretty rectangle and a
45:52 - circle are pretty easy to do this is
45:54 - much harder but all of this is possible
45:56 - the point is I need to write some code
45:58 - to figure that out that code needs to go
46:00 - here did wherever that mouse is is it
46:03 - actually related to where this dot X
46:05 - that's not why did this not our R so how
46:07 - do I do that
46:07 - so one of the nice things that on P 5
46:09 - and both processing if you were using
46:11 - that instead have is a function called
46:13 - dist
46:13 - which stands for distance and I can give
46:16 - that function two points arbitrarily x1
46:21 - y1 x2 y2 so
46:23 - if I make one of those point to the
46:25 - center of the circle maybe I'll call
46:27 - that CX CY and then the other point over
46:33 - here for example is the mouse where the
46:35 - mouse clicked we'll call that MX my I
46:39 - could pass these values into that
46:41 - distance function and get the length of
46:43 - this line call that D something that I
46:48 - happen to know from my code oops wrong
46:51 - button is R the radius of the circle now
46:56 - I'm actually using it as the radius I am
46:57 - because remember the ellipse function
46:59 - itself wants the diameter so R really
47:01 - means the radius which is half of the
47:03 - diameter what do I mean by that
47:04 - so I happen to know this dot R is this
47:10 - distance or another way of looking at it
47:12 - it's this distance right here so guess
47:15 - what this is probably popping into your
47:16 - head just to count now if the distance
47:19 - between the center and the mouse is
47:21 - greater than the radius then that point
47:23 - is outside the circle if it's less than
47:25 - the radius then that point is inside the
47:28 - circle okay so now we could come over
47:32 - here and I could start to add that code
47:36 - I can say let me find the distance
47:38 - between Mouse X Mouse Y and this X and
47:44 - this dot Y and I can now say if D now
47:50 - this is not this dot D because this is a
47:52 - local variable that I'm using just to
47:54 - calculate for at this moment the
47:56 - distance is less than this dot R then
48:02 - console.log clicked on bubble now we're
48:07 - really getting somewhere whoa what just
48:14 - happened did I am I playing something
48:17 - sorry okay do this again
48:21 - now we're really getting somewhere
48:35 - okay so this is a moment of success and
48:39 - that was really loud that's gonna ruin
48:41 - this video so what I've now successfully
48:45 - done is I'm able to determine and only
48:48 - print out this statement so what's the
48:50 - full story here this is where I know
48:53 - that the mouse has been pressed anywhere
48:55 - so it's up to me to now to say like well
48:57 - if the mouse is pressed anywhere let's
48:59 - check if the mouse is pressed for this
49:01 - bubble and guess what let's go back to
49:03 - the array now let's put this array back
49:07 - let's make this a single bubble let's
49:13 - put that into the array and now this
49:17 - loop here just like in draw when I want
49:21 - to move and show everything there's no
49:23 - reason why I couldn't when I click the
49:24 - mouse use that same exact loop and just
49:28 - call clicked on all the bubbles that are
49:31 - in that array so let's see if this works
49:34 - whoops okay I have some air bubble is
49:36 - not too fine a draw so I forgot that I
49:39 - still have this old individual bubble
49:41 - that I don't need anymore so I can click
49:46 - on it it worked
49:47 - I can click outside I don't see anything
49:49 - let's let's actually add now let's do
49:57 - this five times in setup so I'm gonna
50:00 - add five bubbles and now in theory it's
50:04 - we're getting that message if I click on
50:06 - any of them but here's the thing I
50:07 - really want something to happen so I
50:10 - could change its color let's let's
50:12 - actually here's the thing what if I what
50:14 - if I were to just hover over these
50:15 - bubbles and I wanted to change their
50:17 - color if I were to hover over the
50:18 - bubbles and then have something on it so
50:20 - actually you know what there's another
50:22 - important point that I want to make I
50:24 - don't there's something about this
50:26 - function that I don't really like and
50:27 - yes I'm gonna do this from time to time
50:30 - and you will too and it's okay but right
50:32 - there I don't love the fact that I'm
50:34 - using mouse X and mouse Y those are
50:36 - global variables in theory I want my
50:39 - bubble class to only know about itself
50:42 - it doesn't really need to know about the
50:44 - outside world is it to know what's on a
50:45 - canvas that there's a mouse and in
50:47 - theory what I want to be able to do is
50:48 - right
50:49 - of generic bubble class that I could say
50:51 - hey is the mouth cooking on you or is
50:53 - this other sensor overtop of this other
50:56 - object at the same location as you or
50:59 - you know I switch it to using like a
51:00 - Kinect to track my hand is my hand
51:02 - location near this bubble so really what
51:04 - would make more sense is for me to
51:06 - actually put arguments into the clicked
51:10 - function and again I'm doing this sort
51:12 - of awful thing where I'm giving them the
51:13 - same name as arguments in SSR as
51:17 - properties of the class itself I'm
51:19 - giving these parameters X and y the same
51:21 - name is this dot X this that Y but
51:23 - javascript is very good at
51:25 - distinguishing because these this x and
51:27 - y are the ones that are coming in
51:29 - through the parameters and these here
51:32 - are the properties this dot of the
51:33 - object itself but maybe if I want it to
51:35 - be like a little less confusing about I
51:38 - might say like px py for like pixel X or
51:41 - pixel Y or something like that and so
51:44 - now what makes more sense is what I
51:45 - really want to do is pass in Mouse X
51:48 - Mouse Y because what I want to do when
51:50 - the mouse is pressed is ask does this
51:54 - point and really I might do something
51:56 - like contains or inside or it includes
51:59 - likes I could name that function in some
52:00 - other way because really what I'm asking
52:01 - is is that is that is that point inside
52:06 - that object so interestingly enough what
52:09 - I could do is let's let's give the
52:10 - bubbles a color I'm gonna give it like a
52:15 - brightness and make it zero and I'm
52:21 - going to say fill this dot brightness
52:27 - and I'll give it some alpha and then
52:32 - what I'm gonna do is when I've clicked
52:33 - on them I am going to say this dot
52:37 - brightness equals 255 so the idea here
52:43 - is that now bubbles each have a new
52:47 - property a color it starts at zero and
52:50 - any time I click on one of them I turn
52:53 - that one a different color so what's
52:55 - really nice about this is I have one
52:57 - function one function that's part of the
53:01 - class
53:01 - and I could use that function in any way
53:04 - that I want though it just all that
53:05 - function does is test if any generic
53:07 - point is inside a given object and if it
53:10 - is if it is inside that if it sorry
53:13 - inside and I'm inside that shape the
53:15 - geometry of that object if it is I
53:16 - change its color and the way I happen to
53:18 - be using it is by saying hey whenever
53:20 - the user clicks the mouse anywhere let's
53:22 - go check all the objects in our array
53:24 - and see if the mouse is inside them so
53:26 - all right I think this ends this
53:29 - particular video I need to do something
53:31 - where I one thing I would really
53:33 - actually like to do what you should
53:36 - usually do an exercise here so if you're
53:37 - watching this I'm trying to make it head
53:39 - do something different if you hover over
53:40 - the the bubble change the bubble to a
53:44 - rectangle see if you can make the same
53:46 - thing work with a rectangle allow
53:48 - yourself to click on it twice turn it on
53:50 - and off that's something you could try
53:52 - and have a different behavior for when
53:55 - you click on it versus when you just
53:56 - mouse over at those types of things but
53:58 - what I want to do something I want to do
53:59 - and may be able to in the next video is
54:01 - when I click on each one of these I
54:02 - remove them from from the world so I can
54:06 - i can add bubbles and delete them
54:08 - somehow so we have to look at how to
54:09 - delete things from an array okay see you
54:11 - in the next video perhaps okay bye all
54:17 - right people still actually watching
54:20 - this I have 5 new notifications whoa
54:27 - whoa alcázar doing some kind of like
54:29 - magic and the chat there about getting
54:31 - objects to like use mouse press that
54:34 - place outside the scope of my video here
54:37 - where did I do with my uh here's my mug
54:39 - that I put over there oh boy I better
54:42 - check on the paper clips huh these
54:44 - guesses are too late by the way the
54:48 - guest has had to be time-stamped where
54:50 - do I see the timestamp if I go here
54:51 - right
54:52 - 12:20 oh wait so is this oh oh the
54:57 - timestamps on Twitter maybe I'm seeing
55:00 - them at Pacific time okay so let's check
55:03 - on our paper clips boy them to be
55:06 - terribly definitely more auto clippers
55:12 - I'll just get as many as I can
55:15 - all right now I need to lower that price
55:19 - that should be better
55:21 - camera went off all right so I did Simon
55:30 - your perfect timing placing that list in
55:33 - again so deleting elements is definitely
55:36 - something that I want to do interacting
55:38 - with objects is done objects is talking
55:40 - to other objects clicking on objects in
55:43 - deleting them okay and to out more okay
55:46 - so let's see the paper good things gonna
55:51 - speed up right you know I just got to
55:54 - get to a hundred dollars let this go to
55:55 - a hundred dollars I think I've got
55:59 - plenty of wire well look at this oh boy
56:02 - oh I've got computational resources now
56:04 - I've got conversation okay you guys mind
56:07 - if we just take a couple minutes here so
56:10 - this needs to get to a thousand or 750
56:12 - and I can improve the auto cliff burrs I
56:16 - can't quite I have two extra let's oh no
56:19 - no I only have to trust so I need to get
56:21 - three thousand clips and I'll get an
56:23 - extra trust which you can give more
56:24 - memory or more processor I don't know
56:25 - which one so what should I do next I
56:27 - think probably Oh paper clips isn't
56:30 - running when I'm in another tap did
56:33 - anybody know that when making their
56:34 - guests let's check this okay oh boy I
56:39 - wonder if I take it out and what if I do
56:43 - this now it's running but I can't have
56:47 - this in the background of my video
56:48 - tutorials oh but let's see what if I put
56:50 - it behind there okay so here I am I'm
56:57 - like dude do I'm making a video tutorial
57:00 - about coding this is me making video to
57:03 - talk about Kony I already forgot and now
57:05 - I'm gonna check the paper clips
57:07 - twenty-seven twenty-seven hundred so if
57:09 - I go away again to this other one and
57:12 - it's like if I wait a little bit
57:18 - whoa this one laptop it should be above
57:26 - 3000 now right let's see oh oh yeah well
57:37 - I got 3000 I ran out
57:39 - I need wire do I have money for wire
57:41 - thank God I have money for a wire I can
57:44 - improve my Auto Clippers oh I definitely
57:48 - want to definitely need this revenue
57:50 - tracker that's gonna be really helpful
57:53 - let's raise the price a little bit let's
57:57 - buy some more wire I really don't want
57:59 - to run out of wire let's buy some more
58:01 - Auto Clippers raise the price again and
58:04 - am I at 500 yet okay I need to get this
58:07 - revenue track go to the next video I
58:09 - swear let's get to this revenue tracker
58:13 - of case 69 cents per second let's see
58:16 - him let's move that up to $1.00 per
58:19 - second okay that's good and this should
58:25 - be good this should work for a little
58:26 - while a dollar 36 per second okay I'm
58:29 - gonna let this go I think I'm in pretty
58:31 - good shape
58:31 - oh I've got more we need some more
58:33 - memory so let's go okay so the next
58:36 - thing I want to do is a video I'm gonna
58:45 - do one more of these object tutorials
58:49 - and by the way added to that list I
58:53 - should do something about getters and
58:54 - setters because I do think that's a it's
58:57 - kind of beyond the scope of what I'm
58:58 - doing in my video tutorials but it's a
59:00 - useful feature of es6 classes that's
59:02 - something I'm not completely used to
59:03 - because it's a little bit different than
59:05 - how it works in like Java or C++ but I
59:08 - should do that alright yes check I'd
59:13 - know making a paperclip game coding
59:16 - challenges like the worst idea for me
59:17 - ever I will never leave this room I
59:21 - already have a problem I already have
59:23 - enough of a problem Frank
59:28 - why what have you done this to me why
59:30 - please just tell me is there an end let
59:33 - me let me just check I'm gonna check my
59:34 - actual oh this is not going because self
59:40 - cricket oh I can get the self-correcting
59:42 - supply chain you guys can't see this but
59:44 - let me just okay alright I don't know
59:49 - what's going on here I'll come back to
59:50 - that later back to the selection the
59:55 - whistle is mountainy all right so if
60:03 - you're joining late I'm so sorry if
60:06 - you've been here old time I'm also very
60:08 - sorry so now what I want to do is let's
60:12 - do the clicking so first of all these
60:14 - these bubbles are really making me crazy
60:16 - the bubbles are so nervously bouncing
60:20 - around let me let me just adjust the
60:23 - class a little bit to just be a little
60:28 - less frenetic okay so I think what I'm
60:35 - gonna do
60:35 - ah and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
60:39 - quickly take this op4 and what I'm gonna
60:48 - do is what I'm going to do is I'm gonna
61:01 - call this point I'm gonna call this
61:03 - point over or maybe mouse over I don't
61:05 - know call that mouse over it's probably
61:09 - terrible name no no what should I call
61:10 - this does a generic just call it
61:12 - contains maybe that'll work
61:16 - and what I'm going to do is I'm gonna
61:20 - take this and just move it to draw I
61:24 - don't need to move it to draw just gonna
61:25 - say bubbles index I'd contains Mouse X
61:30 - Mouse why I know what to call it
61:32 - roll over that's what I want roll over
61:34 - and I'm
61:36 - just change this to rollover and I'm
61:39 - gonna say otherwise this dot brightness
61:42 - equals zero so what I want to start with
61:45 - let's see if this works
61:47 - OOP something the wrong one for uh oh I
61:53 - edited the wrong code didn't I that's
61:54 - fine
61:55 - at least I saved it back up yeah okay
61:58 - hold on let me rename these so this one
62:02 - this one is actually four and this one
62:06 - is now three and yeah okay so this is
62:13 - what I want I want them to be generally
62:15 - bigger too because it's a little easier
62:17 - to and I can take this out this extra
62:20 - code and I am going to just have them be
62:26 - generally a little bit bigger in size
62:29 - whoops this I don't need okay so I just
62:34 - quickly changed this to be have a
62:36 - rollover and let me also make ten of
62:40 - them just to have more whoa hold on did
62:48 - I hit safe oh I mean three still ah crud
62:56 - I'm gonna have to pick have to fix this
62:58 - later I saved over what I was doing oh
63:07 - just bear with me everybody this will
63:10 - get fixed eventually okay make twenty to
63:17 - sixty and make ten of them yeah if by
63:22 - the way a little note to self e'er if
63:24 - you mess with the file system outside of
63:27 - Adam but leave everything open and Adam
63:28 - your move files around you save them
63:30 - it's gonna save it back to where it was
63:31 - originally
63:32 - so doesn't know about you moving the
63:34 - file system okay so what I want to add
63:35 - to this is click to delete click er
63:39 - I should really name things better yes I
63:42 - definitely should
63:46 - when is the paper clips reveal it will
63:49 - be whenever I am done with the whenever
63:53 - I am done with the live stream and I
63:54 - will review wait a second oh no it's
63:57 - still it's a different I was so worried
63:58 - I closed it by accident
63:59 - oh no hold on I've run out of stuff okay
64:04 - any more wire we just buy some more wire
64:07 - here let me improve the wire extrusion
64:12 - buy some more wire dollar okay we really
64:17 - can't have I I need more memory
64:19 - I should really add more processors and
64:23 - I should get some more Clippers cuz I'm
64:26 - running out of there we go so I want
64:31 - this to stabilize a certain amount of
64:34 - money
64:35 - / yeah I want this just maybe I should
64:40 - some more let's make some more Clippers
64:43 - we want this to stabilize let's lower
64:46 - the price a little bit yeah that's good
64:51 - that's what I wanted to see I'm running
64:52 - out of I'm not clipping them fast enough
64:57 - I'm selling them faster than I can clip
64:59 - them let's go back to five cents I want
65:01 - this to settle at least $1.00 per second
65:04 - right now okay before I go back to the
65:07 - codec okay that's pretty good all right
65:12 - what am i no no no over here for ten
65:20 - we've got lots of time at 4:30 no no
65:24 - this is not my game I did not make this
65:26 - game
65:27 - Frank Frank made this game Oh Frank
65:33 - the tain whistle anyway all right so
65:44 - [Applause]
65:49 - hello it's me back again with some these
65:53 - bubbles again Oh a the bubbles
65:55 - someday I'll think of something besides
65:57 - bubbles but the bubbles kind of works
65:59 - so I the last video I kind of looked at
66:01 - how I could click on the bubbles and
66:04 - change their color and now I just
66:07 - adjusted the code a little bit so I
66:08 - could mouse over the bubbles and you
66:10 - know I could show you what I did I did
66:12 - this in-between where I now I'm using
66:14 - this function called rollover I rename
66:16 - the click function to rollover I gave it
66:18 - these arguments and in doing the same
66:20 - sort of thing if the distance is if it's
66:22 - inside the circle I turn it white if
66:24 - it's not I turn it black so what I want
66:28 - to do now is I want to click on the
66:30 - bubble and have it pop I wanted to
66:33 - disappear how do I do that well good
66:36 - news everybody
66:37 - I kind of did I didn't all of that in
66:40 - the last video except for the whole what
66:44 - did I forget to do oh the deleting from
66:46 - an array so let's let's think about that
66:48 - so okay how do i how do I remove
66:50 - something I mean one one way I could
66:52 - remove something is just stop drawing it
66:54 - or move it way off screen and there was
66:56 - it there were in the old days without
66:58 - the code with like 6 feet of snow next
67:01 - to me sometimes you had to do that
67:03 - because it'd this fixed array you
67:05 - couldn't take things out you couldn't
67:06 - add things to it so you would kind of
67:07 - like reuse elements and move them off
67:09 - screen but here in the land of
67:10 - JavaScript there's a really nice thing
67:12 - you could do it I'm gonna come over here
67:13 - to this camera that's not on and I'm
67:22 - gonna come over here I'm gonna erase
67:25 - this distance thing and at some point
67:29 - there's gonna be a jump cut to where I
67:31 - have erased it and now what do I want to
67:41 - talk about so I have this a ring one of
67:46 - the things that I showed in a previous
67:48 - video okay so let's say this array is
67:49 - called bubbles because that's what it's
67:52 - called the whole array when apart the
67:56 - whole array I'm saying the word bubbles
67:58 - when I am referencing a specific element
68:01 - of the array I reference it by its index
68:03 - often within square brackets and the
68:06 - index numbers are 0 1 2 3 4 5 so this is
68:10 - bubbles in deck
68:12 - - now one of the things I showed in the
68:15 - previous video is that there is a
68:16 - function called push that function
68:20 - allows me to add something to the end of
68:23 - the array in fact there is also a
68:25 - function called pop and that function
68:28 - allows what it does is it will take
68:30 - something off the end of the array and
68:31 - pop it off so if what I wanted to do is
68:34 - always delete the last element of the
68:36 - array I could use the pop function now
68:39 - there are lots of other functions
68:40 - there's like shift I think there's even
68:42 - like an unshifted be crazy could just be
68:46 - making that up shift manager snow but
68:49 - here's I think where do these functions
68:51 - come from so there's this question that
68:53 - comes up over and over again in these
68:55 - videos and you're probably sitting there
68:57 - asking it to yourself wait a sec my
68:59 - learning JavaScript I know I sort of
69:01 - made me learning to code but I have my
69:03 - learning JavaScript my Lenape 5 is the
69:05 - same thing is it different well this is
69:08 - a complicated question and I would like
69:10 - in theory in my mind's eye I would like
69:12 - to say that these videos are just about
69:14 - learning to code and think about code
69:16 - and think computationally I happen to be
69:17 - using the programming language
69:18 - JavaScript I'm using this library p5.js
69:21 - to make the drawing stuff easier and it
69:23 - all kind of mixes together so that was
69:26 - kind of larger question aside this stuff
69:29 - that has to do with an array is not
69:31 - coming from p5 GS if I say ellipse this
69:36 - is a special function that's in p5.js
69:38 - what it does is it call some other
69:40 - functions that are just part of
69:41 - JavaScript without p5 GS but it's I can
69:44 - only say ellipse because I'm using a
69:45 - p5.js library these functions don't come
69:48 - from p5 yes they come they're just part
69:50 - of the JavaScript language so how do I
69:53 - find out a list of these and how I can
69:55 - use them come back over here with me
69:59 - alright so the place that I like to use
70:02 - is the Mozilla Foundation Docs I'm just
70:06 - saying Mozilla Foundation array
70:08 - JavaScript that's going to be my Google
70:10 - search and I'm gonna go here so this is
70:16 - here's the thing one of the reasons why
70:18 - I like using p5 Jessen tutorials is look
70:22 - here's the reference here's all the
70:24 - stuff it's kind of like one page if I'm
70:25 - actually
70:26 - stuff but it's kind of self-contained
70:29 - and it's it has a smaller world view so
70:32 - to speak it's like it's a walled garden
70:35 - so to speak this is like the JavaScript
70:38 - documentation there is so much here
70:41 - you couldn't possibly mean you could but
70:43 - it would be it would take you a long
70:44 - time to read through everything but here
70:46 - I am at least on a page that's giving me
70:48 - some information about arrays and you
70:51 - can see look Obeid there's this what is
70:54 - that oh my god okay it's a for each loop
71:03 - someday I'll have to come back and look
71:04 - at that and what does that do and why
71:06 - would you use it oh my god oh my
71:07 - goodness okay but you can see here look
71:09 - pop oh I'm not I'm not crazy shift
71:11 - on shift you can see what these
71:13 - functions do where are you you're over
71:15 - there
71:15 - and look there's a whole list of them so
71:17 - let's look through them maybe we can
71:18 - find one that removes something from an
71:20 - array pink at copy within entries every
71:25 - filter fine I got it go for each
71:29 - [Music]
71:33 - okay well looking for own so here's the
71:40 - thing us place I happen to know wouldn't
71:42 - it be nice to just be one that's called
71:44 - like delete or remove but the one that
71:46 - I'm looking for is this place and this
71:48 - method changes the contents of an array
71:50 - by removing existing elements and or
71:53 - adding elements it can do a lot of
71:56 - different things I want to use it for
71:57 - the deletion so if I come back over here
71:59 - I want to use this slice function so can
72:02 - I ran up here and you can see it yes
72:04 - slice slice takes two arguments and
72:09 - there may be other ways to use slice but
72:11 - for the purpose of this video tutorial
72:13 - the two arguments are what matters the
72:15 - first one is an index and the second one
72:18 - and I'm kind of moving sorry doing that
72:21 - thing where I'm drawing off the
72:22 - whiteboard gasps okay go to town here
72:24 - that's a little bit better
72:24 - the first one is it index the second one
72:27 - I'll just call how many so if I say
72:31 - slice index
72:32 - - how many comma 1 what it does is it
72:36 - just takes this element and slices it
72:39 - out removes it from the array let me
72:41 - show you what I need so one of the
72:45 - things that I could do to sort of
72:46 - investigate this is I could just use the
72:48 - JavaScript console here in the browser
72:50 - that I'm using right now and I could say
72:53 - let's words equal you know rainbow and
72:59 - unicorn and kitten I was gonna try to
73:06 - think this thing else turtle paper clip
73:12 - paper plinth words dot push paper clip
73:17 - okay so now we can see I have this array
73:20 - with five things in it and if I were to
73:23 - say words dot splice index 3 comma 1
73:28 - what should happen here 0 1 2 3 I should
73:34 - look at this whoops so one thing is
73:38 - interesting about slice is as it deletes
73:41 - it kind of like hands it back to you I'm
73:43 - not gonna use that in this video
73:44 - but it's kind of interest
73:45 - that it does that it's probably too much
73:47 - information here but if I look at the
73:49 - array words right now you'll notice
73:51 - turtle is gone it's just rainbow uniform
73:54 - kitten so the idea here is that even
73:57 - though I can do a lot with this slice
73:58 - function if I just want to delete one
74:00 - element from the array I could say hey
74:03 - this particular number index just that
74:07 - one and so that's what I want to do what
74:08 - I want to do is how could I then with
74:10 - this code example click on this and
74:15 - remove it actually delete it from the
74:17 - array well I know there's so much here
74:20 - you know what I should do here's the
74:22 - thing look at this function rollover hmm
74:25 - there's something kind of interesting
74:26 - about this function which is that I'm
74:28 - doing two things at once one thing is
74:32 - that I'm checking to see if the mouth if
74:33 - that point is inside that bubble and
74:36 - then I'm also changing its color and it
74:38 - probably makes more sense for me to have
74:40 - this function be much more generic for
74:42 - it just to like return true or false
74:45 - because I might want to reuse this ideas
74:47 - it was a point over that is a point over
74:50 - that object that circle other times so
74:53 - I'm gonna change this to return true
74:57 - whoops if if it's rolling over return
75:00 - true otherwise return false and then I'm
75:03 - gonna write a new function called change
75:05 - color and I'm going to say this dot
75:07 - brightness equals 255 so I wanted to
75:11 - remove the idea of the changing color
75:13 - from here because now I can say if write
75:18 - that function you might not have you you
75:21 - know I covered return what return means
75:23 - in my functions video tutorial but you
75:25 - know when do I ever need that well now I
75:27 - need it what I want to say but not
75:31 - remove I'm not removing it sorry a
75:33 - change color I'm that's what I'm gonna
75:35 - do eventually right I want to say and
75:38 - and maybe I shouldn't call it roll over
75:39 - anymore I should just say contains let's
75:41 - call it contains and i'ma change it to
75:44 - contains what I want to do right this
75:47 - function is going to return true or
75:48 - false and I know some of you are saying
75:49 - I could just return this this statement
75:53 - itself violates true or false so it's
75:55 - redundant to say if it's true return
75:57 - true
75:58 - if it's false return false I could just
76:00 - say return its value true or false I'll
76:02 - let you do that to simplify your own
76:04 - code as an exercise but now what I can
76:07 - do here this should be exactly the same
76:08 - program oh I have an error contains is
76:11 - not a function
76:12 - bubble index i contains mmm you know
76:16 - what is contain something oh boy
76:19 - am I not allowed to use the word
76:21 - contains what if I missed I think I
76:28 - might not be allowed to use the word
76:29 - contains I'm gonna sort it let's pause
76:32 - for a second here I keep closing this
76:34 - lecture includes as part of an array oh
76:47 - oh you're telling me the slice displays
76:51 - did I write slice okay record scratch
76:56 - sound do I have that hold on a second
76:58 - apparently I've done something horrible
77:00 - oh look at this this whole time maybe
77:04 - much good could do a magic thing where
77:06 - after I write slice he can fade it in
77:10 - this should say splice apologies this
77:12 - should say splice splice splice splice
77:17 - is the correct term I will leave that up
77:19 - there for a second and that's gonna have
77:22 - to get fixed I was saying slice that
77:25 - hump dub over my voice and then the
77:28 - function need to use is nice and after
77:31 - that to remove an element from the array
77:32 - please use splice no work right
77:37 - yes place is kind of a say can I do you
77:40 - slice but just say begin and end such as
77:42 - always the next one I really kept saying
77:46 - slice
77:55 - yeah maybe but we'll dub it that'll be
77:57 - good or I can just we could put a little
78:00 - like pop-up that says I should be saying
78:02 - splice their help how bad could it be
78:04 - thank you Matt huge fudge tree extra
78:07 - paper clips is something wrong with the
78:09 - paper clips now that I'm taking a break
78:11 - I can check them whoops oh shoot why is
78:15 - this contains not working oh I just
78:17 - didn't save it I can't look at the I
78:24 - can't look at the YouTube chat because I
78:25 - know they could be like messing with me
78:27 - but okay let's see let's let's just at
78:34 - least check wait oh there's here's the
78:36 - paper clips how's the paper clip string
78:37 - oh I ran out of inventory again I ran
78:40 - out of wire there's a thing that I can
78:42 - get for a Y first of all I definitely
78:43 - need these better Auto Clippers I'm
78:46 - gonna need a lot more wire well let me
78:48 - see if I get up to the marketing real
78:50 - quick if I could get up to the marketing
78:51 - before I go back well it's actually
78:54 - gonna be a pretty low number for those
78:56 - of you are guessing low although it
78:58 - might just sort of like explode at a
79:00 - certain point okay let me get the
79:03 - marketing so now I can raise the price
79:13 - why is mine no I want to know I okay I
79:18 - made a dollar 67 $3.00 per second am I
79:24 - making enough well let's really let's
79:27 - lower it but I need to make more
79:28 - Clippers and I've got more let me get
79:31 - some processors I can get the creativity
79:34 - now let me raise the price a little bit
79:39 - cuz I'm I really need the thing there's
79:41 - a thing that you can get which like auto
79:42 - buys wire whenever you run out which I'm
79:44 - definitely going to need because I'm oh
79:47 - because I'm just gonna I need to buy
79:51 - some more auto Clippers just to get this
79:54 - going faster
79:57 - that's a little bit better now because
79:59 - this you can see that I could get $3.00
80:01 - per second if I could make I guess I
80:03 - could go to four cents more of these I
80:12 - should really stop this right I need to
80:14 - come back okay this is good this is good
80:16 - we're at four cents I'm gonna just buy
80:20 - some more wire it's gonna run on a wire
80:22 - really fast I'm not making enough money
80:26 - okay let me just quickly buy a little
80:28 - bit more wire before I go back no it's
80:29 - fine I can't focus on this let's go back
80:31 - all right
80:34 - so actually I don't know how to I'm back
80:40 - after some mishegoss there but contains
80:46 - is fine I've got worried like a my
80:47 - overriding some built-in name but and
80:51 - that a my oh my hold on a sec do you
81:00 - think let's is object dot prototype dot
81:03 - contains objects dot prototype dot
81:06 - contains is that a function in
81:07 - JavaScript at something can contains no
81:14 - it's has own property is if it could so
81:16 - I think that's okay so I'm gonna just
81:18 - skip over that discussion I'm gonna go
81:21 - back to okay so so I'm gonna change this
81:28 - to contains which I just did and that
81:29 - didn't work but now I'm back because I
81:31 - just didn't save the file and whoops oh
81:34 - yeah no I do want that page and so now
81:37 - we're back to exactly what I had before
81:39 - but the point of what I was doing was
81:42 - that now that I've separated out the
81:44 - logic of just checking if a point is in
81:46 - something I can now in mousepressed I'm
81:49 - going to just grab this exact code and
81:51 - I'm gonna add mouse press back in so in
81:55 - mousepressed I can check hey does the is
82:00 - the mouse in there now this is when the
82:02 - mouse is pressed check again and then
82:04 - what do I want to do bubbles dot splice
82:08 - I comma one look
82:09 - that's beautiful look at this thing a
82:11 - beauty here I'm able to reuse that idea
82:13 - by saying okay just during draw all the
82:16 - time check if the mouse is over it if
82:18 - the mouse is over it changes color I
82:20 - know I spelled splice wrong in
82:23 - mousepressed when the mouse has been
82:24 - clicked anywhere check to see if it's in
82:27 - there if if you click on a particular
82:30 - bubble and if so delete it from the
82:31 - array which should cause it to disappear
82:33 - from the page and there we go now I kind
82:38 - of alright it doesn't
82:40 - oh I lost my change-back how did I lose
82:42 - that oh look at that I forgot she look
82:48 - interestingly enough I had this feature
82:50 - that one it doesn't and so what I
82:51 - probably should do here is give this an
82:53 - argument so I had this feature where it
82:56 - weight it changes to white when it's
82:58 - over back to black when it's not so I
83:00 - should probably give this change color
83:02 - function and argument like bright
83:04 - parameter bright and pass that in I did
83:07 - that kind of quickly but that fixes that
83:09 - and then I should be able to just delete
83:12 - all of them okay that's basically it now
83:19 - I feel like there's so many things I
83:20 - wanted to do with this we tried to think
83:24 - for a second yeah oh I'm missing an
83:29 - important point oh oh boy that's not it
83:33 - I'm missing kind of an important point
83:35 - and I did cover this there's a particle
83:37 - system coding challenge which does this
83:39 - but I I think I should talk about it
83:41 - here which is something strange just
83:43 - happened which is that I was iterating
83:48 - over the array
83:49 - I was checking elements zero then I was
83:52 - checking element two one sorry then I'm
83:54 - checking element two and at that little
83:57 - bit when I checked element two if that's
83:58 - the one that I clicked on and I should
84:00 - really call these I'm gonna call these
84:02 - a-b-c-d-e-f-g I pretend the particles
84:06 - have a letter because these index values
84:08 - are gonna change in a weird sort of way
84:09 - let me explain this again I'm checking a
84:12 - don't delete it I'm checking B don't
84:15 - delete it I'm checking C delete it so
84:17 - what happens next
84:20 - when I delete C
84:26 - the array all of a sudden looks like
84:29 - this one but it's got one fewer element
84:35 - in it so we don't need to race with my
84:37 - fingers and it's got a B no c d e f g 0
84:43 - 1 2 3 4 5
84:46 - what was the part with what was the
84:48 - bubble I last checked the last bubble I
84:50 - checked was 3 in index 2 so in my
84:53 - iterating I'm now going to was set it
84:56 - wrong
84:58 - what was the last bubble I checked the
85:01 - last bubble I checked was bubble C in
85:03 - index spot - right here so if I is going
85:08 - up by 1 the next thing it should check
85:10 - is index 3 and but this is what the
85:14 - array looks like now so if I check index
85:16 - 3 now I'm gonna check and see should I
85:18 - delete e what happened I didn't bother
85:21 - to check D because as soon as I removed
85:23 - C D becomes 2 got moves to index pot 2
85:27 - and my counter moves up so I could do
85:29 - something like if I could add like an
85:31 - eye - - so I could say like oh if I'm
85:33 - deleting something like set the index
85:35 - back to go check the next one there's a
85:38 - bunch of different ways around this
85:39 - probably if I use that for each loop
85:43 - [Music]
85:45 - maybe that would help me somehow but I
85:49 - actually in this case it doesn't matter
85:51 - because here's the thing it only would
85:53 - hopes over using that sound effect in
86:02 - this case it doesn't matter I you know
86:04 - if I look at this like there's nothing
86:06 - wrong nothing bad happens now you only
86:09 - would it only would be bad if it so
86:11 - happens that I tried to leak two of them
86:13 - at once and the other one that I delete
86:15 - happens to be the next one in the array
86:17 - so none of these are overlapping right
86:19 - now that's so let me try to leave both
86:21 - of these they both deleted but yeah I
86:22 - could get bad luck where the I'm
86:25 - hovering over both of these and so only
86:27 - this one gets to lead and then this one
86:28 - doesn't get checked so again I could
86:30 - decrement the index but another way I
86:33 - could do it is if I'm actually iterating
86:34 - through the array backwards it doesn't
86:36 - matter if I remove something and the
86:37 - array slides could chunks back over I'm
86:40 - still going towards the beginning I
86:41 - won't miss any so you'll see that in a
86:43 - lot of my code examples some people like
86:45 - to say I - - I prefer generally speaking
86:48 - - if I'm deleting stuff from the array
86:51 - to start at the end which is bubbles dot
86:54 - length minus one then have my iterator
86:58 - go down - - and then where am I where do
87:02 - I end I go all the way down to the first
87:04 - element which is at index zero the last
87:06 - element is the length minus one like if
87:08 - they're five of them zero one two three
87:10 - what four or five of them zero one two
87:13 - three four so start it 5-1 four go all
87:17 - the way down to zero so let's just make
87:19 - sure that this works and it does still
87:23 - the same exact result I can delete I can
87:25 - hover over and delete all of them so
87:28 - there you go
87:29 - this is a a little video about clicking
87:34 - and removing things from the array
87:36 - there's some other things for things I
87:37 - could do I you know here's the thing the
87:39 - point of me telling about this going
87:40 - backwards thing is more to say that hey
87:43 - if you are manipulating an array while
87:46 - you're iterating over it you should
87:48 - probably be careful what if for example
87:50 - I were adding elements to the array want
87:53 - it
87:53 - and I could maybe never get to the end
87:55 - right so anyway so this is really
87:57 - something that you need to think about
87:58 - so let's see what should you do in this
88:01 - video I have an idea something you could
88:02 - try is have HAP make a sketch where you
88:05 - can make as many bubble objects as you
88:07 - want but delete them when they've left
88:09 - the window you could try that you can
88:11 - also do something action I'm gonna do
88:12 - something for you right now which is
88:13 - kind of an interesting effect there's a
88:16 - little bonus for the end of the video
88:17 - that I think you could probably make
88:18 - something with let me save this timeout
88:22 - we think here I'm gonna make a new
88:24 - version of the code really quickly even
88:29 - though I've already messed that up I'm
88:33 - gonna make this Opie 5 I'm gonna check
88:37 - the chat why is this computer go to
88:39 - sleep filter filter still has the same
88:48 - issue ok for 8 look at hold on come back
88:51 - I'll come back to that so let me just
88:53 - give me a second I don't know why I'm
88:54 - stuck on demonstrating this but I think
88:56 - this is kind of useful so hold on a sec
89:05 - I want to demonstrate something real
89:07 - quick am I in five now so four there's
89:17 - one more thing I want to demonstrate
89:18 - here because I think it leads it lends
89:21 - itself to an interesting exercise before
89:22 - I do that for each apparently has the
89:24 - same problem but there are other fancy
89:25 - ways to remove things from an array okay
89:28 - um maybe I don't need to say that on my
89:30 - own
89:30 - so I really wanted just finished let me
89:34 - do this extra thing and we can decide
89:36 - whether it include it or not before I
89:38 - finish I want to add one I'm just gonna
89:40 - redo this example a little bit just to
89:41 - demonstrate one thing I'm going to put
89:43 - it back to the version of it which sorry
89:47 - which had me where I added bubbles
89:50 - whenever I drag the mouse so I'm gonna
89:54 - say Mouse dragged and I'm going to just
90:00 - I'm gonna add bubbles at the mouse
90:04 - and something like just give them all
90:08 - the same size just for simplicity right
90:10 - now so what I what this should do is
90:12 - give me back to this I'm kind of drawing
90:17 - with these bubble objects the reason why
90:18 - I'm showing you this is this I think
90:20 - might allow you to plea bit more playful
90:22 - and how you think about removing for
90:24 - example one thing I could do is I could
90:27 - say just if bubbles dot length is
90:32 - greater than is it's greater than well
90:36 - ten bubbles dot splice zero comma one
90:41 - so I'm saying like hey only just only
90:43 - ever have ten elements in that array and
90:45 - there's maybe there's a bigger news
90:46 - shift there to like remove just the
90:48 - first one but and you can see this is
90:50 - gives me this kind of like snake-like
90:51 - thing but notice as I let go each one of
90:55 - these is still an individual object now
90:56 - I've lost the clicking on it thing but
90:58 - and I can come back so that I think
91:00 - there's some more possibilities there's
91:01 - almost like a little object that's like
91:03 - a little thing that's storing its
91:05 - history and the reason why I talk of
91:06 - this is I have another video this is a
91:08 - kind of a hard exercise but um something
91:11 - good think about what if this were its
91:13 - own object and you had a bunch of these
91:14 - on the screen so I have another video
91:16 - that about object storing their own path
91:18 - that all that I'll link to from this
91:20 - video and so hopefully now you've got
91:23 - some ideas about how to remove things
91:24 - from an array thanks for watching
91:31 - alright I think I was worth keeping this
91:36 - video I feel like that was like a really
91:38 - long tutorial but probably just because
91:41 - it's been so long since I looked at the
91:44 - paper clips I'm sure I've run out of
91:46 - wire totally run out of wire by some
91:50 - wire what can I get let's get some more
91:55 - trust look what I want is I really want
91:59 - the thing where I can automatically I'll
92:01 - do this you slogan Oh marketing
92:04 - effectiveness so this is all good now I
92:06 - can add another processor and some more
92:08 - memory could buy some more wire I can
92:13 - buy some more auto Clippers
92:16 - really can lower the price a little bit
92:21 - raise the price there we go this is good
92:25 - Oh where's the price again buy some more
92:29 - Auto Clippers now I'm just clicking on
92:35 - stuff with no oh I have more processor
92:39 - more memory I really just want the thing
92:42 - that I could buy the wire automatically
92:44 - then I can let this go I'm at like
92:45 - 17,000 I think my inventory is kind of
92:48 - stabilized that's good buy some more
92:51 - wire buy some more wire buy some more
92:53 - wire buy some more wire by supplier and
92:56 - then I'm gonna go back to the tutorial
92:59 - stuff all right a little bit more Auto
93:03 - Clippers okay that's good enough for
93:04 - right now now wire will hopefully last
93:06 - us my inventory is stabilized let's go
93:09 - back the wire buyer comes at 7k7
93:15 - 7000 operations so actually I just need
93:19 - to I need to get this memory up to seven
93:23 - alright alright oh yeah 7000 down there
93:26 - so I definitely need that okay so let me
93:30 - talk about what I'm gonna do next so I
93:32 - have a hopefully like a little less than
93:33 - an hour left but I want to go back to
93:35 - the chat bot stuff and I'm gonna use
93:38 - this library call p5 speech so p5 speech
93:44 - p5 and so let me get this stuff out if
93:47 - you want github and I'm gonna go back to
93:50 - my chat I'm so I'm gonna that's gonna be
93:52 - enough for the object stuff today I
93:53 - still have more of those to make but I
93:55 - feel like it I like to be able to do
93:57 - both courses in the same live session so
94:02 - now I want to go to make a
94:12 - let me go to was it P 5g - beat generate
94:23 - - B speech 1 okay so now I have another
94:31 - and then let's run the server and what I
94:37 - want to do now is I'm gonna open instead
94:44 - the chat bot stuff in Adam I haven't
94:48 - Adam there it is and let me go to
94:54 - localhost oh I'm in the wrong I'm in the
94:58 - uh hold on a sec I mean the rock I mean
95:02 - the the did I get to 7000 wait wait hold
95:06 - on we're close let's please glad to get
95:09 - to 21,000 and the memory up to six oh I
95:20 - should definitely do this buy some more
95:25 - wire just because I can't in a little
95:27 - while later and I'll slower the price to
95:31 - five cents yeah we're doing well now
95:33 - alright so what I want to do now let's
95:42 - get to here and
95:51 - just get rid of this and say so um let
96:04 - me get I also want to do everyone can
96:07 - just bear with me for a second do I have
96:14 - I want to get my examples from my A to Z
96:19 - course I'm gonna need to reference them
96:21 - I don't know that oops so I just need to
96:25 - clone this repo real quick and let me
96:35 - let's just let's just see quickly let me
96:44 - just briefly see chatbots speech basics
96:52 - sketch let me just make sure this
96:58 - example works
97:09 - hmm whoops
97:19 - it's not loading the library p5 speech
97:25 - because I made it a sub-module because
97:28 - I'm a lunatic hold on everybody
97:31 - oh yeah well I know what to do I'm gonna
97:52 - do this in a bad way but it'll be fine
97:56 - so I need to get the I need to get the P
98:01 - I forgot that I didn't update this which
98:03 - I wish I had I'm going to go here and
98:10 - week and then I want to say get so I'm
98:16 - gonna say remove - our p5 Jess - speech
98:20 - and then I'm going to p5.js speech
98:31 - one of these days I will get all this
98:33 - stuff ready beforehand and now I need to
98:40 - clone this don't worry it's not this
98:42 - complicated to use it it's just the
98:44 - ridiculous way that I've set this up and
98:48 - so now my hope is that here okay now can
98:56 - you hear that but probably not so let me
99:09 - I need to fix the sound settings here
99:12 - sound multi output device I think will
99:16 - work a lot of coding trainer
99:18 - can you guys hear that now hello coding
99:22 - training how is the how's the volume
99:25 - there hello okay alright so so I want to
99:59 - make sure that this works and I'm gonna
100:03 - locally bring the locally bring the
100:05 - locally bring the locally brain all
100:09 - right
100:09 - so now what I'm going to do is do a
100:13 - tutorial about the speech library I'm
100:16 - gonna build something like this but not
100:19 - as fully fleshed out and so this having
100:25 - that open is great I mean this open this
100:28 - open I can close this this is the thing
100:38 - that I'm gonna this is the window for
100:39 - what I mean a code I can close
100:42 - this I can close this okay so Simon's
100:49 - saying the sound is layering over itself
100:51 - many times so just to confirm if i
100:57 - refresh this page is easy hello to Z
101:01 - it's normal
101:02 - read the chat hold on the audio is
101:04 - coming from two sources now well because
101:08 - you're hearing it through my microphone
101:10 - also yeah I can't really the problem is
101:15 - I can make this quieter Lauro to Z
101:17 - alright have an idea I kind of need to
101:23 - be able to hear it otherwise I don't
101:25 - know what's going on but I can change
101:27 - this volume hello Josie hello Josie so
101:34 - that's probably not so bad hello Josie
101:39 - once I lowered the volume of my laptop
101:42 - hello Josie is it okay yeah all right I
101:47 - don't want to make it a little bit
101:49 - louder because I can barely hear a Z so
101:51 - let me just try to make it a little bit
101:52 - louder let me just put it to the middle
102:01 - tell me if it's okay hello Josie hello
102:09 - Josie is this hello okay do I need to
102:12 - turn it back down not bad okay I could
102:25 - use headphones but that would be such a
102:27 - like complicated nightmare
102:32 - hey sean is in the chat already talked
102:35 - about ima John ok I already mentioned
102:37 - ima alright I'm just reading the slack
102:43 - channel where I know people are vaguely
102:46 - trustworthy there alright let's see ok
102:49 - so now I'm going to talk about the
102:54 - ability lab or the ability project
102:56 - I feel like it's called the ability
102:57 - project now yeah so I need to say
102:59 - ability project okay
103:04 - and Luke dupois all right so first let
103:08 - me say something about this before I go
103:10 - so I'm gonna do a tutorial where I talk
103:13 - about what this library is and who made
103:15 - it and show the basic features of it so
103:19 - there'll be three videos I don't
103:21 - hopefully I can do all this before I go
103:23 - one is just the basics for getting the
103:25 - browser to talk to you two is the basics
103:28 - for getting the browser to listen to you
103:30 - and say back but now now stay back
103:34 - listen to you and like recognize and
103:36 - convert it into text so text-to-speech
103:38 - and speech-to-text those are two videos
103:40 - the third one is I kind of want to make
103:42 - that into maybe I'll do the knock-knock
103:44 - joke thing I'll do a little chat bot
103:46 - knock-knock joke thing where it where
103:49 - you do it through voice so that's what
103:52 - I'm gonna do before I get there so this
103:54 - library is here in github it's under IDM
103:58 - which actually is another wonderful
104:00 - program at NYU called integrated digital
104:02 - media it's part of the Tandon school for
104:04 - engineering Luke Du Bois who was a
104:07 - wonderful artist I encourage you to
104:09 - check out his work is also is a
104:14 - professor there actually a director of
104:16 - the IDM program and created this library
104:18 - p5 speech and it is just a extension of
104:22 - the web speech like what comes I believe
104:24 - this so this I think you need to use in
104:26 - Chrome or if you use it a different
104:28 - browser you're sort of I think you're
104:30 - reliant on what the what the what the
104:33 - browser what the browser gives you so
104:38 - but what I wanted to say is this is part
104:40 - of a wonderful research group at NYU
104:43 - called the ability project and I guess
104:45 - they're the ability project is an
104:47 - interdisciplinary research space
104:48 - dedicated to the intersection between
104:50 - disability and technology so um you
104:53 - could imagine why speech detects insects
104:55 - text-to-speech is useful so I'm gonna
104:58 - say this again when I record the video
105:01 - that'll get edited later but the thing
105:03 - that I wanted to mention here is that
105:05 - this library is pretty new
105:07 - Luke implemented it I with the help of
105:10 - me I am so me recently just like changed
105:16 - some syntax stuff to make it a bit more
105:18 - a bit with the p5.js style but I this
105:21 - library could use probably some help I
105:22 - think there's some issues filed maybe
105:24 - you'll find some bugs if you're using it
105:26 - would love people to help contribute to
105:28 - this library I won't mention that I mean
105:30 - I'm and in particular something that we
105:32 - could use help with is that I updated
105:34 - those syntax and that's what I'm gonna
105:36 - use in the tutorial but I didn't take
105:40 - the time yet to update these examples
105:43 - with my new naming and syntax and update
105:47 - this documentation so if anybody wants
105:49 - to help with that it probably could use
105:50 - a little more thought in terms of the
105:52 - naming and the API could even be
105:54 - improved further but I want at least do
105:55 - a round of that before I made the videos
105:56 - so anyone who's interested in that
106:00 - please please participate and contribute
106:05 - to that okay okay I should check the
106:08 - paper clips right it's okay to check the
106:11 - paper clips now what could get marking
106:14 - level 200 I need to auto by I need to
106:19 - get that auto wire buying thing so could
106:23 - I possibly get up to what do I need to
106:25 - get 34,000 can we wait till I get to
106:27 - 34,000 we're making paper clips
106:36 - today paper clips today yes we're in the
106:40 - factory
106:43 - 33 thousand paper clips
106:46 - [Music]
106:53 - no that's a wire buyer 7,000 I just need
106:57 - 7,000 and I just need to get the 34,000
107:00 - so oh no 55,000 clips why didn't I think
107:03 - 34,000 I mean I could optimize the auto
107:08 - clip let me just buy a lot I have got I
107:10 - can buy a lot I'm gonna just fill up on
107:13 - wire he's all my money on wire then I'm
107:17 - gonna make my auto Clippers even better
107:19 - oh I get more trust
107:22 - there we go that's all I needed I get to
107:25 - trust the processor now you got to get
107:29 - to 7,000 there's no end to this you have
107:32 - no idea how far along I am on this other
107:34 - computer and yet here I am starting
107:36 - again I'll never be able to close this
107:38 - browser window ever it's more truss get
107:43 - some more processors to get up to 7,000
107:45 - how am I doing here four dollars four
107:47 - dollars per second that's pretty good
107:49 - inventory it looks kind of stable buy
107:54 - somewhere owner Clippers buy some more
107:55 - wire okay fine we've got to go do this
108:00 - tutorial I'll come back I'll get that in
108:03 - a second okay
108:11 - okay here we go alright so this video is
108:23 - going to go it's like ten point three or
108:26 - whatever in my chatbot series hello I am
108:32 - here again in my chat pot series I'm
108:34 - going to do two tutorials and then some
108:36 - other stuff about something called p5.js
108:38 - speech so I'm gonna get to what that is
108:40 - in a second but the reason why I'm doing
108:41 - this is as part of the chatbot series I
108:44 - want to investigate chatbots
108:47 - that a human can interact with by typing
108:50 - and chatbots that a human can interact
108:52 - with by speaking and so in order to do
108:54 - the speaking part without purchasing
108:57 - some kind of proprietary device from
108:59 - some company that's supposed to be your
109:02 - assistant or something like that all
109:04 - right which I will look at later
109:05 - eventually I want to see if we can do
109:07 - this in a bit more of an open-source way
109:09 - we looked at rive script can we just can
109:13 - we converse can we talk to the browser
109:14 - the web browser have it listened to what
109:16 - we're saying and talk back to us and the
109:18 - answer is yes and so there's a library
109:20 - for p5.js which is which was created by
109:23 - Luke Du Bois from the integrated digital
109:25 - media program at New York University
109:28 - standard school for engineering the
109:29 - ability project is part of the ability
109:31 - projects research which is an
109:32 - interdisciplinary research space then it
109:34 - came to the intersection between
109:35 - disability and technologies so it's a
109:37 - great program it's great research group
109:39 - you can you can imagine why speech to
109:42 - text and text to speech could be useful
109:44 - in this area for for for accessibility
109:49 - of different tools that exist on the
109:51 - Internet okay so there which is a really
109:52 - important topic so but I mean this video
109:55 - just want to kind of learn how the
109:56 - library works and kind of do a few
109:58 - playful things with it so this is the
110:00 - web page for the library I recently made
110:02 - some changes to the API the naming
110:04 - convention of some of these functions
110:06 - and so who what's it what's here right
110:09 - now might actually be different than
110:10 - what you see when you go to this page
110:11 - but so I'm going to use this new naming
110:13 - oh and this is a demonstration but I'll
110:15 - come back to that all right so let's
110:16 - just let's first look at how easy this
110:18 - is to use which I think it is it is it's
110:20 - easy it's gonna be easy and I just
110:23 - realized
110:24 - I'm gonna pause for a second because
110:26 - what I want to do is grab the library
110:30 - [Music]
110:33 - separate file desktop oops
110:37 - chat bot speech one library's so so the
110:51 - first thing that you want to going to
110:52 - want to do is actually download the job
110:55 - the library from github itself and I
110:57 - will provide in this video's description
110:58 - a link to where you can download that
111:00 - javascript file you can see that I've
111:02 - downloaded is here already and it's part
111:04 - of my project now how you end up
111:06 - incorporating this library into your
111:09 - example it can be different depending on
111:10 - what text editor or development
111:12 - environment you're using and hopefully I
111:14 - can help you with that
111:14 - but for the way that I'm working right
111:16 - here is I just have all the people I've
111:17 - just libraries and I'm adding p5 speech
111:20 - KS and I've got to make sure all so then
111:22 - I go to my sorry I go to my index.html
111:28 - file associated with that this sketch
111:30 - and go right here copy paste this and
111:34 - I'm just gonna add a reference to p5
111:36 - speech touch ass so let's even see if
111:38 - that does anything we go back to the
111:41 - browser hit refresh okay
111:44 - nothing but at least I'm not I don't get
111:45 - I'd not having an error so what's the
111:47 - what's the basic sorry let me look at
111:53 - the most okay let me look at the most
111:56 - basic thing I can do with p5 speech and
112:00 - if I go to the get up try the Kip sorry
112:03 - let me open up this computer that keeps
112:05 - going to sleep let me look at the most
112:12 - basic thing that you can do with the
112:14 - speech library which is just have the
112:16 - browser speak so if I go to the github
112:18 - page and I look down here this is kind
112:21 - of just a little bit of code so I'm
112:22 - gonna grab this I'm gonna go to my
112:26 - sketch KS in setup I'm going to add and
112:30 - I'm gonna change this to let and I'm
112:32 - gonna say have it's a coding train so
112:36 - what I need to do and I think
112:38 - is gonna be okay there's the there's a
112:41 - bunch of a variety of issues that I'm
112:42 - going to show you and things that you
112:43 - could do but just just for the basic
112:45 - idea I need to create a p5 speech object
112:49 - voice equals new P v dot speech and I
112:52 - just need to call voice dot speak let's
112:54 - just see if this works
112:55 - ah this is something I'm gonna show you
112:59 - in a minute
113:00 - coding train did you hear that coding
113:03 - train it speaks to me okay so that's
113:07 - basically it so one of the nice things
113:09 - is I'm done like if I have some text you
113:12 - know I could have a whole interactive
113:13 - system when I click the mouse or I do
113:15 - this button or whatever and it's then it
113:16 - speaks it doesn't speak it could say
113:18 - anything the text could be generative it
113:19 - could use any of my you know weird crazy
113:21 - like generate poetry examples but there
113:25 - the reason why I this not gonna just end
113:27 - this video right now is the library
113:29 - actually provides a bunch of other
113:31 - features now these features are
113:33 - dependent on the web speech API and if I
113:36 - understand it correctly you're kind of
113:39 - limited to what the browser supports so
113:41 - which voices are available does it
113:43 - actually work so I'm doing this all in
113:45 - Chrome on a Mac and I imagine some of
113:47 - you might try this in different browsers
113:48 - a different operating systems so let me
113:50 - know what works and what doesn't work
113:51 - maybe we can contribute to the library
113:53 - if it doesn't work in a certain browser
113:55 - to help it work but again the browser
113:56 - has to support the web speech feature
113:59 - and okay but one of the things you can
114:02 - do is actually change the voice so let's
114:05 - let's look at how I might do that so I
114:08 - think I can say something like
114:11 - console.log voice dot voices so in this
114:15 - voice object I probably I'll call this
114:17 - speech just to be less confusing there
114:21 - is a property which is a list of all of
114:23 - the different voices that are supportive
114:26 - so let's hit refresh and look at this of
114:29 - poises not defined
114:31 - all right speech coding trainer but look
114:35 - it's empty
114:36 - so here's the thing you don't have to
114:38 - wait for it to be ready if all you want
114:42 - to do is use the default voice but if
114:44 - you want to try a different voice you
114:46 - need a callback a vend callback that
114:48 - says like hey i've loaded all the other
114:51 - possible
114:51 - and the way that you do that is by
114:53 - passing in an argument to the new p5
114:56 - speech constructor I can say something
114:58 - like voice ready then I can write a
115:02 - function called voice ready and in that
115:07 - function I can console.log speech type
115:11 - voices I think this is gonna work
115:13 - coding train so now we can see this
115:16 - whole list of voices and witty what
115:19 - there's a lot of them like there's 82 of
115:21 - them and what's one that I might want to
115:22 - be interested in look they all have
115:24 - names so we could look here and the name
115:27 - is actually important it's the key word
115:30 - you can use to assign a different voice
115:31 - I happen to know there's one called
115:33 - cellos I think so one thing I want to
115:36 - just add here is I'm just gonna add the
115:37 - mouse pressed function and in the mouse
115:42 - press function I'm going to say speech
115:45 - speak coating train so let's just make
115:48 - sure this works
115:49 - oops ah so I need to make speech a
115:52 - global variable let speech timeout
116:08 - now we need to make speech global
116:10 - variable it did that hit refresh coding
116:14 - train coding train coding trains but
116:17 - every time I click the mouse it speaks
116:18 - but in theory now I should be able to
116:21 - say let's just try assigning a voice
116:24 - speech dot voice that's what was the one
116:30 - I just looked at was called Moira let's
116:32 - let's look at in a different random one
116:34 - Alice let's try Alice now I don't know
116:38 - if this is right let's see if this is
116:39 - right I don't remember their speech that
116:44 - voice is not a function pause I forget
116:48 - what it is but look at my example which
116:52 - I forgot cuz I don't remember the naming
116:55 - of the functions normally I would just
116:57 - go and look in the reference but I
116:59 - didn't speak set voice that's a much
117:05 - better name so it's not voice I should
117:12 - remember this it's set voice I could say
117:15 - set voice Alice clothing today clothing
117:19 - today so there's Alice one of my
117:21 - favorites I think it's called cellos I'm
117:29 - sorry
117:30 - three beings are weird I can barely hear
117:34 - that voice but it makes me want to do
117:36 - something when I hear at the cellos um
117:38 - so let's just do something one thing I
117:40 - could emphasize here is if these are the
117:42 - voices I could say let voices equal
117:46 - speech voices then I could say let voice
117:51 - equal random voices so the random
117:54 - function in p5 will pick a random
117:56 - element from the array and I could do
117:57 - set voice I could probably actually just
117:59 - say set voice the voice or set
118:01 - voiced/unvoiced name let's see if it
118:03 - works with just that voice object so I'm
118:05 - going to say console.log voice name so
118:09 - now we'll get a random on each time
118:12 - coding train coding train coding train
118:16 - noting train it's the same voice so I
118:18 - think we might actually have to say set
118:20 - voice
118:21 - voice that name-calling train codes in
118:29 - plain gold ink so now you can hear all
118:33 - the different speech that all the
118:35 - different voices I'm not going through
118:37 - all them but I'm just picking a random
118:38 - one each time all right what are some
118:40 - other things you might want to do well
118:43 - let me add a canvas here this is like
118:45 - that's really useful create canvas let's
118:48 - say 400 comma 100 and what I want to do
118:51 - is I want to display some information
118:54 - like I want to animate something when
118:56 - this when the browser is speaking and
118:58 - not animate when it's not speaking so
119:00 - there are some callbacks if I could just
119:02 - remember what they are
119:03 - speech dot start did maybe start
119:10 - speaking and speech dot ended and ended
119:17 - and speaking I think these are so this
119:20 - is just like with the Dom library if
119:22 - we've used the p5 Dom library where you
119:24 - have like a slider or a button and if
119:26 - you have a callback that you assigned if
119:28 - you press on the button or if you move
119:30 - the slider I'm now assigning a callback
119:32 - and I might have gotten these names
119:33 - wrong I'm gonna fix them if I got them
119:35 - wrong but I'm assigning a callback to
119:37 - when when the browser starts speaking
119:40 - and when it ends speaking and so this
119:41 - means I need to write these functions so
119:43 - I could say start speaking background
119:47 - green and then function and speaking
119:52 - that and this is I'm not doing anything
119:54 - sophisticated in terms of the draw loop
119:56 - or any animation but you could imagine
119:57 - doing something background 0 and let's
120:00 - say background zero when it starts so
120:03 - now if I load the page building frame oh
120:06 - yeah it's working
120:07 - I have this whatever so that canvas
120:17 - turns green whenever the voice is
120:19 - speaking so that's a useful thing you
120:21 - can do and the other thing you can do
120:22 - which is kind of nice is you can change
120:25 - three things the rate the pitch and the
120:30 - volume and I believe
120:35 - so I believe it's like set volume so if
120:37 - I made it like point one it should be
120:38 - very quiet set rate so let's let's
120:43 - actually let's just so volume you can
120:45 - imagine I believe the range is between
120:47 - zero and one it might be something else
120:49 - but we could look that up or experiment
120:51 - with it but let's forget about the
120:52 - volume for a second because I want you
120:53 - to be able to hear it
120:54 - let's try it set rate and what I'm gonna
120:56 - do now is not give it a random voice
120:59 - anymore because I want it to be able to
121:01 - recognize what it's doing so let's take
121:03 - out the set voice so it's gonna be the
121:05 - default voice now oops
121:07 - set rate is not a function timeout so
121:13 - what is it
121:14 - Oh set rate is a function set rates the
121:18 - fonts are pitch Oh set rate is not my
121:26 - naming is a bit confusing set rate is
121:29 - something that you assigned to the
121:30 - speech object itself the voice is the
121:33 - you know each voice doesn't have its own
121:35 - rate it's the rate that it's currently
121:37 - gonna speak with that voice so I'm just
121:38 - doing this wrong because I this should
121:40 - be speech set rate tota trainer Tony
121:44 - trainer so you hear that twice as fast
121:46 - right and if I were to say 0.5 coding
121:51 - train coding train it's much slower and
121:54 - then I could also I can also say speech
121:56 - dot set pitch I don't know what the
121:59 - range is for this I should I'm gonna
122:01 - just say 5 just to see anyway so you get
122:13 - the idea let's put this the rate back to
122:15 - 1 and put the pitch to like 0.2 coding
122:19 - training coding training Oh coding
122:24 - training I wonder if I need to give it a
122:26 - negative number coding training coding
122:31 - train so I'm trying to make the pitch
122:33 - lower Kodu tree yeah that's definitely
122:39 - higher coda tree so I wonder and one
122:43 - would be the default I say right coding
122:44 - training coding train
122:48 - I don't know how to make it lower
122:50 - timeout a second look anybody know I'm
122:57 - looking in the slack channel here set
122:59 - volume set rates that Leto set Lang set
123:05 - voice voice doesn't seem to use anything
123:10 - from oh but there's a list voices
123:12 - function shy I probably should have used
123:14 - that so that's good to a fraction
123:18 - try-try decimals right because it might
123:22 - demo I'm pretty sure let me look at this
123:25 - for a second hello Josie this is my demo
123:31 - hello coding train hello coding training
123:35 - oh hello coding training it is lower
123:39 - it's just I'm not slowing it down at
123:41 - hello coding train so yeah I think it is
123:47 - lower I'm just not really noticing it
123:48 - maybe it'll be more obvious with a local
123:50 - ding thing yeah but the difference in
123:53 - the coding train
123:54 - yeah with a different coding thing yeah
123:58 - so let me let me do the cellos voice see
124:02 - if that works well alright let's double
124:17 - back quite a bit Matt yeah when we edit
124:20 - this because I was like testing stuff
124:22 - quite a bit we'll just go to the pitch
124:29 - so I think what's happening here is this
124:31 - particular voice it's sort of hard to
124:33 - pick up the lower pitch so one thing I
124:36 - could do is just try let's assign a
124:40 - specific voice let's try that voice
124:42 - Alice and let's listen to that whoops
124:48 - I'm the wrong and let's listen to that
124:52 - clothing today coding today and now let
124:56 - me set the pitch to lower good evening
124:59 - yeah this voice you can hear it a bit
125:02 - it's a bit more obvious just with this
125:03 - voice no that's a higher pitch
125:06 - so set pitch set rate those are things
125:09 - you can play play with I just realized
125:11 - by the way that I believe if I say
125:15 - speech dot list voices that's a function
125:19 - which will actually just give me an
125:21 - array with all the voice names so this
125:23 - actually would have been a little bit
125:24 - more useful like if I say list voices
125:26 - and then I don't need this extra voice
125:29 - dot name thing and I can just say voice
125:34 - so now I could just pick around I don't
125:36 - need all the other aspects of the voice
125:38 - the full voice object I just want the
125:39 - list of all the names and I'm gonna take
125:41 - this out and let's just see now we're
125:43 - back to coding train coding train oh I'm
125:47 - whoops
125:50 - coding train coding train
125:53 - well what happened what's happening here
126:00 - what just happened here coding train
126:03 - whoa
126:04 - am I like editing the wrong sketch why
126:07 - is it printing everything out
126:15 - start speaking and speaking voice ready
126:24 - coding training 20 slide 2600 this is
126:31 - not I did something wrong
126:39 - coding training waitlist voices is it
126:44 - just I thought that what did I say
126:54 - Oh oh it just lists them in the console
126:57 - it doesn't actually return the array so
127:01 - nevermind forget that whole thing I mean
127:03 - that might be a nice thing to probably
127:04 - make sense to adjust the library to
127:06 - return the array that's just doing a
127:08 - fingerprint to the console I didn't
127:09 - realize that so scratch that whole
127:11 - little like spiel I gave and let's just
127:22 - and I don't need a second it is a little
127:25 - silly that I made this like separate
127:26 - variable whatever okay sorry oh where
127:29 - was I sorry to scratch that whole part
127:34 - coding trainer so let me put it back to
127:39 - where it picks a random voice and sorry
127:43 - hold on this was commented up so let me
127:50 - put it back to where it says a random
127:52 - voice so now the code this is the code
127:54 - that I'll release a different different
127:58 - voice each time but I want to show you I
128:00 - have another example that I'll link to
128:01 - which actually sorry pause why did I
128:07 - close it
128:09 - lol chazzy
128:16 - I have another example that I will link
128:20 - to as well which just has a bit more so
128:23 - this is an example I'm not gonna go
128:24 - through coding all this but as an
128:25 - exercise this might be something you try
128:27 - this is an example that takes all of
128:29 - those voice names and puts them in a
128:31 - drop-down menu so I could pick bells I
128:36 - can you know I can change the rate I can
128:44 - change the pitch this one is a weird one
128:51 - it's catching up I press the button to
128:54 - any time so the cue of its speaking I
128:55 - kind of so anyway so I encourage you to
128:57 - check out the code that drives this
128:59 - particular demo there's some other
129:01 - examples that are part of the p5.js
129:03 - github repository I mean p5 jest speech
129:05 - get a repository as well so see what you
129:07 - can make make something that talks to
129:09 - you in the browser and let me know how
129:11 - it is in the next video I'm going to do
129:12 - is have the browser listen to what I'm
129:14 - saying
129:15 - and print out in the browser itself what
129:18 - I'm saying okay so this was
129:21 - text-to-speech right and I want to do
129:24 - speech to text in the next video thanks
129:25 - for watching alright so what did I miss
129:34 - [Music]
129:36 - Oh point oh one two two thank you for
129:41 - clarifying that stuff for me alright
129:42 - where are we five fifteen I won't try to
129:45 - get this so I definitely want to do that
129:47 - now let's check the check the paper
129:49 - clips alright I can get the wire buyer
129:53 - which I definitely need so now at least
129:56 - it'll by wire I have so much more I can
130:00 - get more memory and a little bit more
130:02 - processor oh I'm almost a quantum
130:05 - computing that's good and it needs some
130:08 - more auto clippers for sure I mean just
130:11 - oh I should get more marketing oh my god
130:14 - I have so much money
130:15 - more Clippers let's just like use up
130:20 - everything here and now five cents is
130:24 - still pretty good based on looks like
130:26 - this is kind of staying pretty even
130:27 - seven dollars per
130:29 - second if I lower the price it's more
130:32 - per second but that's gonna drain my
130:34 - inventory but I can just get more auto
130:36 - clippers
130:39 - I think I'll raise the price to five oh
130:43 - boy yeah it's like it's really really
130:48 - touch-and-go they're here like I want I
130:51 - need this to sort of balance out as
130:53 - having some extra inventory let's try
130:55 - this but now I'm not selling as much
130:59 - some more Auto Clippers just like a
131:01 - couple more Oh
131:02 - let's double the marketing effectiveness
131:03 - that's that's a look at that that was
131:06 - good but now I really just need to make
131:08 - more stuff let's raise the price again
131:12 - let's do it ten cents eleven cents
131:16 - twelve cents okay I need some more Auto
131:21 - Clippers okay I'm gonna have to leave
131:23 - this gonna have to leave this where are
131:25 - we 154,000 okay let's go back to a
131:27 - speech-to-text all right that's pretty
131:29 - good oh hello are you were still
131:31 - watching are you still there is the
131:33 - could you possibly still be there 200k
131:37 - all right all right where's my water you
131:41 - know what the problem is I'm not staying
131:42 - hydrated so I need to do p5
131:47 - text-to-speech let's do that so let me
131:55 - get the demo of that and see if that's
131:59 - working this is kind of interfere
132:02 - interfering pattern okay let's go here
132:10 - hello how are you
132:19 - are you listening to me one two three
132:30 - test four five six
132:34 - hello mmm what am I doing wrong that I'm
132:39 - not getting
132:41 - did I turn the continuous thing off so
132:44 - hold on we've got a little bit of an
132:46 - issue here did I break something in the
132:49 - library continuous true I want that not
132:53 - one time only I don't want to use the
132:57 - interim results is this not actually
133:00 - setting hold on did I mess something up
133:04 - in the library where it's not actually
133:09 - doing it oh look at this
133:11 - so I messed up something in the library
133:14 - so there's probably a bug in the library
133:16 - that we're gonna have to pull request
133:17 - but I should be able to fix this now
133:19 - it's my fault because I made changes to
133:23 - the library and what I'm looking for now
133:26 - I'm gonna fix the library Oh call back
133:29 - no wait so where's the okay hold on set
133:34 - what was that function called where am I
133:39 - here right no I want to go to this one
133:42 - I'm looking at start the start function
133:47 - Oh where's so let's look for start
134:00 - there it goes oh I could have sworn I
134:09 - don't know I must have messed this up
134:11 - but this is the definition for the start
134:14 - function and what I want is continuous
134:17 - and interim results and like I want
134:24 - instead of having it be variables that
134:26 - you said I thought the function could
134:28 - just set the values let me just do this
134:37 - right now and have to think about a
134:39 - better way to put this into the library
134:41 - but hopefully this will fix this
134:45 - hello one two three four
134:51 - hey great alright so this is working now
134:59 - it's what I'm not doing
135:00 - I don't have I have continuous on but
135:03 - not interim results so weirdly it's not
135:05 - gonna do the speech of text until I
135:06 - pause but it listened to everything I
135:12 - said and waited till I pause which which
135:14 - is pretty good well I'm quite impressed
135:16 - with how well this works all right so
135:20 - now we need to make this example
135:22 - basically so which is a pretty simple
135:26 - example to make but I need to also so
135:29 - we're gonna have to me I am semi if
135:31 - you're watching maybe you can help me
135:33 - figure out to pull request to the
135:36 - library because I broke the library or
135:38 - somebody watching could just pull
135:40 - request to it already
135:42 - but I think the reason why I'm not so
135:44 - sure it's like it's possible let me if
135:46 - you guys don't mind humoring me for a
135:48 - second I'm going to so in theory there
135:52 - are also these instance variables which
135:56 - should get set to these values and they
136:05 - should have a default can I like can I
136:07 - do that if it's not es6 so I'm going to
136:10 - do
136:11 - continuous sort of silly or false I
136:15 - don't know I don't know the best way to
136:17 - write this so I think the default should
136:20 - be I mean maybe the default should be
136:22 - true right when do you only want to get
136:25 - one thing I don't know but the interim
136:28 - results this should be the default
136:35 - definitely be false and then I can so
136:38 - that let me just make sure this still
136:39 - works
136:40 - I messed something up sketched a chest
136:45 - line 18 Oh
136:46 - continuous is not defined okay 1 2 3
136:54 - test 4 5 6 test coding rainbow coding
137:07 - rainbow alright
137:12 - I'm great so I think it's gonna just
137:15 - keep listening to me no matter what I
137:17 - say so anybody watching this who feels
137:23 - like contributing to the library and at
137:24 - least at a minimum needs this fix but I
137:27 - have to think through whether this is
137:28 - the correct fix let's see here so now I
137:34 - need to do is copy paste this into this
137:37 - is my demo that I need to reference I
137:41 - can close and I need to go into speech
137:44 - oh no I need to make another example oh
137:47 - boy too many things are doing here
137:49 - speech 1
137:56 - speech recognition let's just do that
138:01 - this is speech speech to speech
138:08 - speak and what I need to do is cop close
138:15 - everything because I messed everything
138:17 - up don't save and what I want to do is
138:22 - work on this sketch and I need to go to
138:28 - my example code in case I need to
138:31 - reference something so shut that open
138:34 - and this open and then I also need to
138:38 - take this fixed version of the p5.js
138:41 - library and where do I want to put that
138:44 - I want to put that in the example that
138:49 - I'm building now in libraries here okay
138:55 - I think I'm okay I think I've done
138:57 - everything that I meant to do save close
139:00 - so this is my reference this is that
139:02 - what I'm gonna make okay so I need to
139:05 - get rid of everything here
139:20 - and let me look at this code just so I
139:25 - remember so I make a new piece I've
139:27 - speech recognition object give it a
139:30 - callback then I sell it to start with
139:33 - the properties that I want and then I
139:35 - just used the callback and we can
139:37 - investigate what's in there okay great
139:39 - this is going to be really easy actually
139:40 - this is gonna be a pretty short video I
139:43 - almost don't need that but I'm gonna
139:45 - leave it there to reference and then I
139:46 - need to go back to the browser and go to
139:50 - here and we're good
139:52 - all right everybody you guys with me let
139:54 - me check the chat oh yeah
140:00 - Tim this buddy had a great point I did
140:02 - the worst thing ever
140:03 - okay I did a terrible terrible thing so
140:07 - my fix for the library is horrific
140:10 - so let me at least not do that right now
140:14 - it should only be if it's undefined so
140:18 - let me fix this this is worth looking at
140:22 - right now so so this is terrible because
140:28 - if I pass in false because I want
140:31 - continuous to be false that's good about
140:33 - to false it's gonna set it to true so
140:36 - that this really doesn't work I need to
140:37 - say if couldn't continuous equals
140:44 - undefined
140:45 - that's if I didn't give it an argument
140:48 - then I could set continuous if I wanted
140:53 - to make the default true maybe the
140:54 - default should be false and then this
141:00 - dot continuous would not would just be
141:07 - this right this should fix it again I'm
141:10 - not suggesting this is the most elegant
141:11 - solution but this should be if you
141:13 - didn't bother to define it then set it
141:16 - to true otherwise if you defined it as
141:19 - false it will be false okay I think that
141:21 - should fix it I'm just gonna kind of
141:23 - hope that I did this correctly why is it
141:25 - so cuz I was looking for or okay
141:34 - oh yeah alkis giving me a a better way
141:39 - to write it so why why while I'm here
141:45 - I'm gonna do I'm gonna do that so this
141:52 - is another way to write it
141:54 - I'm gonna thank you to Alka in the chat
141:57 - with Doc continuous equals continuous
142:02 - beep undefined oh my god
142:06 - true oh I can't bear it : continuous
142:10 - commented out because I might have
142:12 - gotten it wrong and I'll come back to
142:14 - looking at that later
142:15 - so the what's that what that operator
142:16 - called the question mark oh I am trying
142:21 - to use es6 but the p5.js project hasn't
142:24 - like fully adopted es6 yet so the
142:26 - libraries are often written with
142:27 - previous to es6 syntax so while I'm
142:30 - working on this library I'm just keeping
142:32 - with es5 stuff all right well let's make
142:34 - this let's make this project a little
142:37 - worried that the I'm gonna just turn the
142:39 - camera on and off so it doesn't do it in
142:40 - the middle
142:49 - and I'm going to you I'm gonna have my I
142:57 - might as well have the example running
143:00 - while I'm talking cuz it'll be kind of
143:02 - interesting whoops
143:14 - hello and welcome to a video about I put
143:22 - the mouse in front about speech to text
143:25 - or speech recognition so this is part 2
143:27 - the previous video I okay I'm gonna stop
143:33 - waiting for it now in the previous video
143:35 - I looked at how to take text and have
143:37 - the browser speak it with a variety of
143:39 - different voices using the p5 speech
143:41 - library which is built on top of the web
143:42 - speech API in this video I'm going to
143:45 - look at the p5 speech library but
143:47 - text-to-speech or speak recognition
143:49 - which is actually quite an easy thing to
143:51 - do with the library now how you work out
143:53 - the interaction and how it works that's
143:55 - a the design is a the design problem is
143:58 - hard but that technically getting the
144:00 - library to work is pretty easy alright
144:05 - so I'm basically gonna this is an
144:07 - example running I'm going to try to
144:08 - build this example from scratch to look
144:09 - at how this works and I'm going to close
144:11 - this window around so this is an empty
144:13 - sketch right now and the first thing I
144:15 - want to do is create I'll make it a
144:17 - global variable a speech recognition I'm
144:22 - just gonna call it speech rec so I'm
144:24 - gonna create a variable called speech
144:25 - rec for speech recognition and I'm gonna
144:28 - say speech rec equals new p v dot speech
144:32 - rec so that's the name of the object
144:34 - that's built into library I've already
144:36 - downloaded an import of the library to
144:38 - this project I talked about how to do
144:40 - that in the previous video so the
144:42 - library is already available to me the
144:43 - p5 Jess speech library now let me run so
144:46 - ok no errors I'm refreshing the page no
144:49 - errors so here's the thing when when
144:54 - what we need a callback there's an event
144:56 - so whenever the speech recognition
144:57 - object has decided its listen to what
145:00 - you've said and knows what it is it's
145:03 - going to trigger an event just like a
145:04 - mousepressed event or a mouse-over event
145:06 - so i'm going to call that event got
145:08 - speech and I'm gonna write a function
145:10 - got speech I'm gonna give it an argument
145:15 - and I'm just gonna say console.log so
145:18 - the idea here is that this function will
145:22 - will trigger it will run every time
145:25 - speech library things okay I heard what
145:27 - you said I've got it into text let me
145:29 - give it to you and I just want to put it
145:31 - into the console right now I do need one
145:33 - more line of code though I need to
145:34 - explicitly say I want the speech
145:36 - recognizer to start and so here speech
145:40 - recognizer start now if I just call dot
145:44 - start it's gonna start with some default
145:46 - settings but there's two important
145:48 - settings that I want to mention to you
145:49 - one is called continuous I'm gonna make
145:52 - that true and one is called interim
145:55 - results I'm just making up variables
145:57 - just to store the values true and false
145:59 - I could just write true and false right
146:01 - into the start function but naming them
146:03 - so we know what they are continuous
146:05 - means that without continuous it's just
146:07 - gonna listen to your speech one time at
146:09 - one time only and then it's gonna be
146:11 - done if you want to listen to somebody
146:13 - over time you want continuous to be true
146:15 - which is what I want and interim results
146:18 - is the funny thing and it's I haven't
146:19 - fully figured out how to get this
146:21 - behavior to work really well but you'll
146:23 - notice when I was demoing it before it
146:26 - would waited until I paused before it
146:28 - gave me what it recognized if I set
146:30 - interim results to true it's gonna try
146:32 - just keep giving me information as I'm
146:34 - speaking so we'll try it with true in a
146:36 - minute but let's leave that as false and
146:37 - these are by the way at the moment the
146:40 - libraries default settings although that
146:42 - could change I suppose if the library
146:44 - API changes okay so this is kind of all
146:47 - the code Redeem easiest coding tutorial
146:50 - video ever we have to see if this works
146:52 - now one thing is again you need to have
146:54 - a browser that supports the web speech
146:57 - API is probably gonna work immediately
147:00 - for me but if you put this on a web page
147:01 - or if you use it in different contexts
147:03 - it's going to ask for your microphone
147:05 - and you probably that also probably
147:07 - means it has to be on a secure website
147:08 - one that's hosted with HTTPS so there's
147:11 - a bunch of like security all sorts of
147:13 - requirements here I'm kind of bypassing
147:14 - that as I know it's just gonna work in
147:16 - the environment that I've set it up at
147:17 - least I hope it's gonna work
147:18 - so now let me hit refresh oh uncaught
147:22 - reference continuous is not defined
147:24 - I cannot spell the word continuous
147:26 - continuous continuous oh wait first of
147:33 - the steak of the p5 library if you guys
147:36 - speech library because before I recorded
147:38 - this video I was messing
147:39 - and I just made a mistake so I'm gonna
147:41 - disappear and come back in a second
147:47 - seriously I corrected it with the wrong
147:49 - I still have a spelling error can't in
147:56 - u.s.
148:09 - I'm back and I fixed that error and one
148:13 - thing you'll notice is now this red
148:15 - light is flashing up here this is
148:16 - something that Chrome will do to let you
148:19 - know that it is listening that the
148:21 - microphone is on so the microphone is on
148:23 - and let's say I've been talking for a
148:25 - little while this open let me just pause
148:27 - it's very hard for me to stop speaking
148:29 - sometimes but I'm going to stop right
148:31 - now
148:34 - so this thing appeared here in the
148:36 - console what appeared in the console
148:38 - it's this this object there's a whole
148:40 - object there what's in the object let's
148:43 - look at it it's got a confidence score
148:46 - this is really good how sure is it that
148:49 - it figured out what you were saying
148:50 - accurately so 92 percent confidence
148:53 - that's good the highest would be 100%
148:54 - it's got success it's the success which
148:56 - is like did it work that could be true
148:58 - or false and it's got the text there
149:00 - also is this object called data which
149:02 - has lots of other information timestamp
149:05 - and all sorts of stuff that's coming
149:06 - from the browser but the the things that
149:08 - you really want or did it work what did
149:10 - I say and how confident are you and I
149:14 - got another one
149:15 - so let's let's do something right now
149:17 - let's just say create P speech dot txt
149:21 - so I just want to make a new paragraph
149:22 - element on the page with whatever and
149:24 - and if I want to be really sure about
149:26 - this I'm going to say if speech dot
149:27 - success so make sure that's true create
149:30 - P with speech text and now I'm gonna
149:35 - refresh the page hello
149:43 - unicorn nangou reindeers are better than
149:51 - people why don't that song in my head oh
149:58 - my goodness did you think that learning
150:04 - oh that's the old Sun I can't anyway the
150:05 - point is I think this is working I lost
150:07 - I got lost in my own thoughts and I'm
150:09 - like the computers talking to me I
150:15 - stopped working oh yeah
150:20 - so maybe it just didn't have success a
150:22 - couple times so you get the idea
150:23 - interesting interesting
150:24 - okay we're in good shape here you know
150:30 - what actually is happening when I look
150:31 - this way I think I'm kind of quieter
150:33 - than when looking at anybody okay let's
150:35 - try this was one more thing we refresh
150:37 - the page let's see what happens when we
150:40 - set interim results to true and see what
150:42 - happens just let's just see I am now
150:46 - attempting to get interim results oh it
150:51 - wasn't auto-scrolling so you can see now
150:53 - I'm making a new paragraph and so this
150:56 - is like it's continuously giving me more
150:58 - and more depth so this would be
151:01 - interesting like as it's like trying to
151:02 - interpret it whoa this is crazy
151:04 - so this is interesting to try you can
151:06 - see what that's not like losing my mind
151:07 - here it's the paragraphs aren't
151:10 - scrolling automatically and I am all
151:12 - working no play make Kody train dull
151:19 - it's behind so I'm gonna stop here so
151:23 - you can see this is the basic idea now
151:24 - you could probably do something much
151:26 - more creative with this in terms of how
151:29 - this fits into an interaction scenario
151:31 - but the core basic ideas are start
151:34 - listening and whenever it's recognized
151:36 - something you've got data back you've
151:38 - got confidence you've got the text and
151:40 - whether it worked and some more stuff
151:41 - too and how you display that information
151:43 - back to the user is your choice so I'm
151:46 - gonna do a coding challenge where I make
151:48 - a chat bot that listens to what I say
151:49 - and then replies with listen to what I
151:53 - say was speech-to-text
151:54 - and replies with text-to-speech and that
151:56 - will be
151:57 - in the next video in this playlist if
151:58 - you're in the program with text playlist
152:01 - see you soon
152:04 - paper clips why couldn't I remember that
152:06 - all right I don't know if I really have
152:09 - time to do this do you think I could do
152:10 - this coding challenge well I'm at 300
152:13 - let's let's work on the paper clips for
152:14 - a little more I could definitely get
152:19 - some more Auto Clippers here and I have
152:22 - so much unsold inventory and you lower
152:25 - the price 42 how much trust do I have 18
152:38 - all right all right
152:40 - oh I can start in a minute Beall start
152:43 - investing all right by the way it is
152:45 - just kind of nice to make these
152:48 - artisanal paper clips by clicking the
152:50 - button I saw that joke from somebody
152:52 - else okay do I have its 540 the American
153:04 - League Championship Series game does not
153:05 - start until 8 p.m. I would like to have
153:08 - dinner with my children do you need to
153:11 - get going I'm looking
153:15 - what's with the Capitals that's an
153:17 - interesting question yeah okay I miss
153:23 - dot text so before I move on I by the
153:27 - way I borrowed that our T's an old
153:29 - pay-per-click joke from somebody else on
153:31 - Twitter who made it that wasn't my joke
153:33 - but it was a good one so I had to borrow
153:36 - it
153:37 - oh boy I mean you gotta raise the price
153:40 - I need more Auto Clippers oh no I
153:43 - definitely need this 500 oh now now now
153:46 - we're cooking I just like I really I
153:51 - just want a big box of actual real paper
153:53 - clips right
154:00 - do the coding challenge then - I turn Oh
154:03 - Austin lost it that's a good point
154:06 - all right I'm never going to do this
154:07 - coding challenge so the question is kept
154:12 - me just can you do a video on using
154:14 - speech-to-text to do activities like
154:16 - your computer like play music Oh could I
154:23 - control the computer well this would be
154:25 - this is something you certainly could do
154:27 - but I'm limited to controlling the
154:28 - browser because I'm just living in
154:30 - JavaScript in the web page and the
154:31 - browser is not typically allowed to
154:33 - reach outside of it you know it's not
154:35 - like I could make a web page that I
154:36 - could suddenly delete files off of
154:37 - somebody's hard drive that would be a
154:38 - big security issue and in fact that's
154:40 - why you have to give permission to use
154:41 - the microphone or the camera that sort
154:43 - of thing so how am i doing balance wise
154:48 - here I need to raise the price a little
154:49 - bit I just need more Auto Clippers
154:50 - they're so expensive but now looks like
154:55 - my inventory is kind of balanced I do
154:58 - cobain ambrose says why does it Dan
155:00 - upload the live streams after I do so
155:03 - immediately after this is over the live
155:04 - stream is available it's often becomes
155:06 - an unlit by default it becomes an
155:07 - unlisted video so you might have to
155:09 - tweet at me or ask in the chat for the
155:11 - link and then once once I've had a
155:14 - chance with Matt Matt's help who helps
155:16 - me manage the channel to add time codes
155:19 - and description and a thumbnail make
155:21 - sure it's all kind of like set and there
155:22 - wasn't like a private email address in
155:24 - it by accident or something then I'll
155:25 - release it and make it public and that
155:27 - usually happens sometime over the
155:28 - weekend my phone is okay hold on I
155:33 - definitely want the trading engine ooh
155:35 - okay hold on we want some high-risk
155:38 - investments let's deposit some money
155:41 - just posit all our money and let's start
155:46 - investing okay my inventory is kind of
155:50 - going up our buyers on all right all
155:55 - right little let the investments go
155:57 - we're gonna come back to this so I think
156:02 - what I'm gonna do I mean I could just do
156:05 - the number so I just do the number
156:08 - guessing chatbot and just build
156:09 - that that will be easier because then I
156:13 - don't have to like design a knock-knock
156:14 - joke and this thing is still running I'm
156:16 - gonna turn this off so the let me let me
156:19 - at least start I think I should at least
156:21 - start from this chat bot code whoops
156:26 - that'll make things because I the
156:28 - previous let me just open up the
156:30 - previous coding challenge oops what am i
156:34 - doing oh my god
156:38 - chat bot - I made everything so huge oh
156:52 - you know what this gives me a chance to
156:55 - fix something that I messed up in the
156:57 - previous video so this was the this was
157:02 - the previous chat bot where then I would
157:06 - say five and let's say pick a higher
157:08 - number seven I got it so in a way I kind
157:13 - of want to just use this have I been
157:17 - here for three hours
157:19 - 3:45 no two hours right I've been here
157:23 - for about exciting start though I
157:24 - started at 3:00 3:15 two and a half
157:26 - hours it I just you know if you if you
157:32 - want if you want to assign the blame did
157:35 - I mention its Frank Lance
157:37 - Frank Lance let's think that first of
157:41 - all he loves Frank Lance who is Frank
157:43 - Lance you might be wondering
157:45 - speaking of Frank Lance is the director
157:50 - of the NYU game center runs the MFA
157:53 - program
157:54 - he is a game designer he made the
157:56 - perfect game to torture I pretty sure he
157:59 - made it to torture me specifically I
158:02 - mean in some ways my life has all this
158:05 - meaning now because at some point I will
158:07 - get to the end right I will have made
158:09 - all the paper clips that anyone could
158:10 - ever have made and then I will discover
158:14 - the true meaning of everything that is
158:16 - to be in life
158:17 - right right Frank Frank are you here all
158:25 - right how do you guys feel about me I
158:35 - think what I want to do is I just sort
158:39 - of think that knock-knock joke is maybe
158:40 - a little bit better of a chatbot so but
158:43 - I could do that so let me do that let me
158:45 - change the knock-knock joke I just want
158:47 - to remember because that's gonna be easy
158:50 - to change and then have it speak okay
158:54 - this is the last thing I'm gonna do
158:56 - today for sure besides read some random
158:58 - numbers this is the knock-knock one so
159:04 - if I look at this like the knock-knock
159:08 - chatbot Chapa is pretty it's pretty
159:12 - simple okay all right so now close all
159:21 - this out
159:32 - Oh Eric Eric in the chat hi Eric is
159:42 - telling me that thick pay-per-click game
159:43 - never ends the universe resets actually
159:46 - true mates think like let's do the Wrath
159:57 - of Khan oh I'm getting a little dizzy
160:09 - give me a little dizzy everything's okay
160:12 - all right ready everybody we need we
160:15 - need to we need some warm up here pull
160:39 - the muscle of my dad all right let's do
160:41 - this
160:42 - this last exciting chat bot the music's
160:45 - messed up I'm not worried about it
160:50 - the sound is broken but hold on
160:56 - probably because but this is still
161:00 - working and can you still hear the
161:13 - speech-to-text thing text-to-speech yeah
161:19 - I messed it up because I change the
161:21 - volume for this but I can fix that back
161:26 - later okay
161:29 - I wonder why that is
161:33 - I really shouldn't worry about that
161:35 - right now you guys are getting to me
161:37 - here
161:37 - oh maybe it's the loopback audio that I
161:40 - want to use all right I'm gonna not I'm
161:45 - gonna not worry about that mouse over
161:51 - this stream okay how's the paper coop
161:55 - don't ask me how the paper clips are
161:57 - coming along that's a very bad idea I'm
162:00 - gonna be I want to get home by 7:00 so
162:02 - let's do this coding challenge let me
162:04 - fix this a little bit okay
162:08 - oh the Texas speech sounds bad so I
162:10 - messed something up so we have to fix
162:13 - this it looks like stuttering hmm
162:37 - tell me if it I know that's right I'm
162:40 - checking them kind of let me unplug and
162:43 - plug some wire stuff in oh I hear it
162:53 - crackling did it fix shoot let me see
163:16 - here there's a couple other places I can
163:21 - try to check not fixed okay thank you
163:27 - guys for letting me know
163:51 - let's see I unplugged and plugged a
163:53 - bunch of things back in let me do that
163:55 - one more time
163:55 - oh wait a sec I'm so silly that I can
164:09 - actually I'm waiting for you guys to
164:11 - tell me if it's fixed and I forgot that
164:12 - I have a monitor here I think it's okay
164:30 - now I'm hearing it fine
164:52 - so when I was listening to these
164:56 - headphones you guys heard it clipping
164:58 - and stuttering that's weird cuz it's
165:03 - fine for me in the monitor so where
165:06 - could that mean it's having a problem
165:18 - yeah I'm trying to think I guess I could
165:20 - stop I'm gonna hit stop streaming and
165:23 - start streaming again instantly I think
165:26 - it won't split this up into two separate
165:27 - streams I'm sorry everybody I know this
165:30 - is so the right physical issue but what
165:35 - this is in theory no you understand that
165:43 - the what I'm listening to here is the
165:46 - final audio before it goes to stream so
165:50 - something is happening this is not like
165:53 - this is not connected to my laptop this
165:55 - is connected to the live streaming
165:56 - computer and this is the monitoring that
165:58 - output so like I can hear myself talking
166:00 - if I put these on hello hello and I hear
166:04 - no issues so so yeah but my voice is
166:28 - fine too isn't that weird that's very
166:32 - weird but I've unplugged and plugged
166:35 - everything in that would the only thing
166:37 - I can think of as restarting OBS
166:46 - you know what but wasn't doing it before
166:52 - well I'm gonna try stopping and starting
166:54 - streaming real quick okay I'm gonna try
166:57 - that ready here we go one two three all
167:03 - right I should be back let's see if this
167:07 - is the music bad two or just my laptop
167:18 - turn the interim thing off what's the
167:21 - interim thing am i back can you guys see
167:36 - me
167:53 - huh
167:54 - is the music bad
168:31 - so now you can't hear anything
168:49 - oh it's working now it's fine okay are
169:06 - we good was the was the speech-to-text
169:09 - fine - yeah Oh still bad what but the
169:17 - music is fine why was it fix I did every
169:30 - say was fixed for a second hold on I
169:35 - think it's this cable hmm all right oh I
169:48 - hate having these technical problems
169:50 - hold on I need it I think this cable is
169:55 - bad whoa
169:58 - something just happened
170:33 - different mic picked it up alright okay
170:37 - [Laughter]
170:49 - ignore it play through the air into the
170:51 - mic that I could do still that okay so
171:00 - definitely if I'm gonna do this I need
171:03 - to just out of curiosity
171:25 - I'm plugging the output to YouTube
171:27 - button I did that fix the music by any
171:30 - chance I'm probably just gonna do it
171:36 - emergency Chrome extensions yeah no okay
171:40 - so I'm gonna basically unplug this turn
171:55 - this all the way up how's that yeah so
172:21 - now it's just coming out of my laptop
172:23 - speakers and being picked up by this mic
172:25 - which if that's good enough then accept
172:30 - the ball then that that's what I'm gonna
172:34 - do hmm all right well I lost all my
172:40 - momentum and energy I'm at 1 million
172:45 - paperclips though I kind of want to
172:51 - restart everything and make it work but
172:52 - I'm no I can't play the music now I mean
172:56 - the music is completely is non-existent
172:59 - it's plugged into something that mean
173:11 - it's just coming out of like random
173:14 - speakers now okay let's do this oh my
173:17 - god I plant them computing now oh my all
173:20 - my stocks are doing terribly got a lot
173:26 - of unsold inventory lower the pricier
173:36 - I'm sort of get some high risk money
173:38 - going okay
173:45 - I need photonic chips okay all right
173:51 - shall we do this just get everything oh
173:57 - I completely forgot I was lying all
174:01 - right here's the thing should I just go
174:04 - I think I'm gonna go ahead and do this
174:05 - the computer I feel a little sad that
174:09 - the audio is gonna be a little like not
174:10 - great but I think we're just gonna have
174:16 - to live with it and I'm gonna do this
174:18 - okay
174:32 - it's a little quiet oops
174:37 - so I don't know how to make it I'm gonna
174:40 - do the bots don't worry yet I'm trying
174:47 - to just think if there's a like if I
174:52 - just I think it came let me just try one
174:54 - more thing which is to oh wait a second
175:01 - oh because I turned off the laptop audio
175:07 - well weird hold on a second
175:09 - just just bear with me for a second why
175:20 - does the oh oh because I put it on
175:24 - internal speakers okay okay so I have
175:28 - one more thing I can try if I might as
175:33 - well try this one last thing which is
175:35 - that I have a duplicate cable I just
175:38 - want to know if it's the cable so if you
175:41 - don't mind I'm going to very quickly
175:46 - swap cables it's probably a different
175:50 - cable because this one I kept unplugging
175:52 - and plugging in but let me just give
175:56 - this one last try
176:08 - and then
176:18 - okay this is now gonna go out through
176:20 - the HDMI again how's that i awkward dev
176:36 - for hiding the 13 yeah sounds bad okay
176:41 - nevermind it's something else I don't
176:43 - know where it's happening but it's not
176:45 - this cable I mean I could try swapping a
176:48 - different cable there's so many things I
176:49 - could try swapping now but I'm gonna
176:52 - have to just forget it okay thank you
176:55 - for that was one last thing I could try
176:57 - I could probably restart the computer
176:58 - but I prefer not to do that alright I
177:14 - should turn off the paper it's gotta be
177:16 - that it's got to be the paper clips it's
177:18 - gotta be frank Lance how am I doing here
177:36 - oh I really need to I need to get this
177:41 - marketing going this is ridiculous
177:44 - hold on everybody I know I'm distracted
177:53 - to
177:57 - there we go fifty dollars per second
177:59 - that's good all right I'm gonna let that
178:09 - go and here we go really lost my mind
178:14 - here
178:14 - six o'clock all right here we go
178:27 - hi I'm gonna do one more a chatbot I'm
178:31 - kind of gonna do the exact same chatbot
178:32 - I just did maybe I'll change it from a
178:34 - number guessing thing to a knock-knock
178:36 - joke thing just to change it but instead
178:39 - of me typing guess the number between 1
178:42 - and 10 ok let's try 7 pick a higher
178:45 - number let's try 9 the lower number
178:47 - let's try hate I got it
178:49 - instead of typing I want to interact
178:51 - with this chat bot through voice so it
178:53 - just recorded 2 tutorials about the p5
178:56 - speech library 1 tutorial looks at
179:01 - text-to-speech so having the browser
179:04 - speak with a voice and another tutorial
179:07 - looks at speech to text listening to
179:10 - what I'm saying and and turning that
179:14 - into text so let's first so let me first
179:17 - cup two things let me deal with this
179:19 - chat bond a little bit let me first say
179:22 - one thing that I got wrong in the
179:23 - previous coding challenge video that I
179:25 - that I should as I as I created this
179:27 - like elaborate system if you recall to
179:33 - say to the chat bot set a number and
179:36 - then set the variable to whatever so I
179:39 - had to like secretly talk to the chat
179:40 - bot there's actually a set var method
179:42 - that's part of the rive script
179:43 - JavaScript library so I didn't have to
179:45 - use that convoluted methodology if you
179:46 - don't know I'm talking about you didn't
179:48 - watch the previous coding challenge you
179:49 - can go back and watch it and this will
179:50 - make sense but this was an unnecessary
179:52 - step thank you for internet for
179:55 - correcting me and helping me with that
179:56 - but I'm actually going to just kind of
179:59 - get rid of this brain and I'm gonna
180:03 - start over I'm gonna do a sub I'm gonna
180:10 - I want to make sure cuz uh with a
180:13 - knock-knock joke you might say who is
180:15 - there or who's there knock-knock no but
180:19 - that's the box saying that anyway so I
180:20 - don't need this sub what I'm gonna do is
180:23 - do I'm going to have a catch-all which
180:26 - is anything the user says I'm going to
180:28 - say try saying
180:31 - knock-knock and then optionally if the
180:36 - user says anything we
180:39 - the phrase knock-knock in it so this is
180:41 - like a channel wildcard I wonder if I
180:43 - need that optional around there then I'm
180:46 - gonna then the bot is going to say who
180:49 - who's there
180:53 - okay so let's just try this and this is
180:56 - one of the examples from the rive script
180:58 - website so I can say anything I want and
181:00 - it's gonna say try saying knock-knock
181:02 - and then I could just add knock-knock
181:04 - and it's gonna say who's there or I
181:06 - could say
181:07 - knock-knock and it could say who's there
181:11 - now here's the thing now what I want to
181:14 - do is say well whatever they say in
181:19 - response to who's there the bot should
181:25 - say star one who and then at the end the
181:31 - bot should say haha so this is the
181:36 - sequence knock knock who's there
181:39 - Frank Frank who Frank Lance ha ha ha
181:47 - Franklin's making a weird nonsensical
181:50 - appearance in this video tutorial for no
181:53 - good reason but that's besides the point
181:56 - so here's the thing though VI can't have
181:58 - all these stars what I need is something
182:00 - to help me sequence and I'm kind of
182:02 - forgetting what the what the command is
182:06 - for sequencing but I'm gonna remember in
182:09 - a second because there's gonna be about
182:10 - to be an edit point we're gonna look it
182:12 - up now I'll just look it up with with
182:14 - you and watching me do this so I have an
182:15 - example that already does this I was
182:17 - trying to do it from scratch and here it
182:18 - is so ah the percent the percent means
182:23 - if the last thing was who is there then
182:27 - I say whatever who if the previous thing
182:31 - was whatever who then I can say haha
182:35 - that is so funny so I need to add this
182:37 - in to here right think about this this
182:42 - is saying this is a catch-all but only
182:45 - if the previous thing that the bot said
182:48 - was who is there ah but the bot says
182:50 - who's there
182:51 - this is why I want to have this
182:55 - substitution I knew there was a reason
182:57 - this substitution who's and who is our
183:01 - equivalent so whatever kind of mechanics
183:03 - is working have them be equivalent and
183:05 - then I also want by the way I don't
183:07 - usually do this in a coding challenge
183:08 - just like a copy-paste from an example
183:11 - but that's what I'm doing the point of
183:13 - this was to add the speech thing so I
183:15 - guess I could cut me some slack here so
183:19 - then at the end if the last thing was
183:21 - star who now let's see the order might
183:25 - matter let's see if the or let's see if
183:27 - this works I put these in a different
183:29 - order than in the example but let's see
183:30 - if this works
183:31 - so let's go back to the bots and I'm
183:34 - gonna just type in some nonsense so say
183:35 - try saying knock-knock
183:37 - so I'm gonna say knock-knock say who's
183:38 - there coding coding who coding train yay
183:45 - [Music]
183:47 - okay so we have a working knock-knock
183:49 - joke chat bot thing because by the way
183:51 - if I were to say now coding train it's
183:54 - good as they try saying knock-knock
183:55 - right because it only laughed because it
183:57 - was part of the sequence but the whole
184:00 - point of this video however long I am in
184:03 - is now to 10,000 steps so I walk back
184:09 - and forth what it's really good to do a
184:11 - like live YouTube channel with a Fitbit
184:13 - on okay I wanted to speak so how do we
184:17 - do that so I need to import download and
184:20 - import the p5 speech library so if you
184:23 - want to know how to do that I cover that
184:25 - in my tutorials about the p5 speech
184:27 - library right now I'm just gonna have a
184:29 - moment where I disappear and reappear
184:30 - with the library downloaded so let me
184:34 - just grab the library because actually
184:40 - you know what I should no no let me not
184:41 - do that
184:45 - I I need the p5.js library so how do I
184:49 - get that I think the piece I need the
184:53 - p5.js speech library the v5 speech
184:55 - library how do I get that so I have that
184:57 - open here this github repository if I
185:00 - just go into here Lib and I see this
185:03 - particular file p5 speech Jas this is
185:06 - the file I need to download and include
185:08 - it as part of my project so I'm not
185:10 - going to go through the steps to
185:11 - download it right now it's already there
185:12 - it's not already there but I'm gonna
185:13 - have an edit point and now and now I'm
185:24 - gonna go chat no speech rec library p5
185:28 - speech chat bot to libraries p5 speech
185:32 - ok I'm back and you can see that I've
185:40 - now added p5 speech Jas to my folder
185:43 - with libraries in it and actually with
185:45 - the thing that I didn't do is I need to
185:46 - go into o index dot HTML and also add a
185:50 - reference to that P v dot speech jeaious
185:53 - library ok now I have this p5 speech
185:55 - library now what I want to do is I'm
186:00 - going to say let speech equals new p v
186:04 - dot speech and do i need an argument
186:08 - there i can't remember but i think no if
186:10 - i wanted to set a voice you know i'm
186:11 - just gonna use the default voice voice
186:13 - speech dot speak hello
186:16 - so let's just see if this works
186:23 - so unfortunately my sound system isn't
186:24 - working so great so you're hearing it
186:26 - out of the computer speakers and in
186:27 - through my mic hopefully you can hear it
186:29 - ok but you can see this is as simple as
186:32 - just creating a speech object and saying
186:34 - it's speak hello my other video I go
186:36 - through how to pick a different voice
186:37 - how to change the rate and pitch but I
186:39 - just want to use the default voice and
186:41 - now instead of wherever it says sticks
186:46 - the out put it in HTML thing I'm gonna
186:49 - say speech dot speak reply okay here we
186:54 - go so I'm going to type in some nonsense
186:57 - all right now I'm gonna say knock-knock
187:02 - coding coding rainbow okay so we get the
187:16 - idea we get the idea this works now I
187:19 - kind of want to remove the text there
187:21 - the point was this but now what I need I
187:23 - need four instead of me typing in the
187:25 - stuff I want to now be able to say it oh
187:27 - this is gonna be fast so now what I need
187:30 - can I do this in the same sketch is I
187:33 - need a speech recognition object which I
187:37 - must say new p5 speech speech rec okay
187:42 - and I need to give it a callback got
187:45 - speech so this is the tricky thing the
187:47 - callback is for when asked equivalent of
187:50 - when I hit the submit button so whatever
187:53 - I did in that submit button
187:54 - that's the callback when I hit submit I
187:57 - want to just process what I said well I
188:00 - think this is gonna work am I making I
188:01 - might not be making any sense but I need
188:03 - I need to add this I need to add a
188:07 - function called got speech speech so I
188:12 - just want to make sure this works and
188:13 - I'm gonna just say console.log so this I
188:15 - go through this in more detail in that
188:17 - other tutorial video but basically this
188:19 - speech object comes with a property
188:22 - called text so and I forgot that I need
188:26 - to say I need to explicitly tell the
188:28 - speech recording object to start and
188:30 - there's some things I can configure in
188:31 - the start function I'm gonna use the
188:32 - default settings all right so let's just
188:34 - see if this works now so you can see
188:38 - that it's listening to me but if I've
188:44 - done this before so normally we would
188:45 - have pop up with like can I use your
188:46 - microphone thing you might see that and
188:48 - you can see that I'm getting the text
188:50 - that I'm saying here
188:54 - knock-knock great alright so this is
188:58 - working so now what I need to do is I
189:00 - need to change it from basically the
189:04 - user input is no longer what's coming in
189:07 - from that text box but instead
189:12 - it's what's coming in from speech text
189:14 - so it needs to reply to speech dot text
189:19 - and I'm gonna do something really
189:21 - ridiculous which is I'm gonna say input
189:25 - user input dot value speech tech so I'm
189:31 - gonna put what I'm saying also on the
189:32 - screen just for debugging purposes I'm
189:34 - gonna remove all that before I finish so
189:36 - let's let's go knock knock okay got an
189:43 - error speech dot speak is not a function
189:46 - ah what's happened here these callbacks
189:49 - maybe live somewhere else oh look at
189:54 - this I name the same variable too why I
189:56 - called this speech I should call this or
189:59 - some camera stuff I don't know we wrote
190:00 - a speech let's just call this speech
190:04 - speech data oh I I need better variable
190:07 - names somebody will think of better
190:08 - variable names and I'm gonna say let let
190:12 - input equals speech data text and then
190:19 - I'm just going to use input here input
190:23 - input and input all right let's see if
190:27 - this works
190:30 - hello knock knock Daniel Daniel sheath
190:45 - Mon wow that was exciting it worked
190:52 - could you hear it could you hear it so
190:56 - this is great I think I'm done oh let's
190:58 - let's just remove let's remove
191:00 - everything from the HTML page just for
191:02 - the the sake of argument so I'm gonna
191:04 - just comment all this stuff out I'm
191:06 - gonna go into my code and I don't want
191:10 - any Dom elements I don't need talking to
191:16 - me I don't want to use this Dom element
191:19 - I don't want to use this Dom element
191:21 - and I don't need this function alright
191:23 - so I just commented out all the stuff
191:24 - that was for the HTML stuff hello
191:29 - bot knock-knock
191:36 - coding train coding train coding
191:44 - challenged completed yeah alright I
191:53 - don't know that was up let me try it one
191:56 - more time oh well let me do a different
191:58 - demonstration with a I need a real
192:00 - knock-knock joke oh I got one I got one
192:03 - I got one
192:05 - Matthew edit that out this will be the
192:07 - real one use

192:33 - another one
192:34 - knock knock knock knock
192:42 - okay am i back you can't see the
192:47 - computer can you see me can you hear me
192:52 - I'm sort of hoping I wonder if that
192:55 - fixed by the way I had to restart the
192:57 - computer so I sort of wanted to see if
192:59 - the audio problem got fixed if you don't
193:02 - mind so let me see if that fixed the
193:08 - audio problem I'm just curious so if I
193:10 - go back to the sound settings and do
193:13 - multi output device hello
193:19 - charging knock knock who's there
193:23 - alright did that fix the the audio thing
193:27 - I mean it's you're gonna hear twice
193:30 - because I turned it up so it's coming
193:31 - through my micro yeah it does
193:34 - great well let me just go redo the whole
193:36 - video again all right let me turn it
193:38 - down I can't
193:39 - oh so frustrating should restart I would
193:45 - have restarted the computer if I knew it
193:47 - was gonna crash in the first place and I
193:49 - think by the way unfortunately when it
193:51 - crashes I think that corrupted the whole
193:53 - recording to disk so I think of course
193:55 - me to edit these challenge we're gonna
193:57 - have to like suck down the livestream
193:58 - archive off of YouTube anyway
194:02 - if anybody knows how you could because I
194:05 - the data is there like I know right now
194:06 - let me look let me just if that happened
194:08 - because I can ask there is yeah there is
194:12 - a whoa oh my goodness a huge file here
194:19 - that I can get rid of there is a 7.5 gig
194:24 - video file which was the whole
194:26 - livestream archive which won't open
194:30 - because it's not closed properly there
194:31 - must be a way the data's got to all be
194:33 - there there must be a way to like just
194:35 - fix a it's like a dot mp4 file if
194:39 - anybody knows how to do that let me know
194:41 - because we had this problem before if I
194:45 - am writing to mp4 yes
194:47 - so Alka maybe I need to write to
194:49 - something some other like they can't
194:51 - deal with this right now but maybe I
194:52 - need to change the settings another time
194:54 - alright let's let's finish this out by

196:26 - with me this is a little trickier to
196:27 - share especially if it's a rather than
196:31 - just like oh it's an interesting like
196:32 - rainbow particle system but figure out a
196:34 - way to share it with me share a link in
196:35 - the comments or tweet me at Schiffman
196:37 - and i will see you in a future video

197:09 - it's me I am sue me is telling me it's
197:12 - fairly simple to chunk it to the last
197:13 - total frame or whatever so I could use
197:15 - some help with that I'm gonna upload
197:16 - these files to Google Drive

198:17 - high-risk stocks ooh let's let's run
198:20 - some tournament what else can I get I
198:24 - don't have any quantum computing yet do
198:26 - I can get some more of these things all
198:33 - right make some extra ones all right
198:40 - this is this is how far we're gonna have
198:42 - gotten by the way everybody let me see
198:43 - if wait I'm not looking at the YouTube
198:44 - chat I'm not by the way Thank You Alka

198:51 - forgot when I when I went to restart the
198:53 - computer
198:54 - I didn't load up the YouTube chat let me
198:56 - see if I can look at it real quick on
198:57 - this computer here Dan when will you be
199:03 - back with a neural network series I hope
199:05 - to be able to announce some stuff about
199:06 - that soon and it will be towards the end
199:08 - of this year or early 2018 until you
199:12 - know the reality of my the way that I do
199:14 - this channel is that I'm trying to
199:16 - support the courses that I'm teaching
199:17 - and so that content doesn't you know I
199:19 - wish I had done it over the summer I
199:21 - wanted to but that content just doesn't
199:22 - fit till later
199:23 - Oh next week I next week I will be in
199:28 - Boston for processing day there will be
199:30 - no live stream next Friday so the next
199:32 - live stream will be unless I can find a
199:34 - time in between now two weeks from today
199:36 - that that live session will be recorded
199:39 - so hopefully that'll be another video so
199:44 - there are two chats I'm using a
199:46 - crowdfunding site called patreon
199:48 - patreon.com slash coding train and so
199:52 - for people who are members or patrons of
199:54 - the channel through that there's a pipe
199:56 - there's a private slack channel that
199:57 - you'll get an invite to
200:03 - wait hold on what ah wait why is my oh
200:13 - there we go
200:14 - zero all right no thank you
200:18 - so this is the final number this is the
200:23 - final number I should be on the desktop
200:25 - where do the screenshots go hmm yep here
200:29 - it is this is the final number for the
200:32 - live stream by the way if I had just
200:34 - focused only on the paper clips I would
200:37 - have gotten way way way past this is the
200:39 - final number three million fifty-five
200:40 - thousand seven hundred fifty one the
200:42 - rules are just to remind you your tweet
200:44 - with the hashtag paper clip train had to
200:47 - be a timestamp 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time
200:52 - and your number the difference between
200:54 - your number and this number the absolute
200:56 - value of that has to be the smallest of
200:58 - everybody
200:59 - and if you did multiple guesses your
201:02 - last one in a valid timestamp is the one
201:05 - that will count so I will look through
201:07 - and try to find the winner but if
201:09 - anybody feels like looking through the
201:10 - hash tag with this number and helping me
201:12 - find the winner and like doing some kind
201:14 - of like certified authentication I will
201:17 - then direct message you and get your
201:20 - address anywhere in the world I will
201:22 - send a coding train t-shirt so so that's
201:30 - the that's that there's 400 people
201:33 - watching right now which is kind of
201:34 - insane this has been going on for three
201:37 - hours and 23 minutes which is the good
201:39 - sign it leads me to believe the
201:40 - interface is leading me to believe
201:41 - oh I that I'm completely brain dead
201:46 - right now
201:47 - I'm gonna go which is it leads me to
201:49 - believe that the hashtag is particle
201:53 - known paperclip train I believe let's
201:55 - check it a Twitter comm hashtag
202:05 - paperclip train so we can just sort of
202:10 - scan over this to see this is pretty
202:12 - good noah van boven is looking pretty
202:15 - good
202:17 - this is the end of the game right all
202:21 - right so I'll look through this later
202:22 - thank you guys for watching I hope this
202:24 - was a helpful session I hope to have
202:27 - more sleep before the next time I will
202:29 - see you two weeks from now thank you for
202:32 - joining the coding train I'm gonna check
202:35 - the slack channel to make sure I didn't
202:37 - miss anything
202:39 - thirteen million is maybe the closest me
202:42 - I am Samia there's a 1 million yeah 1
202:44 - million is gonna be closer so

203:19 - somebody wants to help me with the sound
203:20 - board I would love that I have an iPad
203:22 - which drives it but I would be totally
203:24 - open to using a different solution and
