07:18 - mic on mic hot mic kids one and hello
07:23 - good morning oh there's my treatise I
07:26 - forgot to have it handy oh okay hold on
07:32 - hold on we've got it to see the yeah
07:34 - [Music]
07:35 - okay we see the a back to me your host
07:40 - of the coding train at home it is me Dan
07:45 - Shipman welcome good morning it has been
07:47 - quite a while since I have live-streamed
07:49 - I think it was about 72 years ago or at
07:53 - least it certainly feels like when I was
07:54 - back at work at New York University in a
07:57 - room that had no windows live-streaming
08:00 - and doing coach coding tutorials so much
08:02 - has changed I have a smile on my face
08:04 - but I know a lot of people are
08:05 - struggling and have a lot of different
08:07 - kinds of hardships and challenges and I
08:10 - hope that doing a little livestream this
08:12 - morning can I'm being tapped on the leg
08:15 - yes I was saying meaningful important
08:18 - things to the camera you can do scratch
08:21 - that's what we're doing I'm a very
08:25 - serious person who does very serious
08:27 - meaningful important last days anyway
08:29 - what I want to say is I hope that this
08:30 - livestream can bring you a distraction a
08:33 - little bit of happiness maybe you will
08:35 - learn something I should say from the
08:37 - outset that if what you were expecting
08:39 - today was a comprar / coding tutorial
08:42 - and educational experience not that that
08:44 - ever actually happens on the coding
08:45 - train it really doesn't mm-hm
08:48 - but today will be even less so I'm just
08:50 - gonna have a little fun test out the new
08:52 - setup that I have here at home
08:53 - I've got operator one say hello in the
08:56 - chat operator one operator 111 years old
09:00 - e is operating the chat typing hello in
09:04 - there and operator number two wave to me
09:06 - hello operator number two is let's take
09:11 - a look at this what do you got on your
09:12 - screen there operator number two know
09:16 - what like you're right you have to
09:17 - scratch open yeah okay this is oh there
09:21 - it is operators number two scratch
09:22 - project
09:24 - eight years old so we will be looking at
09:26 - operator number two's oops that's the
09:27 - wrong button which is fine I'm going to
09:30 - talk about this in a second we will be
09:32 - looking at operator number two's a
09:34 - scratch project in a little bit.i
09:36 - all right so I'm not worried you know
09:38 - I'm never organized with this stuff but
09:40 - I should have least had myself a little
09:42 - outline or a little script which I do
09:44 - not but this is the plan for today first
09:47 - I want to talk about that this live
09:49 - stream is a fundraiser it is a
09:52 - fundraiser for the coding NAT cuff sorry
09:57 - it's coding Kovan 19 sila dairy response
10:00 - fund for who
10:01 - this is fundraiser is being operated out
10:03 - of Google and YouTube itself there
10:05 - should be a donate button that you can
10:07 - see the livestream page that you're
10:10 - looking at you can make a donation let
10:12 - me just read to you what this fundraiser
10:13 - is we're all affected by the growing
10:15 - kovat 19 pandemic it's an unprecedented
10:18 - health challenge and we know people and
10:20 - organizations everywhere want to help
10:21 - the World Health Organization is leading
10:23 - and coordinating the global effort
10:25 - supporting countries to prevent detect
10:27 - and respond to the pant endemic the
10:29 - greatest need right now is to help
10:30 - ensure all countries are prepared
10:32 - especially those with the weakest health
10:33 - systems donations support who's who work
10:38 - to track and understand the spread of
10:39 - the virus to ensure patients get the
10:41 - care they need and frontline workers get
10:43 - essential supplies and information and
10:45 - to accelerate efforts to develop
10:47 - vaccines tests and treatments so I know
10:49 - there are a lot of good causes and
10:51 - organizations and there's a lot of
10:52 - people and organizations in need right
10:54 - now this since this is sort of
10:57 - officially vetted through YouTube and
10:58 - they're actually I should know this but
11:00 - I believe Google is matching a certain
11:03 - number a certain I think every $2 for
11:05 - every $1 you donate should look that up
11:08 - in advance but there is a match by
11:12 - Google and YouTube again this is not an
11:14 - official this is just me at home
11:16 - Brooklyn New York live-streaming with
11:18 - some equipment that I threw together so
11:20 - I'm not an official representative of
11:22 - this fundraiser of who of Google of
11:24 - YouTube any of that I'm just
11:25 - participating as a citizen of the world
11:29 - okay so and keep it friendly in the chat
11:33 - this is this is the coding train for
11:35 - kids okay I mean I always try to be a
11:37 - fan
11:37 - friendly show but here we are hello
11:41 - alright do you want to announce the QA
11:44 - so let me first mention that there is a
11:46 - coding train discord so I'm just gonna
11:49 - press my little button here which should
11:51 - post a link to the discord in the chat
11:52 - if your if you want to engage with the
11:56 - coding train community in various ways
11:58 - join the discord I will be doing I've
12:01 - got some new technology where I can take
12:03 - calls and I'm gonna do like a QA live
12:06 - call-in kind of like show like thing
12:08 - with people in the discord at some point
12:10 - next week I don't know when yet so join
12:12 - the discord if you want an announcement
12:14 - for that let's see what else do I want
12:18 - to talk about so that was talking about
12:23 - this as a fundraiser what am I
12:25 - forgetting anything operator one or
12:26 - operator number two you're just working
12:28 - there over on scratch operator number
12:29 - two not even paying attention so let me
12:34 - talk about scratch for a second I am
12:37 - going to switch over to here you know we
12:42 - should find one of the cats oh it's
12:45 - right okay operator number one is off to
12:49 - find a cat you guys don't have to
12:54 - whisper I'm very confused by the way
12:56 - what's appropriate in terms of having
13:01 - kids on a live stream so this this is
13:03 - not monetized live stream there is a
13:06 - chat going my kids really wanted to
13:08 - participate I'd love to have them
13:09 - participate and do lots of fun things
13:11 - with them but anyway I'm also all
13:13 - conscientious about their privacy so I'm
13:15 - trying to figure out what is appropriate
13:16 - but they might say hello their faces
13:18 - might pop up I think we will all survive
13:20 - what can I show you here on this by the
13:23 - way operator number two oh here we go
13:25 - we've got we've got cat number one okay
13:29 - that's operator number one's head going
13:31 - by let's see let's switch to the full
13:33 - view here we go okay so this is Greta
13:37 - Greta is was born when was Greta born
13:42 - July so how old
13:45 - Greta was born in July it seems like oh
13:48 - that seems like a billion years ago
13:52 - but Greta was born to a rescued cat by
13:56 - one of my colleagues at NYU rescued the
13:59 - mother was the mother's name you don't
14:02 - remember
14:02 - remember the mother's name mama cat and
14:06 - we read and so we adopted two of the
14:08 - kittens born to mama cat Greta and the
14:12 - other the other cat is Eva and you can
14:15 - follow them on Instagram Instagram comm
14:20 - / mango and goose so yeah what oh yeah I
14:29 - was gonna put her on my shoulder but I
14:31 - don't think she likes that okay here we
14:34 - have Greta back some Eevee will come at
14:36 - some point operator number two would
14:39 - like a cat we have two cats all right
14:41 - that's why you have to fertilize it's
14:42 - nice to have to because they have each
14:44 - other you know I I would say one of the
14:47 - the living beings of the world that are
14:50 - happiest with this crisis global crisis
14:53 - and I don't mean to trivialize it or
14:54 - make light of it but are the pets of the
14:57 - world because everybody's at home with
14:58 - their pets all the time I did it confirm
15:01 - my email let's see oh no I'm not I'm not
15:04 - showing you that screen right now okay
15:06 - you know what we really need to do kids
15:07 - kids kids it's story time it's story
15:11 - time on the coding train hmm time for me
15:14 - to read you a bedtime story even though
15:16 - it's morning and I know you just woke up
15:18 - you didn't just wake up but it's time to
15:20 - read a story
15:21 - [Music]
15:26 - eighty-six thousand 197 we're listening
15:30 - are you listening you're paying
15:31 - attention by the way I have read entire
15:45 - I mean actually operator number one
15:48 - who's read all the books like but once
15:55 - we get through all those I've been
15:56 - looking for mango and dusar the middle
16:02 - names thank you for answering this is
16:04 - the best chat mamita thank you to all of
16:07 - you nice wonderful volunteer moderators
16:09 - well always up through the chat but I
16:11 - have to say operator number one why
16:14 - you're number one and that one's number
16:16 - two equal in my hearts you know you're
16:22 - both operator one and a half operator a
16:25 - half an operator wanted to have yep okay
16:32 - mm I was reaping you a bedtime story
16:36 - okay let's see so let me talk about
16:43 - scratch for a second so um one thing
16:45 - that I want to say is i I'm gonna return
16:47 - to let me let me find this playlist here
16:51 - just to give you people a little bit of
16:52 - update about what's going on in terms of
16:55 - the coding train and that sort of stuff
17:00 - let me get to here yes I'm being tapped
17:06 - they should be zero where's my bell that
17:14 - is such a good point I apologize to
17:17 - everyone in the world right now that I
17:20 - have offended with my counting from one
17:22 - we have a big announcement to make
17:29 - I present to you operator number and I
17:34 - present to you face buried beneath the
17:43 - computer how's the scratch project going
17:45 - not good okay we're gonna can we look at
17:49 - it soon no okay all right what I wanted
17:53 - to update you on is my progress with the
17:58 - nature of code playlist this is was my
18:01 - before the world changed so radically
18:04 - this was what I was working on so this
18:07 - is I wouldn't say advanced level but
18:10 - this is sort of like a follow-up
18:12 - playlist to four tutorials about how to
18:15 - program in p5.js actually what I should
18:19 - find you is this one let me go to here
18:26 - so for those of you who might be new to
18:28 - the coding training usually the stuff
18:30 - that I program in is in either Java
18:34 - using a programming environment called
18:36 - processing which I could go on and on
18:38 - about but I'm going to stop myself from
18:40 - doing that right now or p5 yes which is
18:42 - a JavaScript library and if you go to
18:44 - learning I'll actually go to big if
18:46 - you're new and you go to beginners you
18:48 - can find the two playlists here for if
18:51 - you've never programmed before and I
18:54 - would say probably especially for all
18:55 - the kids at home this playlist I would
18:58 - say is probably appropriate for maybe
19:01 - sixth grade on you know I there are
19:05 - younger people and older people who do
19:09 - program in JavaScript but if np5 but I
19:15 - would say that the prerequisites are
19:17 - really being sort of comfortable typing
19:18 - so kind of all you need but that so if
19:22 - you've never programmed in JavaScript
19:24 - before this is a playlist that you can
19:27 - that you can follow then is that the st.
19:30 - that's the same cat okay then we have a
19:34 - whole lot of others so I wanted to
19:36 - mention this so because a couple people
19:37 - have asked me oh I want to do some
19:39 - coding while I'm at home where's your
19:41 - playlist too
19:43 - with this is this is the one to look at
19:44 - now the one that I'm currently working
19:46 - on on the website is under learning
19:48 - slash nature of code and so this is a
19:52 - yes what you need help with your scratch
19:57 - project yeah okay what we're gonna get
20:00 - to that next operator number one needs
20:02 - help we've got right now like over 500
20:06 - people watching this right now who maybe
20:08 - can help operator number one of course
20:10 - operator zero can probably careful with
20:12 - those buttons they change the view of
20:14 - what people are looking at which is fine
20:16 - so but I've put this a little bit on
20:18 - pause these I was recording in a studio
20:20 - I had set up at NYU to school the arts
20:23 - in downtown Brooklyn where I also teach
20:26 - classes at a program called ITP and ima
20:28 - and I but I'm gonna see if I can get
20:31 - this studio working well and get
20:33 - comfortable with it so I could continue
20:35 - this series but in the meantime today is
20:41 - really just a test run a way of saying
20:43 - hello and hopefully providing some
20:45 - comfort or support to people if I can
20:48 - and then what I will what we're gonna do
20:54 - now is I've actually so let me talk
20:56 - about scratch for a second so if you're
20:58 - not familiar with scratch scratch is
21:01 - what would how would you define scratch
21:03 - operator zero block coding okay what
21:07 - does block coding mean right
21:13 - so it's block based coding meaning you
21:15 - coding is writing instructions for a
21:17 - computer to follow oh wait anonymous
21:21 - [Music]
21:41 - silly music for donations is not
21:44 - appropriate okay what's going on you
21:48 - really need help I happen to do a thing
21:50 - where I talk all the time so we just go
21:52 - to your project right now and help you
21:53 - alright I'm sorry everybody I have to go
21:56 - where the wind takes me we're gonna see
21:59 - if we can go over here and get operator
22:03 - number ones a screen up okay this is
22:08 - operator number one screen also known as
22:10 - rotten kitty to a-1 I'll let you try to
22:12 - guess so this is the scratch project
22:15 - what is the scratch project you're
22:16 - currently trying to meet what's that
22:20 - Quidditch okay
22:22 - quiz okay operator number one is working
22:26 - on a quiz which bowtie is different so
22:30 - how and I wonder if I should get a
22:33 - camera view here ooh whoa hey that looks
22:38 - hold on you're like wait so what do you
22:40 - have so far you want to come over here
22:41 - so people can hear you
22:42 - no do you want to just talk to me and
22:45 - I'll say things into the mic okay so
22:49 - tell me what you have so far
22:56 - what's that oh you could barely hear me
23:00 - over that music sorry so I need to turn
23:02 - the music down that's very easy for me
23:04 - to do alright so it looks like what we
23:09 - have here is a quiz that's called which
23:13 - bowtie is different and I'm not
23:17 - operating computer right now different
23:20 - is spelled wrong that's okay and so the
23:23 - idea I think is that the user the player
23:26 - of the game and maybe I should well I'm
23:29 - gonna just put my camera on over here
23:31 - what I'm going to show you how to
23:32 - operate this okay so I'm gonna do so I'm
23:34 - just doing a little bit of we're gonna
23:35 - do video capture device we do add
23:38 - existing Elgato camera so if I do this
23:45 - now I've got the camera I'm gonna make
23:46 - this nice and small where do you think
23:48 - is a good spot for it like do you think
23:50 - it's better over here let's just
23:52 - leave it over here so we've got put it
23:55 - up there no I think that's gonna but we
23:58 - can also one thing you can do to see
24:00 - this here if you want to like if it's in
24:02 - the way you can just click that and
24:04 - it'll take it away okay so you're
24:06 - operating this you can just click that
24:08 - this see that I am teaching a little bit
24:12 - of OBS ok yeah so I need to know your
24:15 - question you want me to come over there
24:16 - alright everybody
24:17 - I'll be right back the computer is very
24:19 - far away I'm gonna walk all the way over
24:21 - there oh my goodness it's such a long
24:23 - journey I'm taking can you still hear me
24:28 - yes ok so which boat is different which
24:35 - one is that that one's different
24:36 - so when you click on it you get what's
24:40 - wrong
24:51 - okay when you click on the wrong one you
24:54 - want the other two to disappear
25:18 - so when you click on the road we have
25:20 - spoke a few let's look at yeah
25:27 - we don't think anybody can hear me over
25:29 - here so it's ironic because oops the
25:35 - maybe we're getting some chow
25:38 - so usually I have a roaming mic but
25:41 - right now this is my bike oh we've got
25:44 - another cat we're gonna help this is by
25:47 - the okay this is Eevee okay I'm coming
25:51 - I'm coming here take Eevee you get you
25:53 - we're gonna go back to the scratch
25:55 - window I just wanna I feel like people
25:57 - need to be able to hear us over here so
25:59 - I have a couple ideas for that so what's
26:34 - the issue which one did you click on
26:48 - to disappear oh okay so we now we
26:52 - understand the problem what you know the
26:56 - solution okay so operator number okay
26:59 - hold on let's make sure we see okay so
27:01 - let's bring the camera back okay so the
27:04 - question to issue is here we're looking
27:06 - at the center bow tie and when you click
27:10 - on the center bowtie the backdrop
27:12 - changes which makes the yeah up here you
27:14 - can go over operator zero and so
27:17 - operator zero is going to help right now
27:19 - and I wonder if I can see the zoom
27:22 - meeting here no I can't
27:27 - and so the solution it seems I would
27:30 - assume is that right now the code says
27:32 - when this sprite is by the way I'm over
27:35 - here because this is where I could see
27:36 - when the sprite is clicked when the
27:41 - sprite is clicked oh what's the message
27:45 - oh broadcast hi oh you're gonna
27:48 - broadcast a message and then the other
27:51 - sprites can hear the message broadcast
27:54 - message in Hyeok enzo in the chat is
27:57 - Kenzo in the chat is giving the same
28:00 - suggestion that operator number zero is
28:03 - actually implementing right now where
28:06 - there's I didn't notice so apparently
28:08 - there's a way in scratch where you can
28:11 - broadcast a message let me go back to
28:14 - see where they're coding this where you
28:16 - can broadcast a message boy I'm really
28:22 - and then I suppose other sprites can
28:26 - hear that message and then hide
28:28 - themselves so can you pull up the
28:35 - project on the main laptop oh that's a
28:38 - good idea so if I go to if I go to the
28:44 - project URL on my laptop
28:50 - I don't know if it's shared I'm doing
28:54 - that right now
28:54 - projects / except this is a really good
28:59 - way of doing it three seven nine nine
29:04 - seven one three eight zero does that
29:08 - work
29:08 - oops our scratch server is this is what
29:12 - I got our scratch server is scratching
29:14 - its head so so far I think maybe the
29:18 - either I got the number wrong or three
29:21 - seven nine can you read that number to
29:23 - me operator zero
29:24 - I need more numbers there's no zero
29:32 - after they a slash editor did you get it
29:38 - to work oh wait so let's watch it can
29:42 - you can you share the project so that I
29:45 - can pull it up do you know how to do
29:47 - that let's shuffle see okay hold I'm
29:50 - going oh you're singing right now
29:54 - so this is alright so what right now
29:58 - this is a quiz a scratch project there's
30:06 - seven Z's and quiz yak it in the chat is
30:13 - pointing up I could just log into I know
30:16 - what a log I don't actually know rotten
30:18 - kitty - oh ones password I bet you I
30:20 - could guess it though I do know it okay
30:24 - apparently I do not so okay ah quiz so
30:32 - now if I hit refresh ah
30:34 - so I've got the project also now on my
30:38 - laptop so I can manipulate it and I
30:41 - think what I'll do also is do this
30:44 - I'm just so it's puts put it here and do
30:49 - this okay so first let's just enjoy this
30:53 - I'm gonna I'm gonna play it
30:59 - what why is it where I brought it up on
31:06 - my screen well I can on your screen I
31:19 - can pull it up oh yeah oh why is it so
31:22 - do you have something when you click
31:24 - maybe did you save it make sure you save
31:27 - it yeah I think maybe it wasn't saved
31:33 - and then Namit if I hit refresh yes
31:39 - okay great I've got it so if I go back
31:42 - to my screen all right I hereby present
31:44 - to you rotten kitties which bowtie is
31:48 - different so rotten kitty you want to
31:51 - come stand over here
31:52 - so give me some give me some and circle
31:56 - so I now need to guess which bowtie is
31:58 - different do we think it is
32:05 - the left one the right one or the center
32:11 - one which one should I pick wait all
32:17 - right let's pick this one I should be
32:19 - like it you do it wrong first okay oh
32:24 - that's good over okay which bowtie is
32:32 - different you want it you want to
32:34 - operate oh hold on oh it okay this is
32:37 - good this is good we'll be here okay
32:39 - which bowtie is different you want to do
32:40 - it oh no can you get another chance yeah
32:51 - we should make it play that sound all
32:53 - right can you what happens if you click
32:54 - the right one now nothing what if you
33:00 - click the center one ah so we need to
33:05 - add code right if I look at the inside
33:08 - so I don't really know scratch so where
33:12 - so basically if we look at these bowties
33:20 - you want you want to operate it here
33:23 - okay oh oh my hold on I think after
33:31 - refresh because I made this
33:34 - you should we just log into your account
33:36 - so you have it here no okay I've lost
33:46 - control of this livestream which is good
33:48 - when the sprite is clicked which sprite
33:51 - I in we're in which one the right or the
33:52 - left
33:52 - oh and then so and so it does that okay
33:57 - so then we have so that's the right
33:59 - bowtie this is the left bowtie is it
34:03 - when the sprite is clicked do that and
34:06 - then which one this is the center one
34:08 - when this sprite is clicked switch
34:10 - costume - bowtie - so where are the
34:14 - costumes are there and so you have
34:19 - Oh both sigh - is a check mark did you
34:22 - draw about yourself know what but how'd
34:24 - you get the bowtie image it's a sprite I
34:29 - know but like it's one of the scratch
34:32 - built-in ones the scratch has has
34:35 - built-in ones okay and then so now and
34:42 - so if you click on this one it switches
34:44 - that and then how it waits a second and
34:46 - goes - yay so let me look at that I want
34:48 - to see that code weight point five
34:52 - seconds broadcast back top three is yeah
35:02 - and you drew that back top three
35:03 - yourself amazing I love that wow this is
35:08 - cool I should learn more of this
35:10 - so I actually I'm saying like I don't
35:13 - know scratch but I do know it a little
35:14 - bit a long long time ago I helped a
35:16 - little bit in scratch on the scratch
35:18 - project itself and I think I wonder if
35:23 - they still have this feature that I
35:25 - implemented I mean I'm sure it's not my
35:27 - implementation anymore because this was
35:28 - almost 20 years ago
35:29 - but our 15 years ago I guess there was
35:33 - like a way to do like a twirly image
35:35 - processing filter have you seen that
35:36 - anywhere no looks maybe yeah that whole
35:45 - book has a million random numbers in it
35:47 - would you like to show it a little bit
35:49 - under the camera over there anyone what
35:53 - I thought what we would do was that I
35:55 - was going to make a scratch project
35:58 - myself my stuff and I thought we could
36:03 - make a thank you card a scratch
36:05 - thank-you card for essential workers and
36:08 - first responders so if what you wanted
36:11 - to do was draw some like a thank-you or
36:14 - draw some things there we could we could
36:17 - bring those into scratch all right so
36:21 - I'm gonna attempt to learn a little
36:22 - scratch with my helpers here whirlpool
36:25 - effect yes that's key on new it's very
36:28 - warm in here what is it half why is it
36:29 - that do
36:30 - I think it's warm in here sweatshirt I
36:33 - was gonna maybe green-screen myself but
36:36 - I'm wearing this green shirt so that's
36:37 - not really gonna work okay so we open a
36:42 - window I feel like kind of warm in here
36:44 - no no there's a cat is that a cat yes
36:49 - the cat is attacking some paper towels
36:51 - under the table here okay so we're
36:54 - getting um alright so what I'm going to
36:57 - do now is I'm going to go to this
37:00 - project see inside and what's the first
37:03 - thing that I should do like if we want
37:07 - it so you're drawing like a thank you so
37:13 - I'll take a snapshot of that and add it
37:19 - into scratch
37:24 - yeah no no I'm waiting so from looking
37:31 - at my looking at my phone which is
37:38 - always what you should be doing when
37:39 - you're live streaming I think I might
37:41 - need some water
37:43 - any operators want to get me a cup of
37:45 - water hmm let's see I'm gonna let you
37:49 - guys draw for a little bit are you
37:51 - actually getting me a cup of water oh
37:54 - okay
37:55 - kids will not do this if I'm not
37:57 - live-streaming
37:58 - so I think Oh tic-tac-toe and scratch
38:01 - that would be fun but so one of the
38:06 - things you know I don't want to I don't
38:12 - want to oversell the meaningfulness of
38:14 - this but I think it's a nice gesture
38:16 - that we can do to think one of the
38:18 - things that I think about when I had to
38:19 - take my little quick trips to the
38:21 - grocery store or take my quick walk
38:23 - around the block to get a little bit of
38:25 - fresh air is I see that sanitation
38:27 - workers are out Restaurant delivery
38:29 - people are out UPS is out all the health
38:33 - care workers are out what is that why is
38:36 - it all cloudy I think it just has like
38:47 - there's probably like a so one of the
38:48 - chat was explained the science behind
38:50 - why my water from our New York City tap
38:53 - water which is excellent is a little bit
38:55 - cloudy but so I I thought that we could
39:05 - make a little thank you to all those
39:07 - health care and essential workers that
39:10 - are first responders that are out so so
39:14 - well done I think I have an idea wait
39:17 - wait stop stop stop pause your drawing
39:18 - pause your drawing is it a thin and
39:20 - scratch pause pause pause pause the
39:23 - trophy everybody stop stop stop pause
39:31 - okay is it if it's a thing right where
39:34 - you can have two different backdrops are
39:37 - you listening to me
39:38 - so if I took a snapshot of what you're
39:41 - drawing now stop drawing stop drawing
39:43 - Rafi now then that can make that a
39:51 - backdrop and you could add a lot of
39:52 - things I'll take another snapshot and
39:55 - then no oh so I should just let you keep
40:02 - drawing okay never mind people so one
40:07 - thing I'm let's see what I could figure
40:08 - out what I need to get a sprite so how
40:11 - do I even import a file so how do I get
40:15 - how do I get the image from that camera
40:18 - onto this laptop hmm oh I know I'll take
40:22 - a picture with my phone okay hold on I
40:25 - know but I just this isn't gonna be the
40:28 - final photo it's just take a picture of
40:31 - it so that I can learn how to bring it
40:33 - into scratch but then I'll take a new
40:35 - picture when it's finished got me know
40:40 - right okay I'm doing it okay so let me
40:52 - airdrop this mmm let's see if that works
41:00 - yep okay so if I have a photo that I
41:08 - took in downloads which is right here
41:11 - and I were to let's just crop this much
41:16 - out of it and now if I save this I
41:22 - assumed how do I bring a photo into
41:26 - scratch you going somewhere
41:28 - okay did you get bored hey lost operator
41:32 - number zero by the way okay
41:34 - so what he needs a break it's good yeah
41:40 - take a break
41:41 - choose a spray upload sprite or is that
41:45 - as it's kind of sprite be a backdrop or
41:47 - that's something different
41:49 - No so if I want it to be the background
41:54 - then I because I want to make those
41:56 - little hearts a let's sprite go to
42:03 - costumes okay the chat is telling me to
42:05 - go to costumes costumes
42:07 - oh so make a new costume whoops oh okay
42:11 - back upload costume so I'm gonna get
42:16 - this image okay you're I know you're not
42:23 - done I'm learning just learning while
42:24 - you're oh wait hold on so people can't
42:28 - see this so let me just switch to this
42:30 - for a second so okay so apparently by
42:35 - the way this is not a scratch tutorial
42:37 - in case because I don't actually know
42:39 - scratch I'm learning scratch and my kids
42:41 - who do know scratch are and some on some
42:43 - level teaching it to me so what I've
42:46 - learned now is that I can upload an
42:50 - image to a thing called a costume and
42:52 - let's call this thank you and I could
42:56 - add things to it
42:57 - I see convert to vector interesting Wow
43:00 - and then click on backdrops in the stage
43:08 - Oh
43:09 - so where's the stage where's the stage
43:12 - stage
43:13 - oh here ah backdrop oh I see okay that's
43:17 - a backdrop okay so it's kind of like a
43:19 - background in p5 so upload backdrop so
43:23 - let's do that that's got it this is a
43:26 - backdrop and we're going to call this
43:28 - thank you one so now I'm gonna go to
43:34 - code and I can just do when there's a
43:42 - thing that the program starts when you
43:43 - cleat when you click the green flag
43:45 - right so we're in which where's that
43:51 - events okay I'm being told breaking news
43:56 - breaking news I'm being told that we had
44:02 - turned the notifications off on my watch
44:04 - here I'm being told that I can find in
44:10 - events when flag clicked so I'm gonna
44:14 - put that here and then where do I switch
44:17 - the backdrop looks okay switch backdrop
44:24 - to thank you one okay so now whenever I
44:30 - click I will get that's my cook now am I
44:33 - not in the code for a sprite right now
44:35 - so if one of the things that I think is
44:37 - different about working in scratch than
44:39 - swimming like p5 is that basically each
44:43 - element can have its own code associated
44:45 - with it and this is actually quite
44:47 - similar to what I do in JavaScript with
44:49 - object-oriented programming I'll make a
44:51 - class that's a template for making
44:53 - objects and those objects will have
44:55 - their own variables and functions and
44:57 - that kind of like it looks like I can
44:59 - have multiple sprites which all have
45:00 - their own functionality but here I think
45:04 - I must not be in a particular sprites
45:06 - code right I'm gonna delete this great
45:09 - this is just like the main program so I
45:12 - can also like play a sound pop let's try
45:15 - this okay fun so and so what I could do
45:23 - is what should I do next so I've got
45:25 - I've got to get to thank you backdrop
45:27 - when it's ready and then I can make some
45:35 - sprites I can play sounds change the
45:37 - pitch
45:38 - should I try but I'm try making a little
45:41 - like firework or a little heart I hear
45:44 - noise is it a cat hold on everybody I've
45:50 - got to rescue the cat from
46:01 - the cat only just see if I could show
46:04 - this to you the cat had this in its
46:07 - mouth which was a twist tie I had for
46:10 - one of my cables here and that seems
46:12 - very dangerous we don't want any cats to
46:15 - have to go to the hospital we don't want
46:17 - anyone to have to go to the hospital but
46:18 - especially now we don't want to take
46:19 - care we want to take up spots that could
46:21 - be that somebody really needs so let's
46:23 - be careful
46:25 - how's the drawing going let's take a
46:27 - look at it everybody let's move it to
46:30 - what do we all think there we go this is
46:34 - beautiful if stars tell me what you
46:39 - think you might be done with it and
46:41 - we'll make it the backdrop add these
46:46 - blocks when flag clicked then change
46:48 - backdrop to back rub one okay okay by
46:57 - the way my water coding trained as you
47:00 - know is sponsored by h2o it's not be
47:04 - cloudy anymore I think I will just drink
47:06 - it
47:12 - it might be time for a break actually
47:16 - okay okay you're still working on it
47:20 - okay the drawing is not finished yet we
47:22 - can check in on it I will bring it up
47:25 - here okay let's see anybody have a bit
47:36 - more sense actually don't ever have any
47:37 - sense as to what's happening or going on
47:39 - but here I am Here I am live streaming
47:44 - from home the drawing is really coming
47:49 - along nicely so I need some suggestions
47:52 - of what else I could add to this car
47:56 - digital card because one thing of course
47:58 - we could just make a drawing which is
48:00 - what's happening right now but I want to
48:07 - add some other things so maybe I just
48:10 - need to learn for me when I'm
48:12 - programming
48:14 - one of the things that I like to start
48:16 - with is how to program a bouncing ball
48:19 - so maybe that's what I will start adding
48:22 - to this sketch and sort of figure out
48:24 - and operator number one over here will
48:27 - help me if I need so let me go back to
48:30 - here so let me add a sprite so I'm gonna
48:34 - call this sprite so I need to make a new
48:38 - sprite oh let's make it a better I make
48:41 - it a basketball do you want to pick oh I
48:44 - like this beach ball
48:46 - what should I add the animals people I
48:51 - can make it a little p5 let's just let's
48:55 - just let me not worry let me make it
48:56 - this beach ball it looks fun so now I
48:59 - will need in order to have this move I
49:02 - need some variables right where do I get
49:05 - variables do you know do you know
49:09 - operator number one what a variable is
49:12 - no shrug emoji the human version of the
49:18 - shrug emoji all right let me let's see
49:22 - under here under variables make a
49:26 - variable let's make a variable called X
49:28 - for this sprite only okay let's make a
49:32 - variable called Y for this sprite only
49:35 - and then let's set the variable to can I
49:40 - get the width of the can I get the width
49:44 - of the canvas in like I'm being told I
49:50 - don't need variables because the sprite
49:52 - itself probably has a position so all
49:56 - right so maybe I don't need these
49:58 - variables because I there's something
50:03 - called like motion maybe how do I move
50:06 - something motion move go to X oh set X
50:12 - to glide OH
50:22 - so I know if you heard that but go-to
50:24 - makes it just disappear and go there and
50:26 - glide makes it glide there all right so
50:29 - oh there's go to random position I kind
50:34 - of want to make fireworks let's see if
50:38 - we can make this beach ball be like a
50:42 - little firework that rises up in bursts
50:46 - so let's have it glide okay great
50:50 - so when so I should go to when the the
50:54 - thingy is clicked what's this called the
50:56 - green flag motion glide oh wow so I
51:03 - don't know I can I don't even have to
51:04 - move it on my own I could say glide for
51:06 - five seconds - well first I want to set
51:08 - it so let's have it go to the bottom of
51:14 - the canvas so I can actually see where
51:16 - it is right now over here oh that's
51:18 - interesting it tells me where it is how
51:21 - do I know the size of the stage is there
51:24 - a way anyone on the chat Oh first of all
51:26 - thank you
51:27 - I don't like thank you - Towanda balance
51:33 - whele if you donated canadian - made a
51:36 - donation for october 19 thank you so so
51:43 - i want to glide - like so I want the X I
51:47 - want the X to be 0 and the Y to be
51:50 - negative like how do I know the height
51:52 - of the stage will somebody tell me the
51:55 - size of the canvas you on who Leon Lopez
51:58 - is saying the size of the canvas is
51:59 - negative 240 - 240 height negative 180 -
52:02 - 180
52:03 - so let's go to negative 180 there's a
52:09 - way to see yeah
52:15 - yeah oh you move your mouse over the
52:19 - canvas it like shows you yeah yeah I was
52:22 - doing that here the canvas is 480 by 360
52:27 - as everybody's telling me okay that's
52:28 - good so then I want to glide to about
52:32 - let's say like negative or 5 seconds
52:37 - let's try running this so I want to
52:42 - implement some nicer physics where it's
52:46 - like bursting up with grab but I won't
52:48 - worry about that right now let's have
52:49 - the glide be much faster let's just say
52:51 - two seconds okay so how do I in scratch
52:58 - create a sprite that's a sing like I
53:01 - want like if I want to do it this I
53:02 - guess I'm jumping like 12 steps ahead
53:04 - from where I am my understanding of
53:07 - scratch but what if I wanted to
53:10 - Oh SEPA in the chest saying if you save
53:13 - it I can follow the project in my
53:14 - computer yes let me do that file save
53:17 - now share so this project is now being
53:22 - shared so let me go back by the way
53:27 - we're gonna livestream until around noon
53:29 - I was gonna take a break at 11:00 I'm
53:31 - just to have a short break in the middle
53:32 - but this is where we are so far so when
53:36 - the green thing is clicked this goes up
53:40 - the back the by the way let's just check
53:42 - in on the drawing can you show the
53:44 - drawing word how where it is so far no
53:46 - okay there we go oh look at it
53:51 - so it's let me move it a little bit this
53:53 - is amazing
53:55 - do you want to make two drawings or I
53:57 - guess we're just how did you do these we
54:08 - have ten of us okay okay
54:10 - you only need a gravity variable you can
54:13 - make clones of spray okay we got another
54:15 - donation from anonymous thank you
54:18 - all right let me go back to the code
54:20 - here all right so
54:23 - [Music]
54:25 - then I guess I want to broadcast a
54:27 - message when it gets to the top and then
54:30 - I want to have a burst of particles so
54:33 - let me and I want to make them stars
54:37 - so let me broad do that broadcast
54:39 - where's the broadcast do you know where
54:44 - do you know where I find the broadcast
54:45 - you know which category is under events
54:55 - under events broadcast message okay
55:00 - okay I got it I got it do you want to I
55:03 - want to okay no patience for me a new
55:11 - message name what's the message name I
55:16 - want to make Bert let's call it a burst
55:19 - okay well let's make them twinkle as
55:22 - they burst okay so I want to broadcast
55:25 - this message burst and then I need to
55:29 - make another sprite which is a star
55:32 - can't deserve some kind of like star
55:34 - perfect let's make it this star and so
55:38 - when it receives a message when it
55:40 - receives a message burst so first when
55:43 - it's clicked I want to hide it which
55:44 - must be under loop looks so hide it when
55:51 - I see you see the receive the message
55:53 - burst show so this is going up and there
55:57 - it appears now it should also set its
56:00 - location to so I do want a variable
56:03 - because I want the Oh actually no I
56:06 - could play sense location to where this
56:08 - the other sprites location is so when I
56:11 - when it receives bursts set set where
56:21 - motion is where I set its location go to
56:24 - and I want to go to a random position
56:26 - now beach ball
56:28 - aha look at that okay so this moves up
56:32 - and then it appears oh good okay so
56:37 - duplicate in event
56:43 - duplicate in events so I want to make
56:46 - lots of stars how do I do that maybe I'm
56:50 - being told in the chat that I duplicate
56:53 - in advance in in events where am i in
56:57 - events so I'm looking here looking for
57:02 - duplicate in costumes there's duplicate
57:09 - let's create a clone of yeah but but I
57:18 - want to duplicate I'm duplicating that
57:20 - start yes yeah oh but I don't want to
57:34 - duplicate the design I want to make
57:35 - actually multiple sprites each with
57:37 - their own behavior but maybe I do want
57:40 - to make different costumes eventually
57:42 - because then I could change their have
57:43 - different colors yeah okay okay okay
57:53 - clone everyone's talking to the check
57:55 - clone is right create a clone of myself
57:57 - now can I do a loop so where's a loop do
58:01 - you know what a loop is oh I mean I it's
58:07 - called a repeat in scratch you know what
58:10 - repeat does but what does repeat do
58:18 - I know but what does that mean to repeat
58:20 - maybe people don't know what that means
58:22 - I know what it means I'm asking you to
58:25 - explain it so I want to make multiple
58:29 - clones uh-huh so that's gonna do and
58:35 - create clone of myself you know ten is
58:43 - good to start with or what do you how
58:44 - many do you think well then I'm gonna
58:48 - make a lot 30 okay now so let's see what
58:56 - happens so I guess there's 30 stars but
59:03 - they're all on top of each other by the
59:07 - way can I just show off my mug here for
59:09 - a second no I know no it's not that mug
59:13 - it's a different bug but I have a mug
59:19 - that I'm obsessed with I talk about it
59:22 - all the time how much I love it I have
59:24 - multiple of them I have my like travel
59:26 - one mine home one my work one now I
59:28 - don't have a need for all those mugs did
59:30 - you know all the time I just need my own
59:32 - mug mug I should be so how lucky is to
59:34 - have a home mug but that's not the mug
59:37 - I'm going to talk about the mug I'm
59:38 - going to talk about today is this one it
59:41 - is how do I get it to focus on it there
59:43 - we go this is my geometry mug and if I
59:46 - ever need to remember the area or
59:48 - circumference wonder if I do this I
60:08 - believe I park in the UK I really enjoy
60:17 - traveling and visiting other places and
60:20 - I'm sad to not be doing that right now
60:22 - but I'm very very happy to do my small
60:26 - tiny part by staying at home and I hope
60:29 - everybody is
60:31 - healthy and okay and doing well and
60:34 - staying at home as well if you can okay
60:37 - so let's see so now what I also want to
60:41 - do is give them a random velocity in
60:48 - different directions so point in
60:53 - direction oh look at this so I could
60:56 - really think oh I'm I don't see you
60:58 - don't see my screen right now I could
60:59 - really point in a random direction
61:05 - how do I make a random oh how do I put
61:11 - something random in here under variables
61:14 - can I make a random variable where do I
61:19 - pick a random number between 0 and do
61:25 - you know how to pick a random number
61:28 - well in I could pick a random number in
61:30 - my head but I don't want to type it in I
61:33 - want the computer program to pick a
61:35 - random number so that all of the
61:37 - different stars all get their own random
61:40 - direction I could do them I could count
61:49 - yes but I kind of want to have them
61:51 - there's got to be up like under
61:55 - variables I mean I know I could make a
61:58 - variable and then set it to a random
62:00 - value I would think
62:03 - in events random okay I'm being told
62:06 - events random control sensing where I
62:15 - don't see a random under event you're
62:21 - done with the drawing okay wait so let's
62:24 - operators I'm being told Oh pick random
62:28 - here it is sorry this is in here so in
62:31 - operators I can take this and I can pick
62:34 - a random point and direction between 0
62:37 - and 360 so they would all point in
62:41 - different directions let's even see just
62:43 - what that does
62:45 - hmm I don't know if that worked like do
62:50 - they I mean like will it create a clone
62:55 - I want to collect create their clone and
62:57 - then all have them points in their own
62:58 - render well it did it did look they're
63:01 - all pointing in different directions
63:02 - what I'm trying to make a burst of stars
63:05 - come out first
63:19 - yeah that's what I'm gonna do
63:21 - oh yeah I didn't do the hide yet I'm
63:25 - gonna do I'm gonna hide the beach ball
63:27 - once the stars
63:32 - yeah that's exactly my idea well I
63:37 - haven't gotten to the movie yet all I
63:39 - did was create 30 of them
63:41 - should we put your let's see your thank
63:43 - you let's get a better picture of your
63:44 - thank you drawing so everybody here
63:47 - we've got the final thank you drawing
63:49 - you could take a break yeah I think I'm
63:51 - off my own people
63:54 - I'm on my own they lasted an hour which
64:04 - is pretty good yeah I'm gonna take a
64:07 - break in a minute
64:08 - don't ask me these questions okay thank
64:24 - you
64:29 - Wow
64:30 - this is really something just thank you
64:33 - so let me airdrop it and I'm gonna bring
64:43 - in this safety downloads so let me go to
64:47 - where do I go to costumes coding there
64:55 - we go let me go to costumes no backdrops
65:01 - backdrops this one so can I just delete
65:04 - it and then upload a picture
65:11 - oh no no back I want to get the final
65:14 - drawing oh wait hold on so let me show
65:15 - you all the final drawing
65:19 - let me guess kind of crop it close
65:29 - enough Oh text-based YouTube is saying
65:36 - do when I start as cloned and point in
65:39 - directions 0 to 360 Oh
65:41 - negative 180 to 180 not 360 okay either
65:45 - when I start as clone oh there's a when
65:48 - I start as cloned event okay I got it
65:51 - everybody so I'm going to let me first
65:55 - get this backdrop that was drawn I think
66:02 - this is it here okay great so I wonder
66:06 - if there's a more thoughtful that's fine
66:09 - I'm gonna leave it like this and I'm
66:12 - gonna go back to oh this is a new
66:14 - backdrop I wanted this to be alright I
66:16 - thought I was replacing it but let's
66:18 - just delete this one hold on thank you
66:21 - it's just ah thank you
66:23 - and we'll delete this one and then if I
66:27 - go to the code switch backdrop to thank
66:31 - you okay so then let me just fix this
66:38 - one thing
66:38 - under the star sprite so when I start as
66:42 - clone is that an event when I receive
66:51 - burst when I start as clone is that
66:55 - under control uh here we go yeah when I
66:59 - start as clone and then pick random
67:02 - negative 180 to 180 is awesome
67:09 - okay people give me a lot of excellent
67:16 - suggestions there's a shadow on the
67:18 - picture there is uh I'll try to take a
67:20 - better picture I have all these nice
67:22 - lights on here I should be able to get a
67:28 - much nicer picture which I will do all
67:30 - right let me take a short break I'm
67:33 - gonna hit this little intermission and
67:37 - take a short break just to sort of check
67:38 - on what happened to my operators I'm
67:40 - gonna mute my microphone and be back in
67:43 - about five minutes let's see if I can
67:48 - find the original here we go so let me
67:57 - put this I only put this here and let me
68:01 - just cross this out doesn't work
68:17 - Oh sharpies sharpies oh here's my shirt
68:27 - I'm gonna say back in five minutes okay
68:33 - everybody I will be back take a short
68:36 - break get some water and be right back
68:40 - all right see you soon

75:30 - Lord everybody I am coming back
75:33 - [Music]
75:46 - I don't think I properly introduced
75:49 - Eevee before so this was easy
75:52 - let me turn off the music Evie Evie is a
75:57 - calico little cat here
75:59 - Evie was born Evie is greta's sister was
76:03 - also born apparently in July I don't see
76:05 - how that's possible I think it was much
76:07 - more recent than that but I don't know
76:09 - what do I know she's a sweetheart she
76:12 - likes to think that she thinks that my
76:13 - beard is another cat so she likes to pie
76:17 - and lick it and all that sort of stuff
76:23 - [Music]
76:32 - you don't what you want to go sleep with
76:35 - your sister I woke you up I know
76:43 - okay okay I'll let you go alright
76:46 - everyone we're gonna finish working on
76:47 - this thank you card and I have something
76:49 - I have something very innovative that I
76:51 - want to show which is that I had you
76:53 - actually have a green screen so I will
76:54 - attempt that um evolve
76:57 - Evie to sylveon yes um Evie is named for
77:01 - the Pokemon Eevee but also I believe the
77:04 - Eevee from the descendants so it's a
77:07 - little bit of a combination but spelled
77:09 - I spell Evie's name EE Vee okay so here
77:16 - we are back again I am working on a
77:21 - scratch project let me go back to here
77:25 - which is a thank you card to essential
77:29 - workers and first responders a digital
77:31 - thank you card and my kids were making
77:34 - this with me they got bored I think
77:36 - frankly I think they're downstairs
77:37 - playing roblox right now if I'm being
77:39 - perfectly honest it's almost time for
77:40 - lunch we are all together 24/7 it's
77:45 - actually kind of delightful and amazing
77:47 - but a very strange different time will
77:50 - say like it's a little it's interesting
77:52 - like I I have felt a lot of stress this
77:56 - week because I really wanted to
77:57 - livestream
77:58 - I kind of realized like I can't because
78:03 - I've got to become a third grade and if
78:06 - it's great teacher
78:07 - so we've I think we've finally sort of
78:09 - adjusted to this new routine of school
78:11 - happening at home all their meals
78:13 - happening at home making sure we get a
78:15 - little time outside everyday a little
78:16 - physical exercise I've got a lot of work
78:18 - to keep up with I'm teaching three
78:20 - classes and NYU which have all kind of
78:23 - gone remote so I actually really haven't
78:27 - had time to livestream but I'm hoping
78:30 - that I can get into a routine and then I
78:32 - can get this set up working well and
78:33 - kind of do more and get back to my old
78:36 - tricks of tutorials keep it down keep it
78:41 - down downstairs go change my shirt in a
78:50 - minute to try to try a tutor so I can
78:57 - try the green screen but okay all right
79:00 - so we are back I'm trying so I think I
79:03 - would actually really like to do some
79:05 - proper scratch tutorials that maybe kids
79:08 - who are learning at home could follow
79:10 - but again that's not what I'm doing
79:11 - right now I'm kind of doing a completely
79:13 - unplanned just sort of hacking around
79:17 - and trying to figure my way through
79:18 - making a little burst of fireworks in
79:21 - scratch so what I have so far is I have
79:24 - a backdrop so the stage so I have the
79:28 - stage when the green flag is clicked I
79:31 - switch the backdrop to thank you so I
79:33 - only have this one backdrop right now oh
79:36 - maybe I could color it there's I have so
79:40 - many ideas so when the green flag is
79:44 - quick click switch the backdrop to thank
79:46 - you okay then I have two sprites I have
79:49 - this beach ball sprite which when the
79:52 - green flag is clicked it starts at the
79:54 - bottom and then glides for two seconds
79:56 - up to here and then broadcast a message
79:58 - called burst and when that message
80:00 - bursts is broadcast the idea is that
80:03 - pool a whole set of stars will come
80:07 - glittering around the screen with
80:09 - happiness and rainbows and
80:13 - all right so and we got another donation
80:16 - anonymous donation to the UN foundation
80:19 - thank you very much
80:20 - with your donation you have won your own
80:25 - personal random number and a close-up
80:30 - view of me with my random number book
80:35 - one hundred thousand normal devious
80:39 - let's let's find out your random number
80:45 - anonymous your random number for today
80:48 - is 90 thousand and eighty one thank you
80:54 - alright so we broadcast the message
80:57 - burst and then when the that message
81:03 - burst is broadcast we have another
81:05 - sprite which is a star and we show it we
81:10 - move it to the beach balls location we
81:12 - create 30 of them which is making a
81:14 - clone and then I give them a random
81:18 - Direction and I want them to move then
81:22 - also so move test so I could do the
81:27 - glide to a random position let's just
81:30 - try that for a second let's see what
81:33 - happens
81:37 - ooh I like that so it's not exactly a
81:42 - firework effect um and why is there one
81:45 - oh so let me hide this one so I don't
81:49 - want that one to stay in the middle so
81:52 - let me do let me take this original one
81:55 - and hide it which is under looks again
81:58 - um right
82:01 - is it under looks hide show hide yeah so
82:06 - let me try to oh so I don't actually
82:09 - want to show it I don't need to hide it
82:12 - I just don't want to show it so when I
82:17 - receiver bursts go to the beach ball
82:21 - repeat 30 create a clone and then when
82:24 - it starts as a clone show point and
82:26 - glide here we go and that's pretty good
82:36 - let's see could do move steps plus
82:38 - repeat loops okay you can make the
82:41 - sprites walk for which means it will go
82:43 - in the direction they're facing that's
82:44 - what I wanted to do so I just wanted to
82:46 - see what Glide did that's a quick way of
82:48 - getting them to move so I'm gonna take
82:50 - that out and go back to motion and I'm
82:52 - gonna say move ten steps let's see what
82:56 - that does
82:57 - okay so that's interesting so
83:00 - interesting this repeat loop it's really
83:05 - like it's giving a little delay with
83:07 - each one what if I want to create all
83:09 - the clones at once like I don't want
83:11 - this repeat loop to I don't want to see
83:13 - it play out I want it to all to happen
83:15 - at once how would I is there a way to
83:19 - change that maybe somebody in the chat
83:21 - will let me know but for now I'm gonna
83:23 - do I'm gonna do another repeat loop
83:26 - control repeat and move ten steps let's
83:34 - see what happens here
83:37 - yeah oh look at that it's a nice perfect
83:41 - circle that's good I don't want to hide
83:45 - the beach ball go to beach ball where
83:48 - where's the beach balls code so
83:52 - broadcast burst and also hide I don't
83:58 - know where anything is I have to like
84:00 - find it constantly hide here okay so you
84:11 - can't make it instant yes you can
84:14 - blocks may still have a delay well it's
84:16 - one frame you can add a delay people
84:19 - stop saying it is impossible it pretty
84:21 - much is there's a lot of disagreement
84:22 - going on in the chat right now so we'll
84:26 - see I'll wait for something more
84:27 - definitive to come through but I guess
84:31 - what I could do is I know what I could
84:34 - do I mean this is a little bit of a hack
84:37 - but if I go back to the star and I could
84:44 - oh when I start as a clone like I don't
84:51 - want them I was gonna try to show them
84:54 - after all the clones were created but
84:57 - that didn't seem to do anything there is
84:59 - a delay but well I'm not what I'm not
85:02 - talking about is the framerate here so I
85:05 - understand that there is a maximum frame
85:08 - rate which is the amount of the the time
85:11 - it take the amount of frames the amount
85:13 - of animation frames that can be updated
85:15 - it with a given unit of time like a
85:17 - second but there's no reason why I
85:19 - couldn't decide that I want in one frame
85:22 - to have thirty things up here so maybe I
85:27 - need to create the clones I I think what
85:32 - I want to do actually is create the I
85:34 - have an idea I'm gonna create the clones
85:36 - at the beginning hide and create the
85:40 - clones and then when they receive the
85:43 - bursts so is there a way will this work
85:50 - like the clones are being created right
85:52 - now yeah there we go I got it so I just
85:55 - make all the clones earlier yeah and the
85:58 - beach ball needs to have a show at the
86:01 - beginning so this worked so I don't know
86:05 - if I sort of figured it out and so
86:07 - basically what I want to do is create
86:09 - all of those clones at the beginning of
86:11 - the program and that's gonna it's gonna
86:13 - happen 60 frames per second in the
86:15 - background but they're all ready and
86:16 - they're all gonna receive that first
86:18 - message they're all operating with the
86:20 - same code so then I get a full burst all
86:23 - at once there we go so I want to give
86:27 - them a different speed so let's I go I'm
86:32 - gonna add a variable been avoiding
86:34 - variables so let's make a variable for
86:38 - this sprite only called speed now
86:41 - hopefully they're all gonna get their
86:42 - own version of that variable and we're
86:45 - gonna set speed set speed to a random
86:51 - number which is under operators I'm
86:53 - learning here people I'm learning pick
86:56 - between one let's pick between 10 and 20
86:59 - then they're gonna move by speed so
87:05 - we're gonna move instead by speed so
87:07 - let's try this now uh-oh that wasn't
87:14 - good mmm oh I guess this oh this needs
87:23 - to happen first so I need to make that
87:25 - variable pick the value and then clone
87:27 - them are they all gonna get the same
87:28 - number though no perfect oh wait they
87:31 - all got the same number shoot
87:36 - can I do this what if I set the speed
87:41 - here
87:46 - there we go okay so as long as I set the
87:50 - speed after the clones have been made
87:52 - then I should be good
87:55 - I'm Stig is actually in the chat
87:58 - well future episodes of the coding train
87:59 - at home always focus on scratch no I
88:02 - mean I don't know if I'm gonna call it
88:03 - coding train at home or that's really a
88:06 - thing that's just what I called it for
88:07 - today I mean because for the foreseeable
88:09 - future coda crania it's just always
88:10 - gonna be coding training at home and
88:12 - it's going to be the same sort of stuff
88:14 - that I do I just thought for today I
88:16 - will do some scratch stuff how do I I
88:17 - don't want to see this variable I mean
88:19 - it's kind of nice to see that there how
88:21 - do i but that's to me like a little bit
88:23 - of a debug view can I get rid of that
88:26 - whoops no no undo undo there we go thank
88:29 - you okay so now how do I give these
88:34 - things gravity I heard that make them
88:39 - smaller in the clone loop yeah I
88:41 - absolutely should but I think I can also
88:43 - just pick the star right can I just go
88:50 - here and make it smaller how do I change
88:54 - the size or I must there must be like a
88:55 - set a size looks set size to 25% let's
89:04 - try that yeah okay and let's let's make
89:10 - it 50% let's make a hundred and 50 of
89:13 - them
89:16 - whoa why did they all oh because it took
89:20 - it took longer to make them
89:23 - I think huh that's interesting if I'm it
89:31 - well let's not make so many then I'll
89:33 - figure that out later
89:35 - okay that's good so the beach ball also
89:39 - I feel like the size should be probably
89:46 - half its size also
89:50 - okay there we go now uncheck the
89:53 - checkbox maybe that's the thing to like
89:55 - not have the variable being seen okay
90:01 - there we go
90:02 - so the variable exists but it's not seen
90:03 - that's good to know did not know that
90:06 - okay let's try to give another backdrop
90:14 - oh wait I have an idea why don't I get a
90:18 - coding train back up backdrop give me a
90:21 - second here let me just find I'm gonna
90:24 - download my coding train does that back
90:29 - back drop the coding train I'm so sorry
90:34 - you can't see this right now I'm just
90:35 - deep into my Google Drive wallpaper
90:37 - [Music]
90:41 - unicorn scene catch a ride let's try
90:44 - this one
90:48 - download okay so now hopefully that
90:52 - downloaded and we can get back to here
90:55 - whoops back to here so let me also up
90:59 - whoops
91:02 - upload this one okay that's a coding
91:10 - train back drop oh wait no did I or can
91:16 - I not make more than oh no I have them
91:18 - thank you
91:19 - and then this one's called coding train
91:21 - can you hear by the can by the way can
91:23 - you hear the pitter-patter of the rain I
91:26 - don't think we can hear that change the
91:29 - ball to a rocket okay it's not a bad
91:31 - idea
91:31 - coding train so now let's see if I go to
91:42 - code and we start with coding train
91:45 - backdrop and then when I receive the
91:52 - message when I receive burst switch
91:58 - backdrop what's this and
92:03 - oh this way switch backdrop - thank you
92:10 - it's nice guy leave the can I just add a
92:13 - backdrop like could I just overlay the
92:16 - backdrop
92:17 - I guess this I could make it a sprite
92:20 - and I could just show it but if you make
92:24 - a broadcast after the create loop then
92:27 - you will know and they are created oh
92:28 - that's a great point yeah that's a great
92:32 - point okay so how do I the next thing I
92:34 - want to do is add some gravity this is
92:38 - used to make this more serious no not
92:40 - that kind of gravity so also I'd like to
92:46 - make them different colors change color
92:48 - effect by set color effect
92:51 - what's a color effect change color oh no
92:57 - that would be in the star yeah
93:03 - can I pick another random I don't know
93:05 - what this is gonna do I'm just gonna
93:09 - make a guess like does that do something
93:13 - yeah I like that okay now I've got
93:15 - colorful stars and I want them to fade
93:20 - away and burst out but I uh can I add
93:24 - some under motion so let's see if on
93:29 - edge bounce is there like an automatic
93:31 - gravity well I could have them rotate or
93:37 - do I need to implement my own physics
93:41 - see this is why I thought I've changed
93:46 - wha oh I could change Y by if I add a
93:51 - little changing Y will that accumulate
93:54 - like gravity
94:02 - not really
94:14 - kind of not really
94:18 - let's see gravity you need your own
94:22 - physics no gravity okay so maybe right
94:26 - now given that it's already 11:35 I'll
94:30 - come back ooh look at that
94:32 - oh it stops at the edge to not stop at
94:36 - the edge oh but I could at least have
94:38 - them accelerate so I could I know what I
94:43 - could do set the speed to between zero
94:48 - let's actually set the speed to zero
94:51 - well let's give it an initial speed
94:53 - between zero and five and then change so
95:00 - how do I add how do I increment a
95:03 - variable variables change my variable so
95:11 - this would be some physics speed by can
95:15 - I do like little bits like that yeah so
95:20 - that gives it more of a burr of like a
95:22 - bursting out if I like give them a
95:24 - little bit of an acceleration I like
95:30 - that oh I could clone the beach ball
95:35 - oh no can i I don't think I can do that
95:41 - you should change the beach ball to a
95:43 - balloon okay how do I change the costume
95:48 - I mean I could just draw my own thing
95:53 - actually what I want to do is get one of
95:55 - the little hearts so I think what would
95:58 - be better is for me to get elements of
96:00 - the drawing where's that drawing here we
96:05 - go so let me put the drawing back here I
96:07 - gotta get a better picture of it
96:10 - just so you can see it I'm gonna put it
96:12 - here
96:14 - and I so okay let's see here here's the
96:21 - drawing I'm gonna get my light a light
96:27 - this is very silly am I really going to
96:32 - do I really need to get a light here why
96:37 - not right this is very silly but I don't
96:45 - have the plug for this light so I have
96:50 - these rechargeable batteries that I'm
96:52 - gonna put in okay see if this works well
97:05 - explosion is a decrease in speed it's so
97:08 - right about that I need to change that
97:11 - to a decrease in speed totally gonna do
97:14 - that just get this late to get better
97:19 - images of this drawing to work with a
97:21 - sprites will this go on
97:25 - now yes alright we have light by the way
97:30 - I know if anybody can guess what you're
97:32 - seeing here oh and if anybody in the
97:34 - chat knows oh you can't see oh yeah
97:36 - here's a challenge - there's a couple
97:39 - challenges here one is why is there a
97:44 - halo blackhole circle here and two is
97:49 - does anybody recognize this particular
97:52 - it's a print so if you could read if you
97:56 - could zoom way in I don't know how I'm
97:58 - not doing this in 4k or anything the
98:00 - answer would be right over here in the
98:01 - corner okay so let's get a light on the
98:06 - drawing okay let's go over here
98:16 - let's see I know if you can hear the
98:27 - background noise coming from downstairs
98:29 - all right so I've got the thank you
98:31 - drawing there I've got some light on it
98:33 - so I can get a better photo
98:36 - ah Stig Stig Stig in the chat got the
98:45 - drawing I'll be not the drawing to print
98:47 - thank you it is in fact all this is all
98:50 - of the streets in the lower 448 united
98:54 - states an image of over 240 million
98:56 - individual Road segments Savin info /all
99:00 - streets so if I just go here for a
99:02 - second to fathom info /all streets it is
99:08 - this this is the print you know I have
99:11 - actually a lot of I guess look digital
99:17 - art and a lot of prints and various art
99:20 - pieces that I've collected over the
99:21 - years other people have sent me other
99:23 - than I bought this one just happens to
99:25 - be hanging here different ones and hang
99:28 - a different one for different live
99:29 - streams but that's there okay let me
99:32 - come back to with this project and let
99:38 - me get back to here so I should be able
99:51 - to get a nice screen capture of and then
99:55 - I should be able to edit out the little
99:57 - hearts and stars so that's what I want
100:04 - to do so should I try to take another
100:06 - picture on my phone
100:07 - alright we tried this okay let me try oh
100:14 - yeah this is better there's no shadows
100:16 - no this picture off my phone is going to
100:20 - actually come out quite nicely so let me
100:23 - do this
100:26 - and I'm gonna get a new image airdrop
100:31 - here okay we've got 20 minutes left for
100:42 - this project here I mean I have I have
100:45 - all day in a way but I've got to get to
100:46 - other stuff these kids need to eat lunch
100:48 - they need to get up and eat it they need
100:50 - to not be on their screens all day long
101:00 - okay although it is raining today so
101:04 - we're not gonna be able to get very much
101:06 - outside time keeping our safe six-foot
101:10 - distance from everyone anyone else I
101:12 - mean we there are very few people on the
101:14 - streets these days in Brooklyn but
101:16 - taking a walk around the block is
101:17 - something that I personally feel like I
101:19 - really need to do well today okay yeah I
101:23 - think that's meant to be a Red Cross
101:24 - like because we're thanking first
101:26 - responders yeah all right so first let
101:34 - me fix in the star in the code I wanted
101:38 - to give them a really big speed at first
101:41 - like 20 to 30 and then change speed by
101:45 - negative 2 we wanted to slow down so
101:48 - let's try this
101:51 - whoa
101:53 - so and then we don't want it to go past
101:56 - zero so constrain variable operators is
102:02 - there a constrain if like a conditional
102:06 - control if if so if and then operators
102:14 - if speed is less than zero so I'll go
102:20 - back to my variables if speed is less
102:24 - than zero then set speed to zero
102:32 - ah sorry you couldn't see change scene
102:41 - I'm sorry about that I'm not used to my
102:42 - new setup not that I don't make that
102:43 - mistake always okay so that's just now
102:47 - let me get my new picture because this
102:49 - backdrop so how do I get to the
102:51 - backdrops backdrops let's delete this
102:55 - one let's delete this one oh I see what
102:58 - I could do let's first of all can i why
103:03 - is this not taking up the whole can I do
103:06 - this or is that just zooming in on it
103:09 - how do I change the size of this image
103:16 - that I that I loaded in to just zoom in
103:19 - on it know how to manipulate anything
103:21 - all right let me delete this let's try
103:24 - it let's let's try adding some new back
103:26 - ah ah I don't understand how to operate
103:31 - scratch okay upload back drop this one
103:36 - so how can I quickly just like zoom in
103:41 - on it so that it does this do something
103:45 - that's just zooming in so I can like see
103:47 - it right convert it to vector all right
103:53 - oh I see all right okay okay that's good
104:01 - then it's a little bit like the resizing
104:06 - is doesn't look so great but I'm not
104:08 - going to worry about that
104:09 - let's hit let's save then now add up
104:17 - look oh I can I can take a picture with
104:19 - my camera let's try this oh I should
104:25 - have I should have done something
104:32 - all right let me delete this one let me
104:34 - open that up
104:42 - [Music]
104:51 - okay that's a little better thank you
104:57 - converting to vector maybe was a bad
105:01 - idea okay so now let's try let's try
105:11 - uploading a new backdrop oh wait I think
105:15 - what I could do is duplicate this one
105:17 - right duplicate and then can I add
105:22 - another image on top like how do i how
105:28 - do I add and oh I could convert it back
105:30 - to bitmap there we go is that better and
105:34 - then what if i duplicate it can i load
105:40 - another image on top
105:54 - I don't David Schneider is asking how
105:59 - long past noon will you go my intention
106:01 - was to be done at noon but I would like
106:04 - to at least put a little bow on this and
106:06 - kind of wrap things up all right I'm not
106:09 - gonna worry so much we'll just change
106:11 - add a new costume and copy paste it on
106:13 - top okay got it
106:16 - where do I do costumes cuz backdrops her
106:22 - backdrops and costumes are different
106:23 - right costumes Oh
106:29 - I can add a costume here copy and paste
106:35 - okay let's all right let's try doing it
106:37 - within the backdrops
106:39 - so this one is coding train we're going
106:43 - to duplicate it and then I'm going to
106:48 - upload this copy go to here paste ah
106:56 - there we go okay so then this one is
106:59 - thank you okay so we start with and I I
107:10 - guess I missed the bottom oh well
107:13 - alright so now we're going back to the
107:15 - code it's not perfect we're going back
107:18 - to the code when switch backdrop to
107:21 - coding train switch backdrop to thank
107:23 - you okay
107:24 - oh whoops so then go to backdrops again
107:30 - well that's coding trained to convert to
107:39 - vector again oh dear
107:42 - all right let me start over I think I
107:44 - understand how to do this now so I'm
107:48 - going to I'm going to upload this one
107:55 - I'm gonna call this coding train oh
107:58 - there's copy and paste right there
108:00 - convert to vector bring this to the top
108:04 - oh no I don't want to stretch it let's
108:09 - do this so now bring it over here
108:13 - convert back to bitmap then dupli-color
108:20 - son coding train then duplicate it and
108:26 - then grab this and paste it in there we
108:31 - go
108:33 - okay so now is this is and this is the
108:40 - thang
108:41 - you keep it down down there kids you
108:51 - kids with your roadblocks okay so let's
108:56 - see coding training thank you
108:58 - whoops okay so here we go
109:04 - starts with coding train and thank you
109:07 - okay so could I possibly I haven't I
109:14 - have another idea which is let's go back
109:19 - to the star when the speed is set to
109:22 - zero can you I can make a function right
109:25 - I can make a function right so what if
109:31 - at the beginning like I want to make a
109:37 - function that's this where do I do that
109:41 - my blocks make a block no idle is that
109:46 - is that how to make a function I don't
109:53 - actually need them to keep it down I was
109:55 - just trying to be silly because what I
109:59 - was thinking I was gonna do is reset
110:01 - their positions
110:02 - let me not worry about that right now so
110:07 - because let me actually do it let me
110:09 - just do it this way I guess there
110:10 - because I cloned them move speed steps
110:14 - change speed by a speed is zero set
110:17 - speed back to a random number let's just
110:21 - do it this way pick a random number
110:23 - again between 20 and 30 set the go to
110:29 - beach ball I just want them to do it
110:33 - again go to beach ball
110:40 - and then oh but then I want them to go
110:43 - back and do do this again oh I do need a
110:47 - function yeah I do need a function
110:52 - alright maybe this is getting too fancy
110:53 - with what time I have oh repeat until
110:58 - let's change that okay I gotcha this is
111:02 - better there's a repeat until so let's
111:05 - go into operators of control repeat
111:08 - until and then operators repeat until
111:15 - this speed is less than zero variables
111:22 - speed is less than zero so let's get rid
111:25 - of this this is better
111:26 - and then so I want this to be a function
111:30 - because I want to call that function
111:32 - again can I even recursively do
111:35 - something like that
111:36 - Oh repeat forever oh yeah yes of course
111:44 - I could just do repeat forever and then
111:46 - actually do that alright of course let
111:48 - me do it that way it's funny how am I
111:50 - like bringing the logic of my brain
111:51 - doesn't understand these possibilities
111:53 - so repeat until would be great to use
111:56 - but I'm actually going to change to
111:58 - repeat forever which is just forever
112:02 - move speed by negative two and then if I
112:12 - need an if statement again not under
112:16 - operators that's under control
112:18 - if back to speed being less than zero
112:24 - and I need variables back to speed being
112:29 - less than zero then set the speed again
112:33 - can I copy a block no I mean I can't
112:37 - copy an individual I'll just I'll just
112:39 - do it man set the speed back to
112:42 - something random again pick random
112:50 - and then set the location under motion
112:56 - go to beach ball because now if we think
113:03 - about this it's going to just move move
113:06 - move move and then the speed I should
113:08 - give it a new random Direction too so I
113:11 - might as well give point in Direction
113:13 - also but let's just try this so okay let
113:16 - me explain this okay the idea here is
113:18 - that we're looking at the code over here
113:20 - I want to always forever just move move
113:23 - move I could make a diagram let's see
113:27 - here let's see how this works these each
113:43 - one of these stars has a speed and the
113:49 - speed is some random amount like let's
113:51 - say it's 10 so it's moving by 10 and
113:53 - moving by 9 they're moving by 8 and
113:55 - moving by 7 it's doing this forever it's
113:58 - always moving by it's always moving by
114:01 - whatever that speed is at some point the
114:03 - speed is going to end up at 0 when that
114:06 - does reset the speed back to 10 reset it
114:10 - back to here but it's still in a forever
114:12 - loop so it's going to do that again so I
114:14 - could give it a new direction a new
114:15 - color all those things but I think that
114:18 - this should work so if I go back to here
114:22 - let's try this
114:30 - when they get out of sync because the
114:34 - repeat loop doesn't happen I could do
114:36 - all of that and then wait to move them
114:38 - but this is actually kind of nice so I
114:40 - should give them new directions and a
114:42 - new color let's give them change the
114:47 - color effect so where's that under looks
114:51 - let's also do I could change the color
114:55 - effect change the color effect by an
115:06 - also random can anybody tell me what
115:11 - this color effect is I actually don't
115:14 - know so this should give them new colors
115:24 - I don't know if it's doing that I think
115:27 - it's doing that and then also give them
115:28 - a new direction point in direction which
115:32 - is blue so that's under motion point in
115:37 - direction it's also give them a new
115:40 - random direction by the way this really
115:43 - needs a
116:05 - they're coming out of the you in what
116:08 - now I feel like they should fade can I
116:11 - have them fade away hmm all right maybe
116:15 - I'm making this too complicated all
116:20 - right it changes the color of effect
116:21 - it's it's set color effect not change
116:23 - color effect they work the same but it
116:26 - is cooler so I should set the color
116:28 - effect not change color effect set color
116:34 - effect where was that where was it it's
116:42 - purple which is looks set color effect
116:47 - let's try that how do I get just come on
116:56 - okay move this away so let's try set
117:01 - color effect to a random I'm just assume
117:14 - maybe it's like you so like between 0
117:16 - and 360 let's try this okay that's
117:24 - pretty good thank you Bruno
117:31 - can you set ghosts to multiple of speed
117:35 - okay what's ghost is that kind of
117:40 - transparency go to front layer costume
117:47 - background I don't know what ghost is
117:49 - where is this but I think one of the
117:58 - things I wanted to do is just try to get
118:00 - to cut out these hearts so what if I get
118:05 - a fine here if I go in here and go under
118:07 - costumes can I
118:12 - open up get like one of these stars like
118:19 - what if I get this copy and paste ooh
118:22 - that didn't work so let me let me also
118:33 - see if I can make this there we go let's
118:38 - try that I'm not gonna wear that oh
118:45 - that's good Auto levels let's try that
118:47 - all right let's keep that hit save this
118:51 - is the star let's go to desktop so now
119:00 - if I were to add a costume and go to
119:06 - desktop star okay it's so big
119:13 - can I do that convert to vector thing
119:15 - and make it smaller
119:18 - oops
119:28 - I guess Photoshop would be my friend
119:30 - here I'm not making it smaller am i
119:40 - there we go
119:41 - that's making it small all right no just
119:43 - moving it isn't it making it smaller yes
119:47 - it is okay we're getting there people
119:50 - okay now convert to bitmap eraser whoa
119:58 - they make this like ten so I can erase
120:04 - around it
120:16 - ghost effect okay there's a ghost effect
120:19 - I see that's under effects ah
120:23 - that's fine I'm doing my best here
120:27 - people okay to make this transparent and
120:37 - I could make multiple costumes running
120:40 - out of time here people to make this a
120:48 - bigger just for a second because I think
120:50 - there are little spots that I missed why
121:00 - is this sprite like got so much space to
121:05 - it alright let's see what happens here
121:09 - okay now so I've got this star and can I
121:15 - just delete this costume there we go
121:17 - okay so now what happens if I do this
121:21 - house run again yeah I've got the stars
121:28 - from from the actual drawing that's
121:31 - better I think it should be out of the
121:34 - center and it's way too fast so let's go
121:37 - back here let's have the the the beach
121:45 - ball glide - where's the center a zero
121:52 - let's try that
122:01 - okay um all right so I think this
122:07 - project is could use a lot I want to
122:11 - make the Stars throw the ghost effect I
122:13 - wanted to try that so let I want to
122:15 - learn what other effects besides color
122:17 - there is so if we go to looks and change
122:23 - oh there's other effects a world I think
122:26 - this is the I think this is what I
122:27 - worked on some of these these are the
122:29 - things I worked on so I think it was
122:33 - around 2003 or 2004 I was in Boston for
122:36 - a little bit hanging out and working
122:38 - with some of the scratch folks and just
122:39 - contributed just for like a day but I
122:41 - did and I remember I had to learn squeak
122:44 - at the time so I have no idea of any of
122:47 - this and thank you Michael Anderson who
122:48 - made a donation all right so let me
122:52 - let's try ghosts and so I can do set
122:57 - know set another effect in the forever
122:59 - loop set ghost effect two variables
123:06 - speed I might need to multiply speed by
123:10 - something right but let's see what
123:13 - happens if I try this I expected it to
123:20 - fade out
123:27 - what am I doing wrong here what am I
123:30 - missing
123:30 - I was expecting the ghost effect if it's
123:34 - set by speed then speed is some value
123:37 - going down to zero I was expecting to
123:42 - see them maybe fade away but I don't
123:46 - really see that happening any ideas
123:52 - distance from beach ball times some
123:55 - constant I don't need to do the stuff
124:00 - before the forever loop because yeah
124:05 - that's probably true because it's kind
124:08 - of getting all those set here change not
124:11 - set what is the range of the ghost it's
124:22 - fading out only a smarta Matt Matt okay
124:24 - let's change how did is there a way a
124:32 - nice way to get just one of these out of
124:34 - here okay I guess I have to break it off
124:36 - put this back so let's go to change
124:44 - [Music]
124:45 - change Ghost effect by twenty five five
124:52 - oh maybe aha
124:57 - it's going up ghost is not like I think
125:00 - of guy I think of transparency as a
125:03 - number between zero and say 255 or zero
125:06 - and 100 so 100 being fully opaque and
125:09 - counting down to zero but the ghosts
125:12 - effect is the is the inverse of that the
125:15 - more I apply the ghost effect the more
125:18 - transparent it will be so I want to
125:20 - change the ghost effect by let's say
125:23 - just one and maybe I want to change it
125:28 - by five yeah so but then I need to set
125:35 - the ghost effect when they get back to
125:38 - the beginning the
125:40 - set ghosts effect to zero beautiful I
125:50 - could do a hundo so it's zero to a
125:52 - hundred okay zero to 100 is there a map
125:55 - function like a map block in I could
125:59 - make my own map block that's something
126:02 - I'll do another time okay so this is our
126:05 - this is my thank you to first responders
126:10 - an essential workers digital card that
126:12 - my kids were doing with me and we're
126:14 - teaching me scratch but they left they
126:16 - got bored after an hour and went to play
126:18 - roblox because such as life let's see
126:21 - what I mean to save now see project page
126:25 - made on the coding train Oh as taught by
126:34 - operator number zero e and operator
126:39 - number one Oh
126:44 - and so thank you to essential workers
126:58 - and first responders can I put like a
127:01 - little you know heart or whatever and
127:08 - okay let's let's add a little train
127:13 - let's put a URL to what we're doing
127:18 - right now which is this let me turn off
127:25 - my sound copy video URL and also lets
127:39 - and there was a if you give me a second
127:42 - I want to find its I want to find there
127:45 - was a local charity for Brooklyn let me
127:53 - try to find
127:54 - I don't um so I had so this is also just
128:06 - [Music]
128:13 - this is just for where I live in my
128:15 - local community let me get back to here
128:22 - let me get to here I'm gonna just give a
128:26 - link also to this organization which is
128:30 - the Brooklyn Community Foundation which
128:32 - is a response fund for much needed
128:35 - resources here in Brooklyn and one
128:38 - percent of all donations are going to
128:40 - high impact nonprofits in Brooklyn so if
128:42 - you feel so inclined these are two
128:45 - organizations that you can donate to I'm
128:47 - picking them admittedly somewhat
128:49 - arbitrarily um there's lots of
128:51 - organizations that could use help and
128:55 - that I think one way to make an impact
128:56 - is just donating funds and I rose a lot
128:58 - of people are out of work and finances
129:00 - are really tough I'm very lucky to still
129:03 - have my job at NYU and be able to do
129:05 - this live streaming thing train emoji
129:09 - was changed to a question mark I'm not
129:11 - sure what that refers to
129:12 - but let me go back to here oh yeah I
129:14 - don't know why the emoji yet maybe it
129:16 - doesn't like to have emojis here but
129:18 - [Music]
129:19 - let's not worry about that let's hit
129:23 - save and stop and then there we go we'll
129:28 - watch it one more time
129:29 - right okay I'm gonna see if I could get
129:31 - operator 0 & 1 to come see this and give
129:35 - me their feedback and if the link here
129:42 - if I don't know if somebody can post
129:43 - this into the chat this is the link for
129:45 - the project and give me a second I will
129:48 - be right back
129:53 - see my wife still open here here come's
130:39 - operator zero for the grand tonight you
130:43 - can come sit in your spot operator zero
130:44 - you can help me say goodbye on the
130:47 - stream David Schneider is wanting to is
130:51 - reminding me that would you like to you
130:54 - can you can do some drawings here to say
130:55 - goodbye thank you everybody so let but
130:59 - you want to come see what I'm what I did
131:01 - with your drawing let's let me turn the
131:04 - music off here so let's go to the
131:08 - scratch page see inside operator
131:13 - operator number one will you come over
131:16 - to the screen you're drawing hold up
131:21 - come see it I want to hear your feedback
131:23 - alright operator zero you're looking
131:25 - right so this is what I made starts with
131:28 - a coding train wallpaper ok operators
131:32 - one is coming okay ready
131:33 - here it is so the beach ball comes up it
131:35 - bursts in the center the stars pop out
131:37 - and they keep going like that they fade
131:39 - out and they go and go and go what do
131:40 - you think it's good do you have any idea
131:44 - any do you are you curious about any of
131:46 - the code bits how I did it or do you
131:48 - have any ideas for if we were going to
131:50 - work on it more what would be good to do
131:51 - next how I made the Stars come out okay
131:56 - so the way I made the Stars come out is
131:58 - and I can go back here to this view so
132:03 - what's the Stars code is here and
132:06 - basically the thing that I learned is
132:08 - that I can make fifty copies of the
132:11 - Stars with this create a clone and then
132:14 - all the stars have this exact same code
132:16 - so now here each one that have that
132:21 - burst message they each get out of their
132:23 - own color they get a speed they go to
132:25 - the witch where the beach ball was but
132:28 - the trick is that I have a speed
132:30 - variable so they all move by speed the
132:34 - speed looks I guess you could go back
132:40 - down hold on what you click on here do
132:44 - we lose the live stream no we're still
132:46 - going so the speed goes down by to the
132:51 - ghost effect fades them out and then
132:53 - once the speed reaches zero they reset
132:57 - them all so uninterested I mean if only
133:09 - they you know I would say like oh
133:10 - they're downstairs and they're playing
133:12 - like you know some kind of dude I don't
133:14 - know they're just on a different screen
133:16 - doing a different computer thing okay
133:21 - let's go to here so thank you everybody
133:25 - for tuning in to this live stream let's
133:28 - see if I can get everything up on the
133:30 - screen that I want which is and we're
133:33 - going to go back to the project page I'm
133:36 - gonna zoom this in above here so and
133:39 - let's see if I can vary oh the green
133:43 - screen I wanted to try look okay the guy
133:47 - did want to try the green screen so
133:49 - let's before I go let's try that I'll
133:52 - also take any questions oh and did I
133:55 - actually announce the QA so I hope to be
133:59 - back and live-streaming once per week
134:01 - next week
134:02 - I also hope to record without a live
134:04 - stream some video tutorials that I will
134:06 - up look at edited and upload
134:09 - particularly related to the nature of
134:13 - code playlist that I've been working on
134:15 - and then one thing that's new which
134:17 - you're not
134:18 - right now is I have the ability it's a
134:21 - very fancy technical system technology
134:24 - I've got here for people to call in and
134:27 - I can wear a headset and hear them and
134:30 - then send their audio through to the
134:31 - live stream so we have some plans to
134:33 - manage in discord what's going on not a
134:38 - battery plug it in I so I'm gonna try
134:45 - having people call in and ask questions
134:46 - I mean they can do some live office
134:49 - hours or give feedback on code projects
134:51 - and that kind of thing so that's gonna
134:52 - happen hopefully sometime next week I
134:54 - don't know when yet anybody want to
134:57 - bring me a cap I could use a cap what
135:01 - well you could find the cats so but I
135:09 - have a new toy that I'm going to reveal
135:14 - to you right now let me go back just to
135:16 - here let's see what happens
135:31 - all right let's see here now what I'm
135:34 - going to do is go to this view
135:40 - alright and I'm gonna sit down over here
135:43 - on my OBS and let's do some things here
135:50 - let's go to well let's just try filters
135:57 - turn the chroma key on alright and then
136:03 - let's unlock it and move it over a
136:06 - little bit and there we go
136:09 - mission accomplished well let's get
136:19 - higher but it did what everybody wanted
136:21 - so I'm wearing this shirt I mean I think
136:23 - I might just go back to here it actually
136:25 - just goes to that I have it set that the
136:28 - green screen is only in here is this
136:31 - still oh I have to move that over and
136:35 - then so let me fix this also this will
136:38 - be for future videos move this over the
136:42 - autofocus is going a little crazy so I
136:48 - should be able to do my weird gesturing
136:50 - at things and also have more available
136:53 - I'm very tiny I probably want to make
136:55 - myself a little bigger I am a ghost do
137:05 - have a sweatshirt
137:09 - which will bring me back I know
137:18 - everybody loves this shirt but I want to
137:19 - see what this really looks like here
137:25 - it's really raining up there and they're
137:28 - still this is the Greek alright Here I
137:35 - am on the coding train so thanks for
137:46 - tuning in this is pretty much all I've
137:49 - got for today I hope you enjoyed this I
137:53 - enjoyed making this scratch project I
137:56 - don't know maybe you could give me like
137:57 - a heart or a star or I got some what
138:00 - does this mean does this mean somebody
138:03 - remade their own version like is there a
138:06 - way I can find I have 30 messages in my
138:09 - inbox we've got all of you messaging me
138:11 - oh you can't see the size is about right
138:16 - okay so this is good I feel good about
138:20 - this I'm curious I would love any
138:23 - feedback in terms of the quality of this
138:24 - stream you know sort of like just audio
138:28 - video I'm using this mic which is
138:30 - different usually I wear a lav mic but
138:31 - I've got this
138:56 - you
139:12 - [Music]
139:47 - [Music]
139:48 - test oh okay the mic is back so I think
139:52 - I've got kind of a pretty bad USB cable
139:55 - here I need to get another one what's
139:58 - going on no one wants to bring me a cat
140:08 - okay I have got the the mic is back so
140:14 - thank you for tuning in this has been a
140:17 - 2 hour and 20 minute livestream and I
140:23 - know one found me a cat and so what do I
140:31 - want to say what else do I want to say I
140:32 - think this is all I have to say I'm
140:34 - finishing up and I'm gonna sip this
140:39 - going I'm gonna go I'm gonna go find a
140:41 - cat I need a cat you guys like goodbye
140:44 - with a cat I gotta see if the cat works
140:47 - with the green screen okay so let's I'm
140:50 - gonna find myself a cat I will be right
140:51 - back
141:05 - [Music]
141:40 - [Music]
141:45 - okay
141:46 - you like my coding tutorials you won't
141:49 - run away and get bored and just go play
141:51 - roblox will you no no no you won't no no
141:55 - no I've got you yes yes ah you're such a
141:59 - good kitty yeah yeah good kitties oh
142:01 - this cat is an indoor cat does not go
142:05 - outside except given the quarantine and
142:08 - all the staying at home we have been
142:10 - taking this cat outside on a leash she
142:12 - loves it loves it just meowing meows
142:15 - scratches jumps up tries to get out the
142:16 - door the other cat Eevee not so much
142:19 - don't wanna go outside no interest none
142:21 - whatsoever
142:21 - okay oh you want to tap the microphone
142:26 - yes it is a good microphone yes all
142:33 - right I was saying goodbye so stay tuned
142:41 - it's a little bit tricky for me to live
142:43 - stream here from home there's a lot of
142:44 - distractions yeah I took a break already
142:49 - I'm sitting I'm saying goodbye to
142:50 - everybody now would you like to draw
142:52 - another drawing goodbye drawing no you
142:56 - want the cat no this is my baby don't
142:59 - take my baby away
143:08 - bring me a kitty can't somebody pay and
143:10 - bring me a cat so I hope to be back and
143:17 - making tutorials third grade happens
143:20 - right over there
143:21 - I'm actually what's interesting is this
143:24 - camera I realize is like a webcam so I
143:27 - can kind of can kind of see what's
143:29 - upside-down but this is where third
143:31 - grade happens you can see the desk it's
143:35 - all upside down oops
143:36 - over here that's so third grade is
143:40 - happening in my live streaming studio I
143:42 - don't know what I'm doing here let's
143:43 - just let's just come back and speak to
143:45 - you uh-huh
143:46 - third grade is happening here at home
143:48 - fifth grade starts on Monday all meals
143:51 - I'm quite the breakfast chef if I don't
143:54 - say so myself we've been cooking all of
143:57 - our meals at home we're really into
144:01 - Harry Potter is what's happening during
144:02 - our quarantine but I hope to be able to
144:05 - engage with the coding train community I
144:07 - remember what I wanted to say so one of
144:10 - the things that I'm interested in
144:11 - looking at is this is a really excellent
144:15 - article that it's from the Washington
144:18 - Post Harry Stevens which does some nice
144:21 - simulations of their called like a sir
144:24 - model and and also a three blue one
144:31 - brown also made a video about
144:35 - simultaneous simulating an epidemic with
144:38 - these sir models so what I'm hoping to
144:44 - do actually may be on oh you don't see
144:46 - my screen oh and the worst I'm not used
144:51 - to this setup I'm not used to where the
144:52 - buttons are and changing things but this
144:56 - is the Washington Post article that I
144:58 - think is really amazing use of
145:01 - computational animation and simulation
145:04 - to demonstrate an idea and a three blue
145:07 - one Brown takes those ideas and and and
145:09 - goes quite far with them in this video
145:12 - that I would really encourage you
145:14 - encourage you to watch and so I'm hoping
145:17 - that my next livestream will be making a
145:19 - simple p5.js
145:22 - of these kinds of simulations I don't
145:25 - necessarily have anything new to add
145:28 - from a scientific standpoint and that
145:32 - quite certainly not my area of expertise
145:34 - but I think what I do have to have
145:36 - something to add is if you were
145:37 - interested in learning how to program
145:39 - something like this then that's
145:42 - something that I can help teach and give
145:44 - a little tutorial and there's so much in
145:46 - these simulations that is very similar
145:48 - to what is in the nature of code
145:52 - tutorials and and the like so as you can
145:56 - see well interestingly what's what's
145:59 - recommended to me over here in the
146:01 - sidebar which is kind of interesting to
146:02 - see let's see we've got a lot a lot of
146:06 - videos here that are about math and
146:09 - science stuff okay so thank you all for
146:13 - watching I'll play my little goodbye
146:15 - music and I'm gonna just say Simon is
146:24 - writing that also working on a co vid 19
146:29 - simulation and p5 you got a cat for me I
146:51 - will take just a few questions let me
146:54 - learn how to put this thing down
146:59 - I don't want to break it you better
147:06 - worry about this later I'm gonna put the
147:09 - green screen down later does it just
147:11 - like there like a little release did it
147:20 - [Music]
147:22 - kind of what it's fine I'll leave it
147:28 - [Music]
147:29 - plea can you please look at the comments
147:32 - on the scratch project okay I can do
147:35 - that before I go I'm just gonna make
147:38 - sure there I'm not being trolled here
147:41 - and that they're perfectly kind comments
147:43 - Oh cute project nope
147:47 - okay let's delete this comment okay oh
147:55 - there's a remix most of the comments are
147:58 - just saying hi and I'm from the stream
148:01 - so loved watching the stream my remix so
148:05 - I don't think I think everything's okay
148:07 - here let me look at this remix though
148:10 - from Gee Gee go gee I know I'm not
148:15 - showing you the screen let's I'm just
148:20 - checking to make sure it's okay for me
148:21 - to look at to everyone who helps and
148:27 - helped beat the coronavirus okay I'll
148:29 - show this one project that was shared
148:35 - here so this is from gog who created a
148:39 - remix that says to everyone who helps
148:41 - and help the coronavirus so that looks
148:43 - like just adding a nice little extra
148:45 - text message and let's run this again
148:49 - and see that there thank you very much
148:51 - for that wonderful remix quite
148:53 - appreciated okay
148:59 - G go G sorry G go G machine learning and
149:03 - scratch please any last questions I will
149:10 - take them I've got about a minute left
149:12 - of this goodbye music and thank you all
149:15 - for tuning in it's much appreciated I
149:18 - look forward to being back and doing
149:20 - more live stream so the coding train I
149:22 - don't know how this was feedback was
149:24 - definitely appreciated
149:26 - I hear the pitter-patter of feet is
149:39 - someone bringing me a cat no no cat
149:50 - Thank You Jorge
149:52 - thank you for your all of your kind
149:53 - messages will I - q-learning
149:58 - I mean it's kind of on the long long
150:00 - list of things but are you doing more
150:03 - scratch no more today
150:12 - what you drawn I'm learning my lock asks
150:24 - I'm learning p5.js and I've come to the
150:27 - end of the first playlist what's next
150:30 - great question so I would say you could
150:38 - use one of the sharpies if you want I
150:42 - would say that so a place that you can
150:48 - look is the coding train comm and if you
150:51 - go here under learning I would say any
150:53 - of these actually I think one of oh
150:55 - sorry you can't see this any of these at
150:58 - the coding train comm under learning
151:00 - would be good next steps I might suggest
151:05 - the nature of code playlist or the data
151:08 - and api's playlist or the ml 5 beginners
151:10 - guide any of these I guess advanced p5
151:13 - guess so one thing I guess I should make
151:15 - a note of I think I would like to change
151:16 - this I don't like using the word
151:17 - advanced I don't I think advanced is I
151:22 - think there are better ways to describe
151:24 - how different things can be sequenced
151:27 - and what level or what kinds of
151:29 - knowledge are expected for certain kinds
151:31 - of content and I don't know that
151:33 - advanced is really the right term so
151:35 - it's like maybe it's just like p5.js
151:36 - continued or it's like something like
151:39 - that so I'll think about what could be
151:41 - better but grant is saying go be with
151:44 - your kids thanks for a weird live stream
151:47 - indeed but yes so this I would say
151:51 - there's some good places for some next
151:52 - steps what else did you work on scratch
151:57 - like you mentioned twirl so I just you
152:01 - don't have to really kind of dig into my
152:03 - memory more deeply and kind of really
152:06 - think about this but I call working on
152:11 - image processing filters so and I
152:14 - specifically remember like the world
152:16 - effect but I but mostly I might have
152:19 - done the pixel 8:1 and when I say have
152:21 - done I worked on a version iteration of
152:24 - them at one
152:25 - time so whatever is in scratch now might
152:27 - be completely disconnected from that
152:29 - because that was back in 2004 and I've
152:31 - always followed the scratch project it's
152:33 - a wonderful tool and learning
152:35 - environment it's they do a really a
152:37 - wonderful job of managing their
152:38 - community and allowing kids to learn and
152:40 - create and share so so I encourage you
152:46 - especially if you have if you have kids
152:49 - who are wanting to learn about coding in
152:50 - their kind of in the elementary school
152:52 - age on scratch is a wonderful place to
152:54 - start so I would like to actually do
152:56 - some more now I have two dreams of like
152:58 - every day at lunchtime coming on and
153:00 - doing a little scratch but time wise I
153:02 - don't see how me to make that happen
153:03 - right now but we'll see if I can get
153:05 - some more stuff yes you know you could
153:09 - bring we do these plugs you can bring
153:11 - them to other outlets and plug them in
153:16 - alright thanks everybody for tuning in I
153:22 - am going to say goodbye thank you I
153:28 - think this says it all from my heart to
153:32 - yours stay safe stay inside stay well be
153:36 - well there's anything that the coding
153:38 - train community can do to support you
153:41 - your community please reach out the best
153:45 - place to do that would be on discord
153:47 - which I am just posting to the chat now

154:01 - virtual hugs to the extent that you can
154:03 - and I look forward to seeing you all
154:08 - next week sometime on the coding train
154:11 - next livestream I hope to do a sir
154:16 - modeling simulation in p5.js it's kind
154:19 - of a topic that I'm thinking about but
154:20 - if you have other ideas for things that
154:21 - I can do let me know okay good bye
154:24 - everybody
154:24 - love you all thanks for thanks for this

155:48 - I always forget
156:57 - [Music]
157:07 - I'm gonna do this this stock this dog
157:10 - the star that this stock song never
157:11 - forget the business so this is random
157:13 - this is noise pearly noise that is in
157:16 - the core random algorithm the actual
157:18 - random algorithm itself those numbers
157:21 - aren't related at all you pick like I'm
157:23 - picking random numbers between zero and
157:25 - ten nine two seven six one nine four
157:29 - eight nine two one three I think nine
157:32 - lot family but with curly noise I might
157:35 - pick numbers like this two three four
157:37 - three four five six five four five six
157:41 - seven five six seven five six seven
157:44 - eight nine eight seven this is like
157:47 - Berlin noise performance part
157:54 - to
158:01 - like birthing noise performance apart
158:09 - with curly noise I might pick numbers
158:11 - like this
158:19 - Perlin noise that it's Hurley noise so
158:21 - this is Hurley noise that it's Hurley no
158:23 - this is this is Hurley noise that it's
158:24 - Hurley no so this is Hurley noise that
158:26 - is her pearling know her Perlin noise
158:28 - that it's Hurley noise this is Hurley
158:29 - noise that is Hurley this is this is
158:31 - Hurley noise that is Hurley so this is
158:33 - Hurley noise but with early noise I
158:52 - might pick numbers like this
159:08 - this is like Portland noise performance
159:10 - part unicorns and rainbows and unicorns
159:17 - and rainbows and cupcakes what else is
159:20 - there
159:22 - yes kittens thank you very much kittens
159:24 - and rainbows and cupcakes notice that
159:27 - look what I get
