00:06 - the core idea of the wave function
00:08 - collapse algorithm is to take an input
00:10 - image and generate an output image many
00:13 - output images that all mimic the style
00:16 - the pattern of that original image
00:18 - don't you just feel so much more at ease
00:20 - and relax tile images ah
00:23 - no no i'm not relaxed at all in fact i'm
00:26 - totally panicking i think my brain is
00:28 - collapsing it works it works we're
00:31 - getting somewhere so stick with me all
00:33 - aboard let's try to make wave function
00:36 - collapse happen
